I'm gonna have to start off this live tweet of #debatenight2.0 by asking @CNN to STOP calling @HillaryClinton a "victim".
I can't lie I die laughing EVERY time I hear a staunch news reporter repeat the phrase; "grab them by the pussy" #TrumpTapes
This debate is going to be a garbage fire of darkness.
I'm confused. I thought Hillary was running for president and not Bill?? ü§î https://t.co/iWl0VQPrg8

For months, many anti-Trump conservatives walked on eggshells around Trumpers. I think this delicacy -- even a fear -- is lessening.

I anticipate that this second debate is going to be fantastic and nauseating television.
@HowardKurtz I'm thinking the Clintons got to the bottom all by themselves. No assist needed from @realDonaldTrump.
Ok. @andersoncooper is there. I feel better already. #debate
Reddit live stream is about 30s ahead of YouTube live stream #debates #spoileralert

@HowardKurtz Hope Trump doesn't offer these women a Tic Tac
Debate
Let's see how awful this debate will be...  I think Cooper will keep it somewhat civil
I need to start relieving myself of Trump supporters. I can understand not wanting Clinton but rooting for HIM, I can't understand that
Trump just fired his cut man and replaced him with his dermatoligist...
#debate
#foxnews @FoxNews @CNNManager @CarmineZozzora next thing you know Hillary wants to know if we can bomb Trump's motorcade with a drone?

Great first question from the audience member at tonight's #debate
Starting the Presidential debate one candidate stood in front of her chair &amp; one candidate circled behind his chair and podium.
Does Trump even remember the question? #debate
What's the point of a debate if the candidates don't answer the questions asked ¬ø?
I thought Hillary considered half of Republicans as "Deplorable's" Doesn't sound like she wants to work for all of us.
WHEN SOMEONE ASKS @realDonaldTrump WHAT HES GONNA DO TO ADDRESS SEXUAL ASSAULT IN THE MILITARY. #IRONY
Primer error de Trump, no se dirige de frente a la que hizo la pregunta.
We can't believe you're a politician either @realDonaldTrump  #debatenight

Trump says the actions he described on tape could not be classified as sexual assault, calls it "locker room talk." Then he brings up ISIS.

#debates he answers questions like a man that is trying to cover his cheating
What question is Trump answering?
NO, @realDonaldTrump, JUST NO. An array of bad things going in the world do NOT detract from your behavior or excuse you. #Debate
Did trump just excuse his "locker room banter" by saying he'll knock the hell out of ISIS? How is that related? #PresidentialDebate
Trump has great respect for women? No one has more respect for women than him? Excuse me while I go laugh this off.... #debate 

When it comes down to it, Hilary's previous decisions have KILLED Americans. Trumps have not.
@bigpictureguy3 @realDonaldTrump talked about it, but the #HillaryClinton and her husband actually did it!!!!!

Yes because @realDonaldTrump is frank and tells people off, he's racist, sexist, and unfit to be president. #debate
I wonder if Trump uses the binary scale
#ClintonTrump R1 Hillary with a FLASH knockdown!!! Trump does not seem hurt .. he walked into that punch..
Trump is talking about war crimes because its the only thing he can conceive of that's worse than himself.
@andersoncooper is gutsy and putting his career on the line tonight. And for the right reasons. #debate
Is Trump on Xanax?  #debate
So it's ok for #DonaldTrump to brag about assaulting women because......#ISIS ?   #debates #denegration #noThanks

America is great because we are good. - @HillaryClinton #debate #ImWithHer
Talking point #1: "we are already great because we're good" #debate

Also @realDonaldTrump: "A person who's flat chested is very hard to be a 10, okay?"
I need to be a moderator, everyone who knows me can say I will not back down asking the tough questions #debate
HRC is now trying to bury Trump by going back to first question. Making argument for the people. #debate2016

Anderson Cooper-   "what about the recent leak of your 'locker room banter?'"                                          Donald Trump- "ISIS"
So it's Isis fault you grab that pussy? @realDonaldTrump
Trump went with the "You Want Chris Brown or John Legend in a Fight with ISIS" foreign policy in response to the tapes
Is trump for real? Need more wine
#debates @realDonaldTrump is exactly who we think he is.
Geez, didn't he get a coach in the past two weeks? Locker room talk to ISIS in the same sentence? #debates2016

Wow...I think Hillary just walked into a trap...
If Trump thinks he's going to repeat the same handful of talking points all night he is woefully mistaken.

I might have to shut this off. I can't.  #debate
.Trump says he wants to help African-Americans and Latinos- I guess he means only pretty ones who are thin and don't say NO in any language
Anderson Cooper looks like he's ideal husband material tonight in the debate lmao
#NeverHillaryOrTrump #neverus
3 on 1 tonight in the debate. Shocker
All women don't be manipulated by the devil who wears are clothing Hillary Clinton.
If you aren't proud of it, APOLOGIZE and stop saying it's just locker room talk #debate
Wouldn't be surprised if the GOP pulls the plug on Trump if he loses this debate
#debatenight #Trump not proud of it but Bill Clinton much worse snort snort snort
Every time #Trump says it was "just locker room talk" he continues to smack all women in the face. #debate #debate2016
Locker room talk. Give it up. You are a sexual predator. #DebateNight

@CNNPolitics let's get to the issues #debates
The question now is....does @realDonaldTrump even show up for the third debate?
#debate
Locker room talk sounds horrifying. But I don't think Trump has been in many locker rooms.
Again with the sniffling.   #debate
"But Bill Clinton..."

Cool, you aren't proud of it and you justify your words as locker room talk, that does not mean it is okay! @realDonaldTrump
Calling it "locker room talk" doesn't excuse it you misogynist asshole #drumpf #debates
And here we go! Trump had started the allegations on Bill Clinton.
I'm sure every man in American that you want to "bring together" has said something along the lines of what trump said 11 years ago?
That's right @realDonaldTrump, play into the Clinton's trap...
Trump's misunderstanding of the severity of his statements illustrates the issue better than anything. "Just words" are important. Sit down.
And u have sexual assault allegations well #debate
Define DESPERATION. #debate2016
Petulant @realDonaldTrump claiming the #Debate is unfair. Gutter politician. Unfit.
Oh man. #debates
we're not talking about Bill Clinton .. we're talking about YOU!

Locker room talk equates to rape culture, Donald
#Debates2016

@collweb23 the point is, Mr. Trump, that YOU, as a possible leader of the free world, should KNOW BETTER than to demean women.

I'm not going to make it. Taking a drink every time Trump sniffles was not a good idea. Already on my second drink.

"Locker Room Talk." The title of Trump's autobiography. #debates
Hillary had that fly on her face because she is dead inside
That didn't take long-less than 20 minutes in for Trump to bring up Bill Clinton's accusers, says his wife "should be ashamed of herself"
This is brutal. #debate
Trumpster's giving the game away

At least when Hillary uses Michelle Obama's words, she quotes her... unlike somebody's wife... #DebateNight
'Locker room talk' insinuates all men speak that way about women. They don't &amp; that's offensive. Saying it was wrong wld be better. #debate
All I want is a lil shoulder shimmy from ya girl Hillary. #2ndPresidentialDebate #Decision2016
You know Trump is holding the microphone like that because he can't wrap his tiny hand around it #debate

Trump just listed a bunch of people that he respects. Didn't mention women. So. #debate2016

DT: "Well I'm very sorry I never had one. ISIS. Borders. So fast. MAGA."
@AdamJacobs84 that was also a real life fly that landed on HRC's face. #clintonfly
Makes me sick that a #PresidentialDebate has this subject going on - this man does not respect the position he is trying to get elected for
when Trump uses Bill Clinton's actions against Hillary just proves his misogynistic thinking
I'm hoping that one of them just *drops mic* at the end of this #debate like how is this serious
#TrumpTroll #trdw
Hold up, did Trump just call Hillary the devil?
@502_Finest fam. He won this debate nuff said lol
Why is Hillary Clintons smile so creepy?
Yeah, y'all let's give up on anything related to policy and a vision of the future tonight. #debates
presidential debate or petty high school drama?¬ø
Hillary should straight up shut her mouth nowüòÇ
Pretty clear what Trump's plan is: go down guns blazing.
@ErnestSIII I couldn't believe it. Very unlucky for her. The only thing we need now is flies to come out of Trump's mouth when he sniffles.
These debates would be so much better with @Coach_Tea There have been several perfect opportunities for airhorns and gunshots. @RoastBattle
I'm sorry but can we talk about the real issues going on and not how y'all feel about each other. Wtf is going on here #debate

This is so beyond cringeworthy #debate
This debate looks more like a roast on Comedy Central than anything resembling political dialogue
Trump loves pussy and guns he has my vote
This is the worst debate of all time
Hillary Clinton's campaign videos are literally just clips of Trump talking, because that's all she needs.
Can't expect to attack someone and not expect an attack back.Bill Clinton's actions are fair to bring up. Afterall, this is politics.
My eyes hurt and my brain is deteriorating #debates
Why aren't more men pissed that "it's just the way men talk" is a reason to excuse @realDonaldTrump words? #Debates
Lets just spend the whole debate on each others problems not about the problems of this country
Holy crap. @realDonaldTrump, absolutely NOBODY believes your claim that HRC started the birther movement.
donald trump is honestly a kid. he would rather bash hilary instead of answering the actual question.
Bashing Michelle Obama - not a winning tactic. #debate
Hillary needs some teeth whitening üåö
Can't get over the fact that people actually support trump he is nothing but a bully
Trump still insisting that Clinton started the birther movement #debate
@realDonaldTrump How will you address relations with Russia and our international reputation in tonight's #debate?

@YoungDems4Trump - Right off the Bat !!!!!!! Worst moderator #debate
Trump just called Clinton "the devil"

Also recommended: Witches, Salem 1692, which is an excellent book
@HillaryClinton   Don't lose your cool....

@realDonaldTrump You sound like a pro-wrestler trash talking before a round. She looks relaxed because you are losing the debate by yourself
Looking for Hillary eyes to start going in opposite directions.. #debates
Say stupid things, sniffle sniffle sniffle; repeat. That's Trumps platform #Debate

Presidents don't threaten their political adversaries with special prosecutors. Dictators do. #debate

Excellent way for Trump to really the Sean Hannity-Roger Stone constituency.
Hillary tried making trump look bad but trump stepped on her throat üòÇüî•
Hillary for Prison!
Is Trump talking about jeans?
Gonna try to refrain from political tweets tonight but I'm afraid Trump is going to sniff the microphone up one of his nostrils
Trump leaps through maze of attacks: Blumenthal is ‚Äúreal winner,‚Äù sent pictures around, Michelle Obama bad-mouthed her, unfair to Sanders.

Donald Trump says Hillary Clinton should be "ashamed of herself" for chastising him for comments made about women 11 years ago @WCPO
When someone says you‚Äôre a liar it‚Äôs not a good strategy to say they‚Äôre a liar in turn #Debate
FFS. If you want to have the audience be quiet, don't invite them to the debate. An audience at the debate is pointless.
Did anyone DVR the #debate? I'm ready to fast forward past his comments.
So basically what I'm getting from this debate is that we have two unfit candidates, can we do something about this üôÉ
"That's cuz you'd be in jail" GO BABY #trumptrain

Hilary could delete a million emails and it would never be as bad a pussing grabbing racist sexist @realDonaldTrump #debate
"Its a good thing you're not running our legal system" - @HillaryClinton 

"Because you'd be in jail" - @realDonaldTrump 

#boom
flipping back and forth between the giants game and the debate and both are equally as upsetting
Not gonna lie, but I love the fact that my wife, who just registered to vote, is actually watching the #debate

Cant wait till @andersoncooper turns the house lights on &amp; off and says "I can wait as long as you can, folks." #PresidentialDebate

Trump‚Äôs tranquilizers just wore off.
Trump: you should be ashamed for deleting emails.

Trump: I'm not ashamed for admitting to sexual assault.

How long does it take to send 33,000 emails? #debate

It's a kitchen sink festival at the town hall debate!
You've clearly never planned a wedding @realDonaldTrump. 33,000 emails is low balling it.
I think that's my final comment about this debate too. Neither one of them is good for America or good for other women (ironically w hill)
Trump is going in hard
Seriously not voting #debate
@realDonaldTrump is acting like a 12 year old... "You would be in jail." https://t.co/6uKYW61bsb

Hillary is able to apologize for her wrongs. Trump has failed to do that over and over. "Not fit to be president" is an understatement.
@HillaryClinton is an evil witch who only spews bullshit. I hate hearing her talk.

Trump has made many mistakes, but Hillary just runs her campaign on his mistakes, she has no plans or thoughts about anything else
Keep it up @realDonaldTrump shes changing the subject calm down Trump don't be cool
Trump is melting down. #donaldisanasshole.
Don't complain about Hilary as the democratic nominee if you didn't vote for Bernie.
@AlCardenasFL_DC This is not a debate. It's a national tragedy.
Hilary Clinton says Donald wants to avoid talking about his campaign and how it is imploding.

ObamaCare is a job-killer. ObamaCare raises insurance premiums and hurts struggling families.

Trump: "we are going to have plans that are SO good"
*never speaks about what that plan is*
#debate
@pmclellan @jackiecarbajal Liberals showing that they have no class. But it's deplorable if Trump name calls.
All those Canadians coming to the US for healthcare...What?! #DonaldTrump #killyourself
Trump's body language has just been awful. He looks like he is pouting. No respect. #debate #Debates2016
Why can't moderators actually run a debate?! Cooper attacking Trump works to Trump's favor. #debate
Free the insurance companies!  Just like the banks!  Wells Fargo loved it! #debate
#debate Creepy how Trump stands directly behind Hillary
Is this a debate between cooper and trump???? Or????
Making healthcare plans affordable for small businesses...YES PLEASE. #PresidentialDebate #healthcare
Smh #debates
debate games: take a shot every time Donald trump says 33,000 emails
Cooper is badgering rather than moderating. This is not very debate-like. More interview-like, IMO.
He's your rambling racist uncle leaving an allCAPS Facebook comment about OBAMACARE on under a cute picture of Obama's dogs.  #debates
@JasonCAndrew I agree with you, Jason. #BillClinton should be in jail for rape &amp; sexual assault. #HillaryClinton for violating Federal law.
Bro this presidential debate is pure comedy hahahaha #InTears
Can't @HillaryClinton say, "My husband is not running for President." Why should she explain what he said? Let's get to issues. #debates

question: how will you make sure muslim citizens aren't branded as terrorists?

trump: see, the problem starts with these muslim terrorists
Muslims have to report the problems when they see them - him. 

Y'all. Wow. Just. As if Muslims are outchea just hiding crime. #debate
Trump is answering a Muslim woman's question by telling her that SHE and other Muslims need to solve terrorism. Unreal. #debate

Literally leaving a debate party due to anger. Can we replace Donald with a muck-spreading rhino? A more pleasant experience in every way.
Trump is not addressing the question re: helping Muslims deal w consequences of labeling. Instead saying what's wrong w a few. #debate
Um, she asked how to address Islamaphobia, not how to demonstrate it. #debate
To solve a problem you have to say what the problem is. Ok Donald, the problem is you! #Debate #myheadhurts

"We are a country built on religious freedom" -@HillaryClinton YES
The thing that worries me is the Republican candidate that runs after @realDonaldTrump . There was a time when I was worried about Ted Cruz
Vetting makes perfect sense but leave it to Trump to make it sound like an end-of-days Immortan Joe situation.
@HillaryClinton @CNN because they are a threat and need to be vetted.. if their background is good then they come in.. common sense
@kingscrossed @MichaelSteele He doesn't support Trump or Repubs so it doesn't mean a whole lot that he was former Chairman of GOP.
It amazes me that in the year 2016 we are seeing the issue of religious liberty as a top debate topic.
If I were @HillaryClinton, I think I would be rage crying right about now. How can you have a #debate when your opponent just spews lies?
This debate is just an attack on Donald Trump, that's all it is. 2 Democratic coordinators that are completely one-sided. I can't watch.

Someone should tell Trump that a senator can‚Äôt just ‚Äúmake things happen.‚Äù
Why is it solely #hillarys fault for all of the problems in our country? #debates try actually having real plans #trump #dumpsterfire
Bernie hearing his name come out of Trumps mouth https://t.co/gAxtquFuys

@AC360 come on Anderson...please keep Trump on message and push him to answer the question
It's like @realDonaldTrump is saying "Why do you keep hitting yourself?" like a 10-year-old.
How many times are we going to just allow him to interrupt like a child? #debate2016
@HillaryClinton's face during Trump's responses is the face of a person who knows God is testing her
"She allowed to respond, she didn't interrupt you." #debate
AC: "Did you pay taxes?"
Trump: "She had 30 years to get me to pay federal taxes but she didn't. Failure."
AC: "So no?"
Trump: "ISIS=HRC!!!"
I will be the president who gets rid of carried interest. @HillaryClinton

Trump really just doesn't understand how Congress and the Senate works at all
Hillary said no tax increase on the American people, Obama care was the biggest tax ever and she wants to keep it
No he didnt just blame ISIS on obama and Clinton #SHADE #debate
In her 30 years she should've worked out a deal with the Congress instead of alienating them #debate
i don't think donald trump knows how the branches of government work but okay #debate
LMAO watch the people who are gonna vote for 3rd parties or choose not to vote be surprised if Trump wins this November. #debate
DONALD TRUMP LITERALLY HAS NO CLUE WHAT HE'S DOING
Hilary sits respectfully when Trump is speaking. Trump paces the stage. Interesting. #debate
#debate Again, he blames one senator for being unable to fix every problem.
If you're voting for Donald Trump you need to leave

@TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump Are you fucking high? Cooper has said repeatedly "Please let her finish - she didn't interrupt you."
Does Trump not understand that 436 members of the House vote along with 99 other Senate members? That means Hillary is only as effective as

OK. Turning to the Football Game now. Drumpf makes me sick! #PresidentialElection2016 #Presidentialdebate
@RaymondArroyo @realDonaldTrump is definitely winning. #debate
Donald trump seems to think that as a senator Hillary has control over everything but she is one vote in a hundred.
If Columbus had known his discovery would lead to a debate like this, his ship would have remained in the harbor.
I don't think Trump understands that a single senator can't change the entire infrastructure of the US government. Agree @AndreaWalraven?
hey trump helpful tip from an english minor active speech is more effective than passive speech yw

So, because a black man asks a question, Trump talks about "inner cities"? Insulting.
Trump constantly repeats his simplistic commentary; his supporters need the reminders.

"I will arm the Kurds" #Hillary on defeating ISIS in Iraq. #debate
"Do you believe you can be a President for all people?" is the new worst debate question ever.
Speaking time stats: @HillaryClinton 9,000,000,000 years, @realDonaldTrump 8 seconds...at least that's what he thinks!
Watch Trump criticizing the moderators so he can call this debate rigged - because he knows he's losing. #debate
But how are you going to do all of the crap that you claim your doing to doing @realDonaldTrump #debate2016
@mike_pence @realDonaldTrump really should talk to you as his running mate. Sure you could teach him a lot about Syria. Sorry he doesn't.
@HillaryClinton Mr Trump will bring jobs to black communities
"we'll give economics to people" #debate whaaat?
@FoxNews @HillaryClinton Wow. She can't make that promise about ground troops!
Hillary: "arming the Kurds"
Trump: 'hmmm, curds and whey'
Petulance isn't a good look #debate
Pence is totally dumping Trump. #Debates2016
#debate Can somebody please put something in @realDonaldTrump mouth? My zipper is stuck.

Real talk, is Trump debating Hillary or the moderators??
Martha Raddatz making HRC's argument. LOL #Debates
I actually had to rewind and make sure I heard him correctly. Yep. He threw his running mate under the bus. #debate
Why does Hillary have a mic on her lapel and in her hand? Honestly curious.
@realDonaldTrump: "I haven't spoken to my Vice President but I disagree."  Huh?  #debate
I just told @balletgirl31 that if Trump is elected president, that I won't leave my room because sexual assault won't be frowned upon.

That guy asked his question so slowly that for a moment I thought he was trying to filibuster and run out the clock. #debate
Trump arguing on opponent going over time like he is in a bin round at the end of a BP style open where everyone just wants to drink

"I will fix our inner cities." Trump to the one black audience member.
Who did they get as the follow camera for Clinton? Seriously, you're on international TV. Worst camera work ever. #debate2016
NAFTA was pretty much concluded as a moderate success by the majority of economists. #Debates

Trump keeps getting upset that Hillary is going over time.

Maybe if he would actually answer the questions, they would be more lenient...
@realDonaldTrump you won't be devoted to me cause I live in a war zone as you said at the 1st debate!
Please @realDonaldTrump, tell us about these inner cities you plan to fix that you don't visit.For the culture...#debates

He just said osmosis... Does he even know what that phenomenon is? #Debates2016
Not surprising that #Trump sees a person of color &amp; thinks "inner city..." #debate
Trump: "how many times can I say African Americans and inner cities in one answer?"
Trump is going to "give economics" to people and "fix the inner cities." #PresidentialDebate

I'd give myself liver damage if I took a shot for every time Trump brought up inner cities.
We don't like you Donald, you're a disgrace and embarrassment to America.

#debate @realDonaldTrump hates woman he talks down to @HillaryClinton and Martha the moderator, what a tool. He uses and abuses
"no ground troops". But then, mentions special forces..  those are ground troops Hillary. Sneaky, I bet no one else caught that. #debate
Isn't he the one tweeting at 3am? #debate
I don't think Hillary has hatred in her heart, I just think she's just annoyed by ignorant people. #debates

This debate is all jokes
best part of this debate is that there aren't any commercials #fcapgov
@HillaryClinton has tremendous hatred?  Everything he says is abt himself!  He's insane!

Sex tape! Drink...too much drinking #debate2016
Trump is for THE PEOPLE. I'd prefer Sanders but Clinton made that impossible by stealing the election via @wikileaks

@esthergarciax @Saishaa both of you dead ass annnnoyy me. You act as if I was in deep love with trump.
Put a little hatred in your heart! Man; over-flowing optimism in this debate. God help us
America should not accept the 2 candidates we have. We should not accept the incredibly filtered/biased Media product we are given #debate
"She has tremendous hatred" - this is fitting, coming from someone who specialises in hatred #debate
New drinking game: shot every time Trump says "inner cities." #Debates2016
Who cares if she called some of Trump's supporters deplorables? They ARE deplorable.
You just did mention it üò§ #debate
Is she proud of stealing the nomination from Bernie?#Debates2016

No no, I'm pretty sure you're deplorable if you vote for Trump.
This is the American people during the #debate https://t.co/02nTPBxcpn
I think Hillary is WAAAAY worse than Obama. #Debate
When Trump says, "we can't handle 4 more years of Obama."

NO, WE CAN, JUST LET US KEEP HIM AND TRY AGAIN IN 4 MORE YEARS! #Debates2016
#Hillary can actually bump the number of "deplorables" up after seeing continued support after #Trumptapes. #debatenight.

Well at least he didn't grab her....oh never mind.  #msnbc #debate
To be neutral, Trump actually gave a much better response than Hillary, where she ended up talking about his children than him...?
Also, I'm very shocked because that is the first decent thing Trump has said about anyone this whole election.
Oh burn by Melania, she barely kissed @realDonaldTrump after the debate
I wish the whole debate was as nice and friendly as the last 2 minutes were üòÇüëåüèº
Thanks, @RealDonaldTrump: We need someone who‚Äôs a fighter, who doesn‚Äôt quit, who doesn‚Äôt give up. She‚Äôs got my vote! #Debate
Please tune in for the next debate, which will occur after the "N-Word Tape" drops. #debate
What do I gotta do to sit in at the #debate in vegas!?
Everyone's sayin they want to go crawl in a hole now. I could watch another hour of that debate
"She doesn't quit. She doesn't give up. I respect that." An actual answer and something flattering toward Hillary. That's so refreshing.
#debate  Trump did a wonderful job! You won Mr. Trump! https://t.co/Xj7H3gGX0j
Wow! @realDonaldTrump just earned respect for actually complimenting her when @HillaryClinton complimented his children not him #debate
Can't even with this presidential debate; let's all try to talk about something that matters #stopkony2012
"She doesn't quit, she doesn't give up." Wow. That was the most distinguished part of any of the debates, so far.  #debate
"Say something positive about one another" üôåüèæüëèüèæ. Great conclusion to the debate, sir!! 
#Debate2016
Didn't Trump argue for most of the debate that Clinton doesn't follow through? Wtf

wow. it ends with an honest response from Trump. #debate
Trump finally said something that made sense to me-his compliment of Hillary. #fighter #Debate
#AndersonCooper2016 @MarthaRaddatz win in my book #debates
I think they should move the third debate to Cleveland State
In a surprise closer, Trump actually answered a question. It was the last one, but...I mean...guys. He did it. #debate
Well there you have @realDonaldTrump gave you the reason why Hillary should be voted for.,
WHAT THE FUCK, TRUMP ACTUALLY SAID SOMETHING GENUINELY NICE ABOUT HILLARY #Debate
It took the entire length of the debate, but @realDonaldTrump finally said one decent thing. #debates2016
Nice to see the #Debate can end on a positive.

Trump absolutely knocked it out of the park. He brought up all or negative baggage, and brought up his own policies which are great.
Trump hit themes to rouse his base &amp; was better than @ last #debate, but it won't erase the controversy over his crotch grabbing remarks.

@kyliehaynes_ this tweet on my timeline was in between 7000 debate and angry tweets so this really brought my spirits up.

Very respectable compliments from Donald and Hillary, that was a great way to end
In my opinion, Trump completely owned Hillary in this debate.

How did one of the craziest presidential debates produce such a feminist exchange?" #TrumpvClinton #debate @mic
Basically Hillary said, "Hey Donald, you may be an abhorrent individual, but I respect your children..." #debate
@MSNBC @NBCNews Trump is hanging with family Hillary is interacting with crowd
One of the most effectively moderated debates have ever seen - and under brutal circus. Great props to both. #trumpclintondebate

If you thought Trump lost that debate you clearly were not listening. Trump destroyed her! #debate #CrookedHillary #listentotheproblems
Clinton says she respects Trump's Children and Trump says he respects that Clinton is a fighter. They shook hands to conclude #debate.

Remember when McCain was criticized for dismissive pointing? "That one" moment was a problem for him. Now we have Trump.
#debate
Who won??
Watching the #PresidentialDebate
Trump won when he did not use "Hillary" and "sex tape" in the same sentence.
@chucktodd WHAT ARE YOU talking about? Trump did well? WHAT???
These rap battles need a better beat. #debate
@OmarKelly For @AndersonCooper being a Clinton donor. he did a decent job.. much better than the other #debates combined.

#LetKenBoneDebate
Nobody care about 11 year old talk. Hilary sucks.just talk and talk.#PresidentialDebate
The last question made me like Trump a little. Good to know that Hillary won't give up. Wait, Trump said it...It's a lie. I'm confused.
Trump focused on tearing a woman down, per usual. Clinton focused on the American people tonight. #ImWithHer #debate
Donald trump answered... 

Zero questions.
I think Hillary is pulling a warriors in the finals just to sign Durant move
I'm so so glad to see news anchors calling Donald out for sexual assault and not buying into "locker room" bulkshit #debate
I just want Hillary to start talking about the dangers of toxic masculinity. Is that too much to ask? @HillaryClinton
Hey didn't @HillaryClinton want to put cole miners out of business !? #debate
Trumps senior campaign adviser is named Boris and has a Russian accent.
2-0 Hillary @CNN get it together

@Mad_Jamaican  quit being ignorant, just because I disagree with you doesn't mean I'm trump. Use your fucking brain
Jesus people, turn off the debate and go watch football or something if it's that bad.
I'll say this if Hilary and the Democratic parties would support clean coal and fossil fuel energy they'd win by a landslide

Time to go take a shower because I honestly feel so disgusting after watching that debate.
After watching the 2nd debate, I still think both candidates r full of shit. However, if I had to choose, it would b Hillary. #Debate
"She's a fighter. She doesn't give up."
I think that's what I'd call stamina, good sir @realDonaldTrump

Everyone talking mad shit about Trump supporters but I'd be more embarrassed to support Hillary ü§îüôÑ
@MMFlint @HillaryClinton is the presidential one!
One of the craziest things I saw during the #debate was someone using a disposable camera on stage after. #BackToTheFuture
@BeauRyan @Veronica @realDonaldTrump he typed it. It's kinda like 'it depends what the definition of is is". This is how liars think.
All these Hillary supporters want to USA to be second rate, but we're going to stay no.1 and kick ass. #trump2016 #maga

Trump kicked her fat ass. when asked to say niceties Hillary said kids then blasted him.  At least trump said nice things about her.
Btw Trump disagreed with his running mate on policy tonight! #debate

Trump did what he needed to tonight, which was sure up support with his army of conservatives, Hillary failed to capitalize tonight #debates
The biggest question I left this #debate with.. why is there a Washington University in St. Louis? Seems like that could get confusing.
Totally true - yet the debate gave answers to these questions without a word too @robinthede @gte
CNN post-debate barely touches Russia/Putin question/Syria all terrible for Trump who said 'I know nothing about Russia', dismissed hacking
@HillaryClinton #preparedtobepresident She looked presidential. @realDonaldTrump Would you put that guy in the oval office? Really? #debate
I'm so fucking sick of seeing ppl justify a vote for Trump or not voting w/the idea that "she's no better" UM HELLO: have u heard him SPEAK?
Who won the 2nd Presidential #Debate
Trump supporters will tweet about burns and memes while serious citizens tweet about issues... this debate isn't a joke it's our future.

@Justice_A I'm guessing so it wouldn't be up against the debate
Trump supporters r fact-averse, &amp; they know it. @GOP party loyalty over Truth. Gonna b your downfall, shitheads. @eileendefreest Retweet pls

Right off the bat they gave a Hillary-friendly question lol
"Donald Trump, I wouldn't touch you with a 39 and a half foot pole." - @HillaryClinton, probably.
I'm glad the first question is basically "do you think you're a good role model?" Because there is no way Donald Trump can say yes. #debate

1st question went to Hiliary Clinton, and she still didn't answer the question.
Is anyone subtitling #Hillary with her "private positions"? #debates
"I can't believe I'm saying this about myself, I am a politician." Yeah. We can't either. #Debate
Trump is stone-cold sober.
LOL. Is this whole thing going to be "I agree with everything she says?" #debates
Donald trump out there sweating.
"Well I actually agree with that, I agree with everything she said." --@realDonaldTrump's first words at the #debate2016 tonight.

Hilary Clinton just got on a soapbox instead of answering Patrice's question. Same for Trump. They have no idea what they are doing.
if you're in the audience at the #debate in #StLouis, please try your best to ask about wages and their consideration over #living #wage.
So "talking points talking points education is great" is the answer and Trump agrees. Fair enough. #debates

Trump says he‚Äôs so tired, and he sounds like it!
Trump under tremendous pressure looks stiff out of the gate.
What's up with Trump's gross hand?
I feel like they don't even answer the actual questions during these debates lol.
Trump isn't interacting with the audience member who asked the question. He's talking to the camera. #debate
Omg, they did it, they finally tranquilized Trump before the debate. Good strategy, GOP. #debate2016
Trump hasn't even answered the question. He's trying to give an overview of his campaign üòÇ

Now Clinton is giving Trump the opening to cut in with discussion about Bill Clinton's accusers. Let's see how it goes...
#debates
So far, it feels like this debate is going to be in history books. But unbelievable to watch it happening.
ru good role model-is audience ? &amp; #Trump responds by harping re ISIS bc he knows sexual predation &amp;vindictiveness deems him unfit #debates
Live video from Trump's comments on women at the #debate https://t.co/IFWBX638L9
#Debate 1- @realDonaldTrump como el perro arrepentido del chavo del 8.
Hillary preach! Trump has said some horrible things about people all away around. #debates
Tell me @realDonaldTrump what does ISIS&amp;protecting our borders have to do with ur rape culture rhetoric? Or should I say "locker room" talk?
Yaaasss Hillary. #readhim Debate over!
@HillaryClinton Facebook started by ranking women at @Harvard. @CNN is the Clinton News Network. #blackoutcnn #debate
Asked whether he understands that the video recorded him bragging about sexual assault, Trump said he wants to combat Isis.
Trumpf, this is not who we are!
@BillHemmer media theater. Coordinate with Clinton's machine
"This is not who WE are" - @HillaryClinton #debates
"This is not who we are." #Debate supposed to be.. but yeah
La force @HillaryClinton c'est de recarder la question et le d√©bat sans sourciller... #qcpolusa

Wow Donald trump rates women from 1-10. So does every other living straight man üòÇ
This ole turkey neck bastard #debate
What do you say about sexual assault #DonTheCon: Isis Blacks Latinos  #debates
Hillary is nailing this already.
We've seen @HillaryClinton idolize Margaret Sanger, bully rape victims, laugh about child molestation, etc. As a woman, that bothers me more
WTF is happening? Donald Trump's responses are incredibly awful. That's  who he is "thinking on his feet." What happens during a decision?
@twitter Bill's enabler is starting to shake her head again. #hillaryIsSick her eyes are twitching.
Mic drop. Can we just end this now? #debate
Hillary, gurrrl, I'm stress eating for you. Ice cream. All of it. #imwithher

Hillary just hit it
#Clinton se enfoca y se ensa√±a en lo dicho por #Trump en contra de las mujeres y que no es el indicado para la presidencia.
#debate #wilmerleondebates2016 Trina says he never groped women. Clinton says Trump has embarrassed women. America is great; we are good
.@KellyannePolls has failed yet again to inform Trump about the split screen. #scowlcentral #debate #fb
Jack the Ripper was brutally killing prostitutes. Should society then turn a blind eye because of who his victims were? #Debates #Vote2016
I love the quaver of barely contained rage in Hillary's voice. #Debate
@HillaryClinton i might disagree w/republican candidates but I never question their fitness to serve. @realDonaldTrump is different #debate
After the debate Hillary, will Bill be flying back to Pedophile Island with Jeffery Epstein.
Mediator : do you sexually assault women?
Trump : ISIS is bad.

"So, she's allowed to do that, but I'm not? Sounds fair." Did Trump just turn into Ted Cruz? #bigbaby #debate
This is undeniably biased against Trump. He keeps getting interrupted, but Hillary gets to say whatever she wants.
Oh lord, sit the shit the down, sir #debate
So this whole #debate is about the tape.
5 minutes into the second Presidential debate and Donald Trump is being crucified. #SECONDPRESIDENTIALDEBATE
Hey Hillary, where's your American flag?
Trump rambles on and on and on. Then gets mad when someone tries to cut him off.
Trump is starting to snort #Debates2016
It just words?!  #Debates
Why can't Trump answer the question He is asked! He is asked about his DISCUSTING comments about women and his answer is about ISIS
Already so pleased with the moderators, and we're hardly 15 minutes in #debate
I really hate trump lmao

Wow...I think Hillary just walked into a trap...
If Trump thinks he's going to repeat the same handful of talking points all night he is woefully mistaken.

Bill already served his 2 terms - he can't hold office again.  Why is he being mentioned? #Debate
@realDonaldTrump keeps saying he will help 'Hispanic Latinos." Who is this category of people?
#debate https://t.co/XR247E4H6R
And this is why Trump's talk is so scary and hurtful. Because many men think they can do what they want because they're men.
All The Donald can say "its locker room talk and I'm not proud of it" then deflect to things you've drummed up about Bill üôà #debate
I guess we know the answer to the "I hope I dont talk about it" in regards to @billclinton affairs and women problems #debate

Also, I'm pretty sure Mike Pence had Trump sedated before this.

Listening to Hillary Clinton speak about her record and her emails and everything else I swear I'm listening to Fractured fairy tales
On god, @realDonaldTrump raises my fucking blood pressure every time he speaks bigotry (any time he opens his foul mouth).
So @HillaryClinton can say it was a mistake and she'd never do t again, but @realDonaldTrump can't regret a comment from 11 years ago?

Hillary is unfit to be President. She risked our national security.

@HillaryClinton calls out #Trump demagoguery but effectively agrees we need to have Muslim Americans be a part of the solution.
#Hillary almost looks sad now - that she is meant to engage with this man seriously as an equal who could lead world's most powerful country
@AnnCoulter she will twist anything Trump said radical Muslims not Muslims HATE HER
quit rubbing your nose hillary and anderson stop interupting mr trump
Can't decide whether the #debate is more Smackdown or Raw.

Did Trump just throw his running mate under the bus? Outdone only by the ease with which he called Aleppo already gone and the US "stupid"
Este aspecto pudiera subir los bonos de @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/u1YwgqGrzf
Probably not a good move considering @GovPenceIN actually knows something about foreign policy, certainly more than @realDonaldTrump does
Trump talks himself into a corner, then tries to talk his way out of it. The answers to the questions are just so repetitive.
I think he just called all Americans stupid?!  #debate2016
Trump is INSANE yo.
Why can't there be less transparency in foreign policy?!? #debates

Bravo my queen. Keeping it classy with this last question. #debate his children may look like gremlins but they do love their asshole dad.

"This is not an ordinary time. This is not an ordinary election." --biggest understatement in history #Debates2016

Is this what couples counseling looks like? #Debate2016
Anyone else notice how Hillary went 10-15 to even 30 sec over the time limit before being cut off but Trump was cut off at exactly 2 min.
Gotta give Donald the point on that one. Though I'm not sure I could come up with something either. #debate
Only question he answered the entire debate
"The nicest thing about Hillary is that she just said something nice about me." -Trump
La pregunta, que le gusta de Trump, la respuesta sus hijos(as) @Susanadleon @elespectador https://t.co/edgsvehLDF
That was the best response @realDonaldTrump had all night! #Debate
HILLARY SAID "HIS CHILDREN" I LITERALLY KNEW SHE WAS GONNA SAY THAT LMAOOOOOO #debate
We should have started with that. #debate
@TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump if only you had an ounce of credibility I might believe you.
@lncandescents Hilary respects his kids and trump respects her stamina and never backing down
my parents used to make my brother and me say one nice thing to each other and hold hands when we were in timeout for fighting #debate
If you can vote and you vote for trump DIE.
Trump is the definition of a bully: from the way he stands over her, constantly interrupts, raises his voice. Revolting
It's so terrifying to actually think that Trump could become our next presidentüò≠
It's a broken record on this debate
"She's a fighter. Not a quitter. Never gives up." I agree!
Wow they actually said nice things about one another #debate
Good for you Trump, only nice thing I've ever heard you say!
"i respect... his children."

@PaolaFriedrick how can he condemn Hillary for using her clout as a public figure to make money in the private sector? He uses loopholes ...

This is the part of the #debate where Ashton Kutcher runs out and says we've all been PUNK'd.
This would never happen if two men were running against each other... my eyes doe #stopRolling #debate
Brave final question. #Debate
Trump on Clinton: "She doesn't quit. She doesn't give up, and I consider that to be a very good trait."
She doesn't quit.. you mean she's non stop?! #debate #Hamilton
In all honesty, I don't hate Hillary at all! She wouldn't be my first choice but she's definitely qualified and would do a good job #Debates

@__Marceloc_ @madiiisonxo I'm not talking about topics, you can visibly see that the moderators are harsher towards trump
In The Making of Donald Trump I quote Trump's own words showing ignorance on finance, nuclear weapons. Debate shows ignorance much worse.
If Trump can blame Clinton for everything because she was a senator, can we blame him for NBC canceling @CommunityTV? #debates
Wow, glad Hillary was able to get enough stamina in the last two weeks to now be a fighter who never gives up.

Trump just endorsed Clinton.
I think it was a tie. A red power tie. But also, the debate was tied.
Hillary sucks just saying
It's over!?!? I survived!?!? #debate
Anyone else relieved that the debate is over?
The best part about the debate has to be all the material @VeepHBO will have for its new season
Props to Donald for actually saying something genuinely nice about Hillary after calling her "the Devil" and a liar for the past 1 1/2 hours

Sounds like Trump just endorsed Hillary "she's a fighter."

p.s. I'm gonna be Ken Bone for Halloween.
