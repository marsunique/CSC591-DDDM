[How's that wall looking now, Donnie?]
[It's looking like he needs to get it up in less than 4 years and also deport all the other Latinos so they can't vote against him in 2020.]
[Hardly surprising. Different minority groups have different needs/wants obviously but when someone comes along threatening one minority, the others tend to get skittish as well. History has shown us that when people get done coming after one minority they tend to turn their target to another group.]
[Latinos are among the minorities who Trump has outright threatened.]
[He will lose every minority demo. I'd bet money on it. He will win white males most likely and will lose every other demo and certainly the minority demos.]
[Still too low considering the alternative.]
[I was gonna say, I really want to see it below 15 on election night]
[The taco bowl just got 10 more scoops of guac.]
[That's like an extra $20 worth at Chipotle!]
[This is what Trumpateers don't understand. Latinos don't have that disconnect to other latinos just because they came to the U.S illegally. Both legal and illegal latin families face the same struggles when trying to start their lives here. And when you call all latinos Mexicans, which is a complete disrespect of ones vastly different culture, it only unite us even more.]
[That should make Trump happy: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=N5A02pNcGHs]
[WHY ISNT SHE UP BY... oh.]
[Its simply not possible for Trump to win the presidency with these numbers.]
[This latino is voting for trump. He's the only rational candidate. I don't know why some Latinos get all up in arms about deportation. The legal ones will get to say. The illegal ones will be booted out, ultimately leading into wage increase for the jobs that are freed up. Law of supply and demand. Plus if you are here illegally u broke the law. Come back the right way next time, or improve your own country.]
[Lol - only rational candidate? The guy retweeting White Supramicist Propaganda? The guy who thinks ISIS can take over the US? The guy who loves Putin and says he won't invade places he already has? That guy?]
