Nobody was forcing his hand. The Attorney General, his superior, advised against it. He didn't even see the emails as I understand it. You have to ask yourself why this was done.
The AG, Loretta Lynch, who clearly uses her position for politics? You have to ask yourself why her opinion would matter for shit.
It starts with ONE thing I don't know why
American people deserve to know if the investigation is ongoing/reopened when we were told is was over/closed. American people can decide for themselves whether this development should have an effect on their vote. edit: Why am I getting downvoted for suggesting the American people deserve to know if a candidate is under current investigation by the FBI? Is /r/politics a HRC circle jerk forum?
Yes it is a HRC CJ.
(All I know) Time is a valuable thing Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
You know, the first one was cool.
The investigation was not reopened.
Right, they deserve to know it's not open. Which it's not.
I don't know what the official status is (open/closed/whatever), but it's a fact the investigation is ongoing/restarted, hence the letter. Why do you want to argue about semantics?
The official status is closed. And I don't want to argue. Really, just trying to make it clear it's closed.
Ok, so the FBI is further investigating into a "closed" matter.
According to the letter the level of 'investigation' is analogous to 'investigating' if a car on the side of the road was stolen by checking it's plates against a database. Only they can't even do this yet, because the fucking FBI is having trouble getting a judge to sign a warrant. It's a joke.
The Weiner case is open, though.
And? it's a separate case.
>"We don't ordinarily tell Congress about ongoing investigations, but here I feel an obligation to do so" Exact text from the letter. Sounds ongoing to me.
Into Weiner
Some people would argue we deserve to see a candidate's tax returns. So should the IRS just release all of Trump's tax returns?
Didn’t look out below Watch the time go right out the window Trying to hold on but didn’t even know
Actually... If we want to officiate the releasing of tax returns, they probably should. But I mean that's something that needs to go through Congress.
We also deserve to know if Trump is under investigation for ties to Russia. We know for a fact that his former campaign manager is under investigation. http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/19/politics/paul-manafort-donald-trump-ukraine/

You're getting downvoted because you're suggesting that the FBI break from protocol and influence the election for something that doesn't appear to be significant.
I wasted it all just to watch you go I kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when...
FBI would also be "influencing the election" if they kept their mouth shut and it turned out the e-mails on Weiner's computer led to criminal charges being brought against Hillary. When in doubt, err on the side of truth and let the chips falls where they may. American people can decide for themselves whether Comey's letter should change their vote.
>FBI would also be "influencing the election" if they kept their mouth shut No they would not. No one would pay attention to them in that case, and it would be like it didn't exist. >When in doubt, err on the side of truth and let the chips falls where they may. What truth? Comey hasn't even gotten a warrant for the emails. He has no idea what's in them. When he said "the emails might pertain to the Clinton emails", that was pure speculation on his part. >American people can decide for themselves whether Comey's letter should change their vote. Most people won't read Comey's letter. Some people will see "FBI Director reopens email investigation" and think "OMG SHE'S GUILTY". Even if just a few percent of the population does this, that could have major implications on the election. This would be extremely unfair to Hillary.
>When he said "the emails might pertain to the Clinton emails", that was pure speculation on his part. He said "Because those emails appear to be pertinent to our investigation..." We learned today that metadata shows there are e-mails that are to/from Clinton's private server on Weiner's computer. It was not speculation. >Some people will see "FBI Director reopens email investigation" and think "OMG SHE'S GUILTY". Even if just a few percent of the population does this, that could have major implications on the election. This would be extremely unfair to Hillary. That's true. Unfortunately many voters only look at the headlines and do not engage in critical thinking, which can help or hurt any candidate. I know a lot of people think Trump is a raping racist based on headlines. It goes both ways. Just because a portion of the electorate are sheep doesn't mean our government should "protect us" from the truth.
>We learned today that metadata shows there are e-mails that are to/from Clinton's private server on Weiner's computer. Once again, he does not have a warrant. Even if it does pertain to the Clinton investigation, it doesn't matter. Comey broke FBI protocol by releasing something that could influence the election. The FBI is supposed to go out of its way to keep potentially election-changing things quiet until the election is over. Comey broke from this. >Unfortunately many voters only look at the headlines and do not engage in critical thinking, which can help or hurt any candidate. Yes, but in this case, the headlines are directly because of something Comey did. That's the problem. >Just because a portion of the electorate are sheep doesn't mean our government should "protect us" from the truth. Actually, it does. Look up the Hatch Act.
This is so blatant, at least try.
He's either gone nuts, or someone saw evidence of obstruction of justice in the past few weeks.
They had someone on NPR who was saying that it was likely to protect the FBI (like the agency in general). If there were rumblings that something required further investigation and he didn't push for that investigation, it could mean pain for the agency down the road for showing favoritism to a political candidate. On the other hand, coming out with the letter would make him look bad/inept and might cause some short-term pain for the agency but not cause long-term harm. I'll try to find it, it was an interesting segment! edit: I can't find the exact one but [this](http://www.npr.org/2016/10/28/499796105/week-in-politics-fbi-reopens-case-into-hillary-clintons-emails) segment with EJ Dionne and David Brooks was a pretty good take on it all. edit 2: Aha, found it! [It was on Saturday](http://www.npr.org/2016/10/29/499867657/fbis-renewed-inquiry-into-clinton-email-case-comes-11-days-before-election-day). > SCOTT SIMON: So as you can discern it right now, Ron, why has the FBI shifted, you know, really decades of tradition now? > RON ELVING: We don't really know at this moment. But we do know that Director Comey has been under tremendous pressure ever since his announcement back in July. Republicans have been ripping him for not going further than his criticism of Secretary Clinton, which was quite strong, for her extreme carelessness. > And, you know, Donald Trump has been casting doubt on the legitimacy of the whole process. And here's the thing - the director might well have expected that if there is something being discussed internally at the FBI about these Weiner emails, whatever they are, that would become public at some point, whether he wanted that to happen or not. And he didn't want to appear to have suppressed them.
I wonder if they will now probe into Comey's communications and find out who had strong-armed him into releasing that letter. There was talk in a previous thread about Chaffetz and perhaps some other people who were basically telling him to release it or they would release it through back channels. It is obvious he did it as a rash decision because he felt his ass was on the line. I wonder how messy this could get.
It doesn’t even matter how hard you try Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme To explain in due time
wow whats with the downvotes
In the end it doesn't even matter
Reddit is not your personal shitposting playground, please go back to /pol/ with your dumb spam.
Reddit is literally everyone's shitposting playground lol
Chaffetz re-non-un-endorsed the day before the letter. My money is on him.
The fact that he was sooooooo outraged when he thought Trump was losing after the sex scandal stuff. And then Wednesday night he re-endorsed, the night before a big bombshell? And Comey claims he found out on Thursday. And Chaffetz is the one that leaked it. I wish we could find out the truth, but transparency is only for Clintons!
You know you dun goofed when Bush's ethic counsel of all people comes after you for being unethical.
Specifically - i googled this to contrast to the alleged Benghazi and email scandal - Scooter Libby who was indicted for betraying and outing CIA operatives then pardoned by Bush from over a year of jail time, AND making up evidence of WMD's to invade Iraq. No one wants to talk about Bush's presidency but that pardon was truly disgusting and one of the most unpatriotic things that a president has ever publicly pulled off.
That's unethical as far as actual morality is concerned, but there's no ethics rules governing Presidential pardons or commutations. In other words, you can't be fired from being President for breaching ethics protocols. You definitely can if you do that as FBI Director.
What about force feeding people through their buttholes? Is that an ethical gray zone as well?
Bush all so retroactively legalized illegal torture done by the CIA after it was discovered it was illegal.
He was not pardoned. His sentence was commuted. I know that's what you meant, just wanted it to be clear. A pardon has the effect of reversing a conviction; commuting a sentence does not.
He also wasn't the one who outed Plame- he just lied about it and obstructed. The one who outed her wasn't charged because he basically said he had thought it was common knowledge and didn't know she was a covert gent. Despite how everyone seems to think that all leaks of classified info get punished regardless of intent, we have direct evidence that this is not so from the prior administration. It's also one of the reasons Obama was much tougher about 'leaks'.
Libby is the classic case of a sacrificial lamb. It's easier to throw the Vice Presidents Chief of Staff to the wolves than the VP himself, the Deputy Secretary of State, and a respected national journalist working for the preeminent Washington paper. Do I believe Novak's side of the story? Not really. But trying to prosecute him would have made the entire journalism industry lock arms as one to protect their rights to use unnamed sources. It would have been a hellish fight that "at best" would have left him and WaPo standing while half the Bush administration was indicted.
So who are going to be the ones calling him on this shit? House oversight? Because that doesn't sound very promising.
Yeah our House Oversight committee seems like the most corrupt entity in government right now
Yes lets listen to the DOJ and Lynch about ethics. Just need to meet with Bill first to discuss Chelsea and certainly not Hillary's emails about Yoga. I'm over it, can we just get Bernie or Kaine take over.
time for comey's gold watch and goodbye banquet.
He might be Obama's most disappointing appointment
This is what Obama gets for appointing a Republican from the Bush Justice Department. I appreciate that Obama wants to look bipartisan but no one from that establishment should ever work in a leadership capacity again.
He didn't appoint him. He just didn't fire him.
He did appoint him, he started in 2013. However, it's worth pointing out that Obama had previously extended the tenure of his predecessor by two years as they were struggling to find a Senate confirmable replacement. Comey isn't so much who Obama wanted as who he got.
Oh. People make so much about Comey being Republican and Obama seemingly being ok with it. I see now it looks like same old GOP obstructionism.
the irony is that the penalty for Comeys Hatch Act violation is to lose his job which, wait for it, he was going to lose with either clinton or drumpf winning
what Hatch Act violation?
FBI director are appointed for ten years. They are not part of the executive cabinet that gets replaced. This is to help avoid the appointment being overly political.
The penalty is jail. And loss of his license. He can share a cell with Christie and Trump. A rollicking sweating threesome .
Wasn't Comey appointed for 10 year term in 2013? I wouldn't assume he was definitely going to be replaced.
Asked to resign
He can be removed by the President for adequate cause. An ethics violation and influencing an election is a pretty good reason.
Unfortunately it seems like he has to be as transparent as possible at this point. Probably can't even imagine what would happen if news broke that the FBI had obtained additional emails but didn't tell the oversight committee even after telling them he would let them know if anything changed in the closed case (much less after the election). The same people that praised his recommendation not to press charges are now hating him for this transparent announcement, the people over at T_D and republicans still hate him regardless. I feel for him at this point.
I don't think people are hating on him for being transparent. They're hating on him for releasing such a vague statement that states that the new emails may or may not have anything to do with the prior investigation. Comey knew that this would go public, and was advised by several people within the DOJ not to release a statement until after the election. With that, I think there's enough to build a case that Comey violated FBI/DOJ policy and directly influenced an election, and may have violated the Hatch Act. And while I admired Comey for standing up to members of his own party in not recommending charges against Clinton, his statements at the time were also beyond the norm for the FBI. But they were far enough away from Election Day that any effects they would've had on the polls would be minimized. In the end, Comey could have made a statement that explicitly said the new information does not change anything about our previous finding. We are simply investigating these new emails to determine if they contain any new pertinent information and will update the American people once we complete the further inquiry. But his statement was intentionally or carelessly vague and that has caused the problems we've been discussing for days. My belief is that polling will tighten but most people have made up their minds about the emails and this won't do much. But we'll see.
Probably he figured he had nothing to lose and made a deal with a Republican Congressman. They've probably already got some cushy consulting job set up for him somewhere.
Seems like this was perfect timing for Chaffetz who was getting A LOT of heat for re-endorsing Donald Trump for president after making a huge deal about how he couldn't because of his daughter
literally re-endorsed a day or two before. It's pretty reasonable to think he had a hand in this. Or at least someone was discussing the case with him before hand. Which itself is a pretty huge breach of ethics.
Well, Chaffetz was the one who tweeted that the FBI was reopening an investigation into her emails as soon as he got the letter from Comey. Hopefully he gets censured or something over this.
He re-endorsed before the letter was sent. It's worth investigating whether he was warned or privy to something about it beforehand. If Comey has violated the Hatch act, well there's your conspiracy to commit a crime right there.
I believe the Hatch Act applies to Executive Branch individuals. Chaffetz is simply a standard duplicitous POS Republican
Ah, but if he was pressing someone to break the law, that could spell trouble for him even if it was legal for him.
Yes, he re-endorsed the Wednesday night. It's quite damning.
Obama might fire him first on November 9. Presidents have the power, but it raises questions of impropriety, in this case especially. But Obama isn't under investigation, and lame ducks don't have to play politics. Once the election is done, it makes sense to clean up the mess.
Yes nothing screams fair and democratic like presidents firing FBI directors because their fellow party leader got investigated
If you want to pretend it's the investigation, and not his actions on Friday that prompted a group of nearly 100 former federal prosecutors and high-ranking DOJ officials from both Democratic and Republican administrations to sign a letter expressing serious concerns over his departure from long-standing department protocols, then go ahead.
It's not the investigation that would be getting Comey fired it would be possibly jiggering the election with his speculation - which due to his position of authority is really no bueno.
Or threatening to jail your political opponents.
*promising
> **Bush** *ethics counselor*

Comey's career is over and he's going to go down in history as Hoover 2.0
so what happened to all the people saying Comey is completely unbiased and everything done was a-ok and fair? truth be told i have no idea what's actually true and i wandered in here for the first time in a bit and now it seems like people are pissed at Comey because he might have significantly helped trump? and people were pissed when he seemed to significantly help clinton a ways back? all i remember is people wanted him strung up because it's clear Clinton deserved to have *some* negative thing happen, yet didn't. Now they want him gone completely because his timing with all of this shit is ridiculous and pretty damn clear he's helping specific people out? I was playing battlefield 1, wound up on reddit and got lost in r/politics :( it's cold and there are wolves after me
Personally, I was pissed when he said he wasn't pressing charges against Clinton, but still felt the need to share his opinions on her in the matter. Which I think many people were since it's not his job to do that. So I've been pissed at him for a while... but, that's just me.
Same. He should have said that there wasn't evidence of a crime and that they were not going to recommend charges period. Instead he felt the need to chastise her which was fully political and unethical for the director of the FBI to be doing. I was pissed about that. I'm even more pissed now when it's plainly obvious that he once again is playing politics when that isn't his business.
Do you people really not understand how funny this is? What's the average age on this sub? 15?
As opposed to /r/the_donald , the most mature sub on Reddit.
That sub is not trying to be. This sub thinks it's serious. lol.
Unfortunately for all of us, a lot of people take THAT sub seriously.
It's because THAT sub actually produces original content and ideas. THAT sub has had an actual effect on the election. Pepe got into national news and was on Hillary's own website ffs. Hilarious. THAT sub also takes Donald Trump very seriously as a candidate for reasons r/politics refuses to acknowledge out of stubbornness, ideological entrenchment, and and a strong confirmation bias. THIS sub however, parrots CNN and creates a toxic environment for anyone who doesn't think like the crowd. The Donald isn't pretending to be anything other than a 24hr/day Trump Rally. What's this sub supposed to be?
hhahahhahaha this is supposed to help?
The establishment's gonna establishment.
God damn the establishment and their pesky laws.
And how do we all feel about Lynch meeting with Bill Clinton, the spouse of someone who was under federal investigation at the time, in private? Did everyone collectively forget about this? Edit: lol god this sub has gone so down hill, anything remotely critiquing Clinton and her camp gets downvoted. I cant wait till this cluster fuck of a election is over.
That doesn't support the establishments narrative so it's irrelevant. Let's just forget it ever happened and never speak of it again.
Two wrongs don't make a right...
Oh, yeah, you're right - that's just as bad. /s *rolling eyes*
How is the AG, the person who would be the one to push forward with indictment or not, meeting with the husband of the subject HER INVESTIGATING BODY IS LOOKING AT FOR CRIMINAL MISCONDUCT not bad, like at all? The ONLY reason its even known is that it got leaked. Neither Clinton nor Lynch would have come out and even mentioned it had it not been leaked. For christs sake it is what started this circus with Comey in the first place. That meeting singled handedly called the Doj and the FBIs integrity into question, she literally has to say "fine what ever they recommend ill do it no questions asked", and it was because of her Comey had to do that press conference because he needed to be as transparent as possible to ensure that the people not lose faith in the justice system because of what Lynch did.
So you're saying it's a closed matter and unrelated to Comey's new breach in policy.
Improper, but not electioneering. In the end, she didn't even make the decision not to prosecute Clinton. That was Comey.
There's just so many things going on here. Some former republican Bush attorney is complaining about the FBI's actions now that they are following the law; as opposed to before when they weren't complying with proper procedure? Shocking. It's almost as if the Bush Family is using Hillary like a sock puppet. I think if the democrats know what's good for them they'll tag in Bernie and make him their nominee.
They didn't complain when he let the crooked bitch off the hook a few months ago... now the complaint comes. Don't worry, I wouldn't trust Comey to do the right thing anyway. He's already proven he's incapable of applying the law fairly, by not charging Hillary Clinton with the illegal possession of classified information outside Government systems. Something that 'regular folk' would (and DO) get charged with if they did the same.
>bitch This election is a circus without stooping this low.
I knew this guy once. Stand up guy. Always doing the right thing. Told everyone I talked to that he was great. Just great. Then I found out he robs convenient stores. But I couldn't tell everyone that actually he was a bad person because I used to say something different.
> 'regular folk' would (and DO) get charged with if they did the same. Please cite the cases where the regular folk got charged despite having the same lack of criminal intent Clinton was found to have.
The guy in the Bush administration who revealed Place's CIA identity didn't get charged because he claimed he thought it was common knowledge and that he thought she wasn't covert. (People think that's what Libby was charged with, but it's not. He was charged with perjury and obstruction). So, we have a key example of someone revealing classified info and not getting charged based on intent from the prior administration.
So, the exact opposite of what the user above me claimed.
This argument makes no sense. At no relevant period of time has Hillary been a "normal person", so it's not like it is valid in any way. Then, you're free to show us the evidence and how applied to laws it is illegal. On this part, I have a feeling you're blowing hot air.
We didn't complain when he chose not to prosecute because we felt like it was the right call. We're complaining now because his behavior warrants it. Not everything is black and white, and no one is obligated to think that everything Comey does is right based on agreeing with him one time. I don't understand why Trump supporters are even trying to use this as a taking point except that they're desperate enough to try anything.
This sentence from an easily debunked email FWD:FWD:FWD from Grandma perfectly shows the thinking of the typical Republican voter >I tried to check this out, but was not successful. Therefore, it's unproven. However, I have little doubt it happened!
I know people who *still* don't believe Obama was born in America. It's really sad.
>They didn't complain when he let the crooked bitch off the hook a few months ago... now the complaint comes. Are you shitting me? Everyone complained because Comey went off the reservation to give a literally unprecedented press conference bashing the subject of the investigation. He's been politicizing this shit for months
So our **Commander In Chief** can publicly campaign for Clinton while bashing Trump and this doesn't influence the election process but Comey's letter is a Hatch Act violation? **WHAT** **THE** **ACTUAL** **FU(K** **?**
Are you new to politics? You seem unaware that a President is *expected* to support his party politically, because he is the head politician for that party. Civil servants, who are not politicians, are expected to do their jobs without overtly interfering with the political process.
