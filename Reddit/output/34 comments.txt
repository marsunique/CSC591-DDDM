She'll also pay federal employees in cocaine and unicorns.
Where do I can apply?
Seems like you've had enough coke already.
I gotta get a federal job
>650 million people in one week From a logistical standpoint, I'm just amazed that Hillary Clinton is able to do something so staggering. Putting this together with Hillary's ability to bring together a dozen or more nations and military groups to do a strike on Mosul specifically timed to assist her with the election, I think it's clear what the American people should be doing this year. I mean, at this point the presidency is really just a formality for her, so we might as well just put her in office, right?
Don't forget that she's doing all this while on her deathbed
She inoculated herself with pneumonia just to give Trump a fighting chance and make it interesting!
Not to mention that despite being the most corrupt person of all time she has managed to evade any criminal wrongdoing for 3 decades. If she's that good, imagine what she would do for the country.
"If she is that good" -dont you mean if she is that *EVIL*? Just imagine what she could do...jesus.
Regardless of whom you side with, that's a nutso number. That's double our population. Dumb.
So how many people does Clinton want to let in?
It's literally 65,000 refugees and 1,000,000 immigrants that come to the US every year.
Hey, just to make sure youre a person and not a bot is it possible for you to comment a curse word: "fuck" or "shit" will work
I fucking hope this shit proves to you I am a real person.
Perfect! Thanks, it was just a quick experiment
Significantly fewer than the entire population of South America
So just a couple million
Yeah... *650 million!* Oh wait, no. That number is complete and total BS that no reasonable person would ever put forth unless they thought their audience was *extremely* stupid or they were themselves.

If I'm a sophisticated enough bot to generate that comment, does it really matter?
Just humor me. Im asking politely
Response not found.
No bot, no bot. You're the bot.
It's almost 10% of the world population. It's insane.
Is a stupid assertion, don't get me wrong, but China has more than 1 billion people and is about the same size as the US (+Alaska), it is definitely possible. Now, is stupid to think that we would see a human migration like we've never seen before in a single week
wew lad, no it is not remotely possible.
"it is definitely possible." No it fucking isn't. Jesus Christ.
I think he meant it's physically possible to fit ~1billion people in the United States, not that all 650 million could arrive in a week.
It's physically impossible. What an idiotic claim. Par for the course with Trump.
It is logistically and physically absolutely impossible to transfer so many people in such a short amount of time.
That's over 3.8 million people per hour every hour 24/7. Assuming we started at 12:01 AM Sunday morning, we would have emptied Mexico a little after 7 AM Monday. The rest of central America would be empty around 6 PM Monday night. Brazil would fall around 9 PM Wednesday night. The rest of South America would be empty early Saturday morning, and we would have to start looking at Canada as the only other country left in the Western hemisphere. Canada would be empty by mid-afternoon Saturday, and we'd have to ferry people across the Atlantic and Pacific to get the last 30 million or so people.
That's 1,055 people per second. She would be bringing in [3 times the population of the Middle East](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_the_Middle_East) in a week.
That is physically impossible. No immigration system in any country has the tools available to accept 650 million people into a country in one week.
The world's rotation would actually be affected by the movement of these migrants.
No *transportation* system has that capacity!
That would probably solve the Social Security problem tbh
This doesn't make any sense. Definitely a Trump quote.
Anyone else think that trump is doing the same thing with this number as his net worth. Hillary wants to let in 50,000 refuges and trump claims she wants to let in 650 million in a week. Trump claims he is worth $10 billion so…
What a fucking idiot. How ignorant do you have to be to believe this bullshit? Anybody who believes in this orangutan should have their head examined.
This my friends is our republican candidate. FOL
So in a little more than 11 weeks the entire population of Earth would be in the USA. This might just be Dumpster Don's dumbest declaration to date.
So according to [Wolfram Alpha](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=\(7.5+billion+people\)*\(1+week\)%2F\(650+million+People\)), estimating the population to be around 7.5 billion people, this would mean that the entire population of the world would move into the U.S. in 11.54 weeks, or 2.655 months. That's insane.
Well I mean you could have every person in every country south of the US cross into here and she still would be 58 million people short of her "goal".
What about us Canadians? There's 30M of us! What are we, chopped liver, topped with gravy and cheese curds.? (It snowed yesterday. I'm cold. Hold me?)
Well on one hand you could immigrate to escape the snow, but then you'll have to deal with Clinton's mandatory sex-change plans.
Wait, I thought it was mandatory abortions??
Well, at least after three months we'd rule most of the known Human population!
Bad at science, bad at math
That's ... insane. That's all of Mexico (122 M) + everybody in all of Central America (46 M) + Canada (35 M) because why not - BUT WAIT' we're still just at 203 M!!! Lets bring every single person in all of South America (422 M) in this joy ride - and we're pretty much there (625). Just let in every single syrian (22M) and were *there* Donny boy! You've made it! Every single person south of the Rio Grande has to move in, and all Canadians as well, and we might as well add the few thousand greenlanders and St-Pierre-et-Miquelonnais for good meaure for this demagogic simpletons view to pass. And he'd still be short 22 M...
Thank God there will be a taco truck on every corner to feed them.
The article scoffs at Trump's reference to Clinton's open border policy. She said that her ideal is an open border policy. Look. Conservatives want people to emigrate here. They should do it legally. That's the point. Why this is an issue against Conservatives, I'll never know. Anyway.
Trump was for open borders in 2013 he found flopped on it to get votes from Republican rubes.
I mean, show me proof that he was for open borders in 2013, and I'll tell you he's changed his tune. Am I now supposed to vote Hillary Clinton?
http://edition.cnn.com/2013/01/22/business/opinion-donald-trump-europe/
Open border policy would be a good thing in the future. Not like the close future, but far into the future. And either way, Trump himself wrote about how he wanted open borders in 2013. So who knows what anyone stands for anymore.
I don't think open borders is such a terrible idea. People think Mexicans and Chinese would just flood the US, but I doubt so. There you have Europe, with open borders, and still, we haven't seen the whole population of poor countries emigrate to rich countries.
She doesn't want open borders. You're either stupid or lying.
>"In a private, paid speech to a Brazilian bank on May 16, 2013, Clinton said: “My dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders, some time in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it, powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere.” I mean, help me out.
> hemispheric common market hemispheric common market hemispheric common market hemispheric common market hemispheric common market hemispheric common market hemispheric common market (for trade and energy trade) hemispheric common market hemispheric common market
Talking about trade and energy trade specifically. Try to understand context. Try not being such an intentional sucker for conspiratard idiocy.
https://youtu.be/xvuoh7WGvtc
Welp. You tried.
Open borders was a reference to energy and to a lesser extent trade. It had nothing to do with people. Also, that number is just idiotic.
Forgive me, I thought this was an issue on illegal immigration; a certain and able, fixable issue, by law. Energy tariffs. Import, export. Taxes on such. That's another thing.
> The article scoffs at Trump's reference to Clinton's open border policy. She said that her ideal is an open border policy. > http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2016/jun/23/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-hillary-clinton-would-create-tot/ > Trump said Clinton’s immigration platform would "create totally open borders." > This is a huge distortion of Clinton’s proposals. > We rate this claim False.
The article is bunk, dude or dudette; sloppy and without credit. How do you secure a nation without documentation? How is it possible to have sovereign borders? Am I all of sudden a Nazi? I'm very defensive on behalf of a controlled border. From the article: >However, some experts argue that "open borders" doesn't necessarily mean no enforcement at all but making it far easier for undocumented immigrants to stay here. Clinton does want to make it easier for many undocumented immigrants, but that’s not the same as getting rid of enforcement Explain this sloppy article! ^^
Isn't politifact owned by a newspaper in Florida that has endorsed and donated to Hillary?
Six papers in the entire country have endorsed Trump. Are they the only ones who can report on politics now?
You've swallowed that propaganda. She said she wants open borders with respect to energy trade, not letting everyone into the country. Trump is deliberately misquoting her. She corrected him in the debate and people still believe his bullshit just because he repeats it.
> Trump is deliberately misquoting her. It's worse than that. He's deliberately misquoting her by taking a quote that was obtained through Russian espionage, and then distorting its context.
But according to the breitbart Trump GOP, The NYT is a questionable source, while Russian gov hackers are 100% reliable.
