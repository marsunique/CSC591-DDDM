[It's amazing how for a party that claims to love democracy, the GOP does everything in its power to limit voting times, polling places, problem resolution methods, registration mechanisms, etc, etc. Shouldn't you want every eligible voter to vote? Isn't that a goal of democracy? Why then shut down polling places, eliminate early voting, etc, etc?]
[And half the country supports these clowns]
[Clearly not, or they wouldnt stop people voting.]
[North Carolina actually researched how to make it harder for minorities to vote. That is what is the most upsetting for me; they don't even try to hide it. >The federal court in Richmond found that the primary purpose of North Carolina's wasn't to stop voter fraud, but rather to disenfranchise minority voters. The judges found that the provisions "target African Americans with almost surgical precision." >In particular, the court found that North Carolina lawmakers requested data on racial differences in voting behaviors in the state. "This data showed that African Americans disproportionately lacked the most common kind of photo ID, those issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV)," the judges wrote. >So the legislators made it so that the only acceptable forms of voter identification were the ones disproportionately used by white people. "With race data in hand, the legislature amended the bill to exclude many of the alternative photo IDs used by African Americans," the judges wrote. "The bill retained only the kinds of IDs that white North Carolinians were more likely to possess." https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/news/wonk/wp/2016/07/29/the-smoking-gun-proving-north-carolina-republicans-tried-to-disenfranchise-black-voters/?client=safari]
[[Good John Oliver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUomc6pEHnc)]
[Wow thats kindergarten grade subterfuge. They could at least try to hide it.]
[And all of the assholes who passed that law will be re-elected.]
[The GOP only loves democracy for white people. They know brown people can't be trusted to vote the "right" way.]
[And now it's becoming white males apparently.]
[They're just historical preferentialists. /s]
[The GOP only believes in democracy for a few, not the many.]
[Why? High voter turn out is devastating to republicans.]
[Kind of sums it up, its terrifying that people like this exist https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GBAsFwPglw]
[Oh, I know. It was a rhetorical question.]
[It shouldn't even be a victory for Democrats, its just a matter of letting people use their constitutional right to a vote without making them walk through a fucking minefield of arbitrary and constantly mutating conditions and caveats. Good on the judge for doing the right thing. There have been several positive developments on this front in recent weeks and it's great to see.]
[Exactly what I was going to say. Stop calling 'letting the people vote' a victory for democrats.]
[I mean, it literally was a victory for them, in the sense that they were the ones who brought the suit.]
[> It shouldn't even be a victory for Democrats It shouldn't, but it very unambiguously is. Only one Party fights to make it easier for Americans to vote. This was a defeat for the Republican Party and a victory for Democrats. Whenever the Republican Party decides to join us and fight for the right to vote, the victories can be shared across the aisle.]
[I agree. I meant it's a sad state of affairs that it has to be a one sided fight with a line drawn between parties at all. It shouldn't even be that way. I won't shy from calling it what it is, a win for Democrats, but I would rather see people of all stripes just locking their arms and saying this is bullshit. Until that happens I'm glad the needle seems to be moving in the right direction with these recent cases.]
[Good, this was some bullshit. Say you're 16, you just get your driver's license. Florida lets you pre-register to vote at 16, so you do so at the DMV. The signature that goes on file is the one you make there, signed on one of those electronic pads like the credit card scanner at the grocery store. Now you're 21, it's your first presidential election, you're off at school, so you ask for an absentee ballot. What are the chances that a) you still have the same signature as you did at 16, and b) that you'd sign it the same on that pad as you do on paper, anyway? Chances are good you don't even realize that your signature's going to be compared against that one you made back at 16. You sign it, send it off, and assume your vote was counted. Well, if it didn't, there's no obligation for the county to tell you it didn't match, and even if they do, before this ruling, you wouldn't be able to fix it. Worse is that the people making the call on if your signature matches don't go through any particular training on whether signatures match, it's a judgment call by the county board. That ends up leaving different counties with different levels of strictness - Leon County (Tallahassee/FSU) rejected less than 0.1% of ballots for bad signatures, Alachua County (Gainesville/UF) rejected more than 1%. I was hanging out with a friend a few years ago, telling him about a paper I was writing on this subject, and he was a regular absentee voter. I looked him up in the system, and sure enough - 2012, rejected absentee ballot. He had had no idea, and he was pissed. This court decision would have let him prove his identity and have his vote counted.]
[Wait, Florida allows you to pre-register (I'm on other side of the country). So, like all of your info is just in a system for two years static? No sir, don't see a problem with that at all /s]
[Wait, I don't get it. What's the problem?]
[I cant trust the govment not to arrest me or profile me by having information on me. Despite the DMV having his address, photo and all this information on file already since you had to put it there to drive a car. Eerrr freeeeedumb or something. Am i doing this right guys?]
[> I looked him up in the system What system? You can look to see if people voted?]
[I can relate to this. The signature on my social security card is laughably "6th-grade cursive". My signature now is more akin to a squiggle.]
[Dude I can't even guarantee my signature tomorrow will be the same as it was yesterday.]
[Yeah, it's completely fucked in the head. My signature doesn't resemble anything close to what it was a few years ago. Signatures really undergo an evolution of sorts, just like language does. Creating a series of freehand penstrokes many thousands of times over an indefinite period, of course it's going to change on its own. Or maybe you just think your signature sucks and make a deliberate choice to start using a new one. And again, as is oftentimes the case there's an argument to be made that this canvassing board rule had a disproportionate effect on young voters who may not sign their names as frequently as older voters -- paper checks, handwritten letters, etc. -- or who simply haven't been writing their names for several decades like their elders. Fucking dumbass rule, glad to see this garbage thrown out. It needs to happen more. Rotten what occurred in your friend's case.]
[Yeah, I used to tell people to not vote absentee for convenience, only if they had absolutely had to. In-person early voting doesn't have these problems - if your signature gets rejected, you can sort it out at the voting site and still get your vote counted. At least now it's less of a concern.]
[I'm a Florida citizen. I voted by mail between 2012-15. I have awful handwriting and my signature is inconsistent at best. The idea that my vote was thrown out for that is appalling.]
[Your vote is a matter of public record in FL. (The fact that you voted, not for whom you voted.) You can find out on the internet if your ballot was accepted. A simple Google search should find it. Your signature must match what's on file. God only knows which form is the reference signature. The solution in my opinion, is to do in-person early voting. It starts next week in most counties and runs through the Saturday before the election. Lines are usually short and you can be sure your ballot is counted.]
[This is absurd. We need to pass a federal elections act and make this blatent disenfranchisement punishable by prison time.]
[We had one. Guess which President took it away.]
[And again, the gop is sure there's voter fraud on the democrats side because they are doing voter fraud on *their* side and can't imagine someone else not also cheating]
[Plenty of obscenity to go around this year. Most of it orange colored.]
[Not as bad as the bullshit North Carolina pulled. So far they are the worst I think]
[More vote rigging by the damn riggers.]
[Are you saying democrats are rigging the system with this ruling?]
[All they were doing was trying to stop the filthy riggers from voting. Like my Daddy always told me, 'the only good rigger is a disenfranchised rigger']
[George Soros controls 16 states voting machines]
[Does he also control the services that conduct pre-election and exit polls?]
