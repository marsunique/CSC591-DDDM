> Look, I think Comey should have said prosecute her back in July. But what he just did 11 days b4 the election is wrong & unfair to Hillary. This guy - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Walsh_(Illinois_politician)#Controversial_statements - recognizes that Comey's letter is dangerous and ill-advised and HRC is being treated unfairly. *That guy!* Kudos to him for saying so while knowing it will piss off many of his fans and, thereby, potential hurt his bottom line as a right-wing radio host.
[MFW Joe Walsh is the voice of reason](http://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2016_27/1610446/160707-comey-cr1147_02_f080a4b12d0f012f3fe7689ba9a9cbbe.nbcnews-fp-360-360.jpg)
really expected the head exploding guy there
the funny thing, there is no doubt he royally screwed up. how so, well using his own words: "I don’t want to create a misleading impression" and then proceeds to do just that, whatever the claims, by his own admission he utterly failed in his objective and that is 100% pure incompetence. The man should resign for that single fact, this is no minor mistake, this is literally world shaping stuff he's getting into.
Anybody who causes this much chaos in an American election is not much use as a public servant. He's probably making a great big salary too. He should just go. Let Hillary appoint somebody else.
Well, life has been good to him so far...
Lucky he's sane after all he's been through.
His Maserati goes 185...but he lost license, so now he can't drive.
True that. Everybody's so different, he hasn't changed.
I hear that he lives in hotels, and tears out the walls.
That's just living a life of illusion
It's hard to leave when you can't find the door.
You have to somewhere out on the horizon
He has accountants to pay for it all. Fatcat politicians tsk
I guess he really wanted to grab his musket.
This is Mr. I'm Going to Grab my Musket if Trump doesn't win. Are we through the looking glass yet? http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/politics/ct-former-congressman-walsh-musket-tweet-20161027-story.html
and Ted Nugent shit himself when he heard....
The best people are thinking the same. Meanwhile, /r/The_Derps are measuring the drapes.
No one gives a fuck what loser Joe Walsh thinks
actually, as someone from illinois, i like to have him still around to give credibility to what "the deplorables" really do think. and the fact that he was elected to congress and then immediately replaced by a female veteran with no fucking legs says a lot about what is wrong and right with this country.
Do we care what this guy thinks now?
Just op.
This is nonsense. Comey was in a no win situation. If he waited 11 days and allowed the election to go before announcing this, the Republicans would have called BS. And probably rightfully so. He did the best decision I think available. He immediately informed congress and went and got a warrant so he could look at them. Lets look at the history of the rhetoric towards Comey: - He is investigating Clinton. Democrats call bullshit, Republicans call him noble. - He clears Clinton of illegal activity (not wrong doing), Democrats praise his decision, Republicans condemn him as being bough off. - He finds more information concerning the server. Democrats call poo poo and Republics collectively orgasm. Yes, he did this before the election, because the information reached his office before the election. The nature of the universe is shit ain't convenient and life frequently sucks. Deal with it. To avoid this in the future, maybe Democrats shouldn't nominate a person who setup a private email server and forwarded sensitive government emails to it. You know who probably didn't do nonsense like this? Joe Biden. Elizabeth Warren. Martin O'Malley. Bernie Sanders. Cory Booker. Try running a real primary next time, and not relying on an independent to step in to actually primary your chosen one.
Informed Congress about 'what'? he didn't know anything beyond that they got more emails. Literally. That's the total extent of what he knew when he sent that incendiary letter to the GOP. They just got the warrant to read the emails TODAY. Fuck Comey.
It's been explained that part of the process, to protect his own ass, is to inform congress that his testimony is no longer valid as new information has come forward. > They just got the warrant to read the emails TODAY. It takes time to get a warrant.
Further, it's not even his job to talk to Congress. That's the DOJ's job. So again, sincerely, Comey can go fuck himself.
> Further, it's not even his job to talk to Congress. But it is his job to cover his own ass. Essentially his testimony was now false and he needed to amend it. Outside the partisan world people live in, lying to congress, just like in a court, is illegal. And now he doesn't have to worry about someone trying to claim he did exactly that. Transparency has it's benefits when you do things correctly. Typical Republicans and Democrats should try it sometimes.
Bullshit. I forget if it was Jeanine Pirro or Richard Painter (there have been sooo many republicans calling out a Comey that I can't it all straight), but Comey should have had the ranking member from both parties on the congressional committee he needed to keep appraised meet with him in private, and tell them the situation, with the threat that if it was leaked, he would know it was one of them. Sending out that letter was pure political theater, that will end with his termination by the lame duck president after the election.
> Comey was in a no win situation. With the news that he was [specifically told not to do this](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/30/us/politics/comey-clinton-email-justice.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=first-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news) I don't see how you could argue he was in a no win because Republicans would call BS. If they did, he could show how he was advised against saying anything. That provided all the potential cover he'd require (in the event that the info arose after the election and people blamed him for not issuing a statement). Also, even if he did have to send a letter (he didn't), it still doesn't explain why the one he sent is nebulous, unhelpful, provides no information or context, and is overall horrible. Someone on twitter provided a slightly better version of his letter, which you can read, here: http://i.imgur.com/C3sWBiB.jpg
> With the news that he was specifically told not to do this I don't see how you could argue he was in a no win because Republicans would call BS. You have to keep in mind that there will be a lot of information coming forward with political spin and biased behind it. I also heard reports saying that he specifically needed to do this, to protect his own ass as he gets a warrant. Also a valid reason if you ask me.
Walsh is the perfect example. Always spinning for Hillary.
I don't care if Walsh is a great singer, he's still a nut.
