[If you are driven to threats of violence and death against another person because their ideas are different than yours, congratulations – you're ISIS.]
[So... You're for Trump then? No? I'm sorry, your statement is very ambiguous. All I know is that Hillary supports Saudi Arabia/Qatar, who supports ISIS.]
[America supports Saudi Arabia. If Trump were to get into office, that ain't changing my friend.]
[Since Trump is the one who has financial interests in Sauidi Arabia, he must literally be financing ISIS, then.]
[If you invite isis here, your hilary.]
[Didn't some people literally firebomb a Trump organizing office a day or two ago? Congratulations. You've equated threats of violence with actual violence, and called the lesser of the two isis. What does that make the great? Nazis?]
[If you are driven to threats of violence and death against another person because their ideas are different than yours, congratulations – you're a liberal. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutions_of_1848 Your freedoms are built upon the bloodied corpses of those who fought against tyranny. Don't act like violence is always evil.]
[Or your Thomas Jefferson]
[But John Adams and Thomas Jefferson end up friends by the end. They never tried to mill each other]
[The point is that *everyone* has the propensity to be just like ISIS, if they hold an ideal so high that they are willing to kill or be killed for it.]
[Fun fact: they both died the same day. July 4, 1826.]
[*My* Thomas Jefferson? What about yours?!]
[My Thomas Jefferson is in mint condition, *thank you very much*.]
[Thomas Jefferson held differing opinions with all kinds of people, and he didn't run around threatening to kill them.]
[The name I used was arbitrary. The point that I was attempting to make should've been made in another way. I apologize for the misunderstanding.]
[If you firebomb your oppositions HQ, you're ISIS.]
[No, you're not. ISIS beheads and kills people, bombing buildings with no casualties doesn't interest them. By equating the two you're just showing how sheltered and simple minded you are.]
[rofl, read the comment I was replying to, champ.]
[You are first assuming this was the work of a Democrat which is still to be determined. All the evidence I have seen from the 3 instead of E that goes back to RONPAULR3VOLUTION, the spelling out Republicans, the using a Swastika but not crossing it out, the attempt knowing the office would be closed in the early afternoon, the phrasing of the threat that sounds like the KKK telling people to get out of town, is a false flag attempt to me. And fire bombing an empty office telling them they are Nazis and to leave is not the same as calling in death threats to a newspaper because they endorsed Hillary. But conservatives just have to play the victim and always equate an action they can pin on the other side.]
[...Don't be that guy. We don't know who did it. But going on about it being a false flag attempt just makes you sound like Alex Jones. Could it have been? Maybe. But odds are it wasn't. Because assholes exist on both sides.]
[> bombing buildings with no casualties doesn't interest them I dunno, it seems like they do that pretty frequently when there's symbolic value, like with ancient historical sites.]
[Agreed, there is no place for that in civilized society]
[/r/politics seems to disagree, shocker.]
[Where in the world do you get that idea?]
[I agree. Fuck whatever person who did that. I'm happy to see that Dems setup a GoFundMe to help pay for it that raised over $13k because we abhor that type of behavior.]
[I won't be driven to violence because people have differing opinions, I'll be driven to violence because a select group of people keep threatening my family.]
[Who is threatening your family?]
[Local deplorables. Upstate NY has a healthy population of yee-hawdists.]
[The whole point about this election is that nobody sees it as two candidates differing only by the contents of a platform. To suggest that this is merely about differences in ideas is to miss a big part of this.]
[Yeah, we've had thirty years of republicans trying to paint Hillary as literally Satan. Now we know who the weak-minded fools are that are willing to buy any line the republican party sells them.]
[Pretty much all conflict is driven by ideas, though. This election is focused on individual and moral ideas rather than policy.]
[its naionalism versus xenophobia]
[Do you mean conflict in general or in the context of American elections?]
[I mean in general. Barring natural conflict such as disease or natural disaster, I think that most conflict arises from a clash in ideas or ideologies. If not on an individual level, then at a group level for sure.]
[While many conflicts may *look* ideological, at the root of it most conflicts have far deeper causes. The bigger question is 'where does the given ideology come from' and 'what conditions enable this ideology rather than a different one to take root', because I don't think that just all ways of thinking are just interchangeable with each other in a given circumstance. Mostly I'd say that the give ideology that is most dominate in a society is whatever ideology best justifies the that societies structure, and the structure arises from material things like the technology that exists the geography, the presence or absence of other competing groups and most importantly, any given societies history. If the ideology *doesn't justify the social order, then the society would fall apart, and since generally people are more inclined to be in a society rather than not, thats just generally how it works out. Consider a kingdom in the middle ages. The most important values are things like honor, loyalty, deference to superiors and religiousness, all of which are necessary for a feudal system to exist. I'm not saying that that new thought in politics or whatever can't influence social organization but I think that new thought will only catch on and have an effect in motivating change if and only if the current set of the society and the powers that be are such that such a change is possible. Obviously, we can't jump to social organization that are just not possible materially, or don't address the issues that people have with the way they are currently living. Another example would be like; Why are the democrats and republicans different? At first you might say they represent two different ideologies or at least set of ideas about what is best for how society runs, and a person will pick a party based on if they think this idea is better or that idea is better. But the ideas themselves, where are they from? One might say they both derive from a political philosophy and the writing of a thinker or another, but I don't that is really the case. First, in order for a candidate to be elected, they need money to run a campaign, and often *a lot* of money. If you don't have money yourself and don't have backing from somewhere, you won't be elected. Sure a Sanders or something comes along every once in a while but generally that is the case. So to get big backing you need to be supporting something that is wanted by people with lots of money. At some level, nearly all politicians then have to be supporting something that rich people like, and the more stuff they support the more money they get and the better able they are to be elected. Now the mistake many people make is to think that *all* rich people somehow want the same thing, or are working together in some 'men with cigars in a dark room' conspiracy, which is absurd. There aren't many things that are good for *all* capitalists, not all business benefit from law changes and often some will benefit at the expense of others. Capitalists themselves are in conflict with each other and the natural result over time has been that capitalists broadly have coalesced into two sides, converging on a set of policy goals that will benefit their interests, as a result of being able to back candidates that support their views, and can also sell them to some section of the larger public, mostly by way of cultural/social issues. And like that, that's how we get the particulars of the two parties positions, a slow process necessitated by the need for candidates to be funded and people with lots of money being the only ones that can provide funding. Ideology itself plays no real role, just pragmatic, material concerns. People engage in the system by voting because that in part of the values system that is generated by the ideology that justifies the whole thing, the idea of natural rights. But also the fact that half of americans *don't* vote is a pretty clear indication that on some level most people actually don't think that it makes an important enough difference.]
[That's probably the exact opposite of what actually happens. Ideologies are formed to support material differences. Especially when considering the actions of groups, which are not rational entities but whose constituents tend to act in generally the same way due to having the same material motivations.]
[I don't see how this refutes my statement, though. I realize it all boils down to motivation. Motivation supports ideologies, which drives conflict. At the very least, ideologies can perpetuate conflict. Regardless, I certainly think this election is concerned with ideas.]
[I suppose it would take a very long time to explain what I'm talking about. I'm not even sure how I'd do it, actually. I think an exception can be made over arguments about culture. One's culture being destroyed, as is happening to Republicans right now, is difficult to classify as either material or ideological. Pretty much everything else can be traced back to material conflict, and the ideological squabbles arise from the culture that grows to support the material circumstances. Maybe not as convincing as I could be. I'll think about it some more.]
[I suspect that we are in more agreement than we think, it's just neither of us can articulate it at the moment.]
[Well, I will say this about Hillary, she's trying to run on the issues. Trump, well.... He's *the best* and has *the best* policies. What those policies are, I have no idea, but apparently they're *the best*.]
[She's running on an anti-Trump platform just as much as Trump's platform is anti-Clinton, and so are her surrogates. It's a disgrace to the issues Sanders focused his campaign on.]
[That's not exactly true. She's not releasing ads about her positions, but her positions have been well documented throughout the campaign.]
[Build The wall. Deport people who are here illegally and break our laws. Make better trade deals, no TPP. Bomb the shit out of ISIS. Stop giving money to States in the middle East who support terrorism (like Saudi Arabia, one of Clinton's donors) I might of missed a few. Oh his tax plan that will lower taxes at all levels and encourage more businesses to stay in the US, and to punish those that don't stay.]
[Each voter has their own ideas of what they want out of X candidate, which is kind of what I'm getting at.]
[sure, but the amount of handwaving trump supporters are going through for _simple_ statements is completely out of rationality. Its one thing to elide over TPP or foreig relations, its a whole nother to praise the leadership of the russians and have your supporters state the opposite.]
[So you're saying Trump is just saying things will be great and letting people fill in what they want to hear? Are you saying Trump is the No Man's Sky of candidates?]
[Clinton is just using "issues" and "policies" to distract from the reality that she is in fact, Hillary Rodham Clinton. Trump has made this obvious. Trump doesn't need to use such arbitrary and trite strategies. "Issues" and "policies" just distract from what is really important, Donald J. Trump! /s]
[One policy he's pretty clear on is wanting police nationwide to stop and search people for no particular reason and confiscate their guns. Somehow this nut still manages to have the backing of the NRA.]
[Just so you know, stop and frisk had nothing to do with taking guns from law abiding citizens and legal gun owners. Therefore the NRA has no problem with it.]
[How would the decision be made as to whether to confiscate someone's guns, then?]
[If you are a legal gun owner and able to carry concealed or open according to the laws of the state, you don't get your gun confiscated. The purpose of stop and frisk was to remove stolen and illegally owned and acquired guns from the public. This includes felons, and people carrying a firearm during the commission of a crime. Often times that crime was selling/possession of drugs. We aren't discussing that right now though, as it's a different discussion.]
[How do they make that determination on the spot? Seems to fly in the face of due process.]
[Just like they determine any other crime. If they are illegally carrying a weapon it gets confiscated. By your logic it would be like saying well why did they get arrested for DUI? That flies in the face of due process]
[What's sad is that is basically saying it's ok if it's for illegal guns only, but that's not how it works. The law violates the fifth and fourth amendments. To myself a presidential candidate who vocally supported a law that violated 2 amendments worries me as a voter.]
[It doesn't violate any amendment, as it's based on a Terry stop. The officer needs reasonable suspicion of a crime for the stop and frisk to occur. Terry stops are absolutely constitutional due to the Terry vs Ohio Supreme Court case.]
[Terry stops have been back and fourth on the legality for years not just in the case of Terry vs. Ohio. In that case it was ruled legal since the officer had witnessed obvious strange behavior and had made the stop and arrest without issue, not only that the case was heavily debated since the exclusionary rule didn't apply in this case. The courts decision was most certainly dependent n the facts of this case and not overall the legality of stop and frisk stops. This was argued again in 2013 when district Judge Shira Scheindlin ruled the law unconstitutional. Judge was removed but plans to reform the law have not been stalled and will move forward. One last thing data shows the idea of stop and frisk lowered the crime rate is unsubstantiated. I can give links if you want. The short is the law skirts the area of legal and illegal depending on the case with almost no evidence of any positive effects, but there have been severe negative effects shown in several videos released.]
[That's where reasonable suspicion comes in, as i said earlier. It's not a law designed to allow officers to stop anyone for no cause to search them. It's a law designed around a legal Terry stop. The problems arise when it's improperly applied. That had less to do with the law itself and more to do with the officers. IIRC the unconstitutional ruling on stop and frisk in New York has more to do with the implementation of the law, and less to do with the wording of the law.]
[The supreme court disagrees.]
[You might want to read up on that again]
[No see Trump said it was constitutional so ha. Seriously though yeah. It's a clearly racist program that doesn't impact crime. Instead it further isolates police from the rest of us and causes backlash and fear over promoting unity between the boys in blue and the people they protect and serve.]
[Exactly, that was said by the judges presiding over the case Terry vs. Ohio.]
[I know what I'm talking about? Wait. Yes?]
[Exactly.]
[Don't forget that if we remove the lines health care will fix itself. PLEASE GOD, SOMEONE REMOVE THOSE DAMN LINES!!!!]
[Because he doesn't want to take WHITE people's guns. The NRA really doesn't give a fuck about anyone else]
[but ask a trump supporter about whether he actually means that and you'll get 5 different handwaving from affirmation to contradiction. Exactly what pence was doing in the vp debate]
[Great piece. Fuck the people threatening them. Hope you understand all you've done is confirm to them and decent people everywhere that they made the right decision.]
[Articles like this are encouraging violence against Trump supporters by falsely painting Trump supporters as evil people who deserve to be attacked. The media is simply playing the victim, painting the Trump campaign as the violent ones, but as we've seen again today, the actual violence is being committed against Trump supporters. Does anyone mention the thousands of threats received by Trump supporters? No. They barely even mention the actual violence against Trump supporters.]
[Could you please provide a couple of sources of actual violence against Trump supporters beyond one or two isolated incidents?]
[This comes to mind. https://youtu.be/EMux_UHmpvc Edit: this was exactly what was being asked for. Why the downvotes?]
[I haven't been keeping a list, but here's one I just found: http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2016/08/violent_attacks_against_trump_supporters_continue_apace.html It's incomplete, for example, it doesn't include the attack in El Cajon, or (obviously) the firebombing today.]
[I read through this list and each of the linked articles contained within. A good amount of their "sources" are just Breitbart articles. That said, two of the six specific examples provided in this article are not examples of violence. Intimidation, sure, but there is plenty of that going on on both sides of the political spectrum right now. As for actual physical violence, I'm still waiting for evidence of *systemic, targeted, organized* violence by Clinton supporters, as you purported to be occurring, beyond a few isolated incidents that have no connection to Clinton supporters as a group.]
[Ok, the sources are Breitbart articles because the left-wing media ignores these crimes. I don't know if the violence is organized or spontaneous, but it's widespread. You won't find stories in the media but countless Trump supporters have been harassed, attacked, stolen from, or had property vandalized in small incidents that don't make the news.]
[How can you make the argument that it's widespread when the source you provide to back-up that claim is only able to provide four verifiable sources of violence occurring against Trump supporters? >You won't find stories in the media but countless Trump supporters have been harassed, attacked, stolen from, or had property vandalized in small incidents that don't make the news. Anecdotal evidence. Show me proof, hell even if all you have is Breitbart or Youtube videos, but don't shovel me this crap that "it's going on, it's just not on the news." I don't spend my time watching CNN and MSNBC. I check Breitbart almost as much as I check left-leaning websites, such as politico or thinkprogress. I see all of these stories presented from both sides and again, there is no evidence to back up your claims.]
[Did you know that during the attack in San Jose, police stood by and did nothing? Did you look at the links under "More examples nationwide"? There you can find reports of a few incidents that made the news. I can't spend all night educating you, but I hope you will dig deeper.]
[Yes, I did look at those links, and again, none of them contain examples of actual violence. Just reports of incidents that would be classified as intimidation, which again, as I said, is not the same as "widespread violence."]
[Can you tell me which threats and acts of violence you are talking about?]
[Oh, those poor bullied trump supporters, all they want to do is deport millions, hang a presidential candidate, and jail reporters, AND revoke the 19th amendment, AND the list goes on you insolent twat.]
[Yea, yea we all know. The system is rigged against you. Your voices are being silenced. Hillary is paying all of us shills to come on here and disagree with you. C'mon man. Look at the big picture and tell me this has nothing to do with your candidate regularly calling for violence against any group who disagrees with him.]
[Looking at the big picture is exactly what I'm imploring you to do. Ignore the words from both sides, look at the actions. Who's committing the mass attacks and the firebombings?]
[At this point, who knows? It could be Trump supporters carrying out revenge against a 'treacherous' GOP.]
[And calling them Nazis?]
[Why wouldn't they? There's a long tradition of calling anyone you don't like Nazis.]
[Who is calling who Nazis in this election? (Answer: Leftists are calling Trump supporters Nazis.)]
[Trump supporters on a average are more likely to be nazi sympathizers.]
[And that's what, 0.01% of Trump supporters?]
[https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2016/10/14/us/mosque-attack-thwarted-kansas/index.html http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/10/14/gop-mailer-we-ll-tell-your-neighbors-if-you-vote-democratic.html http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/300979-armed-protester-stands-outside-dem-candidates-office-for-12]
[That doesn't mention Trump one time.]
[The firebombing hasn't been proven to be associated with the Clinton campaign or any democratic organizations.]
[> http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/10/14/gop-mailer-we-ll-tell-your-neighbors-if-you-vote-democratic.html In fairness, this one is just that people will know you didn't vote. You can't see how people voted, just that they have voted.]
[[deleted]]
[When you spew hatred hatred hits back. :/]
[That applies equally well to the hatred spewed by Clinton and her supporters. But Trump supporters, for the most part, are mature enough not to resort to violence.]
[No]
[Yeah like all the people that have been assaulted at his rallies for protest or existence.]
[You mean all the protestors assaulting those attending trump rallies? Like the ones in California during the primary that turned into days long riots that waved Mexican flags and burned American ones?]
[We're arguing because the guy above said trump supporters are mature and nonviolent. They are not, end of story. Neither are the others.. What is your point?]
[I'm a trump supporter who has never attacked anyone, and I'm pretty mature. Your claim has no basis in reality and is a gross stereotype.]
[How about those bombers in Kansas.]
[Terrorists who should be jailed for life. But that wasn't an attack on Clinton or her supporters and had nothing to do with the campaigns or the election.]
[Denial.]
[They're all too far in the trump hole, they can't back out now.]
[I feel like we should start an outreach sub for closeted ex Trump supporters who are afraid of retaliation or humiliation if they back out now. I would never judge a person for admitting they were wrong. That takes a lot of courage and self respect.]
[[deleted]]
[Maybe you'll have a point when protesters don't get attacked at Trump rallies, and Trump doesn't tell his supporters to do it.]
[You've commented five times on this thread alone bitching about how victimized white dudes are. You literally are living proof of my point about trump supporters.]
[Yeah, when white people are attacked, they too are victims. It's racist and sexist as hell to suggest white men *can't* be the victims.]
[Yeah why doesn't anyone write a song about the struggle of the most successful and privileged group in America? How often a day do you fear sexual assault when you're walking down the street alone and someone looks at you weird? How often do you fear interacting with the cops because you're worried about getting shot? How often do people stare at you like you're a criminal just because of the color of your skin? You have no fucking idea what racism and sexism and bigotry actually look like. You're in the majority group in a country where that group has been in power for 240 years. I am too. I just don't bitch every day about how oppressed I am because I know how bullshit that view is personally.]
[Men may not fear assault, but they should. [Men are victims of violent crime more often than women.](http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cv14.pdf) But that's irrelevant. We're not talking about hypotheticals, we're talking about actual victims of crime.]
[When you say assault, do you mean physical assault? Or sexual assault?]
[I mean all violent crime.]
[Nice redirection. The original point was sexual assault.]
[Why? Because that's the only crime that matters to you? The only crime that hurts? Or because that's the only crime you can use to support your false narrative?]
[To the chain of people talking about violence against Trump supporters being the only violence perpetrated: Only **one** candidate *[actively encourages](https://twitter.com/BettyBowers/status/787711600350355456)* violence against his opponents.]
[I've heard that said, and yet, surprisingly, it's the other side perpetrating the violence. For example: [Mass attacks in San Jose as the police watch](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/06/03/ugly-bloody-scenes-in-san-jose-as-protesters-attack-trump-supporters-outside-rally/) [Mob attacks Trump supporter in El Cajon, California](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGRFEiLBZCE) [Mob attacks Trump supporter in Orange County, California](http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Trump-Supporter-Attacked-at-OC-Rally-Speaks-Out-377672621.html) The truth is Trump supporters are not in favor of violence and you've been misled about Trump's message.]
[Trump supporters [are violent, too](http://americasvoice.org/trumphatemap/)]
[I clicked on a bunch of them and most of them were Trump relates news, no signs of violence, such as a fratrernity building a wall around their house, or they were verbal, just people arguing with protesters, or someone somehow linked to Trump endorsing some organization that is bad or some shit Fucking hilarious how stupid it is. And to think left prides themselves as being the side that checks evidence and sources and doesn't make shit up...]
[So I clicked on a random incident there. First one I clicked on: > Vandals Spray Paint "KKK," Racial Slurs On Black Family's Property > The support continues to roll in for a Tenino man whose property was vandalized with racist graffiti. > Marvin Phillips and his family were on vacation last week when unknown suspects spray-painted “KKK” and other racial slurs on the side of his house and all over his truck. Less than 24 hours later, more than two-dozen volunteers showed up Saturday to paint over the graffiti before the Phillips family returned. > At Tuesday’s city council meeting, Mayor Wayne Fournier announced that the owners of Sunset Chevrolet in Sumner have pledged to repair, restore or replace Phillips’ truck. Fournier said volunteers were unable to remove the orange spray paint from the truck’s interior. > Phillips told the council that he was grateful for the community’s outreach, which has generated national media attention. He doubts the culprits belong to the Ku Klux Klan and said the hate group may be getting undeserved notoriety. No suspects have been arrested. > “No way do I think the people involved in the KKK came over to my home and did what they did,” said Phillips, who moved to Tenino with his wife and five children in 2015. “I am 58 years old. I know better. I’ve seen it. I’ve lived it.” > Phillips said he plans to stay in his new hometown. In fact, the tractor-trailer driver hopes to someday open a bakery in the city. > “I like Tenino. That’s why I moved here,” he said. > Fournier said he is proud of Tenino for coming together and scrubbing out the hateful messages before Phillips’ family could see them. > “We were all sickened by it,” Fournier told The Olympian. “It’s great that the media is highlighting the community’s ability to act.” > Heidi Russell helped rally up volunteers through the Thurston County Youth Football League Tenino Beavers Youth Football & Cheer page on Facebook. When she heard about the vandalism, Russell knew she could count on the community to step up. > “We’re like a family,” she said of the league, which includes Phillips’ children. “I knew my football and cheerleading peeps would be there.” Not one mention of Trump or Clinton. Is that just a random list of crimes?]
[Lol.]
[You forgot /s]
[No, I didn't. If you actually listened to Trump, and not to the media cherry-picking a few words, you'd hear a very different message.]
[Well I hope the Kool-aid is delicious because you're sure drinking a lot of it.]
[If I were drinking the Kool-Aid I wouldn't be here.]
[I have listened. There was actually a moment last April or May that I thought he was making some important points. Then he stopped speaking in complete sentences and started advocating violence and hatred. Have you listened to him?]
[No, you don't. I've watched as many of his speeches live as I can. He constantly uses inflammatory language meant to provoke a violent response. The fact that you don't see or hear it says a lot about you.]
[How dare the media misrepresent Trump by having the audacity to print what he actually says!]
[The media only cares about outrage. (Because ratings.) Hillary chooses to avoid outrageous remarks, Trump chooses to troll the media, but both are simply acts. Behind the masks, the two of them are not that different. Hillary is worse than her mask, Trump isn't as bad as his.]
[>Trump chooses to troll the media, but both are simply acts. This flies directly in the face of a major cornerstone of his campaign, that he tells it like it is. >Trump isn't as bad as his. That's bullshit and you know it. He only sexually assaulted all those women because he was trolling the media! He actually didn't sexually assault them. He also does pay taxes! His '95 returns were leaked to troll the media again. He also committed discrimination against African Americans, not because he is a piece of shit, but because he was trolling the media!]
[He pays taxes every year, as much as he's legally required to pay. He didn't write the laws that allow him to pay so little. As or the allegations, there are similar allegations against Bill Clinton. I suppose they're both innocent until proven guilty.]
[Bill Clinton did not have a tape where he says women let him do whatever he wants, and that he can grab them by the pussy. Or was that just trolling the media too? Because nothing screams trolling the media like a private conversation in 2005, before he started running Don't bother with your whataboutism, it just looks sad.]
[[Yeah...](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/victorious/images/1/12/Jlaw-okay.gif/revision/latest?cb=20120904161949) Do you even read the news?]
[I read the news, then I listen to Trump, and I see that the media isn't telling the truth about Trump.]
[Apparently, telling the 'truth' should be just letting the things the man says, actually not be accredited towards him. Hear that guys? We solved it.]
['Telling the truth' would mean reporting all the things he says, not just those you can take out of context to smear him.]
[You can't take the locker room comments, or the 'this shits rigged, yo' comments, or, the multitude of sexual assault cases that are now pending. That's about as black and white as you can get.]
[Yeah, and Hillary helped attack the women Bill slept with, even the ones he sexually assaulted. They're both awful people, but we have to pick one, and there's more to consider than gutter politics.]
[I should add that I don't know what you mean by 'this shits rigged, yo'? Is that outrageous? Plenty of Bernie supporters said the same thing.]
[What violence has been perpetrated by the other side ?]
[Here's a partial and outdated list of several incidents: http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2016/08/violent_attacks_against_trump_supporters_continue_apace.html]
[Thanks. I didn't know most of these.]
[My sarcasm detector must be broken. You are fucking kidding though, right?]
[Not fucking kidding. Fucking deplorable.]
[Are you thick]
[I'm outraged by the firebombing. And to talk about mere *threats* on a day like this! That's thick.]
[Mere threats? This is terrorism. Spreading terror for political gain.]
[How about this Donald Trump supporter? >Fellow Americans, here we sit once again as a divided nation at the onset of one of our most important elections! We gotta see past all the media BS and brain washing! Each and every citizen has the right to vote for who ever they see fit! I, of course want you to vote for the candidate that I support and yes I will try to change your mind, like you do me, and give reasons why! That's all part of it! But in the end your choice is yours! Over the years, and I have said this many times, the two party process has broken! I do not believe there is truly two different parties. I believe here is a hidden agenda and if anyone will take the time too look this cannot be denied! I personally back Donald Trump because even tho he is running under the republican ticket I do not see him as a party member, part of the problem! I do see him as an outsider, bringing a new outlook I to the govt. I do not think he is part of the hidden agenda that both parties talk about openly now! Time will tell! And if it turns out he has been lying to the American people and he doesn't do what's right for the people and this nation then appropriate action will be taken!! What I do know is this. Hillary Clinton cannot allowed to be in office. Her actions as far back as an attorney in Ark. show her as a lying manipulative beast that deserves to be In Prison. There is NO denying this! The last thing we need as a nation is to have her put in office just because she is a woman! All I ask is before casting your vote, get off your butts long enough to do a little research and look into what the person has done in the past, and what they are running on! She is openly running on disarming the American people!! Putting Americans In relearning centers and fema camps! She actually says these things at her rallies! The division between trump and Cruz voters have hurt feelings and caused chaos among the republican voters! All I can ask is to not take it personal, don't be so offended that you don't get out and vote! That would be a huge dis service to our nation when we need you the most! Me personally, I would of voted for Cruz if he would of got the nomination because I understand that not voting makes it a shoe in for Clinton. The way our govt is, I'm not sure this hasn't been the plan all along!! So, with all that being said I am asking for all Americans to look into their candidate!! I am asking that all republicans come together as a nation! Thanks and. God Bless our Great nation once again!! Here's a hint: he was one of the 3 Kansas men arrested for plotting to blow up a Mosque and Muslim apartment complex. Your representation of violence is entirely one-sided and entirely wrong.]
[I've witnessed firsthand, with my own eyes, a Trump supporter attempt to attack someone. And then scream "hate will win" as she was pulled away. So yeah, try again.]
[I know no Trump supporters who think of their cause as "hate". So I doubt your story, but it could be true, there are crazy individuals.]
[And they wouldn't think of themselves as deplorables either.]
[Did you read the comment above. The Trump supporter supposedly > screamed "hate will win" as she was pulled away. Nobody (not even the actual Nazis) says things like that. That's a cartoon villain's line.]
[Yet trump supporters constantly call themselves deplorables. My point is that, yes they do say shit like this.]
[They call themselves deplorables ironically, as a reminder of the moment Hillary revealed her true self. That's not applicable to "hate will win".]
[But hate will win can't be ironic?]

[Thank you for Correcting The Record™]
[that makes me [SMART](http://cdn.liberalamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/maxresdefault3.jpg)]
[Really? Who's the candidate screaming that their political opponent should be thrown in jail? And that the second amendment people should take care of her? Or how about his remarks that it's perfectly ok to assault peaceful protestors? Spare me the 'Trump supporters aren't in favor of violence' shtick. You're voting for a man OPENLY IN FAVOR of assaulting protestors, rounding up 12 million innocent people, torturing innocents, killing the families of suspected terrorists and lynching 5 innocent men.]
[Well she should at least be tried for mishandling of classified documents.]
[The FBI said they saw no grounds for an impeachment or any chance they could successfully prosecute her. That should settle it, but Trump wishes to imprison his political opponents and release his inner Mussolini]
[That was a totally political move. [The agents working the case thought she got off too easy.](http://nypost.com/2016/10/06/fbi-agents-are-ready-to-revolt-over-the-cozy-clinton-probe/)]
[It could be, but that doesn't give Donnie justification to arrest his political opponents. The system was followed and what Clinton did isn't an imprisonable offense. Just awful judgement]
[She could easily have been tried under the espionage act. If any low level analyst did what she did they probably would have.]
[It also wasn't an no agents who worked the case have publicly said anything along those lines. The article he linked is 3 random FBI agents who disagree with actions they have no fucking clue about because they A) don't work for the FBI anymore, B) weren't on the case, and C) weren't even people who would have worked on such a case.]
[These 3 retired FBI agents who had nothing to do with the case didn't like it. Oh me oh my, what a scandal! Get real, there was nothing wrong with the investigation.]
[not according to the FBI though, so it's your completely unqualified opinion vs the FBI.]
[No, just the head of the FBI who has numerous ties to Clinton. As he's already mentioned, the rest of the FBI [doesn't agree.](http://nypost.com/2016/10/06/fbi-agents-are-ready-to-revolt-over-the-cozy-clinton-probe/)]
[Not the rest of the FBI, just 3 retired FBI agents who had fuck all to do with the case. So basically, just 3 random guys who don't like clinton. Surprised they couldn't find more.]
[Or maybe realize that it is only 3 retired agents speaking about it publicly because the FBI had agents participating in the case sign special nondisclosure agreements, which most agents had never seen or heard about before in their career. Also, it's not like when you retire all the friends that you made in the FBI go away.]
[Okay, so where are these "most FBI agents?" These people are not talking from a place of authority. They don't have any details of the case, or are not presenting them here anyway, that you or I didn't know/have access to.]
[But he's not violent. Lol he's not suggesting violence, honest!!!]
[You don't call pushing someone, punching them in the face or spitting on them "perpetrating violence?" Really? I've been "misled" about his message? >“They’re being politically correct the way they take them out. Protesters, they realize there are no consequences to protesting anymore. There used to be consequences. There are none anymore.” >“I’d like to punch him in the face.” >“He was a guy who was swinging, very loud, and he started swinging. And you know what? The audience swung back, and it was very appropriate. He was swinging, he was hitting people, and the audience hit back. That’s what we need a little bit more of.” >“Maybe he should have been roughed up because it was absolutely disgusting what he was doing.” >“If you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of them, would you? Seriously, OK? Just knock the hell — I promise you, I will pay for the legal fees. I promise. I promise. They won’t be so much, because the courts agree with us too — what’s going on in this country.” And you know what? That's only what the big man himself says. If you want to talk about his supporters... hoo boy.]
[Isolated incidents. There are always going to be a few violent people. But mobs attacking people as in San Jose, or firebombings? Tell me if anything like that has been perpetrated by Trump supporters.]
[fuck trump he wants a shooting war with iran]
[And Clinton wanted a no-fly zone in Syria (where we would potentially shoot down Russian planes). And was responsible for our armed intervention in Libya. Neither is a pacifist.]
[lol this false equivalency stuff is dumb you're not going to convince me he is a dangerous manchild who doesn't know how to act like a real leader]
[Well, if you want someone who will *act*, Hillary is for you. But remember it's just an act, she doesn't actually believe the lies she's telling you.]
[I see right through your bullshit Trump is a fucking fascist and only the most naive people will vote for him Stop thinking you will convince me]
[Fire bombs? Where are the receipts that it was done by the "other side?" Also isn't it the GOP who is always saying don't politicize tragedy, meanwhile they are so quick to jump to conclusion that then violence is done against that it must be extreme liberal? Innocent until proven guilty says hi. Funny how conservatives only follow the parts of the constitution they want.]
[>mobs attacking people as in San Jose, or firebombings Isolated incidents. There are always going to be a few violent people. Tell me if anything like that has been perpetuated by Clinton supporters.]
[A mob is more than a few violent people. Here's another one in [El Cajon (near San Diego)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGRFEiLBZCE)]
[Yep. Every single example that disproves your point is an "isolated incident", and Trump encouraging such behavior and literally saying that protesters deserve it don't count because video evidence of these words coming out of his mouth are "misleading", even if I've watched it live. When did you guys collectively decide that instead of Mexico, you were going to build the wall around the bubble you live in? Furthermore, the only "evidence" thus far of this firebombing incident being done by Clinton supporters is... Trump's unfounded tweet. But go ahead and take that as gospel.]
[They are isolated incidents compared to mobs like these: [Mass attacks in San Jose as the police watch](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/06/03/ugly-bloody-scenes-in-san-jose-as-protesters-attack-trump-supporters-outside-rally/) [Mob attacks Trump supporter in El Cajon, California](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGRFEiLBZCE) [Mob attacks Trump supporter in Orange County, California](http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Trump-Supporter-Attacked-at-OC-Rally-Speaks-Out-377672621.html)]
[>not isolated incidents >*lists 3 isolated incidents*]
[One individual throwing one punch is not comparable to a mob attack.]
[I'd argue the mob is the entire 10000 person rally]
[You're moving the goalposts. There was also mob attacks on anti Trump protesters. **While being egged on by Trump himself** >Donald Trump said Sunday that the protester who interrupted his rally at a convention center here on Saturday morning was **“so obnoxious and so loud” that “maybe he should have been roughed up.”** >At one point, Southall fell to the ground and was surrounded by several white men who appeared to be kicking and punching him, according to video captured by CNN. A Washington Post reporter in the crowd watched as one of the men put his hands on Southall’s neck and heard a female onlooker repeatedly shout: “Don’t choke him!” https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/11/22/black-activist-punched-at-donald-trump-rally-in-birmingham/ Then you have Trump supporters beating up a homeless Hispanic man >http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/20/politics/donald-trump-immigration-boston-beating/index.html And the 3 guys that were planning to blow up an apartment building full of Somali immigrants http://www.kansascity.com/news/state/kansas/article108367907.html And another Trump supporting bomber http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/trump-supporter-bomb-maker-sentenced-90-days-threats-kill-muslims-a6953896.html And all the mosques being vandalized terrorizing Muslims http://www.wowt.com/content/news/Iowa-mosque-vandalized-397242621.html http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20160715/vandals-deface-kingston-mosque http://www.nj.com/hudson/index.ssf/2016/10/bayonne_man_is_charged_with_anti-muslim_graffiti_a.html]
[You know, it's not isolated incidences when your candidate SAYS IT SHOULD HAPPEN.]
[And yet, it's the Clinton supporters actually attacking people.]
[You know - at a minimum - neither side has a patent nor a monopoly on violence. And I have yet to hear Clinton encourage security to knock the shit out of anyone or refer to how protestors were beaten in the past so that should be used a model in the present.]
[No, she just paints millions of people as "deplorable". That's bound to encourage violence (against Trump supporters), and it has.]
[Not 'millions of people'. You. The way you talk down race crime terrorism in this thread alone.]
[trump wants a deportation force projection fails for pro trump people yet again]
[ONE comment that she later walked back is the best you can do given the way Trump has continuously spewed the bullshit you've apparently happily gulped down? I'm certain it was the "deplorable" comment that's created all the gun clutching of the fearful paranoid mass that sees Trump as the saviour of these United States.]
[They are deplorable. If you didn't read her entire statement you lose the option to really comment on deplorables. There were 2 baskets]
[If the shoe fits... Those who advocate for deplorable things should be labeled as such.]
["She called us 'deplorable'? Better act deplorable then!"]
[[There were the three men in Kansas who plotted to blow up an apartment complex and a mosque. They had a stockpile of firearms and explosives ready to go and a twitter feed full of Trump propaganda.](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2016/10/15/1582917/-Kansas-Trump-Supporters-Plot-to-Bomb-Apartment-Complex-Mosque-Foiled-by-Federal-Investigators) [There was another in California doing the same earlier this year.](http://newsone.com/3303551/donald-trump-supporter-arrested-terror-plot-targeting-muslims/) Not to mention the countless cases of Trump supporters attacking protesters. As you've said, there are always going to be a few violent people. The difference is that Donald Trump embraces and encourages the violence while Clinton denounces it.]
[Those bombers (who deserve life in prison) had nothing to do with the election. They were attacking a mosque, not the Clinton campaign.]
[You're right. They're just doing what Trump suggested - ridding America of the Muslims. It's telling that violent Trump supporters see Muslim refugees who fled ISIS in hopes of a better life as the biggest threat to this country while violent Clinton supporters see Trump supporters as the biggest threat to this country.]
[And we see here again that the anti-Islamic violence is far exceeded by the Islamic violence. Once again the left is on the more violent side.]
[So what's the acceptable level of Islamic violence that you're comfortable with then?]
[Are you trying to say that the left is on the side of extremist Islamic violence? You're remarkably wrong if that's what you're saying.]
[Lol you're seriously arguing semantics now. It's different because they didn't attack the Democrats, but *did* want to attack a mosque. Some people attacked the gop, which in no way has anything to do with trumps vitriole? Listen, violence is deplorable no matter what side does it, but to even suggest trump isn't a hateful man who incites conspiracy shit and suggests violence is incredibly ignorant to a point I'd say you're screwing with the comments here or willfully ignorant]
[No, it's different because they didn't attack anything involved with the election. If you're going to count them, then you should also count all the Islamic terrorists who attacked this year as anti-Trump, and again the anti-Trump violence far exceeds the violence by Trump supporters.]
[So they have to literally attack a party location? Is that the defense you're running with?]
[Even on a day like today, you can't resist blaming the victim. Nice.]
[Oh now you guys have a problem with victim blaming.]
[I've always had a problem with victim blaming. Don't stereotype Trump supporters.]
[Stereotyping is *unfairly* characterizing someone.]
[And you think because I support Trump (at least, against Clinton) you know *everything* about me? We're all the same in your mind? You have hate in your heart.]
[> You have hate in your heart. Projection, pure and simple. In order to support Trump, there's a laundry list of deplorable things you must either believe or be willing to look the other way on. Including murdering children in cold blood and torturing for no other reason than it feels fucking good to you. We know enough about you.]
[Yes, by stereotyping him from one comment you indeed prove he's the ignorant hater. I'm glad you took the time to make an actual opinion on your fellow human being. You're so much better than a trump support, thanks for proving that.]
[You support someone who has no respect for the law, who lets bankers and politicians get away with serious crimes. Who wants to remove all government protection from American workers and make them compete with Mexican workers who have no protection from their government. Who supports that race to the bottom that will leave us all working 80 hours weeks for starvation wages. Who wants to rule by executive fiat, declaring that her will is law. If you're to be judged by your candidate, you're deplorable too.]
[You know you're dealing with someone who is beyond worthless when they start dehumanizing you based on your candidate. I don't care who anyone votes for, I may not agree with you, but I don't think that makes you a bad person. Dear God people are getting out of hand.]
[In order to support Trump for President, you must agree with his stated policies, positions and goals as well as his behaviors. I can't think of one that I wouldn't be embarrassed to promote or accept. You have damage in your skull.]
[That's absurd. There are only two choices, I don't agree with either of them. I can "waste my vote" on a third party (tempting) or pick the one I dislike the least. I certainly can't pick one with whom I agree on all policies, positions, goals, and behaviors, because that one doesn't exist.]
[The only reason "there's only two choices" is even an argument is because people keep making it. What if everyone who felt that way voted for Stein or Johnson instead? Whoooaaa, maybe something would happen. You're all so apathetic and jaded you may as well support the people you "can't stand."]
[Then you're not a Trump supporter anyway, so shut up about being one.]
[Tell you what. Explain why you support him. Because he isn't a Republican and isn't a conservative in any sense of the word. So what's the reasoning besides "I hate Hillary"?]
[I support him precisely because the media and the elites are opposed to him. Our system is corrupt, he'll disrupt things. Given enough time, he'd probably set up a new corrupt system, but I don't expect him to last that long or have that much power. Whereas Hillary is the champion of the corrupt system and will only make it stronger.]
[He is part of the old system. This argument is tired. He's not gonna change something that he was a part of for so long. Is that literally your only reason for supporting him?]
[> I support him precisely because the media and the elites are opposed to him. That's a TERRIBLE reason to support him. Do you know why the media and elites oppose him? First: He's an awful fucking human being. Like, this alone is enough for ANYONE, media and elites included, to not like Trump. * He willfully admits to sexually assaulting women * He encourages violence among his supporters * He encourages his supporters to intimidate voters * He's under investigation by the IRS * He's under investigation for the Trump Foundation and Trump University * He admits to willfully breaking his contracts when he knows that the other party can't afford to sue him in order to gain a business advantage I could go on, but the man is simply objectively not a good human being. Second: The media is opposed to him largely because the man can't help but not shut his fucking mouth. He says all this awful shit ON CAMERA or ON TWITTER where it's recorded for posterity and then has the gall to deny that he ever did the things that there is recorded evidence of him doing. What is the media to do at that point? Not drag his lying ass through the mud? Third: The political elite are against him because the political elite need someone who A: isn't going to damage the party's down ballot races and B: Who is going to act rationally when it comes to serious issues like war and foreign policy. Trump's ties to Russia are deeply troubling and the man has made statements on the use of nuclear weapons that no sane person would make. He also scares the piss out of a lot of current and former heads of national defense who have come out against him. Fourth: He is opposed by the wealthy elite because above all things, they desire stability. It is hard to grow wealth in an uncertain world and Trump carries with him a great deal of uncertainty.]
[Yeah, the system's been pretty tough on white males. I hope you can persevere.]
[>"Violence has no place in our society – but especially in our elections...it willfully threatens our community’s safety … and its hateful message undermines decency, respect and integrity in civic participation." Gov. Pat McCrory (NC) regarding the firebombing at a Trump campaign HQ there. I guess he never went to a Trump rally.]
[$20 bucks says it was done by a Trump supporter tryng to instigate chaos.]
[These people are foaming at the mouth, looking for any reason to follow Trump's calls for violence. "They attacked first," is a blaring call to war for a groomed angry mob.]
[Either that or he thinks that it's equally unacceptable, but I wouldn't want to create a false equivalency - obviously firebombing is far worse than fistfights.]
[They're both reprehensible acts, but the building was unoccupied so I'd say an attack on a person is worse.]
[Gross. Just gross. Also: "The mainstream media is an echo chamber that just tells its audience what it wants to hear." "Newspapers are receiving death threats because they're going contrary to what their audience wants to hear." My head hurts.]
[Today, a Trumpeter complained that Hillary is "actively beating the drum of war against Russia," then complained in *their very next comment* that Obama was "being a bitch in Syria with his red line and Crimea." They repeat what they hear or read. That is all.]
[They read?]
[Remember all those nasty people who spit on, shouted at, and protested those kids integrating schools in Arkansas? Remember those people that used milkshakes, food, and cigarettes to show their opposition to those black and white sit-in protestors demanding equal treatment at lunch counters? Remember those police officers that used firehoses, dogs, and batons to stop peaceful marches? Remember those governors and mayors, and regular citizens that looked the other way, or were complacent to the Jim Crow laws & KKK retribution for people that dared to step out of line? Those people, those regular citizens, police officers, and government officials never went away. Those attitudes and that nastiness never went away. They're still there - except that instead of being southern democrats, they're now southern republicans. Why, why, why do today's republicans feel so surprised now, when those bigots and hate-mongers joined and were graciously welcomed into the Republican Party in the 60s and were never asked to leave. Of course they're going to threaten anyone who disagrees with them. They've been doing it for 50 years! Edit: clarity]
[Yeah, I can guarantee you're white. All my friends, who are black and who are Republicans, don't talk like this.]
[Nice try Trumpus Propagandous]
[Is Trump the one with the propaganda channel?]
[What else do you call Fox News?]
[Well of course they don't want to talk or even think about this. Why would they?]
[So your black friends are Ben Carson and Omarosa? Are you...Kellyanne Conway? Or maybe you're...Eric Trump!!! It *is* you!! Don't lie!!! Gosh what should I ask? Ok this is tame: were you and your brother allowed to date anyone that wasn't blond? I was gonna ask if you and your brother were forced to have your dad's hairstyle, but then I thought about all the blonds. Speaking of which, why is Donny Jr brunette? It's a very Baratheon-Lannister mystery, right?]
[All of your friends are black Republicans? If you have more than two friends, the odds of this are astronomically low.]

[He didn't say anything racist, he said you were bad at math. You claimed that ALL of your friends are black Republicans. That seems unlikely. You don't know anyone who isn't black? You don't know anyone who isn't a Republican?]
[Nice try, /r/The_Donald]
[My gay, half black half Hispanic, illegal immigrant, trans, half Jewish half Muslim friends are all HUUUUGE Trump supporters.]
['member?]
[How did those people go from being Democrats back then to being Republicans today?]
[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_strategy]
[Lyndon Johnson and the wider Democratic party began supporting civil rights as a unified party platform. All sorts of racial discrimination like segregation was made illegal, and Republicans on the other hand were in opposition to these laws. All the racists who felt equality in society was a deal-breaker jumped ship to the Republicans. Been like that ever since.]
[Bernie Sanders remembers.]
[Charlie Hebdo anyone? Mind you, these are the people who want to ban all muslim immigration because they might be terrorists, making terroristic threats. The hypocrisy... it's startling...]
[Yeah, f*** you. Charlie was a racist! He was for not letting in Muslims. He was/is a dog and the only reason you like him is because he was against Muslim people. Fuck that. He deserved to die. Not because we muslims believe in violence, but because anyone who mocks muslims deserve to die. So, yeah, fuck you.]
[The way Muslims have been acting, he's right. I'm sorry, but if you want to bring your backwards, oppressive culture to Europe, then you can't expect Europe to just become islamic because *you* want it to. Keep that shit in your deserts where it belongs.]
[The fuck you talkin about son?]
[Muhammad is a homosexual child molester.]
[Charlie Hebdo was not a person. And "he deserved to die", are you serious?]
[I think the dude is making "false flag" comments or is schizophrenic. Not worth your time either way.]
[As far as I can tell, the dude you're responding to (who is all over this thread and others) is literally mentally ill. I would take a wide berth and try not to agitate them any further.]
[That's not a legitimate reason for a person to die. As Evelyn Beatrice Hall said: "I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it".]
[What? Dude you're all over this thread you need to relax.]
[Dude literally has a post saying he believes that all religious prophets were only trying to deliver the message "don't kill" and that people are dense for not getting that. His brain is scrambled, don't bother]
[I don't think his brain is scrambled, he is just a troll who thinks getting people riled up is funny.]
[I read through his history and it's sad. I quickly realized that this was a lost cause]
[And the scumbags making the threats actually consider themselves to be patriots. Nothing more than cowards, as is the bigoted coward they are so enamored with. Fortunately, common sense will prevail and Chump will be relegated to the dustbin of history.]
[I thank the invisible man in the sky for having been born & raised in a civilized part of the country]
[This behavior is the death wail of people who feel like they are being left behind by society and have chosen, against their own interest and those of their children, to actively sabotage their future in futile protest, trying to grasp on to the promises of a proven con artist to bring back the world that no longer exists. I am a conservative - but tenants of that conservatism have always been liberty and decency, to which Donald Trump stands in polar opposition. With my libertarian leanings, I contemplated a protest vote for Gary Johnson for the longest time, but have decided the true protest vote is Hillary. A message must be sent clearly that Trumpism is a joke inconsistent with American principle, and not a credible path for the highest office. The fever dream these people have of a white nationalist nation, enforced by dictate, must be broken so we can convert the redeemable among them back to the logic of their own self-interest.]
[I sincerely hope that people like you can retake and rebuild your party, and we can go back to holding dialogues and looking for ways to work together for the good of the country.]
[Thank you for such a thoughtful post. I wish more conservatives had such a rational opinion on this election. Have an upvote.]
[We really do not need another Don Bolles situation. AZ Republic already has too much history with this kind of thing.]
[Threats from anyone are unacceptable...Trump has advocated this behavior and its scary and wrong...]
[Trump was the only candidate that has had an assassination attempt on him. Trump was the only candidate whose headquarters was firebombed. The rhetoric coming from the HRC campaign is historically vile and needs to end.]
[I've been hearing Trump paid a guy to firebomb that building.]
[Report this to the FBI!]
[I sent an e-mail to Gloria Allred and let her know what I've been hearing. Let's hope the perpetrators are brought to justice within the next 2-3 weeks before election day.]
[Historically vile! The cognitive dissonance in your statement is astounding.]
[Please, a crazy guy who never got near him, and a GOP office somewhere in Carolina? Bet you a dollar whoever tried to burn the office down was somebody who hates Clinton because she is too right-wing. But they definitely belong in jail. And exactly what rhetoric are you talking about? 'Let's not turn the country fascist.' 'Please don't sexually assault women'? That kind of thing?]
[the cognitive dissonance here is mind boggling.]
[Just wait. The same figures advocating for removing absentee ballots are encouraging people to watch polling places. Yeah, definitely not voter intimidation. I'm actually glad I can absentee vote this election.]
[Trump is working up all his supporters to believe that EVERYONE is a threat to them including the Republicans and all the media, and this huge far reaching conspiracy is going to make sure they lose the election. Trump is setting up a very big group of angry heavily armed people to be pissed off after the election without understanding or caring exactly what he is advocating. Only "they" can save America!]
[The comments section in that article were disturbing at best. Right or left there should be some agreement you don't threaten someone physically because you don't agree with them. You don't even do it through vague patriotic horseshit. Agree to disagree and let it the fuck go.]
[This is a fantastic piece, really puts the situation in perspective about the fanaticism this election with a way more grounded and understanding rebuttal.]
[This is a fantastic piece. It's not reality. But it's good because it reinforces what I believe! I love this article!]
[What part of it is inaccurate? You think they're lying about receiving death threats?]
[Hah, I just liked the writing, dawg. Chill out.]
[Does anyone else think violence will increase no matter who's elected? If we get a Pres Trump the gun carrying and racist crowd will be emboldened. If we get a Pres Clinton the same group will be even angrier then they are now. Either way I think we're in for difficult times.]
[No. That's what they want you to think to get a fear vote out of you.]
[I don't know much about this incident, but it's not unprecedented - https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichstag_fire]
[Thanks for taking a stand!]

[This has 3000 positive karma and the firebombing has 6000?]
[This is why Clinton's quote about half of Trump's supporters being a basket of deplorables was so true but an understatement. It seems like 20% of Trump's supporters are just plain evil and another 40% are deplorable but not evil.]

[Yes, I agree. Newspaper and TV news should be unbiased and shouldn't endorse anyone. but this year is so special that it's hard to blame any new outlet to endorse anyone other than Trump. but bottom line, you are right, news should always be neutral, instead of acting like paparazzi]
[so its ok to endorse for years, until none want to endorse trump?]
[No, Like i said, they shouldn't endorse anyone, ever. Read it again, maybe.]
[impossible to know if you have always felt like this or just this cycle.]
[They're allowed to do whatever they want because this America and we have freedom.]
[A newspaper should be unbiased. Can they do anything they want? Sure. Should they do anything they want? No. They should report the news, period. I dont need their fucking opinions.]
[There is such a thing as an unbiased opinion.]
[So skip over the op-eds. Christ, man.]
[>A newspaper should be unbiased. Can they do anything they want? Sure. Should they do anything they want? No. They should report the news, period. I dont need their fucking opinions. So, they should all get rid of their editorial sections?]
[Good. These Republicans could've supported the Libertarian ticket, but that would mean considering the possibility of having more than two political parties. You could've prescribed voting for the bumbling scatter brain with memory issues who will try to do the right thing , but instead you go with one of the most corrupt politician of all time because you know she'll go along on corporatist policies.]
[Supporting a libertarian is just a wasted vote, and actively helps Donald Trump, who they oppose. You can read their article if you actually cared, but we know you won't, and you don't care and that's scary.]
[That's a load of bullshit. If Republicans who would've voted Trump decide to vote Johnson instead, it hurts Trump without helping Hillary. Or are you telling me that there are Democrats who suddenly become convinced when a Republican tells them to vote for her. Like who's going "I'm not sure I can bring myself to vote for Hillary because of how corrupt she is, even though I support the Democrats usually, but thank god there was a Republican lawmaker to convince me"; if anything, it's a red flag warning to us that Clinton will push through some messed up shit comparable to how Billy "just one of the rapist presidents" Clinton's deregulation of Telecom industry, the banking industry, and surge of private prisons. Not to mention, it might actually help these people convince some of these voters to switch from Trump as opposed to just making the electorate even less trusting of the politician. But since America actually has one corporatist party, these spineless fucks are more worried about consolidating power within the "two party system" than about Trump winning.]
[I think this is a pointless piece. I'll say it, I'm pro Donald/anti Hillary and I know that right there will get me downvoted. But to the point...people get death threats over everything these days and they're generally never acted upon. Musicians get death threats, celebrities get death threats, businesses get death threats, hell even twitch streamers and YouTubers get them and for shit a lot more meaningless than politics even though political based death threats have occurred from all sides throughout time (but that probably doesn't matter to the narrative desired to be painted). All I'm saying is this isn't news and likely doesn't need to be looked into much. Either way it's wrong, no doubt about that.]
[I respect the bravery]
[[Don Bolles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Bolles). Look him up. It's cute how you're basically telling news professionals - who work for a traditionally conservative newspaper, no less - what is and isn't news. [Here's the column this article is referencing](http://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/2016/10/16/publisher-response-to-threats-after-republic-endorsement-clinton-trump/92058964/). Read it.]
[> I'm pro Donald/anti Hillary and I know that right there will get me downvoted. I downvoted you because your point was inane, not because of your political leanings.]
[So any death threat anywhere to anyone for anything should be newsworthy? Got it.]
[I consider death threats to anyone newsworthy, sure. This one was particularly so, perhaps, because of the publication's historical political leanings, the large number of threats they likely received, the rage expressed by Trump's base in general, the timeliness of it with respect to the upcoming election, and the fact that the *Republic* had a reporter assassinated in the past, but yes. Threatening to murder someone is newsworthy, and this publication chose to exercise their right to spark a conversation about it in the public sphere.]
[Gross, but let's not pretend that if new York times endorsed trump they wouldn't be getting death threats from angry leftists.]
[Unlikely. I'd just stop reading them if they admitted to being that crazy.]
[They absolutely wouldn't be getting death threats.]
[Definitely would.]
[I know you are but what am I?]
[I am rubber you are glue.]
[That is the type of campaign Trump runs. Fear and loathing. Trump has also advocated his supporters to commit violent acts against people that disagree with his views. Trump even offered to pay the legal bills of said supporters.]
[I thought leftists were too weak and cowardly to do anything except appeasement? Which is it?]
[The donald would tell you that it's violent leftists voting for weak leaders.]
[http://nypost.com/2016/10/16/north-carolina-republican-office-torched-by-fire-bomb/?0p19G=c]
[Huh? Nah I'd just stop reading their editorials because their editorial board would have to be morons to endorse Trump. Which is why Trump has zero (0) major newspaper endorsements.]
[If a new network endorses any candidate they just admitted their bias. Definitely not going to be wasting my time watching/reading their network news now. If they think a candidate is that good they don't need to endorse anyone, just show facts and people will choose for themselves.]
[I don't think you understand the purpose of newspaper editorial boards.]
[Of course. The vast majority of americans don't threaten people with violence. Do you think hannity or ann coulter aren't receiving death threats though?]
[That's a good point, I didn't see it that way until now.]
[I'd be very surprised if they received death threats at the same rate as someone like Colin Kaepernick- all that dude did was take a knee and the right flipped its shit.]
[Do you think the people that do send hannity or ann coulter death threats would send them to nyt if they endorsed trump?]
[I'd wager that there is very little overlap between people that send death threats and people that read he New York Times.]
[Ide wager the people that send hannity death threats aren't the biggest fans of his show either.]
[Probably. But there are plenty of men and women on the right that don't like Mr. Hannity.]
[Backing Hillary is patriotism. Fuck off my sides hurt.]
[Maybe don't back a murderous felon and you won't get death threats.]
[So you are defending death threats nice.]
["YOU SHOULD BE PUT IN FRONT OF A FIRING SQUAD AS A TRAITOR" in the comments section of your article is not a **death threat** you hysterical fucks. Same for twitter or FB replies. Burning down a campaign office or punching out someone over a Trump hat might be, though.]
[Because alllllll the violence is one way.... riiiiiiiiiiiight. That "firing squad/traitor" talk is utter horseshit: it may not be a blunt death threat, but it sure as hell is harassment and is done to intimidate.]
[Just locker room talk.]
[A few death threats to Hillary supporter *3000 upvotes, how dare those Drumpf supporters* Arsonists sets fire to a Republican building "Eh, they deserved it."]
[Ya this shit is about to hit maximum overdrive. Reddit is shitting itself unable to control the narrative. I got a big ol bucket of popcorn for this.]
[Wonderful article ...we should protect our First Amendment rights . There is no need to threaten people who don't agree with you]
[Actually there is a real thread in the r/hillaryclinton sub repeating her tweet in repudiation of the violence on the RNC office. Seriously, screw violent people wherever they may be found and whatever they claim to believe.]
[Feel free to point out any comments that encourage the firebombing. I'm betting that whatever you find, *if* you find any, will be massively overshadowed by comments denouncing the act.]
[Bullshit]
[I love how anytime someone on the left receives a death threat, they act as if they're the only one who ever receives death threats. Popular people and popular organizations WILL get death threats. There are irrational people out there. A ton of them. That's a very small percentage of the overall population, but a ton of them nonetheless.]
[The Arizona Republic is a conservative publication receiving death threats from Trump supporters; if you want Trump and the American right to look better, you all should stop parroting "thats just the way we talk, we don't mean anything by it" - whether in regard to most-likely empty death threats, or boasts about sexual assault.]
[Is allowing an establishment witch who cheated Sanders *really* worth the inevitable domestic/foreign violence that will follow, Hillary supporters? You still have time to stop yourselves from making a horrible mistake. You can have a much better candidate in 2020 with Elizabeth Warren, and she'll *easily and peacefully* defeat Donald Trump, and will welcome his supporters with open arms, rather than call them "deplorable and irredeemable" like Hillary Clinton did.]
[You have a lot of hate in your heart.]
[It's only natural, Sanders got cheated by Hillary and I sincerely fear she'll do the same thing to Trump, as do his supporters. I also sincerely fear a Nuclear/World War with Russia due to Hillary's No-Fly Zone and overall terrible judgement. However, my hatred pales in comparison to the hatred of many of Trump's supporters. I'm more calm about it and simply vocal myself, but many of Trump's supporters may not be as reasonable and level headed if Hillary wins despite all the crimes she's committed, and the likelihood that she won by cheating Trump. I fear civil unrest will rise if Hillary wins and many people are going to get hurt or killed. Hillary isn't fit to lead these people or this country, especially after she called Trump's supporters "deplorable and irredeemable". That's not fitting of a leader. Elizabeth Warren however will bring everyone together and move this country forward.]
[I mean, you can certainly lob those accusations at Hillary, but they are just as true or more so with Trump. It's weird that you focus on the deplorable comment but ignore ask the things Trump said about Sanders and his supporters, and Americans generally. That's hardly a sober analysis of the candidates.]
[Is that a threat?]
[So your argument is that you're so mad about Hillary beating sanders and the Dnc helping her that you want to elect a person who is the exact opposite of Bernie sanders in every way just for the slim chance that we'll elect a Green Party candidate in 2020? Why not elect Hillary and then have Jill beat her in 2020?]
[I both want Hillary to answer for having DWS and the DNC rig the primary against Sanders to prevent them from ever doing that again, and prevent Hillary's terrible foreign policy experience and lack of judgement from causing a war with Russia that could go Nuclear. Trump will keep American on good terms with Russia during his Presidency, and then Elizabeth Warren will run against him. She'll run a clean, issue focused campaign and defeat Trump fairly and without cheating him the way Hillary did Sanders. Trump's supporters won't feel disrespected and cheated, and will have a much easier time accepting defeat to Elizabeth Warren than Hillary Clinton, who called all of them "deplorable and irredeemable" It's not a "maybe", Elizabeth Warren will have zero issues defeating Trump in 2020, and the DNC would be hard-pressed to go against Elizabeth Warren the way they went against Sanders, lest they hand the election to Trump for a second time in a row.]
[Dude how do you know she even wants to run? She'll more than likely retire by then]
[You guys are funny. The GOP headquarters in NC just got firebomed overnight and got burned to a crisp. And you thing Republicans are violent. LOL. Never laughed so hard.]
[Right. Couldn't possibly be someone from the right trying to turn opinions. We'll see how violent Trump supporters are when he loses in November... Either way the beliefs that one side is more violent than the other is so fucking stupid. There's violent idiots on both sides of the extreme in every case.]
[Are you implying that Republicans set fire to their own HQ to make Democrats look bad? Really? Is that what you think is happening here?]
[You're right...totally crazy of me to think that might be a possibility... Never any example of that happening throughout history... https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_flag]
[I don't think that's what happened here, but it's not a ridiculous suggestion. In 2008, [Ashley Todd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashley_Todd_mugging_hoax) carved a letter B into her own face and made up a story about being assaulted, just to try to make Obama supporters look bad. Hopefully the people who set the fire are caught soon, and we'll see what was going on. Until then, it doesn't really do any good to speculate.]
[And it was abhorrent when they did that too. Just because we have some violent extremists on our side too doesn't make you suddenly not violent.]
[Then I'm sure the GOP and the Trumplicans will lose their elections gracefully in November.]
[If you have some evidence on who did this, then please contact the local police department. You sound very confident! Or concerned. One of those.]
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseshoe_theory The far left and far right have a lot more in common with each other than they have with the majority who are more moderate on either side. Politically inspired violence is not a liberal or conservative issue, it's an extremist vs moderate issue. There should be bipartisan denouncement of every act, threat, or inciting of violence.]
[[deleted]]
["All models are wrong, some models are useful." I don't think there's some universal truth to horseshoe theory, but it very much applies to the 2016 election. Fwiw, I am not a centrist, I'm very solidly liberal, but I'm appalled at everything going on this election, and all I see and hear are the loudest voices from the extremes on either end and frankly they're both pretty disgusting.]
[> NC just got firebomed overnight and got burned to a crisp. right wing infighting. Trump's fascists are more ideologically pure than the goobers who voted for Burr and McRory.]
[Thanks for correcting that record for me.]
[That's not acceptable either.]
[So why is it downvoted?]
[He is making a stupid strawman.]
[No not him, The post. Why isn't it on the front page here? (It wasn't when I posted this originally.)]
[Because it just happened?]
[86% upvoted is better than average, by far. It will be a top post in a while soon.]
[Umm it's at the top and everyone is condemning it. Stop making shit up. Not everyone believes easily disprovable lies.]
[A small number of democrats firebomb a GOP headquarters: "OMG ALL LIBERALS ARE SO VIOLENT REPUBLICANS ARE THE PEACEFUL ONES VOTE TRUMP" Three Trump supporters are arrested for plotting to blow up a mosque: "Meh, it's okay, not all Trump supporters are like these three, Democrats are the ones who are really violent, this isn't at all indicative of how other Republicans think." You trumpets gotta pick one, you can't have it both ways.]
[I like how you put "Three Trump supporters plotted"... Nevermind that they're supremacists. Nevermind that they're anti-Muslim. Nevermind that they're crazy sick fucks. They're Trump supporters. THAT'S WHY THEY PLOTTED THIS! LOL. If you even paid the slightest attention to current events, it's the Trump supporters who get hassled on the streets. It's the Trump signs that get stolen. It's the Trump supporters who get yelled at and threatened at rallies. If you don't believe me, just go to YouTube and search "Trump supporter gets attacked" The left has, and always will be, bullies. You feel justified in promoting your agenda because you inevitably feel you are right. Ironically, you promote free speech. Yet, when someone presents an idea that runs contrary to your beliefs, you ostracize, you condemn, and if all else fails, you use violence.]
[Lol. I'm getting downvote to death for this statement. Tell me, if I was speaking for the Left, would I get downvoted this much? No, I doubt it. Let's face it. This site is a partisan cesspool of Democrats. I don't hate Reddit. It's life. The left will always have control of the media.]
[> left will always have control of the media why do you think that is]
[Lol "i hate everyone because the general population tends to be more liberal."]
[> Nevermind that they're supremacists. Nevermind that they're anti-Muslim. Nevermind that they're crazy sick fucks. They're Trump supporters. Wait, are you encouraging *nuance?*]
[> Nevermind that they're supremacists. Nevermind that they're anti-Muslim. Nevermind that they're crazy sick fucks. That's your problem with them? Those all apply to Trump too, so how don't you have a problem with him?]
[cant we just use common sense? both sides have idiots on the far extremes that do violent stupid shit...that doesnt mean everyone on both sides is that way. If people firebombed the rnc headquarters in NC then those ppl need togoto jail. Same like the ppl who plotted to blow up a mosque those ppl need to goto jail. You could make the arguement that trump and his rhetoric caused this but i dont buy that. Like for someone to seriously plot to blow up a mosque they are already thinking that way before trump siad anything. You could possibly blame trump if a supporter punched a minority outside a rally due to trumps rhetoric that i mighit say was trumps doing, but this is different....these idiots hate muslims, have hated muslims long before trump was a candidate and will ocntinue to hate them after trump. SO please lets just use common sense..... Also id guess that whoever bombed the RNC place in NC it prob had more to do wiht their governors race than it did with hillary or any national politics.....]
[So, when a Trump supporter tries to kill people, its because the world is complex and there were many reason. When a Clinton supporter or democrat or someone on the left does it, they are bullies and evil and it must be that theyre leftist. Got it.]
[What? Trump supporter tried to kill someone? Well, fuck them. Send them to JAIL! Oh... what's that? No one actually tried to kill a non-Trump supporter? Fuck it. Send them to jail anyway.]
[You do know that this week 3 people were arrested for planning to bomb a mosque, right? And they were trump supporters.]
[Don't feed the troll. It's been rambling all over these comments.]
[A small number firebomb. A small number attack trump supporters. A small number steal trump signs. A small number vandalize trump supporters cars. It's almost as if the left is kinda criminal. http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/jail-survey-7-in-10-felons-register-as-democrats/article/2541412 Weird. That's kind of a big number.]
[> Never laughed so hard. You've led a pretty dull life :(]
[Have suspects been arrested or identified? Until then, you can't imply a motive.]
[Laugh now because you'll be crying on November 29.]
[Burned. Too soon?]
[Never too soon. Never stop reminding these people of who they are.]
[There is so much foreign money and power behind the clinton crime machine that they cannot NOT win. I'm afraid of desperate actions by these criminals, they privately know they are headed for a Trump landslide.]
[No, don't worry, whoever told you that was lying. They just want to scare you into voting for Trump. Besides, even Trump knows he is losing, why do you think he is spending so much effort lying about the polls and his supporters are threatening to riot after the election?]
[>they privately know they are headed for a Trump landslide. [Sure about that?](http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/#now)]
[you mean traitor trump the russian patsy?]
[Territorist threat is a crime at least in Calif..just saying u will kill someone can u a case....u reap what u sow....its a matter of time]
[I think you are in the wrong thread dude.]
[Hillary blames the newspaper staff for provoking the response.]
[No, no, Clinton is the Democrat, Trump is the Republican one. The people making the threats are all Trump supporters. It's the Trump supporters who are so angry at the newspaper and think they deserve this treatment.]
[I wonder if these is the US we had the last 40 years? It is disgusting the level of nonsense hate we are experiencing]
[A wonderful story, I know it was difficult to write, I applaud you, I agree this person, is a very evil man and believes everyone should kiss his feet, he is a disgrace to the human race]
