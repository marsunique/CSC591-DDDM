It's surprising that a man who is stunningly ignorant on literally every subject would not turn out to be a brilliant military strategist.
But he is advised by *the best* generals.
Endorsed by all 4000 of them, too.
*wrong.* He advises the best generals.
Mainly his own brain, which is very good
Presidents have to make the decisions, not their advisors. They also can't blame.m their advisors when their decisions are wrong and just fire everyone to try to fix things.
What good is their advice when he knows more than all the generals?
He was trying to play up surprise, but he doesn't understand the reasons at all why we've been forecasting this, which is to get as many civilians out as possible and to push for as many defections from ISIS as possible," said Clint Watts, a fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute and former Army officer.
and explain how we should care about civilians. Does caring help us win a war? Also I really doubt you will get defections, defections occur during a battle when your side is losing not before hand. The leaders will cull anyone trying to run away. Sorry but all i see is an appeal to authority not justifying why we are doing this if we want to win a war.
> and explain how we should care about civilians Because if you didn't, you wouldn't be much better than IS so don't even bother to fight them. :)
And more practically, if US troops kill a large number of civilians, the survivors may join ISIS.
Caring helps you get intel and civilian support and maintain control once you take a city whereas not caring creates even more insurgents willing to fight you because you're killing their families anyway. This is basic, basic stuff.
Wow really? I can't believe Watts said that, what a scoop! And where pray tell did you find this information?
Not just that but the odds of a successful surprise attack while using a coalition of some 50,000 troops is impossible. You just can't move that many troops without a spy, word of mouth, or general observation skills of the enemy giving you away. Its not like the Isis leaders in Mosul were just sitting around saying "look! 50,000 troops are surrounding us but we shouldn't believe it's happening until we see it on the news."
"Sir! The outpost five kilometers down the road is reporting that they're being overrun and begging for reinforcements. Scrap that, they're saying all hope is lost praise be to Allah." "Nonsense. Baghdad Bob assures us that the infidel troops are committing suicide and have been pushed back to the sea. Form the men to march on Baghdad."
Ask the boys who landed on D-Day about the element of surprise. That shit only buys so much edge. trump is a moron with money.
The Allies certainly did not depend on surprise. They poured enormous effort into creating a fake military (including putting Patton in charge) that was poised to apparently invade through Calais.
The generals talk about strategic surprise and tactical surprise. It's hard to keep strategic surprise because opponents should know their weak points. But tactical surprise is essential. For instance, on D-Day, the Germans knew the Allies were going to land in France. But the Allies maintained tactical surprise of where and when they would land.
DT couldn't win a game of Risk, let alone sit through it and pay attention.
Surprise on D day saved an awful lot of allied lives and is probably the most important reasons for the success of operation overlord
Thinking that modern urban multi-actor urban warfare in heavily built-up areas full of civilians is anything like D-Day shows how ignorant some people are about modern warfare.
I wasn't the one who brought up D day.
Probably the most important reason was the entire fake military lead by Patton the Allies built for an invasion of Calais. They put a lot of effort into convincing Hitler to move his forces there and away from Normandy.
It was more than surprise though. We won the intelligence war and tricked them into thinking it was happening somewhere else entirely.
They didn't have modern tracking. There is no way to surprise ISIS that armies were closing in around Mosul.
we are supposed to simultaneously believe they are "tech savvy" and that they are so dumb/backwards that they don't have any sort of communication and monitoring system in place. Here is how it would go down if anything resembling an army got anywhere near Mosul: some kid who has been told it is his job to keep an eye on things will send a text message to a middle-management ISIS guy alerting him to an increased military presence heading their way. You don't even need some sort of fancy radar/tracking/whatever system in place for a surprise to be impossible, you just need a few loyals and some cell phones positioned around the country. To take out a whole city you need a good number of people and a lot of equipment. There is no way to move all that into the country and close enough to Mosul without being seen by people and in this day and age if **anybody** knows something then **everybody** knows something. You would have videos of US troops landing in transports at some base on wikileaks within a few minutes of it happening. The world is so interconnected that it is impossible for a large scale military operation to take place in secret.
I thought we learned this back in Mogadishu? Kids that just sit with a cell phone watching bases...
Sure. And as Helmuth von Moltke said "no plan of operations extends with any certainty beyond the first contact with the main hostile force." I don't want an erratic piece of performance art doing his best interpretation of bad taste Frankenstein running the show.
I heard it described as "a plan meeting opposition is a lot like shit hitting a fan"
Ah I see someone's been listening to Dan Carlin. That series and Kings of Kings has been some of the most fascinating podcasting I've heard in a good, long while.
Or someone's actually cracked a book.
There was no surprise in that the Germans absolutely expected an invasion. It's not like the Allies were being coy about planning on an invasion. And tactically, some of the American beaches decided on a very short bombardment before going in to keep the element of surprise; they did worse than Brits who opted for a much longer bombardment.
Theoretically the other option was coming up from North Africa the long way. There was even talk of pushing north from Italy reverse Hannibal style. in all honesty both of those options were more plausible at the time. No one had seriously considered a naval invasion of the scale of the Normandy landings. Before they decided to go with it it was just a theory. It would be like us dropping a full division from orbit right onto Mosul. Once the build up started the Germans were all "oh fuck the crazy bastards are going to do it."
They actually did end up launching an amphibious invasion into southern France a month or so later; it worked out pretty well and a lot of allied supplies ended up coming in through Marseilles
True, but that was also an invasion at a port site already. The most audacious thing about Normandy was there were no harbours there, no way to actually exploit a beachhead. *We brought the harbor with us.*
They knew it was inevitable, but they didn't know it was coming when it did. As for brits vs us....there were several reasons it was much more difficult. But had they known when and where, it probably would have failed.
Well, there is a difference between taking a city of 1 million defended by 7,000 fanatics with 35,000 troops vs the mandatory amphibious invasion of another continent by two mechanized armies with more than a million troops each.
Completely agree, the similarities between this and liberation of Europe are few if any. However, in my mind if there are 7000 people holding 1 million through intimidation, those million aren't going to leave no matter how much warning you give, or they would have already. Someone facing the atrocities these people have would have tried to leave long ago if they thought it was possible. Luckily, ISIS uniforms will be easy to spot amongst the civilians leaving.......or maybe they can just ask them to tell the truth.
But notice the lack of a civilian population.
It was an offensive op to establish a beachhead to project future offensive ops. Full spectrum ops in Iraq against insurgents in support of local gov't partners are a completely different animal.
Yeah, but /u/the_falconator isn't the one who brought up the shitty D-Day analogy. He/She was just working with what they got.
A properD-Day analogy would be them projecting that they would attack another city then launch an attack on Mosul once all defences had been moved elsewhere. And I'm not sure of any cities near Mosul that they could actually have fooled ISIS into thinking was the main target instead of Mosul. It's not that the Germans didn't know an attack was coming (they definitely did because of the build up of troops) they had just been fooled into believing the attack would be landing at Calais and moved the bulk of their defences there leaving the actual landing sites much less heavily defended.
We were kinda stupid back then.
They also didn't think it would come that week because of the awful weather.
A fake army made to fool aerial reconnaissance didn't hurt either.
It also helped that every one of Hitlers spies in England actually worked for the Allies.
Fake army with the one General the Germans respected.
A hell of a lot of them respected Bradley. EDIT: they *respected* Bradley because he cared about his men and would do whatever he could to make sure they went home in one piece. They *feared* Patton because he just didn't give a fuck, he would bury a million men if it meant victory.
I agree. I just re-watched Patton. Great fairy tale. Patton arrived at Bastogne and the war was over!
Not to mention that we *want* their top leadership in the area to try and flee. That's how we catch them, on the road in a convoy surrounded by their loyal and faithful, individuals we have *absolutely no problem* with being between us and the target. This is what I do for a living. This is what I see on a daily basis. We do not pull triggers in crowded areas, but put them out on a long stretch of road where we can and are watching everything within ten miles and they are righteous fucked.
He also doesn't understand that they can see the troops coming. It's not spec ops. It's armies taking strategic points all around the area and closing in, with all the vehicles and supply lines that comes with that.
Seeing giant columns of vehicles heading down every major highway in a certain direction kind of makes is obvious too. It's not like ISIS doesn't have sympathizers or active cells all over Iraq. You can't move that many men and that much equipment without people noticing.
Iraqi and Kurdish troops have also spent the last 18 months liberating the towns along those highways, so their supply convoys don't get ambushed. Actual military planners think about logistics. Armchair general idiots do not.
Donald doesn't understand military intelligence because he has no intelligence of his own
Dude needs to watch Sicario
Tbh I liked super sicario world a lot more.
no no no, we are just going to send in like 3,000 James Bonds. Nobody will even see them. They will wear all black and turtlenecks, very classy and very professional. It will be incredible. ISIS won't know what hit them! /s

fuck you beat me to that comment
The dark black, or slightly darker black turtlenecks?
Ahem... I believe it is referred to in professional circles as a tactileneck. Thank you very much.

Nobody expects Ser Twenty Goodmen.
I wish more attention had been paid this election season to Trump's manifest ignorance about basically everything. He is so goddamn fucking *stupid*. Wildly uninformed on any and all topics, and worse, wildly uninterested in learning. And the Trumpets always call back, "well, how come he's so rich if he's so stupid?" Because he's not that rich, because he got a huge head start, because he screws over anyone weaker in resources than himself, because he gets a massive golden parachute every time one of his businesses or properties goes under, because he's a con man who is excellent at fleecing those who can be easily persuaded to part with their money... If he wins, there is going to be the rudest awakening in history for the fools who have enabled him this far. They will get almost nothing of what they wanted. They will have just succeeded in giving the ultimate hand job to the boundless ego of a pathological narcissist and blithering idiot.
I don't know if he's as stupid as he seems, or if he says stupid things because he knows his voters are stupid. The whole "why don't we do a sneak attack thing" seemed like the kind of thing that would make his supporters cheer in agreement.
This has been annoying as hell for me since day 1. Why the hell are no military/political big wigs calling him out for not knowing a god damn thing/having grade school ideas about policy ideas? It's startling.
The real scary thing is that Trump ticks most of the criteria for antisocial personality disorder ( i.e., a sociopath).
The New York Times has a page that lists 160 Republicans who don't support Trump and what he said to make them back away. They haven't updated it in a few weeks but it is really interesting http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/08/29/us/politics/at-least-110-republican-leaders-wont-vote-for-donald-trump-heres-when-they-reached-their-breaking-point.html?_r=5
There are 33,000 (now 650,000) reasons to disavow Clinton yet few democratic leaders have done so. I never would have thought the Repubs would nominate the anti-corporate candidate before the Dems did.
If Hillary Clinton said this stupid shit the Democrats would not endorse her http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/08/29/us/politics/at-least-110-republican-leaders-wont-vote-for-donald-trump-heres-when-they-reached-their-breaking-point.html?_r=0
sorry thats behind a paywall so i cant read it

I would make the same list for Democrats but none of them have had the integrity to stand up to the Clinton machine. [Oh no wait, here is one](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2016/10/30/democrat_doug_schoen_is_reconsidering_his_support_for_hillary_clinton_because_of_fbi.html)
Like the time he told people in Fresno that there was no water drought in california, and all the trouble was the evil gubmint was diverting their water out to sea to save endangered fish?
My jaw dropped when during the first debate he was asked a question about the nuclear triad and he gave a long, rambling, Trumpian response that indicated that he had no idea what the nuclear triad *was*. You would expect someone running for President would be briefed on these sorts of details, but no. Trump doesn't need no stinkin' *information*. He's above that.
I am hoping more than anything for Hillary to win, I feel confident she will. If Trump somehow does win, then a majority of Americans deserve what they get. I'll go volunteer working in the Congo at a chimpanzee sanctuary for 4 years, someone needs to clean up after them.
There were so many squandered opportunities in the debates by Clinton and even the moderators to nail him down to something and expose his incredible ignorance on so many topics. SO many. And he just smirked and smart assed his way right out of all of them.
People just can't believe that there is any other way to get rich than by being smart and resourceful. You can just as easily get rich because your parents were rich or because you are an absolute slime bag or in Trump's case, both.
The problem it won't still kill Republican crappy policies. They will just say Trump was not a real Republican voiding any lessons we can learn from him.
America idolises the rich.
Trump divides good people and bad people by the money they make. In this respect the Clintons are far superior to him.
Trump is the number one argument against capitalism
and democracy.
In the third Presidential debate, Trump was was asked what he was going to do in Mosul. Trump, "We're going to do so many things in Mosul." The End.
> Wildly uninformed on any and all topics, and worse, wildly uninterested in learning. That sadly also is a perfect description of most of the Trump supporters I know.
And unvetted. Atleast we know where clinton's faults lie
but can't you hear him starting with the "I need three terms, it's much, much worse than even I thought it was, it's horrible" after week 2.
Also you can be smart at one thing and be really stupid in lots of others and still be rich.
"But if he's good at scamming people and abusing the corporate form, so why can't he lead the executive branch of the United States?"
And it's not just his ignorance on topics. Ignorance by itself can be fixed with information. Trump, though, has an apparent lack of interest in learning about the topics a President needs to know while insisting that he knows more than the experts. Trump's ignorance is completely intentional and there's no fixing that.
Don't underestimate cognitive dissonance... remember, people are still praising Bush Jr. (other than that I agree)
I'd take Bush 2 (or 3) in a heartbeat over donald.
Yup. Can't believe I miss that damned fool.
Given that we are still digging ourselves out of Bush 2, I'm hesitant... but over Trump, a big capital F.
Bush Jr. wasn't all bad, and I'm a liberal Democrat saying that. He put far mre care into his words. He went to Yale (sure, he was rich et all and probably had it a bit easier, but he still did ti). He was often seen publically as a buffon because of an accent and phrasing. He made some bad choices, but he wasn't the worst ever and he's actually quite intelligent.
He was just stupid, not dangerous. You would love to have gone to school with Jr. he would have blast a blast to party with.
I'd love to hang out with him now!
He raised daughters and married a wife that are all backing Hillary...
Well, that's just sanity at this point.
[This is how low our bar has been set.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVynnbx1Xsc) Bush sounded moronic before he was even elected.
The real problem was the rest of his administration. People like Rumsfeld and Cheney. He was given terrible advice, and trusted the wrong people. His reputation will forever be tied to a war that in hindsight is largely seen as a mistake. But it was his advisers who wanted that war more than anyone.
Extreme dem here. I think in most cases he truly thought he was doing the right thing...I believe his kids even got him to start balking at the party line on global warming...
Trump's advisors would all be in the pocket of various industries beyond anything we've seen. It's just who he'd hire; Lobbyists are some of the most alpha ego heads out there but also know how to con people and tell them best what they want to hear. Those types would easily make top picks.
> Because he's not that rich, because he got a huge head start, because he screws over anyone weaker in resources than himself, because he gets a massive golden parachute every time one of his businesses or properties goes under, because he's a con man who is excellent at fleecing those who can be easily persuaded to part with their money... Shorter version: if he took his father's loan and made moderately sensible investments in things like index funds, he'd probably have more money today than he got from playing the real estate game, which *can* result in big gains, but also big losses.
His followers refer to this type of stupidity as "common sense".
I mean, they're half-right - one thing this election has taught me is that it's all too common...
>And the Trumpets always call back, "well, how come he's so rich if he's so stupid?" Because he's not that rich, because he got a huge head start, because he screws over anyone weaker in resources than himself, because he gets a massive golden parachute every time one of his businesses or properties goes under, because he's a con man who is excellent at fleecing those who can be easily persuaded to part with their money... Because you can get rich while still being dumb as rocks. Especially when you start already rich.
Paris Hilton is a successful, rich business owner. Let's make her President.
I almost want him to win just so we can say we told you so, win back congress in the midterms because of the overwhelming disgust with this guy, and slot in another 8 year democratic president in 2020. Unfortunately, by then the supreme court will be conservative majority, we'll probably have lost a ton of civil liberties, the economy will be in the toilet, and russia will be invading nato allies, so there's that.
Him winning may be a win-win. If he can do what he says ant is successful people could be better off. That is a win. If he fails then people may not fall for this shit again. That is also a win. The only problem is the latter is going to hurt us. Maybe it is required. What I've said about the student load bubble is that we need to let that one pop. Tweaks and band-aids are problems. Sam with his plan. It needs to pop.
> If he fails then people may not fall for this shit again. You're talking about an electorate that has Trump this close after Bush nearly took down the country 8 years ago. Trump has only proven how the short the American public's memory is, and how gullible they are.
The very reason why Trump is popular now is the very reason a Trump presidency won't be an eye-opener. Even if Trump were to personally nuke a country on livestream, his voter base would still blame the fallout of his actions on the omnipresent entity they call "the liberals."
In my dark moments, I too go through this exact thought process. "Aw, Clinton's gonna cruise to a win, the idiots will spend the next four years saying everything would be better with Trump, they'll never learn how stupid they've been." Then something like Comey happens and I'm jolted back into *oh Jesus fuck this dipshit could become President holy fucking shit that can't happen*
> If he wins, there is going to be **the rudest awakening in history** for the fools who have enabled him this far. Reminder: the current holder of that title is Germany, 1945.
Im halfway down the page and this is the first Trump is Hitler post I''ve seen. You are disappointing me r/politics
I dunno, I'd say the Japanese got a bit more of an eye-opening.
At least we could hope for a post-war economic miracle!
You don't vote for emperor!
Forgive me. I was indulging my inner Trump, where anything and everything is "the [superlative] ever/in history."
Oh no, do not apologise. You may still be very right, despite what I wrote above.
Let's hope not.
There is not one field of thought where Trump is considered a leading intellectual or even influential, besides perhaps real estate tax evasion.
He has very little knowledge of that. His accountants work the magic.
He doesn't even do that himself; he's got a guy for that.
He just hires lawyers to do it for him. I guarantee he doesn't know shit about taxes.
His old tax accountant came out and said exactly this.
His tax attorney has stated that he doesn't know about tax law.
This is how he'd approach the oval office. Hire supposed experts. Then demand they assess everything and tell him what to do. The President has advisors for sure, but Trump doesn't want the actual accountability. He wants people to advise him what to do - not just give him potential options. And then he'd try to blame them if shit went wrong - never himself. He'd never, ever want the actually portion of responsibility that is being the President when something you enacted goes wrong. He NEEDS that scale goat, as he'll never admit anything is his fault, and that's simply unacceptable for a President.
>The President has advisors for sure, but Trump doesn't want the actual accountability. He wants people to advise him what to do - not just give him potential options. And then he'd try to blame them if shit went wrong - never himself. A good example of the role of military advisors is the Bin Laden raid. Some of Obama's advisors didn't like the SEAL option. Some thought they should do a joint raid with Pakistan. Others thought bombing the compound was a better way to go. A lot of ideas and opinions were tossed around. But in the end, not one of his advisors could actually make the decision. Pres. Obama had to give the order himself. luckily, in this case he got it right, but the responsibility still falls on the President's shoulders, regardless of the outcome. I don't think Trump understands this very basic job of the Presidency.
Exactly. I've been saying for a while:. He thinks he can delegate, but he doesn't realize he can't delegate the actual decision making nor the responsibility. He'd be like "Okay, so which of these plans do you all think is best" and they'd be like either "Sir, that's for you to decide," or there would be no consensys even if they were willing to give answers. In the case of just one advisor who did decide to tell him what to do, that's so fucked up and not what h the President is voted in for.
The first time I watched him debate, I thought this is a guy who doesn't actually want to *be* president, he just wants to be *called* Mr. President.
Can we put him in a holodeck simulation where he's President, then lock the door and just let it run to infinity? So he thinks he's President and then the rest of us can move on.
No holodeck needed. Jut put him behind a podium facing a screen that shows a repeating reel of cheering crowds.
If he's elected, I truly believe he'll let Pence handle all of the domestic and most of the foreign policy. He'll just step in when he thinks he has a chance to look tough by lobbing missiles at someone. He'll spend the rest of his time practicing graft at the highest possible levels.
I mean, not to brag, but I had that feeling the day he announced. I used to watch a show on Golf Channel where Trump hosted a few celebrities to play a competitive match on one of his golf courses. I didn't care for Trump, I just liked seeing how well Mark Wahlberg and co. could golf. Even then I knew Trump was an insufferable, incoherent ass and felt vaguely dirty about watching his show. I suppose Apprentice viewers have known this for a while as well.
True story: He often insists people call him Mr. Trump, even close friends. He hates it when people he consider his peers feel on even grounds to call him anything else.
Just more evidence that Clinton did her homework and intentionally called him Donald during the debates. Has anyone tallied up the ratio of "Donald" to "Mr. Trump" Clinton used in the debates?
I think it was 100% "Donald".
She'd purposefully never called him Mr. Trump precisely for these reasons.
> I wish more attention had been paid this election season to Trump's manifest ignorance about basically everything. He is so goddamn fucking stupid. Wildly uninformed on any and all topics, and worse, wildly uninterested in learning. It's so bad he makes Sarah Palin look like a Scholar.
She at least tried to learn a few things on the fly. Or she at least tried to *appear* as if she could learn a few things on the fly. Trump isn't even trying for *that*.
> And the Trumpets always call back, "well, how come he's so rich he so stupid?" I love that quote that people keep posting: "Trump is a poor man's idea of a rich man." If you've spent a lot of time around people who have money, or even college kids whose parents have money, you know damn well that it doesn't require superior intellect and wisdom.
Correct.
He's so rich because it's hard to burn through hundreds of millions of dollars, even when you're a manifest idiot. Even with all of his cheating and stealing, the analysis I've seen says that he'd be much richer if he had just taken his inheritance and invested in a mutual fund. Somebody in another thread said that there's a joke in New York that goes: Q: How do you make a small fortune in real estate? A: Give Donald Trump a large fortune.
How to become a millionaire like trump....start as a billionaire.
You can be rich and dumb.
He did great because real estate in general did great over his lifetime. He rode market trends with massive starting capital.
Yeah, that too.
Pretty much. During the period from, like... 1981 to 2015, Trump's wealth increased by 300%. Which sounds like a lot... until you realize that the S&P500 increased by around 1200% during the same time. And actual wealthy people, like Gates and Buffet, increased their wealth by 1500+% during that time. Which means Trump performed worse than the market during that time period, which means as a percentage of the market, Trump's wealth decreased, while Buffet and Gates gained more of a percentage of the market. And all that would be fine if Trump was actually a decent person. Gates and Buffet use their wealth to benefit other people, at home and abroad. Buffet in particular leads an incredibly humble lifestyle. Meanwhile, Trump uses his wealth for pure self-aggrandization. He is the New York equivalent of the dumb redneck who wins the lottery and goes out and buys himself a McMansion. And even that would be acceptable, if he didn't turn around and try to paint himself as a philanthropist. The only person Trump cares about helping is Trump. He's the sort of person who would bring a store bought cake to a party, say he made it himself, then take half of it home for himself to eat and leave the other half to be picked over by the rest of the guests of the party. And then for years afterward he'd talk about how he brought a lovely cake to that one party, and everybody really enjoyed it and said he was really great, when in actuality all everyone remembers is being very disappointed because they had to split half a cake - which wasn't even that good because it was store bought - between forty people while one greedy jackass took the other half for himself.
Ha ha! Yes, he makes the *best* cakes!
> During the period from, like... 1981 to 2015, Trump's wealth increased by 300%. Pssht, in that same time period my wealth increased by infinity%. I should've run for president.
The fact of the matter is, his success as a real estate person born into a rich real estate family, no matter how great, does not indicate the job he may do as president. In many ways those two positions require contrasting qualities and personal motivations. What I am trying to say is let us dispel of this myth.
> And actual wealthy people, like Gates and Buffet, increased their wealth by 1500+% during that time. I was curious so did some napkin calculations based on these quickly looked up numbers: Gates in '86 = $315M, Gates today = $78.5B, 26000% increase Buffet in '85 = $620M, Buffet today = $66B, 10600% increase Of course, those two guys are superlative examples of wealth builders, but Trump pretends to be as well and as you said he aint.
I'm no economic expert. I'm barely a layman, but isn't 300% pretty terrible over 35 years? I mean, couldn't you make 300% with a return of like 3 or 4% per year, which you could get by going to an accountant? I might be wrong.
You are right, go into a [inflation calcutor](http://www.usinflationcalculator.com/) and his returns only just beat inflation 1981-> 2015 $1m -> ~$2.6m
I'm right there with you. People focused on the crazy stuff he said in the third debate, but mostly ignored that he *still* clearly didn't know what a pre-existing condition is. And that's after having already been caught off guard in one of the republican debates by the term, meaning he didn't even care to learn about something that simple. Then there was also his ignorance on Aleppo, which we've seen since then he hasn't learned any more about and relies on his poor bullshitting techniques to skirt around any question about it. Add to that his seemingly not knowing what free trade is, and then we saw some time ago that neither he nor his similarly "educated" son understand what a blind trust is (but, possibly worse than that, insist and pretend as if they do know). He personifies the term "dangerously ignorant".
not merely dangerous - this is weaponized ignorance.
weaponized dementia
that implies it's not his fault. He actively seeks ignorance.
Don't worry, pre-existing conditions will be covered. Don't bother yourself with the details, Trump certainly doesn't.
People don't seem to understand that the ONLY way to create a system in which pre-existing conditions are not a barrier to obtaining health insurance is to force everyone to buy in regardless. Honestly, that's it. You can't have it both ways. Flawed as it might be, an Obamacare-type system is the only way to cover pre-existing conditions effectively. It's not hard to realize that it's only cheaper to pay for health insurance when you are sick, that's literally the only reason why the system works in the first place. If you could opt-in to health insurance AFTER you get sick the entire system breaks down. The only real way to allow people with pre-existing conditions into the system affordably is to force EVERYONE into the system.
"We will cover the best preexisting conditions. They will be the best."
"No, YOU'RE the pre-existing condition"
a pre-existing condition called stupidity
Trump isn't just dangerously ignorant. He's *aggressively* ignorant. There is a difference between stupidity and ignorance. Ignorance can be fixed; you can learn things and revise your conclusions. Stupidity can't be. Not only is Donald Trump stupid, but he is clearly ignorant and refuses to accept new information.
Honestly, I think this is one of the things his supporters like about him. That blind bravado is something they seem to admire. It's like, he doesn't understand something, but he can handle it. Why would he learn about it when he can just bulldoze through it? Right? If you're confident and aggressive enough you can accomplish anything. Seems to be attractive to those who would rather yell than sit down and educate themselves.
In the video that came out the other day he was preaching revenge ... 10x what they do to you was an exact quote
Reminds me of a saying, 'ignorance emboldens the ignorant'
He also keeps saying "the cyber". It's clear he has no clue what that's even about. And day before birth abortions? Those are called c-sections, and they're not kill the baby. He literally thinks that the due date is a set in stone value. And that you can have an abortion right up until that date. No, you can't... You can have a miscarriage, or an induced early birth because of a threat to the child or mother etc. But he really doesn't get it that a day early, with a healthy fetus, is JUST A BIRTH and no one is kill that fetus.

This is never legally done on a fetus that is healthy and within days of coming to term. A procedure exists because, sad as it is, it's necessary sometimes when the fetus is brain dead / deformed / numerous reasons that DON'T INCLUDE "healthy fetus and mother". It's also labeled partial term because it's not a full term aborition. See, if you are a day away from birth due date, you're full term. You could have that baby that day instead, it's already developed, the due date is just an estimate based on statistics. Full term abortions ARE NOT occurring in any legal manner anywhere in the U.S. What you link to both describes a necessary emergency procedure - not an elective one - and the need for oversight, clear rules, and investigation into any facility that would break the law on this. If you're arguing that full term abortions ARE occurring as elective and non-emergency procedures, please provide specific evidence so that we may go to the police; That is, quite literally, murder, and any doctor knows this and will stay the hell away from any such procedure. Basically, this sort of advocacy is like a reverse of the gun issue:. Just because some criminals might use guns doesn't mean we should want to ban guns. We may want to regulate with betted background checks, and prevent enabling things i.e. no automated weapons sales. But to lump the criminals in with those who have a fun for their own protection is wrong, just as it is wrong to lump illegal abortions (murder) in with legal abortions that are often emergency and necessary (or occur long before the fetus has developed a brain function etc; abortions within legal guidelines).
This comment is so awesome that I reposted it to every instance of Groadee's reposting of that stupid jpg.
Thanks. I'd fix the typos from my phone keyboard, but people seem to balk when a post had the edited asterisk.
Don't forget 'the nuclear', which is 'very dangerous' and 'very important to me'.
Totally agree, and the nauseating thing is that the language he used coupled with the fact that NOBODY ON STAGE CORRECTED HIM left a huge impact on undecided voters who also might not know any better. Huge missed opportunity for Clinton. Huge.
My cousins literally think she poured bleach onto her computer.
It's a very expensive process...
Hey, my wife had one of those day-before abortions! He's 13 now. Seems to be doing well...
https://www.papermasters.com/images/partial-birth-abortion.jpg Did she do that to him?

I am the product of a 14-day-post-due date "abortion." If my mother hadn't "aborted" me, we'd both be dead. Overall, I'm pretty happy to have been ripped out of my mother's womb as a healthy, overdue fetus. edit: wording kinda makes it look like my mom died during the c-section. she is alive and happy as of earlier today when i last spoke to her.

Brütal. Got a higher res? That last frame's gonna be my next album cover.
Sixty day abortion survivor here, and perfectly qualified to kill Macbeth
> He also keeps saying "the cyber". It's clear he has no clue what that's even about. I actually think he literally believes that Hillary used bleach to delete her emails. He obviously doesn't know what bleachbit is because he claims what she did is massively expensive and bleachbit is **free** software, but he always just says "she used bleach to delete her emails". I think in his head she wiped down her hard drive with bleach...you know, like with a cloth (lol)
He's also said she "acid washed" them.
Yep
She is a woman after all and trump thinks woman should clean...
Guys, You should really be unbiased, because after 30 years of Hillary, how many wars have made America look bad? We were protectors of the free world, and we focused way too much on the Middle East to fight the Saudi Kingdom Wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, which aren't over btw, and Libya which Hillary messed up herself with Benghazi and not sending people after multiple requests and an army base an hour away. But no....Trump is the one who did this...He's not even president yet, Fear does that to us, we have to stop making mistakes off fear, because that's why we keep getting sold out.
Put the pipe down and step away from the keyboard
Uh, no, we focused on the middle east as a cold war proxy to fight the Russians. They were fighting the Afghans, and we funded the rebellion. This is well documented fact. Everything after that was the mess we started when we did that...
The fuck are you talking about?
You're right. He literally said that she used "expensive chemicals" at a rally in Florida.
I don't know why I keep Googling things to see if Trump [actually said them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOPXkeITZzY)...
Hahahaha, thanks for finding this.
What the actual fuck?
It shows a lack of basic understanding and logical thought. Why would anyone, who didn't want to have a baby, wait right up until just before the delivery date to abort the fetus? He must have been either thinking of c-sections or emergency abortions, but even that doesn't make any sense because in either case there's a pertinent and usually urgent reason why the procedure is performed.

> Why would anyone, who didn't want to have a baby, wait right up until just before the delivery date to abort the fetus? And even if they WANTED to, no doctor would do this. The women who are straight up dying or having dying babies have to jump through a thousand hoops to get an abortion; NO ONE would perform an abortion on a full term healthy fetus.
> It shows a lack of basic understanding and logical thought Isn't that how you would describe much of Trump's supporters?
I would describe both Trump and Hillary supporters that way.
Along with a large percentage have never had a passport or rarely went to college.
> He must have been either thinking of c-sections or emergency abortions No, he wasn't thinking at all. Just shooting off with the first thought in his head. He does that a lot.

No, he called on imagery that would affect most pro-lifers the most. A lot of them think what he described is what a late term abortion is, and they thought that long before he said it on national TV.
Ok I get you. What he said was calculated to cause outrage. He's saying these things and further entrenching ideas in people's heads and because he's saying it, some people won't question it. I'm often left speechless after watching him talk. And then saddened that people are buying into it without taking a step back and asking themselves whether what he says has any basis in reality.
Right some people believe it no matter how false it is
Lets not forget that he is also suggesting that our foreign policy should include war crimes.
Yes, but is that worse than Hillary, who seems certain to start a shooting war with Russia over Syria?
>If he wins, there is going to be the rudest awakening in history for the fools who have enabled him this far. The one point I disagree with you on. If he wins, he will do what he has always done while failing - claim he's actually winning, or blame someone else for his failure. The hardcore trumpeters will continue to fall for anything the con artist says. They'll blame Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, Vladimir Putin, the democrats, the republicans, Obama, the media, the devil, the Easter bunny...ANYONE or anything else, but blame but Trump himself. Or, god forbid, themselves for being stupid enough to put him in power. To think otherwise is being too optimistic and giving them far too much credit I think. He could have the most disastrous presidency in history, and these idiots would still be clamoring to vote for him again and give him a second term.
Perhaps. By the end of W. Bush, though, even half of the people who voted for him had has enough. He finished with about a 25% approval rating, right? Trump's butt-buddy Christie is around there, too. People are pretty good at ignoring inconvenient information, but not all of them can take it for years while it's being repeatedly smashed in their faces.
ya but the before he even sat down in the chair the same people that voted for bush where blaming Obama for everything that Bush did, hell there are trump supporters that think Obama was president on 9/11
I think the argument shouldn't be that he isn't skilled/smart, because your points, while I agree with them, are unconvincing to someone who doesn't. The argument should be made that the world isn't a fucking real estate market and tactics that lead to success there are insanely stupid when undertaken by the leader of the free world. That, and emphasizing that he has clearly not done his homework to be president. Mitt Romney worked out because Mitt was a governor and did his foreign policy homework when running. Donald Trump did none of the prerequisite work, and when the American people graciously gave him an extension, he still didn't fucking do it.
He thinks he can just make deals with everyone else for better trade rates, whatever that means because that's utterly boiling down a complex number of a million different things. He doesn't recognize that the U.S is barely 5% of the world population. We *NEED* other countries, and they have important needs and hundreds of millions (or billions) of people that THEY are going to fight for. What would Trump do, say no deal? Hold out for a better deal like in one of his businesses? Does he realize what that would do to trade, how much it would hurt Americans while he played his game lacking ay diplomatic tact? He is ignorant to the point that I truly believe if Trump actually knew the job he's trying to get elected to that he'd not want it in the slightest.
You know we are the largest economy in the world right? And since we have a trade deficit with almost every country on the planet, Im pretty sure most countries have a strong incentive to give us favorable deals and keep our business.
Our deficit and reliance on foreign goods, services, and materials we cannot get In anywhere near the quantity we have (looking at you, rare earth minerals and metals)... Actually that puts them in a position where wet OWE THEM and WE NEED THEM. In most cases, the other country has more bargaining chips than us in those deals.
Deals. It's not all about deals. You actually have to understand how a bill gets made a law like we learned in 8th grade civics.
That's one of the things that irked me early on about the "well, maybe a businessman in the White House would be a good thing" argument. The United States isn't something that can be wagered in deals. It's a country. Additionally, Trump generally closes big deals because of his reputation *and* he can't fucking lose. If somebody says no, he just goes to their smaller competitor, proposes a good looking deal, and cannibalizes them. They think it's a wise move because "oh shit, business with Trump, there's no way we can't win." His supporters don't seem to understand you can't bully foreign leaders like owners of a hopeful company. You can't tell another nation you won't work with them and to go fuck themselves, because it has serious ramifications for ~320 million people.
I mean, we did have a lot of clout to built leaders to an extent at one point, but we've lost most of that credibility and relevance on the world stage... Outside of exercising or military might. Which, sadly, is exactly what he'd think we can do to get countries to do ort bidding... On basically every other political front, we're more dependent on other countries than they are of us.
That would require a degree of self awareness that he is incapable of.
If he wins, and assuredly does nothing and very likely makes so many things worse, his supporters will just continue to blame liberals and immigrants for the problems he caused.
Well, let's hope he doesn't win... i think Hillary is the only one qualified to lead us into war with Russia. \#DraftOurDaughters *EDIT: Why the downvotes guys? My position on Russia is exactly in line with Hillary. Is that a controversial topic among supporters?
> If he wins, and assuredly does nothing and very likely makes so many things worse, his supporters will just continue to blame ~~liberals~~ Lie-berals and ~~immigrants~~ drug traffickers and rapists, for the problems he caused.
Hell they did they were still blaming them when the GOP controlled both houses of Congress from 2003 to 2007 and the executive branch under Bush Jr. Yet if you listened to Fox News during that time you'd think otherwise.
It's all those liberals in the congress!!
Yup, they'll say he was [stabbed in the back](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stab-in-the-back_myth)
"We could've been great again if those liberals and illegals weren't always causing problems."
Why didn't we stop him from running, or beat him in the election? We had all this time, when are we gonna do it??
Actually the Republican Party will say "he's not a real conservative and we need true conservatism to fix our problems, so no more gay stuff and abortions okay?"
If he wins, he won't even _be_ president for that long. I wouldn't put it past the House to be secretly planning a quick impeachment trial so that a "real" conservative gets put in place. The house republicans for Trump right now are probably the ones in on the impeachment plans.
Admittedly they're also making impeachment plans for Clinton so this will be an interesting January no matter what happened in November
It would probably get worse in fact. Because if Trump couldn't produce a solution then there would need to be... you know, a more substantial solution of some sort.
Yeah, not all these temporary solutions politicians constantly try to sell us...
you could say it would be a final solution
So some solution that's going to solve something forever? What kind of final solution would you be looking for?
Sadly this is probably true.
Yup, only some will realize.
Yeah All his failures will be because "Obama" "rigged system" "liberals" etc...
Member when Hillary blamed the GDP in 2016 on George Bush?
Trump fuckers gobble and lick up that rhetoric though
Either because they aren't smart enough or too apathetic (just kidding on that one) to learn.
"How dare you be conscending and intolerant of their beliefs! I was voting for Not Trump up until this very moment but now I've decided to vote for Trump because of this Reddit comment." -Every Trump supporter on /r/politics today
Did someone do this? Please link.
[Here](https://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5a6d7k/thanks_to_trump_we_can_better_understand_how/d9e73vi/) was one that I recall.
If you look at the comment history of anyone claiming you swayed someone to vote against your preferred candidate, they generally have told multipe other people the same thing.
Haha. In the post about accepting that the right is super extremist and the left is not, there were a bunch of people claiming to be moderates but having "genuine" issues with SJWs. Turned out on asking for clarification of actual beliefs that they did in fact share the extremist views of gamergaters, MGTOWs and the whole alt-right shebang...
We need to vote in the midterms. Switch the house, keep the Senate, and let them whine. They don't deserve consideration if their viewpoint any longer- they nominated a reality tv guy to be president.
Okay, seriously, if Trump is so horrible, why can't someone amazing like Hillary beat him? I mean, if she's so great, why can't anyone come up with a reason to vote for her other than the fact that she's had 30 years to fix America, and yet she keeps getting caught selling out our country to Middle Eastern interests....We already have multiple wars we are fighting and we 20 Trillion in Debt....but no, we should fear Trump? Not Hillary who had decades in politics to stop these wasteful policies?
Do I really need to remind you which party invaded Iraq?
Well for one, she is beating him, soundly. The most conservative estimates right now give Trump less than a 25% chance of winning. And she happens to be a politician who has had to fight dirty to get where she is, and is running a campaign as if it were the 90s where that would all go unnoticed. Those are the only reasons this even looks like a competition.
Yes why didn't Hillary as wife of the president, one of a hundred senators, or as a single administration official fix all problems ever? She clearly had unilateral control of the entire government and no opposition whatsoever.
Hillary is not God. There's only so much one person in Washington can do.
If there's only so much one person in Washington can do, why are you guys shitting yourselves about how bad Trump will be for America? There's only so much he can even do if elected, right?
The president has significantly more power than a junior senator.
If you don't even know the difference in power between a senator and a president, I don't know how to help you.
The president certainly doesn't have unlimited power, but he has enough to do damage if he makes stupid decisions
Like rape? Because I heard Bill Clinton is a rapist.
She has not had 30 years in politics to fix "America" or whatever problems concern you. She had her first elected or appointed role in politics in Washington (so on a national level) in 2001, and served in some compacity until 2013. Math! Even if you want to count her time as a politician's wife, she was still living in Arkansas during much of your cited time period, and has been retired for years since. Yes, Trump ads cite the thirty year number, but it is dead for rights incorrect. Also, she was not in a position to "fix America." She served as one of one hundred Senators, so think about that, she had 1% power just in that chamber, and then you have the House and the presidency. She was not a goddess. Finally, those multiple wars were started under Bush. Trump's ads cite all these things, but they are funny in a "seriously!?" not a "ha ha" kinda way.
It boggles the mind how much Trump expected her to do as a junior senator. Change the entire tax code? Bring peace to the Middle East? Easy peasy, why didn't anyone think of that?
And then people act like treating them with respect is going to solve any problems. It's really hard when these are the people who believe absolute bullshit, or after 8 years of yelling that Obama is gonna take their guns, they just say the same thing, but switch to Hillary. There's never the "maybe that didn't happen or isn't going to happen" moment of lucidity for these people.
Welcome to Australia, the current government has been in power for more than 3 years and is entirely ineffective, but they just blame it on the opposition.
Kind of like Obama for the last 8 years
It's just like that here. The Democratic party never actually accomplishes the things it claims to want to pursue, because they're too corrupt, but then they just blame the Republicans for their "obstructionism".
Except Australia is parliamentary so a majority is required for governance. America can (and has had) a divided government. You can't just put scare quotes on "obstructionism" and erase all the evidence that it happened.
Australian here, that's not true. In the Westminster Parliamentary system, the power to govern lies with whomever has a majority in the House of Representatives. You don't have to have a majority in the Senate to govern, although it sure helps if you want to change or pass new laws. It's very similar to the US government system, with the chief exception that the the Australian Prime Minister and Cabinet (equivalent of the US Executive and Cabinet) are all elected members of the Parliament (either the House or the Senate). The majority party (or parties, in the case of the LNP Coalition) gets to choose the PM and the ministers of the Cabinet. From 2013 until this year's July elections, the Australian government (LNP Coalition) held a solid majority in both the House and the Senate, ergo had the power to pass bills essentially at will. Yet they mostly spent 3 years buggerising around. The real cause for all their dillydallying and getting little down was mainly internal politics and power struggles. The far right are pushing a stack of policies which the centre-right wing,which the present prime minister belongs to, aren't fans of and above all, know full well that the public as a whole don't support and will punish them for at the polls. What the LNP Coalition did manage to get through in that time is why in the July 2016 election, they barely managed to hold onto a majority in the House and completely lost their majority in the Senate, leaving them dependent on making deals with independents, who make up 20 out of 100 Senators, to get anything passed.
Lol
Sounds like the Obama administration, less his name sake program that is becoming an even bigger burden on the middle class.
My understanding is that Australia's borders have never been stronger with your current prime minister. A little reading shows that your previous leftist government admitted they fucked up by opening the borders, and the right wing needed to put a lot of effort into fixing the damage. Welfare for immigration *never* equates to welfare for the working class.
But there is the ever so slight issue of the human rights abuses.
People were dying by the hundreds taking the trip because of the incentive that your previous government gave them. You stop the incentive and at least you stop the deaths - we're seeing that death and hardship when people are crossing 7 nations to get to their desired welfare basket in the EU right now. Without a border you don't have a country because world-wide welfare is unsustainable Regardless, you're not getting the people who really need help anyway! It costs serious money to go through smugglers and the genuinely downtrodden wouldn't be able to get the resources to deal with those snakes. These are people who should be making their own countries better. I used to think the idea of allowing refugees free passage was sustainable until I watched this video years ago. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPjzfGChGlE I consider myself open minded, so if you have any argument to what Mr. Beck says in that video I'd love to hear it.
You're responding to a 13 day old account that is anti-semetic. Don't waste your time.
Pshhh! Those? Why make a big deal about those?!
>they fucked up by opening the borders, and the right wing neede to put a lot of effort into fixing the damage. The highest number of boat people recorded was in 2012. We had just over 17,000. The previous year there were under 5000, much closer to the typical yearly rate, and coincides with worldwide and regional conflicts. Hardly a large amount of "damage". Look at immigration for any other country and you'll see that it's a marginal impact in Australia, and not something that should require millions of dollars and the use of armed forces (and associated costs) to "deal" with. It's true that there was more immigration under the previous government, but no evidence to suggest that they were guilty of the myriad of issues they were blamed for. There has been less immigration under the current right wing government, however it has come at the cost of human rights abuses, and serious damage being done to our international standing. People will see the current government's efforts as a "success" if they disliked immigrants in the first place, however the reality is that they've spent goodwill (and millions of dollars) chasing a bogeyman of their own creation- particularly galling when so many other issues (eh. The deficit) were previously claimed to be such terrible things by the right wing government when they were trying to retain power. Also - were surrounded by ocean. Probably the biggest fucking incentive for refugees to go someone else, which has already limited immigration to a trickle, and we're still being told it's going to destroy the nation. It has also paved the way for hard right/alt-right groups like "the United patriotic front", the "rise up australia" party, and the resurgence of renowned right wing xenophobe, Pauline Hanson. The thing to realise in Australian politics is that the right wing party has recently tried to create a single issue that they claim will cause the sky to fall at the beginning of each election season - whether it's the deficit, boat people, refugees throwing children overboard, interest rates, etc - there's one issue which they claim will cause the destruction of life as we know it unless they're in power. Then once they get/retain power, it turns out its not such a big deal after all.
I agree with most of what you've said but I'd be hesitant to use the term "right wing" or "left wing" on an international forum when discussing the two major parties in Australia. Neither are truly one or the other.
Oh wow an intellectual answer based on research and longer than 5 words ..
Welcome to liberal run America
Same in America. If I remember correctly the last 8 years were bad because of bush
I kind of agree with you, but it's kinda hard to be effective when your legislation is being blocked from passing the Senate.
Add to that Pauline waiting in the wings. we have our own trump card ready to pounce.
Thankfully there is no system to allow Pauline to be nominated for either of the majors and if she did try to debate anyone she'd be ended. When trump starts calling people,nasty,low energy, puppets etc Pauline gets speechless and teary (credit to her for not being quite as big a bully as Trump )
Close the borders, to everybody but big business, kill the reefs and approve dumping of water into oceanic waters. Oh and incentivize coal over renewables. Every story I hear fromAustralia lately is depressing.
The shit happening to the Reef is so hard to hear about. I hate that our countries prioritize profit over a livable, enjoyable fucking planet. Can't fix our environmental problems cause we need to make sure we have JOBS for the generations to come, so they can afford to survive the cataclysmic storms, sweltering summers and bitter cold winters.
Welcome to New Zealand, where we've had the same situation since 2008.
And they're probably going to get elected again next year, too.
Welcome to the UK where we blamed everything on the EU, then because low-information voters believed it, voted to leave it. I foresee us continuing to blame everything on them after we leave.
As if the last two UK governments haven't blamed the slowest recovery in 200+ years on the opposition...
Welcome ta Earf
Most people have real expertise in only a couple of areas. Trump did well in New York real estate, and failed at almost every other venture. Like Trump, I have opinions about things that I don't know much about. But I don't question the methodology of the people who have built successful careers in their chosen fields. Trump, on the other hand, is the kind of person who will watch an episode of *House* and use the information to tell his doctor that he's misdiagnosing his patients.
Well said, and ironically, I'm watching House right now.
(Coincidentally)
Yes, better choice of word. :-)
"I'm hearing it's not lupus! All the smartest people are telling it could never be lupus!"
Except the one time it was.
To be fair, everybody who owned property in NYC did well in real estate. The city looked like it was in a sharp decline then had a renaissance and resurgence to become one of the most valuable cities in the world.
> Trump did well in New York real estate Nope. Turns out, not so much. >Mr. Trump has underperformed the real estate market by approximately $13.2 billion, or 57%, since 1976, http://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-donald-trump-left-13-billion-on-table-2016-03-01
This is my single biggest problem with Trump. The bigotry, the bluster, the overall immature character on display...that's all bad, but what's really dangerous is how shockingly uninformed he is. The guy exists in a Roman wilderness of ignorance. He doesn't know shit about the Constitution, law, separation of powers, foreign relations, domestic policy, or the US Military's role in the world. You know that guy at the bar who always says he knows better than every politician and quarterback and head coach and pundit? That guy ACTUALLY knows more than Trump. And just as bad as his total ignorance is his unwillingness to learn anything. He's intellectually lazy. He doesn't *want* to learn and fill the gaps in his knowledge. Sarah Palin is lightspeed stupid, but at least she tried to fucking study up after she was tapped for VP. The racist stuff, the sexist stuff, the arrogance and dishonesty make him a shitty person, but his ignorance makes him truly unfit for office.
I'm pretty convinced Trump couldnt point out Iraq on a map
I'm pretty convinced 90% of Reddit can't either (you included)
There is a saying that the more you know, the more you know you don't know. Trump never even made it to that threshold.
Oh enlightened one. I'm sure you've broken that threshold as well
In his ignorance, Trump reminds me of my five year old son. If he doesn't like or understand something of how the world works, he makes up his own explanation of how things should be. Difference is I'm sure my kid will grow out of it once he learns to read, and learns he can't bend reality to his own taste and understanding.
couldnt have said it better. and it's really sad the amount of people who lack the capacity to appreciate how ignorant he is too. I cannot imagine being a voter who legit thinks he did okay on policy in the debates.
He would be a terrible NFL coach or owner. Worse than York.
His ignorance makes Dubya look like a Mensa member. And that's saying something.
Dubya was actually an intelligent guy pretending to be a lovable idiot to win votes (go look at some of his debates and speeches when he ran for governor of Texas). Trump is actually an ignorant, uninformed idiot pretending to be a business genius... well, pretending to be a genius in every subject. That's scarier because at least "dumb" Dubya was surrounding himself with, aside from Cheney, fairly intelligent people like Colin Powell. Trump would be intimidated by anyone he perceives as more intelligent than him and would therefore most likely surround himself with ideological "yes"-men.
And the vengefulness. Don't forget the vengefulness. He brags about how much he values revenge. So let's give this guy who brags about how vengeful he is the most powerful military in the world. What could go wrong? /s
How a bill becomes a law: Junior Senator Clinton proposes it, votes on it and signs it. Now a law.
> The guy exists in a Roman wilderness of ignorance Great line, btw.
It really is.
Mine is "he's standing on top of the mountain of bullshit the GOP built."
Every time he opens his mouth about the US nuclear readiness, arsenal, and delivery capabilities I want to throw something through the tv. His repeated insistence that Russia is ahead of us because we are still flying B52s is just fucking nuts. First, we keep using the plane because it fucking works and can haul a huge amount of ordnance, and focusing on that is ignoring the B1, B2, and god knows what other secret programs. Second, it's like he's never heard of ICBMs, SLBMs, nuclear armed cruise missiles, our decades long clear advantage in miniaturization and targeting that let us take advantage of MIRVs, or our constant testing and modeling on computers or in facilities like the NIF and others. I'm not in the military, not in the industry, yet I know about those things just through passing interest. That motherfucker is running for president and seems to know less about our capabilities than my 75 yo mother.
Donald Trump Does Not Understand The Nuclear Triad
Trump's comments on our nuclear capacity reminds me of some of those yahoos who think our navy is weak because we don't have as many boats as we had in 1945.
And Russia is still flying their B-52 equivalent (the Tu-95). It's seriously not hard to google these things but somehow he can't.
They aren't even secret programs anymore, the airforce concluded bidding on the LRS-B program about a year ago; Northrop Grumman is committed to delivering the B-21 Raider by 2030. So even if Trump was right (which he wasn't) about the liability of our B-52's, we're already on it. It's just mind numbing.
> LRS-B I heard about that, but the way it is being discussed so openly makes me just wonder about what the secret programs are. If I had to bet I'd say that there is probably a long range, hypersonic strike aircraft in the secret program arsenal at this point. If you can hit command and control in the opening hours of a conflict with aircraft that can't be easily taken out, then it doesn't matter if the enemy also knows about / has been prepping for your 30 year long public stealth strategic bomber program.
If the main objective is deterrence, it makes sense to make this public. You wouldn't want Putin to think he can get away with pressing the red button because he doesn't know for sure the US can hit him back.
Wouldn't be too shocking, we had some stuff that theoretically hit the scrap bin when we were looking at potential SR-71 replacements; a payload carrying hypersonic drone could probably have been born out of those if anyone were interested in the opportunity. Hell, for all we know, Lockheed has had 20 years to refine its SR-72 concept down in Skunk Works.
I always refer to the F-117 Nighthawk program. It flew and deployed out of Dreamland for years before it was declassified enough to be talked about openly. Any future tech being discussed is either already obsolete or a distraction from the real-deal shit flying out Edwards or 51 that would completely obliterate our minds. Also remember this: Though an outdated example, during WWII U.S. intelligence didn't know the Mitsubishi Zero existed for quite some time, because during that time, no allied pilot survived an encounter.
>He's intellectually lazy. He doesn't want to learn and fill the gaps in his knowledge This is not because he's ignoring learning. He just is too egotistical to realize he doesn't already know everything. He seriously thinks all he needs is application of whatever goes through his head and that will somehow transfer to anything and be a success. He's so blindly ignorant it's insane.
Yes, it's clear there's something wrong with the way his mind works. Presumably narcissistic personality disorder.
> He just is too egotistical to realize he doesn't already know everything. To me, the most disqualifying thing he's done so far was his repeated insistence on the guilt of the Central Park Five. Despite clear evidence he is pathologically incapable of admitting his judgement was wrong. His ego is so fragile that he's immune to changing facts and realities. Once his mind has been made up, no amount of outside evidence will change it. That is truly an abysmal trait for a leader.
Similar to liberals who had their minds decided about Trump over a year ago
It's not rocket science when he's clearly insane. No DNA evidence is going to change the words coming out of his mouth (DNA evidence exonerated the central park five years later, yet decades after that he refuses to accept it).
As an Australian pls don't fuck it up. The rest of the world is looking at you guys going wtf is going on and terrified he is as close as he is.
Let's be honest: Him being where he is, having gotten this far, has made America look utterly awful. Not just him, but his millions of ignorant supporters. I'd say America is a laughing stock but more than half of that laughter is, like you say, pure terror. I hope we can stem the bleeding before it gets worse, but the damage to our image is already going to be lasting.
This fits Trump supporters as well. They ignore facts otherwise that would mean they're wrong and their egos can't accept that.
Have you looked at r/the_donald lately? I've been skimming it at least once a day out of morbid curiosity. It really is an alternative universe. It's a case study in despair and willful self-delusion.
Please explain. The Donald has gone from a shit posting Haven to, essentially, a news source. The sub was a mess for a few months in the primaries but if you're a Redditor, I can't see you disliking the Donald (except for their content obviously). The people are funny and honest. I see people calling each other out for falling for false headlines. Looking at this sub for the first time in months is like looking at a fantasy world. You people are still saying the same exact things you've said for over a year. You're ignoring revelations coming out through all sorts of leaks. You're falling for false headlines and are too proud (and thirsty for actual substance) to admit when something isn't true.
Good joke.
Sounds great until I go to the site and see the the top post is the site is "The inevitable arrest of Hillary Clinton" by Pepe the frog.
Yes, I'm happy to explain. r/the_donald is an alternate universe, filled with despair, and willful self-delusion.
>news source Sure, in the same way that, say, InfoWars or a schizophrenic man ranting on a street corner are "news sources"
I've been banned from there long ago lol
Many of his supporters who don't think Trump University was a scam are old enough to remember commercials in the late 80s and 90s for "Earn Money in Real-Estate!" Not all was his, but the scams were big
About 80% of those guys ended up in jail.
And that's why he's *truly* dangerous. Is there anything scarier than a man with immense power who knows nothing but thinks he knows everything? Jesus Christ, he *has* to lose. We are so fucked otherwise.
> We are so fucked otherwise good, fuck you and fuck Clinton.
"good"? You do realize that "we are so fucked" includes you? You do realize you live on this planet too? You're going to be affected by whatever happens. God fucking damnit I hate young people.
No there is not..
so get out and vote and tell all your friends to vote....a non vote is a vote for trump.
Don't forget his extremely short temper, his impulsiveness and how he asked his advisors *why the U.S. has nukes if it doesn't use them*.
This is Trump. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnVW96xvFFg
He's so thin skinned he literally needs to respond to mean Tweets at 3 am instead of trying to sleep. like normal people.
He's running all over the country. How much sleep do you think he could get if he wanted it?
This is a guy that promoted *shooting* at Iranian Navy ships for making "rude gestures", because that 'would not start a war'. Methinks he'd be the first one *calling* for a war if the Iranian Navy shot at ours for any reason whatsoever.
But somehow Hillary is the warmonger...
She IS a warmonger. We're almost certain to get into a shooting war with Russia if she wins. With Trump, who knows. But at least he doesn't seem to want to get into a conflict with Russia. And it's impossible for the President to launch nukes by himself anyway; there's a giant process there to prevent that from happening. He doesn't actually have the power to unilaterally launch strikes.
"Get into a shooting war with Russia if she wins" I assume you're referring to her no Fly Zone plan? I looked it up, and while it is problematic, it's far more reasonable than people claim. Essentially Hillary Clinton wants to use NATO to force a no fly zone in Syria in order to stop Russia from bombing rebel forces and civilians. She's hoping that with the combined leverage of NATO, that Russia will be forced to abide by it. The only way this potentially leads to a war with Russia is if Russia decides to ignore the no Fly Zone and Hillary Clinton gives the order to shoot down a Russian plane. Then Russia has to declare war on the US. Putin isn't likely to do that, because that would be a catastrophe for all parties involved. He's likely going to just abide by the no fly zone or find some different methods of making sure it doesn't stat up at all. I'm no military expert, but the idea that Putin is going to risk going to war with the US just so he can continue to drop bombs in Syria is a stretch.
I remember when people were almost certain that W. was going to invade Iran. And he had actually already invaded two neighboring countries. Although, by your second paragraph, it seems your understanding of what the President is capable of doing is about on par with Trump's.
You are kidding about the nukes right. The process is streamlined to be as efficient as possible. POTUS gives the order, it is confirmed by SecDef, and military personnel execute. Trump will choose his own SecDef and he surrounds himself with yes-men.
That single line should have disqualified him. That thinking cost Barry Goldwater the election. But, they hate Hilary more than nuclear holocaust....
Because Hillary has policies that will lead directly to WW3. Russia will nuke Americans because of Hillary's poor decision making. It's ridiculous to call either one of these candidates peaceful.
He also wants spoils of war like barbarism. Even if the oil takes years to extract and cannot be sold or refined.
he literally is basing his view on war on a cliche line he heard once. "to the victor go the spoils" and using the "element of surprise" are well thought out and serious strategies to him.
> "He appears to not understand basic military activities." *Ya think?* Do you mean to tell me that a man who has proven time and again that he understands very little about several topics hasn't a clue about military operations? This is the guy who claimed John McCain isn't a war hero because he was captured, has advocated for the murder of innocent civilians who happen to be the family members of ISIS fighters, has advocated for the use of nuclear weapons against ISIS (who control towns and cities in the Middle East, so more murder of innocent civilians), and has claimed that he "knows more than the generals" who have spent their lives studying military strategy and the Middle East itself? Same guy, right?
>"She appears to not understand basic security practices." Ya think?
Yes, I do believe that's the guy.
He's a walking, talking, DunningKruger effect.
I asked in /r/AskTrumpSupporters if they really think he knows better than the generals. The answer seemed to be a collective "probably." I simply do not understand. He's a real estate tycoon. He doesn't read, he has historically followed his own assumptions over those of people more informed than him. How the unholy fuck would he know better than literally any military expert?
GOt a link to that thread? I'd love to see that lol
I got banned from that sub after getting an argument with 4 Trumpers that tried to defend his "anti-vaccine" statements using common anti-vaxxer tropes. I was told to go to that sub to debate the "educated Trump supporters" and it was worse than the ones you encounter out in the wild. Most of their arguments are just declaring Trump was joking and that's that, most of them literally don't know anything about Trump even. A lot of Trump's appeal seems to be that he's a blank slate people project their views onto.
He's *diffferrrreeennntttt*
> A lot of Trump's appeal seems to be that he's a blank slate people project their views onto. I think you hit the nail right on the head. A majority of his supporters are simply pissed off for one reason or another, and Trump gives that anger an outlet. They project their views onto him and say he speaks for them, but he doesn't speak for anyone but himself.
It's Brexit all over again.
The only thing Trump knows about the military is how to avoid service.
> The only thing Trump knows about the military is how to avoid service. Then why do almost all the generals and admirals endorse Trump? http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/retired-generals-admirals-endorse-trump-227755
Glad all those bigots are retired, it doesn't change the FACT he's a draft dodger.
88 = "almost all"? lol http://www.politicususa.com/2016/09/09/hillary-clinton-tops-trumps-88-list-110-generals-admirals-backing.html
To be fair, the military has failed in Iraq multiple times. Why expect anything different this time?
Heel spurs are the #1 threat to global health, folks. Believe me. Very, very bad. Obama gave them to me.
"Obnoxious real estate developer not well-versed in modern counterinsurgency doctrine"
But he sure thinks he is, which is the scary part.
The guy is constantly saying "That's not what Douglas MacArthur and George Patton would do!". I seriously think Trump did a middle school essay on those two generals and hasn't learned anything more about the military since then.
Sounds like he Googled "the best generals, the most tremendous generals" and read a wikipedia entry about Patton. He doesn't realize war has evolved over the course of almost an entire century.
Essay? Sounds like work. Probably just watched a movie or two.
Half the reason MacArthur is so revered is that he refused to acknowledge even the possibility that he could make mistakes, so it makes sense that Trump would love him so much
My military experience is playing Civilization, and even *I* know more than Trump
I hope president Obama is reading your post and hopefully will track you down in order make you a 7 star General. Our great nation is in dire need of a military tactician/adviser such as yourself.
Seriously, sometimes I think Civ should be required playing for anyone holding public office. If nothing else, maybe they'd finally stop trying to gut science spending, since they'd know that's a good way to get overrun by tank-driving Zulus.
I see you are massing troops at my border. Do you intend to declare WAR?
Why don't we do a scientific agreement with England, build that Giant Death Robot, and roll it over ISIS? We've got the uranium already and it'll be better in desert conditions anyways.
I heard he was supposed to play a game of Civilzation but dodged it.
Btw how is Civ 6? I played 5 but stopped when I would lose days at a time.
I'm enjoying it so far, it seems more complex than 5 was, and I think i like it better, but i'm still pretty new to it.
Not a fan, honestly. I mean it's ok but it kinda feels more like EU4 to me. It seems much more in-depth and strategic but all I want to do is get a big army and go around the world beating the hell out of people
Get it. There are still some issues with AI (e.g., diplomacy) that are likely being worked on but, really, it's the only negative thing that I can say about the game.
Which has been a negative for the entire history of Civ. So I say, if unmodded Civ is fun in any of the previous games, VI is a definite improvement in almost every area. Even the AI, while a bit weird, still feels better to me especially with more transparent motivations this time around.
Haven't gotten it yet; Civ is incompatible with having time to canvas. And eat ;)
> I played 5 but stopped when I would lose days at a time. They never did fix that bug. So far I like it, go about 20 hours in so far. It's a lot more complete than the vanilla Civ 5 was on launch IMO. The district system takes a while to get through the learning curve but once you figure it out I think it's a really neat addition.
Is it any faster than 5? hated waiting between turns
I think it's a bit slow, but then again it's right after launch so they might be able to optimize it yet. Still super slow end game with bigger maps, but that's to be expected.
Maybe we should do a kickstarter to gift Trump a copy of *Civilization* for Christmas.
[removed]
So....we shouldn't get him a copy of Civ?
Or he frequently posts in popular subs, usually saying things that a lot of people find funny or relatable. Its not that hard to get Karma my dude.
Better make it 5 until 6 gets another patch and maybe an expansion.
He can have his charity buy him a copy
People would be like "Trump has really maintained a low profile since the election." Nah, he's just having a really tough time finishing off Napoleon
Might as well, not like he'll be busy after next week.
Can you imagine if Trump became even less productive, though? 4AM tweets about "LOSER Ghandi only has 3 cities and a tiny military, SAD!".
He was productive before?
Well he's at least doing rallies.
And I'm wanking to online pornography, I wouldn't call either 'productive.'
r/politics is porn?
Probably to somebody, but I'm multitasking.
I might start following him then. Trump tweets about video games would be a lot more interesting than political tweets.
Or board games: "I'm playing a knight, Carl. Look at me, Carl, I'm blocking your sheep and taking a card."
Fucking robber!
One hour later "Sid Meyers is pathetic. Rigged the game for Ghandi to Nuke me. Sad!"
"Super Smash Bros Melee is a poorly rated, failing game. The game was rigged against me when I got up smashed by fox. SAD."
Yeah, insult Gandhi, he's a [rational figure](https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--4uHRnRfT--/c_fit,fl_progressive,q_80,w_636/dnqxrzdmsdkud7fmsqyp.jpg)
i don't see y not. that's how i got started after all
Yes and frankly, your campaign for president has been astonishing.
thank u, thank u very much.
#***BIRKINBAGS 2020***
Slogan suggestion: *America could obviously do worse*
Yeah that seems like a good plan
He's very computer illiterate. He has articles and websites printed out for him, and has never been seen actually at a keyboard. He only, in the last couple years, started using Twitter on his own phone. Prior to that, aides would do all the tweeting for him based kn his response to things printed out and/or relayed aloud to him from the internet. He comes from a corporate culture where, for most of his life, typing was something secretaries and assistants did. And all his emails are still being dictated. He lacks basic computing skills. He'd not be able to figure out how to receive the gift.
But you should see his son! Barron is an absolute expert when it comes to cyber.
Good, he's in charge of cyber now. Boom. Dealt with.
He would have a horrible campaign and then complain that the game is rigged. I can see the tweet now "Sid Meyers is in the pocket of Crooked Hillary. Rigs Atilla to always invade me. US under-powered. Sad!"
He doesn't use computers lime we do. Except for recently (in the last few years) starting to tweet for himself rather than dictate responses to aides (based on things printed ourt or read to him), he's never seen actually using a computer. He likely can't type, and possibly doesn't even know how to use one beyond what his phone shows him.
I know, that is why I'm predicting he would get his ass kicked, even once someone explained the basics of the game and how to interact with the GUI.
Everyone knows that before you attack, you're supposed to first sell the other nation all of your luxury goods for a cash payment. *Then* DoW
Only in Vanilla and G&K. BNW made it so you couldn't trade lump sums of gold with anyone but your friends. And you wouldn't attack your friends unless you wanted to be known as Hitler 2.0 around the whole world.
Someone hasn't played VI yet :)
Goddammit, that's in VI? Why the hell would they put it back in!?
They found new and innovative ways to brand you as Hitler 2.0. But they also broadened the methods to declare really narrow wars to win mass appeal. Want to liberate that city state? Want to get this other dudes religion out of your cities? Want to reclaim territory you lost? There's a war for that, and it can be beneficial to world opinion of you.
The AI is a hot mess tbh. If they offer you a trade, you can convince them to throw in all of their cities. Every time.
Non civ player here, can you explain ? :3
Basically if you delete one of the things they offer you and then click "what will you give me for this?" They will always offer you more than they did initially. You can repeat this as many times as you want and their offer will increase infinitely.
I don't see why we don't negotiate a right of free passage with ISIS so we can position our troops near their cities and then declare war.
Because on declaring war, your units are forced out of the territory
Barbarians don't have any borders anyway
Because after you declare war it pushes them back outside the borders, DUH
Only in Civ 5. In 6, you get a surprise war warmonger penalty but you can have your soldiers inside their borders
I am so damn sick of being called a warmonger by other civs who hold me to a far higher standard than the other scumbags they're so chummy with. Outrageous.
Oh shit. So *that's* the difference between surprise war and formal war.
No. Surprise war is declaring a war without denouncing them 5 turns prior to the war.
Because they would know we were there. A sneak attack is the only way to do things. Trump said so, and he knows more than the entire military command. He has the best strategies. Tremendous strategies. They'll never see us coming across a wide-open desert with tens of thousands of tanks and troops and planes. It'll be a total surprise. Trust him.
It's not just wide-open desert, it's the fact that the attacking forces had to take several towns on the way toward mounting an attack on Mosul. No offense, but you also don't get it.
> No offense, but you also don't get it. What I did was called a "joke." Perhaps it is you who does not get things.
ahem seehisusername cough
It blows my mind how he can stand there and say, we should do a sneak attack, and Trumpers take him seriously.
Let's pit Gandhi against ISIS and have *him* nuke them. They'll never know what hit 'em!
Trump is the best at 4D Blitzkrieg. Putin personally awarded him the CD key.
*sniffles loudly*
The guy literally said, "I know words. I have the best words." He's a fucking imbecile, on any and every level imaginable.
He knows levels though...
I love how the longest word in that quote is "words"
Donald Trump believes we should be dropping surprise nukes.
To be fair, Clinton also seems pretty inept when it comes to foreign policy/military issues. She still supports the [no-fly zone](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-syria-no-fly-zone-third-debate_us_58084280e4b0180a36e91a53) over Syria even though she herself has admitted it would cause many Syrian casualties while the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has also said it would basically bring us into war with Russia. So I think we should be honest with ourselves and criticize BOTH candidates on these very important issues. EDIT: Am I being downvoted because it's not a fair criticism, or because I'm being rude/off-topic? Personally, I never downvote people solely because I disagree with them as long as they're being polite and are contributing to the discussion in some way. I understand what I'm saying goes against popular opinion in a pro-Clinton subreddit, but I still think it's a fair criticism to make (even Obama disagrees with her on this issue).
Wanting to implement a no fly zone and the actual implementation are two separate things, and I trust Clinton to know the difference and adjust accordingly. I would imagine she s playing a propaganda game with the Russians- funnily enough, making a 'deal'. Part f negotiations- ask for more than what you want so you can 'settle' for what you actually want (like not bombing civilian centers). It's one thing we tend to ignore in our politics here- our presidents often say things knowing that other countries are listening. One of the most concrete examples was when our embassy was being attacked in Cairo and Obama went on Telemundo discussing how we weren't sure wether we could consider the Egyptians to still be an ally, we would have to wait and see. Then the Egyptian military moved in and protected our embassy. Now, it would have been wrong for Obama to go around the Egyptian President and straight to their military leaders, but he implied on tv that if they didn't get off their asses we would cut our funding for the Egyptian military (which is where our funding for Egypt goes). It's the same with not calling Russia an enemy when you are still negotiating Iran and Syria. This is chess, not checkers. Sometimes your public statements are meant to support dissidents in a country, but not quite openly. We have seen world stock markets respond to statements from our President, and even Senators. The general populace here has a funny way of viewing our political leaders, but in the real world most of our Senators have more power than most nation/ state leaders. Our President is the most powerful person in the world and we seem to have a huge lack of respect for that.
Anyone who says Clinton is "inept" about foreign policy is engaging in willful ignorance. "The Chairman of the Join Chiefs" is a particularly bad appeal to authority, because that's not someone with any more experience than she had, with regards to foreign diplomacy (Secretary of State is our chief diplomat - chairman of the join chiefs has much less related experience). And, specifically in that case, what the chairman of the joint chiefs said was not in fact a criticism of the policy she wanted to enact (ie: she wasn't planning on showing up and going "Alright, immediate no-fly!"). She wanted to move to create a no-fly *with* Russia. What you're describing is what happens when smart, informed people disagree about policy. This is something that also happens. When Trump talks about how he has to keep his plans secret because of the element of surprise, he's displaying all the knowledge of a highschooler. There's a difference.
> Anyone who says Clinton is "inept" about foreign policy is engaging in willful ignorance. Fair enough, but you can also say the same about anyone summing up Trump's foreign policy as: > Donald Trump believes we should be dropping surprise nukes. Which is what I was responding to with my criticism of Clinton...so I wasn't exaggerating nearly as much as that person above me who got a bunch of upvotes while I got a bunch of downvotes. I shouldn't have used the word "inept" since that implies she didn't know what she was doing. The reality is I feel she knows exactly what she is doing, and I just disagree with most of her past (and present) foreign policy positions (I'm also not a fan of Kissinger, who Clinton has praised many times as he was basically a mentor to her). Whether in regard to Iraq, Libya, or Syria...I've just found myself in disagreement with her too many times before. But I understand there are many other motivations at play in these policy decisions, and they're not all made simply with US citizens' best interests in mind. Nor are they made with the Iraqi, Libyan, or Syrian civilians' best interests in mind (obviously). There's a military-industrial machine functioning beneath the surface of our government that requires a lot more research for people to fully understand how it actually influences decision-making within our government. It's naive of people to think our politicians are these purely altruistic individuals whose only goals are spreading peace and freedom around the world. There's a lot of political/financial self-interest at play, and I recommend people do their best to try and understand how it all works as much as possible rather than simply take politicians at their word alone.
Not to put too fine a point on it, but making a bad argument in response to another bad argument (that other post you quoted) doesn't actually make it a good argument. But like, I mostly agree with this post. So I think we basically agree and got caught posting too-strongly-worded posts in an intentionally inflammatory thread. And your second paragraph, I'm mostly on board with.
Clinton is like a highly trained mercenary fighting with a rifle in a war that I don't support. I disagree with what she's doing, but have to admit she is good at what she does. Trump is like an untrained civilian carrying a rocket launcher and a duffel bag of grenades. Best case scenario, he only blows up himself.

> The narrative that you're pushing is JUST PLAIN FALSE. I'm not "pushing" any narrative...I'm simply expressing my opinion that BOTH candidates have dangerous foreign policy positions. Personally, I can't support either candidate for a whole bunch of reasons and this is just one of them. You are welcome to your opinion, and I am welcome to mine, but please don't act like I'm trying to be deceitful in any way by "pushing a narrative". I base my opinion of both candidates off of their publicly stated positions on a wide range of issues, as well as their actual track record.
The no-fly zone does seem like a bad idea. Trump seems to have no idea, though, which is my primary problem with him. Whenever you look at what he actually wants to do, it feels like it's completely different from the last time he was asked, rambling nonsense, or some combination of the two. He seems to me utterly incompetent. I believe the Clinton will listen to advisors and back down from a stupid course of action. Given that Trump can barely be kept from idiotic ranting on Twitter, I have no such faith in him.
> I believe the Clinton will listen to advisors and back down from a stupid course of action. Given that Trump can barely be kept from idiotic ranting on Twitter, I have no such faith in him. This sums it up right here. Say what you want about her response at a debate, the fact is that Hillary Clinton has the ability to admit fault and compromise. Trump has never given any indication that he has this quality, and has demonstrated at every turn the opposite. And if the facts disagree, he just lies after the fact or blames someone else. Edit: to clarify which Hillary I meant for the benefit of those that need such clarification
"Hillary has the ability to admit fault" I'm guessing you're not talking about Hillary Clinton, but some other Hillary?
Nah, I meant Hillary Clinton. You know, the one who has admitted fault and apologized for actions and words in the past (basket of deplorables comment, her vote on the Iraq war, super-predators comment) as you would hope someone with the ability to change their views and admit to (and learn from) mistakes would do. Willful ignorance isn't becoming, but it's not my job to change your mind, so have fun.
Her constant lies regarding the emails? Her health? The way she treated her husband's accusers?
Well, you asked about her ability to admit fault but I mean, go ahead and list the lies told by Clinton, and then the ones by Trump and we can have a meaningful conversation on who the biggest liar in the race is. You can also throw in how Trump treated Bill's accusers AND how he's treated his own, if you like, and we can talk about how both sides respond to accusations of assault. I'd offer to, but I know if it doesn't come from Breitbart, the Drudge Report, or Hannity it's just dismissed as rigged media anyway so I won't waste my time but feel free.
Not sure why you assume I think Trump is guiltless. I also love how you assume I read/listen/watch any of those three, as I intentionally avoid them. You really love making assumptions, don't you?
No, those are just a few of the reasons why I don't engage further when talking to someone who moves the goalposts, regardless of why. Sorry if that didn't apply to you, or if I wasn't specific enough as to why I won't pointlessly entertain your deflections in particular but that's kind of my point. Ultimately if you're not interested in the facts or fair comparison, I won't waste my time. I don't particularly care why you aren't interested in the facts.
"Hasn't admitted to all fault" isn't the same as "can't admit to fault".
If someone asked me to characterize Reddit comments in 5 words, I'm not sure I could do better than "To be fair, Clinton also"
Is there anything wrong with pointing out that BOTH candidates have flaws in certain areas? Maybe I'm just tired of seeing such an incredible pro-Clinton bias in the **general politics** subreddit. If this was a Clinton or Trump subreddit, then I can understand all the downvotes even for politely making a fair point against one candidate or the other. In order to make a fair criticism of Clinton within r/politics, you have to try really hard to soften the content of the criticism...and even then you are almost guaranteed to get downvoted into obscurity. I just wish more people were capable of acknowledging faults even within the candidates they were supporting.
I agree, I just though it was funny how super Reddit-y that line was
Yes, there is a problem, if you're creating an obvious and absurd false equivalency. In order to make a fair criticism of Clinton, you have to make a fair criticism of Clinton. Your previous post was not an example of that.
Where is the false equivalency?
... the first post in this chain that you were whining about everyone disagreeing with.
How so? A nfz in syria is almost as absurd and viable as a surprise attack on mosul.
Good thing this post comes backed up with expertise and evidence and isn't just an uninformed redditor expressing an evidence-free opinion in overly strong language because they think that makes their point more forcefully.
> Is there anything wrong with pointing out that BOTH candidates have flaws in certain areas? That's so broad as to be meaningless though. "You can't condemn Hitler because Churchill also had some flaws". It's a pointless statement that just serves to obfuscate the truth of the comparison.
I'm not saying you can't condemn Hitler...I'm advocating that BOTH should be condemned for their flaws! Do you not agree it's dangerous for people to completely turn a blind eye to a politician's faults simply because the other politician is worse? I would prefer everyone be as informed as possible in as many ways as possible. But in this subreddit, there's censorship (via downvotes) surrounding anyone who makes a fair criticism of Clinton...and that's dangerous imo.
I don't think that makes sense in the context of this thread. In a post about Trump's incompetence, someone made a comment about his incompetence. Then you somehow assumed that people were turning a blind eye to Clinton's faults because they're not spending equal time condemning her in every single comment, or something. Yeah, Hillary should be scrutinized and criticized, but just because a given post or comment *isn't about her* doesn't mean that people are somehow being blind or being censored.
It may not make sense to you within the context of this thread alone, but the context within which I made the comment was after visiting the subreddit (a community for **general** political discussion) for the past several weeks and seeing almost nothing but links/threads that either defend Clinton or attack Trump. And almost every single time I've criticized Clinton in some way (in a polite manner), I've been bombarded with downvotes. It's fine for a majority of this subreddit to support one candidate over the other, and for the subreddit's overall content to reflect that majority opinion, but what I don't like is people discouraging discussion when someone voices a different opinion in a polite manner. Downvotes (imo) should be reserved for trolls, spam, or completely off-topic comments. This topic was about Trump's foreign policy experience/views on military interventionism in some sense, which is basically the only place on this subreddit I'm capable of discussing Clinton's views on the same topic since there's almost a 0% chance we'll see a negative article about Clinton's foreign policy hit the front page here anytime soon. If you're someone who disagrees with Clinton on many issues, do you suggest that person probably shouldn't participate in discussion on r/politics at all? Because my concern is that all the downvotes I've been receiving here have probably discouraged other folks from participating just like it's been discouraging for me. That's how online communities become nothing but echo chambers where any form of dissent is immediately silenced in the form of being buried by downvotes. And that mentality is toxic towards education/open-mindedness in general, in my opinion. People should always be questioning their own beliefs and considering alternate viewpoints. It doesn't mean you have to agree, but it's healthy to give it a fair chance sometimes (depending on the views/subject matter).
The problem is the degree of condemnation. It's absolutely a misleading false equivelency to just say "Hitler and Churchill both had flaws, and were flawed leaders". The reason they're even using that example is because we can view it through the lense of history to see the absurdity, but the point is highlighting the concern over false equivelency. And censorship? The few times there has been anything remotely anti-Clinton it's all over this sub, to the point of necessitating mega threads. It isn't Clinton supporters fault that there are significantly more concerning news stories about Trump. And before anyone gripes about the use of megathreads, the difference being Trump is getting negative coverage from a wide (and bipartisan) range of sources on his many, many troubling issues, not just a thousand articles covering the same story (Benghazi, emails, 9/11 collapse, emails) that take up the first four pages, all saying the same thing in different ways. Absolutely nothing wrong with giving coverage to legitimate stories on both sides, but to say "Oh see, they're both just as bad and if there aren't as many equally critical things about Clinton it's censorship" is disingenuous at best, willfully ignorant at worst. THAT is the false equivelency we're being asked to swallow whole, or else bias.
what you going to announce where you going to Nuke them so they can be prepared. What kind of liberal logic is this? If we are going to Nuke our preemies we get to hit when they are the least prepared.
His statements about nuclear weapons sound like the stupid shit my winger uncle says at Thanksgiving
And that is why everyone's right winger uncle is voting for him.
why are uncles so crazy? I feel like everybody has a crazy uncle who hates everything?
funny enough my racist uncle is somehow also one of the nicest guys in my family. argue pseudo-politics bullshit all of thanksgiving dinner but somehow he's a mediator in the rest of our family drama
Ya I don't think they are all bad people. Probably get along great with the people in their lives but if you mention something like gay marriage they say america has gone to hell lol
Seems like they might also be advising him
I hated the donald at first, but as time went on I grew to love him. Not because he's a good leader or anything, but because he'd be so terrible at what he does that he'd ruin the plans of the status quo within months. He'd stumble into everything they so carefully built and upend it completely and utterly. Hopefully a lot of people die in the process as well.
He would do nothing but let Pence run the country while he takes the credit. And as we know, thanks to masamunecyrus, Pence is fucking terrible for Indiana Pence got the endorsement from the much-liked former Republican governor Mitch Daniels (now president of Purdue) basically with the promise that he wouldn't pursue a social agenda. Mitch Daniels was liked because he focused almost exclusively on the economy and government efficiency. He gave no fucks about social issues, and it was implied that Pence, as the successor of Daniels, would set aside the social dogmas that he was known for and govern a state that was on a very good path, economically, after Mitch Daniels' two terms. He didn't do that. From day one, Pence didn't govern--he played national GOP politics. Whatever the big firey debate of the day was among the national GOP, he grabbed ahold of it and pretended to be its conservative crusader, even if it had absolutely zero relevance to the state of Indiana. He spent time, money, and resources on championing issues that Hoosiers didn't care about or didn't support, because he wanted to pander to the National GOP's ultra conservative base for his future career. Essentially, he was using Indiana as a stepping stone. He never cared about being governor. He always had higher aspirations, and the governorship was a stepping stone to a higher federal office. Most Hoosiers, left or right on the political spectrum, espouse this opinion about him. As I said before, Mitch Daniels literally gave no fucks about social issues. Indiana is generally a conservative state, but it's never been a state particularly hung up on social issues, and it's never been a state that follows the national GOP's social platform. Indiana has, for as long as I've been alive, been a business Republican state--politicians like the Bushes, Mitt Romney, etc. We voted Obama into office, and prior to Mitch Daniels in 2005, we had 16 straight years of Democratic governorship. Indianapolis, the capital and largest city in the state, routinely switched between Republican and Democrat mayors, and it has managed to have long-term plans and continue its momentum regardless of which party is in office. So Pence, with his national conservative GOP politics, has been an aberration that has directly harmed Indiana's image and its pocket book. In the three years since Pence took office, he: * Pushed through legislation making harsher penalties for drug crimes against the protests of numerous major legal organizations including the Indiana Bar Association, as well as most Hoosiers * Inherited a phenomenal state balance sheet from Mitch Daniels and used it as an excuse to push tax cuts so extreme (would have caused a tremendous deficit) that the Republican-controlled Congress shut him down * Tried and failed to amend the Indiana constitution to ban gay marriage, despite widespread polling that showed that Hoosiers didn't support it, and despite the vociferous condemnation of virtually every major business in the state * Since his gay marriage amendment failed, he literally, as payback (not exaggerating, the signing ceremony was invite only, no media was allowed or invited, but someone leaked a picture that showed Pence surrounded by well-known anti-LGBT extremists), came back with the Religious Freedom Restoration Act which was a genuine political circus. It humiliated Indiana on the national stage, directly harmed Indianapolis, and was met with, perhaps, the fiercest backlash by the people of any state in the Union. The extraordinary protests of Hoosiers and businesses allowed the state GOP leaders to basically coerce--to his visible chagrin--Pence to amend the law and "fix it" (this was actually the [front page](http://media.theindychannel.com/photo/2015/03/31/indy_star_fix_this_now_1427838279029_15914269_ver1.0_640_480.jpg) of the biggest newspaper in Indiana). * The RFRA was such a debacle that Pence ended up hiring an expensive out-of-state public relations firm to heal Indiana's national image. He couldn't answer why he chose an out-of-state firm. He couldn't answer why he chose such an expensive firm, when there are many firms in Indiana that could have done the job. It was eventually canceled, and was yet another waste of taxpayer money. To date, the RFRA has cost Indianapolis (a city that fought against it, changed the official tourism website to rainbow colors, and hung a huge rainbow banner at the airport) $60 million, and the total cost--to the economy and reputation--to the rest of the state is unknown. * During the gay marriage supreme court fight, he literally sent the Indiana attorney general to *other states* to advise them on how to craft their laws and fight gay marriage nationally. He did this on the taxpayer dollar. He continued to spend taxpayer money fighting gay marriage in the courts and with lawsuits despite, at the time, everyone knowing what the Supreme Court decision was going to be. It was basically a political stand by Pence; an expensive political stand that Hoosiers didn't support. * He fought to pass a law preventing cities from passing their own minimum wage statutes. Is this "small government"? * He has acted like a strongman (think Turkey's Erdoan), doing everything in his power to make Glenda Ritz, the state superintendent **and an elected official**, quit her job, and barring that, stripping her of the power given to her by the Indiana constitute and the Hoosiers that elected her through backroom deals, conspiracy, and highly technical legal challenges. Just Google "Mike Pence Glenda Ritz." You could write a thesis on it. * Everyone, literally everyone, was on board for receiving a *huge* federal grant for preschool funding. The Indiana Department of Education was literally in the final stages of the application process--and the federal government was happy with Indiana and going to give us an especially large chunk of money--when Pence came in and shut it down for no reason because accepting money from the feds became politically untenable among the national GOP tea partier crowd. And, of course, you can't be elected president--Pence's eyes were always on the future--without support from the GOP's far right base. After shutting down the process, he has recently been opining that it would be a good idea to get federal money to fund preschools... A year after he shit all over the Dept of Education's proposal to do just that. * The HIV epidemic in southern Indiana is out of control and among the worst in the country. Of course, we could provide free needles for heroin addicts like has been done in many states to curb HIV problems, but that is politically repugnant to Mike Pence. He also managed to get the Planned Parenthoods in that part of the state shut down, eliminating the opportunity for poor people to get tested. The HIV epidemic, which never had to be an epidemic, continues, and Pence gets to push the problem on our future governor as he goes to join Trump on the national stage. * Speaking of Planned Parenthood, Pence is highly proud of his accomplishment at passing the single most restrictive abortion law since Roe vs Wade. The law, HEA 1337 is far stricter than anything even in the Deep South and is almost certainly unconstitutional. He knows that it's probably unconstitutional. Nevertheless, Indiana taxpayers will spend millions of dollars for our attorney general to fight the law all the way to the Supreme Court, just so Pence could make his political statement. * He literally tried to make a state-run news agency that he would then give exclusive interviews and access to. I don't even know if that's legal, but he tried to do it and was promptly crucified by the media and even his own party. * He asserted authority to ban Syrian refugees from being settled in Indiana. He has no authority. No governor has. He knew that, but he was planning to be a GOP presidential candidate, and he needed to show that he was strong and anti-Muslim refugee to appease the national GOP base. He took leadership role in this discriminatory crusade, appearing on national TV to preach his ignorance. This particular event managed to throw multiple refugee settlement organizations into disarray--which, by the way, actually include the Catholic Church of Indiana (the arch bishop of Indianapolis publicly criticized the governor)--and several Syrian refugees which were well into the process of moving to Indiana had to be relocated to another state. Pence didn't back down until the courts affirmed that his order was unconstitutional. * He shut down a highly successful energy efficiency program--one of the first in the nation, making Indiana a trailblazer--initiated by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission with the support of previous governor Mitch Daniels. He did this for no good reason, other than to signal to his far-right constituents that he was fighting against Obama's evil despotic EPA. This is all just in his three years in office. He is reviled across the state, and especially so in Indianapolis. There is (was--now that he's the VP nominee, he can no longer be governor) a bipartisan *Pence Must Go* campaign to get rid of him, and there are literally [billboards](http://media1.fdncms.com/nuvo/imager/u/original/3821872/pmg_billboard.jpg) and [yard signs](http://media.theindychannel.com/photo/2015/04/17/16x9/_Fire_Pence__signs_go_up_after_RFRA_2839710000_16967639_ver1.0_640_480.jpg) plastered all over the city. Pence is, by virtually all objective measures, one of the worst governors in recent Indiana history, at least in terms of working for the benefit of the state. He has basically focused on far-right Christian social conservative interests to the clear detriment of all else, most importantly the current and future well-being of the state's reputation and economy.
They are. Read about Roger Stone, one of his long time friends and confidantes. Also one of the original ratfuckers (Nixon-era dirty tricksters) and an unrepentant bigot of immense proportion. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Stone
Why would he understand military activities at all? Even if he weren't a raging narcissist incapable of introspection and empathy, he still would only have a tenuous grasp of it. But he thinks he knows more than literally everyone, including the most keyed in people with lifelong experience. So yeah he's fucking Trump.
But have they considered a *sneak attack*?
Here's the plan... we hit them, really hard.
aim for the shins
Donald trump is a raid leader
He guys, my plan is to win! Lets go!
>Im speaking with myself, number one, because I have a very good brain and Ive said a lot of things. http://www.politico.com/blogs/2016-gop-primary-live-updates-and-results/2016/03/trump-foreign-policy-adviser-220853
Draft Dodgin' Don isn't a military expert? Well, colour me surprised.
This is shocking, up until I now he's had a reputation as a learned erudite.
"The smartest dolphin in the world may be smarter than Donald Trump" - fellow redditor
> 'He appears not to understand basic activities' Yeah
Trump told us his ritzy prep school made him regularly do Army Cosplay. So trust him, he understands.
He cybers with 10 year olds. And at least one 13 year old.
That made me think of them insulting his mum, which reminded me that there were a series of articles in The National (Scottish pro-independence paper) about how Trump's mum was a poor immigrant who moved to the US in search of work.
If you don't understand something, just claim you know more than the experts.
I hope you people posting here, joking about how stupid Trump is, are actually going to vote against him, or have already. All the jokes and all the razzing won't mean anything if he wins the election.
speaking as a foreigner go do that, I may be on almost the other side of the world but I still have to put up with US's shit.
I'm voting for Hillary in California, but more importantly my Parents are voting for her in Pennsylvania, specifically the Philadelphia suburbs. Almost everyone I know back home is voting for her as well, which is a huge change from what it used to be back there.
impossible, he went to a military school and has experience in his own private Vietnam via hookers and coke in nightclub bathrooms
A sneak attack by multiple militaries who aren't even our own against towns and cities with well over a million civilians? I see no way this could fail.
He doesn't understand basic political activities either.
> He appears not to understand FTFY
I mean yeah, he's a huge idiot
This is far more significant than Clinton's emails. People may die because of his idiocy should he become President.
Only one candidate has threatened military action against Russia. And it isn't Trump.
>Only one candidate has threatened military action against Russia. >And it isn't Trump. Why would Trump threaten his boss?
Nah Trump is Putins puppet.
You know this is about Isis, right?
That doesn't make my statement untrue.
People speculate left and right about how Trump *couldn't* do a good job, whereas Hilary has been in government and has *shown* she can't do a good job or stay within the ethical boundaries set.
Do you elect someone who's failed in the past but has learned from their experiences or do you just grab someone with no relevant skills whatsoever and give them the job?
> but has learned from their experiences L. M. FUCKING. A. O. Fck your cnt face stupid libturd.
You're almost as ignorant as Trump himself.
> but has learne from their experiences LMAO
Whereas people ACTUALLY DIED under Secretary Clinton's watch.
benghazi?
Yeah
Totally curious just to see a point of view, what, in your own words, do you think happened in Benghazi?
>Whereas people ACTUALLY DIED under Secretary Clinton's watch. And what would you have done with Benghazi?
Here we go again...
And obamas, and bushes, and clintons, and bushes and reagans etc.
I think people fail to realize that Trump's comments are in an effort to push an agenda that is undermining Obama's efforts in Iraq/Syria as to his actual opinion. The more he discredits Obama and the collective coalition in Iraq, it sells to voters and his base that electing Hillary would be 'disastrous'.
His statements sound like everyday Republican dumbassery as do most of his policies: build a wall, use nukes, deport illegals, ban Muslims, forbid refugees, etc.
"bring back jobs" ...who knew it was that simple. damn, no other politician has ever said that. I'm convinced.
And he would still be wrong. Everyone understands what he is trying do, and everyone does this type of shit but you will normally do it I such a way that you don't sound like a complete idiot on the domestic and international stage.
I wish everyone understood that. Yet he'll still pull in at least 40% no matter what, it seems.
If he does become President his impatience is going to get people killed
Is there anything he *does* appear to understand?
Words. He knows them. He has the best words.
And people still want this ignoramus to run a country, fantastic.
It is the exact same thing with every other policy initiative he has. He just repeats the one buzzword or strategy that he overheard someone else use. On law enforcement: stop and frisk On immigration: build a wall On cyber security: cyber On the Supreme Court: Scalia On military strategy: sneak attack Why should anyone be surprised by this? I've tried, over and over, to remain even the tiniest bit fair during this shitshow of an election, but the man is a moron. He may have made some good real estate deals, but he knows fucking nothing about running a country. The debate moderators should have stopped asking questions about policy and started asking questions from a basic US Government class. Trump would have somehow managed to do worse than he did. When he started running on his 'not a politician' stance, everyone came back with, 'you wouldn't hire someone with no medical experience to operate on you'. At first, I thought it was an okay retort, but with everything we know now, it doesn't even get to the half if it. Electing Trump isn't like hiring someone with no medical trianing to operate on you. Electing Trump is like hiring someone who has never seen a human body to operate on you.
Its not about whats right or wrong, its about what *feels* right or wrong.
That orange thing should have been put on a plane and shipped to Iraq to command the ISF in battling IS if he is so awesome. It would be tremendous folks, believe me.
"Trump... Appears not to read" will always be my favorite burn in an editorial.
But doesn't he have like, 200 generals and admirals who endorse him? /s
There was a letter from 88 retired Generals and Admirals endorsing him last month that got some play; the very next day the Clinton campaign announced the endorsement of 95 retired Admirals and Generals. The general takeaway: citizens of the United States have the right to make decisions to back whatever candidate they choose, and both campaigns can trot out impressive lists of endorsers.
People who play SC2 have a better time with military tactics. Trump doesn't know anything even if it was plastered all over some ass he grabbed.
I've got no military experience and even I can surmise that the announcement of attacking Mosel in a few weeks is designed to get the bigger cowards to run away so you can pick them off one by one as they flee.... away from the centre of Mosel.
It's also, you know, illegal and insanely unethical to 'surprise attack' a city with 1.5 million civilians in order to kill 5-10 thousand goatfucking douchebags.
That too...
I wonder how much military experience a *draft dodger* has.....hmm...
You weren't even born yet.
Trump doesn't understand anything, except how to manipulate people into buying his bullshit.
He really doesn't and I was surprised Hillary wasn't really ready to take it to him on this given in the second debate he literally said our military was stupid re: the Mosul operation and had no idea why we announced the invasion. He doubled down on the 3rd debate and I feel like he's really gotten a pass on this. Ultimately this is another issue space where Republicans have ceded all the high ground they pretend to hold: Republicans are behind a draft dodger who says our military and generals are stupid, and that heroes don't get captured.
[deleted]
Those were actually U-2 overflights.
Well he knows how to dodge the draft.
Is anyone shocked by this? He has no experience.
Why would this even be news? This is the same man who said he knows more than our generals do with regards to Isis. The man lives in his own reality.
Donald D(uck) Trump literally said Mosul was a failure. Meanwhile CHRISTIAN TOWN who has been persecuted by the terrorists: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/22/near-mosul-church-bells-ring-out-in-a-christian-town-freed-from/
He's right that it was a stupid decision to talk for weeks about retaking mosul though. Defectors/leaving civilians are being burned alive and paraded to prevent further defection, so all it really did was gave ISIS time to prepare weapons, fortify, hide their equipment from the air, etc. And i'm betting that those (very effective) kamikaze trucks that have been causing large casualties to forces on the ground were prepared after the announcement.
I beat Halo 3 on Legendary where do I rank?
In the basement. Your mom's basement.
Classic joke
I think Trump would do 1 thing only during his presidency. Grow himself. 1. Create some law that allows him to do whatever he wants. Until then, he rules with executive order, and send everyone to prison, he does not like. 2. Makes sure, that his family and business is untouchable. 3. Signs everything, that ensures, that all the money he can steal, he does. Every government contract 50 years in the future must go to a Trump company. Even if he does not make it now, he would force laws through, that Boeing is sold for $1 to him, because the law says so. Would be interesting to see a dictatorship in that scale. Horrifying, destructive, but interesting.
At least you'd only be getting robbed by one bloke instead of an army of them now. You think Halliburton and co doesn't already have this in place? Lots of companies are getting very very rich at the expense of you and I. And our governments allow it for the opportunity to be a hired consultant in X years. I
Trump is such a goddamn moron that he thinks a sneak attack against a city of 2 million people is the best strategy. How he hasn't been called out for this more in the debates is mind blowing
Be vawwway vawwwwy qwwwwwiet Twump is hunting tewwwowwwists...
These loser generals just can't keep up with the god emperor's 387.45D Jumanji.
Member when Trump said he knew more than our generals?
[deleted]
Who's surprised that this orange halfwit is clueless regarding military strategy? He speaks at a 4th grade level and has never read a book in his life. He's as ignorant as ignorant gets.
To be fair, most of you don't understand basic military operations. You couldn't if you tried. That's why presidents have mililary advisors and generals sitting around all dressed up so they can break it down to the president for a mostly informed decision.
Trouble is, he doesn't listen. Ever. He won't change.
Which he has had for a while and still doesn't get it.
So Trump says he will eliminate ISIS his first week in office. Let's say he is successful. Won't that make him responsible for every death caused by ISIS during his campaign?
More blasting!
Trump= "Worst disaster ever" Believe me
"He appears not to understand basic __________," says basic _________ expert.
He's [just trying to get ahead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bU6m5UqLx9M).
Good on you for carrying on the work of Jack Chick. The world really needed you.
He is so fucking stupid, that it is offensive to anyone with even 1/4 of a brain.
I'm not sure he is stupid as such. But he is underdeveloped, and mentally/socially he is not even a teenager yet. He has to be the best at everything, he has to constantly brag.
When he says he knows more then the generals do then yeah... I assume he doesn't have a basic understanding of the military.
I have a feeling the military wants the country in complete anarchy because every one I have spoke to is voting Trump, regardless of his ignorance to knowledge of the military itself.
I remember when not serving was a prerequisite to be president, especially for republicans. Now..."What does OPs stand for?"
What? Did he refer to a corpsman as a corpse-man? Oh right that our current military genius.
To be fair, he doesn't really understand much of anything, including stuff you and I learned in grade school, like how to behave in public and around women.
People made fun of Obama(lawyer) during his 08 run against Mccain(decorated war veteran and PoW). It was a hot topic and it was stated 100 times in the media. Even on /r/politics it would come up every day. In the end it did not matter because he has a ton of advisors and military's joint chiefs of staff to consult to help him as i'm sure trump or clinton would have as well.
Except Trumps advisors would probably be Sara Palin, and his family members. Plus you have to account for his narcissism. He would likely listen to himself over anyone else.
I don't ever remember President Obama saying that he knew more about a military campaign than the generals fighting in said campaign. Or criticizing Senator McCain's service record.
He never did, people were just saying he had no military experience at all and that made him unfit for President according to the media.
While I think I understand where you are coming from, the issue is that most people don't think Trump's lack of military experience makes him unfit for the presidency. It's that he's repeatedly made outlandish claims about knowing more about strategy than military professionals, wanting to commit war crimes (bringing back waterboarding and targeting the civilian families of insurgents), and has openly disrespected a veteran for being a POW.
He has military experience. He went to a military styled boarding school. He has also said that avoiding STDs in the late sixties early seventies was his Vietnam. /s
I'd be worried about Trump actually listening to them. One of my biggest concerns about him is his apparent inability to trust advisors and subject-matter experts. When he says shit like 'I know more than the Generals' it's worrisome. The President shouldn't be expected to know everything, but they should be willing to surround themselves with the best, most knowledgeable people whom they will actually take council from.
Weird because it appears Hillary has been the one that actually didnt listen to the experts, especially where her server was concerned.
I mean, he has a very experienced resource in Conway, and even she can't keep his fingers off of 3am Twitter. Imagine what he'd do with buttons that can cause real, tangible harm?
Clinton can't even tell if she is under sniper fire... ...Sorry, too easy...Could not resist.
pretty sure most people don't understand basic military activities. Not an excuse for someone who will be the commander in chief, but still could have worded it better.
"Most people" don't say they know more than generals in regards to military matters, though, and then go on to claim said generals are stupid for not launching a "surprise attack" on a city with well over 1.5 million civilians still occupying it.
right hes a bombastic fool, what I'm saying is "basic military activities" isn't the right term for it. most people don't get basic military activities, most people don't try to call generals stupid though.
he's running for president. he shouldnt be compared to the average lark
That's exactly what I just said. the average lark doesn't understand basic military activities, so to state it like so makes it less impactful.
there is a necessary knowledge gap between the president and an average american. trump is closing that gap and you dont think thats a bad thing?
I'd say hes not closing that gap, and that's the bad thing. Or you mean hes closing that gap back in the wrong direction? Cause yea, that would be a bad thing.
I would argue most people have better self-awareness
Trump is an idiot and it's okay I'll still vote for him :)
Why would you put an idiot in charge of your taxes, your freedoms, your future, and your country's safety? Please tell me, I sincerely want to know.
You're an idiot too then.
Yeah sure...200 plus high officers endorsed Trump. he is 100% right, why telegraph our movements. Let's be real. This is bogus and Business insider sucks royally. All they do is attack Trump. Let them keep sucking at the altear of Corrupt Clinton.
I don't know where this faith in his military acumen comes from- the man doesn't even understands the Nuclear Triad is- when he was asked what his priority for it was he answered, this is the genuine answer he gave, word for word:- >First of all, I think we need somebody absolutely that we can trust; who is totally responsible; who really knows what he or she is doing. That is so powerful and so important. >And one of the things that Im frankly most proud of is that in 2003, 2004, I was totally against going into Iraq because youre going to destabilize the Middle East. I called it. I called it very strongly. And it was very important. >But we have to be extremely vigilant and extremely careful when it comes to nuclear. Nuclear changes the whole ballgame. Frankly, I would have said, Get out of Syria; get out- >If we didnt have the power of weaponry today. The power is so massive that we cant just leave areas that 50 years ago or 75 years ago we wouldnt care. It was hand-to-hand combat. >The biggest problem this world has today is not President Obama with global warming, which is inconceivable this is what hes saying. The biggest problem we have today is nuclear  nuclear proliferation and having some maniac, having some madman go out and get a nuclear weapon. I mean, on one hand that's amazing- he manages to go off a tangent that ends up reading like a 13 year old stumbling through a debate he's not prepared for, on the other hand it's terrifying as he clearly had no idea what the triad was but couldn't even admit that publicly or ask for clarification as that woulds somehow be a weakness. Think on that. A presidential candidate has put so little effort into preparing for the job that they don't even know what the nuclear triad is. Hell, I knew what the triad was and I'm not even running for office.
there are over a million civilians, and the outlying areas have to be captured. the people in those areas would notify mosul. plus it's not like they weren't prepared. we're also talking about tens of thousands of troops being coordinated between multiple different groups.
You're right. We should have just crested the ridge during the night and surprised them with a gutsy charge! That's super easy to do with a 100,000 man army in the fucking desert.
Trump is right. We are fighting a 4th generation jungle/urban warfare with 3rd generation warfare tactics that is severely limited. This limited offense will never win or defeat 4th generation urban warfare. The only way to beat 4th generation urban warfare is to fight back the same.
Sure, you and Trump both know more than actual generals.
These generals only been hard wired to battle with 3rd generation warfare tactics, typical strategies you been seeing on TV, the way we beat Hitler. This is how Russia also lost in Afghanistan. But 4th generation urban warfare is what is happening now. That is why you see the US lose the war after US toppled Sadam and then the war was US against the Islamic mullahs. You have 4th generation soldiers fighting without rules and regulation who have no concern for civilian loss on both sides and call it an honor to die in battle versus 3rd generation soldiers and general throwing their typical arsenal in urban setting with severe limits due to political correct admins running the show. Nobody wants to get their hand dirty to beat this next level of enemy. Only way you can beat this enemy is to fight dirty like they do. We can learn a few from the Russians. We need somebody like Trump who doesn't give a damn about political correctness. This political correctness has cost us many US lives and it is only going get worse.
>We need somebody like Trump who doesn't give a damn about political correctness. Killing civilians is a matter of political correctness?
I apologize for not being clear. Yes, the civilians lives will be spared by a leader who is ruthless in fighting these Islamic fighters by using urban warfare that does not using Geneva convention rules of engagement. We need a leader who doesn't give a damn about political correctness while pursuing the enemy and fighting a dirty war against them such as political assassinations, urban warfare that may look horrendous by the liberal press and killing the enemy while their retreat. If you really care about civilians where is your disgust by Islamic fighters killing men, women and children right now. Political correctness is the cancer that we can only cure with something so opposite of it such as Trump. About time we balance the powers of political correctness with anti pc.
That will make the moral choice between supporting US or IS not matter anymore or matter even less. You have no idea how hated the US is world wide. You got baited by IS propaganda.
More like you got baited that we are the bad people and the radical Islamic culture is okay to accept. Who cares what others think. We are going to be hated no matter what. Did it matter what Japan and Germany thought of us. Noooooo At the end we did not appease Japan and Germany during WWII and worry about if they would hate us if we fought back. We need to fight to survive and keep usa safe. Your px attitude is exactly how we got into this mess. Islamic culture will always hate us no matter who we are and what we do. Islamic fighters only fight for Islamic domination and they will not rest till you and your family convert or suffer till you die. Sounds like you got baited by them
So what's your idea, throw a nuclear bomb into Mosul? What about Iran policies and the power balance towards Saudi Arabia in regards to Israel? What will you do with Iraq after having defeated Isis. It'll still be full of Sunnis being suppressed by a Shiite government which will just lead to the next group popping up. Isis isn't the disease, it's a symptom. Military tactics aren't the problem, it's the ongoing surrogate war between Saudi and Iran which can't really be stopped since the defense industry of both Russia and US depend on it, the only industries still blooming in both countries. I don't think the goal has ever been winning a war, it was always, keep the flame burning low and the balance up and sell more weapons, as cynic as it sounds.
>So what's your idea, throw a nuclear bomb into Mosul? What about Iran policies and the power balance towards Saudi Arabia in regards to Israel? Nuclear bomb = outdated 3rd generation warfare. The smart way is to slowly cut of isis funding by stopping the sale of oil, arms and heroin while doing assassinating top isis branches. It's easier to stop the funding than to attack isis. You stop the money flow and isis will die slowly. > What will you do with Iraq after having defeated Isis. It'll still be full of Sunnis being suppressed by a Shiite government which will just lead to the next group popping up. Isis isn't the disease, it's a symptom. You are correct. Unfortunately there is nothing we can do regarding the sunnis versus shiite oppression, it's their civil war and it will continue with or without isis. The This is where Sadam was so important to the region. He kept the peace with violence and being anti radical Muslim. He was a dirty dictator who killed easily, and sometimes you need this in this divided region land. > Military tactics aren't the problem, it's the ongoing surrogate war between Saudi and Iran which can't really be stopped since the defense industry of both Russia and US depend on it, the only industries still blooming in both countries. Russia and US depend on defense industry. But at what cost. Iran and the arabs fight dirty proxy wars all day while western worlds have their hands tight. As you notice I wrote it's time to play dirty. Play their ways and make them understand that us is not to be fucked with. Look at how many dictators we have removed and how much the area has been destabilized after Sadam, gadaffi, and now slowly assad is being removed. These Islamic areas do not do well when a violent dictator is removed. These areas do not believe in separation of church and state and the most dangerous human beings on earth are mullahs with power. It's like giving Westboro baptist Church Supreme power over a nation of millions. > I don't think the goal has ever been winning a war, it was always, keep the flame burning low and the balance up and sell more weapons, as cynic as it sounds. I don't agree. We need a stabilized middle east to keep oil prices down, to stop migration of millions of displaced people who will bankrupt 1st world countries. We need a stabilized middle east so European countries don't get economically affected which then affects our country. The goal of USA is not to make billions in weapons sale but for our economy to grow to collect taxes. Once our economy falters like it did during 07 crash you noticed local governments running out of money and people spending less. Keeping our economy going strong is more important than anything else on earth. A destabilized area is a threat to our economy. We have two large oceans that protect is from enemies who want to hurt us physically, but economic damage can happen by simply having radical Islam destabilize Europe which eventually will destabilize our economy. China and Russia have it much easier regarding protecting themselves against radical Islam, because they are not pc and will fight a dirty war.
China and Russia don't have it easier. Russia implemented Kadyrow in Chechenia who basically implemented Sharia and most high IS profiles are Chechenians. And Russia is afraid of a new metro or opera attack. Europe just needs to stop letting Saudi take control and sponsor western mosques. Most "Muslim" friends of mine never go to mosques anyway because they're second gen seculars, who don't really care for religion, they even drink beer. but those who do must not be brainwashed. Another factor is that most of young western people from Muslim communities aren't really actively religious but they are nationalist and the constant western interventions and news of bombed hospitals here and dead babies there feeds into their narrative of the west fighting and abusing the arabs. A lot of IS fighters didn't have a religious life before they got lured, they were small criminals who drank and took drugs. That narrative is bullshit of course but it's important to destroy it. That's why Iraq and US let Sunni soldiers free the Sunni Mosul which is sensible and smart. Call it PC but just running all guns blazing into Mossul would just be a free ad campaign for IS. edit: tl;dr: the few thousand IS people still alive aren't the problem and they'll be gone in a few months. The thousands who could become the next IS are the problem, and you can't fight them in a war.
is this a joke?
Why would this be a joke. Turn your TV on and look what is going on in the world. Islamic fighters have infiltrated Europe, Middle East and Africa. Because you don't see bombings in USA doesn't mean the world is safe. Islamic rebel revolutionaries have a lot of work to do in Africa, Europe and Middle East before they started working on our infrastructure. Once they start fighting us on our soil it's too late. Other factors such as the fragile economy and housing market will get affected. Isis will defeat the USA by simply turning our economy upside down. That's all they have to do. One simply 911 took a trillion dollars from our economy overnight and almost bankrupt us. Imagine having a 911 once a month. We have one chance right now before we lose complete control over isis and their Islamic partners. The chance is now. You might be cozy in your house right now and think radical Islam is a million miles away. We used to think like this about Hitler and Japan, till we got hurt. The only difference between pearl Harbor and now, back then we fought 3rd generation with 3rd generation warfare and now we fight 3rd against 4th. We will lose this battle like the way we lost Vietnam, the way we lost in Iraq, the way we are losing control right now over the world. One day our oil supply will get debilitated by radical Islam. That alone can set us back into the dark ages. Look around you, everything is run on oil and the economy. You damage one or the other and it will be catastrophic. We fight wars to stay alive. Our enemy fights wars to die. How are we supposed to defeat this enemy. I am more scared of today than I would have during WWII, at least while fighting Hitler and his army, they wore uniforms, now during 4th generation warfare, anybody can be the enemy at any time. That frightens me to the core.
could this be described as "islam baiting"?
I really hope so. "Fighting dirty" makes us no better than they are. It adds fuel to ISIL's fire, the "evil Americans" who don't care about humanity.
Has being nice worked so far? Dirty warfare would end up adding a small bit of gas to an oil-rig fire
The site wants me to turn off ad-blocker... No thanks...
Pull out and let Russia deal with it.
Please...Trump went to Military School. He knows more about the military, than they do.
You mean that he doesn't understand the basics of manipulating the elections of foreign countries!
You mean basic military operations like "You don't leave your men behind"?
Does Mr. Trump [know where Mosul is at least](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/10/21/is-the-media-giving-hillary-clinton-a-pass-for-her-own-aleppo-moment/)?
From your own source... >Whats really important here is to understand all the interplay, she added later. Mosul is a Sunni city. Mosul is on the border of Syria.  I think we can take back Mosul, and then we can move on into Syria and take back Raqqa. >Clinton was making a strategic point. Mosul is a key city near Syria that Iraqi forces must retake before pushing farther north, across the border. **It might have been a stretch for Clinton to say that Mosul is right on the border with Syria, but she clearly displayed a grasp of the regions dynamics**; Johnson, on the other hand, thought Aleppo was some sort of acronym.
Clinton left Americans in the field to die. What do the experts say about that?
Clinton was a military commander?
Troll harder.
probably: seven million taxpayer bucks later and nobody proved it.
It was proven that she asked, several times, for more funding for security forces to protect Americans in consulates overseas. Republicans voted it down every time. Also, I hope you are just as angry over the 13 similar consulate attacks that took place during the Bush administration that killed 13 Americans. There were no congressional committees for any of these.
If it was Republicans they think it doesn't matter.
> 13 similar consulate attacks that took place during the Bush administration that killed 13 Americans. There were no congressional committees for any of these. wow, that's an interesting point. ironic.

ever moronic trump is talking shit about military strategy and various other things, and showing his ignorance. it's his own fault for being called out by people with some level of understanding.
He's been running for president for 15 months. And it doesn't take a 4 star general to know that a sneak attack against a city of 2 million people is the dumbest fucking strategy possibly thought of
Glad there's both representations of aruements in this subreddit :))) /sarcasm
It's not like the other side has a point here. What can they say? "Trump has better knowledge than the generals"?
And Hillary seems to not understand how answering questions work? After saying no to the question of if she would put ground troops in Mosul. She then shortly answered 'We' in front of every military action she said. That sounds like the first question is yes. She also did not answer in the affirmative or the negative regarding if Russia violated that no fly zone she totes. That means no answer, which means she means yes.
That's some superb mental gymnastics
Which particular question? Mind linking, because she's been relatively consistent on this in the past. To NBC at the [commander in chief forum](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/08/us/politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-national-security.html?_r=0): >We are not putting ground troops into Iraq ever again and we are not putting ground troops into Syria Either way, Obama sort of took that decision out of these candidates hands, we announced sending in [600 troops](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/29/world/middleeast/obama-troops-iraq.html) last month; with Iraqi military in control of Qaraqosh, and with the Peshmerga driving hard on Bashiqa there may not be ISIL in Mosul by January.
do you happen to be a rapist, perchance?
No, I'm not (see that's how you answer a question see if you can teach Hillary how to do the same.) you'll have to get your rocks off from somebody else.
it was just this bit in your comment >That means no answer, which means she means yes.
Grasping at straws, I see. She didn't answer the question in any direct way whatsoever. What do you want a deleted email?
i was just making a rape joke i dont wanna talk about emails (which means you should respect my autonomy and find someone else who thinks she did nothing wrong)
this is why you have advisers that advise you on what to dom and why you have officauls running these sectors. you think Hillary knows about financials? the military? and a whole host of other stuff? do you think she will be making every decision on everything by herself? you lot are in cloud cuckoo land on this sub
do officials
Why don't we just elect them then?
Hilary never said she knows more then the generals. Hilary never said she knows everything about tax law. Donald trump said these things that's why there is an article about it. I'd be careful saying people are cuckoo when you aren't even grasping the point of the article.
Yeah, but no one else claims to have a super top secret plan to defeat ISIS. Trump does. Considering that he clearly knows jack all about military matters, that claim is laughably silly, as is everyone who believes him.
yes, that is true, he does have a secret plan, as it should be, unlike Hillary's plan which was to announce on TV that they were going to launch a surprise attack on an isis stronghold. you couldn't make this shit up.
Real warfare is not like a video game. A "surprise attack" on an entire city is impossible. First, we are talking about bringing tanks and troops into a flat desert. Easy to see from long distances. The outlying areas have to be captured before the city, and the millions of citizens in those outlying areas would notify Mosul. We're also talking about tens of thousands of troops needing to be coordinated between multiple different groups; exact communication is more important than any imaginary "element of surprise". Not to mention, announcing the attack publicly is a planned move, it gets innocent civilians out of the city, and it means quite a few ISIL dropouts will be fleeing the stronghold - which makes them easier to pick off, and makes the stronghold less defended.
Trump has time and again imperiled his campaign by refusing to listen to his advisors and fighting with anyone who disagreed with him (e.g. everyone wanted him to do debate prep, he refused, Clinton won every debate). Finally, he surrounded himself with yes-men who know better than to ever tell him he's wrong. He has no history of listening to good advice, and has been openly critical of the current military leadership, saying he would replace them with people who simply agreed with him. He's not going to all of a sudden turn into a wise, thoughtful decision-maker with the ability to take in a bunch of complex information and make a reasoned judgment call. He's going to go with whatever his gut tells him, as he has said he would do, and ignore, marginalize, or get rid of anyone who says "No, that's not a good idea."
> this is why you have advisers that advise you on what to dom and why you have officauls running these sectors. You mean, like the generals that Trump has openly declared have been "reduced to rubble" and that he "knows more" about ISIS than?
Or the intelligence briefings he flat out refuses to believe...
He can tell the good guys from the bad guys. That's a huge improvement over anything we have seen from Obama and Hillary.
"The families, wives and children, you gotta take em out." Yeah he knows the distinction of good guys from bad all right.
You gotta take out their families.
This is so tired...who was in the room when Bin Laden was taken out? Hint: it wasn't republicans.
Did he give out our nuclear response time on national television like Hillary Clinton did? Thats what I thought.
Ah fuck you're right, he's a tactical genius.
It's been public knowledge since the 50's
Yawn.
oh yeah cause thats not important at all
lol that information was readily available prior to her "disclosing" it during the debate dude.
They were rumors before some shitty former Secretary of State told the world dude.
Just like clockwork.
Of course he didn't. Trump would never state an easily verifiable and well known fact on live television.
It was knowledge that you could have Googled anyway. Try again.
Fyi, it doesn't matter if it had been stated a thousand times. If you are someone privy to that info, you still are not allowed to say it.
Are you telling me that the United States Air Force is doing some illegal things by telling visitors how quickly we can launch a nuke at a replica nuclear silo at the National Museum of the United States Air Force?
"They appear not to understand why we like Trump" - Trump supporters express shock that Hillary fans still can't see it. They will. They will.
You're right, I don't understand why anyone likes Trump, and I never will...You however will be very upset when we elect Hillary...
Well on the news Hillary Satan admitted that they funded and trained the Islamic extremist to fight Russia in the 80s. They then became the Talib an, then alqueda then isis. So.. better someone new but trying than someone attacking their own country.
>Well on the news Hillary Satan admitted that they funded and trained the Islamic extremist to fight Russia in the 80s. "They" being the US government, not Clinton. It was Reagan that signed off on that and armed the Mujahedeen .
And she's completely clean of all further involvement lol. ok
"He appears not to understand basic military activities" yeah.... and the generals that are constantly arming our enemies sure know the basic military activities. For anyone wondering, you are not suppose to arm your enemies in war, you are suppose to disarm them (shocking I know)
I imagine something similar was said by the British about us in 1700's
yea, that's totally comparable.
Has he dodged sniper fire lately?
Trump has generals and advisers and a team around him to help make his decisions as president, just like any president before him. Hillary on the other hand will have no advisers as they are all jumping ship. But at least she will have 200 years in prison to think about what went wrong.
Who's jumping ship?
Corey Lewandows- oh wait Paul Manaf- no wrong again Well it's not like members of his party retracted their endo- ah shit nevermind
He doesn't listen to advice now, he wouldn't as president.
I just love the stories Trump supporters make up, Y'all should write a novel!
mountains out of mole hills,. why does anyone even lsiten to what he has to say? we all know he is inexperienced in just about everything. of course he doesnt understand military activities. id bet Hillary doesnt understand it either.
Trump claims he knows more than the generals. He's painfully ignorant.
well... he needs to quit pretending because we all know he doesnt. like i said why does anyone take anything he says like that seriously.
Because he does still stand a snow balls chance in hell of becoming President.
Lol, a forum full of paid shills and tweens arguing about shit they have zero clue about. It's cute ;)
I completely agree
What is the plan here? Just like say it enough and then people will agree?
Pretty funny considering this is a thread about Trump *proving* he has zero clue
I've actually fought in Mosul, and agree with Trump that our current administration can't fight.
> agree with Trump why
Informing your enemy that you're about to attack them is not good.
i suppose that's a generic truism. but it's very simplistic thinking and it seems like there are a number of factors at play. http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/21/us/politics/donald-trump-mosul-iraq.html it's fascinating... the clueless hubris of using pithy one-liners to trash the active duty military leadership. to trash retired military generals and claim he could teach them things. guess it's in line with trashing people like mccain and the khans.
I spent a decade in the army as a combat medic, believe me, everyone trashes the generals ;)
Do they trash POWs too, like Trump?
Ya mean like Bowe Bergdal? Fuck that guy!
I mean like John McCain. Is it common in the military to trash anyone whose plane gets shot down?
You sound like a genuinely unpleasant person.
Can I rub your head in a patronizing fashion or is that rape now?
Yes it is. We're not supposed to be in the habit of murdering civilians.
So you've never actually deployed overseas I take it.
You don't take issue with the fact that he insults the military pretty frequently?
Well congrats, but there's a reason you fought in Mosul and not a general overseeing the operations in Mosul.
Lol, this guy. Two thumbs up and a winky face ;)
Nice jab at the military vet. You must have felt like a Reddit hero after posting that.
Get that political correctness bullshit out of here. I didn't insult anyone, just pointed out a fact.
And redditors appear not to understand basic executive protocol. The commander in chief is the ideas guy, and he hires people who know the specifics to implement the ideas. That's the way it's always been. All this "DAE think Trump near the big red nuclear button is scarEY??/ xDDD" shit just makes the left look like they have no idea how government works.
Being stupid is a choice, champ. A choice you are clearly making.
And who would he bring on, Omarosa and Bill Ransic?
Dude, shut the fuck up. Donald clearly doesn't listen to any of his advisors as is, and has openly said he knows more about war and ISIS than our generals. He's also openly mocked them by saying they've been "reduced to rubble." Just because Drumpf has advisors doesn't mean shit.
What about his super secret plan the defeat ISIS
>The commander in chief is the ideas guy, and he hires people who know the specifics to implement the ideas. Yes. But I think the concern is that Trump seems like a genuinely stupid man who will hire fucking idiots.
And Hillary does such a good job. Obsiously from the way she handled Benghazi right?
You mean the thing that Republicans have been trying (unsuccessfully) to pin on her? The thing that had more hearings and commissions than Pearl Harbor and still didn't find any wrongdoing?
[deleted]
Why what was reopened? The Benghazi investigation was nothing but a partisan witch hunt, one which only succeeded to exonerating Clinton.
handled it well enough that 9 investigations and 7 million in taxpayer dollars were wasted on bullshit.
Endorsed by decorated generals, "doesn't understand military activities". Top kek.
"Top Kek"
It's all $hillary's fault for broadcasting our top secret plans to attack Mosul on live television, right brother?
Yes, he was endorsed by 88 generals . . . . out of the 500 that had endorsed Romney, the last GOP candidate. Meanwhile 95 of them endorsed his opposition, and the rest appear to have decided not to endorse anyone.
