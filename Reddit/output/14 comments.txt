The big takeaway trends: * Latino vote is up * Female vote is up * Rural vote is down * Democrat vote is up * African American vote is down * Trump is doing worse in Florida than Romney at this point It doesn't seem like those trends are too solid at this point but they are really not looking good for Trump. On another note I'm surprised the NYT gave as much credence to the latest email hoopla as they did in this article. Basically nothing critical of it other than people are burnt out.
Maybe there is a God afterall.
I like how depending on which sub you visit you hear Hillary doing well so far or Trump doing well so far.
As a non-American is does make it look a bit silly.
Don't look at individual news stories. The "horse race" narrative is a thing for a reason. Check poll aggregators like 538, Princeton, or RCP to track the race. Early voting is a garbage predictor anyhow.
Early voting is by no means a useless statistic though. I mean yeah, the population that votes early is substantially different from the general electorate, but you can still see trends by comparing to previous years early voting turnout.
Yeah, it can be useful when used in that way. The numbers tend to be small enough that they're difficult to untangle from other factors though, particularly since we only have party affiliation numbers. Many/most articles seem to be reporting just the raw numbers anyhow, which isn't super helpful.
I think that is changing as early voting becomes more common. Large Dem area in Florida, and this is the first time people have had to wait in line for early voting. It makes me hopeful.
It's definitely becoming more common. Obama actually lost one state (Ohio I think?) in terms of votes cast on election day, but still won the state due to an early voting advantage.
The article was downright negative towards Clinton, especially the end quotes.
I hope the Black vote starts to catch up to 2012 levels soon.
So do pollsters because d+6 and greater depends on that.
Without a Black candidate I don't think there is the enthusiasm. The low rate of African American voting is frustrating, voter suppression works :( Hopefully the anti-Trump sentiment will get them close to 2012 levels.
If Hillary 40 years younger and single i am sure it will reach it!
It's just in NC, though. But your points still stand.
Closing early voting locations in black counties also contributes a lot to that. I would wait to see the numbers on election day before jumping to conclusions.
It's in NC, where the government slashed early voting locations in black counties down to nearly nothing. Hopefully they'll have more on election day and Clinton's ground team can turn them out.
I voted yesterday in NC, went to an early voting location in a majority black area. How the hell can someone justify a 2 hour line for early voting on a Sunday?
> It's in NC, where the government slashed early voting locations in black counties down to nearly nothing. Speaking of rigging.
The US, where everyone is free, provided the person is a middle-aged, male, anglo-saxon, white protestant.
The black vote is down specifically in NC. Not nationally.
Is it possible for HRC to lose NC?
Well sure, it's possible.
I mean, how likely is it?
Probably 60-40
Wait, so you're telling me building out a massive infrastructure to assist with getting people to vote actually works? No way
Arizona will be a fun one to watch. Hillary, 32 field offices and ground game Trump, 0
But he has so many hats!
And yard signs, FB likes, and bumper stickers.
The beauty is, they aren't even allowed to go to a polling station wearing them lol 10 bucks says we get massive cries of "voter suppression" by his supporters who try to do that on election day
Why isn't that allowed?
It varies from state to state.
You are not allowed to wear or hand out messages relating to politics with 50 -100 feet of a polling location.
It could be seen as a form of campaigning.
No campaigning at polling stations
Trump voters are holding out because they really want to make a statement by showing up en masse on election day, November 28th!

Very nice thank you. And it has a github page. Maybe I can do this myself.
If you hit the stop loading "x" in the corner at the right time you can bypass the paywall
please get out there and vote! democrats have got to win this election.
If winning were so important, they should have nominated someone other than Crooked Hillary
Didn't your fifth grade teacher ever tell you that name-calling isn't very nice?
Awww, did that hurt your Clintonista feelz?
Horribly. I'm almost considering jumping off of a bridge now with how mean it was.
You certainly sounded that upset! Let me know how the jump goes
Someone crawled out of their basket...
He's a Stein supporter that's using insults from Dorito Mussolini. Not even going to bother.
Oh, but you did bother! You acted like a fussy Clintonista because poor Crooked Hillary was insulted.
This may come as a shock, but calling people petty insults generally doesn't come off to well in the real world. People will act like you're being a childish prick, mainly because calling people petty nicknames is the act of a child. I'm half expecting you to call her a "doo-doo head" next.
Basket dwelling is not restricted to supporters of only one candidate.
> You certainly sounded that upset! He/She didn't *'sound'* anything, any sound you *'heard'* was due to your mind overlaying the text with a conceptualized idea of *his/her* voice. Although, as a Trump supporter, I'm sure it is not very common for you to separate your imagination from reality.
Where did I say I was a Trump supporter? You are the one clearly hearing things here. Are you upset too?
Good! Vote, donate, and volunteer. Let's make this a blow out!
And for those of you just joining the program, early turnout votes almost _always_ trend republican (old people, mail-in voters etc.), while the day-of turnout usually trends democratic (walk-ins, urban voters, etc.)
i remember clinton thoroughly destroying bernie during the primary with mail-in voting. they did it then and are doing it now too. they seem to increasingly be getting better at it.
They recruited a lot of Obama's field generals to run these operations.
I had heard the opposite - the Democrats tend to have considerable leads in early voting. Maybe that's just for North Carolina.
Well, there's a difference between early in-person voting, which Ds dominate, and absentee/mail-in, which is generally the province of Rs. But adding those 2 numbers together, Rs generally win... not this year, though.
historically the GOP enjoyed an absentee/early vote advantage, to erase that is a watershed for the Democrats.
This the Democratic version of Republicans saying they're gonna push for Pennsylvania and Michigan in the last week, a thing they say to build up confidence towards the end of the election. Same shit they said in 08 and 12. Except that Republicans never actually win PA and MI, and Obama really did win all the swing states.
Why is it legal to already give out this kind of information while so many still have to vote? Shouldn't information about early voting be strictly prohibited to share with the public until the last person has voted?
It shouldn't be legal lol. Like Nevada is a state I'm following and if Clinton gets a nominal lead in Clark county of 60k it's more or less over without a lot of people voting against party affiliation. It's nonsense that we can follow this.
They aren't giving out information about who's voting for who specifically. It's just based on party affiliation. Keep in mind some Rs may vote Clinton but down ticket R and some Independents may split tickets too.
But if it would be devoid of voting information, this information wouldn't be relevant at all. It's pretty clear that more registered democrats voting has a positive correlation with more democratic votes registered.
> Keep in mind some Rs may vote Clinton ... and some democrats may vote Tru... aww, who am I kidding, lol.
Except Florida, I believe.
The article says that Trump is doing worse than Romney in Florida at his point compared to 2012.
LOL, NYT in last ditch desperate attempt to lie to voters and pretend Hillary is winning. Early voting in Florida is very much in Trump's favor. The Democrat advantage in in-person early voting is 2.6% down from 9.2% in 2012. Turnout from heavily Republican counties is way up and turnout from heavily Democrat counties is slightly down. In short, Trump is crushing it in Florida. They are also totally off base on NC. The Democrat advantage in early voting in NC is a few points below 2012 levels, and the African American turnout was way below 2012 levels even before the FBI announcement on Friday. Of course the lying NYT tries to claim this drop in AA turnout happened over the weekend so they could blame it on the FBI news, but that's not the case. There is also some evidence that the turnout in heavily Republican counties in both Colorado and Wisconsin is significantly higher than 2012 and beating the turnout from heavily Democrat counties. - Almost all of the early voting news is positive for Trump and this all manifested itself before the FBI bombshell. In other words, Hillary was going to lose anyway.
You sound like Trump. As in blatantly making up facts and numbers without any connection to reality
LOL, you just proved you don't really care about the actual numbers. If you did you would have asked me to link to sources. Instead you just criticize what I wrote because you don't like the results. I'm sure it must be starting to sink into the back of your mind that Hillary is going to lose. Somewhere deep down you're beginning to realize the big media lie is about to come crashing down as it collides with reality. Do yourself a favor. Don't hold on to it until election night. The shock will be too great. Start the process of acceptance now and ease into it.
I adked for sources on another comment. You failed to provide any. I presume it's because you don't have any legitimate sources outside of Breitbart, drudge report or infowars LOL.
You reply to this comment, but you ignore the comment above that already asked for sources. This is telling. You guys just can't help but make shit up
I put the sources in another reply to this thread. Don't cry too hard when you read them.
There are no links of any type in this subthread. If you really want to convince anyone, help us out a little.
[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5a90bx/early_turnout_tilts_toward_democrats_in_swing/d9evv9c/)
There is no source. You know you have no sources, we know it, everyone knows it. I used sentence structure that resembles how your moronic choice for President speaks, so I know you understand.
You really shouldn't continue on in denial. It isn't healthy.
"no data". I guess I'm convinced you're just a troll.
You've been asked to link the sources multiple times and failed to do so. Not much to make of that other than that you are lying.
And somehow you are privy to all the secrets of the world right? trump doesn't stand a chance.
Link the sources then and prove how smart you are. That don't come from Breitbart, Fox News, r/the_donald comments, stormfront comments, Rasmussen or any other alt-right site.
I am curious. What are your sources?
Surely OP will deliver after he was asked 3 hours ago, 1 hour ago, 45 minutes ago, and again 20 minutes ago.
Source for all of this?
He's a Trumpster. They don't do sources. (or evidence of any kind.)
I doubt you want to see his 400 pound ass he pulled it from.
Still better than 2:1 odds for Clinton on predictit, if you truly believe that Trump is going to win it would be stupid not to take those odds.
What are the source for those numbers you are saying?
Honestly, what would the NY Times gain by lying?
Good question. The entire MSM has been lying about Trump since August. They obviously don't want him elected. They've been so biased it's obvious to almost everyone and I actually know people who hate Trump but they're voting for him out of spite because of how ridiculous and one sided the media has been. They've been in this desperate attempt to convince people that Hillary is winning and it's a done deal, presumably to convince Trump voters not to bother because it's already over. There's some of this every election cycle but this time it's reached new highs. We are staring at a very dangerous situation. The Podesta emails have shown many cases of the media colluding with the Democrats. So instead of doing their job as watchdog of the government, the media is now in bed with them. This is exactly why Trump will be elected. People are tired of it.
Oh yes, the unified, all powerful THEY!!! Dun dun dun. All media is colluding here. If the Wall Street Journal would just write about all the colluding they'd make a killing! How deep does this go?!?!?!
Once again, could you give me any source of Podesta emails colluding with the media outside of Breitbart, Drudge Report, Info Wars or Sean Hannity?
You know that "lowest common denominator" everyone says Trump is pandering toward? That's you. The idiots who will believe anything, no matter how ridiculous, that fits their carefully manicured narrative.
I feel bad for people like you. It seems you can't accept the fact that there are a lot of Americans who see things differently than you. No, they are not all 'idiots'. No, they are not all racist. No, they are not all sexist. They just have a different point of view. The 'tolerant' left never dissapoints.
I never claimed to be tolerant. Anyone who listens to Donald Trump and nods their head and says "Yep, this guy needs to be president," I am happy to generalize about. They are all idiots, every single one of them. Not a single intelligent sentence has come out of the guy's mouth the entire election. Besides which, there's no room for tolerance when it comes to dangerous, poorly conceived ideas that threaten the prosperity and well-being of our country or our people. Everything about Trump and the hatred-and-ego-fueled vitriol he spews is dangerous. I have no tolerance for him, or anyone who supports him. No person of good conscience should.
You have such a closed mind you can't even entertain the possibility that people are supporting Trump because of his policies. There are some serious problems in this country and Trump is willing to talk about them in a straightforward way and offer common sense solutions. Voters respond to that. You may agree or disagree with Trump's policies, but to write off his supporters as idiots just shows you to be a closed minded fool.
Let him say one of his policies from beginning to end in a complete, non-run on sentence without tangents, and we can consider that a start.
Sure we can- we just think his policies suck and will actually create actual serious problems, not made up right wing problems. Most of us are doing just fine. We realize that illegal immigration is actually down- and that comes from actually enforcing labor laws, not trying to keep us all trapped behind a wall. Unemployment is down, unless you want to look at made up numbers that were never used to Gaige unemployment before- and count all the old people that are still alive despite the made up 'death panels'. ISIS is being eliminated. Terrorism has always existed and will always exist. Only the groups change. Incomes are rising again. Small business owners can actually buy health insurance- even if they had preexisting conditions. So what's the big crisis that is worth putting a demagogue in office? Why would I, as a woman in a small business, want to have Trump in office? You can say what you want about Florida, but it requires ignoring the most populated counties- where Trump has personally screwed over our small businesses, and ripped people off with his 'developments' (look at his Hollywood condo lawsuits and the painter in Miami). He's just a greedy fraud who has conned people year after year. He's always been that way. He ripped off his stockholders in New Jersey. He was born rich and thinks he deserves credit for being born. As a woman, he thinks I shouldn't have control over my own body- from forcing me to give birth to grabbing me by the pussy. He's rude and sets a horrible example for the children of this country. To top it off, he picked a religious extremist as his VP- so after he screws everything up and they impeach him, we will have a President Pence who thinks we shouldn't have HIV treatments and that my brother should go to conversion therapy. There's nothing he offers that I want. The right has been trying for thirty years to pin something, anything, on Hillary. She's either a total criminal genius or there just isn't anything to find. They recovered over 17k of her deleted emails- still no smoking gun- because there is nothing there. Meanwhile, its ignored that your candidate is going to court for ripping off our fellow citizens with his fake university scam.
> Everything about Trump and the hatred-and-ego-fueled vitriol he spews is dangerous. I have no tolerance for him, or anyone who supports him. No person of good conscience should. Hear hear.
Did you know that Trump isn't like me and you? He pays 0% in federal income tax while I'll assume you pay about 25%. He's in this for himself. He's promoting his brand and his name. At the end of the day, I'm sure he doesn't care if he loses (although it will be hilarious when he does, I expect the most epic meltdown in history).
> He's in this for himself. He's promoting his brand and his name. Of all the arguments against Trump I do believe this is the silliest. The man walked away from a comfortable successful life where he could have spent his golden years enjoying his success and his family. Instead, he chose to put himself and his family through the most brutal media attacks imaginable, to have his life and his reputation trashed and to put himself at great personal physical risk. The notion that he's doing this for himself is just absurd.
Of course it's for himself - it's for his ego.
What attacks? Most of the shit is just clips of shit he's said. Lmao attacks. Jesus fuck, guy. Trump brings the attacks on by being a complete fucking idiot and promoter of sexual assault and racism.
It is a get rich quick scheme. He would use his own company to build the wall and pocket the profit n in the same way that he is billing his campaign donors for all the maga hats and stays at his hotels
That Trump was a narcissist willing to make a fool out of himself over his ego was old news long before he decided to run for office. But even if I thought Trump had good intentions (ha!), I'd still never vote for him. He's an anti-intellectual who actively disdains facts and refuses to listen to experts who know more than he does. He's the exact kind of "feels over reals" nut that Reddit normally loves to hate. Someone like that is extraordinarily dangerous given power, even with good intentions. If you won't let yourself be guided by facts and openly defy reality, then your intentions don't matter, you're going to fuck up. Clinton, for all her problems, is a skilled politician who is unlikely to fuck up by accident. And her interest lies in maintaining the status quo - she's unlikely to wreck the economy simply because she's too stupid not to, whereas I absolutely see Trump doing that (for fuck's sake, the few bits of his economic "policy" that aren't just hot air are a complete joke to anyone who has the first clue how national economies work). And of course, since Trump doesn't listen to facts on *any* topic, he can wreck a lot more than just the economy.
> He's an anti-intellectual who actively disdains facts and refuses to listen to experts who know more than he does. Would these be the 'experts' who have fucked up our country beyond recognition over the past 30 years? The problem with 'intellectuals' is that too many of them don't understand how to operate in the real world. This is where a man like Trump excels because he's done it and he knows how the real world works. The notion that Trump won't take advice from anyone is silly. He's run a successful global business for a long time and you don't do that all by yourself. The establishment doesn't like him because he refuses to play their game, so they paint him as an 'anti-intellectual', which really means anti-establishment, and that's exactly why people support him. >Clinton, for all her problems, is a skilled politician That's her biggest problem. 'Skilled politicians' are destroying our country. We don't need another skilled politician. We need someone who will shake up Washington. >And her interest lies in maintaining the status quo Again, this is a total disaster. 70% of the American public thinks the country is on the wrong track. Clinton represents that wrong track, which is why she will not be elected. >And of course, since Trump doesn't listen to facts You mistake Trump's rhetoric on the campaign trail for how he will actually govern. I agree, he plays fast and loose with facts on the campaign trail. He does this because he is very adept at communicating with people and he realizes that most voters are not interested in too much detail and are not really concerned whether everything he says is factually accurate. Voters are interested in ideas, directions and the 'feel' of a candidate. Trump knows how to effectively communicate with the voters, which is why he will win. The political class doesn't like this because he's 'breaking the rules' so they mock him for it. Of course he'll be the one laughing on election day.
yeehaw america is at the lowest employement in 60 yeRs. i hears trump talking about how those in "the know" actually knpw that its closer to 50% instead of the SO CALLED 5%. when we elect president trump intp office he will make sure all améicans are employed and will be hard on isis and BUILD THE WALL!!!
I can't tell whether this is satire or not but it perfectly defines the lack of coherence that is the Trump campaign and his supporters. >Would these be the 'experts' who have fucked up our country beyond recognition over the past 30 years? The problem with 'intellectuals' is that too many of them don't understand how to operate in the real world. This is where a man like Trump excels because he's done it and he knows how the real world works. Experts are engineers who took us to the moon, heart surgeons who gave my dad's heart a second chance, and, yes, statesmen who have helped make this country the incredible place it is. Thirty years ago we lived under a daily threat of nuclear annihilation. And thanks to the geopolitical experts you blithely deride, the United States - the planet as a whole - is much safer and better than it's ever been. Dismissing knowledgeable people *because* they are knowledgeable isn't something to be proud of. >The notion that Trump won't take advice from anyone is silly. He's run a successful global business for a long time and you don't do that all by yourself. The establishment doesn't like him because he refuses to play their game, so they paint him as an 'anti-intellectual', which really means anti-establishment, and that's exactly why people support him. The notion that being a successful real estate developer makes you qualified to do anything other than develop real estate is silly. I'd no more ask Donald Trump to perform open heart surgery on a relative than I would vote for him to be our President. Being the best gardener doesn't make you the best soldier. As for his business acumen, he doesn't seem to have above-average abilities. Given his starting position, his success probably isn't that exceptional. >That's her biggest problem. 'Skilled politicians' are destroying our country. We don't need another skilled politician. We need someone who will shake up Washington. No. Politics is not Risk. It's a skill - just as any other - that requires a certain level of experience to do well. To use the same analogy as before, placing an extremely skilled lawyer in charge of a surgical team will not make the surgical team any better. >Again, this is a total disaster. 70% of the American public thinks the country is on the wrong track. Clinton represents that wrong track, which is why she will not be elected. I can - and will - just as easily say that the reason for this is the Republican Congress, which has done nothing but obstruct the normal and necessary functioning of the federal government. Breaking something and then blaming it for not working isn't sound policy. Come on... we ain't that stupid. >You mistake Trump's rhetoric on the campaign trail for how he will actually govern. I agree, he plays fast and loose with facts on the campaign trail.

The political class doesn't like this because he's 'breaking the rules' so they mock him for it. Of course he'll be the one laughing on election day. Yet Clinton is assailed for not telling the truth. This paragraph is abso-fuckin-lutely Orwellian and the reason why I began to think your whole post is sarcasm. He has no understanding of **facts** and doesn't seem to even care. And you laud that as a reason to support him. And we shouldn't vote for someone who *feels* like the right candidate. That's 100% bullshit. I don't give a shit if my mechanic is an asshole and I think so, if he's the best mechanic, he's the best mechanic. My *feelings* have no bearing on the reality of that fact. And Trump voters *feeling* that he is qualified doesn't make him so. Donald Trump has proven that he has no respect for our military, has no knowledge of foreign policy, doesn't understand **or** respect our constitutional republic and is an overall moral degenerate. This isn't a game.
> I can't tell whether this is satire or not but it perfectly defines the lack of coherence that is the Trump campaign and his supporters. Well, considering he's about to win the Presidency, against all odds, I'd say you might want to reevaluate your analysis methods. In 9 more days we'll see that he is indeed smarter than the political chattering class and he has in fact run circles around all of the 'experts'. You can call him any names you want and you can disparage his supporters however you like, but he's going to win.
He's not going to win.
> Well, considering he's about to win the Presidency, against all odds, I'd say you might want to reevaluate your analysis methods. It's not my analysis. It's the analysis of ... *experts* who analyze polling data. But I guess they are as useless as NASA engineers are. And do you care to respond to anything else I posted?
The country is fucked up? News to me. Unemployment and the uninsured rates are at the lowest in a long time. The median income is up. The deficit has been cut by more than half. We are living in the safest time to be a minority. ISIS will be pushed out of Iraq by Inauguration Day. Are there problems? Sure, id like a public option to promote competition in healthcare. I'd like to be able to negotiate drug prices. I think we need to reign in college tuition and allow anyone who wants to go to college do it. What's wrong with a more educated society? Most of all, we have taken steps to fight Climate Change as a planet. Stop with the dystopian view of America because it's bullshit. Also, save your "LABOR FORCE PARTICIPATION RATE and CC is a hoax for another thread
>The country is fucked up? News to me. You and I can disagree, but 70% of the voters think the country is on the wrong track.
I doubt even half of that 70% can even agree on what the right track is. How many of them want a single payer system and how many cry socialism whenever that comes up? How many want legal marijuana and criminal justice reform? That statistic means almost nothing.
>Would these be the 'experts' who have fucked up our country beyond recognition over the past 30 years? No, it means exactly what I said: people who know more than he does on a given subject. He regularly repeats things we know to be false (e.g. "vaccines cause autism", claiming that crime is at "record levels", etc), and never backs down when called out on it - it's clear he doesn't care if what he says is wrong or a lie, as long as it either makes him look good or he thinks it will get him attention/votes. There's a reason economists on all sides of the political spectrum have pointed out his economic "plan" would almost certainly cause a recession, and military leaders have panned his attitude towards foreign conflict. And as someone in the tech field, his comments on "hacking" sound like something a severely out of touch politician would've said in the 90s, and make it painfully clear he hasn't the faintest idea about the tech sector. There is a good reason his support drops significantly with more educated voters on both the left and the right. And the country is hardly "fucked up beyond recognition". Our economy is doing great, the problem is how the wealth is distributed. Crime is still decreasing across the board. We're finally seeing marijuana get legalized in more and more states. Our technology and service sectors are thriving. The fact that Sanders even got as far as he did means there's real momentum for reform as long as we pick someone competent. And even without reform, we're still very much a first world country. >The problem with 'intellectuals' is that too many of them don't understand how to operate in the real world. This is where a man like Trump excels because he's done it and he knows how the real world works. That's not very convincing given how many of his businesses have failed due to poor management, and it's especially not convincing when he refuses to release his tax returns to backup his claims of success. For fuck's sake, we're talking about a man who has seriously suggesting defaulting on the national debt without a hint of understanding that "defaulting" on national debt is nothing like declaring personal bankruptcy. It's even less convincing considering his opponent has *decades* of experience in politics. She's not some ivory tower academic. >That's her biggest problem. 'Skilled politicians' are destroying our country. We don't need another skilled politician. We need someone who will shake up Washington. Again, this is a total disaster. 70% of the American public thinks the country is on the wrong track. Clinton represents that wrong track, which is why she will not be elected. Bernie was the reform candidate - and he's still pushing for reform down-ballot with decent success. Trump is setting the house on fire out of spite. The US will easily survive another four years of status quo - it's not like the momentum for reform is going anywhere if the economic gap continues to grow. But sure, vote for the candidate who promises to cut taxes even more for wealthy people like himself just because he's convinced you he's "anti-establishment". >You mistake Trump's rhetoric on the campaign trail for how he will actually govern. I agree, he plays fast and loose with facts on the campaign trail Are you seriously suggesting that even though you *know* Trump is like this, and even though he's never shown any other behavior in the past, that somehow he'll magically do a 180 flip once actually elected? Trump acts like this even when it hurts him, and it matches up with how he's behaved in the past long before he ran for office. It's not an act, this is who he really is.
He's doing it to fuel his ego. If he's the POTUS, his already swollen ego will go through the roof.
What has the media lied about Trump?
One megathread later and we're back to propaganda I see
TIL Facts = propaganda.
Feels > Reals !
The republican rallying cry this election?
Er...how is this propaganda? Are you mad there are threads not about emails?
Early turnout always does, would be too conspicuous if all the illegals were bussed to the stations on election day...
