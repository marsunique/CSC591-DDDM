I found this to be the most shocking part of the article: >Reports also suggest the organisation's smallest ever gift was a $7 donation paid to the Boy Scouts in 1989 – the same amount it cost at the time to register a new Scout. Mr Trump’s eldest son, Donald Junior, was 11 at the time. It is unknown whether the ‘donation’ was paid to register his child.
That's just so petty.
It's mean. Trolling poor kids is the shittiest.
Shocking? No, Trump starting his campaign by saying Mexico is sending murderers and rapists across the border was shocking. This is just funny. "Here you go Donny boy, give this $7 check from my foundation to your scout leader and you're all set!"
I you think all of Mexico is illegal is immigrants. That's pretty racist dude.
People seem to forget that he's been spouting incredibly dangerous ethno-fascist language for months now.
For better part of a year, and if you count his birthering and history of racism, then decades
I liked the story about him going to an inner city school He talked to kids who needed 5k to go to a chess tournament, showed them a fake million dollar bill, gave them two hundred bucks and then driving off. It was almost as good as him crashing a charity event at a school for kids with HIV without actually donating anything. He's a straight up cartoon villain.
What a giver. He does the best charity. Yuge.
Hillary is going to jail!!! I love this. Don't bother responding I'm not reading. Your downvote is enough! Hahahahaha Edit: you read it, didn't respond, and downvoted like I told you. Good boy lolollolol
Bigly donations. All the time.

It's actually even less than that. The foundation was started in 1987 but he didn't start contributing until 1990. So that's 26 years. Over the 26 years, he's given a total of 3.7 million. 3,700,000/26 = ~$142,000/yr
Charity starts at home. Or, you know, right out in front of it.
Him, his campaign and his charities are held to such low standards that he could have easily stepped over the hurdle. Instead he kicked it over and still managed to trip and fall on his face. Meanwhile Clinton has to set a new poll vaulting record in A+ rated charitable work to barely be considered on par.
And yet, her charity is the one he complains is corrupt and a front for criminal activity
Even if her charity is what he claims, they'd still be doing more good on the side than his does as the main focus.
In 1996, he showed up to a charity event (opening ceremony of a special school for children with AIDS) uninvited, taking the seat of an actual donor so he'd look charitable on TV. Seriously. [He actually did this.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-boasts-of-his-philanthropy-but-his-giving-falls-short-of-his-words/2016/10/29/b3c03106-9ac7-11e6-a0ed-ab0774c1eaa5_story.html#comments) >In the fall of 1996, a charity called the Association to Benefit Children held a ribbon-cutting in Manhattan for a new nursery school serving children with AIDS. The bold-faced names took seats up front. >There was then-Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani (R) and former mayor David Dinkins (D). TV stars Frank and Kathie Lee Gifford, who were major donors. And there was a seat saved for Steven Fisher, a developer who had given generously to build the nursery. >Then, all of a sudden, there was Donald Trump. >“Nobody knew he was coming,” said Abigail Disney, another donor sitting on the dais. “There’s this kind of ruckus at the door, and I don’t know what was going on, and in comes Donald Trump. [He] just gets up on the podium and sits down.” >Trump was not a major donor. He was not a donor, period. He’d never given a dollar to the nursery or the Association to Benefit Children, according to Gretchen Buchenholz, the charity’s executive director then and now. >But now he was sitting in Fisher’s seat, next to Giuliani. >“Frank Gifford turned to me and said, ‘Why is he here?’ ” Buchenholz recalled recently. By then, the ceremony had begun. There was nothing to do. >“Just sing past it,” she recalled Gifford telling her. >So they warbled into the first song on the program, “This Little Light of Mine,” alongside Trump and a chorus of children — with a photographer snapping photos, and Trump looking for all the world like an honored donor to the cause. >Afterward, Disney and Buchenholz recalled, Trump left without offering an explanation. Or a donation. Fisher was stuck in the audience. The charity spent months trying to repair its relationship with him.
So in other words. He is a literal narcissist
When Donald's parent were like, We need to talk about Kevin...about Donald...they just didn't.
Little things like this - the charity not standing up to him - are what tells him he is doing thigns right. "Just grab a chair on the stage. When you're famous you can do that! They don't care!"
Taking into account the assertion that everything Trump does is motivated by revenge I'm going to guess that Fischer being a developer is highly relevent. They were probably in a pissing contest over some real estate deal.
This makes the most sense actually. Trump doesn't give two shits about some charity. "Seat reserved for [new York developer]". Well there it is.
He doesn't give any shits about charity, but he likes looking good, especially if it doesn't cost him anything. Revenge may play a part, but he likes to pretend he's generous too.
So, he got his foundation to buy his son's Scout membership so that he could claim it as a deduction?
That's like...I want to say it's petty but it's beyond petty. It's just...I don't have a word for this. I don't even know what to say about a supposed really rich guy using his private foundation to pay a **$7** membership. I mean fuck. That's the cost of two overpriced yuppie coffees.
Reminds me of that pic that shows Eric Trump drinking lemonade out of a water only cup at some fast food place.

Uh, if his Foundation paid for that check, and that check CLEARLY is a piece of propaganda for a political campaign (it has MAGA on the bottom and a trumpforvets.com on the corner), isn't that an illegal use of Foundation money?
Absolutely. > Under the Internal Revenue Code, all section 501(c)(3) organizations are absolutely prohibited from directly or indirectly participating in, or intervening in, any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for elective public office. Contributions to political campaign funds or public statements of position (verbal or written) made on behalf of the organization in favor of or in opposition to any candidate for public office clearly violate the prohibition against political campaign activity. Violating this prohibition may result in denial or revocation of tax-exempt status and the imposition of certain excise taxes. Source: [*The Restriction of Political Campaign Intervention by Section 501(c)(3) Tax-Exempt Organizations* (Updated 9/13/16)](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/the-restriction-of-political-campaign-intervention-by-section-501-c-3-tax-exempt-organizations)
How do we have to contact about this? Is the IRS already on it?
He already got one fine from the IRS for illegally donating to campaign of the attorney general in Florida who was going to investigate Trump university (until the donation happened, at which point the investigation was suddenly dropped).
[Form 13909](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f13909.pdf). It's a complaint form against exempt organizations. All of the information for that will be in the Trump Foundation's Form 990-PF (annual filing form for private foundations). I know their 990-PF is online, so search for that and fill out the form.
Watch out with big fake checks from Trump; you [might find out](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-boasts-of-his-philanthropy-but-his-giving-falls-short-of-his-words/2016/10/29/b3c03106-9ac7-11e6-a0ed-ab0774c1eaa5_story.html#comments) that he doesn't actually give the amount on them. >In 1997, for instance, he was “principal for a day” at a public school in an impoverished area of the Bronx. The chess team was holding a bake sale, Hot & Crusty danishes and croissants. They were $5,000 short of what they needed to travel to a tournament. >Trump had brought something to wow them. >“He handed them a fake million-dollar bill,” said David MacEnulty, a teacher and the chess team’s coach. >The team’s parent volunteers were thrilled. >Then disappointment. >Trump then gave them $200 in real money and drove away in a limousine.
I guess he just couldn't afford it.
Was he all out of laptop batteries or something?
Its the future post-election Trump had brought something to wow them. “He handed them a fake Mexican wall” said David MacEnulty, an ignorant racist redneck The_donatz volunteers were thrilled. Then disappointment. Trump then gave them a red brick and drove away in a Air force One
Amazing.
But emails.
its ironic that if Clinton get arrested and no more email, he will be literary nothing at all. His follower will turn on him and he will become next Hillary, you cant simply satisfied hatefull fanbase.
*trump screws over the money of his loyal supporters and completely humiliates one of his black supporters and screws over his loyal supporters again by using their donations to start his own tv platform* *they still support him* Wolf in sheep's clothing.
But the wolf tells it like it is, so it's algood. We should trust the wolf who has every reason, incentive, and history of screwing over sheep, over the dog who, well... is closely related to wolves, so that's basically the same as a wolf even though the dog has tried to protect sheep before.
It's actually a tactic a lot of abusers and scammers use. They start with small amounts of abuse and/or investment from their victim. And then they scale it up. At a lot of this shit came out now, a lot of Trump's supporters wouldn't go no where near him. But at this point they've defended Trump so much, it's just autopilot for them to defend again.
You have to specify *Clinton* emails. [Trump has e-mail scandals of his own, but almost nobody really cares about those.](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/06/13/trump-accused-destroying-email-evidence-lawsuit-10-years-ago-republican-hillary-president/85795082/)
We need a new rule, like rule 34, every accusation that trump throws, it's a projection of his own behavior. Seriously, there isn't one thing he has ever accused anyone of every that he himself had not done, and more.
Let's see.... .... being a fat pig - [check] (http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2114051/Donald-Trump-proves-really-fat-cat-business-mogul-attends-golf-tournament-daughter-Ivana.html) .... rigging the election - [check](https://www.thenation.com/article/this-election-is-being-rigged/) .... being corrupt - check (see above) .... being a liar - [check] (http://www.politifact.com/personalities/donald-trump/) .... being flat-chested - [check](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2114051/Donald-Trump-proves-really-fat-cat-business-mogul-attends-golf-tournament-daughter-Ivana.html) .... destroying emails- check (see above) .... being a sexual predator - check (i guess we've all seen the tape by now) .... being a coward - [check](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/02/us/politics/donald-trump-draft-record.html) .... going to jail - [kind of] (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lisa-bloom/why-the-new-child-rape-ca_b_10619944.html) .... getting captured - not really, [but there is always hope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFeWTMiduLg) .... being a career politician - nope ... awww. Well, it's still amazing how many things he accuses people of are actual projections.
Don't forget "starting the birther movement"!
[List incomplete]
*slush fund
Does anyone seriously believe that the Trump Foundation had anything to do with charitable intent? Seems more like using other people's money to help himself, and also possibly tax evasion.
Yeah, but think of how many homeless people were able to drink from and/or bathe in that fountain. See? Charity.
I think everyone's just confused. The Donald Trump Foundation isn't a charity BY Donald Trump, but a charity FOR Donald Trump. Of course he runs the best charities only helping the most needy among us!
Guys, law only applies to Clinton, so we need to monitor her every email. Something else that Lie-brals don't understand is that the same day Hillary was born, a storm caused the death of a 5-year-old in Kansas. Now, because of the butterfly effect, if Hillary had never been born then that boy would still be alive. LOCK HER UP!
Is there someone writing all this down -I can't wait to read the book about this entire fiasco of a candidate
I secretly believe that Kellyanne Conway joined the campaign just so she can make millions on the book she's already writing.
Nobody respects donations better than him!
Why am I even surprised anymore? He's a con artist, and the presidency is how he's going to scam America.
So, let me see if I've got this right… 1. People donated money to Trump's foundation. 2. The foundation was presented as a charitable organization. 3. Trump has used the donated money to buy things for himself. Two examples are a fountain outside of one of his hotels and a giant painting of Trump himself for another of his hotels. Is all that correct? Specifically, is #1 correct. Did others give to this scheme of his, or was he the only one donating? (And keep in mind that he hasn't donated to it since 2008.)
I guess the WWE owners/investors the McMahons are said to have given millions to the foundation. Donald probably has some dirt on them.
Two things about this article: 1) Trump does not look happy holding that check. 2) No fucking picture of the fountain! wtf?
Unsurprising. It is a scam operation, after all.
Because he spent $100,000 on the fountain the craftsman who built the fountain was able to open a small business and employ 12 people. /s
That could have happened. If Trump was in the habit of paying people for work they do for him.
And yet it's the Clinton foundation being investigated by the FBI. Keep rolling /r/hillaryforpresident
How does anyone equate Trump's foundation to Clintons? One takes lots of money from foreign leaders to influence our government and avoid campaign finance laws, the other in owned by Trump. As long as you don't donate to Trump foundation you can't complain. Same can't be said for Bill Clinton Inc.
Sure we can. He is running for president, and this goes directly to his dishonesty and character.
Well, compared to the important work The Clinton Foundation did in Haiti...
Trump supporters care about people in Haiti getting exploited over people in America? Just like they care about people who want to kill gays in the Middle East over people who want to kill gays in America? Isn't the whole anti-globalism thing about worrying about problems in your country instead of the other side of the world? Because if it is, you are doing a very good job of hiding it.
You mean the foundation that is rated A+ and is a perfect base for all other foundations to look at? Yea that one.
I think that's the piece of shit foundation he is talking about. And by the way, you can buy yourself an A+ rating for just about anything that is rated. Unfortunately, that is how those rating programs work.
You're thinking of Angie's List or something. The major charity rating organizations don't do that.
If this is true why wouldn't every charity that can afford it by one since presumably they'd get more donations?
Remember when Hillary's brother Tony Rodham got a gold mine in Haiti after the earthquake? Now that is some A+ foundation work.
Lol exactly, I love when people try to make a thing out of the Clinton foundation, they just end up making themselves look foolish.
99% of hillarys charitable donations go to the Clinton foundation which donates 5% of it's proceeds to actual charitable work. And is getting investigated by the FBI as well as being accused of multiple levels of bribery. Sinking ships go down fast!
Clinton Foundation is rated A https://www.charitywatch.org/ratings-and-metrics/bill-hillary-chelsea-clinton-foundation/478
> Clinton foundation which donates 5% of it's proceeds to actual charitable work. You have a source on that claim? [Charity Navigator](https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=16680) has the following numbers for the Clinton Foundation: Program expenses: 86.9% Admin: 8.7% Fundraising: 4.2%
Lol you guys are grasping at straws now. This place is a Hilary circle jerk.
What grasping? This article is more a statement of fact than anything else. Was there some other, larger contribution?
Hi. I'm really a single issue voter, and my issue is the advancement of science and energy. What does trump offer for people like me that I should vote for him? I don't care about rape, emails, donations, whatever. I only care about the advancement of science. Is Trump who I should vote for?
He's calling for yuge budget increases for NASA. That's sciency
"We're going to get the best scientists, all the scientists" sniff "and we're going to get them to do good sciency stuff, we're not going to have them do stupid stuff like studying fruit flies, like Obaama and Crooked Hillary would have them do" sniff "we'll get them to cure cancer and syphilis and stuff that's important. When Ivanka, my beautiful daughter Ivanka, was a sixth grader, she made this wonderful, and I mean it was gorgeous, model of the solar system for her science project, of course she got the highest mark possible, so we'll have my Ivanka look into the scientists."
luckily now that we know global warming is a chinese hoax we can funnel all the money spent researching it towards other scientific pursuits!

His foundation has been in the spotlight for a while now
And honestly, so has Clinton's foundation. Someone's just being sore he lost the election.
