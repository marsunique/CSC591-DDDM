[He claims he never met her at the hotel. I'd wager good money That Gloria can prove this fact via some physical evidence.]
[Claimed he never met Leeds then he had a self proclaimed pimp place them together.... ...but nothing happened....]
[He specificied a decade ago while the incident was 9 years ago. I wonder if that was intentional.]
[He specified ALMOST a decade ago.]
[Gloria is a legal pitbull. If you read her history she doesn't take cases unless she can turn it into a serious slam dunk win. She is not in the business of losing.]
[They're baiting him, Allred definitely has some sort of smoking gun]
[Gloria Allred isn't a great lawyer IMHO, we all remember her work in Yeaw v. Boy Scouts of America, Miller v Schwarzenegger, among many other examples. She's a bombastic tv lawyer that happened to be in the right place at the right time when cable news started interviewing lawyers in the '80s and '90s. But she's pretty bad at actual law.]
[Could you elaborate?]
[no no I think this random redditor is right, I mean she's only been involved in a few landmark cases that radically changed the USA's political landscape, she's really not that great at what she does despite having *legalized abortion everywhere forever*.]
[Except she hasn't, and you forgot to mention her work with the Dworkin-MacKinnon Ordinance]
[Weren't you swearing up and down that HRC was going to catch an indictment from Comey, or was that a different redditor?]
[I wouldn't be so quick to judge based on that. While I'm rather poorly informed (having not heard of her until reading through her bio and wiki page earlier) and not an expert on law by any means, from what I have read, she is a battle tested lawyer who really knows how to handle all aspects of a case. It's likely that she is not the greatest at practicing law in the strictest sense of the phrase, she isn't someone to take lightly. I think that this could be very bad news for Trump; I look forward to seeing how the case(s) play out.]
[She came after with a sexual assault allegation against Schwarzenegger in '06-07ish and had it thrown out, she lost in her only appearance before the scotus (that I'm aware of) in an attempt to force the Boy Scouts to accept girls, and she's more a cable tv personality than a lawyer. I say that as a lawyer too.]
[I don't agree that two failed cases of the many she has taken on in her career is indicative of her being a bad lawyer, but that is simply my opinion.]
[She's the Al Sharpton of lawyers.]
[Just how old are you?]
[I met my wife while stationed in West Berlin, if that gives you an idea]
[Ohh I see you just don't pay attention to the women's rights cases then...]
[She is a master baiter^I'm^so^sorry^... Seriously though, this is good stuff.]
[Trump has continued to call these women liars after the press conference, [including on Twitter the morning after](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/787258211283918848), which gives them the opening they need for a defamation suit. It's coming, they are just giving him rope.]
[Allred has already said she has more accusers. This is just the first salvo of her legal strategy. Allred could care less about the election, she's going to nail Donnie's ass to the wall.]
[Allred is scary good. He should be worried. And her daughter, Lisa Bloom, is representing another one.]
[I had said this before, but i asked a friends dad who is a retired lawyer about her. "I would sooner pick a fight with Loretta Lynch than Gloria Allred".]
[> He should be worried. Which of course means that he isn't.]
[Well if he accuses Hillary of being worried we'll know he is.]
[Allred doesn't fuck around. He's fucked.]
[Between Allred and AllOrange, I'll take Allred every day of the week and twice on Sunday.]
[I will always choose duck allorange, though.]
[Allred Everything]
[Allred from her wherevers!]
[I'd vote Eva over Trump.]
[Eva / No Sleeves 2016]
[Lol]
[MostlyOrange (except around the eyes where it's white)]
[That's so he doesn't get confused and think he's another race and start attacking himself.]
[And the belly, which is yellow.]
[I really wish there was some sort of security camera footage of Trump assaulting one of these women. Judging by the places Trump has done it, it seems likely there would have at least been at one point or another actual video of him doing it, even if it was deleted years ago. Beyond partisan politics, Trump shouldn't be able to just walk away from this kind of abuse, but he probably will just fine.]
[There's almost certainly footage, but there's probably a mountain of NDAs between us and them, either from them taking place inside his companies/properties, or taking place on shows that can't risk admitting that they let this happen on their watch.]
[While true. Not much security footage is kept without reason. We've only just entered the age of cloud storage and affordable mass back ups. Before that keeping something for more than 6 months was practically unheard of]
[Yes. I'm a criminal defense lawyer and I often subpoena video. Most places overwrite their videos within a week, some within 24 hours if there was no "incident." Even today.]
[> criminal defense lawyer Isn't that job title kind of begging the question? Fox pundit: "If he didn't do it, why did he need a *criminal defense* lawyer? Tell me that!"]
[Ha. We use the term to define the type of law (criminal), not the client!]
[Off-topic: But here's [Captain Disillusion debunking the Disneyland Ghost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE1OmvERQek). (hint: it has to do with how much they re-record over the same tapes over and over again)]
[tapes? Just go to Fry's and buy a disk drive specifically built for sequential video.]
[If it ain't broke, don't fix it.]
[That costs money.]
[Man that joke about Orlando early on didn't age well.]
[The fact that she's on this case proves there is real substance. She wouldn't mess with it if it was bogus]
[Her Wikileaks email shows her saying Trump must be stopped way before this came out. And Servos's cousin said she's had nothing but nice things to say about Trump to their family. And years later this is released. Sounds like a hit job.]
[>Her Wikileaks email shows her saying Trump must be stopped way before this came out. Ok? Quite a few of us agreed that Trump was a mega-deplorable choice before pussygate. She's a democrat women's rights lawyer. I'd expect nothing less. Doesn't mean she's going to put her reputation on the line taking on a bullshit case. If she's taking him on, you can bet it's because she has something. Unlike Trump, she has a lifetime of actual success to back it up.]
[Wikileaks email? Can you show me what you're talking about?]
[https://wikileaks.org/dnc-emails/emailid/20593]
[The cousin that was fired a while back by said famity?]
[I disagree. Disclaimer I think Trump is a massive asshole and the over under that he did some if not all of these things wouldn't win anyone money in Vegas. Allred is taking a sure thing right now with or without "substance" IMO: 1. If Trump loses the election he either disappears into thin air (Allred gets some free publicity for standing up for women's rights) or he begins the process of suing these women for defamation (boom Allred gets paid and more publicity) 2. If Trump somehow defies logic and wins the election at least one of these women will take him to court. I have no fucking clue how that plays out in the grand scheme of things (auto impeachment?) but Allred *definitely* gets paid and publicity. I'm not taking away from her nobility on the issue, but at the end of the day it's usually about the bread for lawyers. I'm sure there are plenty foaming at the mouth for an opportunity to get in on this action. Trump more than likely is guilty based solely on public opinion at this point. Doesn't even matter if he did do anything...how do you find an unbiased jury for a case like this? Or a judge for that matter?]
[> at the end of the day it's usually about the bread for lawyers. Gloria Allred is the kind of lawyer who needs neither money nor fame, having already achieved both.]
[... How much do you know about Allred?]
[Zero I bet. The woman was part of Roe VS Wade and Prop 8 for fuck sake.]
[>Zero I bet. The woman was part of Roe VS Wade and Prop 8 for fuck sake. What was her role in Roe v Wade?]
[What about her being in some of the latest leaks openly releasing the DNCs "propaganda"?]
[Ive seen this comment quite frequently in the comments sections of posts about this issue. Can you explain or point me to a link that explains why people say this?]
[Just google her. Gloria Allred is one of the highest-profile, most famous, most successful civil rights lawyers (especially of feminist, sexual harassment and discrimination cases) of our time. She was the lawyer for Norma McCorvey, the "Roe" of Roe vs. Wade. She's a serious attorney, and when she takes high-profile cases, she doesn't do it to lose. Her reputation is so great it would be crazy of her to accept the case without some serious proof that she can defend her client.]
[>She was the lawyer for Norma McCorvey, the "Roe" of Roe vs. Wade. But she was not McCorvey's lawyer in Roe v Wade...]
[Sorry about that, my comment was a little misleading, re-reading it, but I didn't say she was the lawyer "**in** Roe vs. Wade" - [she *was* McCorvey's lawyer](\https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/roe_wade_allred_ap_img.jpg) (who *was* Roe **of** Roe vs. Wade) - she defended her in another case later on that attempted to overturn the original ruling. My point was just that she takes significant clients and high-profile cases.]
[She's a fairly well known celebrity lawyer, focusing mainly on women's rights... she made her reputation winning the Roe vs Wade case before the supreme court, and most recent by taking down both Bill Cosby and the Catholic Church for their sex scandals. If she's on Trump, she knows she can take him down HARD: http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-07-19/why-they-all-want-gloria-allred So yeah, Trump's fucked.]
[> she made her reputation winning the Roe vs Wade case before the supreme court ...Are you sure about this? She wasn't even admitted to the bar when Roe v Wade was decided.]
[https://www.thenation.com/article/january-22-1973-roe-v-wade-supreme-court-legalizes-abortion-all-fifty-states/ Literally a picture with her client 'Jane Roe'. Where did you get your information from?]
[This is extremely confusing. According to her wikipedia page she didn't graduate or pass the bar until '75.]
[>https://www.thenation.com/article/january-22-1973-roe-v-wade-supreme-court-legalizes-abortion-all-fifty-states/ >Literally a picture with her client 'Jane Roe'. Where did you get your information from? Did you read the caption for that picture? It's from 1989. Allred was admitted to the bar in 1975:. http://members.calbar.ca.gov/fal/Member/Detail/65033 Roe v Wade was decided in 1973 (and began much earlier than that). Roe's lawyers were Linda Coffee and Sarah Weddington: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade Where did you get your information from?]
[You're right, my mistake. "During the landmark court case of Roe v. Wade, one of the key figures was Norma McCorvey, a woman who was trying to get an abortion in Texas, a state that only allows the procedure to be conducted in cases of incest and rape. Though Gloria Allred was not involved in the court case itself, she represented Norma McCorvey and helped her adjust to being a public figure after her alias was lifted and her name became famous." A lot of articles loosely attributing Allred to Roe v Wade. Nonetheless, she's had an impressive career as a lawyer.]
[She has had a very successful career. Not suggesting otherwise. Just clearing up a misconception that had popped up several times in this thread.]
[[thumbs up]]
[Check her background and history. She's no ambulance chaser. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloria_Allred]
[She is one of the Terry Tate's of the legal world. If she is after you... pain trains comin' WOOO WOOOO!!!]
[This is anecdotal, so do with it what you will, but my lawyer works with her a lot, and I spoke with him a couple days ago, after the press conference. He told me she is one of the rare really brilliant legal minds of a generation - she's a shark, but never takes a case that she can't absolutely prove or where she smells even a whiff of bullshit. If she's representing this woman, she's not making it up.]
[Yup. I'm half expecting her to have a photograph of Trump literally pussy grabbing the victim.]
[I don't think she would have been on the case if the woman wasn't on the Apprentice. I think the whole thing is a perfect set-up to take down Trump if he bites.]
[He bites, opens up lawsuit, tapes become evidence?]
[What tapes? What exactly do we think could have been video taped that had anything to do with the incident at the hotel?]
[We won't know until we check 'em. Seriously, though, they could claim the tapes would show some sort of strange behavior towards her or even a relevant statement when she was out of the room.]
[I am no lawyer but there better be something more substantial than that]
[yup]
[They can also sue him for defamation if he starts attacking them. I feel like the whole thing is going to end in a lot of settlements.]
[They can also sue him for defamation for simply denying it happened since denying it basically calling her a liar. Happened to Cosby.]
[No, that's just fucking dangerous for the legal system to allow. People have the right to defend themselves publicly.]
[Depends on what he says.]
[Not if they are lying... if he says "I dont recall ever doing that" then he's fine. But if he does what he ALWAYS does and calls her a tramp/shill/liar then she can sue for defamation. Basically he's trapped. He's called his previous occusers liars directly... if he says "I do not recall" he looks guilty as hell. If he calls her a liar he'll get sued and his creepiness will be fully exposed. Not before the election mind you but over then next several years... which will be a massive thorn in the side of the Republican party who would love to pretend Trump never existed.]
[I do not recall? I wonder who else said that a bunch of times during a legal hearing? Could it have been someone also running for president?]
[Nobody says Hillary is perfect. That doesn't make Drumpf any better a candidate.]
[You would actually expect most people who understand the legal system to say something along the lines of "I don't recall" many times in a deposition. Here is a lawyer explaining how easily you can incriminate yourself to the police, even if you're not guilty: https://youtu.be/i8z7NC5sgi]
[His point was legally I do not recall safeguards you better than any other statement, as long as it's not provable that you definitely were aware. Clinton may be guilty of something, but there has been no official charges pressed. So obviously the legal system is lacking the tools necessary, or she simply isn't anything but extremely careless. And yes that's not good for a president, if they didn't learn from it. And less be fair her emails issue is miles less worse than the Bush administration's email issue. So obviously the litigators who should be fixing this problem don't want to. We need to elect Congress people who want to solve loopholes in our nations security like this. But the issue there is the specific issue is too small to be large campaign issue even for Congress people.]
[>"I would suggest to Mr. Trump that he rein himself in and stop attacking women and stop attacking accusers," she said. It's so obvious she's baiting him and so obvious he's going to take it.]
[The media need to just commit to repeating that quote to him verbatim and asking for a response at every opportunity.]
[C'mon Trumpy, say something about her. Something nasty. I want Allred to nail you to the fucking wall.]
[Hey now, let's not give Trumpy a bad name. If anyone else here has seen Pod People let's not offend the true Trumpy.... http://www.ew.com/sites/default/files/styles/tout_image_gallery_612/public/i/2014/07/01/Pod-People-Trumpy.jpg?itok=__nIix7l]
[It's so obvious this is the plan and I think he's going to fall for it.]
[I guarantee you someone in the campaign has already warned him he's being played, but he'll *still* take the bait. Just like during both debates with Hillary. You know he was warned but he just can't help himself. He's so thin-skinned he is unable to let any slight go unchallenged.]
[I just read this and I want to help make it at thing, but doesn't the name: Trumplethinskin just have a nice ring to it?]
[When would it be best for here to dump whatever she has? If it is before the debate it sets up for making the debate even more damaging for him but could get drowned out somewhat by the debate. If she does it after it needs to be long enough after so it isn't drowned out by the dumpster fire Trump will cause at the debate. Also the longer she waits the more early voting is already completed.]
[What from the article makes us believe she has something to drop? This only said that a separate witness came forward to corroborate the story was told 5 years ago. Nothing indicating a shoe drop. Am I missing pieces to this situation? Also shame on that fucking cousin. It blows my mind that we are witnessing victim blaming from politicians and family members on a national level. What the fuck has Trump uncovered with this shit show of a campaign.]
[I'd wait until a week or two after the debate, right when his polls start to recover, that way the next week's news cycle is absorbed with this story and by election day it's too late for him to recover.]
[I think a lot of people here are missing the bigger picture. Allred's involvement means he's probably fucked no matter what happens in this election. There's a reason they staged a press conference and keep bringing in witnesses to corroborate this story.]
[Yeah, I'm with you there. I don't feel much of a political undertone to the proceedings; the circumstances have simply allowed for the case to become more viable. Judging by Allred's case history, the heightened public interest in Trump plays perfectly to her usual legal strategy (press conferences and relative transparency as a means of rallying support for her client). It will be interesting to see how she plays it and how well the signal is heard through all the noise that this election has been producing...]
[Would she even release it outside of a court case? I don't understand why you would be flaunting your evidence before a trial.]
[Maybe to spur a settlement.]
[She realistically needs to release it by this weekend. Enough time so that the raucous from the debate has died down.]
[I don't think it's about the election. It's about taking the man down. They're waiting for a concrete claim that this particular woman is lying to drop the gauntlet.]
[> I don't think it's about the election. I think it is. Allred asks for the Apprentice tapes to be released before the election - as soon as possible. It's also about taking him down if he did what he is alleged to.]
[This is what I think people are missing. This isn't political. It's simply that the spotlight on Trump has opened an opportunity for justice that was unrealistic before. No one should rely on this case being convenient for the campaign at all.]
[Yep, I think Allred will avoid making it a political issue and will base her actions solely on evidence and the wishes of her client(s).]
[Allred already made it political when she talked about Trump's campaign for 5 minutes with Zervos, and furthermore she's all over the Podesta emails because she's a major Democratic contributor]
[Didn't she donate $2700? More than the average person but certainly not a major democratic contributor.]
[Probably involved in Super PACs too.]
[And after Trump loses he's got jail time to look forward to. It'll be sweet, delicious irony considering how many people he's called to be imprisoned.]
[Jail time from what? There's only civil suits against him, and considering it's a corporate deal, I don't think Trump U will get him tossed in.]
[I just rewatched it. Didn't hear anything to suggest Gloria is anything but a lawyer representing her client against Trump. There may be some political context due to the environment of the case but that isn't driving the case. If Trump says something in a political debate, that becomes part of the record that could be used in court.]
[> "the whitehouse is not a lockerroom"..."this office of the president of the united states is not reserved for the worst of us" oh come off it, Gloria Allred made it very political. And look at the Podesta emails, Clinton's staff can't stand her because she's so forceful with the Democratic party]
[The world can't stand Trump because he's so forceful with women.]
[But early voting is taking place while Clinton has an enormous lead.]
[I think we can all agree that if you're the type of person who's passionate enough to vote early, you're the type of person who isn't going to switch candidates. It's not like the choice is between vanilla and chocolate this year. It's more like the choice is between sandpaper and nuclear waste.]
[The lead can never be big enough with who she is running against.]
[Look out, here comes TzTrump-Jad!]
[Seriously. Kick this asshole while he's down.]
[I love how a forum for politics is basically a cheer squad for this corrupt woman.]
[It says something about how terrifying her opponent is.]
[Meanwhile the current administration is flirting with a war with Russia...]
[Yeah, why can't they just ignore what Russia is doing?]
[Better than a Trump administration straight up flirting with Russia.]
[I'd rather flirt than fight]
[If those assholes would stop trying to manipulate our elections it would be cool.]
[See but there is zero proof of that. Remember what happened last time we started a war with zero proof?]
[[You're goddamn right.](http://i.giphy.com/U1XhGr8CWqvVC.gif)]
[Slightly disappointed, thought that was going to be an Al Gore gif with text that says "You're goddamn right".]
[gore.gif "Well, I would say, that the magnitude with which you've managed to come into a position that matches the facts at hand, The Lord above condemning you with all his power would do little to obscure the alignment of your statement with true nature of the aforementioned comment."]
[Exactly! This man needs to be put away. I mean ridiculous double digit lead. The country needs to send a message that the type of crap he's been spewing does not and WILL not fly with the rest of us. It needs to be crystal clear to anyone who may come after him (and the GOP in general) in case another nut case decides to rise up in the same way he did.]
[As soon as he insults her, they can sue for defamation. Allred is going to keep dropping little things until he makes a bad move.]
[What more does she need? He already called it a lie.]
[While calling it a lie could be taken as defamation of character, it would be likely to get thrown out (as it, to my understanding, was a public denial of an action rather than a direct comment on or judgement of the person). I have a feeling Allred is hoping that trump drops some nasty comments about the accusers (or herself), however, it is difficult to say what her strategy is without knowing what she has as far as evidence/testimony.]
[> As soon as he insults her, they can sue for defamation. Would calling her a liar be enough? He already did that.]
[She must fly fish on the weekends.]
[But the fish is fucked up and strikes at anything remotely shiny and glistening.... Or you know, pussy....]
[If it's shiny and glistening that's the perfect time to strike.]
[Crush him Gloria, I want to see his REAL meltdown, the one where he knows he's lost and throws an epic tantrum where even his most die hard supporters begin to quietly back away and act like they never really were gonna vote for him.]
[You're gonna be sooo salty when he wins]
[> his most die hard supporters trump supporters want this to go even further. their aching for any chance to open fire on americans. and maybe a good röhm putsch to remove any "rinos".]
[This will never happen. Sadly. His supporters are lemmings.]
[You uncultured swine, Lemmings are majestic as fuck. Don't degrade such cute and noble animal like that! His supporters don't even deserve to be considered Lemming shit.]
[[Let's talk about Lemmings](https://youtu.be/F9-iSl_eg5U)]
[I would cry with joy if this happened. I sincerely, passionately hate the cult of Trump. It's like some sort of fucking Body Snatcher shit that takes over a person.]
['Body snatcher' is the new 'dog whistle' right? It's hard to keep up with all this new vocabulary.]
['Body snatcher' suggests someone has been replaced with someone that mostly looks and acts the same, but something is... off. From wiki, on the [movie, Invasion of the Body Snatchers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_the_Body_Snatchers): >Alien plant spores have fallen from space and grown into large seed pods, each one capable of reproducing a duplicate replacement copy of each human. As each pod reaches full development, it assimilates the physical characteristics, memories, and personalities of each sleeping person placed near it; these duplicates, however, *are devoid of all human emotion*. Italics added by me. I'm not sure what 'dog whistle' refers to? Some unheard sound which affects behavior?]
[Yes. A "dog whistle" is used to describe things politicians say which are ways to talk about generally unpopular things (like racist language) but which appeal to the base supporters. [This](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/08/trump_s_outreach_to_black_voters_is_a_dog_whistle_for_racists.html) example article may help.]
[Using the word "snatch" with respect to Trump probably brings in a different connotation]
[I want it to be a week or two before election day, Allred and Summer have produced something damming (video footage, a "trophy book" of his sexual conquests, something on that level) and Trump's on FOX and friends to do spin. He's visibly sweating and furious, someone throws him a low-ball journalist, "Well Mr. Trump, these allegations are awfully compelling," and he just loses it and calls Allred, Summer, Clinton the C-word, says how he wishes he never got into the race, how everyone's against him, just raving like a lunatic.]
[Trump going full Stillson from *The Dead Zone* would be beautiful.]
[I'm trying to imagine the equivalent of using a child as a human shield in lieu of legal accusations, but my imagination fails me.]
[To even admit to being a witness in these cases takes a great deal of courage. These people will be attacked in over the top and disgusting ways merely for speaking the truth.]
[> speaking the truth. haha]
[Let's give Trumpy the benefit of the doubt for a minute and assume that every single one of his current accusers are lying. That doesn't change the fact that he bragged about groping women, so we know that *somewhere* out there are women he has assaulted.]
[Yeah, it is funny how screwed Trump is.]
[He's not.]
[Well let's check back after election night, on November 29th. Oh right, the 28th is his fraud trial.]
[It's Novemberary 28th, get it right for God's sake. This is an important election.]
[He won't win the election at least.]
[ive been told by reddit that trump wont even win the republican nomination]
[He has no chance. Jeb Bush is going to win the primary.]
[Trump bragged about sexual assault and you don't belive them? i get the "innocent until proven guilty" but the mans sick.]
[> i get the "innocent until proven guilty" obviously not lol]
[No one is suggesting that he should be locked up without a fair trial. https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/57jp4u/how_does_donald_trump_still_have_supporters/d8sm8gh You on the other hand are acting like a god damned fool.You're accusing Hillary of corruption and treason, and you chose this moment to defend Trump against allegations of sexual assault. This, dispite having multiple accusers, a history of really inappropriate behavior, and having gloated about doing exactly what he is being accused of. He's innocent until proven guilty. But you would have to be blind or stupid to ignore what he has said and done so far.]
[Question for you. Do you believe that Donald has never sexually assaulted a woman?]
[That's the problem - it's all about what people believe right now. People _believe_ Clinton is selling out the American tax payer to the highest bidder, but there's about as much evidence of that as there is that Trump is a sexual predator.]
[Not exactly fair. There is a video of trump admitting he's a sexual predator.]
[Is there a video of Clinton saying she is selling out the American tax payer? If not, the level of evidence is clearly not the same.]
[Their potential smoking guns were the paid speeches... but then they got leaked, and it was revealed Clinton told Wall Street the same shit she told everyone else: she wants universal healthcare, tax hikes on the super rich, and banking reform.]
[He was proven guilty by his own words...]
[> He was proven guilty by his own words... I wouldn't go that far. I'm about the furthest you can get from a Trump supporter, but I'm also a lawyer. His words potentially indicate a pattern of conduct, but he didn't specifically confess to assaulting this woman. Do they suggest it could have happened? Sure, but nothing's been "proven."]
[He says that he assaults women. It might not be this woman, definitely, but he clearly admits to acts that constitute sexual assault.]
[But it's not a crime to *say* you assault someone. An assault requires a specific victim. What he said doesn't make him look *good*, and it suggests that he *has* sexually assaulted women in the past, but his words are not "proof" that he assaulted *this* woman or any other of his accusers that have come forward.]
[I'm not saying that his words are a crime, I'm saying his words are an admission of a crime. It's not illegal to *say* you killed someone, but if you tell that to the police they're going to use your words against you. >but his words are not "proof" that he assaulted this woman or any other of his accusers that have come forward. I didn't say they were. But they are proof (no quotes needed) that he has committed sexual assault on somebody.]
[> I didn't say they were. But they are proof (no quotes needed) that he has committed sexual assault on somebody. Again, a crime requires a victim. Tupac Shakur could rap about killing people every day and we couldn't arrest him for it. If someone came and said, "Hey, Tupac killed my friend and rapped about it," then the police might look into it. The statements alone are not proof that he did anything. I can say I walked on the moon--my statement is not proof that I actually did it, but simply evidence that may make the truth of it more or less likely. Trump's statements alone are similarly not proof that he committed any physical act. They provide evidence that he *may* have done the things he claimed he did on the tape, but it's not proof in and of itself. So no, his words *aren't* proof that he has committed sexual assault on somebody. That's not how the law works.]

[What a shitty blogspam of a source. Here's the real article: http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2016/04/27/donald-trump-protest-anaheim-pepper-spray/ DON'T CALL ANYBODY.]
[Dude please. There's way more ammo against Trump here. If you're smart enough to post on reddit, I imagine you can figure out a Google search.]
[If someone said this already feel free to downvote: Guliani believes in coincidence but ignores the screaming coincidence that Trump talks about sexual assault and woman say they've been assaulted by Trump]
[Allred is baiting Trump into suing and then hitting him with a counter suit.]
[I think we've reached the point where it makes sense to assume his accusers are telling the truth.]
[For reasonable people, it makes sense. But for Trump supporters they're lying because they just magically forgot until a month before the election]
[In a weird way I don't blame them; people always give extra benefit of the doubt to the people they support. It's like how so many knicks fans were in denial over the Derrick Rose scandal. Just because he was wearing their jersey they gave him a mental pass. I think it goes back to us being tribal in nature. We defend the people that we see as our own. In general I think Trump supporters are a bit off, but if this happened to any candidate you'd see droves of people saying it wasn't true. This just is enhanced right now because of the nature of these...supporters. I'm not trying to make a point one way or the other though, just make a general comment on how people behave in certain situations.]
[His campaign manager *used* to agree with the following statement: > Every survivor of sexual assault deserves to be heard, believed, and supported. https://mobile.twitter.com/KellyannePolls/status/785269953700171776]
[She was ripping on Hillary for saying that then turning around and not believing the people that came out against Bill Clinton.]
[Yes, and look how quickly that losing strategy was turned around on him. Clinton team playing 3D chess.]
[I don't understand what was turned around on who. What are you talking about?]
[Trump: Bill Clinton's accusers must be believed and supported. *10 women accuse Trump of assault and harassment* Trump: These women are liars, the system is rigged, I'm going to sue all of them.]
[That's not something Trump ever said. That is something Hillary said.]
[Right but his campaign manager tried to spin it and say "Remember when you said this, we agree" as he had the press conference with Clinton's accusers. At the beginning of the presser he called them courageous and said he was honored to support them. And it failed because oops, he has his own accusers now.]
[I can't see anywhere in what you just wrote Trump saying all women should be believed.]
[He didn't. But he doesn't need to. He clearly argued that Clinton's accusers should be believed and supported, but not his own, despite the fact that there's just as much if not more evidence to back up his accusers than Clinton's (and Clinton is of course not running.) And his campaign backed up that decision by tweeting "RT if you agree, "every" being the operative word" and a quote from HRC about believing all women. If you can't see how all these recent accusations have this flying back in his face, then I can't help you. He shouldn't have to say it word for word for you to get the point. He thinks his opponent's accusers are brave and is honored to give them a platform, but thinks his own should be silenced.]
[Which part? A quick google search and you can find recent videos of Trump saying all that shit.]
[They didn't even have to do anything though, thats the best part. He's playing chess against himself.]
[All chess is 3D.]
[Electronic chess is 2D]
[Nope. If it were it would end at the same time it began.]
[When someone publicly says she was raped, then swears in court that she wasn't... I'll believe what she said under oath]
[Not to mention the exact opposite situation being true of the drumpster.]
[To be fair I think most people would side with their spouses against rape accusations without further evidence. I'd believe anyone else but I have no shame in admitting I'm biased when it comes to my husband.]
[Your husband is probably a man that doesn't rape people. If you knew your husband raped women would you still support him?]
[If I knew my husband raped someone during our time together I would not. But how would I know? Video tape? A confession? If it is he said she said, then I would believe my husband. I married him because he is a good man.]
[You mean if someone came forward with more evidence than just their word? Sure I'd turn against him. But no one has come forward with any evidence beyond just their word for Bill Clinton either -- and no, his consensual affairs are not evidence. You can be a cheater without being a rapist. Seriously, I don't know how old you are but I get the feeling you aren't old enough to remember the media and congressional shitstorm surrounding Bill's sex life. House and Senate republicans were going nuts trying to find *anything*, including credible rape accusations. All they could get him for was lying about a consensual affair under oath. All this shit about Bill is old, *old* shit. It's been run into the fucking ground. It's not a media conspiracy that it's not bigger news right now, it's because *we've already done this stupid song and dance.*]
[I have a 10 minute limit on replies so I'm having trouble replying to everyone here. Monica Lewinsky was found to have had sexual relations with Bill after he came out and said he did not. I'm on my phone so it's hard to link articles, but there you go legitimate proof. It's hard to keep track of all of the Trump accusers, but I feel most of them have been debunked when people close to them came out and said they only had glowing things to say about Trump. None of this stuff has come out for 30 years. He was not always a popular guy in NYC. Do you think no one would have dug up any of this dirt in 30 years? Idk it just seems too convenient to me. I am 27. I remember Bill getting impeached and how big of a deal it was.]
[>Monica Lewinsky was found to have had sexual relations with Bill after he came out and said he did not. I'm on my phone so it's hard to link articles, but there you go legitimate proof. Of a consensual affair. So what? Again, **you can be a cheater without being a rapist.** >I feel most of them have been debunked when people close to them came out and said they only had glowing things to say about Trump. And both women who accused Bill of rape recanted under oath, so exactly what standard are you going by here? Or does the standard change based on which person you like more? >None of this stuff has come out for 30 years. He was not always a popular guy in NYC. Do you think no one would have dug up any of this dirt in 30 years? I do think the access Hollywood tape was intentionally released this close to the election as part of a strategy to destroy Trump's campaign, yes. But strategy or not, it doesn't change the fact that he said those things. And I don't actually think it's strange at all that many of these women waited until now to say anything -- because once that tape was released, they suddenly had corroborating evidence. The number 1 concern women have after being assaulted is that no one will believe them, and that fear was taken care of the moment that tape hit the media. But you know what? Not all of these claims are new. Trump has had allegations made against him for *decades.* But they were all ignored until the bus tape came out (further proving why most of these women didn't say anything until now). Let's give Trump the benefit of the doubt for a moment. Let's assume every single one of the dozen+ women who have come forward are lying. It doesn't change the fact that *somewhere*, there are women Trump has assaulted, because he himself said there are. There is no such admission from Bill, ever.]
[Do you have a link to where Trump says there are women out there he has assaulted?]
[Wow... You're kidding right?]
[https://youtu.be/IY8FwWwIVyQ?t=1m32s If you don't think that's a description of sexual assault then please remove yourself from civilization. The Alaskan wilderness is a great place for you to have a go at it, away from all this librul meedya]
[These are major major accusations and the news agencies are not gonna make a fool of themself by faking it .. Just imagine what would happen if they are found bogus. Probably the only thing that may sound fishy is the timing and every trump supporter I talk with bring that their defense. But on a separate note this is the time of the year where almost everyone start following the circus and the media nailed it with their timing . I personally don't know what happened in the Republican convention until they finalized their top 3 candidates and there a good number of ppl who start following only after the first presidential debate.]
[What about the Clinton campaign making a fake Craigslist post: https://wikileaks.org/dnc-emails/emailid/12803]
[> A willingness to evaluate other women’s hotness for the boss’ satisfaction is a plus Lol, seems like they're joking around.]
[They talked about making a spoof of a Craigslist post in what's called a "microsite," which is a site on a separate domain designed to be one or two pages targeting a very specific thing -- basically glorified advertisements. [fu2016](https://www.fu2016.com/) is one example. They weren't trying to make it look like Trump's company actually placed it on Craigslist. They were making an anti-Trump political microsite styled like a Craigslist post. It probably would have sat on something like "workingfordonald.com" and had links to hillaryclinton.com.]
[I don't know exactly, but I can take a guess. It's a spoof job listing from May with bullet points mentioning a few ongoing news stories back then vis-a-vis Trump and professional women (the breast pump thing, hotness ratings, weight gain, etc). The campaign folks are talking about sending it to Perkins...I assume the law firm and to vet the language. And they say it's for "a microsite", which I'd guess is probably a one-off website for a specific ad campaign. Putting those together, my guess is that they were pitching building a spoof web site to along with an ad campaign aimed at women voters and mocking qualities that Trump was on record about wrt female employees. It wouldn't have been Trump-friendly, obviously, but I can't think of anything nefarious about it. I mean, the content of the ad is obviously over-the-top and about news stories at the time. It's not like that could have been presented as a "real" job listing, if that's what you're getting at. You seem to think it's important though. What exactly do you think it was?]
["This will be a microsite", i.e., it was not to be an ad actually posted to Craigslist, but a web site that showed what an honest Trump job ad would look like. What's your point, and what does it have to do with the comment you replied to?]
[It had to with the fact that the poster I replied to said there was nothing fishy other than the timing. I believe Hillary is digging these stories up to try to hand wave away Bill Clinton's accusations. If she can try to put into the public mind that Trump might have raped someone, what Bill Clinton did is inconsequential. You can take the moral high road and say that Trump might have done it too.]
[> I believe Hillary is digging these stories up to try to hand wave away Bill Clinton's accusations. Lol these "accusations" have been around for 20 years and thoroughly investigated! There is nothing to hand wave away - all of these women have been known about since the 90s. Were you not around during Ken Starr? This is all EVERYONE talked about on the news and in every paper. Starr was out for Bills head - he was looking for anything to hang him with, and even **he** said they weren't credible.]
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton_sexual_misconduct_allegations#Juanita_Broaddrick Ken Starr only dealth with Willey. He might not have raped any of them, but he did settle with Paula Jones and was disbarred for misrepresentations during the trial. In there is an interesting tidbit "Jones's lawyers decided to show the court a pattern of behavior by Clinton of repeatedly becoming sexual involved with state or government employees." Think about that how you will. Frankly there is no proof either person raped anyone. There is proof that Bill had sexual relations with people other than Hillary. There is no proof Trump had sexual relations with anyone other than his wife.]
[Well, except for the proof that the drumpster raped his ex-wife...]
[>Ken Starr only dealth with Willey What? Starr granted Broaddrick immunity to speak to him and found nothing she said credible or relevant to his investigation. > he did settle with Paula Jones After a judge dismissed her case against Clinton, he settled in exchange for her dropping her appeal. Paula Jones had a massive grudge against him, to the point where she secretly recorded conversations without consent, in which she manipulated the conversation to get people to say what she wanted. > There is no proof Trump had sexual relations with anyone other than his wife. Hahahahahahahahahhahahahahaha are you serious??? The man who has been married 3 times and has openly cheated Ivana? Literally openly cheated on Ivana with Marla Seriously, do you not know that he is known for being a serial adulterer in New York, going back nearly 30 years?? He's admitted it himself, many, many times!]
[> He didn't say he'd like to kiss women and grab their pussies without asking, he said he actually does it. He doesn't even wait. He just does it. You're right I'm sorry. I'm replying to multiple people and it's hard because this stupid subreddit makes me wait 10 minutes before another post. > After a judge dismissed her case against Clinton, he settled in exchange for her dropping her appeal. Paula Jones had a massive grudge against him, to the point where she secretly recorded conversations without consent, in which she manipulated the conversation to get people to say what she wanted. There's a lot more to it than that. They settled after: 1) 3 years of Clinton stalling saying the incident in question happened before his term in office and the suit should be delayed until after he is out. This went all the way to the Supreme Court before it was unanimously voted against allowing the case to proceed. 2) A little over another year later Clinton files for a motion to dismissal which was granted due to "ruling Jones had not shown she suffered damages and failed to show Clinton's actions were "outrageous conduct."' 3) This was appealed and another 6 months after this Clinton settles for the ENTIRE amount of her claim. > Hahahahahahahahahhahahahahaha are you serious??? The man who has been married 3 times and has openly cheated Ivana? Literally openly cheated on Ivana with Marla Seriously, do you not know that he is known for being a serial adulterer in New York, going back nearly 30 years?? He's admitted it himself, many, many times! You're right. I'm sorry again. I'm replying to multiple posts and got mixed up. I meant no proof that he was raping any girls, but there really is no proof of rape either for Bill so this point is gone. It is a VERY hard charge to prove though especially years later.]
[Yep, the case took a long time. Civil cases can take forever to even get to a courtroom. Sucks, but that's the way the system is - it tries to encourage parties to come to a settlement before it reaches a courtroom. I didn't realize this myself until I testified as a witness in federal court. The legal system in general is not at all what you see on TV or read about. > This was appealed and another 6 months after this Clinton settles for the ENTIRE amount of her claim. Yeah, that's not odd at all. If he had gone to trial, he would've had to pay his own lawyers - likely a similar amount to what he paid her, actually. It's a reasonable and calculated decision. Besides, if you're implying that because he settled, theres an implication of guilt, you may want to rethink that - Trump has settled **a lot** of cases himself. > It is a VERY hard charge to prove though especially years later. Except these women aren't pressing charges against Trump - the SOL has likely expired in all of them. They're not even filing a civil suit against him. However there's a lower standard of proof in civil court than in criminal court. Criminal trails must be proved "beyond a reasonable doubt", whereas civil cases are proved by "the preponderance of the evidence" (which essentially means that it was more likely than not that something occurred in a certain way).]

[Am I crazy for thinking that the timing makes perfect sense? This tape is released, and then these women hear it and react like "wow, so this wasn't a one-off thing, and he didn't misunderstand the situation, this is just what he does". Seems like a pretty strong motivation to come forward.]
[Many of them (including Summer) said it wasn't the tape alone that motivated them to step forward, it was only after he lied about it at the debate. That was the tipping point.]
[It's not even just the tape, it's that he explicitly denied ever doing this in the second debate (after being asked the question no less than *three* times!). The campaign tried to play the tape off like it was just talk, sounds like his victims aren't ok with that.]

You can't actually BE a witness unless you were there to witness something. Claiming you "heard" the "victim" talk about her "assault" isn't admissible evidence.]
[1) It's evidence that she didn't just make it up recently. 2) In a civil case it would be admissible.]
[LOL. How is it evidence that she didn't make it up recently? It's hearsay. Sure, I can say that five years ago my friend was telling me about how someone sexually harassed her. Who's to say I'm lying? You?]
[Any witness testimony is hearsay. It's not proof, but it definitely is evidence.]
[Well, then, I look forward to this trial and look forward to her sworn testimony that will surely be enough for a jury to convict Trump of sexual harassment. Put it this way, her "expert" testimony would be just as believable as Juanita Broaddrick's "expert" testimony that Hillary Clinton threatened her to keep shut about her husband's rapey nature. So either we believe both or believe neither. Which is it? If Trump's an abuser of women, then Hillary protects a rapist.]
[> a jury to convict Trump of sexual harassment. Well, for starters, juries in civil cases don't convict. They issue a judgement, and that judgement is whether someone has civil liability. Secondly, it wouldn't be for sexual harassment. It would be for sexual assault.]
[> So either we believe both or believe neither false dilemma]
[Then tell me why I shouldn't believe Bill Clinton's accusers while, at the same time, believing Donald Trump's accusers. Neither side has actual evidence. It's all hearsay.]
[Actually Broaddrick has testified twice saying he never raped her under oath. This stuff was really huge in the 80s and 90s. It has been kicked so many times while Bill was in office.]

[>All I did was correct your claim that testimony isn't evidence. You didn't correct it because this wouldn't necessarily be admitted as evidence. >But while we're at it, you wanna give me some sources on your claims?

[>You didn't correct it because this wouldn't necessarily be admitted as evidence You said it was not evidence because it is hearsay. Being hearsay doesn't disqualify it from being evidence, so yes, you were corrected. Sorry if that hurts your ego. >"I just want you to know how much that Bill and I appreciate the things you do for him," Hillary told Broaddrick. Hillary then took hold of her hand and veiled her threat in form of a question: “Do you understand everything you do?" This is weak. You can say what you want about her original story, but the idea that Hillary was intimidating her with code words in this exchange is Alex Jones conspiracy theories. For the record, I did know about this. If this is the only evidence people have of Hillary intimidating victims, she's pretty clean. She is on the record as going after a few other women had affairs with, but none of them were alleged to be non-consensual.]
[I'm so done with people excusing Hillary's actions. Just. Done. She'll be YOUR President for these next four years. Good luck with the consequences.]
[You seriously think that exchange makes Hillary unquestionably the same as Trump? That levels the scales for you?

[Hearsay evidence is allowed in civil cases. The burden of proof is not as stringent as it is in criminal cases.]

[They have the Billy Bush tape.]
[I doubt hearsay evidence is the only evidence they have, but in a he says she says type case it usually comes down to who the jury finds to be more believable. More than likely, as he has done many times before, he'll settle the case before it gets to court with his standard NDA attached.]
["Witness" in the sense of giving testimony regarding personal experience. The woman told her friend about the assault around the time it occurred, which provides additional evidence that it's true/corroborates the woman's account. Doesn't mean it *is* true or that the court will believe it, but she is a witness. Source: I'm a lawyer.]
[>The woman told her friend about the assault around the time it occurred Prove it. >which provides additional evidence that it's true It provides ZERO evidence that it's true. If it were the only evidence you were relying on, you would lose the case.]
[> The woman told her friend about the assault around the time it occurred > Prove it. Evidentiary law doesn't require them to. It just has to have "indicia of reliability." Same as all other out-of-court statements. Like I said, the court might not believe her, and it would then be excluded. But it's still potential evidence. > which provides additional evidence that it's true > It provides ZERO evidence that it's true. If it were the only evidence you were relying on, you would lose the case. Contemporaneous, corroborating testimony is absolutely evidence. And it's *not* the only evidence they're relying on--they also have the victim's testimony and potentially other evidence. Again, not saying they'll necessarily win, but this is potential evidence nonetheless.]
[They're not going to win anything because they're not going to have a trial. It's all bullshit ginned up for this final month of the election. Once Hillary wins in November all these women are going to go back living their comfortable lives.]
[What world are you living in? Dude you are not making sense.]
[Ah yes, hearsay. I heard that Hillary is a lesbian and dates Ellen. Wow!]
[> I heard that Hillary is a lesbian and dates Ellen. Wow! Even if that were true, so what?]
[Less hearsay than Bill's accusations, but Trump didn't seem to mind then.]
[He was Bill's Friend at one point in time.]
[How is that even remotely relevant? We were talking about the multitude of women accusing Trump and how Trump is dismissing them after saying that we should listen to all of Bill Clinton's accusers.]
[Same thing happened in 1992. Were many women came out the woodwork, Bill and Hillary went on TV, said it wasn't true. Same as Trump has done, same as Bill and Hillary both did.]

[You're raving.]
[Raving about the southern accent she chooses to use when she comes home.]
[Hearsay is entirely admissible so long as it is going to credibility, and isn't being used to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Here, all it is trying to prove is that "soandso talked about this happening X years ago." Thus, it is entirely admissible, and is compelling evidence of credibility. You are, of course, *absolutely* right that this isn't useful as to whether Trump did or did not actually do this thing. All it is useful for is whether this woman talked about it having happened.]
[Aye, if only one of these women had came forward at the time. Or just recorded themselves talking about it. Or wrote it down in a diary at the time, just seems so contrived. Got one accuser, still wanting to work for trump after her "groping". I will do like the Clinton supporters did in 92. It's not true.]
[I mean, that's one way to approach it, sure. Generally speaking though, burying one's head in the sand and hoping it goes away isn't a winning strategy (as you mention - it didn't work for Clinton '92 either). You'll be proven wrong, just like they were. (at least with respect to Ms. Flowers and Ms. Lewinsky). You're right though, some of them seem contrived, but some of them seem legit. It's foolish to lump each of the claims together and say "well claim 17 doesn't look true, so they must all be false!" If you really want to figure it out (and Donald always figures it out), you have to look at each one and weigh its veracity.]
[I always make a timestamped and notarized incident report in my diary when *I'm* inappropriately fondled. Just in case, you know?]
[Eh, I get that you want to paint this with the "credibility" or "effect on listener" brush, but legally speaking, you and I both know a judge would exclude her statements because the offering party would really be offering them for the truth of the matter asserted. At least any judge worth his or her salt would exclude them absolutely.]
[You'd most likely be able to get them in as outcry witnesses and thus exempt from the hearsay rule.]
[An actual lawyer stated earlier in this post that it is admissible. Again, it's to add credence that this isn't something that was just made up (the main response most people have) They'd need more evidence besides that but that's what courts do. Let the full spectrum of evidence be presented and see what picture it shows. His constant statements regarding women and the tape released Friday help pain the picture too. There he's actually describing sexual assault (change the terminology to that of a medical doctor to remove the so called "locker room" aspect of it and it's still damning) Edit: this conversation here https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/57u2rl/comment/d8v9h81?st=IUDLYEVK&sh=3acdfa11]
[Depends how the trial is going, really. If we were to (foolishly) consider the ongoing media circus an actual trial, I'd suggest that the defense opened the door to this testimony the moment they accused her of 'making it up out of political expediency.' This goes to directly rebuting that assertion. Outside of that context though, yeah you're probably right. If the accuser's motives/credibility aren't at issue, this doesn't make it in. Even so, it's probably inadmissible on 403/prejudicial grounds, not hearsay grounds.]

[>"It is very common for people who have experienced assault to blame themselves and excuse away what the predator has done," All because a man tried to kiss her. Liberalism is truly a mental disorder. Edit: Vicious unhinged leftists in the thread proving my point.]
[You sound like a creep]
[No one's proving your point. If u wanna see mental disorder, check out TheDonald.]
[She's a republican.]
[>Zervos' cousin, John Barry, that she only publicized her sexual assault allegations against Trump because she "wishes she could still be on reality TV." Reality TV bimbos like this looking to cash in will swallow the [current year] sexual assault hysteria without question if it means 15 more minutes of fame.]
[did you just repeat what Trump said...What a dark soul you have. You must really want the 19th amendment repealed.]
[Uh, no? Also not sure how you seem to think reality TV stars an pageant contestants aren't pathetic bimbos.]
[Spoken like someone who's never been kissed, let alone against their will by some random person they aren't attracted to.]
[Not sure I follow? Do you always get notarized forms filled out before you try to kiss someone? I get that's what the junior anti sex league is screaming for everyone to agree is what actually happens, but uh, that never fucking happens. Ever. If men stopped trying to kiss women humanity would cease to exist.]
[And trivializing sexual assault isn't...]
[How would you feel if someone that you found repulsive came up to you, grabbed your junk, shoved her tongue down your throat, and called you mental for not liking it? Come on.]
[Liberalism: >a political or social philosophy advocating the freedom of the individual, parliamentary systems of government, nonviolent modification of political, social, or economic institutions to assure unrestricted development in all spheres of human endeavor, and governmental guarantees of individual rights and civil liberties. Nope, not a mental disorder. Sounds pretty good to me, actually.]
[As if he's called a predator because he only tried to kiss someone. GTFO with that BS. He *bragged about* sexually assaulting women. (Grabbing someone's genitals uninvited and unwanted is sexual assault in any state, country or sane mind.) After this predatory boasting was revealed, he denied in front of millions of people that he ever actually comitted such assaults. Since that brazen denial, nearly *a dozen* credible accounts of him doing exactly what he boasted about doing have since come to light, simply because of the arrogant audacity of his denials. These victims of sexual assault had been willing to keep their pain private and buried amongst their trusted confidants. Donald J Trump did not allow that to happen. Donald Trump is a sexual predator because he sexually and serially assaulted women *for decades*. Your deflection and minimization says a lot about the kind of person you really are. Makes me wonder how many you have sexually assaulted in your days.]
[> He bragged about sexually assaulting women. (Grabbing someone's genitals uninvited and unwanted is sexual assault in any state, country or sane mind.) People who actually have a sense of humor understood that to be a joke. Vicious screaming crybullies went fucking insane though. >Since that brazen denial, nearly a dozen credible accounts LOL "credible" GTFO. Anything some random bimbo says is gospel to leftists UNLESS they happen to be saying it about bill clinton. Then they're just tramps looking for money and fame. >These victims of sexual assault LOL trying to kiss someone is sexual assault. The junior anto sex league is pretty scary. No wonder millennials never get laid. >willing to keep their pain private Still not getting the "pain" that someone trying to kiss you ONCE would cause? Whats painful about it exactly? I mean rape might be traumatizing, but someone trying to kiss you? Really? Just how weak and fragile are these bimbos?]
[Son, you need help. Seriously. You're disturbed, and probably dangerous. [These women](http://nymag.com/thecut/2016/10/all-the-women-accusing-trump-of-rape-sexual-assault.html) endured far more humiliating and degrading behavior at his hands than just kissing. And no decent person jokes about sexually assaulting someone, nor does any decent person find it amusing when someone else does. It's repugnant. It's vile. It's detestable. It's *deplorable*. Choose whatever adjective you want, but it is never a joke.]
[LOL, every single one of those stories are about him trying to kiss them. Funny how it took all these media hungry bimbos decades to tell their harrowing tales of attempted kissing! >It's repugnant. It's vile. It's detestable. It's deplorable. Choose whatever adjective you want, but it is never a joke. I know. Jokes are absolutely haram to the junior anti sex league.]
[> LOL, every single one of those stories are about him trying to kiss them. ***** * In a New York Times report published October 12, Trump was accused of **fondling the breasts** of Jessica Leeds when she was 38 years old. Leeds, now 74, reportedly met Trump in the first-class cabin of a flight to New York more than 30 years ago, and claims he also **attempted to reach under her skirt** during the flight. She called the incident “an assault.” Trump has vehemently refuted the allegation. ***** * Mindy McGillivray claims Donald Trump **groped** her 13 years ago while she was visiting Mar-a-Lago with her companion, photographer Ken Davidoff. According to the Palm Beach Post, Davidoff brought his friend McGillivray with him to the estate while he covered a concert by Ray Charles. Only 23 at the time, McGillivray allegedly **had her ass grabbed** by Trump while he stood next to his then-fiancée, Melania. ***** * In a Facebook post earlier this year, former Miss Washington USA Cassandra Searles claimed Trump **grabbed her ass** and invited her back to his hotel room, according to Rolling Stone. She called Trump a “misogynist” and accused him of treating women like cattle. Searles wrote that he “lined up [contestants] so he could get a closer look at his property,” a claim that has been corroborated by Paromita Mitra of Mississippi. ***** * Makeup artist Jill Harth filed a lawsuit against Trump in 1997, accusing him of **cornering her and groping her** in his daughter’s bedroom. Harth and Trump allegedly first met in December 1992 during a business presentation — she and her former romantic partner George Houraney wanted him to back their American Dream festival — and Trump is accused of “subjecting her to a steady string of sexual advances,” The Guardian reports. The night after the initial business meeting, Trump and Harth had dinner at the Plaza Hotel’s Oak Room, where he allegedly **groped her under the table**. In January 1993, when Harth and Houraney visited Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s Florida estate, he allegedly pulled her into one of his children’s bedrooms, **pushed her up against the wall, groped her, and tried to get under her dress again**. Harth has accused him of “**attempted rape**,” while Trump has called the allegations “meritless.” ***** * Kristin Anderson, who worked as a model and makeup artist in New York in the early 1990s, told the Washington Post that Donald Trump **groped** her when she found herself sitting next to him on a couch at a Manhattan nightclub. “It wasn’t a sexual come-on. I don’t know why he did it. It was like just to prove that he could do it, and nothing would happen,” she told the Post. “There was zero conversation. We didn’t even really look at each other. It was very random, very nonchalant on his part.” ***** * Summer Zervos, a contestant on the fifth season of The Apprentice, says she was both kissed and **groped** by Trump after her run on the show was over and she was discussing possible employment opportunities with him. She alleges that he had her meet him at his bungalow in the Beverly Hills Hotel, where he kissed her, **groped her, and thrust his genitals at her**. Because she was up for employment within his organization, Zervos says “I wondered if the sexual behavior was some kind of test, or whether or not I had passed.” ***** Your definition of "just trying to kiss" is both dangerous and deranged. You, *son*, are in dire need of professional counseling. I sincerely hope you're already on the list.]
[LOL how will these bimbos go on?!! I'm sure being "groped" like, totally ruined their lives. That is, if it ever happened. Which, kind of funny all these bimbos are trying to cash in now.]
[Despicable.]
[Serious question--what the fuck is wrong with you? Sexual assault shouldn't be a partisan issue.]
[Yes it should. Trying to kiss someone is only sexual assault to fainting couch liberals out for blood.]
[Please go away back to the_donald and ask yourself if you would like a stranger who you are not sexually attracted to and who is stronger than you both physically and socially to step into your personal space and start locking lips and pawing your body. Just betting, but I think you'd feel a bit violated.]
[Yeah, that would be annoying for what, 2 seconds?]
[Looking at your comments and "men have been kissing women for thousands of years" shit, I'm guessing you're a straight man - or you could be bi, since being bi doesn't mean you are attracted to every man out there. Now, let's say that a man who you are not attracted to, a very powerful, wealthy, vindictive man, sees you and maneuvers you into an area where you are alone with him. Maybe in an elevator, maybe in a room after he closes the door behind him. Now let's say this man comes on to you, grabs you, gropes your ass and your genitals, and forcefully starts kissing you and shoving his tongue down your throat. You aren't attracted to this guy. Maybe you only know his name, spoke to him for a few minutes prior (and none of it about sex), or you've been platonic friends for a while. Let's further say that this man has the physical power to hold you down and, if he wishes, rape you, or continue groping you until maybe he ejaculates. Maybe he's trying to get you to have an affair with him. Maybe he's pressuring you verbally as well as physically. Maybe you can't see retaliating against him in any way because he is so powerful and so wealthy, and such a media icon. Maybe he tells you that you wanted what he did to you. Would you still say that that was only annoying for, what, 2 seconds?]
[You are either being willfully obtuse, a troll, or just so incapable of empathy that you can't see why a sexual assault victim would feel like shit and feel fear, anger, guilt, and disgust if they were groped against their will. Why don't you go and actually read accounts of sexual assault from victims and educate yourself. You're definitely not open to being educated here.]
[I wouldn't wish the denial, shame, fear, helplessness, isolation, and anger sexual assault victims experience on anyone, but I wish you could at least understand why sexual assault makes people feel like shit. It should be obvious.]
[So if a muslim immigrant that had just come into the country tried to force a kiss on someone in your family, would you say it's no big deal and not sexual assault?]
[Yes. Men have been trying to kiss women for 250,000 years. You likely wouldn't exist if your father never made a move. The junior anti sex league here thinks otherwise.]
[Yeah and I'm pretty sure during some of those early years they used the ol' club over the head method in order to get a girl. I thought we had evolved beyond that, but apparently the "evolution is a lie" crowd managed to stay strong on that method and avoid any evolution whatsoever.]
[Please explain to me how someone trying to kiss you leads to years of torment and angst.]
[I've never been sexually assaulted, and I hope I never am, so I can't say. I'm not in the business of telling others how they should feel.]
[Sure, but you understand how rational adults process things yes?]
[What would you know about what rational adults think?]
[You'd totally not care if some dude leaned in and tried to force kiss you, huh?]
[If men stopped trying to kiss women the human race would end.]
[That's not how babby is formed.]
[**Force** is the key word here. When you're on a date and try to make a move and you're rebuffed, that's not sexual assault. You lean in and go for a kiss. If she pulls away, she's not interested and you go back. If she's interested, she'll lean in too. Sexual assault is grabbing the person and forcing your lips on them making it hard for them to pull away. Besides that, many of the reports are worse than that. It's not just about kissing.]
[God, you keep digging yourself into a hole. You are coming off extremely rapey. Have you ever had sex with a conscious woman before? Because I get the impression your "moves" include Rohypnol.]
[You'd like it if some dude leaned in and tried to force kiss you, huh?]
[Argued like someone who has committed sexual assault in the past.]
[Wow. This is like an actual witch hunt now. Oh, and yes, I have tried to kiss girls and been rebuffed. The junior anti sex league thinks I should have had a twenty page contract signed first. Madness.]
[Welcome to free speech, where you can say some ridiculous shit and people can call you on it.]
[There's a big difference between "making a move" and "making a move against a woman's will"]
[Not in old bob's world.]
[Don't be ridiculous. Obviously it would matter in that instance 'cause it's a brown person.]
[So if Donald Trump tried to kiss you and/or grope you sexually, you wouldn't mind?]
[Uh, I'd say no, then like with these bimbos he would stop. Not getting the decades of suffering leftists are pretending that would cause me.]
[I don't know why you would call these women bimbos, you don't know them at all. You don't seem like a particularly good human being, and I hope you can learn to be a better person lest someone should pick up from your example. I can't imagine what it would feel like to be part of one of the many groups throughout history that people look back on and wonder how they could have so little humanity.]
[But he didn't stop after being turned down, multiple times. It's been a constant of his camping - he doesn't know how to handle being turned down.]
[That's not what the bimbo alleged. Of course she can say whatever the hell she wants and still get her 15 minutes of fame so she can spend her interview $$$ of makeup and liposuction.]
[Leave it to a Trump supporter to refer to victims of sexual assault as "bimbos" and use the expression "leftists" with so much disdain you might as well be saying nazis. Jesus fucking christ.]
[You sound like you haven't even read the full story. I can't believe people like you will dismiss a sexual assault case but accept another that pushes your party's agenda. It's disgusting. Have fun in November when your candidate gets crushed.]
[The full "story" is just that. Sad washed up bimbo trying to get her 15 minutes of fame. >It's disgusting. Have fun in November when your candidate gets crushed. I actually couldn't care less.]
[Then it seems like you're wasting your time.]
[is that why you have a fuck ton of posts attacking hillary and defending trump? mhm, couldn't care less. mhm. yep.]
[Did way more than just try to kiss her bro. Why do you hate women?]
[Oh? What did he do?]
[Trump himself said he grabs pussy because "what can they do?". His words. And he promises to make abortion decisions illegal. So much control over female bodies .. it' s fucked up. He's going to lose because the women are going to win this election]
[**"But sexual assault is not about sex, as much as it is about power and control."** This is pure speculation and I question the logic and veracity of anyone peddling such definitive statements about human psychology.]
[Welcome to... I dunno, the [bronze age](http://www.inquiriesjournal.com/articles/732/addressing-the-use-of-sexual-violence-as-a-strategic-weapon-of-war)?]
[This has long ago been determined by the psycology community]
[>I question the logic and veracity of anyone peddling such definitive statements about human psychology. Someone like all experts on sexual psychology?]
[I mean a whole lot of research has been done on sexual assault over the years and that is what has been determined. It's not like pure speculation.]
[Seconding this. I work for a sexual assault crisis centre, rape is VERY RARELY about come kind of uncontrolled sexual lust. Saying that it is about lust is giving an excuse to the perpetrator i.e. "s/he couldn't help him/herself."]
[This dried up C. Lol shes Nancy Grace level scummy. All the shills here must worship her.]
