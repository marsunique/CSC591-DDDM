[I always find it funny how trump wouldn't meet the civility guidelines to post here]
[Meanwhile the NCGOP is thanking Clinton for condemning the attack. https://twitter.com/NCGOP/status/787765546909569024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw]
[Remember when that one white guy punched a black guy at a Trump rally in Florida? For weeks the entire media and this subreddit called Trump supporters violent. If its ok to paint Trump supporters as violent for the actions of two or three people then why is it not to ok to paint Hillary supporters as violent for the actions of a few people? Obviously, Im not condemning all Hillary supporters for doing the firebombing. Im saying you guys are hypocrites for doing that very same thing to Trump supporters when a handful of them were violent.]
[I think that was more about how Trump [encouraged that violence](https://mashable.com/2016/03/12/trump-rally-incite-violence.amp). Everyone knows there are wackjobs on all sides, but it is another thing to encourage them.]
[They thanked Donald Trump, too... Jesus, you guys are terrible, trying to make it sound as if only Clinton was thanked. https://twitter.com/NCGOP/status/787787573192171520 >Thank you Mr. @realDonaldTrump. We will not be silenced nor suppressed by this evil act. We will pray for those who seek to harm us.]
[They make it sounds likes she so extraordinarily moral to condemn the attack.]
[Idk why they would be thanking him it was his supporters that did it.]
[Well I am sure as rich as Trump is he can fund their complete re-opening.]
[did they? I didn't hear that, but perhaps it's because I don't have a narrative to follow. Wanna talk about Trump's response to this, stating that hillary supporters did this?]
[And trump is supporting armed rebellion (a little worse than one Molotov) if he loses.]
[The difference between a Republican office being firebombed and a Democratic office being firebombed is that Clinton comdemns the former and Trump would encourage the latter.]
[Yet only one of these actually happened]
[Good on Clinton and good on the NCGOP. I hope the voters affected by this are helped out and I wish the NCGOP luck in rebuilding, we are all Americans and all of our voices matter]
[LOL they like Clinton's more.]
[She was civil and did exactly what she was supposed to, expressed horror at this unjust, violent, and cowardly attack on a democratic opponent and condemned any such actions. This is not how you win office in a civilized democratic nation.]
[If you look at Clinton's backing, most of the people who supported Bush are supporting Clinton now. You're seeing the establishment GOP shift to Clinton, while the base they've created over the effort of taking traditional Southern Dem's with the Southern Strategy turn against them.]
[And there is a "Dems help reopen a NC Repub office" gofundme page edit: Now closed. Raised $13,167 in 5hrs]
[Actually, you're wrong. The goal was reached in 40 minutes.]
[Damn, I wish I saw it :\ I'd love to help out however I can.]
[Aw shucks guys I *just* missed it. What's that? I can *still* donate!? Ah, well, my wallet is in the car. But *aw* shucks guys!]
[I was being serious, guy. If you have a new link, share it.]
[Found the trump supporter]
[I love that this is what it's come to. I make a joke, you get butthurt so you assume something that will make you feel better. Must've been hard to look through the last few posts of mine, which clearly state I do support Trump. You libs and your hurt butts lol.]
[the poor little guy is triggered. you poor thing. you should go hug it out at your little safe space.]
[Lol]
[He just said 'found the trump supporter', which isn't really an insult if you are one... I don't know why you reacted so aggressively to it...]
[Because deep down he knows he's on the wrong side in this particular case]
[^someone ^just ^got ^triggered]
[Not softly either.]
[You beat me to it]
[*I'm gonna trigger softly, I'm gonna trigger gently, I'm gonna trigger sweetly, I'm gonna trigger discretely.*]
[Strumming my pain with his fingers, Singing my life with his words, Trigger me softly with his song, TRIGGER ME SOFTLY, with his song, Telling my whole life with his words, TRIGGER MEEEEE SOFTLYYYYYYY, with his sooooooo^oooooooong]
[And here comes Trump to dump Gasoline on this fire.]
[Remember when that one white guy punched a black guy at a Trump rally in Florida? For weeks the entire media and this subreddit were all talking about is how violent Trump supporters are. Its a double standard. It's a rigged system.]
[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichstag_fire]
[This is a meltdown of epic proportions. I actually have entertained the idea that Trump is still a Democrat who won the GOP in the primaries just so he could throw the election, while also proving how broken the entire establishment system is.]
[Roger Stone said flat out that if Trump can't win the election fair and square his strategy should be to claim it's rigged, deligitimize the results, and spark "civil disobedience". Trump is using this particular incident as a way of claiming that there's some sort of vast conspiracy against him and his supporters, that he's a victim, and that everybody who disagrees with him is part of this conspiracy. The modern republican party does not care about democracy. It does not care about truth. It does not care about anything other than its own political power. The tea party was the first open manifestation of that. Trump is its conclusion. These people are extremists. It's not even just Trump, it's all of them. People like Steve Bannon and Ann Coulter and that set? They want a revolution. They don't want an election. And everything they do is calculated towards trying to create one. It is perhaps cynical to say that these people openly desire violence, but as the public statements of Trump and his supporters recently make clear they absolutely do. They do not desire simple victory but a cleansing. They want to exterminate everybody not like them. What has been birthed in the GOP, historically, only ever leads to violence. When this fascistic tendency takes root in society it does not relent because you ask it nicely. It continues to poke and prod, it attacks, it misleads the public, it sensationalizes its opposition, and it continues to do this until something reaches a breaking point and they can start bashing in skulls in the middle of the street. I no longer believe there is any decency left in that party. Half of them would gladly blow my brains out and the other half would vote for the people pulling the trigger. There is a part of me that is sincerely convinced that if these people ever "win" I am going to have to flee the country. People with my politics don't last long in your typical police state. And let's not mince words, these people *do* want a police state. They fetishize "law and order" for very clear reasons. Namely they're authoritarians who follow a bleak view of humanity that says the only way to lead it is to crush it violently. These people are going to destroy this society.]
[This is perhaps the height of his recklessness so far. He is already de-legitimizing the upcoming election and democratic process. Is he actually trying to get a tit for tat armed response from his 2nd amendment solution supporters over this?]
[Is it weird that because he said this, in my mind I think he's just secretly projecting like always and he started it like a goofy cartoon villain? I mean I know he didnt. That'd be ridiculous. It's probably just some shitty people.]
[Won't be surprised if it was a trump support who burned down their own building to make Hillary look evil.]
[Or just pissed at the Republican party. Trump has taken them on]
[You mean, again?]
[Like a reichstag fire.]
[Jesus. I hadn't thought of that]
[Cannot resist commenting here. Look at what Trump said. He accused people "representing" Clinton, not "Clinton supporters." This is a direct accusation that agents acting for Hilary Clinton and under her control did this. That's the same as accusing Hilary herself. It's a very serious allegation. Asshole.]
[> He accused people "representing" Clinton *You* look at what Trump said. He accused animals of doing it. Not people. Animals representing Clinton. Squirrels, goats, who knows... could have been any of them! ALL of them!]
[To be clear, even if he HAD said "Clinton supporters," that would still be super-irresponsible because we *don't know* that Clinton supporters were behind this. I think all the "false flag" speculation is pointless and stupid, I think we can assume for the time being that that the anti-Trump sentiment is sincere, but anti-Trump doesn't necessarily mean pro-Clinton. It could very well have been supporters of Johnson, Stein, Bernie, the Giant Meteor, or one of the apparently numerous undecideds.]
[You're right. We don't know anything other than that something happened.]
[Eh, I don't think that is what he meant. I think he meant supporters of Hillary, but didn't have good words about it. Edit: To be clear what he said would have been dumb even if he had said supporters.]
[I think so too. A case of people trying to assign deeper meaning to somebody who is truly as shallow as he looks.]
[>To be clear what he said would have been dumb even if he had said supporters. How? If this were to happen to a GOP office, people would likely condemn Trump supporters. If you have an enemy, it's fair to assume that they're going to be the ones actively working against and harming you.]
[Because they don't have a suspect. While a normal citizen can speculate, a presidential candidate should have a bit more tact.]
[He wrote it down. It wasn't some off the cuff answer. If he can't even proofread his tweets then how the fuck does he deserve to be anywhere near the WH?]
[But 140 characters is sooooooo long.]
[At the very least he's trying to link her to the attack, because his natural inclination is to go for the personal dig.]
[I think you're right too, but this is another plain as day example why he shouldn't even tour the White House. How can he not see how dangerous and utterly irresponsible that miscommunication is? How is he not spending more than thirty seconds checking his tweets for meaning? This reads like yet another justification for violent opposition]
[> didn't have good words about it. But I thought he had the best words??]
[Trump can barely string together a sentence so I wouldn't make the mistake of assuming he intentionally worded something thoughtfully.]
[There is that.]
[Actually, he's very crafty in the way he shades his wording so people know exactly what he means without him actually saying it.]
[But... I thought he had the best words...]
[He's not crafty at all and has the vocabulary of a middle schooler.]
[He's vile, he has some kind of talent for deploying that narrow vocabulary of his to imply things without saying them outright, and more broadly, some serious talent for manipulating certain people. He's called for violence many times without directly inciting violence, for example.]
["Grab 'em by the pussy"]
[This is why Trump can never be President. For once in this post-debate mess he's created, he and his campaign are actual victims of a deplorable attack on their party. He could score a lot of points by handling this in a calm and rational way, and maybe rally people to his cause. Instead he comes in throwing firecrackers and calling people animals, accusing them of working for Clinton despite no ID on the perpetrators yet. He is in no way capable of dealing with anything in a Presidential way, and because he is so detached from reality, he is dangerous.]
[>For once in this post-debate mess he's created, he and his campaign are actual victims of a deplorable attack on their party. I don't know what post-debate has to do with it, but Trump supporters have endured a reprehensible violence that has no place in America, for going on a year now. Some Trump rallies have had to be called off due to violent mobs. Riots outside of Trump rallies have been shockingly common. Trump supporters, or just people assumed to be Trump supporters have been verbally and *physically* assaulted with a shocking frequency when entering or leaving Trump rallies, or just walking down the street. I don't see how people can look at what the Left(along with media collusion) have done in the past year and think it is in any way a wise or responsible choice. What do you think is going to happen when these people decide to go after the positions you hold?]
[Here's a quote from Donald Trump: > He was a guy who was swinging, very loud, and he started swinging. And you know what? The audience swung back, and it was very appropriate. He was swinging, he was hitting people, and the audience hit back. That’s what we need a little bit more of You're right though, it's totally definitely 100% the fault of the Left and the media that there is violence at his rallies, it's probably not an issue that the Republican candidate for President of the United States says all the time "I love it when there is violence at my rallies and I wish it happened more often".]
[>He was a guy who was swinging, very loud, and he started swinging. And you know what? The audience swung back, So someone attacked some people, and you're condemning people for defending themselves? >it's totally definitely 100% the fault of the Left and the media that there is violence at his rallies Bingo! The leftists are committing the violence, and the media are giving them false cover by promulgating lies. What do you think about these examples where the assaulted for the most part sought help from the police rather than physically defending themselves? Who's to blame here? https://duckduckgo.com/?q=trump+california+violence&t=ffab&ia=news https://duckduckgo.com/?q=trump+violence+chicago&t=ffab&ia=news]
[No, I think you are trying too hard to find a "gotcha" for my post because you've missed the entire point. For one thing: there is no actual evidence that anybody was "defending themselves". Try to look it up – can you find any? In reality, the guy got attacked for flipping Trump the bird. But that's really tangential to the point. There are plenty of examples of violence from both protestors and participants at Trump rallies: http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/03/02/a_list_of_violent_incidents_at_donald_trump_rallies_and_events.html However, instead of being a responsible politician or even an ethical human being, who speaks out against violence when it's occurring, you have Donald Trump giving speeches where he openly fantasizes about harsher, more violent tactics being used to disrupt protesters, tells his supporters that he'll pay their legal fees if they get physically violent with somebody, etc. If you are angry that there is violence occurring at Trump rallies, *get angry at your fucking candidate for telling people to be violent in his speeches*. I mean, I honestly can't believe this is even a discussion. You have a presidential candidate talking about how much he loves it when there is violence at his rallies, violent stuff happens at his rallies, and everybody is like "well obviously it's not *his* fault, it must be *THE MEDIA*". It's ludicrous and beyond intelligence-insulting.]
[> He could score a lot of points by handling this in a calm and rational way, and maybe rally people to his cause. He *is* scoring points and rallying people to his cause. Just not with you. Finding your enemies is cunning intelligence. Ruthlessly eliminating them is preventing anything from happening again. Waiting for the facts and giving doubt is being meek at best, inept at worst, and is just opening yourself up to more attacks in the future. People buy this.]
[Not people he needs to win over though. Everybody that buys into his shtick is already voting for him.]
[Charging the base is a long time GOP strategy, though. Increasing turnout of your own supporters is a thing that can change elections.]
[It's hard to do that without a ground game though. Charging up the base does nothing compared to door knocking, big data, and vote by mail.]
[Right. I never said it was smart (in this case). But it does something, and that is terrifying. And it's consistent with Trump's ~~strategy~~ approach.]
[Because people who firebomb political offices *aren't* animals?]
[This event is proof that he won't ever change, he can't govern with a steady hand. All he's got are insults, attacks, and cruelty. That's fine on twitter, but in the White House it won't cut it. Trump proved that he can't do the job.]
[And yet his entire Base went bat shit over deplorables. But no, animals is fine]
[Just just Clinton, but North Carolina Democrats too. No time for peace and healing in the State, when you're taking your country back from animals.]
[It's not about him being president anymore. The damage is done. - He has irredeemably soured public service on an entire generation just looking for an excuse to opt out. - He has debased the office of the president just with his wretched proximity to it. - He is actively fomenting rebellion against our own self-government. - He is de-legitimizing the very concept of democracy, a tenuous state that must be held for society to function. He is literally working to destroy civilization just because he is a self-centered, staggeringly ignorant toddler who can not recognize or accept reality. Even if he is creamed in the election, his stink will still permeate.]
[I disagree... I feel like he's very clearly **The Republican Candidate**, not to be confused or conflated with The Democratic Candidate. The damage you listed has certainly been done to his party and its wretched base, but I don't think citizens et al feel he has de-legitimized the concept of democracy or debased the office. It's just like "Well, the Republican candidate is clearly inferior to the Democratic candidate again. What else is new..."]
[I think he knows that unless he wins, everything is over for him. His name and brand are permanently damaged, he possibly is going to end up in jail if he thinks any of these allegations are true, and to him, winning or at least having the plausibility of being labeled as a political martyr to save him from jail after losing are the only things he has left.]
[> His name and brand are permanently damaged Are you kidding me? Amongst Republicans, his name and brand will be permanently *exalted* (and already are). Watch how big his post-election business venture becomes. Racists *love* him. He'll be able to compete with Fox News.]
[nah, he's gonna make big bank. wait 6 months after he lost and people will start finding it funny again, just like they did before they considered him an actual threat. people forget what shit was actually like, especially if nothing really came of it he's just an impulsive person who will always pick the reactionary option of just assuming whatever fits his narrative instead of acknowledging nuance or waiting for information. because that's his nature, that's all there is to it. that's my take on it.]
[I don't know. I'm not sure a lot of people are going to let Trump slide on this. He's really crossed the line and I don't think anyone is going to want to see Trump for a long time.]
[> I don't think anyone is going to want to see Trump for a long time. What about Republicans? They'll fucking line up to see him.]
[we'll see. i certainly will make an effort not to support that fucking asshole in any way, but if he wrote a tell-all book i would probably pirate it to at least skim it humans are so curious that i think trump will be alright.]
[My bet is he skips the country. Maybe Russia is his backup plan?]
[Though it's tempting to focus blame on Trump, keep in mind he didn't get where he is singlehandedly. The GOP has courted and stoked deplorables positions, anti-intellectualism, cowboy diplomacy, news-source siloing, and exploited religion for decades. At least 50 million people are going to vote for Trump - some 40% of voters. Trump is an ass, but his message resonates with people for a reason. The GOP offered more civil, intelligent, articulate, experienced, and qualified candidates in the primaries. The people chose Trump. He is just filling a role they need and want. We need to address the underlying reasons for attraction to this candidate if we don't want more Trumps.]
[Trump's followers are authoritarians, and authoritarianism is an instinctive mode of social organization. Education suppresses authoritarianism. People turn to authoritarianism under economic pressure or when their perceived safety is threatened. On an individual level, there is evidence that when people's choices are constrained they behave more like psychopaths. (In a life or death situation, ethics go out the window.) We would seem to need an education answer (free tuition is affordable and doable), an economic answer (in the form of strengthening the working class, even if that means slower economic growth), and a safety answer (ISIS is getting crushed).]
[I wouldn't be surprised to find it here did it himself now. It's the way this election is going. /S. Mostly.]
[It's not at all likely that Trump actively planned this attack. It's just not his MO. On the other hand, he has been encouraging *active rebellion* if he loses this election, and had largely turned against the GOP. I wouldn't be surprised if a Trump supporter did this as some kind of revenge attack afraid the "corrupt" Republican party. Then again, there's also the matter of the derogatory use of the word "Nazi" in the graffiti. Hardcore Trump supporters are more like Nazis then they are opposed to them, so that probably rules them out - unless that person has a confused definition of that word, which does sound like a Trump supporter. I honestly give about equal odds to the culprit being conservative or liberal.]
[Well, at least he'll have something new to attack Clinton with at the debate on Wednesday. :(]
[*Chuckles softly and quietly and then thinks "man if I wanted to stir up my own base maybe I'd firebomb them"* It's a terrible world where I have to consider that possibility]
[Mostly :p]
[I mean it's deplorable no matter what, and political violence is wrong from either political side. But the first thing I was reminded of with this was definitely the Republican moralizing over the Ashley Todd mugging]
[You know who else started fires and blamed them on opponents?]
[Ummmm, I'll take "Hitler did this" for $1000, Alex.]
[Fuck. I can wrap my mind about a false flag carried out by some nutters but even I would say trump ordering the attack to try and salvage his campaign is a bit too insane.]
[Oddly enough it would not be any less insane then him saying ISIS will take over the US if Hillary becomes President or him saying Obama founded ISIS literally]
[Benito Musolinni?]
[Well I know who *didn't* start the fire- Billy Joel.]
[Unless it was started by a car crash after drinking.]
["A stumbling Billy Joel was seen wandering away from the scene humming *Piano Man*..."]
[Mostly... but he does tend to shout the loudest when he's accusing others of doing things he's done himself.]
[Like drug testing when he is the one sniffling like he did a rail of Coke before the debate.]
[Yeah, not hard to see where he got that idea from.]
[I hate this fucking election. It's rotted my brain. First thing I thought when I read about NC bombing that it was probably a stunt pulled by Trump campaign itself. It's a horrid thought, but so is all the shit they have done so far and I can't get it out of my head.]
[I am there with you. I should probably take a break from the rest of the election and make sure I vote early and just turn off the news for awhile. I haven't been this anxious is years.]
[You are not alone. Hoax entered my thoughts immediately.]
[Sometimes to keep the nation safe you have to burn the Reichstag. ^^^This ^^^is ^^^a ^^^joke, ^^^I ^^^don't ^^^really ^^^think ^^^the ^^^Republicans ^^^are ^^^staging ^^^a ^^^false ^^^flag ^^^attack.]
[But even Hitler didn't come out and immediately accuse the accused perpetrators of being sub-human animals or anything... right? :( >These sub-humans do not understand how the people stand at our side. In their mouse-holes, out of which they now want to come, of course they hear nothing of the cheering of the masses. >— Adolf Hitler speaking about the Marxists during the Reichstag fire to Rudolf Diels]
[Why not? It was the first thought I had when I heard the news.]
[Yeah, I don't think it was Kellyanne Conway or the NC GOP chair or anything like that, but I don't understand why everyone is so afraid to suggest the possibility that some idiot Trump supporter did this in order to try to blame it on Clinton people. I have no idea who's actually responsible, but if it WERE a Trump supporter, this would come in at about #47 on the list of stupid and dishonest and violent things coming out of that campaign. Yes, it's pretty unthinkable, but so were the 46 things on the list ahead of this. All I know for sure is that whoever did this was a truly deplorable human being.]
[A shame that a false flag is well within the realm of possibility at this point.]
[And just like that it's the left pushing conspiracy theories]
["My conspiracy theory is better than your conspiracy theory!" "No, it's not!" "Is too!" "Is not!" "You're a loser-brain!" "Mooom!"]
[I mean, it looks super fun. The right has been drowning in them for weeks now.]
["The right has been drowning in them for ~~weeks~~ years now" Fixed.]
[Far, far more likely that this is some nut job unaffiliated with a party in any official capacity. Either a far-right radical believing he can gain sympathy votes and swing NC, or a far-left radical believing Trump's presidency is dangerous enough to justify violence. Both sides have those unhinged individuals. Hell, every ideology will eventually get radicals if it gets big enough. Hopefully whoever did this gets captured quickly, before they do something worse.]
[I would guess that no hardcore conspiracy nut is going to call it that either.]
[It's just less plausible than Sandy Hook being fake./ s]
[Funny how when it comes to right wing or gun violence, everything is a possible false flag. Sandy Hook, violence at Trump rallies, etc. are all almost certainly wideranging plots to take our guns and make Trump look bad. But when right wingers are the target, there's zero discussion of this possibility and everything's taken at face value. Where's the paranoid speculation now?]
[The thing that bothers me about Trump's reaction to this is the trend of projection through this entire race. Lately, it seems people who cry the loudest about oppression, tyranny and violence as a solution lately are the largest supporters of that line of action, as long as it's in their favor. Extreme gaslighting. It's terrible what happened regardless of who was involved, but you underline the hypocrisy at play of how many of the same folks "just asking questions" (and assaulting grieving families) long after the tragedy at Sandy Hook will be aghast even at a raised eyebrow at this.]
[A more likely possibility, if it was a Republican, would be a wild-eyed Trump supporter doing it because the GOP "betrayed" Trump. That's much more likely than a false flag, IMO.]
[I think all evidence points to it being unhinged trumpers lashing out at Paul Ryans GOP, but they did write get out nazi... and them draw a bunch of swastikas so they very poorly did try to make it look like a false flag.]
[More likely it's just one or a few very disturbed people. Remember last election when that girl carved "B" in her cheek in the mirror? She was just very disturbed. There are many very disturbed people and this election is whipping up a fervor. Whether it was a democrat or a republican who did the deed, we should not take it as a reflection on either party. It's a sick, criminal act officially sanctioned by nobody.]
[I 100% agree that any "false flag" accusations are pure conspiracy theory, but I would say it's possible that the attack was done by Trump supporters as a response to "establishment republicans"/"neoconservatives"/"cuckservatives"/etc. denouncing Trump.]
[>I 100% agree that any "false flag" accusations are pure conspiracy theory, but I would say it's possible that the attack was done by Trump supporters as a response to "establishment republicans"/"neoconservatives"/"cuckservatives"/etc. denouncing Trump. If it weren't for the graffiti, I'd agree that it was a possibility, but his fanatics aren't going to go around calling other republicans nazis.]
[Fair enough. I fully acknowledge that it is vastly more likely that the people who did this were on the left. However, given Donald and his supporters' rhetoric that their opponents "are the real racists", I wouldn't put it past a Trump supporter to call anti-Trump republicans Nazis.]
[The loonies wrote get out nazis and then drew a bunch of swastikas, how obvious does it have to be before you believe this was unhinged trumpers lashing out at the establishment GOP.]
[Yeah. But the "republicans" also aren't staging attacks to incite a religious war like I'm kansas. This isn't the dems or republicans. It's a fringe element that has no grasp on reality. Whether or not it is a false flag is irrelevant.]
[The republicans are a fringe element with no grasp on reality]
[Yes, there are extremists on both ends. But, the message coming down from the top is not the same on both sides. When you go on TV and tell people elections are rigged, the media is a conspiracy, and your political opponent should be jailed, you are more culpable than someone who has never done those things.]
[I live in Orange County. This place (is) was a Bernie stronghold. The only thing I've seen is a few Trump signs beaten up and replaced with homemade "love trumps hate" signs. Hillsborough is one of those towns stuck in the middle of rural piedmont NC and new hipster NC. I could see the culprits being either a bunch of dumb rednecks or a bunch of dumb 30somethings who think they own a town they've lived in for 5 years. Either way it's fucking stupid.]
[The worst is that he's declaring this as a fact to his supporters, this is dangerous]
[declaring what exactly as fact?]
[In the [tweet](https://mobile.twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/787782613633208320?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) he specifically blames Clinton supporters and the democrats for doing this when the culprits are not yet known]
[lol ok...]
[It's not like this doesn't happen every single time in these situations. The group who believes they were attacked immediately blames it on whatever group it is they currently have disagreements with. The group being blamed immediately declares that it couldn't possibly have been them. I find it absurd to expect anything else. *Jesus Christ, I can't even state a thing that undeniably happens without being downvoted in this sub. Look at any recent church burnings or acts of vandalism during the election, etc., etc. Fucking look at yourselves. You're absolutely no better than Trump supporters with your complete absence of rational, objective thought. Edit 2: This is a response I gave to another user. It sums up my thoughts on this matter. It needs to be said because you guys are getting ridiculous. This sub is toxic. You've ruined it for the rest of us. >My entire point is that this was absolutely, 100% predictable. Everyone immediately knew Trump was going to do this. Why? Well because people always do this. Every time. Trump was absolutely going to be one of these people. >People (including you) are saying "well he's a presidential nominee, he's supposed to handle it differently..." No shit. Since when has Trump acted like a presidental nominee? Did you really expect him to start now? And I said exactly nowhere that this isn't dangerous. You made that up entirely. Of course it's dangerous. >You're 'exhibit A' for what this sub has become (well maybe B because you actually responded): you see a statement that you've interpreted as 'not anti-Trump' (in this case), or one that genuinely isn't anti-trump (maybe pointing out why a particular argument or criticism is flawed). This immediately means that user is pro-Trump and must be downvoted to oblivion. NO DISSENTING OPINIONS!!!! RAWRRRR!!!! >I hate Trump unconditionally. Always have. My initial comment was intended as "let's not act surprised." You misinterpreted it and launched into your rabid, downvote-happy fervor. Use your fucking heads for two seconds. How are you not ashamed of yourselves?]
[Look, his rank and file supporters may make knee-jerk reactions like that, but the guy running for president is supposed to be calm and rational, keeping things steady. Instead he is aggravating the situation. That's absolutely a dangerous thing to do.]
[My entire point is that this was absolutely, 100% predictable. Everyone immediately knew Trump was going to do this. Why? Well because people always do this. Every time. Trump was absolutely going to be one of these people. People (including you) are saying "well he's a presidential nominee, he's supposed to handle it differently..." No shit. Since when has Trump acted like a presidental nominee? Did you really expect him to start now? And I said exactly nowhere that this isn't dangerous. You made that up entirely. Of course it's dangerous. You're 'exhibit A' for what this sub has become (well maybe B because you actually responded): you see a statement that you've interpreted as 'not anti-Trump' (in this case), or one that genuinely isn't anti-trump (maybe pointing out why a particular argument or criticism is flawed). This immediately means that user is pro-Trump and must be downvoted to oblivion. NO DISSENTING OPINIONS!!!! RAWRRRR!!!! I hate Trump unconditionally. Always have. My initial comment was intended as "let's not act surprised." You misinterpreted it and launched into your rabid, downvote-happy fervor. Use your fucking heads for two seconds. How are you not ashamed of yourselves?]
[Look back. You never mentioned Trump in your post, you mentioned "groups" in general. Yes, some groups will have a knee jerk reaction, but that shouldn't be the case for organizations with a lot of responsibility. If you want to talk about only Trump, then fine, I am absolutely unsurprised that he did this. That still doesn't make it right. There is no excuse for a potential President of the United States to do things like this. I absolutely believe that.]
[Except Trump is not a part of this "group", he's a fucking presidential candidate, and has decided blame to further his political agenda. He's an idiot, and so are the people who bombed this office.]
[Okay this has never happened before. Trump's reaction is entirely unexpected.]
[It seems you're trying to justify his stupid response, that's why you're being downvoted.]
[Which shows how ridiculous things have become here. As I put in another response, my statement was intended as (and very obviously reads as) "don't act surprised." 30+ downvotes for that. You guys have turned into zombies. You ate all the Trump supporters (like seriously. They all but disappeared a month or two ago) and now you've resorted to eating your own. I'm not necessarily talking about you but that describes 90% of the people here.]
[Relax. Bottom line is that Trump is lying to the public and inciting violence.]
[It's easy to say that when you haven't amassed like 50 (combined) downvotes for absolutely no reason. It's pretty damn aggravating. I know Trump is inciting violence. That's why my initial comment pointed out that I wasn't at all surprised Trump immediately resorted to inciting violence. None of us should be surpised. The other day I got over 100 downvotes for saying Rudy Giuliani didn't literally forget that 9/11 happened. My clearly defined point was it's not a believable argument. My proposal was to use any of the dozens of other arguments one has available to discredit him.]
[He'll keep blaming Clinton even if it comes out that a Trump supporting KKK member did it, left the message because it's a phrase/symbol combo intended to trigger the GOP base into acts of retaliation.]
[Yeah, this should be a thing we're all together on.]
[His tweet has more traction with 2k more retweets and 1k more likes despite coming an hour after Hillary's tweet. Lots of insane people listening to this idiot. At this point he should be considered a terrorist himself.]
[I'm pretty convinced that there's a concerted effort (and maybe a whole lot of bot accounts) that automatically like and retweet everything he tweets.]
[Look at the vote to comment ratio of stuff in the Donald compared to basically any other subreddit. Pretty suspicious to see something with 1300 up votes and 2 comments.]
[Maybe it's a subreddit CSS thing? I know some subreddits can display it in different ways, like how SRS dispalys all of their posts' karma as negative numbers.]
[Trump's reaction on Twitter compared to Hillary's reaction go this event, shows how unhinged from reality him and his supporters are.]
[I mean, their party affiliation already showed that didn't it? Even before Trump they thought women came from the first man's rib]
[It's absolutely irresponsible. The rhetoric this year has been insane, but fanning this flame could actually get someone hurt or killed in response.]
[I'm calling better than even odds at this point that some crazy person is going to kill people because of this election. This is horrifying. Just when I think it can't get any worse.]
[We already have the "no more baby parts" guy. Plenty of unhinged people out there. Glad I vote by mail.]
[I have never been so glad to live in a small farm house, on a hill, in the middle of goddamn nowhere, with an isolated cellar.]
[They already all believe she ordered it.]
[If they really believe that, will they have the courage to call it radical Methodist terrorism? Or are they going to get all PC and try to leave her religion out of it? I mean, I'll give 'em a pass on the crazy, but I do expect consistency!]
[Why would the person winning the election do this? It's the stupidest fucking theory I've heard of this election.]
[Do they not realize that this act is the worst thing she could do? Everything we know about her says that she is calculated and strategic. Who's narrative does this serve to advance? I'm not saying that Trump ordered it either. I'm saying that it would make no sense for her, when every other indication is that she's letting Trump do all the damage to himself, to go out and give him something like this to prop up as proof of his victimhood.]
[They are delusional. The fact that you are trying to explain why they Hillary Clinton didn't order the firebombing of a GOP building only plays into their madness. It just absurd.]
[These people believe she wanted to drone strike Assange.]
[Where would we even have a drone strike him? It's not like we can just attack people anywhere we want in the world. I mean, among all of the other reasons it's a ridiculous idea.]
[They have no consistent narrative for her. She's the war hawk that can't beat ISIS. She's so incompetent, she can rig an election.]
[She's obviously duplicitous.]
[I don't think that word quite applies here.]
[As a turn of words only. Her ability to be incompetent and successful @ the same time. Duplicitous seems to always have a bad connotation. Doing two things at once could be handy.]
[I'm talking about her own narrative though. Ordering this kind of action goes against both her narrative that she's been developing for years, and the narrative that they believe she's trying to push while hiding sinister ambitions. If she did have sinister ambitions, this is the worst time to tip her hand.]
[As far as Trump's base cares that's all irrelevant, as in it doesn't even cross their minds. To them, everything Clinton has done, does, and will do is bad in some way. Doesn't matter if there are contradictions in that logic, they just show confirmation bias to some real degree or they don't even realize they're there. No amount of explanation or insight will help you or pretty much anyone else here be able to "get" the way they're thinking.]
[I don't know; I think that she being calculated and strategic is a meme that got out of hand. Don't conspiracy theorists like to believe that about the Jews, the illuminati, etc... She's perhaps careful and cautious but aren't all politicians? Politicians have to project competence. So when talking about them it's always a safe bet to err on the side that they are basically incompetent.]
[I think that this also comes across in a lot of the Podesta emails. I'm not saying that she is necessarily more strategic than most politicians, but clearly much more so than Trump. God, what I wouldn't give to see his campaign emails.]
[also she is winning so why bother]
[They think they're winning. Trump's tweet: > Animals representing Hillary Clinton and Dems in North Carolina just firebombed our office in Orange County because we are winning @NCGOP]
[I like how the north carolina democratic party thanked her for her well wishes]
[> The worst is that he's declaring this as a fact to his supporters, this is dangerous I know it has become almost a trope to laugh about how many disqualifying things he has said but if you step back for a moment and consider the gravity of these statements coming from a presidential candidate it's genuinely galling. This should be enough to end any campaign.]
[It's amazing how quickly they latch onto his word. Not a one can think critically it seems.]
[[how interesting](http://imgur.com/QRk91Vs)]
[Tag me SRS too!]
[I agree with them. Am I a shill too?]
[What am i looking for?]
[Pretty strong selection error in that sample. They didn't get to be Trump supporters by *thinking*.]
[Remember Ashley Todd? The McCain-Palin campaign came to regret promoting her bizarre "attackers carved a B for Barack on my face" story so much. The Trump-Pence campaign would be wise to be careful about assuming anything about the identity of the firebombing perpetrators. It is safe and correct to say that the firebombing was horrifyingly despicable and the perpetrators should be brought to justice. However, assuming anything specific about the identities and motivations of the perpetrators, without evidence, is a mistake.]
[The words "Nazi Republicans, leave town or else" were painted on a nearby building. I'm on board with not jumping to conclusions, but that's kind of difficult to misunderstand.]
[Let's be clear about this: I'm a computer scientist. I'm not an arson investigator, criminal profiler, or any other sort of law enforcement officer. The only skill I bring to this situation is a good grasp of Bayesian analysis, so if real experts show up, you should listen to them instead of me. Consideration of motive, especially of uncomplicated motive, tends to point toward Democrats. Consideration of means tends to point toward populations who have used firebombing in the past, which frankly to me suggests white supremacists rather than Democrats. Consideration of motivation tends to point to supporters of the campaign that uses violent rhetoric, although violent opposition to violent rhetoric is also plausible. That no one was physically hurt leans very slightly toward a Bayesian inference in favor of an inside job.]
[I kinda agree. Also, where are the updates? There is no information on suspects.]
[> Trump-Pence campaign > careful lol]
[That's a name I hadn't heard in 8 years. What an idiot]
[>The Trump-Pence campaign would be wise to be careful about assuming anything about the identity of the firebombing perpetrators. I disagree. They have very little to lose. If they go all-in on this, and then the perpetrators turn out to be Sean Hannity and Billy Bush, it won't change the outcome of the election. If it turns out to be someone who once tweeted something nice about Clinton, Trump can tell us all that he was right, and then his chances of winning might go up to 18%.]
[Trump and his supporters will just blame the Rigged Media for making it seem like the perpetrator was a Trump supporter.]
[> Ashley Todd She was actually mentally ill, though, IIRC.]
[Isn't she the one they exposed as a liar because the B was a mirror image?]
[Yep. You think she would've just gone with an O.]
[I forgot about that crazy horrible woman!!]
[Will the party affiliation of these criminals tell us anything about either candidate?]
[Good question. I'm afraid it will confirm whatever attitudes people had to begin with, unless there was some active involvement of either party.]
[Fundamentally, no. But the candidates' reactions do tell us something.]
[Yeah. Let's look at who tries to exploit it the most, and consider who is the obvious beneficiary.]
[The Dems!!! They did it, and started a goFundMe page to repair the damages and then take the credit.]
[It's been a pretty regular occurrence for Trump's accusations to boomerang back at him. The foundation stuff comes to mind. He should be careful.]
[You got it the other way around. It is just heavy handed speedboating. he knew his foundation was crooked, and at the center of an investigation, so as a smokescreen he attacked clinton for the very same thing. also improper sexual behaviour, also stamina etc. etc.]
[Bill Clinton's accusations. It blew out in his face.]
[> He should be careful. lol, not really his strongest personality trait]
[tomorrow trump has to gives his stuff to nyag. David is gonna write about it.]
[He can file for an extension, David tweeted earlier. :/]
[That will get people suspicious if he does that. And the foundation will get back into the media..]
[Sure, but similarly he also hasn't released his tax returns, so by obfuscating the issue, his supporters can live in denial.]
[Its not good for undecided voters.]
[If they are still undecided at this point, they aren't paying attention.]
[That's probably true. I just have a hard time imagining a person who has any interest in actually voting who hasn't made up their mind already, based on the available data. But I could certainly be wrong about that]
[Any minute now, he's gonna pivot to appeal to more undecideds.]
[He's been trashing the GOP something fierce lately, so it really could be anyone.]
[At what point do you detach Trump from the GOP. They are all too scared to stand up to him.]
[Its like an Agatha Christie mystery.]
[I just can't figure why anyone in a little liberal enclave would lash out so violently. Like were they running actual clan meetings out of the office or what?]
[It's possible the liberal enclave is a bit of an echo chamber a la Trump rallies. Those are the types of closed environments that can spawn intense hatred and violence. My thing is if it was liberals who committed this act, why address the GOP in their messages when the real enemy is Trump? Seems strange. Then again, there are plenty of leftist extremist groups like PETA, BLM, and SJWs who could just be trying to lash out at right wingers. That GOP office didn't have to be a nazi headquarters for it to be a target of leftist extremists. It could be a false flag operation, and it could be just some loon with a mental disease. Whoever is responsible for this act, however, has to be caught and punished.]
[Hate to break it to you, but PETA and BLM are not "leftist extremist groups"]
[Did you just describe Black Lives Matter and *"SJWs"* as leftist extremist groups? The fuck? SJWs isn't even a group, it's a label, and a pejorative one at that.]
[> Like were they running actual clan meetings out of the office or what? Possibly. The klan tend to network through republican party channels in the south.]
[This is a false flag all the way. They're trying to frame HRC supporters.]
[I want to believe that because I don't want anyone on "my side" throwing bombs but there is literally no way to know anything right now.]
[I'll bet anything on it. You remember all the "BLM was here" vandal attacks. Shit was so obvious it was by anti-BLM people. The writing on that wall gives it away in this case.]
[What about the writing gives it away in this case?]
[Liberals don't usually talk like grade schoolers on some "Nasi Republican leave town or else". Rednecks do, tho. And adding the swastika was just trying too hard, something redneck Trumpies would do, not liberals. It's so obvious it was an inside job or Trumpies on their own volition, or aided by Trump2016 themselves.]
[I could see it being some sort of drunk crust punk type, really. Throwing a molotov and calling republicans Nazis is on page 10 of the anarchist handbook I believe. Right in between "consensus decision making" and "veganism: yay or nay?"]
[Right? With the polls trending decisively against Trump, I can't see what Hillary supporter would think this a good idea (unless they're not right in the head). I could see how a false flag situation makes some sense, though.]
[It does seem strange, but at the same time I wouldn't be surprised if it turned out to be some extremist did it as an unreasonable reaction to the recent revelations/accusations about him. I also wouldn't be surprised if it was a false-flag to make Hillary/Hillary supporters look more extreme and make Trump the victim. At the same time, I wouldn't be surprised if someone was pissed about the falling support for Trump in the GOP and lashed out against their local GOP office. This election is such a mess that a number of possibilities don't seem out of the question.]
[>(unless they're not right in the head). I think it's probably safe to say that anyone who would firebomb a building, regardless of their politics, isn't right I'm the head.]
[False flag seems unlikely. If it was someone on the right, it would more likely be a Trump supporter who thought that the party betrayed Trump. I mean, we can't rule anything out, but if I was going to assign probabilities, I'd put that as much more likely than false flag.]
[Or just a shitty anarchist. Plenty of those around to ruin a perfectly good protest.]
[That's my first reaction too - why would the left do this when it looks like we're going to win? Then again, firebombing a political party's office - no matter whose side you're on - doesn't exactly show a strong grasp on rational and clear thought. So who knows at this point. It's stupid to try and guess because there are clear motives on both sides.]
[The facts aren't out yet, but once again Trump decides to tell his supporters his theory and they take it as fact. Also, low energy dog whistle there Trump.]
[The facts aren't out yet on who's sending death threats to Arizona Republic and yet here you all are suggesting Trump supporters did it. https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/57tb10/dealing_with_death_threats_after_a_clinton/]
[I haven't suggested that, but generalize to your heart's content.]
[Can you imagine generals and his joint chiefs after some attack but without confirmation of who? Trump during the Cuban Missile Crisis would have been World War 3]
[Facts are for the other party]
[Trump is going to work up his supporters and then they are going to do some real harm to real people, man I really dislike Trump.]
[The crack team of investigators that he had sent to Hawaii are now heading to North Carolina.]
[Trump doesn't need facts, neither do his followers. They have their feelings.]
[Notice trump has no response to the Kansas plot]
[which one is that?]
[The one where 3 avid Trump supporters were planning to blow up a somalian-american apartment complex with car bombs and open fire on anyone else because they are musim immigrants.]
[http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/kansas-men-charged-car-bomb-plot-targeting-somali-immigrants-article-1.2831319]
[thanks]
[And Clinton said sorry to the people... Can people see the difference now?]
[Was it her party that happened?]
[That sentence makes no sense.]
[That's because Clinton's people were responsible for it. If it was Trump supporters fire bombing a Clinton campaign office she would be blaming Trump. She should stop demonizing those of the other party as Nazis. Her supporters are listening to that and when your opponent is a Nazi you are morally justified in using violence to stop them.]
[Just to illustrate the difference in tone and temperament between the candidates: http://imgur.com/a/rRdwv]
[It's not as if she wrote that tweet though, so it can't be used to compare their temperaments. Edit: Can someone explain how this is not a fair point instead of just downvoting? Thanks.]
[well of the top of my head and this is a shot in the dark..its probably because whomever wrote the tweet.either clinton or trump or their people...its representative of them. its their official account right so its to express their views. so, clinton comes across as a calm and rational person showing empathy and leadership while trump comes across as a baboon flinging shit on the wall to see what sticks.]
[yeah, i might not like Trump but lets keep it fair and not spread clearly biased bullshit like you do: https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/787783828358258688]
[...3 hours later...]
[Lol that doesn't make the first one okay]
[I never said that, I just pointed out that /u/MD2JD conveniently left out the normal condoslences tweet]
[That should've been his first tweet. His immediate response was not to express concern about the safety of the people there, it was to make accusations and false claims.]
[>we are winning This guy has an RDF to rival Steve Jobs']
[He actually thinks that he is winning NC? All polls listed on 538 say otherwise]
[And we had actual Trump supporters who tried blow up somalian immigrants. Hillary Clinton didn't attach that to trump]
[Why can't I upvote this more?!?]
[Assuming you took both screenshots at the same time, it's appalling Trump has more "likes" — even if "like" doesn't mean like (apparently some people use them as bookmarks).]
[No. Hillary's is a reasonable response, that's boring. Trump's is the one that's going to get the attention, because it's a fucking ridiculous statement from a presidential candidate. Just look at this thread, we're talking about Trump's response, not Hillary's. If Trump never made his comment, Hillary's would have gotten hardly any attention at all. If Hillary didn't post hers, Trump's would still be a big story. It doesn't mean anything other than Trump's outrageous comments are more interesting to talk.]
[I did take both screenshots at the same time, a couple of minutes before I posted. It currently stands at 4,400 retweets and 10,000 likes for Hillary, 10,000 retweets and 19,000 likes for Trump.]
[I'm a Clinton supporter. A pretty big one (if someone asked if you are registered to vote, or knocked on your door asking who you are voting for, it might have been me!) But I can probably count the number of times I've retweet or liked a Clinton tweet. It's not that I don't like them! It's just not central to how I show my support.]
[I guess it's a good thing we know from Twitter's own business growth problems that Twitter users aren't representative of everyone.]
[This is just embarrassing.]
[One of them got a thank you tweet, hint it's the one that helped NYC rebuild after 9/11]
[Giuliani? /s]
[His tweet came an hour later and has 2k more retweets, and 1k more likes. That's a bit unsettling.]
[Well, the obvious outcome of a horrible act like this would be to energize Trump's base. They will now be very dedicated, fired up, extra mad, etc. That's why I don't think it's out of line to guess that supporters of EITHER candidate could have been behind it. Trump would benefit 100 times more than Clinton. In standard investigating, you look at means, motive and opportunity.]
[Bots are easy to write]
[Trash vs. Class, rinse and repeat. He doesn't even know the facts yet!]
[Give me a break, it was obviously Hillary supporters. Who else would do it? Grow up and accept reality.]
[In fairness, the building was tagged 'Republican Nazis fuck off' or something to that effect. The facts as we know them are reasonably simple.]
[And she didn't even call it deplorable.]
[Trashy Trump, Classy Clinton?]
[Can you imagine what he'd do after a major terrorist attack if he was president?]
[You don't have to imagine. It happened to the last president from Trump's party. That Republican freaked out and invaded the wrong country, leading to hundreds of thousands of deaths.]
[We had to use Nukes, America. We had to do it and let me tell you why. They are animals.]
[Blame the dems, launch nukes at the middle east indiscriminately?]
[Attack Iraq? Alternate answer: try to figure out which country ISIS is on a map so we can turn it into a glass parking lot.]
[Yeah, I guess.]
[You're forgetting Bannon is gonna be the adviser whispering in his ear. So it's attack Israel.]
[Steve Bannon, [pictured here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/17/Grima_and_Th%C3%A9oden.jpg) advising donald trump.]
[Declare war on "the Muslims", probably.]
[Regardless of whether the terrorists in question were Muslims or not.]
[(pointing to the aide carrying the nuclear satchel) "Open this"]
[I just don't get the "because we are winning"... Is he actually that delusional?]
[He definitely isn't winning Orange county NC. That's UNC Chapel hill territory right next to Durham. That's pretty much the bluest area in North Carolina]
[The irony of the orange faced candidate losing orange county]
[Is he even winning in that other Orange County?]
["Orange is the new fuck face", Bill Maher.]
[No. He knows he's lost. But he needs to convince his followers he's winning so when he loses they believe it's rigged and no one is speaking up...no one except TBNN - Trump Breitbart News Network]
[I think he actually is that delusional. check the tweets when he looses. he called the emmys rigged because he lost.]
[Cracked did an article about running for president before. You're surrounded by yes men and people who put positive spin. A lot of nominees who lose even in landslides don't realize how bad it is until it's announced.]
[His performance this election year has been so incredible that the Emmys should create a new category for him.]
[Well next Olympics are going to have a Mental Gymnastics event, so there's that!]
[At this point the most insulting thing about Trump to me is how is he wasting the time of all of these poor people with genuine anxieties about their futures voting for him when he makes strategic decisions like this.]
[Clinton's response was over an hour before Trump tweeted that. Weird that he lacked the common sense to check what she said first. Instead he just went with vicious and gloating.]
[Why do you think reading that would have changed his response?]
["I think she sounded like a good person in her tweet. Here, let me shit on that..."]
[Trump never checks for landmines before walking into the minefield.]
[Weird?!]
[Maybe he saw it and thought he had to do the opposite of everything she does.]
[King to King, u aight]
[Funny; he loves agreeing with her, judging from the debates.]
[Have you had no previous experience with Trump's demeanour?]
[> demeanour Perhaps "temperament" fits better, here.]
[He has the best demeanor. No one has bigger demeanor than him.]
[Still holding out for the presidential pivot]
[It will happen On November 7th. According to Archimedes' Law of Levers, the closer the pivot point is to the object you are trying to move, the more torque you can apply to it.]
[That pivot is gonna be so hard it will tear a hole in the fabric of reality itself.]
[This guy is going to get someone killed]
[[removed]]
[They can't help themselves! They're fighting LITERAL HITLER!]
[he's killed thousands of children already.]
[Hillary already has gotten people killed, so...]
[the people bombing other people's property is going to get someone killed!]
[Quite possibly. They should both take a long hard think about their actions. Morons the lot.]
[I think firebombing buildings has a higher likelihood of killing someone than writing bad things about Hillary on Twitter. But what do I know?]
[If Trump caused civil war and death among Americans, someone is going to plane crash at his Trump Tower and hoping he was there.]
[Hillary has already beaten him]
[I 100% believe if/when he loses, there will be at least one riot.]
[How many if he wins?]
[Fact: more leftists have killed people than trump supporters in politically motivated incidents this year.]
[Some sort of "second amendment" solution?]
[As long as it doesn't cause violence directed towards him personally, he isn't going to stop.]
[And even if it does, he won't stop. He'll just attribute it to the global conspiracy against him. Thank god he's old.]
[He's honestly been trying to incite future riots in the event of his loss since the 2nd debate.]
[I prefer to attribute it to Hanlon's Razor.]
[Way before that. Remember his second amendment people comments?]
[He's a narcissist. Even if he loses he wants people to continue making a fuss over him and to think he was the rightful winner.]
[Yes, that seems to be his goal.]
[“I think we’ll win before getting to the convention. But I can tell you if we didn’t, if we’re 20 votes short or if we’re 100 short and we’re at 1,100 and somebody else is at 500 or 400…I don’t think you can say that we don’t get it automatically. I think you’d have riots.” - Trump Edit: “I think you would see problems like you’ve never seen before. I think bad things would happen. I really do. I wouldn’t lead it, but I think bad things would happen,”]
[That's the same bullshit language he uses when he's trying to lie about something and pretend it's some shit he heard, too. "Smart people are saying – not me, but smart people…"]
[Did Hillary blame the Kansas terrorists on Trump?]
[Did the Kansas terrorists attack the DNC? You're drawing a false parallel.]
[its not any less politically charged.]
[Why would any rational mature adult say something like that?]
[Why would she, she actually has class and knows that it would it would her look bad with her bases flinging our accusations without proof. Trump base on the other hand love bullshit.]
[In addition it would go against her theme of going low versus going high. The only time she would bring this up is if Trump directly says her supporters are more rabid.]
[Nope.]
[Of course not.]
[I can't help thinking if this was a Dem office building getting firebombed, Trump would be tweet-raging about how it was a false flag operation by the Dems to discredit his base.]
[[My supporters are very passionate](http://now8news.com/donald-trumps-reaction-to-the-beating-of-homeless-latino-man-my-supporters-are-passionate/).]
[I think he'd give a fake consolation and then encourage it. Something like: "The democrats got firebombed, now I think that's bad. It's a bad thing. But it's not surprising, folks. I'm not surprised. This conspiracy has people mad, and they deserve to be mad. People are really mad and they are mad because we are losing our country!"]
[The election is rigged!]
[Fucking riggers.]
[Absolutely their first response would be calling it a false flag attack.]
[Hasn't Trump been attacking the GOP establishment? Are we absolutely sure this wasn't a Trump supporter?]
[We are sure, because Trump's base doesn't seem to think Nazi is an insult.]
[good point.]
[not at all.]
[Hillary decries the attack. Donald calls the bombers *subhuman*.]
[The attackers are not Americans that's for sure. They may have been before this, but no longer. Also as terrible as his comments are, this may be an issue that should not be politicized]
[> The attackers are not Americans that's for sure. They may have been before this, but no longer. I disagree. Americans can do horrible things, and we, as Americans, should recognize that. Their actions do not revoke their citizenship, nor their rights as citizens. While Trump may wish that [certain people shouldn't be afforded basic rights](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/09/trump-wishes-terror-suspect-wasnt-given-medical-care.html), he's wrong. I realize that you're not saying that the attackers in this case shouldn't get attorneys, but I think it's dangerous--almost as dangerous as calling them animals--to suggest that they're somehow "not American." Citizenship is simply not something that can be revoked by such actions, and we would all benefit if we don't engage in "who's a *real* American" rhetoric.]
[You bring up a very valid point. However I should clarify, I consider them cultural exiles. They are still legally American and deserve the same due process of law. However as far a polite society goes…]
[I'll agree there. Throwing firebombs is definitely below the standard to which we should hold Americans.]
[the word you two are looking for is "people", not "americans" it doesn't matter where they were born. they're pieces of shit, but they are still people.]
[Well, I was not thinking [Reichstag fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichstag_fire) until now. EDIT to add link]
[Trump = Literally Hitler because he hurt people's feelings]
[Trump = figuratively Mussolini because he's an authoritarian nationalist strongman who wants power even if democracy rejects him. He's openly proposed violating the first amendment, the separation of powers, NATO article five, and the Geneva conventions, and not in any small way. He is easily the worst candidate in the history of American elections, and you want to pretend this is about fee-hee-heelings. Get bent.]
[Lol is that why he threatens to sue anyone who says mean things about him? Huge pussy.]
[He hasn't just hurt people's feelings. He's openly racist, assaults women, and has said that he wants to carpet bomb the Middle East *and* use nuclear weapons. He's *dangerous*. He says that immigrants are taking over the country and stealing high-paying jobs, which Hitler accused the Jewish people of doing. [He asks his supporters at his rallies to raise their hands](http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/03/05/trump_supporters_raise_right_hands_to_pledge_support_to_donald_trump.html) in support of him, just like Hitler did. He has a "strike first" policy, just like Hitler. He supports his supporters beating up protesters, just like Hitler. [Reuters reported](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-trump-purge-exclusive-idUSKCN10003A) that the first thing he wants to do is to purge the government of everyone who worked under Obama, and make it easier for him to fire public workers, which is the first thing Hitler did when he came to power. Now Trump has something to put even more fear of democracy into the heads of his supporters. It could be believed that all of this is just coincidence, and that what went on in Germany in the 1930s was worse and a quite different situation - which is true, because the US isn't bankrupt and desperate like Germany was at the time. However, one has to admit that these few points are - at the very least - eerily similar.]
[It's pretty hilarious you say that when he's the one trying to black out and sue anyone who hurts *his* feelings.]
[You really think that's the reason we dislike him? Jesus you are delusional]
[Let's wait and see if CNN can find us some leaked mails that point to Trump being to blame.]
[I didn't want to say anything like that because i'd sound like a conspiracy nut but if you look at the graffiti, the R, P, and B are very rune-looking. That struck me as very weird as neo nazi groups tend to sometimes graffiti germanic runes as well as swastikas very similar to the ones in the article pictures. Now this could have been done on purpose by the people who firebombed the place or it could have been some random neo nazi dumbfuck trying to start some sort of Riechstag fire event. We really wont know until this event is properly investigated but who knows.]
[Though it would be a good way to distract everyone I don't think this the case. My prediction is Trump brings this up at the debate and latches onto throughout. They're basically in damage control so this would really cement Republicans into them.]
[Yep, this is about where the media needs to just stop covering what he says entirely.]
[I disagree. I think they should cover what he said here. But specifically say what we are all saying. Spell it out to stupid people why this kind of talk is dangerous. Because if you don't, they will hear about this from another source who will make this even worse.]
[>Trump wants honest media coverage? Really? Okay, here goes: the man is a fraud, a bigot, an idiot, dangerously sowing sedition. Happy now? https://mobile.twitter.com/NeilSteinberg/status/787774179542052864]
[I've been thinking about this a lot over the past week. Why do reporters at any reputable news source even bother talking to his surrogates at this point? It goes the same way every time: > Q: "Do you support what Donald Trump said?" > A: "Hillary is ISIS, her husband is a rapist, and we need to make America great again. You should turn off your mic." > Q: "That's not what I asked... I asked if you support what Trump said? > A: "Why are we bringing up what just happened when the Clintons have been killing people for 85 years and Obama is a Muslim?" I mean, I understand that all campaigns try to make their candidate look good and have a habit of changing the subject when something controversial comes up in conversation, but it's to the point now that anyone who tries to argue on Trump's behalf seems to be on a different planet. That's ignoring Trump himself, who is **doing nothing at this point but stoking the flames and calling for riots.** The media has a hand in this by covering Trump 24/7, and they need to put their fucking foot down RIGHT NOW before it gets worse. We need to call for a total and complete shutdown on Trump coverage.]
[The idea of censorship like that should really make you consider how far the left has fallen, how rotten and hollow their morals are. That's what I get from the wiki leaks. The idea of censorship should disgust any sane person, and yet here you are proving why everyone will have lost no matter who is elected.]
[Censorship? You think that Democrats want to censor people, and that Republicans don't? May I remind you that Republicans are the ones who hold book burning parties, including those who burn the Qu'ran. Also, there's this beauty of a speech by Trump on [censoring the internet](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/donald-trump-wants-to-ban-the-internet-will-ask-bill-gates-to-close-it-up-a6764396.html): >"We're losing a lot of people because of the internet ... We have to see Bill Gates and a lot of different people that really understand what's happening. We have to talk to them about, maybe in certain areas, closing that internet up in some ways. Somebody will say, 'Oh freedom of speech, freedom of speech.' These are foolish people." He has also said that he wants to [open up libel laws](http://money.cnn.com/2016/02/26/media/donald-trump-libel-laws/) so that he can sue when newspapers report things he doesn't like, and effectively censor them. >"We're going to open up those libel laws so when The New York Times writes a hit piece, which is a total disgrace, or when the Washington Post, which is there for other reasons, writes a hit piece, we can sue them and win money instead of having no chance of winning because they're totally protected," he said. "We're going to open up libel laws and we're going to have people sue you like you've never got sued before." So, who is *really* for censorship?]
[> anyone who tries to argue on Trump's behalf seems to be on a different planet. A planet where the shit that's contained in Wikileaks is far more damning than "Trump said pussy"? Sign me up for the next shuttle. The choices this election aren't "Trump or empty white house", they're "Trump or Clinton". EVERY fact about either candidate should be viewed in that light.]
[It's not that he said pussy it's that he openly admitted to committing sexual assault. This is what the issue is here and you don't even recognize it. Did I really just have to explain that to you? If you think I'm a Hilary fan you are deluding yourself.]
[Wouldn't that just help him? Stop shining the light on him for just a second, he'll claim media conspiracy even more, alt right news site will report it, and the last tethers between his cult of personality and the rest of the body politic are severed. I can't see that turning out well.]
[It really doesn't matter what the media does, short, maybe, of declaring Trump Dear Leader. There will always be a media conspiracy in his eyes and his hard-line followers' eyes.]
[Whoever did this was either an idiot or did it to deliberately provoke this kind of reaction. Either way, fuck them.]
[My gut says it was a Trump supporter trying to get the narrative off Trump. Also, interesting to note that Trump made no comment about the Kansas plot to blow up a building full of immigrants by white nationalists.]
[Oh come on... there is no proof one way or the other as to who did it, or why. I have this radical idea, we wait on the police to do their job before we start making political hay over this.]
[Do not use The Donald as your role model.]
[He's not fond of jurisprudence. Seems to prefer kangaroo courts.]
[Fuck him. Fuck him fuck him fuck him. This dumbass thinks this is a fucking game. That this is all a fun game where he can try and up all the other players and be the cool guy walking out of this. This can make some of his dense fucking supporters think it's justifiable for them to go out and do the same to democratic offices or potentially attack minorities and liberals, or even Republican officials. This orange fuck, with piss yellow hair, as pathetic and sad as he is, may actually get people killed.]
[Don't get all fired up over this.]
[Watch out guys we got a bad ass over here!]
[I'm not afraid of that orange idiot. I believe in democracy, and we will continue to make progress. It won't be easy, and you are right, but we cannot give in to fear.]
[While you may find Donald Trump to be a substandard human, please do not insult his supporters with generalizations. Even if you believe someone is poorly informed or believes something counter to your morality, they are people who would still like to be treated with dignity. They deserve that until they personally demonstrate otherwise. We have to believe that life is a game where we are all on the same team whether everyone else knows it or not.]
[I apologize, I usually like to denote that I'm talking about the particularly deplorable (For lack of a better word) supporters, such as KKK members, racists, bigots, etc. I'm aware there's plenty of Trump voters who are voting for him simply because the other option is Clinton and not because they like him.]
[Thank you for your measured response. I'd like to encourage all people to temper their statements about people they don't know.]
[He's surrounded himself with the worst of the worst. Alex Jones, Roger Stone, Roger Ailes, Steve Bannon all whispering in his ear.]
[Plus the Republican Party]
[You know who else blamed people for a fire with no evidence?]
[That little fucker Nero did it before the Nazis.]
[Billy Bush?]
[Who? serious question I don't know what you are referring, but the subsequent comment seem to be talking about hitler so I can say its probably him.]
[The Reichstag was set on fire by the Nazis as a false flag to gain power.]
[Reichstag Fire]
[The Nazi's also did destroy buildings of political rivals. The problem is that Hitler analogies work both ways... You can say it was a false flag attack like the Nazi's use to do (without evidence) and others can say it was just politically motivated attack like the Nazi's use to do (without evidence). Either way it's dumb.]
[Someone whose name rhymes with Bradolf Pittler?]
[Woah wait a minute Brad Pitt was supposed to be playing Hitler? Man I guess I really did not understand *Inglorious Basterds*]
[Gandolph the Nibbler?]
[Billy Joel? But he didn't really accuse, he just claimed innocence.]
[I mean, that shit has always been burning. It is known.]
[Thankfully while not lighting it, they did try and fight it.]
[Someone needs to make a version of that song with Trump scandals.]
[A deplorable response to a deplorable action.]
[How can republicans not denounce this lunatic? Just running for president he is doing enourmous damage and risking inciting violence. Whatever your political leanings this man is dangerous and needs to be universally condemed.]
[And i ask the same thing about dems.]
[Because he represents them, the policies they want enacted, the culture they want to promote, and the prejudices they're annoyed they have to hide. Denounce him? They *nominated* him. They fucking love the guy. Watch how much of the Republican vote he gets on Nov 8th.]
[My aunt's reason, as she stated last night: "I'm voting for life!" I'm as pro-life as the next Catholic, but I'm not willing to sell our country to a violent, narcissistic misogynist. Before we can make our country accept life in the womb, we have to take care of the life that's here (e.g. build hospitals and medical centers in rural areas, feed the poor, help those who can't afford things needed to live, provide homes for the homeless, etc.), and change hearts before we can change minds. Also, Trump is actively against life. He wants to keep Planned Parenthood open (not that all of what they do is bad, but most pro-lifers are against even their non-abortion operations), place pro-choicers on the Supreme Court (including his sister, who knows *nothing* about the law or jurisprudence), kill everyone in the Middle East, kill green energy, use nuclear weapons, etc. You can't take care of the next generation without having *complete* respect for life, and taking care of the earth. Otherwise, what legacy are we leaving for the next generation? My aunt just doesn't see it.]
[OK, seriously, this man cannot be president! VOTE!!!!!!!!!!]
[Nah Hillary has this in the bag I'll stay home. It won't even be close]
[The best troll is my favorite troll. I love you.]
[I got comment karma to burn papi I gotchu]
[It's important this POS and his supporters get the message that most Americans do not support this bullshit]
[Don't stay home.]

[Yeah, that's why i voted early]
[Mail it in.]

[Lol wow ya I'm so rekt. My political cynicism has reached a point where I just hate anyone who thinks any major politician isn't a piece of shit.]
[You're not even American...maybe worry more about your own political system.]
[Funny how an American can say that when their own country has meddled in the politics of pretty much every other country on Earth. People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.]
[Maybe but I don't get so invested in other countries politics that I "hate" anyone who disagrees with me, a foreigner, about their own countries' politics. Like, you realize how ridiculous that sounds?]
[As a Canadian and immediate neighbor to the north of the US of A, I definitely have a strong opinion about American politics. Trump is a fucking clown without his nose on.]
[did Hillary blame trump supporters for the terrorist attempt from a few days ago? no. then calm the fuck down donald. How can the country trust you with nuclear weapons with this shit.]
[Any reason he didn't condemn his supporters and their planned mosque bombings?]
[Hillary could just as easily went after Trump for his supporters plotting a terrorist attack, but she didn't. Why? Because she's a decent person.]
[This reminds me of that chick who carved a backwards B into her cheek and said she was attacked by an Obama fan The evidence here is almost too perfect. Next they're going to find a surveillance video of a person wearing a big Hillary tee shirt and hat as if that's what Hillary fans wear when they go firebomb things]
[> [Ashley] Todd had worked as a field representative for the College Republican National Committee since August 2008 and had come to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in mid-October to recruit college students. > On October 22, 2008, Todd claimed that she was robbed at knifepoint by a "six-foot-four African American of medium build, dressed in dark clothes wearing shiny shoes" at a Citizens Bank ATM in the Bloomfield neighborhood of Pittsburgh. > She also alleged that after the robber saw a McCain bumper sticker on Todd's car, he assaulted her, cut a reversed letter B into her cheek, and told her "you are going to be a Barack supporter." Not the first time, either: > According to an October 25, 2008 article in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, in February 2008, Todd had claimed that her car's tires had been slashed and campaign material had been stolen from her car because of her support for Republican politician Ron Paul, an opponent of McCain for the Republican presidential nomination. > Group leader Dustan Costine told the Post-Gazette that Todd was asked to leave the local Ron Paul grassroots group a month later, after she posed as a Mike Huckabee supporter and called the local Republican committee seeking information about its campaign strategies. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashley_Todd_mugging_hoax Sounds like she had a mental health problem.]
[Fireproof pantsuit?]
[Jumping to conclusions like a monkey again...]
[Hey, most monkeys would wait for some evidence before making up their minds.]
[The only one not waiting for evidence is Trump.]
[I'm seeing a ton of people in this thread saying it's a false flag operation without any evidence.]
[Reichstag fire.....]
[You're as bad as him, speculating without evidence.]
[No. a nameless redditor whom you do not know is not equivalent to a man who has mobilized a massive contingent of millions of racist fascists. Get fucking real, kid.]
[There is no need to be hostile or dismissive. Please conduct yourself with the civility that is required for productive political discourse, even if you believe it to be lacking in those you address.]
[I'm not running for President.]
[Thank God]
[Is that really a valid excuse? How about we wait for an investigation to take place?]
[Sure, nobody (except Trump) is saying for sure who did it. It could have been a Clinton supporter, or it could have come from the people who would benefit from it (Trump). We have to wait and see.]
[it'll be a rigged investigation.]
[Obviously the people running the investigation are working for Hillary. We only have the best evidence of arson, our evidence is bigger than any investigation. Remember that if this investigation points to anyone but Hillary it's clearly wrong and you should take to the streets violently to refuse to accept the result.]
[It is a pretty good excuse. He isn't running for President or doing anything of consequence. He can't possibly be worse the man actually running for president who says his opponent ordered the firebombing of a building.]
[I didnt say he was worse. I said its also a dumb thing to say until there has been an investigation.]
[While that's fair, above redditor simply suggested a supposed parallel to a famous fire in history. Donald Trump literally asserted that people representing Hillary are to blame.]
[That would be swell if Trump hadn't already declared that this was HRCs fault. Any comment on that since his response is more important?]
[Damn.]
[I was thinking the very same thing as I scrolled upon your comment. Glad I'm not the only one who made the con connection.]
[I hate that he assumes this was done by Democrats loyal to Hillary. How does he know this wasn't one of his own followers? Or an Independent voter? What a jackass.]
[It could have also been people from the black bloc, they pretty much hate everyone, and they start more dumbasses riots than any other group.]
[Except independents aren't known for their radical politics.]
[The extreme left hates Hillary also, FYI.]
[Independents are sometimes extremely radical. Don't confuse being independent with being moderate.]
[One of the most anti Hillary people I know also fervently hates Trump. I think she's voting Stein or perhaps not at all. She used To be an anarchist and hates both major parties. Plenty of people like that in this election]
[Hard to know. There are dumbasses in every camp. Personally, my money is on a hardcore young democrat who doesn't know that hitting the essentially powerless Orange County Rs (Orange is overwhelmingly D, went like 85% to Obama in 2008) is not exactly taking on the man.]
[Well, they wrote "Nazi Republicans get out of town or else" on a nearby building, so unless it was a false flag, it probably wasn't one of his supporters.]
[You know you can be against Trump without being for Hillary right? I would imagine some radical group like Anarchists would do this before a standard Democrat would.]
[I didn't say it was a democrat, I said it probably wasn't one of Trump's supporters.]
[Trump and his supporters hate the GOP.]
[Trump has been criticising the GOP for rigging the election against him, so it's not too far-fetched to think it could have been one of his supporters. No way to know for sure though.]
[No, using Nazi as a pejorative isn't something a Trump supporter would do.]
[Probably true - and those serious enough to try arson aren't generally capable of speaking in any voice besides their own.]
[Check it for spelling errors?]
["Romanes eunt domus?" Romans, they go the house?!]
[At this point I don't think Trump supporters identify as Republicans. They are in a cult of personality that's reached bunker status and are convinced the two parties and the media are rigging the election.]
[Didn't one trump supporter just get arrested for planning to bomb a mosque? Does he represent you, Donald?]
[People in North Carolina have reasons to oppose the Republicans that have nothing to do with the presidential election.]
[What a fucking asshole. Can't he, just for once, act presidential, for like ten seconds?]
[The same guy that built a few blocks from the White House a hotel with his name in giant letters, no it will never happen.]
[He can actually, remember during his visits to mexico? He behaved like a good boy, lol.]
[He's playing Alec Baldwin playing him.]
[No. Next question.]
[What did he have to say about the people who planned to bomb an apartment building full of families, for maximum effect?]
[It's good to know that, after any tragedy, Donald Trump will make an incredibly tasteless statement about it. At least he's consistent about that.]
[That's pretty low of him.]
[What's insane is that Trump is somehow using even less tact than his Reddit supporters who share the same opinion. That's just...deplorable.]
[Didn't some trump supporters just try to massacre Somali immigrants?]
[False Flag Attack. Feminists did it. LGBTQ did it. Unions did it. Did I miss any obvious suspects?]
[Black Panthers, Black Lives Matter.]
[you missed the ones that like to draw swastikas on things.]
[Deplorable people..?]
[This man is fundamentally unfit to be a dog catcher, let alone president.]
[He's got a great dog whistle though.]
[How diplomatic of him...]
[People will be killed because of Trump.]
[I would like to point out that if the perpetrators are from the far left (which seems likely), these groups are often not fans of the Democrats or Hillary Clinton, who they consider a 'neoconservative' or a 'moderate republican'.]
[Yeah, if they are from the far left, the most surprising thing will be that they targeted Republicans instead of Democrats.]
[No kidding. They would consider Clinton to be a capitalist lap-dog.]
[It's just words. /s]
[Locker room accusations.]
[He never said that. *smirk, head shake*]
[*sniff*]
[Yup, I can't wait till they find who did this. Something tells me Trump will have his own version of the investigation]
[Like a cornered rat Trump has lost his mind, and is flailing desperately.]
[It must be all the times Clinton has incited violence at her rallies.]
[CSI: Trump Tower]
[Each hour-long episode would consist of the cast taking turns explaining to Trump why each piece of evidence isn't connected to Hillary and why he can't just throw her in jail. It's sure to be a ratings hit, no doubt.]
[Lasts for only one episode.. certain to have a Melania cameo.]
[I've seen it all over facebook and twitter already, it's insane how quickly people jump to conclusions. I hope we get some facts soon, before anyone actually gets hurt.]
[The odds of this being an inside job just went up.]
[Does anyone remember that British guy (from breitbart I think?) that did an AMA on the_donald just a few weeks ago and was basically dog whistling these kind of false flag attacks?]
[Milo?]
[No it was an older guy. Maybe he was from infowars? I don't remember and I just tried to find it on the _donald but I don't see it. He was saying something along the lines that Hillary was going to start false flags attacks and blame them on trump supporters so trump supporters might as well do what they need to do. He was clearly planting a seed.]
[Yeah. He was [bragging about it on Twitter today] (https://twitter.com/account/suspended).]
[your link is a link to the suspended account page]
[We don't yet know who did this. It could have been a Trump supporter angry at the Republican party for not supporting him enough? It could have been a Jill Stein or Gary Johnson supporter? Could have been someone who wanted to pretend that they are a victim?]
[People think it's Donald Trump that's the problem, but he's only the symptom. The true problem is that people do not know how to sit still and communicate. And when you see Trump walking around sniffling and bouncing from subject to subject in a reactionary blaze - he's the perfect embodiment of state of the entire world. Donald Trump is to Election. Humans are to Earth. Make sense?]
[More gasoline >ALL SAFE IN ORANGE COUNTY, NORTH CAROLINA. **With you all the way, will never forget**. Now we have to win. Proud of you all! If that isn't a call for revenge I don't know what is. And when did Nazi haters start adding a swastika to make their point? Like "Fuck Nazi's!" and let me add this swastika just in case you were confused.]
[You're gonna have to spell out the call for revenge in there for me.]
["will never forget"? This is exactly the kind of nonsense we *should* forget... We don't want idiots to get the impression they can capture national attention from cowardly acts like this.]
[These days apparently "have a nice day" means you want to murder someone.]
[Your comment is inflammatory conjecture and is no better than Trump's tweet.]
[>Your comment is inflammatory conjecture and is no better than Trump's tweet. Neither of them have the temperament to be president.]
[Yeah, anti-fascists tend to be aggressively in your face (i.e. they would have raided the place while there were people there) and allergic to fascist symbols.]
[I guess you don't know what a call for revenge is then]
[> And when did Nazi haters start adding a swastika to make their point? Reminds me of that scene in Leaves of Grass.]
[>And when did Nazi haters start adding a swastika to make their point? Holy shit. The "Trump supporters did it themselves" theory might have some traction.]
[False flag. Trump campaign did it to themselves. It's a Reichstag fire. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichstag_fire]
[I'm just going to assume that's true and vote for Clinton just in case.]
[you are being just as reactionary as trump i also don't think trump would or could organize an attack like that. like yeah he's pretty crazy, but straight up terrorism? really?]
[Why would they do it before trump is elected though? Hitler was already sworn in when the fire happened.]
[A better conspiracy theory equivalent is the [1999 Moscow bombings](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2012/11/22/finally-we-know-about-moscow-bombings/) that got Putin elected. Trump is also an admirer of Putin! *I don't actually think Trump was behind this*]
[Lets not jump to conspiracy theories, the idea that at least one person can be crazy enough to do this is a pretty simple one.]
[> Reichstag fire Not enough evidence yet. Interestingly in response Hitler tweeted(or maybe spoke) "These sub-humans do not understand how the people stand at our side. In their mouse-holes, out of which they now want to come, of course they hear nothing of the cheering of the masses."]
[Trump calls them animals, Hitler calls them sub-humans, let's call this one a wash]
[I'm just waiting for him to call them "deplorables".]
[you know i hate to say it but i woudnt be surprised if it was some of Trumps own supporters doing it to make it LOOK like it was the Clinton Camp........sad. the way both sides are acting in this election is sad and childish.]
[Everyone has been talking about Trump assuming it was a bunch of Democrats who did it. You should realize that Trump hasn't stated a coherent fact since the primaries, why would he do it now?]
[Pot calls the kettle black.]
[Trump taking the high road as usual. Could have been the bigger guy but nope has to be a pos]
[It wouldn't surprise me in the least if Trump's supporters did it because Trump has been telling them in every speech he makes just how bad Republicans are and how much the party is betraying them and selling them out.]
[In normal years, we could assume that it was almost certainly either Democrats or eco-terrorist types (people forget they exist, but they were one of the most successful terrorist groups in the US during the 2000s). This year, thanks to Trump's attacks on the GOP, we have to add "Trump supporters" to the list.]
[Well, then he has to own the three white guys who were going to truck bomb the Somali communities in Kansas. If we're playing that game, he has to play by his own rules.]
[She is actually on better terms with the GOP than he is.]
[If it's not okay to call violent representatives of Trump "deplorable", why is it okay for him to call violent Hillary supporters "animals"? I mean, yes, what happened is *horrible*, but he's being a hypocrite (*again*), having said that it was bad to call his violent supporters deplorable.]
[Well, there is also no evidence that they support hillary....]
[If "Nazi Republicans" was spelled correctly and the swastika was drawn correctly as well then it probably was not a false flag.]
[Trump is the last person I'd ever want to lead in a time of crisis or tragedy.]
[Nope, no racist dog-whistles in this race, why do you ask?]
[I just wish we could step back from the circus that 2016 is and just acknowledge what a violent rape of decorum this is from the Republican nominee.]
[Am I the only one who suspects Trump had something to do with the firebombing?]
[You're not the only one.]
[Insurance scam to make money back from his failed election.]
[If you mean your supporters did this to rig the election, then yes the animals are behind it. Deplorable!]
[And Hitler blamed communists for burning the Reichstag.]
[It's terrible when Hillary calls half of his supporters deplorable. It's great when he calls all of her supporters animals. Life in trump World.]
[Trump is the animal. Fucking unevolved primate. I have no doubt the altright did this firebombing, just like their BLM vandalizing. We're not stupid.]
[As a lesser evolved individual, I resent being compared to trump. He makes the shit that crawled out of the primordial ooze look like Harvard material by comparison. Comparing trump to an inanimate object like a rock is insulting to rocks.]
[Ask yourself which political party: * Members routinely harass, provoke, assault and violently eject peaceful protesters and journalists? * Struts around threatening to exercise their “Second Amendment solutions” if elections / policies don’t go their way? * Stalks and attacks Muslims and other minorities? * Took over federal lands not once but twice and physically threatened federal authorities? * Plotted just this week to kill innocent Somali immigrants in a mass-murder bombing? * Has attracted Neo-Nazis and KKK, who proclaim allegiance to fascist Trump - including on-duty cops? * Given their history and ideologies (throw in abusive, cavalier, male elitist attitudes towards rape and pussy-grabbing), are massively more likely to commit wholesale violence and domestic terrorism? This was not the work of a left winger]
[The violence is coming from leftists, BLM rioters, and jihadists. You can quibble all day about "more likely to" or "are associated with people I think are bad" but those are the groups that are actually committing violent acts.]
[What about the three right-wing domestic terrorists who were arrested like, the other day...? Or the Sandy Hook shooter, a white men?]
[perhaps in the news you consume]
[There is an extreme left as well FYI. That's how communism gained power.]
[The American far left has been very weak and disorganized since the late '70s or so. The few leftist organizations that have survived almost all endorse "radical nonviolence" or similar philosophies. As a result, modern American liberals tend to think of the left as essentially harmless. It's possible that that might be changing in response to the rise of the alt-right. I'm kind of torn here. On the one hand, blowing up empty buildings is exactly the type of violence I'd expect to see from a resurgent extreme left. On the other hand, I have trouble imagining them actually going after Republicans. And drawing swastikas? That would be really weird.]
[~~Wut?~~ EDIT: thank you for reformatting.]
[Obviously only right-wingers can commit violent acts. /s]
[Dallas? People are capable of horrific things. I'd be more inclined to believe it was an anarchist type. A Hillary supporter makes no sense.]
[As much as I don't agree politically with the GOP, accusing them of doing this is no better that what Trump tweeted. We don't know anything yet, and there are clear motives on all sides. Say what you want about the GOP (and I'll probably agree with most of it), but you don't see Ryan, McCain or any of them saying this or agreeing with Trump. We don't gain anything by lowering ourselves to Trumps level.]
[Don't do that]
[It's this kind of unfounded speculation that Trump's being criticized for here. Don't do it, it's not acceptable.]
[No way this isn't a NC-GOP engineered stunt. No way.]
[Animals can't vote for president. Clearly he is devaluing this under represented class of Americans.]
[So Trump supporters are now attacking GOP offices because they withdrew his funding? Fuck Trump and the filthy regressive right.]
[Something something Reichstag.]
[With so many celebrities and politicians, there's a defining moment or two in their careers. You can say to your friends, "Hey, remember when that crazy shit about so and so came out in the news?" They know exactly what you're talking about and you go on to share a laugh. With Trump that's just so not even a whole question any more.]
[Hillsborough's Mayor - most recent statement 9:30pm EST https://www.hillsboroughnc.gov/news-releases/2016/10/16/10040/police-continuing-to-investigate-crime-at-republican-party-headquarters-receiving-help/]
[It was "Joe The Plumber". Remember him? He seems so quaint now.]
[He knows he's far behind in the election. With nothing to lose, and all his sociopathic tendencies and stress, I'm worried he'll foment something serious out of this. Call me paranoid, but I'm a little nervous about going to the polls on Election Day now.]
[He is an angry bully who is lashing out at everyone around him. He wants to keep his worshippers to himself so, knowing that he lost the election, he is trying to tear them away from the Republican party. If he's going to suck them dry he needs them all to blindly follow him without outside influence]
[Rushing to jusgement before the facts are in.. just the qualities we need in a President!]
[Who could have guess that Trump would be the one to kill the republican party?]
[Hate to be that guy, but the Sanders campaign also did this during the primaries when an office was shot up. Without any evidence, they accused the HRC campaign.]
[Seriously? Just lost some respect there.]
[No.]
[Oy-vey.....]
[Did Sanders personally accuse the HRC Campaign?]
[No, but Im pretty sure Weaver and Jane did]
[I'd be interested to see any sources you have. I don't think this was the case.]
[And that's also a stupid thing to say and do. Just because others do it doesn't make it right.]
[No they did not. Sanders camp purposefully withheld the information that his office was shot at and ransacked. No one knew about it until months later when Sanders was addressing the " violent chair incident."]
[Which is even creepier]
[I'm not a fan of the word "representing." While these were likely folks on the left, there's no reason to think Clinton sent them.]
[Animals, eh? Would you say they're...deplorable?]
[When Democrats burn down buildings they make it a communal activity. Republicans prefer to burn down abortion clinics and black churches. Needs more info.]
[upevote this.]
[Juust like how everyone on this sub and elsewhere was blaming the KY apartment bombers and saying they represented Trump! MEMBER?]
[We need Bernie Sanders to step into the race. We are entering the dangerous phase of right wing populism.]
[How much do you know about Orange County? It was a Bernie stronghold. Logic and odds dictate that it was very likely leftwing extremist Bernie supporters. We've had quite enough of them already, thank you very much.]
[Anybody think the people who firebombed the GOP offices do not support Hillary?]
[Me.]
[Wouldnt be the first time clinton supporters do terrorism]
[CNN also says to not read Wikileaks and to only listen to the MSM. https://youtu.be/-beYBLrkNAg]
[Naw. This was a false flag operation. Trump operatives firebombing their own office so they can blame it on dems. Everyone here on this thread is claiming it wasn't Hillary. Must'of been Trump.]
[> Naw. This was a false flag operation. Trump operatives firebombing their own office so they can blame it on dems. You make an excellent point. It could very well have been a bunch of extremist Nazi Trump supporters trying to recreate their very own Reichstag Fire.]
[Pretty sure.]
[Or it could have been an independent person or group who have extreme political views one way or the other and neither Clinton nor Trump are involved at all.]
[Maybe it didn't happen.]
[Anti Trump democrats burn down a GOP building is the real story.]
[There were pro Trump Republicans arrested just last week for terrorism. It's both sides being assholes. Only one candidate is promoting violence though and that's Trump.]
[Well, one is proven fact and the other is pure guess work and assumptions....]
[Anti Trump democrats donate to the GOP for repairs is the real story.]
[Who else do you think did it? A bunch of liberal nutjobs who can't stand that someone has a difference of opinion. There are hundreds of youtube videos and vines of people stealing Trump yard signs, this was the obvious next step in our "one-up" culture.]
[> Who else do you think did it? A bunch of liberal nutjobs who can't stand that someone has a difference of opinion. Or, a bunch of extremist Nazi Trump supporters trying to recreate their very own Reichstag Fire, maybe? -_-]
[Hillary needs to suspend her campaign and concede the race. She is personally responsible for this terrorist act.]
[sure. interestingly, her opponent is a traitor to the united states. treasonous trump needs to suspend as well. who's going to step up? bernie vs cruz?]
[You have to add /s or everyone here will mistake that crazy bullshit for your actual opinion (it's a pain in the ass isn't it?)]
[I'm only saying exactly what you would be saying if the shoe were on the other foot. Just three days ago Hillary's thuggish supporters viciously beat a protester at one of her rallies: http://www.westernjournalism.com/clinton-protestor-tackled-to-the-ground-during-las-vegas-rally/ Her irresponsible rhetoric, labeling people who support her opponent as "deplorables" who are "irredeemable", has created an unprecedented climate of violence that has culminated in this terrorist act. For the sake of the good of this nation she must end her campaign effective immediately.]
[I can't even.]
[Lol the projection from trump supporters is hilariously pathetic]
[I'm ashamed to live in the same state as a terrorist sympathizer like you.]
[Lol get fucked and leave the country troll]
[Because he said animals we're gonna call him racist right? Because black people get called animals by racists? Is that where we're going with this? That's just a guess.]
[I didn't even initially take it as animals = blacks, but you are probably right.]
[I'm gonna said that he is dehumanizing his enemy and casting all supporters of Clinton as being the same as these bombers, a move that could likely result in a violent reaction.]
[No. We're going to call him a fucking moron for jumping to conclusions before any investigation has taken place. He's saying that it was Clinton supporters without any evidence, and some people will think that it is true.]
[Please compare his statement compared to Clintons, and tell me which one sounds more appropriate. Clinton condemned it, Trump went straight to blaming without any evidence.]
["Trump went straight to blaming without any evidence." Like how we declared cyberwar with Russia?]
[[Evidence!](http://www.securityweek.com/more-evidence-links-russia-dnc-attack)]
[Do...? Do you really think there is no evidence for Russian hacking?]
[No, I'm 100% sure Russia was hacking. Every developed country relies on it for intelligence. What I question is the that they are rigging our election to hurt our trust in the election system and that's the pretence for this "cyberwar". I have seen 0 evidence other than CNN article claiming that we're sure it's Russia orchestrating the attacks lol. Would love if someone could show me I'm wrong It's also suspicious that they give a declaration of war story to NBC as an exclusive like this is entertainment and not a serious threat that could be a precursor to WWIII... and they seem awfully confident that they are going to "find" whatever they are looking for... the US doesn't make bold public claims with the chance we're going to come back empty handed.]
[Like this one ? http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/10/us-government-russia-behind-hacking-campaign-to-disrupt-us-elections/]
[No, that's exactly what I'm talking about though. People saying "we're confident Russia is behind the attacks" isn't evidence. It's not even news!]
[If you don't believe your own intelligence agencies, well good night.]
[Everyone related to Washington is all in on this Clinton scheme. Trump's gonna fire the entire government and replace them with people who are better. Duh. I'm sure there's a massive talent pool out there with all the knowledge they need to hit the ground running who's just waiting to make public sector money and get fired for not being a yes-man stooge like Trump wants.]
[I think, as it was said above, pouring gas on the fire is the problem here. Not the adjective.]
[i think democrats continuing to try and label all republicans as nazis is adding fuel to the fire but ill probably be told that they're right]
[Uh, I'm pretty unsympathetic to republicans, about as far away from them as you can get politically. Until this election I've never thought or called republicans fascists or nazis or anything. Because those words mean something, they refer to positions, tactics, whathaveyou. I fucking hate George Bush, and Co. and think he's a war criminal who can rot in hell but he definitely isn't a fascist. From John McCain, Mitt Romney, Paul Ryan, Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, whatever, all people I absolutely, fundamentally disagree with, but again none are nazis. Heck, I even resisted calling Trump a fascist for a long time, and would tell off other people on the far left for using the term too loosely, and I still recognize important differences between The Nazis and Trump, but it was ultimately this RNC speech that did it in for me. The call for restoring law and order, the suggestion that it is only through the cult of his leadership that it can be achieved, the acts on enemies of the nation both internal and external, the portrayal of immigrants as a horde coming to destroy to meaning of The Nation, the emphasis on action over consideration, both against the leftists and predatory international business, and the need for a stronger, tougher police system to deal with the problems of the inner-cities. The only thing they lack is a cohesive paramilitary body, and that's basically that. I don't think all republicans are nazis, but all american nazis are backing their candidate, and republicans by and large haven't been overly willing to denounce the anti-democratic, bigoted, misogynistic things that the man is saying. Edit: Also the republicans, not just crowds and protesters but also even elected people, have referred to Obama as a socialist, a communist, a dictator, a monarch, and the crowds especially have frequently depicted him as a nazi, while Clinton has never referred to trump as a nazi or even implied it.]
[That's not accurate at all.]
[Ok, and which Dem Politician is stoking the fire here? Wink-Wink-Nudge-Nudging about violence and uprising? "Nazis" is not a new thing to American politics. Burning down your oppositions political offices *is*. So where's *that* coming from?]
[And what are you going to do if it turns out this was one of his followers attacking a GOP office? Given that he's been talking about how the GOP betrayed him all weekend?]
[No one's calling Paul Ryan a Nazi]
[He is a piece of shit though.]
[Definitely]
[Or John McCain.]
[Or Lindsey Graham.]
[Or Hitler! Wait... I don't know how this game works....]
[Or Mitt Romney.]
[Or John Kasich.]
[That's fair enough. I was just guessing if people were going to call him a racist for that.]
[I wish Trump's dogwhistle racism was the biggest problem with him.]
[This entire election season has featured leftists attacking Trump supporters. Nobody in the media blames Hillary?]
[Left wing terrorism is nearly unheard of in the US. When it does happen it's almost always destruction of property related to environmentalism or animal rights. Nearly every explosive that has been set off in the US with the intention of harming people or causing damage has been set by a right wing extremist. Most shit like abortion clinics, government buildings, etc.]
[A Trump supporter tried to bomb a Mosque three days ago. Trump supporters have also said we need "violent revolution" if they lose.]
[animals was too nice. He is softening up a bit]
[The perpetrators were likely human beings. These humans, if apprehended, deserve the rights afforded accused criminals and the due process of law. Dehumanizing your political foes (even the violent ones) is a well-worn step on the path to murder and genocide.]
[Thats what they guy you're responding to is hoping for]
