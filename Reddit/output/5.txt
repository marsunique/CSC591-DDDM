["We need to vet foreign donors the same we would vet lobbyists, only more stringently." THE HORROR]
[Ok, I'll bite. Which part am I supposed to be outraged over? All I read was talking about when it's OK to take money from people.]
[Because they may have committed some "light treason"... Image of the entire exchange: https://i.sli.mg/Y3cBg5.png Wikileaks link: https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/11915 According to the FEC: The ban on political contributions and expenditures by foreign nationals was first enacted in 1966 as part of the amendments to the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), an "internal security" statute. The goal of the FARA was to minimize foreign intervention in U.S. elections by establishing a series of limitations on foreign nationals. These included registration requirements for the agents of foreign principals and a general prohibition on political contributions by foreign nationals. In 1974, the prohibition was incorporated into the Federal Election Campaign Act (the FECA), giving the Federal Election Commission (FEC) jurisdiction over its enforcement and interpretation. ... The Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) prohibits any foreign national from contributing, donating or spending funds in connection with any federal, state, or local election in the United States, either directly or indirectly. It is also unlawful to help foreign nationals violate that ban or to solicit, receive or accept contributions or donations from them. [emphasis mine] Persons who knowingly and willfully engage in these activities may be subject to fines and/or imprisonment. Edit: Imaad Zuberi, one of the donors on that list, is already in hot water for failing to follow the FARA guidelines. http://freebeacon.com/issues/clinton-bundler-faced-no-punishment-failing-register-foreign-government-work/]
[Well, if the email chain is real (no judgment either way) then someone should look at it to determine if any impropriety happened. If it did, then the appropriate people should be punished accordingly. But to get upset over it right now would be as silly as say, claiming the election is rigged without hard evidence.]
[But im replying in a post about a reality tv star being connected to another radio host. Whats the point of the outrage in that? I just showed *actual* evidence for treason, and your advice is that people will "look into it"? I just want to show the blatant hypocrisy here in the hopes more people will learn to fact check themselves.]
[If you think any of this wikileaks shit is evidence of anything you don't have a firm grasp of the concept of evidence.]
[It's wrong to trust the system to work?]
[sounds like smart politics to me.]
[If that triggers your treason tickler I wonder what you think of the way russia has been interfering in this election?]
[So you seem to be confusing two things. Foreign nationals are prohibited from contributing to campaigns. You seem to think that a FARA registered agent is the same as a foreign national. They aren't. A FARA registered agent is someone who has taken money from a foreign government to lobby the US government. If they're a US citizen, it's perfectly legal for them to bundle or donate to a campaign. In the email chain you provide, they're discussing how even though it's legal, are the optics good if they let FARA agents bundle, or should they do a flatout ban on FARA agents bundling? They come to the conclusion that when Obama banned lobbyists from contributing to his campaign, it didn't really help him all that much, so doing the same thing with FARA agents wouldn't be good either. Rather, they'll decide who to reject on a case by case basis. That seems completely reasonable to me.]

[I popped on over to /r/the_donald just because you had the link and I was curious. Now I think I need a showerrrr9/11WASANINSIDEJOB!...]
[But 911 was an inside job! This ad makes Trump look great to conspiracy theorists. 911 was a cheap magic trick, the Israelis blew holes in the WTC using explosives, then used CG to add planes to the footage taken of the explosions. A Pentagon employee crawled through the hole and saw no evidence of a plane: https://truthandshadows.wordpress.com/2011/03/27/could-lawsuit-against-cheney-rumsfeld-and-myers-blow-911-case-wide-open/ Major General Stubblebine confirms that the wreckage at the pentagon is consistent with a missile and not a plane: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jc1ql4TfCZw This WTC witness insists it was a bomb, no plane: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq1-BCeNcm0 You can also see raw footage (ie. not altered to show a CG plane) that shows the missile impacting the WTC (no plane): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wF74zTLjNg You can see a comparison showing the NBC footage showing no plane was digitally altered to show a plane (as well as adjust the colors to make the buildings appeared white and sky blue for increased psychological impact): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPKq2K2dh6k The altered footage in some cases is obviously fake, for example tiling smoke: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkzfKRe0gbc But what wasn't CG was the explosions and the plane cutout shape they created. You can see those small explosions here (6 minute mark): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT1z90BB8E4&feature=endscreen&NR=1 These explosives were planted by Israeli Mossad posing as art students who rented a whole floor and got construction permits at the site. They even made a book about their "art" - which showed them standing next to boxes and boxes of explosives fuses in the WTC! http://winteractionables.com/?p=25207 Mossad agents filmed the missile impacts/explosions (to add CG planes later and pass on to media) and later went up to the roof to plant radio jamming devices. They were arrested and this is documented by the FBI. There was traces of explosives in their van and they were set up filming BEFORE the attack: https://www.scribd.com/collections/4010452/9-11-The-Dancing-Israelis-FBI-report Let me stress that again, the FBI arrested dancing Israelis on 911, not muslims. They refused to take lie detector tests for months, and when they did, they failed. So much of that FBI report is redacted, proof positive of guilt. They needed to fake plane impacts because a real plane would be shredded by the WTC like cheese through a grater. That's why when the Transasia plane collided with a taxi, the wing broke off, and the taxi wasn't sliced in half at all: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ29Zr7wWnw According to a WTC architect in a 80s interview, the impact of a plane (300 tonnes) is nothing compared to the 13,000 tonnes of force trying to push the WTC over simply because of its enormous surface area. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E15GbdVaV-Q WTC project management engineer atttests the buildings could survive multiple plane impacts. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fQlC2AIWrY Someone planted an engine (though wrong make) to further the plane deception: https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/34o4y0/911_engine_that_shot_out_of_the_south_tower_was/ Essentially the media got punked by Israel, because journalists just report what they're told. You can see another example of newscasters being fooled by a movie set into thinking it's a real plane accident. At the 7 minute mark in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wozTHxykDwQ The larger 911 plan required the destruction of the Washington bridge and Lincoln tunnel. That would take out the fiber optic cables linked to stock market/banking, markets would have crashed and there would be martial law introduced. You can see this TV report on the other Israeli vans that were intercepted, one of them exploded: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmpWe2Rhi_I Israeli companies moved out of the building months before the attack. Israelis in America were warned in advance through an Israeli messaging service: http://www.haaretz.com/odigo-says-workers-were-warned-of-attack-1.70579 Hundreds of Israelis were flown out of America, despite a flight ban, to avoid them being arrested by the FBI, including the "art students": http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/1387069/US-arrests-200-young-Israelis-in-spying-investigation.html Israel is the almost only country that benefited from the September 11 th attacks. In the words of Netanyahu, "it's good for Israel". https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUbTe50UUgM]
[im gay all of your post consists of lies and distortions long lists of YouTube videos are always sketchy]
[Make these arguments to Jews, it will really rally them to vote for Trump to clear their name. s/]
[Some Jews are 911 truthers. Just because you're a Jew doesn't mean you support Israeli terrorism. Example: Dr Alan Sabrosky, he's also former military: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDvAQGK0dAo]
[Take your meds!]
[lol, youtube videos are great sources.]
[I linked to an FBI report on the Dancing Israelis who were according to one witness set up to film the attacks BEFORE THEY HAPPENED. The section on did the Israelis have prior knowledge is completely redacted except for the title. So much is redacted it's possible there are sections like 'direct involvement in attack' are completely gone (ie. no title). Many of the youtube videos linked are primary sources such as raw footage shot from a helicopter showing no plane (and what appears to be a missile impacting the WTC building).]
[I saw the 2nd plane hit the WTC live. Yet you're really saying that ALL of the news stations covering it had doctored videos from multiple angles. I'm sure as a denier it makes sense to you, though.]
[>I saw the 2nd plane hit the WTC live. Do you mean on television? Have you ever watched a sports game live where they digitally project information like for example the country's flag on the swimming pool. It's called something like 'live compositing' I think. >Yet you're really saying that ALL of the news stations covering it had doctored videos from multiple angles. Nope. NBC had live footage showing no plane, instead what appears to be a missile: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wF74zTLjNg But then it was edited to show a plane using low quality animation software by a foreign intelligence agency and reshown by the rest of the media: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPKq2K2dh6k >I'm sure as a denier it makes sense to you, though. That's a loaded term. I'm the one putting forward evidence here, you're the one denying it.]
[this is delusional bullshit as a jew, I find your accusations against israel for something saudi arabia funded very offensive you hate jews]
[That's because I lived through it.]
[I saw it from the roof of my apartment building on Nassau Street, you lunatic.]
[Every single one of these claims have been debunked thousands of times over since 9/11. Then again, it seems you have made up your mind. > "You cannot reason people out of a position that they did not reason themselves into."]
[Your trying to persuade readers using an inaccurate stereotype. Initially I investigated 911 conspiracy theory - specifically the nuclear demolition aspect - to *debunk* it. However I found that though it seemed implausible at first, if you look at compare the evidence to what you would predict from an underground nuclear explosion, it checks out: massive 40 ft craters, massive long lasting temperatures (>2000 degrees for months), cancer cluster in Ground Zero responders, radioisotopes in the dust (in ratios consistent with nuke), in fact Ground Zero prior to 911 was only used to describe "the point of nuclear detonation". On the other hand, most people who say 911 truthers are dumb seem to me to be very mean and ignorant. I think the truth makes them feel afraid, and that's why they refuse to look at the evidence.]
[The radioisotopes in the dust were not "in ratios consistent with nuke". The chemical concentrations in the air normal compared to the mean concentrations of the same elements in soils from the eastern United States. The cancer in responders is from inhaling the dust at the scene, containing building materials, including asbestos among other things. The hospital workers and police themselves settled on calling the location Ground Zero. That's the most stupid argument I have ever heard for why a nuke was involved. And those temperatures and craters are both very realistic in a building collapse, and have also been debunked thousands of times over. You didn't really deserve a response, but there you go.]
[They were consistent with a nukes usage and not natural, as Dr. Chris Busby states: >it is highly unusual to find such high levels of Barium >I also found high levels Barium and Strontium in war debris in Gaza, Fallujah Iraq and the Lebanon. >The concentration of Uranium is a key. This is slightly too high in the dust and much too high in the girder coatings. He's an expert interviewed on Iraqi depleted/enriched uranium shells by Russia Today. https://www.rt.com/news/uranium-birth-defects-fallujah-729/ >The cancer in responders is from inhaling the dust at the scene, containing building materials, which included asbestos. But only radiation can cause increases in rates of multiple myeloma, or "nagasaki disease". Thyroid cancer rates are 10 times higher in Ground Zero cops than normal. You don't see such cancer spikes in say Wellington, where an earthquake covered the city in dust, some from open asbestos sites. You only see spikes like that in say the US navy ship that sailed through radioactive cloud after Fukushima. >The hospital workers and police themselves settled on calling the location Ground Zero. So? Prior to 911 it was only used to indicate "the point of a nuclear detonation". >And those temperatures and craters are both very realistic in a building collapse Nope. Nor are the 40 ft potholes found below the WTC "realistic". A nuke created them. When a building collapses they don't cause Granite to vaporize, don't be silly. The WTC "fires" lasted months at temperatures >2000 degrees. Only a nuke releases that amount of energy. According to NIST the Jet fuel completely burnt *within 5 minutes.*]
[> ... Barium levels of 3000 ppm and above are absolutely realistic in this part of the U.S. Also, adding that that guy was interviewed by RT adds absolutely nothing to his credibility, so you could probably have skipped that... > ... The cause of multiple myeloma is not known. The cause of thyroid cancer is not known. And the fact that you think the site is called Ground Zero because there was a bomb is mind-boggling. Who would have named it ground zero? Wouldn't the logical thing be, if you were an insider that knew you were going to blow the buildings up, to actually call the site something that *didn't* give credence to a bomb theory? You are really blowing my mind here. >Nor are the 40 ft potholes found below the WTC "realistic". Sure. If you can show me another 500,000 ton object falling onto a similar area as the WTC I will believe you. Other than that this sounds like some bullshit you've chosen to believe. There is absolutely nothing that lends credence to the theory that such a crater would not be created from such an immense mass collapsing in one spot. > at temperatures >2000 degrees. > Only a nuke releases that amount of energy. Both of these statements are complete and utter bullshit.]
[>The cause of multiple myeloma is not known. The cause of thyroid cancer is not known. We can show that increases of both is correlated with radiation exposure and not construction work. >Who would have named it ground zero? Not the insiders obviously. >There is absolutely nothing that lends credence to the theory that such a crater would not be created from such an immense mass collapsing in one spot. Except maybe they weren't directly below the building and the official story is glaciers created them millions of years ago. >Both of these statements are complete and utter bullshit. So why is Mayor Guilliani saying it? >With buildings were still unstable, with fires raging below ground of 2,000 degrees or more, there was good reason for their concern. http://edition.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/08/30/giuliani.transcript/ As well as Ground Zero workers: >“Instead of heat subsiding within a week, as is generally the case for major fires, the astronomically elevated heat levels remained for three months. Cleanup vendor Bechtel Corporation—with 40 employees at the Pile—issued this comment about working conditions: >“The debris pile at Ground Zero was always tremendously hot. Thermal measurements taken by helicopter each day showed underground temperatures ranging from 400ºF to more than 2,800ºF. The surface was so hot that standing too long in one spot softened (and even melted) the soles of our safety shoes.” http://www.veteranstoday.com/2016/10/05/911-filling-in-the-map-tracing-the-nukes/]
[The only reason the cancer and other illnesses have abysmally high rates was due to the pathetic protective equipment they used. You'll find the rates are extremely high with inadequate PPE.]
[Not everyone wore poor protective clothing, the FBI wore hazmat suits. Why wasn't there a similar cancer spike after Wellington's earthquake, where dust from open asbestos sites covered the whole city? Why are we instead only seeing illnesses consistent with radiation exposure, like the US Navy personnel experience after sailing through the radiation cloud from Fukushima?]
[>Not everyone wore poor protective clothing, the FBI wore hazmat suits. A small percentage of people with good protective equipment wouldn't move the statistics obviously. Any numbers on the people with good PPE? >Wellington's earthquake, where dust from open asbestos sites covered the whole city? You do realize density of particulates in the air makes a massive difference, right? Ground Zero was literally ground zero and the highest possible density of particulates in the air and with the amount of building materials, it'd be very dense. It seems like you fail a bit at critical thinking. Do you believe everything you're told from an unofficial source because it sure seems like it? I was tempted to check out some of your links but it's obvious you don't even vet what you read and believe so I'm sure it's of the same amazing quality.]
[What about the tens of thousands of people who personally saw the second plane with their own eyes?]
[Can you provide evidence of these tens of thousands who saw the planes? The witness statements vary widely, from seeing a passenger plane, to military aircraft, to missile, to drone, to just a bomb. This witness was emphatic: it was a bomb, no plane! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq1-BCeNcm0 You can see in this raw footage something like a missile appears to impact the WTC: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wF74zTLjNg But then it was edited to show a plane using low quality animation software by a foreign intelligence agency and fed to the media: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPKq2K2dh6k There's defiantly going to be some planted witnesses who will insist it was a plane. Some of them appear to have been filmed in front of a green screen so weren't even there (probably to avoid their arrest by FBI).]
[I was on the Bayonne bridge at the time. I watched the second plane hit. You conspiracy theorists are fucking enraging, with the amount of disrespect you show to not only the victims of the attacks, but to those of us who *saw it with our own fucking eyes*.]
[Can you prove you were there and are not posting from Tel Aviv? This witness who defiantly was there said: "it was a bomb, no plane!" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq1-BCeNcm0 The firemen who definitely were there (the WTC were demolished on top of them) say they saw a black military plane and 3 bombs were used: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zED8dy63w]
[oh great you're blaming jews for 9/11 now]
[Yeah, I'm sure I could. I'd have to dig through some boxes at my parents house to get the picture I took of the smoke rising after WTC 8 fell. Or, I'm sure I could get my high school transcripts to prove I lived in NJ at the time. Or you could just stop being an anti-Semitic moron and come around to what the rest of the world already knows, because I'm not going to dox myself to prove to some idiot that two planes flew into the WTC.]
[Someone being paid to post from Tel Aviv would say the same thing. Btw I'm pretty sure it only went up to WTC 7 and it was demolished, it didn't "fall". There's no other examples of steel skyscrapers totally collapsing due to fire. It doesn't happen.]
[this is an excuse to bash jews, isn't it?]
[rofl]
[LSD in the water supply obviously /s]
[That's what I love about conspiracy theorists, they listen to the one person who thought they saw a missle in the heat of the moment, but ignore the 10,000 who say they saw a plane.]

Assad is the only hope for a Syria beyond warring Islamic warlords and the fact that the rebels are losing because they can't stop fighting and killing each other proves that. I hope Assad wins soon so the wounds can start to heal and country be rebuilt. I specialized in the Middle East geopolitics, and this statement makes my head hurt.]
[Uh, do you actually specialize in ME geopolitics? She's right bro. SAA's recent gains in Hama are because of the internal strife in the Opposition regarding the JaA purge. Before the rebels turned on each other, JaA was making huge gains and even threatened Hama with mortar fire once or twice. If the Opposition ever wins, they'll probably implement some Islamist republic a la Iran but Sunni. Most of the rebels do operate like warlords, running their own fiefs and extracting taxes and recruits/"recruits" from the areas they control. That's died down recently as Opposition has consolidated, but still exists in some capacity. If Assad falls, descent into warlordism is a very real possibility for Syria.]

[Jesus fucking christ, i know reddit and r/politics can get a little circle-jerk-y at times with being snarky towards the orange god emperor, but the people on that sub are fucking frothing at the mouth lunatics. The most unhinged, grasping at straws, hateful, bizarro world inhabiting nutjobs I've seen on the internet. I thought people were joking about them throwing hissy fits over being called deplorable but they really think being called "deplorable" and the actual soft context of the full quote is several degrees worse than blindly blaming your political opponent apropos of nothing aside from being a giant orange baby.]
[Well this subreddit is a Clinton circlejerk now so it goes both ways.]
[Stop comparing r/politics to that cesspool. You can't get banned here for championing Trump... Just laughed out the door like you deserve.]
[Are you joking? Plenty of people have been banned here for being pro Trump.]
[[deleted]]
[Dude I wish i was just being hyperbolic, go read some of it]
[So does r politics. Same level of aggression.]
["Some people have different political opinions than me and really like to shitpost, they must be unhinged nutjobs"]
[It's all memes and code words/inside jokes. Every thread is all caps with based this or cuck that in the title. If 4chan ass fucked red pill and had a shit baby you would get the Donald. It's unreadable.]
[Trump spending 18 months (or the last 5 years if you want to consider Birtherism) insulting other people is "brave non conformance with PC culture." Half of them being put in a "basket of deplorables" in a single speech: unconscionable erosion of their freedom of speech. Trumpet logic.]
[in a sort.of.poes.law variant... I am half convinced that most of the population there are AI chat bots just screaming meme's at each other and upvoting shitposts. the particular flavor of self reinforcing departure from reality reminds me of the experiments where they let AI rediscover math.]
[Those Wikileaks though]
[Check the rules for that sub. You are required not to just to join the circle jerk, but vigorously maintain it. You can get banned for just about anything other than full on cheerleading.]
[It's almost as if they need their very own safe space...]
[The sad thing is that 99% of them don't know that any logical dismissal of their lunatic opinions is censored so they think that they're right because nobody is disputing them. I laugh when I see them hurl abuse at reddit for censorship or complain about getting their post removed from here. They can't understand why MSM isn't championing Trump the way they are.]
[One of their stated rules is literally just "no dissent".]
[That's entirely what it was intended to be. That's not disputed by the mods or the user base.]
[Well besides the whole "last bastion of free speech" debacle]
[It's not even at its worst when I glanced at it today, it's usually 10x crazier.]
[i went ahead and got myself banned from there, its like an anti-virus right?]
[Funny thing is, there's probably a couple FBI agents that have been assigned to keeping an eye on the place at this point. This subreddit too probably. Getting banned from it probably looks better than not going forward.]
[I got banned there as well, for "admitting to being an SJW". Funny thing is, the only time I mentioned the term was in a comment with the words "I'm not an" in front of it. They're twisted, deluded people completely out of touch with reality. Just like Trump. https://i.redditmedia.com/BGpcRJ5bh2wDu4qSd9RYDcRRLshVSaQdzXCn1InI3So.png?w=952&s=556e89d1ca8924427ae94236227b6519]
[I'm banned too. It's super, super easy to get banned.]
[Yep same, just for asking what they're going to do when he loses. I'm glad.]
[I got banned for admitting to being an SJW. The comment that got me banned was "I'm not an SJW".]
[Yeah, but that's *exactly* the kind of thing an SJw would say. (tbf, I think their definition of "SJW" is "thinks telling 10yos you're going to date them is kinda iffy", so I think you're good...)]
[It's such a "safe space" (oh, the irony!).]
[I just asked how Ferretscalp von Puckermouth did after the first debate.]
[I'm dead. This is pretty great. I think this is what more people should be doing. Troll the trolls.]
[It took me two minutes to get banned.]
[I purposely tried to get ban and it took a rickroll video and like 8-10 hours. I applaud you for your quickness in the ban!]
[One of the rules is literally "No dissenters." and expressing Trump might lose is considered 'trolling' and the mods encourage people to 'deport' people who do.]
[I'm banned and I've never posted there. They must have seen me say something they didn't like in a different sub. I had no intention of ever posting there, but they sure showed me I guess]
[Same here. They did a sweep and banned over 2,000 people ahead of Trump's AMA. They had 52 mods working overtime.]
[I got banned once when I got on their sub by accident and responded to a comment. I sent the mod a thank you note, explaining that I would never purposefully be on their site.]
[I got banned for mentioning Stockholm syndrome after I was told I would learn to like Trump.]
[Pretty much any opposing view will get you banned. They're HORRIBLE about having any intelligent discourse.]
[I literally just said Clinton is leading in most swing states... which is true, by the way.]
[All you need to do is question the logic of something and they get upset you're hurting their safe space.]
[Oh yeah, they're almost as thin skined over there as their God Emporer is.]
[I got banned for pointing out that "Make Pussies Grabbable Again" was a pretty rapey thing to say]
[2 hours ago, on a post that began with "President Trump..", I said "He isn't president" and was immediately banned.]
[So now you know what you have to do. Make a new account and refer to him as the president. Let people correct you and get banned. Delete your post. Rinse and repeat.]
[I did too. Then sent the mod a PM saying "...regarding getting banned, bitch please."]
[I told them I agreed Trump was gonna MAGA....they muted me.]
[I replied with "something something First Amendment" and got muted...]
[> The most unhinged, grasping at straws, hateful, bizarro world inhabiting nutjobs I've seen That pretty much describes every Trump supporter I've encountered.]
[At least the stuff in the other sub is semi satirical. You guys actually appear to believe the shit you say.]
[Its funny because that's how the rest of reddit feels about posters on /r/politics. And before I get attacked, I post here and have made maybe one post on /r/the_donald during the primaries. This is literally on top of this sub though and it's a circlejerk about a Hillary Clinton attack ad that's backed up by posters regurgitating things she said on the campaign and building strawmen. It's hilarious the projection that goes on here.]
[You get banned from t_d for simply using your left hand]
[Again, it's a fan sub made for circlejerking, you get banned from /r/Pyongyang for saying you've eaten food that day. If the posters of that sub don't take it seriously, maybe you shouldn't either. This sub should have much better standards..]
[>Again, it's a fan sub made for circlejerking, You keep saying this. It's kind of true, but kind of not. It's the official Trump subreddit. It's not like some dedicated circljerk sub. I think it became very lighthearted because most people there are not capable of rational thought.]
[Eh, not really, there was a Trump for president sub that kept getting raided by people from here and the donald sub was a place to share memes, the reason it survived is it's stringent rules and the fact that it bans people arbitrarily, because it had a larger base than the other subs it became the "official" one. This is reddit, have you seen how Trump supporters are talked about and treated here? You think it's possible to have a pro-Trump sub with a reasonable discussion? Hell, I'm surprised /r/AskTrumpSupporters survived. The Donald is lighthearted because reddit is a hostile place for conservatives and at the end of the day people just want to share their memes and have a good time with their candidates. I personally prefer other places for a serious discussion and even for meme sharing and enjoy reading things with a liberal slant here but sometimes, and this is true lately, this place has gone off the deep end into loony world.]
[You just proved the point that pretty much all of us on the Clinton-voting side have differences, we disagree on several things, but we can discuss them like adults none the less. OTOH, t_d is as close as you can get to a hivemind. They're just like Romney 2012 and special Donnie himself, they're buying their own hype and "unskewed polls." It's indisputably an echo chamber where they can only hear the same opinions recycled in different ways. You can find people of all perspectives here, it's clearly far more diverse personality-wise, let alone politics-wise.]
[Well yeah it's a fan sub made specifically to circlejerk memes. They don't claim to accept other opinions, I don't get your comparison here. >we disagree on several things, but we can discuss them like adults none the less. This is incorrect, and I'm really baffled how you can even begin to believe that. There is the nerrative, sometimes there is a basis in reality, sometimes its outright loony tunes but it's always pro-Clinton and anti-Trump, no matter what the news is or what we are discussing. It's indisputably an echo chamber where they can only hear the same opinions recycled in different ways. If you didn't buy into it so much most of the comments here are downright disgusting. Let's not forget that every article on the front page is an opinion piece almost verbatim of what the Clinton campaign wants to push out. I was watching the news the other day and they were doing a segment on how the strategy for the Clinton campaign is to convince people that voting third party is destructive. I go on reddit, three posts on the front page with opinion articles shaming people who vote third party. Try expressing any support for Trump here, you will get attacked, get hateful and threatening PMs and people will even defend this behavior by justifying how you're literally supporting the next Hitler so you dont deserve any dignity or etiquette while discussing politics. This place is called /r/politics for fuck sakes.]

Let's not forget that every article on the front page is an opinion piece almost verbatim of what the Clinton campaign wants to push out. That's very much the pulse of the nation right now, either pro-Clinton or anti-Trump, and a lot of people are both. Reddit isn't the media, it's just people, so it's not at all surprising when it's a microcosm of what's happening in the minds of the public. You expect people to intelligently discuss Trump's dumb ideas? It's just not possible to maintain that, of course the natural reaction is to ridicule.]
[They are celebrating the fact that Utah is going to go red. I'm in disbelief.]
[It's not. It's a toss up right now and Trump is acting more and more unhinged. I'd put Clinton at a solid favorite to win it.]
[It gets worse. They think the polls are skewed because none of them have been called. LOL]
[Once you go full conspiracy theory, you're never wrong. You're right or they're lying. Either you're winning or they're cheating. That's the world these people live in now.]
[> They are celebrating the fact that Utah is going to go red. Is that still a sure thing?]
[You could celebrate this fact because it shows that Utah is a question. Utah should be blood red in any regular election, but Hillary's lead is so big it extends to the doorstep of friggin Utah. Even if Utah goes red, Florida, Pennsylvania, Ohio, those wont all go red. It's a sign we're winning that they're celebrating probably winning Utah.]
[Romney won Utah by 48 points in 2012 and they are celebrating a 12 point lead in the polls..]
[To be fair, Utah is full of Mormons, Romney is a Mormon, and Mormons have hated Trump since he got into politics.]
[And Utah might not go red.]
[I'm expecting them to celebrate the 4 point lead in TX and 1 point lead in AK any day now.]
[Fuck yeah it's going red. McMullin Red.]
[They probably think that Clinton has no chance since the sharply divided swing state of Utah is going for Trump.]
[They don't think she has a chance, because—and I'm not kidding here; this is what they actually think—polls include illegal immigrants. Just the other day they got all worked up over an electoral map that showed them winning California and New Mexico.]
[Winning California?? Loooooool]
[No wonder they have been saying that Clinton is rigging election in CA otherwise Trump will get a landslide . >they got all worked up over an electoral map that showed them winning California and New Mexico.]
[Oh no, I believe it. A friend of mine was talking about how Hillary is going to win only because the illegals are voting for her. I had to inform him that they can't vote and he rebuked with "They're registering", of which again, I informed him is illegal. He was telling me about how when he went to Colorado, they were solid for Trump. He told me not to trust the polls. It's scary really how void of reality some of these people are. They just think everything that doesn't go their way is because of a conspiracy against them.]
[It would be hard for me to be friends with someone who is a Donald Trump supporter, for as long as they are a Trump supporter that is (if they can get out of that cult, that is different).]
[As someone from the outside looking in, I am worried for you with the fact that Trump's basically been touting that the entire system is rigged if he loses and working if he wins for the last few months and his core supporters seem to buy it. the fallout could be catastrophic politically, we saw the Tea party and how that shook up the republican status quo which in my opinion brought us to the point of having candidates like Trump becoming so popular on the right, and the fallout from this idea that its rigged and the system of voting is falsified if he loses I fear could have horrible political after effects.]
[His base buys it, but his base isn't a majority of the country, plus it's his hardcore base, which don't include normal Republicans who support Trump simply because the other option is Clinton. I'm certainly concerned that some violence may break out on election night, but any redneck revolution will likely be put down quick with such little support behind it. Plus some of his supporters may simply be too demoralized after the loss to care.]
[its not violence that concerns me, more the political backlash. the tea party movement got a lot of house and senate republicans from the old establishment either kicked out for more radically right candidates or forced the establishment to move farther right and more anti-Obama. I'm worried that will be amplified by multiple factors after this election, worse than 2008 and 2012.]
[Tea partiers actually defeated a few Republican incumbents in 2012 and lost the Republicans a number of senate and house seats they could have easily gotten, that's how Joe Donnelly in Indiana got his senate seat. If the Trump supporters put forth extreme candidates, it can also easily backlash in them and leave them with democratic senators in red states.]
[A lot of people do this whether they realize it or not. We tend to self-segregate based on where we choose to live and who we tend to associate with. So we often overestimate the strength of our own political views on society. While definitely not as crazy, many Bernie Sanders supporters over-estimated how much support he really had.]
[Bernie supporters could definitely have been described as overly confident (myself included, I remember telling someone Clinton may drop out soon because a few polls showed big gains for Sanders.), but these Trump supporters think it's all the way in the bag. I at least came to the realization Sanders was going to loose after Super Tuesday. These people think Trump will be winning California and other solid blue states.]
[Yup, they actually believe from an anonymous FBI source on 4chan that the polls are being manipulated and Trump is leading by 10 points in CA. Leaving aside the fact the FYI having any remit over private polling, they believe *anything* that's pro-Trump and has *any* source. Even if the source is a Larper and they know it. Spent a lot of time there today and they're so riled up I'm certain that there's going to be aggro on the 8th from some of the poll monitors. Quite a few actively calling for armed rebellion after too. It's weird seeing them 100% sure that Trump will win by a landslide but 100% sure that they'll have to take to the streets. It really is a fascinating cross-section of society.]
[It's honestly like visiting a zoo when I enter that subreddit. I was amazed the other day when a post from there made it to the front page about how Clinton had acknowledged that Saudi Arabia funds terror organizations. They thought they had unveiled the mother of all fucking scandals, yet anyone who actually gives two fucks about foreign policy knew this already. They're simply ignorant. They know absolutely nothing about anything and live in their own little world where everything that goes wrong in their view can be explained away by conspiracy theories.]
[I get what you're saying, but the level between the delusion of even the crazier Bernie supporters and /r/the_donald is several orders of magnitude. Bernie Bros were overly confident and optimistic, but the trump guys are living in an alternate dimension.]
[People live in bubbles. That's why looking at polls is so important; you can only see what is going on by looking outside of yourself and your group. I periodically check non-standard news sources just to make sure I'm not missing anything.]
[Case in point: I live in Idaho and I've only ever run into 3 people who support Trump. I've never seen a Trump lawn sign (seen ~12 Clinton ones). It just so happens that I live in a very blue part of a blue city in a giant sea of red. I also work at and attend a university, not exactly a place one expects to see Trump support. If I just polled those people I know I would think Clinton was going to win Idaho with 95% of the vote, but I know that my own experiences don't reflect the way things actually are and I am under no illusions that Clinton stands a chance in Idaho.]
[It's why campaigns do internal polling. It's not to convince themselves or make themselves feel better. It's to identify where they need to focus campaign efforts. It's pretty obvious trump is ignoring the RNCs polling just as much as the public ones.]
[I live in Colorado and even school kids are openly ridiculing Trump. But I will still be voting just same.]
[The people who claim Trump still has overwhelming support make me happy because it (hopefully) keeps people at the voting booths voting against him out of fear he has a chance.]
[I think the latter is more likely than the former. People like to believe they're part of something big. Turnout is helped by telling voters "we are expecting a huge turnout and a close race". I am a former campaign manager, so speaking from expierence.]
[What are they saying? I remember making fun of Clinton back in the day (calling him Qwinton, yeah I know. Important issues voter) I haven't been in that scene in a while]
[You know what you don't do when you're in a country illegally and don't want to be deported? Draw fucking attention to yourself by trying to illegally vote]
[You don't understand, liberal conspiracy something something, illegals voting, election rigged, yeah.]
[They totally drive buses to Home Depot parking lots, pick up day laborers, and take them to polling stations! Didn't you hear? /s]
[With its massive amount of electors and all.]
[Pack it up everyone, election's ever]
[How else will she reach 270 without those 6 precious electoral votes?]
[You laugh, but I don't think there's a route to victory for Trump without Utah.]
[The electoral votes are precious to him because he needs any he can get at this point. Clinton could go on vacation till Election Day and still win a sizable victory.]
[r/the_donald celebrates every state every day for any movement in their favor. You cannot get an accurate snapshot of how things are over there by sticking your head in for 3 minutes. The content moves quick, it is one of the most active subreddits right now.]
[MONTANA POLL SHOWS TRUMP +10! MAGA!!]
[Reminds me of back when Bernie was still in the race, every poll that showed him ahead in Rhode Island, Vermont, Nebraska, or what-have-you got voted to the top of this subreddit. NEW POLL SHOWS SANDERS UP 15 POINTS IN RHODE ISLAND ^^^^Clinton ^^^^ahead ^^^^in ^^^^Maryland]
[r/the_donald has over 100 new submissions in the past 20 minutes, 230,000 subscribers. For comparison, r/politics has had 7 submissions in the past hour, 3 million subs. Shitposting of epic proportions.]
[I'm really toying with the idea of a bot that just makes accounts and subscribes to the Donald. I'd love to see their reaction when they reached an artificially inflated million. They'd probably see it as evidence they're winning]
[I know she doesn't need them, but he ABSOLUTELY does. His path is so narrow he can't win without them.]
[He's losing in almost all of the "swing states" he absolutely needs. Judging by how polls are looking [this](http://www.270towin.com/maps/W3mpj) is how the final results are looking. Trump is neck and neck in Ohio, and only up by 4 points in god damn Texas. That's how bad he's losing right now. He's down double digits in PA, and consistently in places like Florida and Wisconsin. He's also surprisingly close in Arizona, Iowa, and Missouri. Another bad week and he could be looking at one of the most crushing defeats in a while. EDIT: If things keep trending as they are, we could legitimately see [this final result](http://www.270towin.com/maps/bypvA).]
[I think [without Florida](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-really-really-needs-to-win-florida/) he basically has no available path to 270. But then again, they're probably fixating on Utah because they're in total denial at the meltdown and are grasping at straws.]
[His path has been obliterated. There is no path. It has been overgrown by the seeds of his past actions and fertilized by the manure of his current words. They're the best words, I hear.]
[I was really holding out for that one in a million scenario of McMullin winning Utah or Johnson winning New Mexico and nobody reaching 270, which would lead to the (Republican controlled) House voting on the top 3 candidates and a potential chaotic compromise of a 3rd party candidate taking the presidency. What can I say? I like drama. Unfortunately, my one in a million scenario is more like one in a billion. Trump is tanking so bad that he's not gonna win enough to make that scenario remotely possible. He's gonna lose by 100+ electoral votes. Possibly 150+.]
[And the best manure. Believe me.]
[I know people.]
[Hey now. Those 6 electoral votes may mean the difference between an landslide victory and a shutout!]
[The way Alex Jones ends that interview is so bizarre: "Thanks for coming on, you *will* be attacked, thank you!"]

[Wow, I made it to his "fluffy socks" rant, people take this guy seriously?]
[I've had him on as background noise for the last 3 hours and fluffy or mismatched socks as a repeated theme that he harps on at length. I guess he thinks it's a metaphor for "hipsters" who are brainwashed globalists because they love being "trendy" or something. Those words in quotes are both terms he uses *a lot*. I'm starting to piece together something resembling Alex Jones's worldview and this guy's noggin is sloshing around with so much bizarre mythology it would make Tolkien give up the pen. As for whether people take him seriously... that probably would have been a good question for his wildly successful AMA on the_Donald.]
[Only 50 minutes? Seems low with the gems he likes to drop.]

[He also said Kaine "looks like a child molester". Jones is a douche nozzle.]
[More Trumpist projection. Isn't Raping Donald currently facing a case involving sexual assault of a 13 year old?]
[Yes, but that case has failed twice before. It's terrifying that it even exists, but I doubt the third time's the charm here.]
[He's also on record saying really gross things about his own 10-year-old daughter]
[Bigly.]
[i get more of a Hillarys gay best friend vibe.]
[Nah, Gary from Parks and Rec]
[Well yeah. Bigots always think "the gays" are automatically child molesters.]
[Now that you said it I can't unsee this. I've never made the connection but it's so obvious now.]
[Gay frogs??? Has Pepe turned to the good side?]
[There actually is science behind what Jones is misinterpreting but (I suppose) alluding to. Frogs aren't turning "gay" as far as I know. But there has been documented gender switching (they explain this in the 1st Jurasic Park movie if you remember) that has been specifically linked to consumer weed killers that get washed downstream and aggregate in wetlands. http://discovermagazine.com/2003/feb/featfrogs/ http://indianapublicmedia.org/amomentofscience/sex-nature-happen/ As far as "gay" animals go, this has been documented for a very long time (before the liberals and their evil plot to get ISIS in the white house/s). There was even a famous gay king penguin couple at a London zoo in the late 1800s. Sorry I can't find a source on it, but the gay penguins there caused a minor stir and the zoo decided to rename one of them with a female name and just pretend it was hetero lol.]

[Nice! I still can't find anything online about the specific incident I'm describing, but I found this one: > Penguins have been observed to engage in homosexual behaviour since at least as early as 1911. George Murray Levick, who documented this behaviour in Adélie penguins at Cape Adare, described it as "depraved". The report was considered too shocking for public release at the time, and was suppressed https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexual_behavior_in_animals#Penguins]

[I need a few hours of these clips on autoplay, stat.]
[Seriously I was going to bed and now I am so thoroughly entertained]
[Holllyyyyy shittttt.]
[HAHAHAHA 5:09 Piers: How many gun murders were there in Britain last year? Alex: **They have a much lower gun crime rate because they took all their guns!**]
[Actually he sort of hit the nail on the head. AFAIK the UK has more stabbings than the US. I don't know the statistics, or what the overall stats are, but some of the violent crime is just shifted to stabbinngs instead of shootings. Edit: I can't really verify my claims so take with a grain of salt.]
[Some but not all. The UK banning guns really is ideal IMO. The issue is that in the US it would come at a *massive* cost because you'd have to ignore the constitution to do it, and that's a can of worms far more harmful than any number of gun murders. Also, actually taking all the guns wouldn't be practical for America specifically. Nevertheless, it does seem to be the case that taking all the guns will reduce violence.]
[Even so, that leads directly to: "I'd rather be stabbed than shot"]
[Either way you'll bleed out]
[It's much harder to go on a mass killing spree with a kitchen knife.]

Hes like those preachers who say the world is about to end every couple years except he talks about WW3 and globalization. Any day now...any day now...]

[Haha. Thank you so much for this. I knew that he was a 9/11 truther, but this is just so much worse than I ever thought imaginable. The last video where the BBC guy is laughing in his face might be the best thing I've ever seen. Probably why Rush Limbaugh doesn't do interviews outside of his safe AM radio space.]
[And who can forget his [Y2K](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WkGyAqVmCk) show?]
[THIS is the clip that shows how absolutely unhinged and dangerous Alex Jones is. He tried to dupe people into believing that a nuclear exchange was happening on Y2K. He tried to whip people up into hysteria in order to get attention. He's a chemically unbalanced street preacher with the operating budget of a mid-sized cable network. It's pure insanity.]
[I think there's something legitimately wrong with him. He is literally unstable.]
[And he owns something like 50+ guns. When people are talking about mental health issues with guns, he's exactly the kind of whack job that I'm nearly certain would fail the mental health check to get them]
[I caught him when he was on the local access channel in Austin. I have seen how unhinged he is.]
[Holy shit that third clip.]
[Best YouTube comment - "This guy belongs in a mental hospital or fake wrestling"]
[And so is Trump. ISIS will takeover the USA if Hillary is elected? Thats crazy talk.]
[That's Trump talk friends.]
[that british segment is the best thing i've ever seen. i had only hear about alex through the grapevine, but over the last few days I've actually watched some of his videos and those gestures the host made... it was just so perfect. thank you and god save the queen.]
[Alex Jones is what happens when you take the "Prophet" that wanders around shouting his truth on your college campus and give him a microphone.]
[Arguing with people on Twitter, almost every time who they bring as their source is this lunatic- infowars.]
[Wait, that's a thing that happens at most campuses? I thought it was a rare occurrence.]
[Well, and he also has an Amway membership that he's really pushing for you to join.]
[He literally used to do that around the UT Austin campus.]
[I loved watching people pick fights with street preachers in undergrad]
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJXspT2VtOE This is him in Waking Life. After 9/11 he was in New York tons protesting the Republican National Convention (I know, right?). Alex was actually pretty cool after 9/11; but at this point I'm pretty sure he's Koch brothers bankrolled, his message changed that much.]
[The Koch brothers want him to spread the word that Obama and Hillary give off the smell of sulfur and can be seen having flies land on them? When I read that the other day I figured, OK, this guy really and truly has gone off his nut. He used to actually do some good work, like you say - spreading awareness of the militarization of police forces, for instance. Maybe he's just pandering to the real whackjobs in his audience now.]
[I mean I'm not sure, obviously. But he's veered wildly between..."platforms" I'd say. Like, around 9/11 it was about militarization and that was good work. Then he went very out and out libertarian around the Ron Paul era, now he's going borderline racist/christian fascist and his comments section is basically stormfront, especially with a black president and the black lives matter movement. So I dunno...maybe he just goes with the tradewinds whenever he sees a politician who kind of seems anti-establishment. I really can't tell if the tail is wagging the dog with this guy. Maybe as his audience gets even more disenfranchised and paranoid so does he?]
[Sounds like he didn't get tenure.]
[So glad it included the gay frog bit.]
[There is actually some truth to it. There was a program on tv about it. Basically there are herbicides washing into ponds that make the frogs change gender and even become hermaphrodites. https://www.google.com/amp/amp.livescience.com/10957-pesticide-turns-male-frogs-females.html?client=ms-android-motorola]
[I'm sure when Trump dismantles the EPA the herbicides will start making American frog penises the envy of all nations.]
[I wish they have included the Fish People: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzNeg9D-EZ4]
[One of the craziest things about Alex Jones is his most crazy assertions, such as this one, often do contain some truth. Such as this one noted by other commenters.]
[Pepe like.]
[Is pepe gay?]
[Pepe doesn't care four your labels.]
[I'm sorry pepe.]
[I'm not sure of the context, but there *is* a pesticide, [atrazine](http://news.berkeley.edu/2010/03/01/frogs/), that turns 10% of male frogs into females and makes 75% of male frogs infertile. Jones is a lunatic and idiot, but atrazine is a serious concern.]
[It's a concern for its effects on wildlife, rather than its uses for weird social engineering.]
[It's also been linked to [a number](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/phs/phs.asp?id=336&tid=59) of human health risks, too. I 100% agree that it's a health concern for a lot of species that come in contact with it; it is not social engineering for forcing homosexuality or whatever claims Jones has come up with. But it *is not* good for frogs or humans alike (there are studies that suggest cancer links in people). It's a deadly serious concern, but it ain't the Illuminati; it's just the money okaying it until it's proven dangerous.]
[Right - I kind of fell between two points there, unfortunately; Rejecting the social engineering angle, but still wanting to say that regardless of human health risks there are still ecological reasons to be concerned about them. So I awkwardly ended up sounding like I was rejecting the idea of human health risks, which wasn't my intention.]
[I REALLY wish they'd included this: http://youtu.be/Pg_M0SsBNTA]
[Wat....]
[Trump top advisor, right there...]
[What? I lost quite a few braincells in those 4 seconds.]
[I've watched the longer video and you aren't missing any context that would explain his statement.]
[Nothing beats the time he went super saiyan https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqUk28OwHs]

[>666 is a doubling of 33--and 33 is pi *"...and pi sounds like the pie you eat, and hair pie is a vulgar way to refer to the vagina, which means that 666=pussy. There you have it folks. There's no denying that Trump grabs pussies because he's casting them back to hell. Trump is the messiah!"*]

[I barely passed high school trig, and haven't taken a mathematics course since then. Alex Jones makes me look like Blaise Pascal by comparison.]
[> I barely passed high school trig, and haven't taken a mathematics course since then. Alex Jones makes me look like ~~Blaise Pascal~~ Leonhard Euler and Carl Friedrich Gauss in one person by comparison. FTFY]
["Euler" is pronounced "oiler." Hillary wants to decimate our oil supply. Illuminati comfirmed.]
[http://imgur.com/ar0Tws0]
[You're doing the lord's work.]
[Is there a joke I missed here?]
[He goes on to say, "you can't make this up, folks". Yes. Yes, you can, Alex.]
[Maybe he means, "*You* couldn't make this up. Only I have the requisite amount of crazy to make this up."]
[Trump likes that line, too. he says "you can't make this up, folks" a lot.]
[That's literally all he does (makes stuff up). It makes sense that "you can't make this up, folks" is his catch phrase. He has to constantly defend himself.]
[There was an interview where Alex talked about a conspiracy to kill him, and the guy next to him was like "if they wanted you dead so bad then why are you still here?"]
[Because the federal government is a ruthless, maniacal, authoritarian dictatorship capable of pulling any number of false flags right under the noses of the public... and at the same time a complete incompetent mess that couldn't wipe it's own ass if you taped a piece of toilet paper to each hand.]
[Instructions unclear, butt-tape signed in triplicate.]
[what the absolute fuck is going on in America that this guy makes money?]
[Many people in America are very upset, since America has been declining from its dominant global position a few decades ago. It is now harder for them to get good jobs as it was in the past. They feel like something has been taken from them, which makes them mad, and makes them want someone to blame and be angry at. Alex Jones gives them a target.]
[It's BEEN going on. Anti-government conspiracy theorists throw shit at a wall since time immemorial. But since their lack of critical thinking for them doesn't extend to whatever career has given them at the very least a middle class comfort zone they are never challenged on their ideas even if they dont come to fruition. Sorry for the run on sentence but I assume you are...how you say...foreign anyway so you'll probably forgive me]
[He's tapped in to the type of customer/audience that is super easy to tie down. Honestly, I think both of them are a lot smarter then they're letting on. It's genius really. A girl I worked with, her mom thought the glowing red light on the new water-safe bathroom outlets are cameras. She came home and there was duct tape over all over the outlets. Then she put on her tin foil hat and took a greyhound to Montana one day without telling her family. She was obsessed with Alex Jones. There are lot of crazies out there, not taking their meds, obeying everything this guy says like sheep...but ironically enough thats theor favorite term for pretty much everyone who doesn't own an underground bunker.]
[I'll explain. Americans like to think that they are supreme and far more intelligent than the rest of the world. The truth is a majority of Americans lack basic education and a brain equipped for rational thought. If you had a semi intelligent mind you could easily succeed in this country. Just watch how many voters are voting for Donald Trump as president. Now watch me get down voted for saying it.]
[No no no. You get UPVOTED for bashing someone thats not Hillary here. Its politics bro...well, r/politics anyway]
[I'm always shocked when I hear Americans say "we" when referring to good things America has accomplished. I think stupid people actually think they get partial credit for things smart people have done if they live in the same country. I guess that's why people like the NFL.]
[Donald Trump will lose, which by your definition proves he has less than majority approval.]
[Unless at least less than 15% of the population votes for Trump, my point still stands.]
[...because over 15% is a majority? Are you testing me?]
[I'll explain. Americans like to think that they are supreme and far more intelligent than the rest of the world.

[As a non-American, it boggles my mind that he still has the amount of support that he does.]
[No argument there. It's a damn shame. But within that there are a lot of people just voting nihilism. Similar to the Brexit vote, and fortunately not near as close. (Fingers crossed)]
[All the Americans I regularly interact with concur.]
[I've read this exact same comment before like twice now. Wtf is going on?]

Just watch how many shitposters are voting for Donald Trump as president. Now watch me get down voted for saying it.]
[He's been an issue for quite a while. Alex Jones is the same guy that pushed that jade helm conspiracy theory that "the US military was going to invade Texas and take everyone's guns and round everyone up and use Wall-Marts as detention centers for Republicans". And a ton of gullible people took him seriously for some reason. Which led to no end of problems, including absurd things like the military having to do press conferences explaining that no, they weren't going to invade Texas, and even the Texas Governor telling the Texas national guard to "keep an eye on" the US military exercise. Complete shit show.]
[i got kicked out of my house and my gf and i split because of that bs.]
[The threat was real: https://youtu.be/Xhn7FHHQbVw]
[I remember someone around the time that was going on had to remind people that Texas was already part of the US and there would be no point to invading it.]
[I knew Alex Jones in high school and I remember when he first started his cable access show. Moved from Austin to Dallas in 98 and forgot he existed. Heard his name floated a few times over the years and was like..hey wow, that guy is going places. Never once thought of him as "crazy", just a bit susceptible to white noise. Moved back to Austin in 2002 and came to realize almost immediately that he'd gone whackadoo and over the last ten years or so...holy shit. He's just batshit crazy. But not the clinical "crazy", mind you. Probably couldn't diagnose him with anything at all and he clearly has his faculties about him. He simply exists on a plane slightly different from most.]
[I think he might have paranoid personality disorder. I think that's a diagnosis that could stick.]
[So.....what was he like in High school? I'm really curious.]
[Sure you can diagnose him. Schizotypal personality disorder https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizotypal_personality_disorder]
[He's not crazy, he's just an incredibly good conman with no morals. He doesn't believe the dumb shit he says, he just knows that he'll keep getting paid if he keeps saying it. The saddest part are the number of morons that *actually* believe his schtick]
[He's not crazy, he's a bullshitter. His goal isnt to speak truth or lies, it's to emotionally impact his listener. The choice of 'facts' that he includes has nothing to do with their veracity, and everything to do with their emotional impact on the audience. Think about it, how would he change if Obama murdered a kid on the White House lawn? His show would sound identical, valid point or not. Donald is also a bullshitter. It really doesnt matter what they actually believe, it's how they feel that matters, and they express that through whatever means necessary. This is why you can find clips of him making sense on some issues (like how easy it is to buy power in Washington when you're rich) and make no sense on others. He has an emotional point of view.]
[So he's not really a secret CIA plot to turn Bill Hicks into a conspiracy nutjob?]
[Ayyyy Anderson High School what up]
[I didn't actually go to Anderson, I went to Westwood. I knew him from parties and Windy Point.]
[Oh damn. I hear Westwood is much harder than Anderson, and I thought Anderson was pretty challenging. Must be interesting knowing Alex back when he wasn't unhinged.]
[There is a large group of people who believe that Alex Jones is not real, and that - under the direction of the CIA - the comedian Bill Hicks faked his own death during the Waco incident and emerged as a new persona, "Alex Jones". Co intel pro 101. Search Google/YouTube for "Alex Jones bill hicks". If you really went to high school with him, I think you'll be awe struck.]
[ridiculous, Hicks would never work for the CIA]
[There are conspiracy theories... about the conspiracy theorist. How much deeper can we go?]
[it's ~~turtles~~ lizardpeople all the way down]
[I am aware of the theory. It's funny, but those people are morons.]
[He loves to brag about how tough and cool he was in high school, a real lady killer that nobody could ever take in a fight.]
[I can only attest to the fact that he was apparently not unpopular.]
[How can you attest to something if it was only "apparently true"? Either you were there and can attest to it, or you weren't and are speculating.]
[I can't speak to his claims. All I can say is that based on my memory of him, if he claims he had lots of friends and fucked all the cheerleaders I'd rate that claim as more likely rather than less likely. I don't fuckin' know man, this is a kid I knew 25 years ago. It's likely the only reason I have any memory of him at all is because he's been well-known for so long that I haven't had the opportunity to forget about him. Again.]
[He just figured out that only crazy people buy powdered food from radio hosts.]
[IDK, he seems to have some serious paranoia issues. I'm pretty sure he thinks the globalists are up to some shady shit when his toast gets burnt in the morning. I'm glad Clinton is starting to hammer Trump on his ties to Alex Jones though. This ad only shows a fraction of the nutty nonsense he's spewed over the last 15 years or so. I've seen some of my conservative friends sharing Infowars links and Paul Joseph Watson tweets lately. Man, they have no idea who these people are and what they *really* stood for before Trump came along. If they hear what Jones and company think about George Bush, the military, and the police, they'll want to crucify them.]
[(((globalists)))]
[It does seem like he works his crazy. Like he's rarely crazy in a way that seems like it'll cost him money. He'll be happy to talk alien reptile lords and Bilderberger banks all day, but that check better clear if you want to run your ad.]
[i was amused when, after Bilderberg member Thiel started supporting trump, infowars ran an article defending poor Thiel against the Department of Labor. they used to hate him!]
[Not as good as this bit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzNeg9D-EZ4 Or this slightly longer interview: https://youtu.be/xgBq6q4x8Fw?t=220]
["One, it does not exist. Or two, you're a part of the conspiracy". HAHAHAHAHA]
[The zooming in has me dead.]
["we have an idiot on this program" oh, my sides]
[Thank you so much for this. That second one is amazing. I love how well they handle him and that they are not afraid to openly mock him]
[Oh my god I think that reset my brain. Like I am pretty sure I saw a Windows-esque startup screen.]
[I got the BSOD]
[Trump tied himself to Alex Jones by repeating the same nonsense, only difference being that Bannon added the anti-semeitic conspiracy theories.]
[Alex Jones still dog whistles Jewish conspiracies too. Usually just refers to Globalist bankers or Israel.]
[Which is exactly what Trump has started spouting now that "the shackles are off."]
[or going on his show...]
[The Clinton campaign knows how to make some pretty good ads, I'll give 'em that.]
[Serious question, how is this a good ad? It tells me nothing about Hillary other than her opponent is evil. Is that the entire campaign? Is that the reason to make someone leader of the country?]
[Isn't that how voting works? "Well the other one is super shitty... at least I like more of this one's false promises..."]
[The do practically write and produce themselves, though.]
[80% of the ads I've seen from Clinton are just direct soundbites from Trump and his fellow wackos, followed by a few lines of text to the effect of "are you fucking kidding me?!" And that's all it takes.]
[And its all straight video/audio from The Man himself. absolutely incredible.]
[These ads practically make themselves.]
[I think Clinton's ad writers have got to have the easiest job in the world.]
[Most of the hard part is already done by Trump.]
[Ad of nothing but trump talking. Very effective. Lol]
[This is why when people clamor for Jon Stewart to come back I ask "why?" He's putting political satire out of business. You can't write anything funnier than the shit this guy is putting out seriously.]
[At the same time, a lot of Stewart's style was just playing the clips and letting them speak for themselves or contradict themselves, and then expanding on them.]
["I’m not sure what my job as a comic is anymore given what’s going on in the current election cycle. My job is to be crazier than what I see around me, but we’re really hitting the limit here" - Lewis Black]
[Seth Meyers is doing a damn good job right now with this stuff.]
[Stewart hits the issues head on...but I really enjoyed Colbert's parody. Sometimes parody is the best way to expose hypocrisy and absurdity.]
[I love and miss Stewart, but I am glad he left because he deserves better than this. He doesn't deserve to cover the shitshow that is Trump.]
[TBH, Trevor's been coming into his own. I've been liking him a lot more since the summer.]
[Ditto, I felt like he had the same problem Colbert did when he was starting on the Tonight Show. Once he got into his own persona, the show seemed more natural.]
[It was the same when John Stewart took over the Daily Show. At first it was really weird. It took about a season to get the right feel.]
[He does claims to have some of the best word, I will give him, just not in the correct order.]
[He has the best words. Sentences, notsomuch.]
[He has the yugest, most tremendous sentences. Seriously, they're really long.]
[So **that's** why all my frogs are gay!]
[https://www.google.com/amp/amp.livescience.com/10957-pesticide-turns-male-frogs-females.html?client=ms-android-motorola]
[Hm... is that top frog gay? It looks like anatomically the bottom frog is a female at that point. Even capable of reproducing. I'd say that top frog isn't gay. It's like falling in love with a post-op woman that can reproduce. Does that make you gay? Nah, she identifies as a woman. Edit: and even if that did make you gay, that's ok. We're building an accepting society.]
[So it's okay to chemically alter society to the point where it may be messing with people's hormones because we are building a culture of acceptance. I have no problem with gay people but if we find out there could be a problem with our water, we should probably try to stop it.]
[Oh sorry, no! I think pesticides have a terrible effect on the ecosystem but are they a government plot to turn people/frogs gay? ...No.]
[I hadn't heard of Alex Jones until this year, through this election. Just watched about 30 seconds of his show and I just...I dont... What in the fuck is going on with that man?]
[And he has a big audience too. There are people this guy is influencing!]
[Small dick and lots of drugs]
[Same thing that has been going on with him or the past 20 years. He's just batshit insane.]
[He's crazy. Also all of the people shouting "Bill Clinton is a rapist!" at Clinton rallies are doing it because he told them to. He has a pretty big audience in Trump's base.]
[I hope this video goes far and wide. Fuck Alex Jones.]
[How does Tump get away with having both America's #1 9/11 truther and Rudy Guiliani as supporters? Despite all the focus on Trump, it seems like the press doesn't do their job.]
[I don't think anyone expected Rudy to be this crazy]
[The media underestimated early on the stupidity and gullibility of many people in the American public. I guess it could be seen as a form of elitism. "This is so fucking stupid. There's no way some people who believe this shit could carry a presidential candidate." Guess again.]
[I find it incredibly perplexing that The New York Times or some other major news outlet hasn't covered Alex Jones and his ties to Trump. Jones is more or less the founding father of 9/11 and Sandy Hook conspiracy theories, and he's basically become one of Trump's biggest surrogates on the internet. The same connections could've been drawn to Ron and Rand Paul too, to be honest.]
[They have. [Here is a story going back to February](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/01/us/politics/donald-trump-conspiracy-theories.html). [Here's a May one](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/19/upshot/donald-trump-and-conspiracy-theories-what-a-poll-in-2011-signaled.html?_r=0). Plenty of other similar stories in the much decried "mainstream media". Trump supporters don't give a shit. Many of them will say "I'm not a racist or a truther or an Infowars kinda guy, but I support Trump because I want manufacturing jobs back and I hate Hillary". Doesn't make a fucking difference to expose Trump's ties to Jones or the so-called "white nationalists". Those people don't care.]
[Because the vast majority of the country that has no clue who Jones is and getting people to learn something new without a triggering event that they're interested in is very hard.]
[Yup. I have no idea who Alex Jones is or why I should care.]
[I for one think we should lay off these personal insults and focus on the real issue at hand--gay frog marriage.]
["Dig it."]
[[8 years of GOP's obstruction of Obama summed up in 15 seconds by Alex Jones.](https://youtu.be/LhqUk28OwHs)]
[Gripping evidence of Obama Derangement Syndrome.]
[As an ex-truther, I'm not afraid to say that i used to view Alex Jones as something of an internet demigod. The insane shit that he says used to resonate so hard with me. Alex is so quickly undone by any amount of reading or science or...really anything logical. That guy had me so convinced that Obama was going to put martial law in place though. He predicted that tanks would be rolling through the streets after "the secret Muslim" got elected. Fuck him. And fuck me for believing any of it ever.]
[Thank you for sharing. As a serious and genuine question, what made you originally get to that point in life? Or did it start with your upbringing? You eventually came to a point of logic and a much more sound place in life it seems but I am so curious as to how it happens/happened to begin with.]
[I feel like it was a combination of things. The internet was really the wild West in 2001-2003. So everything he put on infowars , I bought hook, line and sinker. I just assumed that all of his sources and science and videos and shit were all real. And then he started in on the Pentagon really hard core and how it was clearly staged and there was no plane. Except, I literally knew someone that saw that plane hit the Pentagon. And, Loose Change for edited like 487575 times to try and fit the new bits of evidence coming out (not his. But a veritable holy book of truther evidence). And, literally none of his predictions came true. There were no tanks. Obama isn't seeking a third term. The new world order hasn't taken over. And around this time I started struggling with my own spiritual journey. I've always been an atheist as an adult, but I didn't know why. Questioning that really started me to questioning everything I knew. Sorry for the book.]
[Thank you for the book actually. It's always good to realize where you came from and fascinating to learn about others]
[Just out of curiosity, what led you to begin questioning your own beliefs?]
[Evidence. Things I couldn't answer comfortably with the resources I had.]
[What evidence can we give today's Trump supporters to help them make the leap?]
[It's really awesome and refreshing to hear that you could reevaluate your own positions based on evidence. I think when it comes to politics, we get so siloed on our blue or red team that we can't view information without this bias. As a Liberal its one thing I struggle with and I think most people can be better at.]

[Remember folks, ABC, NYT, WP, CNN, NBC, CBS, and everyone else is in a conspiracy to rig the election against Donald Trump... listen to Infowars and Breibart instead.]

[Why not both?]
[I think it's because, based on the crap he says, you'd either have to be a paranoid lunatic OR someone who exploits paranoid lunatics, knowingly, to make a buck.]
[It takes a special kind of crazy to exploit paranoid lunatics. Definitely not your typical business]
[In the end, he is an entertainer that is making a solid buck selling ads of prep kit bundles and long lasting ammo. The *actual* conspiracy is that he is making money off his idiotic audience. Lol.]

[Don't get me wrong, this is a good ad and this will be effective for everyone who isn't batshit insane. On the other hand, this gives Infowars and Alex Jones the appearance of legitimacy. That's something they really don't need. All it does is make them feel like they're a serious cause being attacked by the Illuminati/Bilderbergs/Bohemian Grove/the establishment/etc. Direct attacks like these are going to make all the crazies go "See! See! Proof!" That's really something everyone sane does not need given the current rhetoric being thrown around by the crazies.]
[Bohemian Grove was real and scary as shit, a broken clock is right twice a day.]
[It does seem like overkill doesn't it? I agree, exposing his absurd influence on Trump isn't worth giving Jones any more publicity and consequentially, victims.]
[There's a great essay on Amazon right now all about Alex Jones and his connection to Trump. Good read. https://www.amazon.com/Elephant-Room-Journey-Campaign-Alt-Right-ebook/dp/B01LXOO7UQ]
[Gay frogs! Damn you clinton!]
[[Casually watching] "Sandy Hook was a hoax..." [Casually watching. Man, this guy is insensitive to all those families] "I will not let you down." [Casually watching, barely interested now] "I DON'T LIKE THEM PUTTIN' CHEMICALS IN THE WATER THAT TURN THE FREAKING FROGS GAY!" [Watching intensifies. Damn. Just damn]]
[Beautiful.]
[That's beautiful]
[You don't need to be a conspiracy theorist to figure this one out.]
[This will be a huge trigger for AJ. Can you imagine living your life for the last 15 + years consuming nothing but conspiracy theories and slipping into a bizarro world of paranoia and delusion? To continuously search daily of any snippet that confirms your suspicions to add content to your radio show? He's beyond unhinged and I can't imagine the miserable life he lives.]
[He doesn't really believe any of this crap. Hes just a carnival barker taking gullible people's coin. I mean he changes conspiracies all the time because the stuff he says never comes true.]
[Talk about stupid. This guy had a bunch of people buying gold at inflated prices from his sponsors and hiding in bunkers because he said Obama going to ruin the economy, was taking away their guns and was coming on a FEMA choo choo to take them to camps, lol]
[In any semi-civilized country, *this* would not only disqualify you from running for public office, but most likely give you a free ride to a nearest mental health facility. How fucking dangerous is that in 3 weeks Alex Jones might be one of the most influential people of US politics, actively steering policy of the most powerful country on Earth. Bat fucking shit crazy.]
[An [episode](http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/trumpcast/2016/10/where_does_donald_trump_get_his_conspiracy_theories.html) of the Trumpcast podcast covers Alex Jones.]
[Fair play - it's the best ad so far of this election.]
[Both of these people are insults to the conspiracy theorist community.]
[On the one hand, we have nazi frogs. On the other, we have chemically-altered gay frogs. *WHEN THE HELL DID THIS ELECTION BECOME ABOUT FROGS!*]
[i think it's a biblical thing. Or maybe something to do with the lizard people?]
[Alex jones is the only man standing up for the frogs. We need to elect him!]
[I encourage everyone to watch Cenk from TYT absolutely demolish this psychopath when he interrupted their show, it was marvelous. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4pX53AqpUs]
[My favorite part is that fake wannabe chola Ana yelling and swearing and then telling Cenk to calm down when he's in Alex's face. She's so trashy it's amazing.]
[I hate Alex and he should be easy to demolish. Cenk did horribly in an easy situation. He's also as bad as Alex Jones in some ways as he is a history revisionist and a genocide denier. Fuck him. Fuck his show. Glad he has to go back to being a no one now that the primary is over.]
[What? Are you kidding me? Known idiot Cenk having a childish temper tantrum is not "absolutely demolishing" someone. Alex Jones wanted to wind him up and he succeeded.]
[>watch a guy get baited and fly off the rails]
[Eh... all that video shows is Alex triggering Cenk... Cenk does not look good at all.]
[Also, Trump ties Trump to conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.]
[well for one thing seems trump supporters are buying the propaganda that Clinton is "evil', sighs. and Trump isnt?]
[Don't forget something worse. "Christian Supremacist" Alex Jones. Has anyone heard him speak about non Christians? He's a wannabe crusader.]
[So you're saying his supplements don't work!!??!]
[Don't worry the liver shield still works]
[this isnt news though trump actively promoted this]
[Trump is Alex Jones' spirit animal. Edit: I also want to say OP's username = one of reddit's finest.]
[Are you sure Trump isn't Jock Cranly? Alex is Ron, on right after Bless Yer Heart and Beyond Insemination. Because that's how surreal all of this is.]
[So... Milo is Wade? Or scott Baio?]
[I would have thought this sub were huge fans of Alex Jones considering how many "Charlotte Firebomb was a false flag attack" comments I've seen today.]
[Yeah, Alex Jones is a [weird dude.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McQ58nhhpHM)]
[They should have started with the gay frogs bit after introducing Alex Jones, Then put the interview with trump in tying him to Jones, while ending it with the gay frogs bit again. Cut, print, then deliver it to every single TV station in the United States. Add narration and it's a fantastic radio ad. If nothing else, I'd pause every single time it came on to laugh my ass off.]
[They should because then people might Google gay frogs and find out that there is some truth to the statement. https://www.google.com/amp/amp.livescience.com/10957-pesticide-turns-male-frogs-females.html?client=ms-android-motorola]
[Certain amphibians have the ability to change genders. Certain pesticide runoff happen to match the cues which tell the frogs to change gender. I don't know how you jump from that to some lunatic rambling about turning them gay]
[If the frog becomes female, is the frog gay then? Because it sounds like they're making those male frogs into female.]
[I don't know if they are gay because I haven't seen their shoes. It is changing the sex of frogs so they might be transgendered. Either way, there are studies available that prove estrogen is getting into our water supply and the majority it is from farm runoff.]
[No, it's darned interesting.]
[They share a pubic hair]
[It is amazing!]
[Seems like Trump tied himself to Alex Jones. Nice ad, though.]
[Because Alex Jones has such widespread name recognition…]
[They don't need name recognition, they showed what he says and very effectively tied him to Trump.]
[Now that ad ought to get the masses stirring.]
[Has anyone else noticed that the Trump supporters have largely withdrawn into T_D? Haven't really seen too many of them venture outside of their mod-enforced safe space lately to try to defend the latest stupid thing Trump did/said. I saw an article earlier today where a Trump supporter at a recent rally said, "everyone I know is supporting Trump and saying it's going to be a landslide, so there's no reason to worry right now." It's like they didn't learn their lesson from the Great Romney Landslide of 2012 and have decided that *this time* thinking you're going to win "in a landslide" because your echo chamber says so will *totally* work.]
[Jesus. This is surreal. And the ridiculous part is trumps base listens to this crap.]
[I like how Jones has so many conspiracies going on the overlap and contradict each other. I need a way to exploit the gullibility of these rubes]
[Why do we need a video from Clinton for this? We know they are tied together. They regularly praise each other and he regularly gets interviewed by him.]
[It is amazing how the politicians can twist your words. All you do is express support for someone and their views, and all of a sudden you are being linked to that person and their views. It is like when Trump simply refused to denounce to disassociate himself from White Supremacists. Suddenly, they are trying to suggest he is associated somehow with white supremacists.]
[that bit of him throwing a tantrum and hitting the desk had me giggling. i knew he was crazy but i didn't know he was this crazy]
[While I smugly enjoyed the video, I have no idea who it is supposed to convince. Anyone who is still considering Trump at this point will not care about this, so IMO it is just a distraction.]
[Are they still conspiracies when they're all coming true??]
[Someone in the media needs to get off their ass and tie Jones to his anti-Sandy Hook bullshit and then question Trump about Sandy Hook. You know goddamn well he'll challenge what really happened.]
[I'm 100% certain that Alex Jones and his sheep will see this as nothing but vindication. They're getting close to toppling the NWO if the next President is trying to take him down. If what Alex Jones is saying isn't true, why is he being persecuted? Why are they trying so hard to discredit him? Just watch how they spin it. Pay special attention to his mind slaves and how they buy whatever story Jones feeds them. No doubt, he'll be making it all about him. This is a surprising ad and I was against it there for a bit. The less exposure this lad gets the better and validation by acknowledgment is a risk. However, I see the game plan here. Clinton needs to keep undecideds from going to Trump and those conspiracy nuts she's offending (by insulting their leader) would never vote for her. If she just maintains, she's home and dry. It's pretty smart to push Donald's own narrative here and associate his unraveling with the fantasy peddling. It also benefits her when it comes to the email stuff. Trump and his centipedes don't realize they're playing right into her trap. Finally, I've never seen campaign ads done so well. The team behind them are an absolute credit to their agency.]
[As Gubber would say Suuuuprise, Suuuuuprise]
[That would be Gomer Pyle, not his cousin Goober.]
[right you are --Goolleee]
[What? Alex Jones doesn't like Trump and is losing viewers because of it.]
[And?]
[Alex Jones is a conspiracy nut job.]
[Yes I know. People are knee-jerk downvoting. My "And?" is meant to say of course her ad links him, he is linkable to Alex Jones. We know they are both nutjobs. No worries.]
[Sorry, we all on here and we just wanna stomp all the trump supporters dicks in the dirt really really bad. Nothing personal, unless you supported trump... Then....]
[I support trump]
[Pull out your dick so they can stomp on it already.]
[I think he's just teasing.....]
[I don't think this is an effective attack on Trump, all it's going to do in my opinion is give Alex Jones who seems to love attention free publicity. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkRY_kA2Aaw]
[Yeah, nah, this bad for Trump...]
[Linking Trump to his nut job may make some people realize how stupid he is]
[Trump has so many things that can be used to attack him that won't give attention to a guy that uses conspiracies to sell snake oil.]
[It's just heaping more shit on the dung pile. While that might not seem like a worthwhile endeavor, remember that those ads cost nothing to make. It's just Infowars soundbites with text overlay. It's worth it if it catches even a single person who somehow still was going to vote for trump just out of sheer apathy.]
[> Trump has so many things that can be used to attack him that won't give attention to a guy that uses conspiracies to sell snake oil. But, isn't that what donnie's doing too?]
[Wikileaks has tied Clinton to far worse.]
[So by that Logic you think it's fine for Trump to do this?]
[Like what?]
[Nothing, Trump supporters keep repeating this trope with nothing to back it up.]
[I know, I was just fucking with him.]
[Give us a for instance pal.]
[well, Trump, for a start. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5A02pNcGHs&app=desktop I don't think we can trust *anyone* with such close ties to the Clintons...]
[Wikileaks has proven Alex Jones to literally be the most credible journalist currently operating in America right now.]
[Yes I'm sure Wikileaks thinks Alex "gay frogs" Jones is a reputable source, just like their Russian masters.]
[I *so* wish I lived in your reality. Coz it sounds *super-exciting...*]
[No.]
[The Clinton machine in action again, full of slander and character assassination. They've lost the debate and now they'll demean a persons character. Alex Jones is a great guy, he has done nothing to deserve slander at the hands of the clinton hit piece machine.]
[What slander? Have you listened to Alex Jones ramble about...whatever the fuck he rambles about?]
[Slander? This was a bunch of clips of him talking lol]
[Yes the guy who was crying about the fish people is perfectly sane.]
[Nothing? Not calling sandy hook a false flag?]
[yeah, he called her a demon from hell, but he didn't say he meant it in a BAD way. /s]
[heh If there's nothing wrong with Alex Jones, then there's nothing wrong with the ad.]
