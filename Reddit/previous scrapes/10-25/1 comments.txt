Is there anyone who didn't laugh when Trump said nobody respects women more than he does?
I laughed at the women comment, but I loved the "no puppet, no puppet, you'r a puppet" even more. That was hilarious, and shows you Trump really is a child.
> Is there anyone who didn't laugh when Trump said nobody respects women more than he does? Melania looked down at her feet and Ivanka facepalmed
I'd say cringed more than laughed!
To me, this shit is only funny after he loses in a landslide. Anything else is a disgrace
I didn't laugh, but I had a WTF moment there. He could've just said I have big respect for women, and that alone is fine. But instead he had to make it sound like no one else but him respect women.
That was one of his worst lines in all the debates. It would be weird for anyone to say. He could have just said he has a lot of respect for women or he has "huge" respect for women. It's like if Clinton was debating Bernie Sanders and said, "Nobody is more liberal than me!".

I actually had not watched yet but had been meaning to. Thank you!

Counterpoint: Fox News
yeah, we live in the digital age. trump's idol's words aren't true anymore.
>we live in the digital age Which just makes it easier to spread lies faster and farther, further compounded by the blind trust millennials put in non-credible sources just because they're "digital."
Of course it's true. The alt-right eats that shit up!
I would say the digital world has made it even more difficult to fact check. Look at how reddit loves to shit on main stream media. Here's the thing, the main stream media still needs to follow ethics and code. They are fact checked. They have been in the business for years. And what were reddit's favorite sources during the same time period? TYT, HA Goodman, Brietbart, RT, Salon, Freebeacon Those youtubers are not bound by any code. They can make up out right lies and they did. So in this connected world it becomes even more difficult to fact check because a biased person will actually disbelieve the main stream media or google and will be following facebook, youtube and twitter rumors. A media house with thousands of reporters and able editors is given the same weight age as a lunatic with his own youtube channel. There are so many who believe in Obama being a Muslim for example Mainstream media lies was reddit's slogan for months. Yet the sources they followed were plain insane people or people trying to make a quick profit. And in the end, every prediction main stream media made came true. Every prediction the sources reddit followed was proven false
Which is why a lot of people believe that Obama is a muslim not born in the US or Saddam was connected to 9/11... We live in a post-fact world.
Postfaktisch Found the German
You may take my Sauerkraut but you will never take my Braaaaaaatworscht!
I started laughing at Trump debate lines when he told JEB his brother didn't keep us safe on 9/11. He has had some great ones. The best is when he said he should have gotten the Emmy, but lots of material for sure.
He's right though. Bush didn't keep us safe on 9/11. That's why 9/11 happened. You can say Bush's response to 9/11 made the country feel better, but we most definitely weren't safe.
He was right. It was funny because no other Republican would have dared say that.
Watching Trump humiliate Jeb Bush in the primaries was so satisfying.
He didn't wreck Jeb anymore than he wrecked Hillary. He just had a receptive audience to his bullshit zinger one liners. This whole thing is like watching some awesome 80s movie about nerds and bullies, where the bully wins in the beginning, but later he runs up against a nerd who fights back.
People give Trump way too much fucking credit for "wrecking" Jeb, yeah he wrecked him all the way from **9-10%** of the polls (in July 15 when Trump took off) to **6%** of the vote in the early states six months later. The real threat in the primary was Rubio and he got taken down 50% by himself for not understanding his party's hatred of immigrants and 50% by Chris Christie doing a Worf RAMMING SPEED into him.
The Emmy one even made the moderator laugh despite him earlier scolding the audience for laughing.
See, we laughed with him when he wrecked Jeb. Now we're laughing at him.
Remember when he said Bush wouldn't be a good president because his wife is Mexican, and that would make him too soft on Mexico
One of my favorite joke from Mr Trump was when he said he knows more about Isis than our generals. Pretty sure the Generals are probably the ones relaying Intel about about Isis to the CIA.
I never understood this line from him. What possible way could he know more about ISIS than the generals, but his plan to fight ISIS is to gather those generals together to form a plan. Why would he need people who know less about the situation than he does. I believe this explains Trump's success in life. He boggles your mind with such bullshit that while you are trying to figure out what exactly is going on, he makes his move.
Not exactly, remember he would be using different generals. No puppet
Maybe he gets info from his Russian masters. :)
I think the actual explanation for his success is the fact that he was born obscenely rich and has managed to not lose all of it yet
You mean use legal loopholes to appear to have not lost it several times over.
My fave was randomly bringing up Rosie O Donnel at *the very end of the first debate*
The scary thing is that he really does seem to be incapable of controlling himself. Everybody can see as plain as day the traps being set out for him, and he steps in them anyway. I really can't warp my head around how that can be.
I still can't wrap my head how this man managed to beat out a dozen other Republicans in the primary in spite of everything you laid out here. Trump is totally oblivious when it comes to debating. Jesus... The more I think about it the more pity I have for those who ran against him and lost. They couldn't ever do the slightest bit of oppo research on this guy or figure out his antics when he's in a debate. It's not just Trump, the rest from the GOP are just as bad, really *that* bad.
First they ignored him because they assumed he'd flame out all by himself. That was a reasonable assumption considering how many other flash-in-the-pan GOP candidates did that exact same thing. Why waste time and money going after a Ben Carson when you just know that they'll be gone in no time. Then they ignored Trump because they didn't want to anger his base. All the other candidates wanted/needed his supporters. Remember that Cruz was actively praising Trump in the beginning because he calculated that he would be the inheritor of Trump's support after he fell. That dynamic is still currently playing out in the GOP, and explains how Trump got so many republican endorsements. The democrats had no such limitations. Trump was the republican nominee and wasn't going anywhere. There was also no chance to convert Trump supporters over to Hillary. As a result the gloves were off for the democrats to go after Trump. Once they did, Trump revealed his glass jaw. One other subtle handicap I think the republicans had was how they deal with confrontation. Republican ideology demands that force be met with even more force. To not do so is to look weak. Democrats aren't as shackled by those constraints. Michelle Obama can state that "When they go low, we go high" and get cheers from a democratic crowd. I don't think that would play as well for a republican one. That philosophy gave Clinton the space to bait Trump and wait for him to destroy himself. Meanwhile the republicans response to Trump, like Rubio's, was to try to beat him at his own game. And let's face it, Trump is a really good dirty fighter. Rubio and the others trying to trade insults with Trump made them looks silly and small.
Yep, this is the correct explanation. Nobody in the GOP underestimated Trump's appeal, they just assumed he would implode by himself like Herman Cain or Michele Bachmann. They were **ALL** trying to slipstream behind him and be ready to catch his voters when he fell apart. Especially slimeball Cruz... but Cruz isn't the only one. Even today half the party... Pence, Ryan, Priebus, McCain... is pointedly ignoring Trump and looking ahead to how they stupidly imagine "things will go back to normal when we're rid of him." They're literally like that Russian guy in *The Dark Knight* who ends up getting fed to his dogs.
The Emmy line was my favorite, because it 100% reinforced the point Clinton was making about what a whiny sore loser he is.
Yeah, but Donald was kind of funny about that one. The woman one was straight up denial.
No puppet...no puppet..... Ok sure thing Donald
Hillary had to do some damage control after explaining that letter, so she caught herself and recovered and started ranting and raving, Putin this, and Russia that, and you're a Traitor and I'm America and if you attack me you attack America.
You know, her pivot from that question would normally be something we all notice and laugh about, and if donnie wasn't a moron he would have just let her dig the hole and called her out on it. Instead of said "no puppet, no puppet, you're the puppet" and it was all forgotten.
It wasn't really a pivot, it war more of a damage control.
Either way. It was blatantly transparent and everyone would be talking about it if this was any other year or her opponent was anyone else. It speaks volumes how poorly he managed it. He made everyone ignore her shit and mock him for ... probably years. All because he couldn't just stay quiet.
We're talking about it and how Putin has outsmarted her. That's the takeaway.
No, we're talking about how easy it is to manipulate Trump. Trump's ability is that he can punch down pretty well, and drag people into the mud where he has an advantage. He shows his glass jaw when he is among equals, or heaven forbid someone above him.
Dude I was dying during that. No puppet?? What does that even mean lmao
It meant that Hillary caught him under the jaw with an uppercut. He stumbled around after that, but he was out. Walked right into that and other rehearsed traps all night. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaVWRetR4jg
It means you're the goddamn puppet. That's what it means.
And of course the puppet doesn't realize it's a puppet. It just dances for its master when asked.
I never said that.
No, in fact I did.
Wrong.
*Sniff*
Now, now.. settle down entire planet...
The moderator laughed
"Settle down, entire planet."
The debate cold-opens have made me like SNL again. That and David Pumpkins.
Alec Baldwin and Kate McKinnon do a fantastic Trump / Hillary.
I thought the black jeopardy sketch was pretty good too.
Oh god, David Pumpkins went so fast from "I think I hate this" to "this is the greatest thing ever" for me. "ANY QUESTIONS?"
He had a serious "I'm Brian Fellows" voice when he said it too. When it started I thought it might be the Merryville guys, cause Tom Hanks was one once, but I know they haven't done that since Hader left.
I'm pretty sure I heard Melania laugh.
For a second, before the sadness and loathing set in once again.
That was Michelle
1337D ping pong level burn man... seriously save some fire for the fuckin sun!
Bahahahahahaha
I seriously lost it when "I'm not a puppet! You're a puppet!" happened. He was like a parody of himself.
How was he supposed to respond to that, though? Her claim that he's a puppet had just as much merit as his counter response...
He could've waited for his turn to speak, of course, instead of sounding demented.
Maybe saying something like "Think whatever you want to think about me, those are not facts, but speculations. The only fact here is that I'm not the one starting diplomatic tensions with a nuclear powerhouse that could help us in Syria." I mean, I don't know if that was the best answer possible, but it seems 100 times better than going "No, you are! you are! you are! but what am I? But you definitely are!" like a helpless orange-gutan.
Trump doesn't like it when people compare him to an orangutan. He sued Bill Maher for it.
He *threatened* to sue Bill Maher for it.
No, he did sue and then dropped the suit... http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUSBRE9310PL20130402 He actually submitted his birth certificate to the court as evidence of the lack of orangutan heritage.
Maybe just calmly replying: "I am not a puppet". Instead he probably got some SNL writer pissed off cuz they had to write off a joke.
He was not supposed to respond because it was her speaking time and he was interrupting to say his stupid childish shit. If he managed to remember to respond during his own time, he could easily deflect that comment or ignore it if he were any kind of debater...or adult.
Don't say a "I know you are but what am I?" type response?
I mean there's no other way to respond to that baseless claim. And judging by Clinton's long list of corporate, wealthy elite, and foreign donors, it wouldn't be far fetched to say that she is definitely more of a puppet than Trump is. Clinton has been bought and paid for long ago.
It's hardly baseless.
Then his counter that she's a puppet holds even more base.
Presentation presentation presentation. Drumpf forgot the 5p's. Proper planning prevents piss-poor performance. If he wouldn't have let his jimmies get rustled like the child he is, and developed a coherent retort in response - he wouldn't be the laughing stock he is right now. Instead he got flustered, does what every pretend alpha male does, and projected back at her like a 7 year old boy who just got told he was a doo doo face. Drumpf said he has "the best temperament" and in one fell swoop proved just how thin his skin is.
Shows how stupid Trump is if he has all this material, and all he can get out of his mouth is 'no u'.
He could, and this is crazy, but he could have just let her continue speaking and not jump at a bait sentence that has zero meaning or impact. He could have kept quiet and no one would be talking about it at all. Crazy, I know.
She was trying to get under his skin and it worked. Trump has a really poor temperament.
I think you mean the best temperament. *cue laughtrack*
Then say that instead of acting like a child. How hard is it to just have discipline enough to wait until she's finished and state that "She likes to call me a puppet, but just a few months ago Sanders was calling her a puppet of wall-street and her paid speeches prove it." SOooooooo many better ways to have handled it without acting like a petulant child.
like what?
Like, well, almost anything else? At least something a grade schooler might not say.
https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/598tg7/obama_admits_to_laughing_at_trump_during_debates/d96n0mj/
yea that would have been good, i doubt trump had hours to come up with something like that guy did though
What guy? I just came up with it off the top of my head. And if Trump actually practiced and prepared it would have been easy to deflect from it and turn it on Clinton.
You're right, he had days
Ha. Trump isn't that clever. Seriously his (interrupting and immediate) response was an incoherent "No puppet. No puppet. No, you're the puppet." lmao If he's had waited until she was finished speaking he probably could have come up with something better, but she baited him *hard.*
>How was he supposed to respond to that, though? "No puppet...no puppet" "I'm not a puppet, you're a puppet!" I wouldn't expect anything less, pure comedy gold.
Easy retort is faux insulted, 'we're both Americans with the goal to make this nation better even if we disagree on the details. I take offense that you would even insinuate such a falsehood. Blahblahblah.' You know, if he wasn't Trump and wasn't running a campaign for 5th grade class president a line like that would put her on the defensive. Easy pivot afterwards.
Yeah but then she wouldn't have used that line on you. Her tactic was brilliant for her opponent. Saying he chocked started the downward spiral then calling him a puppet made him completely incoherent.
Oh, it would have been chopped off at the knees by the last 9 months of his campaign, no doubt. It just would have been an infinitely easier and better looking pivot for him than 'you're the puppet' x 2.
Duuuuude. How many Russian agents has he had as campaign managers?
Less than the amount of Saudi princes that donated to Clinton...
Are we getting brigaded? I rarely see this much concern trolling on here.
As we get closer to E day and the polls keep shifting further and further in Clinton's favour the concern trolling and brigading appears to be growing.
Why is donating to Clinton foundation bad when she is spending each cent of that money in helping the poor? I would never understand this logic. And how is this supposed to make Clinton want to help those Saudis when she is not even getting any of that money?
Because president Trump would stand up to the Saudi's Hahahahahaha
Which is less than the number of Saudi princes who bailed out Trump's failed businesses.
Saudi princes donated directly to Hillary?
he's definitely had more than 0
Foreigners cannot donate to US Presidential campaigns. http://www.fec.gov/ans/answers_general.shtml#Can_nonUS_citizens_contribute
He means, of course, that he is upset that the Clinton foundation used Muslim money to fight AIDS.
Yeah, charities should be more about the message they display from their donor's and less about helping people.
You let it go. If it's a ludicrous assertion, you don't legitimize it by responding to it. This is not high school debate team. You don't have to respond to every single point, and you certainly don't interject and say things like "wrong", "no puppet", and "such a nasty woman". Just shake your head and chuckle like Pence, have shit eating grin on your face like Video, or stay composed like Hillary.
i would have donated to HRC campaign immediately if she returned with 'Whatever you say comrade'
Nice comment history
"No puppet! No puppet! You're the puppet!" It's even funnier when you realize he couldn't even say it how you quoted it. Just started blurting it out.
Sounds like something Sephiroth would say.
Nobody has spit out a more childish response than that, nobody in the history of the world.
"I know you are but what am I?"
Trump is also all about being the rubber while HRC is clearly the glue
And they are sitting in a tree
She knew calling him a puppet would result in him denying he's a puppet, thereby making him a puppet.
That's some 3D Puppetry right there!
That right there is kindergarten 101.

My god, is that where we are? This place sucks.
There's a new documentary by Adam Curtis called HyperNormalisation - it's on the BBC iPlayer if you can access that or VPN into it, talks a *lot* about this concept and it's absolutely fascinating. Worth a watch.
YouTube Link... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js19h1GW32o
bravo this man!
Thanks. I'm about 30 minutes into watching it, and it is really informative. For example, I now know why people think that Kissinger is an asshole.
Hahah, yeah - Adam Curtis makes fantastic films. Well worth going back through his catalogue, his perspective on the world is a very interesting one!
Alec isn't as crazy as Trump even when playing Trump, and that's a little spooky.
Give him some credit, he was not nearly that coherent. "No puppet. No puppet.You're the puppet!" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaVWRetR4jg
This is seriously the state of politics in our country.
republican politics has been shit for 30+ yrs.
I love the pause before he says "this... person." it's almost as if he knew he saying woman would backfire somehow... but then later called her a nasty woman anyway.
Think I just figured out why so many people hate trump: listening to him is like being in middle school again.
Just wait until he loses the election... class 5 temper tantrum coming.
You're in middle school
Your mum's in middle school
"No u". I swear this man was memed into life by 4chan.
"No, you are" is more like elementary school material.
No, you're in elementary school!
Seriously, why does everyone leave off the "No, you're a puppet!" said 2 seconds later? It's the very best part of his childish rant.
I've gone over it and over it in my head. It was just so weird. You're exactly right though. It was exactly what a child would do. And I'm talking almost toddler range here.
The "No puppet. No puppet," is the silliest part to me. My 2-year-old niece said the same thing when she first saw those creepy mechanical doll things at Chuck E. Cheese.

Five Night's At Donnie's
SNL had it pretty spot on when they showed the entire Earth laughing at "Nobody respects women more than me."
What's not to laugh at? Trump lost them horribly in a very embarrassing way.
No, he definitely won all of them. Granted, he didn't perform nearly as well at the start, but did pretty decent in the last one.
He lost them bigly.
The side-eye Hillary gave him the first time he said 'bigly' in the last debate made me lol.
Disasters.
Seriously, why does he keep saying "bigly"? It isn't even a word and there are SO many other more effective words he could use instead. It's as if he is a 7th grader.
Actually, it is a word. Check dictionary.com
Also "hugely" and "majorly". *Huge League* *Major League*
He's saying Big League. He has used it as a hashtag as well. I'm not defending him here, I just hate seeing people ridicule him incorrectly when there is so much more to factually make fun of him about.
You are doing good work!
"Big league" has two Gs in it. 9 out of 10 times, when Donald says it, you only hear 1 G. Which means one of two things; Either he's lying about yet another thing, or he cannot properly control his mouth in yet another way.
He just mixes it together and the final g is very faint. You can here it as just a faint stop, a catch of air in his throat.
I'm skeptical. Are you suggesting he has a speech impediment or annunciation issues? Why does it only manifest with this one term?
Inability to articulate certain words might the starting signs of Parkinsons. He obviously isn't healthy enough to be President. /s, but enjoying throwing the argument back at Trumples.
I don't argue with trump people, generally. What reasonable argument can you give someone who doesn't appreciate reason? It isn't possible. They just have to discover the reality of the man themselves. Although I will often mock them for their choice. That's just for the sake of form and hilarity.
I'm not a Trump person. I think he is a raging lunatic, an unhinged bafoon. I was just referencing the constant fearmongering with regards to Hillary's health, while speech impediments could be a sign of a neurological disorder (or nothing at all).
Oh, I didn't mean to suggest *you* were a Trump person. I was only speaking generally.
Someone floated the idea that Trump is giving in to early stages of dementia or Alzheimer's. It never stuck because you don't want to go wrestle with the pig in the mud but if any of the candidates is on the way to the mental ward, Trump will end up there first. Look at him, he often seemed outright confused during debates. He would repeat himself, stumble around until some idea would pop into his head and it would come out as jibberish. Honestly I feel like if this was 2020, or 2024 he'd probably forget where he was or who he was and think it's one of those public speaking nightmares.
I wouldn't go that far. If he had the first signs of dementia, it would probably be known within the party, and they'd have outed him as such. Unless they're waiting, and if Trump wins, they'll then use it to kick him out and get Pence in. But I don't go into all these health conspiracies. They are exactly that: conspiracies.
To be fair, if you're running for President and can't say "big league" so that it doesn't sound like "bigly", then maybe you actually deserve the ridicule. Almost literally, every person watching the debates thought he said bigly, and not just once, but numerous times.
Honestly I'm pretty sure it's because he reads T_D. They use it all the time on there after the first time he dropped it, so I think he's doing it because his supporters enjoy it so it gives him a sense of being adored, which is all he really wants.
Trump has been saying "big league" for years on The Apprentice, long before this election cycle.
OK. I did notice him really start playing it up after the first debate though.
> It isn't even a word It actually is a word. http://www.dictionary.com/browse/bigly
I remember hearing that it was an adverb of big, but was archaic.
He claims he's saying big league. Not that it makes any more sense and unclear why he can't enunciate it properly.
i'm from new jersey. he is 100% saying 'big league'. i actually don't even think it's that bad, though apparently many people difficulty understanding it.
..and tremendously.
Exactly. His answers sounded absurd and ill-informed to ordinary viewers. I can't even imagine how Barack and Hillary feel listening to that jibberish when they know so much.
We have a pretty good idea what Hillary was feeling. https://media.giphy.com/media/26uf5YvN8Td27IrFm/200w.gif
That shimmy will go down as one of my favorite moments in politics ever. Such unbridled *happiness* on her face. My mom's about Hillary's age and I can't imagine her ever shimmying like that. I'm sorry I've failed you, mom... :/
He is also hillarious. I'm sorry, but I still laugh out loud when I think about him saying "I should have got that" about winning an Emmy. If this was a television show, and not a real election Trump would be my favorite character.
Pierce Hawthorn 2016
Well he *is* a reality TV star. He knows how to act on camera.
We need an Aaron Sorkin 2.0 to write a new West Wing (The Reich Wing?) about the second coming of Adolf Hitler running on a major party ticket. This idea really needs to be carefully aware of the line between decency and offensiveness, and never come within sight of decency.
Sounds like ["look who's back"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtW1Lq5c04E).
Wait, he's a real candidate?
Sadly...yes
Good god, why am I only finding out about this now!? No, I'm serious, I'm still in a bit of disbelief this is actually happening.

Mnope, just American. >Connecticut
When he interrupted Hillary with "she's a nasty woman," I lost it
The really hilarious thing is the context of the remark. Out of everything that was said in the debates, why was that moment the one that drove Trump to interrupt with a direct insult? The answer: Hillary promised to tax him. That's right - the one thing that triggers Trump more than *anything* is the idea of being forced to pay his taxes.
Me and my dad both laughed our asses off.
I really thought saying Donald choked in Mexico was the comedy highlight given his ego and because so many supporters desperately want a wall.
Great slam, but funny?
Hilarious in context - it was incredibly obvious bait to get the man into a rage. And he did just that. Started going way off the rails. If he had calmly responded or not even bothered to respond, it would have been kind of sad instead.
I thought it was golden. His ego must have been screaming. It's such a central issue to many of his early adopters and he absolutely choked and got into a twitter war after.
Not really. But Donald's tone totally changed after. Hillary is the anti-Trump. She's learned or has been coached. Whatever it is she is an expert at drawing out 3am Trump to great effect.
the puppet part was the best
You can see the triggering happen in real time.

Holy fuck, the 3rd debate is the only one I missed--is that gif real?
You need to see the puppet bit
100% real. At the end, she went up to the front and he stayed behind his podium for a minute.
Jesus.
It's so weird, but I am so conflicted about my schadenfreude and my sympathy for him in this shot. Don't get me wrong... I'm glad that he has been exposed, but I can't help but notice how miserable that man must feel inside, and how much he needs mental health treatment.
Right there with you. At some point it's not about keeping his humanity, but more my own. Descending into seeing others an non-human is a dangerous trip. Hope that made any sense at all. :/
I agree, but narcissists and people with Borderline Personality Disorder are absolutely the worst to treat, and the worst at seeking help. Because everything is someone else's fault. They have no problems; if people would just stop persecuting them, everything would be fine.
If its truly a case where he's descending into some form of mental illness (which might explain some things... and his dramatic shifts over the last few years), i would feel a little bad. But also pretty damn glad he's losing in the polls lol.
On the one hand, he definitely deserves no slack, coming as close as he has to the nuclear codes and the mess he'd make of the government. On the other, I wonder if we're seeing the early stages of dementia (along with his narcissism). That inability to finish a sentence or a thought seems like it might be a sign.
his father also had dementia and it can be hereditary.
He's been an asshole for his entire adult life, and he's had more than enough money to fix it. Fuck him.
It's crazy how much older he looks right here. He's really started to look his age the past couple months. I think I first noticed it in his video statement after the Access Hollywood tape, but I kinda chalked it up to bad lighting. Here, it seems pretty obvious. Crazy.
He looks a lot better at his rallies usually. I think he feeds off that energy somewhat, and in a relatively dead room like the debate, and against someone who could outmaneuver him, it drains him and leaves him frustrated.
He looks better at rallies because it feeds his ego. He has proven time and time again he can say whatever he wants, and he gets thunderous applause.
He looks soooo pissed. I wonder if it's b/c he lost Bigly or b/c his hands are so tiny he's having trouble ripping that notebook.
God I absolutely *cannot wait* for the mountains of NaCl that will come out of /r/the_turd on election day.

Like this? [/r/The_Dipshit](/r/the_donald)
I bet the subreddit goes private immediately, soon to be followed by admins killing it
Not even close to as funny as when he said "I should have got that" about losing the Emmy. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33F51c0EqPM
*should have got* isn't even American.
In my eyes that was a joke, not meant serious.
Well when I watch it it seems like he means it as a joke
Seriously, how do people not get that?
It's /r/politics, they like overestimating how well Clinton did.
I loathe Trump, but if that line had been his sole gaff at the debates, honestly, it would have read as a very funny bit of self-deprecation. Obviously, that's not the case. Just think it would have been funny either way.
I agree. While think it was the whole "a broken clock is right twice a day" thing, but he nailed that delivery so well that I could almost see it all being a big troll to push the two party system to the breaking point. And then realty came back.
But Donald isn't broken, he's backwards, and won't ever be right
That was truly amazing. At least someone will believe him when he says that the FBI or GOP primaries were rigged. Plenty believe that. But he refuses to back down when it comes to the Emmys?
It's so hard to believe that statement isn't a SNL bit. I sooo hope Baldwin gets an Emmy for this. Imagine the burn as he gets one for imitating trump.
Yeah if Alec gets one for playing Trump when Trump didn't get one for playing Trump.
I'm honestly awestruck that Trump could be so stupid as to take the most obvious bait ever conceived. Somebody should do the "got your nose!" thing they do with babies to see how he reacts. He will probably sue that person for bodily harm.
> Somebody should do the "got your nose!" thing they do with babies to see how he reacts. Literally spit a pretzel out when I read this.
Speaking of W., I wonder if he laughed during the debates.
Pretzel.
No pretzel. You the pretzel.
"Got your nose!" "No nose! No nose! I've got *your* nose!"
Well, it all makes sense, now. Trump is the head of the Nose-Nothings.
>"No nose! No nose!" https://media.giphy.com/media/26tPj9PmmKCB8Zopq/200w.gif
Oh God. /r/Eyebleach
"Weak and ineffective /u/PBFT thinks he can grab my nose. Sad! I'll probably sue him & win."
I also admit to this.
Most educated people were until we remembered he actually was on the ballot.
I always thought Trump was a nice joke until he started gaining popularity. I can't wait until he loses so I can go back to laughing at him.
I'm pretty sure a lot of people did.
He should have streamed his reaction to the whole debate, he was probably in tears.
I'm gonna miss you, Barry O.
Barack
Obama for Supreme Court Justice!
No. His unconstitutional executive orders are a pretty big strike against him. TBH I don't think he'd be a very good justice.
> unconstitutional executive orders TBD?
To be determined? He's been shot down by the courts.
He doesn't want to fuck with that, I'm sure. Probably wants the get the hell away for a few years and do speaking appearances. He's been a great president, but his ultimate greatest gift is his ability to inspire others with words.
Plot Twist: /u/therealpaulryan was talking about Michelle.
He wants to get into some serious sensual redistricting.
Realigning those electoral borders like it's nobody's business.
I'm still fired up!
Of course he did. We all laughed. In fact, the whole world is laughing. Especially Russia. We've been successfully humiliated on the world stage thanks to that buffoon. It appears that was Putins main goal more than anything and he achieved it.
Putin doesn't smile.
I cringed. Still haven't managed to watch the debates in their entirety. But I have read the transcripts. Trump seems to use some sort of cut-up technique like William S Burroughs or on occasion David Bowie. trump might not be in for The Presidency, but a Nobel Prize for Literature might be in reach.
His main goal was Trump as president but he'll take embarrassing us as a consolation prize.
I laughed when Obama laughed. There are my 6 degrees of separation.
no kevin bacon, sad/10
I worked alongside my University student government president, who worked as an Obama campaign director, who lists Kevin Bacon as an associate on LinkedIn. So I'm four degrees from Kevin Bacon on LinkedIn.

Immortan Trump
lol... sure is. 10 bucks says Trump takes it, too.
TIL Obama and I have something in common
He is only human, after all.
I have been laughing at Trump since he rode down the escalator to announce the beginning of his USA Comedy Tour !!
I mean... Who the hell didn't laugh? He embarrassed the shit out of himself. It was almost like watching an SNL skit.
Haven't we all.
SNL did such a number on Trump that I burst into laughter every time he said "wrong!"
I couldn't look at Baldwin's version of Trump's face without laughing.
Everyone laughs at trump during debates, even his supporters.
If you don't laugh at, "no puppet! no puppet!" you're dead inside.
No dead inside. No dead inside. You're dead inside.
The entire world laughs at the Rapist Cheetoh
really low effort, it bothers me that you think calling him a cheetoh is an insult of some kind...
Reddit really missed this joke. Have an upboat from me. Sad.
I see that you had no problem with rapist, just cheetoh
It's not an insult, but it triggered you so hard as to remark on how disappointed you are. I think that's why he used it, dudd.
But Rapist is totally on point.
Dude, it ain't a compliment.
No, its one of the lamest attempts at humor I have ever seen, really low effort
Wrong!
It's neither a joke nor an insult. Just a realistic description.
Nobody cares what you think.
> you think calling him a cheetoh is an insult of some kind It's still an insult *of some kind*.
The best low effort. The greatest. We're gonna build a wall 30 feet high around that effort. Just tremendous amounts of low effort here folks, I mean bigly low effort.
Sad!
Annnnd the bait has been set.
and everyone of trump's supporters here are chasing it.
In Obama's defense... thats pretty much the reason my friends and I watched. We already know we're voting for Clinton because JesusfuckingChrist Trump, but we can always use a good laugh and watching a man who looks like the Oompa Loompa who escaped from Willie Wonka's Factory verbally shitting into a microphone does that rather well.
The only reason I watched the debates was to laugh at trump. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MUUgz-pz3w I love how awkward he looks when he says correct, my brother was watching it with me and we were almost falling on the floor laughing. you're the puppet ilmao https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MUUgz-pz3w
you linked the same video twice
*leans in* Correct.
Thank you sir.
>"The President will spend a significant amount of time traveling next week in support of not just Secretary Clinton's presidential campaign, but Democrats further down the ballot, as well," he said. OK, it's early in the morning here, but this paragraph really confused me for a moment. I was like: "Wait, Obama is a time traveler?"
Well, a lot of libs don't know this, but Obama and his islamo-fascist cabal actually built a well working time machine with Soros^TM funding. That is how they went back in time to make sure he got born in Kenya but could place birth announcements in Hawaiian newspapers, create a Hawaiian birth certificate, and have witness. Stop listening to the MSM, they're all biased.
Yeah and who does he think he is, spending so much of it?!
Man of the people
C'mon....even his supporters laugh at him sometimes.
This will certainly trigger Trump and his crew.
Yeah, Trump has great comedic timing.
Such a nasty man. /s
can you blame the guy? trump is hard to NOT laugh at.
Admits makes it sound like a bad thing. It isn't. Bad title. Man admits to having a big dick. See how that sounds.
I did too.
https://youtu.be/e0nNeo2UwDQ
I wanted to laugh too, but I'm a PoC in an office full of Trump supporters.
Who didn't?
well why not? trump is a comedian after all. when he let out his zinger "I'm running for president" I laughed all day. :)
We all did.
What scares me is even after watching all 3 debates I still have almost no idea what Trump's actual policies are in any detail beyond one-liner hyperbolic rhetoric, half of which has been later retracted played down. I really think the moderators and question asking public should have pushed Trump to be more specific on actual policy details. Same goes for the media, we've all laughed at his stupid outbursts, but he should be pressed for policy detail. Right now he could still become President and no one has any idea what his policies will be!
More hard-hitting news from /r/politics ...
In other news laughing at Clinton is still sexist...
the pc police are gonna get me!!! tears here!!
......do we pull our dicks out now or are we supposed to wait?
It's just words folks it's just words. I've heard them many a time folks. And words are what they are, and that's words. I know words, I have the best words, but the only word I have for this is stupid. It's just stupid. This is the man who made America look foolish with Obama care and I have a plan... It's called MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN Thank you.
your sarcasm is safe with me.
Yeah, right, did Obama laugh when Hillary Clinton pretty much confirmed the authenticity of the Wikileaks emails during the last debate? No? Why not Mr. President, wasn't it funny?
"No puppet, no puppet.....you're the puppet!!"
What in the e-mails is so damning? Please provide a citation. Thanks.
Podestas Rissotto recipe
very disrespectful. Although I laugh too as a trump supporter. More can't stump trump plz. You're only allowed to laugh if you sub
Yup, that's about as coherent as I'd expect a Trump supporter to get.
wat?
Shhhhh. Dont provoke the zoo animals.
This right here is why we are we are. Both sides call the other side animals. I'm glad I don't really post here anymore. This place is smug right now and I can't see how they are proud of it.
You think the more humane thing would be to call mental health professionals for his supporters and an ambulance for Trump? How about this--how about mandatory community college for every American so that they don't ever fall again for such inane drivel? Hard not to be smug when a bunch of ignorant hysterics watch their idol dissolve like so much Alka Seltzer.
All of America laughs at Obama every day.
"nah uh. You are!" - dt
In all fairness I'm sure Trump laughed just as hard every time Bathhouse Barry tried to go just a tiny bit off-script from his teleprompter and hilariously never got much further than cringe-worthy, brain damage like stuttering and then panicking to find where he left off saying the words on the screen again.
"wrong."
Here's trump's full "comedy" speech at the al smith dinner: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNoQI8_J_gA Enjoy!
Who the fuck is Bathhouse Barry? Is this a new nickname for Obama that nobody's heard of and doesn't make any sense like the rest of them?
Google "Man's Country Bathhouse" I can't really blame you because I'm pretty sure DailyKos never brought up that hilarious place.
Why would they? Infowars wouldn't even discuss that shit. It's only ever shown up on Stormfront-associated blogs and 'news' sites, a group that only exists to try to convince everyone that the reason other races make them feel inadequate is totally not because of their tiny, almost non-existent dicks and complete inability to sexually satisfy anyone.
Deplorable's often try to hide how emasculated the President makes them feel by calling him gay.
Of course the corrupt laugh when they know they wont be punished for their crimes.
jesus, don't fall for it.
Yeah, I know. It really bothers me how Trump had gotten away with all his scams and corruption as well. Hopefully he'll be convicted soon, though. We can only hope, right?!
