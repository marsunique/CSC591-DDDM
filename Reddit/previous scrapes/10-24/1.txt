Great numbers so far, but please VOTE! This election is too important to sit out. And we have to send a loud and clear message to the major parties: We WON'T tolerate Trump's rhetoric in the future.
Why are we so willing to allow Clinton's ignorance of laws/rules though? I won't vote for her nor trump. I'll still vote but not for either of them.
There's crazy turnout all throughout the country, this might be a world record.
Doubtful for a world record. Belgium had 87% turnout in their last election; the US usually runs in the mid 50 percent range. But hopefully a record high for the US!
seems like it!! It's a historic election in a lot of ways.
World record for US voter turnout!
Everybody take this to heart. If Democrats of Utah can do it, there is no excuse anywhere else.
I can't believe people haven't voted yet. I voted back in January to get it out of the way.
I'm voting by Twitter (only allowed for Hillary voters!).
I voted today and almost posted a Facebook status saying "Just submitted all my ballots for Hillary! #ImWithHer" to troll all the Trump supporters I know.
Pshh, I voted 4 years ago.
And show up for non-presidential elections, too!
That's the really important bit. Voting doesn't stop being important on Nov 9th.
Hopefully Clinton or McMullin ends up taking Utah. Either would be a priceless slap in the face to Trump Republicans.
Something amazing I just realized a few minutes ago is that there's a chance that McMullin wins Utah, and there's also a chance that Hillary runs the board and wins every other state. Neither is particularly likely, but at the same time, neither is out of the realm of possibility. That would mean that if both were to happen, the Republicans **would place third in the election in terms of electoral votes.** Could you even imagine that being a viable possibility going into this election? It's not even some crazy, farfetched idea at this point. The whole country could go blue except for Utah, which goes… silver? I don't even know what color they'd assign. There are no safe red states for Trump at this point, everything is up for grabs. The thought of the Republicans placing third in this election fills me with such delight. Hell, let's get Gary Johnson New Mexico, and while we're at it, get a movement going to write Bernie in in Vermont so that he can grab a state too, and bump the Republicans down to fifth place.
There are some states that Hillary is not even in contention, so that won't happen.
Which ones? Everything I've seen seems to indicate that there are no safe states, but I'm glad to be proven wrong if you've seen/read something different.
[Wyoming, Oklahoma, West Virgina among several others.](http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/?ex_cid=rrpromo) they aren't big electoral vote hauls but much of the Deep South and other heavily red (and less educated) states are not in play.
I honestly think a McMullin victory would be just as bad, his stances aren't much better. He just happens to be a Mormon in Utah
It would be good in the context of the Republican Party going on a rapid decline, as well as the two-party system, is what I mean.
Now listen. I have hired the *very best* investigators. Ok, the *very best*. And they are looking into Utah. They are taking a look at Utah's papers. Look, I'm not sure what they'll find, but people are saying they aren't a state. I'm not saying it but some very smart people are. Ok? The American people deserve to know if Utah is a state.
Also a nod of appreciation to Mitt Romney for being one of the few Republicans to firmly stand up against Orangetan McPoongrab from the start. Despite our political differences, he's an honorable man.
I gained an ounce of respect for TedCruz for not caving too.... an ounce
I applaud Cruz' effort to advocate for child literacy by reading *Green Eggs & Ham* on the Senate floor. But...any chance of respect vanishes when you realize he's in favor of a Christian Theocracy. He's getting the boot along with all the rest of the Trumpslime.
and then he did cave, right before Trump took a nosedive. Almost felt bad for Cruz.
Cruz has had the worst timing possible. He named a VP pick right before his own campaign went under.

I hope this trend continues!
Once again Republicans managing to suppress the vote. But this time they're doing it to themselves.

The fact that you think the Trump campaign is that organized is cute :P
More democrats voting? how rigged.
So, 150 Democrats voted when they expected 100 Democrats? It's Utah, how many Democrats did they really expect? These "Dems voting early" stories are really stretching it. A lot of Dems voted early in 2014 too, and then they still lost.
1/3 more of 100 is 133.
These articles mean nothing until November 9th. All these articles are meant for are to excite the losing party's voters. In your exuberance, to post the fall of the Republican party, you're merely ding the GOP puppeteers work for them. you fell for it hook, line and sinker.
Keep in mind that Utah is a red state. I think that these articles excite the Democrats to go out and vote, because this time their votes actually matter since she's polling close to McMullin and Trump. Same about lA, AZ and even Texas.
Trump is telling people the vote is rigged, in turn causing his supporters to not vote. I guess they fell for it too.
