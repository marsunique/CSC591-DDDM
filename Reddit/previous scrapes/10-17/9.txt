[This is the kind of thing that gives me hope that despite how nasty this election has gotten, some people still remember how this shit is supposed to work.]
[Yeah... Let's pay the bills of the organization that passed HB2. Fuck trans people, who cares about them when my SENSE OF MORAL SUPERIORITY is at stake]
[Are you fucking kidding me? Trump is blaming democrats for this. He's calling them animals. We all know that's a huge dog whistle for black people. He's trying to justify poll intimidation. This fund raiser just calmed the right down, and took the wind out of Trump's sails for this line of attack. Super sorry your feelings were hurt, but we're trying to keep people from getting intimidated/ assaulted/ killed at the polls.]
[Nothing will calm the right down. The right harms actual people everyday. People of color, lgbt, etc. A few burnt pieces of wood is nothing compared to the damage the GOP already perpetrates.]
['Bills' is definitely the wrong word, and yours isn't a helpful tone.]
[Explain to me how this won't be used to pay the bills (construction costs, insurance, etc). Also explain to me why my angry tone is more important than the suffering of trans people.]
[So to be clear, you support terrorist attacks on the GOP. Liberal here: You can stop calling yourself a liberal now. Hand your L card the fuck in, and check yourself the fuck out of this conversation. Thanks. Edit: From their comment history, before it gets removed/erased: > Fucking liberals. The Republican party of North carolina sponsored HB2. Trans people are being oppressed. "let's pay them $13,000 to show how superior we are". Ridiculous. **Let the firebombers win.** Fuck the GOP. And fuck the liberals that pay their bills.]
[I haven't called myself liberal in years. And yes, I support acts of self-defense against a more violent entity. The violence the GOP commits on a daily basis is much more destructive than some crispy bricks on a building. The GOP harms actual people. People of color, gender minorities, lgbt, etc.]
[> I support acts of self-defense against a more violent entity. You support acts of terrorism. Say it: Acts of terrorism. Don't get all bold and then shrink from what you're actually egging on. Don't preach to me about the harms of the GOP agenda when what you're stirring up is the precursor to a civil war. Remember the Civil war? The greatest loss of American life in all of our history? You know, the war that pitted family members against each other? Literally the greatest American tragedy? Fuck outta here with that *noise*.]
[The war that resulted in the abolition of slavery? Yeah I support actions that have beneficial consequences.]
[Oh my god, you're actually serious. Tell me, exactly how do you see this *new* civil war going? What's it about? How's it end? What do we gain? You think that the political squabbling we're having now is even *remotely* similar to what led up to the Civil War? You haven't put one fucking second of thought into this, at all. A new Civil War is literally the end of America. Tell me, how do you think Trans people would fare under a new Confederacy? Go outside and think about your life.]
[Absolutely. Things have been getting so heated, it's nice to see a ray of goodness shine through.]
[Nice! Maybe Americans aren't so divided after all :)]
[In theory that's how it was meant to work. But everyone has different interpretations and beliefs.]
[>No matter the result, this is not how Americans resolve their differences. We talk, we argue, sometimes we march, and most of all we vote. We do not resort to violence by individuals or by mobs. So, let’s all pitch in, no matter what your party affiliation, in and get that office open again quickly.” This is how a country behaves!]
[Disgusting animals]
[Keep the change, ya filthy animals.]
[Deplorable.]
[If i was a billionaire, who had my campaign office get attacked, I'd have people there rebuilding it the next day out of pocket if needed. Then again, Trump may not have the money/care.]
[If it's and buts were candy and nuts we'd all have a merry Christmas.]
[He's so lacking in PR sense it boggles the mind]
[He also doesn't really see the GOP as his people after all, they are kind of at war right mow]
[To be fair, (and if I may be 5 for a moment), he started it.]
[Haha i see what you did there you sly bastard]
[While republicans play the blame game, Democrats work to actually fix it. Typical.]
[>While republicans play the blame game, Democrats work to actually fix it. The nc gop thanked trump and clinton equally, its not all republicans]
[I cannot imagine any circumstance where the reverse would happen.]
[If you have nothing nice to say]
[I mean he's right]
[Duno he sounds more left to me]
[Ecksdee nice meme so edgy i see what you did there ecksdee]
[You know, I definitely could. Keep in mind with all this rhetoric, 90% of the voters are still much more moderate than the media portrays them on either side.]
[We're having a good moment here, let's not ruin it.]
[Just goes to show that the radicals in any group do not represent the group as a whole... And reinforces that whole "horseshoe" theory that radicals have a more similar mindset than the more central members of a group. The nuts go for atrocious slurs and violence. The non-crazies use their words and are horrified by that behavior.]
[That's pretty dumb.]
[IT'S ALL A CONSPIRACY! CROOKED HILLARY DID THIS SO SHE STEP IN TO HELP AND LOOK GOOD!! HILLARY FOR PRISON 2015!! /s]
[BILL CLINTON IS A RAPIST! INFOWARS.COM! /s]
[A bit disappointing that they no longer accept donations.]
[Any breakdown of who actually donated? It may have been started by a Democrat, but how many donating were also Democrats?]
[Good guy dem party]
[Fucking liberals. The Republican party of North carolina sponsored HB2. Trans people are being oppressed. "let's pay them $13,000 to show how superior we are". Ridiculous. Let the firebombers win. Fuck the GOP. And fuck the liberals that pay their bills.]
[The fact that this story is raised on the top or /r/politics instead of the ACTUAL STORY, is really disgusting. Why not bring both side of the story instead of just this one. Jeez i wonder why...]
[Whoa, double check yourself there! The [main story](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/57t3b1/republican_hq_in_orange_county_firebombed/) has been on the tippy top of the page pretty much all day and currently sits at 5,758 points and 85% upvoted. Being an older post it is automatically sinking as all posts do. [The feel-good story](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/57vdhf/a_democratled_crowdfunding_campaign_raised_13000/) about the dem-led fundraiser is indeed a popular story but is at 3,099 points and 82% upvoted (and likely that percentage will drop a bit, as stories tend to do as they get "older"). So significantly less highlighted, despite this sub's very clear democratic lean. So yeah, not so disgusting upon closer examination. :)]
[The other story was on the top of the sub for most of the day.]
[It was on the front page when it happened.]
[[It's still on the hot page right now](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/57t3b1/republican_hq_in_orange_county_firebombed/)]
[r/politics must be happy for this news, they don't have to avoid for much longer reporting that 'black teens burn down GOP office']
[Aaand source.]
['Russians hacking US' source: Clinton aide thinks so]
