[To be fair, Bill Clinton may be biased on who he supports.]
[The headline should just read "the Bushes don't support Trump". It's no surprise that the three Democrats don't, and the two Republicans are from the same family. But this is a political ad, not a news story, so we get an even clickbaitier headline than most media outlets would tolerate.]
[Lol true]
[Prove it]
[To his credit, he has made it quite clear that just because he is married to Hillary, doesn't mean he isn't willing to consider other options.]
[And by the same token, it's no surprise there's no love from Bush Sr. / Jr. after Trump's evisceration of Jeb!.]
[And the criticism of George W. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4ThZcq1oJQ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=076HJcu-5lc]
[Just a tad]
[He was also a superdelegate, and I truly do not understand why that conflict of interest was allowed. Edit: I understand why he is a superdelegate in the first place, no problem there, and I firmly agree with a former president's capacity to judge presidential material. I've also been reminded that Bill supported Obama 2 months before the DNC in 2008, something I've forgotten as that was my first presidential election to participate in. Also, Hillary's margin over Bernie makes sense.]
[We both know it's because it's the right kind of conflict if interest]
[I'm afraid we don't.]
[He was also a super delegate that voted for Obama over his wife. I don't like the system but don't use examples that are so easily rebutted.]
[Then offer a rebuttal, I was looking for clarification to something that had vexed me and I had not had answered.]
[Bernie himself was a superdelegate. All House Reps, Senators, and Governors are superdelegates, as well as former Presidents. And considering basically every Presidential Nominee would be a member of one of those groups, it isn't really a problem. (Actually Hillary wasn't currently a Senator this year so she was not a superdelegate, but that is pretty rare).]
[Well, Bernie was also a superdelegate, so that kind of evens it out, but not really considering Hillary's connections to many many other superdelegates.]
[Wasn't he also a superdelegate in 2008, and supported Obama?]
[That's kind of sad if so.]
[I mean once Hillary dropped]
[He changed his vote once it was clear Obama would win the popular vote. Dem superdelegates always follow the popular vote. They only exist as a safety net against a potential monster like Donald Trump]
[They could never actually prove he put his dick in her. ]
[His vote mattered just as much as ours.]
[He's a former president. All the other former Democratic presidents and Vice presidents, as well as the the current ones were super delegates. But the vote didn't come down to super delegates. Hillary won the popular vote and enough of the other super delegates declared their support for Clinton. If it had come down to 1 vote I'd bet Bill would have abstained.]
[That's a fair point, had the margin been closer chances are it would've been a bigger issue.]
[I'm sure if it was even close to him being the literal tie breaker then maybe someone could possible give a shit.]
[Well, among other reasons, because it didn't matter in the slightest? I think the super delegate system is a bit silly but worrying about whether 1/2000th of the delegates are related to one of the candidates is a bit of small problem to be stressing over.]
[That's like saying 1 vote doesn't matter, and that's a message quite contrary to the spirit of popular elections. Now whether it really does matter or not is a separate question, but you get the point.]
[But it's not the same because that wasnt a 'popular election']
[I didn't say it's the same, I said the message that comes off might be taken as such.]
[The thing is that they are two different events, so it doesnt make sense to apply the message of one event to the other.]
[It doesn't make sense, yes. But when has this election made sense? Let's say, hypothetically, someone from the Republican side mentions Bill Clinton's super delegate status, and someone in the DNC says "it didn't matter in the slightest" as the parent comment said. It doesn't make sense to link those events, but you know for sure that that statement will be spun as hell into a message and soon you see Republicans claiming that the DNC said "one vote doesn't matter". That's what I'm talking about.]
[So you mean the spouses and children of President candidate must be banned from voting?]
[No, I'm saying maybe it was right that it was controversial when Bill Clinton was superdelegate.]
[How is it controversial? Bill Clinton is superdelegate because he was a President, it's not like the rule was made up prior to this election to specifically make him a new one.]
[It's controversial because it's a vote that was essentially given to one candidate from the start. You're right in saying that nothing was done to make that happen, but it's also true that nothing was done to prevent that from happening.]
[Like how he gave it to Obama in 08? o wait, you meant something else.]
[If being related to Hillary didn't keep him from being a voter in a primary, why should it keep him from having only slightly more influence as a super delegate? There are reasonable arguments for getting rid of super delegates altogether, but the system of super delegates is designed to favor candidates who have connections to the super delegates. The system is built to favor insiders as a means of keeping nutters like Trump from getting nominated. And honestly, watching what Trump is doing to the GOP, I'm OK with that.]
[Slightly more? It's like thousands of times more. Slightly would be like 10% not 40000x]
[Yeah, but it's 4000 x .00000000000000000000001. Still a vanishingly small amount of influence in the broader election. It's exceptionally hard to imagine a scenario in which the candidate's spouse casts the deciding vote.]
[Did all those superdelegates that announced their support for Hillary immediately after the first primary matter "in the slightest"? It wasn't just '1/2000th', an overwhelming number of superdelegates were tied to Hillary from the outset.]
[They picked hillary as she had worked for/with the DNC for 40 years. Bernie joined ONLY to be president. I love Bernie and was proud to vote for him. But it makse sense that all the superdelegates picked Hillary. Also, Hillary reached out to EVERY superdelegate within days of announcing her candidacy. APparently bernie hadn't even sent a letter asking for support halfway through the primary.]
[Sure, I am not questioning why the super delegates did what they did. They supported one of their own. My point is that such a system should not exist, or at the very least it should not have any means to affect voter mentality. If the Democrats want a fail-safe to prevent someone like Trump from becoming the delegate, fine. Instead, they had a means to create the perception of inevitability around Clinton. In essence, they abused the fail-safe.]
[Superdelegates came out in support of Howard Dean in 2004. Kerry overtook them. Superdelegates came out in support of Hillary in 2008. Obama overtook them.]
[And? That doesn't make their existence and interference with voter mindset any less deplorable.]
[They're there for a reason - so the Democratic Party doesn't end up with a Trump. They serve a real purpose.]
[Right- I just finished typing a response about how the Democrats can have a fail-safe to prevent such a thing from occurring. But they abused that fail-safe for their own benefit - meaning that either they should not have such a fail-safe since they can not be trusted or their fail-safe must be constructed such that it can not influence voter perception.]
[But the party ended up with a Trump anyway. Clinton is just as terrible a choice, she bought and bribed the party out.]
[Okay but we were just talking about Bill Clintons status not the entire system? And she won the popular vote too.]
[Right, and my comment was pointing not that it was not just a problem with Bill Clinton, the problem was endemic to the whole superdelegate roster. For fuck's sake, Raj Fernando was a superdelegate. And how much of that popular vote was influenced by the superdelegates making it seem like Clinton had an overwhelming lead? I am not saying Clinton could have lost if the superdelegates had not been reported, but ignoring the affects of a clearly stacked system is ridiculous.]
[She also allegedly did not win in states that have printed voting records.]
[The DNC is within its rights to nominate whomever it wants. The democratic voting part set forth by the constitution is what happens on Nov. 8.]
[Yeah? And everyone else is within their rights to be unhappy about it. Democrats are within their rights to want to change it.]
[So are you really advocating for **less** democracy? We should just accept what our DNC overlords tell us? That kind of thinking is just as un-American as what the Trump camp is doing.]
[I think they're arguing that if you want more democracy, trying to impose voting laws on private fundraising organizations is the wrong place to do it.]
[There is no rule that says more democracy is always better. There's a balance. Super Delegates are a pretty reasonable system, when you look at US history]
[Hahahah The DNC's job is to accomplish the political goals of its supporters. If a populist movement (as seen with McGovern, the whole reason they have superdelegates in the first place), threatens their ability to accomplish political goals, they should have a safeguard in place to protect the progress they've made IMO. If you don't like it then don't vote for the DNC lol the "DNC overlords" aren't making anyone do anything. How is it "un-American"? Lol]
[It's way worse than anything Trump is doing, that is totally subverting the democratic process. Republican's will probably be doing it next term though, but if anything Trump's run and current success is completely American and democratic.]
[The solution isn't to tell parties how to nominate candidates. The solution is to modify our party system so that people can demonstrate their dissatisfaction with internal party rules by bringing new parties into power, or at least threatening to.]
[Uh, what? That post makes no sense. Citizens can't tell parties, which are run by citizens, how they should operate? Instead, we should dismantle a party in the event is displeases the populace? Is it not just simpler to just have the party actually represent the will of the people?]
[> The DNC is within its rights to nominate whomever it wants. Just because that's the way it is doesn't make it right. No part of a democracy should have "democratic parts", everything should be democratic.]
[This is America. We are a constitutional, representative republic. Don't get your terms mixed up. Democracy is a secondary concern here to liberty and justice.]
[Lol well it's both. It's a constitutional republic *and* a representative democracy. I doubt most people would agree with democracy being a secondary concern.]
[Well, since its not all about democracy, what most people think isn't so important.]
[I would characterize Hillary and the DNC's behavior during the primary as neither respectful of liberty nor justice.]
[Well, since the DNC is a private organization not beholden to virtually any special laws, which is thus not expected to protect personal freedoms nor act in a just manner, it doesn't FUCKING matter.]
[This is a bad argument. Our country is not a true/direct democracy. There should be parts that are representative, because we have a representative democracy. If nominations were 'everything' democratic, we would have a direct nomination process that is burdensome, costly, redundant, and may lead to non-representative results. On the flipside, a pure representative democracy for nominations can lead to bias, unfair influence, and ignoring the will of the people. A balance is needed, and IMO the process with votes, caucuses, delegates, conventions, and super delegates, strikes a decent balance. Not perfect, but will do.]
[If we examine that argument, taken to its logical extreme, it becomes obvious why that doesn't work. Example: Me and two friends decide "let's pool our resources to try to get our buddy elected to the city council." Should you be able to show up, and say "wait wait wait, me and my THREE friends want to be part of your group too. But we think we should all vote on who we all support, since I want to support my buddy instead."? I don't think anyone would argue that that is a good or fair idea. But that's ultimately what you're advocating - the DNC is really just a bunch of people who pool their resources to try to get people they like elected. They are a private organization, and the only difference between them and my two friends (in theory) is scale. So the solution isn't to try to force them to change their private-club-rules. (Which would be a nightmare anyway - how would you justify making it only apply to them, but not ANY private organization?) The REAL problem is that with our current system, two private clubs (DNC, GOP) have a stranglehold on access to debates, meaning that basically any candidates besides theirs aren't viable. THAT is the part that needs to be fixed. Let them have whatever rules they want - it's their club, they can all agree to whatever, and there's no real moral justification for forcing them to do things the way you want instead of the way they want. Just fix the part downstream, where basically all viable candidates have to go through one of two clubs.]
[I've got some bad news about the judiciary, friend.]
[And they should do that and not mislead people like their decision matter. If the two parties would just bring their candidates without election, perhaps people would look more into 3rd parties.]
[I agree with that. The primaries contribute to the illusion of choice in America.]
[Probably because she wasn't the one who joined the party in 2016 in order to use their resources for a presidential run.]
[So? Are you stating that it is completely ok to stack the deck against a presidential hopeful? What happened to letting the primaries play out and may the best candidate win? Let's just forget democracy altogether then and accept whomever is appointed to us. I don't understand you guys that defend the DNC. They are one step away from becoming as disgusting as the Republicans, but you guys will defend them to the last.]
[Because for some reason a good portion of the people who supported Bernie can't accept the fact that he lost. It wasn't just the super delegates, he also lost the popular vote by about 3 million people. Should we just forget democracy and appoint whoever you liked? I liked Bernie as a candidate too and even went to one of his rallies, but I don't understand why so many of his supporters can't just move on and acknowledge that he wasn't the second coming of Jesus.]
[May I ask, if the Democratic party is so corrupt (and I'm not saying it isn't, I'm not registered with a party), why shouldn't Bernie have ran as an Independent? Should we trust a politician who will join a corrupt party just to further his own political interests, rather than starting a new party without those elements of corruption?]
[> why shouldn't Bernie have ran as an Independent? Are you fucking serious?]
[The Democrats used to be the party of the working people. they used to stand for something. Not anymore. In a two party system, I do not think it is at all justified to blame Bernie for choosing one to try and get his message out. While I agree that a new party should be formed to the left of Democrats, the Democrats would fight tooth and nail to prevent that from happening. Furthermore, I believe that Bernie, and many others, think the Democrats can be reformed by working on the inside. Time will tell if that can actually happen.]
["I'll vote for whoever wins" Bill clinton points to his 2008 vote towards Obama as proof.]
[How did he not get killed? /s]
[The constant boner keeps his blood pressure in check.]
[Well three are Democrats and the other two are related to Jeb Bush.]
[You're good at this!]
[Analysis complete. There really isn't more to be said.]
[Jeb! isn't running, though. It's not like they could endorse him instead.]
[Both Bush presidents were fairly moderate and not xenophobic racists. So that could also be a contributing factor]
[When it comes down to it, wouldn't you have say the Bush presidents put a lesser value on brown skinned Muslims, than white skinned Christians? In a much different way, of course. It's like Real Politics got swept aside along with the Soviets, as far as Republicans are concerned.]
[Ya you could make an argument for that, but if they are racists, at least they know how to keep it out of the public eye. Racism is more than just brown Muslims vs white christians though. I think that both of them likely valued American lives over those of the middle eastern factions they fought. Also, proxy war with Russia/geopolitical positioning being more important that both.]
[Here we go with your racist attacks you must be glad that Trump/Pence HQ was firebombed today. Trump is against illegal immigration and open borders. Hillary wants open borders and free trade pro TPP. Can you just respect having different views and positions instead of the usual leftist slogan that don't mean much and don't advance the conversation.]
[Easy killer. Everyone is abhorred by the firebombing attack. And I'm not voting for shillary either. But in fairness he is a racist and has done nothing to advance the conversation in this country.]
[Kanye disagrees.]
[They also started wars leading to the collapse of foreign nations so they've got that in common with Hillary as well.]
[Well, that is a convenient way to put that. If you're blaming presidents for starting wars, it would be that the Bushes have that in common with Obama. If we are assigning blame to the Secretary of State, then H. Clinton would have it in common with James Baker, Colin Powell, and Condoleezza Rice.]
[Good point! They do have a lot in common.]
[I can't tell if you're joking, but I haven't seen a racist quote from Trump]
[https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2016/06/07/politics/paul-ryan-donald-trump-racist-comment/index.html?client=safari Even Paul Ryan said he made racist comments.]
[I'd say Trump bashing Jeb and George W for months had more to do with it.]
[Trump probably would have bashed them less had they been more like him, so the two points are somewhat interlinked.]
[There can be more than one reason my friend.]
[And one reason can be more influential than the others.]
[Regan's kids say he wouldn't vote for Trump]
[Is that what this article is really saying?]
[It has nothing to do with them being related to Jeb though. They would have likely endorsed any of the other republican candidates had they become the nominees.]
[I'm sure that Donald trump insulting Jeb Bush has nothing to do with George Bush not wanting to vote for Donald Trump. Absolutely nothing.]
[They don't endorse him cause Trump is a fucking clown. Look at speeches that Trump gives and then look at the speech that GWB gave after 9/11. As much as I disliked GWB as president, he was a respectable human who didn't use attacks against another race/gender/religion solely for personal gain.]
[I think it has very little to do. Cruz endosed him after far worse. They're not endorsing because Trump isn't representative of the views they think Republicans are]
[Trump has insulted everyone.]
[Were you not paying attention in the republican primaries?]
[I was.]
[[Just watch a couple highlights from this one debate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Be-6viOoTsA). Then think about Trump's attacks on Jeb. "Low energy," "weak, " "He couldn't be elected dog catcher," "He goes by his first name because he's ashamed of his last name." Do you really think the Bush presidents are going to give him the thumbs up after all that?]
[I dunno. Trump embarrassed JEB! pretty badly.]
[To be fair they are also related to Billy Bush]
[I liketo believe that they chooseto forget this fact. Like for family gatherings, they send him an invitation for the wrong place and/or date.]
[The reason for that is so he doesn't bring a friend who grabs them by the bushie.]
[I just can't imagine how anyone could call themselves a nickname like Bushie. It belongs in /r/cringe]
[> and the other two are related to Jeb! Bush. FTFY]
[[Worth another watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O74XDI-o7xc&ab_channel=Nobullyplz)]
[out of the loop: why always the exclamation mark for Jeb! ?]
[[They added an exclamation point to his logo](http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2015/06/14/14-JEB.w1200.h630.1x.jpg) during his primary run when they realized how low energy he was.]
[That is too much energy for me.]
[please clap]
[If there was ever a moment when I felt bad for him, it was that. Must have truly been a low moment for him.]
[Get out of the car]
[What if they're not in a car? Do they have to get in a car, then get out of it?]
[Harsh. I mean, it wasn't the best FTFY but i don't think its bad enough to make him guac home.]

[I'm a Clinton supporter, but I don't think that Hillaryclinton.com is a reliable source to post here.]
[This is r/politics]
[But isn't that where she told us to go for fact checking? They couldn't possibly stretch the truth there.]
[Posts should be based on quality. Is there anything wrong with the quality of the information?]
[Posts aren't based on quality, they're upvoted based on message (pro-Trump -- downvote... Pro-Hillary.. upvote).]
[Anti Hillary posts get up voted a lot. Pro Trump posts really have no merit because there is little good in him]
[I challenge you to post one positive article about Trump that isn't trying to crucify somebody else to make him look better.]
[Sure thing: http://presidential-candidates.insidegov.com/compare/40-70/Hillary-Clinton-vs-Donald-Trump Trustworthy, economy, national defense. Those are the top issues on voters minds right now, and he comes ahead in all of them.]
[I would say it has everything to do with quality... Of the candidates]
[Do you recognize the difference in quality between Trump and Clinton?]
[All posts must be based on the appeal to moderation fallacy. If one thing is factually true, like a statement that all living presidents are opposed to one presidential candidate, then we have to pretend that it is equally balanced by another statement, like a guy with the word 'truth' in his user name offering literally no opposing evidence.]
[What's an example of a pro-Trump story?]
[Amy actual answer will be banned]
[You know what, go for it anyway. I'd be interesting to hear what qualifies as a pro-Trump story these days. Being banned doesn't cost anything.]
[He's not Hillary?]
[Shhhh you're going against the narrative]
[Uhhh. He helped Kevin McAllister find the lobby in Trump Hotel in home alone 2]
[[And then Kevin sold him out, the little shit.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U87GS2DsgNg)]
[He has great story, many story, but you folks will never heard of it because of liberal mediah. He will tell it sometimes, later, maybe after presidency.]
[I read this in a Russian accent.]
[Certainly its not, but neutrality goes out the window the closer to an election we get. It is what it is at this point. I'm at the point, and reached it long ago, where Trumps supporters don't have any arguments to offer me, I now view them as collective American awful that needs to die out for the benifit of the country. They've hitched their waggons to hatred so profound and up front that no excuses make a difference.]
[I agree, but we shit on Trump's campaign website so I kinda figured we could even it out a little bit. I mean never completely because fuck Breitbart and WikiLeaks, but still. Kinda figured that the campaign websites were a mutual no-fly zone.]
[A message from a political campaign shouldn't be posted on /r/politics?]
[It's neither news or discussion. I'm not sure it's the right thing to be posted here.]
[It's news or discussion as much as most of the posts here.]
[Whatever the source...its true.]
[Nobody reads the article anyway.]
[Long time members of the establishment and family friends of the the Clintons support a Clinton for president? stop the presses.]
[2 are related to someone who went against Trump and Trump was pretty harsh to him. One is the husband of the person running against trump, one is the political ally and possibly friend of the person running against trump and the last is one of the more liberal presidents we've ever had. So... uhh yeah its true but people citing it is kind of funny!]
[It doesn't matter, only Hillaryclinton.com would write an article with this title. If it was CNN with the same title, we would know that they believed it to be newsworthy, and that regardless of factuality, they're basing their well earned reputation on it. Should we upvote anything that is factually true? Why is there not an article every single morning titled "Clinton supported TPP but then flip flopped after she found out the public wasn't buying all the bullshit in it?" It is literally factually true after all, but it's also insanely biased. Regardless of the truth, Hillaryclinton.com is biased]

[[Got you covered bud](https://www.reddit.com)]
[HW Bush has privately said he's going to vote for Clinton, too.]
[If he said it privately, how do we know?]
[Because someone who heard him say it told the press. It was a moderately big news story a few weeks ago.]
[I don't know if I buy this but someone )I think a Kennedy?) said he told her he voting for Clinton]
[It's a pretty funny story, basically HW supposedly told someone in private that he was voting for Hillary which she then posted to Facebook, and his spokesperson had to go out and say he's not making any endorsements, and then the next day HW goes and tells a room of 50 or 100 people 'yea, im voting for Hillary'. Poor spokesperson guy.]

[Too many cats or dogs]
[unbiased at this stage isn't necessarily fair or desirable. If one person says 2 + 2 = 4 and another says 2 + 2 = 7, an unbiased observer is going to say the first person is right and the second is a damn fool.]
[...Which is still biased because the definition of mathematical objects is a subjective interpretation.]
[Unless otherwise specified or in highly unusual circumstances, the numeral representations always refer to the same exact numbers within the shared experience of human culture, and operands such as + and = always work the same way on the same numbers. It is not disingenious to assume that any random person will take two to be the number between one and three, or that 7 will signify a larger amount than 4, but it does strike me as the worst sort of pedantry to argue that in some undefined, undescribed theoretical system, purposefully incorrect examples could be sort of correct, therefor all of reality is either wrong or open to interpretation.]

[True, I was just honestly wondering if people on reddit regarded a particular sub as pretty unbiased.]
[I don't think so. r/neutralpolitics claims to be. Unfortunately people often mistake neutrality for objectivity. If one candidate says the sky is blue and the other says the sky is red, being neutral is kind of pointless there.]
[yah you can play devil's advocate but if someone's wrong, they're wrong.]
[Per the mods, campaign websites are allowed.]
[Are allowed now*]
[They've been allowed for a long time. Sanders' website was routinely posted back during the primary season (for example, [see here](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/4mqy6i/sanders_campaign_statement_on_puerto_rico_polling/) or [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/4maadg/but_when_it_comes_to_foreign_policy_we_cannot/)).]
[And also routinely taken down. And/or bitched/griped about by CTRs. *Now* it's acceptable, *naturally*]
[Well it makes sense honestly. Anybody with a brain knows Clinton's site is gonna be upvoted way more than Trump's.]
[Clinton owns a ton of websites]
[I know, right? It's amazing how much support Hillary gets on reddit. There are two posts from the_hillary on the front page right now. And even you mention Hilary in 9 out of 10 comments. All very lovingly of course.]
[You mean InfoWars.com?]
[Ha. Trump's connection to Jones is unfortunate. I'll never defend that.]
[That's cool.]
[Will you defend Trump advocating for murdering people for being related to terrorists? Because I have yet to hear any Trump stan account for that.]
[There already are plenty of people that have died for being related to terrorists. All those civilian casualties from drone strikes approved by the incumbent party? They just happened to be near terrorists. Unfortunately, it is the status quo. Trump isn't an exception. Just another President who will nod in the situation room and be told it's for the best.]
[Is there no difference between the unfortunate but incidental civilian casualties we see now and deliberate murder of people because of their presumed association with terrorists?]
[Neat. Trump didn't say "People dying in accessory to targeted killings of terrorists is acceptable to me." He said we should kill their family members. Gtfo with the false equivalency bullshit.]
["Unfortunate". Like Trump slipped in the tub and landed on Alex Jones's show for an exclusive interview. He wasn't looking both way when he crossed the street and happened to praise him at his rallies. I understand. These kinds of things just happen.]
[> slipped in the tub and landed on Alex Jones's show for an exclusive interview I hate when that happens. I bend down to pick up my dropped shampoo bottle and suddenly a red-faced dude is making [MGMT sounds](https://twitter.com/papapishu/status/783400998572351488) at me.]
[That's my jam!]
[I swear to you I thought about using that word. I just couldn't think of a better one. I mean it's ridiculous too. I'm just saying that Trump already has enough problems. It's unfortunate for him that he'd associate with Jones.]
[An Alex Jones listener is exactly the kind of audience that Trump has been courting from the very beginning, all the way back to the Birther crusade. It's not unfortunate. It's sweet karma coming to bite him in the ass.]
[Good point especially with the Birther conspiracy. Trump definitely caters to things like that. But I do stand by saying that *many* of his supporters follow him for other reasons (Republican, not Clinton, anti-establishment). But calling it karma is a great way to see it.]
[Please. There hasn't been an actual Republican in the Republican party since the movement conservatives kicked them out over a decade ago.]
[I mean the remaining presidents in fact don't support him. I don't think the source changes that.]
[Except that two are related to JEB and one is the husband of a candidate...]
[You can argue that this article doesn't mean anything I'm not going to disagree. Of course the democratic ones aren't going to support a republican and the bushes are moderates as well but I'm just saying the bare facts are correct. The meaning is up to you.]
[Dude, Jeb losing to Trump is not the reason why they aren't spring Trump. They endorsed Romney after he beat Jeb.]
[Trump is an outsider, they are the establishment of course they won't endorse him. He represents a threat to them. Are people that stupid to not see that? The Bush's and the Clintons are buddies. They're all one big fat party. This election is no longer republicans vs democrats, it's citizens vs corrupt establishment elites and big corps. All those presidents started wars that Hillary will continue, Trump won't because he can't be bought.]
[There are 5 living Ex-presidents. 3 are Democrats, so obviously they aren't going to endorse the Republican Canidate. So that leaves Bush Sr. and Bush Jr. Neither have endorsed anyone. So the source is true, and it doesn't take much effort to confirm it. The only truly important part though, is that the Bushes aren't supporting Trump. Obama, Clinton, and Carter endorsing Clinton is a forgone conclusion.]
[If Hillary Clinton gets elected, 24 of the last 32 years of this country have had the President be from 2 political dynasties.]
[I think that we should allow official campaign stuff because that's where official messages are. WHen Trump responds to allegations, he does it via twitter or his website. Hillary can do the same thigns. It's best to get the official source rather than a shitty blog that's rehosting quotes out of context.]
[HW bush said he is voting for Hillary, the first time in his life he will ever vote for a Democrat]
[One would think the endorsement of the Bush's for Mr Trump would also be a forgone conclusion but here we are.]
[Didnt Bush Sr say he wont vote Trump?]
[I'm not questioning the accuracy of the article, but rather the source. I guess I just worded my comment wrong, I just don't think that linking directly to campaign sites should be allowed. Just my opinion.]
[Ah. It's a fair opinion, as campaign sites by definition aren't neutral.]
[And Breitbart, HuffPo, WaPo, NYT, The Atlantic, Mother Jones, Vox, etc. are neutral? Ahahahah]
[No, but at least they are 3rd parties.]
[So the issue isn't neutrality, it's just for some reason better to read opinions published by "3rd parties" than the actual politicians they're writing on? Lmao]
[I don't think it's unreliable, just inappropriate. I know the rules allow posting campaign pages here, but they shouldn't; they're not news or discussion pieces. They belong in the comments, for discussing candidates positions on certain topics (in a theoretical, hypothetical, election based on policy). As one of the many, many people invested in watching Dolan crash and burn, I had to do a double take at seeing this right at the top posted by Ministry of Truth. There's self-aware irony, and then there's taking it a tad far.]
[Disallowing references to political campaign pages on a subreddit dedicated to politics seems a bit silly. We need to analyze and discuss direct press releases.]
[I don't know if its inappropriate, but circlejerking over propaganda is the status quo here.]
[How is this not considered a personal blog? Also why did the OP's account appear to be deleted now. Click his username. He's gone. Edit: Must have been a bug. The account shows now when I click. I think this post was removed though right? Appears to be gone from the front page now. Edit 2: Oh wtf. I accidentally hid it....it's still there lol. These mods suck.]
[That's weird, his account has been around for months too. *Just noticed there are two underscores between 'of' and 'truth', so it may not be the account I thought it was.]
[Well, I just reported this post for being a personal blog and it appears to be gone from the front of the sub now. I have to imagine others were reporting it too. Edit: Nvm it's still there...]
[> Also why did the OP's account appear to be deleted now. Click his username. He's gone. .......No one's account is gone?]
[Yea it's working now. I kept clicking it before and it would show up as if the account didn't exist.]
[If I had to guess, OP was reported a ton as a shill or something for using Hill's website, so the admins temporarily suspended it while looking into the allegations, found nothing wrong and reinstated it]
[Well his account was created solely to post 2 links to her website so... His first submission EVER hits #1 on /r/politics and is like 8th on /r/all right now? A bit suspicious to say the least.]
[Why do you think they deleted the account? I mean, on this sub? This very transparent and non-bias sub? Nothing unusual would ever happen. And I'm sure if these former presidents endorsed Trump this piece would still be up. Right?]
[OP's account is untouched breh did u even bother to check]
[Don't deleted accounts show as [deleted] though? You can still see his name, but nothing shows when you click]
[Typical behaviour of a troll tbh]
[It's not deleted and it does show his posts. maybe there was a bug earlier.]
[Oh yea it's working now.]
[As a 3rd party I can confirm 5 US presidents are alive.]
[Are they hanging out with Elvis right now?]
[Hrc has been unable to gain the confidence of any presidents except for just five living ones? SAD]
[As a reader of grocery store newspapers I can confirm that jfk and Lincoln are still alive. And Elvis. I'm pretty sure he'd support her too. And batboy. Definitely a Dem]
[Can confirm. Source: I learned to count in a private Catholic School.]
[1,2,3,abortion is a sin,4,5...]
[I support abortion. I don't have exact numbers but all the Catholics I know support a woman's choice as well. I do wish that the potential Father of a consensual conception had some say. I know I would be heartbroken if a potential child of mine was aborted.]
[Completely agree with this opinion. I don't understand why the left and right pull so far away from this stand. This seems the most sensible to me.]
[[deleted]]
[That's why I get the guy who works at the corner store to fix my car, I'm so sick of establishment mechanics telling me to replace my fan belt.]
[Stopping big mechanic from taking all the business]
[[deleted]]
[We don't see nearly enough non-establishment engineers.]
[So Trump will tell us that our fan belt is fine?]
[Nothing is fine in Trumpland. It's either the worst thing ever or the best thing ever.]
[No he'd tell us it needs to be fixed just like ISIS does. Then transition into saying that Clinton supported establishment mechanics all along, who are also the main supporters of Islamic extremism.]
["Clinton's been trying to fix this fan belt her entire adult life. She's had 30 years, why has she not fixed it already?"]
[I've heard he does like to grab under the hood to have a look.]
[But only on luxury and sports cars...]
[Specifically imports..]
[But not vintage.]
[It's funny how people can't see that being a politician is a profession just like anything else. Most people wouldn't think twice about this when looking for a doctor, mechanic, electrician, etc. but somehow they think being a politician is so easy that literally anyone can do it. There is a reason that most politicians are lawyers and spend many years working their way through the different levels of government before they go for a national level office.]
[While I think the world could do a lot better than many life long ideologues who become politicians, often without much experience to test their theories, the world can do a hell of a lot better than a spoiled inheritor with delusions of intelligence such as Trump.]
[That's why we need term limits on Congress. Americans didn't want another king so they made sure that the President couldn't stay in office forever, but they didn't apply the same rules to Congress. I can see the need for some continuity in legislation, I don't see why these guys should be allowed to sit there for 30+ years doing almost nothing or causing more harm than good. Give them 12 years or something then they can move on to a different position.]
[I think that all currently elected legislative positions should be filled by random lottery. Think about it like conscription, selected people will serve their time at the statehouse or congress and people will take the whole thing more seriously. And be more invested in their country. Sure it would have some negative tradeoffs but it would end the revolving door, gerrymandering wouldn't be a problem anymore, campaign contributions would cease to exist.]
[Negative tradeoffs, like randomly selecting people who have no freaking clue how to write legislation or negotiate?]
[How much legislation do you think is directly written by congress members ? There's no requirement that you be a lawyer or constitutional scholar to run for office anyway. Yes that's the main downside but I think you can staff out the literal legislative writing anyway.]
[Term limits are a terrible idea, they get rid of experienced legislator and empower lobbyists(especially in state legislators). You want action, remove some checks and balances. To start with remove thee filibuster. More radical proposals would include getting rid of the Senate or even removing a seperate executive branch and switching to a parliamentary system where head of largest coalition/party is Prime Minister. You want better fresher legislators restrict campaign finance and publicly fund elections. More extreme measures might include getting rid of individual districts and electing state wide by party lists.]
[Well, the people are the term limits for Congress as stated by the constitution.]
[There are many representatives who run unopposed, so how are the people supposed to get rid of those guys? It's not like they can cast negative votes. Also, since the majority party is able to redraw voting districts every 10 years, once they get in power they can make sure that they remain in power.]
[Term limits wouldn't do much to stop the uncontested races, though.]
[Yeah it would. If you hit your limit you have to retire, so someone else will be forced to step up or the state loses their representation.]
[California has term limits in its state legislature. In practice it's not such a fantastic idea. There's two big issues: one is that you never really have senior legislative members who have experience in brokering compromise. It's mostly just new guys and second termers who haven't really mastered the role yet. Another issue is that inexperienced congressmen lean heavily on their aides (who've been there and done this before) to figure out what they're supposed to be doing. When you legally mandate that the entire legislative body needs to be inexperienced, you end up creating a situation where some of the most powerful people in your legislature are staffers, and the actual elected officials kind of end up being figureheads.]
[If the term limit was set to say, 12 years which is 6 terms, then not everyone would be new every time. They wouldn't all be elected at the same time either so it would be staggered and you bridge across multiple Presidential terms. You would get a constant flow of new ideas that change with the times, instead of having 100 year old guys who have been doing nothing but warming a chair for 50 years. It'd be nice if they were actually required to work as well. Many representatives never author a single bill and some rarely even vote. They just sit there collecting a pay check and a pension while preventing someone else from getting elected who might actually do something.]
[Elected officials would also be dependent on lobbyists to learn the ropes in the legislature. Term limits would only hasten the rotating door between lobbyists, aides (who aren't paid much), and elected officials. Plus, we would see greater regulatory capture, since lobbyists would control the institutional knowledge in the legislature.]
[It's just like when I watch sport and I know what every coach should be doing.]
[Arm chair politicians!]
[All you gotta do is want it more than the other team and give 110%. Any good coach knows that.]
[They recognize that being the president actually isn't easy and that somebody with the lack of patience, inability to collaboratively work with other, inability to handle criticism or take advice, inability to deal with people contradicting him or just working against him for no reason, has no business being president]
[Because she would be in jail]
[Do you see how what you said doesn't actually follow from what I said]
[Hillary Clinton has the skill for a job a corrupt as the president of the United States. I'm mean just look at what she's done already!]
[An outright criminal has no business being president either]
[That would be either person]
[I'm not denying that. I'm saying that just because Trump is awful doesn't mean that we should give it to shillary]
[Alternative explanation: Their loyalties lie with the establishment, not their respective parties.]
[How is Trump not Establishment, he's a billionaire real estate mogul with investment all over he world]
[When people refer to the establishment they're talking about the political establishment.]
[But most people are also talking about the close knit nature between the most wealth and politicians.]
[part of me almost wants Trump to be (and fail) president so I dont have to constantly hear people say "the government is like a business let a businessman do it!" anymore]
[> him or her.]
["Lets go to war, we got to go get'm", who? "Sadam, he tried to kill my daddy" Patience is not their virtue.]
[I find it really hard to believe GWB had those qualities, or any presidential qualities whatsoever. Can someone change my mind?]
[the great thing about all of this is that no matter what, he is going to lose and there's nothing he can do about it]
[And all his insane supporters just see it as further proof that the establishment is out to get him. What's a self-fulfilling prophecy again?]
[The anti-Establishment narrative has always been idiotic. It's a manifestation of people's frustration at a system that doesn't seem to work for them, which is valid. But it's also a boogeyman that offers no actual solutions. You wouldn't find a surgeon base on lack of experience.]
[Funny, that's exactly what Jimmy Carter ran his campaign on. http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/05/what-nevertrump-can-learn-from-anybody-but-carter-213860]
[Yeah, and look how competent President Carter turned out to be... /s Don't get me wrong though, I respect him a ton for his post-Presidential work.]
[It's a crafty narrative and good reality-distorting messaging. The media are fakes and frauds, they are telling lies, look at these lies--- the thing is that's so rich coming from the one person who has held more sway over what the media talks about than anyone this year. The thing is, it's almost like he's so bad it *seems* like he's being painted by the media or taken down, so it almost reinforces his point right? You hear that much shit being said about someone.. there's no way one guy can *that* bad it must be a takedown job right? But no, no he really actually this despicable.]
[The point is Hillary is the establishment supported status quo candidate. If you think the country is doing great and you want Obama 2.0 then she's great for you. If you think the country is screwed, and we definitely are in part because of Republicans waging war and dropping taxes on the rich, and in part because of trade agreements that are supported by both parties because they help corporate donors, then you want a non status quo candidate. I think people are deluded in their thinking about how bad things are, because they can definitely get worse. Hillary is unlikely to make things worse in the short term. That doesn't change the fact that a lot of people want a non status quo candidate and will take whatever they can get.]
[Haha I know, it's been one of the most frustrating things about him, his campaign, and his-and this is tinged by my anecdotal experience of working with several Trumpy's-more extreme, stupid/gullible followers.]
[I'm not an extreme/gullible follower - I'm just a guy that lives in a blue state, that makes good money and is very well educated. So here's the thing - Wikileaks just dumped a LOAD of emails. They show actual proof that she did a lot of things wrong, and used her SofS office for giving favors to donors of the Clinton foundation. This isn't a crackpot conspiracy theory. It's in the Wall Street Journal: [http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-press-buries-hillary-clintons-sins-1476401308](http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-press-buries-hillary-clintons-sins-1476401308). We've now listened for a week the same trump tape from a decade ago and nothing has been on any of the media circuits about the WikiLeaks proof - that HRC hasn't even denied. She stole the Democratic Primary - and everyone knows it. I mean, how can anyone support this? So, are the Trump supporters all stupid/gullible? No. Just fed up. And so am I. I don't love Trump as a candidate; I don't drink the cool-aid, but I don't for a minute think that HRC has anyone's interest in mind other than her own, and the media is very clearly behind her. For anyone else, the WikiLeaks would have been front page news.]
[I've parused the items in the leaks. I don't see anything damning. Could you point to your sources, please?]
[have you actually, ya know, read those emails? They aren't damning]
[What's crazy is how much harder they could (should) have gone on him from the start. It seems like all sense of context has been lost some people. That's Donald Fucking Trump. This would be like the Dems having Whoopi Goldberg as a candidate; it's fucking fractured.]
[I think a more apt comparison would be Oprah]
[That's the thing though. At this point it really is a free-for-all, with the turning point being his little "important announcement". I think Donald Trump is absolutely someone worth taking down and this is most certainly a take down job of unprecedented proportion. Literally everyone is dogpiling on the guy. Again, I think he deserves every bit of it. But what if I didn't?]
[You know how when you go in for a job interview, they usually include one of your would-be peers as an interviewer, because they know what the job entails, which makes them uniquely qualified to determine whether you're qualified for the job? Here we have all five living presidents, including Republicans, issuing a vote of no confidence for Trump. If you were a hiring manager, and FIVE of your employees said the interviewee couldn't do the job, wouldn't you listen to them?]
[that's even worse you're saying the cronies don't like outsider cough sanders cough and will do what they can to prevent challenges to power]
[Do you think being president is easy? Like it's something that just who ever could do?]
[I'm a Green party person, and I know this is unpopular, but I think Reagan and George W were probably dumber than Trump. I think incredibly incapable people can hire smart people to advise them. That said I still despise Trump.]
[No way. I can't speak to Reagan, but Bush isn't stupid. He's definitely not very good at speaking, but the man wasn't stupid. I don't think he had amazing judgement and he probably let the personality of Cheney dominate the decision making process but like I don't like he was just there for the ride. Trump on the other hand I think is actually kind of stupid. He hasn't read a book in his adult life, when pressed on the most recent book he had read by Megyn Kelly he got all pissed off, and eventually said 'All Quiet on the Western Front' a book most people read in high school.. that's not exactly the trait of a person who thinks about the world]
[I hear what you are saying and it's definitely debatable who is dumber. However, in the brutal world of politics I would consider the word "smart" to mean getting what you want. Like it or not, Trump got to be the Republican nominee, because he outsmarted the other very smart Republican candidates. He got what he wanted, so is he really that dumb?]
[Everybody contradicts themselves, being the president is so hard, yet you don't actually have any real power, you're not CEO of the country etc. I think the test is if you can run a successful campaign to be president then yes you can be the president. Hate Trump all you want, but he is doing somethings right that a lot of other people aren't able to do. He may not win but if he did, I don't really see how any one that looks at the situation objectively can outright declare there is no way he would be able to do the job.]
[I think he seriously has personality deficits that would really make it a challenge. He's clearly not big on having people oppose him, imagine his reaction to a congress that just wouldn't play ball? Is he going to order investigations on every senators that speaks against him? You have real power, just not absolute power and your power is contingent on other people being willing to work with you.]
[I'm sure Clinton and Obama would have endorsed Sanders had he won the primary. He isn't the national embarassment that Trump has been. He's also been a politician for 30 years, so while he's not mainstream he isn't a complete wild card either.]
[Then why did the DNC collude against him]
[Because they saw her as the best chance to maintain Democratic control of the White House, which is true. It's really that simple. And if he had pulled off the miracle of winning the primary, it is 100% guaranteed the DNC would have thrown its full weight behind him in the general election.]
[How is that relevant? Yeah, the DNC wanted her to win, that doesn't mean that these ex-Presidents, or the Democratic party in general for that matter, wouldn't have supported Sanders if he won the nomination.]
[10 out of 10 dentists agree that he's a twat, and they can't even get together on the toothpaste thing.]
[First, the president has to deal with constant criticism from the other party and the media. In view of what we know about Trump's temperament, how do you think he would handle himself? Second, the president gets several daily briefings about all topics relevant to him, like the economy and national security. He or she has to digest an enormous amount of information. Given Trump's cerebral deficiencies, how do you think he would handle having to learn the equivalent of maybe 100 pages a day of new material, 7 days a week, for 4 years? Third, the president must have sound judgement. If the average person overcooks their bacon or gets into a car accident, someone may get wounded, or killed in an extreme scenario. If the president makes a mistake, thousands may die, or lose their jobs, or fall into poverty. The pressures are enormous. And when the president fails, the media and the other party harass you on it for a long time. Look how much shit Clinton got for Benghazi, when she wasn't even remotely responsible, and she wasn't the president. Now imagine if the operation to capture Bin Laden had failed and the Seals had been killed and OBL escaped alive. Imagine the firestorm that would have engulfed Obama. Now, imagine Trump in that position, someone with no self-control, the most powerful police/intelligence apparatus in the world at his command, and thousands of nukes. It's imperative in those situations that the president keeps a cool mind.]
[To add on to your second point, there's speculation that he doesn't use computers or email. At least not in the common usage. I saw an article recently that made the case that any digital documents or emails he receives are printed out for him to read on paper. Transferring that amount of information to physical copies would be inefficient, wasteful, and would be an all around organizational nightmare.]
[>thousands of nukes. I agree with everything you said, but I wish people would stop bringing up the nukes. No matter how batshit Trump is, and no matter how much of a petulant child he is, if he gets elected, he's not going to launch any nukes. Not only does he not have the authority to do that alone, even he knows it would ruin him financially, and I suspect that's more important to him than the entire country.]
[The POTUS actually does have nearly unilateral control of launching a nuke. At that stage of the game, a nuclear strike must be decisive and can't wait for committee. We all rely on the temperament and judgement of the president regarding nuclear launch codes. Additionally, he's come out publicly that he's pro nuclear proliferation, and refuses to take nukes off the table for settling conflicts. He has also questioned why we can't use them if we have them. The nuke thing should be a deal breaker straight off and the fact people, yourself included, downplay someone like Trump being involved in ANY part of a nuclear weapon is telling that you don't take this seriously.]
[Correct me if I'm wrong, but technically, POTUS does exercise sole nuclear authority. The SecDef must verify the order, but can't veto it.]
[It's true. I overcooked some bacon once, and five people died.]
[thanks obama]
[On top of all that, the president isn't the CEO of the country. There are two other branches of government that you have to contend with. In addition to the Democrats, he has also started a war with his own party. Really hard to get anything through Congress with that kind of animosity. Then he's going to have a certain number of his own supporters begin to turn against him as they discover he was full of shit and is unable to get Mexico to pay for a wall or to get their jobs back. There is no way he would be able to deal with it. He would have a meltdown of epic proportions and take the country down with him.]
[>He would have a meltdown of epic proportions and take the country down with him. His campaign is not even over and he's already having the most epic meltdown in the history of presidential campaigns, no other one comes close. Campaigns are tough, but since they are in essence a time of presenting visions, promises and rallies they are supposed to be in essence positive, smooth, optimistic affairs. If Obama's campaign was like a freshly baked apple pie, his is like an exploding shit sandwich drenched in radioactive sewage. Anyhow, governing is much more difficult - a time of tough decisions and a lot of criticism. Imagine how mad it would get if he somehow makes it in. I mean, his jaw-dropping disastrous campaign may yet be responsible for the end of the Republican party. If he gets in, his presidency could be reponsible for the end of democracy in the US - it's totally within the realm of possibility.]
[I honestly wouldn't be surprised if Trump bails last minute just to prove a point.]
[He would be probably impeached and replaced by Pence if he tried anything crazy like arresting political dissidents or something. Pence would do the GOP's bidding while being more mentally stable.]
[Yeah, the Ryan and McConnell have done a bang-up job standing up to him so far...]
[If Pence is still even the VP at the time. I'm assuming that once things start to go bad that Pence will be one of the first that Trump tries to get rid of. He'll make Pence the scapegoat for everything that goes wrong. Who knows who he'll find to fill the VP slot then. Maybe Ivanka.]
[President and Vice President can't be from the state. But then again, I'm not in Constitutional Law so maybe I'm just reading it wrong. I also don't you can be related to anyone you appoint to a cabinet position, else Jeb Bush would have been on GWs Cabinet. Also Congress and House have to approve of anyone the President appoints as VP if the one elected is replaced. Except in such cases as during an election.]
[Due to a quirk in the law, The President and Vice President can't RUN from the same state (Electors can't choose two people from the same state). But other then that there's no reason an "appointed" VP can't be from the same state.]
[I think Trump is going to have more than one constitutional crisis if he somehow ends up being president.]
[The first move a dictator does is trim his inner circle so he can remove anyone else who may vy for his position. Trump could try to displace Pence should he sense that he was gunning for him. The problem with this analogy to dictators though is that the US system does make it harder for someone to obtain absolute power. Still, a scary thought.]
[Pence may have made a bad decision, but I still think he is smarter than Trump.]
[He's also a total religious nut.]
[I like to think so, but the fact he tied his political future to Donald fucking Trump tells me otherwise.]
[I'd say ideological wise he is very dense, but I could see him thinking he could put Trump on a leash and lead from behind in a Dick Cheney sort of way, that would be an honest mistake.]
[Remember, Trump offered Kasich the VP job and promised to let him do all the hard stuff. It wouldn't surprise me if Pence had the same offer. The problem with Trump is that his deals aren't worth the paper they're written on. Pence would do the day-to-day work until Trump randomly made a decision on a random topic that would counter-mand Pence's ideas.]
[I'm less convinced of that, I tried to research it after South Park's "foreign and domestic policy" line and I couldn't find any hard evidence that the deal was offered. There was a report of a rumor of Trump Jr. offering this role to Kasich's staff but both parties denied it, as far as I can tell. Do you have hard proof of it?]
[He allegedly offered Kasich control over foreign and domestic policy, while he would be in charge of "making America great again". Which is just absurd]
[A mysterious man named john Barron]
[Donald will definitely try to fill Ivanka's slot. Wait...]
[Vice President Ivanka would be wise to be careful with the Donald...he may try to backdoor her.]
[LOL **hillaryclinton.com** , for the few real redditors left in this sub, I hope this makes you realize how dumb this sub is. Mods don't even try to hide it anymore. Everyone in reddit is laughing at you people, seriously.]
[Interesting that the account who posted this "ministry of truth" doesn't exist anymore. I guess if you post a thread that doesn't succeed in record correcting, you need to nuke your account and try to make a new one.]
[not sure why you think it doesn't exist, I can see the account just fine]
[to the trump faithful, this is a good story, it feeds into their narrative of the past 20-30 years]
[Though I imagine it would probably mean something to some or even many undecideds and independents.]
[The narrative invented by Roger Ailes. http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/07/roger-ailes-fox-donald-trump-2016-conservatism-214076]
[I've told my dad about this (pretty centrist, almost libertarian like, voted Democrat for as long as I can remember), and his response was something along the lines of: "Yeah, exactly! They all want the same old shit, Trump's gonna shake things up!" He was supporting Bernie with me during the primaries, but he just hates Hillary a lot.]
[>Yeah, exactly! They all want the same old shit, Trump's gonna shake things up If Trump wanted to shake things up, he wouldn't have elected a run of the mill religious conservative for a VP. Nothing says mad gadfly like trying to get a Reagan wannabee to be your wingman.]
[ANTI. ESTABLISHMENT.]
[The irony. These t party types became the Lil trumpers. They didn't start going ape shit until a black man was president, even though the shit they rallied against was rampant if not the product of the Bush years ( whom they voted for. Twice) - rampant illegal immigration, ballooning government, runaway spending...]
[And the Trump faithful will vote for him no matter what. Who cares? Trump has been appealing to the same 35-40% of the country since the primaries and hasn't for a second shown the ability to court more than that.]
[Except the bits where he overtook hillary even on RCP overall polls? Does it get exhausting constantly lying on the internet? I'm curious.]
[Remind me when his favorability went noticeably over 40. I'll wait]
[Thats some nice shifting of the goal posts there pal. Your initial statement is 100% false.]
[Lol someone is watching too much CNN. See you in a few weeks]
[*16% of the country. It's only 35-40% of likely voters who support him, which is only a tiny chunk of the country at large.]
[Sup]
[Inf]
[holy shit]
[If the first Bush had given his endorsement they would be praising him to high heaven, reminding people he was the vice-president of messiah Reagan, talk about his ultra macho heroism during the second world war, how he kicked Saddam Hussein's ass in a few days and that this president is a true high energy alpha male. They are a reflection of the mentality of the Donald - anybody that praises him, even if the praise is minimal, gets praised by them to high heaven, no matter if the person is a liberal or a serial killer. Anyone that criticizes the Donald, their past is immediately scrutinized and they come up with anything they perceive as negatives to bring them down. If Mandela were alive and criticized Trump, they would be posting photos of him: "Let's all do our part and make this the first result when you search 'Convicted Terrorist'. If Jesus Christ came back and criticized Trump, they would be carping about how they don't need advice from low energy messiahs that get themselves crucified, SAD! Also, he's a Jew. If the prophet Muhammad came back and praised Trump, they would rave about this nimble navigator messiah, a true alpha male who banged loads of girls (HIGH ENERGY!) and conquered much territory, leading to the establishment of what is now the fastest growing religion in the world. MAGA!]
[to be fair if people are voting for trump are against the establishment then 5 former presidents is probably a plus for them not endorsing trump or anything]
[I can stand Trump either, but is hillaryclinton.com actually considered an unbias source?]
[Yeah, it is now. It's the hip place to go to when you want to fact check Donald Trump.]
[Lol, is this sub linking directly to Hillaryclinton.com now?]
[Is the politics sub linking directly to a politician's website?]
[As a European, I think linking to one of the candidates websites directly can be seen as biased.]
[IMHO you don't have to be a European to think that. Source: I think that too.]
[You may be surprised to learn that /r/politics is, in fact, heavily biased towards Hillary Clinton and the majority of the moderators are in all likelihood actually employed by Hillary's campaign. Which is, naturally, why you'll see nothing but pro-Hillary and anti-Trump posts on the front page. Isn't U.S. politics fun?]
[Hillary sucks, but this is proof enough that politics mods aren't employed by her: http://web.archive.org/web/20160114135431/http://www.reddit.com/r/politics]
[As I understand it, the majority of the mods on the subreddit have accounts that are under a year old. Reddit was definitely caught up with Bernie fever at the beginning of the year, but it seems fishy to me how quickly and how violently pro-Hillary this sub turned after he conceded. If in fact a large number of the mods have only been on Reddit under a year, I'd be inclined to think they were planted there in anticipation of a Hillary nomination.]
[That's pretty insightful actually]
[It used to link directly to DonaldTrump.com.]
[There was a period of about a month after Bernie got roasted that this place was pro Donald. After that, this sub has been nothing but pro Hillary articles. And Im a happy neutral Canadian. This sub is fucked.]
[It also linked to Hillaryclinton.com when it decried Pepe as a racist meme]
[So /r/politics accepts HillaryClinton.com links but doesn't allow Wikileak links??]
[[removed]]
[That's... awfully disturbing wording. Would did you think of the firebombing at the Repbulican HQ in Orange County?]
[it's disturbing that trump is dancing to putin's tune. he's a sellout, narcissist, incompetent boor and traitor. i think the firebombing was a false flag; if not, it was unfortunate but understandable. hopefully they find who did it.]
[Hillary said it was a great site for fact checking!]
[Not just great but unbiased as well! Why would you ever go anywhere else for news?]
[This is how it's been for a good while now. I only come here anymore because I enjoy commenting. /r/politics is worse than watching CNN.]
[Nah I think watching the Trump sub is worse.]
[Not at all, it's a support sub.]
[This sub went from 99% Hillary-hate to 99% Hillary-support in 2 months. How exactly can you defend this shithole? I am embarrassed to use reddit anymore, because there will never be a middleground. People don't understand that you can be against Hillary AND against Trump - at least the majority here doesn't. The hivemind destroyed reddit as a platform for discussion and created a place where everyone has to stay in their designated subreddits to not be banned/downvoted/talked shit about. I always say this: I am not an American so I mainly follow the election for entertainment purposes, but the influence this election has on my favorite website is bad as fuck - that's why I care. Edit: and of course the mods here are biased... almost every subreddits has biased mods. You shouldn't let people mod this subreddit without getting paid by someone, because they will look for someone that pays then at some point. Guess some of them found the Hillary campaign for that... bending the rules to explain the deletion of good posts, just because they aren't anti-trump etc. isn't that hard, even if there are people in your modteam that aren't diehard Hillary fans.]
[/r/the_donald is aware of its bias. It literally exists for it.]

[yes]

[Just to be clear, these are the same five living US presidents that were significantly responsible in getting the world to the state it is in today, correct?]
[hmm, yes that does seem to be a correct statement.]
[HillaryClinton.com Does anyone even take this sub seriously anymore...Unsubscribed, hopefully a new politics sub will emerge that allows discussion and opposing points of view]
[r/NeutralPolitics It's pretty nice there. Would definitely recommend]
[Is it particularly active? I'd like to move away from this sub but I don't want my front page even more stagnant than it's already been.]
[DonaldTrump.com used to frequently make to the front back why /r/The_Donald was still allowed to brigade.]
[It's a pretty fact]
[If you find any, please let me know. I'm stuck in political limbo as well]
[That sub, low energy, need a defibrillator to get her out of bed in the morning. I'd rather vote for anything other than that cripple POS establishment hack. GTFO!!!]
[What is the opposing point of view to this issue?]
[Pssst, don't expect logic from them.]
[I assume his argument isn't so much about whether the information is correct so much as that the sub is entirely okay with linking directly to a politician's website as a reliable source of information. And, also, there's the fact that /r/politics, by-and-large, seems to have such an incredible bias towards Hillary that anything even remotely critical of her will be buried.]
[Disclaimer, I don't agree with the following point of view, but these are the opposing argument: Of course Trump isn't going to be supported by someone who was once at the head of the American political system, because he's an outsider and Clinton isn't. Not being supported by the presidents who (not my view) fucked the country is a good thing, not a bad one.]
[These five completely obvious real estate investors and personal friends of trump support trump]
[They meant that all but pro Clinton posts get removed]
[Your post is still here.]
[That's called a comment, not a post That's right downvote me little bitch ]
[Do pro-Trump articles exist?]
[I don't think the Sanders folks ever even had the audacity to link directly to his website like this. How is that allowed? Some crap pop up comes up when you click the site saying "are you voting for Hillary" or some shit. Isn't this technically a personal blog? It's not a legitimate news source.]
[You were subscribed!? That's the real shock. I thought everyone just drifted here from /r/all. This sub is kind of like Degrassi Jr. High uncomfortable and painfully awkward, but just can't resist watching.]
[Pretty sure /r/politics is a default, which means every new user is automatically subscribed.]
[I unsubscribed, too, but it popped up in /r/all. I'm flabbergasted at the 180 change on this sub in the last few months. It's also kind of disturbing that no one is talking about the podesta emails on /r/politics, or at least it seems that way. But, sure, post straight from Clinton's website... Nothing shady going on here...]
[they allow announcements from Trump's website too...]
[Wow, Bill's got some large hands. Presidentially large hands.]

[The same strong hands that put cigars into interns' pussies might I add]
[this sub is a fucking joke]
[There are two living Russian presidents. Both are support Donald Trump. Surely friends we can agree this is count for something.]
[Can someone explain to me how Hillary wanting to make enemies of the Russians like we're still in the Cold War is better than wanting to be allies?]
[Can you give me a source? I'm pretty sure Putin supports him, but I can't find anything on Medvedev. I suppose there's also Gorbachev still, I don't think he's commented on anything.]
[Gorbachev has stated that Hillary has on done everything he and Reagan created together and that the world is now closer to a nuclear war than ever before. Google it. That is, if you follow politics or anything.]
[Gorbachev has said that American triumphalism is leading to rising tensions between Russia and the west, which is a statement I don't entirely agree with, but you know, neither of us have a neutral point-of-view in this, and it risks a game of "you started" "you started" that's entirely beside the point. I haven't been able to find a single quote where he mentions her, and I've looked through several news articles. I fear you might be getting mixed up with some op-eds that tied the two together, which I don't think is justified. If you disagree, please give me a source. It's the very least you can do to substantiate your claim. >That is, if you follow politics or anything. Why? Don't you?]

[The establishment from both parties opposes Trump. Is this supposed to be surprising?]
[I'm pretty sure that Bill is secretly a Trump supporter.]
[Honestly, I just think Bill doesn't want to be in the spotlight for another 4 years. It sure seems like he'd rather stay under the radar and keep "dickin bimbos," as Colin Powell would say. Besides, he's already been a president, I doubt he wants to deal with all the "ugliest first lady ever" jokes that will inevitably come.]
[They both hang out in the same locker room.]
[They have their disagreements. Trump, for instance, prefers to use his bare hand, while Bill likes to use a fine cigar.]

[Bob Dole endorses Bob Dole. That's what Bob Dole says when Bob Dole is talking about Bob Dole.]

[Reagan's kids are voting for Hillary, I believe.]
[Michael pulled his endorsement.]
[Yeah that's my impression as well. It's interesting, for the Trump crowd this could all be indicative of politics as usual, exactly what they don't like, when really it's a plea for sanity by the people in the know of how politics and presidency works.]
[Yeah, I can get that. Thing is, I agree with them that we need to revamp the entire political approach. I just disagree that putting a maniac in charge is the right way to do it. If anything, it forces people back to the mainstream. It's counter-productive. If we have to go with Establishment again, I can think of nobody more qualified than Hillary.]
[Absolutely man, don't really want to say this but that's why I was in the Bernie camp. Specifics aside, Democrat establishment does include incremental change. It's no ones favorite aspect of government, but between congress and the limited role of president, incremental (meaning slow but decisive) change is what we must rely on often.]
[Yeah. It really bums me out that Bernie is so old, I'd like to see him in 8 years. Hillary has an incredible record and she already lost the primaries once. I felt that supporting him was legitimizing his perspective, and I never had a problem with the idea that I'd support her in the general. I think she'll be better at handling congress than Bernie would have been. I really hope there's a mandate and she continues to work closely with Sanders and Warren.]
[They're all old, I do appreciate the DNC absorbing some of his platform although they could have went much farther, and even in some non-malignent ways. There was one DNC platform hearing where they refused to redact the word "god" from the platform. It's simple stuff like that I would appreciate they take a second glance at. It's not important to action, but it's important to ideal. Also I'm not so sure she will be better than Bernie with congress. He's notorious for being a reasonable man in formulating bills with across-the-aisle opponents. She's divisive unfortunately. But fortunately she's also an excellent policy writer and justifier, so with a Dem congress, yeah she can definitely make her case, otherwise she'll be as fucked as Obama on his 2nd term. All said, you're right, she better keep working with Warren and Sanders. I strongly believe that there is some amazing and strong overlap between progressive democrats and the current state of the GOP. Not overlap in values, but bridges between policies. After all, we need to represent and listen to America, not just our own views.]
[> He's notorious for being a reasonable man in formulating bills with across-the-aisle opponents. She's divisive unfortunately. Publicly, she's a divisive figure whom Republicans usually love to rail against (though they're taking a break because of Trump).

[Dubya is the big winner of the 2016 presidential cycle. He went from "worst President ever" to "in hindsight, could have been a lot worse."]
[Not really. Trump's candidacy has moved from a joke to a farcical tragedy, but he was never a serious contender for the office. W is still the leading candidate for "worst president in the last 80 years" and I guess a strong contender for "worst ever." Trump doesn't change that.]
[I think Harry Truman wasn't all that great either. But both were products of their time, and it's very hard to compare the two.]
[Dubya wasn't the worst president ever, he was just the worst president we had since before the Great Depression. He's in the bottom ten presidents, and possibly the bottom five. Taylor, Fillmore, Pierce, and Buchanan are all seen as bad presidents because they were part of the leadup to the Civil War; Buchanan was the worst of the lot and oversaw the start of it. Andrew Johnson was right after the Civil War and failed to really deal with the South appropriately. Tyler was ineffectual and got in constant fights with Congress and generally failed to get any sort of agenda pushed forward. He thought he was the boss, and Congress disagreed. And of course, Teapot Dome Harding had an almost comically corrupt administration, did little of value, and then died. Oh, and there's William Henry Harrison, who sometimes gets considered as being a bad president because he literally did nothing due to dying after a month in office.]
[I think Herbert Hoover was a bad president. I wasn't alive, but it seems he didn't care much about the people. Stock Market crashed due to his presidency.]
[William Henry Harrison should be in the middle of the list. He had no time to be good or bad. He's like the free space at the center of the bingo card.]
[Well, that depends. If the average president is a net plus for the country, then he'd be down pretty low, because he did nothing for the country. Some rankings just exclude him on the basis of "he was barely president so we can't really reasonably rank him".]
[Fair enough; if anything he should be at the dividing line between good and bad - or as you said, excluded.]
[GWB: "Thank you GOP constituency for putting up a candidate who makes me look like a genius."]
[> Did I say those words? *chuckles*]
[People who are voting for Donald Trump don't care. There is literally no one who can talk them out of it. Their world is on fire and the only man who can save them is the Celebrity Apprentice.]
[Is the same somehow not true for Clinton? It's already been pretty clear that she is decidedly corrupt and even though the writing was on the wall for years in a variety of ways, it's not being backed up with direct actual evidence and people are still supporting her.]
[Both candidates are fucked. Hard to blame anyone that US politics is such a joke]
["Come fire me Donald!! Melt my faaaaaaace!!"]
[Wouldn't want to break the American tradition of voting for whomever a former president told us to.]
[Treason, destruction of evidence, racketeering, pay for play; the greatest political corruption ever seen is unfolding before our eyes and needs to be stopped.]
[Absolutely agree, we need to stop Trump.]
[Have you heard of Richard Nixon?]
[Yup, he was loosely connected to Watergate. He may or may not have ordered it, the proof was never definite [deleted tapes, does that ring a bell?] However, we do have proof of Clinton's campaign (not necessarily her, persay) at the same level of corruption, and yet no one cares.]
[I actually completely agree you yet I still think she'd a better leader than Trump.]
[Sure thing, 45 minute old account.]
[Loosely, LOL. Nixon's voice is on tape ordering the obstruction of the investigation of the break-in, and he is also on tape repeatedly ordering a different break-in (of the Brookings Institute) that would have been equally illegal. Whether Nixon specifically ordered Watergate is a question that seems unimportant when one understands that Nixon had made it so routine for his men to commit such crimes that he either forgot if he'd specifically approved that particular break-in or his men reasonably believed that such a break-in was not exceptional among the sorts of things Nixon had wanted done. Clinton revelations such as the email about a public position vs. a private position are nothing compared to [Nixon's "zilch" memo](http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/documents/national/read-nixons-zilch-note-scrawled-on-a-1972-top-secret-memo-to-henry-kissinger/1768/), where he wrote that 10 years of bombing in Vietnam had been ineffective (achieving "zilch"), contradicting what he said on television around the same time ("very, very effective"). Knowing Nixon knew of bombing's military ineffectiveness suggests the bombing he continued beyond that was not to advance the war but to advance his myth of the war to help his reelection. [And there's so much more.](http://host.madison.com/ct/news/opinion/column/woodward-and-bernstein-nixon-s-crimes-were-worse-than-we/article_c9664e56-b3f8-11e1-bc67-0019bb2963f4.html) Rather than compare Clinton's paranoia to Nixon's, it seems much more relevant to compare Trump's vindictiveness to Nixon's, because that's the impulse that drove Nixon to abuse his power, to get even and politically destroy his enemies.]
[Please provide said proof. And I do mean proof.]
[* per se Had Nixon been "loosely" connected with Watergate, he wouldn't have been impeached and removed from the White House.]
[Nixon resigned. Trump would burn this country to the ground before stepping down.]
[I was talking about Clinton, note the downvotes.]
[Inaccurately, yes. Hence the downvotes.]
[Are you suggesting that the wikileaks were forged or inaccurate in some way?]
[LOL what are "the Wikileaks?" Wikileaks is a website. Have you even read any of those documents? They're less interesting than the gossip at an octogenarian weekly bridge game.]
[As opposed to Hillary whose first act as president would be to walk up and directly poke Putin in the eye with a nuclear walking stick?]
[I'll poke you with my nuclear stick. (   )]
[Long post incoming: I got into a petty spat with someone on Facebook in the comments section of a status update (stupid, stupid, stupid me). Attempts to convince him of Trump's horrendous character flaws came down to this: **Me**: I understand you don't like Hilary Clinton. I am not exactly her biggest fan either, especially when it comes to certain elements of her policy and decision making. Particularly her belief that the ones who can theoretically "fix" Wall Street are the very people who are entrenched there, her center-right hawkish foreign policy, and how her campaign managed to steamroll over others in the primary with total alacrity this year... But my original request of you still stands: talk to the women in your life and ask them in an open and honest way about the nature of sexual harassment, assault, and rape from their perspective. Sit down with your wife, sister, aunt, mother, sister in law, the women you might know from your church, your neighbor, or anyone else in your close circle of friends and have an honest discussion--not a debate--about their experiences as a women living through the varying degrees of this very problem that brought this whole dialogue to bear. My friend, no matter where you stand on immigration, employment, taxation, government size, energy policy, climate change, foreign policy or any of the other palpable and important issues that we as a country face today, I urge you to recognize that, in this instance, what Donald Trump did and said transcends the typical policy points that crop up every election: this is a man who thinks it is okay to kiss, fondle and grope women without their consent. Would you want to work for a man like this? Share a meal with him? Let your sons view him as a role model for their behavior? These are important questions that we ask of everyone we meet in one form or another, and I believe they are just as important when we elect our leaders, especially for the most important office in our country. All the best to you and yours. **His response**: You seem like an honest and sincere person which I think is admirable in this day and age. Truly. I've had conversations like the ones you mention above and will continue to do so. Assault, sexual or otherwise, goes against every fabric of my being. So while I don't condone Trump's remarks (quite frankly, they're disgusting) I don't see much evidence to suggest he's had issues with sexual assault in the past. Juxtapose that against "The Clinton's" for a moment and maybe you can see my point. It's ok with me if you disagree, but as a rational person, I see this as a carefully crafted "October Surprise" for the purposes of winning an election. It's that simple... They did the same thing to John McCain (who I didn't vote for) two cycles ago regarding a supposed affair. Mitt Romney's (didn't vote for either) was his 47% comment being secretly taped and released. That said... Honestly. I can't wait to vote FOR Trump and not just against Hillary based on policy... The "against" part in reference to Hillary is too easy... If you believe in "good and evil", Hillary and her ilk represent, to me, the worst kind of evil imaginable... Those who seek to control people while demonstrating no control over themselves. Have a great weekend.]
[Sexual harassment obviously is bad, to base your entire vote on that and somehow support Clinton when there are way more issues and she isn't even in any way somehow going against sexual harassment is very foolish. She supports Saudi Arabia and Islamic regimes that torture dissenters and suppress women on a grand scale.]
[Button, button, Patton, hot button, a jerk reaction, button, button, button. That's your argument. What it all boils down to is that people are tired of being played like keys on a piano. The Republicans do it too, with their hot-button issues of abortion, Jesus, Jesus, and tax cuts and economic mumbo-jumbo that resonates with the uneducated. This election is brexit comma it's at the establishment, and it's fast becoming a referendum on the media and the candidates that are viewed to be pumped and shilled I'm going to have a hard time this November. And looking at the source for this post, I think it's going to be pretty obvious which candidate that's going to be. Frankly I am predicting a landslide. And I'm Canadian. I don't even have a horse in this stupid race.]
[Patton?]
[Which is just fine with me. He won't gather independents or undecideds at a significant proportion and fail on 11/28]
[God I hope someone complains that no one let them vote for Trump on November 28th and that proves the election is rigged.]
[Don't worry, Donnie will have the perfect excuse. Trump: What do you mean the dead aren't allowed to vote? I'm sure I would have been very popular, like have a lot of support with my ideals back in the good old days, back when people listened to strong leaders like me. I consider myself a very strong leader one that will make this country great again. If you don't allow all of America to vote, all of it and all its citizens who are people tired of crooked politicians much like I am, if they can't vote, then is it truly an election well I would say no, it's not an election because not everyone can vote. If the dead can't vote, you should know, that's unconstitutional and when I'm president, I'll make sure to make sure that they can because they deserve a voice. They were good people with traditional American values and you want to deny them a chance to make an impact on this great nation. Why, I bet democrats 150 years ago would have been smart enough to vote for me!]
[Probably would have if you look at the past of the Democratic party.]
[That was the joke.]
[why would they care that an outsider is not getting support from politicians much less former presidents? Its either more of the same or wanting actual change to them.]
[He's the master, not the apprentice]
[If Donald Trump has taught America anything this cycle, it's that he sorely lacks the character and intellect to be an apprentice, let alone a master, of anything except failure.]
[Celebrity Master. Good title.]
[Speaking of, seems like the only apprentice to support him Omarosa and she is batshit crazy. The rest were either [sexually harassed by him](http://theslot.jezebel.com/former-apprentice-contestant-summer-zervos-says-donald-1787809076) or think he's ["a wack job"](http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/reality-tv/news/a798009/penn-jillette-donald-trump-celebrity-apprentice-secrets/). What's he a master of exactly?]
[For the record, one of them is clearly a bit more biased than the rest]
[Another reason to vote Trump, it's not like US has been doing great. If Hillary wins, we Europeans win as well, she will absolutely destroy US economy by sending American jobs all over the world, recruit top European talent instead of investing in American education to produce talent, and get rid of the immigration plague in Europe by taking all these "refugees" Hillary will do great with the world, by selling out America, that's why I lean heavily toward Trump, he just wants to make his country great again, nothing wrong with that.]
[You do realize that European leaders and citizens are [overwhelmingly in support of Secretary Clinton](https://today.yougov.com/news/2016/03/31/europe-would-elect-hillary-clinton-landslide/), right?]
[That's what I wrote. Most of us Europeans are supporting her because we know our economy will grow, our terrorist refugees will be sent to US, we will sell all of our services to US and increase our jobs to satisfy the American demand. But just to be clear, I'm European and I'm not in her favour.]
[Is reddit even trying anymore? What's going on here, are you guys under siege? Is this your way of sending an SOS, or are we just having hillaryclinton.com as THE top post on the sub?]
[>hillaryclinton.com Now that's a completely reliable, unbiased source to post on what should be neutral ground (it's not).]
[3 of them had/have close family members who are running/ran against him. the other 2 are Democrats. No shit.]
[2 are Republicans.]
[The other two would have likely endorsed any republican candidate running other than Trump.]
[Stick to the narrative dude.]
[Something something Establishment.]
[The only one I really liked was Obama.]
[I'd rank them, from best to worst: * Clinton * Bush Sr. * Obama * Carter * Bush Jr. Possibly Carter/Obama reversed. Clinton and Bush Sr. were both steady hands who fixed the budget, saw the US through the end of the Cold War and the post-Cold War era, managed to generally do a good job and not fuck shit up, and set up for a massive decrease in crime rates. Obama has had few major accomplishments and almost all of them have been tainted in some way. Obamacare was a mess, both in terms of its rollout and loss of single payer; he didn't shut down Guantanamo; he has failed to control spiraling health care costs; he has had his executive orders found unconstitutional (with good reason); the housing market is still kind of a mess... Moreover, his failure to deal with Syria proactively, combined with the collapse of Iraq after pulling out, does reflect poorly on him. Likewise, his inability to curb Russian ambitions in Ukraine. And he has continued to illegally spy on Americans. Carter failed in many of the same ways; he struggled internationally, with his foreign policy not ending up all that effective, and the USSR gained a lot of power while Iran had its government overthrown and became very unfriendly to us. Carter had a poor relationship with Congress - even Congressional Democrats - and was seen as trying to tell people what to do and expect them to fall into lock-step with him. He was poor at advancing his legislative agenda. In all fairness, some of this was also blowback from Watergate and demands for increased transparency, but some of it was really due to Carter himself. His administration of federal agencies was poor. A lot of bad stuff also happened while he was president, which isn't exactly his fault, but he didn't really end up rising to the occasion, either. And Dubya... well, I think most people are familiar with his long record of disasters. Cutting taxes while increasing spending, going to war with Iraq, failing to stop 9/11, failing to respond adequetely to Katrina, having no real coherent plan for fixing Iraq or Afghanistan, pulling people from regulating financial stuff, his tax cuts and lack of oversight contributing to the huge housing bubble and subsequent crash, torturing people, imprisoning people illegally, illegally spying on Americans... Really, the only thing he did well was TARP.]
[I'd agree with those rankings, but I would also take into account that both Clinton and Bush Sr started their presidency when we were in a pretty good spot.]
[Bush Sr. and Clinton both had to deal with large budget deficits left for them by Reagan; Bush had to raise taxes to try and balance things out, and then Clinton cut entitlement spending to fix the other half. They also both had to deal with the ridiculous crime wave of the time; people forget that crime was twice as high in the early 1990s as it was today, and both pushed for additional police officers and longer prison sentences to try and deal with that (and to their credit, crime fell considerably by the end of Clinton's presidency, though only part of that can be demonstrably linked to their policies). They were both pretty effective at getting things they needed to get done, done, even while a bunch of other shit went on. Bush prosecuted the First Gulf War very successfully, while Clinton managed to navigate the Balkan crisis successfully and help bring Eastern Europe into the Western fold. It is true that shit wasn't totally fucked when they took office, but they did a pretty good job with what they had. Conversely, Dubya came into office with stuff in pretty good shape (really, better shape than either of his predecessors) and managed to make a mess of things.]
[Every President goes to work on day one expecting to Execustive Order the shut down of Guantanamo Bay. But the first briefing they get about who or what's actually there, and what they actually do, stops it. We as the public may never know.]
[Actually, Obama wanted to shut it down even while in office. He just did so very ineptly and alienated people in the process. There's no reason to keep it open. They could just put them in prison in the US.]
[What are you talking about? He has been working on it the entire time he's been in office and drastically reduced the number of people held there to just 60-some. The trouble now is finding a place in the US that they can be relocated to. No one wants them in their state.]
[> almost all of them have been tainted in some way. I think you have to give him credit for the ridiculous amount of obstructionism and delegitimization he faced though. > failing to stop 9/11 That's a bit harsh..]
[Obama has been obstructed, but he also did a poor job of governing even in his first two years when he had a Democratic majority. > That's a bit harsh.. National security is one of the areas the President has the most control over. He didn't stop it and failed to catch the man responsible for it.]
[Republicans were filibustering like crazy when they were in the minority.]
[The Democrats could have dealt with it. They failed to do so. In fact, the Democrats contributed to it.]
[They could have dealt with the Republicans refusing to show up and vote? How exactly?]
[I wonder who Michelle is voting for.]
[He's very likeable.]
[Carter's a good guy.]
[Good guy, absolutely awful president. When he carried his own bags into the white house, he lost 100% of his image and power.]
[Carter is a good guy, but he wasn't a very good president.]
[Carter is an amazing man. During the depressing Bush years I read a couple of his books and it was like a ray of hope in a dark time.]
[Not the best president unfortunately. He was ahead of his time by about 100 years.]
[His post POTUS career is inspiring.]
[POsTUS? Sorry.]
[You shouldn't be sorry. You should be revered.]
[Carter was an excellent human being, one of the best to ever serve in the White House. Fair-to-middling President.]
[He got a bad draw on 'events' like the oil shock and hostage crisis, and raising of interest rates to tame inflation.]
[Imagine if he'd gotten Bill Clinton's term to work with, or even Reagan's second term. He'd have been an entirely different president.]
[That last one I don't get. They were effective and they were a huge reason we bounced back in the early 80s. It's like "When you operated on my cancer, you took one of my lungs!" "Well, yes sir, but the cancer had metastasized to almost the entire lung. If we didn't do so, it would have spread to the rest of your body" 10 years later. "Looks good. It appears the cancer has not returned." "You know what else hasn't returned? My fucking lung, you worthless doctor!"]
[A cancer analogy towards a cancer survivor seems like poor taste.]
[I think it's the contrary in this case. It's defending his position in office with a similar battle in his personal life.]
[Carter had the chemo treatments; Reagan got the "you're free of cancer again" diagnosis. Just bad timing.]
[>Carter was an excellent human being He's not dead yet!]
[Does he want to get on the cart?]
[[No.](http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2015/12/jimmy-carter-beats-back-cancer/419028/)]
[I disagree with most of his politics, but HW Bush was a decent president and even better ex-President. Highly qualified and killed his odds of winning 1992 for the good of the country by putting up new taxes when the country needed it.]
[The source of this is DIRECTLY from Hillarys website. Yall fuckers arent even trying to hide it anymore are you? You all should be fucking ashamed of yourselves.]
[If the information were wrong, you'd have a point. Since it's not, why are you so angry about what domain name it's coming from?]
[Every time Trump tweets it makes the front page of /r/politics. So what Hillary uses her website instead? Don't be a pussy.]
[No.. it doesn't? The only time trump tweets hit the front page of /r/politics is when they are trying to bash something he's said. Go find me ONE trump tweet thats highly upvoted on this subreddit that isn't mocking it. Seriously can you guys stop lying? I'm skimming through comments and the sheer amount of complete bullshit lies from some of you is staggering.]
[Details...]
[You're kidding right? Link me to ONE FUCKING POSITIVE TRUMP POST that made it to the front page this week]
[Wait so you're telling me tweets can be posted here? Because the other day my buddy tried posting a wiki leaks tweet against Hillary and it was removed. Don't pretend there's no bias here, because there is and if you can't see that I truly feel sorry for you.]
[Actually I've got a bad cold so I will take that condescending faux pity just this once. ;-) "bias bias bias!" - that's the political equivalent of a baby crying. Everything and everything is biased. You are too. Realizing that is called being an adult. What? You trust the cherry-leaks by Russian psych-ops operations more? You see the story where the Ruskies got caught altering documents before disseminating them? You're getting in a huff about basic political mindfuckery that goes on all the time anyway, and comes from all sides.]
[Well reality does tend to have an anti-Trump bias. So there's that.]
[Which president supports Trump? If I may ask...]
[The president of my lacrosse team]
[Uh.. I think those are usually called captain.]
[Really, /r/politics, you're literally linking to Hillary's blog now?]
[Where were you when direct link's to Donald Trump's press releases were posted?]
[Are you surprised? it's been like this for a year.]
[I hate trump but I'm laughing at everyone who is trying to defend linking Hillary's website. This is from the same sub that used to call for a release of the emails, but now deletes any posts of it. WTF happened? Shame ]
[The reason I'm voting for trump, laugh!]
[Why would they, they are all in the buddy club.]
[Weird. 3 of them are democrats, and two of them had a relative running in the race (who lost). I find this to be shocking. Not to mention that of the democratic presidents, one of them is MARRIED to Hillary.]
[Hillary Clinton's own website used as a source? This shit is allowed here? Fuck off.]
[Read the whole article. Honestly, it's disappointing that this is what r/politics has come to. I was expecting some informing article, but the link is just pure Hillary propaganda. Sure enough, it's on hillaryclinton.com, like seriously? I'm not much of a right-winger but this is ridiculous, we need a new politics sub.]
[And the exact reason my vote is for Trump. Thanks politics!]
[How is that even an argument? If you get 5 people in a room, and 4 of them shoot themselves in the foot, does this mean it's a good idea for the remaining person to do the same?]
[The Republican nominees won't support him either except Bob Dole.]
[so boner pills cause brain damage?]
[Good, fuck the establishment.]
[Because it is an oligarchy........]
[Screw you whale and screw you clinton .]
[I think it may be because he's an interruption of politics as usual. I think they fear him more because he doesn't work for the establishment. I'm not a supporter of trump, but I'm probably going to vote for him because I want the system to break.]
[Lmfao. Straight from HillaryClinton.com . This sub is a joke now.]
[*hillaryclinton.com* *submitted by Ministry_of_Truth* Come the fuck on r/Politics.]
[I like Nick Offerman's /r/showerthoughts that "If Hillary Clinton wins in 2016, it'll be the first time two presidents have had sex with each other"]
[Let me guess... Obama, Bush, clinton, bush, and carter. Obama, Clinton and carter are all democrat; not to mention, clinton's wife is running against trump. And then trump humiliated jeb in the primaries so it's pretty understandable that the bushes would not support him. I'm no trump supporter, not to the slightest, but this seems pretty non-newsworthy. Like, no shit none of these ex-presidents support trump.]
[something something ESTABLISHMENT]
[/r/politics everyone. Gather around, the most unbiased subreddit...]
[How out of place does that soldier holding HW's wheelchair feel?]
[at least four of them are terrorists who deserve to be tried for war crimes TBH (maybe carter too but my mind isn't coming up with anything at the moment-- feel free to suggest)]
[r/politics, in proud collaboration with hillaryclinton.com !! I'm not voting for Trump - but this sub is so incredibly biased, I'll never forget this time, Reddit, when you pushed an agenda on your users (or let a major default sub be overrun - whichever it is).]
[Lol literally a link from Clinton's website, are you even trying to hide your bias anymore?]
[Well I've hated every president except Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln and Reagan! So obviously this only furthers my support of Trump!! /s]
[Reagan kids say he would have nothing to do with Trump.]
[I actually don't think they'd even be Jefferson or Lincoln fans.]
[I could see Jefferson, but certainly not Lincoln.]
[They'll trot out Lincoln if they get accused of racism.]
[The political establishment sticks together - completely expected behavior.]
[I have you tagged "/r/theredpill poster and moron" for something but I'm not surprised I see you here now. Oh and it's in teal.]
[Sane people also seem to stick together. Kinda stuck-up like that.]
[The Fraternal Order of Police, the nation's largest police union, endorsed Trump. Does that mean they're all sane because they stuck together in their endorsement of Trump?]
[Probs trump would give them more power and money to do what they want?]
[I'm sure that's exactly what it means.]
[Yeah that's called an Oligarchy, genius. If America elects Hillary it will mean that between 1989 and 2020 only 8 out of the 31 years was the White House not run by 2 families - Clinton & Bush. But as she has been Secretary of State, it means a presence there for 31 years! #OLIGARCHY Lets keep America's control between a war mongering Family, a money hording corrupt family that takes money from nations that execute homosexuals and maybe even a family that took advantage of Tax laws in the US. Shit, they tried to get Jeb Bush in this election, God knows what war we would have started next. Keep drinking the koolaid though r/politics. When Hill Dog becomes the next president and WW3 happens with Russia I will either be out of the country in a safe place or in a storm bunker/fallout shelter depending on where I am at the time as long as I am at one of my many properties in America and as someone with a very large estate I wont be forced to be involved with a war unless I want to be. Yeah, money and lawyers go a long way. Yeah, it's nice to be a multi-millionaire and not have to deal with America's petty bullshit that you people on internet constantly bicker and "keyboard warrior" battle each other over all fucking day. You people are petty as fuck.]
[As opposed to giving it to Trump whose credentials are essentially "i was born into a good family" as for the rest of your comment - interesting the kinda nutjobs that come out during the elections.]
[1 of them is Trump's opposer's spouse, our current president had her as his secretary of state, the bushes are establishment/corporate puppets. What do you expect?]
[Really, none of the five support him? I would have thought Trumps comment about being able to shoot someone without losing support from his base would have at least won over Dick Cheney.]
[*hillaryclinton.com*]
[The front page will be packed with this and other Brock propaganda by November. Just go with it. Or you know what.]
[So are you saying that the master of media is just a emperor that is naked?]
[And also that a vast majority prove regularly to believe that emperor to be clothed.]
[Ive also heard they believe small hands me a larger than average penis.]
[Any issue with the arguments or content? This should be based on quality, not source. It certainly seems relevant that no one who has done the actual job is willing to speak up for Trump. Feel free to explain why it is not.]
[The title of the article is 100% correct, but the assertion that "not a single one of them believes Donald Trump has what it takes to be our next Commander-in-Chief" is not entirely fair. Three of them are Democrats (including Hillary's husband), so it goes without saying that they wouldn't support Trump. The other two are very closely related to the man who was initially favoured to win but was repeatedly insulted and demeaned by Trump into an embarrassing defeat.]
[There's zero evidence out there that any Bush thinks Trump actually has what it takes to be president. The assertion is fair. That's why plenty of former Republican officials who have worked for Reagan, HW Bush, and W (who don't care what Trump did to Jeb) have come out against Trump.]
[I agree on quality over source too. But go ahead and submit an article from a conservative website and let me know how that goes for you]
[Some things from the federalist and NRO make it up. But Brietbart and Daily Caller are mostly shitposts. I don't expect anything thoughtful from them.]
[don't brietbart and daily caller actively post really racist stuff too? hard to take them seriously]
[Yeah, I'm not a fan of that, either. Not sure we should be linking directly to campaign sites. Still doesn't change the facts of the article, tho.]
[Bernie's website hit the front page of /r/politics fairly frequently. I'd say posting releases from directly from a campaign be it Bernie, Hillary or Trump is fair game.]
[Trumps website is allowed. As is breitbart which is blatant trump garbage. What's your problem]
[Let's see - 3 are democrats and the remaining 2 vacation with one of those 3, the one who happens to be the husband of the nominee running against Trump. In other words, **no shit**. > hillaryclinton.com Thanks for that though, great source.]
[Also, think about the two Bush's watching [Trump criticising George W Bush ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKxleL4Nzec) and [humiliating Jeb Bush](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7OrdQldrKU). They're obviously not going to support the guy.]
[Yeah, we don't need to steenking facts!]
[- Carter is a hardcore liberal and a Democrat, so that's not surprising. - Bush Sr had his son humiliated by Trump in the debates, so that's not surprising. - Bill Clinton is a Democrat who is literally married to the opposition, so that's not surprising. - Bush Jr had his brother humiliated by Trump in the debates, so that's not surprising. - Obama is a Democrat who appointed Hillary as Secretary of State and doesn't want Obamacare to be repealed, so that's not surprising.]
[> Bush Sr had his son humiliated by Trump in the debates, so that's not surprising. Quite the opposite. Jeb's stature has only grown in my eyes. The only one Trump embarrassed was his self as he debased America and our political process. Bush Sr is worried about this country not his son's feelings.]
[It's great how the bottom comment on this subreddit is consistently the most reasonable.]
[* Trump is a garbage person with thin skin, a feeble mind, and an impotent micro penis. So that's not surprising.]
[I reported this comment and selected the "revealing personal information" subsection. Absolutely had to. Poor Trump.]
[Not an argument.]
[Yeah, but he's not *wrong...*]
[None of the points you listed were any better constructed than his "not argument".]
[Really? None of them? Three of the living Presidents being in the opposing party is "not an argument" as to why they're not supporting Trump? I thought all of OP's points were good.]
[I agree, they're the easy to digest reasons for each. They're not at all incorrect, especially the Democrat ones. The Republican pair was lazy in my opinion, but to brush off the comment that essentially said Trump was unfit for the position as "not an argument" was why I commented. It was needlessly inflammatory, but both users were basing it on little more than conjecture.]
[It is not conjecture to say Donald has thin skin and a feeble mind. I cannot speak to the size of his penis.]
[I'd ask the 13 year old girl he raped]
[> Bush Sr had his son humiliated by Trump in the debates, so that's not surprising. HAHAHAHAH! Oh man, that's funny. Trump humiliated the Republican party and this country in the debates, not really Jeb. Jeb lost because of the basket of rabid deplorables who vote in primarys in the same force they do in general elections. Jeb would have been 10x the candidate Trump is and I'm a Dem who hated Bush 2 in office but has grown to see him as a reasonable person given todays GOP.]
[> humiliated by Trump in the debates, so that's not surprising. No surprise that a Trump supporter thinks former presidents are just as shallow, petty, and thin-skinned as their god emperor.]
[Jeb! failed to endorse Trump after signing a pledge that he would endorse the GOP nominee. That indicates to me that he is indeed as shallow and petty as Trump supposedly is. I assume that Jeb! also encouraged his father and brother not to endorse Trump.]
[Jeb! isn't a former president. > he is indeed as shallow and petty as Trump supposedly is. I assume that Jeb! also encouraged his father and brother not to endorse Trump. My point exactly. It couldn't possibly be that Trump is dangerously unqualified to be president and would provide no net benefit to anyone, regardless of political ideology, nooo.]
[And those are the most hated and ridiculed presidents in modern history. To this day, many of their decisions and policies are to blame for our current situation. No wonder they are voting for hilary. Not to mention, one of these guys is married to hilary, his vote doesn't count here.]
[Obama has a 54% approval rating...]
[Isn't that the entire point?]
[Clinton is out of touch with Trump's movement. She generalized half of them as deplorable so it's not surprising.]
[She immediately walked back the estimate of half, but a bunch of people I follow on twitter are constantly told "too bad the holocaust missed so many" or whatever by people who tweet a lot of pro-trump stuff. There are a huge number of terrible people supporting him.]
[Our beloved Reagan wouldn't have supported Trump either]
[Some sources say he did not like walls and even gave a speech on it. Edit: I'm hearing]
[hosted on hillarys website.... couldn't possibly be biased...]
[Simple Facts can't be biased.... 5 living Presidents. None support Trump. There's no way to spin that.]
[Simple facts can't be biased... Three of these Presidents are Democrats. So right there it's pretty biased to mention 5 presidents not supporting him, because obviously the democrat presidents wouldn't be supporting him anyway. The other two presidents are both related to Jeb Bush. Pretty sure they'd have a hard time lending their support to Trump after watching Trump trash and humiliate their son/brother for 6 months in the primaries. Also gotta take into account the fact that Trump criticized George W Bush heavily throughout the primary run.]
[It's obvious that the three Democrats don't support the Republican but not for the two Republicans to support the Republican? Your logic breaks down there, which is the entire point.]
[No, your point was that simple facts can't be biased. This headline is very biased and misleading as, again, three of the presidents are in the opposing party. It was a pretty unusual situation for Trump to have bashed the former president of his own party the way he did. I really couldn't see George W Bush throwing his support in for Trump after hearing all of Trump's direct criticism. And Bush senior isn't going to support him either after listening to the guy bashing his two sons for months. This is obvious, yes. The title of this article, however, is very misleading.]
[If the title was 3 out of the last 5 Presidents then maybe you'd have something there. It's not, and your just making excuses to make it bias. It's not. No living President supports him, and you can come up with a million reasons as to why. It doesn't matter. What exactly did Trump say about Jen that was worse than what Clinton said about Obama in 2007? Somehow they were able to make up and endorse each other.]
[I'm not making excuses. The implication of the title is that because there are 5 he should at least be getting one. This is misleading because right off the bat you have 3 that are virtually ineligible, and the other two have quite a bit of personal beef with Trump. With Obama/Clinton, neither had been President. Trump, however, has been heavily criticizing George W Bush's presidency throughout his campaign, accusing him of lying about WMDs, blaming him for getting us into a war that we shouldn't have started. George W couldn't possibly turn around and say he's endorsing him without validating Trump's criticism. And then you add to this the fact that Trump [utterly humiliated Jeb Bush](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Be-6viOoTsA) in the primaries, routinely called Jeb a weak candidate, low energy, he called him an embarrassment to his family, said things like "I wouldn't hire him" and "he couldn't get a job outside of politics." I mean, you have to keep in mind that these people are all related to each other. George HW Bush isn't endoring Trump. That's obvious.]
[So opinions are facts now? Oh wait, I forgot what subreddit I was in. Apparently how a person *feels* about another person is a fact now.]
[Have any of them publicly endorsed Trump?]
[When you are counting opinions... yes they are facts. 5 presidents * 0 supporting Trump = 0 presidents supporting Trump.]
[Two Bushes and a Clinton dont support Trump and you think that makes Trump look bad!]
[Trump does that all on his own. The fact that the Two Bush's don't support him is just a small fact that piles on.]
[Only living people who have been through the presidency and know it's challenges won't support a Presidential nominee yes, it makes him look bad.]
[lol. Yeah, she's just making this shit up. Actually all five of them are huge trump fans, but the media is *biased* so they won't carry the story.]
[I really do believer we should do like a Greatest Hits and just call this election of and let these guys rotate every couple of weeks until the next election.]
['We can't risk a Trump presidency' ad infinitum It's laughable the Clinton campaign doesn't see its own desperation.]

[Political establishment only back the political establishment, shocker.]
[I can't stand Trump but maybe that's a sign we should vote for him.]
[LOL. Absurd as that logic is, I can kinda understand it. People just want to see something give: what better way to shake things up than by dropping a live nuclear reactor on top of it all.]
[Those people are stupid.]
[I'm shocked we found a time where the Democrats are championing words and support from the Bush family. Whenever it's convenient and helps you, right?]
[That's cause he's not part of the establishment]
[I don't get this line of thinking. Trump is so very much part of the establishment. Perhaps not in elected office, but absolutely in every other way. He's even admitted it, giving money exactly to participate in keeping his place in the establishment.]
[And now he's being absolutely trashed because he wants to do something about it, makes you think...]
[What's he want to do about it again? Oh, he hasn't said? Wait, that's right, he doesn't have a single coherent policy position short of inflating the national debt by 13 Trillion dollars, 50 billion of which will be spent on an ineffective wall.]

[Yup, the billionaire wants the little people to take on the rich. Sound logic, friend]
[> He wants the little people to take back their country from the rich elite power structure. That's why he is handing trillions of dollars in tax cuts to the very rich. Because he loves the little guy.]

[And they all contributed to the very economic collapse this sub has been angry about for years.]
[Nobody has gone after Bushes like Donald Trump. The other 3 are Democrats, one Clinton work for and one is her husband. Nothing really surprising about this.]
[Yeah, cuz these criminals are the people we should be listening to.]
[I mean. Ones of them is married to the other major candidate. One of them is a insane millionaire richdaddy texan boy that is not actually from texas. One of them probably voted for Bernie Sanders. And the other is Obama.]

[lol 1 has the same last name, and 2 have been in a finical war with that family since their daddies had them in diapers]
[That just makes me want to vote for him even more. It's basically been 30 years of Clintons and Bush controlling the country and look where it's gotten us...]
[And at least 4 of them are distant cousins... Lol]
[some people really dont get it do they? trumps base is anti-establishment **to its core**. this is just confirming everything they have said from day 1: trump is here to upset the status quo and everyone who will suffer from that will come out against him. and hillaryclinton.com, LOL. fuck this sub.]
[Hahahah a link to fucking hillaryclinton.com, propaganda directly from the campaign, but you don't allow Breitbart.]
[If you can post things from the Hillary Clinton official website, can you also post things from the Donald Trump official website?]
[And there are 37 dead ones who could not give a shit.]
[Great. Why would Man-god Trump want to be endorsed by these establishment cretins ?]
[Laughing at the moderation staff right now.]
[there are five living presidents I think are crooks and liars. I a glad we think alike.]
[This photo makes me feel better about all those photos of me standing awkwardly.]
[And Hillary calls herself non-establishment? ahahahHAHAHAHA This is a *reason* that people support Trump. Obama and his wife both said some very intensely disdainful things about Hillary. And she said them about Obama. But, well, cabals gonna cabal ...]
[>HillaryClinton.Com Top quality articles right here.]
[Are there any world leaders that support Donald Trump?]
[Putin]
[>hillaryclinton.com lmao]
[Is there any of the 43 who would?]
[Warren G Harding probably would.]
[haha, publicly though?]
[Now **that** *is* the billion dollar question isn't it?]
[billion dollar indeed]
[The majority of them have been abysmal in the office, which lead us to the current situation we're going to have to live with. If anything, they should put the blame on themselves for letting it get to this point of absolute frustration among so many citizens.]
[Not a Trump supporter, but undecided voters sick of "politics as usual" will see this as a positive reason to vote for Trump.]
[Wow, what an excellent, unbiased source we have here]
[Some would say that's a good thing]
[Can we link to Trump's website too?]
[even more reason to vote for the donald.]
[Nice username, Hillary]
[Wow, this sub is sooo biased it's not even funny.]
[yea, but the only one that counts is honest abe.]
[three democrats so no surprise there. Trump beat the relative of the two republicans; so also no surprise there. Why is this even a discussion?]
[Yes so they'd rather see the person who beat their relatives lose than see someone with similar ideologies succeed? That seems pretty ignorant to be honest. I 100% don't believe that's the reason they aren't supporting trump.]
[> Trump beat the relative of the two republicans; Obama beat Hillary in the primary and she supported him. Hillary beat Bernie and he supported her. Why is this even an issue?]
[Not a Trump supporter, but I dont think any of these past five presidents have been good.]
[I mean, Clinton was alright. Balanced the debt. Scandal though. Still, that debt was nice.]
[Why would Donald Trump want to be endorsed by the establishment? Part of his appeal to voters is that he is something different than the run of the mill politician.]
[I don't support any of the 5 living presidents, so why should I care what they say?]
[The logical side of me knows/wants Clinton to win, the crazy fuck anarchist side of me wants to see Trump win.]
[This statement, to me, is more profound than I'd imagine you intended it to be. The world doesn't run on logic my friend. Especially when it comes to politics. Persuasion does not require factual information. I would even argue that logical arguments empower observers to come to independent conclusions, which might not align with the arguments intention. From this perspective, it is counter-productive for a successful politician to use facts and reason, especially if they must rely on votes from a large population.]
[I'd probably feel similar except I have a baby daughter now and it'd be a shame to have her first election be Don.]
[If you don't, it'll be her first boyfriend.]
[They look like awkward 1st graders taking a class photo. I love it.]
[These men represent the last almost 40 years of leadership. How you interpret this is up to you. If you think the world is devolving into a shit hole then you'll vote Trump. If you think we've been making slow but steady progress, similar to the growth of civilization for the last 10,000 years, then it's pretty damning.]
[> If you think the world is devolving into a shit hole then you'll vote Trump. Hold up. You should also have to believe that Tump is both willing and able to change things for the better. But I doubt most Trump supporters get that far in their reasoning.]
[fuck yeah]
[I wonder if I can get a job at Trump tower with no experience. "Why should we hire you?" Me: "I have a winning mentality. I'm the best because I hold myself to the same standard's your CEO does. I will make the janitor's closet great again."]
[Two of them got us into a war in Iraq, one nearly got us into a war with Iran, and the other has toppled the governments in Libya, Egypt, Syria, and Yemen. I think Trump will be fine without their endorsement.]
[They were also all part of the political establishment, so I don't see what there is to get so excited about here... (and President Obama never lived up to candidate Obama) However, if this was coming from democratic nominee Bernie Sanders, then I'd be more receptive to it, but coming from Hillary Clinton, it's pretty meaningless and depressing.]
["Five living US presidents" ... "none of them support Donald Trump" Which is exactly why he is compelling tens of thousands to consider voting next month, when they otherwise wouldn't have bothered.]
[Who cares? It's everyday Americans that matter, and it's obvious that they don't matter to Hillary at all. In fact, she even said she hated them.]
[Literally linking to hillaryclinton.com You guys aren't even remotely trying to be subtle anymore with the astroturfing hey? Go ahead and downvote me. I don't support Trump but this kinda stuff is disgusting. Literally blocking wikileaks links from here but allowing hillaryclinton.com lmao.]
[On Reddit, subreddit communities submit and upvote the posts we like. Most of the Trump supporters have decided to leave r/politics and form their own support group/subreddit over at r/The_Donald. If you're wondering why things may be slanted one way or another around here, it's because the deplorables took their balls and went home.]
[Hahaha straight from hillaryclinton.com r/politics is an absolute joke]
[You sure you understand how Reddit works?]
[Cool thanks for the post /r/politics you fucking dogshit sub.]
[You're not allowed to link to Breitbart or RT because they are biased and thus not reliable; hillaryclinton.com however..]
[I'm not sure how many of the dead ones would support him either, to be honest.]
[Just off the top of my head, Reagan, Ford, LBJ, JFK, Ike, FDR, Truman, and maybe Nixon. I can't really say for sure pre FDR because the parties have changed so much since then, but I'd assume almost every other previous POTUS would support Hillary. EDIT: I meant the President's I mentioned wouldn't support Trump. I'm not sure if I was clear about that.]
[I think you mean forgetful Ronnie, fumbling Ford, vulgar Lyndon, cheating Jack, little ike, stumbling Roosevelt, power hungry Harry, and raunchy Richard; a known Quaker.]
[Idk Reagan's most conservative son, Michael Reagan, explicitly said that if his fathers were alive today then Reagan would have fought against Trump every step of the way.]
[Jefferson Davis.]
[Andrew Jackson?]
[Has Trump publicly hated on Natives yet? I don't think he'd get an endorsement from Old Hickory without that.]
[Pretty much, yes.]
[He has no problem [offending them](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-elizabeth-warren-native-americans_us_57718e80e4b0f168323a9743).]
[Jackson would agree with his policies, but would probably beat the shit out of him if he actually spent five minutes in his company]
[I'd pay good money to see *that* shit...]
[We don't have Nixon to kick around anymore, but [Henry Kissinger has declined to endorse](http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/02/politics/henry-kissinger-george-shultz-donald-trump-hillary-clinton/) after meeting with Trump in May. Nixon White House Counsel [John Dean](https://twitter.com/johnwdean) is also against Trump.]
[How the fuck is Kissinger still alive?]
[That's what I ask every time he pops up in the news yet again. EDIT: he is 93 years old.]
[Literally my exact thought upon reading that comment.]
[He was really good at hiding his [phylactery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lich_\(Dungeons_%26_Dragons\)).]
[Souls of innocents, mostly.]
[Think about that... What have those 5 guys done that made America Great?]
[They were all pretty awful.]
[Which are pro-establishment? Isn't Trump?]
[lack of support for trump doesn't mean they support hillary. the Bush's will only ever vote for a Bush, Clinton is self evident, and Obama will do w/e the party reps tell him to at this point. that just leaves Carter, a democrat.]
[[HW is planning on voting for Hillary.](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/exclusive-george-hw-bush-to-vote-for-hillary-228395)]
[Bush Sr. has already publicly stated he is voting for Hillary.]
[Ah yes, a convincing list of presidents. Carter (near universally declared one of the worst presidents ever by many conservatives) Bush (father of Jeb! former trump opponent and disgraced guac merchant) Clinton (husband of the current nominee) Bush (brother of Jeb!) Obama (current president) A compelling argument.]
[Dude, face it; the only people who support Trump at this stage are (a) trolls (b) morons or (c) a fast-dwindling group of religious nuts. Most of the *current* GOP don't back him. *Ex-GOP* never had any reason to support an obvious liability.]
[nothing about anything you just said is true.]
[And never mind the fact that some quite senior Republicans have been tripping over each other in the scramble to distance themselves as far from Trump as humanly possible.]
[some being the key word there. It's nowhere near a significant majority or amount.]
[Are you contending that if Bill wasn't Hillary's husband he'd endorse Trump? No, he wouldn't. And are you saying that if HW Bush weren't Jeb!'s dad, he'd endorse Trump? A man who was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for his service in WWII, a graduate of Yale, Ambassador to the UN, Chairman of the RNC, Envoy (essentially Ambassador) to China, head of the CIA, 8 year Vice President and 4 year President, would endorse Trump? Bullshit.]
[The argument is that they've been through it and know what a presidency constitutes. Not "bohoo they hurt my brothers/sons feefees". You should learn the difference.]
[Username checks out]
[Not to endorse voting for [Alien Space Squids](https://www.wired.com/2011/06/alt-text-internet-argument/) here, but these guys got us into this mess in the first place, forgive me if maybe I form my own opinions on the issues.]
[well a couple of them are porbably senile by now, so.....]
[> porbably]
[So is Trump. Don't senile people usually stick together?]
[And what's the point? If Jeb was in would you be happier? Or is it over half the country is tired of the establishment having free reign?]
[Bush vs Clinton would be a fairly boring election. I mean, yeah, it'd be better if Clinton won, but Bush winning wouldn't be THAT big a deal. The establishment is not evil, and does not have "free reign". Hell, there is no "the establishment".]
[If Jeb won the primary I'd be happier in the sense that I would have more faith in the American people. For what it's worth, I do think we have systemic corruption within the government, but possibly the last guy I'd ever put my faith in to repair it is Donald Trump.]
[The irony is that the US is not very corrupt at all.]
[They are all crooked]
[Establishment presidents not supporting an anti-establishment candidate? I'm shocked! ^^/s]
[Just realized that every living Republican president is named Bush and when HRC is elected half of the living Democratic presidents will be named Clinton.]
[We definitely sure Bill doesn't?]
[I see this as a plus for Trump]
[Given that it's presidents from all sides of the aisle, and the fact that these people know what it's actually like to be president, this should really be saying something.]
[To his supporters, this is just proof the establishment is out to get him. For some reason some people think that everyone is working against trump because they are afraid he will the corruption and all the corrupt politicians will be exposed. In reality they just don't want a president who would destroy the country.]
[I don't think he'll destroy the country, a president is not that powerful. I just think he'll completely mess up foreign politics, perpetuate the stereotypes of America and generally make steps backwards whereas we could have had someone who would have made steps forward, but I fear the latter is out of the question regardless who wins. It's just picking the lesser of 2 evils at this point.]
[So we're just upvoting literal propaganda from HRC's campaign now? Don't get me wrong, I am the furthest thing from a Trump supporter but I think it's worth at least TRYING to be unbiased.]
[Are you sure you understand how Reddit works?]
[Seriously.. the source here is from hillaryclinton.com... while yes there are 5 presidents alive I don't think The republican candidates rival's website can be considered a source here. Then again it's a pro Hillary story and that is all this sub will promote.]
[That's awesome cus the last one that didn't suck was Raegan]
[Which is ironic that Jimmy is on the stage considering his run for office. He was the Democrat's Mr. Anti-Establisment. http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/05/what-nevertrump-can-learn-from-anybody-but-carter-213860]
[[deleted]]
[Yes, Im sure the Bush family is simply holding a petty grudge. It couldn't possibly be the gross incompetence of Trump. Its really beyond your rational thought that former Presidents can see beyond what amounts to schoolyard tiffs in the grand scheme of running the nation isnt it?]
[Ugh i hate the bushes. Why is hillary such good friends with them?]
[Because they are gentlemen and won't tell her to go fuck herself like they should.]
[You'd be surprised if you ever met W or his father. W is disarmingly likable. Watch episode 20 of The Circus to see what he's like now the he's out of the firing lines. That's the Bush I heard about back in 2000. Back then even the most liberal press people thought he was very likable, if a bit glib and hopelessly out of his depth. Like anyone, people tend to bond over shared experiences. When you're from multi-president families like they are, there's very few people you can truly relate to. It's actually very common for former presidents to become close friends.]
[Don't you pussies downvote me just because I pointed out that politicians are people too. I thought Bush was a laughably terrible president. But he wouldn't have even got the job if he didn't have some personal magnetism. It's not like he was wowing people with his acumen. And please no one be a smartass and talk about the Supreme Court and Florida or some shit. Yes, I know about it already. We all know.]
[I totally agree. I look back on Bush's presidency fondly, despite hating it's effects on my country and the world.]
[That's because outside of Carter they are all either republicans or republican lite.]
[TIL Bill Clinton and Barack Hussein Obama are Republicans.]
[I mean... yeah. Bill accomplished more of Gingrich's goals than his own party's platform and Obama had a cabinet chosen by Citigroup.]
[I can't speak for him but when he wrote "republican lite" I believe he was saying that they are no different than republicans.]
[Um...]
