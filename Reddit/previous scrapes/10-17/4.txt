Our very young country is nearly a blank slate in comparison to the historical entaglements there. The fabulous wealth from oil, the poverty and indenturrd servitude vs the regional shopping cart islamic culture, wahabi brainwashing...... I doubt Trump has the vaguest idea....]
[Are they really? I've not kept up recently on what's happening.]
["Death throes" is an exaggeration. But ISIS have been losing a lot lately both in Syria and Iraq. They recently lost their last border with Turkey (presumably greatly reducing influx of foreign fighters) and just today the Iraqi government announced that their attack on Mosul (the largest city ISIS occupies) has begun.]
[Yeah, I just caught myself up since I posted. It's great progress. Goes to show that despite all their talk, as expected, once faced with an actual disciplined military, they simply can't hold on. Now it's just a matter of time as we watch the jaws shut.]
[Coalition forces be rollin' on their turf, yo.]
[I actually disagree with Obama, because I think we should have intervened (non-directly) in Syria earlier. Who cares if it pisses off the Russians - they are desperate enough to take aggressive stances in Eastern Europe and the Middle East because they know how limited their power is and have to exaggerate it whenever possible. It's easy to say that arming and supporting the FSA would have been a good idea now because we don't know whether they would have ended up in the wrong hands, so that's a cheap critique. But I really do believe we should have sided more strongly with the Kurds. Use our support of Iraqi and Syrian Kurdish groups (which are ideologically compatible (secular and democratic) and effective) could have even been used as a wedge to encourage Iraq to abide by its non-sectarian commitments (which may have reduced ISIS ability to co-opt and infiltrate many sunni areas). Turkey needed to be forced into that corner early because it's clear they are still finding their place. They took a strong stand against Assad. Looked the other way with ISIS. Backtracked on peaceful relations with Kurdish minority. Antagonized Russia by shooting down the fighter jet. Devolving into an authoritarian state with theocratic undertones. Offering olive branch to Russia. They are a fucked up country and we should have sent them a clear message by backing the Kurds and thereby engaging in their largest vulnerability to force them to the table and get them to tighten up that Syrian border. If we are the ones backing the kurds and proping up turkey's western aspirations we can set the stage for negotiations.]
[Serious question. If Assad is somehow removed, isn't that another Iraq?]
[Depends. In your favor there's the fact that a large portion of the population would still be loyal to the old government, and a standing army that would potentially form into a paramilitary terrorist group. In his defense, many *many* Syrians were in the streets demanding that Assad hold fair elections and/or step down (depending on what time period you're looking at). There wasn't exactly a huge upsurge of anti-Saddam sentiment until the Coalition moved in. So the landscape is too different and the causes too different, in my opinion, to call this hypothetical Syrian intervention "Another Iraq."]
[That's a fair point. Thank you. Would like to ask you more but I'm tired and it's late for me and I'm old.]

[my entire, like extended and all, family is republican. Yes, they think that FOX is censored from telling it like it is. The truth is so much worse, right? I think it's media being untrustworthy for a number of years, combined with the internet for newbies being a google search away from a forum filled with similar notions. My sister is a damned doctor, and she wouldn't vote for Hillary if you put a gun to her head.

Is that really the tie that binds?]

[What the fuck dude...]
[Donald, what are you doing on Reddit? Isn't Twitter your thing?]
[Wait, are you not allowed to vote for trump if you "like to drink and get down" and "throw amazing parties"?]
[i think you missed the whole point on purpose.]
[This is the weird part. They've been cut off from Turkey, they're on the cusp of losing Mosul, they're being inexorably crushed. It's almost like none of them read the news or anything and don't have a clue what's going on in Iraq/Syria...]
[They blend back in to the population. Remember when America took the conquered land, over 95% in total from the Taliban? They ran away, hid, but now they are back. This is what will happen with ISIS. We live in an age now of terrorism. It's going to be a shitty thing to get used to.]
[Best plan right now: fire all the generals. Get new generals that Trump knows are the best.]
[If they admitted that, they would lose one of their main arguments. They try to paint a picture of America as a country on the verge of apocalypse, under siege by evil forces from without and within, and only they can save you.]
[this does seem problematic, but at the same time, it's an election year. Candidates take the primacy, every other year, our appointees do the work. So *maybe there's hope?* LOLOLOLOLOLOLOL]
[I can never tell which bad conservative politicians are lying, and which truly don't know facts on certain topics. As if they're just unaware and too stubborn.]

[Sure. The Islamic State is going to come take over Duluth. Jesus, we're the most heavily armed populace in the free world. If these guys ever carried flags on this continent they'd be strung up like Mussolini by sundown.]
[IKR. Even if/when Hillary wins... That 40% that is still going to vote for Trump sure as shit isn't going to let ISIS invading just happen... And who really thinks the other 60% would either....?]
[No!! I'll die before those ISIS bastards take over the Northern Waters Smokehaus and the Depot! Who knew they would think to strike our strategic taconite shipping channels??]
[Obama took everyone's guns, though.]
[Not mine]
[Oh really? I was sure I read something that said he was going to take everyone's guns.]
[IS would never occupy, but they will surely recruit brain washed lone wolves to shoot up malls and movie theaters to assert their dominance. An armed populace will help.combat that.]
[But what about ISIS's huge Navy and massive airforce? It will be so easy for them to mobilize large numbers of troops, cross the ocean, and occupy the US.]
[Maybe our level of armament and paranoia aren't actually contradictory.]
[THEY ARE NOT TAKING DULUTH! I spend weekends there sometimes! Plus if they take Duluth that basically cuts off access to the eastern Boundary Waters and we Minnesotans will not stand for that! Seriously, who believes this stuff?]

[And 4.5 million go hunting while the rest make a meal. You have to live there to understand. It's more Texas than Texas.]
[I'm not trying to disprove you, I was just curious. I was interested and looked it up. I still get a Freedom erection from this shit though Go American hunters! You motherfuckers are awesome! http://nation.foxnews.com/2013/11/04/american-hunters-–-world’s-largest-army]
[That just gave me a patriotic erection.]
[/r/confusedboners]
[I don't understand these red states. If an enemy power EVER tried to invade. They would have a mass armed insurrection to deal with. If ISIS, a weak foreign power, tried I would feel remarkably safe.]
[Yeah there are thousands, possibly millions, of Americans who would love to live out a Red Dawn type scenario.]
[At least until the clean water runs out.]
[True. But then the campers and backpackers can really shine. I go to the Boundary Waters for a week every year, so I have 2 different types of filters and a handful of other ways to purify water, including UV and tablets. So I guess it comes down to why the water is unclean.]
[Wanna put it into perspective? Easy. The US military has just under one million members serving. Now granted, they have access to jets, tanks, missiles, and a host of other force multipliers, but when it comes to actually *invading* a country and *holding it*, it still comes down to infantry. Boots on the ground. There are currently over 300 million legally-owned firearms in the US and we have an estimated household gun ownership rate of roughly 32%. So yeah, good luck actually capturing and holding territory in the US by force with anything short of nuclear carpet bombing.]
[They would never hold territory, it's the small organized or lone wolf attacks that are a concern. That is the nature of ISIS, kill vulnerable civilians. They don't stand a chance against trained forces. I read something a while back about Navy SEALS having a 1000:1 kill ratio against them.]
[A weekend warrior or an elderly wheat farmer is hardly what I'd call "boots on the ground". You're right, of course, and more than enough people would at least take up arms, but, I'd have to say, I do believe that ISIL combat veterans are probably superior fighters to any given (but of course not every) American gun owner. It's fun to think in the hypothetical, when you know the premise is absurd.]
[>A weekend warrior or an elderly wheat farmer is hardly what I'd call "boots on the ground". But those "weekend warriors" still have more training and experience than your average ISIS terrorist, and a lot of the more serious civilians probably have training comparable to most soldiers since a lot of them train with former Army and Marines. They're no match for Navy SEALs or anything, but a lot of them are probably on-par with your average Army soldier or Marine that's never seen combat. >I do believe that ISIL combat veterans are probably superior fighters to any given (but of course not every) American gun owner. Combat veterans? Sure. They have experience, and no amount of training trumps experience. Remember, though, that a lot of retired US military veterans come back to the states, form up groups of friends both ex-military and otherwise, and all go shooting together, and even a casual day at the range involves a fair amount of "here's how you clear a jam in combat" and "here's the best position for shooting from cover." It's surprising how many gun-owning civilians have some simple, basic combat training. It's also scary how many gun-toting civilians lack training entirely, so it's a mixed bag.]
[They might get Superior, WI if they attack while the Packers are playing. Catch everyone drunk and off guard.]

[Oh look they said EXACTLY the same thing about Obama when he was running. That he was a secret muslim that would welcome terrorists to the country blah blah blah blah... This is like 8 years ago all over again.]
[Obama has been a terrible president. Btw did you know he's spent almost 300 Days on golfing vacations during his presidency? Over 9 months of golfing.. in 8 years of his presidency.]
[No. I didn't know that, because it isn't true. He spends, on average, 4 to 5 hours playing golf when he plays- that would equal 1500 hours. there are 8760 hours in a year, for just 7 years- that would total 61320 hours. Considering that the President is actually on duty 24/7, 1500 hours of golf isn't that big of a deal. If the average person takes 2 days off a week, that would be 17,472 hours over 7 years. That is not including any vacation time, or the normal 16 hours a day that they spend not at work (24 hours minus 8 at work). Your welcome.]

Meanwhile, i had the satisfaction of watching his ass have to eat a 20 minute speech from a 64 year old black woman about Obama and Hillary, and why Trump was trash. Afterwards he just shook his head and said, "she's on your side". People are easily brainwashed it would seem.]
[Wait you mean Obama's America actually didn't happen?]

[She will change that.]
[They're taking Mosul right this very minute.]
[I think that's a bit optimistic; I looked at a map this morning and they still control pretty long stretches of territory. That said, they *are* on their way out, thankfully.]
[A lot of that control boils down to low-value territory with a minimal human, let alone ISIL, presence. Of course, you could say that of any entity involved in a territorial war, but if you count by the liberation of cities rather than just surface area, ISIL's control is definitely a shadow of its former self.]

[The Mosul attack is now underway. Very early stages though.]
[Petraeus said this morning ISIS soldiers know the end is near, they have been killing deserters in Mosul, coalition forces have the city surrounded. Trump is just throwing nonsense out to bait people who haven't been paying attention, like always.]
[Mosul has been surrounded for a while now. They just started attacking it today]
[I really hope Mosul falls before the next debate, just to see what Trump's response will be. That probably won't happen, but one can hope.]
[Mosul will likely take months, even years. It is a massive city and it was a warren of narrow streets, high buildings, and inter-connected cellars BEFORE ISIS began building bunkers and tunnels. Assuming ISIS just doesn't flee en masse.]

It seems to change so often. I can't keep straight which Clinton we're dealing with.]
[Or maybe two different groups of people have two different opinions on Clinton?]
[except these criticisms often come from the same trump supporters.]
[It depends if it's public or private remember? She has a public opinion and a private opinion on everything according to her. That's what Lincoln did!]
[You're two choices aren't mutually exclusive, meaning they can both be true. Clinton is a champion of the kind of wars the US has fought for the past couple decades. And perhaps you've noticed, they haven't been turning out too well.]
[Today's the day Donald can't even protect one of his own campaign offices, but is totally qualified to protect the entire country.]
[It was the same with Obama. Weak and authoritarian, incompetent but also an evil mastermind. Nobody ever accused that party of logical coherence.]
[At this point can we just stop pretending Trump isnt a moron. We can argue about whether or not one would be a better candidate but it is very clear Trump is objectively ignorant and that shouldn't be a political statement.]

[You guys got it all wrong, Donald is low key plugging "Man in the High Castle" on Amazon Prime video]
[It's both. The GOP has seamlessly altered their Schrödinger's President rhetoric they used for Obama to now vilify Clinton.

[That actually sounds about right. It's really disconcerting when I'm researching this stuff and the articles suddenly go from "She takes donations from Quatar and wants war with Russia" to "She wants SINGLE PAYER HEALTH CARE!!!" I'm like, "Oh... well... awesome! I hope you're right!"]
[GOP voters actually call her both hawkish and too weak. At least bernie supporters are consistent in just calling her hawkish.]
[Dont talk shit about Genghis]
[I'm a Bernie supporter and I really like Hillary :) I think most of us do.]
[Probably not playing this right, but no, against Bernie she was the lesser of the two options, now she is the better. By far.]
[to trump supporters she's the female greg stillson]
[She also smells like sulphur]
[Hi sulfur coal isn't part of her plan]
[Well, she's been battling ISIS her whole adult life, according to Trump. Lol.]
[And yet Trump is having trouble fighting her. Even though she's only been an adult for 9 years...]
[Ever since she founded it at least!]
[Who better to know how Isis works then?!?!]
[DJT, he knows it better than the generals and admirals.]
[According to Trump she's a co-founder of ISIS as well.]
[TIL Hillary has been an adult for 4 years]
[I sincerely thought that was the joke. As in, Trump was calling her barely-an-adult on foreign policy.]
[That's how we all took it and then he doubled down.]
[Nah that's not possible, Trump wasn't hitting on her.]
[Just because that's accurate, relevant, and perfectly timed doesn't mean that... umm... Where was I going with this? Oh yeah, ^murca]
[Trump really missed an opportunity there. /s]
[That would still give her more experience being an adult than Trump has.]
[Well I believe they appeared in 2007. So really she's been an adult for 9 years.]
[If you mean ISIL, it was founded in 1999, ISIS was used in 2011. ISIL includes the Levant, which is the whole region. ISIS is Iraq and Syria only.]
[Thank you for the correction I didn't know that.]
[2003, not 1999. In 1999 al-Zarqawi was still in Afghanistan and had been rebuffed by bin Ladin for his radical views that didn't align with al-Qa'ida's goals.]
[Look at wiki]
[I don't know anything about what Wiki says. I have an entire shelf of scholarly sources though that draw a very straight line though. Like I said, al-Zarqawi was still in Afghanistan in 1999 operating out of Herat. A good, easily digestible piece that I send a lot of people to is the Combating Terrorism Center's 2014 work, "The Group that Calls Itself a State: Understanding the Evolution and Challenges of the Islamic State". It's a pretty easy 100 page read that's free to download here: https://www.ctc.usma.edu/posts/the-group-that-calls-itself-a-state-understanding-the-evolution-and-challenges-of-the-islamic-state]
[>100 page read.. I'll just take your word for it.]
[Wait, why wouldn't you want to read it? This is a topic that a larger percentage of our population should show some basic knowledge on. That might help us get leaders in place who show deeper understanding and therefore can begin to propose solutions that might have a chance of working. If we willingly remain ignorant of the issue and allow politicians to tell us "the truth of it" as Trump tries to do through intentional misinformation, then we are going to continue to respond with bad solutions and the problem will fester.]
[That's not really accurate. AQI was Zarqawi's group in Iraq that was turned into ISI by the first Baghdadi and then the second Baghdadi formed the Islamic State.]
[What's not accurate? ISIL was founded in '99 and the ISIS iteration was changed in 2011.]
[It wasn't called ISIL--and attributing that name to it mischaracterizes it's origins. It's an important distinction]
[Can you recommend a good book on the topic? I know I'll probably end up on some list for buying it on Amazon, but that's life]
[black flags by joby warrick]
[ISIS: Inside the Army of Terror by Hassan Hassan and Michael Weiss Pretty easy to follow and gives the history.]
[Here's an article for starts. http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/03/what-isis-really-wants/384980/ I'm currently writing a giant 40 page paper on the topic so I've gotten most of my research through online databases.]
[To further clarify, al-Zarqawi was still in Afghanistan in 1999. He returned to Iraq in the fall of 2001. He founded his own group to advance his anti-Shiite views in 2003, al-Tawhid wa-al-Jihad. However, this group was not publicly revealed until April 2004. After the public revealing, bin Ladin reached out to al-Zarqawi and offered al-Qa'ida franchising so they could have access to his network to fight the US invasion. That's when they became "al-Qa'ida in Iraq". They operated as AQI until al-Zarqawi's death in June 2006. Afterwards, the first al-Baghdadi renamed the group The Islamic State of Iraq. They remained such until the alliance with al-Nusra in 2012 to advance in to the Syria mess and became ISIS. So, the post above yours that claims 1999 is wrong. 2003 is the generally accepted date of founding.]
[Right. Etymology wise and ideology wise the idea of the "Islamic state/caliphate" was developed later in Zarqawi's career.]
[i agree, the Caliphate was something that started much later than the USA invasion. It didn't really begin until we started drawing troops down in Iraq. ISIL didn't really exist as it we think of it, a Caliphate in the forming, until Obama's presidency, *not that i blame him*, but that shit was not really formed up till they had a bit of room to move.]
[hence why she can't be president - she's not 35 yet.]
[It's both. You see she has been fighting isis for 30 years and now she is on her deathbed from exhaustion.]
[why would she be doing that? isn't she the co-founder?]
[I believe she's been fighting ISIS her whole adult life.]
[She's also founded isis as well.]
[I thought she was on drugs.]
[I thought she's been fighting them her whole adult life?]
[30 years? Dude she's 70. She's been fighting ISIS her entire adult life. That's 52 years of battling ISIS.]
[We would have had ISIS in the 90's but Hillary personally held fought and held them back for 20 years.]
[She has been fighting what she created.]
[Such is the duality of ~~man~~ Hillary Clinton.]
[You forgot about how she founded ISIS apparently so she would have something to fight when her husband was President.]
[She's made of steel, this is nothing!]
[She and Obama also founded Isis.]
[They made Isis? I made Isis.]
[Was this before or after they declared war on Iraq?]
[Before, she founded ISIS, regretted it, and then fought it for her adult life.]
[Whoa Whoa Whoa, you're telling me that not only did they found ISIS, they also got the MVP awards from them? That's incredibly biased! I don't know if I can support Hillary.]
[And she's been fighting it her whole adult life.]
[Yeah, I'm glad I didn't make a mistake in my youth that I spent my entire adult life fighting.]
[According to Trump and his supporters, Hillary has done literally everything in the world.]
[Vote this woman in, she has done literally everything even without being President. Imagine what she could do *as* President!]
[Only the bad things! All the good things were Trump.]
[Hilary cancelled Seinfeld.]
[Only the bad stuff. She's never around for any of the good stuff (usually off plotting or doing the bad stuff). What stuff? All of it.]
[and yet she's all words and no action.]
[If Hillary is really everything Trump supporters and Trump himself are making her out to be, she's likely the most powerful human in history.]
[Well shit she sound productive as hell then.]
[She should have said to blame her for global warming]
[Yet, she is also completely ineffective and incapable of getting anything done.]
[I truly think there is so much displaced Mom-anger heaped on Hillary's shoulders right now. The trumpsters sound like how my teenagers are on a bad day: I'm omnipotent and omniscient and can fix anything, but I'm mean and ruin everything, and also I'm a blathering idiot who doesn't know anything. And everything, everything all is my fault and never theirs. All of this, of course, is true at the same time.]
[It's Schrödinger's Brat.]
[I still blame her for that cowardly attack on Ceasar. In the back, like a true cowardly liberal.]
[I thought she was the one that killed jesus?]
[Supplied the hemlock for ancient Greece also.]
[Yes but also in 30 years of public life she hasn't done anything, she hasn't done anything folks. Sad.]
[Well, I guess that Child health care law was nothing. That 9/11 first responders healthcare law was nothing. Those 400 bills she sponsored in the Senate were nothing. Maybe if you keep repeating it into the conservative echo chamber your "facts" will become real.]
[Shhhh....you can't say facts around here... it's election year.]
[Fact check needed in Aisle 5!]
[Lol]
[What a resume! We should make sure to hire her before somebody else does.]
[Remember in the debate how clinton asked trump if he was going to blame her for everything and his response, and I quote, was "why not". Ah simpler times.]
['Youre right, why not.']
[Shes so obviously tired of it I wouldnt have been able to keep a straight face at any point in the debate if it were me lmao id just break out laughing]
[> In the opening’s best moment, a seemingly shaken Hillary crumpled at Trump’s introduction of the four women who accused Bill of all sorts of nastiness. Then, just as she seemed on the verge of tears, Hillary’s devil returned. “Get real,” she shouted. “I’m made of steel. This is nothing. Hi girls!” Referring to the SNL skit, found this via google (http://deadline.com/2016/10/saturday-night-live-emily-blunt-alec-baldwin-kate-mckinnon-donald-trump-hillary-clinton-1201837133/)]
[And also co-founded it]
[Except she's also a fighter who never quits.]
[Coke fiend*]
[Must be some Scott Sterling shit because I hear she has no stamina. I guess she just lays there and lets her limp body do all the work.]
[It's pretty impressive considering her low stamina.]
[Her record in Bosnia is a testament to that. Oh, wait...]
[Hopped up on drugs!]
[Also, she founded ISIS.]
[A fighter who never quits....while at the same time lacking stamina, apparently.]
[Exactly, she's fighting so hard it's killing her!]
[I hope she dies before election day.]
[Hillary has been dead for the last 30 years and how much rotting does she have to show for it? Nothing.]
[She just doesn't have the stamina I suppose...]
[Time to add Hillary Clinton to Broforce.]
[She's fighting a war on two fronts, the poor woman.]
[She's a double agent. A secrete agent man/woman.]
[Three fronts. She's also doing her household chores.]
[[she can bring home the bacon and fry it up in the pan and never ever (Taylor Swift prelude ?) let] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA4DR4vEgrs)]
[Four fronts! She's also attacking the women Bill slept around with.]
[I didn't expect a kind of Spanish Inquisition...]
[The chief weapon *is* surprise...]
[No, that's Bill's job. Hillary is too busy making money by selling her influence to foreign entities.]
[Nah, with all the coke she's been doing, she gets it all done herself. But she's also dead and MSM won't report it.]
[Four fronts. Gotta help Bill rape!]
[Five fronts-- I'll come in again. ***NOBODY*** **EXPECTS THE ISIS INQUISITION!!!**]
[/r/unexpectedinquisition]
[It's threads like these that make me think Reddit is filled with bots.]
[The conspiracy theories are so ridiculous, she's dying of cancer after suffering a stroke, while founding Isis, while profiteering off Clinton foundations war funds, while assassinating rivals and allies, while running for president, while acid burning and deleting emails, while having lesbian orgys, while being secretary of state, while being investigated for Benghazi]
[I can't wait for Netflix to start filming her life tbh]
[She should make this her opening statement next debate]
[it's funny because you're joking, but in southern alabama, the people raise these arguments, each individually, and then compile it to make your comment true. There's literally nothing i can do to argue with people whose diatribe against her is all that. They wouldn't believe me anyways. It's amazing. It's Swiftboats Veterans for Kerry all over again.]
[Just imagine the headlines after she leaves office: "Miraculous Clinton avoids death for 8 straight years, manages to destroy ISIS and restore the economy while battling cancer, stroke and multiple assassination attempts"]
[but no stamina]
[Jeez, busy lady. And to think it's tough enough for me to keep a tidy house, work my 40 hour week and maintain *one* hobby. If that's what she's been up to I hafta look up tp her for finding 45 hours in every 24 tbh]
[Hillary Clinton is whatever you're afraid of. Hillary Clinton is the marshmallow man.]
[I ain't afraid of no marshmallow man.]
[Also: End of Debate 1: "She doesn't have the Stamina". End of Debate 2: "She's a fighter, she doesn't give up".]
[OMG a billionaire playboy who has issues with fear? Is this some kind of alternate universe Batman?]
[I think you're on to something here - Trump is the opposite of Batman in every conceivable measure, his dark (darker?) reflection. The hero the alt-right deserves, but the one the rest of us don't need right now. So we'll mock him - because he can take it. Because he's not our hero. He's a silent groper. A watchful inciter. An Orange Knight.]
[Woman]
[Hillary Clinton is 8 years of a Trump Presidency?]
[According to Jill Stein, yes.]
[According to Trump she's all the bad things he is, so yes!]
[...huh. That... that is surprisingly evocative...]
[Reminds me of Quantum Obama that Repubs described back in the day. Simultaneously a weak pushover "community organizer"...yet also an absolute tyrannical usurper.]
[As a republican, I found the notion that he was a tyrant to be comedic. He was, however, incredibly weak and unsuited to maintain foreign diplomacy with our enemies. Remember when the Filipino president cursed out Obama on live television, calling him a "son of a bitch"? Who would dare say that to what is supposedly the most respected president of all time. On top of that, China quite literally spat in our face when Obama went there to discuss with them. We were not given a red carpet on the tarmac, and chinese officials almost drew their guns on reporters sent with Obama. In Saudi Arabia, Obama bowed to their king yet was not met with a bow in return as should be done in Saudi tradition. Obama is not respected by any official of foreign power.]
[>calling him a "son of a bitch" That's not what happened.]
[you actually think that Obama should care about what that inbred shitstain DuTARDte says, wow]
[It shows foreigners do not think highly of us.]
[wow, Just wow. why don't you take a trip to google type in Obama world wide approval rating and post the results in this thread.]
[The pollings were taken in Europe and specifically those nations that are our close allies. When I say foreigners, I mean the ones who could be potential threats to us, such as Russia, China, the UAE, etc. I should have worded it better on my part.]
[Of course they dont like Obama, they don't like America. In other words you are right 100% in the case of those countries governments, however those countries are down towards the bottom of the list when it comes to how the world perceives them. With that, does it matter what countries without a leg to stand on say about Obama?]
[not to mention that the people you specified arn't exactly pillars of the world community.]
[Come on man. We have $16t GDP, 13 carrier groups and who knows how many Trident II packing subs. Not too fuckin' worried about what the shithole countries have to say about our President, country, or just about anything. Take solace that we live in the greatest country in the history of the human race. America is already great motherfuckers.]
[I do agree that we as a nation are still extremely powerful and triumph above the rest, but I do believe Obama set a bad example for us and has made a fool of himself. Of course, nobody would even dare invade us, for we are the most powerful nation in the world rivaling China. It just isn't a good characteristic as a president to allow this happen to you and let it stick to the image of your country.]
[I think Obama having strength means he doesn't react like a kid on a playground when some leader verbally denigrates him. I think that is a good quality in a leader.]
[Kind of like the evil genius/dumb as rocks bush?]
[I don't think a single person called GWB a genius without sarcasm. Cheney though...]
[A radical Muslim but also a scary radical Reverend Wright Christian.]
[Aw I loved those days. The stupidity was just as bad, but seeing them trigger when confronted with the hypocrisy was delightful]
[Also Schroedinger's Immigrant. He simultaneously steals your job and sits at home being lazy on government handouts.]
["Back in the day"]
[Reminds me of Clint Eastwood addressing an empty chair.]
[He's a Communist Fascist and I don't like him. - Some woman from virginia (paraphrased, but she definitely said communist fascist)]
[Ah yes. The quantum Obama that was reading books to kids during 9/11, also rhe same Obama that got us involved in Iraq.]
[>rhe same Obama that got us involved in Iraq. That was all Hillary's fault, she singlehandedly started that war over George W Bush's valiant attempts to stop her]
[But "Mission accomplished" Obama on the aircraft carrier was kinda boss...]
[Quantum Obama stole the 2000 election from Gore.]
[The paradoxically cowardly and weak yet all powerful enemy is a hallmark of fascist rhetoric. Not to go full Godwin, but think about Nazi propaganda against the Jews; simultaneously inferior subhumans and omniscient masterminds pulling the strings behind the worlds banks.]
[Cue Obama emperor palatine analogy]
[The idea is that the enemy is powerful in the field of subversion and control, but lacking in moral fiber and physical power, so that a strong authoritarian leader will be able to knock them down with a single mighty blow.]
[And even that 'logic' makes no sense in modern warfare. We're not cavemen charging each other with clubs. We're ideally intelligent engineers and technicians using state of the art weaponry.]
[Yes, a feckless tyrant, a communist Nazi, a Muslim atheist anti-christ. It doesn't matter if the insults are consistent, so long as they're insults. This is what really disillusioned me with the voting populace over the last 8 years; I can completely understand someone disliking Obama's policies or judgement. I cannot understand someone thinking he is a horrible human being. His demeanor, maturity, and decorum alone have improved our standing and perception in the world abroad. And yet, if you talk to your average conservative southerner, you'd hear more often than not that not only is he "bad", but he is "the worst president in American history". Hell, the current GOP frontrunner has said that repeatedly. It's hard enough to get anything done or to compromise when the other side is unwilling to budge, but it's nearly impossible when the other side refuses to acknowledge objective reality.]
[I love the reverse. Trump is powerful and strong. In reality he's thin-skinned, vain, and reactionary.]
[It's these same republicans that seem to forget the time when everyone in the world was laughing at America because of how stupid George Bush was. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3n3bWLEvJk]
[Its like they cant even remember 2007.]
[>the worst president in American history People who say that are, usually, just voicing their racial bias.]
[He has been the darkest moment of American politics of all time]
[I just wish we had a president to bring us back to the light.]
[Nah people said it about Bush, Clinton, Bush, Reagan, Carter and they were all white. Its mostly a hardcore left/right bias mixed with a little time bias (things happening right now seem like more of a big deal than things that happened a long time ago). Believe it or not there are a lot more people that hate Obama because he is a Democrat than hate him because of his race.]
[To be fair, I think there's a decent case to be made for Bush (Jr).]
[Well there hadn't been a black President at that time. But anyway, the reality is almost certainly that people who say these things don't know about presidents like James Buchanan or Andrew Johnson. Also interesting side note: It's hard to actually rank presidents because it's hard to look objectively at the ones in living memory versus ones 100+ years ago.]
[Remember those shit stains bitching about his hand and posture while he salutes? Coffeegate (he held a cup of coffee.) And they'd go back and say Bush Jr would *never* do such a thing. It would devolve me into a guy who simply posts Bush Jr saluting with his dog in arms looking like he's about to drop everything. The primal rage from those asses was simply intoxicating **Edit** he had his dog in his arms http://nowscape.com/islam/images/Bush_dog_salute.jpg]
[Wow, yeah. And you just reminded me of [that time Obama put his foot up on the desk](http://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/sep/4/obamas-feet-oval-office-desk-sends-shockwaves-arou/) in the Oval Office and people lost their shit, even though previous presidents (including Bush) had done the same thing and nobody cared. Weird.]
[Salute with coffee in hand=unforgivable. Mock a guy who was tortured as a POW for 5 1/2 years because he "got caught"=meh, no biggy....]
[Yea but at least trump supports our.. well.. at least he's not muslim!]
[To them Obama is for Sharia law and marriage equality for same sex couples.]
[> Sharia law and marriage equality for same sex couples. A natural alliance....]
[yeah down here people are so poor they never had health insurance. Now that they finally have it, they are getting lots of work done like dental, ER visits, and blood test once or twice a year. Then those same people, will turn around and vote for the GOP runner who promises to take away their health insurance. I hate to generalize, but i asked them why they vote for the guy who will take their insurance away, and they all say its because of their religious beliefs and gun rights. It doesn't matter what else is at stake, nothing else matters but those 2 things.]
[Yea hes a communist that bails out wall street. It's like a third grader using profanity they don't even understand.]
[And it was Bush that bailed out Wall Street.]
[It's more complicated than that. Bush in tandem with congressional democrats did the first round of bailouts iirc; Obama did round 2 along with a multitude of other measures to get the economy to stabilize.]
[At least Trump talks words which makes good sense ideas. He has the best words, tremendous words. When obummers don't talk angry, you know they are hiding there angryness and can't be trusted. > An educated citizenry is a vital requisite for our survival as a free people. -Thomas Jefferson]
[Never forget which party cuts education. And yes right now it is Republicans but I really mean this for everyone in every nation who reads this. What we are witnessing right now at its base point are the consequences of awful education, particularly in the confederacy.]
[He's right. The ISIS Navy is currently positioned not too far off the US coast. They'll strike when she's inaugurated. /s if it wasn't clear enough.]
[It doesn't take a navy. Just ask Germany.]
[That is the plot of a shitty chuck norris movie.]
[I was wondering where my dad's canoe went :(]
[ISIS has TWICE the number of Trident Nuclear launch submarines we do.]
[We laughed when Trump said we needed an invisible electrified ocean wall. We didn't listen! Why didn't we listen?!]
[Yes I'm certain that there is a fleet Isis kayaks just off the coast or something like that. I hear they must have the top 200the naval fleet in the world.]
[I heard they're taking over Carnival cruise line.]
[I heard ISIS infiltrated Samsung...]

[Unfortunately I fear we may be a bowl of petunias in this scenario.]
["Oh no, not again?"]
[Don't talk about Trump's mom like that]
[Does anyone get the feeling that he's just market-testing Breitbart headlines?]
[I wish. I could say half my cousins are just market-testing Breitbart headlines on Facebook. But then you talk to them and they really believe this shit.]
[Yep. If you listen to conservative radio - Hannity, Rush etc, you will see how they all talk same language on the same day. Either Trump says some crazy stuff, and they follow him, or Rush will say some crazy stuff, and Trump will have same crazy stuff in his speech that after noon. And you can see our friends at /r/The_Deplorables going nuts over same crazy stuff, and few hours later, all Trump supporter will ask questions about it on /r/asktrumpsupporters.]
[It's like a comedian who goes to an open mike night to try out his new material. Expect the best cheered ones at the last debate.]
[Can Comcast refuse to carry a channel?]
[Even better, then Brietbart doesn't have to use sources. "We're not reporting the information, we're just reporting that Trump said it".]
[Either that or they're pitching ideas for the next season of South Park. It's hard to tell what's real anymore.]
[The guy who runs Breitbart is one of his top campaign managers, so, they're probably both coming from the same mouth. But of course, there's a media conspiracy propping up clinton. /s]
[Testing means he's trying to figure out whether they'd work or not, which implies his supporters come to their own conclusions about what he says. At this point it's clear that he's been elevated to such a high point among his supporters that he could say whatever he wanted and they'd believe him. It's the exact opposite of that bullshit he spouts sometimes about "I'm only the messenger". I doubt he planned far enough ahead to originally have the idea to spin this off into an infowars, Breitbart, alt-right, alt-reality news organisation, but he's stumbled his way into the perfect spot to create it. And he's dangerous and unethical enough to go ahead and do it despite the consequences.]
[And All Pro shit-stirrer Roger Ailes is available in Free Agency]
[Absolutely. They're setting up an even more niche media network than Fox News.]
["Even more niche" Are you saying Fox is Niche? Isn't it the most popular TV network in America?]
[>Are you saying Fox is Niche? Are you not? Fox News is *the* niche network. >Isn't it the most popular TV network in America? Not even remotely. They do well when you compare them to other *cable news* networks (CNN, HLN, MSNBC), and this is in large part due to the 55+ demographic. Fox News (and all the cable news networks) get blown out by the nightly news broadcasts from ABC, NBC, and CBS.]
[Ah. I stand corrected]
[Ok I keep seeing this thrown around, but I've never seen anything that has verified this (like out of Trump's or Bannon's own mouth). Are you just repeating rumor? If so, you should probably temper it a bit; you're coming across like it's fact.]
[how is fox niche? if Fox is niche so is CNN]

[Business Insider had a great article about how Trump broke conservative media. The whole thing is worth s read but to save a click >Some conservatives tried to fight back against Trump, pleading with their audiences to see what they contended to be the rational point of view, but their arguments seemed to go unheard. >One of the chief problems, Sykes said, was that it had become impossible to prove to listeners that Trump was telling falsehoods because over the past several decades, the conservative news media had "basically eliminated any of the referees, the gatekeepers." >"There's nobody," he lamented. "Let's say that Donald Trump basically makes whatever you want to say, whatever claim he wants to make. And everybody knows it's a falsehood. The big question of my audience, it is impossible for me to say that, 'By the way, you know it's false.' And they'll say, 'Why? I saw it on Allen B. West.' Or they'll say, 'I saw it on a Facebook page.' And I'll say, 'The New York Times did a fact check.' And they'll say, 'Oh, that's The New York Times. That's bulls---.' There's nobody - you can't go to anybody and say, 'Look, here are the facts.'" >"And I have to say that's one of the disorienting realities of this political year. You can be in this alternative media reality and there's no way to break through it," Sykes continued. "And I swim upstream because if I don't say these things from some of these websites, then suddenly I have sold out. Then they'll ask what's wrong with me for not repeating these stories that I know not to be true." >Ziegler said he faced much of the same problem. >"If you are a conservative talk show host, which I am, if you don't accept that it's likely Hillary Clinton has taken part in multiple murders, or that Barack Obama is a Muslim extremist sympathizer who was probably born outside this country - if you don't accept those two things, it's almost as if you're a sellout. You're a RINO. You're somehow part of the liberal elite. It's nuts. It's making my own show very difficult to do. It's almost where to the point where we are not able to function." >He continued: "It's almost like it's a disease, and it's taken over people. I don't remember this being the case four years ago. But something has happened. Something snapped. But now all of a sudden, if a story comes out, and it's not on Breitbart or endorsed by Drudge, it can't be true. Especially if it's about Donald Trump. Which is flat-out ludicrous." http://www.businessinsider.com/conservative-media-trump-drudge-coulter-2016-8]

[A sneak attack, see, like Trump they are also smarter than all of our generals and will orchestrate an extremely large sneak attack and just hit us without us knowing it's coming. Why aren't the generals thinking of this? Because they don't know, and there's literally no good reason why you would ever announce and upcoming battle. Just sneak attack! Trump learned all this when he was not serving and dodging the draft. He got his Purple Heart, you know?]
[It'll be a sneak attack at night. That's all you need.]
[That's a silly question. If they tell you their plan, we'll be able to defend against it. You can't broadcast your battle plans to your enemies! Duh!]
[[Brain?](https://youtu.be/2zKDQfVbWqc?t=2m7s)]
[They'll just re-watch Red Dawn (the original, not that sad, sad remake) but pretend the Soviets are really ISIL. It won't make a lot of sense, but then again neither did the film.]
[Easy...SHARIA LAW!!!]
[Across the Mexican border of course.]
[The best they could possibly hope for is to scare enough of us - those already anxious especially - to destabilize our own fundamentals. And it's not gonna work because Trump is going to be destroyed.]
[1. Build a boat. 2. Sailing lessons. 3. Guns.]
[Do we get to play Red Dawn the home game?]
[It's not supporters. Trump is running a cult and has himself become subject to all the typical cult leader delusions - super dangerous if ever in a position of power. The media, by giving him free time, (thanks Zucker) and Republican leaders have created this mess. At this point the man is dangerously delusional, or beyond reckless. He needs to step down.]
[You know what's most frustrating? Is that half the people who I've asked to explain their thought process will just get angry and start dealing petty insults. Simply asking for information is enough to incite some of these people.]
[>Is that half the people who I've asked to explain their thought process will just get angry and start dealing petty insults. You get that far with people? I ask for people to explain their thought processes constantly and mostly get ignored well before I get too many petty insults.]
[>But how will they do that? Dude, Obama founded ISIS. Cmon don't be so dense..............^.^.^/s]
[Nah man. Hillary founded ISIS. Obama was just a puppet for her to implement sharia law by placing a Muslim in office to pave the way for her more extremist Islamist policies. You really didn't know? This is common knowledge if you just turn on Fox News for a couple of minutes. Why is nobody calling hannity? He could set the record straight instantly]
[No wonder Hillary has been fighting ISIS her entire adult life.]
[Well fighting isis is one of the core responsibilities of the first lady of Arkansas after all. Along with singlehandedly fixing the tax code.]
[Actually it was her entire life. When she was a toddler she fought them]
[Yes, I remember her rousing speech like it was yesterday: "We will fight them on the high chairs, we will fight them in the play pens, we will fight them on the potty and on the see-saws and in the sandbox."]
[This is what grinds my gears about Trump supporters. " He's gonna build a wall and its gonna be ahead of schedule and underbudget" "How can we afford it?" "Mexico is gonna pay for it" "Why would Mexico pay for it? I just asked Mexico they said they're not paying for it" \*crickets*]
[He's said multiple times how he would get them to pay for it. It's listed in detail on his website.]
[Something about excess taxes on sending money from America to Mexico, which I highly doubt even being legal. I mean how do you segregate a whole country like that? Seems like you'd have to add a tax on money going to Italy or Brazil too.]
[The wall just got 10 feet taller.]
[I think the line of thought is that he'll get rid of NAFTA then tax the crap out of goods coming from Mexico to use the money to build the wall. So it's stupid on more than one level.]
[Wait, what side of the wall pays for the taxes on those goods coming stateside?..... Oh yeah.]
[Or maybe it was the other way around. Either way, we get screwed.]
["Mexico is gonna pay for it" is so sinister because its basically dog whistling and implies threatening or even using America's military superiority to impose our will a big part of his campaign can't understand that we are stronger than everyone else yet treat weaker countries with respect and dignity. such an insecure mentality and its scary and sad that so many men today are walking around with inferiority complexes]
[But, we're bigger and stronger - that means they should do what we say! That's just how the world works.]
[>yet treat weaker countries with respect and dignity Panama, Nicaragua, Cambodia, Viet Nam, Afghanistan, Iraq.]
[Yemen would like a word]
[lol Trump is the absolute embodiment of male insecurities, privileged white insecurity, etc. Just look at the poll demographics. With Obama white people could say "white people aren't just anti-obama because he his black, black people are just super pro-Obama because of his race!" but now every group - young people, latinos, blacks, asians, women - are all against trump. HMMMM maybe the white male crowd is the aberration?]
[Motherfucker never read Thucydides.]
[Those of us who have read Thucydides are a very small portion of society.]
[I'm surprised y'all can spell it correctly.]
[>"But how will they do that?" -The thought that won't make it into his supporter's brain. It will be a three pronged attack. One group will go to mexico, convert Mexicans and invade from the south. The other group will hide among refugees. Come to inner cities (which are like warzone) and start from there. The third group will dig a hole from Mosul and end up under Trump tower.]

[And every red blooded American will simultaneously grab their ankles! There will be no resistance from anyone if Lord Clinton rings her magic ISIS gong!]
[> Lord Clinton rings her magic ISIS gong! May be it is the fault of Hispanics that speaking ungrammatical English is such a major white American obsession. But is Hillary Clinton running for president or is it Bill Clinton?]
[Sorry hispanocentric smartass, [try again!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord) >The appellation "lord" is primarily applied to men, while for women the appellation "lady" is used.However, this is no longer universal: the Lord of Mann, a title currently held by the Queen of the United Kingdom, and female Lord Mayors are examples of women who are styled Lord.]
[>Sorry hispanocentric smartass, [try again!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord) My bad. I assumed that America, after becoming great again, would revert back to old times. In language, appellation, religious beliefs, witch trials and perhaps feudalism.]
[May we all put feathers in our caps and call them macaroni.]
[Wait, if the inner cities are war zones doesn't that mean they're already fortified?]
[Police stations keep getting shot up around me and I live in a mild large city surrounded by cornfields. That and the statistics from Chicago are enough to verify the war zone comments... but don't misconstrue it... fuck trump and that bible thumper pence.]
[Let's say this is all true and there is a daesh force of 50,000 trained and well equipped fighters that make a three front attack on the US. Maybe they even have some tanks and helicopters and can shut down the power grid in a few states. How in the fuck do they still stand a chance against the US Army not whipping them out in a matter of 48 hours, much less establish and maintain a theocratic government? Proves you don't have to be a kid to be afraid of a boogie man in the closet.]
[Forget attacking the US. How are they going to get their soldiers across the Atlantic? Are they going to sail on their super secret Navy?]
[>Let's say this is all true and there is a daesh force of 50,000 trained and well equipped fighters that make a three front attack on the US.

Proves you don't have to be a kid to be afraid of a boogie man in the closet. Why do you think: - Trump deflected allegations against him in 2nd debate opening by summoning ISIS? - why do you trumpets favor banning Muslims to stop ISIS attacks on American soil. Yet not a single recent mass shootings (by Muslim assailant ) would have been curbed by Trump policies. - why is Trump still hungup on Isis when by many accounts there has been great progress in reclaiming Isis territory? Because Trump and many of his supporters can't understand anything beyond two syllables. And from a strategic pov, Isis fighters fighting inside US will suffer attrition. The wars in ww2, Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan should teach us how deadly attrition can be.]
[Right, we have the same point: there is no logic in the fear of ISIS arguments. However, I don't think Trump supporters are necessarily stupid. I think that is a tricky accusation to throw around because it quickly just turns into making fun of poor rural people in general. The real issue is worldviews and emotional perspectives that are not able to evolve to accommodate globalization. And if they are not evolving they are at risk of dying...and if they feel they are at risk of dying then it follows from their point of view that something must be trying to kill them. Trump's words are logically and factually incoherent but his emotional tone is entirely consistent. His timing is lucky/unlucky because his personal self-destruction happens to synch with the cultural self-destruction of his supporters.]
[the third group better dig fast, ISIS might not control Mosul by the time Clinton's in office http://edition.cnn.com/2016/10/16/middleeast/mosul-isis-operation-begins-iraq/index.html]
[I've already had people tell me that due to statistics from surveys done in other countries where Muslims were asked whether or not they supported sharia law, if Muslims were allowed to enter our country as immigrants they would pass sharia law everywhere. I don't want to be part of this planet anymore.]
[Just point them to all the surveys that show that similar percentages of Christians in the US want to impose their religious law. Hell, evangelicals in the US are more opposed to homosexuality than our Muslim population, which is admittedly more liberal than most.]
[The thing is I don't think most of them would care because they fall into those percentages. The people who use statistics to justify racism and other discrimination don't actually care about equality. They only seem to care that their interests alone are represented. Which is really too bad because I believe strongly in equality and opportunity for everyone even if they are different from me. Even if I don't agree with their personal beliefs.]
[I'm Muslim. That's not how it works, lol.]
[Indeed. But that is how they think it will work and how they justify their hate. Really makes me sad/mad/disgusted.]
[It's somewhat concerning that Hillary wants to let more in. They are desperate, it's hell in Syria but we also have hell in our streets. Lots of homeless and working poor. We should help our own before helping foreigners.]
[If they understood the separation of church and state applies to mosques as well, perhaps they wouldn't be as worried.]

[Would you look at that, Hillary is broadcasting the Top Secret Codeword (NOFORV) for the world to see! This is proof she cannot be trusted with any information! :-|]
[why is so hard for people to understand? It amazes me, if she were a man, forget about it.]
[She looks a little shocked by it all.]
[Holy shit, I forgot about Obama's face in this photo. Stone.]
[So, should we start campaigning for the lady in the back for 2024 yet?]
[I don't see Donald Trump in that photo. Edit: Irony - the guy accused of being a secret muslim sympathizer takes out the biggest terrorist in recent American history]

[[So's the black dude to the left](https://www.reddit.com/user/PresidentObama) (though he hasn't posted for a while"]
[Imagine if you went back in time even just a couple decades and asked people to pick out the two future presidents in this photo. Obama and Hillary would be their last guesses. Just a random thought.]
[Maybe instead of focusing on "historic" presidents we actually elect a good president?]
[Is that really the only feeling you got out of what I said? Of course it's most important to elect good presidents. The historic aspect is just a bonus.]
[weve come a long way and apparently a long way still to go]
[Obama was the current president in this photo.]
[Yes, but if you time-traveled, you'd be asking them to guess two future presidents.]
[Ah, gotcha :)]
[No problemo :) Something something -joke about time travel and tenses-]
[No kidding. There are 3 people in that room who aren't white men. 2 of those 3 people are presidents. That's pretty crazy. Also why is Obama in a tiny chair in the corner?]
[One of them isn't a president unless you vote.]
[Based solely off of he people in the pic, the guy standing behind the General on /TIFU/ and dude lower right of the frame.]
[I'd say Biden as a Republican and the guy in the back next to the woman as a Democrat.]
[It's tough to say. Biden and Obama strike me as the only people who are likely to be the President when it's taken. They're among the most casually dressed, both are right up at the table, and neither of them is holding anything. The guy in the blue shirt behind the general caught my eye at first, but he's holding a document of some kind, and I doubt that the President would be. Something to ask yourself is which of the people in that picture look like they haven't had to carry keys, ID or a wallet in the last couple years?]

[Yeah, because being in a same-sex relationship is somehow derogatory. But Clinton didn't support gay marriage until a couple of years ago, so Trump is clearly the best president for the LGBT community! /s]
[I have never heard the rumor Hillary is into scissoring. I'd imagine that her sex life with Bill just doesn't exist. Who knows if it did before or after Monica, but realistically there is no coming back from what Bill did in a marriage. All I know is that Hillary once had sex, at least one time.]

[Man, I get the feeling this shits gonna keep going for a long time.]
[Just wait til he creates his own media company to cater to his rabid followers. We aren't going to be rid of Trump until probably well after he dies.]
[Unfortunately, Trump will have the ear of the media for quite a while after he looses, spinning ever more outlandish conspiracy theories. And his son appears to be a chip off the old block so we probably have years of Trumpisms to look forward to.]
[I wonder when TV networks will just refuse to broadcast his fascism. I can't wait for the day MSNBC says "Ok it used to be funny, but this shit is fucked up. We're no longer rebroadcasting Trump speeches or conducting interviews with his surrogates." His rallies attract a few thousand people, while the TV cameras give him a free audience of millions and millions. At some point you gotta refuse to help him spread his ignorance and bigotry.]
[Not covering him wouldnt be a unbiased news agency. Careful now with that fascist talk, what you are recommending is exactly that.]
[I've seen arguments for and against covering him for these remarks, honestly I don't think the media knows what to do. For what its worth, Trump directly attacking the media has caused some in the media to call him out on his dangerous remarks, but they're still broadcasting his words and sometimes letting Trump supporters duke it out on TV. That said, I think we crossed the Rubicon on covering Trump. His supporters no longer watch traditional media, so even if CNN and MSNBC unanimously decide to slam Trump relentlessly till November 8, or deny coverage, his diehards won't notice. They'll be nose deep in Breitbart and Infowars, swallowing shit from another dimension like its gospel and Trump is the prophet.]
[I'm sure if they did his campaign would cite the [Equal-Time rule](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal-time_rule), he'd threaten to sue them for not covering him, or he'd use it to make more claims that the media is rigging the election against him.]
[He's a major party candidate. They kind of have to cover him until the election is over at least.]
[The country and the world needs to know what he's saying and doing so that he can be held accountable after the fact. If he incites violence, the media coverage will be necessary to have him tried and convicted.]
[> tried and convicted. hahahaha, everything he does is to get elected. He can lie and cheat and steal, and buy his way out. You pay to play, when you lose you don't disappear.]
[Broadcasting and recording are different things.]

[His supporters are also desperate and stupid]

He does not grasp complex issues. He clearly has not thought deeply about any challenging political or economic problems. It is for this reason that he is so prone to conspiracy theories. One with more sophisticated knowledge could easily debunk them but he has no intellectual resources to do so.]
[I don't think he's ever thought deeply in his life. He has all the intellectual depth of a teaspoon.]

When you peer through that window into Trump's head, what you find is some [very damning evidence](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4546796/donald-trump-sentence) of a simple and irrational mind. >Look, having nuclear—my uncle was a great professor and scientist and engineer, Dr. John Trump at MIT; good genes, very good genes, OK, very smart, the Wharton School of Finance, very good, very smart—you know, if you’re a conservative Republican, if I were a liberal, if, like, OK, if I ran as a liberal Democrat, they would say I'm one of the smartest people anywhere in the world—it’s true!—but when you're a conservative Republican they try—oh, do they do a number—that’s why I always start off: Went to Wharton, was a good student, went there, went there, did this, built a fortune—you know I have to give my like credentials all the time, because we’re a little disadvantaged—but you look at the nuclear deal, the thing that really bothers me—it would have been so easy, and it’s not as important as these lives are (nuclear is powerful; my uncle explained that to me many, many years ago, the power and that was 35 years ago; he would explain the power of what's going to happen and he was right—who would have thought?), but when you look at what's going on with the four prisoners—now it used to be three, now it’s four—but when it was three and even now, I would have said it's all in the messenger; fellas, and it is fellas because, you know, they don't, they haven’t figured that the women are smarter right now than the men, so, you know, it’s gonna take them about another 150 years—but the Persians are great negotiators, the Iranians are great negotiators, so, and they, they just killed, they just killed us.]

[I'd say Russian dressing]
[I'd say (Julius) Caesar, the dictator.]
[Russian]
[What the fuck was that atrocity of a run-on about?]
[Seriously. I wonder what the question was. Probably had something to do with nuclear power? Can't be certain though]
[There was no question. This is not from a debate, but from one of his speeches (in this case in an allocution to supporters in Sun City, South Carolina, on July 21^st ). So, the lesson to take in here, this is the shape of his own thoughts, unsullied from reacting to the thoughts of others; his very own stream of consciousness.]
[Oh sad]
[I'm smart, people will say I'm not smart but I am. We shouldn't have made that deal with Iran because nukes are powerful now, my uncle taught me that, and uh... fellas are... doing something. And you know it's fellas cause *they* haven't realized women are smarter. Who are *they* ? *Them* obviously , now you get it? Yeah, you got it, *Them*.]
[Pretty sure he is referencing the Uranium Enrichment deal we struck with Iran recently. I wonder if these folks realize the only reason we ended up painted into a corner with Iran is becuase we fucking hamstrung ourselves via the Iraq War; which, was basically a vendetta war brought on by Bush Sr's old DoD and CIA pals that served as advisers to his son. You can also make the case that the Iraq war cost us the international clout to aggressively curtail NK's Nuclear Weapons Program. Frankly - keeping Iran from getting Nukes was a favor to Isreal. NK is much less predictable and a bigger threat to the Homeland. People like to hate on Obama - but he has done about as well as he could have given the shit show he walked into in 2008. Edit: A word.]
[Oh hell, that is all one sentence. Damn.]
[This poor girl had a brain freeze and still made much more sense: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=lj3iNxZ8Dww]
[My uncle was smart and I am smart too because we share genes. I went to Wharton and am therefore smart. I constantly have to remind people how smart I am because "they" have "done a number". If I was a democrat, I'd be hailed as a genius. My uncle explained that nuclear is powerful. 35 years ago, who would have thought that nuclear was powerful? Look at the male prisoners, and they were male because "they" haven't figured out that women are smarter - it'll take 150 years to do so - these prisoners out negotiated us because Iran are really good negotiators. That seems to be the main elements. Even put like this it's disjointed, incoherent and rambling.]
[- The power of nuclear - It's all in the messenger - Iranians]
[He's got the best words.]
[He just struggles a little to, you know, tie them together.]
[I am now dumber for having read that.]
[Damn it. I did not heed your warning and now have negative IQ points.]
[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=LQCU36pkH7c]
[Honestly, what would it take for FoxNews to just cut to and play this clip in response to one of his answers at the debate on Wednesday? Please, PLEASE! We ask for so little.]
[This is exactly what I was hoping it would be.]
[It was worse hearing it.]
[If you told me this was a quote from a subreddit simulator bot, I'd believe it. It would probably actually make me feel better.]
[[I translated this one yesterday.](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/57mxpa/trump_calls_for_drug_test_before_debate/d8tk1rm) May have made a mistake, but that's Trump for ya.]
[Even bots can string together more coherent thoughts than that load verbal diarrhea.]
[He also surrounded himself with people from the alt right news that push this type of thing. The folks that show up at his rallies agree with him and think it is true. He has created a bubble where he is winning, but everyone is against him, and if he doesn't win than ISIS takes over.]
[He says things for attention. He's not used to being told no. He's a narcissist. Etc.]
[>He's a narcissist. As mentioned by another redditor, my money is on Historionc Personality Disorder (HPD): >People with HPD have a high need for attention, make loud and inappropriate appearances, exaggerate their behaviors and emotions, and crave stimulation.[3] They may exhibit sexually provocative behavior, express strong emotions with an impressionistic style, and can be easily influenced by others. Associated features include egocentrism, self-indulgence, continuous longing for appreciation, and persistent manipulative behavior to achieve their own needs. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histrionic_personality_disorder]
[I am saying this to my friends for weeks now. Trump is used in his organization that everyone agrees with him. If not, they simple get fired and he hires a new guy. He is not used to a political system where this just does not work. He can't handle it not getting his way. This probably goes way back to his childhood. Remember he talked his dad into getting a 1 million dollar loan with zero experience.]
[That's why if by some chance he does get elected he'll probably make little to no difference domestically, he doesn't have the temperament (among other things) to form the political coalitions need to get legislation passed in a democracy. Out of frustration he'd probably turn to foreign military adventurism, the rest of the world should be very afraid of a Trump presidency.]
[Well it could work if he really becomes the dictator that so many of his supporters seem to want. Most likely won't happen though.]
[Yeah, he certainly acts like a dictator, must have read some books, oh wait, he doesn't read. Let's hope our democracy is strong to not elect dictators.]
[yea he has had it rough]
[Umm, a small million dollar loan. Get it right.]
[Picture a fat orange fish leaping easily from the water onto the beach. "I was the best at swimming!," it yells, flopping helplessly. "Why doesn't this work now? Walking is rigged!" From the other side of the island, a leathery crocodile slides onto shore with stiff practiced motions and lopes closer to eat the fish.]
[Are you a writer? This is a fantastic mini-story.]
[Magikarp of politics. I'm a Gyrados!!!!!]
[Such beautiful imagry.]
[I imagine a magikarp.]
[[It was more than one million.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/03/03/trumps-false-claim-he-built-his-empire-with-a-small-loan-from-his-father/)]
[Good article - it really shows what a lie the "self-made billionaire" image Trump likes to present is.]
[He's living in his own reality. It's crazy talk. Back in August ISIS had lost 40% of control in Iraq and 5% in Syria and is now weaker than ever before. ISIS just had to postpone their apocalypse and got their asses beaten in Dabiq which was a huge symbolic victory for their adversaries. [Let's see what happens in Mosul](http://edition.cnn.com/2016/10/16/middleeast/mosul-isis-battle-preparations/), it could be the final big battle of ISIS in Iraq. EDIT: [Battle of Mosul is happening right now](http://edition.cnn.com/2016/10/16/middleeast/mosul-isis-operation-begins-iraq/index.html).]
[In all reality, the Taliban lost 95% of it territory to the greatest modern day military in the world. So they hid in Pakistan and blended in to the population. Fast forward to today, the US is talking about negotiations with the ANA and Taliban as part of the eventual withdrawl. ISIS is an ideology, it will not be defeated with brute force, with war it would only stick around. The key to defeat is years and years of education and opportunities for the citizens. Neither Hillary or Trump has that plan. Just to defeat ISIS. Neither will be able to, the Holy war is fought over centuries.]
[Yeah if he were trying to fear monger, he should have gone with Russia, China, Iran ect. or someone with an actual army with ships and tanks. ISIS's primary weapon is a homemade bomb. It sucks for Mosul, but it's not like ISIS forces are going to cross the Atlantic.]
[What is actually going on - on the ground - in syria and Iraq is so important but most trump supporters have absolutely no idea what is going on.]
[Exactly. They're to busy being hateful.]
[> He's living in his own reality. i think it's more to the point to say that he has rejected the external world of verifiable facts. and i think he has a following of people who have done the same.]
[He has rejected this reality and substituted his own.]
[Wow, I had heard operations to clear Mosul had begun, but how did it not make more news that they lost Dabiq! That's their battle of Armageddon. They have to be so terrified.]
[lol they lost da biq? Are they gonna change the name of the magazine?]
[They lost it quickly and without much of a fight to Turkish backed sunni FSA units too lol]
[Yeah, they ended up claiming that this battle for Dabiq was not actually the apocalyptic battle, that will happen sometime in the future. They're a bit like a cult that declares that the world will end in 20-whatever, and then when 20-whatever rolls on and nothing happens, they push the date back.]
[that is odd but it happened not that long ago. It has been in some media outlets: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/16/turkish-opposition-fighters-syria-dabiq-islamic-state http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/isis-dabiq-loses-apocalyptic-prophesy-town-of-dabiq-to-syria-rebels-short-battle-a7363931.html https://www.ft.com/content/eb698d34-93a9-11e6-a1dc-bdf38d484582?tagToFollow=YjcwMThlYjQtYzQyOC00NWU1LTkyNTEtMDVmMTYxYWI5MDM4-VG9waWNz http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3840862/Turkish-backed-rebels-capture-symbolically-important-Syrian-town-Dabiq-ISIS.html]
[I'm trying to figure out who he is trying to appeal to. All of his most strident supporters believe this and will likely show up to vote. This makes him look absolutely crazy to every one else and encourages them to show up and vote against him.]
["Appeal"? Only *weak* people have to appeal to others. Trump just tells it like it is! That's how he's going to Make America Great Again! ^^/s]
[after the first debate its about base turnout]
[Playing the long game]
[Future viewers of Breitbart News Network (a Trump company).]
[>All of his most strident supporters believe this and will likely show up to vote. He wants more than their vote. He wants their loyalty when he refuses to make a concession speech and demands that her inauguration be cancelled and protested. And probably a lot more after that as well. He's making sure that Republican voters will never accept an election result that isn't in their favor again.]
[He's just lashing out and trying to protect his fragile little narccistic ego. There is no strategy. He is too unhinged for that. [Watch this 10 minute interview with O'Reilley](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/10/12/trump-on-ryan-dont-want-his-support-dont-care-about-his-support.html) and tell me he has a strategy.]
[He knows he's going to lose. Now he's just inciting insurrection.]
[That's basically what he's doing, right? How is he able to say shit like that? I mean legally speaking, how is that any different that telling "FIRE" in a movie theater? He's intentionally trying to stir up a panic, it's gotten people hurt, and it's going to get someone killed. I know this is /R/politics so civil discussion is probably unlikely, but seriously, how can he be doing this?]
[He's doing everything he can to salvage his brand. In this case it's a retreat into the alt right to set up a media operation with Ailes and Bannon. It seems like a crazy idea, but it's less crazy than thinking he will get people out to vote with this shit. And it's the only way his ego can survive.]
[that's really going to make america great again. /s]
[As though that's a genuine interest of his]
[That, and filling the airwaves with even more crazy so that it's hard for the rest of us to keep track of what is bad with him. Although idk if that's intentional.]
[All he's got left is fear-mongering. He knows he can hold on to his base if he keeps beating that horse. There are actually people who believe this stuff.]
[He's setting up his supporters to believe that if he loses, the Republic is finished anyway, so they might as well try to take over by force. I'm convinced of this.]
[I agree I mean look how he handled the Mitt Romney loss. [He tried to incite a REVOLUTION] (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/08/02/in-2012-donald-trump-suggested-that-the-result-was-rigged-he-warned-of-the-same-thing-this-week/?0p19G=c) . He didn't even have an investment in that campaign! Imagine the alt - right trying to start a revolution, just because Donald wasn't happy he lost.]
[And how is this good for us or in the interest of anyone but Trump? What an ass.]
[That's the nature of a sociopath.]
[Its good that it brings these people out into the open. No more hiding behind a 'dont tread on me' bumper sticker. Go march on the White House with your 2nd amendment militia you fucking turds.]
[This guy just insists on doubling down in his craziness.]
[Trump's doubled down so many times that we're only a few more orders of magnitude away from the accumulated craziness collapsing into a black hole and devouring our solar system.]
[Maybe he's really crazy? 70 years old with a family history of Alzheimer's. Just sayin']
[Nah man. Go look at all the crazy shit he's been saying and doing for the last 25 years. Sadly, he just sucks.]
[Early onset Alzheimer's then? Lol]
[Alzheimer's has been known to trigger in younger patients. There has to be some reason for this madness. If not Alzheimer's, then I'm betting he was dropped on the head as a baby. Repeatedly.]
[He was raised by an inheritance and inherited along with it an unearned sense of self importance. He regularly and proudly exhibits signs of superiority complex and narcissistic personality. He's been surrounded by yes men all his life, including his current political support which he has scraped deep into the vile bottom of a barrel to mobilize.]
[His dad was pretty much a monster and the reason his brother took up alcoholism then ended up dying young. I imagine this has caused quite a impact to Trumps mental state he was raised on you win or you die the reason his brother was cut out of Fred Trumps will.]
[Watch the Frontline about him - dude's an absolute sociopath.]
[This asshole is quadrupling down on the idiotic right-wing narrative that has been going on since Obama got elected. To them, people like Obama and Clinton are LITERALLY trying to destroy the country. They're out of their fucking minds and Trump is just further pushing them on these narratives.]
[eh- It's been going on longer than Obama. They spent years trying to impeach Clinton- after 4 years of 'investigations' they found out he got a blow job.]
[The Republican nominee is saying that a few thousand illiterate yokels on the other side of the world are going to take over the most powerful nation in the history of the human species if his opponent is elected. Just think about that the next time someone says "both sides are the same".]
[This is demagoguery 101]
[Clearly he doesn't have a high opinion of the capabilities of the US military!]
[He's insulted our military. Seems to think he'd do better. Even though he doged the draft for a bad ankle.]
[I wish it was possible to convey to scared old white people in flyover country how little ISIS really cares about them.]
[it isn't, post 9/11 there were local news segments that later got aired about how important every small town in America was an important target. Fear sells. Ironic that at that time, most of the people buying that bullshit were wearing "No Fear" t-shirts.]
[As of right now, the Iraq military is pushing out the dying ISIS from Mosul. Man, his timing is fucking impeccable. Like when he finally flip flopped on the wall the same day that book came out saying that it was the one thing he would never flip flop on.]
[This is going to be a long offensive. Mark my word.]
[I think Luxembourg is more likely to invade and conquer the United States. Then Vatican City. Leichentstein. The Conch Republic. The Cenation. Then Isis.]
[>I think Luxembourg is more likely to invade and conquer the United States. [Fear them!] (https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/luxembourg-world-conquest-by-1947.951920/)]
[Its Lichtenstein. *Leichen* would translate into *corpse(s)*.]
[It's actually *Liechtenstein*.]
[If I can conquer the world as Luxembourg in Hearts of Iron, I see no reason why Luxembourg can't invade and conquer the United States!]
[Funnily enough, I wrote a novel in 2012 about a militarized Luxembourg, financed by the United States, going to war with an Islamified Belgium in the wake of the EU's dissolution.]
[Was it called "The Grand Terrarium of Huggy Bear"?]
[I'd read that.]
[What's the book called? It sounds cool!]
[It's not published, but I'd be willing to send a Google Docs link over PM to anyone interested.]
[If you think that sounds cool I recommend you watch an old movie called "the mouse that roared" – it's a Peter Sellers film.]
[Trump's Daily Foreign Policy Briefing]
[Clearly you are not aware of the unstoppable powerhouse that is the Isis Navy!!]
[Cenation is a true threat. An invisible leader.]
[Even worse, they never give up.]
[Alright, let's talk about the Islamic State. The Islamic State is not a threat to the United States. It isn't close to being a threat. It isn't close to being close to being a threat. "Take over the US" isn't in their 5 year plan. There is no reason to be scared of ISIS. There is no reason to believe you or those you love have a significant chance to be hurt or killed by ISIS. [8 months ago, ISIS was pegged at 18,000-25,000 members.](https://www.rt.com/usa/331355-islamic-state-fighters-numbers/) That number is almost certainly lower now. If ISIS was the main priority of the United States military, then we would be living in the most peaceful period of modern history. This is a "threat" we can deal with less than 5,000 boots on the ground. [Currently we've killed 15,000 ISIS members for each US soldier.](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/isis-islamic-state-us-american-soldier-how-many-deaths-killed-iraq-syria-a7226061.html) This is PURE media fear-mongering. ISIS isn't radicalizing people in the US, and they even if they were they wouldn't be a threat. All they do is take credit for those that are self-radicalizing due at least partially to toxic environment we are creating. Here are some REAL threats. The numbers are given of units of ISIS, ie a value of 1 would be equal to the deaths to ISIS per year. Cause | # of times more dangerous than ISIS ---|--- Ischemic heart disease | 19381 Cerebrovascular disease (Stroke) | 14812 Respiratory infections | 10661 Lower respiratory tract infections | 10444 HIV/AIDS | 7465 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease | 7381 Perinatal conditions | 6628 Diarrhea diseases | 4837 Tuberculosis | 4218 Malaria | 3414 Lung cancer | 3347 Road traffic accidents | 3197 Childhood diseases | 3029 Diabetes mellitus | 2661 Hypertensive heart disease | 2444 Suicide | 2343 Stomach cancer | 2293 Cirrhosis of the liver | 2109 Nephritis/nephropathy | 1824 Colorectal cancer | 1674 Liver cancer | 1657 Measles | 1640 Violence | 1506 Maternal conditions | 1372 Congenital abnormalities | 1322 Breast cancer | 1289 Esophageal cancer | 1205 Inflammatory heart disease | 1088 Alzheimer's disease and other dementias | 1071 Falls | 1054 Drowning | 1021 Poisoning | 937 Lymphomas, multiple myeloma | 904 Rheumatic heart disease | 887 Oral and oropharynx cancers | 854 Fires | 837 Pertussis | 787 Prostate cancer | 720 Leukemia | 703 Peptic ulcer disease | 703 Protein-energy malnutrition | 703 Endocrine/nutritional disorders | 653 Asthma | 653 Cervical cancer | 636 Pancreatic cancer | 619 Tetanus | 569 Sexually transmitted diseases excluding HIV/AIDS | 485 Bladder cancer | 485 Meningitis | 469 War | 469 Syphilis | 418 Neoplasms other than malignant | 402 Ovarian cancer | 368 Iron deficiency anemia | 368 Tropical diseases excluding malaria | 351 Epilepsy | 335 Musculoskeletal diseases | 285 Hepatitis B | 285 Parkinson's disease | 268 Alcohol use disorders | 251 Drug use disorders | 234 Upper respiratory infections | 201 Skin diseases | 184 Uterine cancer | 184 Melanoma and other skin cancers | 184 Hepatitis C | 151 Leishmaniasis | 134 Trypanosomiasis | 134 Benign prostatic hyperplasia | 84 There are three existential threats to the US: Russia, China, and global warming. The last is primarily a human issue, as we've seen how we deal with 10,000 refugees. What happens when a billion people are displaced from rising waters and another half billion have to deal with water shortages? That's the threat of global warming. When the media or a candidate talk as if ISIS is the USSR, they are either horribly ignorant or acting to deliberately exploit people's fears to push their favored policies. Neither is acceptable.]
[> The last is primarily a human issue While the first two are entirely a human issue. We can resolve our differences with both Russia and China, provided we can stay rational.]
[Saving. Mic-drop for all future stupid fucking arguments about this. Thank you!]
[I would just like to point out that even with those stats on diseases, we are actually healthier than we have ever been. The only growing stats are all self inflicted (suicide, drug addiction) and believing crazy shit doesn't help those.]
[Scrolled up from the bottom of the list. Thought you were giving odds on what medical problem Trump was gonna blame for dropping out of the race. Am kinda disappointed....]
[Half man, half bear, half scientist.]
[I'm totally cereal]
[> What happens when a billion people are displaced from rising waters and another half billion have to deal with water shortages? That's the threat of global warming. Not to mention the diseases that will come from it. Well said. People that act like they are worried about ISIS are full of it.]
[>Repeatedly predicting dire consequences if he loses the election, Trump said at one point that "our country has never been so low" and "I'm ashamed with what's happened to our country, and so are you." He thinks he can tell people how they feel. That only works on your brain dead supporters, Trump.]
[Actually, telling people how they feel is a very effective manipulation. It's like the sales technique where you start people saying yes on one thing after another. Eventually you go for the close and they will still say yes. Notice how he usually only ends with the phrases "so are you" or whatever. It's a sales technique that is useful in all sorts of people. Intelligent or not, we are predictable.]
[>"I'm ashamed with what's happened to our country, and so are you." Well, this is one of the first things he's said, I agree with. I am ashamed that we ever got this far.]
[The irony is that if Romney was prez they'd all be preaching how great everything is right now. "Look, unemployment is 5%! The Dow is at an all time high! Violent crime is lowest in decades! Aren't we great?!"]
[Tell me what to *do* -- not at all cool, and I shall resist merely on principle. Tell me what to *think* -- lotsa luck; such an individual is thenceforth permanently ignored. Tell me what to *feel* -- W T bleeding F . . . ?]
[I'm willing to eat my hat if you don't hear that exact phrase from his supporters 10 times in the next week.]
[> "our country has never been so low" You have indeed a very, very bad reputation abroad right now. But hey, spoiler alert : it's in part due to Trump's rhetoric. How ironic !]
[Our country has never been so low? I dunno, the early 1860s were a little rough.]
[This man is a disgrace to the United States of America. People need to vote down this moron. Enough is enough. All sane rational people need to get out and vote and end this dangerous bullshit.]
[So you're blaming Donald for a GOP state HQ getting bombed? That makes zero sense.]
[>This man is a disgrace to the United States of America. If there is a single violent incident on voting day incited by moronic self righteous poll watchers Trump should be charged with domestic terrorism and shipped to Gitmo....like he argues terrorists deserve.]
[uhhhhm.. all the violence this entire political season (thousands of acts) has come from the left. 100 to 1, left vs right. You've been a little sheltered if you think Trump is "inciting" any of his followers to go and be violent. He was blamed for causing leftists to react violently, even. HuffPo published "a violent reaction to trump is as rational as any". Hilarious.]
[Did you just say there have been thousands of acts of violence during this election cycle?]
[Yes. I have been paying very close attention to the entire phenomenon. old guy hit with a crowbar in a parking lot for trump shirt.. Some guy's teeth smashed up in a bathroom for trump hat.. guy hit in the head with a rock after rally.. even cars keyed and sprayed.. it's bloody Brownshirts all over again. It's no surprise r/politics doesn't highlight any of this. Watching this all go down from the UK has been shocking. I'd be scared to wear a Trump hat over there, as I'm sure many are.]
[Oh so you're not even American then....]
[*A wild xenophobe appears!*]
[Sorry you took it that way champ.]
[>uhhhhm.. all the violence this entire political season (thousands of acts) has come from the left. 100 to 1, left vs right. Which left leader is encouraging supporters to punch people in the face? Or courting white supremacists with Twitter support? Who is de-legitimizing elections without a shred of proof? > You've been a little sheltered if you think Trump is "inciting" any of his followers to go and be violent. - So what is this poll watching about? Is it a quip? -What is this threat of jailing political opponent? That is faith in laws? -Hiring a British pedo- pimp as a character reference ? That is good character? > He was blamed for causing leftists to react violently, even. HuffPo published "a violent reaction to trump is as rational as any". Hilarious. A rational reaction is not necessarily always the right reaction. For example - " the urge to label Trump as a sex offender is as rational as any"... But 2e can't because there is a legal due process. Here are some hilarious remarks for contrast. -Global conspiracy to destroy white America. -defending sexual assault allegations by berating women's looks? - constantly encouraging Nazi symbolism and becoming the darling of neo-nazis.]
[I notice in your mis-characterising of *everything* there, and the blatant lies/mis-information, to muddy my point, you did not dispute my point. All the violence has come from the left. 100:1. It sounds to me like you're justifying it just because bernie didn't say to do the things they have done. He did say repeatedly though we have to take a stand and fight, and never once did Hillary or Bernie tell their people to stop. Again, my point: all the violence has come from the left. Thousands of acts of violence.]
[Source that's its 100:1?]
[Oh, that'd be sweet poetic justice. "Yeah Trump, we don't tolerate terrorism and you're one of the biggest terrorists we've ever seen."]
[He also says that the family members of terrorists are fair game to go after too so...]
[I can sort of agree with it if they are looking the other way while their son or daughter is up to no good. That's tough to prove that the family was complicit though.]
[It will probably start by some ignorant racist white boys getting the piss beaten out of them for hassling old black ladies. Then the cowardly white supremacists will shit themselves, then we'll have real violence]
[A handful of pro Trump tough guys in Miami or Philly go to intimidate... they're gonna see a wall of black and brown and I'm guessing they will shrink away. I'm guessing they've never seen that before. I know for sure that they are cowards. Let's all hope there's no violence.]
[Yeah, the funny thing about intimidation is it often works out different than you think it might.]
[They wont do shit. They are really vocal on the internet but are pussies IRL, especially when they don't have the advantages of numbers, guns, and a government that supports their actions. This isn't the 1950s and if these assholes try this, they will learn that real fast.]
["How stupid is our country?" - Donald Trump]
[It's unusual for the answer to a question to also be the citation of the question.]
["I'm about to find out." -his inner monologue immediately after saying that]
[Can someone please take a timeout now, and send Trump to a psychiatric and medical evaluation. *Please?* We can just hold everything meanwhile, media blackout on election, postpone the election a few days so he doesnt loose any time campaigning if it turns out he is (I cant believe I'm saying this:) healthy afterall, both camps hold off on campaigning, freeze everything...but get the man to a doctor. He is clearly not well. I dont care if the cause is narcotics, psychiatric or medical, but Get. Him. Help.]
[Try sending him. Snickers first. Enough for 2 an hour till forever.]
[Wow, that's insanely stupid. But, unsurprising since he knows his crowd. They're terrified of things like ISIS when the police are guilty of killing more Americans any other force in the world, year in and year out. That said, I encourage Donald to continue to preach to his choir and make no effort to appear reasonable or moderate to anyone. Reasonable and Moderate is for pussies.]
[>They're terrified of things like ISIS when the police are guilty of killing more Americans any other force in the world I understand what you're saying, but this is a total false equivalency. It's wholly reasonable to be more afraid of the myriad of dangers presented by ISIS, and more broadly Islamic extremism, than it is to be afraid of the police.]
[No, it's not. You're more likely to do doing mundane daily bullshit than by Islamic terrorism. It's not reasonable to fear Islamic terrorism more than your morning commute to work. It's just fear mongering about the bogeyman.]
[[removed]]
[Well, let's just say that I am white for funsies -- that is incredibly racist.]
[Nothing racist about it. A black person would ridicule the mere suggestion that they should be more threatened by ISIS than the police.]
[I'm not white But now I'm white because I have the wrong opinions? And this is progressive? I'm either high on hallucinogens or in /r/politics]
[Ignoring institutional racism that affects a large part of the population is also incredibly short-sighted. You're taking it from your own perspective. Try being black and getting pulled over every other week. Look at the stats. The risk of being hurt by ISIS doesn't even come close to the risk of being shot by the police, especially if you're black.]
[It's rich that you're worried about institutional racism as you both insult and disregard my opinion solely on the basis of my skin color -- as if the content of my ideas didn't matter, just what color I am. You are not actually interested in engaging my ideas, you only want to call me names and dogmatically rant about things you know nothing about. What's funny is that I'm not white; I'm the son of two educated Sudanese-Christian immigrants who narrowly escaped persecution under Sunni Islam. YOU are the racist; my skin color shouldn't matter. You say you're worried about institutional racism but the only place I can find it is all around us -- permeating our culture -- a culture that constantly demonizes white people for no other reason than being white. How dare YOU deny my opinion. You talk about privilege of skin color when there are only two discernable, quantifiable privileges: economic privilege the privilege of having two married parents, which is closely tied with SES privilege. Besides that, it is the decisions an individual makes that set them up for a virtuous, non-poverty stricken life, i.e. making a pattern of repeatedly making good decisions that will compound on each other. You tell me to look at the stats, but it is precisely because I have already done that, with the express goal of understanding the plight of American blacks, that I cannot accept the narrative-driven drivel of perpetual victimhood being posited. If you're looking for systemic bias then here's some: [Adjusting for population size, blacks are not more likely to be shot than whites, but whites more than blacks.](http://www.nber.org/papers/w22399.pdf) That is, even though cops would be justified in firing upon armed blacks more than they would whites, they don't. Because I know that race matters to you more than facts, these figures are from a black economist out of Harvard in 2016. Indeed if blacks, who get pulled over at an average annual rate of 13%, want to lower their chances of getting pulled over, then the black community ought to pull together and discuss how to lower crime in their communities so one day it may match the white rate, which is 10% annually. In fact, for the amount of crimes committed by such a small group, they are statistically underrepresented in terms of what % should be pulled over annually, especially when you consider that [they're twice as likely to speed.](http://www.city-journal.org/html/racial-profiling-myth-debunked-12244.html) The notion that blacks get longer sentences for the same crime because of institutional inequity is wholly [false.](http://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/research-and-publications/research-projects-and-surveys/miscellaneous/15-year-study/chap4.pdf) In fact, the whole BLM and/or social justice narrative about black persecution at the hands of white institutional racism totally falls apart under any modicum of scrupulous investigation. What else? Crack sentencing? Drafted by black legislators who were tired of watching their communities get ravaged by a crack epidemic. Hands up don't shoot? The full fury of a biased DOJ investigation couldn't muster up any signs of racism with regards to the officer's actions. Fuck you; I am black and I'm pro equality, not the sanctimonious, condescending preaching that holds blacks to lower standards than other groups. That is racist. YOU ARE a RACIST.]
[That's a silly comment to make.]
[What color is your skin?]
[Not if you're black]
[Coward. The Brits were less afraid of the fucking Luftwaffe than most Americans are of terrorism.]
[I'm afraid of a violent, hateful, backwards Islam, yes.]
[Then you're a coward.]
[Haha okay tough guy.]
[I'm not trying to be mean, I'm serious. The risk is almost nothing. Even if you live in a big city, where they actually target, your odds of being at a terrorist attack are the same order of magnitude as a lightning strike. If you are most afraid of Islamic terrorism, you are a coward. Textbook.]
[You purposely snuck the word most in there to try and make your argument more valid. No, that's not what I fear most. But I definitely do fear the influence they have had. It doesn't matter if I'm as likely to get struck by lighting because we can't fight lightning. We can fight Islamist extremism and we should so things like Boston and Orlando don't happen. Do you think those people expected to be killed by Islamist extremists?]
[We can fight lightning. They're called lightning arrestors. No really, I've lived in cities struck by regular, serious attacks. Americans are being incredibly cowardly about all this.]
[Not all Americans. Just the ones who listen to and believe Trump.]
[I wish they would use their influence to ensure the grocery store has some decent baba ganoush.]
[Word]
[I don't think someone who believes ISIS is an actual threat would ever know what the Luftwaffe is and why it would be relevant to British citizens.]
[That's...a really good point.]
[Why? You stand a much much much greater chance of dying at the hands of a police officer than you are of dying at the hands of any terrorist, much less an Islamic terrorist from ISIS. This is very much akin to cowering in a hole full of snakes rather than walk through a rain storm because you're terrified of getting hit by lightning.]
[>You stand a much much much greater chance of dying at the hands of a police officer than you are of dying at the hands of any terrorist Sure, but this is only overwhelmingly true if you're not law-abiding and/or acting belligerently, otherwise, not really. The killing at the hands of Islamic extremism is of a totally different nature; it is unpredictable; it is wholly unjust, and no one knows when, where, or how it could happen, only that, statistically speaking, with enough people from certain regions of the world, when given enough time, there is a degree of certainty that attacks will happen. Islam's presence cultivates a culture of fear. Islam is, ideologically speaking, diametrically opposed to the virtues we appreciate in the West, e.g. liberty, nonviolence, and rule of law. Aside from the different nature of the killing, there are many reason's to be worried about the aforementioned culture that Islam perpetuates. Muhammad himself a warlord pedophile, and a scripture rife with violence and imperialistic yearnings, it is no wonder that Britain's most famous Imams are known for their demagoguery pertaining to the usurpation of democracy in order to install Sharia government.]
[> Sure, but this is only overwhelmingly true if you're not law-abiding and/or acting belligerently, otherwise, not really. I'm gonna dispute that just on principle. Seen too many videos, heard of too many cases that prove that wrong. And, bear in mind, there's never ever been an attack by ISIS on American soil. The same can't be said of Christian fundamentalists or radical political terrorists, such as the attack on the IRS building in OKC. The fear of ISIS is ungrounded and without reason and it's astoundingly surreal when you consider the very real threats that already surround us.]
[The fear of ISIS is ungrounded? Tell that to the families of the Orlando victims. The shooter pledged allegiance to ISIS.]
[He wasn't a member of ISIS though, a small but important distinction, and he killed fifty out of three hundred and twenty million Americans. Police, heart disease, and car crashes kill hundreds of thousands more people than that, per year.]
[> The shooter pledged allegiance to ISIS. He pledged allegiance to a whole bunch of groups, some of whom are at war with each other. He pledged allegiance to Hezbollah, for example, who is in direct conflict with ISIS, and directly help the Assad government. They're basically in a similar position as the Russians.]
[> The shooter pledged allegiance to ISIS. And Hezbollah, don't forget.]
[Im not the person you replied to, It's not unfounded, it's overblown. Purely statistics wise, Deaths from Islamic terrorism is behind deaths by Furniture accidents in Europe and the USA, the dresser in your bedroom literally is more likely to kill you or a family member then someone who has pledged allegiance to ISIS, and between the two they are both about as likely to bring down the US government. No it doesn't mean something shouldn't be done about it, It doesn't mean it wasn't a horrific event, it doesn't mean attacks don't or won't happen. But the fear and reaction towards it is overblown, It can hardly constitute a threat to the average person let alone the country as a whole. Things can be done, but acting like it's the end of western civilization if we don't wage total war on Islam is just a bit extreme.]
[I certainly agree it's overblown. People who support Trump think it's legitimately the biggest threat to our country which is definitely ridiculous, but some people in this thread are acting like it's not a problem at all.]
[Difference is, if policy kill you they have a reason for doing so 9.5/10 times, almost always for a reason you could have avoided. A victim of terrorism is innocent 10/10.]
[No, it's not. I'm willing to bet that your odds of being killed by a cop in America are 1000x higher than being killed by ISIS or Islamic terrorism.]
[So I shouldn't fear Islamic extremism, then?]
[Are you serious? I mean of course it happens, but realistically you should be more afraid of domestic terrorists or random criminals. And even then, very few of the attacks on US soil were actually affiliated with terrorists groups. Most are just nutsos who latch on to an ideology to justify their delusions. They usually aren't devout Muslims. There was a great article recently about how IS was attracting "normal" criminals rather than longtime Muslims with extreme views. The Paris shooters, for instance, were career criminals who joined IS because it was more lucrative than their previous endeavors.]
[You should fear whatever you want. The main things you should fear are things like driving, drinking, drowning, etc. The odds of you dying because of ISIS is just asinine because it would be like getting struck by lightning. But hey, live in fear all you want.]
[About as much as you fear meteors and brain-eating amoebas. When was the last time you checked the sky before leaving the house? Here's a good blog post (with sources) that discusses it: [You’re 55 Times More Likely to be Killed by a Police Officer than a Terrorist](http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2015/03/youre-55-times-likely-killed-police-officer-terrorist.html). I overestimated.]
[Maybe if you're armed and refuse to listen to police]
[Nope, just in general, I know you're far more likely to die from a cop than ISIS.]
[Or black and unarmed.]
[You are more likely to die by falling out of bed then be killed by ISIS]
[So I shouldn't fear Islamic extremism, then?]
[No, you shouldn't fear it, you should identify the specific problems and solve them. Islamic crime in the US is less of a problem than car accidents or shooting deaths. Acting in fear is a great way to lose site of actual solutions. The War in Drugs is a prime example of this phenomenon. Some would say the "war" on guns is the same way. Extermination never works.]
[Not even a little bit]
[You can fear it if you want, but its not rational and it won't make you any safer]
[Fear of Islam is not rational nor will it make me safe? I better tell my cousins in Paris that! I'm sure that the culture of fear of even going out at night will disappear as soon as they learn that Islam doesn't have to be feared! Pfft, it's not like any recent events there have made people overly cautious and fearful when doing even the most mundane daily activities. Thanks so much!]
[Do you live in a major city in the US or Europe? If not, you have less than nothing to be afraid of. If you do live in a major city, you still have almost nothing to be afraid of.]
[You shouldn't fear Islam. If you insist on fearing something, then fear extremists or mentally unstable people. None of your fears will amount to anything though. Should the parents of Sandy Hook victims fear white suburban kids? The are a billion Muslims in the world. Are you going to live your life in fear of them all? Or will you be more reasonable and realize it's just a tiny amount of crazy people to fear, as it has been for all time.]
[As a parisian I've not seen this culture of fear, there is mourning and also concern about terrorism in general, but no one is afraid of going out and the city's nightlife has been a blast this summer . They killed 80 people including oeople I know and that makes me sad and very angry but this is a city of 12 millions people so Im not going to freak out]
[It's rational to want to neutralise Islamic extremism, the point is that there are much bigger issues. I support efforts to neutralise it, but here in Europe other things are far more likely to kill you prematurely, and there's a bigger gulf in the US given you guys have much higher crime rates than us.]
[Is trump running for mayor of Paris too? How did we get to here in the conversation?]
[1. The US is a different situation then France. 2. Its still unlikely, and again fear is not going to help you. Do you live in fear of being killed by a gas leak in your house or getting hit by a car as you cross the street? Probably not, even though those things are statistically far more likley to happen. What you do is you take proper precautions and support policies that will alleviate these problems. Same with dealing with terror attacks]
[1. It will be if Hillary successfully raises Muslim immigration from places like Syria by over 500%. Actually it will be just like France, arguably worse. 2. Listen mate, I look both ways before crossing a road because I don't want to walk into traffic. If I smell gas in my house I investigate to make sure. If Western Europe is infested by rampant terrorism and real sexual misconduct because refugees are unvetted and refuse violently to assimilation then I don't want any part of that in my country. The policy I support is to pause immigration from these war torn islamic states until they can be vetted 100%. That is Trumps policy. Increasing immigration from those same states by more than 500% is criminal insanity in my honest opinion. Your response to terriorism seems to be 'eh, it probably won't happen to me so why worry about it'. I implore you to rethink that position and recognize it's implications on the world for future generations if it continues to grow.]
[But they are vetted. The US currently has one of if not the most stringent immigration and refugee policies on the planet. Trump and his supporters act like we're just blindly letting people in when in fact we screen and rescreen and just for good measure rescreen again everyone who enters the country as a refugee. Ask anyone who has immigrated here from another country what an insanely difficult and complicated process it is. Coming in as a refugee is significantly more difficult. To claim we're just "letting people in" is laughable. Trump's position is nonsensical. I suspect he has no idea what our actual immigration policies are, despite the fact that his own wife is an immigrant. You know who would love for us to put a stop to letting in immigrants and refugees from war torn countries? ISIS. That's their mother fucking tax base sitting in Greece and Turkey. One of the (many) reasons they're currently on the ropes is that the people they were dependent on to supply funds for their war are fleeing in droves. They want people to stay put under their control.]
[If by live in fear you mean I purchase smoke detectors and pay attention to safety ratings when I purchase a car and make sure to look both ways before i cross the street then ya I guess I do live in fear. Being pragmatic about the threat radical Islam poses is something our government is doing and it's the reason it hasn't been to chaotic, you know minus the Orlando and San Bernardino shootings and the so on and so forth. Being realistic about the violence in Islamic culture doesn't mean were rolling around on the floor crying in a puddle of our own piss dude.]
[Torture and the deliberate targeting of women and children are not pragmatic responses to terrorism. Those are fear driven suggestions that will only make things worse]
[People in Paris are afraid to go out at night? I better tell my cousins in Paris that! They and their friends must look like a bunch of idiots in empty bars and clubs!]
[I feel like you and I are taking crazy pills with the response we're getting.]
[How is it not rational? Are we already forgetting Orlando? They definitely have an influence that has led to the murder of Americans on our own soil. To claim there's nothing to fear is ridiculous.]
[> Are we already forgetting Orlando? Orlando, with the guy who claimed allegiance to al-Qaeda, Hezbollah, and ISIL at the same time? The guy who the CIA couldn't find any links to ISIL?]
[How is it not rational? Because it is extraordinarily unlikely to ever impact you or anybody that you know. You might as well fear the heat-death of the universe.]
[A friend of mine who lives in Orlando lost a friend in that shooting so it's already affected someone I know. How can you brush off the concerns as irrational when the influence has led to attacks on American soil? Even if it didn't directly affect someone I know, the fact is it is affecting people.]
[And how can these guys dismiss the fact that a Clinton victory will cause the heat-death of the universe?]
[Finally, someone asking the important questions.]
[Everything affects people. Because there are six billion of us here on Earth. Three hundred million in the United States. People die from spider bites. They die from fallen coconuts. Hell, one man died from bubonic plague in Utah last year.]
[What are you even talking about now? Spiders and coconuts don't work in a coordinated effort to influence other spiders and coconuts to kill Americans. ISIS does.]
[You couldn't be more wrong. We know theres a problem, it's easily solved, but you refuse to recognize a growing problem because you don't know anyone who's died? Go say that to a family member of a victim of 9/11 or Boston Marathon or Orlando. The list goes on and on. You must be asleep.]
[Well that's a silly thing to say. I could always be more wrong. To start with, I could be wrong at all. But I'm not. After all: Why don't you speak to the families of the four men who died of bubonic plague last year? You should be terrified of the bubonic plague.]
[It's not rational because it means you should actually fear falling out of bed first. Since I assume you aren't in fear of that, it can be deemed irational.]
[Beds are not working toward influencing other beds to kill Americans. ISIS is working toward influencing Islamists to kill Americans.]
[Well, by this definition (see other comment btw), bed manufacturers are conspiring to kill American people, since they know people will fall from beds. A reasonable policy would be to enforce use of straight on the floor beds or futtons. This can be extended to anything man-made that is not oriented towards 100% safety and his then objectively a statistical conspiracy to kill people. Real argument : criminals conspire everyday to rob, kill, etc. But despite this coordinate effort against you as a citizen, you go outside everyday. The chance you get robed or killed is higher by regular crime. Also, if you consider mosquitos, there is objectively a coordinated effort to kill humans as mosquito bite us on purpose as a group (by instinct or not, doesn't matter) and actually kill more people. And those are the silly arguments.]
[My lord]
[How does fearing it above all other threats help anyone? Terrorism is a problem, one of many problems, and needs to be addressed with carefully considered policies. Knee-jerk reactionary policies are exactly what terrorists are trying to provoke.]
[I said nothing about policy. I said it's rational to fear the influence ISIS can have. You say it's a real problem that needs to be addressed with thought out policy, but brush off the concerns as irrational. That's contradictory.]
[Concerns are totally rational. its excessive fear that is irrational]
[Agreed. I used the word fear and people are jumping on it as if I'm insanely paranoid.]
[How about this. *You* can live in fear and hide in your compound with all of your guns and shit while *we* will keep living life because the odds of being killed by ISIS is near 0.]
[See, you're making my concern as some sort of active action. I don't walk around fearing Islamist extremism, but I certainly recognize that it's a problem. The victims in Boston and Orlando may have had a low probability of being killed, but they were. It's happened and I don't know why people are pretending it's not a problem. Oh and I don't own any guns.]
[Again, the only policy put forward by either candidate that seems to have any thought behind it whatsoever is Trumps. I'd love to change my mind, but no one has convinced me I'm wrong.]
[How can you even say that though? Extreme vetting? We don't even know what extreme vetting means. Not to mention refugees in particular already have extremely thorough screening processes. Build a wall? Not only will that not work who's gonna pay for it? It's asinine. Everything he's put forward from tax policies to foreign policies are just asinine!]
[What is his policy? I honestly don't understand how it would solve the issue (not combat it, but solve it) based off of what I've read from his website]
[I don't know about that stat on cops killing. It's maybe what at the most 2000 people a year? ISIS has killed hundreds at a time. Mass graves, entire villages of men women and children massacred.]
[Like, even starting in 2000 and thus counting 9/11, terrorist attacks of any kind have killed fewer Americans than BEES over the same amount of time. It's simply not a serious threat here.]
["Be afraid, only I can make you safe." This is straight out of the How to Make a Fascist handbook.]
[Great Reddit thread explaining how we are at more risk from right wing terrorism https://www.reddit.com/r/EnoughTrumpSpam/comments/4u4ld6/debunking_myths_about_islam/?st=IUDFVLP9&sh=bf3d954e]
[The interesting part is that the police mostly support Trump because he supports cops who commit murder.]
[It is stupid. Obviously, after Mugabe takes over the USA, he'll be able to fend off ISIS.]
[It's incredible how people are whining about how 'safe spaces are destroying this country', about the 'sheltered liberals' who 'can't deal with reality', yet these fuckers are terrified of "da ISIS" somehow just...taking over and start raping all 'our' women. Bonus pts for any paranoid survivalist talk about 'going off the grid'. The mental gymnastics involved are just mindboggling. I don't understand how these people don't 'catch themselves' holding these stupid contradictory views.]
[> But, unsurprising since he knows his crowd. They're terrified of things like ISIS when the police are guilty of killing more Americans any other force in the world, year in and year out. Uh, what? Other American civilians kill far more people. Cops kill about a thousand people per year, almost all of them criminals. Criminals murder over 12,000, and reckless drivers kill about as many. Hell, the #1 killer of Americans which another person is directly responsible for is probably medical errors. Cops aren't a major danger unless you're a criminal.]
[It's hard to call the American public a "force", since that implies some level of organizational structure.]
["Police" aren't really a force, they're thousands of individual departments. The only national policing agencies are the FBI, ATF, and ICE, unless I'm forgetting something. I'm not sure how many if any people they've shot this year.]
[He said more than any other force, ie: any other police force. Don't know if that's true but there you go.]
[Seriously, what make Trump any different than Islamist extremist leaders brainwashing their followers with lies?]
[You want the truth? Religious extremist leaders fire their followers up with righteous fury. They invoke God and point out how everyone is failing God by not standing up for Him and working His will upon the world. They then follow this up with a promise of a glorious reward in the after-life if they die in the service of God. Trump is firing people up with anger and fear. That's it. He's not even peddling hope of getting into Heaven. He's just peddling fear and an opportunity to get revenge on intellectuals and 'different people', be they gay or minorities or women who've rejected them.]
[You want the Truth? Hillary Clinton is Anti-Semantic, that's the truth. Hillary Clinton is just peddling fear and an opportunity to get revenge on intellectuals and 'different people', be they gay or minorities or women who've accused Bill Clinton of RAPE.]
[>But, unsurprising since he knows his crowd. They're terrified of things like ISIS The funny thing is so much of his base are in rural red states in the middle of the country where ISIS has better things to do than attack. I feel like after 9/11 the people in these states got more riled up about terrorism than people who actually live in NYC or other high-density areas where the threat of terrorism actually exists.]
[It's because so many of them live in a place where there are no dissenting opinions. Kind of like the Soviet Union used to be, except these people were tricked into it, rather than forced.]
[*Toddlers* kill more Americans than ISIS does.]
[And pussies?.... Well, pussies are for grabbin'...]
[Pussies don't like dicks, because dicks fuck pussies.]
[But dicks ALSO fuck assholes]
[And if you don't let us fuck this asshole right now......]
[If he doesn't stop it'll mean Civil War of some kind. Supporters have already been calling for armed rebellion and quote "lots of bloodshed" to set the country right if Hillary wins. I know these are the few extremists, but our country is a tinderbox right now.]
[PRISM will help the govt. squash that before it begins. Perhaps some lone wolf assassination attempts, but an organized group going to town? No way. We are a nation of armed people. We don't really have life bad at all compared to some 3rd world places I have been.]
[Lol, don't worry too much about that man. I know people like to talk big, but most people are content with their lives. They got jobs, families, and homes. I don't think there is enough people passionate enough to fight a civil war except maybe in the south, but in that case they got nobody to fight.]
[Won't happen. The division isn't geographic. Maybe urban vs. rural, but that won't last.]
[>it'll mean Civil War of some kind. Many Reddit comments said violence/revolt would happen if Hillary beat Bernie in the primary... just saying. Every election in history has people saying silly stuff like this. We're no where close to civil war.]
[It might mean a few handfuls of people doing crazy stuff, whether it be like that Bundy rancher guy, or just more armed radical Christrian terrorist groups, but an actual civil war ain't happening.]
[I totally agree with that. I think there will be several small scale attemtpted rebellions. I think the rebels will think people will flood into the street in support now that their fear of reprisal is finally lifted. Then they'll go up to Washington and lynch all the Democrats, and appoint Trump Dictator for life. That's what they think. But if even a few hundred of his millions of supports do anything like this it'll cost an unimaginable number of innocent lives. The FBI can't stop every threat, we saw a glimpse into what could have become in Kansas.]
[according to the article, Trump is pointing to the Republicans in Congress as enemies just as clearly as Democrats. He is really hoping to stir the fire against everyone. but I doubt anything will come of it.]
[It's only a little worse than normal, keep in mind at this pace, something like 15million, HALF are pissed and talking revolution, while 88 never voting people don't give a flaming fuck. So arguably its maybe 8 Million ish people, hopefully more than half of them are 65+ and borderline useless in military action., So 3 million zealots, scattered of 3 million acres]
[They were saying the exact same thing with Obama. 2nd Amendment "solutions" signs while open carrying at rallies, etc. It all amounts to what happened at the Mallaheur National Refuge...whole lot of sound and fury, signifying nothing.]
[> Supporters have already been calling for armed rebellion and quote "lots of bloodshed" to set the country right if Hillary wins. Good, let it happen. And when it does, I hope the US doesn't puss out and limit Sherman and Grant. This time, I hope we wipe the entirety of the deplorable from our population.]
[Most of his core supporters have proven themselves to be unintelligent, easily manipulated pussies. They might rise up, but they'll end up running into the woods, wearing diapers and living in trees until we've hunted them all down. The also don't strike me as a group of folks would would be easy to organize, much less expect them to follow orders.]
[I thought those people only existed online, behind computer screens, or at Trump rallies. My brother-in-law berated me yesterday for not voting Trump and let me know he thinks armed uprising is in the cards for him if Clinton is elected; guess I was always wrong to think he was reasonable, if a tool.]
[I've lost a lot of respect for people I had once admired or otherwise highly respected. This election has divided our country even between family ties. How is this any different than the 1860s? Some of the core issues are even the same. I'm not trying to be alarmist, normally I'm someone that believes things are going to be ok. But I'm not so sure any more. The divide has reached the point where it teeters on the precipice of the point of no return. How long before the divide is unmendable? And now we have two incompatible ideologies trying to live in the same country. And one side has lots of guns and likes to wave them around like some giant oversized phallic extension. (Not jabbing at gun owners in general. Those nut cases "protesting" in Virginia while open carrying are who I'm talking about.)]
[I totally understand where you're coming from; my brother-in-law is the father of my three nephews and one niece and I respected him for, if nothing else, the fact that my sister told me he was the most intelligent man she'd ever met. If Trump wins the election, I'm not trying to overthrow the government, I wouldn't even consider that. I'd disagree with his opinions, but I'd hope for his success as President; my brother-in-law, on the other hand, tells me he feels it might be his *obligation* to uprise in armed rebellion if Clinton wins. I don't think it's alarmist to say those opinions radically differ and are incompatible: one fits with democracy, one does not. It'd be nice to think things are okay, but sometimes when things hit too close to home, it's hard to believe that. I've never thought the divide was unbridgeable before now, I thought even talk of armed rebellion was a joke by online trolls and keyboard warriors, and my friends agreed with me, but now it's a frightening possibility. I've seen the guns my sister and her husband keep on the closet's top-shelf.]
[No Bird Sanctuary will be safe.]
[As a birdwatcher myself, nothing made me happier than when a bunch of birders essentially said to those militia goons, ["You want to fuck with us? Bring it. You will lose."](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2016/01/05/1466254/-Warning-from-the-Birding-Community-to-the-Terrorists-in-Oregon-We-re-Watching-You)]
[The far right likes to talk big but few of them are gonna actually stand up to the federal government. Fighting an insurgency takes a lot of effort and public support. It's not something you do on a lark. You can have all the AR-15s and tactical pants you need but that won't do much against an even moderately equipped SWAT team.]
[>You can have all the AR-15s and tactical pants you need Lmao]
[Some loons will do some stupid shit and be arrested. There is no way this breaks out into a civil war. Most of Trump's supporters are [middle class](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-mythology-of-trumps-working-class-support/), and they have too much to lose.]
[This is pretty much what I think as well. These folks will talk a big game, but when the time comes they won't do much. Heck, I've been hearing them say for years, "I may not agree with you but I'll defend to my death your right to say it." And not a peep out of them when so many protests were put down with tear gas and clubs. A couple might do something but most won't get out of their recliners.]
[Eh. Something's going to happen, sure, but it's not going to get much worse than the Malheur standoff.]
[Yeah it's not like a group of people are going to plot to bomb muslims in America after election day *right??*]
[[Haha, of course not...](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/militia-members-arrested-mosque-attack-plot/) In all seriousness, part of my prediction is taking into account the effectiveness of law enforcement.]
[Well when it comes to the effectiveness of law enforcement it's just a matter of time and effort on behalf of terrorists. Domestic/white and foreign/Islamic terror plots are foiled more often than they are carried out. But as long as there is a push to attack, some will get through. These people didn't blink a month or so ago when Trump called Obama the founder of ISIS and doubled down on the literal interpretation of that statement. Trump now could not be more clear in saying that he thinks the election will be rigged, meaning straight up electoral fraud. Many many people will buy this lie when he loses, and he is going to stick around and encourage everyone to keep The election has been such a shitstorm that people are talking like after we finally get to November 8th this will at least all be settled and all this will basically go away. It's not going away. Trump and his supporters and the lie that Clinton will have committed electoral fraud will not go away.]
[If Trump doesn't lose gracefully, something to that effect will probably happen. It won't literally be a civil war, but the anti-democratic discourse is so severe that there will be widespread civil unrest in the redder areas. I can easily see a few armed protests or even full out battles (against the National Guard?) in the most pro-Trump areas of the country.]
[> civil unrest in the redder areas why riot in their own cities? they would probably move to blue states and do it.]
[I think you severely overestimate the intelligence and resolve of the shit-talkers and underestimate the National Guard / military's ability to put a swift smack down on violent groups.]
[Remember the idiotic Oregon rancher protest? That ended with the National Guard calling their bluff and they all ran away except that one idiot.]
[Good way to usher in stricter gun control.]
[I am pretty sure the days following Trump's loss will be met with a lot of "this shall not stand!" and a looooooot of doing absolutely nothing. There's not gonna be any *battles*, dude, geez.]
[Man, I don't know. There was just that terrorist militia in...Kansas, I think that was planning to kill a bunch of left-leaning people. There's shit like that all over the country. I live in a solidly red area of a red state and I wouldn't put armed insurrection past these people.]
[You can't plan or worry against every nutbar terrorist. The "militia" was 3 people. Dumbasses gonna dumb.]
[Well, that's kinda the point. You can't plan for all of them, so I can't discount it as a possibility.]
[But there's a difference between "this is gonna be civil war, the masses of trump supporters will take to the streets" and "one guy in Alabama is gonna do some meth and shoot into the air"]
[Were you not there for Jade Helm? /s]
[Eh maybe not, but I've spoken to some of the more die hard Trump people, and they're certainly not going to stand for a loss. Battle may have been a strong word as it implies organized armies, armed conflict maybe?]
[As with Brexit, I predict an increase in hate crimes. They're too sloppy for a real rebellion]
[And too fat]
[Just like all those people that moved to canada, that personally threw Obama out of the office, etc? >they're certainly not going to stand for a loss. Sure they are. People talk a big game but rarely follow through no matter what political party or ideology they support. How's that Occupy/tea party/Flint Water Crisis/secession thing going these days? >armed conflict Still doubt it. There's no accounting for everyone, but we're not having any sort of upheaval.]
[> Just like all those people that moved to canada, that personally threw Obama out of the office, etc? I mean the "battles" thing is silly. But Trump has hyped *the fuck* out of his true believers in a way that Romney or McCain did the exact opposite of (because they're, like, reasonable people- whatever their politics). There mightn't (ok. there *won't*) be any huge, National-Guard-level drama when Trump loses, but there will *definitely* be a buttload more drama, discontent, and general dipshittery than in '08 or '12. And I could see Trump's "rigged" bullshit feeding into lone-wolf domestic idiocy, and general anti-government/police/everything stupidity.]
[So a lot of "This will not stand!" and a lot of nothing else. People can't and shouldn't worry about what any random idiot will do. There's no controlling that. There might be individuals who take it upon themselves to be jerks, like the rest of human history, but I feel people are hyping up this civil war stuff and it's not gonna happen even a little. People need to stop being afraid of tiny nonsense. We can't tell each other that being afraid of a muslim terrorist killing them is laughable and then go "but watch out for all those *american* terrorists", because it's equally as laughable. It's being afraid of boogeymen and nothing at all.]
[Yeah, I'm not trying to be over-dramatic. But a major party presidential candidate revving people up for a "rigged" (all but inevitable) loss, *is* kinda unprecedented, afaik. I don't think it's crazy (or creating "boogeymen") to point out that is pretty likely to have some fucked-up implications, in one form or another. which is why it's pretty much universally viewed as unacceptable, irresponsible, and kinda batshit crazy.]
[Yeah, you are probably right that there are no organized attacks, but get ready for riots at least. Good news is they've telegraphed their response weeks in advance, so it should be met swiftly.]
[Still don't buy it. I can't sit here and say "Nobody is gonna do anything" because there's millions of people. Shrug. They might. And we have riots for literally no reason. People love to riot. People riot when their sports teams WIN. But I don't think there's gonna be anything out of the ordinary.]
[Well, I wouldn't say rioting is normal for elections, but I see your point. I'm worried about things like milwaukee sherif saying the election is rigged though.]
[Didn't Ted Nugent vow to be dead or in jail in 6 months if Obama was re-elected? Lol Ted.]
[Ted Nugent has quite the history of saying one thing and doing another. The guy loves to remind people he's alive.]
[Yeah, but Stranglehold *is* kinda awesome. Let's not kid ourselves.]
[Trump's statement is so utterly insane that he should be laughed off the stage for even suggesting it.]
[ISIS couldn't even take over Iraq. Bears have a better chance of conquering the USA than ISIS does at this point. What a joke of a politician, how anyone can vote for him escapes me.]
[I for one welcome our new ursa overlords.]
[France has a better chance of conquering us than ISIS.]
[Or French bears (shudders)]
[What's ironic about this statement is that there have been multiple bear sightings in people's backyards where I live. Middle of a city and residential neighborhood...and bam! there's a bear. Bears are indeed doing more to take over here than ISIS. We need to build a wall and make the bears pay for it!]
[savagebart pays the savagebart tax, let the bears pay the bear tax!]
[Get this comment to the top!!!]
[Bears were here first. We're infringing on their right to bear bears. Deport all humans.]
[Yep and they aren't sending their good bears like Yogi and the Bad News Bears. They are sending bears with problems, and they are bringing those bear problems to us. They're bringing bear drugs. They're bringing bear crime. Their bear rapists. And some, I assume, are good bears.]
[Don't forget poo bear! Who is born here to immigrant bears.]
[Ah yes, anchor bears. They all have to go. They have to go until we can figure which bears can come here legally. We need extreme bear vetting.]
[But some are Drop Bears.]
[They're sending us bears whose calves are the size of cantaloupes from carrying 75 pounds of pot across the border!]
[I'll take "Grasping at Straws" for $1000 Alex.]
[Wow, so in the period of 4 years Isis is going to - Regain all the territory they've lost - Actually invade new land and seize control of a port - Recruit enough people to be able to stage an effective landing - Somehow gather enough boats and equipment to stage said landing - Sail across the Atlantic Ocean - invade and occupy a nation of 300+ million people. And all of this without the USA intervening. This man is living in a fantasy land]
[You, I, and his supporters know this is not what he means. He means Clinton would conspire with ISIS, that our government is literally moving to implement radical Islamic values into our society. Absolutely no one believes ISIS could take over the USA by force.]
[Oh, so instead of something crazy and stupid what he really said was stupid and crazy.]
[And that's even MORE unlikely and batshit crazy than the idea that Isis will actually invade.]
[Let me know where they are 1000 miles off the coast. I'll start packing and drive to Orlando. Probably check out Universal Studio.. haven't been. Hopefully they Have a promotion going on.]
[Sleeper cells dude. They're on the twitter]
[> invade and occupy a nation of 300+ million people. Who are heavily armed!]
[> invade and occupy a nation of 300+ million people. And a yearly military expenditure that is more than double the GDP of Iraq and Syria combined.]
[Seems totally legit.]
[Loser Donald has become unhinged.]
[He has no faith in this country does he?]
[>How stupid is our country? -the Republican nominee for its presidency]
[No but he has TREMENDOUS faith in ISIS let me just tell you, believe me, so much faith it'll make your head spin!]
[Sharia law is actually decent of capping interst rates (usury) Pork however will be taken from my cold fat hands]
[Fuck pork I'm fighting for the booze.]
[> Fuck pork They've got their hooks into David Cameron now?]
[Seriously, Donald? A rag tag band of few thousand, irrregular fighters is going to invade the US using, what?, the ISIS Navy or Air Force, armed with AK-47s, a few RPGs, and some IEDs and control 300 million people, many of whom are armed, and all of whom are protected by the most powerful military in history? Donald, you've gone full looney, but no doubt the brainless who worship at your feet will believe you.]
[Didn't they say this about Obama in 2008, and again in 2012? Ah, the adorable deplorables.]
[> Ah, the adorable deplorables. I think a lot of them are just misled.]
[Pretty sure ISIS wasn't a thing in 2008.]
[[Founded in 2003.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant)]
[Isis existed back then, but it was under the umbrella of Al Qaeda]
[By Obama?]
[Before 18 year old Barack Obama's mother flew black from Kenya , after secretly taking the 2 week trip by propeller plane to get there while 9 months pregnant, they stopped in Iraq to form ISIS.]
[I picture it as a Lion King-esque sort of scene.]
[According to Trump.... Yes.]
[Everyone knows that the real seat of power in this country is the Illinois state senate.]
[Bill Clinton raped ISIS into existence.]
[The Republicans were calling him soft on terror while the boys were out shooting Bin Laden in the face. Cowards.]
[>Without the media and without the press," Trump said, "Hillary Clinton would be nothing. What an arrogant little twerp. What would you be without your daddy, other than a puff of hot air?]
[What's even funnier about that is without his reality show he's just be this weird looking dude from the 80's who was rich and then lost all of his money.]
[I wish someone would create a website called "Trump predictions" to keep track of all this stuff over the next 4-8 years.]
[I get the feeling that in Trump supporters brains ISIS = all brown people]
[What a sad narcissistic man. He's just trying to stay in the news at this point]
[Oh shut the hell UP! NO one buys this nonsense. It's insulting to think people actually eat this right up and panic.]
[Sorry to inform you, but 30 to 40 percent believe this bullshit.]
[I think (hope, really) that a smaller portion believes him than is voting for him. At least about this. Many likely will vote for whoever has the R next to his or her name. The social conservatives know the Courts are in the balance now, so many are likely going to swallow their disgust and pull the lever for the guy they hope Pence will control. I mean, that's not a great way to be, but it's better than being an idiot who actually thinks Trump is right.]
[Blatant fear mongering]
[My god who believes this shit? Shut the fuck up already.]
[Ring wing lunatics believe this shit and... - Chem trails and vaxxing nonense and Obama being a muslim born in Kenya and God knows how many other insane things.]
[Anti vaxxers are mostly liberals.]
[No: http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/numbers-republicans-democrats-vaccination-debate-n298606]
[60% of anti vaxxers describe themselves as liberal. http://qz.com/355398/the-average-anti-vaxxer-is-probably-not-who-you-think-she-is/]
[I think anti-vax is one of the horseshoe theory aspects showing itself. The idea being that the extremes right and left end up having a lot in common. So you get the government-suspicious people of the far right, and the nature is best eco-craze from the far left.]
[and they wonder why we call them stupid.]
[What a crock of shit.]
[.....how?......seriously?......HOW?]
[It's getting to the point where even thinking about voting for this fucking guy should be disqualifying you from voting.]
[Trumpies are dumb enough to actually believe this hyperbole]
[I'm sure as early as tomorrow i'll see more posts about it on FB. Everyone that i've seen posting about why they are continuing to vote for him or why people in the last couple weeks have moved from Clinton to Trump use "Russia will attack us if Clinton wins! We can't let her start a war!" Let's just add this to that list now. ugh. If there was a way to facepalm harder than i already do.. i would do it. No amount of facts seem to help dispel any of this. I can only hope for the election to happen soon. But i'm sure, if Clinton wins, i'm going to see the same people bitching and moaning like they did (maybe not as bad) with Obama his entire time as President. Hell, i actually saw someone share a video that "proves" he wasn't born where his birth certificate stated.. "Michelle accidentally proves blah blah blah blah " "AND HE HATES IT!"]
[> If there was a way to facepalm harder than i already do. Maybe, like, a really long run-up?]
[> I'm sure as early as tomorrow You won't have to wait that long]
[i don't doubt that. I was hoping to have some reprieve, albeit short, from the stupidity.]
[I am seriously afraid for Clinton right now. But I know 100% that Tim Kaine would crush it in this election if she is killed.]
[Literally anyone but her would crush this election. Same goes for the Republican side instead of Trump.]
[I doubt that. Hillary would take out the entire GOP lineup, except Rubio, without trouble. And frankly we don't have a big dem bench of people willing to be made public enemy #1 by the GOP. Kaine is one of the few that could do it. Biden could have if his son did not die. Murray and Tester I think are the other two out of the experienced Dems that could do it. The rest would either be to liberal, to Jewish, or not experienced enough to handle it.]
[Meanwhile in reality, the assualt on their last major Iraqi city will likely begin this week. Edit: Or you know, right now. Good luck ya janud!]
[dang dude talk about imploding.]
["Also, they'll stop making coke and pepsi drinking will be mandatory."]
[At what point do lies stop being politics and start being treason? Trump isn't just attacking Clinton anymore. He's attacking our entire democracy.]
[> Trump isn't just attacking Clinton anymore. He's attacking our entire democracy. Dude, Trump is attacking the middle distance. He's attacking the very fabric of reality. Just leave him to it; he'll get distracted by something shiny soon then he'll forget all about it...]
[Wow, Donald, the level of idiocy and ignorance there is ridiculous. How can somebody this dumb have won his party's nomination for President? Seriously, any Trump supporters, please try to defend this statement. Entertain me.]
[unlikely]
[What an absolute cock-womble]
[Can you at least *try* to take this seriously!?! .^(he kinda is, though...)]
[This is the sort of derision that leads to violence.]
[Where does it end with this guy? Oh wait, it doesn't. Fuck]
[Oh, for fuck's sake. This is like saying *Fant4stic* is a lock to sweep the Oscars; there are people who might want to believe it, but its chances are less than zero. Any random biker gang has a higher probability of "taking over the US" than ISIS.]
[All joking and memeing aside, this is incredibly irresponsible talk. He's already making assertions that the election may be rigged. He is right on the cusp of outright inciting his supporters to violence.]
[Should have gone with "Purple Monkey Dishwasher", Donald. Would have made more sense.]
[I think "Purple Monkey Dishwasher" is his economic policy...]
[Given Trump lives in Bizarro world, you just need to reverse the meaning of his statements, they then make more sense.]
[After some of trumps casino slot machines were shut down due to failures, he claimed they were shut down because they were being used too much..."too hot". He literally says anything to make himself look better.]
[He's looking pretty puffy. Hung over? Anyways, this is what it looks like when AM talk radio finally get their presidential candidate.]
[Hmm, might be over estimating the military capabilities of ISIS a tad.]
[This man needs to be drug tested.]
[What he needs is a psychological exam]
[Can you imagine if he gets his wish of having them both go do drug tests? He'll have to lay of the Cocaine for a while.]
[Makes perfect sense to his supporters given that 1/3 of them also want an [Atlantic Ocean wall]( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-immigration-atlantic-ocean-wall-migrants-us-election-2016-a7216966.html) to keep away surfboarding immigrants from the Middle East.]
[Every four years it's the same thing from the GOP-wait wut]
[Reminds me of the red scare bs I read about as a kid.]
[An ape throwing poop hoping something sticks.]
[Tomorrow's headline: "Trump: If Clinton wins all your kids are going to turn gay"]
[Tuesday: Trump "Crooked Hillary will force your now gay kids to be Fine Arts majors!"]
[Trump is afraid of his own shadow]
[Whenever I'm stressed after work .. I watch this clown's campaign videos... It's such a good relief.. I love comedy..]
[That's going to be hard with no army, navy, or air force...]
[Grasping at anything. His desperation is pathetic.]
[That would be preferable to a trump presidency.]
[Well he is certainly setting up the serious possibility of blood being shed when Clinton wins. I wish he could be held responsible for his actions.]
[He's completely desperate now. He's like an injured animal who's back into a corner, but like any hunter would say this is when they are the most dangerous. No telling what they will do.]
[No they won't.]
[Wait what, how does that even make sense]
[Really cuz they are losing their capital in Iraq as we speak.]
[I'm at a loss for words.]
[ISIS is pathetically small and our military could use them to wide their ass with in hours. Trump is moronic, as usual.]
[He is a complete moron but the last few wars have shown size of force has little impact except on tax payers. He who rules the air rules the air]
[I don't think that ISIS could take Iceland, let alone the United States!]
[This guy is crazy.]
[I totally see this happen, unless of course the lizardmen strike first, in which case...ok, I'll see myself out.]
[Typical political scaremongering... he knows his campaign is Frakked to high heaven... so he's trying to scare people into not voting for Hillary.]
[Wait, I thought they already had because Obama's a Kenyan Muslim. And I also thought Trump appreciated Sharia divorce customs. I'm so confused.]
["Fear and Hate" "Fear and Hate" "Fear and Hate" "Fear and Hate" "Fear and Hate" - Trump]
[With that mighty ISIS navy and air force, no doubt. Trump is clearly a guy who understands the military and geopolitics bigly.]
[He is not unproud of his military mind, but the army cyber might need some rejiggering...]
[Desperate but it might work Republicans and altright idiots are scared of everything]
[No one can defend this. It's absurd. Tomorrow the campaign will call it sarcasm or hyperbole.]
[locker room talk Nup!!! Locker. Room. Talk...]
[oh , but they will ALL defend it ... there is no getting through to his supporters because they have always been a bunch of racist bigots and now they have someone who shares their views . Now they feel empowered .... hence the 3 white terrorists (also trump supporters) who were planning on killing muslims the day after the election , including the babies.]
[Now he's calling our country unattractive as a whole. He may be the most vain, materialistic person ever. His brain is broken and he is totally demented.]
[Meanwhile, in the real world: [ISIS in the crosshairs: Battle for Mosul begins](http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/16/middleeast/mosul-isis-operation-begins-iraq/index.html)]

[Stahp it! This guy needs a bop on the nose.]
[I think this is what Trump meant when he said the shackles have been removed. He can race to the bottom much faster now!]
[Does anyone believe him when he says this shit?]
[The Trumpets eat it up like Thanksgiving dinner.]
[And Iraq just launched their attack on Mosul... seriously, this trump guy is pathetic.]
[just bs propaganda.....Obamas a Muslim and the antichrist and Clinton is the devil........."rolls eyes".]
[It's funny that he thumps his chest and touts ISIS as a threat, meanwhile back in good old reality ISIS is on the ropes surrounded by enemies and we haven't even done more than provide air support, training, resources, and special ops, I think this proxy war in Syria against Assad and Russia is going really well for those only focused on ISIS. If only Donny and the idiot yes men he surrounds himself with had a clue.]
[I've met people who actually believe this too]
[It works for him because the people voting for him believe this stuff.]
[Well this type of talk certainly won't cause trump loonies to plan terrorist attacks against mulims mosques or firebomb "the bad ones" in the GOP.]
[Oh for fucks sake shut this idiot up already.]
[We could *literally* elect a member of ISIS to the presidency and they wouldn't be able to gain control of this country.]
[Yeah, we tried that. He fixed the economy, killed Bin Laden and everyone loves him...]
[And next thing you know, the Martians are invading.]
[Trump is bringing out any lie he can think of. But the problem is he is trying to win over the independents who unlike his supporters are not missing a brain.]
[>"Without the media and without the press," Trump said, "Hillary Clinton would be nothing." Self awareness is not one of his stronger qualities.]
[What nonsense. As in, it literally is without sense. I don't understand it. This guy is something else.]
[So first she's the crazy Pro-War lady but now she'll be too soft on ISIS? Which is it Trump?]
[Or they may not. However, I like my chances with Clinton.]
[You know that comic spoof of Calvin and Hobbes where Hobbes is trying to get Calvin to play and he's like "yeah, just lemme finish my homework," and the last frame is Hobbes as a stuffed animal and Calvin tooling away on his homework?

[Ha! What an empty, impossible threat. ISIS isn't even trying to do that. This isn't Red Dawn. They're terrorists, not an occupying force.]
[I thought Obama's the secret Muslim?]
[just like it did when hussein obama took over?]
[Isis just lost Dabiq. They're not taking over southern California. Not with this traffic!! Heyo!!]
[Trump must not be paying attention to how nearly dead the Islamic State is currently. They're being crushed nearly systematically at this point.]
[Trump said at one point that "our country has never been so low" and "I'm ashamed with what's happened to our country, and so are you." No shit, Donald.]
[Thanks Trump!]
[Trump also said he will unleash the aliens held at area 51 to attack ISIS. They're the best aliens you know.]
[If the US didn't care about civilian casualties at all ISIS would be destroyed in a matter of days. They pose no real threat to the US as a nation, just to small numbers of its civilians.]

[Oh! Maybe he'll be charged with sedition sometime in November! Early xmas present! _swoon_]
[Isn't ISIS close to being done though]

[i actually think he's just trying to promote himself and secure his supporter base at this point instead of trying to win. Imagine how many of those Trump supporters will buy his shit in the future... or Trump Tv.... Think of him as Peter Popoff]
[Trump TV, if it happens, will be like Trump Mortgage. Poorly timed and doomed to fail. The instant, and I mean the instant, he loses, Alex Jones is going to turn on him. He'll be Hillary Clinton's new buttplug. The tape of him talking about how much he likes the Clintons, being a Democrat for so long, being from New York, all that will be used to push a victimization narrative where the evil Democrats suckered Republicans into getting behind the one guy Hillary could beat. If only we weren't such simple, salt of the earth people, we wouldn't have fallen for the ruse. But in our innocent virtue we fell for a fast talker who pretended to be against the Establishment. The election was rigged; it was rigged by Trump. He was an agent provocateur. Hannity will turn on him; his bosses at Fox won't appreciate the competition. Shit, Trump probably won't be able to resist saying as much himself to save face. Between the conservatives furious at him for costing them so much, the ones who will choose to feel like victims instead of asking themselves hard questions, and the ones so malleable they'll believe anything they hear from Fox, he'll be dead to them.]
[It's ironic because ISIS wants Donald to win. He would help create the holy war they're hoping for. They already use him as propaganda to recruit people.]
[What a fucking fear mongerer]

[You mean his gastroenterologist, since he's also apparently responsible for Trump's mental health.]
[This guy uses the best words. He never lies, believe me. He tells so much not lies it will make your head spin.]
[While the sane and informed are cautiously optimistic as they observe the beginning of the liberation of Mosul from ISIS, Donald Trump is claiming that ISIS is one US election away from mounting a transcontinental invasion of the likes no one has witnessed before. He is fear mongering in the most despicable manner possible - he is making ISIS out to be far more than it is, and he is speaking such that he assumes (correctly) that his supporters haven't a shred of knowledge of what is going on in the world. It is a political tactic employed by heinous autocrats who depend on a scared and ill-informed population - he preys on the fears of the ignorant and the misguided. What a vile politician he is turning out to be.]
[Desperate and Deplorable: The Donald Trump Story.]
[Seems legit.]

[Inb4 "Hillary is the reincarnation of Adolf Hitler". I mean, the guy is throwing random things at this point, so according to Godwin's law...]
[Have we had a Hitler comparison from Trump yet? Coz if we haven't, we should start a betting pool...]

[I'll grant you the war of 1812, what is the second?]
[Mexican-American war?]
[Yea, Texas was annexed which started the war and Mexico did invade Texas so that works as the second one. Not very familiar with that war.]

[Ring-wing terrorist militias will take over the US if Trump wins. How about that for a discussion?]

[[Shut. The Fuck. Up.](http://i.imgur.com/n6IEN5H.gif) I can't wait for this clown to get destroyed in a record-setting landslide of an election so I can stop hearing him spew his toxic bullshit.]
[You really think losing will shut him up? He's just going to get louder I expect.]
[America has way more armed, drugged out hill folks riding in pickup trucks than ISIS, so probably not.]
[Is this ISIS takeover ocurring before or after the Russians nuke the US?]
[Do you think he has moments of clarity when he's lying in bed wondering what the fuck is wrong with him.]
[We all laugh but these people really believe this stuff. My mom thinks Sharia law is coming to the US soon.]
[Do people really believe this shit? There would much sooner be an ethnic cleansing of Muslims in the US before an Islamic State take over.]
[OK, seriously? I'm out. I refuse to believe he's even trying anymore. He doesn't want to win and he's trying as hard as he can to give it to Hillary and he keeps getting 40% of the vote and even he can't figure it out. There's literally no other reason he should be saying this.]
[It's like he says what we think he'd say]
[Is it considered hate speech to say how unsettling trumps turkey neck is in that thumbnail?]
[We'll let it pass just this once sincerely SJWs]
[I hear a lot of really dumb people are saying this. Tremendously dumb and paranoid.]
[Russia takes over if you win Trump With ISIS, I don't know man... Clinton has a clear record of killing Osama bin Laden, killing other top Al Queda leaders and literally finishing them off. They're like octopus though with more heads springing up like ISIS. But with Clinton, I'm sure she will chop off these heads. With you and Russia man, I don't know.]
[The comment section on the USA Today article is an absolute goldmine of knowledge and civil discourse . /s]
[It's just like when the US lost the war in Vietnam and was occupied by the North Vietnamese communists.]
[Well Trump, considering ISIS endorses you, I'm inclined to believe that it would happen under you, not Clinton.]
[That couldn't possibly be because they want to damage Trump's image so Hillary has a better chance of winning, nope!]
[To be entirely fair, I don't think he means that ISIS will arrive on the shores of the US and fight their way inland one split-level suburban home at a time. Rather, all of the Muslamoid Arabiacs that are already there will be activated like the clone army in *Revenge of the Sith* (General Order 69, probably -- nudge nudge!) and they will all whip out scimitars and start chopping up kindergartners. I think this is a *much* more realistic scenario.]
[Embarassing that the the Republican Party is now getting it's talking points from silly Alex Jones.]
[hahahahahhahahahaha, oh my god he's delusional.]

[Trump, the dufus.]
[How did we get to the point where someone running for president. Can just say all kinds of baseless claims, bald faced lies,and just absurd personal attacks?]
[Man, he's not even trying now. This is like level 1 trolling that indicates he is out of ideas.....]
[Who's this trump guy?]
[It wouldnt the first time someone took land from the Americans]
[I...what?]
[> "They are hoping and praying that Hillary Clinton becomes president of the United States, because they’ll take over not only that part of the world, they’ll take over this country," Trump told backers in Ocala, Fla. ISIS, little better than a gorilla force, who took advantage of regional chaos and power vacuums to seize territory, who are having their shit pushed in and have lost much of it again, are somehow going to take over the US? Riiiiiight. As fear mongering rhetoric goes, that bit makes Trump look especially ignorant/stupid. Plus: Clinton is the biggest warhawk ever vs Clinton is going to just roll over and let ISIS conquer the US! Which is it? Because you really can't have it both ways.]
[Sure they will, as soon as they can find a boat to get here.]
[Funny (?) thing is, some people will actually believe this and vote for Trump]
[Not only would ISIS take over, but we would be seeing taco trucks on every corner as well.]
[heres your Taco and your Quran! Praise be to Allah]
[Suppose the Battle of Mosul goes well, ISIS loses their last stronghold in Iraq, and the next few weeks we hear stories of the coalition pushing ISIS back to Al-Raqqa... what does that do to Donald Trump's campaign? His whole foreign policy appeal wrests on the US policy in the middle east being perceived as a failure and no one paying attention to Russia. How does he respond if by say, the third debate, the coalition has taken most of the city and ISIS is unable to reinforce their forces thanks to US and Turkish airstrikes?]
[It does absolutely nothing. Clearly everyone still voting for him cannot be turned away for literally any reason. Fortunately that shouldn't be enough people to win him the election.]
[I think trump hopes the country fails after he loses.]
[The idiots who believe that also tend to be obese, smoke, drink heavily, never exercise, and engage in all sorts of unhealthy behavior that is exponentially more likely to kill them than a Muslim (refugee or not) is.]
[This guy is so dramatic]
[Did anybody else watch the video and imagine Christopher Walken playing Trump in a mini series or short film?]
[The USA loves gun protection. The USA have the best military in the world and many of the US citizens are packing a gun(s). A few thousand (and decreasing) overseas extreme Islam terrorist are not threatening. What's more threatening is a psycho, delusional, corrupt, overseas labor businessman who could be our next president. I'm soooooooooooooooooooo sick of Trump and his supporters bull shit. I hate Hillary too, but I will never vote for crazy.]
[Trump thinks Islamic state is one of the United States]
[Fear mongering is so easy.]
[I actually laughed aloud at this.]
[Yes, they're just standing around at the borders, holding their AK-47s and checking their watches, waiting for the moment when Hillary wins the election. *"Is it time yet, Wasim? No, Abdullah, not yet. Once she wins, we'll go in. Just remember what we practiced. Run as fast as you can, shoot your gun in the air and yell Allahu Akhbar!"*]
[Trump is beyond desperate. Better watch out he's so desperate he might try to grab America by the pussy.]
[The fearmongering from his campaign is just incredible]

[ISIS behind every Taco truck on every corner.]
[Does this mean that the taco trucks will *also* sell falafels?  ]
[The Islamic state may take over if Trump wins. Teddy Roosevelt may rise from the grave and lead the islamic state to take over the US if Trump wins. We may all die of a mysterious plague allowing the islamic state to take over if Trump wins.]
[There is literally ZERO chance of this happening regardless of who the president is. ISIS is an insurgent guerrilla force that barely controls the territories they claim. Trump is so blatantly ignorant, if the 100 things before didn't disqualify him, this comment certainly does.]
[I'll just leave this here: http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/16/middleeast/mosul-isis-operation-begins-iraq/index.html?sr=fbCNN101616mosul-isis-operation-begins-iraq0648PMVODtop]
[The big operation to retake Mosul is starting now. There is a pretty strong chance that before election day that ISIS is going to suffer a pretty big loss.]
[What]
[Isis hasn't taken over a 1st or even 2nd world country yet, but it's going to take over the only super power?]
[>Trump said at one point that "our country has never been so low" and "I'm ashamed with what's happened to our country, and so are you." Just to restate it, sure, those record high economic growth in recent years, record low unemployment, and low crime rates are just points of shame for the good old US of A]
[Counterpoint: Trump may take over the country if she doesn't.]
[He's really shoring up his base, isn't he.]
[Facepalm..........................................]
[You clearly don't understand quantum politics.]
[Would probably be preferable to trump taking over u.s.]
[So he wants to spread fear just like terrorists]
[The man that 40%+ of the US electorate will choose to be our next president, ladies and gentleman.]
[Good grief, what does it take for a candidate to be kicked out of the running? At this rate he could say that the Clinton Foundation is smuggling the Zika virus into the US and no-one would bat an eyelid.]
[I agree, the us nuclear arsenal has no chance against rockets and rifles.]
[Of course they "may" take over if she wins, but it's guaranteed if Trump wins.]
[Am I the only one that noticed a few too many blondes in the audience?]
[I thought Trump was a big second amendment guy. > "A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed." The Founding Fathers did not want us to have guns for the hell of it. Gun ownership was included because it was perceived to be an additional safeguard on our democracy. While I may personally believe that the current interpretation of the amendment exceeds what the Founding Fathers could have possibly intended, it means that there are a lot of fucking guns for *exactly* the purpose of opposing a foreign invasion. There is no possibility that a modern military could be disarmed, confused, or dispersed like a standing army could have been in the 1700s. However, even if we magically grant that it were, there is no such thing as a successful ground invasion on US soil. It is too damn big and there are enough weapons to arm every man, woman, and child. You would need a modern military, and ISIL does not have a modern military.]
[Counterpoint - if Trump wins, the U.S. may be taken over by westboro Baptist Church.]
[This is Roger Ailes doing. 100%]
[Flash backs to the last season of house of cards]
[This is so silly. The US is not all so important that the world would be helpless to ISIS if we elected the wrong president.]
[Isis couldn't even take over Montenegro as it is right now. They are only a threat to the poor people in the places they occupy.]
[The shark has been officially jumped.]
[I'm more concerned about this line: "This is the last time you'lll ever have a chance to save our country. They're....it's not gonna happen anymore. You won't be able to....the numbers will be too great. Already the Republican nominee has a massive, a massive disadvantage." Pray tell, Trump, what numbers are you referring to? What will change between now and 2020 that will make a Republican president even more unnattainable?]
[No shit, man. Jon Ronson literally wrote the book on it. It's 2$ on Amazon, or free with a Prime membership. (Post not sponsored by Jon Ronson. I just have a raging girl boner for his nebbish, neurotic British intellectual schtick and it's only like twenty pages long.)]
[We have far too many people with guns willing to use them on invaders for us to be conquered by any modern nation.]
[I don't think he means they would conquer us.]
[The people with guns make a minor difference (although they would like to think otherwise). The worlds most powerful military force by far is what counts.]
[That's true but don't underestimate an armed civilian population backed in to a corner.]
[The woman who is more hawkish and, according to him, more likely to take us into war over just about anything is going to let this happen?]
[Well, considering Hillary has earned a reputation of being something of a warhawk, I don't see how it's a feasible position to say that ISIS will take over during her term.]
[Wasnt there some guy running for President that wanted to start a war over rude gestures? [What was his name again?](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/09/trump-says-hell-attack-iran-over-rude-gestures.html) Ronald Dumpf, no thats not it, Tonald Drump. Oh wait I know Donald Trump, thats it.]
[You won't find a president or SoS that were not involved in armed conflicts in past I say 60 years?]
[Well, my comment is not in regards to other presidents or SoS', nor is that relevant to what I said. In regards to Hillary's foreign policy, she has repeatedly shown an eagerness to engage in bellicose behaviors.]
[Yea I was just trying to understand compared to who? Compared to other Secretaries of State she is about on the same page.]
[That doesn't make it okay.]
[You people are so fucking hypocritical. Y'all were voting for Bush when he was launching wars left and right but now it's somehow convenient for you guys to act like military intervention is a bad thing.]
[If everyone is a warhawk, no one is a warhawk.]
[Jimmy Carter, I think, is the only one in our nation's history.]
[He sent the military to rescue the hostages in Iran. The mission failed, but it was still a very small invasion in a technical sense.]
[Yes, a group of under 100,000 people could conceivably conquer the 3rd most populous country on earth. You're setting a new bar for stupidity.]
[Actually, if you were to look at a graph of fertility among ethnic lines in Britain over time, there would be a case to be made. But that is a total strawman and not what I'm saying. I'm simply saying that in Islam, establishing cultural and demographic hegemony is a stated goal, and there is reason to worry that a large percentage of these demographics are radicalized to an extent that others are not. This should be EXTREMELY worrying. These demographics use welfare far more. They influence the culture in very negative ways. They commit crimes at far higher rates than the native population. Yes, I fear this happening in any given city in America.]
[Lol]
[It must be hard to be scared all the time. I'm sorry about that. Kinda strange though, since we are literally living in the safest time ever in history. It's almost like you're looking for something to be scared about]
[So now it's not isis, but conquest from all of Islam we have to fear? Why don't you go demonize religious minorities on one of the nazi boards?]
[Watched the video and read the article... Where did he say this? I somehow missed it in both?]
["They are hoping and praying that Hillary Clinton becomes president of the United States, because they’ll take over not only that part of the world, they’ll take over this country," Trump told backers in Ocala, Fla.]
[Protip: Trumptards like this guy can't read. Why else do you think they get all of their news from infowars podcasts and hour long youtube videos from MRA's and RedPillers.]
[Funny how this whole sub Reddit just circle jerks to Hillary Clinton.]
[More like disgusting]
[I think it's more about how awful trump is than how great she is. The US has never seen such a mess of a candidate before. Especially one that is tearing apart a huge party. This is history, sorry it hurts your butt.]
[We can't forget...Hillary *is* ISIS's MVP.]
[Maybe I should've included a /s...]
[lol. "/s" is for the weak. *COMMIT* motherfucker!]
[She is going to dramatically increase immigration if she wins. Some of those will be members of the Islamic State.]
[I don't think Customs is the biggest obstacle in the way of taking over this country. I think they have more to worry about from taking on the most powerful military the world has ever seen than whether or not their papers are in order.]
[What's your point?]
[That trumps claim is not without merit.]
[Ofcourse it has no merit. Do you seriously think that a couple of IS members will "take over US"??]
[Shit, if that's all it takes, I might take over the US before them. Get some mates together, catch a 20-hour flight and BAM! I rule the US of A. It's ok, I'll still be better than Trump.]
[When did he say that???]
[[Yeah ok](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/008/320/3563wq.jpg)]
[> Islamic State may take over U.S. if Clinton wins Because there are so many Muslim countries with women holding the most powerful office in the nation.]
[How? Also why they didn't play the video of him actually saying it?]
[Good thing I'm voting for Sanders.]
[What an idiot. Isis could never get a toehold in the US. If Hillary is elected they will do extremely well in Syria though. See Libya for example]
[They are not doing extremely well in Syria at the moment. Why would you think this situation would change if she was elected president? Please explain if you can.]
[He literally said nothing about the Islamic state that title is super wrong]
[tru.]
[Key word here is "may"]
[lol.]
[The Islamic state is already here.]
[And Hillary will increase migration by over 500%]
[Yes, its terrible. Even over here in the UK! I tried to walk to the shops to get some bacon for my sandwich but I was beheaded on the way by some ISIS thugs. Tsk.]
[As an atheist fuck Clinton's letting in so many muslim immigrants but also fuck Donald giving the Christians the right to discriminate.]
[As an atheist are you not discriminating against Muslims? We are letting in Syrians who are Muslims, not Muslims who happen to be Syrian. Getting involved in car accident is far greater versus being attacked by a Syrian refuge who also happens to belong to isis.]
[Im against taking refugees, we need to fix the problem over there not keep having to take in an infinite number if refugees.]
[And even less likely to be attacked by his home, than the refugee living in it.]
[Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free. We should probably chisel this slogan off the Statue of Liberty according to you.]
[Unless you're aboriginal someone in your ancestry was an immigrant and I bet they were religious. Say fuck you to them for me will ya? Since now we're stuck with you.]

[More likely it's an unhinged dem.]
[Or a Trump supporter]
[They *do* have a bit of a fixation with 'false flag' attacks...]
[Forget the Islamic state, Hillary will antagonize the Russians to actual war with her No-Fly Zone and overall bad judgement; there's honestly no sane reason to vote for Hillary Clinton. Trump on the other hand will share a few drinks with Putin and make deals that'll benefit both Russia and America equally. Just let Trump win and then vote him out in 4 years with Elizabeth Warren. It's a win-win for everybody except for the Establishment.]
[> It's a win-win for everybody except for the Establishment. And by "establishment" you mean... "everyone"?]
[Trump doesn't drink]
[Yeah, let's stick it to the establishment by electing yet-another old white rich guy to President! But this guy's got zero experience whatsoever, so it's totally different. Of course there's no sane reason to vote for the devoted and intelligent civil servant of over 40 years. Orange Mussolini with grabby hands and a VP who might even be a bigger bigot than him, that's whose got my vote. It's why all those reputable newspapers have endorsed him. >It's a win-win for everybody except for the Establishment. Unless you're Muslim. Or a woman. Or gay. Or poor. Or anyone with any semblance of empathy of towards those groups I just mentioned.]
[And then we'll vote out the old white rich guy in 2020 and replace him with a respectable female like Elizabeth Warren who isn't a witch like Hillary. And Muslim's, gays, the poor, and women will be just fine in those 4 years. All the people who spoke out against Trump on both sides of the Isle in the house and senate will keep Trump in check, along with the constitution. The MSM and Hollywood will also make sure Trump doesn't fuck over the country, along with all of you Hillary supporters. I'm confident you all will do a ***fantastic*** job of preventing Trump from fucking American up for 4 years before Elizabeth Warrens comes to replace him. You should have more faith in yourselves.]
[Russia put nukes 90 miles from the US coast....nothing happened. A no-fly zone will not start a war. It is in no ones interest.]
[Hillary is adamant that Assad lose power, but Putin has been crystal clear that Assad remain in power. Sanctions against Russia won't get them to change their tune, and a No-Fly Zone, which Hillary is for, would be meaningless unless US is ready to shoot Russian Jets down. If that happens then Putin will declare war on America, and that could escalate into a Nuclear War. I don't trust a war-hawk with Hillary's terrible record in war with diplomacy with the Russians. Trump however, who Putin wants in office, will share a few drinks (or some other kind of beverage, he doesn't drink apparently) and strike deals for the benefit of both America and Russia. Trump is by far the most sane choice for the POTUS.]
[You say it like you actually believe it]
[Hillary is not adamant that Assad is out. She would prefer he is gone. Sanctions against Russia may not change their tune but it would be very difficult for them to get into any kind of serious armed conflict. Any no-fly zone would have the cooperation of Europe. Putin would not declare war on America because it serves him ZERO purpose. People always act in their best interests. I don't trust Trump to assemble an IKEA dresser. The reason Putin wants Trump in office is because he knows he can manipulate him because he lacks discipline. Trump is not even the best choice to run his own company.]
[I know you truly think you're right. But please trust me, you're not. You're actually considering voting for someone who is an actual sociopath because you speculate Clinton will start a nuclear war. Just read Trump's statement about ISIS. How is that not a complete lie? A total fabrication to scare the uninformed into voting for him. How can you trust him if he is lying to you everyday? Just answer those questions. Answer them without resorting to telling us what you believe Clinton will do.]
[You're telling me to pay attention to Trump's words as a private citizen while completely ignoring Hillary's record of voting and stances as an elected official. Sorry, but I'm not turning a blind eye to her bad judgement. *She voted for the war in Iraq* *She was for every drone strike* *She was for the drone strike that led to Khadaffi's capture and death, throwing Lybia into chaos* *She's for a No-Fly zone that could lead to a war with Russia if enforced and a Russian Jet gets shot down* I have absolutely zero faith that she won't completely fuck up relations with Russia, resulting in all of our deaths to Nuclear fallout. The witch needs to lose this election for the sake of this country.]
[So...elect a fear mongering man with no political experience because that will keep us safer than the former Secretary of State. Have you thought this through?]

Like, is America about to get "taken over" by school shooters? Or white supremacists? Or domestic violence?]
[Have you forgotten about Cologne? More than 2,000 sexual assaults reported to be done by Muslim migrants on a single night. It's not just isolated incidents, it's a clear problem with the people as a whole.]

[France will become an Islamic state this century. This is what happens when cultural marxism meets Islam.]
[11 months on reddit -100 karma classic https://www.reddit.com/user/nomeeek]
[Uh huh.]
[Muhammad did have the plan of Islam taking over every culture and civilization and dominating the world - only then will peace be achieved, that's the plan. The kaffir must be subjugated, that's everyone not within Islam. The plan has been going on for 1400 years and so far has been quite successful and has overtaken country after country that never recovers their culture from it and never survives dhimmitude. If you study Muhammad (Islam says Muhammad is the perfect man, to be emulated), there is little mystery. Part of his plan, and part of his Islam, was to kill those who refuse to convert to "submission" and kill those who decide to leave. A quite effective setup if your plan is global domination, which his was. He was also highly successful as a conquering warlord. The Islamic calendar doesn't begin from when Muhammad had relatively peaceful religious teaching in Mecca, but from when he created his (violent) political teachings when he left for Medina. I doubt ISIS would take over the USA in 4 years under Hillary, we know Trump likes hyperbole, but the USA is a baby compared to Islam - they are working on entirely different timescales. A 2000 year plan for Islamic world conquest is not beyond belief for those who see the tactics and strategy, and some people (such as ISIS) see themselves in this historical timescale with a far greater sense of history than Americans who think their freedom will last forever.]

[> Can someone give me proof Clinton is not a war hawk? First of all, asking someone to prove a negative is sort of silly. That's doubly true when you don't offer any specific definition of what a warhawk is. Most people don't think there's anything intrinsically wrong with using American military power abroad in support of our various national interests.

[I think the keyword is may. Hillary would get the ball rolling for this to happen, yes. It wouldn't happen overnight. I think people should realize that Muslim terrorists would rather have Hillary than Trump. they sure as hell don't want Trump! Terrorists for Hillary, Islam is with her.]
[They've already been using Trump's rhetoric to justify their hatred of Americans.]
[Trust me, they have hated America long before Trump.]
[Of course. Trump just gives them much more credibility, supporters and recruitees. Both here and overseas.]
[Our statements are not mutually exclusive.]
[There's no reasoning with willful ignorance.]
[I think most Muslims support Hillary because she hasn't caricatured their entire religion as terrorists and threatened to ban them from the US. How tough she is on ISIS isn't relevant to most Muslims, because ISIS in Iraq at this point will collapse without American intervention.]
[Care to elaborate on this? I'm just curious how Hillary can be construed as a "weaker" candidate than Trump on national security.]
[He might be right. So far Hillary has been Bombing the debates.]
[Of course she has, dear. of course she has....]
[Sniff sniff.]
[Only if you mean blowing poor little Trump the fuck up.]
[It's pathetic how you can't admit that she lost the second one.]
[I think you left your logic in the fryer a bit long.]
[Islamic state... SJW Brigade... What's the difference?]
[That's not a fair statement, but one's enabling the other. And it isn't ISIS.]
[Aww. Are those nasty SJWs oppressing you again, sweetie?]
[Great question. Why don't you head to Iraq and report back?]
[Yet not one thread anywhere in r/politics about all the wikileaks material. Well done US govt....well done. ...downvotes; who would have guessed? Still doesn't change the fact that this sub-reddit is nothing but propaganda.]
[reals before feels, dude. Reals before feels. https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/search?q=podesta+wikileaks&restrict_sr=on]
[Why wouldn't they just fuck up /r/The_Donald if they had the power to? Your argument is silly.]
[Do you understand how Reddit works?]
[There have been articles. But the Wikileaks leaks weren't particularly unusual or damning. They're irrelevant]
[It's funny because it's true]
[Nah, it's funny coz Trump is throwing the election. And taking you geniuses along for the ride...]
[It's neither funny nor true.]
