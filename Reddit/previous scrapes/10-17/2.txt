[> The campaign was wildly successful. Just 40 minutes after the first donation came in, Weinberger raised over $13,000 from 552 contributors—surpassing his goal of $10,000. The fundraising has now closed.]
[>Weinberger I feel bad for bringing this up, but the fact that a (apparently) jewish person is responsible for this right after Trumps claim that a global elitist power (aka jews) is trying to prevent him from winning makes it even more sweet.]
[Fundraising period should have been longer. Closing it down before it has time to go properly viral is sort of self-defeating. But, yay, this is a good thing.]
[It's still managed to go viral]
[Why? So they can fake outrage and pretend to take the moral high ground? It would be a disgustingly cynical move to try to take advantage of a situation that one of their partisans was likely responsible for in the first place.]
[Could be that the idea wasn't to go viral but to just do a good thing]
[Not really. At a certain point you are funding bigotry instead of rebuilding damage. Glad they showed positivity to rebuild but that's where they should stop. **edit** Yes it's a good thing. I meant closing it down after it hit its mark was a good thing. At a certain point you're just donating to the NCGOP rather than rebuilding and showing solidarity.]
[Have a day off]
[These people anger me. They don't have on off switch. Edit: this has been a misunderstanding]
[I typed that on my phone so I realize its ambiguity. What they are doing IS a very good thing. I meant that shutting it down after the goal is appropriate. I live in NC. The GOP here is terrible (HB2 ring a bell?). I support the campaign because of its stance against voter intimidation, and giving them $10,000 will be more than enough to rent/set-up whatever they need to get back to their canvassing. What I'm opposed to is letting it go massively viral and the NCGOP netting a shit ton of money with which they can fight to cut voting rights and ban trans persons from bathrooms.]
["Not really" meant it shouldn't have gone on longer. your edit should say that and that 10,000 was the estimated damage amount. I see what you meant. Misunderstanding. And the social issues from the R party are dying... slowly but it's happening. Maybe one day we will discuss policies instead of this rhetoric.]
[Hopefully. But I live in NC and I see what they are doing here. It's not casual. We had one of the worst voter disenfranchisement laws in place. The courts described it as targeting african americans with near-surigical precision (I'm not paraphrasing). McCrory is NOT a good guy, and nor is the rest of the NCGOP. The DNC did a really good thing, but they don't need to enable their bigotry.]
[Just curious, how did they target only African Americans with disenfranchisement? From what I understand it was only a voter ID / govt ID required to vote, or did they ask for more?]
[[here is the most recent example of democrats standing up to voter disenfranchisement](http://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/election/article108687852.html). Don't believe Giuliani's bullshit. Standing in line to vote takes FOREVER. Bussing people to and from polls would be an ineffective form of voter fraud. It's all nonsense. Don't buy into the myth.]
[The short version: [They asked for statistics on how different races voted. This included what kinds of ID they had, early voting habits, straight-party voting, all sorts of stuff. They then targeted everything that was primarily used by black people, either restricting or forbidding them outright] (http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/30/us/federal-appeals-court-strikes-down-north-carolina-voter-id-provision.html?_r=0) The court who struck it down said that the law was designed to "target African Americans with almost surgical precision," but the state GOP continues to defend it as a "common sense" law that was struck down due to government overreach or as an attempt to defend election-rigging via voter fraud. It's a tense topic in NC right now. One of many. Edit: Here's an amusing line from another article on the subject: >[One of the most comprehensive studies on the subject found only 31 individual cases of voter impersonation out of more than 1 billion votes cast in the United States since the year 2000. Researchers have found that reports of voter fraud are roughly as common as reports of alien abduction.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/07/29/the-smoking-gun-proving-north-carolina-republicans-tried-to-disenfranchise-black-voters/) and [here's a PBS article](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/court-north-carolina-voter-id-law-targeted-black-voters/) for anyone who would prefer another source. They all say basically the same thing in the same way.]
[[The opinion is public](http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/Opinions/Published/161468.P.pdf) if you're curious about reading it. The law got rid of same-day registration, restricted early voting, banned out-of-precinct-voting, shortened early voting, and did other things to restrict populations that normally vote democratic. With regard to racial animus specifically, they requested data on the types of ID and voting practices used by African Americans, and then specifically blocked those or made those more difficult to obtain. Coupled with the fact that voter fraud is effectively non-existent, it was very clear that their intent was to disenfranchise a group that normally votes democratic in order to obtain a political advantage. The conclusion is either: NC GOP legislature is racist, or NC GOP legislature is willing to disenfranchise minorities to secure their political power. Both are disgusting conclusions, but one or the other is unavoidable. "Faced with this record, we can only conclude that the North Carolina General Assembly enacted the challenged provisions of the law with discriminatory intent. "]
[To sum up, they looked at what systems and IDs were most used by black people, and *specifically cut those* http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/30/opinion/north-carolinas-voting-restrictions-struck-down-as-racist.html http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/Opinions/Published/161468.P.pdf]

[It makes it look more pragmatic structured response, instead of a PR stunt.]
[They raised what they needed to, anymore and you know they'd probably get accused of keeping some.]
[They want to repair the damages to the firebombed office, not donate extra money to the GOP. Which is completely reasonable.]
[Well they raised more than the estimated damages]
[I thought they said the office was "a total loss", $10K while still a sizeable chunk of money isn't a total loss.]
[Could be the deductible on the insurance policy?]
[And possibly wages for people who are now jobless.]
[They should go back to raising money for the democrats now.]
[Well that's certainly taking the high road. What animals.]
[best animals.]
[I'm really glad both sides (Clinton and the local GOP that is, not Trump) could rise above the fray on this issues though. In eight years, we somehow went from the Republican nominee defending his opponent as "a decent family man" to leading chants of "lock her up." This civility is a nice step back from the chasm.]
[Classy helpful animals. Like a service dog in a tux]
["See, even the Dems support me"]
[We go high.]
[You go high only **after** you go low. Doing the right thing after one the most un-American acts of political violence is hardly "Going High". Edit: Keep raining in the downvotes while convincing yourselves that you are noble and on the right side here. A direct and violent attack was perpetrated against our democracy today and raising a couple of thousand dollars doesn't change that fact. Using it to score political points while parroting Michelle Obama is not what she had in mind when she made that statement.]
[Typical know-nothing-know-it-all. Not only does he know who did it, he knows everyone is guilty by association, and any attempt to show solidarity makes us even worse. YOU are the problem.]
[In this case, the *they* is a fringe lunatic. In this case, *we* is true americans. Of which most republicans and democrats are. And this sends the message that democrats are completely against this kind of un-american act.]
["You go high only after you go low" Guys he got us. He's exposed the giant conspiracy that all the liberals are involved in this firebombing and should be responsible for it. Oh wait, more like we have no idea who did it, and it was probably a lone actor.]
[>You go high only **after** you go low. Doing the right thing after one the most un-American acts of political violence is hardly "Going High". What in the fuck are you taking about?]
[It's a show of solidarity, and a sharp rebuke that the perpetrator is rejected by Democrats.]
[I'm sorry, do you have information about the perpetrators? Because if so, then you should take it to law enforcement. If not, you need to stop acting like you do. No one knows who did this or why, or what their political affiliations are. What we do know is that Democrats successfully led a fundraising effort that more than pays for the damage.]
[Yes because this clearly wasn't a lone act committed by someone deranged.]
[In fairness, just a few days ago this sub was on it's high horse about a militia group that supports trump.]
[We should all be on the high horse with people that use violence like this, regardless of politics]
[Agreed. Just sayin that there is a bit of a double standard here.]
[Who is "we"?]
[The same people that went low first?]
[Americans. It's almost like we're stronger, uh... together.]
[Lol ok.]
[> stronger, uh... together. I think you're onto something with this]
[Direct [response](https://mobile.twitter.com/ezlusztig/status/787842348679962624) to Trump's 'animals' tweet: >Hey jackass, Dems just raised $13K to repair that office. Took us 4 hours. That's more money than you've donated to charity - ever I ran across that a few minutes ago and then searched to find a story on the sub already.]
[But less than the Trump "charity" spent on portraits of Teump.]
[That's not true though?]
[I think he's donated more than that in his life but not a whole lot for his wealth and what he's claimed. If only we had some kind of record to verify............. But issues keep arising like the Trump Foundation, Veterans donation kerfluffle and recently a report of there not being a [record of a 9/11 donation](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/donald-trump-lied-donating-9-11-charities-article-1.2829908) he claimed he made.]
[You know he's just going to twist this, and try to make it look like the Dems paid for it out of guilt.]
[A hallmark of The GOP used to be that they were a well oiled and disciplined political machine and the Democrats were the bumbling, cam't get out of first gear amateurs. In a matter of 10 hours the Dems have acted like reasonable human beings and been able to keep this story contained; all without really breaking a sweat.]
[>acted like reasonable human beings Reasonable human beings call a presidential nominee "jackass" now?]
[If he's acting like one, sure.]
[Yes that is rather subdued compared to what the entire Republican party has been calling Obama for 8 years...]
[Why aren't Americans voting for them anymore?]
[Ah yes, the pre-Obama Democratic and Republican parties. How times have changed. Karl Rove's universe has collapsed around him and I couldn't be happier.]
[[Never forget his sacrifices] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colbert_Super_PAC#/media/File:Colbert_Report_Ham_Rove.jpg)]
[It still seems like bizzaro world to me. I came of political age when if you had 100 Democrats in a room then you had 101 different ideas on how an issue should go. 100 Republicans and you had 1 lock-step response. It floors me to see the Republicans in such disarray since the rise of the Tea Party, like watching an ancient, powerful monolith crumble. Not exactly mourning the loss, mind you, just hard to wrap my head around it.,]
[I blame George W. and his merry band of neocons. They exploited fear and radical thoughts to accomplish their foreign policy goals. The way they singlehandedly changed the language of the political discourse helped to form a rift between moderates and more extrem individuals in the GOP.]
[As formidable as the Clinton Machine is, it still took them until 1996 to really get their bearings (remeber that the first 2 years of Bill's Presidency were such a disaster the Dems lost the house for the first time in 40 years). I do credit Bill for being responsible for the current state of the Republican Party. He captured the Middle and pushed the Republicans further right, leaving disparate and competing fringe factions to fight for the heart of the Party.]
[Trump could have easily gained a few votes if he'd just paid for the repairs out of his own pocket. A billion dollars is enough to pay for those repairs one hundred thousand times over. That's an incredible number.]
[He needs that billion toe keep his ass out of poverty with the avalanche of lawsuits he has coming his way.]
[He got political capital handed to him on a platter, and felt that the right response would be an insulting tweet. He's literally his own campaign's strongest opponent.]
[After the first debate this election turned into Trump vs Not-Trump with Trump heading up both campaigns.]
[At the rate things are going, he'll probably be in a fight with the leaders of the NC GOP by the end of the week.]
[It's only an hour until his 3am tweet while he shits.]
[smart money is on something like "WEAKENED NCGOP DIED IN A FIRE BUT NOW CROOKED HILLARY'S DARK MAGIC HAS BROUGHT IT BACK AS A SHAMBLING ZOMBIE THAT WANTS TO EAT ITS OWN CANDIDATE'S BRAINS BECAUSE PARTY LEADERSHIP HAS NONE"]
[Add in: # SAD! And you got it.]
[The opposite of deplorable.]
[Before everyone starts to suck each others dicks, congratulating each other for what wonderful people we all are. let's not forget that they only reason there was a display of humanity needed was becasue a deplorable action was taken. Firebombing a political opponents office is something straight out of The Brown Shirts playbook in Munich in 1930.]
[Funny that you mention Nazis, because this could well be a false flag operation like operation Himmler (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Himmler) to push the "Dems are trying to scare us out of voting" narrative from the right. Not saying it was, but I wouldn't put it past some of the Trump brown shirts. After all, they are the ones taking pride in their expertise with weapons.]
[You're acting as though a member of the Hillary Clinton campaign ordered this firebombing, or even that a democrat was involved in anyway. We really don't know who did it, so stop acting as though you have all the answers, please.]
[The most unimaginable and un-American act of political terrorism took place earlier today and the tone of this thread is to be self-congratulatory that bare the bare minimum of decency has happened in its wake. It should be a footnote to the story, not to be cynically held out for political gain.]
[Based on your post you'd think this isn't just one post in a subforum of an internet community and rather a nationwide self congratulatory dick sucking. People can mourn and still donate money and still try to help the victims and publicize those actions. If you want to read more trajec thoughts. There is another thread, actually several threads, for those.]
[OK, you're being overdramatic. This is far from the "most unimaginable" act of political terrorism.]
[I'd say Trump's tweet was pretty disgusting and it was pretty obvious he sees this as something for political gain.]
[The bare minimum would be condolences, not this.]
[A single liberal celebrity could have made a donation equaling 3x 13K without batting an eye. 13k is really the bare minimum.]
[Dems didn't have to pay for anything and did it because of kindness, I would hardly expect anything of the sort from the Trump campaign if some of his neo-Nazi supporters did anything.]
[Remember when Trump skipped a debate and raised money instead? 250,000 went to our local small charity for veterans. Damn near a few years of their operating budget. But people say he never donates money or helps people. The critics never want to look properly for it.]
[Not to say you're lying, but is there any proof of this? I remember the media having to question Trump about if he was ever going to get around to donating the money raised.]
[Well considering he only gave money after being called out for promising to do so without doing it...]
[Took him four months, though.. and it only happened when the charity went to the media with "where's our money?" Dems did this in 12 hours. Also that wasn't his money. Also he is supposed to be the rixh one. Are Hollywood actors better businessmen than him? How come they have to foot the bill? Sad!]
[He didn't donate jack shit to us veterans. He (after being badgered) gave us money that others had donated through him. BIG difference.]
[It's moot to bicker about events that have not occurred. I have nothing else to say about the topic.]
[Is there evidence that the bombing was directed from a campaign? The brownshirt bit doesn't exactly fit if it was just some disgruntled assholes. The Dems organized to repair the damage. Don't you dare deny a well deserved dick sucking]
[Barrelful of commendables?]
[Lorry of laudables?]
[Lorry of Laudibles? Tagged America? You've either watched too much Top Gear or your tag is a smidge inaccurate.]
[And on that bombshell, it's time to end...]
[A shit-ton of badassery. ]
[A shitload of shining examples.]
[Look at the contrast between Democrats and Republicans here. First we see Clinton's first response condemning the attacks and saying how she's grateful no one was harmed. Then we see Trump's first response trying to use this as a political football to blame Clinton and her supporters without a shred of evidence to support that claim. Meanwhile democrats are out there raising money to rebuild the GOP office. Sorry Republicans, you've been outclassed on all fronts today.]
[Sure, what ever helps you sleep. The whole establishment is trying to brand Trump a facist, todays bombing was the result of the lefts rethoric, Classy indeed. And it only makes political sense a dem would start a fundraiser. Todays bombing was an attack from the left and it goes to show how little respect they have for political process of the USA. Riots,Protests,Attacks,Bombings. The right are the ones holding the moral high ground in this election.]
[One person or one group of persons did this, you don't know that they are dem or anything else. Maybe it was someone who just wants to see a war between the GOP and the Dems. I have seen enough posts on reddit and elsewhere where people are saying that they don't care about trump winning, they just want to see the world burn. As AMERICANS, you and I, though we may have different opinions should stand in solidarity that the acts that took place today on NC are unacceptable and as a people we won't stand for it. Going high means not pointing fingers and decrying this act of terrorism. As for incitement, listen to who says what and tell me who is guilty of enciting violence.]
[>And it only makes political sense a dem would start a fundraiser. Todays bombing was an attack from the left and it goes to show how little respect they have for political process of the USA. I know you couldn't keep a straight face while you wrote that.]
["Todays bombing was an attack from the left" Wow I wasn't aware you had insider information as to who did it, and that it was THE ENTIRE LEFT!! You should really take this amazing information to the authorities!]
[> THE ENTIRE LEFT NO. How could my comment lead you to believe i have "insider info" ? Or were you trying to be smart ?... 99% of those who scream Nazi and threaten Republicans are leaning to the left side of politics.]
[> The whole establishment is trying to brand Trump a facist Yea, it's the "establishment's" fault that Trump has called for the imprisonment of his political opponents, has riled up his fanatical base to lash out at media and threatened journalists, and has continuously shouted against Mexicans, Muslims, etc in his ultra-nationalistic rhetoric, right? Let's just blame the establishment, whatever the fuck that means.]
[> The right are the ones holding the moral high ground in this election they're supporting trump the traitor. so, no.]
[Hillary is a traitor to America, she recieves money from the same people who fund ISIS.]
[trump is in bed with russia, america's long time enemy for nearly a century. he's probably sharing what little intel from briefings that he's received with russian agents. if he wins, hopefully a patriot removes him from office.]
[There is no proof to your claims but there is for mine and would you prefer the USA had hostile relations with a nuclear power ? > he's probably sharing what little intel from briefings that he's recieved with russian agents. Bahahaha. Also it's not the 60's, the USSR has fallen, didn't you get the memo ?]
[> would you prefer the USA had hostile relations their warfighting ability is shit compared to us capabilities. they never launched at the height of the cold war, there is no chance of them launching now. if they did, their rusty missiles wouldn't make it out of russian airspace. > the USSR has fallen, didn't you get the memo good thing i didn't say "USSR".]
[So yeah, you would prefer hostile relations ? > good thing i didn't say "USSR". So what's the problem ? [Here have some russian propaganda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVoLgD1RIxE)]
[Let's not advocate for political assassination.]
[would the world have been better if adolf was assassinated early on?]
[>BLM-are-Terrorists You're the exact kind of person kids are going to read about in decades and think "who the fuck was so stupid and hateful back then?".]
[> "The past is a foreign country: they do things differently there." > -Leslie Poles Hartley I always try to keep this in mind when we talk about eras when the norms and structure of society were radically different, so it's interesting to have all these snapshots of hatred *right now* that we can know with certainty will be looked upon unfavorably in the future. That's a rare thing, really. We have no idea what people fifty or seventy-five years from now will think about our culture, diet, entertainment, or much of anything else. But we can say with absolute certainty that American demographics (even if you were to magically halt all immigration) will not be capable of supporting this kind of hatred in the future. I wonder what sorts of divisive hatreds will gain popularity in a far more ethnically diverse America of 2075 or 2100?]
[Rich vs poor forever]
[Like the guy in the old pictures holding the sign that reads "RACE MIXING IS COMMUNISM"]
[Why didn't trump organize something? .... some "leader"]
[> trying to brand Trump a facist If it quacks like a duck...]
[> If it quacks like a duck... So Hillary IS corrupt ?]
[Nah, but Trump is fascist.]
[Sure. And Trump is a fascist. One of those is far far worse to me.]
["The fascists of the future will be called anti-fascists" - Winston Churchill]
[I'm not a huge fan of Churchill either.]
[Oh shit guys pack it up, he brought out a quote from a political leader from 60 years ago. I guess Trump deserves to win.]
[> it goes to show how little respect they have for political process of the USA. Riots,Protests,Attacks,Bombings. The right are the ones holding the moral high ground in this election. Remind me, which party's candidate is claiming the election is rigged only if he loses? Then again, I didn't exactly expect much in terms of braincells from "BLM are terrorists" to start with. Nor bravery apparently, considering you use a throwaway for all this. Sad!]
[He's saying how the whole system is rigged in favor of Hillary and how biased the msm are. BLM are terrorists. How do i bravery ?]
[>Look at the contrast between Democrats and Republicans here. Yes, Trump is an ass who sent out a shitty tweet, but I would rather not see this become a political tool. It's kind of disappointing to see so many Dems bragging about how great Dems are for "taking the high road." Basically, this action should be used as a goodwill gesture between the two parties. Not as a way to further draw a divide. Or for Dems to bash Republicans or vice versa.]
[> It's kind of disappointing to see so many Dems bragging about how great Dems are for "taking the high road." Since when is doing the right thing and showing some class and decency not something that should be applauded? If you want to sit on the fence here or just pretend we shouldn't notice how Trump is reacting to this situation compared Clinton that's your prerogative, but don't expect me to not notice it and point it out.]
[Yeah what's even sillier is if it was far leftist who did this, they most likely are not pro-Clinton either.]
[Whoever did it isn't pro-America, that's for damn sure. Whoever it was wants to cause violent discord in our politics - whether it's someone on the left using intimidation, or someone on the right trying to foment hostility. They deserve no acclaim and should meet the full force of the law. Hopefully both sides will find a moment out of this shit to calm the discussion leading up to this election. But my faith in that is weary.]
[This is inspiring, thanks to the Democrats taking the high road on this!]
[What other road could they have taken?]
[No matter your party, we all just want a better America. We just have different paths to get there. What happened today is terrible and I am glad the Dems got out there and raised money for the NCGOP to rebuild their offices. I don't doubt that most republicans would do the same for a DNC office.]
[> I don't doubt that most republicans would do the same for a DNC office. Ehh...you probably should doubt that.]
[Better to assume the best out of everybody than the worst.]
[> Better to assume the best out of everybody than the worst. Personally I find that a good life is best lived believing the exact opposite. People will disappoint you far less often.]
[People will try to live up to the expectations set for them. Sometimes they'll end up lower. Rarely will they end up higher. Expect a lot, and you may get only a little. Expect a little, and you'll get even less.]
[Perhaps, but I'd rather pretend I'm surrounded with upstanding individuals.]
[Naaah, you're all a buncha degenerates until you prove yourselves otherwise ;)]
[<3]
[You gotta learn from past behavior, too.]
[So shines a good deed in a weary world]
[I'd like to think this is how most of the U.S. works. While the handful of few political Titans boom their agenda/rhetoric across the throws of social media, it's the quiet masses that work together to make right.]
[This is exactly the response I was hoping to see. Fight violence and threats of retaliation with compassion. To the person suggesting this could be viewed luke helping a Hitler campaign office rebuild, come on dude. This is how you win over people who think differently than you (not Trump, but his marginal supporters), not more of what he's proposing.]
[I'm opposed to most [of] what they stand for, except their right to stand for it. From the donation comments. Perfect.]
[What would Christ do? Donate to this kickstarter, probably.]
[No, he wouldn't? The Republicans are literally Rome in this "example", they do not need your money!]
[Jesus wasn't really in the habit of using money]
[Jesus saves. Moses invests.]
[Many on the GOP side proudly embraced the "deplorables" title representing the worst of them. It's nice to see a group rebuking the bad apples by demonstrating compassion and humanity.]
[Who *actually* believes this was a democrat terrorist plot? Why would Clinton staffers do this? This attack can only hurt the democrats. Logically the most likely suspect would be a disgruntled employee.]
[It doesn't have to have been a Clinton staffer to still have it done by a Democrat and while it's plausible that it could have been a disgruntled employee I'm not sure how such a person is the most logical suspect.]
[I think most people assume its someone who really hates Trump or Republicans in general, hence the graffiti across the road from it. Nothing at this point is conclusive though.]
[That message just makes me think some 16 year old bombed the joint.]
[Show them not the example of our power but the power of our example]
[Probably be better off renting space somewhere with that money. Clock's ticking]
[Is anyone running a fund raiser for a crimestoppers-like reward for info that brings these assets to justice? Since this effort's goal has been met I'd be happy to donate to any effort that incentives turning these guys in.]
[Offering cash for information, particularly for something that gets national (if not international) press, very rarely contributes to the actual investigation. You know the FBI has to be there. This is a major league crime from the US government's POV. The resources are definitely being spent as we speak.]
[Good. I want the GOP to lose in November because of a resounding "no" from the American people. Not because they were intimidated into disenfranchising themselves.]
[People taking too much pride in this also worries me a little. Best not to literally be a South Park caricature of a liberal. Best case scenario they're already insured and whoever hands over the money can request that the money be donated to a cause both sides can agree on, like a homeless shelter or something.]
[I'm not sure how long it takes to get money from a gofundme, but I'm sure it's quicker than the insurance claims process. If nothing else, the NCGOP knows there is money to cover the cost coming in without any uncertainty of an insurance company waffling over an investigation. And that means they can start the rebuilding process immediately. The damage can't be undone, but the disruption can be minimized as best as possible.]
[No -- they go low, we go high. Making exceptions for political opponents is antithetical to almost every ideal of liberalism.]
[I didn't mean it like that. I meant that on twitter some people are really digging into a "YEAH LOOK HOW GREAT WE ARE" shtick and I'm like "dude shut up, just be chill about it".]
[Ah, I agree completely. Bragging about it defeats the purpose]
[Generosity and compassion is the first step, humility is the second.]
[13k was donated by a handful of compassionate Democrats to show that humanity supersedes politics. However... This is being spun into a story of "Democrats take the high road". The actual donators don't seen very pleased with this, but maybe one day humans can just be human without adhering to such a toxic political climate.]
[> maybe one day not without voting reform. it's only downhill from here.]
[The arson was a horrible act, I want to be clear. But this is a stupid idea. The GOP don't need that money. They're a bigoted, nativist organisation who will use it to ruin the lives of women, LGBT and black people. Anyone who donated to this disgusts me, donate to PP or a homeless shelter or something that actually helps those in need, jeez.]
[THANK YOU. I feel like I'm fucking crazy over here watching a bunch of Dems pat themselves on the fucking back for donating $13k to a horrible organization that didn't need the money, like, at all. Insurance is a thing. The people who worked in the building will be staffed out of a different rental space by the middle of next week. You can come out and strongly condemn the actions without donating thousands to an organization trying to disenfranchise voters by passing racist voting laws.]
[> The GOP don't need that money. They're a bigoted, nativist organisation who will use it to ruin the lives of women, LGBT and black people. You are missing the point. This was not an attack on the GOP, or even the GOP's agenda. This was an attack on all of us, on the institutions that keep American democracy functioning. Firebombing a small office in a small town where a handful of volunteers come to exercise the democratic process is not going to make any difference to this or any other election, but it threatens all of us and our respond should transcend political differences. Yes, the GOP agenda is horrible, but the volunteers who work in this office should not be afraid to show up to do their part in the political process.]
[Someone had to clean up the mess the Trump supporters made.]
[Let's say the roles were completely reversed. Democrat field office gets firebombed and republicans raise more than enough money to fix it. This sub would literally break an arm jerking itself on the idea that all republicans are violent, ignorant and deplorable human beings.]
[Well that's why one scenario is a hypothetical and one is reality. We don't have to consider what would happen if Republicans did such a thing for the same reason we don't have to consider the discovery of Atlantis affecting the election; because neither of those things will ever happen]
[Unlike you, I am not blessed with precognition, and I don't know what will or will not happen. What I do know is that the proper response to something like this should be above political bickering, and supported by all Americans.]
[This is like donating money to Hitler to rebuild the Reichstag. nazis dont need help]
[> nazis dont need help they need a safe space!]
[It weakens their position that the other side is an irredeemable enemy. The cost to Democrats is negligible.]
[That's not even mentioning that Republicans aren't Nazis. They're our neighbors, friends, and families. They're doctors, police, librarians, teachers, pastors, athletes, scientists, bartenders, and taxi drivers. They're normal people voting for what they, in the context of their lives and communities, feel is right. That the party is fragmented and inconsistent with its own values does not mean that the individuals in the party have broken in synch with it. I won't pretend I can rationalize a vote for Trump but neither would I wish harm on the people who vote for him.]
[> They're our neighbors, friends, and families. They're doctors, police, librarians, teachers, pastors, athletes, scientists, bartenders, and taxi drivers. They're normal people voting for what they, in the context of their lives and communities, feel is right. I mean...so were Nazis. Now I'm not saying the majority of fascists are Republicans, but pointing out that fascists have day jobs and places of residence doesn't really say much about their political activities.]
[I like how everyone here selectively forgot that Democratic demonization of Republicans is what most likely inspired the attack in the first place.]
[You don't know that, so stop spewing nonsense and wait for the facts.]
[That is nice of them considering they firebombed it.]
[So anyone else think a Republican did this to further fuel Trumps propaganda machine? My first thought was "is that Trumps handwriting?"]
[Cmon man. I hate trump but I hate conspiracy theories more. Not everything is a false flag.]
[Aww that feels pretty good.]
[This is why I don't consider myself a democrat. I'm not one to buddy up with crypto-fascists or those who help them.]
[fucking idiots. dumbass rich liberals. "what did you do to fight fascism?" "I raised $10,000 to help the fascists rebuild an office"]
[You're the leftists we should be purging. People like you are the trumpsters of the left]
[w/ all this radical purging talk you sound closer to trump in fact...]
[You realise this firebombing helps Trump more than it hurts him, right? It is exactly the wrong way to fight "fascism". Fundraising is a nice gesture, and a good thing to do.]
["What did you do to fight fascism?" "We raised $13,000 to rebuild one of our enemies' offices. We showed compassion in the face of radical violence -- for no other reason than because it was the right thing to do. While Trump was raging on Twitter, calling us all animals, we were out there helping people. When they went low, we went high. We fought fascism with kindness."]
[> We fought fascism with kindness lol]
[You can be as smug as you want to be. It won't change the fact that this a real point. This is a gesture that says, "We believe in the democratic process. We don't think *any* party deserves to be made the victim of political violence." And that is a blow against fascism.]
[i'd wager that it's tactically the right move.]
[This was a state GOP office, not strictly a Trump campaign office. I'm not a fan of the GOP or their positions on most anything, but I don't think they're all fascists. Scoff at empathy and kindness if you want. Your loss.]
[It's symbolic. Academic. Trump isn't winning with or without this office.]
[lol who cares. this office still contributes to NC GOP politics (racist gerrymandering, voter suppression, etc.). sorry, I donate money to those who need it. not white nationalists. moralize someone else]
[nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnananananananannannan shitbird.]
[God, I'd hate to see how you'd respond if someone was injured or died because of this. As a liberal, you embarrass me. If this was someone on the left, your type of mentally is what is fuelling it. Dial it back there, Che.]
[At least six black churches were deliberately burned down last year. Where was the crash defunding for that? I guess you can't posture with a feeling of smug superiority when you're rebuilding black churches and mosques]
[Sorry, they're still people. Albeit many are racist, sexist bigots but still a person. If people can be a product of a system at an level then these supporters are a product of an old and tired system. I don't hate them for it, but I don't agree with it.]
[Sometimes the best way to garner support for your cause is to lend a helping hand to your opposition.]
[One of the most important factors in keeping fascism at bay is having a competent opposition party. It should be in everyone's interest that political parties be free to operate without the threat of terrorism]
[what are you going to say if this turns out to be a Reichstag fire situation]
[I'm sure it was trump loonies but I highly doubt it was people who worked in the office. It was just unhinged trumpers who wanted to lash out against Paul Ryan. No harm in helping the people who work in the office and setting the example that this isn't right regardless of who did it. trump hasn't even adressed the issue of his supporters planning a terrorist attack to kill babies after the election. If there was anything that should br disavowed the entire election it should be the trump terrorist in kansas.]
[Then what better response than to help mitigate the damages? If the fire was started to frame liberals, then liberals helping rebuild would mitigate that. If the fire was started by liberals, then liberals helping rebuild would mitigate that. Either way, it's the right thing to do.]
[No matter who did it, there is nothing to regret about a swift and strong public reaction against any attempt to silence political speech of any kind.]
[Exactly, it doesn't have to be about who committed the act or even the politics of either party. It can simply be a small gesture that deflates the hysteria around the rhetoric.]
[The NCGOP wouldn't be responsible for this if it's an alt right nutjob. Anymore than Hillary would be responsible if it's a liberal. The NCGOP page responded gracefully to the Clinton campaign's tweet. Except for Trump and other nutjobs, political parties should be bigger than their fringe elements.]

[People cut off their dicks; I do not think it is farfetched that a democrat led mob did both the bombing and the repairs.]
[Oh fucking brother Democrats would do anything if it meant they get to sit on top of a high horse.]
[I know right. Why can't they actually be bad people so our blind hate for them can be rationally justified damn it. Fucking selfish pricks and their charity work.]
[Seeing as how it was probably peaceful and tolerant liberals who did it, guess it's the least they could do to save face.]
[Typical hillbots. God forbid you fucks get any bad publicity.]
[It's pretty simple stuff if you're playing the game of politics, "Hey, what would make us look good after extreme violence bordering on terrorism happen to our opponents? Fuck it, lets try to scrape 3 minutes worth of a Goldman Sachs speech."]
[And how much money has Trump given? Wasn't that why he was bitching about Ryan? Cause he wasn't being very supportive of other republicans?]
[I don't know how that enters into the conversation but what I am doing is pointing out that this comes from a place of being politically motivated damage control.]
[I could see that angle more if it weren't crowd funded, like if it all came directly from Hillary or her campaign.]
[Feeling guilty much?]
[It isn't guilt. It's compassion, and a show of solidarity for our fellows, as well as an act to decry the violence, something foriegn to the heart of Mr. Trump.]
[Nope, just possess a modicum of compassion and respect for our democratic process, something Donnie and his merry men of fascists seem to lack]
[As if Democrats are the pinnacle of integrity. You're a joke.]
[Standing next to you they fucking are.]
[LOL, says you]
[>Honestly, if there is some secret group of Trump supporters planning a massive rebellion against Hillary Clinton, I hope that they see this comment and recruit me. I'm here guys, pick me please!!! Say the guy asking to undermine democracy. Yeah, you know what a highroad is.]
[Seeing as we're the party that isn't in favor of torturing innocent people, I would say that we have far more integrity than the party that sold out to mango Mussolini.]
[Anything a Democrat says is lip service from this point onward. I refuse to concede to anything you'd say contrary.]
[> I refuse to concede to anything you'd say contrary. So literally nothing changed?]
[You're pretty slow I see.]
