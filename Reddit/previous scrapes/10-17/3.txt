[It's the worst thing to happen since that black fella carved that backward B on that poor girl's face!]
[What is a false flag, Alex?]
[Kinda ironic having this here for this particular post dont ya think?]
[I think automod posts it automatically to every post in this sub regardless of topic.]
[I know and believe me, I've had this thought about a lot of posts. But this time it was just too much to be pretty shocked while reading this headline and then seeing "remember to be civil." I lol'd pretty hard]
[Election day is going to be nasty.]
[I would not be surprised if at least one polling station has armed Trump supporters outside to make sure people vote right. I mean Trump is even calling for something along those lines and camping the election rigged isn't helping. No matter what the NC GOP is pushing this was wrong and should be troubling for most Americans. It could have retaliation and shows how divided this country is.]
[Are you actually trying to turn it around and blame the republicans for this? Or play Minority Report?]
[And this is why everyone should have a vote by mail option.]
[It should be, if people actually understand its importance. Hillary is going to win and because of the way her picks will shift the balance of the Supreme Court, thats a "no tomorrow" scenario for people that care about Republican issues. It'd almost be sad if that half of the country and just accepted the end. Obviously I hope no one gets hurt, but I hope people appreciate living through such a major societal shift.]
[If Trump wins I think I'm going to be sick...or at least that's what I'm going to tell my employer cuz I'm not going outside. People take this crap way too serious.]
[...and then it's going to go downhill from there...]
[Especially in NC which has become unexpectedly competitive. Shit may seriously go down. Which is sad, because when dealing with my conservative-ish friends this year, they might actually be in the mood to reconcile. they know that they made a bad choice, or merely supported one, and seem a bit more open to at least toning down the outrage to get things civil. But idiots gonna idiot.]
[I am so thankful my parents told me they got my mail in ballot like 5 minutes ago... EVERYONE should be applying for an absentee ballot and you still can register for them. Google absentee or mail in ballot guidelines for your state. There's going to be bad shit happening at the polls on election day, voter intimidation, potentially assault... Just don't risk harm to yourself because it's going to be really bad.]
[Brace yourself the next two weeks will certainly be. I do remember in 2008 when a McCain staffer or volunteer I forget carved a B on her forehead-- she claimed that Obama supporters had robbed and attacked her. Turned out to be untrue (and the B was backwards-- because she used a mirror.) I'm not saying that is the case here but either way, clearly whoever did this has some screws loose.]
[I am locking my doors, arming myself, and going to play Fallout 4 all day. Be prepared for the worst then do something fun to get my mind off it.]
[I think I'll take a vacation day that Wednesday so I can drink and go crazy.]
[This is why I'm filing my ballot early. I'm not taking the chance of running into a potential warzone.]
[I'm so glad we have mail in ballot and that if I'm lazy, I can drop it off at work (university). Get to avoid all that nonsense.]
[Vote by mail]
[I'm voting first thing in the morning and then I'm getting the fuck out of Philly. I'm so upset that I can't vote earlier.]
[Piggybacking off your comment: If your state allows for early/absentee voting, please look into doing that instead. You'll be able to fit it around your schedule, and there probably won't be a long queue.]
[Are we all on an episode of South Park?]
[Member Scuzzlebutt?]
[I suspect we're in a rerun...]
[In South Park, Trump is aware of how awful he is but the people are just idiots. So once Trump becomes self aware, then we're in South Park.]
[Some crazy militia guy is going to shoot somebody. I firmly believe this. Edit: Trumplestiltskins retarded little followers are pissed at me for pointing out simple reality. It's almost sexual, it really is. I'm getting all hot and bothered.]
[Doubt it.]
[multiply that by like fifty even]
[> ~~Some~~ Many crazy ~~militia guy~~ otherwise perfectly normal people is going to shoot somebody. I firmly believe this. FTFY. I live on a college campus and I believe we're going to have our own polling place because we're a large school and far from the nearest major urban center, but I would urge people to do whatever they can to vote without having to physically go to the polling centers. I would not be surprised at this point if at least one is stormed day of.]
[So far leftist terrorists and ISIS 3, Crazy Militia Guys 0 But yeah, quake in your boots over law abiding Americans there Berkeley.]
[>Crazy Militia Guys 0 You're like the fifth person to say this, and I'm still amazed at how little you people know. I must actually be talking to 12 year olds. Nobody who remembers the 90's is this fucking ignorant. Also it's not a contest.]
[Post literally anything this election besides the mosque incident that's unrelated. Go on do it, post something like this. Yeah, I thought so.]
[Just like the anti-Brexit lawmaker who was murdered days before the vote.]
[I love my States vote by mail]
[The party of the crazy militia people isn't firebombing candidates' offices.]
[Which isn't to say that they might not be [planning something of that sort](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/15/us/kansas-bomb-plot-arrest-somali.html?_r=0). Even after Trump loses on November 8th, cleaning up the mess he's made by enabling the least among us is going to take some time.]
[Can you expand on what you mean regarding: >enabling the least among us]
[Oh, I thought that was clear. I was referring to Donald Trump's pandering to the deplorables' deeply-ingrained need for affirmation, rallying them into a frenzy and giving them the false impression that their shitty, regressive ideas are somehow popular or acceptable. I wasn't trying to be amicable. They're assholes. Fuck 'em.]
[That's odd, isn't that how Trumpsters see Hillary supporters? Not that I support either candidate, but there is a little bit of truth in both parties, and a lot of lies (and pandering)!]
[Regarding how Trump supporters view Hillary supporters, I really couldn't care less. I've spent plenty of this cycle being amicable with them (seldom reciprocated), and as time wears on and Trump continues to open his mouth, the reasonable (among Trump supporters and the undecided) have increasingly recognized that he's dangerous. At this point, he has little chance of winning the presidency, but it's clear that we have a long road ahead to heal the damage he's done. That starts with openly repudiating the shitty (racist, xenophobic, misogynist, blahblahblah) ideas that he has enabled, and those who hold them. Zero interest in playing nice with them. Regarding both sides having good ideas, I don't disagree; the majority of the votes I filled in on my absentee ballot yesterday were for Democrats, but I also voted for a few down-ballot Republicans. I distinguish between Republicans in general and those I'll readily call deplorables. Trump is a symptom of Republican rhetoric, not Republican ideas. And while neither side is guiltless, the Republicans have a serious problem this year that may have tangible consequences for all of us. Welp, I'm tired. Good night.]
[> regressive ideas Hillary gives her followers the idea that *regressive* ideas are ok? To regress means to go backwards like so many Trump and general repubs want either the 1950s and/or how economic policies were around the times of the "robber barons" ~1900.]
[I think it's safe to say that many Trump supporters do think that Hillary's ideas are regressive; even if it's considered hypocritical to think so. The problem is that the extremists on both sides that are unwilling to compromise are why acts of violence and destruction such as those illustrated in this thread occur. For many that live in less populated rural areas, left-leaning policies don't benefit their communities, and thus they see Trump as their only option to enable them to keep their jobs (coal plants, etc.). Whereas more dense populations along coastal cities have a more progressive view because there are more opportunities for them, and typically vote blue. It's a double-edged sword for Americans when the policies only benefit specific demographics, and that's why if you look at any political map based on a popular vote, the more conservative votes lie in the middle of the country and spread out, while the more liberal votes are coastal (or major cities).]
[Give it another three weeks. For the record, militia members attack federal officials out west all the time. To the point that the FBI considers them a top domestic terrorist threat. Or did you forget Oklahoma city?]
[Can you go 1 thread without bringing up white militia?]
[Maybe if those people weren't an actual threat to national stability I wouldn't. As it stands they are.]
[I'm not siding with them, but they've had 1 attack and they didn't even kill anybody. As far as I'm concerned, ISIS is a bigger threat.]
[>but they've had 1 attack and they didn't even kill anybody. [ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_bombing) These maniacs have been around since the 90's and in that time they've killed [plenty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Las_Vegas_shootings) or people. Enough that local law enforcement often ranks them as the number one terrorist threat in the US. You are living in a fantasy land]
[So 2 events in the last 21 years is the best you have? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Islamist_terrorist_attacks]
[Dude, what the actual fuck is your argument here? First of all, these people have committed way more than 2 attacks. They do shit all the time. Second, do you seriously believe the existence of ISIS somehow means these people aren't dangerous? Are you thatunwilling to look your political allies in the face?]
[No they're planning terrorist attacks on Muslim children instead.]
[I think it's the anarchist type people need to look out for.]
[I don't really think anarchist means what you think it means...]
[The extremists who hate all forms of government and attack women and children, raid people who are right wing homes and have fire bombed political buildings here in Europe ? Ye I know who those scumbags are. Although not all believe in violence a huge majority do.]
[I'm an anarchist. On election day I'm going to walk in the room, sign my name, vote, and leave. The militia people aren't anarchists. They're fascists who are delusional enough to think they're in favor of anything resembling freedom.]
[You're an anarchist that votes and you talk about other people being delusional?]
[Do I live in a glorious anarcho-syndicalist utopia? No. Will I ever? No. So I vote. I fail to see the delusion here, please enlighten me.]
[You're claiming to be an anarchist while effectively giving your stamp of approval of government authority.]
[Whether I do or don't the state exists. I have to live with it, no? So why wouldn't I use what little influence I have over it?]
[That's actually pretty rational. Might as well make the most of things, eh?]
[I'm early voting for this reason]
[You kiddin'? I'm showing up just so I can see the freakshow]
[You have a mirror in your voting booth, but not your house?]
[I remember people saying this when Obama was elected in 2008 - he'd never make it to inauguration day. And honestly, I'm surprised there hasn't been some incident. With all the nuts in this country stirred up to the point of violence, you'd think there'd be somebody crazy enough to try and shoot the president or someone important. We're fortunate there hasn't been something like that, the assassination attempt of Reagan prompted a good portion of the gun legislation we have today. Something like that today would change everything. . In fact, I also wouldn't be surprised that if there *was* an incident of that kind, that it wouldn't be covered up for the sake of PR. They'd have a lot of good reason to keep an assassination attempt secret.]
[Well Mitt Romney and even McCain didn't have nearly as polarizing an effect as Trump.]
[Perhaps, just perhaps, the reason that no serious political violence has happened during the Obama Presidency is because some of the most violent political operatives in America are left-wing.]
[Such as?]
[> With all the nuts in this country stirred up to the point of violence This country runs on violence. It literally couldn't function without violence. And you're not only part of it, you'd defend it as just and right.]
[Which particular violence do you mean? From the local police? From soldiers on the battlefield? Or do you mean that the government collects taxes via violence as some political persecutions claim?]
[Correct. All of the above.]
[Heh, what?]
[Secret Service are good at what they do.]
[Overblown media circus and echo chamber are terms that come to mind...]
[Things have gotten worse since Obama was elected. The people are more divided and more partisan than ever. Trump has made it ok for the crazies to come out, by talking about how the election will be rigged, he validates their thoughts that violent revolution will be necessary. Tempers are running hot between most reasonable, sane people this election cycle. It won't take much for an unhinged person to listen to the dialogue and take things to the extreme.]
[> The people are more divided and more partisan than ever. As a non-American: a good portion (but not all) of the political right in the US has held rather extreme views for years. What has made things much worse since 2008 is that the same thing has been happening on the political left. Now there are more and more people moving to the extremes on both sides, which makes for a particularly hostile climate.]
[Not completely. The vast majority of the left just wants to steadily progress the country at a gradual pace. People haven't moved to the extreme left, people on the right just stopped moving forward at all and want to go back in time, before gay marriage, before civil rights, before anti discrimination laws.]
[You're right. And I think u/caninehere is specifically talking about us millennials, who tend to adopt more extreme views in college, which slowly simmer down to a general progressivism over the years, as every generation of leftists have before us. Indeed, I think a good portion end up swinging to the right later in life.]
[No, people really *have* moved to the extreme left. I consider myself center-left - more to the left than centre - and I have never, *never* seen extremism like this before. I'm a millennial, I have gone to college, I've seen college liberals before - the current climate is different. People are getting frustrated on both sides, and in my opinion it stems from a broken two-party system. Electoral reform is no longer a pipe dream, it's a necessity; and yet, in the current election, abstaining from voting or voting Libertarian is "throwing your vote away". Democrats tell you you're just helping Trump, and Republicans tell you you're just helping Clinton; nobody seems to respect a person's personal choice anymore.]
[> No, people really have moved to the extreme left. Who are the extreme left in your eyes? Do you have any examples or even quotes from these extreme leftists in the US these days?]
[imma need a scale from bernie to those communist in narcos that took over the capitol.]
[Please give an example of a popularly-held extreme-left position.]
[Nothing pisses everyone off more than saying I'll probably vote third party or write in like always. My point to them is that voting for who I actually want, regardless of their party or chance to win, or abstaining from voting is the only way to truly give your vote any meaning or power. Voting and telling yourself you only have two options is why our votes are powerless and why we only have two options.]
[>I remember people saying this when Obama was elected in 2008 - he'd never make it to inauguration day. After Obama got elected membership in racist militias groups exploded. The maniacs have been waiting for a chance to rear their heads. Trump is giving them that chance.]
[Gun and ammo sales went through the roof, as well. He was gonna take all our guns away, after all.]
[His presidency lead to a massive movement to take gun manufacturers' guns away from them.]
[To be fair, gun and ammo sales always go through the roof around big elections or anything political involving guns really. But I heard .22LR was virtually impossible to buy for years afterwards because of the panic buying induced shortage.]
[That's a pretty shitty supply chain.]
[Ironically, panic over gun laws that were never actually passed ended up making ammunition substantially more expensive and more difficult to obtain.]
[It was all just supply and demand. DHS decided to buy over a billion rounds of ammo, to cover all their agencies training needs for several years, which drove prices up and the sudden shortage caused some nuts to panic, and mass buy what they could, which drove the prices up even more. Thanks to this, I had several childhood friends that made a shit load of extra money for their young family working overtime for one of the largest independent ammo manufacturers in the country.]
[There have been multiple assassination plots against Obama. Many "attempts" were prosecuted and multiple people convicted. If you're using Reagan as an example, then yeah, obviously nobody has actually gotten that close to Obama, but as far as the law goes, "attempt" doesn't just mean "tried and failed" it typically just means taking a "substantial step" towards the objective. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_threats_against_Barack_Obama]
[> **Khalid Kelly** In May 2011 Irish Islamist militant Khalid Kelly was arrested for threatening to assassinate Barack Obama. Jeez, he's not even safe from his own kind!]

[From the Assassination plot in Tennessee: >They also planned to wear white tuxedos and top hats during the assassination attempt.]
[The Secret Service are really fucking good at their job. It's a lot like the Intelligence Community. You never know when they're doing an exceptionally good job, but if they screw up, everyone knows.]
[Just started reading about the first one, and I'm honestly surprised people were calling him the Anti-christ months before he was elected.]
[>Death ray plot In 2013, two men from upstate New York were arrested after building a "death ray" x-ray device and plotting to use it against Muslims, and other perceived enemies of the United States and Israel,[45] including Obama. The men, Glenn Scott Crawford and Eric J. Feight, were arrested by the FBI after a 15-month operation involving FBI agents posing as co-conspirators. A court affidavit described the device as "a mobile, remotely operated, radiation emitting device capable of killing human targets silently and from a distance with lethal doses of radiation." Jesus. That went from ridiculous comic book villain plot to actually pretty serious very quick. There were FBI undercover agent posing as co-conspirators to assassinate the President of the United States with a death ray machine. If that were a movie plot, people would say it's too implausible and crazy.]
[Copy paste? I saw this exact same comment yesterday. Exact same, word for word]
[You mean the part in the blockquote that I copy pasted from the Wikipedia article? Or do you mean the part below the quote? That was written by me on the fly. I've never heard about that incident before today. It would be a huge coincidence if someone wrote the exact same thing about it, but it does sound like a weird movie plot, so maybe someone said something similar? Think you could maybe find it? Would be super interesting! I know the whole "X would make no sense in a movie" is used a lot lately in regards to crazy stuff happening during this election, maybe that's why it sounded familiar?]
[Likely it was a fake and the plans/science behind the device came from the FBI.]
[I read through it and was laughing until I got to the end and was like "Holy shit they actually made a death gun. These people weren't crazy, they're fucking genius murderers."]
[People are giving Hillary a hard time for not making more public appearances. With all of Trumps hateful,dangerous rhetoric, I don't blame her. Seriously. He's made not one but 2 calls for her assassinations. >"If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks,” Mr. Trump said, as the crowd began to boo. He quickly added: [“Although the Second Amendment people — maybe there is, I don’t know."](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/10/us/politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton.html) and if that wasn't bad enough he then went on to say: >“I think that her bodyguards should drop all weapons,” Mr. Trump said at a rally in Miami, to loud applause. “I think they should disarm. Immediately.” He went on: [“Let’s see what happens to her. Take their guns away, O.K. It’ll be very dangerous.”](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/17/us/politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton.html) Donald's dark rhetoric is dangerous to our nation.]
[The first one is terrible and borderline threatening and advocating for violence. There's really no defense for it. I just don't get the issue with the second one. He points out the hypocrisy in her gun control efforts then acknowledges that guns have a purpose and are needed. I thought it all made sense in context.]
[And yet it was the GOP, not the DNC, headquarters which was firebombed...]
[Geez, somebody get these rights]
[Whhayyaaat?? If these two bozos could build an x-deathray that can kill "human targets silently and form a distance" wtf kind of secret weapons does USA/ Russia have?????]
[Ok, i WAS going to post several ways you could do it but i dont want to go on a fucking list.]
[My guess is that the FBI helped them a lot with the technological expertise in order to build a more solid case. I'm not saying that's right, but that's my guess. You can take an electron gun out of an older monitor and pretty easily create X-rays such as by bombarding copper, but I'm really curious what they think constitutes a lethal amount of radiation at a distance would be. Particularly one that would still protect the users of such a weapon by having it be mostly directional.]
[That sounds right. [The story on it from the FBI confirms the FBI provided the x-ray emitting device (rendered inoperable).](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/albany/news/press-releases/upstate-new-york-man-convicted-for-his-role-in-attempting-to-acquire-a-lethal-radiation-device) The guy was making a remote trigger for it, and maybe other stuff.]
[I know, right? I hope the affidavit just kinda embellished a little and it was more meant regarding their intentions and not the actual technical capabilities of the death ray. I guess bombarding someone with a huge dose of x-rays might eventually lead to death. But not sure how "silently and from a distance" is being achieved, hauling around a huge x-ray machine doesn't really sound effective! I would love to know details about the actual weapon. Maybe that's why the undercover operation lasted 15 months? They wanted them to actually finish the weapon and snag the technology, haha.]
[Obama: "Do you expect me to turn my back on the American people?" Death Ray Villain: "No Mr. Obama, I expect you to die! Muahahaha"]

[Have all of my upvotes.]
[Extremely well played.]
[You sick fuck]
[This is the maximal pun for this situation]
[It's going to suck and it's going to be a bad day for the US.]
[First of all: whoever committed this firebombing are terrorists, already proven to be dangerous, and should be prosecuted as such. That said, rhetoric--especially on one side--is getting dangerous here. If Trump escalates the "election is rigged" rhetoric, it could lead to violence (which I think is all but assumed at this point) and even full-out war. That's not hyperbole any more. Trump's rhetoric + his supporters are truly that dangerous.]
[How many democratic offices have been fire bombed?]
[Trump supporters are truly dangerous but this was clearly not done by a Trump supporter. Really trying hard to follow your logic.]
[Second paragraph was just commenting on recent violent rhetoric in general. Sorry for the confusion. It doesn't pertain to this particular event. At least not directly.]
[Ok, I understand. Thank you for clarifying and yes, your first paragraph seemed to say that. Would you say, though, that any claims of fraud are unfounded? Because there have been several recent examples of tampering, albeit from both sides. I wouldn't say it is wholly inaccurate to warn people to be cautious of election rigging. It's happened in the past so it could realistically happen again.]
[Bottom line: **if Trump loses, it will not be because of election rigging**. Check 538 right now. It will likely be a landslide, and you cannot rig that in America. Now if you want to talk close races, that becomes a legitimate point of discussion. But the presidential race right now **is not close,** despite what the lies the Trump camp, Breitbart, Druge Report et al. tell say.]
[Sure, I agree that right now it appears Trump is losing. If rigged means "unfair," then it's fairly hard to argue that impropriety from a decade ago is receiving 10 times the coverage of Hillary's corruption as exposed by wikileaks. But there is yet time. Supposedly we will see the 33,000 emails before the election.]
[My father supports Trump and he is definitely not dangerous, racist, or sexist. This subreddit is totally delusional. There is no sense of reality here. The number of Trump supporters that are like this or violent is very small. There isn't going to be some breakout of violence if he loses. How can anyone possibly believe that?]
[OK, But all the actual physical violence is coming from the left.]
[That's jumping to a conclusion.]
[Right, like that leftist confederate flag enthusiast Dylann Roof]
[So. A republican office gets burned and you blame Trump? Are you delusional?]
[That is absolutely not what I said. Are *you* delusional?]
[There's already violence. Whose fault?]
[I don't know. None of us do. What a ridiculous question.]
[Seems like you're appointing some blame above by saying by Trumps' tweets and the general depiction the MSM gives you of his supporters you believe.. In some way.. Trump had this coming to him?]
[Actually, yes. Trump dragged violent rhetoric into this election, and now apparently his supporters are surprised when things got violent against them? That doesn't justify this event. But the Trump campaign has been dog whistling for violence for a while now. The two are not unconnected. (Let's not forget they've been getting violent at rallies for months now.)]
[You are saying that Trump's supporters are dangerous? Did you see the title of this post you are commenting on? Did you read what was painted on the building? Fucking delusional]
[Republican uses a fire bomb, Trump is escalating... Right. American sensibility is confusing.]
[I was with you up until the point you blamed Trump and his rhetoric. Only one side is writing off a large portion of Americans as 'deplorables', and that's the left. When BuzzFeed, HuffPo, Salon and other liberal rags constantly publish hit piece after hit piece after hit piece it wouldn't be surprising for that sort of thing to encourage some radical leftists. Let's face the facts. It's much more dangerous to be a Trump supporter in this country than a Clinton supporter. Trump supporters have been physically attacked and assaulted many times this election year, namely just for wearing a Trump hat or a Trump shirt in the vincinity of someone who is so misinformed about the world around them due to getting their information from places like /r/politics and Facebook that they feel violence towards the Trump supporter is the only answer. It's sickening.]
[This is what a persecution complex looks like, folks.]
[You guys *are* deplorable though. It's not some made-up word or even an epithet, it's simply an english word with a specific definition and it fits Trump supporters. Deplorable 1-Shockingly bad in quality (your candidate) 2-Deserving strong condemnation (your candidate and you for supporting him)]
[Seriously? You're on here talking up how dangerous trump supporters are when it was a GOP office that got firebombed. How about some words of wisdom for the left who did this?]
[> How about some words of wisdom for the left who did this? Sure! How about: >First of all: whoever committed this firebombing are terrorists, already proven to be dangerous, and should be prosecuted as such.]
[Realistically, we don't know enough yet. That said, it could be a liberal thing, it could be an immigrant thing or a lot of other possibilities. It could be about Trump. It could be about Republicans not supporting Trump. Without more info, it's just assumptions.]
[Fine, but there are **far** more instances of liberals committing violence this election cycle than republicans... yet somehow, it's Trump supporters that are the dangerous ones?? Do you guys even _hear_ how ridiculous you sound?]
[Are you serious? I hope you're being sarcastic for the lulz. You aren't even close to being accurate. Even by Fox News standards. And that's a pretty low bar, of you know what I mean.]
[Yes, I'm very serious. The entire power of the internet is at your fingertips. Step away from r/politics as your sole news source for once and you'll see I'm not doing it "for the lulz".]
[So you don't have examples?]
[I'm not trying to be dense here, but your assertion that liberals have committed more violence is just anecdotal, pulled-out-of-your-ass nonsense. There's no way to even begin to quantify that in any way that makes any authoritative or truthful sense. And the fact you truly believe something so unprovable is really part of the problem.]
[You're not being dense. He is.]
[That many? Wow. Can you pick like... three? And tell us about them?]
[No. No he cannot.]
[Agreed. And Trump's twitter response is not helping things. He's only ramping up war rhetoric.]
[As his court date for the rape comes up and the world continues to crumble around him, his cries will only get more desperate and violent.]
[LOL -- "Court date". Go read a book or something, clearly reading nothing but /r/politics hasn't helped you understand how things work.]
[http://www.snopes.com/2016/06/23/donald-trump-rape-lawsuit/ The fuck are you talking about?]
[I was going to ask you the same. Still no mention of a 'court date'. It's a civil suit. Anyone can file a lawsuit against anyone for any bullshit reason. >As of now, all of the information about this lawsuit comes solely from the complaint filed by "Katie Johnson," and no one has as yet located, identified, or interviewed her. WOAH! An anonymous submission that no one knows who she is! Stop the presses, this confirms my belief Trump is really a rapist!!!! (/s)]
[Perhaps the reason it's gaining traction and credibility is that Trump has 1. bragged about sexually assaulting women already and 2. been caught on camera making sexual remarks to young teenage girls. (Or was it a preteen)? Just saying.]
[His fake made up court date of 13 yr old 'Jane Doe' and witnessed by 'Julie Doe' ..? Too bad Bill Clinton is already caught on the flight manifest of Epstien's plane to teenager island over 25 times. Trump not a once.. Keep fishing and scraping that barrel]
[I keep hearing this "civil war" thing and I really don't understand it. Some of the hardest-of-the-hardcore Trump supporters could hurt people, I'm sure of that, but A) most of his base is just stupid, not violent, and B) you need to be organized in some fashion to have an "all-out war." Are there Trumpsters meeting in secret, drawing battle lines and making plans to strike strategic targets on election day? Or is it actually just a few whackos with big guns and short tempers? And before you bring it up, yes, I've heard the horrible things people say at his rallies. But there's a big difference between screaming "hang the bitch" at a rally and actually taking up arms.]
[Except leftists are the ones actually bombing at the moment... I don't know why I comment on this sub when I only get downvoted.]
[There's absolutely zero proof of that at this time. And you wonder why you get downvoted. SMH.]
[https://twitter.com/13THFilm/status/786295040314253312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw But yeah, you'll keep on pretending that Trump fans haven't been getting violent for months now, won't you? Guess what? There are violent people on both sides now. But the honest to God truth is the only difference is it's new to the left, and that's why this news story is shocking.]
[And 3 terrorists were planning on bombing an apartment building. With people inside. They were aiming to kill as many as possible. Or is all that just a lie from the liberal media? Concocted by the liberal FBI? You can't deny that there are violent people on both sides at this very moment.]
[Very true... but that is a pretty rare occurrence compared to the number of violent acts carried out by "liberals". You have to be closing your eyes _really_ tight to not see that.]
[I've heard this said, but never supported]
[Honestly, if there is some secret group of Trump supporters planning a massive rebellion against Hillary Clinton, I hope that they see this comment and recruit me. I'm here guys, pick me please!!!]
[Not inherently violent for the sake of being violent. Violent to defend the sanctity of their country - which is absolutely how it will be viewed if they see the election as rigged and the system as broken from the top down - well then you create patriots, not just angry mobs. Don't forget, angry mobs becoming patriots is exactly how this country started.]
[> angry mobs becoming patriots is exactly how this country started. Wasn't there an intellectual side of that conflict that we just don't have with the Trump supporters? Do they have a Thomas Jefferson? Or anyone even close? I don't think so. The intellectual side of the Republican party are against Trump or at least dislike his anti-intellectual demagoguing.]
[Depends on your point of view. If things really came to a war like scenario, I think more of the Tea Party-esque figures would become more prominent in such a movement. What you will see is a cultural divide above all. It will become morality in place of intelligence as a factor. I.e. Stopping the baby murderers and stopping the corrupt establishment, stop persecution of Christians/1st amendment. The left's gun control rhetoric will be a major backfiring point on them if we ever reach that point of conflict. I'm not agreeing with or justifying all of those points, just those will be the major rallying call type things that would be heard. You have to remember one man does not make a war. You're looking at a considerable portion of your fellow countrymen, most of which are not as insane as him, but who also will not dismiss the situation we're in culturally, Trump or not.]
[> most of his base is just stupid, not violent But a not-insignificant portion of his base **is** violent. Need I link to a video of "incidents" at his rallies here? People can be persuaded. If violent portion of his fanbase is capable of organizing, that's where it gets really bad. https://twitter.com/13THFilm/status/786295040314253312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw]
[To be fair to his supporters ( only because they are also US citizens), while they have been proven to be violent to a degree, they haven't killed anyone yet. The fact that they haven't killed anyone yet, doesn't mean the animus isn't there.]
[Sure... link all two or three of them... and I'm sure you won't have a hard time linking vids of liberals committing violence, of which there have been far more instances during this election cycle. You need to get off Reddit and get some of your news elsewhere my friend.]
[>liberals committing violence, of which there have been far more instances during this election cycle. [citation desperately needed]]
[Took literally 5 seconds in google http://www.adn.com/alaska-news/nation-world/2016/06/03/ugly-bloody-scenes-in-san-jose-as-protesters-attack-trump-supporters-outside-rally/ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLtTznFB-lo]
[Those are anecdotes. They're not statistics backing up your claim that the left is more violent. I'm sorry bit it's always the same with you undereducated Trump supporters, isn't it? Time and time again I see that your types are simply incapable of rational thought.]
[Cmon friend... you know as well as I do... **NOTHING** I show you will affect your opinion... you are absolutely deaf to _anything_ I could possibly say. If you need a citation that desperately, then seek it yourself, because whatever I show you will be ignored.]
[>If you need a citation that desperately, then seek it yourself, because whatever I show you will be ignored. It's clear as day that no such citation exists. I'm calling you out on it.]
[There are also videos of anti-Trump (pro-Hilary or Pro-Bernie) supporters violently assaulting Trump supporters unprovoked. Look up the riots in San Jose during a Trump event.]
[Yes actually, do.]
[https://twitter.com/13THFilm/status/786295040314253312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw]
[You want me to link you to a video of random fights at a concert? Your justification for your position is weak and illogical. A few people get in a fight and you think some nationwide uprising will happen. This is flat out delusional.]
[Agreed, but I don't think the violent portion of his base is big or rational enough to organize, so that's where we disagree. I don't think either of us is going to convince the other since we're both speculating :P]
[You'll see the organization come election day when his supporters actually get out and vote instead of spewing bullshit on Reddit for pennies. You're in the minority you know... you're going to lose.]
[> it could lead to full-out war. The only positive is that it wouldn't really be a "war". More like a series of troublesome times and riots. They don't have nearly enough political backing, especially after Trump has burned so many bridges to the rest of his party, and so no militia of any large-scale significance could be formed nor would we see any defection of the US military of any significant form in Trump's favor. Thats not to say it won't get nasty, and certainly the news would call it a "war" but it would be more of a period of civil disorder. The Trumpians wouldn't gain territory or ever be seen as legitimate on any level to be considered an actual "war".]
[If this occurs, it'll get blamed on Republicans, who will for all intents and purposes, have imploded their party utterly and completely at this juncture- irreparably so if this occurs.]
[All it would take is one charismatic firebrand who's read a book or two on insurgency. The Army's even published what are essentially guides to establishing one]
[It would probably start out as "troublesome times and riots". From there, it will either escalate or de-escalate. The latter possibility is more likely, and supporters for the "law & order candidate of this election" will be ultimately seen as the raging hypocrites they are.. The former possibility is just terrifying.]
[Well... for certain, any caught as casualties of the civil disorder won't care whether it was a full-on war or just rioting. So truly I don't mean to downplay the horror of that civil disorder. For the individuals who could be scarred by it, it won't matter the political severity.]
[Does civil war not almost always start out as rioting? That's ultimately what I'm talking about. And riots are almost inevitable at this point.]
[I think thats a reasonable assertion, that civil war does tend to start out as rioting... But there have to be other factors in place which I just don't see here. For example, Ukraine has high levels of government corruption and a fairly young democratic government as well as outside groups who were more powerful and already actively asserting onto them along with an economy in not-too great shape. So the civil war happened and the riots came before them yes. And then we see the dictatorships which had civil wars or Iraq, another young democracy with large-scale sectarian violence which never really stopped... My point is, the USA just doesn't have all the elements needed for a civil-war. So while riots happen before a civil war, riots do not lead to civil war. We are set up for riots. We are not set up for a civil war. Hopefully my explanation wasn't too repetitive. Just trying to be clear. \^_^]
[That's fair. Good comment]
[Well it wont escalate anything but police powers]
[Easy friend-o, I'm over here trying to forget the agenda.]
[This will end well. /s]
[Whoever did it should be found, prosecuted and held fully responsible. End of story. Republican, Democrat, left, right doesn't matter. There's no place for that in this country.]
[I wonder if the horrible rhetoric of demonizing one party incorrectly as Nazis and racists has something to do with it.]
[Indeed. It undermines the entire process and makes us look barbaric in the international stage.]
[Bernie then Jill then Hillary then Jill then Hillary then Jill then IDK probably Hillary supporter here. I completely agree. Political intimidation coming from any side of the spectrum will not be tolerated or accepted. Fuck people that do shit like this. I am fearful that Trump might use this for political leverage for his conspiracy theory that the election is rigged though.]
[I'd like to hope that anyone reading this has your reaction. Unfortunately I know a lot of idiots who won't.]
[Yes. As much as I often despise the Republican party, we cannot condone any form of politic terrorism, as it undermines our democracy. Whomever did this, left or right or centrist, Republican, Democrat or other, citizen or non-citizen, young or old… they should be punished most harshly no matter whom they are.]
[Jesus Christ. The last thing we need is a Reichstag moment.]
[To be fair this kind of terrorism is perpetrated by dictatorahips all of the world with the explicit support of U.S. government. Not justifying it, just pointing out the ridiculous of being outraged by this but ignoring all that.]
[Definitely charged with terrorism]
[That's the truth.]
[Until proven otherwise, I attribute this action to a couple of drunk idiots. The individuals' political affiliation is irrelevant. It makes no sense to blame this on all Democrats or all Republicans.]
[How courteous of you to not blame Republicans for getting firebombed.]
[As noted by many others in this thread, the perpetrators could be affiliated with either major party (or a minor party, or no party).]
[Well ive seen Trump supporters saying establishment republicans should be killed I havent seen any Clinton supporters saying that. It not fair to assume the motive or political affiliation of the perp yet it could be coming from either side.]
[[Here, now you have.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7yYARGFKbM)]
[Thanks for showing me a video of black people beating up a white man. Now, can I see what he asked for?]
[No that really isn't a Clinton supporter saying establishment republicans should be killed. It's black people beating and stripping a white man.]
[WTF does this video have to do with Clinton or Trump?]
[Only one candidate in the election claims to be "at war" with the Republican party. That being said, the person you're responding to is right. The people who committed the attack are to blame, not the political party or candidate they support.]
[As long as words, protests, and elections continue to fail, and [inverted totalitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_totalitarianism) rises, there will be no choice but to escalate. As choices diminish and history repeats there is but one constant outcome.]
[I honestly came to the comments half worried there would be some cheering or at least some "well who is really surprised". I am glad to see this. We are all still americans.]
[Funny. That's how rule of law works, something Trump specifically and the GOP more generally doesn't believe in. Guess it's like the Geneva convention, you need to not torture prisoners, bomb hospitals or arrest diplomats even when your opponents don't adhere to those principles, because otherwise nobody will follow them. Oh wait]
[Reddit. You gilded this comment. Why did you guild a comment that claims it's a good thing to prosecute a criminal, regardless if their political affiliation? Have you become so rabidly psychotic your political bias influence your perception of morality?]
[Yeah. It goes without saying. Why is this comment upvoted ?]
[That's a bold stance.]
[Seriously. It's not like it even matters what the noun in that sentence is. You can't firebomb shit you don't like.]
[Interesting that this is skyrocketing to the front page on the supposedly evil Shillary subreddit, and the top few comments I'm looking at are all clearly Hillary supporters / Trump opponents condemning it. Meanwhile, I still see a ton of "typical tolerant left" and "haha good luck getting this to the front page" comments trying to pretend their side is actually perfectly innocent and their opponents are all violent thugs. All amid recent news of a foiled right-wing terror plot to bomb an appartment complex housing over a hundred Somali immigrants, news of the press being threatened at Trump rallies, an Arizona newspaper receiving death threats for endorsing a Democrat, another protestor being attacked at a Trump rally, armed protestors sitting outside Democratic offices, and Mr. Sedition himself calling for poll watchers and claiming the election is going to be stolen from him. Perhaps you should join us in acknowledging that there are unfortunately morons on both sides and condemning all forms of violence and intimidation, regardless of who has done it. Violence does nothing but make you look bad, and it's not how a supposedly first world country should be conducting itself. That goes for the liberals I see calling this a false flag without proof as well.]
[> Interesting that this is skyrocketing to the front page on the supposedly evil Shillary subreddit, and the top few comments I'm looking at are all clearly Hillary supporters / Trump opponents condemning it. Scroll up. >"This is the problem with inciting violence in a campaign. You can't always assume it's going to be your followers committing it." >"For they have sown the wind, and [they shall reap the whirlwind](http://imgur.com/gallery/44jJY)" >"Unless the rhetoric is dialed back, **things will just get progressively worse** as we approach election day." 100% "you asked for it", with bonus "more coming."]
[The 7th reply down, marked controversial, that I downvoted 2 hours ago? *Replying* to a top comment, getting marked controversial, and being ranked lower than several other replies doesn't fit my definition of "a top comment", nor did I claim that there is nobody anywhere in the comments on the left acting like an idiot, as evidenced by my condemnation of the "false flag" idiots.]
[With all they Alex Jones support, I wouldn't rule out a false flag attack. However if it's not, there's deplorables at the extremes of the right *and* left, and this should be condemned by all. This is not how we are to act.]
[Yeah funny how reddit is controlled by Clinton and the story about trump supporters being busted for planning a literal terrorist attack the day after the election got a solid 30 minutes of attention.]
[I would prefer we wait and see WHO did it if possible instead of guessing what party or belief they belong to. Spraypainted words don't tell us who did this, or what their motivations were. Talking to the person or finding out who it is sure might though.]
["Interesting that this is skyrocketing to the front page on the supposedly evil Shillary subreddit" I agree with you for the most part, except this. Acknowledging domestic terrorism doesn't all of a sudden mean this sub doesn't practice blatant censorship. Where are the anti hillary posts? Pro trump posts? You'd think there would be a few of each to *atleast* create the illusion that there isn't bias, but not even. *REPORT ON WIKILEAKS FFS.* Everyone here seems to think you have the election in the bag, so what are you so afraid of huh?]
[I don't know, it doesn't fit the narrative. Hillary has no reason to do this or want this to happen...that I can think of at least. In this case, it fits the narrative more to have this go to the top than make sure it never leaves ground. How would that look?]
[Because its a non partisan issue.......... You don't see wikileaks about Clinton anywhere near the front page.]
[I have three in /all on my top posts, one from undelete, one from uncensorednews, and one from hillaryforprison. And that's not counting the_Donald since I have them filtered out.]
[probably because the vast vast majority of wikileaks "blowing the truth wide open!" scandals are bullshit nothings. and by this point it's the whole boy who cried wolf thing where i frankly have seen so much inane nonsense being talked about from wikileaks that my initial reaction is to just not trust anything about it.]
[Yeah, I mean with how heated this election has been on both sides and all the violent rhetoric thrown away and talk of people who are excited to go "poll watch" with their rifles in minority districts I am not surprised this kind of thing happened. I won't dismiss the possibility of a false flag until we have someone in custody over this though, especially with how despicably desperate Trump's supporters are getting as the man goes down in flames (oops sorry :/ ) at the 11th hour. Talk of revolution, death threats, etc being thrown around...it's always well a well-known quip that you should "Never let a good tragedy go to waste" and that includes a created tragedy.]
[You're disgusting.]
[Yeah I don't care what you think even a little bit. Sorry if I'm not naive enough to immediately jump to an enraged state of bias.]
[You should be apologizing for your gross comment instead.]
[Sorry not sorry, but I won't. Especially not to someone who has an account named after some perverse desire to beat a candidate by them becoming ill and dying. If that "joke" (barely even a joke) offends you then you're going to have a hard time listening to *any standup comedian ever.*]
[That was a joke? Which part? > named after some perverse desire to beat a candidate by them becoming ill and dying You really think Trump supporters are evil, don't you? I bet the firebomber had a similar outlook.]
[Evil? No, but some of them have an awful lot of hatred. Their emotions are being manipulated by those who see a way to use it for their own political ends.]
[Woof. I think they're generally pretty obtuse or ignorant. Or signing a "deal with the devil" at the expense of hypocrisy and furthering something VERY shitty. But sure, try and compare me to a firebomber with that hyperbole. And I'll remind you that the three terrorists who were stopped from *murdering* 150+ refugees the other day had a similar outlook to most Trump supporters.]
[> "poll watch" with their rifles in minority districts Share your drugs please. That must be some good shit you're on.]
[Did you seriously just make a "go down in flames" joke after an act of political terrorism? That's a little gross dude, like, no matter who you support]
[An act where *nobody fucking died* yeah. Oh, sorry, was that *joke* not politically correct enough for you?]
[reminds me of the idiot girl that carved a "B" on her face backwards then claimed "a black man that supported barrack obama did it!!!". Later, she got busted as people pointed out that it was backwards and the result of doing it in a mirror......]
[[Your comment reminds me of this lesbian that carved homophobic slurs into her own skin.](http://abcnews.go.com/US/nebraska-woman-charlie-rogers-faked-anti-gay-hate/story?id=17057847)]
[Jesus fucking Christ, yeah buy all your attackers items right before you do it....what a fucking idiot.]
[To be fair there was a pretty huge chunk of time where this story was only on the Donald sub.]
[I, as a Clinton supporter upvoted this story, it needs to be known and the actions widely condemned, no matter the perpetrator.]
[Thank you for breaking from the mold and helping create a non-partisan discussion on this subreddit, at least for this short while.]
[Bingo! I agree. As a non trump supporter.]
[Cheers. Violence is never isolated in volatile environments like this election. I dislike and condemn what has happened to day, but I *fear* what the response to this will be.]
[Exactly. I frankly think that the language used sounds fakey and forced, but if this really *is* what it looks like at a glance, then it's fucking reprehensible and the perpetrators need to be punished to the fullest extent of the law, full stop.]
[Exactly. Both the action taken and the race baiting reply are entirely unacceptable.]
[Same here!]
[And this is the difference between politics and whatever Trump is doing. All we can do is keep leading by example.]
[100%. One of the reasons I'm so fervently anti-Trump is that I don't want to see this country devolve down this path--which I think it will if he's elected (and still might even if he loses). The perpetrators here aren't any partner of mine. Fuck 'em.]
[This election has gotten so out of control that it can equally be a left wing nut job or a nutty Trump supporter since he basically bastardized the GOP.]
[I'll be honest, i'll still put more blame on this for Trump than Clinton. Even if it is (likely) an extremist left-winger. His kind of rhetoric does nothing but draw out the extremists not just from his party, but from the other side as well. Both parties and their candidates have a responsibility to not use rhetoric that draws them toward action beyond the ballot box. However Trump, with his continued talk of conspiracies and imagined threats incites this kind of action not just from his base, but from nutcases on the other side as well. Its why keeping the level of discourse at a mature level is important. Its why the childishness in this one is so harming to our country.]
[> Its why keeping the level of discourse at a mature level is important. That train left the station a long time ago. This election is not a rational argument.]
[Absolutely. At this point its still worth noting the consequences of it getting to that point.]
[Calling 1/4 of the American public racists and Islamophobes is mature? This shit is on no one but the bomber. But don't act like the left is innocent and friendly, they are both scumbags who keep throwing fuel on the fire]
[If its accurate it is simply stating fact.]
[Really, where are the statistics? These scumbags are just feeding their side's egos so much that you'll believe anything they say, because it means you get to think the other side is so objectively wrong in every single way. Use your fucking brain, this shit is so fucking disgusting it blows my mind that people can even say things like that with a straight face. I can't believe this kind of hate for our fellow countrymen is what we're cheering for this election, on both sides.]
[please go to /r/the_donald and shake your head in disappointment]
[Dont want to get branded a racist\sexist\etc? Dont line up behind a blatant one. Simple as that.]
[There's that unflinching ego, you know all the facts don't you because you've been fed them daily for the past 8 months. You're so braindead you assume I'm a Trump supporter because I won't stand beside you on this garbage. I'm not a Trump supporter and I've seen the "evidence" and I think it's nonsense, how about you work on talking up your own candidate instead of continuing to spew this pathetic vitriol]
[I assume you're a trump supporter because you immediately go off on insults and talk like a child.]
[And so when I tell you that I don't support Trump what does that tell you about yourself? Or does your ego just brush it off because hell, I think different than you so I must be lying and I'm obviously a Trump supporter.]
[Or it's the fault of the person who did it. Sick of how something bad happens in this culture and everybody runs off to blame everything else but the perpetrators.]
[Sure. At the time i was talking in context with Trump blaming Hillary for this. That may not have been clear. Ultimately its the person responsible, but if someone is out there inciting violence, its perfectly valid to assign them some blame.]
[Yeah, because no one exists in a vacuum. Including Trump and his rhetoric. If you truly believed what he says, and that America will come to an end, Hillary is literally a demon or the ant-Christ, your family was going to be sent off to concentration camps....how would you react? Especially knowing your side is losing. Seriously? Most people do nothing because as much as they eat it up, they know its all bullshit, but they like the primal hormonal release of being angry about it. But some people do believe it...and they act as rationally as anyone would if they truly believed it. You literally can't blame them.]
[I'm sure many trump supporters will be perfectly reasonable and not blame hillary for this...]
[Victim blaming]
[Yeah, but he was ASKING FOR IT!]
[Driving home today I saw older people stopped on the side of the road taking their pictures next to a large trump sign. Was kind of strange, I actually saw a few trump signs, and they were pretty damn large.]
[Or it could just be a domestic terrorist and we don't have to insinuate each candidate's supporters by generalizing their behavior.]
[Fucking right, but I agree that it's stupid how we got to a point where it could be blamed on either side, and absolutely insane that members of each side have begun accusing the other with no evidence because it just goddamn happened]
[I agree. Please just don't let it be a woman, Muslim, African American, or Mexican. That will just feed the basket.]
[Please make it be a cis white male! But not Muslim!]
[Podesta?Is that you?]
[Perhaps it will be a deplorable, or a superpredator! Mayhap even a basement dweller.]
[It's most likely one of the "your a fuckin white male" type white college kid.]
[[deleted]]
[Racists]
[Not that I think it is right but I sure as hell hope so. One more trigger on a racial front and I just fear where it will lead.]
[Shouldn't be a place for it in any country, if I may say so myself.]
[But you guys seemed ok with ignoring the mexican flag waving "fuck america" rioters outside the trump rallies...]
[What do you mean by "you guys"]
[True]
[[deleted]]
[What is it if it's a GOP false flag? I have doubts about it being plain old domestic terrorism because it might just be false flag domestic terrorism.]
[Look, those accusations should wait until we find out more from the investigation. It was wrong for Trump to go pointing fingers and it's wrong for everyone else too.]
[I'm the one saying I have doubts. The one above me said "no doubt about it" -- that's the dangerous thing you're trying to head off at the pass; I believe my comment to have been completely innocuous. For all we know, the police on the scene are Trump supporters and want Dem blood. The evidence is in their hands. All it really takes is one person with a commitment to change the outcome. If that person is smart, he or she won't get caught.]
[Just hijacking a top comment to add the Clinton camp's response so far. https://twitter.com/hillaryclinton/status/787763497308418052 The attack on the Orange County HQ @NCGOP office is horrific and unacceptable. Very grateful that everyone is safe. Edit: and Trump's: https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/787782613633208320 Animals representing Hillary Clinton and Dems in North Carolina just firebombed our office in Orange County because we are winning @NCGOP Thanks to /u/chanlonxp1 and /u/dubalubdub Edit 2: Trump's second tweet. 5 minutes after the first. https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/787783828358258688 ALL SAFE IN ORANGE COUNTY, NORTH CAROLINA. With you all the way, will never forget. Now we have to win. Proud of you all! @NCGOP]
[> Animals representing Hillary Clinton and Dems in North Carolina just firebombed our office in Orange County because we are winning That is a dangerously inflammatory thing to say in a situation where there are no real facts or proof as to who did this yet. Not to mention blatantly exploiting a tragedy for political gain like this is disgusting no matter where you place yourself politically. How can you get away with saying something like that but at the same time blaming MSM for being so inflammatory and biased against the right?]
[There isn't very much in common between a county party office and the Reichstag.]
[>Animals representing Hillary Clinton and Dems in North Carolina Oh? How have they determined that it wasn't Stein or Johnson supporters? And how do they represent anyone? Did Hillary endorse them when we weren't looking?]
[I personally like how Clinton didn't gloat or try to make the attack about herself. It's nice that there is at least one human being in the race.]
[Good god Donald Trump is a steaming pile of shit. He can't drop his stupid politics for 5 seconds and just be respectful.]
[You can see which is really Trump and which is his aids posting to his twitter.]
[So Trump is formally accusing the Democrats/Clinton campaign of committing this crime? Please don't let this be the Reichstag fire of 2016. This is frighteningly similar to how Hitler came to power.]
[Just to clarify - how do you tell if #2 came from iphone or android?]
[I think there are some third party apps that can tell. Tweetdeck is one I believe.]
[Ugh the responses to Clinton's tweet are repulsive. I'm saying this as a Republican, this is definitely not the time to be acting like that.]
["Let's say Trump supporters firebombed a DNC field office. Would the talk of evil violent Trump supporters ever end?" - Ben Shapiro on Twitter]
[I was very confused about why Donald Trump would accuse North Carolinian Democrats of attacking an office just south of Los Angeles until I read this comment fully.]
[I would bet my life that this was trump loonies lashing out after hearing trump lash out against the GOP. This is the 2nd time in a week trump loons have been involved in actual terrorism.]
[Is that her public or private opinion on this terrorist attack?]
[What is it that people don't understand about the public and private comment? It was in regards to how Lincoln was able to politically get what he wanted. When the GOP says they want a 1 trillion dollar tax cut it is because they want to negotiate it down to billions, just as when democrats say they want 20 percent increase in education spending they really want 10 percent but if they said 10 they'd end up at 5. You can say that it really means that Hillary doesn't mean what she says and won't hold to her campaign promises, but do you really think republicans don't do the same exact thing? In order to survive in politics you have to be good at politics and this is just part of it.]
[I woulda been tickled if Hillary called the attack deplorable. I know that's not her sense of humor, but still...]
[Trump is just stoking the fires even more. He's dangerously stupid.]
[He was ASKING FOR IT!]
[It's not stupidity, it's how fascism wins. We have history books.]
[Look at the deplorables in the comment section. This is why Trump needs to lose.]
[I still don't see how people can vote for someone who has been revealed to be so extraordinarily corrupt. There is no place for corruption in America. That's like the number one thing we hate in politicians and people are voting the Queen of Corruption this year. It blows my mind.]
[She's definitely the Queen of Corruption, I mean look at all the indictments and criminal convictions!]
[Either she's relatively clean, or she's fucking *incredibly* competent and crafty, or literally every person investigating her family for decades is a complete incompetent crapsack.]
[> or literally every person investigating her family for decades is a complete incompetent crapsack Well.. congressional republicans *have* been pretty damn useless the last 8 years.]
[So far the Republicans have maintained both Congressional majorities and Clinton hearings from [1994-2007](http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0774721.html). Then they lost if for a few years here and there among the House and Senate, but for the last few years as well. An immense amount of time to completely fail at their goals. hhaha]
[Nah, they've just spent all their time blocking Obama from doing anything.]
[Yeah, but we're talking a lot longer than that, and not just legislators.]
[So Trump, then?]
[Neither.]
[unfortunately one of them will be elected...]
[Yea I mean paying off politicians with charity funds is beyond reprehensible. https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.businessinsider.com/r-new-york-attorney-general-has-opened-investigation-into-trump-foundation-politico-2016-9]
[Liberals firebombed the Republican HQ but somehow, someway, it's our fault. Whatever happened to no victim blaming? Edit: Oh of course you're all for victim blaming when the victim disagrees with you. You sick fucks.]
[> Liberals firebombed the Republican HQ Could you provide some evidence of that? I haven't seen any.]
[See my other comment. If "REPUBLICAN NAZIS LEAVE TOWN NOW OR ELSE!" was written on the walls of the firebombed building I highly doubt it was another fellow Republican or someone with no political leanings.]
[Bro. It was obviously the fucking Amish. Get your shit together.]
[What evidence do you have that it was liberals? If you know who it is, you should speak up. If you don't know who it is, then you honestly have no idea who firebombed there. You're not a victim here, the building and people who it affects there are victims.]
[Well geez, the perpetrators spray painted "NAZI REPUBLICANS LEAVE TOWN OR ELSE!" on the walls. So obviously it must be a fellow Republican!!!1 Autist.]
[Not sure if you realize this, but not all non-Republicans are Democrats (or Leftists, or Liberals). It's kind of hard to tell in our current political climate, but there are actually a series of defined political beliefs. Some acts, surprisingly enough, aren't even politically motivated or associated with a major political party. Putting the world in such black and white terms is shortsighted and hinders the thorough investigation into the motives and perpetrators of acts of violence like this.]
[The culprits wrote something about "nazi Republicans", does that sound like anyone but leftists to you?]
[It sounds like a lovely false flag. Or just a psychopath who indulges in too much exaggeration. Just because someone disagrees with Trump doesn't make them a leftist.]
[How you can say this with a straight face on this story is staggering to me.]
[GOP HQ is firebombed. Leftists still find a way to be a victim.]
[You don't happen to support the billionaire who says the system is rigged against him by any chance, do you?]
[Let's not talk about the people who had their office firebombed. Liberals have had their feelings hurt.]
[If, perchance, this was done by a Trump supporter, wouldn't it be the exact sort of attack that would affirm the victim status Trump playing with?]
[No. Because Trump is always right. In this particular case it would be met with: The perpetrator is Clinton plant setting up the bombing to make Trump look bad.]
[And if Trump supporters are arrested, he can say it's a conspiracy. This is the third world dictator rabbit hole he's gone down.]
[> Let's not talk about the people who had their office firebombed We were, and then someone tried to derail the conversation by blaming people without any evidence. :-/]
[Yes, of course.]
[Good on Clinton. Violence isn't the answer in politics no matter how much you despise the other side.]
[But she said nothing about why we need to sat and against their kind.]
[Could you rephrase that? I don't understand the statement.]
[I meant stand against their kind. They use their NRA against us.]
[Are you talking about how usually after a mass shooting Democrats go after the NRA? Are you saying they're being hypocritical for not going after their fellow Democrats? I'm sure once we get more info she'll expand upon her response.]
[Whose NRA and who is us, lol]
[Unless you happen to run wikileaks... then it's cool to ask about drone striking him]
[You say that as if you expected her to tweet "Horray for firebombings!".]
[> Violence isn't the answer in politics That isn't strictly true.]
[Yeah! Surely a leftist "liberal" mainstay like huffpo wouldn't call for political violence? Oh. Right. :( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jesse-benn/sorry-liberals-a-violent-_b_10316186.html]
[Let's ask Russia 'bout their take on her take on violence.]
[We're all supporting political violence in Mosul right now.]
[You are absolutely right! This is not the American way! This is not who we are. In America, we have a good rousing argument before an election, then afterwards we shake hands and make up and go about the business of running the nation. We don't hold political grudges to the point of physical violence! That's about as unAmerican as you can get. Remember, in America, majority rules. If you are not in the majority right now, you are still a good American and you must protect the American way. That means free elections and the peaceful transfer of power. People have died for this democracy. Now we have to protect it. The only way to do it is vote your conscience and then respect the result. If you don't like it, you will have another chance in four years. If you destroy America with violence, none of us will ever get another chance, so cut that nonsense out and go support your party in the traditional ways. Vote your conscience and maybe drive down to the old folks home and give a few of those guys a ride to the polling center so they can vote too. That's how we do it. Any election-related violence is a threat to our democracy, and anybody who commits such an act is not a patriot but a traitor and a villain of the worst kind.]
[Well said.]
[> then afterwards we shake hands and make up and go about the business of running the nation. . . . unless you can force a sequester or threaten to shut down the government, or try to repeal the healthcare law over 100 times. . .]
[Trump immediately blames Clinton supporters for the violence without any evidence... That's totally not gonna influence violence in the other direction, no-sir-ee. I'm staying the fuck home on Nov. 9.]
[So, wait, who do you think they are? Bernie Bros? Like it or not, these are Clinton supporters. They don't reflect on Clinton any more than neo-nazis who vote Trump reflect on him. But they are her supporters.]
[It's okay though for CNN, A major news organization, to blame Trump for the firebombing though?]
[Nowhere did I say that. Complete strawman. One action does not justify, excuse, or minimize the other.]
[But no one is saying crap about it. You guys have to bring up Trump and say he is playing the blame game, but fail to mention that joke of a news organization already blaming this on Trump for whatever reason when in reality, this is the MSM's fault. They started this BS and put ideas in obviously insane people's heads.]
[I had specifically responded to a comment about Trump's tweets. I don't watch CNN or pay it heed because of bullshit like that. Same reason I don't follow Trump on Twitter. I just happened to see his tweets here; haven't heard anything about CNN's coverage other than from you. If I had, I'm sure I'd condemn Time Warner (and have many times) for their sensationalist coverage to garner views.]
[To be fair, there was no evidence from his accusers regarding the sexual assaults and yet the leftists accept that as truth]
[Multiple unconnected reports by alleged victims help to corroborate one another, and combined with his statements that he can "do whatever he wants" and "grab them by the pussy," it's easy – though not a given – to assume his accusers are telling the truth. He's innocent until proven guilty, but by his own admissions and boasts, he's put himself in a bind when these types of accusations reveal themselves. What you're describing, giving the benefit of the doubt to women who come forward about sexual assaults and abuses, is wildly different than blaming a terrorist attack on your political opponent's supporters before any evidence surfaces. He's just fanning the flames of violence here. He continues to display wild temperament and poor judgment with his rhetoric and actions.]
[Yeah, it's a real he said/she said the same thing (that he kisses/gropes people without asking). I'm not sure which one to believe... both of them, or the denial by his supporters. So difficult.]
[Vote by mail ahead of time!]
[No way, we have to vote. The last time Trump's party got control of the executive branch we lost the economy, two towers, a war in Iraq, and the city of New Orleans.]
[The election is the 8th. I said 9th :) as in the day after.]
[Damn you aint gotta work on Wednesdays?]

[Election day is Nov. 8th dude.]
[[Not according to Trump](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-tells-rally-crowd-to-vote-on-november-28-2016-10)]
[I hope you sent in your ballot by mail already. I wish I had. I really don't want to be out there when violence erupts as trump loses.]
[So you are in a thread about violence against republicans, but you are somehow worried about republicans being violent? What the fuck?]
[Last I checked being attacked doesn't make you incapable of being violent. We know for a fact that there's a bunch of crazy people and violent rhetoric among trump supporters, this attack will only increase the risk of violence.]
[>We know for a **fact** that there's a bunch of crazy people and violent rhetoric among trump supporters A fact? You think it's a fact that there is more violent rhetoric among Trump supporters?]
[You must be new to Donald Trump. "Maybe the second amendment people can do something about it".]
[Voting early thank you very much... For once I get to think this sentence: I'm so happy I'm in Florida. Stay safe everyone.]
[Michigan here. Wish I could vote early. Unless we have Early Voting and didn't know about it.]
[You can vote by absentee after my quick research. Look into it if these things scare you. Best of luck. Be safe.]
[Casting my vote on the 8th, staying home on the 9th!]
[Man, I can hardly blame you, this is legitimately frightening.]
[The Boston Globe ran a story yesterday on a Trump rally in Cincinnati where a gentleman was quoted as saying he hopes there is a coup if Hillary wins, he hopes she is either shot or jailed, and "there will be a lot of bloodshed". I understand these people are certainly outliers but this rhetoric is chillingly close to historical examples of nations in a pre-revolutionary phase. If I personally see something like this expressed on Facebook or elsewhere online, I fully intend to report it to the authorities.]
[Lol what a loser. You can't report people's thoughts and opinions.]
[Inciting violence is not protected by the first amendment, and you absolutely can report someone for threatening violent revolution against the American government, bud.]
[Someone saying on their Facebook that they hope hillary gets shot isn't inciting violence. Personally I hope she gets arrested and charged with several things, spending the rest of her life in federal prison to be raped by her fellow inmates. But hey, that's just me and it's just an opinion.]
[The statement you just made does stop short of inciting violence, so you are correct, no matter how trashy it is or how disgusting it makes you look. Saying that there should be a violent coup against the government and that you will join in – and saying that you are prepared to shed blood – is quite different.]
[You know if there is a violent coup that everyone will be joining in. Just imagine the idiots looting while the country resets. Even if you aren't taking sides you will be killing people to protect your family or life. This isn't the best way to reset the power in our nation, but a reset is needed. A new government needs to be created. The old turds in office now have been lining their pockets with tax money while allowing immoral atrocities to unfold on the people long enough. I wish there was a none violent way to flush the current government but I don't believe there is. The greed is too strong. As long as our society relies on a monetary system things will never really change. Maybe in 20 years when 85% of all jobs are automated, then we will find a way to live together and achieve a state of humanity.]
[Wow, just wow.]
[Alright man, good talk. I'm going to see myself out of this comment thread now.]
[So if the US government turns into a totalitarian one party state, you would still report people to the authorities or secret police for being revolutionaries? Inciting a violent overthrow against a corrupt despotic government is what the founding fathers of the US would have wanted.]
[You're introducing a hypothetical situation. I am talking about stuff happening in real life, right now. Thank you for the thought exercise, though.]
[Yeah, this thread is about the you know, ACTUAL VIOLENCE being perpetrated by leftists. With BLM riots, support for terrorists and now this the left is the party of violence.]
[This specific comment thread is discussing the repercussions of inciting political violence. If you'd like to discuss the topics you highlighted, there are plenty of other comments to reply to. Thanks!]
[No, try again. We're talking about something that actually happened. In reality.]
[Like I said, there's plenty of other comments discussing just that – feel free to chime in on one of those. Thanks again!]
[Anytime a Trump supporter argues with me on twitter I take a look at what they have been tweeting. About 80% of the time I will find stuff vile enough that I report it to twitter. There are some truly shocking alt-right memes being shared that have no place in modern society.]
[Just make sure to get out there on the 28th]
[35th*]
[As always Trump shows how much of a clown for a candidate he is by claiming he already knows who's guilty before authorities have barely started their investigation. This kind of talk without evidence is extremely dangerous.]
[Afiiliation aside, he has a preddt damn good record on this stuff. Not enough to convince me it isn't dumb luck yet though.]
[Yeah but it doesn't really matter, it's just irresponsible.]
[Not at all.]
[Central Park 5, and he still thinks they are guilty. Other than that, he has guessed like 4 times that they were Jihadists.]
[And CNN blamed Trump for it. But I am sure that's okay....]
[> And CNN blamed Trump for it. Good!]
[Yes, because that's real mature to do.]
[It's immature to go crazy on twitter and blurt out that "animals from Clinton's dems" are behind an attack before any proof have come out or before the proper authorities has even started to investigate it.]
[So you blame Trump for the firebomb? Yes, that will show them. And going back and down voting all my comments is real mature as well.]
[I don't blame anyone until we know who did this. Unlike Trump who have already put out blame without knowing who's behind this. His rhetoric is dangerous that's what I'm saying. Now some lunatic may try to strike back at someone voting for Clinton because they heard from Trump that those people are animals.]
[Lol. Ok. All of Reddit politics where blaming trump and His supporters for these 3 guys planning a bombing. And of course in this case all of you are saying we should take it slow and this kind of mindset is something no one agrees with. Lmao!]
[Yeah. Should have blamed it on a video. /s]
[Welcome to American fascism.]
[Well... It's clearly a politically charged attack and it isn't someone in favor of trump. Can't seem to untangle the motives.]
[> This kind of talk without evidence is extremely dangerous. And useful. It's right out of the playbook. People will fall for it.]
[Yeah that's what's bothering me. It's like they don't know about the rise of Hitler in the 30s.]
[I mean I feel pretty comfortable saying if the converse happened reddit would be shrieking a similar tune. That said Hillary wouldn't and a presidential candidate shouldn't.]
[Exactly. He could at least try to act like a presidential candidate. Now he's just making things worse.]
[Central Park 5.]
[And the latest New York/NJ bombs.]
[[deleted]]
[It's not about being right or wrong, it's irresponsible to just blurt out unconfirmed information just because he can't keep his mouth shut. He uses is to put fear in people instead of waiting for the proper authorities to make an announcement when they have all the info. Trump is in no position to do those kind of things. If anything he just makes everything worse.]
[He was right there?]
[It's not about being right or wrong, it's irresponsible to just blurt out unconfirmed information just because he can't keep his mouth shut. He uses is to put fear in people instead of waiting for the proper authorities to make an announcement when they have all the info. Trump is in no position to do those kind of things.]
[A lot of people trust neither the media nor the fbi to do proper investigations anymore]
[these same people who "don't trust the media anymore" will buy hook, line and sinker into the most biased bullshit sources like breitbart.]
[But they trust the sleaziest "car salesman" who's been lying for all his life, groping and assaulting women and ripping people off for decades. A man who exploited the financial crisis of 2008, cllaimed he donated to 9/11 charities when he didn't and can't even show his tax returns. That's good to hear...]
[Well most of his assault cases have been debunked in a matter of days.....so he's a sleeze, better that than a traitor who works with ISIS funding nations and engages in obstruction of justice regularly]
[And San Bernardino.]
[and there?]
[He lied about the bombing at the shooter's apartment]
[He also lied about this conspiracy that Muslims knew they were building bombs and didn't tell anyone. That's not verified by anyone.]
[... You should edit in Trump's response too.... It's.... Ummm Jesus fucking Christ, this man is reasonably close to being president. https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/787782613633208320]
[I like Dylan's response, a simple "fuck you."]
[I've been shooting out at least one "go fuck yourself" to trump on Twitter each day for the past week. It's been making me feel much better about all this.]
[I salute your efforts, you are a true patriot. :)]

[https://youtu.be/9Y7c69A7PgQ?t=25s]
[Surely there are more articulate ways to argue your opinion. What do personal insults add to the political discourse except trivialising what should be an important decision. Name calling on both sides is petty and unhelpful.]
[I'm here for the lolz, can't vote.]
[No matter how strong, no matter how powerful it always seems to come down to name calling.... You titwaffle]
[Yep. No one should be shocked that these are your options for president. Everyone needs to improve.]
[Does everything have to be serious though? I just liked it because it adds levity to the situation.]
[You can't exactly attack his policy, since he has none. Personal insults are the only thing his tiny hands can grasp.]
[Also, its been demonstrated many times over that petty personal insults annoy trump WAY more than attacking his nonexistent "platform".]
[Trumps tweet about it: >Animals representing Hillary Clinton and Dems in North Carolina just firebombed our office in Orange County because we are winning @NCGOP https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/787782613633208320]
[His decisiveness and desperation remind me of a couple other similar incidents: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichstag_fire http://www.bogushatecrimes.com/89_MortonDowneySwastika.php]
[What a fucking scumbag.]
[adorable deplorables]
[Fuck Trump. He's seriously going to use this to take a shot at Hillary. The man is a sociopath.]
[That man is more American than Stephen Colbert and very well may be our next president. Have you not noticed all the cheap shots Hillary has thrown at him or are you completely deaf and blind? Pretty sure one of the debate questions he confronted referenced a video clip from ten years ago. This whole race has been nonsense at a crucial time in industrial development. There's plenty of issues to be concerned with and for some reason the whole country has been bandwagoned into a mud war because it's more fun to be loud and dumb.]
[At least Trump doesn't laugh at 12 year old rape victims.]
[Lol. Your disappointment that this attack occurred against a GOP office is completely transparent. Hillary camp (read: CNN) would be making the same attack right now.]
[Devils advocate, when the rioters in Chicago attacked trump supporters most people on Reddit and the MSM justified it by saying "This is what happens when you speak hate". Also Obama used the same thing for his political advantage when his campaign offices were vandalized in 08, ironically many of which were done by Hillary supporters.]
[[deleted]]
[Yeah like those trump loonies who planned an actual terrorist attack and talked about killing babies...]
[[deleted]]
[Just trump supporter things.]
[Even so, that still doesn't mean Trump should jump to directly blaming Hillary. They aren't "representing Hillary".]
[[deleted]]
[You mean like the Trump supporters were taking accountability for the planned terrorist attack on a mosque the other day?]
[Cool, so you have proof of who is responsible for this fire-bombing? Care to share?]
[uhh, yeah dude, that's the very least he can do do you know what would have happened if a republican did this to a DNC building? it'd be a fucking shitstorm for months and people would be labeling trump the next osama bin laden]
[I very much doubt we'd see Hillary tweeting blaming her opposition before any evidence was out there.]
[she doesn't need to, the media will do it for her]
[evidence? are you fucking joking? the GOP headquarters in a heavily democrat area is firebombed with threats spraypainted on the wall and that's not enough evidence for you? do you want the perpetrators to write you a fucking notarized letter with a full incident report before turning themselves in and submitting DNA, hair, and urine samples too? it's surprising how quickly democrats turn in to knuckle-dragging morons when their own people commit terrorism, but will jump to all sorts of conclusions as soon as donald trump sneezes the wrong way]
[Nobody knows anything until law enforcement identifies the perpetrators. Speculation is meaningless at this point.]
[And the walls being spray painted with "Get Out Nazi Republicans" leads you to 0 conclusions?]
[Do we need to be lead? Certainly the detectives are more than capable of following leads.]
[Do you really think the democratic party and Hillary Clinton ordered this? That's pretty much what Trump tweeted. He's trying to incite violence. He's absolutely reckless. He should have condemned it the same way Hillary did.]
[oh, you think trump is inciting violence by pointing out that a building got fucking molotoved by left-wing terrorists?]
[Yes Trump is inciting violence by blaming his political opponent for the actions of a third party. The fact you can't see this makes this whole situation dangerous as hell. There is no way you would accept blame or responsibility for the Trump supporters that have been violent. You are so wrapped up in your personality cult that you can't see the obvious double standard you are peddling. You know your side is going to lose this election and are so desperate that you'll latch onto this narrative to put your feels over reals.]
[[removed]]
[Where did you get that that is *my* takeaway? I'm saying the *Trumps* takeaway is he can blame Hillary.]
[And I'm sure that if it were to happen to the Dem HQ we'd all be listening to her flame the Trump for it. My point being is that this shit is getting so petty that people are losing sight of the actual issues going on and instead paying attention to the shit-slinging pissing match that's quite frankly been carrying on for far too long.]
[I dunno. If anyone is a sociopath, *maaaaaaaaybe* its the person who committed an act of terrorism. You know, to put things into perspective.]
[Maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaybe people throwing around accusations of terrorism against political opponents with literally zero evidence are the real sociopaths.]
[Holy shit. You are seriously saying words on Twitter are worse than *fire bombing* people.]
[No, s/he is sayjng "riling a group of people to violence is just as bad as committing the act." He is inviting people to violence, and encouraging it. It may be "just words" but that doesn't mean he can say something with no responsibility.]
[I did not say that. I condemn fire bombing people and call for their full prosecution under the law. His political opponent is not the one responsible for fire bombing people, and I have very real concerns that his words on twitter will cause his followers to do violence upon his selected target. Anti-fascists are not the real fascists. We're just anti-fascists.]
[but there isn't "zero" evidence, there *is* evidence.]
[Evidence Hillary was involved? Liar.]
[Alright, let's hear it then. Where's the evidence that Hillary Clinton had anything to do with it?]
[If the Podesta and Guccifer leaks haven't swayed your opinion idk what will.]
[Yeah, no, a little shittalking doesn't equate to someone who will face trial for child rape and is currently under attack for sexual assault against how many women is it now?]
[I asked for evidence. Do you have any or not?]
[Likely response, which is often thrown around: "It is common knowledge, everyone knows it, the media is corrupt, and don't believe what you read online, because the truth isn't clear - Trump is."]
[If you had perpsective you'd realize Trump is an even bigger sociopath, since he only ever sees terrorism as something he can gain from - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ASRlzeLg0U]
[Hey they can both be sociopaths]
[Can't one be a sociopath and the other be a psychopath]
[Very true]
[I recall a front page article within the last couple of days that blamed Trump for a recent spike in bullying.]
[1. "Bullying" is not firebombing. 2. I'm not saying blaming Trump for things not directly in his control is the right thing either.]
[Don't forget about the recent spike in car thefts in South Korea, I hear he's behind that too]
["Why not?"]
[was it tweeted by HRC's Twitter account though?]
[No, but she did call half of his voters, millions of americans deplorable. According to leftists this is hurtful "rhetoric" that leads to violence.]
[Clinton mentioned "The Trump Effect" in the debate. Of course, we'll never know if this is her public or private position.]
[Anyone who thinks he wouldn't do [something like this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichstag_fire) is mistaken about his character.]
[That was my first thought, too. I grew up near Orange County. It's an affluent, educated, progressive place in North Carolina. Not really the type of people, generally speaking, to do something like this. And NC is a swing state that's been leaning toward Clinton lately, so the Trump campaign gets to play the victim card--an affront to democracy, look what HRC supporters did, blah, blah, blah. I'm not one for conspiracy theories, but at this point I wouldn't put anything past that fucking man-child.]
[What!?!? Ok not defending Trump at all but you mention conspiracy theories. Hillary as been implicated in a bunch of conspiracy theories so far this election: Bernie wasn't given a fair shot....proven Hillary and co. Are completely colluding with the media....proven Hillary and co knew her email situation was fucked up....proven Hillary has paid shills all over Reddit....hi by the way.....proven]
[Did you go full Stevie at the end there?]
[This]
[Until an investigation is done we don't know. Could be Trump supporters hitting back at the "establishment" or could be pissed of liberals. Who knows? I hope they catch whoever did it though.]
[Seriously, Reddit Investigations LLC needs to learn from its past mistakes.]
[But last time we did it! And we only drove one innocent to suicide!]
[Wait, was this an actual thing?]
[The NCGOP tweeted her back saying thanks. Did not expect a simple civil act to get so many upvotes. The fuck has this election done to us?]
[I don't think we'll be 100% aware of the answer to that question until we read about it in a history textbook sometime in the future. I don't know where we'll end up, but I know we're living in an era of profound change.]
[It's been a long time coming. The more money pouring into each side's taking points, the more obtuse the rhetoric becomes in refuting the other side. Supporters on both sides need to resist judging the other based on the words and actions of those on the fringe. The majority on both sides are afraid, angry, and passionate about how to make their country better. Both sides are being handed ideologies that are engineered for deadlocked arguments. That way no matter who wins, nothing changes. Half the country is not going to believe a word the president says. Our inability to compromise or even discuss important problems could very well be our downfall. The only solution is for ALL of us to put some effort into understanding the hopes and fears of the Americans supporting politicians we are against. If you think the other side are all idiots, you are not trying hard enough to understand their point of view. Anyone who gives two shits about the future of this country needs to put foolish political pride aside and listen carefully to their fellow citizens.]
[Because rarely is civillity civil for its own sake, it's politically motived, theres an angle, etc. Good she said something, but she kinda has to.]
[and that is the only civil response, jfc those tweets.]
[It really warms my heart to be reminded that not everyone in politics is extremely binary and unwelcoming.]
[Just don't read any of the other comments. Worse than YouTube...]
[[And here is the inevitable Trump tweet](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/787782613633208320).]
[I like the part where @NCGOP thanked him for a hateful accusation.]
["Animals" is right out of the Nazi playbook. Fuck the people who did this, but fuck Trump, too. He's not going to be satisfied until his supporters are committing violence.]
[You mean like Clinton supporters already are? As was demonstrated by the act of political terrorism that they did literally today?]
[>"animals" is right out of the Nazi playbook. So is "deplorable".]
[He must know who did it then. Why won't he give us the names? Why is he protecting the terrorists?!]
[Call Sean Hannity, he knows.]
[Where is the call Sean Hannity parody account when we need him most?]
[This is unreal. No evidence? Blame your opponent.]
[Considering the only 'evidence' is messages spray-painted on the building beside it referring to Republicans as "Nazis", and there is only one real competitor to the Republicans in the US, it's probably safe to assume that Democratic supporters were behind this. That is of course not saying they are representative of other Democratic supporters in any way, shape or form, but to think it is anybody but a Dem supporter is a little silly. The only other real possibility is teenagers looking to stir up shit.]
[Or a false flag by Trump supporters. Or maybe a straight up revenge attack against a 'treacherous' GOP.]
[I think right now we need to wait for the facts to come out. It's borderline impossible, I'd think, that there's no evidence whatsoever of who did this, and bluntly speaking Trump supporters are exactly the type to think "What if we false flagged an attack on Republicans! Surely that'd get his poll numbers up!" This kind of finger pointing helps no one and is exactly the kind of thing that happened with Reddit's *ingenious* work finding the boston bomber. Yes, there's a moderate chance it was some dumbfuck democrats who thought they were sending a strong message. Let it sit until any actual evidence comes out.]
[I actually think Trump has a deeper and uglier battle going with the RNC than with Hillary. Someone is following the election so closely that they are outraged enough to firebomb an office- so they attack Trump by firebombing an RNC office? I think even the casually informed have seen enough headlines in the past couple of weeks to know that there's a serious and real rift between Trump, whatever his supporters are, and Republicans.]
[And fuck it, add "because we are winning" to the end. Reality is bullshit, folks.]
[So he not only baselessly accuses the Dems but tries to invent a narrative of retaliation?]
[Given Trump's propensity to accuse Clinton of the things he is guilty of, is this an admission that he was behind the attack? /s]

[He's winning in the Charlie Sheen way.]
[The Democrats firebombed an RNC office because we're angry Trump is winning. According to Trump (play along). The RNC has abandoned Trump and Trump has declared war on the RNC. If I'm a Democrat and angry about Trump winning I should attack an RNC office. Not believable? Okay. Scrawl some random anti-Nazi shit on the wall. Clearly couldn't have been Trump supporters! They scrawled anti-Nazi stuff, Trump supporters wouldn't do that.]
[He has to keep projecting the tough guy image so he can have support for when he cries "rigged" on the 9th. And his dipshit hardcore followers are eating it up.]
[> right now He has never been ahead in the polls.]
[He was for a few days, by 1% iirc. Then the first debate happened and he has been in a spiral ever since.]
[That's the cocaine talking.]
[Not even if he was just talking about [North Carolina](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/nc/north_carolina_trump_vs_clinton_vs_johnson-5951.html).]
[Okay, by now we really shouldn't be surprised by this.]
[They don't even have a suspect in custody yet and he's blaming democrats? I want to feel bad for him but he's such a colossal asshole it's almost impossible to.]
[Eeeeh. It's not the dem party but I think it's fair to suspect progressives. There had been a fair bit of aggressive actions by radicals this cycle]
[Then again, he has been pretty constantly attacking the GOP for "betraying" him the past week and a half. He's done quite a bit to demonize the GOP, we should at least have the good sense to wait and see who did it before we start making assumptions.]
[Also animals? Wow such a hateful ass]
[> They don't even have a suspect in custody yet and he's blaming democrats Of course. And yet if the same thing happens to a Democrat HQ, he'll be first to call in to Infowars to accuse the Dems of a "false flag".]
[You do know in the John Podesta leaks the Dems thoroughly discuss false flags. In particular one where they could set up an assassination attempt of a foreign diplomat on our soil. Not a Trump fan but do yourself a favor and read through those emails.]
[Wait what's the assassination one?]
[I dunno about the one he's talking about, but they are also claiming to have found evidence that Scalia was murdered by Hillary and her team.]
[HAHAHA what the fuck sense does that make?]
[Going to need a link for that]
[Going to need a link for that]
[Yes I'm lazy and on mobile no links. it was in yesterday's dump not even gonna try and recall details but very interesting shit. I'm sorry didn't realize I was in r/politics I hate this place.........not a Trump fan but a truth, justice, and the American way fan. Hillary is a pathological liar, the American people deserve justice from the whole Clinton industry and with her the American way will be selling this country piece by piece to the highest bidder]
[I did some searching and only found infowars references to that. Have you read the actual email that mentions this?]
[I've got five bucks saying that it will turn out to be a trump supporter that took the war in GOP establishment not that sarcastically.... And trump will call that a conspiracy...]
[CNN BREAKING NEWS!! RADICAL REPUBLICANS HAVE GONE WILD! POLLS SHOW HILLARY UP 102%!!]
[Okay, this HAS to be a parody account, right? All this crazy shit we've been seeing coming from @realDonalTrump is clearly just someone screwing around. He's been hacked, right?]
[Check this one: @TheRealDenaldTrump I can seldom differentiate between the two.]
[I appreciate your wishful thinking attitude but no, and yes this is actually a serious presidential candidate.]
[No. Not a parody account, see the blue check mark. The guy really tweeted it and rest are pretty much the same. Someone set up a parody account @realdEnaldTrump and tweets similar to his so much that people keep mixing the two up. Have to check for the blue check mark (that designates verified accounts) and the E.]
[You must be new here.]
[Trump is the OG deplorable.]
[probably not, but I could totally see him never admitting that his twitter got hacked because of all the hacking statements towards Hillary he's made saying that she is a bad choice because she could be hacked.]
[Young teens paying attention to this as their first presidential election are going to be so disappointed for the rest of their lives at how boring all of the future elections are]
[First time voter here. I fucking hate both candidates so much. One is a complete idiot whose attitude will bring nothing but disaster, and then we get an incompetent untrustworthy candidate. I wish for boring elections in the future because it won't be choosing between two Devils.]
[Millennials and Gen Xers are pretty crazy so I don';t think we are going back to the old status quo.]
[Hahahah, hadn't thought about that. It's all downhill from here. No way we can top this shitshow.]
[I'm beginning to understand the ancient Persian curse: Marty you live in interesting times.]
[[When I grow up, I want to be a diplomat!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2RTWkixbes)]
[I want to be optimistic, but the rise of Trump has painted a horrible precedent that falsehoods, inane ramblings, conspiracies, and other emotional rhetoric can get you all the way to candidacy. This won't end here unless there is a blowout, but that isn't likely.]
[And will be progressively more embarrassed that they backed Trump as they get older.]
[I wouldn't count on it, the GOP may get worse before it gets better. After all, a minimally competent GOP candidate may have won this election running on Trump's same (non-existent) platform. If all it takes is an inoffensive empty suit to sell the nation on racism and misogyny, we've still got some big problems. Hell, 40% of voters will still go for Trump.]
[Youve got to be pretty optimistic to think this shit is going away anytime soon. What were seeing are the results of how we as a constituency react to the behavior of these various candidates, media organizations, political parties, etc. Why would it change? The people who are supporting people like Clinton and Trump arent going to just vanish once this election is over. Why would you think we arent going to just continue reaping what we sow?]
[Because I don't think Trump will win. If you remember from the controversy about superdelegates w/regard to Bernie, people explained that superdelegates became a thing after democrats were losing so badly in presidential elections, and they're intended to allow the party establishment to shut out a candidate their base chooses but who they (party leaders) don't think will win. I think the GOP, badly wounded by this election, will be strongly tempted to implement a superdelegate-like mechanism. If not immediately, then certainly if there's another presidential election lost by another Trump-like candidate (popular with the base, despised by the GOP establishment, and abhorrent to the voting majority). Also, I'm just nostalgic for the 2000 voting count struggle. I didn't like the outcome, but damn if the weeks of suspense weren't fun. Ever since then, election night is a disappointment.]
["47% of Americans" that's it????]
[I was walking down the street today behind some 12 year old (+/-) boys walking a dog and they were recalling point by point how stupid Trump's answers and reactions were in the last debate. I was impressed.]
[Way to go, parents.]
[You say that like Nugent/Giuliani 2020 isn't going to happen.]
[So they're going to continue putting up draft dodgers? And Giulian911i doesnt wnat VP, he wants AG. Maybe he remember back when he had a soul and thinks he'll get it back by supering his last good job.]
[I thought Romney, Jeb, and Ryan are all underneath Rancho del Cielo in a secret bunker building Reagan Hologram 2.0 for the 2020 election.]
[Hopefully]
[I'm an atheist, but Amen to that.]
[Just praise kek you weirdo <3]
[Obama 1 should be the most hype an election should get. On a good year. Anything beyond that is too much.]
[May you vote in uninteresting elections.]
[That's a... surprisingly succinct, sincere blessing.]
[It's a twist on the old curse, "May you live in interesting times."]
[May God Bless and Keep The Donald Far Away From Us.]
[Holy fuck]
[He's right. Only a savage animal would do something like this.]
[There is a better way to go about this. He's kind of making it about himself.]
[Because it almost certainly is about him... the people that firebombed the HQ did so because they hate Trump.]
[Until whoever did it is caught, speculation is easy. For example: Trump's desperate enough to have had this done himself. How many "nazi republicans get out" messages have been written on buildings so far during this election? How many fires set? The graffiti sounds like what a Trump supporter *thinks* a dem would spray... Again, it's easy to get creative.]
[> Until whomever did it is caught You mean "whoever".]
[I'm surprised they didn't write "Hillary Rules"]
[Yes, but they have nothing to do with Hillary. You would think he could quit playing politics when his own people have been bombed. Also, they did it because he's winning? It feels like he's detached from reality.]
[there was no one there when it was attacked (no one even noticed the damage until 9am this morning) so I think calling it an attack on his people is inflating it a bit. not at all trying to minimize this kind of garbage, but I don't think the perps wanted to hurt anyone physically.]
[I don't disagree with the animals part. I am shocked by the accusation that the animal(s) represent Hillary or democrats, and amused by the lie that he's winning.]
[The people that did this represent the average Clinton supporter about as much as a racist hillbilly represents the average Trump supporter. Take that as you will, and hopefully you'll see the hypocrisy.]
[Please tell me more about the average Trump supporter and the average Clinton supporter. Cite your sources.]
[Clinton does not have an army of firebombing terrorists. Neither does trump.]
[As a person from a racist hick town that mostly sports Trump, I think it's fair to say that Trump has a lot more racist hicks than Clinton has terrorist bombers.]
[That is such an incredible false equivalency wow.]
[It's a true equivalency.]
[Supporters on both sides say stupid things, but the candidates themselves should be better than that.]
[Both sides say stupid things, but yet only one side incites the majority of the violence.]
[I'd really like to see the DNC make a donation to that office. That would be a great thing for our country to see. Edit: I'll be damned. http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/301270-dems-launch-campaign-to-raise-money-for-firebombed-gop-office]
[Remember when John McCain took out an ad to congratulate Obama on his historic nomination? We have fallen so far in just 8 years, people are literally chanting to jail political opponents now. Civility like this is a good step back from the abyss, and I'm glad to see there's people on both sides still capable of it. (McCain's ad: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4KIvRTg6KQ)]
[I think people generally underestimate how much, for lack of a better term "professional" Democrats and Republicans tend to have some basic level of respect for eachother. No one really gets involved in Dem/GOP politics if they don't have something else motivating them, its still a job, and people who are in same type of job are going to understand eachother, and have a lot of sympathies for what they go through.]
[That would indeed be a breath of fresh air.]
[In any other election I would agree unfortunately in this one the folks in /r/the_d would without a doubt claim that is proof that dems did it and are now paying to cover it up]
[Doesn't matter what they think, it will still help the people over there and the office to rebuild after something so horrible.]
[This was my first thought as well.]
[My first post was deleted because of the link, but there is a fundraising effort going on. It's on gofundme as 'Dems help reopen a NC Repub office.']
[Just saw that. Very good stuff!]
[Agreed. Screw the political ramifications. In this election everyone is pushed to the edge, and it'd be great to see someone reach across the aisle to say something like "hey, we'll help you stand back up again."]
[Problem is, whenever the Dems try to act like adults, the Reps act like children and fuck them over. Somehow this will turn into "Dems feel guilty about firebombing Rep office, raise money to rebuild what they destroyed." Locally the NCGOP might not be like that, but it's probably already being represented like this by the alt-right goon squad.]
[I WANT the diehards to stay the fuck seated! What those deplorables want i DON'T The US put for less of a reason the Japanese in interment camps, why not homegrown terrorists?]
[> Agreed. Screw the political ramifications. The optics on that would be downright blinding. You come across looking like a bipartisan rock star. Trump uses it as further evidence of Dem-Repub collusion and just digs himself in deeper.]
[The political ramifications would likely be very positive for them.]
[Like the type of positive ramifications the GOP would expect from blaming dems for firebombing an office before any facts or evidence are available?]
[That's what's up]
[Saying "screw the political ramifications" would also be a positive thing for them as well. But it's nice that the right thing to do and good politics aren't at odds.]
[Not like they're gonna lose anyway.]
[I feel running up the score is important this time. Usually a win is a win, but I want to send a message.]
[In the context of the news story we are posting about....phrasing?]
[Good point.]
[That's cool of them to acknowledge the support.]
[Civility in in our political discourse? GTFO!]
[Don't worry Trump's got your back https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/787782613633208320]
[> Civility? Not if I have anything to do with it!]
[Trump later today: "AND THE CORRUPT GOP, FOLK, YOU KNOW HOW CORRUPT THEY ARE... TODAY THE NC GOP OFFICE WAS ATTACKED, AND THE GOP THANKED HILLARY!! WE CAN NOT LET THIS HAPPEN FOLKS." Probably.]
[Ok buddy. This attack probably happened because th left has spent the last 3 months dehumanizing and dismissing Trump and his supporters. Glad to see you are upholding that great tradition.]
[Trump and his supporters dehumanized themselves. What kind of a person continues to defend a braggart rapist? What kind of man? What kind of an American patriot demeans themselves to such disgusting low levels? ...they are deserving every bit of hate that is being sent their way. This country has been more than tolerable of their huge moutains of shit. People have finally had enough.]
[I normally avoid political talk, but you seriously sound like Joseph goebells. Substitute "Jews" for "trump supporters" and your rant is textbook nazi fear-mongering. You need to take a step back and relax and re-think the things you say and promote.]
[He began by raising a fair point, though- what kind of person *does* support Trump? After him mocking those with disabilities and bragging about sexual assault,) the ethics of a man who supports a person like Trump is seemingly fleeting.]
[and there goes the civility]
[Dial it back a notch.]
[You say that like it's a joke, but Chris Christie took shit in the primary debates for thanking Obama for Sandy aid.]
[https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/787782613633208320 terrifying]
[I know this is an unpopular opinion itt, but imo his response makes it seem more likely to be some kind of false flag situation where he is actually responsible. He is now losing support rapidly because of the assault allegations, and based on his very real history of behavior, he lashes out when slighted/not winning. He's planting the notion of a rigged election in the minds of his supporters. He incites violence in his supporters virtually every time he speaks. He has said he would pay for the legal bills for those who use violence against his opponents, i.e., the media, Clinton herself post election, her supporters, anyone that disagrees with him/does not support him (whether or not he would actually follow through is irrelevant, because his supporters believe whatever he says). If he truly wants his supporters to commit acts of violence in his name, which is what he, himself, has said out loud, then making them feel as though they have been physically attacked would be all it would take to bring his supporters to violently retaliate. "Look, they attacked us first! They called us Nazis so it had to be them! Go get your guns!" I know it's an outlandish speculation, or at least it would be outlandish if it were about anyone other than Trump. I guess I'm just saying I wouldn't be surprised, at all, if that's what turns out to be the case. Edit: words]
[WTF? "Animals" is right out of the Nazi playbook. Fuck the people who firebombed the GOP headquarters, but fuck Trump, too.]
[The fucked up thing is that he's stating that as a fact when he has no way of knowing or proving what actually happened. Is anyone planning on stopping him from dumping gas on this fire anytime soon???]
[He already blamed her for it on twitter]
[She did label most of his base as "deplorable" and "irredeemable". How do you expect her supporters to act when she's put that in their heads? E.. Weird how I received three responses that were basically worded the same. Thank you for correcting the record.]
[She said mean words. We shouldn't have people say mean words. Then people won't react to those mean words. Hillary should be more PC.]
[No... She just said what we were all thinking. Trump supporters have proved themselves to be irredeemably deplorable. The real question is how did you expect America to react when you nominated the most sexist, racist, homophobic piece of shit candiate in the history of this country?]
[You need to turn off your TV, it's making you sound hysterical.]
[Yeah, i'm pretty fucking pissed off at this point. This guy is a serial sexual assaulter and he is attacking our democracy. Fuck this guy and anyone who still supports him.]
[Hillary says mean words about certain groups -> responsible for all violence and hate towards them. Trump says mean words about certain groups -> hero of free speech, not responsible for violence or hate towards them. Makes sense famalam.]
[We've had presidential candidates who owned slaves and genuinely believed black people were inferior to white people. Trump is not even close to the most racist, sexist, candidate in US history. Settle down, revisionist.]
[> We've had presidential candidates who owned slaves and genuinely believed black people were inferior to white people. Trump is not even close to the most racist, sexist, candidate in US history. Settle down, revisionist. This is the absolutely worst defense of Trump I have seen yet... "WELL HE IS NOT AS RACIST AS THE SLAVE OWNING FOUNDERS OF THIS COUNTRY!" yikes dude.]
[>genuinely believed black people were inferior to white people. I'm not convinced we can rule this out for Mr. Trump]
[It was probably Hilary supporters pretending to be Trump supporters executing a a false flag operation to make it look like Hilary supporters bombed a GOP office but make it super obvious it was the phony Trump Supporters. /s]
[Some Muslim kid was bullied vaguely... "Trump's campaign has created a problematic environment and is to blame" Gop HQ is firebombed by liberal protesters... "Hillary has nothing to do with it!!!"]
[Where?]
[What a fucking prick. I am honestly to the point of calling for his arrest.]
[He blamed Hillary supporters. Don't let yourself be disinformationed.]
[Better solution - go firebomb him. I mean, if he already deserves arrest for not agreeing with you, certainly he deserves death, no?]
[> if he already deserves arrest for not agreeing with you, Strawman. He deserves arrest for inciting violence and attacking the stability of our democracy.]
[You're an idiot.]
[Kek]
[You're just NOW getting to that point?! Welcome to the party pal! Yer late!]
[Oh thank god. Do it already.]
[Wow someone says something you disagree with and you want them arrested how fucking tolerant of you]
[Says the hilary voter. Actual evidence of felonies are already out and you want him arrested?]
[lol I can see how tolerant you are. So basically because you disagree with him politically you would like to throw him in jail? How un-American of you.]
[He may make 2017, but won't make 2018 as a free man.]
[For what]
[Isn't he on trial for sexual misconduct soon anyway?]
[Not sexual misconduct, raping a 13 year old. Obviously he hasn't been to trial, hasn't been proven guilty, but there are a good number of witnesses for this one.]
[actually there are no witnesses. this case has bounced around for several years , been dismissed a couple of times , and the plaintiff has had several lawyers who have quit. Now she has an attorney who normally specializes in tax work representing her. No surprise he is a Clinton contributor. If you delve into the history of the case, it sounds like a phony . Maybe a better way to put is that it sounds Trumped Up.]
[His followers are buying into it, too. The first article about this to get fronpaged was blaming the left and there are literally no facts or proof connecting anyone yet. Funny how this is the one time they wouldnt buy some sort of false flag conspiracy theorist bullshit about an attack of this nature.]
[You don't need to call for it, just wait for the various charity and finance investigations to shake out.]
[Yeah, he doesn't have Hilary type backing to get out of it, he will definitely be jailed.]
[Yeah, just a shame the FBI has been paid off to not look into the Clinton Foundation]
[A single, unnamed source formerly associated with the FBI tangentially has also assured me that, in addition to the hundreds of agents chomping at the bit to properly arrest Clinton, there are dozens of leprechaun attacks that the lamestream media covers up each year.]
[Should have asked Hilary for the same immunity she seems to have]
[You mean like what has happened with the FBI and DOJ on Clinton classified stuff> Surely you jest ..Intellectually honest people and solid critical thinkers know better already.]
[You mean like the ones they should be doing on the Clinton charity? Right? Right.]
[Don't forget his sexual assault of a 13 year old girl. ...And his NAMBLA donations]
[Yeah, take that Dave Fahrenthold!]
[No I am talking about like immediately. He is inciting violence, he is attacking our democracy... Enough. Lock this tax evading sexual assaulting prick up.]
[He avoided taxes legally and what actual proof is there that he sexually assaulted anyone?]
[>attacking our democracy How?]
[The cops will never do it, we need to take matters into our own hands. We should firebomb...oh wait.]
[The media sure has made you an informed individual.]
[The tolerant left everyone.]
[1 month old account posts only in /r/politics about how Trump is bad and Hillary is good. Topkeks. edit: In the past 3 hours you've mentioned Trump over 30 times, you're a little obsessed, or maybe you're just doing your job.]
[How do you type and clutch your pearls at the same time?]
[[removed]]
[Supposedly it's going to happen this week, since the deadline the AG gave for turning in years worth of independent audits is the 17-18th. Even if Trump is elected president at this point, the self-dealing charity fraud gives Congress grounds for impeachment. The 2016 presidential election was over when Dave Farenthold dropped the bomb on the Trumps.]
[Oh good, he can join Chris Christy in jail. oh, wait...]
[He has to go on and burn the whole world down in an attempt to save face though...]
[God damn that'll be a great day for america.]
[Well, at least he's consistent.]
[I think he has the consistency of diarrhea. Mostly hot air, shit soup, and the occasional kernal of wisdom that magically made it through the entire Trump tract intact. Of course, he'd just as soon peck at it and gobble it back down to make sure it comes out as definitively *his*.]
[I'm voting Trump over Hillary but fuck me that's hilarious]
[Who'd have thought twitter would be a major player in the US election? Trump does his best hole digging on twitter, maybe I shouldn't have deleted my account.]
[I deleted my account a few years ago but I check Trump's twitter almost daily to see his unhinged tweets. Great insight into his character.]
[You think that's great, you should check out Wikileaks to see Hillary and her offices' character. There is far better stuff there.]
[I can't, I tried to Google it and the mainstream media broke down my door and turned my monitor around.]
[To quote Mr. Wolf in Pulp Fiction, just because he *is* a character doesn't mean he *has* character.]
[If the same thing happened to a democrat office, he'd immediately be launching into "FALSE FLAG!!" tweetstorms between snorts.]
[But the same thing doesn't happen to democrat offices, and the only way it ever would is if it *were* a false flag. At least in the current political climate. Republicans just aren't the violent ones this year. Also, DAE Trump breathes loud?]
[If Trump did coke you'd be able to tell believe me, it would be tremendous. Also, everyone knows the people who are out to stop Trump are the same elites that control the coke supply and they could get him very easily that way if they wanted to.]
[lol]
[My first thought. If this happened to a dem office and no one got hurt in an area where the right was prevailing, theyd say that weak shit is enough to PROVE this was a false flag attack. Instead they are casting blame before any facts or evidence are available.]
[And the democrats would be saying the same thing. How is this unique to Trump?]
[Well that's demonstrably false. It happened and no one is saying it's a false flag.]
[I mean....are you reading this thread?]
[Oh so true]
[I just wish we could step back from the circus that 2016 is and just acknowledge what a violent rape of decorum this is from the Republican nominee. ...OK, now back to our regular programming: "Which candidate is on drugs??"...]
[An argument can be made that is not dissimilar the one made in the Planned Parenthood shooting case: the architect of the continuous stream of messages of a group being dangerous, unacceptable, intolerable, deplorable, and harmful in their very existence bears tacit responsibility in the result of such attacks happening.]
[Political terrorism must be rooted out of every movement thoroughly. Edit: specifically by the people involved in movements themselves denouncing and discouraging any talk that supports violence in the name of their cause]
[ITT: People freaking out about vandalism and calling it "terrorism". Look up the definition of terrorism, why don't you? It was the Trump supporters who were planning on bombing Somali immigrants and killing their babies who were terrorists.]
[Not a lawyer but I feel like firebombing the building goes past vandalism charges.]
[Well, it was empty, on a Sunday in a state that shuts down on Sundays. Apparently, no personal harm was intended. That's vandalism, AFAIK, at least for insurance law purposes: > The online version of Merriam-Webster’s says that “vandalism” is the “willful or malicious destruction or defacement of public or private property.” They conclude therefore that “arson” is a subset of the more generic term “vandalism” and that the exclusion should be enforced. This argument was favorably received in the cases of Battishill v. Farmers Alliance Ins. Co., 139 N.M. 24, 127 P.3d 1111, 1115 (2006) and Bear River Mut. Ins. Co. v. Williams, 2006 Utah App. 500, 153 P.3d 799 (2006).]
[No, sorry, at best this is arson. Why are you so desperate to downplay it?]
[Because of all the hyperbolic idiots trying to call this "terrorism" when it obviously is not.]
[I'm certain it fits the standard for vandalism. I'm guessing it'll qualify for another more serious charge as well but again, not a lawyer.]
[You don't have to be a lawyer to recognize that only a complete pile of shit would do something like that or defend it]
[By FORCE, if necessary! DEATH TO ALL FANATICS!!!!!]
[You really can't "root out" terrorism though. Terrorism is a natural response to given conditions, or the perception of certain conditions - and sometimes is just the work of the insane. Every political group has some extremist who thinks violence is justified - the rational to commit violence of this sort is a combination of desperation, urgency, and commitment.]
[I think it's clear that no Republicans firebombed the Republican headquarters. Let's not pretend it isn't obvious the Republican opposition did this. They even spraypainted "Nazi Republicans get out of town or else" on the side of the building next door.]
[So you mean trump supporters?]
[Not all Trump supporters are a fan of the Republican party lately.]
[In any other sub I'd know this was sarcasm, but here I just can't be sure]
[You don't know if this was a Democrat, a Republican who is unhappy with his own party, or a false flag. All you can do is guess until there is evidence. So who is the one pretending?]
[Haha, that isn't in any way clear. Just like that stupid girl who claimed she was assaulted by Obama supporters.]
[Let's wait for the "backward B" to come out in this story.]
[[removed]]
[First off, let me preface what I'm doing to say with this: I am not making a value judgment on this act of violence. Why must political terrorism be rooted out? I think there are a fair number of examples of successful, violent action which have led to the creation of a more just society. On the surface, pacifism seems to be moral and just -- but is it really? I like to use this example. If you're a black man stopped by the cops and a cop is suffocating you (particularly in a situation where the force being applied to you isn't warranted), does this situation not warrant the use of force on your part? It's an act of self-preservation. Let's then take the phrase "I can't breathe." which has become increasingly important to the struggle for African-American justice in our society. If a group of people collectively cannot breathe due to violence and systematic oppression, does they not withhold the right to fight back? People often like to think that the Civil Rights Movement was entirely peaceful. As nice as this would be, it wasn't entirely peaceful. What we can instead observe is that there was a collective strive towards non-violent resistance. We should take note of what is known as the Long Hot Summer of 1967. The year immediately preceding the assassination of non-violent activist MLK Jr. was riddled with riots. I argue that MLK Jr.'s non-violent served as a facet of the ultimate struggle towards equality for African-Americans in the United States. On the other hand, while these riots weren't necessarily pre-organized for political purposes, you still have groups of people rioting, looting, and using violence against white people / the government / arms of the government (police forces, etc.) Without this fear of violence, do you really think the movement would've accomplished as much as it did? What I'm getting at is that non-violence should be an ideal to strive towards. I believe that non-violence is **usually** the answer to problems. But the state has a monopoly on violence. This said, sometimes force will be necessary to create a more just society. Again, this argument holds no justification for this act of violence / terror. I'm just saying that the categorical rejection of violence as a justified, effective means to political progress is quite silly. If we truly believed in non-violent action, we'd readily rid our country of weapons and power structures which serve in part to maintain a cohesive nation and world. Violence isn't usually the answer, but sometimes it is.]
[Its called domestic terrorism]
[I just want to vent here, a few weeks ago a friend of mine who was a fellow Bernie delegate to the dnc shared that video of a guy holding an "all lives matter" sign in a "predominantly black neighborhood" getting chased and having his sign ripped out and threatened. We all knew it was a staged video but she was sharing it as if she was praising the people who were assaulting the guy holding the sign. I got called rascist, apologist, privileged and told that I don't have any right to "criticize black people for how they fight their oppression" for saying that its not right to do what they did and no matter how much i might hate "all lives (or blue lives) matter" movement and disagree with them, they have a right to hold whatever sign they want and not be physically assaulted. My friend responded by saying that an "all lives matter" sign is literally violence being done to any black people that read it so they're justified in physically "fighting back". I just quit trying to be reasonable with them when that came out. I was being told all of this, btw, about not being "minority enough" as a brown skinned, very Arabic looking Latino immigrant with black grandparents. Sometimes I can see why people hate "liberals" like that.]
[In every occurrence. Extremely dangerous for this to become acceptable]
[Especially since our country has a long history of it and people have died because of it. It has zero place in our society and should never be condoned or supported. What really matters is we continue in our given freedom of voting as we like for who we like without violence or force.]
[I believe terrorism is political by definition.]
[Not at all. Religion?]
[Terrorism is defined, by experts in the field and those who study it, as violence against civilians with a political goal/motive. If it isn't political, it isn't terrorism. Edit: guys, words have meaning. It might feel good to label every idiot who throws a bomb in a dumpster or shoots up a school a terrorist, but then you can define anyone who commits seemingly random violence a terrorist, which they are not. There is an entire field of people who study terrorism, and terrorism specifically refers to politically motivated violence against civilians.]
["Experts" being who exactly?]
[People who study terrorism. I'm in a Theory & Politics of Terrorism course right now. Look up the definition of terroism, or google "what is terrorism?". It's a simple definition used and defined by those in the field.]
[You're taking criminology, don't feed me that shit dude. Terrorism is more complex than one side course]
[It's extremely complex. It also has a pretty simple definition. If a mentally unstable person decides to shoot up a school, is that terrorism? No. If someone shoots up a black church to start a race war? Yes.]
[The bombings of the Boston Marathon were terrorist attacks, but it wasn't done to start anything]
[This is highly disingenuous. There is no agreed upon definition of terrorism and scholars have spent huge amounts of time arguing about what the definition should be.]
[More like every country and institution wants to have it's own (so they can label groups as terrorist when they need to), and good luck trying to make USA (for example) accept other definition but their own.]
[Terrorism is studied in the context of social sciences, so there will naturally be debate over the definitions of qualitative words and themes. Having said that, I'm yet to come across a major contributor to the field or an organization/agency that deals with terrorism that defines it outside the general "violence against civilians for political reasons" definition. That's why Adam Lanza wasn't a terrorist, just an asshole with a gun, but Dylan Roof certainly was.]
[Politics of religion. ISIS wants to form their own country, so, pretty political.]
[Did you just infer all terrorism comes from ISIL?]
[vandalism != terrorism.]
[Mm, I think he's differentiating politically motivated terrorism from religiously motivated terrorism, etc. Just wording.]
[Well; it is political, until you mix your politics with religion. And worse: when your religious code encourages believers to suicide via bogus promise of salvation.]
[I think it's worth stating because this is an attack on an actual political party, not just on "western ideals" or whatever.]
[Terrorism is a war tactic, and war is politics by other means. Source: I don't remember who said it but I have a degree in INR.]
[This is def on the more directly political range of terrorism. The Dallas police shooting while "political" also more on the terror side of terrorism. Bottom line violence should not be tolerated.]
[What about religious terrorism?]
[Islamist terrorism was motivated in part by US support of Israel.]
[Everything is political, if you wish to see it that way.]
[No I mean terrorism is violence meant to achieve a political aim.]
[eh, if were defining things then no. Terrorism is violence meant to spread terror. The goal of that terror can be used to for political gain, but its not necessarily so. Especially when you consider the reverse of your definition. All wars are violence meant to achieve a political aim, however not all wars are terrorism. So, logically, terrorism is not merely violence for a political gain]
[...Or that's the literal definition of terrorism. "the use of violence and intimidation in the pursuit of political aims."]
[No, he's right. Terrorism is defined as a politically motivated act by even the FBI. It's what separates serial killings from terrorism, for example.]
[maybe, but is this really the time and situation for being pedantic?]
[Nah,its idealism. You can have political ideals or religious ideals or whatever. Everyone holds these in one way shape or form, the problem is when they become extreme.]
[It is literally that by definition. But of course many people will disagree with you because their understanding of the word has become redefined by Jihad and the events that they only most recently recall. That representation has been so drilled into their heads by 24-hour news cycles since 9-11 that they envision a Muslim when they hear the word.]
[However, jihad are political as well, people must have a complete misunderstanding of the word.]
[It doesn't help that most recent acts of terrorism have been perpotrated by Muslims. Can't blame it all on 9/11 man]
[The definition they beat into us in boot camp provided three (though not prohibited from overlapping) classes: religious, political, or ideological.]
[True enough, Islamic terrorism is but one flavor of terrorism.]
[And at the moment we're in a fucking baskin Robbins with 31 different flavors of terrorism. Like baskin Robbins though, everyone has a favorite flavor which is why you only hear about radical Islamist terrorism. Just find it funny that people don't consider that white kid who killed 8 black parishioners in that church in Carolina terrorism. That was white nationalistic terrorism, and not a single politician is willing to use that term]
[Easy there, tiger]
[The only reason Islamic terrorism wouldn't be considered political is because Islam is no longer considered politics. Politics includes every public human action and reasoning. But we don't give that credence to Islamic attacks anymore. It's considered evil, subhuman. But terrorism isn't subhuman, it's very very human, it comes from everywhere, every movement, from firebombing Republican HQs to shooting Planned Parenthoods to even Orlando. (the attacker was a native born American citizen, regardless of his religion, and isn't it interesting it took someone born here to attack our very visible LGBT communities?) None of these movements are delegitimized by attacks. It's sad how when our current candidates for President talk about preventing terrorism in the debates that they both specifically brought up that Muslim communities need to cooperate with us to find attackers. People don't say that about any of these other attacks. People don't say "keep an eye out for potential serial killers". We've drawn a very limiting box where it doesn't seem to belong. Edit: a clearer point: I don't mean to fearmonger. I actually mean that if we're okay with using one tactic against one group of people, but not the rest, it wasn't okay to use that tactic anyway. I want to roll back the surveillance state, and find humane and respectful ways to talk about these attacks with all the communities involved, and what we can do about them. These are Americans, not just some faraway group of beheading idiots. So we need to talk about mental health resources. We need to talk about humanizing each other, instead of letting people get pushed to polarizing extremes that they can't understand even the fundamentals of each other's reasoning anymore. Maybe we even need to talk about gun control. I don't like that myself, but it needs to be in the conversation.]
[>People don't say that about any of these other attacks. If you see anything suspicious you're told to call 9-11 for any kind of emergency, but the reason Muslim communities are asked to cooperate specifically its because ideologically these attacks stem from the belief system that call for the execution of gays, etc; despite how nice or peaceful Muslims are or how good of people they are by ignoring or "reinterpreting" the written word of the religion. I wouldn't ask a Muslim to look out for a Christianity-motivated attacker, why is it unreasonably limiting to ask people of the same community to watch their neighborhoods for anything suspicious? >People don't say "keep an eye out for potential serial killers". We've drawn a very limiting box where it doesn't seem to belong. I'm not sure what you mean by this. As you said, people already look out for suspicious stuff. What would you expect the officers investigating a homicide to say on the press release? "Call this number if you know anything about the current thing you're investigating, but just remember to call this number if you know anything about any murder ever, just in case you didn't think to call us or 9-11 already" >Maybe we even need to talk about gun control. I don't like that myself, but it needs to be in the conversation. Unrelated, but it DOES need to be in the discussion, just not in the way many people want to talk about it: (triggering (lol) opinion warning) Gun free zones DON'T WORK. I'm of the opinion that our schools need trained, armed professionals protecting them. At the bare minimum let school teachers get free training in the use of firearms if they want it, and let them conceal-carry if they've earned their license. But that's my opinion. Also we should enforce the laws we already have then lets talk about maybe implementing new ones in the future if the ones we have aren't sufficient. (Excluding gun show loophole cause that shit's dumb)]
[> these attacks stem from the belief system that call for the execution of gays, etc; Defintely. The problem is the hateful verses in the Quran that say things like this: >If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them. Oh, wait...]
[My point is, that wasn't in the debates. Do we really tell Christians to look out for radicalism? What about bog standard Republicans? "If that guy with a freaking arsenal says anything like 'I'd totally shoot Obama if I had the chance' let us know." Nah, we barely even care if they spout that shit on the radio for all to hear. So what's different about Muslim communities that they need to be specifically called out? That's my question. You say: > ideologically these attacks stem from the belief system that calls for the execution of gays And isn't it a shame that Christian bankers [still charge interest,](http://bible.oremus.org/?passage=exodus+22:25-22:27&version=nrsv) and that [Hobby Lobby doesn't send their workers home with their pay for each day.](http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-15.htm) Fundamentalists are fundamentalists. Rigidly following any philosophy without accounting for reality and humanity is bad. But hey, I'm *actually* a gay guy here, you know? And I'm not going on the warpath against all these religions that say I should die. I don't give a fuck. Worship whatever sky fairy, ancient undying flame, noodly Cthuluoid, or five tons of flax you like. Now, people actually killing gay people, sure, that's more concerning. But also significantly more limited. Don't fool yourself into thinking Islam has a monopoly on homophobes, either. About "enforcing the laws that we already have." I find thinking of government like biology helps here. DNA has all the explicit coding for everything the cell needs to make, every last protein. But due to a complicated and not yet fully understood system called "epigenetics", the literal transcription of DNA will not give you a working cell. You've got to take the whole context, all the little molecules that attach to the DNA and make parts easier or harder to read and make proteins out of. And I think of government that way. Past a certain point, it doesn't matter what laws are on the books. It matters what is actually allowed. When I talk about increasing gun control, I'm not pointing at laws, I'm pointing at the reality of the situation and saying, hey, this isn't working. I don't know what the fuck you guys are writing up in Congress, but what's out here, no, this isn't cool. And so I think before we try to pass laws, we need to take inventory. We need to make real efforts to measure and understand our reality. *But* guess what. Due to NRA machinations, the government is literally forbidden from spending money to do this. I guess the NRA figures if they tie a blindfold over the government's eyes, it won't be able to move effectively. The NRA just wants to freeze everything and leave it as it is. :/ so, *that's* what I mean by conversation. Government studies and academic work are important pieces of a conversation, an actual conversation. If it bears out you're right, I'll be a little relieved, to be honest. I hate restricting liberties like that. But let's take off the blindfold and see first.]
[Have you by any chance seen [this](https://youtu.be/MCI4bUk4vuM) Daily Show segment? I know, I know... The Daily Show have their agenda, but I think some good points are made here amongst the comedy. Even most people with firearm training aren't even remotely equipped with the skills to handle an active shooter situation without potentially exacerbating the problem or simply getting themselves killed.]
[I'd rather have a gun and have a slight chance rather than be slaughtered like a animal with no defense.]
[It's a fair point but even the guy he's interviewing says "it's complex" Outright banning the whole concept because some idiot is being an idiot (I get he was trying to be funny but it was kinda cringey), while well intentioned, exacerbates the problem as well doesn't it? I don't agree with just tossing guns around like Halloween candy, but I don't agree with imposing unreasonably harsh restrictions either. There's a happy middle ground somewhere and I sincerely disagree with the idea that gun-free zones as being in that middle ground.]
[> Islam is no longer considered politics. But Islam is a fundamentally political religion. The Koran is in part a manual for governance and demands theocracy.]
[I disagree. It's not honest to say that the Qur'an is a "manual for governance" and certainly not that it "demands theocracy." The Qu'ran has very little to say about political structure and nowhere does it stipulate that an Islamic government must be theocratic. In fact, some contend that the Qur'an's endorsement of 'shra' (literally 'consultation') is inherently anti-theocratic.]
[This is too often unknown to people.]
[Religion is inherently political.]
[People seem to forget that legally, the Pope is an elected monarch, and for many years, ruled his own kingdom, leading his own armies to war, while simultaneously jockeying for even greater influence over other kingdoms, decreeing that all Catholics were his subjects. People forget that just sixty years ago the bishop was supposed to ritually slap people for their coming of age, to remind them the world isn't kind, and they need to be soldiers for God. Christianity isn't pretty, and has caused its own wars, torture, and genocide, and even in more modern times has been used to justify hate and a thousand other crimes. Meanwhile, sixty years ago, Muslims laughed at the idea of a new caliphate, at the thought of a modern Islamic nation enforcing the covering up of women and dis-equalizing the sexes again. [There's video of it.](http://youtu.be/TX4RK8bj2W0) Islam is not bound to its fundamentals, any more than Christianity is. I am an atheist myself, but if you're going on a warpath against all religion, I'll be standing in the way of the tanks. People deserve this freedom.]
[>Meanwhile, sixty years ago, Muslims laughed at the idea of a new caliphate, at the thought of a modern Islamic nation enforcing the covering up of women and dis-equalizing the sexes again. [There's video of it.](http://youtu.be/TX4RK8bj2W0) This is such a good point. I think we get so focused the fact that Palestinians & Israelis have been fighting for so long that we often forget how radically attitudes can change within a religious community in a comparatively miniscule amount of time.]
[I used to associate the term with the IRA. at least those guys would threaten you before they blew ya up. ahh those were the good ol' days, when terrorism was a gentleman's business. Now its all jihad this, hearts and minds that, the GOP sucks. What happened to us. we should be ashamed.]
[>What happened to us. The media, Hollywood, and academia has portrayed the Right as literal monsters. People at Trump rallies get brutally beaten and their attackers are not brought to justice. People have been taught that there are "no bad tactics, only bad targets." What happened to us? Fascism came to America, wrapped in a tie-dye shirt and waving a peace sign.]
[I dont think you know what fascism is]
[That damn academia with their books and knowledge and learning! What's next? Shitting on a doctor for trying to cure someone?]
[>The media, Most popular political media is Fox News, a right wing media channel. Most popular political talk is dominated by right wing hosts >Hollywood, Most popular movies shy away from politics out of hand. The most blatant political wrangling I've seen in popular Hollywood movie was probably Ironman 2, which had a page ripped right out of Atlas Shrugged. >and academia has portrayed the Right as literal monsters. I'm sorry that history, education, and reality have liberal bends to them. >People at Trump rallies get brutally beaten and their attackers are not brought to justice. We'll just ignore its usually Trump people attacking Trump protesters. >People have been taught that there are "no bad tactics, only bad targets." Huh? >What happened to us? >Fascism came to America, wrapped in a tie-dye shirt and waving a peace sign. Says the guy who supports a man who has literally campaigned in fascism and fascist policies. I mean, literally.]
[>Fox News Wew lad, starting this out with blaming Fox News. Surely the rest of this reply will be fair and balanced. >Hollywood is conservative! Is your goal to make statements so absurd your opponents are stunned into silence? Are you unaware of the fund raisers movie stars had for the current president and are holding for Clinton? >Reality has a liberal bias! Are you literally spouting cliches on purpose? >Trump attackers are attacking themselves! Welp, you just took victim blaming to a whole new level. >Trump is a fascist! I don't need proof, just Listen and Believe! This is what the Left *actually believes*, folks.]
[> Trump attackers are attacking themselves! While this sentence does make no sense whatsoever (Trump attackers is not a meaningful composition of words), I'm going to a assume what you meant to quote was "Trump supporters are attacking themselves" which is a misrepresentation of the argument of your conversation partner. What he said and clearly meant to say was that the attacks at Trump rallies are actually attacks BY trump supporters. And the people they are attacking are the people protesting the Trump rallies. Regardless of whether that's true or not, this is the argument you should be arguing against. Your entire post is composed of logical fallacies and does not provide any actual counter-arguments against what was written in the post you replied to, save for maybe the "financing Hollywood" part (even though that isn't a flawless argument either). You're simply dismissing everything that was said while not providing any reasoning. Regardless of who's right or wrong in this conversation, you're not making yourself look very good, argumentatively. Just try to answer to the actual arguments next time.]
[I don't think you know how to use the quote function]
[> ...actually believes, folks. you have spent too much time on the trump subreddit. nearly every post uses the word "folks"]
[Its a rather common way of speaking. I don't know if it can be argued Trump voters have a monopoly on it.]
[>Wew lad, starting this out with blaming Fox News. Blame? No. Pointing out the whole "media is liberal!!!!!" cries make no sense when the largest news/political news outlets on the primary media outlets (radio and television) are conservative leaning. This whole idea that the media is out to get conservatives plays nicely with y'all's victim complex, but it's not reality. >Is your goal to make statements so absurd your opponents are stunned into silence? Can't even quote me so you can set-up a strawman argument? Cute. I didn't say Hollywood was conservative. I said the majority of Hollywood output is apolitical. Plenty of "Hoo-rah! AMERICA! FUCK YEAH!" movies come out of it, and that most popular movies are firmly apolitical. >Are you unaware of the fund raisers movie stars had for the current president and are holding for Clinton? Do a lot of actors and actresses lean liberal? Sure. But I guess when you use a completely undefined enemy in "Hollywood", it's easy to claim whatever you want. >Are you literally spouting cliches on purpose? Are you unable to actually provide proof otherwise? Hell, are you able to support your claim that academia as a whole is anti-conservative? >Trump attackers are attacking themselves! >Welp, you just took victim blaming to a whole new level. You should probably learn to read. I said "Trump **supporters** attacking Trump **protesters**. >This is what the Left actually believes, folks. Because he actually is? Read up on fascism. Compare to Trump. It's pretty scary how identical it is.]
[The political right has been portrayed as literal monsters? Can you cite some examples?]

[The basket of deplorables was not meant to describe all of Trumps followers. Nor was it meant to dehumanize them. Breitbart is hardly a reputable "news site".]
[Yeah... no. Have fun painting yourself as a victim though.]
[The sociopathy and lack of empathy of the Left is stunning to behold.]
[A few angry people afraid of white supremacists and alt-right extremist have attacked some Trump supporters, yes. However, to claim that "the Left" as a whole has "sociopathy and lack of empathy" is ridiculous. The leaders of "the left" [e.g. Bernie Sanders] condemn violence and preach empathy, whereas Trump and other altright leaders do the opposite. They talk about 2nd amendment as a way to solve political and judicial "problems" for example. The altright has gotten that message and have already planned bombings of Somali immigrants, for example, just days ago.]
[http://imgur.com/gallery/wnIaRyJ]
[Oh stop being a concern troll and crawl back to whatever basket you came from.]
[Yeah, the people getting beaten at Trump rallies are *protesters* who are beaten at Trump's command. To quote Trump re protesters, “Knock the crap out of them …. I promise you, I will pay for the legal fees.”]
[He said that when talking about if someone attempts to attack him. I don't support trump but let's not rewrite history. http://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-legal-fees-punch-protester-2016-3 there is plenty to bury him with without twisting the truth. You only diminish the actual bad stuff by twisting his words in "the boy who cried wolf" type fashion.]
[Lol wat?]
[To be honest, it' probably party politics that got us here. The founding fathers warned us about parties and yet here we are....]
[here's a stewart lee bit on the same thing, similar to your post https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwkEEqXT3uQ]
[hahahah thats awesome!]
[Good old fashioned British Terrorism. Just don't tell them that.]
[People started yo run over crowds with trucks. Or shoot up night clubs all with the same religious association]
[100% agree. We should also be very vocal against anybody who attempts to condone this. This behavior is not okay.]
[Problem is that Trump is trying to say who did it right off the bat and use it as a political tool.]
[Let's not stoop to trumps level.]
[Funny how so many on this sub are trying to spin this against Trump supporters, claiming with certainty that it's a false flag. You even have people saying this is Trump's fault because of his "rhetoric" and comments in this very comment chain saying that "sometimes you need ugly tactics against an ugly opponent." Why can't we just say this is a bad thing and Trump supporters arent evil monsters who either must have done this or deserve it? The type of emotion driven demonization we see every day here on this sub of anything related to Trump is what has lead to this point. We have to get over this "them evil, us good" mentality.]
[Oh don't be absurd this is obviously trump loonies, this will be the 2nd time in a week trump loonies have been Iinked to terrorist attacks. These people are the scum of this country.]
[You must really live in some kind of liberal safe space echo chamber.]
[You must live in some sort of dumb fuck southern state where terrorism is dandy as long as it's a white dude bombing people trump doesn't like.]
[No, it isn't "obviously" the work of "Trump loonies". Believe me I am NO fan of Trump, but at this point there's no guarantee, or even evidence beyond mere speculation, that this was a false flag attack.]
[No its not a false flag trump is encouraging this behavior against the GOP. The only people doing this type of shit are trump loonies they are unhinged and crazy lashing out against anything that trump blames as a problem.]
[Uhhh proof?]
[Don't feed this troll. A quick check of his comment history will tell you everything you need to know.]

[To be fair it *could* be. The message implies it's from the left, but it could be to cause an uproar against the left. We don't have enough info to tell one way or another and won't until we know who actually did it.]
[Eh, CNN already went there. Victim blaming much? So gross.]
[It is a bad thing. Our country is not at the point where either side should resort to violence. But you do have one side with a candidate that regularly incites hatred and demogoguery and is creating the powder keg political environment. He tapped into the segment of the disenfranchised population's anger and he is riling them up. That is the danger in this election. The political environment is so full of hate and anger in this election and it just takes one unstable angry person.]
[> Why can't we just say this is a bad thing and Trump supporters arent evil monsters who either did this or deserve it? Terrorism is wrong. Period. The terrorists who did this need to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. Period. **Those two statements are irrefutable.** But if we ignore the hateful rhetoric which led to this terrorism we dismiss it as being unimportant, and thus, we become a part of the problem that led to the terrorism in the first place. I'm of the opinion that this terrorism is treason because it is an act of terror against the entire electoral process. I'm also of the opinion that hateful rhetoric based on blatant lies, such as claims that [the Islamic State may take over the U.S. if Clinton wins](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/10/12/donald-trump-ocala-hillary-clinton-islamic-state-paul-ryan/91955808/) is unAmerican and it needs to be called out as such because it leads to violence if not worse. Terrorism is wrong. Period. Prosecute the terrorists. Period. But only a fool would ignore the hateful rhetoric by the leader of a major political party which inspired the terrorism.]

[I can't help noticing that you have to resort to making up fake quotes which are downright absurd in order to take a conversation about terrorism, which I unquestionably denounced, and twist it wildly out of context as you try widen the political divide. Some people want to be part of the solution whereas others just want to worsen the problem. I need not say which side of the equation you're on since your words speak for themselves, vulgarity and all.]
[>I can't help noticing that you have to resort to making up fake quotes I was translating your long-winded diatribe into something more readable, you should be thanking me instead of the salt. >which I unquestionably denounced **BUT...** **BUT BUT BUT** Fuck you. You don't follow up, "Yeah they tried to murder innocent people, **BUT**....". That makes you a serious fucking piece of shit, which you are. Completely.

Hmm? **"Yes they were innocent and killing is wrong, *^but*... could they of possibly deserved it?"** YOU'RE SO CLEVER! MAN YOU GOT THAT RIGHT PASSED ME! WOOOOWWWW, liberal community college is the shit! You guys are as sharp as plastic butter knives! Serrated and everything.]

[There are dangerous people out there of all political affiliations. Trump supporters don't have the monopoly on violence. I don't care if you're voting Clinton or Trump. If you committed this crime you deserve to go to jail. "You need ugly tactics against an ugly opponent". Yeah that guy is an idiot. We need to keep a lid on crazy and extreme views regardless of whether you're Republican or Democrat.]
[> Why can't we just say this is a bad thing and Trump supporters arent evil monsters who either did this or deserve it? Why can't we just say advocating violence or perpetrating violence against your fellow countrymen is a bad thing in almost every conceivable circumstance?]
[I don't see individuals doing much about it, perhaps the Democratic Nominee could speak up and tell listeners this is not okay. Firebombing, violent protests, vandalism, and assault is not okay, even if they're disagriing with your politics.]
[The democratic nominee, the national dnc, and the North Carolina dnc have already condemned it. Far better than the circling the wagons the republicans did after trumps "second amendment solution" comments.]
[The second amendment *is* meant for the corrupt and tyrannical. I would say, "droning Julian Assange," is much worse since he is actually in possession of emails Clinton had stored in her illegal private server before she illegally destroyed the evidence that implemented the Clinton foundation being used for illegal purposes.]

Coverage of this particular incident – which is absolutely an act of violence against the GOP – is currently a top story on the websites of [CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/16/politics/north-carolina-gop-office-vandalized/), [NBC](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/nc-republican-office-firebombed-nazi-gopers-threatened-graffiti-n667316), [Fox News](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/10/16/north-carolina-gop-headquarters-firebombed.html), [USA Today](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/10/16/north-carolina-gop-office-firebombed/92211622/), [The New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/17/us/north-carolina-gop-building-is-firebombed.html?_r=0), [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/local-gop-office-struck-by-molotov-cocktail-in-north-carolina/2016/10/16/3f2277d6-93de-11e6-bb29-bf2701dbe0a3_story.html), [NPR](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/10/16/498180111/after-attack-on-n-c-gop-office-politicians-decry-attack-on-our-democracy), and others. Clearly you are mistaken: the media is reporting violence against Republicans. > When Trump supporters got beaten up, they literally tried to blame them for "instigating" their own beating. Could you be a bit more specific? (Which incident? Which report?) To help you remember, [here's Slate's running list of violent incidents at Trump events.](http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/03/02/a_list_of_violent_incidents_at_donald_trump_rallies_and_events.html) It includes events instigated by anti-Trump protesters, and each of the events is accompanied by a link to Slate's own coverage, which invariably includes Associated Press, Reuters, and other mainstream press sources.]
[I was watching CNN when the story broke. They didn't have much to say about it. They had much more to say about Trumps tweet about it. I'm a centrist... I really don't have a dog in this fight... but it seems obvious to me that the media tends to pay less attention to political violence against the right.]
[The right is the only political entity consistently advocating violence, violence that is most often target at the most vulnerable members of society, whether it officially avows those voices or just fails to specifically disavow them. In the end, something like this is an isolated incident. Things like attacks on minorities are fostered indirectly by the rhetoric of the right. I'm sorry, but there isn't an equivalency here. We should all try to be decent, moral human beings. That doesn't mean claiming the center in all things. No legitimizing voice of the DNC has been encouraging people to do something like this. The same cannot be said for the other side. Being "objective" doesn't preclude taking a side in light of facts. When one side does it, they are breaking ranks. It's a tragedy, but not one of much more political significance than any other crime. When the other does it, we have to wonder whether the ant-authoritarian rhetoric that is so prevalent in this campaign might actually be dangerous.]
[> The right is the only political entity consistently advocating violence Obama and Hillary Clinton are literally threatening to go to war with Russia for exposing their obscene corruption. Republicans have the reputation for war, but Democrats are at least just as bad.]
[But you must understand that there's a sizable difference between threatening economic and diplomatic sanctions (neither person you mentioned has ever threatened anything remotely close to putting troops on the ground in Russia... in response to the DNC hack or otherwise) and inciting domestic violence against vulnerable demographics of their fellow Americans, right? They are not just as bad. One of them is a government. The other is a shit show.]
[If the story had just broke, there probably wasn't enough information to talk about yet.]
[I'm from Northern Ireland, and this shit happens all the time with party offices, Catholic churches and Orange halls. Welcome to a truly divided society idealogically. Similarities to NI society: - The seething hate. The unsuppressed rage we're seeing. The torrid use of really nasty terms to dehumanise the other 'side', and the use of terms like "your kind". The lack of debate in favour of ad-hominem, and the lack of respect for other people's views. - The threat of looming violence. People gearing themselves up for war, and ready to intimidate people. - This is a horrific violent attack, and it cannot be condoned. It's going to turn into tit-for-tat violence, and then escalate even more. Stuff like this is going to continue. - For me personally, the cognitive dissonance associated with wanting to believe there's noone that crazy out there, but they're there. They're all around you. *All the time*. - The tarring of someone as "one of them" for even having one slight opinion that maybe leans more towards the perceived opposition's views. The "you're either with us or against us" mentality eg. Paul Ryan being branded disparagingly as a "liberal" now. Don't get me wrong, my home is an absolutely astoundingly beautiful place, with some of the kindest and funniest people you'll ever meet, but it has seen war in my lifetime. It's still climbing out of the rubble of those days, and there are still many, many sensitivities. When I moved from NI to the US it was refreshing to be able to talk ideas and politics without feeling threatened, or feeling like you're creating a rift. Now it's here too.]
[> The torrid use of really nasty terms to dehumanise the other 'side', and the use of terms like "your kind". Not to get right back into partisanship, but these things are not equally found on both sides. You don't hear Hillary immediately tweeting shit like, "Animals supporting Trump were caught in the planning stages of bombing an apartment full of Somali refugees in Kansas." I think liberals have reacted to Trump's increasingly violent rhetoric fairly appropriately, with only a few isolated incidents like this one (which hasn't yet been proven to have been perpetrated by anyone associated with democrats). One side is still relatively civil, while the other side has been rotting within itself.]
[I certainly don't disagree with you. However I just wanted to talk about what I'm seeing in a non-pointed way so I can't be accused of promoting any sort of agenda or spin.]
[I'm with you, but you don't have to look to far to find similar rhetoric on the democratic side. i.e. "deplorables" Hillary apologized for it, but the community has certainly picked up the flag and it's not going away any time soon.]
[how can you be 'with' OP but not think that the trump campaign is deplorable? edit: i guess this is /r/politics so i didn't need clarify that i was serious lol sorry]
[I never believed people telling me how beautiful NI is until I went there.]
[It truly is stunning. I hope you had a good time. It holds some of the [most beautiful parts of Ireland](https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2015/08/27/14/giants-causeway.jpg). My posts may have been talking about the negatives of N.Irish society but if you ever take a trip to Ireland, try visiting the North. It'll blow you away with it's beauty and hospitality. The people there are frank, kind and very humorous too.]
[Sorry to disappoint you :(]
[So which american rock band will make a song like Zombie next year? /s]
[You have to remember that the majority of people in the US feel apathy to politics, it's only a tiny minority that cares enough to provoke violence.]
[we need to get this situation under control. yesterday. as you said, things are going to get bad]
[Liberal has been spit as a pejorative since I was born at the very least. And I'm in my 30s.]
[It's pronounced "libruhl"]
[>The tarring of someone as "one of them" for even having one slight opinion that maybe leans more towards the perceived opposition's views. The "you're either with us or against us" mentality This is the one that's most shocking, is that according to anyone who is a Hillary supporter, because I have a bunch of serious misgivings about Hillary which I refuse to not speak up about, I must be a trump supporter. As if any dissent is now equal to opposition.]
[Same situation here friend. My honest hope is that anyone not implicated in what seems to be a budding plot line of dots with the Dems goes public first and connects the dots before the media or Reps do. They swap candidates at the possibility of high ranking leadership facing long term legal challenges. "Hey we busted the racket!" This leads to a much more favorably received candidate. Republicans drop or find a way to ditch Trump in favor of someone who will need to be favored rather than rely on the other candidates short-comings. The thought of either current primary candidate as the person leading this country makes me concerned in very serious ways regarding our ability to sustain a Democratic nationhood.]
[we get occasional race riots so we beat you there]
[It's said in NI you can determine what 'side' someone is on by their first or second name, or by how they pronounce the letter "H". [We put up with this shit every year.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDvzGtb0QZM)]
[america is too big for that - basically if you are white in america, you are just a "white guy", dont matter if you have an italian or german last name what northern ireland has got is like turf wars, like you see in small african nations - americas teams are the states, and the divide is more liberal and conservative even americas race riots arent really ALL of america, you are talking about certain segments in certain states, mostly for certain cities]
[Yes, absolutely. My question is, are people going to be hawkishly trying to read each other subconsciously in the US to find out what 'side' they're on like they do in NI? Is that a thing here, even?]
[america naturally has this 2 party system thing going (republican and democrat) so its pretty easy to identify people, tho some people say they are independent or none america had a civil war in the 1860s, and the split was the north-east (liberal) and south-east, so that would be a natural divide currently I see a lot of left-wing types in america flocking to cities like san francisco, which is causing house prices to skyrocket (but they still keep coming) - so theres shifts happening there basically I dont see direct conflict in americas future, so much as I see self-segregation and maybe some states being split in half, which has happened before]
[> america naturally has this 2 party system thing going It's not natural, it's built into the winner-take-all system.]
[built in = natural]
[> natural (adjective) 1. existing in or formed by nature (opposed to artificial): Not according to the dictionary. If being built in is your definition of natural, what do you think is artificial?]
[Ive been watching Westworld on HBO, there is no natural.]
[> Paul Ryan being branded disparagingly as a "liberal" now. he did say we need to have a social safety net... right before he tried to rend it. ah, those were the good ol'e days.]
[That was chilling to read. You just told us that the current mood in the US is similar to what you remember back in the IRA days of Northern Ireland. If you're right bad times are ahead. Fuck.]
[How can anyone be surprised? Have you been listening to what's been going on at Trump rallies?]
[The mood is still very much there in NI- NI made *great* strides to build a fragile peace, but there is still a lot of hate and bitterness, and occasional heavy violence in Belfast. What I'm talking about is seeing similarities between that and what we're seeing with this election. The real concern is that it *could* potentially turn into larger violence over here. My wife's father sent her a blistering text the other night describing he and his friend's readiness for war in light of this election outcome. I'm in Texas. If it's this close to me personally, I can't imagine what's going on in the wider nation.]
[> nobody was killed Well that's a relief. We sure as hell don't need political violence in an already difficult election, so we can at least be happy that no lives were lost.]
[When the GOP staged it, they were certain to do it after hours.]
[Imagine this goes all hunger games and people are locked in a game room for entertainment. Deplorables first then pepes.]
[In a game room? So billiards, cards, and darts? Maybe a couple cold beers. That sounds fun!]
[Hahahaha. Imagine? "THIS WILL SHOW THEM!! Muhahaha!"]
[This shit is getting historically bad, it seems Might be the end of peaceful shifts in power]
[Please. The Republican base is aging out. Another decade or two and they'll all be too old and frail to hang a black guy or stab a gay to death.]
[No it's not... We had way more political violence in the 70's. This is literally nothing.. It's all bluster. Don't worry.]
[Glad to see us regressing in every way.. police shooting people and not getting penalized, political outrage, politcal rigging, a crook and a jackoff running for President, labor laws, wage slavery, and all that.. good times Rome.. I mean America.]
[[Except the world is getting better all the time]( http://www.vox.com/2015/7/13/8908397/11-charts-best-time-in-history)]
[Actual slaves and those that know how slaves in America were treated do not like the word slavery to be used to describe low wage jobs and the type of the economy surrounding them. Just like Holocaust survivors do not like people using the word "holocaust" to describe minor incidents or non-genocides.I understand the English language changes all of the time, but words do matter.]
[We already have political violence. It's called Black Lives Matter]
[What, are you joking? Trump supporters have been regularly assaulted. The fact that you don't know that indicates that it's probably not been reported to you. And the reason that is is because the media thinks it's okay.]
[My comment didn't imply anything about that. I know that Trump supporters got beaten. I also know [what happens at Trump rallies](https://youtu.be/WL29B9eh4qQ?t=2m4).]
[Does firebombing not count as violence?]
[That's what he said wasn't needed.]
[There already had been violence this election!!!! How many trump supporters have been beaten? Probably in the hundreds if not more.]
[Yes, some Trump supporters got beaten. Hundreds, I would be cautious before making such a claim. And would also not forget that [both sides are responsible](https://youtu.be/WL29B9eh4qQ?t=2m4).]
[Great deductive reasoning]
[There has already been a ton of assaults this election cycle. YouTube is full of videos of Trump supporters being attacked. This election is insane.]
[As well as Trump supporters attacking people. Let's not think that any side as the moral high ground when it comes to how "peaceful" their supporters are.]
[I abhor Donald as much as anyone, but it really bothers me to read about peoples' absentee ballots being destroyed and other peop!e being intimidated. Worried about escalating retaliation from the crazier elements on both sides, too.]
[There shouldnt be any tolerance for this sort of thing, no matter who the victim is. Edit: Since my phrasing can apparently be taken in a way I didnt intend, ill clear it up. What I mean is that no matter what your political beliefs are, acts like this should not be tolerated. Whether the victims are the opposing side does not matter. Just as the men who were conspiring to kill immigrants in Kansas arent representative of the vast majority of conservatives, so whoever did this is not representative of the vast majority of liberals. Most conservatives are horrified at the idea of slaughtering people due to their ideas (or simply because of who they are), just as liberals are. I am a liberal. I may see you conservatives as opponents in politics, but you arent my enemies as people. I accept that you have good intentions, as I hope you know my intentions are good. We simply disagree on the path forward. We need to stop seeing the other side in these monolithic and ominous terms or we will really be in trouble. Feat. /u/kabanaga]
[Agreed. You can't blame the people too much, the media has got people crazy over this Trump stuff. Imagine it's the majority who get like this, who's the next target? Super scary.]
[It's not just people tolerating it, there's also people that are trying to spin this into attacks on Democrats. As if *anyone* has been calling for violence on that side.]
[This is the problem with inciting violence in a campaign. You can't always assume it's going to be your followers committing it. "For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind" Unless the rhetoric is dialed back, things will just get progressively worse as we approach election day.]
[Like labeling people deplorables and evil racists? Edit: downvote all you want but if you don't see the absolute vitriol and hate incited against Trump supporters in the media and on Reddit then you're literally just blind. Of course Trump's side does it too with the "cuck" shit, but only one candidate has actually called the supporters these things and that's Hillary.]
[Well if they weren't being bigots and calling for a second civil war and promising to harass minorities at the polls, maybe people would like them more.]
[Great re-education efforts, comrade! If we band together and make all Trump supporters see how implicitly biased and bigoted they are, they will surely understand our enlightened and tolerant party is only here to make them better Americans!]
[The only re-education effort mentioned this election is Mike Pence's support for "conversion therapy" aka electroshocking LGB teenagers until they're ~~straight~~ suicidal. But yeah, both parties are equivalent and all that.]
[Victim blaming is out this year I thought? Do you think firebombing a political headquarter isn't essentially calling for a second civil war? What about all the Democrat supporters calling for a second civil war? You can see that same shit all the time on Twitter and Facebook. You know, all the people saying exterminate the whites, exterminate the Republicans etc. I mean, I've seen videos of supporters on both sides being harassed and beaten at polls and rallies, why do you act like it's only one side doing this shit?]
[It is not victim blaming to point out the reasonable reasons people don't like someone. It is not victim blaming if I tell Jimmy that people don't like him because he shows up drunk to parties and break things. It is not victim blaming to tell Susan that no one likes her because she constantly insults everyone. It is not victim blaming to believe that Trump is a racist bigot and that a portion of the people who support him are either alright with that, or are racists and bigots themselves.]
[Because only one candidate encourages it.]
[So the logic is that because people on Reddit and liberals will no longer stand for awful hateful shit they're as bad as Trump supporters? Oh okay.]
[The logic is that people on Reddit and liberals are promoting awful hateful shit. Just look around on this fucking website, it's ridiculous. Edit: "some" liberals. I don't promote hateful shit and I'm pretty left leaning but jesus christ this is like watching other atheists being hateful to Christians at this point. It's embarrassing to look at the amount of hate coming out of the left right now.]
[...so you're annoyed that people are calling out the racist and hateful shit that Trump and his supporters are saying? This idea that the horseshoe theory is a thing is really dumb.]
[They're not only calling out hateful shit that Trump and his supporters are saying, they're directing hate their way. Calling them white trash, calling them uneducated and stupid, calling them garbage and filth and "deplorables". Making fake accusations and calling them facts. There are tons of Trump supporters that aren't racist but you'd never know it by looking on here. I understand that /r/politics is a Hillary haven and what I'm saying will be downvoted but if you can't see how toxic the discourse has gotten then I don't know what to say to you. I'm not saying the right wingers are less bad, they're shitty as fuck too and say a lot of fucked up things about liberals but that is no reason for liberals to go to the same lengths. Whatever happened to being the side that didn't stoop to these lows? It's a fuckin race to the bottom at this point.]
[Fucking too right hate is being sent their way. At this point, after everything that has happened in this campaign, if you are voting for Trump you're a piece of shit, it's as simple as that, I don't give a fuck what mental gymnastics you go through to excuse you voting for him but it is what it is. Also, this sub is not a Hillary haven, people will happily talk about her faults, we just hate Trump more because he's a fascist piece of shit.]
[Tone police!]
[> This is the problem with inciting violence in a campaign THIS. http://imgur.com/gallery/44jJY www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMux_UHmpvc]
[You are seriously trying to compare someone getting hit by an egg to the Holocaust.]
[Not trying. They just did.]
[Yeah and whirlwind these degenerates will reap next is a bullet through the fucking brow.]
[That's not helping.]
[no but neither is implying "you must change your policies or else this kind of violence is bound to happen" it's like political blackmail.]
[Epic victim blaming friend-o! The tolerant left has shown me the light! Will report to North Carolina for mandatory sensitivity re-education ASAP. #Imwithhernow]
[Hey, you worded that very well.]
[Victims blaming! We need to call for armed revolution with clinton wins. MAGA with your guns! /s]
[Solid victim blaming!]
[Learned it from watching the groper Donald. Ole grab em by the pussy and blame them for being ugly etc.]
[Yeah. Like when the poor Nazis had their Reichstag burned. And then...]
[And then the government that was in power declared a state of emergency? So you're saying Obama's administration did this?]
[Nope. But Cui bono, who benefits? The Republicans.]
[Sure. Maybe loosen your tinfoil hat a bit, mate.]
[Well, you're close, but it's a tad different than blaming a woman that gets raped for wearing scant clothing or being drunk. This is more akin to a man standing in an auditorium telling the right side of the crowd to beat the shit out of the left side, and then being appalled when the left side preemptively (in their minds) attacks the right. This attack was absolutely unjustifiable, but no political party should *ever* support a candidate that is actively suggesting his supporters commit violence against members of another party.]
[Neither candidate is actively suggesting their supporters to commit violence.]
[Been living in a cave for 11 months?]
[Been following closely. Have any sources?]
[>Hillary wants to abolish, essentially abolish the Second Amendment," Trump said to the crowd of supporters gathered in the Trask Coliseum at North Carolina University in Wilmington. "If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks. >"Although the Second Amendment people, maybe there is. I don't know." Just to cover the usual counterpoints from trump supporters: Just because Trump didn't commit the crime of incitement is a different issue. The laws about incitement are necessarily narrow as laws against certain types of speech set dangerous precedents. Trump did not commit a crime when he said this and I am not suggesting that the act should be criminal.]
[Those second amendment people have been trying to stop Jerry Brown in CA. We're getting petitions signed to try and get a referendum on the ballot. How violent of us.]
[Yeah, that's totally something only "the Second Amendment people" could do. Nobody else could ever sign a petition against or politically oppose Hillary's supreme court nominations.]
[Really? http://mashable.com/2016/03/12/trump-rally-incite-violence/#kLvhu8QMdiqI Second Amendment People? http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/10/us/politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton.html http://www.npr.org/2016/09/16/494328717/trumps-second-amendment-rhetoric-again-veers-into-threatening-territory]
[Lol how soft are you? Joking he'd be able to beat up a guy rushing his podium is now inciting violence? Saying you can hit back is inciting violence? Saying that people are too soft escorting protestors out because they're afraid they might accidentally hurt someone is inciting violence? Those second amendment people are the same ones here in CA who are trying to stop Jerry Brown. You know how we're doing it? With petitions. People like you are why this country and its leaders are considered weak. Adults have to walk on eggshells so as not to frighten or offend you.]
[There were like 5 videos, including one where he offered to pay the legal bills of anyone who beat the guy. Give me a fucking break. Your fascist idol is a violent, uncouth monster. And second, there was no mistaken meaning. He talked about how if Hillary won, nobody could stop her from nominating her judges, and then said "Except for the second amendment people". What else could that realistically mean!? And the idea that our country and its leaders are considered weak is false. Our country was detested around the developed world, and citizens of our allies had near-zero approval ratings for W. Obama has singlehandedly restored respect around the world among our allies. http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/06/24/7-charts-on-how-the-world-views-president-obama/]
[I would argue that he suggested that Second Amendment supporters might be able to shoot her in reprisal for trying to abolish the amendment when he said [this](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/10/us/politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton.html). He didn't come right out and say it, but you'd have to be pretty socially unaware not to catch what he was implying.]
[Us 2nd amendment people are trying to do something about Jerry Brown. How violent of us to organize drives to get signatures for petitions!!]
[Like I said, you'd have to be pretty socially unaware not to realize what he was implying.]
[Okay bud. That's why he was arrested for threatening the life of a government official and presidential candidate. Obviously the secret service must be socially unaware.]
[Ugh. Wow. Thanks to a mixture of being completely socially inept and out of touch with recent events, you're really not equipped to participate in this discussion. 1. You don't get arrested if you're careful about how you word things. It's not illegal to subtly suggest that someone should kill someone else. 2. The secret service [*did* question Trump's campaign](http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/10/politics/trump-second-amendment/) about his comments. You'd know this if you were actually keeping track of this shit. Seriously, just...stop. Stop, or spend a few hours reading up so you actually know what's going on.]
[Too true. Since day one, the vast majority of political violence has come from Clinton's camp. Disgusting.]
[Since the 9-11 attacks, most domestic terrorism has been from right-wing militia groups who are probably mostly Trump supporters. Second place goes to Islamic terrorists. I'm not even sure if left wing terrorism is on the list.]
[Since day one of the election. It's mostly been Clinton supporters. You can't seriously argue otherwise.]
[To be fair, he's not blaming the Republican office or Republicans, the actual victims. He's blaming Trump.]
[So Trump threw the firebombs?]
[No, OP blamed the terrorist?-vandals? for the fire bombing and blamed Trump for inciting violence.]
[Trump is inciting violence.]
[[Mashup of Trump praising violence against protesters](http://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2016/03/12/donald-trump-rallies-violence-protests-mashup-lv.cnn)]
[Trump supporters are continuously attacked by leftists. Leftists blame Trump because logic.]
[Liberal logic]
[Yeah and Trump supporters attack people too but Trump supporters always cherry pick because lack of logic.]
[Not even remotely close to the same amount.]
[http://youtu.be/0t7PnrelFdY Mashup of ACTUAL violence against Trump supporters]
[Vile and disgusting. It reminds me of the fucking brownshirts attacking political opponents. My jaw drops at the unhinged idea that this is labeled okay by the goers of this board, simply because they politically disagree. Do you see what you've become?]
[Um...nobody is justifying violence. What has been said is you cant go around calling minorities rapists, calling for a ban on a religion, calling to legalize torture, calling for stop and frisk, calling to jail ones opponents, saying youll pay legal bills for assault, saying this is the last chance for the country and if you lose its because its rigged, etc. and then be shocked when shit erupts.]
[I think using the word "nobody" paints with a pretty broad stroke, in fact I'd say a little too broad. And Trump is indeed outrageous and bombastic, but I would like a lot less PC and a lot more plain spoken opinion, especially when the alternative is public and private positions.]
[so its best to promote more violence? i guess trump supports think the answer is yes]
[Hillary said republicans are her biggest enemy, has called them deplorable and irredeemable. It's a huge dog-whistle to crazy people like this. Even if you won't admit. Which is hilarious cause if Trump had said the same thing and this happened you'd be saying it's his own fault.]
[The ones that are still voting for him are deplorables. I mean forget that he's an abuser of women, the man is literally the enemy of American democracy. He spends all his time falsely claiming the election will be rigged (when the GOP has historically been the primary group attempting to 'rig' elections), defending Russia and Russian interest, suggesting people go to minority neighborhoods and intimate voters, encouraging white supremacists, talking about getting rid of freedom of press, suggesting he would jail his opponent and her lawyers, all while running on a platform of giving more money to the rich and more power to corporations at the expense of the middle and lower class. I strongly disagree with firebombing GOP offices and/or any other violence in our election process, but to suggest this was caused by Hillery, and not Donald's hateful rhetoric is just ridiculous.]
[Ask the media. What Trump said should never have caused violence, but when you have irresponsible media claiming that Trump = Hitler on a 24/7 news cycle you then have horrible reactions like this.]
[>media claiming that Trump = Hitler on a 24/7 news cycle That's a lie.]
[Repeating his words is what the media is doing.]
[all the media does is repeat trumps own words.]
[You mean to tell me trump threatening and marginalizing every minority didn't have anything to do with it?]
[[removed]]
[That's from June 5th. There are many more.]
[What were they wearing?]
[Likely brown shirts.]
[And red hats.]
[Yeah totally. That's why they wrote "Leave Nazi Republicans" on the building.]
[Trump brand brown shirts. It's a false flag]
[more likely red hats.]
[Yeah that's why they wrote "leave nazi republicans" on it.]
[They were on sale.]
[There should be 0 tolerance for violence like this, but there also has to be _some point_ at which this country discusses the culture surrounding this election. We should be sickened not only by the people committing violence, but also by those fomenting violence, discrediting this election process, and those who refuse to acknowledge any responsibility for when it happens.]
[I agree. The media should take responsibility as a whole for their collusion with the democrats in trying to sway the election, and also the democrats and media should apologize for painting Trump and his supporters as a second coming of Hitler. This is what happens when crying NAZI RACIST KKK goes too far.]
[No, I think it's about time you take responsibility for yourselves. You might start with not being racist nazis if you can't handle being called and treated as such -- I could grab any one of you by those whiny pussies you pretend are just small dicks, but I wouldn't do that (Führer Loompa might, though).]
[Threatening to sexually assault Trump supporters and justifying domestic terrorism. Lol you are delusional buddy]
[I said I could, not that I would. Anyway, SJW-like fake outrage from you because I talked about you the way Trump talks about people like me. If you have a problem with being spoken to like that, I don't think you're fit for the workforce.]
[The media doesn't need to portray anything. Trump does it well on his own and his supporters help very well.]
[Media conspiracy aside, you can't deny there's visible racism/ bigotry to be found within a decent sized faction of Trump followers. He also seems to have [found a nice following of white supremacists](https://www.google.ca/amp/www.vox.com/platform/amp/policy-and-politics/2016/10/14/13287532/trump-white-supremacists-racists).]
[>Media conspiracy aside Given the connotations of conspiracy, it is important to note that wikileaks has shown active collusion. >He also seems to have found a nice following of white supremacists. And Hillary is supported by revolutionary communists who want to overthrow the political system in addition to terrorists such as Omar Mateen and the washington mall shooter. What is your point? Are a bunch of racists on twitter with pepe the frog in their avatar so dangerous that you need to fire bomb campaign volunteers?]
[Wikileaks seems to if you don't look for context. Like [this explanation](http://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/10/14/magazine/anatomy-of-a-media-conspiracy.html?_r=0) from the main reporter people are yelling at for being "owned" by the campaign. The "collusion" was the journalist asking if he could use portions of an off the record interview. With OTR established, the journalist surrenders control of it, and the campaign has every right to deny usage for publication. The "proof" of collusion is rather routine communication between journalists and the campaign. Being polite and respectful is part of maintaining access. A friendly rapport doesn't mean there's corruption. And the "leaked question" debacle was debunked by the Sanders campaign, and they said they also were in frequent contact and received guidance from Brazile. My point is people here are chiding the media for reporting on racism and calling Trump certain things, when his rhetoric and some of his supporters show that they're correct. Omar Meteen's father supports her. I don't think this one guy is a signal to a large trend in her base. And who are these communists? Sanders supporters were/are generally far left but Hillary is far from a revolutionary. No one here is defending this firebombing. Obviously it's stupid and dangerous to do such a thing.]
[You think routine communication includes, for example with NYT, granting a veto power to Clinton in regards to content? Regardless, let us go further into who supports who since it seems to be so telling in your eyes. What does the support of Saudi Arabia and various other Islamic states say about Hillary Clinton? I dont think any white nationalists on twitter are stoning women and gays.]
[As I said, the NYT reporter did an off the record story. As he explains, in that scenario you have agreed not to publish what is said, and It's entirely routine in that situation for the subject to have veto power. The US government has relations with the Middle East, yes. They have their reasons, and it's not like Hillary is alone in that in any way. And this is a false equivalency- yes the Middle East is largely shit in terms of human rights but I don't see how throwing that out there means that Donald doesn't have a portion of bigoted followers.]
[You know that the US has relations with Saudi Arabia, right? It's not that weird to get donations to your charity from foreign "allies." You also know that Donald Trump has made money in Saudi Arabia, right? He still does business there today, despite condemning the country and their leaders. Speaking of their leaders, did you know that he sold the entire 45th floor of his Trump World Tower (which is in NYC) to the Saudi Kingdom in 2001 for $4.5m? He has also taken money from them each year for maintenance, nearly $100k a year. They used the apartments later as part of their mission to get into the UN. And Trump doesn't speak of this, yet he calls for Hillary to return their money from her foundation, claiming ethics as his reasoning. So by his own words, Trump acts unethical. And by his own actions, he's hypocritical. He also doesn't display diplomacy to our "allies" but does show a fondness to another country that has compromised our election process (which he denies, despite intelligence experts from both sides assuring him of).]
[> media should apologize for painting Trump and his supporters as a second coming of Hitler I take it you haven't been watching your chief conspiracy theorist rave about globalist bankers. He applies the paint on his own.]
[And when Bernie Sanders said that the Fed was hijacked by bankers that was nazism too?]
[No, because it wasn't accompanied by racist and sexist rhetoric and threats to jail the political opponent and persecute the press.]
[Are all the FBI members who wanted to prosecute HRC nazis too? Are libel laws Nazi? Is everything you dont like nazi?]
[You asked a question, i answered. thats the distinction bw sanders and trump.]
[Bernie had coherent proposals to regulate banks. He didn't blame "globalist bankers" for all his problems as if there was some vast conspiracy where an entire class of people was attacking him.]
[Ah, so when Bernie does it, it is ok and not nazism because he is more articulate with his plan in your eyes. Nazism is all about articulation, got it. When HRC openly tells groups Goldman Sachs that she has one position with them and another with the public? How is she not conspiring?]
[>Ah, so when Bernie does it, it is ok and not nazism because he is more articulate with his plan in your eyes. Nazism is all about articulation, got it. Exactly, there are plenty of things we can change with banking regulations and talking about making those changes doesn't really have anything to do with Nazism. Raving liking a fucking lunatic about cabals of "globalist bankers" who are apparently creating conspiracies to destroy American generally and Trump in particularly sounds like Nazism. Especially in context with the cult of authority he's built. >When HRC openly tells groups Goldman Sachs that she has one position with them and another with the public? How is she not conspiring? Conspiring to do what? Are there positions she holds in her speeches that you think are conspiracies and if so which ones?]
[> We should be sickened not only by the people committing violence, **but ...** 100% expected of /r/politics.]
[I swear this sub would be happy if every Republican was murdered]
[You'd be wrong, but don't let that stop you.]
[>but also by those fomenting violence, discrediting this election process, and those who refuse to acknowledge any responsibility for when it happens. What, you couldn't finish reading the sentence?]
[If he had the skills to properly read the first part of the sentence he still wouldn't have posted this, because "not only" never excludes the person who committed the act.]
[[deleted]]
[Perhaps if his supporters didn't manifest his violent rhetoric into actions this wouldn't have happened.]
[perhaps if everyone wasn't so one sided. and discusssed the issues rather than bashing, maybe we would get to see a pretty damn good debate. Trump is a Damned fool, and Hillary is letting others speak for her.]
[You gonna defend sexual assault being ok? Discrimination based on religion, sexual orientation, or even national heritage? Gotta call a spade a spade man. Plenty of Trump supporters actively support these things. Sorry if it hurts your feelings but how the majority of the country sees it.]
[That's not how the majority of the country sees it. That's how YOU see it. I know plenty trump supporters. and they are nothing like this sub describes.]
[Perhaps Trump convincing his followers that the Republicans are the ones holding him back from the presidency might have contributed to this act as well.]
[Agreed. We should also not just call everyone racist, sexist, xenophobic, etc, because they have views we disagree with.]
[But whenever someone is being racist, sexist or xenophobic,which isn't that uncommon in politics, they should be called out firmly.]
[And well after election day. the lunatics are already out of the bottle.]
[If you did this because cause you hate Trump and his supporters, you're worse than they are.]
[True, but Trump is already putting blame on the opposing party and using it as fuel for more conflict and to motivate his cause & supporters, which isn't right either.]
[No, it isnt. He is making a bad situation far more dangerous.]
[Free speech is sacrosanct and a founding principle of our democracy. Using violence and intimidation to silence other, no matter what you think of their views, attack the very fabric of a free and open society.]
[Terrorism is terrorism. It must NOT be tolerated, and we must NOT point fingers at broad groups of people.]
[Agreed. But something about the wording of the spray painted phrase “Nazi Republicans get out of town or else” just doesn't ring true to me.]
[Woodhouse also mentioned the graffiti that said “Nazi Republicans leave town or else.” “Or else what? That is what we all wonder, or else what,” he said. “Because we’re not going anywhere.” Read more here: http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/article108627627.html#storylink=cpy I thought this was weird phrasing: I'm fairly certain he's not admitting he's a Nazi, but the wording was off.]
[Exactly. They use Nazi propaganda, but are not true Nazis.]
[eh, some people really are very 2D. This election if anything demonstrated that much. Unless further evidence shows otherwise, you should suppose this is exactly what it seems like; left-wing brain-dead morons that will hopefully soon be in jail...]
[No we shouldnt suppose anything until we know.]
[And that "knowing" would constitute what, someone's guilt being proven beyond reasonable doubt in a court of law? Quite the double standard, as I don't really see people that hesitant to form reasonable working hypothesis about a number of current events otherwise. You have a clear motive, an entire background narrative of escalation during these elections, a political message stating explicitly what the act was, a political target in a deeply liberal county; and zero indication of a false flag - but no, we should be airing rather disrespectful conspiracies about it instead until we "really know"? Based on shitty motivated reasoning like "wording doesn't ring true to me"? This is hardly better than what made Trumps current descent into madness so laughable. One should always go with the facts as they're known at any time and rationally update one's beliefs as the evidence shifts. Or if the police is unsuccessful, you'd continue treating this as an unclear mystery in your mind? I think this is merely bias...]
[Yeah. If a police investigation is done and is unsuccessful at finding who committed the crime it's treated as an unclear mystery. Merely ensuring that someone answers for the crime is not what we want, we want to prevent the actual criminals from committing similar crimes. If we can't do that then guessing just puts a potentially innocent person/people in prison while the investigation into the possible real criminal(s) stops. It's not bias, our priorities are just different.]
[it sounds like something some out of touch republicans would come up with]
[It's the "get out of town" part. The idea that other people who don't agree with you should just leave - should be forced out - is much more prevalent on the right than the left. That's what doesn't ring true to me.]
[How many Trump rallies were canceled due to the "tolerant" lefties? And how many did the "Nazi" right-wingers shut down?]
[Stop trying to use racial and ethnic minorities or immigrants as scapegoats while getting buddy-buddy with the white supremacists, and you'll stop getting treated like fascists. Because that behavior is basically the hallmark. People in 2016 are awfully sensitive about making sure that we don't have a repeat of 1930s Germany here. It's really too bad that the Trump alt-right movement is so damn insistent on echoing those ideas.]
[> It's really too bad that the Trump alt-right movement is so damn insistent on echoing those ideas. What ideas in general? America first? Securing our borders? Job creation? Tax relief for American families? Preserving our 2nd amendment? Should I go on? Which of these make us all Nazis, again?]
[I'm not fond of trump but as a white republican who also happens to be German I'm sick of people pulling the "all republicans are racist card". I can't stand when either party generalizes the other. It's a damn shame.]
[I'm not fond of trump but as a white republican who also happens to be German I'm sick of people pulling the "all republicans are racist card". I can't stand when either party generalizes the other. It's a damn shame.]
[> and you'll stop getting treated like fascists. So, Trump supporters are "fascists" yet you're okay with shutting down a peaceful gathering of like-minded people simply because you oppose their political views? How do you sleep at night? Just victim-blame everybody you disagree with? Btw, I'm fine with you calling Trump supporters Nazis/racists/red-necks/whatever. Every time you use it incorrectly the word loses it's power and the meaning is diluted. You obviously seem to run off emotion, because you have no argument, just feelings.]
[Possibly written by non native speakers]
["Literally Hitler"]
[Right? It's not impossible, and it's absolutely unacceptable - again, *literal* terrorism - if true. But it sure sounds more like someone trying to mimic what they think angry Trump-haters would say, to me.]
[I had the same thought, this is kind of reminiscent of the Reichstag fire in 1933. But, like any good conspiracy theory, I doubt there's any evidence to back it up.]
[Even if it turns out to be somebody who didn't actually think Republicans are Nazis, the people who worked there still have a right to feel attacked.]
[I'm a Trump supporter, and came into this sub to see what this subs take on the event was. I'm glad there's level headed people with all sorts of viewpoints in this world.]
[Nah, they try to blame Republicans mad at establishment Reps even though the message written was "get out you nazi republicans".]
[I responded to literally the top comment when I opened the thread. I'm sure there are some people saying that, but it's probably a given that the top comment is the one that most readers agree on.]
[Head over to /r/the_donald to see some other trump supporters react with an unlevel head.]
[I'm there right now. It's a good time. I'll miss it once the election is over regardless of who wins.]
[Same, I am kind of surprised to see the general tone of this thread considering everything that has been said over the last few months here.]
[Purely out of curiosity, how do you reconcile a statement like "I'm glad there's level headed people with all sorts of viewpoints in this world." with Trump's behavior, that's objectively the opposite of "level headed"?]
[If you want to talk about anything specifically, I'd be more than happy to. My general answer is that I disagree with your assertion that he isn't level headed.]
[I'm not sure you're aware of the definition of "level-headed". It generally doesn't include such things as 3am Tweets slandering a woman by claiming she was a pornographic actress. And that's ~~probably~~ one of the more minor examples.]
[Here is Trumps tweet: > Did Crooked Hillary help disgusting (check out sex tape and past) Alicia M become a U.S. citizen so she could use her in the debate? First, saying someone has a sex tape isn't saying that they are a pornographic actress. He was referring to an episode of big brother where she got freaky with a co-contestant. The reason it is relevant is because she was cheating on her husband and doing it on national television, and her husband called everything off when it came out. Not a great character it seems.]
[I'm going to stick to the stated question. Literally nothing about that tweet is level headed. Nothing. The subject, the context, the insinuations, nothing. No level-headed human would produce that sentence, or broadcast that thought.]
[I appreciate your assertions but I disagree. At least make an argument against it instead of just asserting things.]
[There is no argument against it, like there's no argument against the ravings of a madman. You cannot use reason and logic when there's none on the other side. It's like trying to punch fog. For the record, this is not partisan. I am very much against Hillary Clinton. I'm not sure what's wrong with you, or with Trump, but it's extremely disturbing.]
[> like there's no argument against the ravings of a madman. I'm not asking you to argue **against** a mad man. That is impossible because the mad man can not see your logic. I'm asking you to say *how* the things the mad man is saying are mad. For example, I probably can't convince a flat earther that the earth is not flat, but I can still list the evidence showing that the earth isn not flat. The fact that you only give assertions and no arguments for the assertions leads me to believe that you have very emotional anti-Trump feelings which may prevent you from judging things about him objectively.]
[I'd argue that based on the policy positions he's chosen to run on, his apathy towards the current administration and the fact that he's had to defend his campaign against an onslaught of media distortion, that he's actually pretty level headed.]
[Does your definition of "level-headed" include publicly assigning guilt without any evidence or proof? Does it include constantly feeding the media with bizarre comments on Twitter? He isn't defending anything, he's actively participating, perpetuating his madness. This man is not mentally stable -- and objectively nothing close to "level-headed".]
[His definition can be whatever he likes. Just like your post is your opinion. If you don't like it then make sure you go out and vote. You're not changing anyone's mind here.]
[1)Specific: He has already tweeted that Hillary is associated with the fire-bombing with zero evidence. 2) Specific: He, a presidential candidate, told his twitter followers to look at a sex tape in an attempt of character defamation of a woman who he disagrees with. 3) Specific: He has mocked a reporter with a disability 4) Specific: On the Howard Stern show, he boasted about going into the women's dressing rooms uninvited. 5) Specific: On a tour bus, he boasted about committing sexual assault. 6) Specific: When the claim made against him that he hasn't paid taxes, his immediate reciprocated response was "That makes me smart". Edit: numbering]
[Everything you posted(except the last one) is your interpretation of events, and not the events themselves.]
[Ignore all that. I'll interject his tweet instead. https://mobile.twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/787782613633208320]
[Which part of it don't you like? Keep in mind the other side has blamed ridiculous things on Trump. For an example off of the top of my head, Hillary has talked about "Trump inspired bullying" in schools. Is this any different?]
[well, the question was level headedness. Its not a level headed response. Its attack attack attack, the typical go to response in every single case. As usual, hillary provided the level headed response in her message. The follow-up tweet was much better. my interpretation, though you didn't ask for it, is that trump sent the first one and the campaign sent the second.]
[You aren't answering the question. That is redirection. Is Trump's tweet level-headed?]
[For someone whose office was just firebombed - sure.]
[Alllrighty. -cracks fingers- Point 1: [Trump connects Hillary/supporters to firebombing](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/787782613633208320) Fact is, no proof of connection, only assumption. There are, in fact, more parties out there than just Rep/ Dem. Point 2: ["Check out Sex Tape](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/781788223055994880) Saying there's a sex-tape about someone, up to this point, I have not seen referred to as a positive character trait. Point 3: [Trump Mocking The Reporter](http://www.snopes.com/2016/07/28/donald-trump-criticized-for-mocking-disabled-reporter/) Trump immediately tried to claim that he didn't know said reporter, but the reporter had interviewed him multiple times. It's not a stretch when Trump only flails his right arm. Is it interpretation? Sure. I will let you have this one, but it still is an incredibly uncomposed response, non-level headed if you will, nonetheless. Point 4: [Trump talking about being in pageant dressing-rooms](https://soundcloud.com/user-735086019/101g1) "Well, I'll tell you the funniest is that before a show, I'll go backstage and everyone's getting dressed, and everything else, and you know, no men are anywhere, and I'm allowed to go in because I'm the owner of the pageant and therefore I'm inspecting it," Trump said. "You know, I'm inspecting because I want to make sure that everything is good." "You know, the dresses. 'Is everyone okay?' You know, they're standing there with no clothes. 'Is everybody okay?' And you see these incredible looking women, and so, I sort of get away with things like that. But no, I've been very good," he added. Point 5: [Trump boasting about grabbing women by the pussy and just starts kissing women](http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trump-bush-transcript-20161007-snap-htmlstory.html) Just to be clear "just start kissing women" is indicative of an unwanted sexual advance. Seriously, what invokes anyone to just start kissing someone and that's just "Okay"? He specifically was referring to a strange woman who he just "might start kissing" "I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. I just kiss. I don’t even wait." Committing an act like that, without the presence of consent, is simply unjustifiable. He just starts kissing them, he doesn't even wait. Any person, who does that to another person, is a sick bastard. E: content.]
[1) We don't know what Trump/his party knows. Let's call it an educated guess? 2) [CBS news say it](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-curious-case-of-alicia-machado/) > There is no discussion at CNN or The New York Times, for instance, about her post-pageant fame as the fiancée of Phillies outfielder Bobby Abreu, or how he reportedly called it off after a reality show **she was on revealed video of her apparently having sex with a housemate.** 3) Trump has done very similar things with his hands in the past when mocking non-disabled people as well. 4) So what? His inspections take him past women when they are getting dressed. Were you ever into theater? People changing costumes frequently get naked in front of everyone, and sometimes the director is there making sure everything is okay...Not that big of a deal really. 5) Sure, in the most uncharitable light, when it is taken out of context. He clearly states(when boasting about his wealth): "they *let* you do this". Let implies consent. So basically, because he is a billionaire, women throw themselves at him.]
[1) That is a big bat to swing with out any substantiated proof. If you make a claim like that, back it up. 2) It is still a presidential candidate who solicited this, which is incredibly distasteful. Her having a sex tape has *zero* to do with politics, only character defamation in retaliation. 4) Then why does he have to include he is the only one that can? I have actually done theater, and marching band for that matter, but I've never had a director in either context, of any gender, boast about being in the room while people were naked. That's creepy as hell. 5) "Letting it happen" is an immensely controversial and poor defense to rape/ sexual assault. He preempted his statement with " I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. I just kiss. I don’t even wait." and then ends it with "They let you do this". If I were to just start kissing a woman and she cannot respond quick enough out of shock, I can say "she let me do it" because she made no move to respond. That is NOT consent, nor is it a consensual act.]
[Go check out the_donald]

[I'm voting against trump. However just because we disagree doesn't mean we shouldn't be respectful towards each other.]

[This needs to be said more often.]
[Yeah. It's why there's an election. People talk about their plans and people pick. It's the basis of America]
[I'm voting against Trump but I want to make it clear that this is light years away from okay. Not acceptable folks. People are down right losing their minds on both sides.]
[False equivalency. People are *not* losing their minds on *both* sides- give me concrete examples of Hillary supporters doing something that is egregious as chanting "lock her up" or wearing clothing with disgusting slogans.]
[Almost regularly beating up Trump supporters and trying to take off the MAGA hats of these supporters is a good counterargument here. Just because the majority of people aren't batshit crazy doesn't mean there aren't people on both sides that are.]
[Beating up? I would say they were physically threatened, and were defending themselves. Taking off hats? I want proof. Were they provoked?]
[Well you have anti Trump protestors showing up to Trump rallies dressed as the KKK to stir up shit. Or famous actors calling that all Trump supporters must be cleansed from the earth]
[Which candidate would you say is encouraging this behavior in their supporters more?]
[Hillary.]
[Example?]
[You said "more." Neither candidate is explicitly saying "THE OPPOSING CANDIDATE AND HIS SUPPORTERS ARE ***ALL*** FUCKING AWFUL KICK THEIR ASSES" (Closest Trump has said to this is when he said he'd pay for the legal fees for someone to punch the people who were disrupting his rally by throwing tomatoes at him or some such nonsense like that) It's just how polarizing the election has become has motivated people to do some horrible shit. And to be fair Hillary Clinton called Trump, as well as half of his supporters (which is about 1/4ths of the country) irredeemable racist, Islamophobic bigots; so she's put the bullseye on not just Trump himself but his more outspoken supporters, where Trump has more or less just called Clinton a useless, corrupt puppet for the establishment. It's all on the polarizing atmosphere over morals versus principles, but all I can really say without trying to lean my verbiage towards one candidate or the other is I can't WAIT for this shitfest to be over on Nov. 8th of 2020.]
[Are you sure it's not just everyone Vs. a supremely polarizing negative candidate and that candidates increasingly agitated supporters propping up the allegations about the system being rigged against their favor?]
[Is it bad I couldn't tell which candidate you were talking about until the word "propping"? lmao My main concern in that regard is that if the DNC was willing to rig the democratic primary (which I did not participate in as an independent) against Sanders, what would stop them from rigging the general election? Even if it isn't a "coordinated effort", there's plenty of evidence suggesting that several democrats in positions at registration offices aren't above breaking the law to try to get votes for Hillary. http://projectveritas.com/]
[The message deserves a response; we're not stirring up shit, we're just gonna end it. Look for the results coming November 8th, when the majority of the country repudiates the hate. Be sure to send me a 'you were right' message when it happens.]
[Yup, then we can just jail all those hateful people! It will vanish when Hillary wins the election hooray! Thankfully, the presidency has less impact on daily life than local politics. The sea change you're expecting just isn't happening.]
["Jail all those hateful people." Who said that, besides you? No, it won't vanish, and that's part of the problem. His campaign has overturned the rock in this country, and exposed the racism, bigotry, and misogyny that the minority are most vocal about. And you're right: the presidency does have less of an impact on daily life- that's why the down ballot votes are so important, and why DJT is going to cause the GOP major pain long after he's defeated.]
[You want to know what the response was to the guy dressed in KKK garb? A black Trump supporter punched him. There's your response.]
[Be honest with yourself.]
[November 8th results are all the honesty I need. Repudiation by the entire country will be enough]
[oh, Clinton will win. But the ends do not justify the means. She, and her acolytes are actually even worse than Trump. With all the talented folks in the United States of America, with all your power and might - you picked the two. biggest. fucking. boneheads possible. It really is unbelievable.]
[Firebombing Republican offices and vandalizing vehicles during Trump rallies comes to mind.]
[Vandalizing vehicles any time. I can't tell you how many keyed cars I've seen that had Trump stickers. And I will never forget that video of that poor blond lady getting shit thrown at her by large men because she attended a Trump rally. And that video from a couple weeks ago of the lady getting beaten up by a couple of young men because they didn't like the Trump sign in her yard. Just countless other examples of this. The left has been out of control with violence and destruction this go 'round.]
[You know for a fact this was from Democrats? I want to see your proof. I have a feeling it was Trump supporters making the left look bad.]
[I'm not for Hillary or Trump, but you're asking for proof? I hope you asked for proof for all the crap thats come through this subreddit. Proof is severely lacking for almost everything here. Evidence? Sure. Suggestive news articles? Definitely. Proof? Not so much.]
[Appreciate your reply. I just want to focus right now on the firebombing; DJT immediately tweeted that it was Hillary supporters that did it- I think that's reckless, coming from someone who wants to be POTUS. This, along with the extensive list of everything he's done prior, continues to reveal himself to the American public, and why sanity will win out on November 8th in a landslide.]
[We don't have any suspects yet. This could be Clinton supporters or it could be self-inflicted (like the backwards B girl from 2008). Point being - we don't know so we shouldn't start blaming anyone until we have more information.]
[True, but there is a tendency for people to go binary. Camp A good. Camp B bad! This is a dangerous tendency that only serves to divide us. We can all agree that the type of behaviour we are seeing from the Trump side is not acceptable, but lets not pretend that the other side is full of saints. Just a few minutes ago I found out that a couple of black guys got arrested in my neighborhood for threatening four rednecks (I know the guys, it's not a racial generalization) with physical violence because they were wearing Trump t-shirts (and no doubt both sides started to mouth off). I think I'm going to stand by my original comment. >People are down right losing their minds on both sides.]
[Yes, this isn't ok regardless of your support. I am glad Hillary cane out and denounced it quickly.]
[Wait until the fireworks on Nov 9. No pun intended.]
[This is what happens when the rhetoric is dialed up to batshit insane. The consequences aren't always as predictable as one would assume, but they are always bad.]

[No, he'll blame it on the silencing ideology of the Left. It's a patronizing position that they are on the side of justice and they will show you the light of their thoughts with violence.]
[The Republican Party has a long and storied history of [ratfucking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratfucking) Democrats, I'm not going to believe jack shit about this incident one way or the other until someone is caught.]
[For all I know it was some local teenage nihilists that thought it would be funny.]
[We have no idea who did this. It could be a democrat or a trump supporter (after he started his war against the GOP) or some other party that wants the two sides to tear each other apart.]
[Well, what do you expect? This sub has become a joke, sadly.]
[Not as much of a joke as r the donald or r conservative. Where even mild dissent is banned. If you guys werent so triggered by opposing ideas this place wouldnt be such a echo chamber.]
["You guys"? I have never visited r/conservative so I dont know about that one, so ill check it out now. r/the donald is understandably super biased. The thing is that r/politics is morel like a r/hillaryforpresident - then i would have understood the circlejerk around here.]
[Shouldn't you also do the same and not try to pass it off on to the Dems? This world is not so black and white...]
[The volunteer employees actually did it to themselves!]
[Who's been encouraging violence? Not the Democrats.]
[Not the party leadership. Black Lives Matter, on the other hand, I could see someone on the fringes of that doing this. When it comes to this kind of thing, it's not usually the general mainline message you have to worry about. It's how it gets filtered down to the most extreme ends of the fringes. Of course, this is just as true of the right as it is of the left, and if anything Trump himself is an example of one of the milder potential consequences -- after 50+ years of coded dog whistles, the Republicans have a candidate who just goes out and openly says what his predecessors have been hinting at all along, and the party leadership hates it but a huge chunk of the rank and file loves it.]
[I'm not surprised by how many white men hate women. Certainly I've seen enough of that on Reddit to not be surprised. Some of his rallies the journalists take pictures of women but when you pull back you can see it's almost all men. Like the middle east or something.]
[I dont think white men are more likely to be sexist where would you get that idea?]
[Conservative men who have a notion of "a woman's place".]
[Most of Trump supporters are white men and Trump hates women, thinks they shouldn't be allowed to vote.]
[Yeah but the white part is because he said racist shit. If he was just sexist I bet the racial disparity wouldnt be so large.]
[> This is what happens when the rhetoric is dialed up to batshit insane. The consequences aren't always as predictable as one would assume, but they are always bad. No, the consequences are plenty predictable. Nobody cares as long as their side benefits even a little bit from it.]
[Look at this shit: https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/787782613633208320 > Animals representing Hillary Clinton and Dems in North Carolina just firebombed our office in Orange County because we are winning @NCGOP This crazy asshole just blamed it on Clinton. This mothefucker is insane and canoot be anywhere near the WH.]
[He he gets to the WH we're fucked right in our canoot.]
[There's a whole lot of us who are quite tired of the tribalism this election has promoted. The extremes of these goalposts are not in the interest or reality of this nations' condition.]
[I don't think we should give people a pass over "rhetoric" that's pretty subjective isn't it? I mean one persons reasonable can be another persons justification. I think we just need to flat out denounce this type of thing.]
[No fucking shit. Only on /r/politics do we have to put a disclaimer on people attacking republicans. Hurting people isn't okay. *even republicans.*]
[Who here on the Democratic side has ever advocated violence? Even the protests that turned violent some people said "I can understand why immigrants might be upset at Trump and his supporters but we do not endorse this." And the tagging done to the office looks like the work of the same "RON PAUL REVOLUTION" fanatics of years past with the same style of 3 instead of E but this time not backwards. RONPAULR3VOLUTION was popular with the libertarian and conservative types. The tagging on this office with a forward facing 3 looks like it came from the same people. My theory is still false flag to make Trump be a victim and paint the Democratic side as violent, Trump jumped right on to blame Hillary and her supporters right when the news broke.]
[Would've been funny and accurate if they had just spraypainted "nazi republicans" on the side. The firebomb makes it a very serious crime.]
[It's a property damage crime. People weren't hurt, as far as I can tell.]
[They threw a fucking bomb in the window of a building. I couldn't care less about the spray paint. They could have seriously hurt or killed someone.]
[Whoa whoa, it was likely something like a molotov cocktail. Dangerous, but not the same as a bomb.]
[It wasn't a bomb. It was a flammable liquid that was set alight. Look up the definition of "firebomb" why don't you? > They could have seriously hurt or killed someone. In an empty building on a Sunday in a state that shuts down on Sundays?]
[It's not the norm and acting like it is, would be you grinding your own political ax. Stop trying to score points in every margin, at any expense, no matter the tragedy.]
[We're partisans, not monsters. This is offensive to us too.]
[What about those guys that tried to bomb hitler? That was a good thing, right? And I've been hearing for months that trump is just like hitler.]
[Seriously. This sub is a cesspool.]
[What I don't get is this is /r/politics not /r/democrats. What is with all the republican hate?]
[welcome to the tolerant left]
[I guaran-fucking-tee you that if this were an attack on the DNC, in any way, you'd see nothing but, 'Trump caused/causes/is responsible for this.' But, when you see Trump say the same bullshit, they attack him for it like he is a monster. It's that type of idol-worship that allows for a disclaimer to be needed [in their minds]. And, do not forget, we have proof that their are paid, Clinton, commenters here on reddit. Hell, in the past few days I've seen "Vote for Hillary" as the link, headline. When violence is okay, we're all in trouble.]
[We are reaching the point where we're so polarized that when something like this happens then far too many people just say, "Well thats what liberals are like." When those men were arrested in Kansas last week, far too many people ascribed it to a conservative tendency to be violent. We need to stop thinking like that or we are truly in trouble. The vast majority of people on both sides are not violent and are not dangerous.]
[>a conservative tendency to be violent The right shoots and bombs. The left riots and revolts.]
[You say them like they are equal, a few individual nutjobs from the right have been committing crimes, whereas huge movements of thousands of left wingers have been looting, comitting arson, murder and assault for political reasons in the last year alone. When 3 people on one side do something horrific then 30,000 on the other do the same you can't pretend they are equally predisposed to violence.]
[I think if there's anything to this, it's that conservatism puts more value on the individual, relying on everyone genuinely thinking the same way, sharing the same disgusts. The conservative media says "you should think this way, you should think this is disgusting, so *you* should do something about it." The left tends to be collective. The liberal media says "we think this is wrong, and there's people this is hurting, people who need help, so help us support them and protect them. We have to work together to bring about change." In short, the right dehumanizes their enemies directly, and calls upon your disgust for certain behaviors, and too often the people who resemble the mental image of those behaviors. The left dehumanizes their enemies by painting victims to look like puppies, and then pointing to the people kicking those puppies. "Why isn't anyone keeping these puppies from being kicked? Heck, why isn't *everyone* keeping these puppies from being kicked?" Disgust leads to kneejerk reactions, individual emotions. It doesn't need reinforcement. The sort of collective guilt that liberalism projects upon everybody needs at least a little reinforcement, it needs other people to help build actions, movements. "Do you feel this guilt too? Shouldn't everybody feel this guilt? What's wrong with those other people?" Of course this election has done an interesting job of twisting these things. Liberals need a charismatic individual to give the rallying cry, meanwhile conservatives need a competent looking individual who feels all the right disgusts. But Trump took the charisma, the rallying cries, as well as the disgust (though arguably not the competency), and Clinton's...a little charismatic? To some people? But certainly heaping the disgust all over Trump. So who even knows anymore?]
[I generally agree with everything here. There are numerous reasons why the left acts as a collective more than the right, including what you said here.]
[You're full of it. [Silencing Trump: Bill Ayers and the Fire from Below Uncensored](https://youtu.be/LIjljucvBI4)]
[Lol. Tell that to the people in Syria. You know the ones that the US bombed in their support of ISIS. This is your leftist President... by the way they hit exactly what they wanted to hit. http://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/09/18/world/middleeast/us-airstrike-syrian-troops-isis-russia.html]
[Maybe left of batshit crazy but I would definitely call him a centrist. It wasn't long ago where he'd be called a moderate republican. Same with Hillary.]
[I have no idea what I said that pissed of the warriors of r/politics, what I said shouldn't have offended anyone (nor is it wrong). Historically, leftist movements tend to protest more, and by extension is more prone to rioting and eventually revolt. The right on the other hand tend to be more prone to individuals committing terror, like shooting up a black church or bombing an abortion clinic. These are just trends, left wing radicals bomb shit too and the right can start revolutions. Everyone can calm the fuck down.]
[> everyone can calm the fuck down Who are you talking to? The one guy who responded to you?]
[My comment was at -5]
[Oh my god!! Time for a rambling tirade!]
[I wanted to explain myself in case my original comment was being misunderstood. I'm sorry, is there a shortage on comments that we need to conserve?]
[Bill Ayers is a leftist. Omar Mateen (a registered Democrat and Hillary supporter) just massacred 50 gays in a nightclub. Trump supporters are being shot and assaulted in the streets, while BLM is killing cops. The left's hands are anything but clean.]
[Actually his dad was a registered democrat and hillary supporter deranged Trump supporters think this means he was too.]
[Nope. Omar was too.]
[He was [registered as a Dem](http://www.snopes.com/orlando-shooter-was-democrat/) 10 years before the shooting but there is no evidence of him supporting Hillary.]
[Literally a Hillary supporter. http://thefederalist.com/2016/06/21/friend-who-reported-omar-mateen-to-fbi-he-liked-hillary-clinton/]
[According to some guy who may or may not have reason to say that. Uness there is evidence he ever called himself a hillary supporter thats not real evidence.]
[Since he declared his love for ISIS he seemed to have changed his mind since the friend last spoke with him. He was clearly neither a Republican or Democrat. He was a traitor.]
[Point to me where I said the left's hands are clean. I was just stating a generalized fact.]
[By implying that the left merely riots and revolts. The implication being they don't harm people, they just burn shit down.]
[I definitely didn't mean "merely." I'm more afraid of LW terror than RW. It was just a generalization. LW terrorism is traditionally in support of Marxism, anti-capitalism, anti-establishment and/or environmentalism, while RW terror is more often pro-capitalism, white ethnonationalism, and/or religiously motivated. Leftists, globally, are much more likely to organize and protest violently than the right, which usually conducts violent activism underground.]
[>>a conservative tendency to be violent >The right shoots and bombs. The left riots and revolts. How many shootings have far right or conservative movements or actors committed in the last year or two? Because the only shootings I can think of that are politically motivated in the last couple years are Black Lives Matter types assassinating cops and others. The last conservative shooting I can think of is the Phoenix one where that kid shot a congresswoman. Maybe you could count Charleston as one. And then, of course, you have the Muslim terrorist shootings -- theoretically those would actually much closer to Far Right movements -- but they are ironically supported the most by radical Leftists. So that's an odd one to break down. Anyway, seems like in the recent past, the radical Left has been shooting more than the radical Right if anything.]
[The last few years have certainly muddied this. I don't disagree necessarily. Though I do believe the Charleston shooter was a terrorist. It's getting harder to define these ways, because instances like Omar Mateen are more easily described in the same ways that right wing terror is defined vs left wing terror, though Mateen was a Democrat.]
[Have to take a trip in the way back machine, but Timothy McVey was an alt-right poster child. I had family living in OKC at the time of his bombing so he is who immediately who comes to mind whenever either side incites violence.]
[I know about OKC bombing. Just having a hard time really stacking up the far right/conservative shooters of the last decade or two.]
[There was the attack on the Planned Parenthood in Colorado last year. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Springs_Planned_Parenthood_shooting]
[I'm a NC Dem. This is absolutely unacceptable.]
[It's unacceptable that no Trumpies were barbecued to death.]
[[deleted]]
[In this case to say, "despite disagreeing with their views, I believe they didn't deserve this". It's a show of empathy from the other side.]
[Me as well, this type of behavior is deplorable.]
[So is laws against Gays, but it is NC, where homophobia is rampant]
[Not the time for that conversation though.]
[Hopefully those responsible are found soon. ------ Edit: I encourage everyone to "load more comments" and see the Trump supporters anger stemming from this comment.]
[[deleted]]
[Firebombing a place is pretty deplorable]
[Yes. I would certainly place all Hillary supporters who think shit like this is ok in what I like to call a basket of deplorables. I'm not sure whether someone with this much hate in their heart is even redeemable. I hope you can see how it can be reasonable to call hateful assholes deplorable now.]
[Yep]
[Get your fuckin triggered shit to tumblr child]
[Oh please, they deserve the deplorable label full on, no one here is defending the firebombing. Back into the basket with them.]
[lol @ your edit. you're delusional.. bye.]
[Is it really all that hard to say "laughed at your edit," pumpkin pie?]
[idk my bff jill?]
[Ooh consider my jimmies rustled ]
[What are you going to say if this ends up being Trump supporters?]
[Doesn't it seem more likely, at this point, that Trump supporters are probably to blame for this? Clinton is handily winning - her supporters have to reason to be upset.]
[I think you're attributing a lot of thought and strategy to what was clearly a knee-jerk, moronic attack. Plenty of liberals hate trump deeply, and it only takes one unhinged guy]
[Fair enough, that's true - all it takes is one. I don't think I would describe this as "knee-jerk" though - it wasn't a quick reaction to anything new, regardless of who did it, since nothing important (that I know of) has come up in the news today. Like I said though, Clinton is currently doing well in the polls. It doesn't make a lot of sense for any of her supporters to do something like this now. Could be something going on locally in NC that I just don't know about though.]
[True - knee jerk was bad wording. Maybe "spontaneous"? If the actors involved were all rational, thinking people, I would be certain this was a false flag. But considering this asshole firebombed a building, that's proooobably not the case haha]
[And if Trump wins, you deserve everything you get.]
[I hope Hillary rocks the shit out of being president just so people like yourself will say "i guess i was wrong hurr durr"]
[These are the same people who do the mental gymnastics to claim Obama was the worst President of all time. Don't hold your breath.]
[She will, but they won't.]
[You mean a center right administration supportive of some progressive policies?]
[Where do I vote?]
[> I am so disappointed in reddit. Willing to embrace one of the most corrupt politicians in recent history just because they are so easily swayed by identity politics. If she wins, you deserve everything you get. Now, now, let's not be so harsh to Trump supporters. Many of them, I assume, are good people, and they deserve to realize that minorities are not the root of all their problems, under a Clinton presidency.]
[You're pathetic, this is just a psychopath, stop trying to prove an agenda.]
[> If she wins, you deserve everything you get. Think that is the point. Hopefully the deplorables feel marginalized as well.]
[you do realize that three trump supporters were arrested just days ago planning on bombing a mosque right idiot]
[What, then, those who oppose Trump should just ignore all the actual parallels with Hitler?]
[More parallels to Cersei IMHO.]
[The thing is, whenever I hear this I am reminded that Hitler was a much more talented orator.]
[Interesting point. I guess we should be thankful that Trump has trouble expressing coherent thoughts.]
[> Can you imagine if this was Trump supporters firebombing a Hillary HQ? This whole subreddit would be strictly condemning this attack. Just like they are doing right now.]
[I wouldn't jump to conclusions. We have no idea who did this and why.]
[They graffiti'd the next door building calling Trump supporters nazis]
[It could be anyone for any reason. Less likely to be operatives for any campaign. *Bright Idea* idiots who cannot manage their emotions.]
[People are saying it was Ted, "The Unobomber" Cruz and his dad.]
[Wild Draw Four... Never forget.]
[I'll be honest: I first thought this was a false flag. It's possible that democrats did this but FF seems more likely, especially after you see what happens at the Trump rallies: https://youtu.be/R9YPYRaeTW0]
[False flag? Seems more like Trump supporters just turning on the GOP.]
[False flag? Seems more like Trump supporters just turning on the GOP.]
[“Nazi Republicans get out of town or else” doesn't sound like Trump supporters turning on the GOP to me.]
[Well, I'll reserve judgement until they figure out who did it. Seems impossible that the area wouldn't have at least a few cameras around here and there.]
[Good ole victim blaming. Classic.]
[exactly what I was thinking. The swastika and "nazi republicans" seems like an overreach to me and seems to me more the MO of trump supporters as opposed to dems. Also, with polls being what they are....why?]
[It doesn't have to be a typical democrat who did this. It could be any kind of radical leftist, they're uncommon but it only takes a handful.]
[I am going to assume it was some hyped upped left-wing dude. But it doesn't necessarily have to be a false flag if it was a Trump supporter upset with the GOP.]
[I don't know- I really doubt this. For the most part, liberals don't have a reason to be this pissed off right now. And anyone who follows politics closely enough to be this outraged about white nationalism- would also know that the GOP has abandoned Trump and seek out another target. This reeks of a very clumsy false flag.]
["reeks"? Really? You have no evidence of that at all, and it's not like people vote to firebomb something. It takes one crazy ass guy. It's not impossible, of course, but the vast majority of the time people firebomb what they dislike. People who try shitty political violence usually aren't very subtle people]
[It wouldn't surprise me one bit.]

Down to finding out what time of day would have the most of them in there.. I.e. they weren't targeting an empty building in the middle of night, they were targeting civilian families in the day time... intentionally trying to kill women, and children as well, while bragging about they would happily murder BABIES if they got the chance.

[What wonderful legit sources. Got anything from Buzzfeed or Gawker?]
[Holy shit dude. Really?! Try fucking googling it yourself then. This why *no one* wants to have a conversation with Trump supporters. There are screen grabs of the guys FB for christssake!]
[Facts don't matter to the stupidly unteachable.]
[did I read that they were planning to kill everyone they could, including children? They have started down the path to becoming those that they hate.]
[Surely property damage from some weekend vandalism of an empty GOP office is worse "terrorism". /s]
[That's a pretty deplorable thing to do.]
[How dare you use that word!]
[Seriously, everyone. Words can hurt people, so don't go around saying things like that just because large numbers of Trump supporters use intimidation and realized violence as political tools. That's just straight up intolerant. /s]
[This is supposed to be my safe space, /spez told me so!]
[> while comparing their candidate to Hitler. Wait, so the term "Hitlery" hasn't been used in this campaign at all? It's just the "one side"?]
[> Willing to embrace one of the most corrupt politicians in recent history just because they are so easily swayed by identity politics. Jesus Christ, dude. You could have just accepted the sympathy. Can you not at all understand how people find his extreme ignorance on substantive issues, incendiary and insulting rhetoric, and utter disregard for social norms and the dignity of the office turn a lot of voters off? Not to mention *his own* blatant corruption and charity abuse.]
[> own blatant corruption and charity abuse. yeah but that makes him smart... durrrrrr.... :P]
[Armed Trump supporters were standing outside a Dem HQ and intimidating them just yesterday. Please, get you head out of the sand and try to look at things objectively for once in your life. This behavior should not be tolerated, period. Doesn't matter who did it or who was the victim.]
[You're allowed to arm yourself your argument would make sense if they were shooting up the place. US citizens use their right to peacefully protest more news at 8 pm.]
[And you wonder why we call you deplorable....]
[How does one "peacefully" arm themselves?]
[I'm currently armed, but in a peaceful way. I concealed carry. No, I'm not a Trump supporter.]
[OK, that makes some sense to me. But the difference, I think, is that those protesters we are talking about were not conceal carrying. They were open carrying their guns, and in fact one of the workers at the office said the protesters turned to their side to specifically show that they were carrying. http://www.newsplex.com/content/news/Legally-armed-protester-hangs-outside-Dittmar-campaign-offices-for-hours-397039141.html I can't imagine that is meant to be taken any other way except to be intimidating, which is not peaceful in my book.]
[Oh, of that I have no doubt.i was just commenting on the carrying peacefully thing. I'm sure they were going for the intimidation factor.]
[LOL the intellectual dishonesty here is astounding. "There's nothing wrong with looming around political headquarters with visible weapons. Everything they're doing is technically legal and therefore not bad at all. In fact, they're commendable heroes if anything." Get your head out of Trump's ass.]
[Well I'm a Bernie supporter so...]
[And frankly a pretty shit one.]
[Obviously those who believe in the constitution, how dare they!]
[People who think that "I CAN do something, technically, so that means it's totally OK if I do it and anyone who thinks otherwise is just an idiot!!" are fucking scary. If you don't see something wrong with Trump supporters standing around outside a Democrat HQ while brandishing guns, I don't think there's a place for you in a civilized society.]
[Somehow I don't think you would feel the same way, say, if armed African Americans or (gasp) Muslims were looming outside of Republican headquarters.]
[Sure I would. I support the 2nd ammendment and am a die hard Bernie supporter]
[That would make for an interesting protest.]
[On one side, we have people expressing their right to open carry and protest. On the other side, we have people bombing buildings and doing ACTUAL DAMAGE. Don't even pretend it's comparable, you're being completely intellectually dishonest to do so.]
[There isn't a shred of proof that it was Hillary supporters.]
[I love my guns, and defend people having them. But the minute you view them as anything other than *weapons* meant to destroy or kill what you point them at, you've lost my respect. Open carrying rifles around your political opponents? That's not "peaceful." And it's certainly not for them to "defend themselves." They're using weapons to send a message. And while I am very pro-2A and dread more legislation, I don't agree that showing up strapped for a riot is right. Is it on the same level as firebombing? Nope. But don't pretend it's morally perfect, either.]
[Just out of curiosity, what type of legislation do you dread? I've never heard of any legislation that seeks to remove people's right to own firearms. Most of it seems pretty common sense stuff to me like background checks etc. I'm not from America and didn't grow up in a gun culture so don't fully understand the mindset of it but I would generally expect responsible gun owners to be in favour of some of the legislation proposed. Not trying to start a whole argument, just curious of the mistrust of any attempts at gun control. Is it seen as the start of a slippery slope towards repealing the 2nd amendment?]
[Forget it, us gun culture is inexplicable from our perspective]
[Or the Trump supporters who got caught planning an attack against a Somali refugee center? No side can claim a moral high ground there.]
[Those aren't the only two incidents in this election. How about when some Trump thug decided to punch a peaceful protesters in the face. Or how 3 Trump voters were caught yesterday trying to blow up a building.]
[Trump supporters are violently attacked FAR MORE than anyone else this election, just look at what happened in San Jose. As for the maniacs who tried to blow up a building, the fact that they supported Trump is irrelevant, as they said they wanted to start a holy war. I don't even know why I try to discuss things on this sub anymore, no one even tries to argue in good faith anymore.]
[The victim complex gets very tiring.]
[So do the endless lies, false equivalents, and intellectual dishonesty.]
[Then why do you keep perpetuating all those things?]
[You're supporting the worst damn candidate in our history. He's a lying, cheating, sexual predator who has no respect for the constitution or democratic principals. He isn't Romney, McCain, Bush, Reagan or any of the others. It's not just disagreement with him - he's dangerous. He's dangerous and unhinged. This isn't just another election. I get that his supporters are angry at the status quo, but fuck dude, how can you not see him for what he is?]
[I know, that's why I can't wait for Trump to get crushed this November so him and his lies, false equivalencies, and intellectual dishonesty get buried.]
[What is your argument? It's terrible to bomb someone regardless of their affiliation. I don't see how calling people who are proud racists and xenophobes somehow condones bombing someone. But the truth of the matter is the hatred in this campaign has come from one side specifically, and that is not a topic of debate. If people react to that hatred violently, then that's fucking terrible, nobody is reacting otherwise.]
[Well, vandalizing an empty party office versus armed people intimidating people actually present another party office. Sounds like the Trump supporters were the animals.]
[When will the Republicans have the courage to call them what they are: Radical Christian Thugs.]
[Threatening people by menancing around their political office with guns is okay and just planning to blow up Muslim families is fine because it was stopped. /s]
[It's sad how necessary that "/s" is sometimes.]
[Make Political Violence Great Again!]
[They were going to bomb it sarcastically, so it's fine.]
[How sarcastically?]
[All of them.]
[Well, not that sarcastically.]
[Hey, none of that rises to the level of vandalizing an empty Republican party office! Property damage is the important damage. We can always make more people. /s]
[Please don't jump to conclusions here. There is no information on who did this or why]
[People here were happy to jump to conclusions about the planned terror attack against refugees. Comments betting they were Trump supporters and saying it was a result of his views on Muslims were upvoted across the board. Edit: I'm not from the States or a fan of the orange idiot. I'm just pointing out your biases are showing again.]
[So two wrongs make a right for you? Grow up]
[What? I'm the one saying there are two wrongs. People seem to think it's ok to jump to conclusions when it means something negative for Trump.]
[They were trump supporters.]
[I assumed but nobody knew at the time. People assumed Racists = Trump Supporters. But now it's bad to assume Anti Republican = Hillary Supporter.]
[It was on their Facebook. And do you seriously think an extreme right wing militant group would be voting for Jill or Hillary?]
[But the news broke when the dudes were caught. We know nothing about these bombers.]
[It wasn't known that they were Trump supporters. People just assumed.]
[> It wasn't known that they were Trump supporters white dude with Trump Pence sign and protesting because according to one of protester > I’m just trying to provide a voice for someone who might be a closet supporter of Trump while in this firebombing we know nothing yet]
[Horseshit. Their motivations and political affiliations were part of the news story, no assumption required. IIRC at least one of them posted their support for Trump on Facebook.]
[It's not assumed, it's been documented that at least one of them has shown trump support online.]
[They captured a couple of white xenophobes. Who else would they vote for?]
[Hitler?]
[Too foreign]
[Their Trump-loving Facebook posts were a part of the breaking story.]
[And yet you don't see a single liberal here defending the actions. If it was a Hillary hq the response would be no different.]
[I'm sure if it was an empty Hillary office that was vandalized on a Sunday when no one was in the building, the liberals wouldn't be pretending it amounted to "terrorism" or that the kids who likely did this were "animals".]
[You're right. This is no big deal at all. Now where's them Trump tapes?!?!]
[You should've seen the thread where the guy was getting his ass kicked by a mob INSIDE a Clinton rally. Edit: Nevermind. Just checked the other thread and many top level comments are saying it was a false flag by the republicans and extremists in the party. Nice. Alot of people are correct though, this isn't something to take lightly as this is something that could escalate both sides.]
[Literally the comment above you is saying a Trump supporter did it to frame Hillary supporters. And someone guilded the comment. You're an idiot.]
[> Literally the comment above you is saying a Trump supporter did it to frame Hillary supporters No. The comment said it **could** be a Trump supporter, as there is a lot of anger at the Repub establishment from Trump supporters. No one is making any claims of knowing who did this.]
[>And yet you don't see a single liberal here defending the actions Saying it's a right wing loon or a left wing loon isn't defending anyone's actions.]
[I haven't seen it on the news once except on a short clip on Fox. Yes, the public response would be *completely* different. We STILL see the video from January of Trump supporters pushing protestors out of a rally. I can't even imagine the response if a Dem HQ was bombed.]
[> And yet you don't see a single liberal here defending the actions. Exactly. I'm very liberal. I don't give a rats ass which side of the political spectrum these terrorists are on or who they think they're supporting. They are terrorists and I hope they are held accountable to the full extent of the law. (edit: typo. Darn you, autocorrect! It changed "extent" to "extend")]
[I've been saying for years that the only thing that will change politics in this country is another civil war. While I don't *hope* that it comes, due to the blood loss and warfare that would be horrifying, it's the only thing I think would bring about lasting change.]
[I believe we are a better nation than that. The right (especially people like Bill O'Reilly) toss around words like Civil War as if they're talking about a filibuster or something. That sort of talk is ignorant and dangerous. A civil war could last decades and lead to the end of the United States as we know it.]
[Well, I'm from the American left (I specify 'American' because I'm pretty sure American right-wing and leftist politics are pretty different from how the rest of the globe defines those terms). I've never watched a single episode of Bill O'Reilly's show. Every soundbite I hear from him makes me not want to. I'm not getting my thoughts from him. There are obviously a great many people in this country that still genuinely believe that Obama is the anti-Christ, that climate change is a liberal hoax, and that anyone that disagrees with them is either part of the establishment or has been manipulated by the 'liberal media'. Trump's nomination is representative of this. Until you significantly reform the public education system, campaign finance laws, and the American news media, I'm not seeing a way out of the country's current downward spiral of ignorance and polarization that doesn't end in bloodshed.]
[> lasting change. do you really think it would last? You're literally saying that the country should be divided and the last man standing gets to decide how things are run. even if it did happen the change wouldn't last. democracy is built on a difference of opinion without violence.]
[>democracy is built on a difference of opinion without violence. Right, of course, but education is no longer a priority in this country, and until Citizens United gets overturned and we have serious reform of the news media and campaign finance, things are going to become less like a Republic or a Democracy and more like an Oligarchy. In the event that Citizens United does not get overturned, I don't see how this country will ever change without violence. There are hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people in this country that are completely, head-on-backwards ignorant about some of the most basic issues. All one politician has to do is repeat a lie. Elections are decided based on emotional response, not critical thinking. If you can't get one of America's two biggest political parties to even admit that climate change is a threat to national security, nevermind the entire globe, then how do you reckon politics can be reconciled with words, at this point?]
[> education is no longer a priority in this country Two things need to change if America truly wants to become great again. Better education and the removal of religious education. 40% of Americans think Angels are real. That's some seriously high levels of Christianity. Now Religion isn't inherently bad, but when you're sacrificing education for religion you've got a big problem. I saw something the other week that boiled down to this; American school kids were in the bottom 60% of Math scores around the world, but they believed they were in the top 1%. The USA has one thing that is does really really well and that's think its #1. And sadly, that's not the case anymore.]
[They aren't defending the actions. They just imply that it's Trump's fault whether it be because of a false flag attack or by blaming him for his rhetoric.]
[> They just imply that it's Trump's fault whether it be because of a false flag attack or by blaming him for his rhetoric. Not exactly. It is the terrorists' fault. Period. But it's important to understand the effects hateful and incendiary rhetoric can have. It's sort of like how a tidal wave is the action that kills people on the coast, but the tidal wave was caused by an earthquake. If we don't learn about earthquakes, we don't learn how to minimize the death toll of a tidal wave. Terrorists firebombed a GOP office. The terrorists are to blame. They should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. But hateful and incendiary rhetoric is irresponsible and it leads to violence.]
[I personally hope whoever did it is found and prosecuted to the full extent of the lawn]
[His ass is grass?]
[We need to weed them out!]
[Kick them all the way to the curb.]
[>prosecuted to the full extent of the lawn Mow 'em down, I say.]
[You gotta nip this stuff in the bud.]
[Weed 'em out.]
[Give 'em the whole nine yards.]
[[deleted]]
[Don't see him firebombing anybody, lmao]
[What is that edit?]
[You should check out their sub on this. A whole different type of conversation (being generous calling it that) going on there.]
[Thank you for the edit and letting me know about this.]
[I clicked load more comments and only one conment by one Trump p supporter is in the reply saying that it's wrong to demonize Trump supporters What's wrong with that?]
[Agreed.]
[That should go without saying]
[Unfortunately this is /r/politics, where a comment trying blame this on Trump supporters with the logic "I saw someone on /r/the_donald saying violence is good" now has 3x gold. It's not a given in here.]
[Agreed. This is awful.]
[[deleted]]
[Oh sure Trumps heated rhetoric contributed nothing to this: http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/10/14/498013572/three-men-charged-with-plotting-attack-on-somali-immigrants-in-kansas]
[This is what happens when you demonize one side and constantly call them Hitler. You end up with people that hold absolutely certain that Trump supporters are all evil monsters that must be violently confronted. This is nothing even surprising at this point, just look at how gangs went to Trump rallies to violently attack Trump supporters, they even shut down the Chicago rally.]
[OK. First of all, there's no evidence at this point this was a nuts Democrat. It could just as easily be a nuts Trump supporter who is mad at the Republican "establishment". Second of all, before you go pointing fingers think about who is the candidate using violent rhetoric, encouraging a toxic atmosphere at his rally so that protestors are punched. Look at these guys on the republican "side" before you make these accusations. http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/10/14/498013572/three-men-charged-with-plotting-attack-on-somali-immigrants-in-kansas]
[Ah, good old Nietzsche... **"He who fights with monsters should look to it that he himself does not become a monster."** After debunking weeks of conspiracy mongering from the other side, I'm utterly ashamed that my first thought was "false flag". Whoever did this should be exposed and denounced. It's domestic terrorism, plain and simple.]
[It isn't your fault, Trump and his supporters are the type that would do this kind of thing. Just look at Kansas...]
[> I'm utterly ashamed that my first thought was "false flag" "False flag" was my first thought too, and I'm not ashamed. It wouldn't surprise me one bit. There are some very twisted Trump supporters out there.]
[You're disgusting.]
[The worst part of something bad is that it sometimes makes it's victims more like itself. Magneto is the best fictional example.]
[It's because it makes more sense that way. Trump is losing in every poll and his supporters have repeatedly stated their willingness for violence so of course 'false flag' would be many peoples first thought.]
[It's also a perfectly plausible scenario.]
[> After debunking weeks of conspiracy mongering from the other side, I'm utterly ashamed that my first thought was "false flag". I am not. I remember the woman that claimed to have been attacked by an Obama supporter in '08 and it turned out she did it to her self. Now, knowing the area, it is sadly quite believable that some UNC students got themselves into a frenzy of stupidity and jumped the line from protests to terrorism but if you brought proof in three days that this was a GOP job I wouldn't be surprised, just saddened.]
[I feels like with this election we've turned a corner, and now domestic terrorism will be our next concern in addition to terrorism from abroad.]
[The actual quote is "He who claims to fight monsters...."]
[One of the first or second thoughts I had was that this could be a false flag. After reading the article, nothing there makes that possibility less likely. Nobody got physically hurt. Whoever did it, regardless of party affiliation or motive, should be caught and prosecuted. On the surface it would look like Dems, but that it was done by Trump supporters/campaign is definitely a possibility. All along Trump has behaved like the Pig named Napoleon in George Orwell's Animal Farm.]
[My feeling is it could be a false flag as well. It happens and who is the first to blame...the left. Who has the message that it serves the most...the right. It could easily be either side but the rush to judgment will be that this was an attack by the left without evidence. As a society, we need to brush up on evidence proving guilt before rushing to judgment. *edit for clarity*]
[It could be a false flag because Trump is trailing Clinton there. Incumbent Gov. McCrory is also trailing the Dem. challenger. I feel like this could be a Reichstag fire attempt.]
[Or garden variety insurance fraud. If you had a commercial building you wanted to stop paying premiums on, it'd be cheap to lend it to a controversial organization, let them put up signs, and then pretend that the political opponents were the ones with the gas cans and lit matches. You wouldn't even have to worry that the investigators would detect the accelerants.]
[Wow, I can't believe the crazy conspiracy theories Hillary supporters are floating. Truly deplorable.]
[It's not certain who did it. It's a politically motivated attack. The attacker could have been either pro-Clinton or pro-Trump. That's not a conspiracy theory, it's just stating the obvious possible perpetrators.]
[Can you imagine the contempt a comment like this would be treated with if it was a Democrat building?]
[Yeah the false flag people just need to like, shut the fuck up. It's pretty unlikely and also extremely inappropriate in the wake of a terrorist attack. That said, we really do have no idea who could be behind it, so I appreciate Hillary not lunging straight to the blame in her tweet. It could be a Hillary supporter, a Bernie or Jill supporter, a disaffected republican or hell even a Libertarian. We have no idea and everyone should STFU until we know who did it.]
[> I'm utterly ashamed that my first thought was "false flag". Same. Once you hear the talks of "cataclysmic events being needed for change", shit like that, it's shit like that...]
[Let's ignore this event. I ask you in good faith: Who do you feel has committed more violence this election cycle? 1. Trump supporters 2. Anti-Trump protesters]
[Anti-trump protesters and it's not close]
[I'd say Trump's rhetoric hinted and winked about violence the most. The left committed the most violence this year. I think people think hate crimes and beating up people is okay if they're told they're on the right side of history. If the media turned a blind eye to violence at Trump rallies it probably would have gone the other way. My take away is that we had this big campaign about being progressive and to stop bullying. The end result has been a hierarchy on who's allowed to bully who and what situation being a bigot is allowed. We can't make exceptions for this behavior period. The second one side gets a pass, the other side gets emboldened. Then it escalates until God knows what.]
[I've heard of actual violence from Trump supporters. Prior to this event, what violence had there been from the left?]
[[I'm not a supporter, but i wouldnt feel safe in a lot of places in the US if i was one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF_eGq6KKUs)]
[Not that it matters that much - if you're not a supporter, why actively post in /r/The_Donald?]
[>I've heard of actual violence from Trump supporters. Prior to this event, what violence had there been from the left? Holy shit, it is terrifying that your impression of reality is actually the opposite of what's really been happening. I'm not a trump supporter, I'm not voting for either candidate. I'm a hardcore punk hippie vegan environmentalist, so both candidates suck for me as someone who acknowledges the reality of climate change and thinks that it's the most important thing we need to deal with. But it is terrifying that you know about the minor incidents of Trump supporters doing bad things but don't have the slightest clue about the *much more violent* things Hillary people and general anti-Trump people have done to Trump supporters. Trump supporters have been chased down by gangs of dozens of people and jumped. They've been cornered by hundreds of people and had rotten food thrown as hard as they could at their faces. Trump supporters have been mobbed by dozens of people and hit in the head with bricks, bottles, and other weapons. It's not even close when comparing the amount and severity of violence that Trump supporters have faced versus Hillary supporters -- and it is scary and astounding you had the completely opposite narrative in your head.]
[Thank you for speaking the Truth]
[Links?would like to read up on this, thanks.]
[I believe this was one single event where criminals did criminal shit to people and it is somehow an equal footing to the other candidate advocating violence. There is a huge difference there.]
[It must be nice to just "believe" things without taking the five seconds on Google it would take to learn that reality is otherwise.]
[More than one event of violence against Trump supporters. Just google "Trump supporter attacked".]
[Here's just one link to the violence around the San Jose Trump rally: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/06/03/ugly-bloody-scenes-in-san-jose-as-protesters-attack-trump-supporters-outside-rally/ One for a woman in California being beat by two teenagers for trying to stop them from stealing her Trump sign: http://www.theamericanmirror.com/video-california-woman-beaten-trump-yard-sign/. Those are just two off the top of my head. I googled and just found the first links I could with video, so feel free to do your own research more in depth.]
[I mean, I'm happy to go search YouTube and Google for "trump supporter attacked", if you can't. Give me a minute... Edit: [Trump supporter attacked and beaten in El Cajon](https://youtu.be/uGRFEiLBZCE) [compilation of some violence from anti-trump people](https://youtu.be/EMux_UHmpvc) -- you'll ironically see some people who are actually in support of Bernie or Hillary being attacked by anti-trump mobs who mistook them for trump supporters. In this compilation you'll see one guy get his mouth bloodied before he can explain to the mob that he's for Bernie, and then they back off and he goes back to shouting about hating trump. [Here's another compilation](https://youtu.be/ywDvXmeVfoE) -- this one has some repeats from the last one, but still plenty of fresh clips. It opens with one of the people who was cornered by a mob and assaulted with rotten food, but it doesn't even show all the food they throw at her head. In the very next clip, there are rocks or a brick in the bag that he hits the guy in the back of the head with -- the guy is lucky it just glanced him, but it still opens a bleeding wound on the back of his head. If 100+ middle aged White men had cornered a female Hillary supporter and thrown rotten food and eggs at her head as hard as they could while waving American flags in her face and intimidating her and screaming horrendous things inches from her face -- how do you think that would have been covered and propagated by the mainstream media?]
[The other person is probably talking about "antifa," or anti-fascism. After the rise of Hitler et al, European leftists decided that a hard line needed to be taken against fascism and that it could never again be given a platform. Translated very loosely: beat the shit out of fascists. At some point, antifa philosophy came over to the U.S. and here we are. My feelings on them are mixed: on the one hand they very clearly do not have a "graceful failure mode"*, but on the other hand I would be surprised if they did not become important at some point. *To have a "graceful failure mode" means that your ideology won't end up doing lots of harm if it turns out to be targeted against the wrong people, more or less. For example, "it's okay to assault people whose ideas are a threat to the country" may sound like a good idea when it's coming someone who means "beat up Hitler" but not when it's coming from someone who means "beat up gay people."]
[I would be shocked if the people I've seen in videos jumping Trump supporters even know how to spell the word "fascist".]
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF_eGq6KKUs]
[What? Have you not seen the violence from protestors in California and Chicago? Or the riots in Charlotte in Milwaukee?]
[Would BLM be considered part of "the left"?]
[I hate the term "the left" In San Jose an angry mob attacked Trump supporters. The local government did almost nothing in response, iirc the mayor mocked the victims. The attackers were largely Latino, based on clothing they didn't appear to be Latino American.]
[Some of "the left" might not even be on the left if the right weren't racist, bigoted, sexist, and phobic of everything in general. They create their own enemies.]
[Way to generalize. You know, the same shit the left allegedly hates. Some of you are ridiculous hypocrites.]
[How can I generalize when these are some of the biggest themes of this election? If you aren't like that, don't support it.]
[So they deserve it?]
[Sorry, that's not what I meant. I was responding to the part about hating the term "the left," not about the attack they mentioned. I meant the party/right in general has fewer friends than they might otherwise have due to their intolerance. Though it's definitely not a surprise that minorities might feel threatened enough to retaliate against what they're hearing regarding their/our futures.]
[There's been a few people knocked around at Trump rallies of course. But plenty of pictures of people who have been jumped for having a trump hat. Women getting spit on, etc. Lots of keyed cars for Trump stickers. Stealing and vandalizing Trump signs. I think within the last week there was a video of a couple of guys hitting a person on their lawn before running back to their car with their trump sign. The media played the shit out of the Trump ones and just ignored the rest of the stuff. That's kind of why I'm scared no matter who wins.]
[“Nazi Republicans leave town or else” False flag indeed. *Leave town or else*? Who the Hell talks like that? I think Trumpsters are getting desperate enough to do anything to change the media conversation. Reminds me of the 2008 election when people were making up stories of being attacked by black Obama supporters. Edit: fixed quote.]
[Same thing has been happening on both sides. Trump protestors have been repeatedly violent. http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/06/03/pictures-insane-moments-san-joses-anti-trump-riot/]
[I know that, but the spray paint message isn't believable.]
[Jesus fucking christ, a domestic terrorism attack happens on republican HQ and your blaming trump, holy shit.]
["...OR ELSE." What is this, an episode of Scooby-Doo? Into the Mystery Machine, gang!]
[If someone is firebombing a place I don't expect them to be rational.]
[Fair enough, I hope they catch the asshole(s) and then we'll see.]
[My point is this- false flag, real attack, teens who thought it was funny, schizo who doesn't know where he is, whatever, it was done by someone who isn't in a reasonable state of mind and therefore isn't representative of the great bulk of totally normal Americans who happen to fall on one side of a political spectrum. There were right-wing terrorists the other day, too, I don't blame Mitt Romney. Psycho's gonna psycho.]
[>There were right-wing terrorists the other day Indeed, and the narrative was that Trump created the environment that caused them to plan their attack. Not that they were just nutjobs which didn't reflect on conservatives as a whole.]
[Yeah well assholes gonna asshole. Only one *candidate* blamed the other.]
[It's been a major part of the rhetoric of the Clinton campaign and her supporters, she even brought it up in the last debate. I was expecting you to counter with something about how Trump *is* creating an environment that breeds violence and Hillary is justified in what she says about Trump. Interesting direction you took in either being wildly misinformed or just plain lying.]
[No need to get hostile, wouldn't want you to fall victim to that violent atmosphere Trump creates, I know how fragile your trumpist temper can be. See? I can be patronizing and navel-gazey too. There was violence at Trump rallies and it did come up. Hillary never accused terrorists of representing 'lil Donnie, which he just did today. Leagues of difference there.]
[Ever read "The Grand Chessboard" or the Project For a New American Century paper?]
[You mean like: >"Further, the process of transformation, even if it brings revolunionary change, is likely to be a long one, absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event -- like a new Pearl Harbor." I'm from the area and am really troubled by what happened. Orange County probably has the largest most active concentration of Democrats in the NC but, other than the occasional sign vandalism and a few shouting matches, had fairly good relations between the Parties. This is well beyond "normal".]
[I'm pissed, and I'm voting Dem this year. This is absolutely abhorrent and everyone who tries to justify it should be getting the smackdown. This behavior does not belong in our society.]
[It's almost disorienting hearing about how some leftists will say it's deserved because of "what Trump has said". Anyone who can rationalize an attack like this needs to be behind bars.]
[How "some leftists" *will* say that? Have you been seeing that sentiment, or are you speculating?]
[I'm left of center and I had an [argument](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/57the0/local_gop_office_in_north_carolina_firebombed/d8usb2l) earlier with someone who was.]
[I all ready am getting comments replying to the one you did claiming it's a "natural consequence" of what Trump says. This is not speculation, I'm also seeing it from friends on Facebook (as horrible of a source that is). This defense of rationalizing terrorism that so many are able to do is ACTUALLY scaring me quite a bit.]
[Well, I apologize for assuming the worst about where you were coming from.]
[We don't know who did this. There's no reason to assume it was "leftists" at this point.]
[In this thread (so far) I haven't seen anyone say this was deserved for what Trump said. I've seen that this is explained by what he has said, but am explanation isn't the same as an excuse.]
[Welcome to how we "leftists" have felt since 2001. The rhetoric has literally been we're traitorous and actively and willfully destroying the country for disagreeing on the path forward for our country. Hopefully we all can look back on all of this and agree it's a terrible way to go about politics.]
[Violence against Trump supporters and justification of it from the left has been going on for over a year. Thousands of acts of violence. HuffPost published "a violent reaction to trump is as rational as any". edit: sorry, "as logical as any".]
[We can't allow violence from intimidating voters. People are being attacked for wearing trump hats, cars being vandalized for having Trump stickers, having multiple trump signs stolen, even that poor women who was hospitalized because Hispanic males were driving around stealing trunk signs, she confronted them in her own yard and they proceed to assault her then post it online as a joke. I'm sure some of you have seen this video. We need to repeat fully disagree with eachother because eits OK to speak and think different in America]
[and the trump supporters who beat people almost to death while cheered on by trump himself?]
[quite the opposite is going on, my friend. QUITE the opposite.]
[that's not what thousands of trump rally vids on youtube show "my friend"]
[I do not condone violence or acts of this nature. However, the rhetoric that gets spewed by Trump is creating this monstrosity. The tweets are proof enough that one side does not rush to judgment and extends sympathy while the other uses it to serve their twisted and vitriolic message. This goes so far beyond reason. Either way, Trump has started something and I have genuine fear of what will happen come Nov. 9th. I live in the South. Yes, I am very afraid.]
[That is pretty ironic what you just said.]
[I couldn't disagree with you more...]
[Do you mean to throw the people in jail who bombed it or people just vocalizing hateful words for it?]
[Are you hearing people actually say that? Because whole I don't doubt that fringe people sweety some shitty things, hearing that people "will" say something is odd phrasing.]
["Will" is VERY bad phrasing on my part, because I have about 20 replies to my comment all ready that are saying Trump completely caused this attack with what he said and that he simply shouldn't have spoke against what they like. I saw comments claiming the same on Facebook from friends before I made my original comment with the "will" wording.]
[All of the media then bc they will just brush this off]
[>Anyone who can rationalize an attack like this needs to be behind bars. inb4 but the left are supposed to be the thought police.]
[Well when you look at the way the media has been representing Trump and his supporters it's really no surprise that the extremists are coming from the far left.]
[> It's almost disorienting hearing about how some leftists will say it's deserved because of "what Trump has said" Cite the source. Who is saying this is deserved? This is terrorism. Period. It may have been inspired by the hate and sheer madness being spewed by Donald Trump, and that is an important topic to discuss, but even if that is the case, it doesn't make terrorism any less wrong or any less treasonous. At attack on a Republican party campaign office is an attack on the entire democratic institution. A vote is your voice. A bomb is terrorism and terrorism by Americans against Americans is treason.]
[People were replying to my comments even here saying it's completely ok to say it's deserved. It's pretty bad. And absolutely, that was my point from the begenning. No matter the cause, this is terrorism and we should hold a zero tolerance policy towards it. It is an attack on all of us. There is no room for people going "well if you don't speak the right words this will just happen *shrug*" like they are.]
[> People were replying to my comments even here saying it's completely ok to say it's deserved. People? Who? Call them out. Post links. Don't just look the other way. Cite the source. For example: u/ACleanMind said this "[this is a resistance movement against a fascist takeover](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/57the0/local_gop_office_in_north_carolina_firebombed/d8utyo8)" and I called him out for it because that kind of talk is unquestionably wrong.]
[Absolutely, I'm not familiar with reddit formatting so sorry for the make-shift formatting. 037_Engineering said ["Uh, Did you know that George Washington was a "terrorist"? Martin Luther King Jr. would have been deemed a terrorist today. Every union worker that ever went on strike was a terrorist. It has a place."](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/57t3b1/republican_hq_in_orange_county_firebombed/d8v0tin) Wonderful_wonton said here in response to "People are allowed to think what they want, no matter how stupid." with ["Like the stupid things being said in this post where people are trying to pretend some weekend vandalism of an empty office is "terrorism"?"](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/57t3b1/republican_hq_in_orange_county_firebombed/d8v0t16) And then, when people highlight what happened is literally terrorism by definition, he says ["Vandalism isn't violence and intimidation. I suppose you can read "or else" as a threat. But the things Trump says in his rallies are far more dangerous and directly threatening."](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/57t3b1/republican_hq_in_orange_county_firebombed/d8v2f8p) I don't have the time to go through all comments, this was from a quick skim alone. Scary stuff.]
[To link to a specific user, add u/ before their username. Otherwise, your formatting is great. Cheers!]
["Some leftists" are the extreme minority.]
[You're a dangerous person. Throwing people in prison for opinions...]
[I apologize for the bad phrasing, but my statement "should be put in jail" meant to reiterate the point that there is absolutely no room for defending terrorism in any way in our society. We should have a zero tolerance policy to this one concept, regardless of how well zero tolerance policies work for more mundane things (They usually don't). Terrorism like this has no place in our society and SHOULDN'T be defended, regardless of one's rights of free thought.]
[Is anyone really saying that?]
[Yep! You aren't the only doubter so I made [a compilation of comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/57t3b1/republican_hq_in_orange_county_firebombed/d8v6zy3) I got in response. People are defending terrorism right now because they don't like Trump.]
[Yeah, those two people are jerks]
[No way I'll be down for putting people in prison for some radical beliefs they may have. So no.]
[Not all republicans support trump]
[What does that have to do with defending terrorism? The attack was on us all, regardless of dem or rep, regardless of liberal or conservative. Whoever did it should be tried for terrorism, regardless of their agenda or affiliation.]
[Its not. I was just confirming that whoever did this is an idiot]
[> Anyone who can rationalize an attack like this needs to be behind bars Very dangerous line of thinking. What about people who say we should bomb some country every time there is a terrorist attack? Sure, they're stupid but it's very different to actually doing it.]
[Absolutely, I more mispoke. I did not mean to incite these debates about whether people should be jailed for thought- I meant to reiterate the point that there is absolutely no room for defending terrorism. It has no place in our society and shouldn't even be given a thought, and those who do defend it- or even can- you understand how that IS a pretty big problem by itself, regardless of rights?]
[Yes, they should be allowed to voice their opinions. But the rest of us should be allowed to point them out as the crazy fringe they are.]
[Agreed, except for this one concept. I don't like thinking of where the line is drawn because unprovoked murder and rape are both horrendous things to have a supporting opinion of but there should be zero tolerance for terrorism alone.]
[I think one has to differentiate between "justify/rationalize" and "explain". The violent rhetoric has been dialed up to 11 in this election and likely was a contributing factor in this. Doesn't mean it's okay, doesn't mean it is justified, doesn't mean whoever did this is not a scumbag. Just means: "I'm shocked, but not surprised".]
[Woodhouse also mentioned the graffiti that said “Nazi Republicans leave town or else.” “Or else what? That is what we all wonder, or else what,” he said. “Because we’re not going anywhere.” THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE STATE GOP JUST SAID THAT]
[No, rationalizing should not lead to imprisonment. People are allowed to think what they want, no matter how stupid.]
[Couldn't be more wrong.. Try rationalizing the assassination of the President. That's a felony. People can think what they want, but you aren't allowed to threaten or justify other criminal activity in every instance. In this instance, no , it's not a crime. But try saying you will rob a bank, or kill someone, incite a riot... that's jail time.]
[> Try rationalizing the assassination of the President. That's a felony. I'm not convinced you know what you're saying. Thinking something and doing something are two completely separate things, believe it or not.]
[It's no longer thinking when you put it in writing...this was reffering to comments on social media....that is considered speech. It's terrifying how much knowledge someone can lack while still retaining confidence. Be smarter please.]
[lol you called rationalizing an assassination a felony]
[Because it is . Holy fucking balls are you seriously that dumb... if you say vocally or in writing that you think it's ok and have a good enough reason (for you) to kill the Pres,thats a felony... that is a threat..]
[Socrates for Prison 2016, All Hail the Opinion Police.]
[People are allowed to think what they want of course, but attempting to rationalize terrorism? You're going to defend that..?]
[>people are allowed to think what they want (except for this). Are people allowed to rationalise war or murder? Those things are pretty shitty, too. What about murder, drug use, or jaywalking? Wheres the line?]
[That's a very hard line to think about even drawing, but regardless of where the line is, defending terrorism is definitely not ok in any form. That's all I'm really able to say about it- you could say the same thing for murder and such but this goes deep into the psychological borders of what people CAN think about and what they are actually capable of doing. I really don't know if a line could be drawn for something like this.]
[>defending terrorism is definitely not ok in any form. If you want an example of justifiable terrorism try giving Starship Troopers a read. Reality does not hold to vague and context-less absolutes like 'terrorism is never justifiable', and the idea that people should be locked up for saying that they are is insanity.]
[vandalism is not terrorism.]
[This doesn't look like "weekend vandalism" Arson at the very least https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cu6eqiJWEAQoY5r.jpg]
[I'd go along with arson. They probably would have liked to burn the office out. But arson is a subset of vandalism.]
[Oh god, just stop.]
[And you're going to insist that they deserve to go to jail for something *they did not do* ? I didn't realize rationalizing an illegal act being done meant you should be treated as if you committed the illegal act.]
[No, I believe he's defending freedom of speech, which throwing people in jail for making dumb arguments including rationalizing terrorism would be a violation of.]
[The GOP is evidence of that fact.]
[lol dae GOP is dum??]
[Like the stupid things being said in this post where people are trying to pretend some weekend vandalism of an empty office is "terrorism"?]
[Yup. They were just trying to spread some of that liberal tolerance.]
["the use of violence and intimidation in the pursuit of political aims"]
[Vandalism isn't violence and intimidation. I suppose you can read "or else" as a threat. But the things Trump says in his rallies are far more dangerous and directly threatening.]
[Firebombing isn't violence or intimidation? You can't be serious with that.]
[This is 100% terrorism. I do not care who did it, but I do want it to be investigated and those person/people to be put in jail.]
[Rationalizing this might make you anti-democratic and shitty, but a bad opinion doesn't warrant jail.]
[No, a bad opinion shouldn't ever warrant jail. But we're talking about rationalizing terrorism. That in all honesty should not be defendable in any sane form.]
[Terrorism is a tricky term. The Boston Tea Party could be labeled as terrorism.]
[Uh, Did you know that George Washington was a "terrorist"? Martin Luther King Jr. would have been deemed a terrorist today. Every union worker that ever went on strike was a terrorist. It has a place.]
[So firebombing buildings has its place too?]
[So using his argument one can justify just about anything. Noted.]
[Yes, definitely. I don't support the reasoning behind this attack, but it definitely has its place--and not just as a response to violence. Truth be told, if I believed that fetuses were people, I wouldn't view firebombing abortion clinics to be immoral--especially if no one was injured. Insert standard disclaimer that I don't hold those views here.]
[> Truth be told, if I believed that fetuses were people, I wouldn't view firebombing abortion clinics to be immoral--especially if no one was injured. You realize that the abortion debate isn't only about the issue of fetal rights, right? There's also the hugely important issue of *bodily autonomy*, which is why many pro-choicers are willing to grant fetal personhood (though sometimes only for the sake of argument). Even if it were established to everyone's satisfaction that fetuses do have a full-fledged right to life, pro-lifers would still have a lot of arguing to do before they could conclude that abortion should be illegal.]
[Abortion is seriously the worst issue to make the flagship of bodily autonomy because it is still only a point in favor of abortion if you already accept the reasoning that fetuses don't have an inherent right to life (particularly if you view the right to life as an extension of bodily autonomy or vice versa). If you assume that then it's a conflict of rights situation, and I'm fairly confident that the vast majority of people would place the right to life over the right to bodily autonomy in most situations.]
[Violence is a tool, full stop. Tools are neither good nor evil. edit: NB that this doesn't mean that I find *this action* justified, and I actually find it rather abhorrent. However, there are certainly times where any reasonable person would find violence to be a logical course of action. Ending WWII took nearly immeasurable amounts of violence, including attacks on civilian populations, and you would be pressed to find a person who will call it "unjustified". To preempt the inevitable response(s) about violence committed by a nation being somehow different in its justifiability: Why should state actors have a monopoly on violence?]
[I would say yes, hell using nuclear weapons has a place too. Now I wouldn't argue for it in this case but say firebombing Nazi headquarters during WWII I would argue for. So perhaps in some dystopian future where Trump takes a dark turn down Adolph lane and no longer just voices undemocratic ideals but would through arms live them - well then maybe? Anyway what have a place and what doesn't needs to be taken into context and here there is no place for firebombing Republican buildings here and now.]
[Please don't limit this statement to Trump. It could also be Cruz in 2022 or Chelsea in 2027.]
[It could be anyone but the example I used was based on whom got hit - rather pointless to lay out a plethora of fictional futures as to try to cover each possible case where firebombing is warranted. Or had the attack been against Matt Stone and Trey Parker for something said in Southpark I would have spun some likewise fictional and dystopian future were they had enslaved humanity through poo.]
[The American Revolution would have been avoided if the British Crown had recognized the grievances of her American colonies. Even after the Boston Massacre war could have prevented. Had different people been in power America's transition into independence could have been bloodless. As for MLK and union workers on strike, both engaged in non-violent protest. Civil disobedience is *not* terrorism, even both had counterparts that resort to violence. Violence between two peaceful parties is never acceptable. I am not a pacifist, there are times when you have no other recourse, but this is neither the time nor place.]
[You can't have law without violence.]
[[deleted]]
[Let me help you with that: http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Nonviolent+revolution There is a transition of power during in seventeenth century England that is literally called the Bloodless Revolution: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glorious_Revolution Here are a couple more in living memory: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_Power_Revolution https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peaceful_Revolution "Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!" - Ronald Reagan, you may have heard of him. _____ Your comment regarding MLK is so off the mark I do not even know how to correct you. Martin Luther King Jr. epitomized the concept of civil disobedience and non-violent protest in America. Where violence failed, he succeeded. MLK is proof of how free speech is more powerful than any act of violence. The same goes for the labor movement. Both sides committed violence, but it was ultimately the rule of law, free speech, and the judicial process secured protections of the American people. Congress and the Supreme Court were not forced to act at knife point.]
[Are you American? Do you believe the Revolution was a mistake?]
[I am an American and I believe the American Revolution was the result of many mistakes made by the British Empire. Britain created the political environment that made the Revolution possible. I also believe that people have the right to be represented by their government. Had the colonies been granted more autonomy or increased representation in the British government then our Founding Fathers would never had been pushed into declaring independence. Even after American had declared herself an independent nation it was the British Empire that decided that it would oppose the will of her people. Again, with different people in power the American Revolution might have been nothing more than a few short skirmishes followed by the British Empire cutter her losses. Had history taken another path American might have seen increasing autonomy as the influence of the British Empire declined and was unable to enforce its hold over stronger, more distant colonies. The "American Revolution" would have been the "American Transition," driven more by economics than politics. With a weakened bargaining position the British Crown would have likely relinquished much of its control peacefully as part of a newly negotiated relationship between Britain and her American colonies. Instead of the dollar we might still be using the British pound, or even the euro. Instead of honoring our Founding Father, the United States could have become a constitutional monarchy with the British Crown as a ceremonial figurehead. Do I believe the Founding Fathers were wrong to fight the American Revolution? No, and if you take a trip to the UK most people there will say the same. However, they were justified in their fight precisely because the British Empire had the opportunity to resolve the conflict peacefully, but each time chose violence until it was no longer an option.]
[burning a building down because you disagree with the people insides politics however is not the place.*]
[Bullshit. Is that what you would have told James Madison? George Washington? Every war ever fought was over somebody's politics. Many of those were fully justified. It's unfortunate that Bin Laden did it too but it was also how we captured him. All for politics. Just because you don't take it seriously doesn't mean other people don't.]
[While one mans terrorist is another mans freedom fighter, this larticular case is not exactly justifiable. At this point there has just been rhetoric, however distasteful some may view it, responding to rhetoric with violence is inadmissable. Especially considering innocent people could have been hurt.]
[That's how it starts. You're defending tyrants and enabling it to continue.]
[April 19th 1775 the first Minutemen of the American Colonies from places like Westford, Chelmsford, Carlise, Concord and Lexington formed Militias to join forces in Concord. After that shot heard round the world the Minutemen took on a style of warfare unseen by the Red Coats who were stuck in their battle formations. By hiding and surprising the enemy the Militias decimated the English along their route through Lexington all the way to Boston where we finished the worn out Red Coats to win the Battle of Lexington/Concord, and Bunker Hill. It was Guerrilla war fare or an act of 'surprise' that defeated the enemy not ready for anything different from battle formation war fare. It had it's place. Edit a letter]
[> But we're talking about rationalizing terrorism. Agreed. Here's an example of rationalizing terrorism on this very page: ["this is a resistance movement against a fascist takeover."](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/57the0/local_gop_office_in_north_carolina_firebombed/d8utyo8). No. It is terrorism and the guilty need to be held accountable to the full extent of the law. I'm liberal and proud, but this isn't about conservative and/or liberal. This is about terrorism. And it cannot be rationalized. It is wrong.]
[Absolutely. Thank you for some sanity.]
[I regret clicking the link to that total shitshow.]
[Right? "Throw them in jail!" Is a very Trump thing to say.]
[What when someone commits a crime you don't think they should be in jail.]
[It's the "throw anyone who rationalizes this attack behind bars" comment I'm referring to, not the attacker. People should be entitled to their opinions and sharing them should never land you in jail, even if they're unpopular.]
[Rationalization isn't a crime. I don't know anyone who could get through the day without two or three juicy rationalizations. They're more important than sex.]
[He's talking about people rationalizing it in arguments, not the people who actually firebombed it. Of course the bombers deserve to be in jail.]
[Burn him for his comments!]
[Fascist.]
[Firebomb the Republican HQ, a very George Soros thing to do.]
[Soros would never risk himself like that, but it's definitely something he would pay someone to do.]
[No, he would pay someone to pay someone to pay someone to do it.]
[Only after paying someone to pay someone to threaten their family of they ever talk.]
[I vote that Trump failed to pay somebody that paid somebody. That way he can blame it on Hillary and her voters]
[lol]
[This comment, a very 2008 Glenn Beck thing to say.]
[This election will absolutely be made into a feature film directed by Oliver Stone.]
[No joke, arson is a very serious crime.]
[While I agree with you, this is not just arson. This is an act of (political) terrorism.]
[I disavow anyone who thinks this was a good idea.]
[I may disagree with you politically, but I'm really glad the common theme here isn't "good riddance".]
[Of course it's not, wtf]
[It's the internet, call me cynical but I [expected A LOT worse](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cu8Ng74UMAA9ydl.jpg:large)]
[As someone who sits on the other side of the aisle I'd like to apologize for whatever set of scumbags gave you the expectation that "good riddance" would be an acceptable response in this country.]
[https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cu8Ng74UMAA9ydl.jpg:large]
[Your comment made my night. Since I've been taking a very central stance on the "who done it" front I've been getting flack from both sides. It's nice to see a comment with a moderated tone. Thanks.]
[Probably stems from the fact I'm an independent centrist I hate both sides equally lmao np m8]
[I fucking hate this election.]
[That fucking LA Times poll is driving me insane! They say its super accurate and it has Trump in the lead. I don't know what I'll do if Trump wins. I will literally know what its like to be a Jew who needed to get our of Nazi Germany omfg. Disguuuusting!]
[Canada isn't far.]
[I hope this rhetoric is sarcastic. Hard to tell.]
[I love it. I think it's cathartic for the Republican Party to be revealed as exactly what reason-based people have accused it of being all along. Racist, misogynistic, ignorant, incompetent, xenophobic, and quite certainly unqualified to be in charge of something as important as the presidency.]
[Agreed. It's interminable and exhausting. The tabloid election between Status Quo and the Spiritual Successor to Mussolini.]
[God dammit this election is fucking stupid. If this turns out to be leftists then fuck those guys. If it turns out to be right-wingers, then fuck those guys.]
[I **guarantee** it was hateful Trumpets striking back at the GOP establishment they feel has abandoned Trump. They're the only ones I've seen this election cycle who would have enough hate to perform such a deplorable act.]
[I don't. That's ludicrous.]
[Or gals.]
[Fair.]
[The good ol' Horseshoe theory. As a moderate, the actions of the Far Right and Far Left can often be hard to tell apart.]
[Yup. See: Stein/Trump]
[Just because most political movements can have violent factions does not mean their ideologies are similar. That's oversimplifying.]
[Did I say ideologies? No. No I didn't.]
[That's usually what left and right refer to.]
[Is that what you think my comment was about? Ideologies? It's clear I was talking about actions, not ideas. Having an ideological difference is meaningless if your actions are the same.]
[So you *are* saying that the ideological differences are meaningless. Like I said, just because they both have violent factions doesn't mean you should equate the ideologies. They both seek political power too, doesn't make the ideologies the same.]
[>So you are saying that the ideological differences are meaningless. No. I said their ideological differences are meaningless *when their actions are the same*. I don't care what cause they're murdering innocent people for. Their ideologies both obviously tolerate murdering innocent people, which is despicable.]
[Horseshoe theory is not a thing. Stop trying to make it a thing. It's nonsense gibberish. For some reason this bothers me more than chem trail lunatics.]
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseshoe_theory]
[That wiki is shorter than the one in chem trails. It is not a legit theory and no reasonable person in Poli sci places any value on that gibberish.]
[>It is not a legit theory Funny you say that. Could you explain the standard a political science theory must meet in order to be considered valid? That is, without resorting to an argument from authority and popularity.]
[> If it turns out to be right-wingers, then fuck those guys. Well its a GOP headquarters so i kinda doubt it lol]
[Remember the McCain campaign staffer that got attacked by "Obama supporters" who carved a 'B' in her face? Then it turned out she did it to herself?]
[so youre basing it off absolutely no evidence?]
[I'm not basing anything on anything. I condemn the act and refrain from speculation as to who did it and why.]
[we already know who did it, animals representing hillary, get on board we're making america great again]
[I remember that. I bet its the same thing here. The campaign's already a dumpster fire, what's a real fire in comparison? On the other hand, if it really was the work of political terrorism, then they need to be caught, tried, and jailed as there is no call for this sort of thing]
[Absolutely agree. Political violence has no place in America. Let's wait and see what the investigation reveals before assuming who did this though.]
[*edit* yeah you're right.]
[So low it's not even worth mentioning? Got it. The fact is, we all know this was more than likely done by a leftist group. I don't know why anyone would try and detract from that. An action like this wouldn't be anymore of a reflection on most liberals than it would be on most conservatives. When it turns out to be a leftist group, they'll be denounced by the Democratic Party and prosecuted.]
[I didn't aim to detract from that... it was a blanket condemnation.]
[Come on now. We don't want to sound like The_Deplorable]
[You're right. I'd say it's 0%. God dammit.]
[As programmer, I think you can optimize your if else if statement there. Just fuck those guys.]
[Thanks!]
[It could have been abortion clinic bombers that were given the wrong address.]
[Lol, but no. Regardless, fucking stupid thing to do.]
[What if they were Libertarians?]
[They have too much respect for property rights to do something like that.]
[Then that's just the free market at work! Trickle down firebombing!]
[I bet the big bad gubmint did it!]
[Molotov economics?]
[Doesn't matter if it was right or left. The individual did the crime, they are the ones to blame.]
[Yes they are. Honestly though I don't see violent and paranoid language coming from the Clinton camp, though. If Trump voters had done this I would be more inclined to lay some blame at his feet.]
[Better to stay neutral, especially until the facts are clear. Regardless, I'd much rather lay this on an individual and not a group as a whole. No matter how hateful the rhetoric gets this election, we're all still on the same side.]
[Oh of course, but the attempted terror plot the other day is a little closer to the rhetoric he's been spewing, and two of three have been identified as Trump voters. Right-wing terrorism is a significant threat in this country, but (R)s always try to [suppress those findings](http://usuncut.com/politics/bombshell-dhs-overlooked-anti-government-militias/)]
[Nonsense. This was an act taken as part of either one of two political ideologies (far right or far left), there's plenty of blame to go around.]
[These guys are part of only ONE party, the criminal party. It's not leftist, it's not rightist it's universal degenerate asshole. We need to be clear, violent assholes don't represent America and individual emotionally stunted idiots do not represent a whole political party of the two major political establishments.]
["#NotAllLiberals"]
["#dontgiveashit"]
[Yeah...its true. Not sure what point you're trying to make.]
[I think he's trying to make the point that, if this was a radical leftist who committed the bombing, it's interesting that many liberals' response has been "well that's just a few of us, you can't say all liberals are violent" when that's what conservatives have been saying for months now about Trump's radicals. Especially as a conservative who's not voting for Trump, it's been sickening having to deal with being called a racist, sexist, Islamophobe, you name it, just because I'm not a liberal. So I guess the point is, welcome to the party. It's not that fun, is it?]
[No sane, rational person thinks all people belonging to a certain group act the same way. I dont think every conservative is racist. Just about every racist is conservative though, but thats besides the point.]
[See, there's your problem, though - "no sane, rational person". What percentage of Americans do you think qualify as sane and rational? In my book it's under 15% at this point.]
[Wow, you dont have a lot of faith in us! Lol]
[That's no true scotsman there, and I abhore it. I'd rather whomever "side" the fault lays on to directly address their followers and tell everyone to chill.]
[C'mon man. That's a cop out. With all the riots of BLM and the riots a few months back when Trump rallied in Ca. and now this, you have to admit the left has a violence problem.]
[All extremists have a violence problem. They believe in something so hard that they value it above general ethical principles. BLM extremists have a violence problem, and the BLM movement as a whole could do more to denounce them, although several spokespeople have done so. Pro-Trump extremists also have a violence problem, and the people at the top are egging it on and then denying ever doing so. They could not only do more to distance themselves from that rage, they could start by not deliberately agitating it.]
[>Trump extremists also have a violence problem What examples do you have? I haven't seen any evidence this is an issue on both sides. It just seems like a liberal cop out. You have to face the fact your side has a problem with violence and you turn the conversation into the violence on both sides. When people bring up the racism on the right the conversation doesn't go to the lefts problems with race. And that's fair. The left has less racial problems. And the right has less violence problems.]
[Throwing stuff at reporters, punching protestors, planning a terrorist attack on a mosque and Muslim neighborhood. Both sides have them.]
[I think you missed my point. I don't deny both sides have them. There are racists on left. But when we talk about racism, its justly the right we scorn. If we were to look at the ratio of attacks from trump supporters to liberal to liberals on Trump supporters it'd be 1:100. We both know this.]
[No we don't. Do you have any evidence that isn't anecdotal to support your claim?]
[I can supply you over an hours worth of footage of liberals attacking Trump supporters and BLM rioting. You can show that black Trump supporter punch a white heckler at a Trump rally after he saw a KKK hood. This conversation is dumb.]
[This kind of thing is why I suggested we focus on what's undeniable. Both sides have violent extremists and both sides should do more to distance themselves from those elements. What's not productive is trying to reddit-thread-litigate who has been more violent. You think it's clearly my side and I think it's clearly your side. But honestly neither of us are likely smart or unbiased enough to formulate a clear methodology and do the numbers. We're suffering from too much filter-bubble vision: you see endless footage of BLM rioters, I see endless footage of peaceful protests. Your news feed is full of articles about the MSM dramatizing some isolated event at a rally, mine is full of opinion pieces about how violent rhetoric like Trump's could lead to murders on Election Day. We're too far apart, man. There's no accounting we can both agree on. I don't condemn you for that, by the way. It's just how the world is. Have a great day, conservative-bro-guy.]
[So no. You don't have anything that isn't anecdotal.]
[> violent assholes don't represent America Most of Earth disagrees with this statement.]
[The fact that it's a Republican headquarters and it's not 100% automatically assumed that it was leftist shows you how crazy this election is. That's the kind of unknowns we get when the Republican nominee is convincing his followers that the Republican party is actively working to stop him from becoming President.]
[It's more likely that it's a liberal that has bought into the idea that Trump is Hitler 2.0 and will start a nuclear armageddon and mhst be stopped. We'll see, but leftist scare mongering is certainly encouraging a lot of violence and hate this election cycle.]
[Sure but don't you think Trump has encouraged his followers to turn on Republicans since he is preemptively blaming them if a loss occurs?]
[Then why would he attack a GOP office?]
[>88 Do y'all think you're being subtle, or what?]
[Benefit of the doubt, they could be 26 years old.]
[That'd be 28]
[Shit your right. My bad.]
[I think you're being paranoid and making an incorrect assumptiom.]
[Nah, I checked your post history!]
[Got eem.]
[The first thing I said to my spouse after learning everyone was OK was "No one should have done this, but I half suspect this could have been planned by Trump's campaign as a way to deflect attention or build sympathy." Like, the fact that I actually think that's possible and wouldn't be terribly surprised is a very sad thing.]
[Seriously, it's honestly their own fault that something like this has happened. All of the fear and hate mongering they spread, it was bound for this to occur. They have spread this culture of hate, and are now reaping what they sowed.]
[I voted for Bernie and I will vote for Clinton, but I disagree very strongly that any political volunteers going about their business deserve to be bombed. Just because I don't agree with them politically doesn't mean they deserve to be hurt or killed. If those of us who think our politics reflect our morality begin to think this way, we'll quickly lose the tenuous grip our country has on it's humanity.]
[I NEVER said that anybody "deserved" it. Don't put words into my mouth, and don't libel me as a hatemonger. I was only stating that when you surround yourself with hate, don't be surprised when hate comes knocking on your front door. Figures a Bernie supporter would be spreading more lies.]
[You are hate mongering though...]
[You said it was their own fault and they reaped what they sowed in the same comment. It doesn't come off as a very cheery sentiment and reads very much like you think they deserved it.]
[They aren't competent enough]
[It's the kind of thing someone desperate not to lose but miserably behind would do.]
[The fact that's your thought shows you've allowed yourself to be blinded by this tribalism bullshit. Fucking don't go there. You should be ashamed.]
[I think it's less a sign of how crazy the election is (though it is definitely that) but a sign of how are reluctant democrats are to consider that their "side" is to blame. Somebody above immediately blamed Trump and got gilded for it. People saying "I dont condone this... but, probably republicans false flagging" really appears as partisanship to me. I vote for the democrats out of lack of options, rather than devotion so I have lot less bias than most democrats I've observed.]
[I think his point is that it could a Trump supporter mad at the Republicans for not backing him up enough.]
[Only one person gives gold to another user, it's a glorified upvote. People are wondering about a false flag operation because Trump is openly blaming conspiracies and the "rigged election" for his crappy campaign. He introduced this conspiracy theory element into the national discussion and like everything he does lately it totally bit him in the ass.]
[Annnnnnd something something hillary emails. Something something wikileaks, something something podesta. Something something hrc/dnc collusion something something pay for play something something bengazi]
[It IS partisan. Anyone making any assumptions based off current facts are doing a disservice to themselves and everyone they talk to about it. We don't know who did it, their motivations, and spray paint on the wall doesn't get us any closer to figuring it out.]
[Agreed. 4k comments in here and it's just not as cool to go "we don't know who or why, but maybe we shouldn't start bickering amongst ourselves just yet"]
[yeah you don't want to consider its ever "your" side. Takes overcoming some cognitive dissonance.]
[> false flagging The false flagging narrative has always been there on both sides. I more talking about how in the past week Trump has been on the offensive against Republicans and several Trump supporters were lashing out online against GOP members since Trump was preemptively blaming them for any loss that may occur. So if they attack online it is also within the realm of possibility that they attack in real life.]
[People saying it's false flagging must not understand how much hatred exists between Trump supporters and the mainstream GOP. Violent #NeverTrump people are much more likely culprits than a false flag operation. I can't believe I even have to say this.]
[I can't believe you can't wait until we have the culprit to start spewing conjecture everywhere]
[I doubt it's never Trumps, they're about as vanilla as you can get.]
[There's also millions of them. To use your terminology: some are bound to be not-so-vanilla.]
[>The words, “Nazi Republicans get out of town or else” were spray painted on the side of an adjacent building. I think it's pretty easy to determine the political leanings of these guys. Also, orange county is pretty much the liberal capitol of NC.]
[He forgot to add El Barto]
[Well.. it could be moderate Republicans wanting rid of just the Nazi republicans, as in the song "Nazi Punks Fuck Off" by The Dead Kennedies (non-Nazi punks), or it could be people not in the party (maybe Democrats, maybe not Dem party members.. plenty of people here in the UK hate the Tories but they're not all Labour members) saying "All GOP are Nazis GTFO".]
[If the Trump campaign is in a tailspin, why would leftists firebomb it? Makes more sense that right wingers are trying to gain sympathy. Also the message painted on the adjacent building is suspicious.]
[I always figured Mecklenburg or Wake counties to be more blue than Orange county.]
[in 2012: Wake- 55% Obama, 44% Romney Mecklenburg- 61% Obama, 38% Romney Orange- 70% Obama, 28% Romney Durham- 76% Obama, 23% Romney Durham/Chapel Hill is VERY blue.]
[>I think it's pretty easy to determine the political leanings of these guys. If they had any political leanings. The threat sounds like it was lifted from an old western. The bomb certainly appears to have fizzled, than goodness. And thank goodness it happened on Saturday night, not Monday morning.]
[Uh, did you see the inside? It was a total loss.]
[Yeah, I saw a damaged room with a bench, a desk and rows of cardboard signs still standing. Whatever was in the bomb was not much of an accelerant and that's good, or the building would have gone up.]
[Or someone trying to make republicans feel more fired up to get out and vote...]
[What could those words mean though? We may never learn the true reasons for these actions. /s]
[*untangling motives intensifies*]
[Graffiti does point to out being someone on the left, but bear in mind it's not like trumps crew and the rnc are getting along these days.]
[If it was just "republicans leave town" I would see your point. But the Nazi part just screams radical leftist]
[More than likely yes. Almost certainly. However, Trump is really bad about projection. All I'm saying is I wouldn't be completely surprised.]
[Honestly this makes it feel more false flag to me rather than less - that's pretty over the top rhetoric that feels a little like a caricature. That said, there are crazy people on both sides so who the fuck knows.]
[There are antifa people out there who legitimately think and do things like this.]
[Is it? That sounds like what somebody who wanted everyone to be mad at leftists would write.]
[I think that if you think it's very easy to determine someones political leanins because of spray paint on a wall you are going about this the wrong way. It could have been a leftist because they hate the party. : It could be a jew because of the conspiracy shit trump has been spouting. It could be a trump supporter to generate condemnation towards hillary in a state that looks to be very close. But yet you claim that it's easy to figure it out? How come you feel that way?]
[But then again, who isn't against Nazis.]
[Could be their pitiful attempt at burning the Reichstag...]
[People on this sub claim that actual emails from Hillary is a conspiracy and all made up but shit like this gets upvoted]
[Odds are it was leftists, but it's entirely within the realm of possibility that some wingnuts could do a false-flag op. Guarantee if a Clinton office was firebombed /r/The_Donald would scream it was a false flag.]
[Ah yea they're playing the victim card in full force now.]
[Yep, Trump supports firebombed themselves. Any way to turn it upon Trump. You are the epitome of /r/politics.]
[Odds are it was leftists? Why? Because someone put nazi up there? You don't have anything close to required information to know much less make a guess. Anyone could have written that from a trump supporter to tip the state red since it's very close, to a hillary supporter who's fed up and went crazy to a jew who's upset about trumps comments.]
[It wouldn't even have to be a false flag in fact it would much more likely be Trumpers out to get the Republican "establishment" that has so "betrayed" them as of late. Chances are it is just some mentally unstable leftist though.]
[IIRC, not too long ago T_D was saying that, as the election got closer, there would probably be some kind of false-flag attack to make it look like Trump supporters were responsible.]
[ahh, anything is possible, ofc. But it should be beneath you to suggest so w/o any evidence whatsoever.When they go low and so on...]
[> Odds are it was leftists, but it's entirely within the realm of possibility that some wingnuts could do a false-flag op. For context, the county went 70% for Obama and is home to UNC. The neighboring Durham county was at 73%. So, a Trump campaign headquarters in the middle of Obama territory with a couple of nearby universities. Unless there's some other evidence, I don't see anything pointing towards "false flag".]
[There's no evidence of pointing away from a false flag eigher. Nobody got hurt, so either that was lucky, or if an inside job they made sure just to destroy some campaign materials and furniture. Trump was quick to start tweeting about it.]
[> There's no evidence of pointing away from a false flag eigher. When you hear hoof beats, assume horses, not zebras. A straight attack should be the default assumption here. If any evidence comes out in the other direction, then the assumption can be revisited, but I wouldn't appreciate Trump supporters claiming an attack on a Clinton HQ was a false flag without evidence, so I won't do that myself either. > Nobody got hurt, so either that was lucky, or if an inside job they made sure just to destroy some campaign materials and furniture. This happened overnight, so that's not necessarily surprising. > Trump was quick to start tweeting about it. Trump's quick to start tweeting about literally everything.]
[>A straight attack should be the default assumption here. The spray paint honestly seems like something a Republican would imagine a Democrat would say.]
[I must have hallucinated all those videos of Trump protestors calling Trump a nazi.]
[Trump immediately blamed Hillary, it's a swing state, and "Get out or else" sounds so fucking unbelievably cheesy that it points more towards false flag than a genuine statement of rage from the left. People see what they want to see, I guess, but this is straight out of InfoWars playbook to try to stir shit up to win votes.]
[>When you hear hoof beats, assume horses, not zebras debatable on location]
[> When you hear hoof beats, assume horses, not zebras. A straight attack should be the default assumption here. I have no real answer on either side, but for something like this, my first question is "who stands to gain most from this event?" and look in that direction. I'm sure someone could sit down and work out a big pile of gains/losses on either side of the accusations, but at the end of the day - assume that the attacked was carried out by whoever had the most to gain. Same reason that the spouse is always a prime suspect in a murder.]
[It doesn't have to be a false-flag either. Trump supporters are displeased with the GOP itself for being 'traitors'. We just don't know what happened yet. Polling statistics are not an indicator of guilt.]
[This specific office was campaigning for Trump, Trump Pence signs were right there easily visible...]
[Who would benefit by firebombing that building? Clinton? I don't think so.]
[You think who will benefit from this entered into the mind of the person doing it? Trump benefited from every riot/protest that the left started at his campaign events, was that a false flag too? The area this happened isn't short of extremelist liberals, simplest explanation is that it was one of them buying into the Hitler narrative than any tin foil hattery business.]
[Didn't Hitler firebomb something somewhere and blame it on others?]
[Ha. Well I'm not calling people claiming that this is somehow a false flag Hitler either.]
[The Reichstag.]
[You are describing a place where the demographics would make it easy to point at one side in the absence of actual evidence, while also not being a particularly large loss to the other. Anecdotally the jewish kid at the end of the street painted swastikas on his own door and tried to pin it on some kids he didn't like in highschool, but the swastikas painted on the homophobic preacher's office were put there by college kids attempting a pro-LGBT thing. The phasing of the message is clear, but the intent depends largely on the motivations of the writer. There's no evidence either way at this point.]
[Damn look into that guy if he's from the same town then lol]
[I obviously don't know one way or the other, my first reaction was it was a left-winger, but just because the voting split is 70/30 doesn't provide any evidence one way or the other. You could argue just as easily that the 30% feel powerless being surrounded by the "opposition" and they're behind it.]
[There are some pretty radical leftist groups in the area too. I remember a group of self-described anarchists took over an empty building in Chapel Hill a few years ago.]
[rad,did they wear leather and play NIN all night?]
[Yea, the false flag people don't realize how crazy the crazies in chapel hill/carrboro are.]
[Absolutely, they call literally everything a false flag.]
[YOU GUYS ARE INFERRING THIS IS A FALSE FLAG OP RIGHT FUCKING NOW. How do you not see how hypocritical you're being??]
[Well when wikileaks confirms that the DNC has actually conducted at least one false flag, people might start to get suspicious.]
[It's how you can tell they buy health supplements from Alex Jones.]
[[What if I'm a false flag?](http://imgur.com/a/2zCJE)]
[Yeah but we're not talking world government conspiracy here. Something like this is the one time I believe it could actually be a false flag, because it would be so incredibly easy to do. I'm not saying it is, just that it very easily could be.]
[At this point, I think if in the third debate, Trump walked over and grabbed Clinton's crotch they'd label it a false flag.]
[You're delusional]
[He can't grab her by the pussy because she has more balls than him.]
[I know. I live there. It's probably a bunch of idiot leftists being fucking morons, but after the whole ["backwards B"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashley_Todd_mugging_hoax) thing I never know.]
[The swastika was the right direction and at the proper angle. It was a leftist.]
[Haha, I'd accept this as evidence.]
[Probably not for the same reason as the guy above you though.]
[That's me.]
[Oh man I'd forgotten about that. That was crazy.]
[Damn. I had to go and read the article, thought they were talking about Orange County, CA whos residents lean red]
[OC will be blue in a decade.]
[This community lead blue. according to this. http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/article108627627.html]
[That's absolutely great. I know the area has many hate groups, mainly anti minority groups that I always read about. Hopefully that's changing]
[[Orange County is turning blue.](http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-smoller-orange-county-goes-democrat-20160824-snap-story.html) You can thank Pete Wilson and Prop. 187.]
[Different Orange County]
[Wait a second. There are articles you can read here?]
[Haha I hate myself for what I'm about to say, r/politics and r/the_donald are my version of reality tv. I just come and go for the comments]
[Fuck it dude. Popcorn's good.]
[Yeah im always on mobile and all the ads on the sites make it near impossible to read most of the posted articles. I wish someone would just copy and paste the articles into the comments always.]
[Get an adblocker.]
[are you using safari? You should try using the reader, its a great way to get those pesky ads to stop bothering me when i want to read an article]
[What about for android tho]
[What phone do you have? You might be able to root and get adaway. Otherwise use adguard.]
[Couldn't find a simple button for it on my chrome app, sorry pal]
[I found it buried in the experimental flag settings]
[Firefox for android has a reader mode Chrome probably does too, dunno]
[Don't iPhones have adblockers for safari now?]
[Yeah they do, I bought one the moment it came out "Purify" (or something), they don't seem to work too well. Either that or i couldn't set it up properly to stop annoying pop ups and invasive ads]
[Maybe try looking for a better one? Ads are most of the reason I haven't gone back to iPhones (Adaway is fucking great). That, and I don't have enough friends to give a shit about iMessage group chats.]
[The reader thing gets rid of ads? I didn't know that. That's awesome.]
[Don't iPhones have adblockers for safari now?]
[Maybe on the iOS 10, I haven't installed the new update yet. That would be fantastic if they did.]
[It doesn't exactly get rid of them, just makes it so only the text and photographs related from the article are the only thing you see. But yeah, it's so great to use when you actually want to read an article and not know about the some credit card offer]
[Still, that's fantastic. Thanks duder.]

[What makes a man turn neutral? Lust for gold? Power? Or were you just born with a heart full of neutrality?]

[With a pinecone. A very pointy pinecone.]
[Have sex with them?]
[With a firebomb.]
[Unless it was pandas. They're too cute to hate! ]
[Fuck 'em all to death. TO DEH-YUTH]
[> DEH-YUTH I read that in Hetfield's voice.]
[Seriously, we tolerate free speech and should welcome debate. Who ever did this is scum]
[Check out r/anarchism. They are celebrating this.]
[I mean, I respect their right to do say that, but I stand by my comments.]
[Yeah. But I doubt it was an undecided voter either way.]
[They won't be voting this election - they're going to Federal ass-rape prison for this.]
[Hope so.]
[They bombed a Government building. It's game on.]
[Fuck em. *edit* the bombers.]
[Fuck the GOP or fuck the bombers? Clarify.]
[Bombers. Sorry.]
[its not a govt building btw]
[It was used to conduct Government business.]
[Probably not before the election, though. They may have even submitted a postal vote already.]
[Yes, the proper punishment for vandalism is clearly rape.]
[It would be great if it wasn't left or right wingers, but just the collective disgust of the normal people forming into a poltergeist to attack political offices of both candidates.]
[... this should be on black mirror...]
[Agreed. Since no one was hurt and there was a super mean note, isn't it sad that my first thought was "false flag perpetrated by lone wolf to generate sympathy"? And I'm a diehard Trump supporter.]
[It is sad. This election is so fucked up. At least your second thought was "hold on let me think about this more thoroughly."]
[You bring up a good point. .]
[Turns out it was Gary Johnson all along!]
[It wasn't a firebomb, it was what happens when you try to do dabs with a blowtorch with the canned air you were huffing earlier sitting next to it.]
[Classic third-party candidate move if I've ever seen one.]
[What if they hate Trump but would rather firebomb this place instead of voting for Clinton?]
[It's unlikely. Maybe. Fuck this election.]
[It could easily be someone who was paid and has no personal stake. It seems odd that when something like this happens we always assume that whoever did it is also the mastermind. While the rich psychopaths who control our government, and are the only ones who really stand to benefit, are completely ignored. Probably because that would be a conspiracy theory, which is a word that in our culture means "stupid".]
[/u/StanGibson18 What did you do???]
[It could totally 100% have been committed by someone who is frustrated with their choices, aka an undecided voter.]
[Nope; all of us are filing for refugee status in other countries. We are gonna let you crazies burn rome from a distance.]
[So fuck whoever did it]
[Fair.]

[Are you a human submarine?]
[Beautiful female submarines :)]
[Did you just assume their gender?]
[I think it was "human submarines"]
[Well that's fucked up.]
[Trump supporters have it coming. Maybe a few more attacks like this and Hillary won't have any trouble in the polls anymore. People will see who the stronger party is.]
[No need to condone violence. Once you do that, you're no better than Trump is.]
[It's to be expected when someone running for the highest office spreads rumors that the system is rigged and his supporters will be cheated.]
[Especially when there are e-mails showing them trying to rig it backing up those stupid claims]
[Except there's not...]
[Pretty much the slogan for the 2016 election.]
[you again? we need a pepe the frog type meme for "well that's fucked up" somebody get to work on that.]
[>“Nazi Republicans get out of town or else” What did they mean by this?]
[it means they are being brainwashed by clinton media propaganda like /r/politics]
[As if anyone who is regularly is the donald isnt brain washed. Its like you guys live in an alternate reality. Posting easily disprovable things as fact. Accepting some ones anonymous anecdotal evidence as fact. Believing the polls are rigged when the worst candidate ever is losing to the second worst candidate ever.]
[Agreed, comrade! When the Russians hacked in to our glorious political party's computers they must also have started a social media attack designed to foster bigotry and hatred amongst the straight, white male elite! They are so blinded by privilege, they played right in to the Russians' trap! We need to keep fighting to get Hillary elected so that she may begin re-educating these poor souls and make them understand how their privilege and implicit biases almost cost us our great nation!]
[You're all brainwashed]
[it is rigged]
[R politics is supposed to be neutral. It advertises it self as such. T_D on the other hand is supposed to be biased. The fact that they are considered to be on the same level is telling.]
[There will never be a neutral political forum, conservatives are simply not up for it.]
[You mean the DNC. They are the ones who took over.]
[I don't think /r/politics advertises or is "supposed" to be neutral by any standard.]
[it seems like a place for politics not left politics, but I have only found an echo chamber here, which is fine but I am looking neutral politics and don't find it here. It's pretty misleading.]
[This is really dumb there's literally /r/NeutralPolitics if you wanted actual neutrality.]

[Make it happen /u/spez]
[holy lol /r/politics hasn't been default for years]
[holy lol /r/politics hasn't been default for years]
[I know that, I had to go there after I saw the insane skew here.]
[If this was a place for left politics why does ever jacobin article I post can downvoted out of existence right away?]
[Yeah it's weird that on a forum that curates content based off of audience preference and participation features largely pro clinton, the candidate up by 10 points, content.]
[R politics reflects the opinion of that represents the demographic section country at large, minus the fact that since trump is literally indefensible his followers needed to separate themselves out and stop engaging in outside of that. People forget that this place was virulently posting anti Clinton articles during her email scandal, and the primaries more broadly. Fucking Breitbart articles were making it to the front pages every day. This places has a political character that reflects the fact that trump supporters have largely migrated to a different sub and now what get up voted is what the people that are here want to see.]
[>The fact that they are considered to be on the same level - >Posting easily disprovable things as fact. Well that didn't take long.]
[lol why is this the argument every time this topic is brought up? it makes no sense. The_Donald is explicitly in favor of a candidate, it's literally in the name. /r/politics is about politics, not a particular candidate. I'm a Trump supporter, I don't go to The_Donald for reasoned political debate, I go there to support him. I used to come here to get a wider range of political perspective, but that just doesn't exist here anymore.]
[go to neutralpolitics, it's pretty good but there are strict rules.]
[They need to make /r/neutralpolitics a default and only allow non partisan comments]
[> The_Donald is explicitly in favor of a candidate, it's literally in the name. /r/politics is about politics, not a particular candidate. Actually as far as reddit is concerned those are 2 independent subreddits who just happened to be owned by different people who have different rules and allow different posts and just happened to have those names. As far as reddit is concerned they could both turn into subreddits about cooking tomorrow and as long as that's what the mods wanted reddit would do everything it could to help them turn it into a cooking subreddit. Just because it's called /r/Politics doesn't mean it has to be neutral in any context in any way.]
[what they *have* to do is completely irrelevant. Thanks for pointing out that subreddits aren't bound by laws, I guess.]
[I mod a really shitty circlejerk subreddit and was introduced to these reddit rules by a mod who is likely still stalking the shit out of my profile. Reddit is a weird place.]
[If it was a small subreddit he probably had nothing better to do but check out his new mod. Make sure you weren't some covert implant there to ruin the circlejerk]
[I phrased it weird, it was a mod on another subreddit that didn't like me and still stalks me.]
[So /r/politics can kill people? I'll be damned]
[This man's record is in need of correction. Please show him his bigotry, comrades!]
[Seems like something a Trump supporter would write posing as a Democrat. I wonder if the building had fire insurance...]
[That statement alone, and the drawing of the swastika, makes me think it was an inside job. Why in the hell would someone doing this to get back at the GOP draw a swastika and mention "nazi republicans?" Let alone the "or else" which sounds sooo old school western. If I were a dem and i did this, I'd have drawn a bunch penis's sword fighting. I'd try for a congo line of unicorns humping each other all the way around the building, but my drawing skillz aren't that good.]
[Wait for the media spin. It will be amazing.]
[It's just a roundabout way to ask for a sit down interview on CNN.]
[Doesn't really fit the narrative of a leftist group TBH...I can't help but feel that this stinks just a little bit.]
[I think it was a teenager. It makes the most sense. It seems too risky for it to be a false flag, or a double false flag.]
[Wtf i hate republicans now]
[Bigotry toward Nazi Republicans maybe? But I don't know if there are really any Nazi Republicans.]
[...or else they'd firebomb their HQ. They didn't give them very much time apparently.]
[They probably wouldn't give you a sensical answer since these actions have no legitimate reasoning.]
[They want to NOT SEE any Republicans, obviously.]

[You mis spelled "**illegal** immigrant", you seem to think it's spelled "hispanic people". He called for a special prosecutor to look into the incredibly shady email stuff. Perfectly legal thing for a President to do. There's evidence that clinton rigged the primary so you'd be stupid not to be concerned with voter fraud in the general. I could keep going but I think we both know what your deal is.]
[What is my deal?]
[It starts with a C and ends with a TR]
[Lol]
[No way. Couldn't be. Trump is responsible for this!]
[Normally people would write that *before* they firebomb a place, but these guys didn't want to wait i guess, so they did the or else preemptively]
[I wonder if it was even the same group.]
[Two attacks!]
[Well, one site was just graffiti. It's entirely possible, though unlikely, it was unrelated to the actual firebombing.]
[>or else can someone explain this part in particular to me? need a little assistance]
[Maybe whoever wrote it is a rigorous philosopher and wanted to present a tautology.]
[It's the implication!]
[Are you going to hurt women?]
[Just don't go on any boat trips with Hillary.]
[Yeah... I'd like to know what else entails.]
[I think they just wanted to sound threatening and don't have anything particular in mind. Someone who does shit like this doesn't seem like the most sound and rational individual that would go into long term planning]
[Or else more violence will happen]
[Pretty cryptic - I think they're saying they'll tolerate the Nazi fascist deplorables to death with firebombs. Just a guess, though]
[This was a favorite movie ploy in old westerns. We never learned what the else was, because John Wayne rode in to save the day.]
[Which is why it doesn't feel like a liberal attack. As a former bible thumping conservative it has all the hallmarks of an inside job.]
[We may never untangle their true motives]
[The soyche continues......]
[I heard they didn't intend to hurt anyone.]
[[deleted]]
[Whoosh]
[If they came prepped to graffiti a message in all likelihood they were intending to do it when nobody was there. They want to send a message, it looks like,]
[They were on their way to sunday school when mean words forced them to firebomb a political office. They're the real victims here.]
[the perpetrators were peaceful protesters who were unaware of their actions and cannot be held accountable but if the perpetrators were republicans they'd be radical alt-right terrorists and trump would be literally the next osama]
[Hopefully they receive immunity deals before they are investigated, since obviously the intent can't be proven.]
[There is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very dangerous, highly flammable materials.]
[They said they were sorry and weren't going to do it again.]
[Holy fucking shit. I am not Republican, but fuck whoever did this shit. This is straight up unacceptable. I hope whoever did it is caught and prosecuted to the fullest extent that the law allows. Fucking Terrorism.]
[If it leads to the better candidate getting into the White House, I think the American people will be able to survive some "terrorism".]
[You know we can see your post history and activity on /r/The_Donald, right?]
[It was far left anarchists.]
[No shit. Nobody on r/politics is a repub.]
[I know I'll probably be crucified for saying this but this is what happens when the media constantly draws parallels between Trump and Hitler. It's dangerous. If you have convinced people that Trump is truly the next Adolph Hitler, then this is the right thing to do in anyone's mind who believes this. We can't let Hitler take over America, we have to do everything and anything to prevent it - at least in the minds of those who have been convinced of this. This election has been really terrible for this country, on both sides. Very sad.]
[vandalism isn't terrorism]
[FIREBOMBING is not vandalism.]
["Firebombing" is a rather dramatic word for putting flammable liquid in a jar, setting it alight and throwing it. > Hillsborough police said somebody threw a bottle of flammable liquid This is not your Vietnam napalm type of firebomb, but what kids do.]
[I think the word terrorism gets thrown around way too much. This is terrorism. Violent destruction and creating fear in order to achieve a political goal.]
[[deleted]]
[This arson [came with art](http://2ytbf92vre5w2ny7tu3f25u3.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/NC.jpg). It's political terrorism.]
[That's a stretch. Now vandalism is terrorism. Cool. What do you call armed Trump supporters intimidating .. oh never mind, why even try?]
[Vandalism is typically a petty crime. But this vandalism came with a threat, with a clear politically fueled message. That along with the fire bomb creates a clear instance of imminent danger that has the goal of furthering a political agenda. This is absolutely an act of terrorism.]
["or else" is a threat? Come on, these were kids who threw a bottle of flammable liquid and used some spray paint. As far as issuing threats and intimidation, Donald Trump says far worse in his rallies every day, in more explicit threatening terms.]
[Terrorism and patriotism are two sides of the same coin. It all depends on who wins the war. Anybody remember what the ORIGINAL tea party was all about? Our patriots...England's terrorists.]
[This qualifies almost every violent crime as an act of terrorism, though. The point here wasn't that the word *can't* apply, it's that it's often used too broadly. Most crime is dangerous, threatening, and frightening. Being robbed by someone with a knife isn't generally considered terrorism yet it's clearly terrifying for those involved. It's absolutely a political crime. Whether or not it's an act of terrorism is a matter of semantics (which is what I assume we're focusing on in isolation here).]
[So you don't believe that this was "The use of violence and intimidation in the pursuit of political aims.]
[That's not what I've said. The word changes as the world changes, though, and right now "terrorism" is intimately tied with America's external conflicts. I'm only making a semantic argument, or at least extending one that someone else started. If we go by the current cultural idea of terrorism, the phrase doesn't work because we largely use "terrorism" to refer to external conflicts at the moment. If, instead, we're going by the dictionary definitions, what's important to me is that "terrorism" describes motivations but not the nature of the crime whereas "arson" describes the nature of the crime but not the motivations. The word "political" appends a description of the motivations, so it's redundant when paired with the first. "Political arson" isn't as reusable but it's technically more accurate because it describes both the nature of the crime and its motivation. **Arson** - the criminal act of deliberately setting fire to property. **Terrorism** - the use of violence and intimidation in the pursuit of political aims. Both apply. One is more accurate, the other more emotional.]
[Terrorism is the appropriate term here. Are you trying to reinterpret terrorism to only include Muslim terrorists? I agree that accuracy in language is important, which is why it is important to use accurate language. I would classify this as terrorism. Were the Bundy's simply engaged in enhanced armed protest?]
[The message makes it *political* but it doesn't justify an upgrade to the term "terrorism".]
[I think that #10 and #11 should be reversed. An incitement to revolution is much more serious than an act of political terrorism.]
[I'm kind of tempted to remove "political terrorism" altogether. The only reason I didn't is because it's become something of its own phrase separate from actual terrorism. I was having trouble finding something else to put on that end though and didn't want arson to suddenly jump to the end of the world. It's like "war on XYZ" phrases which make use of "war" from the bottom of the list paired with a theme.]
[It is a difficult thing to label and separate. I guess that's also why "leveling" of threats is so difficult to maintain.]
[They literally spray painted on the sides of nearby buildings "Nazi Republicans get out or else". Straight up threatening them, outside of the very clear threat of FIRE BOMBING A FUCKING BUILDING.]
[> A swastika and the words, “Nazi Republicans get out of town or else” were spray painted on the side of an adjacent building. No damage estimates were available. The irony of calling someone a Nazi while you throw cans of gas through their windows and vandalize their buildings /edit Guys, there is absolutely no evidence whatsoever that this is a false flag. I am hardcore anti-Trump and all his fans, but until *actual evidence* is uncovered, there is no reason to think that this is anything but what it looks like.]
[There's no reason to think it is, but there's also no reason to think it's not. Assuming it is "what it looks like," which you presumably mean is what the writing on the wall purports it to be, is as ignorant as assuming it's a false flag. Only investigation can reveal the truth. It's also quite natural to consider the possibility of a false flag given the playbook Trump's camp has been using.]
[> Assuming it is "what it looks like," which you presumably mean is what the writing on the wall purports it to be, is as ignorant as assuming it's a false flag. Oh come the fuck on. It looks like a duck, it quacks like a duck, the safe assumption is that it's a fucking duck. Looking at the evidence you have is not "equally ignorant" to ignoring it. > It's also quite natural to consider the possibility of a false flag given the playbook Trump's camp has been using. Even as I acknowledge that Trump has frequently called, implicitly and explicitly, for violence, connecting that to a possible false flag bombing seems like kind of a stretch. (Honestly it might be giving the movement too much credit for intelligence and forethought.)]
[As a professional percentage giver I'm going to give this a 70% chance of being leftists, 25% chance of false flag, and 5% chance of being disgruntled Trumpists.]
[So was america acting like Nazis when they attacked nazi germany?]
[No. We didn't terrorize civilians.]
[Yes we did; having bombs dropped on your city is scary and demoralizing, and I don't believe for a second the Allied commanders weren't thinking of that effect. In a war it helps to erode popular support for your enemy.]
[Dresden... Edit: but no, that doesn't make us Nazis]
[No, it doesn't. We didn't bomb Dresden to kill civilians. Unless you believe Nazi propaganda.]
[You don't fire bomb a city without knowing you're going to kill a bunch of citizens]
[You must not have followed my original point then. Collateral damage is inevitable in war. The difference between it and terrorism is intent. The objective of the Dresden bombings was to destroy German railway supply lines. Unfortunately, many civilians were killed in the process. This is diametrically different from actively targeting civilians, which is what the Germans did almost *daily* to England.]
[I disagree with the assumption that the US didn't target citizens in that operation. This went beyond collateral damage. The city was a moonscape afterward. Much like the atom bombs, these operations were meant to pummel nations into surrendering. It was terrorism.]
[But America did kill a lot of them. Dresden and such. Interesting to see where we draw the line.]
[Collateral damage is not the same as terrorism. Intent matters.]
[Do you have any idea how easy it'd be to spin Republicans as collateral damage rather than innocent civilians? The Republican party has been overtaken by white supremacy and racism, so people who see them as dangerous as the Nazi party was in the 1940's do not consider anyone who affiliates themselves with them as innocent civilians.]
[That's called terrorism. It doesn't matter if the whacko that bombs people doesn't consider the victims to be innocent civilians. They still are. They aren't targeting combatants of war. It's really not a complicated concept. Edit: How nice of you to wedge your radical, delusional opinion about Republicans into the conversation, though.]
[Not to the people who are dead it doesnt.]
[Should manslaughter be treated the same as 1st degree murder?]
[thats not an intellectually honest comparison. A car accident that kills someone is no where near the same as a bombing run on a city. Justification vs intent.]
[They are directly comparable. The only difference is scale.]
[Bombing a city full of people is the same as getting in a car accident? Wut? You can do better than that. edit: ask yourself, why do we treat a war different from a car accident?]
["No reason," is incorrect. There are plenty of reasons to *think* this was a false flag, there's just no reason to state definitively that it was. Just as if there was a terrorist bombing in Paris there would be plenty of reasons to think it's related to Islamic extremism.]
[Wonder if the _b_ in republicans was backwards... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashley_Todd_mugging_hoax]
[Plus it seems odd to me that someone would use a swastika as part of a threat TO a Nazi type group. Not saying it's a clue, just odd, whoever did it.]
[I think it was a Trump supporter who did this. Just my gut feeling.]
[Without any reasonable evidence, that's just speculation. It's a possibility, just as other possibilities are there too.]
[That's why I had a disclaimer of: "Just my gut feeling."]
[It isn't part of a threat, it's a branding. Like tattooing a swastika on a neo-Nazi's forehead so the world sees what they are.]
[It's branding not typical of the left.]
[...what?]
[Usually the left would put a peace sign, or stop hate, or black lives matter. But a swastika, not a swastika with a line through, a straight up swastika? The only people I have seen using those are fringe groups on the right.]
[Did you even read my comment?]
[Yes... Calling someone a Nazi is not the same as spray painting a swastika on one of their buildings. Are they going to burn a cross in the front yard of the Governor's house to brand him as a Klan member?]
[Why do you think spray painting a Nazi on someone's building can't be a means of calling someone out as a Nazi?]
[Because generally when you call out someone as a Nazi you would cross it out or write the word. It's just not typical. You wouldn't see someone who hates the Nazi symbolism using a swastika against people who they dislike, that is something that happens to the right of the spectrum generally. It aggrandizes the symbol that they supposedly dislike.]
[There are quite a few "anti-fascists" on reddit who fully support any level of violence against those they consider fascists. Literally including gulags. Heck, they also were willing to include me since I wasn't also willing to commit vigilante justice.]
[Having seen "antifa" folks on the streets of Berlin in black hoodies doing their best skinhead strut impression, it was not a good thing. We *should* oppose Fascism and movements like it, but not by becoming gangs of violent thugs.]
[I agree, by giving up the rule of Law until we are using the same gutter tactics as our enemies is just as reprehensible. Of course, I have also been threatened because of my respect for the law, since fascists also use the law. Just too weird.]
[This point of view has always interested me. It's a common narrative that Trump is going to enact policies that any person should find horrifying, to the point where I've seen claims he'll create internment camps for Muslims. And let's remember that the most famous fascist regimes committed some of the most famous horrors. If you believe that a group of people is going to cause damage like that--because they want to and they have the potential power to do so--then extraordinary measures become allowable. The only logical objection to those "gutter tactics" is if you try to argue that they don't work, because property destruction is *absolutely* justifiable if you're trying to keep fascists from committing crimes against humanity.]
[No. Property destruction isn't justifiable because you believe that someone will do something bad. The antifa people aren't just interested in attacking someone for their actions, but for their potential actions or for simply stating their political beliefs. That is wrong. Legally and morally. Perhaps you aren't from the US, but we have laws and rights to express ourselves as long as it doesn't actually inspire acts of violence. "A common narrative" is not evidence of incitement. Spouting off nonsense like Trump does is not justification for attacking Trump nor his supporters. That isn't how a free society works. So although it may feel like they are fascists, that doesn't mean that you have the right to cause them harm. The fact is that by not providing them a day in a fair court, then you really are no different than those you attack. By using vigilante justice and terror tactics against those you believe cause harm, then you have invalidated the entire concept of a free system of law. We might as well start up the soviet gulags and violently repress all those that disagree with us. The simple fact is that by authorizing belligerence into the political process you have shown to have no respect for a peaceful political process. Claiming that you know more than any court is a perfect example of tyranny. How long until I do not fit your political purity tests? Now, of course, I fully support public shaming and ensuring that the public is taught to understand the warning signs of these potentially dangerous political movements. I fully support the use of our Constitutional system and our historical legal precedents to maintain fair and free political processes. I fully support the laws that protect our citizens against mobs and others who might wish to use their power over them. And when someone actually attempts to incite violence, then they will be arrested and tried in a court of law. Not some kangaroo court run by political extremists like the antifa people I have met on reddit. They are downright crazy and tend to ruin any political demonstrations because of their use of violence. Violence simple de-legitimizes a political action, no matter what they believe.]
[> No. Property destruction isn't justifiable because you believe that someone will do something bad. Okay, so we have to wait until *right* at the point at which, say, Trump begins sending Muslims to concentration camps to act? Or can we do that if he gets into office and says he's going to do it? And remember that we're still talking about vandalism here, not assault. Mind, I don't think Trump is actually going to do that. I don't think he *could* and even if he could I'm not sure he'd be especially inclined to. But if you say that Trump poses an extraordinary existential risk to democracy and justice, then it logically follows that extraordinary means can be justified to stop him. Before on Reddit, when arguing this point, I've used (well, my opponent brought it up first) the example of a fascist group organizing around a platform that includes killing all Japanese. In such an example, I honestly have absolutely zero problem with a Japanese person throwing a rock through the window of their office, or even punching a particularly loudmouth fascist. I mean, if someone's at a public rally talking about how they should kick the Jews out of the country, I'm not going to complain if someone slaps them. They're building a movement which, if you actually take them at their word, intends to uproot me from my home and send me off someplace else. > The fact is that by not providing them a day in a fair court, then you really are no different than those you attack. Yes I am; my political philosophy doesn't require ethnic cleansing. It does require sabotage and vandalism on occasion, but that isn't even remotely on the same scale. > The simple fact is that by authorizing belligerence into the political process you have shown to have no respect for a peaceful political process. We *already* authorize belligerence into the political process. Protesting without a permit can get you arrested, even on public property--and you can even be beaten. The rise of fascism also marks an increased acceptance of belligerence into the political system, because fascism requires violence targeted against groups defined as enemies of the nation, and the rhetoric they use is frequently threatening to minority groups. > And when someone actually attempts to incite violence, then they will be arrested and tried in a court of law. Okay, that's nice, but what do you do if that court isn't fair? That's happened numerous times before, in living memory too. Hell, people have gotten away with straight-up *murder* before. If fascism becomes a resurgent force, they will attempt to subvert the courts and the laws, so that what they are doing becomes legal (either officially or unofficially).]
[It's not ironic, you can be destructive & violent without having a fascist ideology.]
[Telling political opponents to leave isn't fascism?]
[No. Words have meanings.]
[> fascism OXFORD: (in general use) extreme right-wing, authoritarian, **or** intolerant views or practice. surely someone as well versed as yourself knows what the word *or* means.]
[suppression of political opposition is a large part of what makes fascism despicable.]
[No, it isn't. Fascism != things I don't like]
[no, but suppression of political opposition is one of the defining characteristics.]
[Small red sores are a symptom of herpes, you don't say you've got herpes every time you get a spot.]
[so what, if they're left wing they can't be fascist? let's be honest here, fascism is not generally used to refer to the political philosophy of Mussolini these days, it's used to refer to politics of those _like_ Mussolini or Hitler or Franco who suppress political opposition and have staunchly xenophobic foreign policies.]
[> so what, if they're left wing they can't be fascist? Yes actually. You can't be a left wing fascist. The two ideologies are incompatible. Changing the definition of fascism like you try to do in the second part there doesn't make it true. Fascism is a right-wing ideology. Suppression of dissenting political views can be anywhere, left, right or fucking centrist.]
[so was Hitler a fascist? what about Stalin or Lenin? They behaved in much the same way, but one executed Jews and one executed "bourgeoisie". You can fiddle with semantics all you want and argue that only right-wingers can be fascist but if the difference is purely "right" vs "left" then the word itself has no purpose.]
[> so was Hitler a fascist? Yes? Are you trying to argue he's not? >what about Stalin or Lenin? No? > You can fiddle with semantics all you want and argue that only right-wingers can be fascist but if the difference is purely "right" vs "left" then the word itself has no purpose. This is nonsense. Literal nonsense. Can only left wingers be communists? Yes? Well whats the point of the word then? Fascism is a specific set of viewpoints. Its not just 'views I don't like'. I'm not sure what I would call a mixture of nationalism, xenophobia, right wing economics and a cult of personality now since you're trying to argue the word has no purpose.]
[Assuming that there is a left wing candidate.]
[>if they're left wing they can't be fascist? Yeah, pretty much. Nationalism (including ethnic or religious nationalism), state capitalism, economic isolationism, totalitarianism, and conservative social values are all tenets of fascism. Every modern leftist movement is opposed to at least 2 of these tenets, so no, leftists can be fascist. In most cases where people refer to movements as fascistic, they usually do have several similarities with fascism. UKIP promotes nationalism, economic isolationism, and state capitalism, without saying much on social values. Trump promotes nationalism, increased isolationism, state capitalism, conservative social values (though these are to an extent more a trait of his voting base and his party than his own personal beliefs). He has also expressed sympathy towards non-democratic political action, and totalitarianism (see his comments on "you 2nd amendment folks", rhetoric about the supposedly rigged election, and his attitudes towards the press). This is straightforward stuff. 2+2=4, Santa Claus isn't real, and fascism is necessarily right wing.]
[there are many left-wing movements that support a number of those policies. The Kurdish independence movement supports ethnonationalism (as does the free palestine movement in many cases), communism in its implementation supports nationalism, totalitarianism and economic isolationism. Some commies like to suggest that the USSR was state capitalist too. Given communism and socialism are pretty much the measuring sticks for leftism, would you not say that the separation is actually pretty muddy?]
[Yes, a number. Hillary Clinton supports state capitalism. That doesn't make her a fascist. Most American Republicans support state capitalism, conservative social values and nationalism, that doesn't make them fascists. There's also a major difference between the state capitalism of a socialist state and a fascist state. Your point about communism is just stupid and historically naive, as fascism drew much of its support as a buffer against the rise of communism in Europe. So the separation is muddier than my comment expressed because I'm not writing an essay on the characteristics of fascism, but no, communists are not fascists. Try again.]
[North Korea, USSR, Cold War China all prime examples of leftist totalitarianism.]
[Leftist totalitarianism isn't fascism, you utter numpty. This is not difficult.]
[>so what, if they're left wing they can't be fascist? I mean, part of the definition of Fascism is is that it's a far right idealogy, so sort of...]
[but then you're getting into horseshoe theory and the idea that fascism and state communism end up being effectively the same thing. fascism gets misused all the time to attack/silence right-wing voices when the main thing that was common among ascribed "fascists" was violent suppression of political opposition. Hitler was a self-described "socialist" and Lenin did the exact same thing to the "1%" of Russia that Hitler did to the Jews. Violence in furtherance of politics is the real threat, not left or right. Once violence gets stamped out we can talk civilly about policy differences (in an ideal world).]
[> Hitler was a self-described "socialist" For fucks sake. He called the party the National Socialists, but I guarantee no one can look in there and find socialism. Trying to call him a socialist using a lack of knowledge of socialism doesn't make him not a fascist.]
[No, but if I have a bunch of small red sores on my dick I'm not gonna go "well, could be anything, no reason to see a doctor"]
[Not all spots are small red sores. Also, not all spots are on your dick. Reading comprehension isn't your strong suit, is it?]
[The suppression of political opposition is characteristic all revolutionary political ideologies and movements. Be it French republicans in overthrowing the king and then suppressing monarchists, or America revolutionaries forcing out loyalists and confiscating their property, or Bolsheviks overthrowing the Tzar and confiscating the property of the bourgeoisie, or Nazis banning their political opponents and arresting all the leftists. But even in America's founding, all the people that *didn't* want to leave England, well they had a rough go of it. When the [US passed a bill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helms%E2%80%93Burton_Act) that would punish companies around the world that did trade with Cuba, if they also did trade in the US, on the basis that they were trafficking goods produced by property that was 'stolen' from the US during the Cuban revolution, the Canadian Parliament introduced a bill which would punish American business for profiting off property and land that was owned by Loyalists who were forced to flee to Canada.]
[that's quite an interesting historical tidbit, TIL. I guess the distinction in your examples would be that the movements that I see as fascistic in nature would be those that execute non-combatants for simply being politically opposed. Fascists in their most distilled sense were known for doing just this (as were the Bolsheviks), as well as earlier acts of intimidation like stationing brownshirts outside polling places as "security" who would peer into ballot stations and coerce voters. It might not be the original definition of "fascist" (Hitler wouldn't fall under the original definition either), but in modern parlance I would argue that political violence is what underpins the accusation of "fascism", for example all the ANTIFA protests against anti-immigration as supposedly being a form of political violence.]
[I agree that anything that is violent gets accused of fascism and I pointed these out because I think that is kind of silly, since I'd say that what ANTIFA does is pretty good. I'm really not heart broken over terrorism or violence against nazis. That being said what happened today *isnt* that, random republicans are absolutely not nazis, obviously, and there is no excuse for bombing their office at all, or violence of any sort against the republican establishment infrastructure. It's stupid, puts innoncent people at risk and only creates the opportunity for an even worse reaction. Because ANTIFA is 'illegitimate' in the political frame work, action against 'legitimate' targets makes no tactical sense, the purpose is to essentially go after other groups of people that operate also outside the framework of legitimacy. Like the neonazis that assaulted my friend at a transgender rally, ANTIFA going after them would be fine with me. But things that are within the context of the mainstream, absolutely not, I'd like to think that no comrades would be stupid enough to think that this would work out well.]
[> I agree that anything that is violent gets accused of fascism and I pointed these out because I think that is kind of silly, since I'd say that what ANTIFA does is pretty good. I'm really not heart broken over terrorism or violence against nazis. What? So you think that violent political intimidation is OK when it's against people you don't agree with? For the record, I'm anti-immigration and I'm based in the UK - so in other words, while I want us to help the Syrian people escape persecution from ISIS, I do not think it would be good for either them or us to forcibly integrate them into British society. According to ANTIFA that makes me a Nazi, and according to what you just said you wouldn't mind seeing acts of terror perpetrated on me for my opinion? This is the thing that gets me about leftism and the "ends justify the means" mentality. You start out with "I'm OK with Nazis being hurt" but due to a general unwillingness of the left to actually acknowledge right-wing perspectives you end up with random, reasonable individuals like myself being attacked on the street by violent agitators like ANTIFA. > Like the neonazis that assaulted my friend at a transgender rally, ANTIFA going after them would be fine with me. That's fucked up that that happened, but whatever happened to the idea of not answering violence with violence? What that individual did is beyond reproach but when ANTIFA are throwing bricks at ordinary people who disagree with mass immigration you suddenly think it's ok?]
[Maybe ANTIFA here isn't like ANTIFA there... when just existing in the world as a trans person, or *looking* like an immigrant can attract violence, reacting against that is self-defence. Throwing bricks into crowds not so much.. I can only speak to the situations I myself have been in.]
[The modern parlance of the word fascism is generally very wrong though. [George Orwell wrote an interesting little piece about the appropriation of the word fascism to mean little more than a pejorative term for anything I don't like.](http://www.orwell.ru/library/articles/As_I_Please/english/efasc)]
[I can agree with you on that, but language does by its very nature evolve and acquire colloquialisms over time. Fascism was really a belief system that exclusively defined Mussolini's party but it's generally considered to include leaders like Hitler and Franco now too.]
[It's ironic as they have a fascist ideology as their little message proved.]
[Their message wasn't a fascist manifesto.]
[It's ironic because the Nazis did exactly that. Maybe you need to freshen up on the definition?]
[Yeah, violence is for *everyone*! Wait, I think that came out wrong. Seriously though... Violence can come from basically anywhere on the political spectrum.]
[But it was a common occurrence in fascist movements]
[Also in hard left. In Germany leftist organizations killed a lot of people in the Cold War, and so they did all around the world. Don't kid yourself that this is characteristic for either side. The horseshoe theory has been proven over and over again.]
[So was speeches. And running for office. Political violence is not unique to fascism.]
[violence is a common occurrence in anything that isn't pacifism, and probably half of all pacifist movements have had violent streaks as well. Could as well argue 'perpetrators consumed oxygen']
[And in the revolutions of the enlightenment.]
[It was a Kristalnacht reference I think]
[Kristalnacht was in response to [this.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_vom_Rath)]
[And?]
[Kafkaesque]
[lol sure it was]
[Not necessarily, the Bolsheviks did exactly that, long before the Nazis did.]
[Yeah and so called moderates like Obama and Clinton have a long history of using violence when it suits them]
[Is it possible for you to actually contribute to the conversation being had? Or are you just going to conspiracy theorize about a topic that is not being brought up?]
[It's over your head, just don't worry about it and go play pokeman or something.]
[Drop me some facts while my mom tucks me in.]
[they're saying u/MisterBadIdea2's comment was a kristalnacht reference]
[But it says Nazis. That's the point. "Nazi Republicans" + windows/vandalize I don't think that means Bolsheviks]
[But then it isn't ironic. Which was the point the poster was trying to make. And arguably it's a shitty comparison to begin with, because in both cases it was mobs of people fire-bombing several establishments at once, and not a single building with no-one around]
[woah, they were being sarcastic but not that sarcastic]
[well not *that* long]
[Utterly unacceptable, whoever did this needs to be held fully accountable for this.]
[This is just wrong. I hope they catch whoever is responsible and quickly.]
[Don't worry. Trump already knows it's Hillary before everyone else apparently. Uh.]
[Don't worry they already figured out who it was https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/787782613633208320]
[Wow, he really knows how to seed an idea into his followers. Much like the media barrage of speculation as seen in places like /r/politics.]
[The FBI found them, but said they didn't recall breaking any laws so their off the hook]
[As much as we disagree with ideals and opinions, no one should be blowing up opposition buildings just because of it. Everyone is allowed an opinion whether you like it or not. We shouldn't devolve into suppression tactics just because of an opposing opinion.]
[> We shouldn't devolve into suppression tactics just because of an opposing opinion. are you sure you're on the right subreddit m8?]
[Exactly, you don't become leftist facists and threaten with violence. That just defeats your whole entire argument. So whoever is downvoting: you disagree because violence is acceptable?]
[If you want your comments to fit in with all the others here, you need to add a **but...** at the end.]
[None of the top comments have "but" at the top. Can't you be civil, just for once, and accept the fact that the consensus here is to utterly condemn this? Your sub is already throwing vitriol, as though the entire left condones such BS tactics. What happened to "fuck whoever did this, but it won't affect anything, because we're above this"?]
[This reminds me of when every politician felt the need to clarify that they have a daughter after Trumps tape came out.]
[That's incredibly insightful.]
[It doesn't help when the media is calling Trump a Nazi and the biggest scum on the earth. Yes he has his flaws but it gets way overblown]
[His fascist rhetoric deserves to be called out by name. He really is a dangerous rabble-rouser who's overtly called for religious discrimination, gruesome violations of human rights, rejection of the free press, and distrust in the legitimacy of our democracy... ... which is why the appropriate response is to *vote for someone else.* Whichever violent idiots committed this attack were acting irrationally on the basis of exaggerated rhetoric - but the comparisons underlying the exaggeration are real. This is the tightrope the left has had to walk throughout this year. The Republican nominee is, honest to god, an authoritarian strongman, a demagogue, a narcissistic know-nothing. Trying to convey the seriousness of those five-dollar words without referencing the *one* fascist government that *everybody* recognizes is a real bitch.]
[Not just trump. His supporters too. They are trying to demonize us. It is absolutely terrifying. I really really hope people understand that the vast majority of us are not racist. We just want change. Real change, not the false BS Obama promised us 8 years ago (I voted for him). We have lost our country to the elitist globalists. Voting Trump is the first step on the road to recovery. But instead of going out and explaining why I am a Trump supporter, I have to hide it. If I did not, I'd have to worry about becoming a pariah, vandalism, assault, or as this incident has shown, worse. I'm so frustrated that I feel the need to hide my political views.]
[Nope, you're a bigot.]
[Wanna know the sad thing? I would never insult you supporting a candidate, even if I vehemently disagreed with your personal politics. You know absolutely nothing about me, other than I support Donald Trump, for reasons I just enunciated that have absolutely nothing to do with identity politics.]
[You're support for Trump says a lot more than you would ever admit to yourself]
[How can you refuse to support gay marriage?]
[I think you are confusing Trump supporters with cuckservatives.]
[I never, not once, said that I didn't support gay marriage. Where do you even get that from?]
[Trump does not support it. You support a candidate who wants to end gay marriage, therefore, so do you. The LGBT community needs more allies and yet we still have politicians running that publicly shame us and then people SUPPORT that candidate. It is essentially like you supporting Hitler and telling a Jew that you love Jews, but you love Hitler more.]
[No. First of all, he supports the states deciding the issue. Now, is that a policy I agree with? No! However, I don't agree with every stance Mr. Trump has, and guess what? Thats OK! Were all Americans and we have different political opinions on different issues! If you naturally agree, lock step, with every opinion of a candidate you vote for, you are very lucky! Now in the same vein, let me ask you: Do you support globalism and TPP? Hillary does. Do you think African American youths are super predators? Hillary said it. Do you support mandatory minimums and harsher sentences, which disproportionately effect the African American community? Hillary sure as shit supported Bill when he signed just such a bill enacting these policies into law. Do YOU support gay marriage? Hillary, until very recently (when it was politically expedient), did NOT.]
[Yup... and notice Trump doesn't attack Hillary supporters. He attacks Hillary and he does it ruthlessly. He never comes and attacks directly her supporters. He doesn't call them all racist sexist deplorable etc. "Oh but trump attacked Mexicans!" Is what will be said next but That's pretty racist to assume minorities automatically support Hillary.]
[He didn't even attack Mexicans. If he did, that would piss me off. He attacked ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS. As in the people smuggling drugs across the border. Also, I find it funny how dems are in favor of illegals coming to the US to work for peanuts. It is modern day slave labor, and the dems are ok with this?]
[Trump's tweet about this event blames Hillary supporters. https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/787782613633208320]
[That's the best you can find? Him placing blame on the obvious choice for who did it? Where is he directly insulting Hillary supporters in general?]
[This is pretty specific toward the supporters of Hillary that did this, and not her supporters in general.]
[There's literally zero evidence that supporters of Hillary did this. How about you wait until the police finish their investigation?]
[I agree we should wait to see what the investigation says. That doesn't make your comment that Trump was attacking supporters of Hillary and less false.]
[> "**Animals representing Hillary Clinton** and Dems in North Carolina just firebombed our office in Orange County because we are winning." Name calling and blame at the same time.]
[You're going to have to try and see past your biases here. He is clearly referring to the specific group of people (that he is assuming support of Clinton) Had Donald Trump tweeted something like "Clinton supporters are all animals. They burnt down this building" your claim would have merit.]
[That changes the narrative of 'poor old Trump' though, we can't have that.]
[> We have lost our country to the elitist globalists. This is probably the most hilarious thing I've ever read. "WE HATE ELITIST GLOBALISTS! LET'S ELECT ONE TO MAKE SURE THAT CHANGES!"]
[Pretty much my same thought.]
[Come on now. Hillary has herself said she wants a world without borders, when speaking to Goldman Sachs. Say what you will about Trump, but if he supported a globalist foreign policy, do you really think the agenda driven media would be so heavily in the bag for Hillary? There is a reason they oppose him so stridently. Look at his reaction to Brexit. Listen to the policies he argues during his stump speeches as well as during the debates. There is one candidate who the wealthy gloablists are backing this election. And it aint Trump.]
[*A* reason?]
[Is the media actually calling him a nazi?]
[Yes. He did a thing in one of his rallies where he asked people to raise their hands and pledge to vote for him, pretty typical for a political rally. Most candidates do it. The media turned it into a "trump is a fascist" story and skewed the images to look like the Roman/Nazi salute that you see in most Nazi pictures.]
[Link?]
[Shameful.]
[Goes to show that a deplorable base exists on both sides. EDIT: if you believe all the bad people are on one side, and all the good people on another, that is stupid logic. That is Trump-type logic.]
[I wouldn't lump people with, to me, perverse views with people who firebomb, though.]
[afaik we don't know the political affiliation of the attacker(s)]

[Yes, we do. No need to condemn anyone until law enforcements caught the people behind that.]
[I bet the libertarians did this.]
[Nah, we actually believe in property rights and non-aggression...]
[Gary Johnson will do anything to be in the news, so maybe it was him.]
[True, but they wrote something about 'nazi republicans' on the side and I'm assuming far-right supporters wouldn't use that language.]
[Not every criminal clearly spells out their motives. It's entirely possible it was a conservative. It doesn't matter what side of the spectrum they're on, they're shitbirds and should be arrested.]
[I have a guess, too, but it's important not to jump to conclusions. as with any news]
[As a former far rightist. This is exactly what they would do. trump is losing in the polls and they need to drum up support.]
[You're right and wrong. The other guy (with and oddly similar username) is correct that we just don't know. Every comment thread seems to be devolving into a victim blaming, false flag, "moral high ground? really", etc. thread. We should all just condemn it and wait until we know more before we try to place blame. IMHO I think it's just as likely it's somebody from either side. As you said initially, there's deplorables on both sides.]
[Yeah, I never made a statement on exactly who it was, but it is an eyeopener that there are people in our country ready to do these kind of acts and everyone should be ready to condemn them, regardless of political affiliation.]
[One might even say deplorable.]
[They're in the basket.]
[No might about it. Anyone that does something like this is deplorable. Who thinks something like this results in any good?]
[The basket of deplorables is more than large enough to fit idiots and criminals on both sides of the aisle. It's always important to remember that nobody has a monopoly on these fine people.]
[Definitely deplorable.]
[Deplorables exist on both sides. It's a big basket.]
[I'm an American and this is just getting out of hand. We shouldn't be fighting each other because we have different views. It should never come to violence. I fear this will only make things worse.]
[This is fucked up, and whoever did this needs to be brought to justice. There are no excuses for this type of thing at all.]
[What if it is the only way to ensure we get the right person in the White House though? There is too much at stake to gamble, and maybe intimidation is the best tactic right now.]
[No, that's not right, whatsoever. Just no.]
[Nope]
[Was there someone making an excuse for it?]
[Well, sort of. Tons of liberal press equate Trump to Hitler. If Trump actually was the next Hitler, as a lot of the left says, isn't this sort of shit actually justified? http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/donald-trump-hate-groups-neo-nazi-white-supremacist-racism There's an article. Now let me ask you, honestly, do you think Trump wants to make America a pure white country? Do you honestly believe that Trump is a racist? Sure, he's said some dumb shit, and you guys like to push that to the forefront and say he's some KKK supremacist guy, but I feel like you guys know that it isn't actually true. It's an effective political attack. And I don't think most of liberal America actually believe that Trump supporters are a bunch of people in robes putting flaming crosses on the lawns of black people. But it's an effective political attack. The problem with that, is that if Trump was the next Hitler, then this violence is justified. Nobody needs to make an excuse for this event specifically. The excuses have already been made. This is the exact reason why most of the people I work with don't know who I'm voting for. I am legitimately afraid, and rightfully so, that it could result in violence toward me. The crazy part about that is that most of the people I get along with at work are black people, and because I'm voting for someone who I allign with on the second amendment, taxes and illegal immigration, I'm terrified, and again, rightly so, that people will label me as a racist. This is what the politics of the left brings. Thanks.]
[I like how the first comment was politically neutral and said it was unacceptable and then you went off on a rant about the left. People need to pull their heads out of their asses on both sides.]
[Additionally, I just want to ask. Really, I want to know what you honestly think. If a DNC office got bombed, do you think the response on this sub would be politically neutral?]
[It's a real fucking problem. If you don't think it is, take your head out of the sand. Trump supporters aren't smashing windows that have Hillary stickers on them. The opposite absolutely does happen. It's demonstrably true.]
[" I do wish people would just stop saying "in Orange county" There's an Orange county in 49 friggen states. You can't just say "Orange County" to inform.]
[It's pretty clear which one is being referred to if it isn't followed by a state. Orange County, CA has a higher population than 21 states in the US. But I see your point.]
[Im from OC, CA, i freaked when i saw the headline as i might of had family in the building.]
[That's the problem. This incident is in Orange County, North Carolina. So it's NOT clear where it is.]
[Is Colorado really the only state that doesn't have an Orange County?]
[I dont believe you.]
[/u/terribleasshole said there were 49 states. Colorado doesn't have one.]
[Well, Louisiana certainly doesn't have am Orange County.]
[Do they have an Orange Parish?]
[And besides it's the worst color/fruit!]
[I am from Canada. I didn't know about the other Orange Counties cept in cali.]
[Im from the OC and i live in Canada, which is doubly confusing when the initials of Canada is CA, and the initials of California is CA.]
[Add another level to the conclusion if you live in Ontario. Be it the Canadian province or the Californian city.]
[No doubt. Fortunately im in BC.]
[Totally understandable since as /u/PracticallyPetunias pointed out the population of Orange County CA is huge in comparison, plus the television shows which highlight it. Two of the other sometimes known Orange Counties are typically Orange County Florida since it contains Walt Disney World and Orange County NY for being apart of the NYC Metro area. With no disrespect intended to those in Indiana, Virginia, Texas, Vermont, North Carolina Orange Counties. Oh and Georgia has a Peach county instead of Orange.]
[The NBC version quotes the local GOP rep as follows: "North Carolina Republican Party spokeswoman Emily Weeks told NBC News that the office is totally unusable and that materials inside, possibly including completed absentee ballots, may have been destroyed. She said the office had received no threats." Why would it be possible that there were filled out absentee ballots in that office?]
[Dead voters?]
[Sounds like an inside job to me. Good catch. The county is overwhelmingly Democratic but they will use this incident to attempt to nullify part of the vote count.]
["JET FUEL CANT MELT STEEL BEAMS!!1!!11!"]
[Don't worry, leftist election officials will just tear them up anyway. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RegGHCCh_m0]
[Son of a bitch! That's an actual attack to democracy.]
[Sometimes parties send canvassers to the houses of their supporters who register as permanent absentees (e.g. If they have a disability that makes it hard to vote in person) and then deliver those to the registrar on the voters behalf. They are required to deliver them promptly but there could be some ballots in the office for that reason. Not sure on NC law but that is legal in many places.]
[because it's be possible that there were filled out absentee ballots in that office.]
[wow, you're so smart]
[But why would they be there? That is, second to maybe a trash can, the last place actual completed ballots should ever be found.]
[Because they are trying to make it seem like the election is rigged. .]
[> Why would it be possible that there were filled out absentee ballots in that office? There wouldn't be/shouldn't be any ballots in the office of a political party. Ballots are distributed by and returned to the [local county board of elections office.](http://www.orangecountync.gov/departments/board_of_elections/index.php) which are supposed to be nonpartisan. If there were completed absentee ballots in that party office it would be a major case of election fraud. A major nail in the coffin of Trump's "rigged election" nonsense is votes are counted on the local county level, literally thousands of separate local county-level election offices across the country are the ones who count the votes. Trump is trying to make it seem like the Federal Government controls and counts votes and can therefor corrupt the results but that's not the case. My local Supervisor Of Elections is a republican.]
[Because collected ballots could have been sealed but not mailed yet.]
[Why would uncounted ballots be in the Republican HQ? I thought absentee ballots go directly to the local Department of Elections place?]
[NC person here, you can turn in absentee ballots at the county election office, the state one, any library, any party office, and any fire station that has a sign saying they take them.]
[I can't speak for North Carolina, but in my state (Oklahoma), you fill out your ballot and then seal it in a series of envelopes to guarantee anonymity. Once it's sealed, it's not unreasonable to ask someone else to put a stamp on it and/or drop it in the mail for you.]
[In Colorado (for example, where I live) it's against the law to turn in more than a certain number of mail in ballots. I think the idea is that no one should be handling that many ballots for other people. I can't find the exact number online, but I saw it on the locked outdoor ballot box when I dropped off my primary ballots earlier this year. So having a bunch of ballots in a campaign office seems suspicious to me.]
[Hmm I suppose so. It just seems strange that there would be an appreciable number of ballots there given my experience w/ voting.]
[Lots of registration drives go out with absentee ballots and let people vote on the spot. The folks doing the drive will then deliver them to the SOS. A likely explanation is that they completed an outing yesterday and were waiting to deliver the ballots on Monday.]
[Why would completed ballots be in a republican office? At least in my state you turn them into the county auditor which is controlled by the secretary of state.]
[Lots of times parties will collect ballots to ensure they are turned in by supporters. Not too unusual.]
[Why would any official admit to wrong doing so blatantly? I doubt they did anything wrong.]
[some offices act as a station to acquire and fill out absentee ballot applications and ballots. ballots are sealed, and then an Election official will people them up daily, weekly, or bi-weekly. Its different in every state.]
[I think the point is that you would expect completed ballots to be returned directly to the elections board. Pretty sure that's SOP.]
[So, the office should return each and every ballot individually as they are filled out? Like stuff one in an envelope and put a stamp on it? Or maybe someone at the office hops in a car waving the ballot in the air while screaming "Out of my way, I gotta get this to the local election board"?]
[No, it's my understanding that a political party office should not be handling ballots at all. Voter registration forms, absolutely! But ballots are returned by mail to the election board.]
[Or they can be physically dropped off. It saves 100 people a trip downtown if they hand it off to their local party office. Not out of the ordinary at all.]
[It is against procedure because it is a historical step for election fraud. You simple chance what they say or particiapate in ballot stuffing. It doesnt matter if it saves some people some time. Locations such as a party hq should not (and in some states legally cannot) handle ballots in any capacity.]
[I'm guessing government offices aren't open on Sunday.]
[Maybe you could fill out absentee ballots in the building and they would mail it for you?]
[Please don't violently attack people whom you disagree with politically.]
[don't even take their yard signs or remove their car decals.... just vote your conscience and let the chips fall where they may. we have bigger problems to solve than to be dicking around with shit like this.]
[Property != people.]
[Luckily there wasn't a person inside... and who is to say they don't intend to?]
[Who is to say that they do intend to?]
[Maybe the blatant use of "or else" in their graffiti? Edit: Graffiti is a silly word to remember how to spell...]
[Doesn't necessarily mean they're going to hurt anyone. Could just be more destruction of property.]
["nazi republicans leave town or else" kinda makes it sound like arson was just the starter and when you are already burning down buildings then next step probably involves a person and some level of harm]
[Why should liberals change now? They are never held accountable for it. > Protesters jumped on cars, pelted Trump supporters with eggs and water balloons, snatched signs and stole “Make America Great” hats off supporters’ heads before burning the hats and snapping selfies with the charred remains. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/06/03/ugly-bloody-scenes-in-san-jose-as-protesters-attack-trump-supporters-outside-rally/]
["Maybe the geneva conventions are the problem" - Donald J Trump If you vote for this you're a shitty human being.]
[Are you really this obnoxious, or are you pretending to be Ann Coulter?]
[Hey maybe you can get someone to throw rocks at her?]
[She'd love that, she could sell more books to gullible rubes.]
[So not only did she have it coming to her, but she would enjoy it as well. Disgusting.]
[Yeah she is disgusting as are her fans. Partisan politics above all else with them.]
[You might even say she is deplorable and irredeemable and has the attack coming!]
[The first two are true, the last bit I have to leave to people who love when violence occurs so they can push their divisive partisan agendas.]
[You mean like how liberals did when Gabby Gifford was shot by an anarchist who they said was a tea party member, or the Aurora movie theatre shooting where they again said that a leftist was a tea party member.]
[Just stop. American politics are divisive enough already. You're being deliberately obtuse and you're painting with a particularly stupid brush. Domestic terrorism in the US has taken countless forms over the decades, and the justice system prosecutes it just fine, irrespective of ideology. The 60s and 70s saw an uptick in leftist terrorism that was successfully prosecuted. The 90s brought us Tim McVeigh, also successfully prosecuted. If you're complaining about eggs thrown at cars and burnt hats, you have some serious perspective issues about political violence.]
[>Just stop. American politics are divisive enough already. You're being deliberately obtuse Like the people literally attacking people for their political beliefs?]
[So the answer is to encourage more divisiveness..?]
[God forbid we hold people accountable for their hate filled speech. Hey but it is ok most of the time it only results in throwing of eggs, rocks and burning people's clothes. Shameful.]
[No one is saying people who commit violence shouldn't be held accountable. We are saying that it is dumb to say that because there are dozens of cases with video evidence of trump supporters violently assaulting protesters, that it is okay to paint all trump supporters with that brush. Same with Liberals.]
[You only hurt your own cause when you resort to violence like this. As a Democrat I condemn whoever did this and I hope that they are found and prosecuted quickly.]
[But do you condemn the leaders of the Democratic party that incite this type of violence?]
[Hillary literally condemned the attack before Trump did.]
[Easy to condemn the attack she should apologize for her rhetoric that caused it.]
[Which rhetoric would that be? When has she called for violence? When has she called for her supporters to commit acts of violence or break laws?]
[Source? The only leaders I've seen hinting at violence this election have been Republicans. What with those second amendment people taking care of Hillary and her Supreme Court picks and all.]
[If there were any, they probably would. Trump is the only one I can think of who's incited violence this election, but I'm curious to see if you have contradictory evidence.]
[It's funny how supporting moments like BLM isn't inciting violence in your mind.]
[No doubt that some people who identify with BLM have been violent, but the overall idea is about reducing violence, not perpetuating it. Of course, because it's a nebulous movement people will have their own spin on it. However, supporting a movement about police accountability for shootings is certainly not the same thing as advocating violence.]
[*As a human. FTFY All people of all beliefs can and should condemn this kind of thing. This is absolutely unacceptable no matter who you are.]

[Jesus christ, this just goes to show how liberals are truly the cucks that Trump supporters say they are. Let the idiots rebuild their own goddamn office.]
[Paying money to make your problems go away is just a thing rich people do. Anarchists who cause damage because they wish to change the current circumstances are typically the "cucks" in society.]
[The fascists are going to destroy our country, but let's help them out when they're down.]
[Good PR though.]
[Most folk are decent folk. we tend to forget that fact.]
[The outspoken few will always overshadow a silent majority.]
[There are a lot of very unintelligent, wilfully ignorant people in this country. A scary amount actually. Studies have shown that these stupid people are acutely unaware of their stupidity....so dumb they don't even know they're dumb. Sad. For a first world country, we fall way below other nations in education, social services and basic infrastructure. The idiots are taking over. "Majority rules don't work in mental institutions"]
[u/copkiller22 telling us about how stupid and "ignorant people in this country" are! Everyone listen!]

[I am a dem and I upvoted, but not because I like this. No, I upvoted so that it was visible to the most people possible. Having differing beliefs in how our country should be run is fine and in fact, it is encouraged, but this sort of violence is inexcusable.]

[What evidence is there she wants war with russia? And dont bring up her emails that referred to putting diplomatic pressure on them. If Trump is against that his talk of her being a terrible negotiator is all projection.]
[The healthy response is to see something like this and have it give us pause at the direction the campaign is going. I think there's little chance of that, given the rage it will probably send one of the two major party candidates into.]
[That is the healthy response. However, so many people have sequestered themselves in echo chambers, convincing each other that the other side must be cleansed.]
[Honestly, when your party insists on saying over and over again that Republicans are all Nazis and Trump is the new Hitler, what to you expect to happen? The rhetoric the left is using has made this an inevitability. I don't even wear Trump stuff out in public because I know I'll be harassed by leftists. That's not a good sign for your party.]
[Wow you are the real hero here.]
[Some people call firefighters heroes, but this guy is out there everyday, upvoting posts for visibility.]
[> No, I upvoted so that it was visible to the most people possible. Having differing beliefs in how our country should be run is fine and in fact, it is encouraged, but this sort of violence is inexcusable. You should upvote the leaks regarding Clinton's shady practices, too.]
[Upvotes don't help if the thread just gets deleted.]
[Thanks for putting your political affiliations aside for the safety of human lives, and then leaving a comment to let us all know what a decent person you are for doing so. You're a real hero.]
[Well look, there are people in this thread saying "typical behavior from the left" and Trump literally tweeted that this was done by "Animals representing Hillary Clinton and Dems in North Carolina". So, yeah it's a bit silly to act like upvoting this is some big deal, but there are plenty of people saying that is representative of the left (which is completely false) so of course you'll have people saying "Hey, I'm a democrat/liberal and I don't support this."]
[The sad thing is that what political party you support even comes to mind in the first place. The fact that US politics in general, and this election is specific, have polarized people to the point where downvoting things in /r/politics based on which political party it paints in a good/bad light is something you have to think about. This kind of thing should be cut and dry, not something people stop and think about "should I downvote it because it makes my party look bad".]
[what a saint]
[Congrats dude]
[I did the same thing for the same reason.]
[It's amazing how a post with Trump and Clinton supporters immediately shoots to the top of the front page. Almost like we should all be cooperating instead of fighting each other!]
[Ditto. I've been upvoting all of the similar posts. This is abhorrent, we should condemn it, and we need to slap down any who are condoning it. I don't care how much you disagree with the other side or how big of an asshat you think their nominee is, we don't need to become part of the deplorables too. There is never an excuse for terrorism in our society.]
[> we don't need to become part of the deplorables too. Aaaaaaaaaaaaand you've negated your entire post.]
[What pisses me off about this election is that hyperbole has turned issues of convenience into matters of life and death. We live in a pretty good country. There are things that need to be corrected and things that need to be addressed, but there's absolutely no need to resort to violence. And yet here we are. Our only hope is that this causes people to realize that shit has gotten out of hand and that we need to deescalate the rhetoric.]
[Just because you aren't hurting does not mean that others' anger is just the result of heated rhetoric. Trump is the effect not the cause. His supporters have been the big loosers in globalization. This is their last chance to grab power before the neoliberals grant amnisty to the illegals and create a demographic supermajority. They are angry and scared because their children's future prospects are on the line.]
["We" have no hope of deescalating the rhetoric as long as a major party candidate talks openly of assassinating his opponent and pretends he's going to be cheated in the voting booth.]
[The other one is calling massive numbers of people deplorables and painting them as racists that need to be stopped. This is fucked up in both camps. If you pretend it isn't, you're a part of this tribalist bullshit and partially responsible for it all. Don't fucking kid yourself.]
["We" also have no hope of deescalating the situations as long as information keeps coming out that the government is fighting tooth and nail to prop up a certain candidate.]
[What information would that be?]
[Point proven. Aha.]
[Wat.]
[Uhhh... last I heard (the second presidential debate) he said "Jail". When did this get escalated?]
[He has twice suggested that people should assassinate her, although of course he leaves it vague enough for his followers to try to deny it. http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/09/trump-insinuates-hillary-clintons-assassination-again.html]
[That is not advocating for her assassination. That's saying "If you think guns don't keep people safe, don't have guys with guns follow you around and let's see what happens." The obvious point being guns *do* keep people safe, and she wouldn't disarm her guards because then, yes, someone might try to kill her.]
[Possibly. The other incident also mentioned in that article, where he talks about "second amendment people," is far more clear.]
[You're right. Second amendment people could take care of her...in the voting booth by exercising their civic duty to vote. This was overblown, too. He's said lots of obnoxious things, but this wasn't as bad as many made it seem.]
[The full quote: >Hillary wants to abolish, essentially abolish, the Second Amendment. By the way, and if she gets to pick --if she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks. Although the Second Amendment people, maybe there is, I don't know. If he was talking about voting, then the "nothing you can do, folks" part makes no sense. Everyone can do something; they can vote. He was talking specifically about something people can do *after* she appoints the judges. Specifically saying that the "Second Amendment people" can do something that general "folks" cannot makes what he was saying quite clear.]
[He was talking about after she was elected and selected Supreme Court justices. The post-hoc explanation that he meant to refer to their political vigor is absurd.]
[This is what happens when you push the Us v Them narrative so hard every single day.]
[Oh lord.]
[8 years of Us vs Them is beginning to boil over. The GOP created something they can't control and now people are pushing back with the same rhetoric.]
[The media is doing that. They convert the hate to numbers, into money. Your very post shows that it's incredibly effective, too.]
[The GOP? I think it's more the left winged media that has been pushing this rehteric, remember who was just firebombed?]
[> HRC : The attack on the Orange County HQ @NCGOP office is horrific and unacceptable. Very grateful that everyone is safe. > Trump : Animals representing Hillary Clinton and Dems in North Carolina just firebombed our office in Orange County because we are winning @NCGOP Ironically (? given that this was most likely a "leftist" attack on the party opposing her) Hillary is treating this as "we are all us" in condemning it and expressing gratitude that *every* human life was safe, while Trump is going hard on "fuck *them*."]
[Yea lets criticize Trump!]
[You mean like when Obama calls Americans that didn't vote for him "enemies"]
[When did that happen?]
[2010]
[And he then acknowledged that it was a poor choice of words and that he should have said opponents.]
[the media is complicit in this escalation of rhetoric, but the shit flowing down from the head waters in EACH campaign is at the root of it. this is why i can't vote for either of these two.]
[Amen. This subreddit is to blame as well. The shit I've read here is shameful, hateful and the level of hste towards Trump supporters is disgusting. I am not a Trump supporter by any means, but I feel actively terrified by some of the people posting here.]
[neither are going to get my vote, but for entirely different reasons. trump is a reality show actor, a pretty good one, but still an just an actor HRC on the other hand i expect more from and she's been entirely disappointing.]
[It is never going to happen, but both candidates need to have a joint press conference and put a stop to this. Tweets don't mean shit. Both should stand up, condemn acts of violence on all sides, and fucking lead by example. This election cycle is almost past the point of redemption, but that could be a shining moment in the history of presidential politics. Get on stage, shake hands, and remind everyone that we are better than this.]
[Trump has been "condemning" acts of violence over many months now at his rallies. He just boots out any supposed protesters/minorities from his rallies and angry white ppl come out of nowhere with a sucker punch. His insistence that the election is rigged and that he won't stand for the results is only inciting violence.]
[Holy nuts, I can't believe Trump is actually being blamed here. You know what most likely caused this firebombing? A Democrat who spent so much time believing lies like "Trump boots minorities out of rallies" that he eventually came to the conclusion that Republicans need to be punished for supporting Trump. Stop it.]
[How did this person blame trump for this firebomb..?]
[I didn't say Trump was being blamed for the firebomb. It's that he's being blamed for inciting violence. Now why don't you get after him for spreading blatant lies about Trump kicking minorities out of his rallies.]
[He has incited violence though. He advocates violent war crimes, that women should be punished for having abortions and has promised to pay court fees for the supporters who have already violently assaulted protestors dozens of times.]
[http://myfox8.com/2016/08/18/muslim-woman-kicked-out-of-trump-rally-in-charlotte/ I even chose an article from Fox as I assume that's your favorite news source. I called Sean Hannity to confirm.]

[Makes me feel a little bit better that all the vile name calling is just retoric and it'll simmer down.... but then again, what about retaliation? surely some right wing nutter is looking at this and thinking about doing it to democrats to *get back* We need to get a hold of this situation fast. this is a BAD sign.]
[That's what a liberal subreddit does Meanwhile The_Donald is blaming the "animals representing Hillary"]
[That's what liberals do worldwide. Every time there's a terrorist attack, it's twitter avatar swaps, facebook cover images, and denouncements on social media, while liberals continue to push policies, rhetoric or behavior that allows the wrongdoing to continue. Liberals are **fantastic** at making empty statements of solidarity & outrage. The tricky part is getting them to actually address the issue- whether it's radical Islamic terrorism, inner city crime, or the violent behavior of liberals during the 2016 election, beginning with violent protestors at Trump rallies, ramping up to the mayhem we saw in Chicago that caused Trump's rally to be shut down, to the attacks on Trump supporters in California, New Mexico, and elsewhere. I've watched a video of a woman who supports Trump be beaten in her own front yard by 2-3 Hillary goons. I've seen Democrats break down police barricades and try to storm a convention center where my fellow Trump supporters are trying to peacefully assemble. Police have been sent to the hospital trying to protect my fellow Trump supporters and their first amendment rights. Trump supporters have been beaten, had their cars smashed, had their private property and homes vandalized, and now have had their local political office firebombed. From what I understand, this is unprecedented in American history yet the news media and the Democrats continue to demonize Trump and his supporters as the second coming of Hitler as if this won't lead to disaster. In fact, Trump is blamed for the violence against his own supporters! At least 40% of this country supports Donald J. Trump for President. And that 40% is currently being beaten, firebombed, vandalized by Hillary supporters; that 40% is currently being demonized, ridiculed and hated by Hillary's media; that 40% is being marginalized and misrepresented by establishment politicians who support Hillary. The people who do that to Trump supporters are animals. That includes a lot of Reddit's circlejerk brigade that has effectively dehumanized Trump supporters, Trump's family, and Trump himself. You watch the same playbook that was used against Bernie Bro's be used to dehumanize Trump supporters and many of you believe that you have any sense of objectivity. It's disgusting.]
[The opposite of "liberal" is not "/r/The_Donald subscriber." It's a seductively easy yet damaging thing to stereotype people who don't agree with you in this manner.]
[A gofundme setup by Dems has already raised $13K of the $10K needed to repair the GOP HQ. GoFundMe: "Dems help reopen a NC Repub office"]

[Don't be violent and evil.]
[If it leads to getting the better candidate in the White House, I can look the other way at a little evil. Let's not be wussies because of a little fire. We need to be stronger together. Hillary 2016!]
[You know we can see your post history and activity on /r/The_Donald, right?]
[*defends Islam whenever terrorist attack happens*]
[*implies all muslims are terrorists*]
[*acknowledges that a large percentage of them support the attacks if in the name of allah*]
[*pretends most people living under theocratic regimes would say "I disagree with the theocracy"* I wonder how many North Korean's would say they love Kim Jong Un?]
[Wow! Yeah, they're just lying. They're actually just a bunch of hippies in burkas!]
[I have no idea how many of them are lying and neither do you. If you believe none of them are, you probably believe all North Koreans love their Dear Leader too.]
[So you can be evil, but not violent. Or violent and good? :)]
[Yes. Soldiers who invaded Germany against literal Hitler were violent and good. A deplorable racist white supremacist who lives in the woods and speaks to no one ever is evil but not violent.]
[This is a disgrace to America. I cannot believe it.]
[This is domestic terrorism, plain and simple. There is no circumstance where this is ever okay. If you know who any details about who was behind this, report it to your local branch of the FBI or your local police department.]
[We just say terrorism.]
[Terrorism is kind of a dead word. It can be applied to almost any form of aggression.]
["The use of violence and intimidation in the pursuit of political aims." We just say terrorism.]
[I don't care what your opinion is, you don't firebomb a building because you don't like someone. Fuck whoever did this.]
[The name Trump makes me literally regurgitate. But I couldn't agree with you more. I hope nobody was hurt. This is disgusting.]
[This is unacceptable and hopefully parties involved with face justice. Happy no one was injured. As a side note however, the county name is ironic in 2016.]
[No one was injured, the amateurish bomp pfizzled...sounds like drunks cooking up some Saturday night excitement for themselves. Or the alt-right hoping to set off a powderkeg. Lefties haven't firebombed anyone since the seventies.]
[That's right, friend! The left has not hurt anybody since the 70's! Only bigoted rednecks would think otherwise! Please, keep your re-education efforts going. We need great Americans like you in the fight to re-educate the bigoted, intolerant supporters of Donald Trump! Together, we can make Trump supporters see the wrongs their implicit biases are perpetuating all over the country! #Imwithher #lovetrumpshate]
[You are way over the top here. The bomb could have been set off by anybody. We will all learn the movtivations when the culprits are caught.]
[Are you somehow suggesting the party of peace is behind these heinous acts? This is /r/politics! Please consider how Hillary's tolerant, diverse campaign followers could help you understand how your implicit biases are casting a dark shadow over your view of the world, and willfully submit yourself for re-education!]
[And still over the top...]
[http://i.imgur.com/T6w4M2z.jpg]
[Could be anyone at this point, possibly BLM people as well.]
[> Or the alt-right hoping to set off a powderkeg. The last thing we need is a Trump version of the [Reichstag fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichstag_fire)]
[Someone is trying their best to whip up violence. I imagine this type of crime would get the Feds involved in the investigation. Depending on the time of the event, I expect they should be able to find the culprits fairly easily. Hillsborugh rolls up the streets early, but traffic cameras never sleep.]
[The best thing is that no one was injured. The horrible thing is that this was an affront to free speech.]
[Yes this was horrible, but free speech has nothing to do with this. Free speech means that you can't be punished by the government for what you say. Obviously whoever did this shod be held accountable but it's not getting in the way of anyone's free speech.]
[Living in a democratic society entails freedom of political opinion, and not having to be scared of your building being burned down because of the candidate you support. Fuck whoever was responsible for this, Republican or Democrat.]
[Thought it was California and read these comments confused for longer than I'd like to admit. In all seriousness fuck whoever the fuck was a part of this. You can't fucking call them nazis only to be the ones who firebomb political opponents.]
[I'm a NY Conservative and this is truly deplorable. We can't automatically jump to conclusions about who the perp(s) are. They're not necessarily Hillary supporters, Dems, or even Liberals for that matter. I don't know why we feel the need to categorize people as being on one team or the other.]
[They're going to find a person with a backwards B in her cheeck]
[I'd say it's pretty likely the work of anarchists.]
[Rational people shouldn't automatically jump to conclusions about who the perps are, but Trump totally did. https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/787782613633208320 I don't understand how anyone could feel comfortable giving him nukes.]
[Because sadly many people just want this to be "points" for their team.]
[This fucking election was depressing enough without crazy bastards firebombing buildings.]
[I think you might be more scared once you realize they're probable not crazy and are logical on their fight against what those people are doing to us.]
[As if all instances of Trump supporters getting chased/ beaten at his rallies wasn't enough already?]
[Unacceptable.]
[Completely despicable. Fuck political violence in all its forms.]
[I hope they catch the person who did this. They need to be held accountable. We can't let violence become how political disagreements are handled in this country.]
[Fucking assholes. Glad no one got hurt behind that shit.]
[And those signs are surprisingly fire-proof]
[Republicans may be my opponents - but they are not my enemy. Stand together for justice.]
[ANDERSON COOPER: Which enemy that you made during your political career are you most proud of? CLINTON: Well, in addition to the NRA, the health insurance companies, the drug companies, the Iranians; probably the Republicans.]
[Deplorable behavior from a supporter of a deplorable candidate. Why am I not surprised?]
[I think the only two in that list who would be better served by Trump are the NRA and the Republicans.]
[Jim Webb won me over with his answer.]
[is now really the time dude?]
[Why not? It illustrates the type of rhetoric that extremists cling to and justify their actions with.]
[ANDERSON COOPER: Which enemy that you made during your political career are you most proud of? CLINTON: Well, in addition to the NRA, the health insurance companies, the drug companies, the Iranians; probably the Republicans. To bad your nominee disagrees with you.]
[It's not a far leap to go from opponent to enemy. If you've come to believe that <disfavored political party> is actively seeking to harm or kill <your group> it is actually *logical* to resort to violence. Especially if you believe the law/justice system will *not* treat you fairly (but we have a *perfect*, totally fair system, right?). So which group do you think is most likely to seek justice for themselves through violence right now? Which group is being treated unfairly by the justice system? Which group has very little representation in government? I'm not going to point fingers. I'm going to continue to warn people about what happens when inequality grows. This article is just the tip of the iceberg of what could sink this country into another age of civil unrest.]
[Ok let's talk. If the blacks rebelled and started burning their towns more often than they already do. Then it would be very bad for black people. It wouldn't help them in any way. Torching businesses in their own towns has never helped the black community. If an outright civil war broke out say Democrats vs Republicans. The Republicans would likely have more guns and more military members on their side. The Democrats would likely get slaughtered.]
[Nah, the Democrats actually know how to use technology. The Republicans would surrender after their 900th defeat from, "Hi this is tech support" call. The average age of Republicans is *over 60*!]
[Haha good point. It just seems like the pro-gun, pro-military party would have the upper hand in a fight.]
[But we have the [vegans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqqGZBRBLcM)]
[I do not condone, endorse or recommend violence. We have a system where we vote, not bomb, to change things. That said, yes the Republicans are my enemy. Is it worse to bomb an empty room than it is to pass laws to imprison me for my existence as a gay man, as Pence has tried to do? To draw funding away from HIV/AIDS, causing harm to others, so he can divert it to sick torturous conversion therapies? To make it legal to discriminate against me nationwide and remove my legal recourse? Yes, the GOP IS my enemy and tries to do more harm to more people than that firebomb ever could. Yes, I put both the firebomber, whatever party they may think they belong to, and the GOP on the same level -and I do not endorse either.]
[Disgusting behavior. This is no way to resolve our differences.]
[What is wrong with people? That is terrorism, pure and simple. Really hope this isn't a sign of things to come with election.]
[Take a look at the comments here. Leftists, not sure shills or not, are denying that Trump or his views got smeared in any way and then in the next sentence there's the same "sexually assaulting dictator" slander which further invites violence toward him and his supporters. I think things are going to get very nasty.]
[I have no idea what comment section you're reading, because all the Clinton supporters who are actually getting upvoted are condemning this terrorist attack, but are upset because Trump has publicly blamed the attack on the Clinton Campaign itself. As for the violence thing, it is not as though Trump hasn't tried to subtly incite his supporters twoards violence. Offering to pay the legal fees of anyone at his rallies who assaults the protesters at his rallies, instructing his supporters to punch protesters at his rallies, and suggesting that after the election the second amendment people might have to, "take care of Hillary." None of Hillary's rhetoric has come nearly so close to inciting violence twoards Trump. If anything, the things he has said about * African Americans -- "they're living in hell", something Bernie Sanders got in trouble for saying during the primary, though he phrased it as, 'living in ghettos.' Here's a [source](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/10/trump-african-american-inner-city/503744/) refuting that. * Latinos -- "When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best...They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists." From the[ Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/07/02/surprise-donald-trump-is-wrong-about-immigrants-and-crime/), which does lean left, but presents some interesting statistics about immigrants and crime in the US. * Muslims -- They're all terrorists, and they all have to be stopped from coming into the country. Furthermore, his most recent stance is this, ' ["He has said he has changed, and he has put that position on the table and that is his position. It is not a religious test. It is a ban on immigration from countries that harbor or train terrorists," RNC Chair Priebus said on CNN earlier this month.'](http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/24/politics/donald-trump-muslim-ban-election-2016/) Then you had best ban immigration from all countries, because as [globalresearch](http://www.globalresearch.ca/non-muslims-carried-out-more-than-90-of-all-terrorist-attacks-in-america/5333619) shows, there are even Jewish extremists in the US. More so than Islamic extremists. have led to attacks against him, by people with little to no actual power. The attack is inexcusable, as is any attack on anyone for political affiliation. Donald Trump's rhetoric is not nearly as bad a thing, but the things it can cause people to do, could be far worse. For example: ["Dr. Tiller the Baby Killer."](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jun/05/bill-oreilly/bill-oreilly-called-george-tiller-baby-killer/) Rhetoric on Fox news spoke of him so horribly and repeatedly that someone went into his church during service and shot him. Specifically, on the O'Rielly Factor. Talk is cheap, but it causes action. All the media has done is cover Donald Trump, the things he's said, and the things he's done. Absent almost all of the time are the speeches Hillary Clinton gives. Except the one time she said half of Trump supporters were deplorable. The only person smearing Donald Trump, is Donald Trump. Edit: Added the link to the CNN Article I got the Priebus quote from, encase you wanted to read that.]
["Absent almost all of the time are the speeches Hillary Clinton gives." I'm sure we'd love some of her $250K speeches and what they promise.]
[It's not terrorism. It's politics. Sometimes politics gets a little ugly. If it leads to Hillary getting into the White House, I'm happy to ignore a few minor events like this. A few firebombings are better than Trump winning right?]
[> A few firebombings are better than Trump winning right? I detest Trump with every fiber of my being, but I will never sign on to this as an appropriate action.]
[It's expected when you see rhetoric like this http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/10316186]
[> Really hope this isn't a sign of things to come http://imgur.com/gallery/44jJY www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMux_UHmpvc]
[Mob mentality brings out the worst in all people. I could link an equally manipulative video of Trump supporters being violent and "us" being on the "right side," too, but that's not what the violence is about.]
[Shit, this is awful. I'm glad no one was killed. Trump blaming Hillary Clinton supporters is not helpful; all Americans should be outraged, Republican or Democrat or none of the above. Whatever our political differences might be, politically-motivated violence against any of us is an attack on all of us. It strikes at the very heart of Democracy, and it must not be tolerated.]
[I think it's quite clear these people committed this act to attack Trump - and, unless they're big Gary Johnson advocates, I would bet their support leans toward Hillary.]
[But we live in a two-party system, so that doesn't actually mean as much as it sounds like it means. This attack was not something that Hillary Clinton did herself. It also was not something that was done by the Hillary Clinton campaign. It may well have been done by some fringe, radical group that prefers Clinton over Trump, but to link that all the way back to the 45-49% of the voting population that supports Hillary without any kind of evidence is absurd. If anything, the suggestion that anything about this was in any way instigated by anyone even tangentially related to Clinton harms her a lot more than the associated property damage and psychological intimidation harm Trump.]
[We had the San Jose "incident" that no one wanted call it for what it was. I do blame the Hillary supporters, but I put more blame on the media for creating this environment of terror.]
[Ok - then we agree. MSM is more responsible than Hillary supporters. If this were Trump, however, the media would relentlessly cast his supporters as evil.]
[No freggin kidding, we're living in a Twilight Zone until the end of the Election.]
[Absolutely horrible. Violence should have no place in modern politics.]
[Just as it was with attacks on abortion clinics and other political attacks we should never blame those who speak for their political agenda but those who take actions that run counter to democracy.]
[That's so crazy. Definitely happy nobody was killed and hope that whoever did it is found and fully prosecuted. Violence has no place in our electoral process. It's one of the things that separates us from many other countries.]
[They are no longer taking donations, but a group of democrats in NC put together a gofundme to help them reopen, they raised $13,000 in about 4 hours (which, I guess, is enough to get the office up and rolling again). If we (the democrats) win, it should be on the strength of our ideas and our beliefs, not because we made people afraid to vote their consciences. I hope they're open again soon. This act is absolutely anti-American. ~~https://www.gofundme.com/reopen-a-nc-republican-office-2ukuprzy?stop=1~~ Edit: crossed out link. It's not active, but if you want to see the page I referenced, you can see it here.]

[Someone just left their Samsung plugged in. /s]
[Not cool]
[Hot]
[R/toosoon]
[This is wrong. This is also stupid. Way to hurt your own cause guys. Disgusting. Glad no one was hurt.]
[You dont even know who's cause it was. This could have been any one of many groups. Jews, hillary supporters, and trump supporters all have reasons to hate the guy. edit: It could have been a leftist because they hate the party. : It could be a jew because of the conspiracy shit trump has been spouting about international banker cabals. It could be a trump supporter to generate condemnation towards hillary in a state that looks to be very close.]
[I suspect this was done by an asshole. Their party affiliation is irrelevant.]
[Soooooooo... Who thinks Trump arranged It? Make Democrats look like animals? I'm leaning towards Trump's involvement....]
[Lol this is a perfect example of people trying to ignore the truth and bend it to their political agenda. Basically you're a fucken idiot.]
[What is this objective truth being ignored?]
[....to bend information to fit a political agenda, as stated]
[You are saying people are ignoring the truth in order to bend info. What is the truth that is being ignored in order to bend information to fit a political agenda?]
[The truth is that there has been an unprecedented amount of psychological and physical violence against Trump supporters. Yet all of it is ignored by the media and the general left. The apparent line in the sand is fire bombing. This act of terror cannot be ignored, and it is the result of an escalating violent creed against the opposing argument. The truth is that had this act of terror been on a democrat headquarters, we would see an even greater surge in the anti Trump rhetoric, and the left would not be stating that party affiliation doesn't matter. Edit: and just to clarify, these have been responses to an initial comment that insinuated Trumps involvement in this horrific act. That is a blatant attempt to bend truth to fit a narrative.]
[Yeah. This is totally NOT something Trump would do.]
[Correct.]
[So out of the realm of possibility!]
[You got it!]
[So Trump is a beacon of morality.]
[You're putting together all the pieces tonight! Your mother would be proud!]
[Will you admit that at least on camera there is more evidence of how dirty anti trump people can be?]
[Who in this thread has denied that there are assholes in every party?]
[And only assholes will disagree with you.]
[And yet if a Democratic office was firebombed, there is 0% chance you would be saying "Their party affiliation is irrelevant."]
[I am a liberal and would say it's irrelevent either way. Most people on either side would because most people realize every party has fucked up assholes.]
[Interesting how the affiliation is irrelevant when it looks like an attack carried out by anti-Trump Dems, yet if this were to happen to a Dem HQ, all Trump supporters would be painted as evil, racist, homophobe, cis-genders for weeks. Let's get real, people.]
[Party affiliation only seems to be irrelevant when the likely culprits are Democrats. Strange how that works.]
[How would party affiliation be relevant even if it was a bombing of a Democratic building? It isn't. These are terrorist assholes and are codomened by both parties.]
[Come on now, despite this being condemned by both sides, you know how this would be spun by the media had this been the other way around. That's the only point @drunkcaliban is making.]
[But there's no mention of the media in the thread, just a single reddit user's opinion.]
[If this happened at a Democratic headquarters, you know the media would blame this on "violent racist Trump supporters."]
[Those three guys planning to bomb the immigrants are all violent racist trump supporters (despite them not actually having expressed such sentiments yet).]
[As a liberal, here's my take: If conservatives did this, I'll be pissed. If liberals did this I'll be fucking livid.]
[I'll be livid either way.]
[I see.]
[As a human being I fully renounce ANY and ALL violence for any reason from any side. This is NOT the answer. Ever. We can work together and remain civil.]
[This is unacceptable. Not only could someone have been killed in truly terrible manner, but rule of law must be respected and recognized by everyone or else we're going to end up in a state of chaos. The elections are not rigged. It is not okay to use violence against those you disagree with. We have a system to let your voice be heard. Is it perfect? No, but it's what we all must adhere to.]
[So people of every stripe can turn out to be fuckers. The frustration and fear can drive people with otherwise reasonable backgrounds to get scary and less reasonable people to be downright fucking evil. So this absolutely could have been done by someone who actually doesn't like Republicans and is or leans democrat. Totally on the table. But I also remember the 2008 election. I lived in Pittsburgh then, and have strong memories of the girl there who said she was held up at an ATM and then the black man who she said held her up saw she had a McCain sticker on her car, she said he carved a B for Barack in her face (but backwards). This all turned out to be pure fiction, and she did it to herself (backwards B because she did it in a mirror and wasn't the smartest cookie, because carving a letter in her own damn face) to try to influence the election by inventing a barbarous nature for Obama supporters. So in the end, there are three really important things to remember. First, I think everyone in the room that most of us give a shit about agree that actions like this are completely unacceptable. Violence has no place in the political process. Period. Second, there is no true Scotsman, and someone who otherwise completely agrees with you on policy could do this, regardless of which side of the aisle you fall on. And third, the best thing we can all do (other than remind everyone that this should not be a part of our political process and if you know something about this tell the authorities) is wait for the police and FBI to do their thing, because it really could be what it looks like, and it really might be something else, and until someone on the ground with all the facts weighs in, it's all speculation.]
[Agreed, on all points.]
[I grew up in Hillsborough. I would not be surprised if this was done by some bored teenagers. Seriously. There is nothing to do in Hillsborough.]
[Or bored Duke/UNC People]
[To be so bored you leave chapel hill or Durham and travel to Hillsborough is a boredom I hope to never have.]
[Hey man, the Daniel Boone Village (if it still exists) is/was a thrilling tourist-trap antique mall.]
[Are there even any democrats there? It's North Carolina and not Raleigh.]
[With that logic you'll find nothing but hardcore Trump supporters in Carrboro and Asheville, because after all, its not Raleigh.]
[Funny you say that. UNC/Duke are usually stereotyped for the liberals whereas NC State gets the reputation of the redneck school, and it's in Raleigh.]
[You need to be up-voted for perspective and not turning this into something bigger than it needs to be. The last thing we want is people getting upset and having more of this.]
[I live in Orange County (rural area between Hillsborough and Durham). All day today, someone near my house was shooting at targets. Honestly that's not super uncommon, so I hope it's not as really as weird as this kind of news makes it feel.]
[I went to elementary school in Hillsborough, and I remember one Halloween some teens set the wreath on our front door on fire, so I guess that's some anecdotal evidence to support your theory.]
[New Hope?]
[Grady A Brown K-4, New Hope most of 5th]
[We live in Hillsborough now. This is a pretty brazen act - a Molotov Cocktail through the window, and the graffiti make me think immaturity, but not youth. I'm just shocked it didn't cause more damage - from what I read it was discovered this morning, and could have easily burned down the other buildings there.]
[Some teens burned down a church and spray painted pentagrams on it. Like a few miles from cedar ridge when I was a student there. Maybe that's why this doesn't surprise me.]
[Oh, crazy. Well then I defer to you for the level of teen activity.]
[Fuck this shit. Fuck whoever did this. Fucking wreck these terrorist fucking assholes.]
[Maybe everyone should calm down? Your response just adds angry outrage to the angry outrage. Enough already. Obviously this is a bad act and whoever did it should be found, arrested, and prosecuted. Fomenting more rage doesn't help.]
[Ballots, not bullets -- regardless of your political views.]
[Oh man if this was a democrat HQ firebombed by a republican there would be an even bigger shitstorm in the media and this subbreddit and Trump would officially be even more done than he already is]
[Most likely, republican did it to cast doubt on dems]
[Not likely. As a failed developer, Trump would know how to properly burn down a building. This is farr too amateurish to be Trump's work.]
[He didn't say Trump personally.]
[Idk I wouldn't rule it out but BLM burns down their own neighborhoods and they seem like the type of people to do this. Not suggesting it was BLM by any means it just seems like their type of radical social justice warrior would do something like this]
[BLM firebombing? Get real. In fact, when have you ever heard of black people or any minority firebombing anything? Especially in the **SOUTH**. Get real. And "Nazi Republicans, get out or else". Blacks don't even talk that. This was an inside job.]
[> when have you ever heard of black people or any minority firebombing anything? Well they do like to set their own neighborhoods on fire especially in Baltimore https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUB5N-OeTTs I think you need to get real m8 the only people who have been setting shit on fire during riots in the past year have been black people and minorities.

[We don't know who did this criminal act.]
[[deleted]]
[> I think we can all agree this is the most pathetic thing we have seen all election No it isn't. Trump's entire year on the other hand... This? This is what happens when democracies decay. But then again, so is Trump Edit: People who think this society is trending towards "justice and peace" aren't paying attention. The future is fucking bleak and 2016 is only the beginning.]
[This is what happens when Hillary calls Trump supporters "deplorable". Will she call the people behind this "deplorable"?]
[They are deplorable. If you want to know why people fucking hate you maybe you should look in a mirror instead of demanding the world kiss your ass. Trump's candidacy is a middle finger to human equality. Never mind human rights law and civil liberties. So yeah, don't expect me to start blaming Clinton for people hating the fuck out of Trump.]
[Yeah middle finger to human equality, the same way Hillary takes money from countries that stone women to death, drown women to death, throw LGBT out of buildings, put children into sex trafficking. She is ok with abortion which is the modern day holocaust and kills more black lives than anything else. She can care less about Human Rights, get your facts straight.]
[Again, mindless conspiracy theory, blown out of proportion, or flat out bullshit. Trump has said he wants to torture people for the fun of it. That's not a theory, that's fact. He said that. It came out of his mouth. Fuck him. Also "abortion is a modern day holocaust"? Oh you're one of those types... If there is a god the entire church is going to hell. I firmly believe this. The only god I could ever believe in is a vengeful one, and he will thrust the spineless hypocrites of America into the fire. And if he bestows his grace upon me I'll get to look down and laugh.]
[So edgy, your comments are hilarious]
[The only hypocrites are you Hillary supporters who claim you are for Women Rights, LGBT, Black lives yet you support someone who refuses to condone Radical Islam and takes money from countries where Women, Children, LGBT are treated worse than anywhere in the World, and more Black lives are destroyed at Abortion Clinics than anything else. None of you are for LGBT, Women, or Children, if you support Hillary, all a bunch of hypocrites. She is ok with refugees and illegals coming into this country and raping women, but she is for womens rights? GET REAL]
[Lol. Man, you have literally no idea what my politics are do you? Or even what your own candidate believes?]
[Yeah democracy decays? Like how Hillary is given veto power from news articles, is given questions before debates, get your facts straight.]
[Clinton is a politician. Trump is a sniveling fascistic lunatic who's exploiting people's hatred to further his own ambitions and who is in the process of deligitimizing the very basis of American democracy. If anybody dies in this election it is his fault. Well, him and the racist lunatics who love him. Everything else you wrote is bullshit conspiracy theory or at the very least blown out of proportion. So don't give me that shit. Your candidate is an insult to human intelligence and a danger to human life.]
[Who hurt you?]
[About 40% of America. By existing.]
[You should take a walk. It sounds like you need a break from all this.]
[Most pathetic? Nah. Your candidate has that title.]
[Care to explain.]
[[TRUMP: I'll consider paying legal fees for the man who allegedly threw a sucker punch at one of my rallies](http://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-legal-fees-punch-protester-2016-3) He has openly encouraged people at his rallies to be aggressive to protestors and even going as far as considering suggesting he would pay legal fees. That is one of the most pathetic things this election cycle. The events in NC are awful and should be condemned by both parties; instead we get finger pointing from Trump who has no idea who it was. That is also pretty pathetic.]
[Hillary has yet to condone any of the attacks that Trump supporters have received over the last couple months, she increased tensions by calling Trump Supporters deplorable, and currently all she has is a tweet, she should be addressing this in the public, this was done by her supporters, this was a terrorist attack.]
[> Care to explain. It's amazing to me that Trump supporters have learned the art of deflection, just like Trump himself. You ask for an explanation and instead of addressing what I bring up you deflect to Hillary did this and hasn't done that. You have no excuse for your candidate's behavior so you deflect. And you use your words, "Hillary has yet to condone any of the attacks Trump supporters have received over the last couple months." How about this one: [“I condemn all violence in our political arena,” Clinton told CNN’s Jake Tapper in an interview broadcast Friday. “I condemned it when Donald Trump was inciting it and congratulating people who were engaging in it. I condemn it by those who are taking violent protests to physical assault against Donald Trump.” - June 2016](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/06/clinton-trump-rally-violence-223885) And yes, the racist, xenophobic, and sexist supporters are deplorable. edit: obviously you don't have a response; typical Trump supporter. Only hear what you want to hear.]
[Coming from the one that supports a woman blaming Russia for hacking her along with a huge right wing conspiracy and a racist frog. Clinton is by far one of the most pathetic political candidates ever.]
[> supports a woman blaming Russia for hacking Ummmm, you realize the intelligence community has openly acknowledged this. > along with a huge right wing conspiracy Ummmm, Trump has been on a conspiracy theory rant this entire election cycle; even more recently since he is now losing. > and a racist frog Care to explain why so many Trump supporters reference pepe the frog? I would love to know.]
[Because it started as just a meme but some news sights saw trump supporters like from /r/the_donald using it and decided to claim it is a hate symbol and CNN even made one up that had no related images on Google reverse image search. Now it's really just a symbol of how horrible and biased our media is now and on top of that Hillary mentioning it in a speech shows how out of touch she is. Edit: Trump also retweeted a picture of a Pepe a while back]
[> on top of that Hillary mentioning it in a speech shows how out of touch she is. You think someone is out of touch because they don't know who Pepe the frog is? Come on, that is absurd. I spend *way* too much time on reddit and I have no idea who Pepe the frog is. Also, your argument doesn't hold water: [ADL Joins With “Pepe” Creator Matt Furie in Social Media Campaign to #SavePepe](http://www.adl.org/press-center/press-releases/extremism/adl-joins-with-pepe-the-frog-creator-social-media-campaign-save-pepe.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/). When you have the original creator coming out and saying it's racist you have a problem with the image. > New York, NY, October 14, 2016 … The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) is joining forces with the artist who created “Pepe the Frog” in an effort to take back the popular internet meme from racists and use the frog’s likeness as a force for good. Trump tweets a lot of bullshit he shouldn't be saying; just because he retweeted a picture of Pepe a while back doesn't justify it.]
[But the thing is it isn't racist and never was. I mean sure 4chan made a few photoshpps of it as Hitler but that was long before the media decided to call it a hate symbol. And again, CNN posted a picture of Pepe dressed up like a kkk member as an example but they made it themselves. This is just the media trying to manipulate people and take stories that will bring in a lot of revenue.]
[> This is just the media trying to manipulate people and take stories that will bring in a lot of revenue. Honestly, Trump is providing enough bullshit stories to bring in revenue; Pepe the frog is a minor blip in the revenue stream -- if any. I agree that maybe Pepe the frog has been taken out of context, but I don't think being out of touch involves not knowing who Pepe the frog is. However, when the original creator of Pepe thinks it is a racist symbol and doesn't want it portrayed as that, then you have a serious problem with your argument.]
[So you are saying Donald Trump is worse than an act of domestic terrorism? LOL]
[Your saviour and hero has already jumped to his conclusion. Is that the kind of guy you want with the nuclear launch codes?]
[Yeah like when Trump called the NYC terrorist attack a bomb, only for Hillary to say it was a bomb and then criticize Trump 30 seconds later for calling it a bomb.]
[Pathetic? Yes. *Most pathetic?*. Well, I don't quite agree with you there... this election is a parade of nonstop, mind-numbingly pathetic things. It's hard to say. The bar is so, so low now, and getting lower with each daily news cycle.]
[See comments like this make you question people, this is a terrorist attack, NOTHING, absolutely nothing can be compared to what took place in North Carolina. Its sad that anyone would try to say there has been something more pathetic than a terrorist attack on a political parties headquarter.]
[No one died in this case, how ever most Trump rallies have been violent, with many people getting actually injured for simply attending a political rally. Heck, there have been multiple rallies where police intervened by escorting people into and out of the building, but not far enough to ensure they weren't bashed. I would call those moments truly pathetic, and a lot more damaging to a great nation than just a building getting burnt down. I have never felt so sad at what humanity became, when I saw such incidents unfold. Both are terrible, but I believe human... or I suppose they are deplorable, nazi, zenophobic, homophobic, sexist, etc. now... should matter more than a building.]
[I think you can argue that the averted terrorist attack that would have killed hundreds of refugees was equally pathetic.]
[I agree with you, I am glad the FBI intervened before it happened.]
[C'mon dude.]
[You should really remember all of your comments are public.]
[As a Clinton supporter, I really respect this. If our positions were reversed, I'd hope to show as much thoughtful restraint.]
[I'm glad that no one was hurt. I've been extremely worried about violence this election for a while. This particular election has been more divisive than most. We need to unite against this kind of thing regardless of which party is the target and which party is the perpetrator. No matter which party or candidate you support, you most likely have loved ones on the other "side". This benefits no one and puts everyone at risk.]

[I don't care if you're republican, democratic, independent, or alien...this kind of behavior is unacceptable. This person needs to be found, prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, and jailed.]
[Trump has already blamed Clinton supporters for this on twitter.]
[This is horrible and I hope whoever did it gets caught. That being said you should see some of the comments on the bottom of the page. A few examples; >They'll stop rioting when we start shooting them for rioting. >No doubt thug democrats for hitlery. Probably black lives negros >Rioters, looters and arsonists should be shot on sight. This isn't helping anyone. *edit added examples]
[When you call someone Nazi for differing views, then you are inciting a racial war. Yes it is bad to respond but the first one to throw the punch deserves the blame.]
[So much for "pc culture = bad". Since when did name calling make violence acceptable?]
[What? Politically correct culture is bad. And I am not with that side of liberal ignorance to try and kill someone with different views than you. Nice try]
[Yeah cause no fucked up Republicans have tried to kill others with different views....read a book]
[then maybe trumpters should stop acting like fucking nazis]
[thank you, you just proved my point. I wish you all the best with the hatred within your heart.]
[Trump supporters are literally bringing swastikas to rallies.]
[I saw no swastikas or any Nazi paraphernalia. We were searched pretty thoroughly. i did see several dozen liberal protesters throwing shit and spitting on people. Seems like the latter would be the ones sporting the symbol of the Reich.]
[One or two out of a million rally attendants, and they were not welcomed by the other supporters attending. Don't act like all Trump supporters are Nazis, that's what leads to acts like this.]
[thank you. I wish you all the best with your generalization with no evidence. With your logic Hillary supporters are actually trying to kill people... No which one is worse; words or actions? Checkmate]
[Any source? I would genuinely like to now if you're just saying words for words sake.]
[[Probably what he's referring to](http://www.politicususa.com/2016/10/13/trump-supporter-terrorize-press-swastika-swastika-wrong.html). Definitely not a general thing.]

[I was just asking for a source of his accusations. But of course, there are radicals on both sides of the political spectrum.]
[Saying disgusting things about minorities when running for president was throwing the first punch. Just because views are diffeent doesn't mean they're valid, not bigoted or backed up by any facts]
[What did he say about minorities? He said some South Americans that are in this country illegally are rapists and murderers, he said some muslims become muslim extremists, and blacks and latinos live in ghetto filled environments where they can be shot anyday. All of that is true and I can give you facts as well. Heck look at WikiLeaks and Hillary Clinton and her campaign admitted these were true but have to lie to get people not to vote for Donald. Those emails are so nice to help prove my point with the truth.]
[I don't know who threw the first stone but they don't represent me. They don't represent all black people, all liberals, all anything. They only represent themselves. As the people in the comments don't represent all southerners or all conservatives.]
[So? There are idiot commenters everywhere. Try reading the Dailykos comments on the story - it's all false flag, Reichstag, civil war, red states about to declare martial law if Trump is losing, etc. Just loony. http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2016/10/16/1583297/-GOP-office-in-NC-firebombed-Trump-responds-about-as-you-d-expect And as always when something like this happens, rather than focus on the act itself (since there is a good chance it was carried out by a lefty), they save their hate for the GOP reaction to the act.]
[It could have also easily been someone who wanted to frame it to look like crazy left-liberals.]
[we need to out those who do this violent rethoric regardless of party and show them what they say and do is NOT acceptible.]
[Yes and look at the comments in this thread. https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/57r65t/vote_house_republicans_out/ You have stuff just as bad, if not worse at 10 times the rate and gilded. In fact you have people saying "Crazy Republican False Flag" in this thread that are being highly upvoted.]
[Do you know who did it?]
[Do you know who did it? Or would you like to join the jackasses screaming REICHSTAG!!!1111 https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/57t3b1/republican_hq_in_orange_county_firebombed/d8uucb2?context=3 OH WAIT YOU ALREADY DID.]
[Awww... It got emotional. Sowwy to have hurt your oppressed liddle feeewings.]
[Was this supposed to be an intelligent rebuttal?]
[Well of course not. Sorry if you couldn't tell. But to be fair, neither was yours. Let me also make this simply clear ...whoever did it, is dumb beyond belief and obviously the actions are ridiculous. No one can or should condone these types of actions. Let me ask you this. In all honesty, given everything Trump has said/is saying during this election cycle, the tone of his entire campaign and given the "high energy" passions of his supporters, would *you* be surprised if it did turn out to be a couple of Republicans?]
[> Let me ask you this. In all honesty, given everything Trump has said/is saying during this election cycle, the tone of his entire campaign and given the "high energy" passions of his supporters, would you be surprised if it did turn out to be a couple of Republicans? I can ask you the same question of Hillary. Unlike you I hate both of them for being disgusting big government demagogues. I wouldn't be surprised if it was republicans, but i've been following the election for ever a year and I'd be even more surprised if it wasn't democrats/leftists. Hillary and the Media can only go so many months of calling people the enemy, deplorable, racist, sexist etc before someone is going to act. On top of that the left this election has a history of violence toward the right, a lot of video and picture evidence. Both sides are garbage.]
[I too am not a fan of either candidate. But you didn't answer my question. Nevermind.]
[> I wouldn't be surprised if it was republicans I guess you like stopped reading after the first sentence? Would you be surprised if it was democrats?]
[I'm gonna go with no. Definitely no.]
[Classy.]
[Are you actually defending the idea that this is a false flag? I personally, as a democrat, would like it if a DNC building was fire bombed for republicans to be good people and not accuse us of falseflagging. Live by the golden rule: do unto others as you would have done unto you. I doubt you'd appreciate to be on the receiving end, so don't be on the giving end.]
[No, not a false flag. You do realize there are more than 2 sides, right?]
[The only highly upvoted ones in this thread I've seen are ones who are merely not discounting the possibility of it being a "false flag" operation. Certainly not "Crazy Republican False Flag". In fact, I just searched the phrase and literally the only time it was mentioned in the thread was by you. I would be interested in seeing the comments that are "as bad, if not worse" that are gilded. In fact, the most highly upvoted parts of that thread are people complaining about the left-leaning bias of /r/politics. I see nothing even remotely highly upvoted that is even close to as bad as using racial name-calling or saying that people should be shot on sight.]
[https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/57t3b1/republican_hq_in_orange_county_firebombed/d8uvek4 yeah totally the only ones. You just ignored the gilded one in the top comment chain. Lmao.]
[Eh, that comment suggests that it could be anti-GOP coming from the far right, not really a false flag. The comment beneath it that makes clear the left should be held responsible if guilty is gilded, too. I think it seems the majority of people here are against this act regardless of who committed it.]
[Yeah it was a trump supporter that burned down a building that supports trump!!!! Gimme a fucking break. Maybe take a look at how disgusting /r/politics actually is. That even when Trump supporters get firebombed, it's somehow trumps fault.]
[Trump has a lot of shitty things to say about the Republican Party, and vice versa. He is the candidate but that doesn't mean that they have a good relationship. I'm not saying it's a trump supporter but it being a Republican building doesn't rule that out.]
[All the false flag comments have people pointing out how stupid that is, so I honestly don't know what you're talking about.]
[Dude, why did you even bother posting this. Just downvote those comments and don't bring attention to them. This about a case of arson that could have endangered people's lives. Don't try to skew this to make dumb republicans look dumb.]
[what exactly is the problem with making dumb [anything] look like dumb [anything]?]
[You can't downvote local newspaper comments.]
[Thank you for providing examples so I don't have to go digging through the muck to find them myself.]
[There is no place in our society for this.]
[And where was this response when Anti-trump ~~demonstrators~~ rioters attacked people outside rallies en-masse? I recall more "they incited it!" than "how could they do such a horrible thing".]

[That's as wrong as firebombing an abortion clinic.]
[I agree. A Planned Parenthood in my area was targeted for arson a little over a year ago, and while it was believed to be a politically motivated crime, no one was ever caught. I believe that's what may happen here - and there will only result blame and finger pointing and politicization.]

And cellphone location history. [You would be surprised what an iPhone you carry around everywhere records about where you were.](http://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-see-your-iphone-location-history-2015-11) See if anyone activated any nearby wifi networks. Stuff like that. [It really is very precise.](http://i.imgur.com/lp0zd1R.jpg) There was definitely some spray paint used and possibly a fire accelerant. Someone either already had what was needed or bought it recently. Stores have cameras if it was recently, there's all that metadata, police stuff that took weeks of painstaking legwork and lots of interviews can be done by getting some surveillance video and a request to a local ISP and phone company for their records on day one. If someone has stuff still at home or in their car, or if it's found in a location that seems like an odd place for someone to have been in (seriously, your phones will just blab and blab), then it's just Amateur Hour. The old fashioned stuff works too... a person questioned includes details that aren't possible, that opens up a whole new can of worms. I'm enthralled by it all. The suspense is killing me. I hope it will last.]
[I hope they find out... what would it indicate if they didn't?]
[Either that it was people on the left , or people on the right, or a crazy person, or spontaneous human combustion. Am I allowed to say that? "People", just using the plural like that? I'm putting my money on Keith from The Prodigy. I have his confession on tape. And CD. The Fat Of The Land, 1996, track 8. TL;DR - solving the case in typical Reddit fashion is about as stupid as my answers tonight. There will be an investigation. I want the perpetrator or perpetrators to face the full force of the American justice system.]
[Wow, just checked it out. That's a tough one for him to get out of. He literally says "I'm the fire starter". Very damning.]
[If it was someone from inside the building, would it be harder for police to find out? Would it be easier to make it a cover up?]
[Now I'm just hypothetically shooting the shit but here goes. If the office had wifi, and if the responsible party had logged in beforehand and (like most people) had their phone auto-connect, to networks then the ISP would have a record of any data sent to that phone through that internet connection. Location service via wifi, email ping, auto check for software updates. Just one is a breadcrumb. Plus: iPhones (for example) keep a running log of the phone location as a default in the Security part of Settings. So if a person said they were somewhere else at X o'clock but their phone data puts them at the scene instead, they're the lead suspect. And if there was just one person that had either a phone, or a vehicle with some form of "press a button to call for service", well this person is already known to police. [It's not entirely clear if just having a car with a GPS has already given the game away or not but one manufacturer has already said they know how you're driving.](http://www.cnbc.com/2014/01/09/ford-we-can-use-gps-to-track-your-car-movements.html) But that's a real possibility right now: police could already know who was there, and they're just letting people incriminate themselves enough to build a case.]
[All this does is make things worse for everyone. There is no room for these kind of acts in our society.]
[I don't think those on the left should be speculating about a false flag attack right now. They should denounce violent rhetoric, and make sure that attacks like this that are violent and reprehensible should not be carried out by anyone. We need to be the party of sanity this election, not conspiracy. There's enough of that already...]
[Bombs solve nothing. source: grew up in IRA bombing Ireland. Indiscriminate killing not a brand attribute one should embrace. it's not sustainable!]
[I'm jumping in to condemn this action, and whoever did it. Terrorism has no place in elections. Whoever did this, either a crazy Hillary supporter or a Trump supporter, trying to make Hillary look bad, I condem you. You have no place in the sane world.]
[Or a trump supporter pissed at the republican party for recently trying to distance themselves from him. Or a regular republican pissed at the republican party for not distancing themselves enough. Or radical "social justice" group pissed at the general bigotry that tends to come out of the party, acting outside any other political motivation.]
[Or a bored teenager, trying to be cool. Vote on Nov. 8th. That is the way to make your voice heard. Violence is never the answer.]
[I hope they catch the perpetrators and send them to prison for very long time. This was an act of terrorism.]
[Nah, maybe 2 years probation and restitution for this act would be more appropriate. Our country needs to get out of the business of public housing in prison.]
[But it's also ultimately just property damage. Nobody was actually hurt..]
[This is an absolute outrage and has no place in politics. I hope the culprits are brought to justice and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. This is the kind of shit we are worried about Trumpians carrying out and then it appears some leftist did this? This is intolerable.]
[This is intolerable, cowardly, and incredibly dangerous. I honestly don't care what the political leanings of the perpetrator are - the moment they did this, they fouled an already volatile political atmosphere with needless violence. I hope they're brought to justice quickly.]
[People in this sub twisting the facts to accomodate their own agenda are despicable.]
[This is a tragedy and it is democracy who suffers the most. Speaking as an anti-Trumper, I sincerely hope the Republicans in that area are not intimidated. That's not democracy, it's cowardly BS. (And let's not talk of false flags. This is intimidation plain and simple regardless of where it comes from - and we know who it comes from - a nutcase! Let the investigation get to the bottom of this quickly and safely, I hope.)]
[I work in the Democratic office in the same county. We had to close early today because there were threats of retribution. If the folks who firebombed the Republican office did it because they some how think they are helping they're wrong. All they did was endanger people's lives, waist our time, and scare both Democrats and Republicans shitless. This election sucks but we're better than this.]
[I don't think you are. There is case after case of people that lean left getting violent and destroying private property when they don't get their way.]
[You are right. This is an attack on democracy itself. No one should condone this kind of actions.]
[Everyone in this thread: >I'm X and even I don't think this is right Wow how brave and controversial]
[This is disgusting. Regardless of how much I despise the GOP and everything it stands for, nobody deserves to be the victim of violence over their political affiliation.]
["Regardless of how much I despise the GOP and everything it stands for" And here we go with the hate filled leftist talking points. This is exactly the tone and style that comes from liberals which incite this type of violence. How many victims of left wing anger have to die before liberals are held accountable?]
[And you don't think it's also a conservative thing as well? Both sides have people talking shit.]
[> nobody deserves to be the victim of violence over their political affiliation. What about ISIS, or literal Nazis in the 1940's? If a politician or someone running for office were to call for the extermination of a group of innocent people, would they be a valid target? What if you're not that person, but helping that person's campaign? I'm not metaphorically talking about trump or Republicans, but just asking if there is a line that can be crossed. Would you go back in time and shoot baby Hitler? Or is all violence wrong always?]
[the GOP as a whole doesn't really stand for anything specific. It's a huge grab-bag of different philosophies and sub-groups from Libertarians to paleo-conservatives to fiscal conservatives. I'm right-wing and I dislike anti-gay religious conservatism as much as you, in all likelihood.]
[Same, I am fiscally conservative and socially liberal. Free market and free everything is my political affiliation]
[libertarian position is best position. More freedom for everyone!]
[Milton Friedman is my inspiration, dudes a genius I watched a bunch of his speechs and he really brought me over to the libertarian side, I just wish the Republican Party could return to its roots and be more libertarian]
[agreed, the GOP has been too aggressive in chasing down the evangelical vote and has abandoned fiscal conservatism in favour of zealotry. Hopefully Trump will be the beginning of the reversal of that trend.]
[What is happening to this country? The hateful rhetoric from our leaders has consequences. I hope this wakes some people up and they come to their senses. Edit: Unfortunately I think this will fuel the "rigged election" narrative.]
[Not trying to beat a dead horse but damn Bernie could have handled an asshole like Trump without having to get as nasty as Hillary has. He would have done it with his dignity still intact and none of this stuff would be going on. He would have let Trump dig his own grave by now.]
[The hateful rhetoric from ~~our leaders~~ literally everyone.]
[Our country was always like this, if you want real horror.]
[I don't remember fire bombing and terrorist plots the last 2 elections.]
[Up until like 1910 or something America did not have a single election where somebody didn't get killed at a polling place]
[Yes, painting the presidential candidate of a major party as a sexual assaulting racist dictator does have consequences, and we're seeing them here.]
[Let's completely ignore the fact that the guy shamelessly quoted Mussolini... No one has painted Trump as a dictator more than Trump.]
[The man's own wife accused him of rape.]
[Trump painted the painting, the media and democrats are merely exhibiting it.]
[Nominating a sexual assaulting racist dictator does have consequences as well.]
[I mean, Trump is doing most of the work himself. It's very hard not to see him as a sexual assaulting racist. The dictator part would be pure speculation though.]
[He actually is a sexual assaulting racist with dictatorial tendencies. How can you dispute this?]
[Turn off CNN.]
[I don't own a TV...]
[That party shouldn't have nominated a sexual assaulting racist dictator, then.]
[He did that to himself. he also said Muslims are terrorists, Mexicans are rapists, blacks live in hell, and women are objects. he also threatened to lock up his political rival, sue the press, and fire anyone who disagrees with him.]

[> We should talk about ISIS like they represent Muslims in general, Black people want to be stopped and frisked. This is what people who don't already agree with you will get from statements like yours, and they'll understandably call you a bigot.]
[The fact that you buy this proves their tactics are working.]
[That's all bullshit. I'm sure you're smart enough to take a contextually appropriate view of his comments.]
[its not bullshit. Its things minorities have had to deal with for generations. Stop pretending his words dont have meaning.]
[Ok, do you think illegals here in the US are Mexico's best and brightest? Do you think that crime correlates with poverty? Do you think that illegals from Mexico are set up for success here? Do you disagree that minorities in inner cities are living in hell? You really fucking dispute that? I don't understand how you could possibly misconstrue that into something racist. Maybe you're not as smart as I gave you credit for.]
[>Ok, do you think illegals here in the US are Mexico's best and brightest? Actually yes, I do. If you have the option of living in a nation where a drug war has killed tens of thousands, particularly those who have distinguished themselves through fame, fortune, or politics; or the option of going to a nation where there is order on the streets and high pay for talent, wouldn't a bright Mexican choose the latter?]
[Obviously the smart ones would rather stay. Duh]
[The smart ones usually come legally so they can get a good job. Being an illegal immigrant does not put you in a position to succeed in the U.S.]
[Wow, you kind of answered it yourself. You don't think of minorities or immigrants as people, you just see threats.]
[I live in a region that is literally half foreign. I have no problem with immigrants or minorities that follow the rules and bring skills that benefit our country and our communities. I have a problem with people coming to the US illegally with no skills or means of succeeding here. Those people are a net drain on society and we shouldn't tolerate it. It's not racist, it's not xenophobic, it's merely enforcing laws that we have every right to enforce.]
[lol]
[If you do not have enough emotional control to not fire bomb people that upset you, then you have bigger issues than politics.]
[He didn't say that attack is justified, he's saying Trump himself is the reason why people paint him negatively, it's not just pulled out of nowhere. He's literally recorded saying this shit.]
[No, your mental gymnastics you play to make any of that OK is bullshit.]
[He is a sexual assaulting racist. No one is painting him as anything.]
[You just painted him as a sexually assaulting racist with literally zero proof. ZERO. Just baseless, HATEFUL slander.]
[Alright, here's your proof, since you have apparently been living under a rock (or intentionally buried your head in the sand). https://www.reddit.com/r/EnoughTrumpSpam/comments/4r2yxs/a_final_response_to_the_tell_me_why_trump_is/]
[> literally zero proof The fuck? He's *on record* talking about sexual assault. There are countless testimonies of him sexually assaulting women. And there's certainly way more proof about him than there is about Bill Clinton, that's for sure. Didn't stop you from gobbling up that load of crap.]
[If there's so much proof why hasn't he been charged?]
[He painted himself that way, and yes, the consequences are very unfortunate.]
[Right, the RNC deserves to be firebombed, right? I mean, what's a little firebombing when the stakes are *so high*, right?]
[The fact that you resort to a weak strawman is sad.]
[I didn't say that at all, as much as you wish I did so you could ignore my point. The media didn't paint Donald as anything, he is who he is. That doesn't mean firebombing is OK, we are still a free country with elections - that is the way to shut Trump and his racist, sexist, fascist, rhetoric down.]
[> The media didn't paint Donald as anything stop. Wikileaks is revealing the collusion with MSM. That's not partisan opinion - btw.]
[And? If Donald wasn't a toxic man-baby, he could have "colluded" with the "MSM" too. You do understand that the media and our politicians speak to each other, right?]
[What? We dont need more collusion. Are you here arguing for more collusion? What has happened to the world. Pac-mac is a homophobic because he eats fruits if you listen to the spin this year around.]
[All the collusion in the world didn't force Donald to say what he's said and be the man that he is. The biggest strikes against him have been his own words and actions. The worst thing that the media has done to Donald is give him a camera and a microphone. It's not their fault how he chose to use them.]
[No amount of collusion will go back in time and stop Trump from assaulting women, engaging in racist policies, or having a love affair with the "strongman" archetype.]
[Yep they were really asking for it weren't they? /s The media's lies and manipulation is directly responsible for this divisiveness.]
[What lies?]
[Which lies, exactly?]
[Trump is literally Hitler.]
[New buzzword for trump supporters "media media media media"]
[Dude, blame the media. No seriously, think back to about five years ago and compare how the media handled situations compared to now. Your actively seeing the media use rhetoric to put people against one another.]
[Oh for fucks sake ***NO THEY'RE NOT*** Americans are and always have been a bunch of assholes to each other. That's not a conspiracy, that's just fucking reality, man]
[Actually it is. The media is the only source of news for millions. Their opinions become their belief system. The media compared trump to Hitler for months and many people believe it. It's now morally acceptable to attempt to harass/harm/kill Trump snd his supporters because he represents evil. It becomes morally justifiable to do pretty much anything to stop evil. Hence this event. this is what happens when opinions masquerade as facts in news agencies.]
[The media is not engineering racial and political division. You can maybe make that argument about people like Roger Stone or Ailes. CNN or some shit? No. These things happen, they have happened, they happened hundreds of years ago with more frequency then they do now. It is not the fucking media's fault. >The media compared trump to Hitler for months and many people believe it. It's now morally acceptable to attempt to harass/harm/kill Trump snd his supporters because he represents evil. It becomes morally justifiable to do pretty much anything to stop evil. Hence this event. Did you ever watch Bojack Horseman? "You are the cause of all your problems! It's nobody else, it's you!" Trump *is* a fascist. This is a man who announced his campaign by threatening to use state violence against millions of innocent people. He's supported bombing civilians as state terrorism (unaware of the irony), he's advocated torturing people seemingly because he just likes the idea, he's said people exonerated by DNA evidence should be executed anyway, he's called for the jailing of his political opponents, he's advocated widespread racial and religious discrimination in the form of travel bans and blatantly racist police practices like stop and frisk, he's threatened to jail journalists and public figures who are critical of him in any way, he seems to have no objection to nuclear fucking war, he has called the geneva conventions "a problem", his response to sexual assault allegations was to body shame people, he wants to appoint members of the psychotic heritage foundation to the supreme court (which will destroy any concept of gay rights, or hell civil liberties in general), he wants to abolish all financial regulations and let wall street do whatever the hell it wants.... If you vote for this man, and I mean this, ***you are a fucking horrible person***. You don't believe in democracy if you vote for this, you don't believe in equality, you don't believe in human rights, you don't believe in basic fucking decency. Know why? Because you endorse all of this. Tell me, did the media make Donald Trump say all this shit on tape? Did they hold a gun to his head and force him to be a fascist lunatic? No. He just is. He fucking is. Get over it and admit that you're buying into something that has human death as its end point. You can't blame this on some bullshit non-existent media conspiracy. Even conservatives are appalled by this guy. ***EVERYONE WITH A SOUL*** is appalled by this guy. I'm honestly fucking sick of trying to appeal to the morality and reason of people making the argument you have. Do you just ignore all this shit? Or do you love it? Do you love the thought of innocent women and children being blown up by laser guided munitions? Tell me, do you know how a fuel air bomb works? It releases gas into the air which suffocates anybody not immediately caught in the blast, then it detonates. The vacuum created by the explosion creates such tremendous pressure that in some cases nearby people have their lungs crushed and partially forced back up their throats. It's a painful, agonizing, way to die. It isn't like the movies. Thing eyeballs ripped out of heads and bits of entrails raining down on the hole neighborhood. Mutilation and slow death. You support a man who has said he wants to do this to innocent people. Look in a goddamn mirror and then ask why people think Trump is evil.]

[The media didn't create Trump. The Republican party and years worth of exploiting bigotry to further their own ends did. This is American conservatism. This is what it has always been, underneath the bullshit appeals to reason. It's always been about domination of the weak by the strong. You live in a culture defined by social darwinism and you always have. We lie to ourselves about this. But it's the truth.]

[>Much of the people who are young are supporting Trump because of the media and so called "social justice warriors." And those people are fucking idiots. >These people would not be conservative unless they encountered the vitriolic rhetoric of the left Oh, so people calling them racist made them racist? I fucking hate people who make this argument...you think any of this shit is new? It's been a tendency in our society for fucking hundreds of years. Politicians blame the problems of white people on minorities to bolster themselves, the white people kill a bunch of said minorities, and then they go back to pretending racism doesn't exist. Rinse, repeat. These lunatics *deserve* vitriol. There's no reasoning with this madness. I know you want to pretend that the little fuckheads on r/the_donald are capable of anything resembling empathy and compassion but they aren't. They would gladly vote for ethnic cleansing. So don't give me this shit about how it's my fault they're like that. It's them, their parents, their grandparents, and decades worth of propaganda and conspiracy theory from the republicans that made them this way. These people have no ideology other than contempt and a desire to see brown people slaughtered en masse, even if they're loathe to admit it. But please, explain to me the moral reasoning behind voting for a guy who called the geneva conventions "a problem" Oh by the way, voting for a maniac demagogue because a liberal bruised your ego is fucking pathetic and that kind of person should hate themself]

[I am voting Democrat this year, and I want to go on record saying that this is not the kind of behavior that should ever be tolerated, much less celebrated, in a civilized society. It doesn't matter what political party, race, religion, etc that either the perpetrator or victim belong to - this is unacceptable and should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.]
[Domestic terrorism charges if perpetrators are caught.]
[This stuff should not be tolerated, I hope they catch the people who did this. We can have our disagreements, that is democracy. Regardless of who you support this election, do it peacefully and do not result to these actions.]
[Fuck anyone who uses violence against their political opponents. This is a democracy. All issues of government should be resolved peacefully. That's the point.]
[Fallacies. Fallacies everywhere.]
[I'm shocked all the talk of violence yielded a reaction.]
[Literal victim-blaming. Classy.]
[It's not victim blaming at all. Hell this country even has "fighting words" doctrine which limits some types of speech. See Chaplinsky v New Hampshire. Never mind that there's slack jawed yokels threatening peace every single day which could easily be seen as incitement. Comparing my comment to say, a woman deserving to be raped because of how she was dressed or way she acted is insulting to say the least and daft on your part.]
[I disagree with both candidates on just about everything, and I would never in my life think of putting people's lives in danger and threatening them in order to prove my "political point". On another note, some of the rhetoric I've seen here in the comments alone really drive what this election is about: destroying the other party and its followers versus the benefit of America as a whole.]
[Reading the conspiracy theories on here is going to be great.]
[This is not how anyone should behave, we should condemn all acts of this nature.]
[Expect to see armed militia types outside outside GOP offices in the very near future.]
[I'd actually expect to see police on overtime pay outside most offices for both parties ... or serious security til Nov 8-ish (plus window treatments/bars/etc..) ... maybe in more contested states. Someone just donated $1 million or so for ads? That's probably spent as of 1 AM on additional security.]

[Has it been? It's more like one cult of personality that everybody is either super into or scared to death of.]
[I consider it both of them. For one because their followers each refuse to see the bad in them. And second because I don't know who you just referenced and that should say something.]
[Like many people voting Clinton don't like her. They are just scared to death of the potential instability that would follow from not electing her.]
[This is so horrible. I've spent a lot of time volunteering for campaigns and to see these spaces not be safe for politically engaged citizens is so disheartening. Sending love from Canada to this crazy country ]
[The question now is, did alt right republicans bomb it to stir up support, conservatives bomb to kick out alt right, or liberals? Choices choices... regardless of answer that should be prosecuted to fullest extend of the law... not how a democracy acts.]
[Or an anarchist? Liberals, basically by definition are averse to such things.]
[Don't ever believe that. I've seen [two](http://i.imgur.com/SYTjsyW.png) [different](http://i.imgur.com/br4wwFD.png) graphics that display what plays out in reality much better than a line to describe peoples political leanings. I've found I can tolerate most conservative OR liberal ideals, where my problem comes in, with either side for that matter, is when it becomes *authoritarian*. The horse shoe view on political ideology shows it very well... the extreme left and extreme right are closer in ideology than they are to the center... That said, I think the plane view of political leanings probably makes more sense and in all honesty, probably a cubical space would make more sense than a 2d plane. Long and short... extremists, especially of the authoritarian variety scare the shit out of me... and both the left and right are able to produce them... they're violent, they're radical, and they're happy to use force to get their point across.]
[The horse show theory is nonsense that is used to promote liberal democracy as a normative worldview and demonize everything outside of it. The extreme left aren't liberals, nor is everything on the right a conservative. But using liberal as a stand in word for left it obscures what both of those are. Socialists, communists, anaracists, are all leftists that aren't liberals because they don't hold to the liberal understanding of value and liberty. The liberal hold liberty like 'freedom of speech, press, religion, assosciation, market' etc as the guiding principals while a communist who's the right to food, medicine, housing, gainful employment as being more fundamental and if providing for those means infringing on the the liberal rights than so be it.]
[*grin* Exactly the response I expected from an extremist who doesn't like to be lumped in with what he views as the 'other team.' This is almost the text book example given in several places of what the 'extremist arguments against horseshoe theory is.' rofl. Neither far left or far right like being associated with each other... when to the rest of the world? They're all totalitarian assholes.]
[To the rest of the world? Are you joking? You have no idea what the *rest of the world* thinks politically. Right there you are assuming that the liberal democratic system is the normal world view for all people, just some happen to live under dictators. You know Chilie voted in a communist government in the 70s in a regular free election? Also in the current day more than 60% of Russians wish they still lived under the soviet system, and the Russian communist party consistently comes second place after Putins party. Most people in Cuba *dont* actually want to adopt capitalism in any form. And that's just on the left. None of those places seen it as the same thing as the far right, nor liberal centrist or anything else. To other places, having a king seems only natural, and South Korea happily accepted military dictators for decades. Most places in the world actually have a bit of a wider range of political points of view in their democracy, so they don't just see everything outside the centre as 'evil nonsense'. Even places like France and Italy are still elected communist members to their assemblies. For a long time the communist party was Italy's second biggest party even. In Canada there are 5 parties that have enough attention to get seats in the house. Not too many places are like America and just have two parties, and everything outside of that is considered 'extreme'.]
[You're so perfect, you couldn't be made up. Carry on rofl. Even bots can't misunderstand that far, that takes human stupidity.]
[How about we wait until we get more information before drown in false accusations and conspiracy theories?]
[Well crap,right now I am certain that someone will feel that is right to use excessive violence in the name of trump.]
[Trump did tweet that "Hillary's animals" attack our HQ]
[I used to live in Orange County NC, and this is so pointless. It's the most left-wing county in the state, and there's no chance anybody there would have voted for Trump McCrory, or Burr. Hey Carrboro Anarchists: You aren't helping in this case!!! EDIT: Orange County is the type of county that tries to treat a (horrific) cockroach problem with hot water... Seriously, they gave cockroaches warm water to drink in winter. Carrboro anarchists have successfully stopped the development of a CVS for years. It's a thing there.]
[At least everyone here is reasonable and knows clearly a line has been crossed. I can't say the same for this thread in trumps subreddit and also Trump placing blame on Hilary supporters makes him a big asshole. We don't even know who it is yet.]

[Wow, Trump is a piece of shit.]
[Exactly. My experience this year is that Clinton supporters move forward quietly. I have yet to hear such anger from Clinton supporters that moves beyond getting out the vote. On the other hand, I routinely see desperate Trump supporters online who are saying crazy things that involve words like "revolution" and "bloodshed" and "war" ... and they have learned the Trump way of doing things, which is to accuse the other side of things your side has been accused of first. So, while no one knows what happened, I'm highly suspect of the "Nazi" language to begin with. We'll see.]

[And did you see what she was wearing???? Man, she was asking for it.]
[The difference here is that the person in the video went there to intentionally start trouble. They weren't a victim, they were the antagonist smacking the hornet's nest to see what happened.]
[> The difference here is that the person in the video went there to intentionally start trouble. Walking in a public area wearing a hat is now 'intentionally starting trouble.' In other words: "Believe the wrong thing, feel the sting." Violence is justified. Democracy? Who needs it? What, me worry?]
[Yeah! They wore a hat! A HAT THAT SHOWS THEY SUPPORT THE REPUBLICAN CANIDATE FOR PRESIDENCY! HOW DARE THEY! THEY WERE BASICALLY ASKING TO BE ATTACKED!]

[A dozen attacks on conservatives so far this year and yet this one is the false flag? Wishful thinking on part of liberals in order to avoid facing the truth about the results of their demagoguery.]
[> A dozen attacks on conservatives so far this year and yet this one is the false flag? People described all those earlier attacks and riots on Trump supporters as 'false flags' when they happened too, both here and on the Guardian. Some people are so convinced of their own moral righteousness that they can't comprehend 'their side' doing wrong- it must be the *other guy's* fault.]
[This whole thing is very suspect. Trump stands to benefit from this much more than Hillary (in two specific way - wag the dog and make Republicans who have denounced Trump rethink their vote). I think the Trump campaign or his supporters are behind this]
[> mfw I've been called a Nazi online for supporting anything right-wing at all... The reason Trump supporters talk of revolution is due to the sheer level of corruption present around Hillary. The wikileaks emails alone should be enough to disqualify someone from public office let alone the numerous other scandals.]
[But Trump is squeaky clean? The guy who owes hundreds of millions all over the world? The guy who at every step and turn scams people and games the system for his benefit? The guy who lies about literally everything? How do you even talk yourself into pushing all that aside but Hillary under a microscope? It boggles the mind.]
[I'm not claiming Trump is squeaky clean (although compared to Hillary he might as well be) but to address your points: > The guy who owes hundreds of millions all over the world? Every billionaire owes money through their business. I can guarantee you microsoft is billions in debt too. What matters is the balance sheet. > The guy who at every step and turn scams people Who has he scammed exactly? As far as I knew, Trump University was cleared of charges. > ... and games the system for his benefit? That's called capitalism I'm afraid. The problem with corporations exploiting government is an issue on the side of the government - corporations are _meant_ to use whatever tools at their disposal to maximise profit. That's the entire point of a company. > The guy who lies about literally everything? Hyperbole much. > How do you even talk yourself into pushing all that aside but Hillary under a microscope? I don't push it aside. I weigh up the pros and cons of the candidates. The biggest issue right now, by far, is corruption (in my opinion). Hillary is basically corruption in human form, Trump isn't even a politician. Sure he's a billionaire, but he stands to lose a lot more from running for office than he would make simply continuing to do his job. The character attacks already must have permanently damaged his reputation and I can only assume he'll have to hand over the Trump Organization to his children permanently, no matter which way the election falls.]
[> Every billionaire owes money through their business. I can guarantee you microsoft is billions in debt too. What matters is the balance sheet. Microsoft is not running for president. And no they are not because we can go to their financial report and see for ourselves. The balance sheet is important. When will see Trumps balance sheet so we can see who he does business with? When will we find out that the reason Trump is so easy on Russia is because he owes them hundreds of millions of dollars? How do we know he will act in the best interests of America when he has so many financial interests all over the world? It's impossible and it just opens the door for him to exploit the American taxpayer. No thanks. >Who has he scammed exactly? As far as I knew, Trump University was cleared of charges.

Fair enough. To me, Clinton only appears to have some corruption but is really not much when you think about her being in politics for 30 plus years. She has the experience and desire to actually get work done while Donald wants to outsource all his duties to the VP. Plus, he's just a terrible human being. But if corruption is your thing, thats cool. But if thats gonna be *the* thing, I won't hold my breath that Trump would be better than Hillary. The dude has looked out for himself and only himself and that aint gonna change.]
[> When will see Trumps balance sheet so we can see who he does business with? Never, because private company balance sheets have to remain private. Trump is not his company, and liabilities within his company are not his own. > When will we find out that the reason Trump is so easy on Russia is because he owes them hundreds of millions of dollars? Pure conjecture. Plus he could not personally owe them that money, and a company protects the owner from liability for debts. Why would he care even if he did have debts with Russia? Plus, I'm pretty sure the Trump Org could pay hundreds of millions in debt without an issue. > How do we know he will act in the best interests of America when he has so many financial interests all over the world? As a businessman myself I can tell you - business is brutally competitive within the industry but that doesn't mean that business people will pick their business interests over their personal stance outside of that industry, if you follow. Just because Trump runs a large company doesn't mean every decision he makes in his personal life is to benefit that company. > No, Trump University was not cleared. TIL. Innocent until proven guilty though. Most large companies have ongoing lawsuits all the time. > Also, all the mom and pop contractors who acted as vendors for him If you can't enforce your contracts then you shouldn't take them. If they took contracts with much larger companies then they've learned a tough but incredibly common lesson in business. > The people who invested in the Taj Mahal casino Investors know the risks of investing. He sold the Taj Majal well before it failed anyway so why is its failure his responsibility? > foundation donors whose money he used to pay legal fees and purchase extravagant gifts for himself Source? > the american tax payer when he sought to avoid income taxes through a real estate scam Innocent until proven guilty, tax law in the US is extremely complicated and legal "tax avoidance" can often be blurred with illegal "tax evasion".

Politifact is a partisan source, the Tampa Bay Times is a Clinton donor and there are a few instances of them giving different ratings to the same statement by different people.

She stole disaster relief funds from Haiti, failed to answer the Benghazi call, is in cahoots with CNN and multiple debate moderators, took foreign donations for her campaign, I mean tell me when you want me to stop but her record of corruption is seemingly endless. > She has the experience and desire to actually get work done while Donald wants to outsource all his duties to the VP. Since when? He brought Mike Pence on board to add political clout to the campaign but that doesn't mean he has no intention of doing any work - just that it will appease those who are concerned that he doesn't have experience inside DC. Which he does, as a donor and lobbyist. > Plus, he's just a terrible human being. Disagree. > But if corruption is your thing, thats cool. But if thats gonna be the thing, I won't hold my breath that Trump would be better than Hillary. The dude has looked out for himself and only himself and that aint gonna change. At the end of the day we have real evidence that Hillary is corrupt and has used her political career to enrich herself and exploit the political system. You're comparing real, evidenced and ongoing corruption with "Donald will probably do that stuff too". I know if I had to choose between a poisoned apple and a "maybe" poisoned apple, I'd choose the latter.]
[>Never, because private company balance sheets have to remain private. Trump is not his company, and liabilities within his company are not his own. Not true. He refused to place the business in a blind trust and has said he "promises" to do the right thing. And even if he did, his kids would still run it and its not like they wouldn't coordinate US foreign policy with his business interests. If you can't see the obvious ~~conflict of interest~~ corruption, I don't think anything is going to change your mind on this. >Pure conjecture. Plus he could not personally owe them that money, and a company protects the owner from liability for debts. Why would he care even if he did have debts with Russia? Plus, I'm pretty sure the Trump Org could pay hundreds of millions in debt without an issue. If his company goes bankrupt for not paying it's debts, creditors can come after his personal assets. As a business owner, you should know this. Again, he refuses to sever ties to his personal and companies financial interests so...again...huge conflict of interest. He has a duty to maximize his profits, right? That includes paying his and his companies debts. >TIL. Innocent until proven guilty though. Most large companies have ongoing lawsuits all the time. Oh. OK. I guess that makes it okay for the president of the united states then? >Innocent until proven guilty, tax law in the US is extremely complicated and legal "tax avoidance" can often be blurred with illegal "tax evasion". It's impossible to say which it is before the trial has concluded. If it was an isolated incident maybe....but this many lawsuits? He literally hasn't done a single thing that hasn't had some lawsuit whether him suing someone or him being sued. >As a businessman myself I can tell you - business is brutally competitive within the industry but that doesn't mean that business people will pick their business interests over their personal stance outside of that industry, if you follow. Just because Trump runs a large company doesn't mean every decision he makes in his personal life is to benefit that company. Not sure what "the industry" is that you refer to but not all industry is competitive and rarely are they perfectly competitive. A businessman in the Whitehouse gets to set policy that benefits his business. Further, I thought he had an obligation to maximize profits. That's his job right? So, all of a sudden he's going to start being altruistic at the detriment of his company? Give me a break. >Clinton campaign started the birther movement, And Donald Trump continued it for years. When we will find out what those investigators he sent to Hawaii found? Oh nothing because Trump basically admitted the whole thing was a scam. >and either telling a couple or lies or forgetting people is not "everything you say is a lie". I could say the same thing about Clinton. What has she lied about specifically again? >Politifact is a partisan source, the Tampa Bay Times is a Clinton donor and there are a few instances of them giving different ratings to the same statement by different people. See here vs here. This is an incredibly weak argument. They are hardly "partisan" and does not invalidate the work they do. >Since when? Since the time he offered John Kasich to be in charge of foreign and domestic policy if he would accept the VP position. >She stole disaster relief funds from Haiti Source? >failed to answer the Benghazi call Oh you mean the thing that is the most investigated incident in US history lead by a team of politicians looking for any shred of evidence to hang her with and they found nothing? The thing fiscal conservatives have spent more money investigating than anything in US history and still came up with nothing? OK. >is in cahoots with CNN and multiple debate moderators So? CNN is a private company. >took foreign donations for her campaign Source? I mean, like Paul Manafort did? >I mean tell me when you want me to stop but her record of corruption is seemingly endless. Keep going. This isn't corruption. >At the end of the day we have real evidence that Hillary is corrupt But we don't though. We have you're interpretation of some emails. >and has used her political career to enrich herself and exploit the political system. When? >You're comparing real, evidenced and ongoing corruption with "Donald will probably do that stuff too".

Also, what happened to innocent until proven guilty?????]
[> Not true. He refused to place the business in a blind trust and has said he "promises" to do the right thing. And even if he did, his kids would still run it and its not like they wouldn't coordinate US foreign policy with his business interests. If you can't see the obvious conflict of interest, I don't think anything is going to change your mind on this. Your implication is that no business person could ever hold a political office and _not_ use it for their own benefit. That's a mighty strong opinion you have there, and it would seem you're also suggesting that somehow being a career politician doesn't itself invite the candidate to engage in corruption? Not owning a multi-billion-dollar business didn't stop Hillary from being corrupt. > If his company goes bankrupt for not paying it's debts, creditors can come after his personal assets. As a business owner, you should know this. Not if it is a limited liability company, which most companies are. > Again, he refuses to sever ties to his personal and companies financial interests so...again...huge conflict of interest. He has a duty to maximize his profits, right? That includes paying his and his companies debts. He has handed over control of TTO to Ivanka and Eric. Therefore his duties are excused. You have to be an active member of the executive team to be held liable, the majority shareholder has no legal responsibility to maximise profits (technically nor does the executive team of a privately owned company, technically, but they will still attempt to do so). > Oh. OK. I guess that makes it okay for the president of the united states then? ... Yes, obviously? Owning a company opens you up to lawsuits for just about anything. Being accused of a crime doesn't make you a criminal. > If it was an isolated incident maybe....but this many lawsuits? He literally hasn't done a single thing that hasn't had some lawsuit whether him suing someone or him being sued. so what? Lawsuits are not criminal in nature. Companies sue each other all the time. My company is very small right now and I've had to sue someone for payment. If he gets indicted on tax evasion that's a criminal offense and that's a completely different story. > Not sure what "the industry" is that you refer to but not all industry is competitive and rarely are they perfectly competitive. A businessman in the Whitehouse gets to set policy that benefits his business. Further, I thought he had an obligation to maximize profits. That's his job right? So, all of a sudden he's going to start being altruistic at the detriment of his company? Give me a break. Once again, it's no longer his job as he isn't running TTO. "The industry" I was referring to in this case would be the real estate industry - when you're at work on business you have to be ruthless with your competitors and such, but when you're not at work as an executive you don't have to be constantly thinking of how to maximise profits. You are under no obligation in your own free time. Which is all of Trump's time now as he has handed over control. > And Donald Trump continued it for years. When we will find out what those investigators he sent to Hawaii found? Oh nothing because Trump basically admitted the whole thing was a scam. I think you're using the word "scam" wrong here. You seem to be falling over yourself to paint Trump as evil incarnate even in cases where he hasn't actually done anything wrong. > I could say the same thing about Clinton. What has she lied about specifically again? "the Benghazi attack was caused by a youtube video" "I landed in Bosnia under sniper fire" "I don't remember" x 1000000 during the emails investigation claiming her "public and private position" email was related to Abe Lincoln. claimed she doesn't know "C" stands for classified in emails claimed to not delete emails under subpoena claimed she never received classified emails to her server slandered a rape victim in court when working as a lawyer > This is an incredibly weak argument. They are hardly "partisan" and does not invalidate the work they do. Did you click the links I provided? If you are unwilling to see how they are biased (even unconsciously, perhaps) in that example case then there's no point continuing as you're not bothering to review anything I say rationally. > Since the time he offered John Kasich to be in charge of foreign and domestic policy if he would accept the VP position. Source? I don't recall Trump saying "I will adopt Kasich's platform 100% if he becomes VP" and I don't believe for a second that that happened. > Source? http://www.nationalreview.com/article/437883/hillarys-america-secret-history-democratic-party-dinesh-dsouza-clinton-foundation or here, the ex-president of Haiti making such statements himself: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phKO2T2pMjM > Oh you mean the thing that is the most investigated incident in US history lead by a team of politicians looking for any shred of evidence to hang her with and they found nothing?

CNN is a private company. CNN, MSNBC, et al are working for Hillary's campaign trying to portray Trump as a monster while minimising airtime for any of her scandals. I know they have a right to do so as private companies but do you think that's an acceptable state of play in a democratic process, for all information on the election to be filtered through a blue-tinted lens? > Source? I mean, like Paul Manafort did? https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/11915 Source on Paul Manafort doing so. > Keep going. This isn't corruption. Have you been following any of the wikileaks email dumps at all? There's a lot of damning stuff in there that I'd encourage you to look into. > But we don't though. We have you're interpretation of some emails. I'm not alone in being able to read the contents of emails. > When? Pretty much everything about the Clinton Foundation points to it being a huge money laundering operation. I would source for you but it's 3:30am here - perhaps tomorrow. > I want to write the same thing right back to you. You've not been able to provide anything concrete to show Trump is corrupt. The private email server alone should have disqualified Hillary from candidacy had Comey not covered up for her.]
[Im sure he'll reply once his check clears.]
[[So quite and forward thinking](http://m.imgur.com/gallery/44jJY) Edit: What's with the downvotes? The truth too ugly for ya?]
[Weird I thought those were all 100% definitely Bernie supporters back then. Funny how that changed]
[It was a mixture of both but they're anti Trump (and his supporters) more than anything else (because they don't want to get deported). So right now they are 100% Hillary supporters, because if they were anti Hillary they would have harassed the dozen or so Hillary Clinton rallygoers instead.]
[>My experience this year is that Clinton supporters move forward quietly. LOL]
[Wow, thank you for that thoughtful rebuttal.]
[Yea you're right, I've certainly never seen any Clinton supporters using "Nazi" language anywhere at all (he said in a comment on /r/politics).]
[But I've not seen people saying to kill the Nazi's, or that there will be an armed revolution if the Nazi's win, or that the only way the Nazi's could possibly win is if they rigged the election.]
[While on lunch at work today the news was showing comments of Donald trump supporters and one of them said, "if Donald trump doesn't win then we need to start a coup and start a revolution so that there will be bloodshed!" Something along the lines of that but it's just terrifying how some people can actually think that.]
[I agree. The worst part of all is that that one comment represents the view of all Trump supporters, who are a hive-mind. It's scary how much control Trump exercises over them with his mind-control rays. LITERALLY Hitler.]
[Notice how he made it all about himself and didn't express any condolences.]
[Do you express condolences when no one is killed? Hillary is only expressing regret because it was her side that did it. If it was Trump supporters fire bombing a Clinton office she'd be shit talking deplorables.]
[The people who did this aren't on anyone's side. Regardless of politics, we can agree that the people who did this are deplorable.]
[Do you have evidence of a link to the Democrats? I'm sure the authorities would like to know about it.]
[There was apparently a spray painted message calling the Republicans Nazis. Common leftist rhetoric this cycle. Also http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/10316186]
[Invoking Nszism is standard hyperbole on all sides. Let the investigation unfold and denounce all acts of violence.]
[>HRC : The attack on the Orange County HQ @NCGOP office is horrific and unacceptable. Very grateful that everyone is safe. >Trumpet : Animals representing Hillary Clinton and Dems in North Carolina just firebombed our office in Orange County because we are winning @NCGOP]
[What fucking proof does he have? Asshole probably pissed his 3 extreme supporters just got caught by the FBI.]
[probably some college-aged womens studies feels nazi]
[Hillary could've done the same thing in that situation by saying "Three Trump supporter animals just tried to blow up women and children", but instead she realizes that those men don't represent all Trump supporters. Trump used a fucked up situation for political gain.]
[Holy shit good point! Any dignified person wouldn't have the same thought process as this asshat.]
[Jesus, Trump really is a piece of shit.]
[Yes, I'm sure Trump and his supporters would not have been blamed if a Democratic Party office had been firebombed. Trump's 'violent rhetoric' would not have been mentioned once.]
[If the shoe were on the other foot: a Democratic campaign office being fire bombed do you genuinely believe that Hillary Clinton would have gone on twitter and wrote: Animals representing Donald Trump and the Republicans just firebombed our office in Orange County because we are winning Or something to that regard?]
[Insulting, degrading, blame-assigning, *and* delusional. Impressive for 140 characters.]
[There have been dozens of documented cases of Clinton supporters violently attacking Trump supporters, all the while shouting RACIST! but somehow the idea is being floated that this was some sort of false flag operation by Team Trump.]
[Why do you assume this is the work of Democrats or some "false-flag"? Trump said a few days ago that (presumably "establishment") Republicans are worse than "Crooked Hillary." The news media is full of reports of Republicans abandoning Trump right now.]
[And even more documentate cases of trump supporters being violent towards Clinton and Sanders supporters. What is your point? How does either of those things indicate who did or didn't do this?]
[Find the people that did this and arrest them.]
[To any anti-Trump people considering this type of violence: * Physically harming people is never the right answer in political discourse. If you even consider this you should be ashamed. * Violence creates fear. Trump feeds on fear and this only helps, not hurts his campaign. * Fuck you.]
[Who's to say it wasn't self sabotage? Clearly the republicans weren't going to win that county - why not? What a better way to fire up the base than to set this up. Hell, look at Trump's messaging already. Also, what would be gained by some Dems to firebomb the repub headquarters in what is one of the most liberal counties in America? Until we have all the facts can't really jump to conclusions either way...but I could see this going either way.]
[Violence is not an acceptable way of expressing your feelings or furthering your ideals. It solves nothing. It helps no one. It only creates more problems and hurts more people. Regardless of anyone's political beliefs or stance on this election, this kind of shit is totally unacceptable and is not something that needs to in any way *become* acceptable in this country. There are better ways of solving our problems. There are better ways of expressing our disagreements. There are better ways of advocating for what we believe, *whatever* those beliefs may be. I hope the person or people who did this are caught, that their motivations are found out, and that they are punished by our legal system. Until then, I don't think there's enough information known to speculate on those details or make assumptions on them at this moment and I just hope that everyone who works at this office is okay and are taking care of themselves and their colleagues.]
[What the hell is going on. This is unacceptable. Yes this year's election has been decisive but violence is never appropriate.]
[I'm voting dem, but this shit makes me sick. What the fuck is wrong with these people.]
[If this was a bombing on a Liberal HQ people would be berating Republicans. But because the roles are reversed, this subreddit is saying "Democrat, Republican, doesn't matter. What matters is that the criminals are apprehended". While I agree, this should go both ways. People need to realize there's bad people on both sides. Not all Liberals are the kind-hearted open-minded progressives that this sub assumes.]
[We don't know who did this, or their motivations for doing so.]
["Nazi republicans get out" really dude it couldn't be more obvious]
[But the republicans are the only one to benefit from this happening. And it is going to allow for retaliation]
[Dude, no one is benefiting from a HQ being blown up. If anything Republicans are being hurt from this because people fail to even acknowledge the possibility that the fire bombers could be Liberal. Everyones constantly including the fact that the attacker could be Republican or what not, but from the anti-Republican trends that have been circulating everywhere (this site is a good example) I wouldn't be surprised if some 'blue' millennials did this (I put blue in quotations because all good Liberals do not condone such violent behavior.)]
[We'll see.]
[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichstag_fire]
[If there was a bombing on a liberal HQ, liberals would be doing exactly what they're doing here--condemning the violence, and *waiting for evidence of who actually committed the crime.* We'd probably be spending a bit more time harping on the Trumpian advocacy of violence that fomented this political environment, though.]
[Hmmm... Except a lot of liberals do no wait for evidence when the crime fits their narrative. I.E. a white cop shooting a black man. Yes, not all liberals are like this, but many do not take a logical approach to situations with strong emotional backstories. I.E many modern instances of race-fueled attacks and religious extremisms. Again, not ALL, but a lot. Mainly the millennial progressives that enjoy lurking on here.]
[Trump's reaction on Twitter compared to Hillary's reaction go this event, shows how unhinged from reality him and his supporters are.]
[The best way to put down an opposing party is to vote against them. Never resort to violence to attack a political enemy.]
[If you're visiting from the_donald, take note of these responses. Patriotic Americans who love this country show rationality and compassion in the light of something like this. Emotions are running high right now but we are Americans, not enemies.]
[>Patriotic Americans who love this country show rationality and compassion in the light of something like this. [Mhm.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEMZSn8iLr4)]
[> If you're visiting from the_donald, What does this even mean? The Donald is not a location. No one is "from" there.]
[I assume he means if t_d is your main hangout on reddit, and you saw the news and searched for the /r/politics article on it.]
[I find these objections silly. I don't care whether you or anyone else goes to the sparsely populated Hillary sub or a Walking Dead sub or The Donald. I like to engage with your ideas and what you say.]
[You're assuming those people are capable of reason and compassion. You're wrong. They would love to firebomb *people* if they could, never mind buildings.]
[> Patriotic Americans who love this country show rationality and compassion in the light of something like this. ...... https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/787782613633208320]
[Are you referring to the strong sentiment of "Flase Flag" in this thread?]
[What about the all the posts condemning it and indicating this is unacceptable, going to bypass all of those? This whole thing is disgusting and I hope whomever did this shit is prosecuted and pays for their crime.]
[Step 1) say it's unacceptable Step 2) say he brought on himself by being racist/sexist/Mussolini/Hitler]
[The left and the MSM hate victim shaming...until they hate the victim worse.]
[You're argument is "this is what people are *going* to do. I just know it." Focus on the present, no matter who was responsible for these attacks, we as a society need to condemn this, and all forms of targeted violence and harassment towards others.]
[[It's actually not a joke. CNN just did it](http://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/nicholas-fondacaro/2016/10/16/cnns-stelter-blames-firebombing-nc-republican-office-trumps)]
[I'd really like to hear a typical left-leaning, /r/politics poster respond to this. How is this Trump's fault? How is his rhetoric to blame when Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and countless Hillary supporters have called Trump supporters and the GOP all kinds of terrible things - deplorable, unredeemable, and all kinds of -ists - essentially describing them as sub-human and worthless? Is an incident like this - and the response from a media outlet like CNN - finally going to convince you that the corruption is real and the narrative is completely rigged?]
[as a progressive, i abhor things like this. we need both liberal/progressive and conservatives as representatives. i hope they find whomever did this and throw away the key.]
[>Animals representing Hillary Clinton and Dems in North Carolina just firebombed our office in Orange County because we are winning @NCGOP >Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 16, 2016 I'm not surprised that Trump is using this for his own advantage and saying these terrorists represent Clinton. Trump is such a disgusting piece of shit.]
[Hillary Clinton condemned the attack and said she's glad everyone is safe. Donald just tweeted about how Hillary Clinton's "animals" are attacking the GOP because he's winning. Unbelievable. His own party is firebombed and he makes himself look worse.]
[I highly doubt it was his own party. This reeks of fanatical leftism.]
[[deleted]]
[I guess yours isn't. Take a look at the responses in this thread. Take a shot of your drink of choice every time you see "false flag" or "a republican did it."]
[Jesus dude you're gonna shit on the other party's "reading comprehension" when their HQ just got firebombed? What is it that has you so angry? Why do you spend so much time spreading vitriol online? You literally told a kid in /r/makinghiphop to "kill himself on live TV" to get exposure. How do you, in your daily life, make the world better by spreading this kind of shit?]
[Trump supporters are pretty fucking mad at the GOP and are just swinging wildly and desperately at everyone right now, so I really wouldn't be surprised if it was one of his]
[Pot meet kettle.]
[This reeks of a few idiots. When was the last time "The Left" did anything like this?]
[Re-read his last sentence.]
[Maybe direct your anger more at the actual firebombers, and less at the angry tweet, okay?]
[Publicly condemned. What's her private position?]
[LMAO! Good point]
[Also against it because it doesn't help Goldman Sachs stocks.]
[What's his? Probably hoping it will bring more votes.]
[If it was a Trump supporter fire bombing a Clinton office she'd be shit talking deplorables.]
[But it isn't.]
[Three Trump supporters tried to blow up a bunch of Muslims the other day and Hillary never even suggested that they represent Trump.]
[I'm gonna laugh when this ends up being some right wing nut job doing it to fire up the base.]
[He's an idiot and a clown. Nobody should be surprised at his incompetence at this point.]
[He's a moron. Shit like this should bring reasonable people together on both sides. Adding more fuel to the political climate is not fucking helping.]
[His own party is firebombed and he increases the divisions between people with his words.]
[Absolutely disgraceful, awful thing to do.]
[Has anyone been arrested? Any suspects? I can't seem to find that info. Why in the f would anyone against Trump take it to this extreme at this point... He has literally pushed himself further and further out to sea up until now. But any form of political terrorism is unacceptable in this country. The responsible actors do not represent the perspective of any candidate I can think of, certainly not Clinton as Trump accuses]
[Is everyone ok? That should be the main focus of this, not the political implications]
[It happened overnight so I doubt anyone was in the building in the first place.]
[The article reports that no one was killed, and there's no mention of any injuries. It looks like everyone's okay... thankfully!]
[Having grown up in Georgia (one state over) I've seen many, many swastikas spray painted on buildings on the local news (typically black people's homes) by what usually turns out to be teenagers of some right wing bent or another. My instinctive response seeing this picture was that it was some sort of alt-right type doing the vandalism because 99/100 times in the case of swastikas that's who it is. Having it happen to a Republican headquarters in the South is kind of fishy. This feels like a false flag attack to me.]
[Trump specifically blaming Clinton for the firebombing is seriously scary stuff: https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/787782613633208320]
[She may not have bombed it herself, but she sowed the seeds with her divisive and hate-filled rhetoric.]
[This is true, under Obama and Clinton division in this country has only gotten worse. Social justice work especially has laid the groundwork for a good chunk of this division though it was encouraged by Obama and Clinton not denouncing radical groups such as BLM]
[Then trump takes the blame for the alt-right terrorists who were planing to massacre refugees, deal?]
[> alt-right terrorists who were planing to massacre refugees, deal? LOL what?]
[http://www.theatlantic.com/amp/article/504269/]
[LOL >The three men were arrested with nearly 2,000 pounds of firearms and ammunition. They were planning to attack on November 9, one day after the election. I like how they had "2000 pounds" of guns and ammo, but ZERO explosives. Here's how the FBI operates when they have a political agenda btw: http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/29/opinion/sunday/terrorist-plots-helped-along-by-the-fbi.html]
[I wonder why domestic terrorism is so funny to you... Normal people don't find these things hilarious.]
[Read the article.]
[I posted the article, I've read it]
[The nyt article]
[No.]
[Her hate filled rhetoric is mostly quoting things the Donald says.]
[No, firebombing a fucking political office and spray painting threats on a building is "seriously scary stuff".]
[Trump has no idea who is responsible for this. It could be *The Democrats*. There are also a lot of Trump supporters who feel very passionately that the GOP is screwing over his campaign. The fact that one of his traits is to act immediately on gut instinct w/o any evidence, in addition to politicizing such an event just shows how scary the idea is of putting Trump in a leadership position on the world stage.]
[Well said good sir.]
[As a strong supporter of Clinton and a decent human being, I gotta say this is absolutely deplorable. Political violence is wrong no matter who it's being committed against.]
[> deplorable http://i.imgur.com/j4AjvXW.jpg]
[Violence is *never* the answer. We are letting ourselves feed into the political games, and become more polarized as a country. Democrat, Republican, Independent, it doesn't matter. It's a true shame that an incident like this can happen. And it's even worse that Trump would use it as an opportunity to dog Clinton and the Democrats. No one in their right mind would think destruction is going to fix our problems.]
[TIL there's an Orange County in North Carolina]
[Perhaps you learned that something exists outside of California.]
[Blaming hillary for this is dirty.]
[Yea this isn't ok, doesn't matter if its right or left it's still reflective of fascism, and that's just not ok.]
[Fascism is a specific social, political, and economic ideology, not a synonym for violence.]
[I don't think you understand what I meant.]
[What do you mean?]
[Violence of any kind in this country toward another political party can be viewed as "just usual tensions", sure, but doing acts of political terrorism like this makes us look like a banana republic.]
[Whoever did this should be caught and appropriately punished. Is it wrong of me to think that there is a high likelihood this was done by a trump supporter?]
[Nope not at all there is no proof who did what. If the GOP wants to give Russia a pass on hacking they need to wait for actual evidence on this.]
[Thank you for correcting the record with your 13 day old account.]
['Correcting the record?" What do you mean? Yes my account is 13 days old. Do that mean I don't have a right to comment? Seriously I am not trolling what do you mean by " correcting the record?' Did I say something wrong? Why comment on my young account" how is that relative ? Thanks sir,]
[Nice try. It's well established what is going on here.]
[I give up. I honestly don't know what you mean. Good luck. Godsped.]
[> Is it wrong of me to think that there is a high likelihood this was done by a trump supporter? yes]
[This is the hate that the so-called-left have created. All of the insane and bewildering propaganda against Donald Trump has created this.]
[Why do you assume this is the work of Democrats or some "false-flag"? Trump said a few days ago that (presumably "establishment") Republicans are worse than "Crooked Hillary." The news media is full of reports of Republicans abandoning Trump right now.]
[I never said that. not even close. I said that this is the result of the hate created by the so-called left. You can't deny that people are fervently angry at Trump. You can't deny that the entire media apparatus is working to stoke those flames. There's blatant botting going on on r/[redacted]. Media is constantly twisting shit to make him seem like Hitler. There's a problem when notreddit.top looks the way it does.]
[Um, Trump sells "Hillary for prison" buttons on his website. We don't know who did the firebombing in NC yet - let's see what happens.]
[No he doesn't. That's Alex Jones but thanks for reinforcing everything digera just said in his post anyways.]
[Trump himself created that.]
[Bullshit. You're just slightly less brainwashed than the people who did this. There's a great bamboozling going on and you're a victim. Marxism is a scourge.]
[Who's to say you aren't the brainwashed one?]
[I was. I certainly was. I hated Donald Trump, too. It's hard not to when there's so many people telling you to, everywhere you look. I love the attitude a lot of you have.. as if there's some sort of intelligence requirement for hating Trump. There's people spoonfeeding you talking-points against him on every channel nearly 24/7. You actually have to dig to break free of it, and even harder, you actually have to care.]
[I dig, and I still hate him. I hated him before he chose to run for president. I don't need the media telling me this.]
[This isn't about being brainwashed. It's about people's opinions. We don't have to agree. The cowards out there who turn to violence are the clueless ones.]
[Wow. Someone with a brain. Prepare to be the target of a downvoting squad and to have all of your intelligent arguments broken down into nonsense and then spit back at you by the braindead. Also, and I am being dead serious, keep an eye on your scores and if you see a rational comment stuck at 1, sign out and click o the permalink because mods are deleting perfectly reasonable comments and they only still appear to you when you are signed in.]
[I've made posts that end up on notreddit.top within an hour :-P It's insane how blatant it is... How blatantly anti-intellectual the Marxist doctrine is. It makes it so easy for people to convince themselves that they are smart..... How do we get rid of it? How do we meme this all to a stop?]
[Unfortunately I think too many dominoes have already fallen. The sad reality is that human beings seemed doomed to make the same idiotic mistakes over and over again. If you don't live in the US, then you have a bit more time to watch the chaos unfold until it hits the breaking point and begins to affect whatever part of the world you are in. If you do live in the US, I would suggest finding a way to get the hell out. It is surprisingly easy to teach "English as a second language" in multiple parts of the world. It took me a single month to get trained, a sponsored work visa, and a full time job that pays extremely well. The psychopaths are in charge and the masses are a little too unintelligent (as a group) to realize they are being led to the exact conclusions that have already been decided for them to reach. Maybe some kind of "black swan event" or anomaly will happen that will wake everyone up and save us, but I am not holding my breath.]
[don't be so pessimistic :-D you gotta get off of reddit, you know they're all over this place. Head over to the chans and get your head straight. We're winning :-)]
[>Marxism is a scourge. Yeah, right, because Redscare Rodham is a Marxist.]
[marxism!=communism!=russia]
[http://imgur.com/a/rRdwv the difference is unreal....]
[Is anyone going to point out how long it took him to respond?]
[[It's true. The differences are unreal.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEMZSn8iLr4)]
[You know that Hillary didn't write that, right? Her staff is the one that posts to her Twitter, unless it has the "-H" at the end.]
[Okay? Do you really expect Hillary to say anything different than that tweet though? She would say the exact same thing. We *know* what Trump said, and it was despicable.]
[He is fanning the flames of hate with all his might. He wants his supporters to think of Democrats and Hillary as literal terrorists. He had an opportunity to unite everyone against these horrific acts. He voluntarily chose hatred and division instead.]
[In his defense, he only said it on Twitter because his campaign manager didn't take away his phone in time.]
[Trump just tweeted about it: >Animals representing Hillary Clinton and Dems in North Carolina just firebombed our office in Orange County because we are winning https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/787782613633208320]
[I strongly suspect it was an inside job.]
[Prob best to just wait and see before spreading info that we don't know. Could just as likely been some young anarchists,]
[I was just reselling the story of the 08 election where a McCain supporter or worker whatever was supposedly robbed and attacked (she had a B carved in her forehead.) Turned out she did it herself (the b was backwards lol.) But I would hardly be surprised.]
[Republican, Independent, or Democrat. We all have our differences. We're all voting for a candidate the other side won't like. Violence like this before the election is completely unacceptable.]
[you say that, but I see a lot of comments say "reap what you sow" which is creepy]
[Too late, Trump's first comment on the attack is to call the perpetrators "Animals who represent Hillary and the Dems in North Carolina..." If these terrorists represent the Democratic Party then the Democratic Party is a terrorist organization and progressives as people who support terrorism. Remember what Trump thinks about terrorists, "you have to take out there families." Trump does not see the election as a the will of the people, he is making it out to be a war of survival. Its disgraceful that he would use the attack to perpetuate that narrative, but hardly unexpected. https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/787782613633208320]
[I wish he focused it a little better but he wasn't wrong. I'd bet a kidney that those responsible were going to vote for her. I'd also bet that what they did was in part motivated by her deplorable comment. She is, indirectly, responsible.]
[Obviously without evidence that this is a false flag I'd never assume it is, but if I were you I'd wait for actual details before pledging body parts on the Internet.]
[Ha.]
[Saying that Hillary is responsible for domestic terrorism because she said those supporting Trump's ideology is deplorable is like claiming that American Muslims who harshly condemn American intervention in the Middle East are responsible for ISIS. People who use violence to push a political agenda do not represent anyone who respects American values, period. So unless you are saying that Hillary does not believe in America and actively opposes our way of life then these terrorists do *not* represent the Hillary. Freedom of speech, up to including the filth that Donald Trump tells his supports, is a core tenant of American values. We have the most lenient laws regarding hate speech in the world. We *protect* the right of the bigoted and intolerant to exercise their right to free speech even as they abuse that right. The jump from speech to violence, however, is a threshold that we do not cross.]
[Let's be honest, if anyone sees this attack and says: "I'm voting for Donald Trump! We need a president that brings people together!" Then, they were going to do it anyways, at this point.]
[Imagine if this were a Clinton HQ ]
[Obama would do nothing short of declaring martial law. (I'm joking...kinda) Let's be real though, if it were a Democratic HQ most of the news outlets would obviously show a similar sort of shock, but then in the following weeks you'd see 100+ "special reports", TV documentaries, and deep dives on the roiling undercurrent of hate and violence on the nasty, nasty Right. This situation though, unless another bit of news about it breaks, I guarantee we won't hear about it again after a day or two.]
[Does seem like this story would be about 1,000,000x bigger deal if Les Deplorables had targeted a Democratic property. 24/7 rolling coverage, with every elected Republican official expected to apologize for it. "DONALD, MIKE, REINCE, WILL YOU DISAVOW THIS OUTRAGEOUS ATTACK? DISAVOW DISAVOW DISAVOW DAVID DUKE"]
[$5 says this was staged the 'get out of town or else' sounds like something out of a bad 70s movie.]
[If this were a dem office the GOP response would be "How will Hillary stop ISIS if she can't stop her own offices from being attacked Benghazi." Glad no one was hurt.]
[If this were a dem office then nobody would hear anything over the "Trump tells supporters to create home-grown terrorist cells" rally-call that the media would scream to the ends of the Earth. They would find a clip of Trump saying "Don't trust the media, get out there and do your own research" and the media would highlight the headline **"TRUMP: GET OUT THERE"** and they would write hundreds of articles about how he was calling for community violence. Then the people on this subreddit would start commenting: "Trump literally told his supporters to go out and destroy stuff. This is not even funny anymore, this man is literally turning into Hitler and must be stopped."]
[Sad to say it mist likely wasn't Trump supporters running a false flag. The words were spelled right.]
[The best part about this comment is that you probably pride yourself on how 'open-minded' and 'tolerant' you are. Conservatives are all racist uneducated half-wits though, of course. *I'm* not prejudiced, derp.]
[It's cute how you create some false reality for your pathetic defense. I don't have to be tolerant of racist, sexist assholes who fuck little girls or those who support them.]
[Lmao true]
[> The words were spelled right. And yet yours were not.]
[Kind of the point of the joke...]
[Yeah let's not try to outdo the republicans in being shits, eh guys? Not being shits is like a primo category this election cycle.]
[Yet you didn't miss the opportunity to take a swipe at republicans]
[Not only is it disgusting, dangerous, and terroristic, it is also fucking stupid. If you support Clinton, this is not helping. Don't do this. Clinton is doing fine without wing-nut idiots trying to take matters into their own hands.]
[We don't know who did it yet.]
[Try? You guys outdid them long ago. This is just a perfect example of how "tolerant" the left is.]
[I'm by no means trying to encourage tolerance of the deplorable state of the right. Just not violence. If either side acts violently, they should go directly to jail, no pass go.]
[There has been violence on both sides admittedly, but the left has been much more violent by large margin against trump supporters.]
[really? http://americasvoice.org/trumphatemap/ here's a map of reports of all the violence Trump supporters have instigated against non-whites.]
[One of those women was called unpatriotic for saying "Buenos Dias" on TV!!!!!!!!! Grab your pitchforks!]
[Till violence is consider being booed on stage. This map is grasping at straws to the point they have twisted some of the incidents, like they listed the women from Wisconsin that was pepper sprayed for punching a [ man ] ( http://www.wkow.com/story/31601022/2016/03/Wednesday/update-15-year-old-pepper-sprayed-at-trump-rally-could-face-disorderly-conduct-charge )]
[Would you really pepper spray a 15 year old girl for hitting you in the face?]
[Yes, I would pepper spray anyone who tried to inflict bodily harm on me, especially if I were an elderly man.]
[Yes, yes I would. It's called self-defense. Would you really punch a person in the face and expect no retaliation?]
[A 15-year-old isn't clueless. She knew exactly what she was doing. Yes, she deserved to be pepper-sprayed for assaulting someone.]
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75XKGVwGEt4]
[This man was almost 60, in a year or two he would be considered Senior Citizen are you ok with hitting the elderly?]
[Yes. First off, I don't have her driver's license. I don't know that she's 15. All I know is that she hit me, and I should defend myself. And a 15 year old knows exactly what she's doing.]
[Booing is obviously a microaggression, and everybody knows aggression is violence. Unless it's the left booing, then it's just them using freedom of speech.]
[&gt; let's not try to outdo the republicans in being shits, eh guys? http://imgur.com/gallery/44jJY www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMux_UHmpvc Yeah. You're really grasping at straws here compared to actual violence from the left.]
[that's a nice bit of propaganda you guys put together. trying really hard now.]
[Lol. You literally linked to something called "Trump's Hate Map". Which is also propaganda.]
[sourced is the key word you're looking for.]
[Do you actually believe the things you type???? Serious question.]
[Its just clips of things that actually happened...]
[Show me one example of violence from Trump supporters that was not provoked.]
[> http://americasvoice.org/trumphatemap/]
[As a Trump supporter there has definitely been violence from other Trump supporters this election season. Not as much as the left, but still some. Protesters were punched at Trump rallys and even though they're protesting there was no need to assault them.]
[That is in no way Trump encouraging violence. Why are you trying to equate that? Trump has hundreds of millions of supporters, he can't control what they all do.]
[And Hillary can't control what hers do. But she isn't making villains out of huge swaths of the country until recently when her hand was forced by THEIR actions because THEIR lord and savior has been spewing a hateful rhetoric this whole time.]
[You were replying to someone who said that Trump supporters haven't been violent, but there has been. Has Trump encouraged it? If you consider the whole paying legal fees thing as encouraging violence, but that's about it.]
[I'm pretty fucking confident that if one single second of footage with Trump encouraging violence against people existed, that none of his detractors would have the slightest trouble or hesitation in providing it. Yet no one on the internet can show it to me...]
[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/video/news/video-1248837/Donald-Trump-hitting-protesters-pay-legal-fees.html This is the worst it'll get. He said if anyone tries to throw a tomato at him he wants people to knock them out and he'll pay the legal fees. It was blown up like crazy on this shit subreddit awhile back when it happened IIRC.]
[Self defense extends to other people as well. If you attack someone in defense of another person who is being attacked, that counts as self defense.]
["Maybe my second amendment people can do something about it"]
[Here ya go pal, now that the rest of the planet has absorbed this already you get a chance: http://www.nytimes.com/video/us/100000004269364/trump-and-violence.html]
[Again, that's not Trump encouraging violence. That's Trump encouraging security guards to throw out hooligans and troublemakers at his rallies. Encouraging law, order and security is not encouraging violence. Nice try at false equivalence though...]
[First rule: don't be an asshole (I have been known to break this rule on occasion)]
[> let's not try to outdo the republicans in being shits, eh guys? http://imgur.com/gallery/44jJY www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMux_UHmpvc]
[Why do people keep acting like any attack on Trump or Trump supporters have to have been done by Democrats/Hillary supporters? Are you that deluded that you can't tell that a significant number of people *hate* Trump. Not just liberals but conservatives and people who don't identify with any politics. He is an incredibly controversial candidate.]
[Why would a Trump supporter attack another Trump supporter? It had to have been done by someone who doesn't like Trump. Which leaves Democrats.]
[So there's only Trump supporters or Democrats? That's what you think makes up the entire US population? And only democrats dislike Trump?]
[I'm saying in practice only those two candidates matter and they're the only ones with any real voter base. So... Yes. It's either Republicans or Democrats. The Green party is hilariously tiny, the Libertarian party is a wart on the backside of either of the parties, and there's really no inbetween.]
[Almost half of US voters identify as independent. Just because a voter may lean toward one candidate doesn't make them a Hillary or Trump supporter or a Democrat or Republican. Especially in this election where a lot of Democrats hate Hillary and a lot of Republicans hate Trump. I know complex thinking isn't a strong point for you guys, but there's more than this "us vs. them"]
[>half of U.S. voters consider themselves independent My sides. If that were the case we'd have had way more independent representatives in the house and senate. Kek.]
[http://www.gallup.com/poll/188096/democratic-republican-identification-near-historical-lows.aspx you'll find this illuminating]
[Considering the incredible amount of candidates that were still in the race back then, as well as the fact that that's not even close to half, (liar) I'd say that this one source, taken from nearly a year ago, when the political landscape was vastly different back then, is probably not the ideal metric to base your opinions on.]
[nice copypasta]
[WTH. Whats wrong with people?]
[Easy there, no evidence that points out the political motivation of this attack aside from what looks like a really forced and unauthentic message on a building that sounds like a Hardy Boy's plot or like I said in a previous comment something Michael Scott would say.]
[Seriously. This is despicable behavior, and who ever is responsible deserves jail time for sure. I really hope we don't see people on the left accuse this of being some kind of republican false flag without there being any evidence of that. The right thing to do is harshly condemn this behavior, because it is wrong.]
[The behavior should be very harshly condemned, and at the same time there is both the obvious possibility that the perpetrators were Clinton supporters, and there is also the equally obvious possibility that the perpetrators were Trump supporters. The political beneficiary is Trump. Whoever did it, either got lucky that nobody got hurt, or they knew nobody would be there and the damage just some supplies and furniture. Keep an open mind and see where the evidence goes, if any is found/revealed.]
[False flag, no. But would you have trouble believing this was the first act in the Republican civil war?]
[Would I have trouble believing it? absolutely not, *if there is evidence.* I'm sorry, but if I saw Trumpsters making these accusations in the immediate aftermath of a democrat office firebombing, I would be thinking the same thing; deplorable! It's no difference here, I can easily believe that frustrated anti-Trump people took things too far.]
[The general attitude in Conservaworld right now is rather.... frenzied. And that's the evidence I used to come to this hypothesis. Could I be wrong? Maybe. But there's also no evidence this was liberals. Regardless of who this was, fuck those guys.]
[> But there's also no evidence this was liberals. . >The words, “Nazi Republicans get out of town or else” were spray painted on the side of an adjacent building. wew]
[If this is the narrative the left takes, without any corroborating evidence, it will only seen as callous and despicable from the right. It is better to not give them reason to embolden and rally around the idea that leftists support violence against republicans. The right thing to do is condemn actions of violence. If it comes out that it was indeed false flag, then that's another can of worms, but I would not jump to that conclusion a priori.]
[Who's supporting violence? Not me. I'm saying there are factions who are currently advocating violence in response to a democratic election. And those folks are all voting Trump.]
[Yes, they are. And when they go low, we go high. We don't have to immediately jump to victim blaming because we consider them to be deplorables. I'm asking people on the left to see this through objective lenses, and not immediately jump to conspiracy theories, because that's how *they* behave, not how we should behave. Being objective, imagine if the reverse happened, our office was firebombed, and without any evidence whatsoever, Trump supporters immediately went to victim blaming and accused us of doing it ourselves? That's probably what they would do, but it's not right, and we are not them.]
[Considering nobody got hurt, and the main beneficiary would be Trump, and that Clinton already has the election in the bag, I'm certainly open to the idea that this could be a desperate move by a Trump supporter. The obvious consequence is that Trump supporters are going to triple their outrage and energy, and left-wing people will have to sort of take a defensive tone. I think there are two obvious possibilities: a Clinton supporter, or a Trump supporter. Let's wait for evidence. A third less obvious possibility is a Russian agent in the US.]
[but why would anti trump people do this? there's no frustration on the Clinton side, she's beating him.]
[Just because she's winning, doesn't mean there's not frustration over the shit Trump does and says, as well as his supporters. Additionally, not everyone knows Clinton is winning, or by how much. Most people that I talk to in real life pay very little attention to the polls, they have never heard of 538 etc. Trump supporters on my Facebook feed are *absolutely convinced* that Trump has a huge lead over Clinton, somehow. It's not a stretch that there are Clinton supporters out there who are simply misinformed. But either way, there is a lot of anger on both sides.]
[ok sorry, that makes sense. I keep forgetting how disconnected US voters are.]
[Why would there be frustration on Clinton supporters, when by all realistic accounts, she has this election in the bag? The only beneficiary to this act is Trump. That's not proof, but I think that should be a factor in evaluating the probabilities of who might have perpetrated this horrible act.]
[No the right thing to do is immediately bring up false flag without any evidence of it being a false flag, because that is totally honest and unbiased!]
[I really hope we don't see people on the left accuse this of being some kind of republican false flag without there being any evidence of that. Literally the first thing that happened in this thread.]
[>This is despicable behavior Deplorable?]
[Absolutely.]
[If you support trump or hilary, you should be disgusted. I would be if this happened to the DHQ and im a Republican]
[Have an upvote from a Democrat.]
[Well yeah, obviously.]

Very grateful that everyone is safe. https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/787763497308418052]
[Why does he know who did it ahead of time..?]
[Reminder: Trump [declared "war" on the GOP](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/trump-declares-war-on-gop-229593), and one of the three men arrested in Kansas plotting to bomb a mosque and apartment complex is a [confirmed Trump supporter](http://www.politicususa.com/2016/10/14/men-arrested-plot-car-bomb-mosque-trump-supporter.html). This is why inflammatory rhetoric like Trump's is dangerous.]
[that makes no sense whatsoever.]
[Nor does a Trump presidency, yet here we are.]
[Reminder: The Orlando night club shooter supported Clinton. See how easy that is? This is why logical fallacies are dangerous. Hitler was a vegetarian. Therefore, all vegetarians are Nazis.]
[And the republican candidate just blamed Clinton for the crime...]
[Well it was probably done by someone Anti-Trump, so good guess that it's a Democrat.]
[I don't know, Trump supporters do hate the GOP now that they are abandoning Trump. A smart person would wait until we know more of the facts before making accusations.]
[There are nutjobs on both sides, who support both candidates. The difference is there are a minority of those whack jobs on the left and a majority on the right.]
[> minority of those whack jobs on the left and a majority on the right. Ha, ok. Proof, /u/copkiller22 ?]
[Ummm how about anyone still supporting Trump? I think that qualifies at this point.]
[Not really. I support Trump and have never set a building on fire. You have a username which seems to promote violence against cops.]
[I didn't say all Trump supporters are violent, just confused and probably not very intelligent. How you can support his views is beyond me. To actually believe he cares about anything other than himself and his wealth? How can you not see through all the bullshit lies he spews every time he opens his mouth? And yes, I believe the majority of cops are corrupt and the police culture of violence and intimidation is something that needs changed. If they need a taste of their own medicine, so be it. "What do I say to a dead cops wife? Cops kill my peoples everyday, that's life." -- Talib Kweli]
[I support him because he supports law & order.]
[So rape is lawful and orderly? His white trash/white power supporters that promote hate crimes are lawful? His illegal business conduct is lawful? Gimme a fuggin break!]
[> So rape is lawful and orderly? Did he rape someone? Or are you referring to Bill Clinton? >His white trash/white power supporters that promote hate crimes are lawful? Are you referring to KKK nembers, like Robert Byrd, who has close ties to the Clintons? >His illegal business conduct is lawful? Well, at least he doesn't take donations (bribes) from Middle-Eastern countries & then use his political position to send those countries munitions. Gimme a fuggin break!]
[Trump specifically declared a war on the GOP, because they didn't fall in line behind him. He has targeted GOP elites with his rhetoric. It wouldn't take much to push one of his rabid followers to attack a GOP campaign office in a false flag attempt to smear dems. Remember Ashley Todd, who claimed she was beat up by Obama supporters who carved a "B" on her face? After investigation it was learned she did it to herself to malign Obama. The ONLY candidate preaching violence right now is Trump.]
[1) Why is it bad that he declared war on the GOP? I don't want him beholden to a political party 2) Rabid followers? Trump supporters have been violently assaulted by democrats. 3) The MSM uses ugly rhetoric against Trump 24/7, don't you think if CNN compares him to Hitler, someone will take it literally?]
[> Why is it bad that he declared war on the GOP? The rhetoric is that the GOP must be punished. [Trump’s Attacks on GOP Leaders Ignite Civil War Inside Party](http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-10-11/trump-says-it-s-hard-to-do-well-with-zero-support-from-ryan) "Disloyal R’s are far more difficult than Crooked Hillary. They come at you from all sides. They don’t know how to win - I will teach them!" -Trump That's all it would take to inspire one of his fringe followers to do something crazy, then play the victim card.]
[Ah, then why would they call Republicans Nazis? I think you're pushing really hard to force the narrative that it was a Trump supporter who did this.]
[[video of Trump supporters leaving a rally and being greeted by tolerant protesters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEMZSn8iLr4)]
[trump supporters are literally supporting a violent mini hitler who talks about beating up protesters, silencing the media, and throwing his political opponents in jail. and im barely scratching the surface. so ya im not going to treat you nice for supporting this racist sex criminal fascist idiot.]
[If you want to be a snarky dick to someone on a reddit post, that's annoying but okay. You are voicing your opinion. If you want to perform, incite or otherwise be party to violence against those you don't agree with, that makes you an asshole. It doesn't matter what you support when your answer is violence, because the act of violence itself in that capacity is unacceptable.]
[no, thats ENOUGH. dont you see what this dialouge is doing? we have to make amends now between the right and left before it starts snowballing and we end up like the middle east. and im voting hillary for what its worth. though trumps latest tweet isn't helping matters, and just stoking the fire.]
[LITERALLY A VIOLENT MINI HITLER!!!!! My God, how could I have been so blind!!!!!!]
[Y'know I honestly can't believe I missed the mustache when I saw him in Panama City. Really should have been paying better attention I guess.]
[Are you mentally ill, or do you just normally equate people who have not murdered anyone with someone who was behind killing 12 million? What constitutes a mini hitler? Wouldn't that still require dead people?]
[Coming from someone who was at the San Jose rally, fuck you. Fuck you for being a piece of shit encouraging violence just for having differing political views. I don't give a fuck if you're a Hillary/Johnson/Stein/any other third party supporter, the thought of physically intimidating and/or injuring other has never even crossed my mind. Do you really not see how incredibly ironic it is for you to call Trump Hitler, yet advocate for violence?]
[>Hitler In the bin your argument goes]
[I want everyone to read shit like this and realize how far demogaugery has gotten in this place, forget the fact that you equate someones political views with the Nazis. You would treat someone differently due to their political beliefs? You excuse violence towards them because of it? What the hell is the matter with you? Huh. Most Democrats in this thread are ok just fyi.]
[I mean, we have radio hosts calling Clinton and Obama LITERAL demons. Like, actually possessed by demons, or demons themselves. So yeah, it's gotten far in the country, and reddit is just a reflection of that.]
[god bless america]
[It is always interesting seeing people talk about how violent and dangerous the right is, but most the violence I have seen this election has become from people opposing the republicans, not the Republicans themselves]
[A decent portion of the political right in the US has held extreme views for years, it's only in recent years that a good portion of the left has started to get just as bad... and that includes people who have no problem resorting to violence.]
[poor/dumb/angry are on both sides.]
[Slightly off topic but in cases like this it would be really useful if we could tag the title of the post with the state it occurred in. Based on reading the article and the fact it's the Charlotte Observer I figured out it was NC but my gut reaction was that this occurred in either CA, NY, or FL since they all have higher profile Orange Counties than NC. That having been said where it occurred really doesn't matter since this is a tragedy that shouldn't happen anywhere in the US.]
[This is bullshit if they are supporting Kim Jong Un for president they should be able too without being firebombed.]
[They need to find the perps ASAP and dispense justice for politically motivated arson, but BATF and others will probably just start the investigation. There should for more police presence around each party HQs until Nov 8 meantime due to this inflammatory election. *Add* parties should put hidden cams at their facility perimeters ... they sell some small but powerful cams, cams that blink red with motion detectors to ward off trespassers, etc..]
[It doesn't matter if your political affiliation is democrat, republican, or anything else. When you resort to inciting violence against a political ideology you oppose, you're forgetting a major aspect of politics; just as you have the freedom to believe what you believe, they have the freedom to believe what they believe. Inciting this kind of violence also shows how uncaring and ignorant humans have become. Having a political affiliation that disagrees with your own doesn't make somebody a bad person, nor does it make somebody any less human. This could have killed somebody, and I doubt whoever did it cares. That's a scary thought.]
[Not like this.]
[Hope this isn't the start of a pattern]
[Wow this election just gets crazier. I hope things cool off and things get back to the issues]
[Popcorn flair seems kind of in poor taste]
[lol I disagree. Needs more butter for all the salt.]
[I hope they'll catch who ever did this, violence only breed violence. Can't wait for this election to be over]
[Whoever did this deserves to be tried and imprisoned]
[Have they not learned anything from my girl Michele Obama. Disgraceful, I'm glad everyone is okay.]
[Disgusting. Partisanship has gotten so bad that politics is now inspiring acts of terrorism.]
[As someone who lives and goes to school in Hillsborough, it's crazy how much we've been in the news recently. First with the English teacher comparing Trump to Hitler (Shouldn't have been news) and now something as wild as this. Fucking hell.]
[That is so unwelcome. People could have gotten killed. This whole shit election has brought out a lot of ugly in a lot of people but maybe we should make much more love and a lot less war. It is healthier.]
[Are we living in the 1960's? C'mon people]
[This is disappointing to hear. I hope they can bring justice to the culprits and we can start to thaw our politics. It's not worth the violence.]
[well shit. at least nobody's hurt. But it could well hurt politically. Disgraceful madness.]
[That's horrible and there is no excuse for it. I hope whoever did it spends a long while in prison.]
[Let the civil war begin. Or as Donald Trump calls it. Intense Tweeting.]
[i mean, that sheriff did call for pitchforks AND torches.]
[I think this crisis calls for an important question: why does every state have an Orange county?]
[It represents the Anglo Saxon Protestant Order.]
["I bet Hillary Told them to do it" - Sean Hannity Really though this will be used against each other.]
[God dammit this is what happens when you spread bullshit lies to divide our country. Both of the major parties has extremists and this is a clear example. And I hope nobody retaliates in response to this but I've been wrong before. This is vandalism, possibly even domestic terrorism. It's fucking deplorable and shame on anyone who condones this.]
[So sorry to hear. We can't let this happen again. And I hope people of all political backgrounds can come together to help them clean up and rebuild.]
[0 tolerance. Whoever did this needs to be treated like the criminal scum they are. I don't care if they are democrat or support Bernie or Gary or Stien. they are criminal scum. This is absolutely unacceptable.]
[It's sad to see this, 2016 has not been good to my state. I love my home and this country and it's hard to see it becoming so divided. I'm only 23 and I've voted when I could and have held faith in common brotherhood but it feels because it's been going this way for so long that there was or is nothing I could ever truly do about it.]
[Might want to specify what state, as you could have a lot of OC residents worried about their backyard.]
[Wow. I'm glad everyone is safe and I hope this doesn't get politicized.]
[Lol]
[It was Marinus van der Lubbe, I'm *sure* of it!]
[Terrible, I hate the GOP as much as the next guy but this is a whole other level]
[So many people on all sides are constantly attacking our democracy...]
[Jesus christ, just use words.]
[I consider myself a pretty progressive liberal and even though I can get frustrated with politics I disagree with, I don't think violence is ever the answer to these issues. I'm so sorry for anyone out there who's feared for their loved ones and I hope that community in NC is united instead of stratified by this incident]
[I want to get off 2016's wild ride. ;-;]
[I am not a Trump supporter but violence of any kind is NOT the answer. I hope everyone no matter where you stand politically will speak out against violence.]
[This is terrible. This is the last thing this election needs. People are wound up enough as it is. The community there didn't deserve this, even if you disagree with them.]
[This action is utterly deplorable. Nobody deserves to get physically harmed over this.]
[Looks like [The Donald](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/787782613633208320) has already decided who's responsible.]
[I'm hoping it's some pissed off right winger just so I can watch their heads explode.]
[From the newer threads, politics seems to think it's a false flag Alex Jones situation.]
["Molotovs don't melt yard signs!"]
["If you look at the pictures! There are some intact signs! That somehow survived a fire of more than 800 degrees! Even though they're thin plastic!"]
[Yeah, I saw some of that. Hard to say though, until an investigation. I'm not about to jump and assume anything, that only fans the flames.]
[Oh fuck.]
[Deplorable people simply exist]
[wow its almost as if demonizing one side constantly and acting like theyre going to be the fall of man or nazis that genocide everyone or whatever encourages this sort of shit this is the direct fault of subs like this and news propaganda nicely done guys]
[And who's to blame for the planned attacks in Kansas? That demonization is present on both sides of the fence, friendo.]
[racists get their rhetoric from other racists dnc extremists got their rhetoric directly from cnn you tell people "omg this man is hitler were doomed" enough and some people will take it seriously if you post here regularly and join in the circlejerk then youre partially responsible]
[American politics in general. It's becoming incredibly divisive.]
[This was self harm designed to malign the opposition. I guarantee it.]
[Yeah, sure it was. And these were all paid actors right? Fake blood? THE RUSSIAN SPIES?!!? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ1kVIDiBvY&feature=youtu.be]
[The Russians did it!!]
[No. Orange County NC is crazy left-wing.]
[You know what, reading all these comments, and people saying that they dislike Trump, but they don't condone shit like this, yes you did. When Hillary called Trump supporters deplorables, and irredeemable racists, and you cheered it on, said things like, "only half of his supporters?", you condoned this. When the Trump supporter was pelted with rotten eggs outside of a Trump rally, you said "look at what she was doing! She was asking for it and laughing about it!" You condoned this. Hillary, her campaign, her super PACs, the MSM, and every one who posts in this subreddit without a 10 minute wait period, labeling everyone who supports Trump as some kind of subhuman, you made this happen. All your anti-hate, anti-bigotry, anti-racism, anti-sexism, and anti-fascism, all these things that you people claim to be against, just look in the mirror to find the perfect example of the people you claim to hate. All these claims of hate coming from the Trump campaign, but the only supporters I see being beaten, and their children pepper sprayed are Trump supporters. And do you people really think this shit is going to get better if Hillary is in office? The woman who tweeted, "White people need to listen to legitimate cries from black people" the day after 5 police officers were gunned down by a black supremacist in Dallas. Many of you who post here having been suckling the teets of the MSM for too long, just reading the headlines and getting pissed off about things Trump never even did or said, in many cases creating new meanings to what he actually said to fit your narrative.]
[Absolutely pathetic attempt to blame this on Hillary and her supporters. Despite all the *valid* characterizations of Trump as a deplorable fascist, xenophobic, sexist, etc, Hillary never called for *any* violence. Yet you look the other way when trump calls for violence against people he disagrees with at his rallies, or calls for voter intimidation, or his surrogates call for literal riots.]
["deplorable fascist, xenophobic, sexist, ect" And they fucking deserve to be fire bombed. What was it the Nazis used to described the Jews, gypsies, and handicap? How did they convince the everyday people that what they were doing was ok? Undesirables? Just because you throw all these labels at Trump and the people who support him, doesn't make them true. It's dehumanizing. So when Hillary Clinton puts these labels on Trump supporters, people lose empathy for them. They're not slashing the tires of someone who works 9-5, and has to drive their kids to school in the morning, and then sit in rush hour traffic. They're slashing the tires of a racist, xenophobic, sexist, bigot, **deplorable**. The MSM, which is basically the propaganda branch of the Hillary campaign, perpetuates bullshit story after bullshit story about these "racist" Trump supporters to the point where those with a liberal bias believe that everyone who supports Trump must be a racist Nazi. Even in this thread there's people comparing Trump supporters to brown shirts. Hillary, her campaign, her super PACs, and the MSM may not have directly called for violence, but they sure as shit dehumanized the people who support Trump so much that no one on the left has any sympathy for them. They're deplorables.]
[> And they fucking deserve to be fire bombed. Yea, that's what I said. /s No, me throwing labels at Trump doesn't make it true, you're right. Trump's own actions make him a fascist when he whips up his fanatics into a frenzy against the media and threatens journalists, when he threatens to imprison his political opponent and anyone who may have helped her, when he screams ultra-nationalistic and anti-"others" rhetoric, and checks off everything on a fascism list. You're the only one dehumanizing them. Fascists are still humans. Being fascist doesn't mean you deserve violence, which may explain why Hillary has never called for violence, unlike Trump. And when Hillary, who's never called for violence, should be held responsible for this firebombing (despite having no suspects yet), Trump, who *has* called for violence and continuously verbally assaults minorities, gets a total pass on those white nationalists that were arrested earlier for conspiring to blow up an apartment complex full of Somalians, right? Is he going to get a pass for the voter intimidation that's going to happen on Election Day? Is he going to get a pass when his supporters call Hillary the devil and possibly even riot the day after? > The MSM, which is basically the propaganda branch of the Hillary campaign, perpetuates bullshit story after bullshit story How ironic. I heard Trump say basically the same thing a couple days ago, and now you're spewing the same bullshit story about "the MSM" being Hillary's propaganda. Yea, we should all get our news only from infowars, breitbart, the god emperor's Twitter, and other bs sites like the Moonie Times and gatewaypundit, right?]
[I was arguing with this dude as well. Bet he doesn't respond to either of our sane arguments and in two days deletes his account. That's how they operate on Reddit. Outlandish claims in the hopes of garnering extremist responses from redditors and then using said responses to support their own claims of oppression and farming karma on the Donald sub. Every alt right fuck face I've conversed with has deleted his account soon after they've failed to get a "kill all trump supporter" comment from me.]
[Get back in the basket.]
[Absolutely true and well said.]
[I don't see how calling people mean names is condoning straight terrorist acts. It doesn't even make sense. Hurt feelings much? Take it to your safe space sub, you'll get more up votes there chief.]
[We only have to travel back 78 years, to this country named Deutschland, to see what "mean names" does to a nation. The National Socialist German Workers Party never ordered anyone to destroy Jewish shops, homes, and synagogues, but on the night of November 9th, 1938, the German people took it upon themselves to do so. It wasn't a government sanctioned action. At that point in time, the Jews were just undesirables, a blight upon Germany. Deplorables, you might call them. I mean, it was just mean names that they were calling them, what's the harm in that?]
[Negative chief. The active victimization and removal of Jews was a central idea to official nazi doctrine. It's why Einstein got the hell out of dodge. So yeah, those actions were condoned by the government. Try again. btw, comparing political opponents to nazis as a first ditch effort doesn't make you smart or aware to historical trends or whatever the fuck you like to think. It's low hanging fruit.]
[You're thinking of the absolute theory, the theory that Hitler wanted to massacre all the Jews from day one. This isn't the widely accepted theory of what happened. The most widely accepted theory is that it was a progression from hating the undesirables, to deporting them, to the "final solution". This theory is the most accepted and most supported by evidence. The evidence shows that it was a slow progression from simply hating Jews and other undesirables to all of extermination of them. Why even bother making deals with the Zionist Jews in Palestine to deport German Jews with all their wealth to Palestine if the intent was to murder them all? Kristallnacht was never ordered by the party, nor condoned by the National Socialist party, but I'm sure as shit that all their anti-Jew propaganda led to that event.]
[BULLSHIT. Hitler wrote during his time in prison that all of Germany's woes were due to the Jews, and they needed to be removed from German society. It was a central tenant of nazi ideology and aryan superiority. I didn't say that the final solution was canon from the get go, BUT the subjugation and discrimination of them. So you're wrong again junior. Reading comprehension is a useful skill. But why the fuck are we even having this discussion? It's not relevant to modern American politics. And what are you trying to get at? That the modern American left, largely comprised of working/professional people want to exterminate you? That you're justified for fearing for you and your families lives from a bunch of anti gun, sjw liberal cucks? You're not making any sense.]
["first ditch effort" Please. Trump has been compaired to Hitler since day 1. His supporters are being called brown shirts in this very thread. I'm just showing how the Hillary campaign and her supporters are more representative of Nazis than Trump and his supporters.]
[You're right, in that some leftists went to the nazi thing right away. I'll give you that. But It's like I tell my liberal friends, "dude that's low effort and it doesn't contribute to the political discourse." But that doesn't mean it isn't true. Comparing 2016 Democrats or republicans to 1937 nazis is low effort as fuck and it doesn't make you smarter than anyone else who has read a book or a Wikipedia article since high school.]
[well said +1]
[lol, nope. In no way do any of those things condone acts of violence.]
[I would 110% condone effective use of property crime. This, if anything, politically benefits Trump, so I wouldn't condone it.]
[How does telling the truth about Trump or his supporters condone violence against him? Sure, many of his supporters have the morals of brick, and less intelligence, but they are still people, and should not be violently attacked. There will always be extremists, and extremism on one side breeds extremism on the other, the majority do not support the violence of either of those extremists. And painting Hillary as some sort of rabble-rousers of black liberal is ridiculous. The first thing she tweeted after the shooting: "I mourn for the officers shot while doing their sacred duty to protect peaceful protesters, for their families & all who serve with them. -H". Stop whining about the mainstream media, stop reading Breitbart, an grow a heart and a brain.]
["the truth" Am I an irredeemable racist, a deplorable? Do you believe that? Is that the truth about people who you've never even met?]
[You might be. The point - and one that you seem incapable of understanding - is that even if you are, and even if you are publicly condemned as one, it is still not acceptable to physically attack you. There's no question about that.]
[And the point that you missed was that dehumanizing people makes others lose empathy for them. The German people had no empathy for the Jews being removed from their homes and into ghettos. How do you think the Nazis were able to do all of that without outcries from the people? They dehumanized them for so long that they were less than human.]
[There's something wrong if you need to feel a close connection of empathy with someone in order to refrain from attacking them. And there were tons of outcries against the Nazis in the early years. Then that became rather unsafe so people stopped.]
[>that became rather unsafe so people stopped. \#BlueLivesMatter I don't need to feel a close connection to anyone to see how fucking up their property can royally fuck them. It's the dehumanizing people who that others don't even care about the person they're fucking over that I'm talking about. When you dehumanize a subsect of people, they're no longer seen as people. They're just deplorables, so who gives a fuck?]
[As long as you are privy that you can fall under the same hypnotic spell of the media you consume, then I welcome your comment. My visceral reaction is that you are also high on your kool aid but I don't want to make such a rash assumption. I hope that you are able to hold moderate views on the situation. this is just what politics is]
[I support Trump for issues that the MSM isn't even covering, real issues that will affect millions of people in America and the rest of the world. Someone asked me the other day why I supported Trump, and I feel like my answer then is applicable here: >Trade agreements are my biggest issue. >NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement) opened up our borders to businesses within North America. Companies could move factories to Mexico to create jobs, and for cheaper labor than in the US. Sounds great, right? But it put millions of people in Mexico and the US out of work. Low skill labor jobs like factory work moved to Mexico, while skilled labor jobs being done in Mexico were eliminated by the US. Open borders for Big Corporate, but closed borders for people. >Millions of farmers in Mexico were put out of work because of how much our government subsidizes farmers in the US. Our government pays farmers to not grow crops, that's how much corn we produce. So selling our crops for dirt cheap in Mexico put so many people out of work. After NAFTA, illegal immigration skyrocketed. In order for Mexicans to make a living wage, they had to come to America illegally. >Now look at the TPP (Trans-Pacific Partnership), it's looking to do the same exact thing with Asian countries. Big Corporate will move their factories to third world countries with lax labor laws, decrease their spending, while you still spend $700 on your iPhone 8. > The only people who win from these trade agreements are the already filthy rich. We'll still pay the same exact price for goods, while they increase their profit margins. >Americans lose out because their jobs are being shipped overseas, and third world countries lose out because their people are being exploited. >And you think it's just low level factory work that's going to be outsourced? Hillary wants a massive increase of the H1B1 visas, where major tech companies can hire immigrants at a fraction of the price of Americans. Oh yeah, you'll be hearing "They took 'er jobs!" from people with software engineering and computer science degrees, not just rednecks. >On top of that, he's one of the most socially liberal Republican nominees in decades. On social issues like gay marriage, he doesn't give a fuck. Transsexuals using the bathroom they desire? Let them use the damn restroom! >Everything the media paints him out to be, you can heavily research and find out that they skipped context and they're wrong. This isn't shit that I dug up from the MSM, this is stuff I've been following for years. In my Politics class, I had a pretty damn good professor. I still don't know which way he leaned because his teaching style was so impartial. He had us do all the "political compass" sights for extra credit, and where one sight would have you on the left, the next would have you on the right, they're all bullshit. The number one thing I learnt from him was to not base my judgment from one source. Look at Fox News, CNN, Al Jazeera, and even Xinhua. I was really lucky to have the Snowden leaks happen while I was in that class. That was an amazing discussion. I learned a *lot* about politics and the shitstorm that ensued that semester.]
[There are some issues regarding policy that I don't understand or have honestly taken the time to understand. I try to ignore the bashing and smearing. I do agree with progressive values though, and I dislike a lot of conservative ideas. Although trump may not be considered one, it is likely he will appoint people and have people by his side who are, and those will be the people making the decisions and writing and speaking and influencing the country more specifically. It's pretty fucking sad to see how everything has devolved, but I can only assume that previous elections have had their own share of mudslinging. I think I seem to have on my "radar" different issues than you have expressed here, which may or may not make me ignorant in my own right. It's difficult to parse through the media and get the information one needs, and it takes even more time to understand the nitty gritty details and how they will truly influence this country. People agree and disagree on the same issues, so fortunately for me, I can't be wrong all the time! :(]
[Well, what issues are important to you? I'm a completely biased source, but at least I'm honest about where I stand.]
[What's the over/under on this being a false flag type of thing? Most lefties I know ain't the firebombing type. Most righties I know... seem to have lost their fucking minds.]
[How many events have been real false flags?]
[Depends on the size of your tinfoil hat? Seriously though. How many have beens are irrelevant to current events... The more I think about this firebombing, the less likely it seems that some sort of... anti-republicans from the area are behind it.]
[This was printed yesterday in Brietbart.com which is run by Trump's campaign manager. "So the Republican civil war is under way. Whether Trump wins or loses, the party establishment will use every weapon in its arsenal to purge the party not only of Trump’s policy ideas but Trump’s followers as well....... That rebellion is now an open civil war within the Republican party, and that is a shame. But at least it is a war over real issues, real concerns, and real worries over the safety and survival of our nation. And that, my friends, will always be a war worth fighting." http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/10/15/republican-party-leaders-plot-purge-civil-war/ I realize the author was speaking metaphorically but I'm not so sure that some of his supporters can tell the difference.]
[Do you really think DJT devotees know what a metaphor is?]
[I'll bet anything Trumpies did it to frame HRC supporters.]
[No. Carrboro Anarchists. Anarachists still exist in Carrboro, and they are the sweetest, most good natured people I've ever met.]
[It's unnecessary to say aloud.]
[It's very necessary.]
[Just let it be, it will be known soon enough]
[nvm, media will blame this on trump as usual anyway]
[Look, there is no "media". Everything YOU are writing on this public forum is the media. Trump is a doucebag and I can't wait for him to fail. This isn't Trumps fault though. Even if it has been a Democrat headquarters, it's not Trumps fault. People are stupid, but I'm pretty sure this a sign of someone who is mentally unstable.]
[>Look, there is no "media". Everything YOU are writing on this public forum is the media. Cool man, I'm on quaaludes tonight too.]
[oh no trump says mean things!]
[The fuck does that have to do with their comment? Haha. Classic Trump supporter. Hilarious. If only you could realize shitposting in DotA threads and circlejerking in /r/The_Donald is not how elections are won. If it was you'd have this election in the bag! :)]
[There is most definitely a media. They are the people on TV trying to manipulate your opinion.]
[Everyone is trying to change everyone's opinion. That's how societies work! Shocker!]
[CNN already has]
[Nobody should blame this on Trump. But Trump's response is *completely* inappropriate.]
[> But Trump's response is completely inappropriate. To be fair, inappropriateness is what makes it a genuine Trump response. At this point I'd be super suspicious and start throwing out the conspiracy theories if he had come out with a well-reasoned reply.]
[CNN is already turning this on trump.]
[That'll change their minds /s]
[I'm really glad to be alive for this election. Everything is turning ugly and batshit crazy. Everything is unprecedented, history in the making. Students will look back at this year and say "That's the year everything went insane and we all vowed to calm the fuck down". I'm not gonna point the finger at who I reckon did it cause at this point it could be anyone. Hillary supporters, Bernie supporters, Trump supporters post pussygate fallout. Hell maybe the GOP did it themselves for the publicity. I'd even go as far as to suggest one of the candidates themselves did or Obama orchestrated it cause he's just done with this shit. The world of politics is so crazy right now, I'm not surprised.]
[> Everything is unprecedented, history in the making. Tell that to an American who watched their political leaders and their president get assassinated, just a few decades ago. This shit is lightweight, harden up.]
[Let's hope this is one of those times.]
[I don't like how some people are jumping to conclusions as to who perpetrated this bombing. Let's at least wait until we get more details.]
[It's coming up in the next debate. I hope the evidence comes up rather quickly.]
[But reddit told me that Trump is the one calling for violence.]
[Well, he did call for interpersonal violence against protesters, hatred for the media covering his rallies, voter intimidation at the polls, distrust for our democratic process and its results, and... he might've mentioned an armed revolt? That last one could've just been a surrogate. There's so many of these that it's hard to remember. But I guess he hasn't called for firebombing *specifically.* On the flip side I'm not aware of anything remotely violent Hillary has said, implied, insinuated, referenced, alluded to, or left unspoken during this whole campaign. For some reason she just wants people to vote.]
[He is, he just didn't expect it to happen quite this way :P]
[That is the fun thing about calling for violence against something. It tends to invite violence against oneself.]
[I mean... He is.]
[They firebombed themselves in a desperate attempt to win some votes.]
[I would put this down as least likely.]
[Because it makes a lot of sense to firebomb a Trump campaign office in an overwhelmingly democratic district when the margin of victory is irrelevant? Until the investigation is concluded and the asshole who did this prosecuted, I wouldn't make assumptions either way in light of this election cycle.]
[yeah no kidding. This very well could have been some alt-right nutcase trying to rile up the alt-right base.]
[Really? You can't be serious]
[You guys are obsessed with false flags.]
[Someone wasted their money.]
[I don't even know what this is supposed to mean. How does this in any way relate to Trump calling for violence?]
[I've seen that used as an excuse all over this thread for why this firebombing is ok. The new doctrine of the extreme Left seems to be "anything you can do we can do better"]
[Where? Please show me where, because I scrolled down way below the front page of comments and didn't see one person saying that this was an ok thing to do. Everyone was calling it a deplorable act in one way or another.]
[In his head.]
[He literally called for violence on video in plain english.]
[He is. Doesn't excuse him and doesn't excuse this.]
[Link to me one example.]
[If you need that you havent been paying attention. Do some research before you vote its our duty as citizens to be informed voters.]
[Typical social justice warrior with spoon-fed, filtered media coming in to share her opinion. Provide reputable proof or you are just another sheep in the herd of idiocracy.]
[Just don't look at wiki leaks because that's illegal.]
[So you admit you can't find it. That means it doesn't exist. Lol.]
[Lol.]
[Any websites to avoid?]
[Do you have a single example?]
[If only you had followed his campaign you would know of all the examples.]
[If only a single example existed you could instantly provide the link.]
[But I would have to go open a browser and collate all the examples when you could just go find them yourself.]
[The burden of proof is on the person making the accusation, not the other way around. You're just dancing around the problem because you can't find any examples.]
[End of discussion. Well said.]
[Yep this proves it, Trump is a saint who has never asked supporters to assassinate his political opponent. Fuck you Trump supporters are stupid.]
[Oh cute. I just want to remind you, because you seem out of touch with reality, that despite your obsession with our great country, your opinions and your voice mean exactly squat. I realize your country is a very uneventful place that sits in the shadows on the global stage, but please, for the love of God don't forgot that your opinions are worth less than nothing here.]
[Does "second amendment people" ring any bells at all? Jesus fucking christ.]
[That isn't calling for violence]
[Bullshit.]
[There's literally not an example]
[I meant, were there any websites for me to avoid when providing what I considered examples? For example, if I respond with a CNN article and you consider CNN biased, everyone's time is wasted.]
[Link me to ONE SINGLE VIDEO where Trump calls for violence.]
[http://www.nytimes.com/video/us/100000004269364/trump-and-violence.html http://mashable.com/2016/03/12/trump-rally-incite-violence/#QL5Hw_ef3iq7]
[That's completely biased horseshit. Encouraging law and order, and security does not = encouraging violence. That's like saying supporting your local police office is supporting violence ya dumb fuck.]
[You're obviously a reasonable person.]
[However you wanna rationalize it.]
[Typical trumpster. You take after your father. here's evidence* "That's biased bullshit! It doesn't count!*]
[> ONE SINGLE VIDEO > WHAAAAAAAAT BULLSHIT BLAH BLAH BLAH Saw that coming.]
[lol he tried to warn you this would be a waste of time.]
[The violence he has "called for" involve removing people from his rallies and against ISIS. The violence Hillary has called for is against ISIS and possibly Russia her comments were unclear about game plan there. It's silly to think either is calling for violence against the opposing party. Not supporting Trump. But just calling bullshit where bullshit calling is due.]
[Calling for the killing of innocent family members of terrorists certainly sounds like calling for violence and war crimes.]
[Unlike our drone strikes that never kill innocents.]
[I feel you'll find an actual large amount of democratic voters hate how we've used our drones. I know I'm ashamed of it]
[While incredibly reckless, they certainly aren't being targeted. I don't agree with the use of drones either, but Obama didn't call for them to be killed. Clinton didn't call for them to be killed. Trump did call for them to be killed.]
[If I accidentally killed an innocent man, it would be called manslaughter.]
[Yes, while if you intentionally did it, it would be murder, a more serious crime with heavier penalties.]
[While that IS true (Not a US citizen but very concerned about this.), it doesn't hold any relevance here. The drone strikes are a problem and the US government tries to make it look like they wouldn't cause an unacceptable amount of deaths and injuries of innocents. But a) there is a big difference in causing unjustified violence but claiming it doesn't exist and calling for unjustified violence by simply dismissing the fact that it's not justified. Not saying either is better or worse but there is a difference. b) To my information, neither Clinton nor Trump campaigned with "reforming drone strikes to reduce civilian casualties". If anything Trump did the opposite by basically stating he'll bomb away ISIS (which kinda reads like 'fuck civilian casualties' to anyone with a basic idea of how terrorist guerilla warfare works. Point being, none of the candidates made any important points about 'fixing' drone strikes (unfortunately) so no point made there. c) most importantly: two wrongs don't make a right. The fact that a president of one party uses unjustified violence does not mean that it is wrong to call a candidate of another party out on "calling for violence" if he does. DUSCLAIMER: With the amount of contradictiory bullshit that is usually said in any election (and this one in particular) I may have missed some statements with relevance to my arguments. If that's the case, I'm happy to be corrected.]
[He retracted the statement. I'm not supporting either of those candidates, Simply playing devils advocate stating policy supported by both candidates and actually done by one that kills innocents because the conversation was negative against Trump about a retracted/"corrected" statement he made. Not saying it makes stuff he does is okay, just slinging the same mud back over the fence stating that the other candidate has actually caused innocent people to lose their lives. It's a circlejerk argument to say Trump is more violent than Clinton when both want war and one wants another one with Russia (possibly, she wants to oppose their actions in Syria by removing the leader they are helping... regime change! Yay American politics). So the relevance is the conversation was about who creates more violence. There have been many more riots and protests gone wrong on the dem side... including ones held outside of Trump rallies (real smart) so I just don't understand the circlejerk. Edit: and Gary Johnson has made it a campaign point to fix the drone strikes and failed foreign policy that both parties agree on.]
[CNN told viewers to avoid wikileaks because it's illegal. You are only to get your news from CNN.]
[That's kind of irrelevant]
[He should avoid wikileaks.org because it's illegal according to CNN.]
[I think you don't understand what he's saying]
[Please avoid going to Wikileaks as it is illegal. I heard you should go to CNN for information about the leaks.]
[Holy shit, did Trump give you his secret list of debate strategies?]
[No, but he gave me his tax returns.]
[Time magazine: http://ti.me/2ea7MEK (mobile link)]
[Again, that's not Trump encouraging violence. That's Trump encouraging security guards to throw out hooligans and troublemakers at his rallies. Encouraging law, order and security is not encouraging violence. Nice try at false equivalence though...]
[This was the wrong post and I apologize for that. If your reading comprehension was slightly working, you would see it's about the NC firebombing. There was a guy somewhere asking if this bombing had been covered by "libruuuuul m3dia" and this was supposed to be the answer.]
[> There was a guy somewhere asking if this bombing had been covered by "libruuuuul m3dia" and this was supposed to be the answer. Nice hyperbole strawman c-c-c-c-combo!]

[That was in reference to people throwing tomatoes at Trump. Defense, not violence. Asking people to protect you from the crowd and offering to pay their legal fees is not encouraging violence. Nice try at the false equivalence though.]

[Ha okay, I'm done. Have fun November 9th.]
[>the exact same content as the NYTimes link You mean videos of Donald Trump inciting violence.]
[Which one is not Trump encouraging violence? Link to one example.]
[Wat What does violence matter when used justly?]
[[Link to a site with a video mash-up of Trump promoting violence.](http://mashable.com/2016/03/12/trump-rally-incite-violence/#xjp.2zW.Biq3) But let me guess, that's cherry-picked right? That's "out of context" and probably not enough for you.]
[http://www.mediaite.com/online/trump-tells-crowd-to-knock-the-crap-out-of-protesters-offers-to-pay-legal-fees/]
[Telling someone to defend you and that you will pay their legal fees if people are throwing objects at you is not encouraging violence. It's setting up an ad-hoc security contract with the people around you. Again, nice try with the false equivalence, but fail.]
[You're not supposed to argue with the media, citizen.]
[http://www.weeklystandard.com/protester-would-be-carried-out-on-a-stretcher-in-the-old-days-trump-reminisces/article/2001211 Do you want more? Because I have more. That doesn't excuse what happened in NC, but there has been a lot more violent rhetoric coming from one side than the other this cycle.]
[Again, that's not Trump encouraging violence. That's Trump encouraging security guards to throw out hooligans and troublemakers at his rallies. Encouraging law, order and security is not encouraging violence. Nice try at false equivalence though...]
[> ["So if you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of them, would you?" he asked to cheers and laughter. "Seriously. Okay. Just knock the hell [out of them] — I promise you, I will pay for the legal fees. I promise."](http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/trump-tells-crowd-to-knock-the-hell-out-of-protesters/article/2582102)]
[He didn't just say they should be removed. He said they should be beaten until they couldn't stand, *then* removed.]
[Logic is lost on them. They ask for proof, you give it to them, and then they deny and leave.]
[That's what happens when you had no intent on listening only spewing shit.]
[They know it isn't true. I'm incompetent at Reddit so I don't know how to link shit but Google "disinformation campaign." It works pretty well and that terrifies me]
[Sounds more applicable to what the mainstream media is pulling off in favor of clinton]
[That's not him inciting violence. He was just making a series of sounds using his vocal chords and moving his mouth. If those sounds coincidentally sounded like something violent, like "he would be carried out on a stretcher", then it's just your biased, indoctrinated mind hearing what it wants to hear.]
[That's quality sarcasm right there.]
[[removed]]
[Him saying 'if someone attacks you and you punch back, ill pay your legal fees'. Is not calling for mass violence.]
[The person involved sucker punched a protester that was being escorted out of the building. Read the article. You're putting words into his mouth to make him more defensible. Much like Pence.]
[> The person involved sucker punched a protester that was being escorted out of the building. Wrong, that guy had NO support, and was arrested.]
[Ha! I wish he had no support. So again, if you read the article you would know that Mr. McGraw, the puncher, said that next time he might kill the protester, who he said was not acting like an American. Trump then said that the man who threw the punch might have gotten carried away but that he “obviously loves the country.” He also stated his men were looking into paying his legal fees. So much for "no support", eh?]
[What what? One sucker punch of a protestor makes Trump a bad guy? Here is a video of Trump supporters getting sucker punched, attacked, etc: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t7PnrelFdY You're honestly pathetic.]
[[Cough.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t7PnrelFdY) [Cough.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2qpQjoBKY8) [Cough.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlhICXeFcRo) [Cough.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_PZfUNi9ek) These were all found by putting "Trump violence" into YouTube. Instead of reading out of context articles off of bias why don't you actually watch video and formulate your own opinion. Now tell me, do you actually believe that a few words from Trump incited this violence?]
[Yeah, and obviously Hillary left a note at the scene /s]
[If this was done to Democratic HQ by a few white guys with pickup trucks and a Lynyrd Skynyrd CD in their stereo then the media would talk about it all week, blame Trump, and write non-stop coordinated hit pieces saying that he needs to drop out. They would literally have a conniption and then be both hysterical and foaming at the mouth as soon as they came to and realized just how much they could pile on and beat the crap out of Trump with it. This won't happen which shows you that Trump is right about the biased media who are firmly united against him and have been ever since he showed that he could threaten the establishment on both sides of the aisle and outside of politics as well. [I don't expect the denizens of this sub to accept that but it's alright since I don't expect much from people here.](http://buchanan.org/blog/why-liberal-media-hate-trump-124373)]
[True, but this is Reddit, so you've been downvoted.]
[The difference of course is that Trump has encouraged violence and has been preemptively delegitimizing election results while Hillary has done no such thing. This is a person who called for violence and who supports the rhetoric of his supporters who are calling for torches and pitchforks if they lose the election, standing against the actions of more responsible GOP members such as his running mate and Paul Ryan. Why are you shocked that he may be more scrutinized when political violence happens than Hillary?]
[Hillary hasn't done anything to delegitimise election results? How about the stuffed ballot boxes? How about the dead voting for Hillary? How about ripping up republican votes? How about the corrupt way she beat Bernie? Fucking cuck]
[Ya'know using "cuck" as an insult kind of lost its burn a couple of months ago. Can't ya'll find a new word?]
[> The difference of course is that Trump has encouraged violence So where does Hillary calling Trump supporters a "basket of deplorables" fall on the spectrum of encouraging violence, considering that she's talking directly about these people. And what reciprocal thing has Trump said that is somehow *more* encouraging of violence than calling voters deplorable and irredeemable?]
[[One](http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/03/13/donald-trump-says-he-may-pay-legal-fees-of-accused-attacker/) [Two](http://time.com/4203094/donald-trump-hecklers/) [Three](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/02/23/donald-trump-on-protester-id-like-to-punch-him-in-the-face/) [Four](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/10/us/politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton.html) And really? You're going to call using the words "deplorable" and "irredeemable" a call to violence? The doublethink here is impressive, simultaneously dismissing "second amendment people" as not a threat, while somehow viewing "half my opponent's supporters are deplorable" as a threat, which is being just as sensitive as the SJW's Trumpists always rag on about.]
[As opposed to [this?](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/06/03/ugly-bloody-scenes-in-san-jose-as-protesters-attack-trump-supporters-outside-rally/) and then Chicago, Arizon, etc. etc. etc. And you know what the general response was from Hillary and MSM? Well, Trump supporters probably deserved it.]
[no way the deplorable comment and the second amendment comment are equal bro]
[Which 2nd Amendment comment?? [You mean this one?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJQADp5530c)]
[Since it was a false flag attack by Trump supporters, your comment is irrelevant.]
[Contrary to popular belief, the dudes in Lynyrd Skynyrd weren't racist. They recorded in Muscle Shoals ffs. Not saying they're fans aren't racist but they weren't.]
[So, fuck us because of what you assume our reaction will be? username checks out]
[Thanks, interesting op-ed about the 1972 "silent majority" rallying to defend a candidate being assailed by biased media. Imo, relevant to today's political climate.]
[Silent? Uhhhhhh And the polls would disagree with "majority"]
[If you read the article; 49 states went the 'other way' despite the media and their polls; earning the moniker.]
[I'm gonna put a shit ton of money on a) polling being significantly better now and b) ground game and GOTV mattering a ton - Hillary has it, Trump was relying on the party for his.]
[This just happened. Why not wait and actually watch the news to see what they do or don't talk about.]
[I think you can expect the media to talk about this. This is a big fucking deal. As a strong Hillary supporter, I hope they catch whoever did this and they rot in jail for the rest of their days. If Hillary doesn't come out and strongly condemn this behavior I would drop my support for her.]
[After the anti-Trump riots she blamed his "rhetoric." I'm sure she'll give a half assed "disavowal" but she'll sneak in some BS at the end that it's really Trump's fault for saying mean things.]
[Except she didn't sneak in any BS blaming anyone at the end of her disavowal and condemnation, but that's 100% what Trump would do.]
[[Aaaaaand there it is](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/787782613633208320)]
[Why are you telling everyone who you support? Why do y'all make it seem as if Hillary is to accept the blame for this?]
[I think people generally want to express that even the political opposition thinks this is unforgiveable and (so far beyond) unacceptable. It's not that Hillary is to blame. It's that there is a sentiment across political parties that this is un-fucking-acceptable. That this is un-fucking-american. That this is cowardice of the highest degree. And that whoever did this, and is responsible, should feel the full force of the justice system.]
[She doesn't have to accept the blame, but decency requires her to condemn it, which she did. It's like when Trump danced around disavowing David Duke: nobody is seriously suggesting he's personally courting David Duke, but when it looks like he's supporting Trump, decency required Trump to make a statement.]
[Her tweet condemning it an hour ago is what tipped me off]
[Gunshots were fired into Sanders' Nevada HQ during the Democratic primary, and it went largely ignored. So not necessarily.]
[[deleted]]
[Nah, he's just an asshole.]
[I lean very liberally as my comment history suggests - this is terrorism and should not be acceptable. I may disagree entirely with what many Trump supporters say or think, but that is not an excuse to attack them or try to bring them harm. I hope those responsible are punished.]
[I just want to add to everybody saying this is awful. I'm in favor of Clinton's winning this election, but think violence like this (from either side) is absolutely unacceptable. Oppose whoever you don't like, sure, but don't use violence. It not only doesn't solve anything, but it gives your opponent victim status and fuel for their rhetoric. Just win fair and square.]
[I'm so glad nobody was hurt. They'll get the dirtbags.]
[I seriously can't wait for these election to be over with. At least something good came out of these elections. People finally showed their true colors and this is a perfect example of it.]
[22 days]
[Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent.]
[Thank you, Hardin.]
[When you treat people like animals they act like them. Doesn't mean it's right but it shouldn't come as a surprise either. NC has both a huge racism and a huge antilgbt battle going on right now. We are primed in many ways for riots. The amount of anger against republicans in this state is crazy.]
[Who hates trump more, dems or reps?]
[Welcome to the Troubles, folks. What you can look forward to: * sectarian religious conflict * mobs of gunmen shooting people in the street * car bombs, lots of car bombs * The southern half of Georgia exploding or something idk]
[That's a bit alarmist wouldn't you say?]
[Honestly I'd say it's not alarmist enough]
[>**Alarmist** >*Noun* >-Someone who is considered to be exaggerating a danger and so causing needless worry or panic. >*Adjective* >-creating needless worry or panic. Any amount of alarmist is bad.]
[Apply now before the rush. http://www.cic.gc.ca/English/]
[As a democrat I think this is unconscionable.]
[You guys are disgusting]
[who?]
[I'd be surprised if this wasn't done by Republicans to fuel the fire]
[All right, which one of you did this?]
[Alt right, which one of you did this. FTFY]
[Edgy, bro.]
[I wonder if they're doing any victim-blaming in the /r/politics thread? ........ *yup!*]
[We don't know who did it, but it seems clear that no sane person would think this would help Clinton and hurt Trump, nor does Clinton speak in any way that would encourage such actions, so I'm leaning toward this being right wing extremists trying to garner support, but since we don't know who did it, there's no way to say for sure what their motivations might be.]
[So, just to clarify, the fact that "no sane person" would do this means it absolutely couldn't be a Clinton supporter? Because if one supports Clinton it's a prerequisite that they must be entirely sane?]
[No. It could be either. We simply don't know.]
[r/anarchism It was far left anarchists.]
[This thread is hilarious.]
[Hilariously sad]
[Most comments: >"[This is bad] **BUT** [they asked for it] / [Trump provoked it] / [It's an act of defense] / [expect more to come if Trump isn't stopped] / [the firebomber's affiliation doesn't matter] / [definite false flag op].]
[here's a slightly different one for you - "no platform for fascists" if it looks like a fascist, and talks like a fascist, then you probably shouldn't let it rise to power.]
[Don't talk about Clinton like that.]
[oh believe me, i'm not with the democrats or the republicans. I'm not a liberal, i'm not a conservative. I'm not left wing or right wing. In an ideal world the current power structure would be ripped apart and the proletariat would rise up to sieze control of the means of production, and the state itself would be abolished.]
[I'm just making a joke about how Trump isn't the only one running that could fit the definition of fascist if we're being objective. Id rather the power reside is the people, but realize that the people can make some dumb desicisons. After all we elect these people.]
[you don't have to elect them. You had a revolution once, and the foundation of your country was built on the idea that the people should be armed and ready to throw away the government again if it no longer serves the interest of the common people. Overthrowing the two party system is always an option, if you're open to the idea that violence CAN be an option in extreme circumstances.]
[Yeah downvote me why not, ignore the facts just like you dumbies always do shove your mind into made up fantasies, here's the top 5 (most voted) comments on this thread though. > 1 - There shouldnt be any tolerance for this sort of thing, no matter who was the victim. > 2 - Whoever did it should be found, prosecuted and held fully responsible. End of story. Republican, Democrat, left, right doesn't matter. There's no place for that in this country. > 3 - God dammit this election is fucking stupid. If this turns out to be leftists then fuck those guys. If it turns out to be right-wingers, then fuck those guys. > 4 - I am a dem and I upvoted, but not because I like this. No, I upvoted so that it was visible to the most people possible. Having differing beliefs in how our country should be run is fine and in fact, it is encouraged, but this sort of violence is inexcusable. >5- Well that's fucked up. Where are the buts and the "trump provoked it". Yeah random outlier comments that no one is liking don't count.]
[Except that's not true at all. But sure. Most top comments are about how this is unacceptable regardless of whoever did it.]
[You talk of "top" comments but the comment you replied to said "most comments". Those are two different things. I challenge you to test your own theory. Read through a few hunded comments and add up how many include sentiments that condemn the bombing and how many use the words: false flag, Reichstag, and/or blame Trump in some way. Also if you are going by popularity then you should have also checked the gilded comments. The most gilded comment claims Trump supporters did this as a false flag. You are the one picking and choosing the facts to support your point of view.]
[I thought it only took one person to gild a comment, right? And top comments are the ones upvoted due to popularity?]
[Yes, but it was gilded three times and it indicates that someone was willing to spend money to support that sentiment so there is a perceived importance placed on those comments. Hopefully the large amounts of comments that are unnecessarily accusatory or callous will be downvoted to oblivion and/or users will delete them. But you seem to deny how many separate comments on this thread there are that blame and accuse Trump/his supporters which is pointless because people can see them! They are reading them as I type this.]
[All those people defending the Trump Protesters who turned to violence, this is where that kind of stupidity goes]
[But there was random graffiti about "get out of town Nazis" scrawled on the building. Clearly Hillary Clinton did this. Seriously though, this is one of the most inept and pathetic false flags I've ever seen. Democrats have no reason to be this angry- we're winning. There's no angry rhetoric feeding the base. If some crazy Democrat was this pissed off at Trump, they'd arrack a Trump campaign HQ. Instead, the attack is on the GOP, which has abandoned Trump? No way.]
[Ahhh so this is just a big lie by the evil republicans... I didn't know that. Fuck those evil republicans, I should have known that the democrats didn't have any evil supporters. My bad Fuck the GOP...we need to get rid of those evil bastards and their lies....Lets go fuck their shit up, I fucking hate evil]
[Whatever helps you sleep at night. Now that I know nobody was hurt, I'm glad your team did this. It proves our point. See you in November.]
[Do you spend much time on Reddit? I'm not even a Trump supporter and I've been called a Nazi, a racist and much worse by liberals online. How is it such a stretch to think that extremism could seep into the real world? Or are conservatives the only ones capable of evil in your worldview?]
[Smells like the Antifa nutjobs that are in Europe. Anyone that disagrees with their far left view of government and society is labeled a fascist. Then they use violence against the "fascist". Which in an irony i don't think they can see, makes them the fascist.]
[The US has Antifa too. Just not a lot and I think mostly on the West Coast.]
[Those people are cosplaying as Antifa. They don't have the spine to resort to the violence that real Antfia in europe does. They know that in the USA, they could be shot by their victims or the police.]
[I support AntiFacists and direct action! I'm all for peaceful protests, but sometimes you gotta fight fire with fire.]
[The response from both candidates says it all. Trump blamed Hillary and her supporters. Hillary said she is glad everyone is ok. Only a moron would do this. Hillary is up in polls and her base has not shown much aggressiveness to lead to this. Hopefuly this is solved quickly.]
[This whole thing is a fabrication. I bet the Trump Camp firebomed their own HQ to make the Clinton camp look bad. People are telling me this, very important people. Those Tump people would do anything, they're all criminals. /s In seriousness the muslims who did this... Dammit ok, honestly, whoever did this should be found, tried and brought to justice. Incitement of terror and the resulting violence shouldn't be tolerated here. I don't care who it is, or if they agree with me politically. But let's do it properly.]
[Hilary Clinton has already condemned this attack. Trump did not condemn his supporters that wanted to bomb Somalian immigrants]
[Shut your whiny ass up and keep to the topic. Pretty sure one of the attacks you referenced *actually happened*.]
[When a militia successfully plans an attack on democrats will you have the same response?]
[One was foiled by the FBI]
[This was an actual attack compared to people "wanting" to attack someone]
[Huge difference right? Get real.]
[Yeah it is a big difference that's literally the basis of actions speak louder than words]
[Except when it's against you, right?]
[What]
[It's much more serious when an office gets firebombed, but not when you have hundreds of people literally advocating for the same shit just different victims?]
[The people that you say are advocating for violence are almost always trolls with no intention of actually committing the crimes they talk about. This was an actual crime that someone had to plan out and actually executed, so yeah it's more serious than people talking about doing it]
[You have hundreds, maybe thousands, of people *openly advocating violence*, and that's okay. Gotcha.]
[And you're saying that firebombing a building and advocating violence on Reddit are the same Gotcha.]
[*planning]
[Posting something on Reddit doesn't count as planning]
[Yes let's make it political. Get the fuck out of here. Edit: I stand corrected. It was rather narrow minded of me to think an attack on a political party's HQ wasn't political. The comments in response to mine have changed my opinion.I apologize for lashing out.]
[Do you know the name of the sub you are posting in?]
[This is the bombing of the headquarters of a political party. It is inherently political and that can't be removed.]
[BS. This is horrible regardless of implications. Trumps supporters didn't bomb anyone, whoever did this actually made an attack. You're comparing apples and xylophones.]
[No one was hurt, it was a political statement in the form of a crime.]
[So as long as nobody's hurt it counts as a political statement in form of a crime? If a Trump supporter burned down a neighborhood of illegal immigrants' homes while they were all away, would that be ok too? Nobody got hurt, it was just a little political protesting!]
[You're making a straw man argument. First off, saying it's a political statement doesn't undermine the fact that it's a crime. It just describes the nature of the crime. Secondly, way to fail at coming up with a good metaphor. Comparing the homes of many people does not compare to the burning of a small political HQ.]
[To be fair, he's just escalating the protest by escalating the crime. We're just describing the nature of the political statement! Your logic is just as bad as his.]
[No, the difference here is he felt I wasn't condemning it as much because I called it a political statement. His example wasn't meant to expand on this, like you're insinuating it, he felt as if they were similar and I pointed out they weren't. You could apply the same logic, but they're completely different points for different purposes. Just sounded like you wanted to tell someone their logic was bad.]
[One attack was successful and that other was prevented.]
[Yeah, it's horrible regardless, but that doesn't mean it isn't political.]
[It's a thread on a political subreddit about an attack on a political hq. Yeah, the topic's gonna get political.]
[It is political.]
[> Donald J. Trump @realDonaldTrump 17m17 minutes ago Animals representing Hillary Clinton and Dems in North Carolina just firebombed our office in Orange County because we are winning @NCGOP Trump is already blatantly making it poltical]
[> Yes let's make it political. in /r/politics?]
[Pretty standard liberal logic. Let's equate an attack that happened right now, with an attack that never happened. Because those events are equal right?]
[>standard liberal logic Go away, clown. It's all shit, regardless of if it happened or not.]
[Nothing but property was harmed in either case, and the story of a major foiled terrorist plot (blowing up an apartment complex) ought to revive more attention than successful vandalism.]
[Fuck.off.you.wank.stain.]
[I await the investigation. Reichstag.]
[So the left paints trump as Hitler. People firebomb a campaign office. This is why you don't go to extremes. It just calls for more extremes.]
[It would help if the candidate their painting didn't actually act like....Hitler in the making.]
[If you truly believe Trump is Hitler in the making, shouldn't you support this firebombing? Shouldn't any actions to stop such an inevitable genocide be taken, even if those actions are violent?]
[I don't see how supporting the firebombing stops Trump in anyway.]
[Because, if Trump is truly Hitler, then we are morally obligated to engage in all-out war against him, lest he take over the country and perpetuate his genocide, no? If we firebomb enough RNC headquarters, Trump supporters feel so unsafe that they won't go out to vote on election day - notice the "or else" appended to the graffiti. If that happens, Clinton wins in a landslide and Hitler is forever defeated. The way I see it, if you think Trump is literally Hitler, you are morally obligated to call for violence against him, in order to prevent the inevitable future violence you believe he's going to perpetrate.]
[No. You're making a ton of incredibly stupid assumptions. There are better ways of opposing him. We don't need to resort to violence. That would only make things much worse.]
[But what if firebombing the headquarters galvanizes his supporters and creates sympathy with enough undecided voters and that it wins him the election?]
[Then you kill them at the voting booths. If you believe that Trump is Hitler, and his supporters are Nazis, their lives are inherently worth less than yours. You have a moral obligation to kill as many of them as you can, before they elect a guy who you believe is certainly going to kill every Mexican and Muslim in America.]
[But what if killing them at the voting booths actually becomes the thing that gets Trump into power and allows him to suspend the constitution?]
[Nope, because we are at the point where we can vote him out of politics. This was a bad move primarily because it violently undermines democracy. But it's also an incredibly ineffective way of stopping Trump and his supporters.]
[Claiming Trump is just like Hitler just shows how incredibly ignorant of history people are, it's sad.]
[Or maybe you're the one ignorant of history. As a history major who has written countless papers about the rise of the third Reich and the techniques Hitler did, while Trumps actions are obviously less extreme at this point they are following the same vein. All dictators/fascists/autocrats follow a similar pattern. Which is to find a minority to put the worlds problems on. They also arise in similar situations, interestingly enough. Times of extreme violence and high economic issues. It's hard to rise as a dictator in a perfect world, you need bad guys in order for people to give up their power for you to claim. Trump has many of the telltale signs of a dictator most notably his immigration task force seems strickling similar to the German SS/gestapo. The other sign is a cult like fanaticism which his supporters have in spades. So maybe you need to take a little time to read up in the great tradgeties of the world I have a couple links I could send you they are great reads. Edit: I didn't mean for that to come off rude.]
[You assume a lot about me, then attempt to bludgeon me with some pathetic appeal to authority. You don't know a thing about me or how well read I am on the subject of populist politicians and the economic environments they arise in. It's incredibly intellectually dishonest to play the Hitler card when there are plenty of other populist politicians who are more directly comparable to Trump.]
[Every candidate has their cult like supporters so that isn't anything special or concerning - Bernie definitely has cult like followers and he blames all their problems on the top 1%. And controlling immigration/borders is just a natural function of any sovereign country. Japan must be super hitler in your eyes]
[Hitler wasn't a draft dodger.]
[It's not "painting" when the guy wants to shut down media, wants a "strong" leadership, is xenophobic, sexist, and the whole package.]
[So do you support this attack? If Trump is literally the next Hitler, isn't it all of our moral imperative to stop him by any means necessary, including violence?]
[> If Trump is literally the next Hitler, isn't it all of our moral imperative to stop him by any means necessary, including violence? YES, but this is a very ineffective method that will help rather than hurt him.]
[>So do you support this attack? The best strawmans folks, the best ! >If Trump is literally the next Hitler, isn't it all of our moral imperative to stop him by any means necessary, including violence? Second strawman. There is a different between having borderline to straight up fascist traits and be able to implement them. Also, this time vote, according to scientific polls, shall be enough. People still have education on this. Last but not least, we don't know yet who commited this attack and why. Could be people from the left, could be a false flag, we don't know. Don't draw conclusions like Trump did, before facts are actually known. Generally speaking, I have a hard time believing anti-fascist people (or so would they call themselves) would paint a Svastika in any circumstance. But they might as well be stupid anyway, considering the attack. Let's wait for the conclusion on this, on which I'm sure one side is going to claim it's rigged if the "wrong" results comes out of it.]
[You dont know what a strawman is do you?]
[I think they made an excellent point, and they weren't strawman arguments. If Trump was in fact _the next Hitler_ as many people have been saying, then why wouldn't someone bomb him out of existence?]
[>"strong" leadership Holy shit! That IS pretty bad!]
[Trump's rhetoric hasn't helped the situation either though. Violence is unacceptable regardless of what party you belong to.]
[Russians probably.]
[This fucking sucks. People who do this kind of shit think they are sending some kind of message, but they don't even know what they are trying to say.]
[90% upvoted..... r/politics isn't as revolting as I thought Bravo]
[They're only covering it because Hillary condemned it in a tweet so paid users can attempt to spin it to defend her/ spin the story.]
[Read the comments if you wanna lose that faith quick. "I understand the sentiment" behind 'Nazi Republicans leave town', "this is definitely a false flag because no liberal would ever do something like this," and the like everywhere]
[Upvoting is not approval of the act.]
[The result of the media (and this board)demonizing another party as fascists and Hitler. Then pull immediately back denouncing the inevitable acts of violence. Throw fuel on the pyre and denounce the fire.]
[umm no.]
[My first reaction was simply "Shit." I feel ashamed.]
[Why? Is it something you did?]
[I wasn't concerned about the people who could have potentially been hurt. I was only concerned about what this means in reference towards the political race.]
[No, I meant why feel ashamed for whatever other people do?]
[I felt ashamed that I didn't care about the potential people who were injured]
[Oh, now I understand, thanks for patience.]
[This is absolutely unspeakable and I'm glad no one was hurt. It is also unspeakable that a candidate would lay blame on the "other side" without any proof. Super cute that he called Dems animals when he just spent all of last debate crying about how Clinton called half his supporters deplorable, too. Just when I think we can't get any lower...]
[I'm trying to think of who would want to do this sort of damage and my thoughts are 1) far-right republican who's upset at the GOP for halfheartedly supporting Trump recently or 2) far-left dem fed up with their opps opponent]
[Well since the graffiti said "Nazi republicans get out" I'm guessing it wasn't a far right Nazi type]
[[Nothing like this has ever happened before](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichstag_fire)]
[Are you insinuating something? I hope not, we all know only the hare-brained, deplorable Drumpfsters are susceptible to wild conspiracy theories. Right....right?]
[When people keep comparing their political enemies to Hitler, they will feel justified taking actions like this.]
[I did a little research on this Hitler guy.. turns out he was not nice at all.]
[You ever notice how politicians go 0-Hitler? It's never like someone who is in between like, say a Saddam Hussein. You are earlier a good guy/gal or literally Hitler.]
[It is easier to get voters to fear your enemy than it is to explain why they should trust you.]
[Among all the reactions to this horrific attack, only one person chose to politicize the event. Guess who!]
[You?]
[I'm surprised Reddit isn't screaming false flag.]
[Scroll down to see the morons posting it.]
[There's plenty of them. They should stop speculating. It adds an unnecessary ugly conspiracy flavor to this, where people should focus on denouncing violence of any type instead]
[Easy. I didn't scroll far enough down I guess. I'm not saying false flag, I'm just making fun of how much Reddit loves conspiracy theories. Of course this is terrorism and shouldn't be perpetrated by anyone.]
[I totally agree. It just makes reddit look stupid. Whether reddit is stupid or not, hard to tell, but it makes reddit _look_ stupid]
[This attack is very disgusting, and I'm almost as disgusted at Trump for immediately blaming Clinton supporters for this, as if she herself condones such a thing. It is one thing to criticize your opponent on political issues, it is another to accuse them of inciting violence with zero evidence to back it up. We're better than this.]
[Except that there have been *dozens* of documented cases of Clinton or Sanders supporters violently attacking Trump supporters, all the while shouting RACIST! and nothing of the sort from the Trump crowd.]
[Nothing of the sort eh? This is exactly the sort of dementia/selective recall I'd expect from a Trump supporter. Trump encourages violence at his rally and people at his rallies have punched/choked out others at his gatherings. Trump has suggested to his supporters to assassinate Clinton. What do you mean the Trump crowd isn't violent? Most of them are the crazy sort of right wing militant nuts who love Jesus, their country (they think), guns, and hate other races.]
[Why do you assume this is the work of Democrats or some "false-flag"? Trump said a few days ago that (presumably "establishment") Republicans are worse than "Crooked Hillary." The news media is full of reports of Republicans abandoning Trump right now.]
[The entire trump crowed harasses and threatens the media daily. News papers are getting death threats for their endorsements, your dear leader issues vaguely veiled threats of assassination and this instance somehow negates everything your base stands for?]
[> The entire trump crowed harasses and threatens the media daily. The following is a description of said "harassment." >"But even reporters long accustomed to the toxic fervor of Trump rallies were startled — and even frightened — at the vitriol of a Cincinnati crowd on Thursday evening as more than 15,000 supporters flashed homemade signs, flipped middle fingers and lashed out in tirades often laced with profanity as journalists made their way to a crammed, fenced-in island in the center of the floor." Chanting "Tell the Truth" at a reporter and flipping him off does not constitute harassment, unless you're the kind of person that needs a safe space. http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/15/us/politics/trump-media-attacks.html]
[Conveniently left out source where journalists themselves have said they were being harassed and I noticed you didn't even touch the newspaper threats.]
[How did I leave that out? It's a freaking New York Times article where I directly quoted the reporter as he describes his experience.]
[We are, but he's not.]
[Hmm. So Hillary, the NAACP, Democratic Party nationwide and the NC Dems condemns the bombing, as does Trump, NC GOP, and GOP at-large. I think Trump's comments are predictably inflammatory. What did they (NC GOP) expect with a candidate who is a racist and a bigot? That simple. They don't have to back Trump, they could just not campaign for him. Anyway, it could be a false flag, but at the same time, I'm not sure Trump is that devious. He is just a celeb with a lot of cash and is discriminatory to the max. As a sidenote, I don't support Clinton, but she wouldn't tell a supporter to bomb a headquarters. This really just sounds like an individual act (or a small group) of someone who is rightfully angry at Trump, and used destructive means to carry out their goals. It could be an anti-fascist action as well, but I'm not sure.]
[You are victim blaming victims of a terrorist attack. Justifying actual fascist tactics by claiming the victim is a fascist.]
[The victim IS a facist. The GOP is now officially a hate group thanks to Trump. Enjoy!! :)]
[I always get a kick out of stupid people who believe the political spectrum is graphed as anything but a horseshoe. If not a ring.]
[To the morons in this thread that think this was done by "liberals", the HQ was bombed by anarchists. Far left wing anarchists. They are certainly not liberals, as they want to abolish both the state and capitalism.]
[ATF is investigating. I don't see any mention of suspects. Where did you see it was anarchists.]
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/57tr16/police_say_a_republican_building_in_north/ I see no reason why the far right would attack the Republicans as fascists. Trump is supported by white supremacists. The evidence points to far left anarchists who historically support violence against their enemies, they also refer to conservatives as 'fascists'.]
[I'm just saying all we've heard is that ATF is investigating. There is no evidence about who did it, only conjecture.]
[lol exactly. Liberals, basically by definition, wouldn't do this.]
[This election has made me so cynical and jaded the first thing I thought of was the Reichstag fire.]
[that's kinda fucked up.]
[Let's just pretend that Trump supporters burned down a DNC building. The DNC plan to get Hillary elected was "get them to hate Trump as much as possible". Nice little country you've created.]
[What's disgusting is that Trump and his band of merry men will use this now to demonize and attack anyone on the left, and it'll be used by the deplorables to justify the next time one of them attacks or harms a political opponent. Mark my words.]
[It's the Nazi method.]
[**I don't condone violence from any side.** But these fucking Trump supporters acting like this kind of thing isn't talked about in the opposite fashion in your wretched hive of filth is beyond hypocritical. You people literally advocate for racial violence **DAILY**. And someone fire bombs one of your parties' political offices and it might as well be 9/11 all over again. Get fucking real.]
[I do not agree with that characterization. No Trump Supporter I know is thinking that at all. I see only Trump signs and votes.]
[Go look at r/the_donald. Literally people advocating for armed retribution and more racial violence.]
[those are commentators on an internet board. i cant imagine more than a small fraction of a percent of them would be willing to do that in real life.]
[All it takes is one.]
[the one is a wackjob they'd probably do it regardless of posting shit on /r/The_Donald]
[Did any Trump supports burn down any Democrat headquarters?]
[No but they almost bombed a bunch of mosques. I don't condone this shit from **ANYONE**. But DO NOT act like Trump supporters on reddit haven't largely advocated for everything from genocide to mass deportation of Muslims, blacks, and hispanics.]
[Your hopeless!]
[My rule of ignoring anything before "but" in a statement is proven once again: >These fucking Trump supporters acting like this kind of thing isn't talked about in the opposite fashion in your wretched hive of filth is beyond hypocritical. >You people literally advocate for racial violence DAILY. >And someone fire bombs one of your parties' political offices and it might as well be 9/11 all over again. >Get fucking real. Perfect.]

[Look at the bottom post man]
[Wanting to mass murder them certainly is. Way to ignore the post.]
[You OK, bud?]
[>b-b-but muh hate narrative]
[What? Seriously, what are you talking about?]
[You're the one parrying the discussion with a strawman, you tell me.]
[Asking "are you OK" is building a strawman now? I think I got my answer. Unplug for a little while and decompress. Take care man, seriously.]
[>thinly veiled u mad Lmao, okay little guy.]
[Whatever man. Enjoy your life, peace.]
[...Are you ok, Buddy?]
[I think person was saying that in their lockerrooms, the conservatives probably entertain ideas like what was perpetrated, only with the victim likely being liberals. They shouldn't be surprised someone carried this out, and it was likely an inside job.]
[You have literally zero evidence to back up your hunch beyond personal biases and buzzwords you string together.]
[What's ironic here is that you sound exactly the way Trump sounds. I can see Trump standing on the podium mouthing those same words. Think about that for a second. You're the one being a hypocrite here by spewing the same type of rhetoric you hate in Trump supporters. Take your own advice and and "Get Fucking Real"]
[So you're saying talking about violence is as bad as committing it?]
[It's all unacceptable bullshit. Please stop acting like it's cool to preach that bullshit rather than commit it.]
[Anyone else think the GOP firebombed themselves?]
[Only those predisposed to a similar bias.]
[Firebombing the Republican headquarters is deplorable. Trump's response is just as deplorable. > Animals representing Hillary Clinton and Dems in North Carolina just firebombed our office in Orange County because we are winning @NCGOP https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/787782613633208320]
[I completely agree. Way to pour gas on the fire Don (every pun intended). Let's take a shit situation, then dehumanize the opposition! That'll end well!]
[That is so stupid. Secretary Clinton immediately went on Twitter and condemned the attacks. Trump just says he's winning.]
[Trump is preaching that the election is a war for survival to his supporters. In a recent rally he literally said that America as we know it would cease to exist if Hillary Clinton is elected, and that we would be made vulnerable to being taken over by ISIS. Now the first thing he says is that the Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party are represented by domestic terrorists. Keep in mind Trumps position on fighting terrorism, "you have to go after their families."]
[Hey, just like the Central Park Five, he knows whose guilty! Amazing how smart he is.]
[Just like the Orlando shooter! Or the fuck who ran down those people in Nice!]

[A virtual Reichstag taking place on Twitter and the comment sections of right wing blogs. They're gonna press this fire very hard this week. You can almost hear all the bleating...]
[This is disgusting. You can't even be a human being for five fucking minutes to condemn an act of political terrorism, you've just gotta start stroking yourself off to the thought of all the "right wing bleating" you'll get to see. Deplorable.]
[https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/787782613633208320?lang=en You were saying?]
[rekt]
[This is really disturbing. As much as I see Trump as the lightning rod for terrorism like the recent event in Kansas with his supporters planning a domestic attack, there is no excuse for Any violence. When the GOP goes low, stay up folks. Don't become that which you seek to destroy. Destroy them at the ballot box; not literally. That is the way of animals. Not the way of women and men.]
[Is anyone actually surprised? "Trump is Hitler" has been the dominant narrative for months now.]
[i think trump enjoys it. his supporters do.]
[They absolutely do. They gain power and prop up their victim complex when the Left unabashedly demonizes them.]
["anti-racism is code for white genocide" they all sing in unison, as they hide in their bunkers from the left.]
[But hey, lets keep up that rhetoric that ALL republicans are sexist racist ultra hitlers that want to kill all mexicans and stop the flow of burritos over the board]
[This attack is horrific & the perpetrators, *whatever their motivation*, should be **positively identified**, arrested, charged, tried & if found guilty punished to the full extent of the law. Nothing justifies this. Nothing. But Trump's reckless **without any definitive proof** tweeted response blaming Democrats is unprecedented in its scale & scope of demagoguery & potentially inciting more violence for a major party presidential nominee. Separate from the very critical importance of catching the perpetrator(s) is this tweet's demonstration that Trump is dangerously unfit to be POTUS. (https://mobile.twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/787782613633208320) Edit: link to Trump tweet wasn't showing up at least on mobile]
[So, wait, one of Trump's campaign offices gets firebombed with the message "get out republican nazis or else" and you've found a way to attack Trump? Impressive, kudos.]
[Did you read Trump's tweet linked in my initial comment? The horrific nature of the event doesn't excuse in any way or merit ignoring Trump's thoroughly inappropriate and by any definition reckless & demagogic response--supremely inappropriate for a presidential nominee without a shred of supporting evidence, much less before anyone had even been identified as a suspect. Please feel free to defend or justify in any way Trump's response. Clinton's response for comparison is linked here. (https://mobile.twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/787763497308418052) Edit: as with Trump tweet not showing up on mobile so moved up.]
[Trump's campaign office? According to Trump, the RNC is against him as much as the democrats are]
[Not really the conspiracy type, but it feels very odd any Democrat/Hillary supporter would resort to this when it's the other side that's been preaching violence for the past couple of weeks. Also what's the point when anybody paying attention can see the Republican party has been imploding? I suspect this is a ploy aimed at galvanizing conservatives to vote but also push back against the suppose attackers to their democracy (Hillary/Democrat backers).]
[In fairness, it didn't have to be a Democrat that did it, just someone who takes issue with the GOP. Could be lots of folks. (It's wrong no matter who did it. But we do not KNOW who did it. )]
[Patience. Let those charged with investigation do their work. Go high despite how low Trump just went by accusing folk with no evidence. But don't do that same stupid thing of accusing folk wtih no evidence. Do you honestly believe that there would be nobody who after listening to all this preaching of violence who might just want to respod with violence? Best we can do in the short-term is to condemn the attack and plead with folk to remain calm.]
[Hilary supporters have been involved in vandalism before. I think trying to cast doubt on either side or conversely trying to blame either side without any evidence is purely political positioning.]
[Even if that were true, which I am not conceding, but even if it were, what's the point of sabotaging a campaign that is already losing? All this is going to do is to take the focus off Gropegate, Taxes, Trump Foundation, the RICO trial, etc. and maybe even create some sympathy for DJT. There is zero political advantage in doing something like this.]
[[Nothing to concede](http://boston.cbslocal.com/2016/08/06/donald-trump-sign-vandalism-andover-susan-bryant/) My point is that we just don't know. Just because there isn't a political advantage to doing something, doesn't mean it's not possible for a Clinton supporter to be involved.]
[I agree. My point was that it is even more puzzling because there is no obvious political motive. If Trump were winning, there would at least be a political motive.]
[Why do you assume this is the work of Democrats or some "false-flag"? Trump said a few days ago that (presumably "establishment") Republicans are worse than "Crooked Hillary." The news media is full of reports of Republicans abandoning Trump right now.]
[I don't thank that at all. Why are you assuming my assumptions? My point was that no one should be jumping to conclusions and that it could've been either side.]
[Exactly. Trump jumped the gun first and laid out the blame. I'm just following suit. We all can have our opinions (whether they're fully corroborated or not), but at least my words won't trigger millions of people.]
[It triggered me though!! Trigger!! Trigger!! I need a safe space quickly!!!!]
[I'm glad Donald Trumps response was characteristically rational, informed, non partisan, and compassionate! (WTF!)]
[Wanna bet it's gonna be a a Trumpian republican?.]
[> "A swastika and “Nazi Republicans get out of town or else” were spray painted on the side of an adjacent building." I'm calling it now, this will turn out to be Trump supporters. I listen to a *lot* of conservative talk radio and "Nazi Republicans" is exactly what someone trying to imitate the motives of an 'America-hating leftist' would come up with.]
[Possibly because there are large chunks of the left actually saying that.]
[But the right can call Obama a socialist communist Muslim terrorist from kenya for how long? Then some candidate comes along who wants to deport 11 million people overnight, talks constantly of the enemies both within and without, needing a bigger police and military system, scapegoats a religious minority, calls for the jailing of his political opponents and outright challenges the very legitimacy of the whole process while claiming the he and he alone can save the nation and restore it to former greatness, and people have the *nerve* to compare him to the nazis..]
[Get out of town or else sounds like Republican phraseology. That's what kind of stuck out to me. Or else what? We will come at you with our guns we don't own?]
[Violent displays sounds .... Liberal.]
[I'm just gonna say it: Trump did this. He's behind it. I'll betcha a dollar to a doughnut.]
[What is about doughnuts you speak of? I'll firebomb some repubnicans for some doughnuts! ]
[I love that the price for these guys is so low!]
[wouldn't put anything past the orange one]
[Here's a crazy sub for you, you will fit in perfectly: /r/conspiracy]
[I'm not one for conspiracies, but I don't put anything past The Donald. Thanks all the same for the recommendation!]
[I agree, but he is also a corrupt property developer who gets the best people, including arsonists. If he wanted to burn this bitch down, it would have burned down to the ground. This is far too amateurish to be DJT.]
[Ah, but if he'd burned it down, it couldn't get back up and running again in time for the election. Now, all they've gotta do is a little Mr. Clean, tape up the broken window to make sure everyone knows they're down but not out, get some new signs, and bang: open for business. The sympathy will be overwhelming. Not really. But, fuck man, sometimes you've gotta laugh.]
[Of course he already knows who is responsible. https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/787782613633208320 &nbsp; >Animals representing Hillary Clinton and Dems in North Carolina just firebombed our office in Orange County because we are winning @NCGOP]
[Did you not see the spray painted wall?]
[I'll wait for something official on who did it]
[Any moron can vote for whoever they want. That doesn't mean they REPRESENT the campaign.]
[Gut reaction: Republicans did it in a last ditch desperation attempt to regain momentum by re-instilling fear into the base. Their playbook has revolved around fear since 9/11 (and earlier), and they've proven incapable evolving their strategy since Dear Leader Reagan. Plus, firebombing? That graffiti? Not typical tactics from the Whole Foods demo. Also, why now? The GOP is getting its teeth kicked in, my understanding is that the anti-Trump crowd is content to watch the dumpster fire from a safe distance. Could be wrong, and would have no problem admitting as such, that's just where my mind went first, likely a biproduct of the shit diet we've all been fed from all sides over the last two years. It's either that, or the left is shifting from smug college safe-spacers to pussy wannabe anarchists - out of boredom I imagine.]
[> Plus, firebombing? That graffiti? Not typical tactics from the Whole Foods demo. I dunno. It's just the type of thing that groups like the ELF would do. They are pretty far left. Then again, I wouldn't be surprised if it was a Reichstag style false flag. Trump seems to be following Hitler's play book in a lot of ways. I'd put the chances at 65% far left radicals Vs. 35% far right conspirators. I don't have a dog in this fight though. So I'm just watching the fireworks and storing fresh water.]
[>I'd put the chances at 65% far left radicals Vs. 35% far right conspirators. Yes. >I don't have a dog in this fight though. So I'm just watching the fireworks and storing fresh water. **YES.**]
["Molotovs don't melt yard signs!"]
[I wouldn't be surprised at all if this was a bunch of trunp supporters who did this. Turmp's campaign has no sympathy from anyone, and rightfully so! This is a tactical move from the trump camp to gain some sympathy before the debate so that trump can continue to demonize the left like he's been attempting to do the last few months, even going so far as saying the elections are rigged against him. This is 100% orchestrated by an affiliate of the turnip's campaign. Edit: a word]
[I'll say it, I absolutely would *not* be surprised if this was a false flag attack by desperate Trump supporters trying to force an October surprise and swing the narrative. Let's not kid ourselves about the possibility, the timing and circumstances are extremely suspect. Everything about it is so HACK and blatantly benefits his side, it looks exactly like how a Trumper would frame liberals. At this point, with Trump mimicking fascists and strongmen so thoroughly, nothing surprises me. And this kind of thing just so exceedingly rare and stupid, it would make no sense coming from the surefire favorites to win the election. I will of course await any investigation's findings, this is PURE speculation that I'm sure Donald supporters will pretend to be outraged at and clutch their pearls, but as far as I'm concerned it's COMPLETELY open to speculation at this point, and we shouldn't consider this an unspeakable possibility. With any other candidate it would be, but not this one.]
[You sound like a crazy conspiracy theorist.]
[And here is the predictable gaslight that would come next. I imagine the_donald tickling their nipples while saying this, like the Comcast workers in South Park. I'm not saying anything of consequence, and not making a formal accusation. To me the possibilities are at LEAST 50/50, but everyone knows who would most benefit from this news item at the beginning of the week.]
[> I'm not saying anything of consequence,]
[Since you posted this same thing in a different comment chain I'll respond the same way: http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/2016/06/02/trump-san-jose-rally-protesters/32639803/]
[So? You want to get in link wars of fights breaking out?]
["fights" lol This is "fights breaking out" to you??? What a convenient way for you to downplay Trump rallygoers being physically assaulted and mugged.]
[It doesn't matter if it was a false flag attack, which it is not. It's domestic terrorism, full stop. Like those guys that tried to bomb the Somali immigrants, it doesn't matter what their political motivations were. They're terrorists. "False flag" is paranoia that shifts focus away from the act itself.]
[I was told conspiracy theories were only limited to the deplorable Trumpinistas.]
[$100 says it was republicans that did this to frame dems and continue on with their "were being persecuted" narrative.]
[Hate to say it but watch the polls slide down from 11+ back to 5-6+ as a result. Dirty play. Hope the police find out who did it but if it were people from within that just makes it much harder.]
[Next you'll be telling me Hillary is terminally ill and ignored pleas for help in Benghazi.]
[Easy money.]
[I thought this was going to be a boring election year.]
[It will be interesting to see who is responsible for this. I hope they are caught quickly and justice is served.]
[Have to admit, didn't think this article would make it to the front page of r/politics. Kudos.]
[I have to agree. What a sad commentary on the atmosphere around here.]
[I've said it before, but r/politics as a "default" sub needs to be more balanced. The opinion of Reddit(and this country) definitely doesn't reflect the 99% pro Hillary narrative that this sub shows.]
[If I'm not mistaken, /r/politics isn't actually a default sub anymore.]
[That's why I parenthesized it. It is and isn't]
[Trumps tweet about it will definitely help the situation]
[Holy crap that is terrible. Regardless of your political affiliation this violence is unacceptable. I'm glad no one was harmed from this attack.]
[How could this be construed as an attack on Trump when Trump's own supporters say that the Republican party is as much an enemy as the democratic party?]
[because of the "nazi republicans get out or else" graffiti that was also there. Trump's people *like* the nazi republicans.]
[Spray painted on the side of the building "*** Republicans leave town".]
[We are not a democracy so it can't be an attack on democracy.]
[This isn't okay on any level. If I was in NC, I'd be inclined to drag my liberal butt over there and help clean up.]
[First a pair of trump supporters stand outside a Democratic HQ, fully armed, and now this happens? Is this what we do now? Intimidate those who disagree with us, Insight violence, and Bicker like foolish children? We waste our time and energy over shit like this, while an entire US city can't get access to something as basic as clean drinking water, while our prisons are over crowded and exploited for cheap labor, and while our roads, bridges, and other infrastructure are crumbling before our eyes! And who do we have to choose from for president? A belligerent Oompa Loompa and Grandma Nixon. We should be ashamed of ourselves. This is ridiculous and unacceptable!]
[A whole lotta duh ITT. No one was waiting for any of you to renounce this, it's a given that you find it abhorrent. We all know it's unacceptable.]
[If they didn't call it out, Donald supporters would use that as 'evidence' of leftists inciting terrorism]
[Reminds me of that time somebody shot out the windows of one of Bernie's campaign offices. Y'know, except for the part where the news actually covers it.]
[so this is not ok but shutting down the opposing side's rallies is?]
[The comments today seem... Very authentic? Is there no official reaction yet?]
[I think someone may be resenting the fact that N.C. has been hijacked by the GOP at gerrymandering-point.]
[lol this is the most circlejerky thread I've ever read]
[Welcome to politics]
[Okay can we all agree that we need to move up election day? I am so fucking done with this scary, tense atmosphere that has been amping up over these past months.]
[I wonder which candidate's campaign is constantly compared to the rise of Hitler. Fucking sickening.]
[Has Clinton's campaign actually been doing that? Also which side spent a decade calling Obama a socialist communist nazi muslim?]
[Please don't let the culprit be black....]
[Why?]
[Or a muslim. Or Mexican. Or a woman. Or gay. Or Hillary Clinton.]
[Or George soros]
[Attractive young white woman would be kind of perfect...]
[Just goes to show that there are crazies and dangerous people on both sides.]
[Do we know that?]
[Well...yes. Even if this doesn't end up being people on the left, I think we can safely say dangerous people do exist on that side too. However, even if we don't know for sure who did this, I'm not so sure how likely it would be that it was the TRUMP supporters that are calling the GOP "Nazis".]
[I mean if a trump support did the attack, would they not want to make it look like it wasn't a trump supporter?]
[talofa lava]
[hakuna mattata.]
[kefe]
[this just feel like the work of Trump supporters angry at the GOP as per Trump's latest triade.]
[Well we ought to wait and find out.]
[Smells like a false flag event...]
[This is terrible. What the fuck is wrong with people]
[> What the fuck is wrong with people Moral righteousness + regular chanting of "I'm on the right side of history". Remember: Any horrific thing you do is okay if it's *The Good Guys™* doing it to *The Bad Guys™.*" >"Did Allied soldiers stop and say "No, we must stop shooting nazis. Murder is an absolute wrong" when liberating concentration camps? NO. Sometimes to stop absolute evil, you have to get your hands a little dirty." - *He said, as he [curbstomped a woman holding a Trump sign.](http://imgur.com/gallery/44jJY)*]
[It doesn't matter who did it. They should be found and arrested. However it would be ironic if it was Trump supporter angry with the establishment lol]
[It absolutely matters who did it and why]
["Wouldn't that be so funny lol I love when the other side gets firebombed lol Can you imagine those dumb fucking Trumpets reaction to their own kind bombing them? Please god let it be a republican lol"]
[TIL there's an Orange Country in NC.]
[People doing ignorant shit like this is going to hand the election over to Trump. RIP America, we knew thee well.]
[I may have missed it, but did Trump condemn the radical Christian terrorists arrested this week?]
[Nope. He is uncharacteristically silent on his terrorist supporters.]
[Trump just posted this on Twitter: Animals representing Hillary Clinton and Dems in North Carolina just firebombed our office in Orange County because we are winning @NCGOP]
[and there he goes stoking the flames. we are going to see more.]
[Honestly this seems fishy! Reminds me of when the white woman said Obama supporters beat her up and drew his initials in her face. Only to find out she did it to herself. Just saying guys, this election cycle is so far from normal, it wouldn't surprise me.]
[And r/the_Donald is blaming democrats. Surprising.]
[What if this wasn't the work of a Democrat, but a bad actor who is trying to frame or place blame on them? I think it's called a Manchurian, but I could be wrong. </conspiracy>]
[> bad actor Reagan passed away in 2004.]
[The inevitable conclusion is an America in which politics is nothing but a race between the two parties to commit worse and worse crimes against themselves as they blame it on their opponents. (remember, if you're willing to charge your opponent with faking this kind of thing, that you should admit that violence against your own side is just as likely to have been self-harm too)]
[This is horrible. It small part of me wonder if they themselves did this in order to support their narrative. To be honest it wouldn't surprise especially with the arrest of those 3 white males just yesterday.]
[Does anyone else feel like the facts just aren't adding up? Like, whoever did this clearly deserves to pay but the statement that was spray painted seems like something Michael Scott would write. Guess we'll see...]
[Yeah, something is really fishy. I bet it turns out to be insurance fraud or some shit.]
[Like I could understand fire bombing an office in a swing county but the political motivation to attack here really doesn't carry much weight.]
[You mean Michael Scarn?]
[Wow and the deplorables are the bad ones?]
[every group has deplorables, its just the GOP has way more]
[They're the ones who actually did it.]
[Not sure why this is in /r/politics, to me it seems that an act like this couldn't be further from politics.]
[Part of me believes this some sort of false-flag play by the GOP, but that would make me as tinfoil-hatted as someone claiming the entire election is rigged.]
[This is an attack on democracy? this? well yes, but there is a far worst attack on democracy, a looming cloud of hate an neo-terrorism brought to the eyes of the world from the hibernating caves that is Americas past, this entity is called Donald Trump. He sounds more and more like a wanna be dicatator everyday, and to see so many people cheer for this maniac, brings chills to my spine. Is this really who we are? Was all the so called social progress from the past two decades a lie? Even if he doesnt win. this wont go away, a more quaint candidate will replace him next election, and try to avoid all the mistakes he made all whilst pandering to the same crowd Trump did. Donald trump has open a really old scar, and revealed that America is not the beacon of hope and process that we so much like to claim.]
[If anything, this highlights the basic difference between Trump and Clinton- she condemned it and behaved like an adult. He took it as an opportunity to be a gigantic asshole.]
[This is what happens when you insist that all Republicans are racist, homophobic, xenophobes. People take the hyperbole at face value and start treating Republicans like subhuman pieces of trash that need to be eliminated. We're at a point in this country where people can get beat up or killed for wearing a Trump hat in the wrong part of town. I love talking politics just as much as the next guy, but this behavior is not okay. Once you put your hands on people for disagreeing with you, you become an intolerant hateful asshole. PS: The scariest thing about this attack is how many people will think it's justified since the target was a Republican HQ. I'm already seeing people on twitter saying shit like "they deserved it". Fucking animals.]
[Which candidate has complained the most about its leadership as of late?]
[This isn't about leadership or complaining. This is about smearing people for their political beliefs. Clinton attacks people for being conservative. She called half of Trump's supporters a "basket of deplorables". It's divisive rhetoric. Trump never did this. Trump focuses all his attacks on Clinton personally, he never smeared her followers by calling them names.]
[Hmm, just today he called Clinton supporters animals. How far back do you want to go with this.]
["animals representing Hillary Clinton" He was attacking Hillary. Nice try though.]
[I see...pandas started the fire...these pandas were* employed by Hillary.]
[I had a feelings this would happen sooner or later, people are so polarized you can't say you support Trump between groups.]
[Wow, Trump didn't waste any time blaming this on the dems. This easily could have been done by his supporters. He's done all he can to alienate them from the rest of the party.]
[This is the new face of regressive liberalism.]
[While I'll concede it's possible, even likely, that liberals are responsible for this, there's currently no actual evidence to support this theory. It's irresponsible and divisive to make this kind of claim.]
[We don't know what happened yet, but if I had to put money on it, that's what I would wager. The hatred I've seen mounting has been pretty incredible.]
[Can't wait for when Trumpers inevitably bomb a mosque or gun down some minorities for you to say "let's wait for all the facts". People like you are fucking ridiculous. Election Day is going to have widespread murders squarely because of that orange fuck and his claims of rigging.]
[To be fair, Hilary campaign has already been caught election rigging.]
[Liberals? Do words not mean anything anymore? Maybe anarchists? or other people on the far left, but liberals? Not so much.]
["liberalism" lol]
[It's liberalism in name only at this point. They used to stand for free market and free speech. Now the regressives are anti-freedom.]
[Or are they just into trying to protect freedom of those who have been historically deprived of it? But what I mean is that if this is coming from he left it's probably from anarchists, not 'liberals']
[They're calling themselves liberals]
[Who it?]
[We don't know who did this.]
["Nazi republicans get out of town or else" I'd be honestly surprised.]
[Probably wouldn't be the first time.]
[Twitter responses Clinton >The attack on the Orange County HQ @NCGOP office is horrific and unacceptable. Very grateful that everyone is safe. Trump >Animals representing Hillary Clinton and Dems in North Carolina just firebombed our office in Orange County because we are winning @NCGOP]
[That pretty much sums up this race]
[this is great - cnn]
[I have $50 on it was one of their own people looking to drum up a story. The "get out of town" mentality doesn't jive with the standard tolerance and teaching mentality of modern Democrats.]
[well, I'm a gambler and I would take that bet. I'm not political expert but I would put it at greater than even money odds imo, as in "inside job" would be the favorite not the dog.]
[There is a difference in responses to this tragedy. The Democrats and moderate conservatives are unilaterally condemning this act of terrorism, and making a clear statement that violence is not an acceptable recourse to political disputes in America. Meanwhile, Trump is declaring that Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party are responsible for this attack, doubling down on his position that President Hillary Clinton would "destroy America as we know it" and make America vulnerable being taken over by ISIS. Violence is not acceptable, period. Anyone who would resort to such extremes does not represent America or its values. The political establishment recognizes that politics is not a war for survival. Trump needs to learn that even the most extreme political activists who hate their political opposition recognize that the democratic process is sacrosanct. Republican or Democrat, conservative or liberal, right or left, if you are an American then the only acceptable response to terrorism is to close ranks and make it clear that this is unacceptable.]
[This.]
[[This](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/787782613633208320) could be the worst thing Trump has said yet. He is openly, publicly, and directly blaming his opponent for a terrorist attack. This is absolutely going to spur a violent retaliation from Trump supporters at some level. This is not a joke anymore; Donald Trump is a threat to our republic.]
[Grow a pair you paranoid freak]
[It doesn't matter who it really was that did this horrific act: left, right, up, down, top, bottom, charmed, or strange. But, my gut feeling (I have no proof of this, just the first thing that popped in my head) that a Donald Trump supporter did this as a false flag scheme to hurt HRC. No proof, just a gut feeling.]
[It just seems weird, Hillary is so far ahead right now why start violence like that? Not saying false flag but it just seems really odd.]
[It's not as if a person capable of firebombing an office is using great logic when they make that decision.]
[Remember people the NC Republican organization has pulled their support from Trump and have said that he should quit the race. This could be pissed off Trump supporters.]
[It seems really odd to me that this happened right after campaign staff were moved from Virginia to North Carolina. The staff had been supposedly working around the clock but yet not that night. The graffiti was made on a neighboring business (to make sure it didn't get destroyed presumably) and the paint doesn't at all look rushed. Campaign funds are tight, and they're losing in the polls. I'm not omnipotent enough to say what happened, but it definitely seems like a Trump subordinate would have a much more likely motivation to stage an attack. Only one campaign is calling for "pitchforks." Plus, this happened in the most liberal county in the state. That seems like a pretty low-risk target, doesn't it?]
[Could be a Trump supporter, could be a green party, could be Democrat. Doesn't matter, shitty thing to do.]
[Could be the ghost of Harambe with his dick out..]
[I bet this is somehow nasty old Donald's fault. That orange hitler could do nothing right.]
[Trump had to answer for David Duke. Does Hillary have to answer for this?]
[How do you know who is responsible? Could just as easily be Trump trying to stop the discussion about Gropegage.]
[Don't even know who did it yet, cork your eagle.]
[She already condemned it on Twitter. don't worry, she usually acts like a responsible adult]
[We don't know who did this.]
[But you acknowledge if it was anti-Trump motivated that she bears some culpability.]
[She's condemned it over Twitter while Donald, without any facts or supporting evidence blamed it on Hillary Clinton.]
[This is not how you handle someone you dont like about anyone ever.]
[can we stop calling it a firebomb. They used a molotov, not napalm.]
[The most important point.]
[Not advocating this behavior, but why are armed men on federal lands considered 'militants' but a firebombing is instantly 'political terrorism?']
[Well shit, I guess both sides have their shades of deplorables. As heated as the election has been, there is no room for this type of behavior. I wonder how the candidates responded... It would seem that Clinton [wished](https://twitter.com/NCGOP/status/787765546909569024) well for the local GOP. And they have replied with a thanks. How nice to see some civility across the spectrum. ..... And it would seem that our wonderful Donald has already [discovered](https://twitter.com/realDonaldDrumpf/status/787782613633208320) the perpetrators and solved the case. /s ... And he also did so [Before](https://twitter.com/realDonaldDrumpf/status/787783828358258688) offering condolences and well-wishes. Tl;dr: Tweets and candidates aside, I hope that they catch whoever was behind this. We all have a right to our own beliefs, but to viciously attack others because of them is not acceptable. Edit: Spell correction]
[Speculation: Perhaps the Russians did it to feed the Trump supporters' anger.]
[I would like to point out that if the perpetrators are from the far left (which seems likely), these groups are often not fans of the Democrats or Hillary Clinton, who they consider a 'neoconservative' or a 'moderate republican'.]
[Likely hell. Could have been anyone.]
[Do you spray paint a nazi symbol on something when you are against the nazis? Thought you only did that if you were a nzi]
[was wondering this as well.... would have been also funny (and came to mind) if something like [a scene in 'Leaves of Grass' where vandals draw the Swastikas backwards.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mb-3XGFTpLQ)]
[The actual Nazis labelled people and buildings with the Star of David to identify Jews.]
[Checked the thread to see if there was a plethora of posts from the tolerant left calling this a false flag. Was not dissapointed.]
[Just as many if not more also telling them to fuck off and people calling for peace.]
[I don't buy it. Let's see if they apprehend who did it and who they actually support. This doesn't sound right to me. The whole "or else" thing...who writes that? The threat is implicit in the action of firebombing the place. In fact, who writes anything? The place was firebombed...no need to spell it out unless you're doing it to yourself and you want to make sure everyone thinks it's those evil Hillary supporters violently oppressing you and calling you all Nazis.]
[Who cares who the offenders support? These people are terrorists, and neither the left nor the right would condone this under any circumstances.]
[Not trying to pick sides, because this was a deplorable act by all means. But considering the way this election cycle has been going, would it be that surprising if we found out that they fire bombed their own HQ to make the other side look bad?]
[Regardless of intent, the perpetrators are nothing more than terrorists, and they do not represent whatever movement they think they're helping.]
[seems like an inside job, if you ask me. they were awfully quick to blame their political opponents without any facts to back it up. fishy... is what i'm saying.]
[Spoiler: Trump supporters did it to facilitate Trump's new posture as victim.]
[Most relevant user name of 2016.]
[I guess I'm voting republican now. The democrats are terrorists and cannot be trusted to run this country.]
[Any proof it was a Democrat and not a false flag trump supporter]
[Because Republicans aren't? Both sides do shit. PP shootings and bombings, gays being killed, both done by conservative Christians. Both sides have plenty of rational people, and both sides have people who are fucked up. Not to mention Clinton has already condemned this. This is just a other reason I hate when this shit happens. Both sides start whipping out their dicks to show who is the better group.]
[The democrats aren't terrorists. It's merely a coincidence that the vast majority of terrorist attacks in the US are committed by registered democrats.]
[Does that make Republicans pedophiles since most child molesting is done by Republicans]
[I think both sides of the aisle have disgusting members. There were right-wing terrorists earlier this week planning an attack on Muslim immigrants. I encourage you to vote for each politician based on policies and their own individual character, not based on the extremist members of each party - unless those extremists are the mainstream of the party]
[I believe that was sarcasm on his part.]
[Dupe.]
[Oh, I know. I just wanted to let him know that I wasn't fooled by his idiocy]
[Dude, according to your comment history you're clearly already a Trump supporter.]
[So very tempting to dismiss this as a "false flag" operation, given how quick certain deplorable folks are to do the same when there's a mass shooting or a terrorist attack. Trump supporter Alex Jones in particular LOVES to cry "false flag." But seriously, whoever did it, for whatever reason they did, needs to be found and tried and locked away.]
[If this happened to one of Hillarys offices you can guarantee that the comments would be blaming nobody but Donald J Trump himself for doing the firebombing. Pathetic. And immediately downvoted for facts! thats how they keep new accounts to only post once every 10 minutes. Edit: /u/Darth_Banal speculation does equal facts when its the other way around!]
[What's so amusing is how fucking stupid people are, they are completely ignoring that this was done by far left anarchists.]
[Probably people like the organization BAMN. They are pretty fucking crazy https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAMN]
[When has Clinton incited violence towards the other side?]
[When you paint your opponents as all being literally Nazis, should anyone be surprised when some unstable wacko takes it upon himself to rid his community of Nazis?]
[Well in this case, some of them literally are (neo) Nazis, and the "alt-right" is heavily involved in this campaign, the same money behind the white nationalist Independence Party in the UK. It's not pretty, and it's a broad brush, but there is a kernel of truth there.]
[The only thing I could find that could be interpreted as Clinton calling trump a nazi was her retweeting someone who said that his campaign made a nazi reference, not her calling him a nazi. Keep in mind, Trump made a pretty transparent call to assassinate her and literally referred to her as the devil.]
[Dem HQ gets bombed: Obvious attack by Trump supporters. Here come the terrorists lulz Repub HQ gets bombed: Obvious attack by Trump supporters. Here come the terrorists lulz.]
[That's not what is said at all here.]
[Ironically though, it's probably not wrong. The most likely suspect is hardly -Hillary- supporters. I'll be voting for her, but there isn't much passion there. Trump needs every ounce of sympathy he can get right now, however. It's just so badly done, either way.]
[I've so far read at least a dozen comments in this thread saying this is a false flag. Not to mention the other reply to your comment.]
[Trump's rhetoric would be to blame for inciting violence.]
[Is Clinton's rhetoric to blame here?]
[YES and the media.]
[Speculation =/= facts]
[Is this a false flag? [maybe, there was an event in 2008 where a Republican activist claimed she was attacked by Democrats.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashley_Todd_mugging_hoax) Is it possible to have been Liberal extremists? [maybe, Orange County, North Carolina is a majority Democratic county and not friendly territory for Trump](http://www.politico.com/2012-election/results/president/north-carolina/). Best to wait for the police to investigate before any partisan judgments are made, other than this being a unacceptable act.]
[There hasn't been a false flag in 30 years]
[> There hasn't been a false flag in 30 years You might want to check the first link, Ashley Todd's false report of being mugged by Obama supporters 8 years ago would constitute a "false flag".]
[A false flag takes more than one person. Your example is "a crazy bitch"]
[You know how much gun nuts love false flags.]
[i'm assuming you apply this same skepticism with rape victims?]
[Just out of curiosity, were you skeptical about all those women who have pointed the finger at Trump? I don't know how much you know about the legal system, but you need proof beyond a reasonable doubt for a conviction. It seems to me that a prudent person would indeed wait for the investigation to conclude before making assumptions. Then again, maybe you're a fan of lynch mobs. I don't know.]
[Wtf lol politically motivated acts can't be equated with malicious or personal acts. Get real, slick.]
[If the victim has a documented history of false reports, yes.]
[oh, that office has been bombed before as a false flag? you should probably get CNN on the horn then]
[Goalpost adjusted.]
[Nope they got rekt actually. Please explain how this adjusts the goalposts.]
[This isn't a game, there are no goalposts. Just you treated a terrorist attack on the Republican party with less credulity than you would treat a rape victim and the only way you can deal with the cognitive dissonance is by uttering any fallacy you know. This is because you are biased. Now that you understand the hypocrisy you need to resolve it and better yourself for **you** rather than spin your wheels arguing with me. That's how we become better people.]
[Whoa look at the flaming strawman.]
[Strawmen don't do well around firebombs. At least that's what I remember from the Wizard of Oz.]
[listen and believe]
[rape victims identify their attacker explicitly Has anyone explicitly identified who this was, and then others denied that it was them?]
[> a Republican activist claimed she was attacked by Democrats. Hpw things [have changed](http://imgur.com/gallery/44jJY)...]
[Yea but all of those weren't *real* democrats, though. /s]
[Heh, The "Backwards B" girl came to mind when I saw this.]
[Well, Orange County has Chapel Hill, which I can see being Dems, but this was in Hillsborough, which is more rural and I tend to see more Trump/Repub signs and banners driving around. But this place was certainly targeted - it's in the middle of a small town, tucked away in a strip mall type area.]
[How do you see it as targeted? The sentiment would seem to be for the Republicans to leave a town that is a rather Republican friendly location.]
[Let's see if this gets real traction as opposed to more stories about alleged sexual assaults]
[Only one of those was committed by an actual candidate and it wasn't this.]
[I'm actually sick and tired of hearing about Bill's 20+ year old allegations of improprieties. Trump's shit is decades old as well with just as little evidence (none what so ever)]
[Uhh well one of those two is on tape admitting to sexual assault.]
[> Trump's shit is decades old as well with just as little evidence (none what so ever) Except him admitting on video that he did it, you mean.]
[You're right, what we really need is him on video saying he "did not have sexual relations with those women" - then he's totally electable.]
[Wait... is Bill Clinton running for office?]
[She's already explained his role in his administration, don't be obtuse.]
[Then all we need to do is put it on Napster before every song and we can Wait, this isn't the late 90s]
[We're taking heavy damage, Captain! Deflection shields to maximum!]
[Except for the ones from 2007, 2010, and 2013. Those are not decades old.]
[> Trump's shit is decades old as well with just as little evidence (none what so ever) I'm glad you're here to sort it out. We would have actually had to waste time in a court room over this. /s]
[Unless one of the victims pulled a Monica and didn't wash or dry clean a splooge stained dress then what evidence would there be? Oh that's right none.]
[The difference is Bill's accusers got their day in court (and the media) 20 years ago. They were heard out. Trump's transgressions have not yet been investigated and they are significantly more in number. More importantly, Bill's not the one running for president. And hanging Bill's sins around the neck of Hillary is rather despicable.]
[Well, I don't necessarily hang his sins around her neck, but I *do* hang her sins related to his around her neck. For instance, when recently she said that "all women who come forward with rape accusations should be believed," despite the fact that she was one of the loudest voices against the women who accused her husband of rape. Seems a bit like a double-standard to me.]
[So she said something hypocritical once, and he sexually assaulted people and was hypocritical regarding "believing accusers" (Bill's vs. his own). Pretty easy choice there.]
[Bill's transgressions really slowed him down in '92 didn't it.]
[Times have changed. Also - when they were investigated and heard out, their claims were lacking, to say the least. I would think Donald's accusers should at least get the same chance to be heard and seek justice as Bill's did back in '92. The real problem for Donald is that the claims against him are much more credible, especially since he was found bragging about very similar actions on multiple occasions.]
["They were lacking" Were they? Bill sticking a cigar in his intern's pussy while POTUS doesn't cast enough doubt for you? I doubt a 70 year old Trump would be banging interns in the Oval Office if elected.]
[The right wing might be obsessed with kink but the rest of us don't give a fuck as long as it's CONSENSUAL. Sorry Rush, this is the world you live in now.]
[Is it really consensual when The President of the United States, the most powerful person on the planet is the aggressor? And the woman is his intern?]
[She was an adult. So - yes. Especially since years later she still says it was consensual. Do I think it's appropriate - no. Is it sexual assault - no. Are you practicing false equivalency - absolutely. More importantly - is Bill running for president - NO. 1992 was a long time ago. I never voted for Bill, and neither did most of the people in this sub. But I'll be voting for Hillary in November with a clear conscience.]
[Umm Reichstag anyone?!?]
[yeah, no kidding....this is bad.]
[Oh goodie. And just think, we've got another three weeks to go before the election!]
[Wonder what Alex Jones take on it is?]
[Molotovs don't melt yard signs!]
[I think he'll be bringing out the diapers]
[I'm sorry, did it say firebombed? Now that is extreme.]
[Imagine if Bernie one the nomination and this happened to a democratic building. I'd like to see the comments then.]
[It is surreal to see my hometown of Hillsborough on Reddits front page. It's sad that it's under these circumstances. We live in a strange place where the college pockets are extremely liberal and the town's without schools are extremely conservative, so needless to say tensions are high.]
[Damn I thought it was OC, CA.]
[It wasn't any political party as they have a hard enough time finding volunteers. So probably a deranged person on the left ("carried away") or on the right (to evoke sympathy). Either way, the Feds will be involved and hopefully find the perp, lock em up. Also municipalities will now spend on overtime for police to guard these places until Nov 8, and the donors will have donations channeled for building cameras, window bars, fencing, etc.. instead of ads. Dimwit arsonists]

[That it happened in Orange County is funny, I don't care who you are...]
[too soon man, too soon]
[The word nazi is often used to describe over-controlling people. Like people say nazi-mods or grammer-nazi. It doesnt literally mean WW2 nazi. I'm sure everyone here knows this but is acting dumb for some reason unknown to me.]
[So we've got terrorist plots/attacks on both sides of the political aisle this week. Way to go, American system, for ratcheting up the tension until things started to break.]
[This could get interesting when they find who ever did it.]
[What exactly does "firebombed" mean? Molotov cocktail?]
[Yes]
[ELI5 what a "firebomb" is?]
[In this case, a deliberate arson usually perpetrated using a [Molotov Cocktail.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molotov_cocktail)]
[Shiiiiiiiiieeet! We might not even have to wait for Election Day for violence to break out.]
[And boom goes the dynamite]
[Title should specify which Orange County.]
[Waaaah! Something exists outside of California!!!! WAAAAH~! What a waste of my precious Californian time!]
[There is also an orange country Florida. People that live in an Orange County may be interested. I actually live in Alaska but grew up in SOCAL so I initially thought this was close to home. Idiot.]
[I am sad now :(]
[We'll take 'else'.]
[As someone who is very liberal from Orange county, I am shocked and appalled that this happened so close to home. I rarely see my homestate make the news but when it does it always seems to be ridiculously bad news.]
[Fellow NC resident here. I agree that this was an awful thing to do. We should respect our Democracy if we're going to keep believing in it. Still, you rarely see our home state make the news? Dude or Dudette, HB2, Voting Rights, Charlotte... We've had a bunch of bad news for a while now. But it's only 2.5 months until we have a new Governor and we can start to peel this B.S.. back.]
[Notice how there aren't any false flag accusations? Really shows you the demographics of those kinds of people.]
[Well there are, but it's definitely not the winning voice by any means. At the very least, people are smart enough to just think it, and not need to type it, since if it is, it will come out eventually.]
[That's a shame]
[California? Holy shit]
[NC]
[I've got a premonition that things are gonna get worse before they get better. Gonna hunker down with my funs before everyone goes all North Ireland]
[Absolutely reprehensible and inexcusable. Though the cynic in me has to wonder if it was staged. Either way, I hope they catch the bastards quickly.]
[Lul.]
[I am sure any second now the really richy guy will pay for all damages to this spot.]
[God I hate when this shit happens. Not only because it's fucking horrible, but because it's just causing more divide. So many people in these comments are trying to show that their side is innocent, but the other side is full of terrorists. Fact is, some times people are shit. Doesn't matter if they are left or right.]
[Now, this is obviously horrible and is an inexcusable affront to our democracy, without a doubt... *but maybe* the party supporting a candidate who routinely engages in fascistic, violent rhetoric shouldn't be shocked when a nutcase from the other side takes that candidate's call to arms as a threat? Just a thought. Either way, there's no place for arson in our political process. They'll find the scumbag eventually.]
[well, everyone is talking about victim, etc. But this could be a conspiracy material. Trump supporters did this in order to cloud current topic about Trump and make him as a victim. I bet his position in pollings now is better.]
[Is anyone claiming responsibility?]
[He is a bigoted turd, but ya, generally not a good move to firebomb a place. Prolly an inside job to ramp up sympathy for his next (soon) electoral race.]
[> In a tweet, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump blamed “Animals representing Hillary Clinton and Dems in North Carolina.” Sure. It couldn't have possibly been someone threatened by the highly charged incendiary comments made by good ol' Trump himself to one group or another. Pick one: women, disabled, black people, muslims, latinos, veterans, the list goes on and on. Trump says alot of stupid things, people hear it and get offended. Someone somewhere got so offended that he or she that that a rational response...a big symbolic fuck you to Trump....would be to firebomb the Republican HQ. It's messed up but I could see how it could have happened. Whomever did this needs to be found and prosecuted ASAP because it's not just inflammatory words anymore, they took this to whole new level and people are going to get hurt.]
[Well, it's not exactly the Reichstag fire...]
[Call someone a rising nazi fascist enough and they'll get treated like nazi fascists. After all who among us wouldn't kill hurler with a time machine.]
[Oh. My. God. This is 5 minutes from my house. I can't believe anyone would do this, regardless of who you're voting for.]
[Reichstag fire comes to mind. This appears to be a last ditch effort to gain sympathy for Trump and further radicalize his adherents using an us vs. them narrative. Civil unrest the likes of which not seen since 1865 is coming to a major city near you.]
[False flag attack by Trump supporters.]
[Fuck it, I don't buy it. It sounds too ridiculous all around, like the plot of a Western. I think they did it to themselves. A little bit of grass roots effort to change the topic from Trump's scandals. I'm willing to admit I'm wrong if more evidence comes out. I doubt it was a real sophisticated plot. But on the face of it I just don't see some left wing folks firebombing a GOP office in a swing state.]
[I think the odds of some folks with some beer in them pulling mischief seems high, but with no political motive. This could so very likely be petty vandalism.]
[IDK, this doesn't seem sophisticated enough for a false-flag either. I can't imagine them not taking the opportunity to use words like "deplorables" if it were. The bored-edgy-teenagers theory sounds pretty plausible to me. Hopefully whoever did it will be caught soon.]
[> I just don't see some left wing folks firebombing a GOP office. http://imgur.com/gallery/44jJY www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMux_UHmpvc]
[Different angles of the same people to make it look more widespread than it actually is. Those asshats are out of line, no argument here, but don't try to paint with extra broad brush stokes. Also what does standing on a flag have anything to do with violence? I'm against it, I wore that flag on my uniform for four years, but those people aren't acting violently.]
[You're suggesting Trump's reported "scorched earth" strategy is literal? (Hyperion is a great series!)]
[Playing devil's advocate for a moment: this could be a false flag attack conducted by the party itself, against its opponents.]
[no, it could not]
[Playing devil's advocate again, there's insufficient evidence to make a claim for either as fact.]
[Replying to the buried comment because everyone's being high amd mighty about it. 1) The Democrats are going to win that county, by a lot. What is there to gain? 2) As an act of terror, this is not how you do it. You don't spray paint a nice calling card on the only part not conveniently burned down. 3) take the time to spray paint "Republicans" rather than GOP? Someone knew they had plenty of time to work with. 4) No reports of previous threats. No recent controversies. 5) "Vandals" trash stuff. This looks like someone had the news photos in mind. Doesn't pass the smell test.]
[republicans getting beaten, firebombed etc. but trump is the bad guy tho. thx reddit]
[And shit happens to other people. LGBT people get killed regularly. Then there's the PP shootings. And the violence against Mosques. Both sides have shitty people.]
[Likely the police managed to catch the Trump supporters before they carried out their mosque bombing. And that wasn't going to be be when it was empty in the middle of the night.]
[Trump is a bad guy, and also the people that committed this act are bad guys. One doesn't negate the other. More than one person at a time can be a bad guy, regardless of ideology.]
[See...now this is how you start up that war those other nutters were trying for. Bomb your own shit and blame someone else.]
[Duh. Oh ... oops, we're trying to be all high road about this.]
[It's a shitty thing, for sure, but I'm not exactly feeling sympathetic to the party that lowered the level of discourse and exaggerated the level of fervor and fear. It'll take a lot for me to feel sympathy for the party of the southern strategy and war on terror and war on science and encouraging the worst xenophobia from my fellow Americans.]
[Republicans probably did it to themselves to elicit sympathy votes.]
[Because we all know the left never does fake hate crimes eh?]
[Touche]
[Molotovs don't melt yard signs!]
[Oh now Trump's outraged by politically-inspired violence.]
[I've got a Reichtag vibe going. Anybody else?]
[Keep in mind there's a distinct possibility that _alt-right conservatives_ are behind this in an attempt to rile up their base. Think about it - what's there to gain at this point? Trump has a snowball's chance in hell of becoming president. What would this do other than make his base mad and get people to show up and vote on election day? On the other hand, there's tons of videos on youtube showing Trump supporters being attacked simply for being Trump supporters. Not protesting an event or disrupting a speech or anything like that, just flat out walking down the street with a MAGA hat on and getting nailed.]
[I tend to agree, the old adage who benefits springs to mind. At this point of the Election most of the Democratic base know the Presidency is all but in the bag, unless a monumental scandal or fuck up were to happen to sway a large amount of the Electorate to Trump, they should be calm and confident at this stage regarding the Election, why would they put that in danger with a deplorable act like this when in a very strong winning position, it makes no sense. However we will have to wait until the facts unfold so we get the truth, whoever has done it i hope they get caught and jailed for a very long time.]
[Why would democrats do this when we are clearly winning this election? Probably was just some dumb ass who needs to get locked up.]
[Some people aren't very bright, they get fed a lot of bull about Trump being the next Hitler (which even if you hate him, you have to admit is an incredibly stupid comparison), and they see a local Republican office. Who wouldn't bomb an office of Hitler if they had the chance?]
[Almost like labeling all of your opponents as "deplorable" Nazis, racists and bigots can potentially have drastic consequences when someone mentally unstable latches onto your rhetoric...]
[Well, when the shoe fits...]
[of course she didn't label all of them, she tried to be nuanced and said half. however, you likely realize that the right winged people also falter in nuance when describing the liberal left. It seems that many people on either side don't even try to be moderate, they just straight up want to fan the flames and categorize and label. Also, we can look at trump's rhetoric, and I can imagine that mentally ill or uneducated people have also used his words as inspiration for their violent deeds.]
[Trump is probably pulling out of NC, so it's not like they needed the office. I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if this were a false flag. Isn't it curious that Trump was ready with a witty Twitter response?]
[>Isn't it curious that Trump was ready with a witty Twitter response? Since when has Trump been slow with witty Twitter responses? I wish I could say I was surprised your organization had the audacity to even comment on this event.]
[I wouldn't be surprised if your organization had the audacity to blow up your own headquarters.]
[This is just an election why are the Democrats so angry, Thank god nobody was injured this time? Has Hillary denounced this yet? Where is she?]
[[deleted]]
[That or she could do the responsible thing and denounce this kind of action which is what we should all hope she does.]
[Which she's already done.]
[Did she also agree to tone down her hateful rhetoric? This is on her toxic campaign calling her opponents supporters racist, sexist, islamophobic, xenophobic, irredeemable, deplorable, and other dehumanizing slanders. Most of these people are just regular folks who happen to have different political views, and aren't actually Hitler reincarnate.]
[Couldn't agree with you more.]
[How is pointing out racism, sexism and xenophobia dehumanising?]
[You should cruise over to r /T_D and make a list of all the racist things you find. This week we are seeing a YUGE influx of LGBTQ and evangelicals (who are getting along just fine).]
[I have seen plenty of racist shit over there, but I'm not doing that to myself again. Anyway I'm sure there are plenty of decent people over there too, so don't take this as me saying all Trump supporters are racist or sexist. The idea that LGBTQs will vote for someone who appointed Pence as a running mate is laughable though, the guy supports conversion therapy afterall. Edit: To clarify of course some LGBTQs will vote Trump, I meant to say they won't do so in any significant numbers.]
[> the guy supports conversion therapy afterall. Cringeworthy.]
[Agreed, it's pretty disgusting.]
[Good, I just hadn't read anything about that yet. I was just trying to nip this false flag narrative in the butt to help people realize that we dems have deplorables too.]

[Dude... stop reaching.]
[[Denouncing it](https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/787763497308418052)]
[**BUT E-MAILS AND BENGHAZI!!** /s]
[Yes she has.]
[True, but she hasn't denounced the republicanism that led to this.]
[Which she shouldn't. This isn't about politics we have to outright denounce whoever does these things and not give them a platform. It is deplorable and should be done away with, no reason to try and make it about the opponent.]
[It's sad to think that no matter who wins the other side is almost guaranteed to have violent jackasses flip shit. The right will go nuts with "it was rigged." The left would go nuts with "they said he's Hitler so it's A-OK to beat the fuck out of his supporters!" I can't see a way this election doesn't end in a burst of violence. Trump egging it on and the left making excuses for people being assaulted for wearing a trump hat. The worst part is either way we get a shitty president as the icing on the goddamn cake.]
[Hm I wonder what kind of places they would get this idea of calling Republicans "nazis" from? As well as the other hateful, intolerant rhetoric towards Republicans...]
[>Hm I wonder what kind of places they would get this idea of calling Republicans "nazis" from? I wonder if it was form Donald Trump himself regularly retweeting Neonazi memes and repeating antisemitic alt right talking points.]
[So you're saying you agree with what they wrote? Calling republicans nazis, threatening them, and drawing hate symbols? You're in a way proving my (sarcastic) point.]
[He never said he supported all of that. Simply why people would call them Nazis.]
[Could this be something they did to themselves for publicity, in light of the recent talk of them intimidating voters? >“Whether the bomb was meant to kill, destroy property, or intimidate voters, [everyone in this country should be free to express their political viewpoints without fear for their own safety](http://lawnewz.com/important/these-tweets-prove-trump-is-already-inspiring-supporters-to-use-disturbing-voter-intimidation-tactics/). We will be requesting additional security at all **Republican Party** offices and events between now and Election Day to ensure the safety of our activists, volunteers, and supporters." So, only Republicans are in danger, now? And ATF will be at ...all the polling places? >Woodhouse said: “We will not be deterred by this hate crime." Republicans now believe in hate crimes?

But in this dirty, dirty election year, don't be shocked if this turns out to be republicans doing it for publicity.]
[Something does seem rotten. I pray that they find who did it. Trump tweeted that "they firebombed us because... we're winning"... but Hillary is up in NC... In 2012 that specific area was largely blue (70-20) even when the state was red (Romney took it by +2, Hillary is taking it by around 3-5) NC is a major swing state. Trump was losing it. Losing that specific area too. Seems like desperation to me.]
[Yep, it makes no sense. But locals here have been saying the NC police are corrupt and racist -big shocker there given the state gov't- I don't trust them to investigate fairly. Maybe ATF will turn up something but ..why isn't DHS investigating? I saw no mention of them at all in the articles. Anyway, you can bet the promise to put police and ATF at events -Im, assuming including the *polls*, will serve as their intimidation and this event is what will justify it. You watch.]
[But apparently that area, OC, is one of most liberal? It had their first gay mayor and everything... so I don't know.]
[Well, in the end, they can call themselves whatever they want, liberal, conservative or otherwise, but they're just assholes and not responsible citizens in any party.]
[I wonder if this was trump supporters?]
[how much money do you get paid to post this crap?]
[At first I thought it might be Trump supporters who did it but now I am not so sure. Calling Republicans Nazis is a term used by Liberal Democrats]
[To be fair, that could be why the Republican who would do it would spray paint that. It just helps point towards liberals doing it. With that said, I wouldn't be surprised if either side did it. It makes sense in a way for it to be a false flag, but both sides have crazy people, and there have been all riots and everything, so I'm not gonna be surprised if it was a liberal.]
[i hate to be the conspiracy guy here but this is going to win the republicans a lot of sympathy. attacks like this always give the victims party a good bump... i don't think its out of the relm of possiblity that they did it to themselves.]
[I think everybody has that somewhere in there heads but we don't know until there is an update. It's just as likely its some anarchists from the local area just wanting to fuck shit up.]
[Every R politician coming out and calling this an attack on democracy is surely going to say the same thing when people go out to intimidate voters and worse on election day. Right?]

[> Except the Reichstag fire was actually started by communists and historical revisionist have made it up to be a textbook false flag. Source?]
[The fucking Wikipedia page.]
[Read the fucking page again. It's a matter of historical dispute. It's disputed among historians. Fucking 12 year olds. Where are they teaching you kids to read?]
[Alt right loons hate public schools, so they probably learned to read at paw paw's home learning institute.]
[Lol ok hurr durr evil nazis. And I'm the 12 year old.]
[Holy fucking christ these people are dense. ***REICHSTAG! REICHSTAG! REICHSTAG!*** throughout this goddamned thread without realizing that the goddamned Reichstag was burned down by a goddamned commie. Fucking 12 year olds.]
[So we have a Trump supporter spouting off very dubious Nazi propaganda, which has been heavily disputed by historians? Color me surprised.]
[What, precisely, do you disagree with here? >***According to Ian Kershaw, writing in 1998, the consensus of nearly all historians is that Van der Lubbe did set the Reichstag on fire.***[16] Although Van der Lubbe was certainly an arsonist and clearly played a role, there has been considerable popular and scientific debate over whether he acted alone; the case is still discussed. >Kershaw, in Hitler 1889–1936: Hubris, says it is generally believed today that Van der Lubbe acted alone and that the Reichstag fire was merely a stroke of good luck for the Nazis.[17] It is alleged that the idea he was a "half-wit" or "mentally disturbed" was propaganda spread by the Dutch Communist Party, to distance themselves from an insurrectionist anti-fascist, who was once a member of the party and took action where they failed to do so.[18] Hans Mommsen concluded that the Nazi leadership was in a state of panic on the night of the Reichstag fire and they seemed to regard the fire as confirmation that a Communist revolution was as imminent as they said it was.[19] Or are you, like the people who firebombed this NC campaign office, just blinded by your hatred of people with differing political views?]
[regardless, they need to be caught and thrown away. this is unacceptible. no scapegoats, find the perps and throw them away.]
[I bet every penny I have that this was carried out by some Right Wing nut jobs who think Donald Trump is the second coming of Republican Jesus.]
[Oh geez, I'm a Democrat and Bernie supporter but this is going to make me vote Trump. NOT.]
[Trump supporters starting their revolution against the Republican establishment.]
[That was my first thought too, especially given the recent "nazi media" harassment incident.]
[Could anyone see this as an inside job done by Republicans? Bomb the HQ, blame Democrats, garner more votes for Republicans?]
[Eh, the only thing more disgusting than this firebombing is assuming that it was some inside job. Y'all need to learn about occam's razor. This wild speculation is useless and disgusting.]
[It's possible, but from what I've seen some of the anti-trump supporters out there have proven to be just as crazy as the pro-trump supporters.]
[What do you mean by "Republicans"? If you mean actual members of the Republican Party, that's abhorrently dumb. If you mean fringe right lunatics, that's... possible. It's a pretty liberal place though... We should probably reserve judgement until an investigation is done. There's no sense in trying to guess who did it. We don't have any information.]

[And the ones in Kansas were from the right. What's your point?]
[it happens on both sides, three men were just arrested in Garden City, KS for planning and organizing an "Oklahoma City-style" bombing of an apartment complex that houses Somali refugees. It doesn't matter what side is doing it, all that matters is that it is wrong and it must be denounced.]
[Yep, and a Black Muslim convert threatened simultaneous terrorist attacks in Florida against busses and beaches.]
[Can we stop with this tiring left/right blame game shit? Neither side is perfect.]
[When someone from the right does something: "See? Look at how deplorable those people are!" When someone from the left does something: "Can we stop the blaming here? No one is perfect."]

[> Both extremes are awful and hypocritical. No one will disagree with you there which is why both extremes usually find themselves on the fringes when it comes to politics. However, this election has brought the far right-wing front and center by one of the major presidential candidates whereas the far left has remained where they always are. Can you seriously imagine an anarchist being an ardent Clinton supporter?]
[You have to wonder with all the anti-establishment RNC talk going on at Trump rallies whether this might have been done by Trump supporters.]

[And false flag strategies are well-known to neonazis. But no need to point fingers from either side - let's just condemn it outright - no matter who.]
[What good does a comment that says, essentially "Yeah you're right, and these neo-Nazis we're up against would totally pull that shit. But nevermind that it doesn't matter, this was wrong" do? Your whole "no matter who" bit is literally pointless - you spent the first half of your comment speculating that it's the "neo-Nazi Republicans" (which, by the way, way to basically quote the graffiti on the building's wall) who bombed their own HQ. You don't get to play Mr. Nice Bipartisan after that.]
[That it might be people who hate neonazis is obvious. That it might be a false flag (which neonazis talk about ALL the time) is not well known or obvious. Crazy people on either side might have a reason to do it - let's condemn it and hope they are caught. A simple downvote would have done just fine. Not sure why you are so hyped up.]
[It sure eerily seems like something done by the a local GOP staffer to gain sympathy. I have a feeling if they find a suspect, it's not going to be a Clinton supporter.]
[Well that's a fantastic conjecture with no basis in reality. Ever heard the term "victim blaming"?]
[This honestly sounds staged.]
[Stop that. Only the Republicans are conspiracy theorists.]
[Not saying it *was* staged. Just that honestly it is difficult for me to believe that people leaning left on the political spectrum would do this.]
[I smell false flag.]
["Molotovs don't melt yard signs!"]
[Personally, this is just one more reason to support changing our model of government. The premise behind the two-party model is that the parties will serve as counterweights to each other, ultimately ending up in the middle over time. But the parties have ceased to perform this function, instead existing only to impede the other. And there should be consequences at the polls and beyond for failing to support a functional government.]
[Why did the journalist report that the Graffiti said "Nazi Republicans get out of town" when I can see the side of the building from the picture and it says "Nazi Republicans Leave Town"]
[Great job giving Trump and the rest of the alt-right a chance to portray themselves as victims.]
[At first I though it might be Trump supporters mad at the republicans for dumping Trump. Now it looks like false flag to me.]
[Probably a well timed insurance scam from the property owner.]
[Full on liberal here. I consider this domestic political terrorism and hope the FBI founds these folks ASAP. Rule of law, civilized society, etc. Part of me wonders if it was some Alt Right folks staging an attack..]
[Horrible, but the Donald needs to remember you reap what you sow. Dangerous to rouse any kind of extreme behavior.]
[A GOP office firebombed? I'd assume it was angry Trumpets? >A swastika and the words “Nazi Republicans get out of town or else” were spray painted on the side of an adjacent building. No damage estimates were available. Hmm... nevermind; unlikely. Possible.]

[Google Reichstag fire]
[Shit. ~80 years ago, 1933 a [fire in the parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichstag_fire) allegedly started by a commie was used by the Nazis to speed up their systematic take over and disenfranchising whole minorities legally. 5 years later, they went beserk in events called the [Reichskristallnacht](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristallnacht#Shooting_of_vom_Rath), and they used a crime committed by a jew as excuse.]
[It's starting.]
[Looks like some big ol' heroes have been bashing the fash!]
[American politics should never descend into violence. You know, unless we're bombing another country or torturing people or assassinating foreign leaders. But other than that, violence is completely unacceptable in American politics.]
[How about financing guerrilla fighters that we know nothing about, because they are fighting someone we don't like. Does that count too?]
[Also other than that.]
[The media is wipping the Fanatical Hillary Brownshirts into a frenzy, it's just a matter of time before Trump supporters are beaten up. I mean besides the incident in San Jose.]

[Can you imagine the outrage if the media was able to say Trump supporters did this? Oh man. But because its not this will be blown over in a day or somehow blamed on Trump.]
[It's possible Trump supporters did do this. False-flag opposition is an ancient strategy. Roger Stone, once Trump's political advisor and now head of a Trump super PAC, is infamous for it. He organized The Brooke's Brothers Riot.]
[No, I lived there, I'm almost sure this isn't a false flag thing. Left Wing rules Orange County.]
[I'm actually from there, too, but that's beside the point. Nothing about the location changes the probability; The Brooke's Brothers weren't from Florida. They were hired to go there and stage a fake riot.]
[I suggest it's desperate republicans trying to get the sympathy vote. There would be no reason for the dems or their supporters to get violent when they're winning. Just look at those militia types trying to start a religious war by killing innocent people.]

[I got $5 on false flag attack.]
[What are you basing that bet on? Certainly not videos of Clinton supporters vandalizing Trump signs and clothing.]
[Trump supporters are also capable of violence. And given the violent rhetoric is coming from the right, with [sheriff's](http://conservativetribune.com/sheriffs-group-calls-for-rebellion/) calling for [rebellion](https://thinkprogress.org/sheriff-openly-calls-for-riots-as-trump-says-election-is-rigged-dfe1a7ffc2b#.y3u7k3ux8) and gun toting right wingers have the knowledge and propensity to commit [fire bomb attacks](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/three-militia-members-kansas-somali-muslim-bomb-plot) and making [death rays](http://time.com/4002184/kkk-member-death-ray/) it's not a far leap that an intelligent fascist would realize the best way to gain sympathy isn't to bomb the enemy, but to bomb themselves and blame the enemy. Are Democrats known for domestic terrorism of this nature?]
[BLM protesters have repeatedly looted stores and assaulted people. I seriously doubt they vote Republican. As an aside, I'm not stating this to condone or condemn BLM.]
[Indiscriminate looting & rioting are different than anonymous acts of terrorism. 2 separate but deplorable motivations behind the acts. Again, do Democrats or left wing people have a history of trying to commit these kinds of acts of terrorism towards a specific target?]
[A history, definitely. Just look up the Symbionese Liberation Army. But I know you want more recent [examples](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SU8zYHWbnY) [another, longer example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUkT4Z-_xCA) To be clear, I'm not a Trump or Hilary supporter, I just think it's absurd that so many people are jumping to conclusions with no evidence.]
[The events you show are not acts of terrorism on par with what we're talking about. And the SLA is one group in the 70's involved in bank robbing and kidnapping - not bombings - that's hardly a 'history' compared to what can be said about the extent of right wing terrorism in the US. I could easily show [Trump supporters causing violence](http://www.redstate.com/leon_h_wolf/2016/06/06/trump-supporters-pepper-spray-non-violent-protesters-video/) at rallies too. Assaulting people in open areas is not the same as planning to and carrying out a relatively sophisticated bomb attack - which is clearly an act of domestic terrorism different than the thuggery seen at rallies. As for your political affiliation it doesn't matter, there is decent speculative reason to think that right wingers are capable and willing to bomb buildings for their cause, again it's not a far leap to think a more forward thinking fascist could perform a false flag operation. It could be a left winger - but I have $5 on the right.]
[The odds of it being a false flag are so regrettably high.]
[Incredible, Trump supporters are ready to bomb their own buildings to try and blame the liberals. This just shows the danger that represent Trump and his supporters.]
[Yup. I'm sure that's what happened. Those dumb rednecks are known for burning down their own buildings. Just like all of those people that ever crossed Hillary decided to shoot themselves in the head]
[you seem mentally stable...]
[Do I? You deserve some sort of award in psychology if you are able to evaluate a person's mental state based on a simple statement. But of course anyone that dares to disagree with a tolerant liberal is obviously not sane.]

[It's not obviously done by anyone at this point. Whomever did it is a criminal asshole, I don't give a fuck who they support. Their ass needs to be in jail.]

We don’t have a post office here, so sending them back wasn’t an option. Extra space is scarce and alternatives that a few mentioned, like recycling, are nonexistent...I’m aware of the historical implications of book-burning.

[I live in this area. I'd say it more likely just some redneck bullshit, not some political hate crime. Hillsborough is small, but there are older professional types that go there. It's a 20 minute commute from anywhere. Let's not assume there was some left-wing extremists at play.]
[> Let's not assume there was some left-wing extremists at play. Yeah...no. That's exactly what to assume in this situation.]

[By blowing up a couple hundred Somali refugees?]
[I'm not usually the suspicious type with things like this, but honestly a part of me thinks this firebombing was actually Trump supporters trying to drum up some kind of publicity.]
[This was probably a false flag attack to galvanize their base.]
[Couldn't possibly be Trump behind this, could it? Was it not a firebombing false flag that led to Hitler's seizure of power?]
[Eeehhh, you know, I was going to make a crack about it being an attack on democracy...but then I realized that Trump _did_ manage to get picked as a dark horse on the Republican side. Technically, I think that puts them half a step ahead of the Democrats with the collusion going on in the DNC. All the same, I'm gonna say this wasn't an attack on democracy so much as it was an attack on a group of people that tends to espouse really shitty beliefs. That seems a lot more likely on the whole. Kind of a shitty move, but then again if there's one thing we've learned this election, it's that both parties are shitty and not really representing the people, so I guess this is one of many logical outcomes.]
[When Trump supporters talk about scary things: "Trump incites violence!" When Bernie supporters pick up a chair and put it back down: "Bernie incites violence!" When the RNC is subject to a terrorist act: "It doesn't matter who these people are, they're bad apples!"]

[I believe the subreddit you're looking for is /r/conspiracy.]
[I seriously doubt this was Clinton supporters, either way it was very wrong to do. I say this as a Clinton supporter]
[Who else would attack the RNC in a heavily Democratic part of the state, but sure... FYI I'm a heavy left leaner too. I am not a Trump supporter. But I think denying these things makes us look bad. Of course, it doesn't matter because my comment will quickly disappear in downvotes anyway.]
[What would be the point of attacking the losing campaign and shift the focus away from Gropegate, tax returns, etc.? There would be no political advantage to this. And it is a despicable, anti-democratic act. We are better than this.]

[We'love see, but my guess is that it's not.]
[Pls stop, we'll know when we know]
[Look how many comments saying that this was a "false-flag" like it is somehow far-fetched that leftists actually did this... Folks, for a year now you and the media have been screaming that Trump is "literally Hitler" that must be stopped at any costs .. you laughed and cheered when Trump supporters' property was vandalized, you laughed and cheered when leftist mobs physically assaulted Trump supporters in the streets who were just trying to get home after a rally.. don't act surprised now that the violence against Trump supporters is escalating.]
[no...you made that up]
[This is bad enough but it also proves beyond overwhelming doubt that Trump is unfit to rule this country. **Unquestionably the worst candidate in the history of the United States.** Why would he stoke this fire and drive division further? He is fucking lunatic that would cause irreparable damage to the fabric of our country.]
[I can't imagine how he'd be if he were president and one of our foreign assets got attacked. He's just seems like the type of guy that would just immediately blame someone and order a counter attack without waiting for evidence.]
[I hate to imagine what the left and thugs will do when Trump wins. Buy a gun, people.]
[>And let me tell you, she (Hillary) has tremendous hate in her heart.]
[This is just the beginning. This is what the left is willing to do at just the POSSIBILITY of Trump winning. Imagine how crazy these people will get once they lose.]
[Trump literally called to march on Washington when Romney won. This was an attack by an extremist which was immediately condemned by Clinton and not incited by her. Anyone can say that the other side will rebel if their side wins, but nobody will actually rebel.]
[This is satire, right? Your comment is a joke about how gun nuts will react when trump loses?]
[You keep crowing on as if people outside your bubble will by your narrative.]
[Here's a question, though - do you think he's wrong? I'm not voting for Trump; I'm glad there's no chance the guy gets elected. But you're really telling me that after a full year of being told Trump is the next Hitler, liberals would commit literally zero violence in response to his unlikely election?]
[I've seen Trump supporters talk about there being bloodshed if they lose. Both sides have violent people, and it will possibly get violent either way.]
[You'd pretty much have to imagine it.. because in the real world, Trump won't win :)]
[This comment brought to you by the gun lobby and fearmongerers united. Should this person be brought to justice, yes. But let me know when liberals start planning car bombings on Somali refugees and abortion clinics.]
[A 100 people were shot in Chicago this weekend, and 95% of the shooters were Democrats.]
[Is this political violence?]
[>A 100 people were shot in Chicago this weekend, and 95% of the shooters were Democrats. Sounds like the Republicans need to make stricter gun laws]
[Lol, are you serious? You can't be serious.]
[That's statistically nearly impossible given that the number of murders in Chicago average around two or three a day. Also, people who go around murdering each other tend not to vote period.]
[It's people that got shot, not all of them died. Still a saddening metric. It's not really relevant seeing as this isn't political violence which is what is being discussed here.]
[So I guess the takeaway here is that there aren't enough guns in Chicago. Anyway, I looked it up and it was over a week and not over a weekend, but yeah I guess at its peak 100 people got shot in a week in Chicago recently. However sad that may be, it is still out of nearly 3 million people, so even at its worse there are still far more dangerous places to be right now. Maybe Chicago should take the issue up with their Republican governor...]

But it sure seems like most of those opposed to trump vs most of those opposed to Clinton express their opposition differently. Either way the guilty party should be caught and punished. Violence rarely lends credence to your cause.]

[I'm not making any claims, but this doesn't smack of the kind of target the radical left would choose. They hate both parties the corporations. Part of it is that it almost identical to black church attacks and the spray painted message was incredibly generic. That's just my gut and it's not scientific at all. I'm sure someone will get caught though.]

[Liberals? looks like anarchists to me..]
[No evidence of anything, yet still jumping to conclusions. Tell me, how much money do psychics make these days.]
[it's funny how trump immediately blamed it on hillary supporters - because it would be just as reasonable for a desperate right-wing nut job to do this in an attempt to drum up controversy. or it could have been insurance fraud.]

[I can see it now "Vigilante who firebombed evil Nazi HQ was touched by trump" This will either be praised or blow over in 2 days]
[I'm going to borrow one from the Trump camp here. False Flag. Or it's just idiots who belong in jail.]
[Pretty outraged to see this kind of thing. Hope they catch the person responsible. But I must say that this attack does seem strange. This is the kind of act you would expect to be done by someone who is very, very angry. Why would Democrats be really angry right now? Trump is getting clobbered over the past couple of weeks, and Dems should be pretty happy. I suppose it could be someone very mentally unstable, or else someone furious over Trump's denials of the sexual abuse allegations. I would *hope* that cooler heads prevail and no one on either side will escalate the situation to increase the risjk of future violence, but I have a bad feeling that Trump will ratchet things up and people could actually get hurt. His instincts seem to be to rile up the mob.]
[My guess would be that it's someone who isn't aligned with either party.]
[Yeah this is the kind of attack you would see by someone who is far left-wing. Radical leftists have gangs similar to radical rightwingers. I'm not sure if it's because the Overton window is so skewed right in the US that we see so many fewer leftwing domestic terrorist attacks compared to right wing.]
[>Yeah this is the kind of attack you would see by someone who is far left-wing. Radical leftists have gangs similar to radical rightwingers. Slightly off topic but related - the far left and far right have more in common than anybody would like to admit - both ideologically and in terms of behavior. The far fringes of both sides of the ideological spectrum are fucking scary.]
[I just learned this the other day, but that's called the horseshoe theory https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseshoe_theory]
[It's certainly possible that the attack was a false flag, but since the dems are in power I would expect that to be discovered faster than usual or not at all. So if it takes more than a couple weeks that possibility should be written off.]
[On both sides the recommended course of action becomes violence because there are necessary regime changes that can't be incremental. That isn't to say the policies that should be used after the fact are similar between both extremes at all.]
[More likely a rabid Trump supporter but there's plenty of crazy people out there.]
[I've lived in this area and despite being pretty left-leaning myself, I felt there were at least a few militant crazies out and about. Plus there are lots of young students and teens who can create echo chambers. Dogma comes from lots of places and backgrounds. However it's always shocking when anyone, anywhere, does something this evil and pointless. I hope everyone is truly ok over there!]

[understand the sentiment != glad ever see a kid antagonize another kid over time and eventually the antagonized one retaliates a by socking the bully in the jaw? anything similar? i can understand the response. doesn't mean i think violence was desirable.]
[Anyone find it funny to see trump condemning violence when he encourages it at his own rallies ?]

[>Clinton is a pure saint with holy followers I don't see how this could possibly be the liberal narrative when most liberals and progressives don't even like her. 45% of democrats voted for Sanders in the primary.]
[You have the right to believe that. I have to go rig the election. It was nice talking to you.]
[and baseless false flag conspiracies to suggest.]
[So...are you the pot or the kettle? Gotta go elections don't just rig themselves.]
[What hurt their "narrative"? They're doing great in the polls.]
[False flag!]
[Could be depending. Anyways, the perps need to be brought to swift justice (really? A downvote?) Just to add, think this election will require extra police presence for each party HQ in at least swing localities (if not more) and election sites.]
[It could have been. Why 'Nazi Republicans'? Why not just 'Nazis get out of town'? Seems weird, but this election cycle has gotten pretty crazy.]
[Potentially "Nazi Republicans" because it was on the side of a *Republican* HQ?]
[Which is why it sort of seemed unnecessary.]
[So that's your evidence of a false flag? That they wrote the word Republican and it "seemed sort of unnecessary"? If the KKK wrote on an NAACP headquarters "blacks leave town or else," would you be saying "well, why would they write 'blacks', it's the NAACP, 'Colored People' is in the name. Must be a false flag" I think I'll just wait on the facts, thanks.]
[Lighten up, Francis. I didn't say it was. I said it could be, and the only thing that seems weird was adding 'Republican' to it. Per your example, they wouldn't paint 'Leave town scumbag members of NAACP'. They'd paint the obvious slur on it, 'get out n****rs'. In the case of the Republican headquarters they probably wouldn't differentiate between the Nazi Republicans, and the run of the mill types. There isn't any evidence. I was just throwing the only thing I could see that was odd, in my opinion.]
[I was think that too but Trump's supporters are too dumb for a false flag operation.]
[Lol the irony - "I was think that too but they too dumb to know how do false flag. Not like me, me smart."]
[You using general statements to define millions of Trump's supporters isn't really showing your intelligence.]
[there are millions of dumb people, certainly. bell curve basics, bruh.]
[[Obvious false flag is obvious.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cu6gHplWYAAqiJf.jpg) /s Source: https://twitter.com/NCGOP/status/787743049312972800]
[Delusional Hillary supporter is delusional.]
[You must have missed the /s, he's a Trump supporter.]
[Trump supporters are getting desperate.]
[Don't be fooled. This is might be a false flag. Trump is so dirty and low, he would do anything to win. He hire Russian agent Paul Manafort(before get busted) and people like Roger Stones who did dirty work for him. He even call Russian to hacking Hillary's campaign and hinting on assassination. He is hiding his tax return on his Russian connections. During the primary Trump tried to pin Ted Cruz has a affair with five woman(which become a non story), and his father assassinated JFK. So this is definitely a possible scenario. edit I guess /r/the_deplorables has come out of the basket.]
[Says a person with the name delete_the_donald. Yikes.]
[They should delete it, their existence is cancer of the reddit. they pour more hate than Fatpeoplehate yet Admins did nothing about it. join /r/delete_the_donald so we can take it down together.]
[Why would we take down the only sub dedicated to getting accurate information? That seems like a big mistake. There may be a few bad apples there, but overall they've managed to disseminate (accurately too) a lot of information this sub simply won't cover. I actually can't find anything hate-filled over there. Again, not saying it isn't there, but it certainly isn't the goal of that sub. If you can link me something within the first few pages I'd be surprised. In fact, I've seen more screwed up material on this sub.]
[he's clearly in favor of deleting that hate-filled reddit sub, not killing Trump...]
[It's not a hate-filled sub at all.]
[We clearly are not talking about the same subreddit...]
[Are you talking about r/the_donald? I'm not great at reddit so apologies if I was mistaken.]
[Damn -- you are in *deep*, dude. Are you not even a little bit skeptical of the propaganda you're being fed?]
[A false flag scenario is unlikely when you take into account the sign painted on the wall was spelled correctly. /s]
[I'm sure I'll be downvoted to oblivion for this, but my money is on a false flag attack.]
[Would not surprise me at all. . It's north Carolina after all. Edit: did they seriously claim there were "absentee ballots already filled "inside?? Why the fuck would they even have those. .]
[More cowardly crap from the modern day fascists aka the left wing! Please stop being so aggressive and violent... Try being peaceful for a change. The left wing are afraid of guns because they know if they had them they wouldn't be able to stop themselves from using them on others - over things like spilled milk.]
[This sort of thing is what turns a dumb election into a bad election. I'm waiting to see just what Trump's response will be, will he take things a step up? His rhetoric recently sounds like things could go terrible quickly.]
[> will he take things a step up [of course he did](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/787782613633208320)]
[No matter what he says, it will be met by chants of "Well YOU provoked it!"]
[how can anyone think this is a good idea. democrats have to know that this only hurts their cause. unless.. unless it wasn't the democrats. dum dum dummmmm!]
[Un-fucking-acceptable.]
[Seriously, wth.]
[Hope they have some good cameras there and caught a clear image on film exactly who did it, and that they spend a LOT of time in jail. However, I find it really weird that the side with the most pledged electoral votes, and winning the popular vote, would do something like that. If it was someone claiming to be a dem, it is probably a college or high school kid.]
[In this era of traffic cams, and most corner gas stations and road facing businesses having recorded CCTV cameras for liability protection, I predict federal authorities will enact an arrest no later than Wednesday.]
[Anyone got odds on if they did it themselves for publicity?]
[I doubt they did it themselves. I think there are good odds that Trump supporters did this. Who else is so angry?]
[It sounds like the kind of attention-grabbing bullshit a group of rednecks would come up with when they realized their candidate was flagging and that they desperately needed both local media attention and some sympathy.]
[That's my bet. We need to see if this guy issued any statements denouncing the Orange.]
[I'm not going to cast judgment until we know who the culprit is - all I know is that only one candidate has expressed pure, unbridled hatred towards the Rebublican Party, just sayin]
[Disgruntled Mexican, or disgruntled Trump supporter?]
[The one before the Mexican and Trump supporter.]
[America needs to have a long, hard look at its gun control policies. Disgusting.]
[It was a firebombing. Not a shooting.]
[False flag.]
[Let me take something out of the far-right playbook: **It was a false flag in order to garner sympathy for Trump due to his low poll numbers!** Of course, I don't believe that. But if the reverse had happened, I guarantee you 100% that teh_retard and Alex Jones would be screaming this all day.]
[This is exactly the kind of thing needed to change the discussion from Trump's sleazy sexual aggression to something else. Something where he gets to play victim and blame the opposition.]

[The projection of your candidate is contagious...]
[Could probably go both ways]
[OFFS. Quit.]
[Nice zippy headline! We can tell you worked hard on it!]
["The county is overwhelmingly Democratic. Democrats and independents outnumber Republicans 5-1." Aside from being irrelevant, this seems to also be rather misleading. According to this gallop poll from September 14th through 18, 2016, 27% of respondents said they considered themselves to be republicans, 40% independents, and 32% democrats. Furthermore, the poll asked independents which of the two parties they leaned toward. Taking the response of these two questions, 44% responded as identifying as a republican or leaning toward the party and 49% responded as identifying as a democratic or leaning towards the party. http://www.gallup.com/poll/15370/party-affiliation.aspx I'd like to see the article's source.]
[I'd love to take this as a time to tell everyone- beg them- to take a moment to call down, pull back, get some perspective. This election is pulling people to the brink. We have to respect the law. We have to respect each other. We have to respect the basic sanctity of life. Please, this is not something to throw lives away over. This should be a time for people to come together. What I know, though, is that I've been anticipating a rise in political violence for months. I just thought it wouldn't happen until after the election. Things are gonna get worse before they get better and America will hang its head low.]
[Maybe it's just me, but for me, this is not OK!! I don't even necessarily agree with the targeted political party, and I'm saying this!]
[Was it Trumpicans ? after all they are at 'war' with the spineless republicans that have been pulling their support from their chosen candidate.]
[I'm pretty sure most people in the Republican party (not Republican voters) greatly dislike Trump. So do people just assume the Repubs are all aboard the Trump train and are set on targeting everyone in red? I expect this shit from some ring wing militia warrior, not someone super left, anti-weapons pacifist.]
[Ultraleft more like anarchists than pacifists.]

[You are a terrible person]
[Well, you know. If the enemy is winning, nothing beats simpathy. Burn a building where you are in minority, to get people outraged, and vote for you instead. It reminds me of 27 February 1933, but I'm sure Mr. Trump would never use such vile tricks. /s]
[Probably Trump's people rigging the election.]
[I have a feeling this is going to end up like the person who scratched 'B' for Barak on her face and said it was done by black men.

[They did it to themselves.]
[This reflects badly on Trump if anything. He's the fire and brimstone guy. I'm just happy no one died, or else we'd be in all out civil war.]
[No we wouldn't dude. I swear to christ, I'm starting to think that everyone is so fucking bored that they want a civil war. We used to have a lot of political violence in the states. Things are better than they have ever been, despite what the media says.]
[This comes from the name calling (deplorables & rednecks) and the hatred promoted by a party that claims that their opposition should be arrested for treason and sedition. Their followers take to violence once again. Are the 1960s to return?]
[Both sides do this all the time. Both sides have had crazy people who have done shit like this.]
[There is no way this isn't a NC-GOP engineered stunt. No. Fucking. Way.]
[The FBI and the ATF are all over this. They're gonna crack it like an egg. This is more deliberate than passionate. It's not like getting in a fistfight or a shouting match. This was *planned*, which could mean either revenge or provocation or something far more calculated.]

Neither one wanted to press charges, so no arrests were made," Danielsen said." -Greensboro Police Department spokeswoman Susan Danielsen]

[Why does everyone immediately blame entire ideologies instead of the individual responsible? Whoever did this is scum doesn't make all liberals scum same way dicks who fight protestors at Trump rallies doesn't make all conservatives scum.]

[This shit is not okay at all. "When they go low, we go high" really should be the Dem's motto for everything. And to think (imo), the Dem's were in the clear to come out of this looking really good compared to Trump and his diehards. I know it's just a few bad apples, but come on...]
[Trump supporters did this to gain sympathy.]
[More likely, Trump supporters did this in retaliation to Republicans withdrawing support. Trump said Republicans are worse than cruked Hillary]
[you have no proof of that]
[You can not disprove it either.]
[OK, Donald. That still doesn't give you license to throw around wild accusations. I wasn't the one coming up with scapegoats sans facts.]

[The progressive sentiment here in Chapel Hill is almost unbearable. I regularly visit comedy clubs in Chapel Hill and an audience will boo if material is even remotely politically incorrect. You can hear the pretentious mutterings throughout any audience. And what's more you can't have a conversation with someone about an issue without them storming off angrily or shutting you off as a friend. I really hope this isn't an indication of NC's future. I can totally see an act like this being perpetrated by students of UNC.]
[Damn what's up with kids these day, having radical respect for each other, and seriously not being into bigotry.]
[I don't think art should be judged in terms of bigotry. I'm specifically talking about improv shows where the characters are acting irrationally as part of a scene. The crowd is booing an improviser when they should be laughing at a character. Comedy in general is a heuristic approach to teaching people morals. Morality is better found in laughter than in judgmental moralizing that comes from god knows what authority.]

[It was probably trump honestly. Trying to make it look like dems.]
[Hillary and the Democrats must be held accountable for their demonization of opponents. The Democrats know that their path to power is by creating an us vs them attitude which is why Hillary's unconscionable "deplorable" and "irredeemable" rhetoric must be called out and condemned in the strongest means possible.]

[Yeah, those two things aren't comparable at all, but nice try.]
[They are unless you're not mentally capable of understanding. Victim blaming is victim blaming, the situation doesn't change it.]
[Sorry, I'm not going to shed tears over people who are actively trying to take away my rights as a human being. I don't enjoy the fact that their property was destroyed, but they're people actively working to take my freedoms away and I will never feel sorry for them.]

[ah yes, "I wouldn't have done it, but I can see why people would" please, stand by more.]
[> I don't condone this act; however, you reap what you sow. Would you say the same thing to a woman who was raped after walking down the street drunk?]
[what makes you think that is comparable? are you republican? odd.]
[I am a progressive. LordPenny was engaging in victim blaming, which is a very big no-no.]
[comparing republicans who advocate stripping the rights from minorites with a female rape victim is laughable. But republicans always think they're the ones being oppressed, war on families, war on Christmas, etc. Meanwhile Trump wants to oppress minorities, women, and generally actually be a honest to god fascist who doesn't know why we shouldn't use nuclear weapons.]
[I see what you're saying. It's okay to say Republicans were asking for it because they're Republicans.]
[Sorry, I'm not going to shed tears over people who are actively trying to take away my rights as a human being. I don't enjoy the fact that their property was destroyed, but they're people actively working to take my freedoms away and I will never feel sorry for them.]

[well, the nazi's are unlikely to leave, so no parties yet.]
[No. This is a vicious crime and the culprits need to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.]
[Good to know some of you people are still decent human beings. The things said on this subreddit and thedonald are beyond disgusting. I hope you all remember the constitution doesn't mention Republican or Democrats. Its about our democracy. I wish some of you would defend the country and our democracy instead of the parties bc both of these candidates are fn disgusting and shame on ALL OF YOU defending either. Imagine if everyone have the balls, the fortitude and the bravery to write in "non of the above" on Nov 5th. Imagine if the people demanded we take our liberty back and say "NO MORE" to this corrupt system. Imagine if people had the bravery the founding fathers had to say ENOUGH instead of picking which corrupt team you want to cheer for. Oh what a day that would be. Alas, we have become a country of mindless sheep who would rather wear their team jersey then stand on their own merit and denounce the corruption that will destroy our republic bc here is the thing....no matter who wins...WE HAVE ALL LOST. Trump is a brick thrown though the window to get our attention. Hillary is the building that represents how we got here and why it wont change. NEITHER are the answer but you all choose to believe you have to choose one. There is no going back after this election y'all. The damage is done. We are in for a brave new world the likes not seen since the 60's after this. The question is will you stand on the side of the republic of will you stand with the two corrupt parties who allowed this to happen. Its up to you for the sake your children and your family. Wake up.....just wake the f up.]
[This usually comes from the left. I am in no way saying one side is worse than the other, but it is the case in the past 5 decades or so. Violence is never the answer. I know plenty of people who are afraid of putting Trump stickers on their cars or signs on their lawns for fear of vandalism. That bums me out.]
[Actually violence has almost exclusively come from the right. It's wrong no.matter who does it.]
[Yesterday three men were caught who were planning on bombing Somali refugees in Kansas. It happens on both sides.]
[I'm independent but this shit makes me want to vote Republican]
[Why? Where is the proof it wasn't a Republican? The office was an RNC office, which oddly enough, is at extreme odds with Trump, who has been bashing them for over a week now. It can be anyone, but don't discount either side.]
[The graffiti labeling the Republicans as Nazis is a good indicator that it probably wasn't a Right-winger, especially since Nazi accusations and comparisons have been a go-to argument from the Left since the primaries...]
[I don't understand why liberals are so violent and hate democracy]
[Same could be said about conservatives. But who ever believes that is ignorant to what their party has had people do.]
[It's apparent that you don't understand a lot of things.]
[We don't, whoever did this is a fucking asshole]
[The tolerant left strikes again. I don't think CNN will be reporting this]
[This is as bad as calling this a false flag operation.]
[So you'll blame the left and Islam when they do something terrible like this, but not the right and Christians when they do something equally terrible?]
[Is the article about Islam? You would likely be seething if this was a mosque that was vandalized by Republican's, but since it was a GOP building I guess just make blanket statements and deflect some more.]

[If you are actually a Marine, thank you for your service. I find it hard to believe though because a Marine should know what real bigotry looks like, and it sure as hell is this anything I said.]
[>If you are actually a Marine, thank you for your service Honestly no need to thank me, but I do appreciate it. I loved my time in. I'm a relatively young vet, so I volunteered knowing what I did. Thanks make me feel weird. Still appreciated though. >I find it hard to believe though because a Marine should know what real bigotry looks like, and it sure as hell is this anything I said. Maybe we are at an impasse on this one, and that's really okay. The Corps was were I lost my bigotry. A gay corpsman saved my life, and a gay s-2 (why is it always intel?

[If only we were running for Presidient. No worries /u/zachHu1. I look forward to seeing what you have to say in the future as a friend.]
[That is a prime example of motivated reasoning, there is currently no evidence of who did it or why. It could have been liberals attacking the office, it could have been Trump supporters trying to manufacture an attack on their side. Both scenarios have happened in the past.]
["Time will tell what their motives are"]
[There are stupid people on all sides. Don't ignore the people condemning this act.]
[Yeah, but specifically this subreddit and the media attack extreme and numerous attacks on Republicans or Trump supporters.]
[Anyone promoting physically attacking supporters of any side belong in the stupid people category. Criticizing the ideas held by supporters of any side doesn't count as attacking.]

[The fire rises.]
[Plot Twist: They firebombed themselves.]
[I'm not supportive, but I don't think you could reasonably expect a base as polarized and polarizing as the GOPs, who have attacked and bombed many things over the years, to not have something like this happen. Unlike their efforts, which have killed dozens, I hope everyone made it out okay.]
[I've seen several ask elsewhere, so... Is there any concern this is a false flag attack?]
[Well it worked for Hitler, and Trump has a copy of Mein Kampf...seems like he's emulated Hitler's speech patterns and inflammatory views...fits right into the template.]
[Let's not join the tinfoil hat brigade. Nobody seems to have any idea who did it at this point. Jumping to conclusions like that helps nobody. Investigations will be performed, and hopefully the perpetrators will be identified.]
[I don't know why its being assumed this was leftists. Trump has been inciting violence against everyone including the Republican establishment. Trump's followers are the ones who clock old ladies at their rallies; they're the one's with the anger problem. Every dem and lefty I know is simply terrified and appalled...]
[Jesus Christ people. Top few posts are all "they should be punished no matter what party they are" and "I'm a democrat and I think this is wrong". I should fucking hope so. That's not the kind of thing any reasonable person should have to say or expect to be said. But hey, easy karma right?]
[Thanks for adding to it I guess?]
[I enjoy seeing the /r/politics crocodile tears. You are fooling no one. This is war]
[go away with that ridiculous rhetoric]
[/r/politics paves the pathway for events like this by calling for open persecution on anyone on the right. Those deplorables. The literal Nazis. You're surprised by events like this? I'm more surprised /r/politics is condemning it. They paved this road and are surprised wheb someone use this route.]
[you calling for war doesn't help anything. i've seen idiots on both sides contributing to this. A Planned Parenthood shooting on one end, on another an assault on cops in Dallas on the other. Both events were motivated by the political climate at the time. So once again knock it off with that crap.]
[It's already war. May the best side win.]
[Hasn't Trump been advocating violence this whole campaign?]
[I'm a conspiracy theorist, but this is a valid theory in the game of mass social manipulation What if Republicans did this to rile up the base and incite violence? Inciting violence is the calling card of one party in this race more than the other. We may never know, but never discount what isn't obvious. EDIT: American narcissism really believes there is one side to every coin. My advice is to open your other eye and look at the whole picture. My statement was a 'what if' if you can't handle that you shouldn't vote.]
[>Inciting violence is the calling card of one party in this race more than the other. Thank you for pointing this out. Hearing about all of those Trump supporters being ambushed and attacked and put in hospitals was an awful time. Although it is still happening, it is at a much lesser amount than it was a couple weeks ago. There are hundreds of videos on YouTube that show Trump supporters (Republicans in general if you go back before he was the nominee) being attacked for no reason other than the person they are voting for. That is truly sickening behavior.]
[mass social manipulation is clinton's number 1 weapon, not trump]
[Both are politicians, both fight with the same fists. I find both equally deplorable.]
[he is businessman]
[not a mutually exclusive thing.]
[Time Warner paid for her campaign]
[you must be crazy. Hell, mr. "we rig every damn online poll to make people think Trump is winning"]
[it was rig against bernie why not against trump later?]
[I love how the left, Hillary, Obama, the MSM, etc., criticizes Trump's rhetoric and says it will incite violence...but then Hillary Clinton calls 1/4 of the country deplorable and unredeemable. Calls them all kinds of "-ists." And then a Republican campaign office is firebombed. If the shoe was on the other foot, the MSM would be calling for Trump's head. Blaming it on him. Trying to hold him accountable. Why isn't Hillary being held to the same standard? Oh that's right...because the rules are different for her.]
[Because how on earth is that one Clinton line the same as *everything* we've seen Trump say? Also how much was Obama called a socialist, a communist, a secret Muslim in the last decade?]
[It's hilarious. Conspiracies are accepted by the left only when it benefits them. Trump supporters are not the ones attacking people in the streets, stealing their property (signs/hats), beating them, burning down buildings. Give me a break with this "inside job" shit. Pathetic, just like Hillary's "supporters".]
[Anyone else think of the movie Leaves of Grass? For those who haven't seen it, there was a crime of vandalism in the movie meant to re-direct attention from their own crime to white supremacists by spray painting a swastika on a wall in the aftermath of a crime. Only problem was, they spray painted the swastika backwards. Call me crazy. I feel like this is something like that and we're going to get two or three pictures in a few days that will clear it all up.]
[This is bad for many reasons. Whatever idiot is responsible just gave the right a lot of ammunition. Everything Trumps thugs have been saying can now be justified. All this does is prove their moronic belief that they are a persecuted class. I'm as anti-Trump as the next guy but this does far more harm then good to Clinton.]
[People are going to die on election day. I can feel it in the air. This is going to get ugly.]
[But.. but.. that sheriff man said torches and pitchforks!]
[Wow good job Hillary. Have your corruption somewhere else]
[Take a moment to note that the thread is *not* full of people claiming this was done by Republicans to gain sympathy and misrepresent their opponents as violent, which is precisely what would happen if the Democrats were attacked.]
[[deleted]]
[That's the *opposite* of what I mean. The thread isn't full of liberals claiming the firebombers must be Trump supporters in a false flag attack.]
[That's like half of the comments section here. Without opening further comments there's about a half dozen mentions of the "Reichstag Fire" and over a dozen "False Flag" comments.]
[That's literally untrue. Don't know what your viewing settings are, but I have to scroll three quarters down to find one lonely "inside job" comment. If it had been a Democratic headquarters, it would be false flag claims from top to bottom.]
[More terrorism inspired by Donald "Rapelord" Drumpf]

[Reading the comments in this thread https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/57r65t/vote_house_republicans_out/ I'm not even surprised.]
[This subreddit has tremendous hate in its heart.]
["tolerant left"]
[Terrorist attack by Hillary supporters. The brown shirts are marching.]
[Did you make a similar comment when there were terrorists attempting to bomb churches last week?]
[Did they attempt to bomb on behalf of Trump? Nope. Stay triggered, terrorist supporter.]
[Lmao, yeah, him talking about how Muslims want to take your freedoms and rape your wives surely didn't incite that. And what's up with dumbdick Trump supporters calling everyone a terrorist supporter? Right after you refused to even say something bad about the actual right wing terrorists that were caught? Someone here is triggered and it isnt me.]
[Grab some tinfoil, you triggered useful pet.]
[Man, you are something else. Claiming a firebombing with no suspects caught has to be incited by Clinton calling half of Trump supporters deplorable = Totally reasonable Claiming that Trump's statements saying that Muslims are a danger to your freedom and safety caused Trump supporters to hatch a terrorism plot against Muslims = Tinfoil triggerdom Still waiting on you to denounce the *actual* terror plot that was foiled thanks to our men and women in blue.]
[If you're going to draw parallels between this incident and the rise of Nazi Germany, I think you should also look into the burning of the Reichstag.]
[Godwin's law at full effect, ladies and gentleman.]
[False flag operation. Who the fuck draws a swastika the right way, let alone gets the fucking angle correct? Only people who write it often or who are more associated with it. Nazi's & White supremacists.]
[That statement was ridiculous even by conspiracy theory standards.]
[[deleted]]
[Currently on the front page and rising.]
[? This news came out as soon as this article came out. Are you just premptively shitting on the mods?]
[Well would ya look at that! A post in r/politics that ain't blatantly pro-Democrat! Wonder how long this'll last...]
[Five years from now we'll find out this was an inside job to grab more press. Donald is stopping to any level right now]
[I dont care what political party you subscribe to, what you believe, what you stand for. Nobody deserves to have Hillary Clinton as their president.]
["Tolerant" liberals at it again.]
[Maybe they where just following orders to attack the RNC like Trump asked.]
[Must have been. No way it could have been a radical Christian Terrorist or some whackjob Confederate. Give me a break, whoever did this isn't "liberal". They're criminals.]
[Tolerant liberals. They have been the most violent since this election cycle began. Just don't try saying anything on r/politics.]
[There have been violence and vitriol on both sides.]
[> There have been violence and vitriol on both sides. Here's my image album: http://imgur.com/gallery/44jJY Here's a video compilation: www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMux_UHmpvc Please reply with yours.]
[Nobody is going to get in a pissing match with you. We are all familiar with the Trump supporters physically assaulting people at Trump rallies.]
[Your image album and video compilation must be HUGE. With way more examples than mine. Can't wait to see it.]
[Democrats easily have this aspect in the bag when you look at the violence they have been inciting at trump rallies earlier on. Maybe you should call trump supporters the deplorables more and give more moral reason to attack them.]
[Source on that? Because I believe you're completely wrong.]
[Yeah, blame liberals without any evidence. The bastion of reason, right here! /s]
[Leftists are terrorists by nature.]
[I guess those three right wing terrorists that were planning to bomb Somali immigrants the day after the election were an isolated incident then... and the entire long, violent history of right wing domestic terrorism in this country.]
[There are times when political violence is, in my opinion, acceptable. For instance, if an election is cancelled in order for a party or person to maintain power, an argument could be made. This is what, three weeks before election? This unacceptable, and frankly counterproductive to the presumed motives of the assailants. I'm voting Hillary, and hope that she wins (vote people). This is not how you get undecided voters on your side.]
[I expect more of this leading up to the election. I would not be surprised to see a major attack on election day, polling locations will be easy targets.]
[democrat or republican, thats fucked up!]
[OK. First I wanna add the caviot that this is bad. People could have died. But come on this is like the day after those dudes from Kansas wanted to ignite a holy war? The republican candidate for president is, at this point, essentially calling for violence and like 12 republicans denounced him for it. YOU REAP WHAT YOU SOW PAUL RYAN!!]
[I would suspect a false flag operation if the Trump supporters weren't so inept. So fuck you Dems or whoever did that shit. Besides being totally not okay, when you stoop to your foes' level you are forever at their level. Edit: I can see a Trump supporter angry at the GOP for staying as far away from Hair Fuhrer as possible as a possible perp here. If that turns out to be the case then we can talk about the upcoming additional violence we expect from them.]
[Is someone trying to implement the House of Cards strategy?]
[There's an Orange County outside of California??? ]

[Hmm, does anyone know where that twat O'Keefe is??]
[Hey, an /r/politics post not bashing on Trump. How weird.]
[I hope they find and lock all those who are responsible for eternity. # LockThemUp]
[NAACP jumped right on that shit. Just in case distance was needed if...... I think it was a white guy myself. Takes one to know one. Same as a church bomber/burner. The odds are with me I am pretty sure, but frankly I am not a big self stimulator when it comes to this local political crap.]
[Horseshoe theory in action. Fucking disgusting.]
[http://truthfeed.com/viral-video-why-are-hillary-supporters-so-violent/29796/]
[This is the exact opposite of what Trump opposers should be doing. A, it's awful. B, it will make is most dedicated supporters that much angrier... Which is the last thing we need. Disgusting.]
[Yeah but FUCK DRUMPF amirite lol?]
[This election was already bad enough and now people are trying to bomb each other? This country is supposed to be the freest nation on Earth, not this chaotic mess.]
[Good job leaders of the free world. Obviously, this was an isolated case, and not representative of Americans, but for a country that prides itself on being world democratic leaders, this election sure is one hell of a shit show.]
[For the love of god we shouldn't be trying to kill people over US political divides.]
[Liberal here... yes, it's fascism... yes, it will be exploited. Our side would likely exploit it too. Thanks A-hole.]
[Is the graffiti and the bombing related?]
[I'm skeptical. About eight years ago, in San Diego, the GOP HQ in Sorrento Valley was broken into and vandalized. Nothing too destructive, but a lockbox full of cash was stolen. The GOP chief made a big deal about poor security blah blah blah. No one was ever caught, I don't even think there were any suspects arrested. What did happen was that the GOP broke their lease and eventually relocated to an office owned by... The head of the San Diego GOP. The reason I'm skeptical is that... The Dems are winning. This election will probably go Clinton's way. Now... North Carolina is a volatile state. Billionaire Art Pope bought the governor's office and legislature six years ago and his stooge has been ru(I)Ning it ever since. It's not a calm place. But you know what? I'm wondering if the insurance was paid up. This would make a lucrative claim if it really is wanton vandalism. Let's hope the perpetrator is caught.]
[I'm amazed how you Americans are the worlds only remaining super power. I'd have thought you would've torn each other apart by now.]

[If they didn't wanna be attacked they shouldn't have had so much oil...]
[We did once. And it was the best civil war ever! Because we're Americans and the best at everything.]
[If things keep at this rate, the next American Civil War will be fought not between North and South, but between Republicans and Democrats.]
[It would be the two coasts plus some support (like Michigan, Ohio) versus the middle of the country. Middle of the country would either lose quickly, or lose slowly (if heavy force isn't applied early).]
[it wouldnt be a civil war. it would be the end of america.]
[This is some Luke Cage level type of shit.]
[If you've seen [this](https://youtu.be/EMux_UHmpvc) you're not surprised in the least by the firebombing.]
[Which candidate has attacked the leadership of its own party as of today?]
[Will the media hold Hillary Clinton and her campaign accountable for inciting violence with their rhetoric?]
[Do you have any examples of this violence inciting rhetoric of which you speak?]
[Calling republicans racist, deplorable, having surrogates compare them to Nazis and Hitler, all divisive rhetoric which inspires hatred, violence, and discrimination towards Republicans and Trump supporters.]
[Do you think that even remotely compares to the dangerous rhetoric coming out of the Trump camp? They use those terms to describe a subset or Trump supporters not all of them. And if you're honest you have to admit there is a core constituency within Trump supporters that deserve those appellations.]
[And she said all of this when? Seriously, I'm not a big fan of Hillary but holy shit where do you get your information. And also if you don't see the comparisons between Trump's campaign and those who have risen to power and ended as tyrants, man I hope for both of our sakes he doesn't become president for you to see it in action]
[C T R is losing control of this sub. Someone call in reinforcements!]
[I happily downvote anti-Hillary content, but this article isn't partisan. We should all agree, whoever we support, that politically motivated violence is unacceptable in a democracy.]
[Democrats are literally terrorists]
[Liberals sure are tolerant.]
[And Republicans are the bad people.. Democrats need help]
[> “Nazi Republicans get out of town or else” Harsh but fair]
[The "Tolerant" Left and their friend, the Religion of Peace.]
[Nah, everyone knows this was a pathetic false flag attempt by Republicans attempting to garner sympathy.]
[it could be a false flag just to rile up sympathy]
[William of Ockham would like a word with you....]
[My guess is that some Conservative fucknut did it because either 1) the Republicans were not extremist enough for their liking, what with all the conspiracy theories going around about how Paul Ryan leaked the tapes that caused Trump to plummet in the polls. Or 2) they were the conspiratorial fuck nut that thinks in the jargon of "false flag this" and "false flag that", so it makes sense that setting up a "false flag" is their go to option, just like the Republicans who go on about "family values this" and "family values that" are the ones most likely to be found soliciting sex in a bathroom with an underaged teen.]
[It couldn't POSSIBLY be just a bad seed in the democratic party The democrats would never stoop to such a level!! /s]

[Who is "us"? r/politics? r/politics confirmed pro-Hillary bias.]
[Pro-Hillary bias is obvious and it isn't a problem. Most of the people here are Hillary supporters. The primary had a proBernie bias. Nothing really wrong with it.]
[When the subreddit is called "politics", and not "the_Hillary", it actually does present a bit of a problem.]
[Reddit is very clearly a poor site for news the format just isn't built for it. All subs (news, world news, politics, uncensored news, etc) have very blatant biases. It develops from the format.]
[Agreed.]
[This is abhorrent no matter who it targets. We must rise above this and be the shining beacon that we are supposed to be to the rest of the world.]

[We Democrats also don't call them alt-right, we call racists by their real name, racists.]
[Anyone calling this a false flag doesn't know how the it works. The big thing you need to implement a false flag is control of the media. Trump and his camp clearly don't. So they can't drive a narrative as effectively as HRC can. For an examples of false flags look into the staged protests at Trump rallies in the Spring or the attacks on minorities prior to the Brexit.]
[No one said it had to be a particularly bright false flagger (i.e. people worked in that building).. or even a false flag at all. Whoever did this will be charged with arson, a pretty serious offense. That said, I've passed mostly vacant vacation cabins with remote cameras in rural Colorado, motion detectors, ... little red lights to remind you are being watched. Both parties should have their buildings wired similarly IMO.]
[> The big thing you need to implement a false flag is control of the media not exactly, no. false flag is about false attribution, that's it.]
[Fair enough, but without the media it doesn't work.]
[The media is running with this though. I first saw this on MSNBC of all places.]
[In this day and age you can't rule anything out, but I am skeptical of the false flag thing. That's all I'm saying.]
[I'm practically from this town. It has a rural feel but is somewhat populated by liberals from Duke and UNC who want to be further from the triangle cities. There are also many country folks. It's a quiet town and extremely pleasant. One could walk through it in 10 min. It's unfortunate that the people who did this do not understand the irony that modern democrats are as authoritarian as the Bush-era republicans ever were. Peace.]

[I thought this too, but the nazi language honestly makes me think they're too smart to be Trump supporters. I hope I'm wrong about that, but I donno...]
[[deleted]]
[are you serious?]
[I find it kind of hypocritical for so many to be saying "this is awful," when the nature of this entire election cycle has been "shut down opposing opinions through name calling." Isn't this just the logical conclusion to shitting down opposing views? Shouldn't all the leftists be celebrating? Seriously I'm confused how all the people here with such vitriolic hatred for nationalists aren't delighted that someone has carried out the political censorship to its next level. This will only make more people pressured into being silent about dissent against the establishment, which is what everyone on reddit wants, right?]
[Did you just compare name calling on the Internet to setting a fire??]
[Same end goal. Shut down opposing political opinions rather than listen and treat people as adults who can have their own informed opinion be different to yours without assuming they're defective somehow. Obviously it's a more dramatic method of political censorship but the end goal is exactly the same.]
[No it's not "dramatic" fire kills people and terrifies people. Conflating conversation with any form of violence is complete nonsense they are not the same thing. Furthermore only one campaign in this entire election has suggested any actual violence be done against people and we know which campaign that is.]
[Wait... you mean the left right? Because I have only been hearing about people being attacked for wearing MAGA hats... not the other way around. Seriously. People are getting attacked, for wearing pro-Trump clothing. Where the hell do people think it's going to escalate to if not firebombing republican buildings? Or do people just assume that once enough intimidation has been achieved that the right will finally all just disappear and keep their political opinions hidden out of fear like they're supposed to and avoid going and voting like they're meant to?]
[Using violence to stop the next Hitler is wrong. Or maybe the Trump/fascist rhetoric is hyperbole and people don't really mean it. Either one is an interesting conclusion.]
[So I guess violence is OK if Liberal do it?]
[Who the hell said it was okay?]
[Liberals]
[Which liberals.]
[[These Liberals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMux_UHmpvc)]
[Nobody is saying that this is okay]
[Don't attack this guy please... Most people understand the basic flaw of this guy's stance... Let's just let this guy grow old.]
[Did anyone say this was ok? It is reprehensible just as was the armed protesters outside the NAACP/Clinton campaign headquarters in Virginia. Trump's rhetoric has brought us here.]
[Nobody said it's okay, and nobody said liberals did it. Chill the fuck out.]
[No. Violence is unacceptable period. I don't see anyone condoning it.]
[> I don't see anyone condoning it. Scroll up. >"[This is bad] **BUT** [they asked for it] / [Trump provoked it] / [It's an act of defense] / [expect more to come if Trump isn't stopped] / [the firebomber's affiliation doesn't matter] / [definite false flag op] [Well maybe if he didn't act like Hitler...].]
[[expect more to come if Trump isn't stopped] / [the firebomber's affiliation doesn't matter] - These comments are not condoning it. The others are comments by crazy people who should be ignored and are trolling. Far more people are condemning the actions than supporting them.]
[You should look harder then]
[I should clarify...nobody in their right mind.]
[the left are crazier than any rightwinger these days they are BLM turning over cars and shutting down roads - what a weird time]
[Just liberals being liberals. No one should be surprised.]
[So little self awareness that you don't realize that you are exactly what you hate about politics.]
[I don't recall firebombing anyone. Perhaps you know something I dont?]
[Sorry about your guy. Better luck next time.]
[Right. Every liberal I know, including myself, routinely set ablaze various buildings. Its just what we do]
[Just the liberal tendency to violence when coming across differing political beliefs.]
[Peaceful Democrats strike again!]
[Have they caught the perpetrator? Was it confirmed to be a Democrat?]
[But allegations on the flip side are to be assumed as correct, right? 1,000 articles on the front page told me so!]
[I thought we all knew Hillary supporters are violent. Look at YouTube videos and you'll see which candidate has the most violent supporters.]
[Liberals love free speech unless you disagree with them. There have been so many Trump supporters physically assaulted at rallies, signs stolen from private property, and now a fire bombing...and liberals wonder why we're all armed to the teeth.]
[Those things have happened on both sides. At the beginning of Trump rallies they literally have to tell their animals not to harm or touch protesters. I'm sure they do that for no fucking reason at all.]
[It's like 1% to 99%, not even close. There's plenty of videos on youtube that show rabid anti-Trump protestors assaulting Trump supporters while the cops did nothing.]
[Yes, if you cherry pick media to fit your narrative, that's the type of video you're going to primarily find. Good job.]
[You're armed because you're a pussy and you know this, so having a CC permit helps you act out all your beta male "I'm a hero" power fantasies.]
[I am what I eat. I also have a natural right to self-defense that people like you will never take away.]
[Spoken like a true cuck. You'll be drinking cups of Hillary's piss in a couple of weeks. What does that make you?]
[liberals are the new fascists]
[happened in north carolina. http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/16/politics/north-carolina-gop-office-vandalized/ /r/politics removed that post because they're censoring donald trump being a victim stories or something]
[The posts were removed because there were dozens of duplicate threads when this happened. Not everything is a conspiracy.]
[False flag?]
[I sure hope so...]
[Or another group with a bone to pick with the GOP. Could be American liberals, could be Muslim terrorists, could be Trump supporters who are upset at the GOP not supporting their candidate.]
[Although it's tempting to think this, it's also everything we bitch about when the other side does it. We are perfectly capable of creating our own morons.]
[Finally the people are starting to fight back.]
[Oh man, if you're right, I can't wait for this civil war. I'm sure your ilk have tons of guns and ammo sitting around considering how much you love guns.]
[And so the liberals finally admit they are willing to use violence to achieve their goals. Thanks.]
[No, a single right wing troll posing as a liberal posted a comment seemingly supportive of this action and got downvoted to hell. Why don't you try reading all the top comments which are for the most part liberals denouncing this behavior and getting a grip on reality?]
[Most of what I see is liberals blaming Trump supporters for the violence they are now perpetrating, it's disgusting. You all should be ashamed of yourselves.]
[He's also a right-wing troll, just look at his comments.]
[You really want a civil war?]
[Yeah, I don't think terrorism targeting the democratic structure of our society is really the "fighting back" we should be doing]
[They're not democratic so you shouldn't use that word. Maybe you misread who the target was.]
[God you're dense. Democratic party =/= Democratic process. The Republican party is part of our Democratic process. Firebombing Republican party offices is not ok.]
[We support it this the name. Republicans stand against democracy.]
[How exactly?]
[Firebombing buildings due to opposing political opinions is the real threat to democracy.]
[But being tolerant of intolerance is intolerance.]
[...this is the exact type of intolerance and hatred that hurts the country, man. Simply having different views than you is not "standing against democracy". And this is coming from a registered democrat.]
[It is incredibly unacceptable for violence to be committed against any people of any group. With that said, Republicans have been dog whistling what Trump was (((brave))) enough to say in public for YEARS. You do not get to shit on non-male, non-christians, non-hetero, non-white people for decades , then choose orange hitler, then expect nothing to happen. People are sick of it, from Glenn Beck to Rush Limbaugh. From Paul Ryan to Bitch Mcconnell]
[The Tolerant Left strikes again! Their peaceful firebombing of the Republican office just goes to show you where the real hate is coming from, Donald Trump. We need to peacefully heard these deplorables into re-education camps, and the irredeemable ones will just have to be peacefully put down.]
[Literally fueling the Republican's fire. Idiots.]
[Has this been spun as Trump's fault yet?]
[The only one spinning it IS Trump.]
[Hillary and her supporters universally condemned it. Trump went into immediate spin mode. Hmm, interesting.]
[Absolutely disgusting. Will she disavow this behavior? Probably not.]
[She already did Trump didn't though]
[Violence is defined as aggression + power. So if minorities did this then by definition it *is not violence*.!!!!!!]
[In this thread, all the apologists for riots, beatings of Trump supporters, and spray-paintings of cars at Trump rallies, get together to say "Well, we've won thanks to our media's dirty tricks, so NOW it's time to tell everyone to get along!"]

[Bill Ayers coming out of retirement.]
[But but but le drumpf supporters and drumpf are literally nazis!!1! They're violent!!]
[I fully agree this should not be tolerated coming from any side. But just maybe if Trump's hateful and violent messages weren't so absolutely horrifying for people who see absolute parallels between him and the rise of dictatorships and authoritarian governments across the globe, then you wouldn't have this type of reaction. I know its politically correct to say violence is never justified, but this type of reaction is to be expected similarly to how we might expect minority communities to lash out against racial injustice.]

From liberals physically trying to prevent people from listening to conservative speakers to conservative women physically being attacked and then witnesses lying to the cops about it. It's seriously always people left of center who take it to the next level.]
[Tell that to Timothy McVeigh]
[You're not making a very good argument if you have to go back DECADES to find an example.]
[I literally gave you one right wing attack from decades ago and the foiled right wing attack from THIS WEEK. If you're not satisfied can't help you]
[Ah, yes. "The Crusaders". That leading group in conservative ideology. Lovely. Nicely done in deflecting from my main point. How do you guys do that? We're not talking about leftwing violence anymore because you brought up Timothy McVeigh and some anti-Muslim crazy people. Fuck. I wish I had that talent.]
[You asked for examples of right wing violence and I provided. Not sure what you're on about now. I'm going to bed.]
[That's not the point. People always do this. They justify the actions of one side by bringing up past examples from the other. As if that justifies anything. It's pathetic. And now you've gotten away from my original point that most of the violence lately has been done by the left. And it's not violence like blowing up a building. It's a violence that goes completely unpunished. When you physically block people from going to hear a Ben Shapiro or Milo Yiannopoulos talk, that's violence. When you attack Lauren Southern at a free speech rally and then get your buddies to lie to the cops about it, that's violence. When you riot the day a black guy gets shot by a black cop, that's clearly violence. And all of this is coming from people left of center.]
[um what about that jackass who wanted to start a race war in south carolina? what about all the idiots who threaten or actually do attack places like planned parenthood?]
[Ah yeah I guess you've mysteriously not watched his rallies.]
[The false flag attacks begin. This is how they will justify their violence]
[Lol okay Alex Jones! Keep coming up with more conspiracy theories.]
[Just remember the alt right had already planned to attack Muslims after the election. Don't you see how this all fits together?]
[Yes I'll remember something for which there is zero proof or evidence. I'll get right on that. You just remember how all those wikileaks about Hillary's corruption are faked because Russia hates us okay?]
[I doubt much of the wikileaks are fake. They would have been damning if they have been faked]
[/r/violentleft]
[I hope all the fired up dems/leftists see what THIER propaganda is causing. Just like the right is screaming "the muslims and blacks are coming for your families!!" The left is screaming "trump and his neo nazi goons are wanting to ethnically cleanse America!" Your all acting fucking insane and these last two events should serve as a reminder to calm the hell down. It won't, because that's the only sensible action to take]
[Well they are trying to ethnically cleanse America. I'm saying it could have been anyone, but don't automatically ASSume like Trump did.]
[Read the threads from yesterday about the foiled plot. Almost everyone here was jumping to the conclusion trump literally did the act himself. So spare me this nonsense of restraint today.]
[Dems have been calling Trump a dangerous fascist, and act surprised when someone believes them.]
[He is a dangerous fascist, but no idea how that's related to this incident. No one has called for violence (on the left anyway, the right is a different story).]
[> He is a dangerous fascist, but no idea how that's related to this incident. Calling Trump/GOP fascists legitimizes violence against them. >No one has called for violence (on the left anyway, the right is a different story). You haven't seen people on the left defending race riots?]
[> Calling Trump/GOP fascists legitimizes violence against them. No, calling Trump a fascist when he acts like a fascist is in no way, shape, or form legitimizing violence against anyone. >You haven't seen people on the left defending race riots?

[>No, calling Trump a fascist when he acts like a fascist is in no way, shape, or form legitimizing violence against anyone. It's hard to overstate how dangerous a fascist in charge of the US gov't would be. [Good reading on this](https://medium.com/@mtracey/trump-and-the-moral-obligations-of-combating-fascism-36ab686e7e12#.4a53ka7uz). Almost any means necessary to stop that from happening could be justified, up to and including violence. > Please show examples of people on the left calling for violence like the right has done. > http://dailycaller.com/2016/06/06/five-times-vox-encouraged-rioting/]
[> Almost any means necessary to stop that from happening could be justified, up to and including violence. Please point out where specifically people are advocating for violence to stop Trump. >http://dailycaller.com/2016/06/06/five-times-vox-encouraged-rioting/ First, LOL @ Dailycaller. Second, nothing you linked to there is calling for violence.]
[Rioting is violent do you disagree?]
[> Please point out where specifically people are advocating for violence to stop Trump. It's a pretty simple request. I already gave you an example of someone on the right (a fucking sheriff no less) actually advocating for violence. Why is it so hard for you to do that same?]
[I did and you ignored it. Vox advocates for riots, riots are violent, Vox is on the left.]
[Nowhere in that article does it show Vox advocating for violence. There is a world of difference between a reporter explaining the reasoning behind riots, and a law enforcement agent encouraging people to be violent.]
[This is the result of the left and Clinton falsely demonizing half the country as deplorable and painting people with ism's. Really not a lot new here, this type of behavior from the left has been tolerated and even spun to be the fault of Trump supporters by the MSM since trump started his campaign last year.]
[take your pills]
[Who is responsible for this crime? Have they been caught?]
[Pretty good odds its a Clinton created trump hater. It continues a pattern of hatred from the left against trump supporters. There have been countless documented acts of violence for simply wearing a "Make America Great Again" hat. I don't wear the hat in public or put a trump bumper sticker on my car because I fear violence from Clinton supporters.]
[You libs can't advocate for this stuff then act sad when it happens]
[There are violent people on both sides, to act like there isn't is pretty ignoreant. Hopefully this was just done by some crazy person and not by a group. Has anyone been linked to this, well besides from what you're god emporer twitted out?]
[According to this thread the republicans firebombed themselves and the libs are the real victims]
[You reap what you sow.]
[It just seems weird this happens, don't wait for evidence but tweet out that it was Hillary and her Supporters. This election year is insane no one should be afraid to express their political opinions.]
[Search "campaign vandalism" in google news. More then 9 out of 10 stories are about vandalism against the Trump campaign. It's rare and hard to find stories about vandalism against the Clinton campaign. The violence does happen on both sides, but it's predominately from the left.]
[I am not saying it doesn't happen their are a ton of videos out there of supporters being harassed or violence, the list goes on. But this is retrospect to the Don himself tweeting out this was Hillary and her supporters. Supporting a candidate shouldn't incite violence, but to call out Hillary and Democrats without evidence seems to just divide us even further.]
[Damn we should give Chancellor Obama emergency powers]
[This thread is terrible. You are all defending what is equivalent to the modern day Nazi party. Yes, extralegal countermeasures are sometimes necessary.]
[Are you serious?]
[If all you do is speal vitriol, is it really that much of a surprise if people respond to you in kind? All this hate is centered around Trump because he is a hateful man. If he didn't want republicans being attacked, then maybe he shouldn't have promoted blacks and mexicans to be attacked. What goes around comes around.]
[Thats provocateur rhetoric. This was a senseless act.]
[Senseless acts happen every day, egged on by provocateur rhetoric. Any differentiation is completely arbitrary, like saying it's okay this time because he was wearing a brown shirt.]
[This only allows for right opportunism and is clearly an error if committed in earnest. Republicans are fracturing from Trump and in general right now so an attack against the GOP HQ does nothing except work to push them back together. Never interrupt your opponent while they are making a mistake. Considering how desperate his people are getting, all they need is an excuse to get get seriously violent. This is that excuse.]
[And when they do, the fault will fall squarely on Trump's shoulders, where it should be.]
[Red Blue, Left Right, Divide conquer.]
[Looks like trump found away to change the news.]
[Oh boy, now I get to watch hypocritical republicans play the victim and accuse Clinton of inciting violence, totally unaware of the irony that a bunch of those idiots just this week got caught plotting to bomb a fucking apartment complex]

[This is what happens when someone pushes this kind of rhetoric on society.]
[I don't know what is sicker. This stupid barbaric act. Or the thought that I think it is entirely possible some right winger did this to gain sympathy for the cause. Urgg.. I hate this shit.]
[For every person shocked by something Trump says there is one shocked by the lefts vigilante justice. This is why the fascism argument is ineffective. We need to hold both sides accountable for their actions as a whole.]
[Sadly I believe this is the start of more politically motivated violent acts in this country. I am going to be voting by mail this year ( I usually do anyways) because I honestly do not think the polls will be safe spot this go around. I cannot wait till this election cycle concludes, we as society should be embarrassed at ourselves for letting things come to this.]
[This is terrorism and all parties responsible should be hunted down. Edit: To those who down voted this. Let me re-phrase that and say they should be brought to justice. If you still don't agree with that then YOU should be hunted down.]
[This whole election has been such a shit show]
[Its truly amazing how many people mock conspiracies and conspiracy theorist until something happens that makes calling "false flag" or "conspiracy" suddenly benefits *their* narrative.]
[I agree. I hope that at least one side in an election can remain conspirary-loon-free, but it looks like my friends on the left might be abandoning it now. We should condemn and speak out against violence, not look for an out to avoid hard truths]
[(donning alt-right tin hat) it's a false-flag attack from the right ! (un-donning alt-right tin hat)]
[Well thats going to help Trump.]

[You know a lefty liberal did this. You don't get to say whoever did this should be in trouble da da day... You know they represent all of you. They represent your ideals. Your morals. Your principles. You do not get to just call the people that did this a criminal. They are part of your tolerant left. Remember that when you eventually blame trump for this. It was his words that drove these people to do this. You know the left did this. You do not get to vacate blame on this from yourselves. You caused this. Edit: [Baaaaaa](http://www.raisingsheep.net/uploads/1/3/5/3/13538303/6594421.jpg?442)]
[I assume you take responsibility for the 3 guys who were going to kill Muslims who were arrested then?]
[are you claiming responsibility for your actions then?]
[If they are leftists I will say they are pieces of shit who help no one. This should not be about politics, just terrorist who I hope are caught.]
[So all of the violent acts carried out by Trump supporters also represent you, right? I guess I can blame you personally for those three Trump supporters that were going to bomb Somali immigrants the day after the election.]
[> So all of the violent acts carried out by Trump supporters also represent you, right according to you and the MSM.]
[So you're admitting that you're just as corrupt and dishonest as the MSM for saying this?]
[I'm being honest are you?]
[Apparently you're not since you just admitted to using the same tactics as the MSM.]
[You know you're going to blame me regardless of how I answer any pointed question you ask. Be honest.]

[By that logic, do the militiamen who were planning to bomb a building mainly inhabited by Somali immigrants represent your ideals?]
[So is this you claiming responsiblity for your actions? *By that logic?*]
[Claiming responsibility for one's own actions is all any person can I do. I do NOT claim responsibility for terrorist acts committed by people who claim to be on the same side as me. I condemn it, and laugh at the suggestion that they represent my ideals. Answer my question. Do the Kansas terrorists represent your ideals? Or do you condemn their plot?]
[So are all trump supporters racist because some idiots punch/push black people at trump rallies?]
[I blame the overwrought rhetoric of the Clinton campaign and the news media. They have painted Trump and the GOP as Fascists, Racists, agents of Russia. Yeah stuff like that is having an effect. It is a fear based campaign. Because if even half of what they said were true, then using violence against evil fascist racists russian agents would be justifiable. So they need to lay off with their hyped up rhetoric.]
[Exactly, if you legitimately thought a new Hitler was rising, it would be justifiable to try to prevent it by any means necessary.]
[if Clinton wants a war she will get one. do leftists not realize trump supporters have the guns?]
[Do trump thugs not realize they are specs compared to the military of they try and revolt against the democratically elected president]
[The tolerant left.]
[Good]
[I hope you mean just the part where nobody died. Cause the last thing this election needs is (more) actual violence. It is scary enough.]
[it was probably an illegal]
[Peaceful Liberals strikes again. Much Tolerant, Wow progressive. Just like certain religion]
[Who said liberals did this? Why would they - Clinton is demolishing Trump in the polls.]
[Listen Hillary supporters, you're backing the wrong candidate and your selfishness will cause devastating problems for this country. Trump and his supporters are NOT going to go out peacefully if Hillary wins. They'll very likely rise to arms or cause havoc in general over the 8 years of Hillary's Presidency. I personally can't blame them, because Hillary/DNC already robbed me and millions of others of Sanders during the primary by cheating him. Hillary doesn't deserve the nomination to begin with, it should have been Sanders. For the sake of this country you all should abandon Hillary Clinton, who's No-Fly Zone policy will get us into a war with Russia that could easily turn Nuclear. Vote Trump for now and simply replace him with Elizabeth Warren in 2020. Elizabeth Warren will EASILY be able to peacefully defeat Donald Trump and bring over his supporters to her side, instead of insulting them and calling them deplorable and irredeemable the way Hillary did. Don't let this fucking witch queen fuck our country up beyond repair.]
[Your entire philosophy is: - You think Russia is going to nuke America for some reason. The only solution is to surrender to them totally and unconditionally. It's the only way to ensure you won't get hurt. - You think Trump is going to start a civil war if he isn't elected. The only solution is to surrender to him totally and unconditionally. It's the only way to ensure you won't get hurt. You are a sycophant and a coward. Russia is not going to war with the United States, this is not the 60s. And if you think Trump is in any way comparable to Sanders, you don't know anything about Trump or Sanders.]
[Oh, it's worse than that. You see, he is *also* a Trump supporter. He's not just saying we should surrender to Trump because otherwise we might get hurt. He is saying he will be one of the people hurting us if we continue to support Clinton.]
[> NOT going to go out peacefully if Hillary wins i'm armed and ready to return fire. bring it.]
[Don't vote for Hillary because trump supporters are going to shoot people? That's a he'll of a slogan]
[Your whole post is absurd]
[Fuck no trump is far worse and you're deplorable if you think otherwise.]
[That sounds completely sane.]
[if you and bernie sanders were in a room and you showed him that post what do you think he would do/say to you? i dont think any of it would be flattering. Youre as much a bernie supporter as trump supporters are "real americans".]
[Not surprised at all. Given how liberals have acted this election cycle, between liberal protestors turning violent at Republican events and trying to shut them down, taking away their freedom of speech. Hillary literally rigging a primary election to beat Bernie..... When you factor all that abhorrent, inexcusable behavior into the context fire bombing is not a shock. Liberals really are a pathetic, disgusting breed of human beings. Absolute filth.]
[> Liberals really are a pathetic, disgusting breed of human beings. Absolute filth. No they're not. Just stop with the hyperbole and hatred. I can't stand Trump but I know that his supporters are mostly decent people who think they're doing the right thing by supporting him. Snap out it.]
[It's not hyperbole. One candidates supporters have rioted to shutdown free speech, rigged a primary and fire bombed their opponents. That makes them > pathetic, disgusting breed of human beings. Absolute filth. You seem to be mistaking reality for hyperbole.]
[Your statement was that "liberals are a pathetic, disgusting breed of human beings. Absolute filth." You could have extended an olive branch as I did but you doubled down. Do you know many liberals? I don't know any Trump supporters but I am still willing to admit that the majority of them are decent people who's opinions I just happen to disagree with. Which of our attitudes sounds more likely to lead to violence? "I disagree". Or, "disgusting breed of human beings and absolute filth".]
[I agree that political discourse is very low this cycle. However, it doesn't good to lower it further. It actually makes you and those who share your views look good when you rise above the strife and behave respectfully no matter how low the other side is stooping.]

[I don't think you understand that this is news, so it will be upvoted]
[The Democratic Party has yet again officially become a party of violence and terrorism, as they have often been throughout their entire history. They must lose every race from the top of the ticket on down the ballot. Any person who votes for any Democratic Party candidate is endorsing domestic terrorism.]
[what the fuck are you talking about?]
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan#Activities >Klan violence worked to suppress black voting, and campaign seasons were deadly. More than 2,000 persons were killed, wounded and otherwise injured in Louisiana within a few weeks prior to the Presidential election of November 1868. Although St. Landry Parish had a registered Republican majority of 1,071, after the murders, no Republicans voted in the fall elections. White Democrats cast the full vote of the parish for President Grant's opponent. The KKK killed and wounded more than 200 black Republicans, hunting and chasing them through the woods. Thirteen captives were taken from jail and shot; a half-buried pile of 25 bodies was found in the woods. **The KKK made people vote Democratic and gave them certificates of the fact.** >In the April 1868 Georgia gubernatorial election, Columbia County cast 1,222 votes for Republican Rufus Bullock. By the November presidential election, **Klan intimidation led to suppression of the Republican vote** and only one person voted for Ulysses S. Grant. The Democratic Party is the party of the KKK, who engaged in violence and domestic terrorism to scare people into voting for the Democratic Party instead of the Republican Party. Employing the tactics of violence, intimidation, fraud, and terrorism to increase their chances of electoral success has *always* been a mainstay of the Democratic Party. The American people must categorically reject the party of domestic terrorism and refuse to vote for any member of the Democratic Party.]
[Did you miss that bit after the war were the Dems split into two factions then ultimately the southern democracts all switched parties and the northern republicans also switched parties, when the republicans started to employ The Southern Strategy?]
[It's a nice (if self-serving) myth, but it is not true. http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/10/magazine/10Section2b.t-4.html]
[So why then did the colours on the map invert?]
[What, you can't read? >In the postwar era, they note, the South transformed itself from a backward region to an engine of the national economy, giving rise to a sizable new wealthy suburban class. This class, not surprisingly, began to vote for the party that best represented its economic interests: the G.O.P. Working-class whites, however — and here’s the surprise — even those in areas with large black populations, stayed loyal to the Democrats. (This was true until the 90s, when the nation as a whole turned rightward in Congressional voting.)]

[Why are leftists so violent?]
[Obviously a false flag operation, (I've learned to think like a conservative).]
[This might seem evil and violent to some, but I think it's basically justified. When you are evil like Trump, you invite evil back unto you. Anyone who supports Trump deserves everything bad that happens to them and then some. God will judge us righteous in this battle.]
[Better watch it or you might get inadvertently banned from The_Donald. PS: Does the clothes in your laundry hamper smell like gas?]

[? How did you get that from what you see here?]
[I'm not surprised that you missed the connection.]
[Because what you said isn't anywhere in the thread? Pretty sure *everyone* agrees you shouldn't be firebombed by Anarchists just for your political beliefs.]

[But I thought it was only right wing nuts that did this stuff? Wouldn't that be the narrative if this was a dem office?]
[Good. ^^^/s]
[Two thoughts. 1) I obviously agree with what everyone is saying about how abhorrent any type of violent behavior is. I'm surprised no one is mentioning how this is exactly what happens when you preach hate and violence for so long... eventually some people are going to snap. Hatred and violence breed more hatred and violence. The people responsible are very much responsible for their actions, but Trump and the GOP have a responsible hand here as well... in the real world we live in did they think that their "message" would never set someone off? Again, I don't ever think this type of behavior is acceptable and condone it fully, but we need to be honest about all of the pieces in play that made this happen. 2) This reminds me of that scene in [Black Sheep](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115697/)]

I dont think it was a false flag, I am inclined to think it's some kind of fringe group who think this is helping. But you are just spouting useless bullshit.]
[This is absolutely deplorable. Will Hillary Clinton denounce this?! This is what happens when you have a character like Hillary Clinton, who depicts half the country as irredeemable deplorables.

But conflating Dems from the 50s with Dems today is wrong, they are completely different parties. The groups of people they appeal to are wildly different and their bases have changed dramatically. Someone who was a Dem in the 50s would likely not be a Dem today.]
[Same for Republicans. This is not Regan's Republicans. They'd denounce him as a socialist, today.]
[Totally agree. Political parties are always changing and it's pretty inaccurate to conflate them with one another across time. Instead follow changing patterns of conservatism and liberalism]
[Yeah pretty much the same thing.]

[+5% for Trump and conversation on that crime lord Clinton and Wikileaks again.]
[Trump incited the violence that resulted in this. It is NOT the perpetrators fault, only a white powerful male could create this kind of hatred.]
[Or in other words, "Party that treats minorities like they live in the 1950's gets treated like a minority in the 1950s"]
[So that makes it justified?]
[No, I don't advocate violence against anybody for any reason. Ironic? Yes.]
[You should start with that. Otherwise it sounds like you're condoning it.]
[No, but than again, if they truly did it, can you blame them?]
[Yes. Unless you're defending yourself, violence shouldn't be justified.]
[What is self-defense in country where there is a political movement that hates you? Not defending this per se, but just consider that.]
[Honestly don't know what you're asking. If someone swings their fist at you, you're more than entitled to defend yourself. If someone says they hate you, that doesn't mean you have the right to attack them or burn their building down.]
[If nobody was hurt then I call it a win. Take the fascist bastards down.]
[But republicans =\= fascists. Maybe Trump is, but the party at large isn't and this is counter productive since it just lets Trump call for retaliation, which could be so much worse]
[I would argue that the Republican party has become fascist, Trump or no-Trump. Trump is a manifestation of this, not some exception. And Trump might call for retaliation, but he's done it multiple times already. This is that BS anti-protesting rhetoric that came up when a Trump rally got shut down.]
[They just aren't.. idk In what way is mainstream republicans fascist]
[Uber-nationalist, want to control "undesirable" sections of society tightly (war on drugs, pro-police rhetoric), war-mongering, profit over people, etc.]
[Let's not forget the other side is much better armed and already talking about revolution and blood in the streets when their candidate inevitably loses. This isn't a game we want to play. It's better that we focus on peaceful mass action and wait for them to fire the first shots. With sufficient popular support, we should be able to count on most of the military top command, the ATF and the FBI on our side if it comes to fending off an attempted right-wing coup.]
[I really don't think the left should rely on the inherently oppressive forces of that state to stomp out fascists.]
[I'm a leftist, but not an anarchist. The state must someday wither away, but we aren't anywhere near that day. In the meantime, the state can serve as a semi-progressive instrument to stomp out fascism as it has done before.]
[The issue is that the state as it is is not progressive at all. I have no issue with the state, in fact I believe the state is a source of equality and justice. But OUR state is not.]
[This isn't fun to look at, but Hillary's true supporters know that sometimes stuff like this needs to happen for the best candidate to win. I hope no one is proud of this event, but it will be justified if it means helping to get Hillary into the White House. Stronger Together, Hillary 2016!]
[Don't worry guys. Obvious troll is obvious.]
[Lying Trump supporter with pro-Trump post history.]
[Typical r/pol first the condemnations, then Trump did it. Why should Trump be kind about it. CNN and NBC have been calling us Nazis and him Hitler for months. This is on HRC and her claims we're irredeemable unamerican deplorables]
[> CNN and NBC have been calling us Nazis and him Hitler for months. No, they haven't.]
[CNN’s Dana Bash: Trump Like Hitler, Stalin Threatening to Jail Opponent]
[That was 7 days ago, you said they've been calling him those names for **months**.]
[....A cable news channel did not call you a nazi. If they did, I'd love to see the clip.]
[CNN’s Dana Bash: Trump Like Hitler, Stalin Threatening to Jail Opponent when all he said was he wanted a fair prosecutor]
[Trump statement was that he intends to put her in jail. He says it multiple times that Hillary "would be in jail" if he is president. You *literally* cannot deny that those words have come out of his mouth during a debate. So she is making a simple observation. Is it a false observation? Did Hitler and Stalin not jail their political opponents? The reason you feel personally insulted by someone making an observation of Donald is the real issue here. You're a cultist who will support Trump no matter what he says, because you have convinced yourself that he is the messiah that will do exactly everything you hope. Trump's words and position are what you want them to be, so someone saying he acts like a fascist is an insult to you, in your eyes.]
[He said he would hire a special prosecutor. Which he should given that the FBI is in full revolt over comey throwing the case. If she's convicted as most americans think she should be, that's on her]
[Has he not said "If I'm elected she'll be in jail"?]
[This is hilarious. I want to see more chaos. Maximum destruction in America. Bout time this country got fucked good.]
[This is the saddest thing yet I've seen on this sub. I'm so sorry you feel this way.]
[Was wondering when Bernie's communist brown shirts would bring back the Weather Underground tactics. Looks like I was right again. Expect more of this from the same type of crowd.]
[A dozen more attacks and they might catch up to right-wing terrorism.]
[Maybe they finally found that bombshell in Hillary's emails they've been searching for so hard!]
[You think this is funny? (And I mean the firebombing but also your comment)]
[Good. Trumpism should not be accepted and this sends a strong message to racists, sexists, and xenophobes. I wish this were more widespride.]
[So you push them out with acts of terrorism? That's not the way to go man]
[You must have felt so bad ass typing that post in your pajamas before bed.]
[I kinda feel like violence towards hate groups is acceptable. Evil will not disappear by peacefully protesting or using slogans or catch phrases. Evil must be stomped out and extinguished and if you have to fight fire with fire, than so be it.]
[So, if someone disagrees with you then violence is ok.]
[Not at all. Hate groups have traditionally used violence to incite fear and attack blacks and others to send a message that their kind isn't welcome. That sort of freedom of speech is the kind that while allowed by our constitution, shouldn't expect not to be subject to retribution, right or wrong. Hate needs to be eliminated and if it needs to be helped along by a boot in a facists face then so be it.]
[That line of thinking has killed so many people.]
[Yeah it has. In some cases it's killed the wrong people (religious violence for instance). Killing in the name of God is never ok. The last time we've seen a large majority of violence for the right reasons was probably WWII. I don't support state sponsored murder by any means nowadays because wars are no longer fought for freedom but for profit.]
[I don't care if Republicans get hurt. Hillary needs to win this. Anything and everything is justified to win this. Don't judge the people willing to go to great lengths to get Hillary into office.]
[false flag just like the attack]
[Glancing at your pro-Donald history, you forgot the /s tag]
[You are what is wrong with society]
[You're so full of shit. Look at his comment history. No Hillary supporter would say this. One GOP campaign office getting burned doesn't help anyone but Trump.]
[As a Hillary supporter, screw this mindset. No one deserves to get hurt.]
[We will do whatever it takes to get Hillary into office. It's her turn.]
[From a liberal: fuck right off, you don't speak for us.]
[You are a terrible person]
[You're gonna be calling me a patriot once I help get Hillary into the White House and we're all celebrating.]
[A patriot for getting rid of our national sovereignty? Lol 1984 much?]
[Are you stuck in the 1980's? Nationalism is the old days buddy. Hillary is smart enough to realize that the United States will become part of the globalist community and she's going to help lead us there, whether all these stuck in the past "patriots" like it or not.]
[You are literally describing treason.]
[You can call it whatever you want. Hillary has the courts and the law on her side and whatever she does is legal. Just because something used to be treason doesn't mean it's treason now. Hillary is strong enough to change the rules.]
[Bombing your opponents is the opposite of helping someone win a election.... So if this was someone who wants Clinton to win. They are fucking idiots....]
[Absolutely terrifying answer.]
