3 | PBS NewsHour | 10154679710938675_10154679740583675 | Leave your questions here in the comments for John, Daniel and Pamela!
4 | Cristhtian Perez Molina | 10154679710938675_10154679757963675 | Donald's response to Hillary's "puppet" comment was nothing short of a kindergartner's level of intellect. "I know you are, but what am I?"
5 | Caroline Alexander | 10154679710938675_10154679738838675 | What are your feelings as the final debate comes to a close?
6 | Jane Palmiotti | 10154679710938675_10154679762188675 | Donald lost this debate and I am looking forward to President Hillary Clinton...she is the most qualified.
7 | Karina Budd | 10154679710938675_10154679781278675 | Better someone who makes mistakes and owns up to them, then someone who tells us they do no wrong, always pointing finger at others and only they can fix things
8 | Ellen Rothschild | 10154679710938675_10154679771558675 | She's my choice as well as my husbands, all my adult children and their spouses.
9 | Sloane Christopher | 10154679710938675_10154679770898675 | Favorite quote from Vox. "The polls are split between Hillary Clinton winning and … Hillary Clinton winning in a landslide."
10 | Donna Demmin Church | 10154679710938675_10154679745553675 | Comment...'Wouldnt it have been nice if the first female president of the United States was someone we could have trusted and respected?'
11 | Patricia A Lawrence | 10154679710938675_10154679764383675 | Obama is a man of dignity and grace . . . He's also really cool.
12 | Norma Jean Hulen | 10154679710938675_10154679768478675 | I think Hillary won the debate. His answer, "keep you in suspense" about his accepting the election results was like a cliff hanger in a reality TV show. It's scary to think how many people can't see through his ego issues.
13 | Frannie Pagano Mattera | 10154679710938675_10154679793233675 | Abortions at nine months?? You support that? Billions from countries that deform women and kill gays?? Really? Wow, awesome supporters, that's why this country is going to hell
14 | Mobutu Kakata | 10154679710938675_10154679741783675 | Insulting females, hispanics, and not accepting the outcome. Real smart!
15 | Karin Strat | 10154679710938675_10154679772688675 | Rigged election..... I still can't wait to vote .... Nov 28th !!! 💥

17 | Crystal Worley-Roberson | 10154679710938675_10154679756488675 | I was waiting for him to say, "I know I am, but what are you."
18 | Nkulu Maniema | 10154679710938675_10154679822268675 | Hillary won? you must be a criminal and Liar to say that Hillary won Norma Jean Hulen, you belong to the criminal society, and you are a LIAR and do not respect your own family, shame on you.
19 | Debbie Faulkner | 10154679710938675_10154679784358675 | He'll never accept an outcome that isn't for him. e.i. the emmys
20 | Richard Chadwick | 10154679710938675_10154679754653675 | He only has his base. He knows he will lose. Do you think He hopes to appeal to his future TV channel audience?
21 | Denise Pilon | 10154679710938675_10154679774463675 | Keep in suspense= right to waffle, lie and contradict.
22 | Zhanjun Yang | 10154679710938675_10154679757163675 | Hillary won the debate and on many issues, but will her supporters come out and vote on 8th?
23 | Gerry Brown | 10154679710938675_10154679787728675 | If he wins, is the Election still rigged?
24 | Chris Jazwinski | 10154679710938675_10154679786868675 | Hillary haters are over the top restating crazy stuff that has been debunked ovr and over again.
25 | Frannie Pagano Mattera | 10154679710938675_10154679760133675 | She never did anything wrong, she just makes "mistakes" 😂😂😂

When debate moderator Chris Wallace asked Donald Trump if he would accept the 2016 election result, Trump replied 'I'll look at it at the time."

1 | Rosene W. Virgil | 10154679463573675_10154679501413675 | OK.............I attempted to NOT watch the Debate, but I have my Perspective in order Now....A Presidential Candidate of the USA should Always...and I quote (me)..."Compose Yourself in Victory and Graciously be Humble in Defeat"~~~~IJS (Rosene W. Virgil) "I'm with Her"
2 | Kim Dansby | 10154679463573675_10154679496918675 | Chris Wallace did a good job. He called out the BS on the spot!
3 | Jackie Bolton | 10154679463573675_10154679509028675 | Totally unacceptable to attack a basic tenet of our constitutional democracy.  He is disgusting and cares nothing about the country.  His entire life history is always to promote himself, to never apologize, and lie about anything to promote self and put others down.
4 | Robert B. Miller | 10154679463573675_10154679545008675 | I don't know how Hillary or anyone for that matter, can stand there and attempt to respond to this madman who isn't even fit to be on that stage or say a word. He is truly demented.......
5 | Priyanka Bomb Khadiya | 10154679463573675_10154679520943675 | Donald's view of being the commander in chief is, " My way or highway". Classic sign of beginning of a dictator! That's why we can't have him. Period.
6 | Karin Desnoyers | 10154679463573675_10154679566928675 | Somehow he thinks there is going to be a second season to his presidential reality show. Pretty sure his imaginary network cancelled his show tonight.
7 | George Toth | 10154679463573675_10154679512153675 | Donald Trump should probably see a doctor or a psychiatrist to correct his mood disorder. Trump also suffers from a thought disorder that a cognitive psychologist might be able to help. Trump needs help. You could clearly see it tonight. Right???
8 | David Gray | 10154679463573675_10154679635028675 | How does she not laugh herself right odd the stage?  Honestly, I don't know how she has the strength to keep herself from jamming her own pen into her eye for having to be compared to him for the length of the debate.
9 | Deb Chan | 10154679463573675_10154679657678675 | Debate left me feeling disturbed and sickened. He tried to not be "himself" in the beginning but of course lost complete control uttering "nasty woman" into the mic when Clinton was answering a question. I think that moment captures the true spirt of Trump.
10 | Patricia Susan Tyler | 10154679463573675_10154679573403675 | I mean I'm afraid of whoever wins may get hurt while in office and I don't want that for our country or any elected official. I home school and doing current events my 12yr old daughter said; mom this is worse than the Kardashians and their screaming at each other. She said it's embarrassing for the US.
11 | Jinhui Chen | 10154679463573675_10154679511358675 | Copy from Courtney Stratton: Forget the smear campaign on both sides. Here is what we know. on immigration. Trump: Strengthen borders. Stop Syrian refugees until stringent vetting. Clinton: open borders increase Syrian refugees. on economy. Trump: Renegotiate trade deals more favorable to US. Reduce corporate tax policy allowing US companies to bring trillions back to US. Clinton: Keep corporate tax rates in place forcing more companies to seek tax breaks over seas reducing US jobs. Pro NAFTA Pro TPP. on Obamacare. Trump: Repeal and replace failed program. Clinton: Keep in place and tweak problems with program. on ISIS and national security. Trump: aggressively seek out and destroy ISIS. restore law and order to US. Clinton: Work to build more coalitions with NATO and continue failed efforts in place. on Abortion. Trump: Pro life repeal Roe v Wade end late term abortion. Clinton: Pro abortion pushing legislation to allow late term abortion during 3rd trimester. on 2nd amendment. Trump: Protect existing constitutional right to bear arms. Clinton: Push for elimination and radification of 2nd amendment abolishing right to bear arms. on Supreme Court appointees. Trump: Conservative appointees abiding by US constitution. Clinton : Liberal appointees moving toward a more open and accepting inclusive branch of government. on Government spending. Trump: eliminate waste fraud and abuse. reign in government spending. Clinton: Increase government spending by throwing more tax dollars at failed policies. on energy policy. Trump: develop and pursue energy from US companies. increase US consumption from existing clean coal. solar. wind and alternate sources. Clinton: eliminate clean coal pursuing additional energy sources abroad from middle east. on campaign reform. Trump: establish term limits. eliminate super pacs reducing big money from favoritism in government. Clinton: promoting pay for play politics as usual. if you can look through the smoke screen these are important issues every American really needs to weigh in on. Vote 2016 your vote counts!!
12 | Patricia Susan Tyler | 10154679463573675_10154679560473675 | Ok call me dumb for asking this but is there any possible way and I mean possible way somehow neither one of them can be President with how this campaign has gone? I mean it's out of control? Can congress or someone step in? I'm just asking because we have major issues with both.
13 | Lisa Hanson | 10154679463573675_10154679634468675 | I am continuously amazed and disgusted that this "man" is considered a serious candidate for the Presidency of this country.
14 | Gary Roberts | 10154679463573675_10154679837978675 | He has demonstrated time and again that he has NO respect for the Constitution.He is an unregistered sex offender who should be locked up for treason,espionage and fraud.
15 | Mercedes Batista | 10154679463573675_10154679553378675 | The guy keeps saying, I'll do this, I'll do that ....but he doesn't say how .... In spite that Chris Wallace was a pretty good moderator, he couldn't make the dummy to be coherent.
16 | Luke Smith | 10154679463573675_10154679652958675 | DT is willing to throw our democracy under the bus to promote his new TV station and avoid the humiliation of losing. Forget about what Hillary doesn't private and look where he goes out in the open. It took WikiLeaks to catch her being shady. For Donald Trump it took Billy Bush. At least vote for competence.
17 | David Bruck | 10154679463573675_10154679738578675 | What's he going to do?  Raise and Army and stage a coup?  Move his stuff over to the White House and tell everyone he's been elected? Snort another line and plan for 2020?
18 | Katie Connolly | 10154679463573675_10154679821028675 | This man doesn't respect our Constitution or our traditions. He's an angry child, a bully..and if he can't win, he's going to smash everything in sight and walk away. Then again, he probably won't walk far..he's laid the ground-work for his next effort to make a ton of money off American suckers..a new media network.
19 | John Wood | 10154679463573675_10154679813593675 | Trump was absolutely correct. People that accept things before they can evaluate them buy pigs in polls, ...or as Nancy said, "We have to pass this bill so we see what's in it."How's that working out?
20 | Lesley Ross | 10154679463573675_10154679693653675 | Chris is no Mike Wallace but he did a decent job although he didn't corner Trump on a couple of pointed questions when just went off into Trump land and never answered.  Not a surprise there lol
21 | Beverly Couch | 10154679463573675_10154679812218675 | The election will be won by HRC, the Rigger in Chief, Carl Rove is helping her. And of course, why else did she hire DWS for her campaign? It wasn't because she is honest and trustworthy!
22 | Joe Trefelis | 10154679463573675_10154679818083675 | Congratulation trump you won the last 2 debate Hillary the policy vacuum just look at me look at me vote foe me cause am Hillary an my husband had an done something bad in the white house an I never go to jail
23 | Edward StJean | 10154679463573675_10154679554973675 | I believe there is no questions this election is rigged including the media support of Hillary including PBS. I watch PBS and listen to NPR every day and it is sick the one sided spin.
24 | Dona L Dolan | 10154679463573675_10154679519958675 | DT never stfu when Chris Wallace told him to. Hey Donald, NO means NO.
25 | Judy Gillman | 10154679463573675_10154679517683675 | Accepting the will of the people in an election is primary to our democracy. Trump should be disqualified!

Hillary Clinton explains her stance on abortion and why she voted against a ban on late-term, partial-birth abortions as a senator. Donald Trump says he thinks such abortions are terrible. Watch our coverage: http://to.pbs.org/2e2zQtK
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Lisa Kelley | 10154679400073675_10154679437293675 | She is an absolute hero for women's rights. She stated it perfectly. Government has no place in a very personal and intimate decision like this.
2 | Danielle Morfi | 10154679400073675_10154679460403675 | No trump doesn't understand what a late term abortion is. He thinks drs will remove a baby a few days before it's born. And. Kill it? Madness
3 | Karen Erdmann | 10154679400073675_10154679463803675 | the republican candidate knows very little about health care. To say that a doctor would rip a baby from the womb days before it is full term is so bizarre. To accuse doctors of murder is a horrible thing. He clearly does not understand health care.
4 | Kim Dansby | 10154679400073675_10154679437218675 | He thinks that someone is aborting a viable pregnancy at 8 months???? So ridiculous, so completely ill informed.
5 | Linda Jean Adams Brackbill | 10154679400073675_10154679463098675 | Amazing he's so pro-life- he told his girlfriends to get abortions if they got pregnant. Marla refused and so he married her after Tiffany was born.
6 | Sarah Shelton | 10154679400073675_10154679508788675 | Having worked in women's health and perinatology research, that is not how late term abortions are done. There are always very valid reasons for these to be performed and Hillary explained it well.
7 | Fanny Marzanh | 10154679400073675_10154679468503675 | If he feels so bad for babies getting killed for what I feel terrible also. So why does he doesn't agree on Gun control so children don't get killed by guns?
8 | Joseph Wilmarth Tyna | 10154679400073675_10154679445278675 | "We went after Bin Laden while you were doing celebrity Apprentice..." - Hillary
9 | Jan Weller | 10154679400073675_10154679459083675 | And Clinton has taken a note from his book by just talking on, and on, and on in order to defend herself... Why doesn't the mediator stop Drumpf like he does Clinton? Is it because he works for Drumpf's FOX network?
10 | Ric Brown | 10154679400073675_10154679461283675 | Trump thinks 'such abortions are terrible'? What does that mean? Trump's words are heavily salted with descriptive SOUNDING words that actually have little or no meaning in the context that he uses them. He seems to me to be a very superficial person.
11 | Allison Tysinger | 10154679400073675_10154679490248675 | Its strictly a medical decision to be made by a woman, her doctor and her family. Not gynoticians and fundamentalist regressives whose closest knowledge about women's bodies is what they learned from a Trump video.
12 | Edgar Solomon | 10154679400073675_10154679475938675 | Extremely, huge, disaster, always, so many people, Very First time, unprecedented, worst ever, so bad, Wrong, A lot, Bigly.... Sniff, sniff
13 | Lisa Bristol | 10154679400073675_10154679568168675 | You have never been an ER nurse holding these "babies" as they held your fingers while they took there last breath. It's not just a fetus you get rid of. Shame on Hillary. She sits behind a desk and is not in touch with the "real" world. Respect life and all will good things will follow.
14 | Martin Stankard | 10154679400073675_10154679820178675 | I am pretty darn liberal, and I get the argument, nor do I want to imagine the extreme scenarios; but I wish the hardest of hard Feminists could get together and oppose abortions past 6 months or so. I understand the reality is that that is an extremely rare...idk...I'm not an expert, but I do have a nephew who came out about 3.25 months early. I'm not pro Abortion, I am pro choice. Most of the pro-life crowd still wouldn't budge after my idea, but maybe a good few would come on board. Half of the problem related to late term is the lack of access early term...I feel a lot different about how acceptable the process is at 2 months compared to 5.Peace in the middle east, abortion. The issues that absolutely will not be resolved in my lifetime. And I'm pretty optimistic about science. With advances in modern medicine, I could live to be 500 years old. Still a sucker bet these items are still contentious.
15 | Lizabeth Wallin | 10154679400073675_10154679819478675 | I think everyone can agree, late term abortion is horrific. With that said, I don't think a bunch of politicians should decide for me or my daughter or my daughter's daughter what is right or wrong in a medical situation. Just sayin'.
16 | Deirdre Nichols Rasmussen | 10154679400073675_10154679517713675 | I think any discussion about abortion should include the fact that if it is illegal, there will be back-alley abortions and women will die.
17 | Bronwen Walters | 10154679400073675_10154679492918675 | Let's skip this crap - and make Bernie Sanders Speaker of the House! Help elect the Senate and Congressional Democrats on your state's ballot. A Clinton Administration with Bernie Sanders as House Speaker will be a true change!
18 | Dane Hartwell | 10154679400073675_10154679575633675 | Abortion is about the most discusting thing a mother could do. What if a man was too lazy to take care of kids and poisoned a woman so she would have an abortion? I'm sure he would be put in prison for murder. But women use this as birth control. Hillary claims she loves children but supports babies being yank from the womb and thrown in a cold pan to die. I'm pro choice because women can have abortion with wild plants. That's ancient ways. It's dangerous, therefore I'm pro choice. What upsets me is women who support this as if it's as simple as having your dead hair trimmed. It should be viewed as something tragic and to be done if there is no other choice. This should be up to the states to decide. Same with legal drugs and gay marriages. The government shouldn't have so much power over the people. Trump is almost too liberal to be a republican and this is not an issue with him. Now ted cruz is highly pro life. Trump is pro gay and all that. Give the guy a break
19 | Telena Wiggins | 10154679400073675_10154679513493675 | This man knows what late term abortion is.. you all are a bunch of blind sheep. He was a democrat and supported late term abortion when he supported Clinton against Obama. This is all a clown show to ensure Clinton gets in the White House .. I wish they would go on and crown her and get it over with. The US has gone to hell in a hand bag. Reality TV and pop culture has killed the viable brain cells of 95% of the population.. #jillstein never these two corrupt people...
20 | Anita Zona | 10154679400073675_10154679806998675 | Why is it so hard to understand that one can be for or against abortion but that whether or not the government should be involved is a separate issue?
21 | Danny Tan | 10154679400073675_10154679512198675 | Big liar Hillary! Never happened these facts in Romania. Shame on you. You should talk about your country, is not your business to point fingers to others countries and plus is a big lie.
22 | Susan Maloney | 10154679400073675_10154679491473675 | Woman who are in danger while pregnant can be induced and try to save the baby too while saving the woman....no need to mutilate the baby. If the baby dies after its born, at least it wasn't murder
23 | Joanne Lucas | 10154679400073675_10154679478443675 | If a fetus dies before labor. ..nothing can be done until she goes into labor. ..she's carrying a dead fetus to term.  Your wife?
24 | Alison Swihart | 10154679400073675_10154679827823675 | It's hard to see how she can be both pro-abortion and anti-gun.  Both kill.  (Actually abortions kill all the time; guns "can" be an agent of death.)
25 | Jinhui Chen | 10154679400073675_10154679527648675 | Copy from Courtney Stratton: Forget the smear campaign on both sides. Here is what we know. on immigration. Trump: Strengthen borders. Stop Syrian refugees until stringent vetting. Clinton: open borders increase Syrian refugees. on economy. Trump: Renegotiate trade deals more favorable to US. Reduce corporate tax policy allowing US companies to bring trillions back to US. Clinton: Keep corporate tax rates in place forcing more companies to seek tax breaks over seas reducing US jobs. Pro NAFTA Pro TPP. on Obamacare. Trump: Repeal and replace failed program. Clinton: Keep in place and tweak problems with program. on ISIS and national security. Trump: aggressively seek out and destroy ISIS. restore law and order to US. Clinton: Work to build more coalitions with NATO and continue failed efforts in place. on Abortion. Trump: Pro life repeal Roe v Wade end late term abortion. Clinton: Pro abortion pushing legislation to allow late term abortion during 3rd trimester. on 2nd amendment. Trump: Protect existing constitutional right to bear arms. Clinton: Push for elimination and radification of 2nd amendment abolishing right to bear arms. on Supreme Court appointees. Trump: Conservative appointees abiding by US constitution. Clinton : Liberal appointees moving toward a more open and accepting inclusive branch of government. on Government spending. Trump: eliminate waste fraud and abuse. reign in government spending. Clinton: Increase government spending by throwing more tax dollars at failed policies. on energy policy. Trump: develop and pursue energy from US companies. increase US consumption from existing clean coal. solar. wind and alternate sources.

3 | Dave PartyPacifist | 10154679372818675_10154679762068675 | GARY JOHNSON FOR PRESIDENT. NO to TRUMP/CLINTON and their preposterous campaigns and reputations. Dont roll your eyes or give excuses for shameless crooks, their erroneous ways, deceiving facade, alluring words, rhetoric, promises, games, bickering, etc. Dont be that person that's negative, ill informed, mislead, closed minded, foolish.Has the Media polarize yor minds to red/blue, partylines, or him/her? The American people have more than THEIR two choices. We the people, are smarter and more passionate than that. We have grown beyond the affiliations of the past. We deserve real truth, integrity, moderation, options, and common sense. For the freedom given to us by our forebears was not to be confined to just two choices.Brothers and Sisters of the Republic, have hope. You can make history. Let not other countries see us as foolish and stubborn stuck in the same cycle. Think, dont forget the past and repeat it. See past the political dichotomy. Dont think siding with winner/loser, political affiliation but what is best for America, the basic good values. Look deep down inside, Heavens knows rash decisions, closed hearts, and inaction will misguide your perception and choice. There is no great infallible savior to solve everything/issues but only true good principles. The fate of the nation is in your hands.Lets join in to build a better future. For posterity, prosperity, and PEACE. Have courage and strength to tell others. Real issues will only be addressed by a real candidate. Solutions, action,   real concern for the average citizen. The United States needs fitting leadership that truly looks for the American people NOT donors, lobbyists, secret backroom deals, political allianges, special interests. One that has his countrymen and nation at heart. Together we can make it, YOUR VOTE COUNTS!GARY JOHNSON FOR PRESIDENT.

1 | PBS NewsHour | 10154679287423675_916677921771564 | Read our #factcheck of the final presidential debate to.pbs.org/2ek8hNj
2 | Karen Coates-Franchot | 10154679287423675_1657430867880359 | We are doing much better with Obama in the office for eight years thank God I don't want to go back to what the Republicans do to us
3 | Caitlin Crest | 10154679287423675_987802791348294 | She's reasonable, Deborah Cole, because she has made serving this country her life's work - when she's smiling, it's tantamount to how you look at a 3 year old throwing a tantrum.
4 | Maggie Booriak | 10154679287423675_638139356345763 | I have "Obamacare" and they paid for my entire cancer surgery...I am grateful for it and many people need it!Maybe it needs some tweaks....but that's ok, it can change and morph over time.
5 | Marley Bian Macgleth | 10154679287423675_783766485098899 | Donald is worst.. I think he is not Desrving.. I will support CLINTON SHE HAS A GOOD SPEECH AND CLEAR..she Has a good plan though. God bless Clinton
6 | Karen Coates-Franchot | 10154679287423675_2117473068477017 | Republicans are saying that Hillary is crooked and she belongs in prison but our own judicial system has investigated rigorously and found that there is been nothing wrong with her
7 | Heather Coleman Voss | 10154679287423675_503162413212743 | Skilled Trades are desperate for qualified workers. This is my field. He is just absolutely lying. Bring your ties back from China and Mexico Donald, of you are so worried.
8 | James Ellis | 10154679287423675_1820415364913716 | He juist admitted that he will cripple the fairness of the Court by appointing political justices that echo his prejudices?  Not bright.
9 | Marion Visel | 10154679287423675_1365427063490985 | Love Hillary's tone and presence tonight - she's right on, strong, civil and speaks specific instead of Ts rash generalizations and hyperbole.
10 | Mary Mahoney Webb | 10154679287423675_1768148500069632 | He knows all... ya right. He's a shady businessman and whatever he does will be in HIS best interest. He doesn't give a crap about anyone but DONALD!!
11 | Kimberly Allen Sareny | 10154679287423675_1768149433402872 | She's standing up to you Donald, she isn't nasty, she's bold and capable. And we don't care what her husband thinks. Zip it!
12 | Cauanna Gaudio | 10154679287423675_1657436017879844 | Donald Dump has no plan and doesn't know how to solve anything. He's a child that thinks he can "fix" with just promising he will
13 | Nikole Larsson | 10154679287423675_1847650542121917 | Donnie boy doesn't even understand what the constitution is or how it works. He's mistaking the presidents job for a dictatorship.
14 | Jeanna Redman Hoekstra | 10154679287423675_1365432003490491 | Where are his specific ideas of what plans he's going to implement???  He says we're going to have great deals but HOW?  Cutting taxes massively??  He's so arrogant!
15 | Jennica Sherwood | 10154679287423675_503155539880097 | "And she always will be." He acts like a fifth grader. He's an amateur trying to tango with Secretary of State, and he's going to lose.
16 | Russell Dotson | 10154679287423675_1122974537784016 | Social Security should never run out...as long as the politicians leave it alone, and only those that put into it are the only ones who benefit from it. Thta is the way it was first invisioned.
17 | Things that make you go hmmmm. | 10154679287423675_1162632650494768 | Tremendous, political hack, far bigger, great leaders, greatest business people in the world, very much smarter, economic machine ... a lot of generalisations and not a lot of specifics... Hmmmm...
18 | Maggie Booriak | 10154679287423675_605138403001742 | I'm glad Hilary has notes! It means she's done her homework and had substantial things to say...sges not just winging it with rhetoric that means nothing.
19 | Julie Anderson | 10154679287423675_841466645990059 | Um yeah, can someone roll tape and remind him what he said? You have to watch Trevor Noah's clip on Donald's memory issues...hint: it involves a gorilla.
20 | Amanda Chidester Longwell | 10154679287423675_2221925634615401 | He's a moron, if u pull a baby a couple day before typical due date then their is a high likelihood the baby will survive as it is not massively pre term. Duh
21 | Olugboyega Michael Sotubo | 10154679287423675_1616605731973143 | That is not what America is know for....We need to treat our women with respect .....She is more accurate in her response to the questions ask....
22 | Kelley Hurst | 10154679287423675_993235064155081 | All of the experts are WRONG. because he knows everything. That is why he has bankrupted 4 companies on the back of the American people
23 | Kara Farace | 10154679287423675_1049080965209586 | All he does is talk about different countries and he lies about what they have said and feel he is absolutely stupid it's shocking... 10/10 I bet he wouldn't win are you smarter than a 5th grader
24 | Dee Haverly | 10154679287423675_750717548430917 | These 2 are interviewing for the most important job in the country, I cannot take the fingerpointing. Give us some credit and get on with the issues of the country and get over yourselves!!!!
25 | Megan Kinkade Laiacono | 10154679287423675_605133569668892 | Gary Johnson polls higher than these two among millennials, independents and the military. He's polling double digits in swing states. Screw the two party system. #johnsonweld2016

Tonight's debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump is a climatic moment in a bitter campaign headlined by talk of sexual misdeeds and email malfeasance.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Allison Addicott | 10154679093718675_10154679266038675 | It might be related to the climate,  I suppose, and it would be fantastic to hear a discussion about global warming, but I think you intended to say "climactic".
2 | Dee Haverly | 10154679093718675_10154679417288675 | Thank goodness --- this is the last debate.....really, he talks about the news, etc. being curupt???? does he not realize that those who work in the news are American Voters!!!!
3 | Nick Campbell | 10154679093718675_10154679263333675 | I'm glad it's almost over. It's almost time to have to deal with either consequence.That being said... this picture alone says a lot about both of them. Do you really need your own planes? Clintons is paid for by taxes and special interests and Trumps is paid for by avoiding taxes and just being a showboating douche. Look at the difference though. One has a flag... the other, in its shameless grandiose, has no hint at anything related to America. Just his brand. His name. He's all about Trump.
4 | William Isenberg | 10154679093718675_10154679329093675 | There is no way h/c won the majority of votes in the DNC primaries when Sanders rallies had 100 thousand while h/c rallies barely a few hundred. You would take more time and spend more effort to go to a rally as opposed to voting. It flies in the face of common sense that you would get less votes than you had number of people at your rallies when attending a rally would take more effort than voting.
5 | Leif Knutson | 10154679093718675_10154679836213675 | Sexual misdeeds and bald face felonious collusion between actors in power crapping on us poor serfs to maintain their self appointed legacy
6 | Gregory John O'Flaherty | 10154679093718675_10154679372713675 | Why is Bradley Manning insisting on being called Chelsea ?

7 | Camron Bridgford | 10154679093718675_10154679240498675 | PBS Newshour, Trump supporters won't understand what malfeasance means. 7th grade syntax, please.

10 | Tim Wilsdon | 10154679093718675_10154679292848675 | Refuse to vote l home millions refuse to vote for these two Muppet's
11 | Oscar Orlando | 10154679093718675_10154679233208675 | "Trump’s 5-step plan is as follows:First: I am going to institute a 5-year ban on all executive branch officials lobbying the government after they leave government service.Second: I am going to ask Congress to institute its own 5-year ban on lobbying by former members of Congress and their staffs.Third: I am going to expand the definition of lobbyist so we close all the loopholes that former government officials use by labeling themselves consultants and advisors when we all know they are lobbyists.Fourth: I am going to issue a lifetime ban against senior executive branch officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government.Fifth: I am going to ask Congress to pass a campaign finance reform that prevents registered foreign lobbyists from raising money in American elections."
12 | Kasee Kiel | 10154679093718675_10154679241563675 | trump be racist and a bigot. he actually want me to work to take care of my 11 kids or he going to take away my benifits. he goin take away all your benefits if you dont work to take care of youre kids. trump be a racist and a bigot. vote for hillary 2016 this yeer

Tonight is the last time Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump face off on stage before Election Day. What can we expect during the final debate?
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Joie Au Monde | 10154679065833675_10154679277173675 | They say the best defense is a good offense. That is Trump's downfall, he is constantly defensive. I'm glad this is the last debate and cannot wait for this election to finally conclude.
2 | Gareth Fales | 10154679065833675_10154679202198675 | It would be really good if we could hear about issues instead of Trump trying to turn it into a bad fiction show. He appears to have no policy opinions at all, or at best very vague.
3 | Edwards Greg | 10154679065833675_10154679166108675 | Expectations: Big, desperate theatrics from Trump who is well known for his lack of preparedness; and as usual, Clinton will be thoroughly prepared and poised. No wonder she's remembered by her grade school, high school and college classmates as being the hardest-working student.
4 | Gail Bishop-Davis | 10154679065833675_10154679489523675 | David Brooks was correct in his assessment; Mark Shields criticized Hillary Clinton for thoughtful, informative responses about her plans.
5 | Beatrice Salas | 10154679065833675_10154679208213675 | Really does it matter? I have made up my mind... but will watch only because I wanna preview of SNL's next skit. Enjoy the debate folk's ;)
6 | Mary Milling | 10154679065833675_10154679283993675 | Only watching so I can enjoy Gary Johnson's tweets and be informed on his and Weld's post debate discussion on Jimmy Kimmel live. The two candidates debating equally and thoroughly disgust me.
7 | Steven Wiley | 10154679065833675_10154679804518675 | WikiLeaks email drop has exposed Hillary Clinton’s view of small town voters who are worried about the chaos that globalization has caused, the deterioration of the American middleclass, our morality, the economy and our culture… She feels that small town Americans are “insular” and unenlightened, stuck in the past, resistant to progress and that we live lives that are not worth living…. They cling to their god and guns because they are backwards and uneducated…Her strategy of divide and conquer is now morphing into two new groups… The people who matter (City People) and the people who don’t matter (Country and Suburban People).. Having grown up in a small town, and also having lived in the city for the last 25 years I can say that I understand both sides of that coin… City life is fine. It is filled with cultural, social and employment opportunities that do not exist in the country and elsewhere. You can choose how and whether to connect with other people. You also have bustle and anonymity.However, some of us choose to live in a different way… Not wrong but different… It would be a mistake to believe that small town life is a easy peaceful existence. Believe me, living in a small community is not for the faint of heart.Small towns are a microcosm of the human experience, but with more intensity. You live shoulder to shoulder with your oldest friends, and your fiercest enemies. You daily encounter the person who cheated you; who stood you up; who broke your heart; and with people who know your complete history: every bad decision, every embarrassment and you are held accountable for all of your actions. In the big cities, there is a huge amount of anonymity which many people could not thrive without, but not in a small town America. Living in a small town is a psychologically raw way to live… Small town life also requires a deep connection to community that city people may not acquire. It generally means that you go to church because that is what is expected, and what almost everyone does. The church is just as much a meeting place as it is a place of worship… When you go to church your neighbors are there, in many cases your uncles and aunts are there, your cousins and school friends are there, your school teachers are there…. It means you are surrounded by people who know you and care about you… (The closest thing to it in the city is what you would call networking…) In a small town, the network is your neighbors, and you are expected to participate. Your neighbors are the ones who gather around you to celebrate births and mourn deaths. They plow your driveway when you have the flu. They raise money to help in a tragedy. They put an arm around your shoulder. They make casseroles. And you, in turn, celebrate, and mourn, and plow, and comfort, and bake. This sharing and mutual support is as old as human beings. And it is a good way to live.!.We live in a society in which the elites make a continuing push against the values of faith, decency and commonsense. The cultural gatekeepers promulgate the notion that someone who doesn’t live in your community can decide what’s wrong with you, and what you need because you are too ignorant to be able to figure it out for yourself. It’s an insult, and a barely veiled one. You are flyover country: insular, irrelevant bumpkins filled with prejudices, unable to participate in the enlightenment of the cities, destined never to be rich or famous. Living in a small town means that you are aware of the scorn heaped upon you by city dwellers who think they are better than you, and you shrug your shoulders and get on with it.Maybe resisting progress isn’t all bad. In an age of celebrity and reality television, of Instagram and Twitter, most small town people live out quiet, uncelebrated lives of dignity and depth. They work; they raise and care for their families and friends; they mow their lawns, they mop their floors. They may never be rich or famous... But they do have rich-lives worth living.And that is something worth standing for.

9 | Jane Logan | 10154679065833675_10154679214098675 | Trump will sniff his way through the debate while spewing nonsense making a complete fool of himself. After the debate, Trump will simultaneously claim he won the debate and that the debate was rigged... Alec Baldwin will do a perfect impersonation of Trump, the real Trump who has a pathological need for respect will tweet SNL and Baldwin aren't funny. Trump will lose and we can all relax...

As of today Jill Stein is polling at 1% . If you supported Bernie Sanders and everything that he stands for and accomplished we should follow his advice and vote for Hillary Clinton in this election.

16 | Oscar Orlando | 10154679065833675_10154679233538675 | "Trump’s 5-step plan is as follows:First: I am going to institute a 5-year ban on all executive branch officials lobbying the government after they leave government service.Second: I am going to ask Congress to institute its own 5-year ban on lobbying by former members of Congress and their staffs.Third: I am going to expand the definition of lobbyist so we close all the loopholes that former government officials use by labeling themselves consultants and advisors when we all know they are lobbyists.Fourth: I am going to issue a lifetime ban against senior executive branch officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government.Fifth: I am going to ask Congress to pass a campaign finance reform that prevents registered foreign lobbyists from raising money in American elections."

Considering everything she has been involved in during her many years on congress; ex.: Benghazi, the emails, all the lies, formation of Isis, etc. How is it even possible that she can run? Its a joke; a smack in the American peoples' face, really. And,  with her open borders policy, we soon will have multiple UN-safe zones aka, dangerous areas that are similar to exactly what's going on in Europe. But then again since we Americans are all diplorables, why not let this country be the  butt of the jokes.  I would like to hear about Donald's regiment m retirement plan along with bringing mothers back to work. Can we get down to business please. But I must say he has come a long way from his first debate. Much more in control of outbursts. I commend Donald. And its obvious she can't help but keep lying to us. So fake and scam artist!! Talk about it, please!

As the candidates prepare for their final presidential debate in Las Vegas, the race remains close in Nevada, a swing state with a growing Hispanic population that voted twice for Barack Obama.

1 | Carole Mellin | 10154678539623675_10154678682073675 | Trump will have to move to Brazil when this is over (no extradition from Brazil). Illegally dealing with Castro's Cuba, illegally ripping off students of "Trump University", illegally accepting foreign donations to his campaign, illegal use of his "charity" money (his “Foundation” has now been shut down), bringing in illegals to work as “models”, leasing office space to Iranian terrorists...
2 | William Isenberg | 10154678539623675_10154679096988675 | There is no way h/c won the majority of votes in the DNC primaries when Sanders rallies had 100 thousand while h/c rallies barely a few hundred. You would take more time and spend more effort to go to a rally as opposed to voting. It flies in the face of common sense that you would get less votes than you had number of people at your rallies when attending a rally would take more effort than voting.
3 | Bryan McKeon | 10154678539623675_10154678981193675 | A good candidate (like Sanders) would be trouncing Trump. Good job Democrats. You nominated a candidate who can barely defeat him hahaha. I refuse to vote for either of these candidates.
4 | Carol Oliva | 10154678539623675_10154679000963675 | Leaked Fundraising Recordings say, Hillary called Bernie Supporters," Basement Dwellers." Do you really want to vote for someone who thinks so little of you?
5 | Michael Huron | 10154678539623675_10154678982173675 | Per PBS "...a growing Hispanic population that voted twice for Barack Obama" --> probably quite true, being Dim's ... i.e. they voted at least twice in 2012, as did several of the deceased. :p
6 | Dorothy Robey | 10154678539623675_10154678711028675 | Please vote for your chosen candidate in my presidential poll. One vote per person - the system filters out extra votes. I really would like to get a lot of votes so that I can see good, accurate and fair results! Please vote and share! http://www.poll-maker.com/poll850200x2Cd02038-35
7 | John Taylor | 10154678539623675_10154678675633675 | Context...60 years at war somewhere in the world 40 million on food stamps average wage of $42k...few can afford to get sickor retire...One way to make a nation great is to help it confront its shortcomings... Trump has exposed a dilemma that its impossible to remove public officials when much of the evidence is considered CLASSIFIED...interests of the official too closely tied to national security to make doing the RIGHT thing the WRONG thing and this is how a systems integrity ERODES over time..."If the FBI had indicted Clinton, it would have also been forced to open up an investigation into Obama’s role in putting classified information at risk to bad foreign actors. The Obama administration, including Attorney General Loretta Lynch, wasn’t going to allow that to happen."
8 | TJ Frisk | 10154678539623675_10154679006773675 | Vote early and/or absentee if available in your area to avoid the planned intimidation at the polls. Remember blue for POTUS and Congress to end obstructionism and finally get Scalia replaced.
9 | Thomas Earnshaw | 10154678539623675_10154678752878675 | I just saw a post where Trump claims he won the debate.. I think it was rigged..
10 | Christine Didur | 10154678539623675_10154678884478675 | Oh my gosh, I wish they could present floor shows....Ice capades and Trump would have topless show girls on skAtes.
11 | Thayne Wilbur | 10154678539623675_10154679064598675 | Looks like they like things close in Nevada...geesh.
12 | Georgianna Waters Diener | 10154678539623675_10154678685788675 | Hillary will win Nevada ...
13 | Janice Blodgett | 10154678539623675_10154678745943675 | I'm boycotting the debate----Trump doesn't debate---he whines,  he tries to intimidate by bringing in paid--women to sit there---he stalked Hillary last time like a 4 year old who was afraid of letting his mommie out of sight.  YA of course-    I"M WITH HER----- Trump is a sexual predator, he's no gentleman,  he's threatened her life,  , he's  stupid and has cheated many people and we as taxpayers are paying court costs for 3500 people cause he doesn't even pay taxes or contribute to his own security or fire-protection for his property....we who pay -pay his share.
14 | Douglas Nimtz | 10154678539623675_10154678711468675 | The Latino vote will elect Hillary!

22 | Larry St. John | 10154678539623675_10154678788393675 | Hillary's QUALIFICATIONSMishandling classified information.Illegally deleting 30000 emails and destroying computers after being subpoenaed. Violating the records act.  All hidden under quid quo pro dirty politics. Ignoring 600+ requests for support, in the months before Benghazi. Standing over the caskets of four dead Americans, and lie to the faces of their families regarding the details of their deaths.HILLARY is qualified, in silencing women who have accused Bill of sexual harassment/rape over the years, including Linda Tripp, Paula Jones, Kathleen Willey, Juanita Broaddrick and many many more. Hillary is qualified in taking millions from countries like Saudi Arabia, and Yemen who treat women like second class citizens. I don't have time to discuss deplorables, disdain for Israel, Catholics and other Christians, or Hillary's evil support of partial birth abortions. Hillary is qualified for Pay For Play, stealing Millions from Haiti, not protecting Israel, Travelgate, millions made from Wall Street and over 200 million dollars made while "serving us". I would need a year to write about ISIS and the horrible relationship with Russia we now have or her other failures as Secretary of State. No Hillary has lied  and has had to many cover-ups to count.  No  Hillary America deserves better than you.   Trump is far from perfect and definitely an egomaniac with a mouth, but he is nowhere as dirty and corrupt as Hillary.   Wake up folks Hillary is not to be trusted in any way whatsoever.

The number has never been higher, according to a new Gallup poll.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Luke Smith | 10154678488723675_10154678682378675 | If you think your state could use billions in tax revenues and might be better off with more jail space for violent criminals instead of stoners eating Doritos, you're definitely for the legalization of marijuana. PS: don't worry your kids can buy it from your neighbor anyways. At least if it's legal they won't have to go to a drug dealers house for it.
2 | Daphney Waggoner | 10154678488723675_10154678604908675 | Look at who's running for president, no wonder 60% want to legalize Marijuana. We need to be able to have options for the next 4 years. Just saying.
3 | Kim Gifford | 10154678488723675_10154678582578675 | Healing properties and quality medicinal uses. Only hasn't been legalized because govt wants to control who can feel better. Lol. Use don't abuse
4 | Donaldo Morales | 10154678488723675_10154678896568675 | This would be great if the government respected the will of the people, instead of the economic interests of corrupt politicians and police, and of "experts" on the subject who are not authoritues on the matter.
5 | Lynn Rene Hurst | 10154678488723675_10154678664048675 | I asked Michael how many people would drive under the influence if pot was legalized. He said "About the same number as do now." I laughed, he is so up front and to the point.
6 | Mary Milling | 10154678488723675_10154678687593675 | Well, the 60%should take a look at Gary or Jill, the only two candidates courageous enough to have it on their platforms. Hillary has too many well heeled friends making money off of privatized prisons (that her husband so successfully implemented) and Donald, I have no clue what he thinks. I try to not go there if I can help it.
7 | Kimberley Petross | 10154678488723675_10154679427468675 | It's about time we stop letting people die from cancer. I'm tired of loosing loved ones due to the lack of education of so many. "Cannabis has been shown to kill cancer cells in the laboratory. " https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/cam/patient/cannabis-pdq
8 | Mel Gee | 10154678488723675_10154678584748675 | I dont smoke pot, have never tried it in my life. However, I support legalization. The negative effects of legalization are so few while the criminalization of pot leads to devastating effects on so many people, not to mention the lack of regulation and crime that stems from drug cartels
9 | Marcus Seevers | 10154678488723675_10154679527788675 | And yet there has been no questions in any debates asking our presidential nominees where they stand on legalization when during the SAME election our most populist state is voting whether or not to legalize marijuana...smfh
10 | Beau Arnold | 10154678488723675_10154679172733675 | It's the hemp industry that could revolutionize the USA and the main reason for such taboo about a plant. Certain people like to "conserve" things. ;)
11 | Raymond Webber | 10154678488723675_10154678692793675 | Everyone is entitled by the constitution to fry their brains, live in boxes, eat garbage and die alone. That takes them out of the job market. Quit making excuses for assjerks.
12 | Roger Komula | 10154678488723675_10154679043743675 | We have medical in Michigan. It helps with Detroit pain. And anxiety from teabagger legislators that poison kids to make a buck.
13 | Jenn McGrath | 10154678488723675_10154678619093675 | Everyone has an endocannabinoid system. It's time people did some research.
14 | Adam Mercer | 10154678488723675_10154678572448675 | The poll has never been higher...and neither have the respondents!
15 | Billy R. Miller | 10154678488723675_10154678821598675 | Make law's based on logic and reason. Not fear mongering and misinformation.
16 | Tracey Schelmetic | 10154678488723675_10154678652608675 | The other 40 percent are too distracted in their hunt for the Doritos to respond.
17 | Michael Alan Stephens | 10154678488723675_10154678590343675 | Hopefully, they'll legalize it before half of America is in prison.
18 | Poppy Barnard | 10154678488723675_10154678620308675 | Even doctors are recommending it to patients in illegal states the benefits are so obvious..Why is it illegal again?
19 | Angie Howell Caughlin | 10154678488723675_10154678752128675 | That number should be much higher then, since Gallup still uses land lines, lol.
20 | Maria McGowan | 10154678488723675_10154678661473675 | I don't smoke but think it should be legal. Look at Colorado. Seems to be good revenue.
21 | Randolph Graul | 10154678488723675_10154678802053675 | Yes, we can cut the legs off the cartels in this area. They won't stop trying in the other drug areas, but we can close one.
22 | Steve Clark | 10154678488723675_10154678630913675 | The intent is to help those in need of medical assistance - NOT to produce poor quality SYNTHETIC MARIJUANA which is often deadly or harmful...
23 | Kevin Donovan | 10154678488723675_10154678961573675 | Another reason for me to move to Washington when I retire in four years.
24 | Lance Rowe | 10154678488723675_10154679467613675 | And that doesn't even count the segment too paranoid to answer an unknown number
25 | Eric Rust | 10154678488723675_10154679001103675 | Well considering it's less harmful for you than alcohol I'd say it's about time.

The Smithsonian has created a Kickstarter campaign to restore the original ruby slippers worn by Judy Garland in The Wizard of Oz. #KeepThemRuby
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Kate Harrow | 10154678387448675_10154678524723675 | THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS???  For old shoes from a movie? What would brand new shoes cost, and would we know the difference if you didn't tell us?
2 | Karen Dickson | 10154678387448675_10154678570223675 | Also, one of the creepiest movies of all time and the abuse Judy Garland suffered at the hands of the studios don't really make me interested in this. I bet you could go to Target and fake it. No one would know and they're probably about $6.99, if that. Just sayin...
3 | Karen Dickson | 10154678387448675_10154678553393675 | Not such an important issue for me to give money to. In fact, it's pretty far down on my list of priorities. Wait, I checked,  it's not even on my list. Thank heavens. Silly waste of money.
4 | Melanie Weiss | 10154678387448675_10154678597168675 | I'm not saying that these costume shoes aren't worth saving; I am thinking that the timing sucks - children being pulled from rubble, refugees drowning, unemployed people here in the US and childhood hunger a very real problem here. And can someone tell me why: major studios, producers, directors, fashion designers, etc weren't approached? Thirty of them donating $10,000 each would cover it.
5 | Susan Willm | 10154678387448675_10154678655353675 | I heard the price tag on NPR yesterday. Go to Michael's and for $10 you can buy a ton of red sequins, glue those puppies onto the shoes and you're ready to go!
6 | Cheyenne Lin | 10154678387448675_10154678809163675 | it's not the price that bothers me but that if you restore them they might lose their value. some things are meant to be loved and lost. yes the wizard of oz doesn't hold up that well today nor should the abuse Garland faced by the studio be tolerated but the Wizard of Oz shall be remembered as a marker in America cinematic history and not be forgotten.
7 | Ramon Pineda | 10154678387448675_10154678767948675 | The novel is greath piece of Americana but the shoes restoration can be paid by the Movie industry, they keep making the money with reruns so, with just one week of exhibit the movie at the Kennedy Center the 300,000.00 dollars may be available in no time.
8 | Lori Wilson | 10154678387448675_10154678832673675 | I love the ruby slippers. I saw them at the Smithsonian , but I dont think they should spend that kind of money on them, better to feed the hungry or something more pressing like homelessness.
9 | Dave Secrest | 10154678387448675_10154678596313675 | Do they not make enough off the ticket sales they have made all these years, taxes pay for that place, we have to pay to get in. Now we have to pay to save a pair of shoes.
10 | Dawn Cajune | 10154678387448675_10154678541863675 | Last I heard the original one's where stolen from the Judy Garland museum in MN. Unless they found them and didn't hear about it?
11 | Betsy Collins | 10154678387448675_10154678758508675 | Sure would like to see this money go to a really worthy cause: feed hungry children; provide vaccines; enhance schooling in the inner cities, etc.......
12 | Jared Bowden | 10154678387448675_10154679119843675 | They're slippers. How many lives could benefit from this money? Cancer research, AIDS research, education, etc. Slippers? WTF?
13 | Garry W Campbell | 10154678387448675_10154678774013675 | The sign on the displayed shoes says the originals were stolen. These are fake replacements from the Dollar store. Toss em and upgrade to Walmart for two dollars. Problem solved. Next case.
14 | Phyllis Carter | 10154678387448675_10154678548293675 | I don't understand. I believe there were actually four pairs of those red slippers. If they have been in museums, showcases, all these years, how did they become damaged?
15 | Adam Beckett | 10154678387448675_10154678545128675 | Restoring would deny those shoes their historic significance?! Their current state is exactly the way they should look like, imho.
16 | Rhonda Smith | 10154678387448675_10154678537858675 | I'll do it for half the price! I just need red sequins and some glue.
17 | Janet Swift Egiziano | 10154678387448675_10154678716368675 | That's absolutely ridiculous. I bet the shoe repair guy in my neighborhood could do it for less than $250.
18 | Jodi Schupbach Marsh | 10154678387448675_10154678487928675 | I could see if they were from a real life event, but these are nothing more than backstage wardrobe fodder.
19 | Susan Murphy Hacker | 10154678387448675_10154678570418675 | Why so much? Perhaps the restorative company could DONATE their time working on the shoes in exchange for advertising??
20 | Robert Sullivan | 10154678387448675_10154678693128675 | MGM studios should offer pay for the restoration as a donation to the Smithsonian. They sure have made plenty of money over the years from this timeless movie!
21 | Stuart Rinehart | 10154678387448675_10154678942628675 | I know a guy with forty years experience alone in nearby Mitchell who could restore these for less than 200.00.
22 | Helen Child | 10154678387448675_10154678700823675 | $300,000! Are you nuts! Let them go. Take some good pictures and use the money to save the planet from our destruction.
23 | Erika Kane | 10154678387448675_10154678623258675 | So ridiculous. Give that money to charity. 🙄Winters coming, kids need boots, jackets, and mittens.
24 | Sarah DiGioia | 10154678387448675_10154678658063675 | Folks nobody is making anyone donate anything. How some people are replying here, you'd think they were.
25 | Miguel Jurado | 10154678387448675_10154678905663675 | Kickstarter? Really there are better causes out there to ask for donations..

The candidates will take the debate stage Wednesday night for one final primetime showdown. Watch NewsHour's special coverage beginning at 9/8c on PBS.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Karrin W. Willey | 10154678100378675_10154678332248675 | Has anyone explained to what's-his-face that Barack Obama is not running for President & this half brother is not likely to bring black voters running to support Donald?
2 | Charlotte Cross Vann | 10154678100378675_10154678336413675 | I want to hear about three things in this debate:Social securityBalanced budgetForeign policy (especially Russia)What I don't want to hear about (again):1. Benghazi2. Emails3. Trumps treatment of women
3 | Brigid Guarino | 10154678100378675_10154678355433675 | This is so childish,no one will notice him except Trump supporters,he has none of the grace and smarts of his stepbrother, he is probably being paid for appearing.We should be dwelling on todays issues instead.
4 | James Swan | 10154678100378675_10154678293458675 | The whiny racist crybaby pulls third grade move.I,am so impressed.
5 | Mary Perry | 10154678100378675_10154678497573675 | What a juvenile Trump is. Has anyone told him that the reason President Obama does not have a relationship with his 1/2 brother is because Malik belongs to Hamas, hates Israel, has multiple wives and basically stands for everything our President is against. I think this example of adolescent style revenge for Trump will be like spitting out the window when the glass is rolled up!
6 | Stephany Kleinberg | 10154678100378675_10154678294773675 | Hamas supporting Malik? Anti Israel supporting Malik? Is trump out of the anti Semite closet?
7 | Gwen Tinnin Gartman | 10154678100378675_10154678568313675 | I just want a policy debate. Would love it if the rules stated that neither candidate was allowed to refer to the other unless the question directed them to...and a HUGE gong went off if they broke that rule.
8 | Dwana Chapman | 10154678100378675_10154678335043675 | If drumpf thinks it will lube up his followers, he'd dig a dead relative up. This is to pose for his undecided voter's. "Hey look at me I love being in the mud, you're my kind of people. Isn't this exciting, the big soap opera of stupidity, and hate I've created." He's like Jerry Springer, and his fans, but with less class, and intelligence. He knows his demographic, and a large portion watch fox only, and read the national enquire for the rest of their news. He's got them down to a science. Who cares if he's a sexual predator. If he mocks our country, military, minorities, and the handicapped. Who cares how many failed businesses, and lawsuits. He will stop abortion. They actually think he is against it, he flopped when he started running for president, how convenient. This is just more action to disrespect our democracy.
9 | John Shelnut | 10154678100378675_10154678363993675 | The Jerry Springer mudslinging has been entertaining, but does anyone know what their political platform is? Has anyone contested their ideas and visions for America if they became President?
10 | Miguel Moya | 10154678100378675_10154678737033675 | Malik Obama supports Hamas. With this invitation Trump has insulted Israel, a US ally. Malik Obama does not support President Obama, who happens to be a popular president. Using the president's half-brother in this manner will not benefit Trump.
11 | Chris Anderson | 10154678100378675_10154678595568675 | Who cares? He's a foreign national with no stake in this.. another clownish stunt perpetrated by the king of all douchebags. This is almost getting boring, watching orange hitler implode.
12 | David Kirby | 10154678100378675_10154678431958675 | None of these little tricks will rattle Hillary. I can't say the same for Trump when Hillary whips out Triumph and responds to his first allegation with "<insert lie here> to poop on".

14 | Anthony Gelish | 10154678100378675_10154678530468675 | Apparently, in addition to Trumps general ignorance of our constitution, he is unaware President Obama is not running for office. What a laughably untalented stunt.
15 | Luke Smith | 10154678100378675_10154678634963675 | Lol, so that's how he's going to "get tough" with Putin and the Chinese? Throw a tantrum when they embarrass him and show up with their annoying relatives? Is this really happening?
16 | Momo Lititz Oishi | 10154678100378675_10154678521878675 | Trump wants to bring in guests to make it uncomfortable for whoever IS NOT running for the president and somehow he thinks this is the way to get out of prepping for the debate, doesn't he?
17 | Joyce Bunch | 10154678100378675_10154678569378675 | If the Democrats brought everyone that Trump sexual assaulted, cheated in business, scammed or lied to there wouldn't be room in the place.
18 | Paula A. Zancanella Bradford | 10154678100378675_10154678811933675 | Why obamas brother? This is between you and Hillary--not Bill, etc. put on your " big boy" pants and face this strong woman., ( I know it's intimidating, Drumpf)
19 | Joseph Jernigan | 10154678100378675_10154678302983675 | This kind of childish nonsense should be ignored, not reported.
20 | Chris Marsh | 10154678100378675_10154678719298675 | Right out of the script of Godfather 2....when Michael brought in Frankie Pentangeli's brother from Italy to sit in on the proceedings. The difference is....T.Rump IS NO Michael Corleone....
21 | Nancy Lewis | 10154678100378675_10154678859613675 | I' beginning to think the candidates are Bill Clinton and Malik as they seem to be in the spotlight. Anything to get the attention away from the candidate themselves.  How I wish one debate would include what their proposed politices are on the issues facing us.
22 | Thomas Earnshaw | 10154678100378675_10154678535863675 | Trump could only find people from other countries to support him at the debate so This guy is the best he could do.. He is So toxic right now even Republicans won't show public support for him right now..
23 | MJ Beal | 10154678100378675_10154678706278675 | Have read a lot about Malik, who the president doesn't really know and wasn't brought up with. Malik sounds like an opportunistic grifter. I wouldn't trust him....
24 | Dennis G. McAuliffe | 10154678100378675_10154678457293675 | Trump Complete Meltdown 23 minutes into debate. Secret Service rush stage to protect Hilary, restrain trump leading him away as he's yelling, " it's rigged "!
25 | Dean MacDonald | 10154678100378675_10154679019543675 | Just a friendly reminder:  Obama isn't running and won't be there. Hillary wasn't rattled by the presence of Bill's bimbos, so this is just stupid. Trump is swinging blindly, hoping he might land a lucky punch. I've got my popcorn ready.

3 | Benoît Guillette | 10154678036388675_10154678562808675 | Zizek: “First complication: is the crucial choice today really that of liberal democracy versus fundamentalism or its derivations (like modernization versus resistance to it)? The only way to account for the complexity and the strange twists of today's global situation is to insist that the true choice is the one between capitalism and its Other (at this moment represented by marginal currents like the antiglobalization movement); this choice is then accompanied by phenomena which are structurally secondary, crucial among them the inherent tension between capitalism and its own excess. Throughout the twentieth century, the same pattern is clearly discernible: in order to crush its true enemy, capitalism started to play with fire, and mobilized its obscene excess in the guise of Fascism; this excess, however, took on a life of its own, and became so strong that mainstream 'liberal' capitalism had to join forces with its true enemy (Communism) to subdue it. Significantly, the war between capitalism and Communism was a cold one, while the big Hot War was fought against Fascism. And is not the case of the Taliban the same? After their ghost was concocted to fight Communism, they turned into the main enemy. Consequently, even if terrorism burns us all, the US 'war on terrorism' is not our struggle, but a struggle internal to the capitalist universe. The first duty of a progressive intellectual (if this term has any meaning left in it today) is not to fight the enemy's struggles for him.”SLAVOJ ZIZEK, WELCOME TO THE DESERT OF THE REAL!

Facing new challenges to a legacy law, the Obama administration on Wednesday set its goals for the president's final health care sign-up season.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Connie Hansen | 10154677908033675_10154678458803675 | it would help if the other half of the states would expand medicaid and get those people covered. The way it is now, providers charge more to cover nonpaying people. Which is just what was happening before the AHCA. What excuse do those Congressmen give now that they have done nothing to fine tune this good idea? We need to ask that before we vote in the same bunch of Republicans this fall.
2 | William Maxwell | 10154677908033675_10154678122278675 | Obamacare is a complete failure. Only 29% of those signing up are actually paying, mostly at reduced rates. The rest have just signed up for the expanded free Medicaid paid for by the taxpayers
3 | Cheryl Kreiser | 10154677908033675_10154678148348675 | We wouldn't have these problems if the republicans had bothered to try working with President Obama.
4 | John Taylor | 10154677908033675_10154678034833675 | Context...60 years at war somewhere in the world 40 million on food stamps average wage of $42k...few can afford to get sickor retire...One way to make a nation great is to help it confront its shortcomings... Trump has exposed a dilemma that its impossible to remove public officials when much of the evidence is considered CLASSIFIED...interests of the official too closely tied to national security to make doing the RIGHT thing the WRONG thing and this is how a systems integrity ERODES over time..."If the FBI had indicted Clinton, it would have also been forced to open up an investigation into Obama’s role in putting classified information at risk to bad foreign actors. The Obama administration, including Attorney General Loretta Lynch, wasn’t going to allow that to happen."

Fourteen states have election laws that are more restrictive than they were during the last presidential election in 2012.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Jennifer Lynch Wheatley | 10154677709943675_10154677883703675 | Very disappointing - who has to gain fromRestrictive voting laws- GOP  now- lookBack at Jim Crow  - these were aimed at taking votes away fromMinorities and disenfranchised groups- dirty tricks aimed at keeping people from voting. Conservatives will never change...
2 | Mitra Raheb | 10154677709943675_10154677786258675 | It is obsurd to take away ones voting rights because they hadn't voted in 6 yrs. This is the US not some dictatorial nation. Our right to vote is what separates us from many brutal nations. That being said, I think it should be a law to have an ID when voting. That can be however any thing. It can be a license, a police ID, or even a passport. If I want to drive, I need an ID. If I need to take a plan, I need an ID. This is absolutely no difference. So the argument that one does not need an ID is absurd because it is to prevent fraud. The problem here is that both sides are correct in that one needs an ID to vote however one's right cannot be taken away simply because they haven't voted in 6 years.

12 | Steven Wiley | 10154677709943675_10154677808388675 | Hundreds’ of Dead Voters Found Voting in Californiaby JOEL B. POLLAK25 May 2016An investigation by CBS News’ Los Angeles-based affiliate, KCAL-9, has determined that “hundreds” of dead people are still voting in California.“CBS2 compared millions of voting records from the California Secretary of State’s office with death records from the Social Security Administration and found hundreds of so-called dead voters,” according to investigative reporter David Goldstein.“Specifically, 265 in Southern California and a vast majority of them, 215, in Los Angeles County alone.”The voters are genuinely dead, but others are voting in their names, often through vote-by-mail.While it is not clear how the “so-called dead voters” voted, 86 were registered Republicans, and 146 were registered Democrats. Votes have been cast on behalf of some dead individuals for decades, over several election cycles.Their votes diluted the votes of living people, whose choices count less when weighed against votes cast fraudulently.How Pima County is looking to prevent voter fraudKGUN - Tucson, AZThe possibility of voter fraud in Southern California is a particularly acute problem in the run-up to the June 7 California primary, where the presidential campaigns of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton are focused on vote-rich Los Angeles and surrounding areas.Roughly two-thirds of primary ballots are expected to be cast by mail. California does not have a photo ID requirement to vote, and is the only state out of compliance with the Help America Vote Act of 2002, Goldstein says, making voter rolls less accurate.“The problem is California has been the most derelict state in the country in implementing statewide databases that are required under federal law. They just blew it off for over a decade,” former Department of Justice attorney J. Christian Adams told Goldstein.The Obama administration has consistently argued that new laws to improve ballot security and voter transparency, like voter ID, are racist efforts to exclude minorities, and are unnecessary because voter fraud rarely happens.The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors decided Tuesday to launch an investigation into the problem following KCAL-9’s report.

Now, thanks to the “Fight for $15” movement, hundreds of thousands of home care workers in at least five states will gradually receive significant hourly raises. And as result of a large organizing campaign, tens of thousands who have joined unions can negotiate for paid sick time, health and retirement benefits.

1 | Laurie April | 10154677540838675_10154677572188675 | Of coarse it will help seniors! Workers that provide care do a thankless and hard job, they deserve at the very least to be a living wage

6 | Brandon Rumzis | 10154677540838675_10154679095113675 | It'll make home health care more expensive, that's for sure
7 | Eugene E Perales | 10154677540838675_10154679842838675 | Home care is a gift. The people who perform these tasks should be given higher wages.

9 | Tom Johnson | 10154677540838675_10154677661063675 | Having dealt with home care workers for both my mother and mother in law in the past three things come to mind.  First do your homework on who is providing the care.  Second, ensure the help your parent needs is actually being provided and third, compensate the help for a job well done.  We lobbied for home care workers to be paid more and always provided a bonus to those that went above and beyond.   There are all too many fly by night operations springing up these days who just want to make a buck.  As a senior myself, I am all for raising wages for the health care industry.

2 | Linda Spott | 10154677426278675_10154677889738675 | Trump is in desperation mode, as he said: see I have thousands & thousands at my rallies. Unfortunately with your racists & neo-Nazi rhetoric you are not appealing to any new or undecided voters. Only giving people more fear to drive them to Hillary, who has all the substance & platforms for America's future! No one wants Darth Vader or Hitler for the next President! Democracy will rule over a Dictatorship anytime! Your next stop will be Judge Curiel's courtroom to answer for Trump University.

3 | Robin Schmidt | 10154677426278675_10154677949233675 | I find the charge of wide-spread voter fraud to be infuriating. It has also peaked my interest in all those mostly retired men and women who do, in fact, process, organize and generally make sure elections go smoothly and honestly. So today I signed up to get trained to be one of those so-called fraudulent poll workers. Unfortunately, it is too late for this year, but believe me, I'll be there in the future. Watch out, I'm not a senior to be messed with. I rode a freedom bus to the Eastern Shore of Maryland and sat-in at all white restaurants in Baltimore in the early 60's. Nothing can be as scary as that, even in my 70's. Take that Trumpers...

Clinton: Keep in place and tweak problems, raise taxes on program. Trump: aggressively seek out and destroy ISIS. restore law and order to US. Clinton: Work to build more coalitions with NATO and continue failed efforts in place. Trump: Protect existing constitutional right to bear arms. Clinton: Push for elimination of the 2nd amendment, abolishing the right to keep and bear arms. Push for gun bans and ammunition limitations Trump: Conservative Supreme Court appointees who abide by the rule of law and enforce the US constitution. Clinton : Liberal appointees moving toward a more open and accepting inclusive branch of government. One that will destroy America as we know it and turn us into a Nation State such as the failing EU nations controlled by unelected officialsTrump: eliminate waste fraud and abuse in our government. Reign in government spending. Clinton: Increase government spending by throwing more tax dollars at failed policies of the past. Trump: develop and pursue new energy sources from US companies. Increase US consumption from existing clean coal, solar, wind and alternate sources. Clinton: eliminate clean coal pursuing additional energy sources abroad from China and the Middle East. If you can look through the mainstream media’s lies and the establishments smoke screen these are important issues that every American should care about. Vote 2016 … your vote counts!!

11 | William House | 10154677426278675_10154677492073675 | Anyone who doesn't respect the humanity of 12 million immigrants and war refugees is capable of a holocaust, defeat the Republican KKKThose who are Strong Lift people up they do not oppress Humanity like the Republican KKKThe agenda of today's Republican party is DEPLORABLE Homophobia, xenophobia, misogyny, Racism, Oligarchy, dirty energy, culture war, polution,  Poverty, neglect of infrastructure, anti-healthcare, voter disenfranchisement,Trickle-down economicsDefeat the Republican KKK
12 | Connie Mack-Ward | 10154677426278675_10154677546268675 | Why? Makes absolutely no sense in light of Trump's clear attempt to foment violence at polling places.
13 | Christina Glenn | 10154677426278675_10154677591258675 | From the story......"Justice Department officials said they still will dispatch hundreds of staffers to the polls and expect to have them in at least as many states as during the 2012 election.".........If you see something say something. Most of us have phones with video and cameras.......I think everything will be ok. We have clerks in every county that oversee the elections as well as trained poll workers from every party. Don't let the rhetoric scare you. The United States of America IS a great country with free and fair elections. Be proud!
14 | Louise Shurtleff | 10154677426278675_10154677555033675 | However, a large portion of people have cell phones with cameras.
15 | Karen Greenberg | 10154677426278675_10154677696928675 | Sounds like a really bad idea in this particular election. Just unbelievable
16 | David Schneider | 10154677426278675_10154677900208675 | ...and they say the election is not going to be rigged.... hmmm.....
17 | Lichita Ochoa | 10154677426278675_10154677593783675 | Intimidation is another tool that apply only to the weak ones!!!
18 | Dawn Swift-Sadlowski | 10154677426278675_10154677653278675 | Don't worry the Trumpets will be out in force carry their projectiles in hand. God help us
19 | Charlotte Bennett Tressler | 10154677426278675_10154677741743675 | Why don't we all vote by mail?  It would be so much easier.
20 | Virginia Perez | 10154677426278675_10154677495093675 | If you're like me, the sight and sound of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump make you want to vomit. There is a solution, it's called working the electoral college against them both. It's going to take guts. Here is how, if you live in a state that does not require write in registration (Vermont, Wyoming, Oregon, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Iowa, Delaware, and Alabama) you write in Bernie. This will remove those states from the electoral map which makes it easier for a third party candidate to win enough electoral votes with the other states. Everyone else, if your state is mostly blue, vote Jill Stein. If your state is mostly red, vote Gary Johnson. This should swing the majority vote to the third party candidate in most cases. Neither Jill Stein or Gary Johnson are perfect candidates, but Clinton and Trump sure as heck aren't either. But Stein and Johnson are less likely to kill us or get us killed. Like I said it's going to take guts but if we don't try we're weak and we will end up with Trump or Clinton anyway.

22 | Keith Alexander | 10154677426278675_10154677690613675 | "We heard Mr Trump was sending his own, so we figured we could economize."
23 | Loretta O'Brien | 10154677426278675_10154677706708675 | Irma Muela in that case why is GW Bush not in prison? He did exactly that. As did Powell and countless other REPUBLICAN personnel
24 | Amber Ladeira | 10154677426278675_10154677545223675 | But the campaigns and Project Leap, etc., WILL have poll watchers; they have been present at every election I have voted in, including MN and IL.
25 | Rick Kierman | 10154677426278675_10154677791013675 | So...trump tells his armed Brown Shirts to intimidate voters, your answer to have LESS security/observers????/
