So when voting electronically double check to make sure your ballot reads the way you checked it especially for President!Feel free to SHARE!!!
2 | Gary Doan | 10154730907766336_10154730909911336 | I have given Democrats far too much credit in the past. Everyone should realize the press is biased, but most Democrats deny it. I had assumed that some people were either naive or brainwashed, but now I'm starting to believe they appreciate and support our biased corrupt media. There no way bias is not noticeable at this point in time and I'm an deeply ashamed of all Democrats. - An Ex-Democrat.

And I still believe that America has still been predominantly comprised of intelligent people; and they're going to prevail on the election day. Donald I think would have been the better for America; and I strongly believe that even though the rigged and partial media show different polls favoring Hillary, the truth will still prevail; on that very day 8rh November.

4 | Chris Langsenkamp | 10154730779546336_10154730857171336 | Nice gesture and all, but let's get real. Poverty level households get free school lunch already. These are bills for delinquent parents not taking responsibility for their kids and their obligations.
5 | Cindy Bryant | 10154730779546336_10154730837146336 | I did the same recently when I discovered one of my son's friend was starving for a week because she owed monies for lunch. When my son told me about her story, it broke my heart. I made a visit to the school and brought the issue up with the school counselor since I was distraught over it. My son tried sharing his food, but she didn't want to take it. I believe she was embarrassed. When I spoke to the counselor, she said to me our county has a program for kids that need help, and they have established a fund to supplement the children without money. I said to her if the lunch lady says to the little girl "you owe lunch money," how can you expect her to go back to the line for more food? Psychologically, I wouldn't do it either, and I'm adult, imagine a child? She responded with yes, you're right. Long story short, I made sure she was getting fed, and ask my son about it daily. He came back to tell me that his friend said the counselor insisted she gets lunch every day. If my tax dollars had to go to any cause, it would be free lunch for all children in elementary, middle school, and hs. Our kids cannot focus or study with empty stomachs. We need to take care of them.
6 | Karin Green-Duncan | 10154730779546336_10154730883646336 | Ryan David I'm so sick of hearing bout these schools that do this to the kids. Every child should have free lunches at school. If prisoners can have free food, why not our kids. Government keeps making cuts to schools while prisoners have meals, computers, tv's, cable and schooling.
7 | Debbie Mc Atee | 10154730779546336_10154730853626336 | Very nice and such a good thing to do.  It's so hard to believe that in the United States of America with all of the taxes being paid and charities that children would go hungry or homeless when life long politicians, people charged and entrusted with using our tax money to take care our needs like schools, roads, hospitals, etc., are billionaires...how does that happen.  It's sad to turn this wonderful act into something political but his act was needed and so appreciated BECAUSE of politics.  God Bless that man and God Bless America!
8 | Thomas O'Connor | 10154730779546336_10154730867316336 | Most parents and especially kids don't want to look like beggars by requesting a free lunch. I'm not religious, but if you are lucky enough to be able to pay for your children's lunch then do it. And ask your kids if any other of their friends need lunch and pay for theirs. There but for the grace of God goes you and your kids at some time. You will get paid back ten fold down the road.
9 | Val Cardone | 10154730779546336_10154730853536336 | So why don't they give the food to them and when it comes to PTA meeting or any other school meeting bring it up so they can pay the tab. They ARE making enough money for all to pitch in and pay for it. Then take a look at who cut the school funding and not vote for them OR send him/her the bill. Time people wise up and think about these things us the brain God gave you.
10 | Jarrett White | 10154730779546336_10154730834956336 | Im assuming this picture isnt the school in Iowa.  I remember having to eat sloppy joes for school lunch, look at that food pictured there.  Those noodles look awesome.
11 | Deborah Weigel Chaplo | 10154730779546336_10154730854756336 | Wouldn't it be nice if all the high end donors to the political parties especially the democrats donated to and ended our country's starving and homeless children
12 | Lacey Nicole Dunlap | 10154730779546336_10154730819296336 | Bobby Ammons... lets do this. we can just take some cash in and ask the cafeteria workers to distribute as they see needed.
13 | Sally Pizzi | 10154730779546336_10154730837866336 | The parents fill out a free or reduced application, if u qualify, which many indigent families do, u receive a free or reduced lunch. This man did a very thoughtful gesture, where are the parents.
14 | Lynn Bradley | 10154730779546336_10154730827406336 | I wish I had lots of money we'll not crazy rich just where I could help like this . I would help so many people that I could that would be a blessing to help others in need !
15 | Paul Kelly | 10154730779546336_10154730821146336 | Falls close to the category of 'give a man a fish'. At some point, responsibility has to be taken, especially for things as little as this. If parents cannot fulfill even this minimal a duty, how can they even be considered adults?
16 | Martin Quam | 10154730779546336_10154730840906336 | why are school lunches free? this is an old and never ending story, look to schools that work, ours do not !! go to all year round schools free good lunches, bring back PE, this is getting old seeing our school fail and keep doing the same thing over and over thinking it will get better..  BS so easy to fix but no one wants to do it... grow up and do what works change what dont
17 | Charslee Simpson | 10154730779546336_10154730863926336 | Such a nice thing to do, it renews my faith in humanity.  Although I will say that I think school lunches should be provided, no child should be denied lunch at school.
18 | Ed Williams | 10154730779546336_10154730879991336 | nice act of kindness, the state of responsible parenting and providing for one's children has hit a new low in America thanks to the progressives and their institutionalized, anti family, welfare state policies which rewards bad behavior in return for their vote.
19 | Jon Somerfield | 10154730779546336_10154730836331336 | The people who get food stamps get free lunches, its the working people like me that have a hard time paying for school lunch, hell the ones that pay taxes need a break to!
20 | Chris Poulsen | 10154730779546336_10154730824236336 | It seems to me it's rewarding parents for being irresponsible and not paying what they owe. If the kids qualified for a free lunch program, they would be getting a free lunch. I wonder how many of the parents could easily pay for the lunches, if they dropped HBO and Showtime from their cable subscriptions?
21 | Denise Myers Hopper | 10154730779546336_10154730883856336 | With the absolutely ridiculous amount home owners pay for school taxes there should be NO reason a school couldn't afford to feed these kids! If the school officials weren't all making well into the triple digits this wouldn't be happening!
22 | Angelito Pelonsito | 10154730779546336_10154730833261336 | stop welfare, WiC or government aid financial services ...on for kids goin2 school should get free lunch & assistance in their education

24 | Louie Kneitz | 10154730779546336_10154730911896336 | This is really sad. Kids don't get to eat because the can't afford lunch so it takes a person to pay the over due bill? Not saying they shouldn't pay but it is not their fault their parents are scumbag losers who can't keep their dick in their pants and have too many kids
25 | Stella Ford | 10154730779546336_10154730854771336 | Stop dumping billions into illegals and start taking care of our own. And that most certainly includes these children who clearly can't afford lunch.

2 | Tony Tone | 10154730740476336_10154730743881336 | We the People MUST put a stop to this corrupted and broken political system. We the People have a Voice and its Donald Trump. I encourage everyone to get out and vote, not registered then Get registered and Don't go on your own Take family members a Friend or Neighbour get out there and Vote Donald J.

4 | Terry Starchich | 10154730740476336_10154730750836336 | If you haven't realized by now everything that was predicted about Obamacare has come true!  If you want continued failing healthcare vote HC. Otherwise be smart and vote TRUMP!!!
5 | Robin Barron | 10154730740476336_10154730742566336 | Hillary has no policies of her own she is just riding on Obama's coat tails. Hillary is not like Obama because she is acting nasty (Corrupt). Hillary is no friend of woman (or children)! She only uses us for what she can get from us, votes and money. -- For Life. For Faith. For Freedom. Voting my Convictions! #TrumpPence
6 | Deborah Mallette | 10154730740476336_10154730756626336 | And they all laughed at the Republicans when they said this would end up happening. Remember it was a 100% Democrat vote for Obamacare. If youre not getting it free, thank a Democrat for your healthcare fiasco
7 | Sarah Storts | 10154730740476336_10154730747921336 | Middle class can't afford Obama care as it is now!  The cheapest plan for my family of 4 was $700/month with a $15,000 deductible!  I'll pay the fine and out of pocket, thanks.

9 | Albert Coburn | 10154730740476336_10154730745771336 | and that is not all, the punitive fines increases substantially, and the making of your doctor a criminal if you pay him in cash, all after the current president leaves office, and oh yeah, he EXEMPTED himself from this law

15 | Susanne Albino | 10154730740476336_10154730766141336 | This should wake some citizens up.  Obamacare is meant to fail-which it is so it can move to a one payer insurance run by the government.  They do such an outstanding job on every other thing they handle.....

17 | Brigitte Tibet von Bulow | 10154730740476336_1166964923371476 | I read somewhere that Trump said *My employees have tremendous difficulties with Obamacare*. Well, is it not so that Obamacare was put in place for those who have no job, are homeless, are poor?  And oh yes, mr Trump, so *all of my employees are having a tremendous problem with Obamacare*? That means YOU are not paying for their private Insurance, right?  You, Mr Trump, are not paying your employees  enough, it looks like and what is more, you definitely are not paying for their health providers. Dishonest grub you continue to be.
18 | Gail Adie | 10154730740476336_10154730757376336 | Obama has lied about Obamacare since day one. Why should we believe him now? Everything that has been said by those against it has come true. The White House is corrupt and full of lies.
19 | Freddy F. Duarte | 10154730740476336_1198740896838291 | What a disaster!  This was anticipated by everyone but the administration.  To continue obamacare will be catastrophic.  My premiums raised for my family from $800 to $1,700 and will rise again?!  Few options!  Forced or get penalized?  Crazy and not the American way.  Rates will increase for my staff therefore hurting my small business and will inevitably drive down wages for employees.  It's time for a change.  Small government and free enterprise.
20 | Dawn Delmark | 10154730740476336_10154730748441336 | Having one insurance company won't fix the problem.it will make it worse. Just think about it. You could only go to wal mart  period no other choices for groceries or anything. Just a single place. You don't think they would rise prices? No competition why not.. just makes no sense. We need a market and ppl need to have choices.
21 | Sharon Wireman | 10154730740476336_10154730783501336 | But it was "free"..... and people believed it. Obamacare needs to go, it was designed to fail so the government could get control.
22 | Crystal Czeck | 10154730740476336_10154730769836336 | If you aren't flippin burgers at BK full time, you make too much and get smacked in the face with sky-high monthly premiums. This is the worst it's ever been, and it only benefits the lower class and the rich.
23 | Spencer White | 10154730740476336_10154730764231336 | And I hear all these Killary ads with the bum in the white house bragging about how more people have coverage,  but doesn't mention you're forced to have it and pay MORE for it, or get fined and possibly jailed, but yet he's going around letting criminals out of jail.
24 | Sherri Hamilton | 10154730740476336_10154730772446336 | My neighbors, who are close to retirement,  bought into Obamacare. They have had a steady increase since it's conception/their enrollment. Next year, they will be paying $1280.00 A MONTH with a $4000.00 deductible. Where is THIS AFFORDABLE??
25 | Marie Belle | 10154730740476336_1813197632229787 | Well health insurance had become more expensive than monthly car payment especially if you have a family premium and you have to pay the deductible before coverage starts to kick in!!

Yet some subhuman drove a nail through a Westies head and buried it alive, another left a very old GSD bound in duct tape in a pile of trash...both were put to sleep. It goes on and on.

"Unethical, illegal, dirty tricks..."

Rudy Giuliani reacts to the new undercover video claiming to show Democratic operatives discussing Hillary Clinton's involvement in coordinating Donald Duck protests against Donald J. Trump. http://bit.ly/2e5ujBk
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Vicki Tate | 10154730511566336_10154730527061336 | Dear Hillary Supporter, Did you miss the part where she lied to congress? You know that’s called perjury…. Did you miss hearing about her being fired from the Watergate staff for being dishonest and unethical?How about those 33,000 emails she deleted and then had the computer wiped clean by professionals? Did you miss that? How about deleting emails after she was subpoenaed to hand them over to the Fed? You realize that’s Obstruction of Justice, right? Oh, and how about getting the rapist of a teenage girl off on rape charges then laughing about it? Did you miss that too?How about when she lied to the American people about Benghazi? You realize that story about the video was a lie, and she knew it was a lie, right?Did you miss her lying to the American people about her emails? How about when she lied about being under sniper fire?Well, then there was those times she lied about lying to the American people. Miss those too?What about that ‘pay for play’ with the Clinton Cash Foundation? That’s kind of hard to miss, huh?Did you miss all those other scandals she was in? You know… TravelGate, FileGate, WhiteWater, Rose law Firm, Vince Foster… she has a long list of scandals, you know... Did you miss her belittling her husband's sexual harassment ( and rape ) accusers? Oh – but the Paula Jones case was settled for $850,000 and Bill was impeached… for lying…You know she was labeled "Extremely careless" about national security by the FBI, right? Have you caught her latest lies about not knowing what the (C) meant on the classified documents? Or, that she can’t remember any briefings on how to handle classified material? Did you know that during her interview with the FBI she said she couldn’t remember 39 times? Did you know that during the Star Investigation she used that same defense of ‘I don’t recall’ 56 times? Did you hear her say she will raise taxes on the middle class? Did you know she had to return stolen items from the White House the last time they left? Have you seen the movies and several documentaries made about her questionable ethics? Don’t you wonder why she made congress and others spend millions and millions of tax dollars having hearings and investigating her numerous times, finding that she lied, that would not have been spent if she would have simply told the truth in the first place ! Facts - all facts ! But you are going to vote for her because.... you don't like Donald Trump ? Now, That is insane !
2 | Wayne R Johnson | 10154730511566336_10154730525576336 | Trump has been called vicious for using words like Liar, corrupt, careless, nasty etc. to describe Hillary Clinton.Hillary has a 26 year history of broken promises, under the table back stabbing behind the scene deals, cover-up after cover-up, multimillion dollar Clinton foundation operations of Pay for Play, lies to protect lies, embraces hate groups and apparently violence at trump events And they call Trump vicious?This is messed up! Vote Trump/Pence and help Make America Great Again
3 | Melinda Garcia | 10154730511566336_10154730533661336 | I know a handful of people voting for Clinton. I have yet to any Hillary signs, bumper stickers. I've only seen paid protesters for Hillary. Don't trust the polls, get out and vote
4 | John Phillip | 10154730511566336_10154730545641336 | Meanwhile you have Joe Biden saying he wants to take Trump in the back of the gym if they were in high school and you have the left for months saying trump promotes hate and violence. What a joke.
5 | Marc Van Halen Farnham | 10154730511566336_10154730536276336 | 🇺🇸🇺🇸 It's no longer about Republican vs. Democrat.It's all of us Americans vs the Politicians, the media, special interests, lobbyists, foreign countries, Wall Street, the drug companies, hollywood, and the Washington elitist.Never again will we have a chance to take our country back from the globalist agenda they're cramming down our throats, It's now, or never.Please get out and vote, do it for your children & your grandchildren. Stop the Muslim invasion of our country and our way of life. Be true to your country, your values, and your heritage. Vote for the American, not the politician.God Bless.🇺🇸🇺🇸Donald trump
6 | Thelma Bertie | 10154730511566336_10154730520866336 | Donald Trump said the P-word in a private conversation. Bill Clinton shot a load on an intern. You be the judge.If Hillary is elected, America is DONE. We can’t afford illegal immigration. We can’t afford refugees. I’m not racist or bigoted, it’s just too risky at this time. America is struggling enough. Our jobs are being taken away. Our healthcare is too expensive. Mine is $600/month now (AND RISING!). My car insurance is still $29/month (from Insurance Panda), but who knows when our increasingly socialist government will come in and muddle that up? Things are getting more and more expensive as it is. Can we really afford to support the world’s homeless? Trump's private locker room quality discussion as crude as it may have been still didn't get our men killed in Benghazi.
7 | Faith Lynch | 10154730511566336_10154730560756336 | I AM A NATIVE ARKANSAN.  I do not care if Donald Trump called a woman fat. I do not care if he tried to sleep with a woman or if he likes "beautiful" women. I care that he sent a plane to pick up 200 Marines who were stranded after desert storm. I care that he supports our police officers and first responders. I care that he supports guns and standing behind our military. I care that he supports the death penalty and is AGAINST abortion. I care that he supports enforcing immigration laws. I care that he wants to destroy radical Islamic groups. I care that he supports COAL. These are things I care about. Him talking sexually about women does not bother me. Were they mean words? Yes. Were they words spoken in PRIVATE? Yes. Have you ever talked to your friends about the opposite sex in private and said things? I'm positive all of you have. But, News Flash!! Women have been sexualized for centuries!! Jay-Z, Lil' Jon, Lil' Wayne and every single other rapper helped establish that platform, but people are ok with music blasted all over the radio degrading women. Ever heard of Victoria Secret? Or their fashion show? Ever heard of Hooters? People are ok with that too. Until all of these things are different, women will be viewed this way. Your precious Obama couldn't change that and Hillary can't either. I feel sorry for the women Donald has belittled and said terrible things about. But I'm still much more offended by what Hillary Clinton has DONE over what Donald Trump has SAID... PERIOD!!!! So Trump doesn't do well at the debates, maybe he even sounds childish and incapable. But he is speaking the truth! Just because he's not a polished politician like Hilary or Obama doesn't mean he's unqualified to be president. He cares for this country, not growing the size of his pockets. That man has so much money he could never spend it all. He gets NOTHING out of being president! I'm standing for the man accused of saying mean words. I'll never back a woman under three different scandal investigations, possible murder at Benghazi, and the secretive email scandal which has been nothing but lies from the beginning. Trump 2016!!!Feel free to Copy, paste, pass it on #trumpforpresident
8 | Layne Morgan | 10154730511566336_10154730561046336 | Don't let these polls and dirty tricks discourage you from getting out and voting for Trump my fellow Americans. If you let them do anything let them piss you off, and make you more determined than ever to elect a political outsider. Our country needs you to stand strong and rid our political system of this corruption!!   Trump/Pence 2016/2020!!
9 | Laura J Kushto | 10154730511566336_10154730550401336 | Never in my ,69 years have I seen a presidential candidate have so much against her ethically, and the polls are in her favor. Does this mean that that many Americans have no ethics also. I think so, let's give a non political American a chance to turn things around, Mr Trump.  Hillary is not a woman I want in the White House, she is the best we can do.
10 | Sherri Benson | 10154730511566336_10154730545666336 | she is Pathetic .. a slease ball .. and obviously feels the only way to win is to cheat .. she is that person that you dont want on your team . the "so called friend" who stabs you when you turn around
11 | Carol Conley | 10154730511566336_10154730547841336 | Obamacare premiums going up by 25 percent in 2017. 1 in 5 consumers will only have one insurer choice. Hillary has only one plan, to keep it going. Do not vote for Hillary. it's not about Democrat or Republican. It's about what's best for the country. Trump 2016🇺🇸
12 | Oran J. Jones | 10154730511566336_10154730534151336 | Please spread this EVERYWHERE:"On election day, if your voting machine is a SmartMatic brand, DEMAND a paper ballot.

14 | Brian Schwaab | 10154730511566336_10154730555186336 | I don't blame Hillary. She's corrupt and the nation knows it. I do blame those who think this is okay ans vote for her. I get those rich elitist siding with her to keep their cash cow. I get those living off the system voting for her to keep the freebie coming. I get those that want a woman president bur I don't women that woyod want this one to be the first. So her voters are saying America can't do better?  Theres not a woman more honest, dignified and with integrity out there. What I dont get is the hard working and retired older taxpayers who are voting for her higher taxes, sky rocketing healthcare and the increased loss of more jobs and industry under het policies. It's incomprehensible. Sad for our country.
15 | April Partridge Landsiedel | 10154730511566336_10154730693016336 | TRUMP ❗️👍🏼Vote don't let the Dem's steal this election by saying it's over. They want low Republican & Independent turn out. They don't want any Democrats jumping ship!     They even burned one of their own, Bernie Sanders❗️Without even batting an eye❗️She is corrupt❗️Throw the media in with her❗️
16 | Bert Berkowitz | 10154730511566336_10154730550331336 | Just shows what kind of a lowlife campaign Clinton has been running, the sad thing is that this isn't the worst thing Clinton has done,and this is the kind President people want?????
17 | Bob Tackaberry | 10154730511566336_10154730618391336 | Yeah Trump had 25,000 people in St. Augusta yesterday. Tim Kaine had 30 people at his rally. The polls are no longer relevant. They are oversampling Democrats. Podesta Wikileaks email shows how the Dems are telling the networks how to oversample and rig the polling. They are giving the Dems an automatic 10 points!!!
18 | Mary Bepristis | 10154730511566336_10154730550136336 | So here's the REAL story. Amb. Stevens was sent to Benghazi post haste in order to retrieve US made Stinger missiles supplied to Ansar al Sharia without Congressional oversight or permission. Hillary brokered the deal through Stevens and a private arms dealer named Marc Turi. Then some of the shoulder fired missiles ended up in Afghanistan used against our own military. It was July 25th, 2012 when a Chinook helicopter was taken down by one of our own Stingers, but the idiot Taliban didn't arm the missile and the Chinook didn't explode, but had to land anyway. An ordnance team recovered the serial number off the missile which led back to a cache of Stingers being kept in Qatar by the CIA. Obama and Hillary were now in full panic mode and Stevens was sent in to retrieve the rest of the Stingers. This was a "do-or-die" mission, which explains the stand down orders given to multiple commando teams. It was the State Dept, not the CIA that supplied them to our sworn enemies, because Petraeus wouldn't supply these deadly weapons due to their potential use on commercial aircraft. Then, Obama threw Gen. Petraeus under the bus after he refused to testify that he OK'd the BS talking points about a spontaneous uprising due to a Youtube video. Obama and Hillary committed treason...and THIS is what the investigation is all about, why she had a private server, (in order to delete the digital evidence), and why Obama, two weeks after the attack, told the UN that the attack was because of a Youtube video, even though everyone knew it was not. Further...the Taliban knew that this administration aided and abetted the enemy without Congressional approval when Boehner created the Select Cmte, and the Taliban began pushing the Obama Administration for the release of 5 Taliban Generals. Bowe Bergdahl was just a pawn...everyone KNEW he was a traitor. So we have a traitor as POTUS that is not only corrupt, but compromised...and a woman that is a serial liar, perjured herself multiple times at the Hearing whom is running for POTUS. Only the Dems, with their hands out, palms up, will support her. Perhaps this is why no military aircraft was called in...because the administration knew our enemies had Stingers.Copied and pasted...and pasted again and again and again until everyone reads this truth.... share
19 | Louis Elias | 10154730511566336_10154730565051336 | We the People MUST put a stop to this corrupted and broken political system. We the People have a Voice and its Donald Trump.

21 | Judy Kay Cullison | 10154730511566336_10154730527071336 | why will no one go after her besides Trey Gowdey. The Federal Election Commission needs to get on her. If this was the other way around, Trump would be behind bars.
22 | Marsha Taylor-Trimmer | 10154730511566336_10154730554256336 | It just goes on and on yet people still believe her and will vote for her. Nobody seems to care that once they are dead and gone their kids and grandkids will reap what she does to our country.
23 | William Garcia | 10154730511566336_10154730566906336 | Our country Will Not Survive if Hiliary is allowed to steal this election. Folks, please think of your children, extended family & friends. We as a nation & a people have arrived at a time of choosing unlike any other of our lifetimes. If you choose to stay home, vote 3rd party or vote for Hiliary, you will be destroying any chance of our country's survival. I'm not asking you to vote for Donald Trump the man, I am begging you to vote for Donald Trump & Mike Pence' vision to save our beloved America and it's sovereignty. You need only look to Europe to see our future if Hiliary gains the White House. Open borders & Globalism is NOT the answer. A vote for Trump - Pence, and what they represent, will be the best gift / legacy you can give your children and your children's children. I beg you, please stand and be counted. VOTE ! ......... M

25 | Jim Princeton | 10154730511566336_779865858820227 | This was in a post. A socialist state by Hillary:''' ...Hillary Clinton did her college thesis on....How to create a social state by Saul Alinsky:There are 8 levels of control that must be obtained before you are able to create a social state.The first is the most important.1) Healthcare — Control healthcare and you control the people2) Poverty — Increase the Poverty level as high as possible, poor people are easier to control and will not fight back if you are providing everything for them to live.3) Debt — Increase the debt to an unsustainable level. That way you are able to increase taxes, and this will produce more poverty.4) Gun Control — Remove the ability to defend themselves from the Government. That way you are able to create a police state.5) Welfare — Take control of every aspect of their lives (Food, Housing, and Income).6) Education — Take control of what people read and listen to — take control of what children learn in school.7) Religion — Remove the belief in the God from the Government and schools.8) Class Warfare — Divide the people into the wealthy and the poor. This will cause more discontent and it will be easier to take (Tax) the wealthy with the support of the poor.This is amazingly why this country is fighting each other!

They were pro Trump and getting everyone in the intersection to honk, scream out the window, give the thumbs up, etc. IT WAS GREAT!!  Florida y'all....we LOVE him here.
2 | Tommy Gregory | 10154730401301336_10154730437826336 | Some voters have noticed that when they do straight party ticket electronic vote every office is marked EXCEPT for president! So when voting electronically double check to make sure your ballot reads the way you checked it especially for President!Feel free to SHARE!!!
3 | Dan Campanelli | 10154730401301336_10154730457031336 | I've seen this man around the neighborhood. He is a gentleman if you ever talk to him. Freedom of Speech, folks. Get used to it. Took a lot of guts to do this in a heavily democratic town
4 | Vicki Tate | 10154730401301336_10154730448696336 | POINTS TO PONDER BEFORE ELECTION DAY :If you are Gay, why are you voting for Hillary? She wants to bring in hundreds of thousands of refugees (hundreds of thousands of them muslim) that believe all Gays (who massacred 50 gays at a Florida night club?) should be executed.If you are Black, why are you voting for Hillary? She admires Margaret Sanger and defends Planned Parenthood. They want to abort as many black babies as possible. "Exterminate the Black Race because they are like weeds." Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.If you are a Christian, why are you voting for Hillary Clinton? She wrote her Senior Thesis on Saul Alinsky. He dedicated his book "Rules for Radicals" to Lucifer, The Devil? She says he was and still is her mentor.If you are a Veteran, in the military, or closely related to a military member, why are you voting for Hillary? She left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again. They called for help but the help was told to stand down.If you have a factory job, why are you voting for Hillary? She supported TPP. Factory workers are being laid off because jobs are going overseas. Don't forget the deals she made with China. She also welcomes open borders and for illegals to get benefits with YOUR tax money.If you are poor, why are you voting for Hillary? She is supporting Wall street and all the big banks. Big banks keep the poor, poor by destroying the poor man's credit by allowing medical bills and collections to affect your credit scores so you can pay higher interest rates than the rich. - Taking as much of the little money you earn.If you are a woman, how can you vote for Hillary? She has buried all of Bill's rape victims under the rug. Remember the little girl that was raped? She defended the rapist and laughed about it later.If you carry a gun, and believe in the Constitution, how can you vote for Hillary? She wants to eliminate the NRA, take your guns, and abolish the second amendment.If you breathe, why would you vote for Hillary? She has left a trail of dead people that did not agree with her or knew too much!Who is left?
5 | Wayne R Johnson | 10154730401301336_10154730439151336 | Trump has been called vicious for using words like Liar, corrupt, careless, nasty etc. to describe Hillary Clinton.Hillary has a 26 year history of broken promises, under the table back stabbing behind the scene deals, cover-up after cover-up, multimillion dollar Clinton foundation operations of Pay for Play, lies to protect lies, embraces hate groups and apparently violence at trump events And they call Trump vicious?This is messed up! Vote Trump/Pence and help Make America Great Again
6 | Carleen DeLozier | 10154730401301336_10154730452191336 | I was driving in Hilton, NY and saw a humungus Hillary for Prison sign in someones front yard, I should of stopped and posted it! Go Trump!

12 | Annie Bloom Herold | 10154730401301336_990326907780352 | I think there are Trump supporters than people think. I'm in Maryland an extremly democratic state. Although I do see Trump signes around, I don't have one because of the vandalism by the Clinton supporters. I'd love to at least have a bumper sticker but can't risk my care being keyed.
13 | Chris Baugh | 10154730401301336_10154730452906336 | Yet trump is a liar and a racist,and a sexist pig,and a con-man.I'm not a Hillary Clinton supporter I'm antitrust.Hillary Clinton didn't murder anybody you morons.I could use that same idiotic logic against George W Bush with 9/11 and the Iraq War..smfh at the ignorance of the trump supporters..😂😂
14 | Dana Lo | 10154730401301336_977356232375960 | watch those counters when you vote , and use your cell phone to take a picture of voting machine screens etc people!!!!gonna be more democrat fraud this year then ever recorded in history!
15 | Lois Dunlap | 10154730401301336_990316341114742 | It's amazing to me just how big of idiots we have in this country, they talk about trump being a groper but yet it hasn't been proven, unlike Bill Clinton who has been proven to be a liar and a sexual predator and thief's and yet these morons want them back in the white house REALLY. Also this man's yard in NY is hilarious, might scare the little munchkins
16 | Margaret Falletti Koegler | 10154730401301336_10154730494386336 | A quote from someone I would like to shareDear Hillary Supporter, Did you miss the part where she lied to congress? You know that’s called perjury…. Did you miss hearing about her being fired from the Watergate staff for being dishonest and unethical?How about those 33,000 emails she deleted and then had the computer wiped clean by professionals? Did you miss that? How about deleting emails after she was subpoenaed to hand them over to the Fed? You realize that’s Obstruction of Justice, right? Oh, and how about getting the rapist of a teenage girl off on rape charges then laughing about it? Did you miss that too?How about when she lied to the American people about Benghazi? You realize that story about the video was a lie, and she knew it was a lie, right?Did you miss her lying to the American people about her emails? How about when she lied about being under sniper fire?Well, then there was those times she lied about lying to the American people. Miss those too?What about that ‘pay for play’ with the Clinton Cash Foundation? That’s kind of hard to miss, huh?Did you miss all those other scandals she was in? You know… TravelGate, FileGate, WhiteWater, Rose law Firm, Vince Foster… she has a long list of scandals, you know... Did you miss her belittling her husband's sexual harassment ( and rape ) accusers? Oh – but the Paula Jones case was settled for $850,000 and Bill was impeached… for lying…You know she was labeled "Extremely careless" about national security by the FBI, right? Have you caught her latest lies about not knowing what the (C) meant on the classified documents? Or, that she can’t remember any briefings on how to handle classified material? Did you know that during her interview with the FBI she said she couldn’t remember 39 times? Did you know that during the Star Investigation she used that same defense of ‘I don’t recall’ 56 times? Did you hear her say she will raise taxes on the middle class? Did you know she had to return stolen items from the White House the last time they left? Have you seen the movies and several documentaries made about her questionable ethics? Don’t you wonder why she made congress and others spend millions and millions of tax dollars having hearings and investigating her numerous times, finding that she lied, that would not have been spent if she would have simply told the truth in the first place ! Facts - all facts ! But you are going to vote for her because.... you don't like Donald Trump ? Now, That is insane !
17 | Melissa Mastrianni | 10154730401301336_10154730445876336 | You know what, that's all well and good, but there are widespread reports of early voter fraud right now, where people are reporting seeing their votes changed from Trump to Shillary! So if you see this, call your states voter fraud number and raise hell! Take a photo of your vote! Demand that you get your rightful vote!

18 | Bob Tackaberry | 10154730401301336_577656755756272 | Yeah Trump had 25,000 people in St. Augusta yesterday. Tim Kaine had 30 people at his rally. The polls are no longer relevant. They are oversampling Democrats. Podesta Wikileaks email shows how the Dems are telling the networks how to oversample and rig the polling. They are giving the Dems an automatic 10 points!!!
19 | Gail Gallifant Collins | 10154730401301336_10154730484816336 | Geez, and I'm afraid to brandish a bumper sticker when folks key cars or cover them in peanut butter for people thinking differently.
20 | Joan Bentivegna | 10154730401301336_10154730450111336 | Trump honestly has the true Patriot American plan and what America was founded on, principles, values, and love of country. He will take America away from open border globalization and back to being an AMERICA by of and FOR the PEOPLE!!!!!!! How could anyone NOT want THAT!???? I really don't get liberals. I really don't.
21 | Dolores Kloper | 10154730401301336_977351972376386 | TO ALL AMERICANS - PLEASE WAKE UP AND SMELL THE ROSES. Whether you like TRUMP or not, he is the only viable candidate. If you want all of the above to happen, the lost of 5 amendments to the Constitution that we all learned about in school and everything else she wants to do to put this country into the ground for her benefit only ( REMEMBER, SHE LIVES ON OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY), we have to work hard for ours, then HILLARY is your girl. If you want the opposite, to save all our rights and freedom, more jobs, getting better and cheaper health insurance (UNLESS YOU WANT TO PAY REALLY HIGH PREMIUMS), a strong military should we ever need it, keeping the refugees out of this country (otherwise you will find them right in YOUR OWN BACKYARD), childcare for all working women (who make up 40% of the workforce), taking care of vets instead of illegals, securing our borders, keeping drugs out of the country and away from your kids and so on and so forth. HILLARY is against all of this, she is the opposite of what we need. THIS IS TOO IMPORTANT AN ELECTION. If you have elderly family members, friends, neighbors who would otherwise have no way of getting to the polls in November, please drive them. If you can, maybe hire a bus for your neighborhood to take all those people. WE NEED ALL THE VOTES WE CAN GET. It's your PICK come NOVEMBER.
22 | Joanne Sherman | 10154730401301336_1611813169120952 | "This is some one else's post! Thought I would share it! "VOTERS BEWARE: I voted a straight party ticket this morning. Before pressing the cast ballot button, I scanned to make sure all I had voted for appeared in the final list. All did EXCEPT my choice for President. I called the helper and she was puzzled. The judge came and she was also puzzled. I had to go back to page 1, indicate straight party ticket and then scroll down to my Presidential candidate and click on that name. After that, the final ballot appeared as I wanted and then I cast my ballot.My advice: Double check your ballot before you press the final cast ballot button." Came from a voter in the Houston area... No dems are complaining...pay attention people...voter fraud is out en force! We are getting record numbers of voters this year...Texas is a red state so most are repubs! "Please share this everywhere!!!!!
23 | Natasha Sparks | 10154730401301336_977414255703491 | The fact that the man taking the video says, "People have way to much time on their hands!" Is more disturbing to me than the guy decorating his yard! If more people took the time to educate themselves as to the truth, and stopped allowing everyone else to make their political decisions, maybe just maybe we wouldn't have a bunch of greedy, lying, criminals running this country!! In my opinion, its time well spent!
24 | Beth Setters Breland | 10154730401301336_10154730495171336 | Instead of haunted, they should call it "House of Horrors!!!". (Oh, wait...obama is already doing that at the White House. Nevermind). ;)
25 | Larry McLendon | 10154730401301336_977365112375072 | I hope all mothers voting for Hillary realize they can NEVER tell their child to always be honest and tell the truth. As soon as you vote for Hillary , you give up that right. IF push your child for the truth, I hope your child, his or her friends, take the 5th  like Hillary, and her whole entourage have done to the American people. Also try to remember putting Bonnie and Clyde in the white house, you are also putting a rapist in our white house. We've had a Muslim for 8 years, and he, like Hillary, lies to you on a daily basis also.

She checked before she submitted and the vote had changed to Clinton! She reported it and made sure her vote was changed back. They commented that It had been happening. She is trying to get the word out and asked that we post and share. Just want everyone's vote to be accurate and count. Check your vote before you submit!

4 | Chris Williams | 10154728455836336_10154730440596336 | If a Chimpanzee was recording Bob Creamer, and Scott Foval admitting to fraud it would still be legitimate. To say that the project veritas footage is not legitimate because of the guy recording it, is ludicrous.
5 | Kathy Arnold | 10154728455836336_10154730429306336 | The Lord planned that I see this today so I could softened my hardened and angry heart that politics has challenged me this past year. THIS is what life is about and I pray we can retrieve some compassion once again..
6 | Chris Williams | 10154728455836336_10154730435746336 | There's no better evidence than a recording of somebody admitting to criminal activity. If that's not good enough to arrest the entire DNC staff then nothing is.
7 | Chris Williams | 10154728455836336_10154730425386336 | The Project Veritas tapes are legitimate, the camera doesn't lie. The Democrats are going to attack the legitimacy of James O'Keeffe because that's all they have. Proving that James O'Keeffe was arrested in the past doesn't change what Bob Creamer said.
8 | David Weikle | 10154728455836336_10154730468501336 | Reminds us all of Trump Groping a random woman...Trump will LOSE BIG the biggest largest greatest ever defeat in a presidential election, then the GROPER will claim it's rigged, BWAAHHHHH TO YOU Trumpf
9 | Lisa Fox | 10154728455836336_10154730885586336 | Mao also suggested that he could rip up voter registration forms and get away with it too, saying, “If I rip up completed VR forms, like 20 of them, I think I’ll just get reprimanded. I don’t think I would get fired.”Project Veritas wanted to see how the Hillary Clinton staffers would react to ripped up VR forms, so a PV journalist said he ripped up three Republican registration forms.Upon hearing this, Trevor Lafauci a Clinton campaign staffer said, “Yeah that should be fine,” and he said he would not report it.

1 | Anne Cramer | 10154728508801336_10154730259076336 | Sounds like she had a rocky relationship with her mother...Otherwise she would not have cared...but they should also remember that this tragedy also happened to her too. Just because you get married and start your own family doesnt mean that your mother is no longer an important part of your life.
2 | Joan Bonfiglio-Harding | 10154728508801336_10154730304981336 | Sad they are trying to cash in on her death. Maybe both should move on and just honor her memory another way. Movies, books...ugh. Maybe a non profit or something like that would be better.
3 | Julie Betts Piskula | 10154728508801336_10154730303901336 | She may have wished her husband only tell her story, but it is the right of her mother to write this book. And since Maynard was all about rights, she would have understood her mother's right to tell the story of her daughter's life and death.
4 | Barbara Conrad Culhane | 10154728508801336_10154730260741336 | Her mother knows her more then a short time marriage..this ylung women had brain cancer ..which is maybe why this statement may have been made to her short term marriage..the husband can only speak of the last couple of years of her life..really with a story from a mother would be more since she was there from the moment she took her first breath of life to her last..sorry husband cannot even cover why and how the early years of her life may have come into play to her decision to ending her life..
5 | Erin Matheny | 10154728508801336_10154730300731336 | I think there is more to her story than what her husband will reveal and her mother knows it. When you read her different interviews and research GBM she was told a lot of false information. Her doctor scared her into suicide and for all we know to push his own agenda to have medically assisted suicide passed. (Die with dignity as they called it) I wonder if the husband is not being paid to keep the story to make it sound like she wasn't pushed into it. My husband is battling the exact same brain tumor at age 31, and there are several therapies, trials, and break throughs out there. There are survivors that make it past the 14month average just because they are younger than 45! Genetic testing of the tumor determines the best course of action to treat it and immunotherapy is in its final stages of trial. There is HOPE but her doctor made her feel like she had none.
6 | Crystal Payne | 10154728508801336_10154730353141336 | Her husband has movie rights and is set to be the executive producer.... Pshhhh. That is why he doesn't want this book released. Whatever
7 | Jennifer Fowler Stringer | 10154728508801336_10154730403676336 | Seems to me Maynard was selfish to the end. This is not just her story, it's the story of everyone who shared her life and walked her path with her. She appears to have been a control freak, controlling not only her death but trying to control what is said about it afterwards. A person's suicide affects a mother more than anyone and the mom has a right to tell her story.
8 | Susan Habiger | 10154728508801336_10154730452726336 | As much as I love my mother, she doesn't know me as a woman, she only knows the daughter. My husband knows me better than any other person on this planet, inside and out. He knows the whole me with no exceptions. I disagree with her mother writing a book at this time. Her story of her daughter is not the story her daughter wanted told and that should be/have been respected.
9 | Hedy Fragosso | 10154728508801336_10154730323391336 | The husband should be able to tell the story of his wife but the mother can write her own book with her own feelings. Since the movie is about what the husband knows that is the story of the wife. I'm sure the mother has many different stories of her own to tell. Money and truths can be there for both.
10 | Shannon Britton | 10154728508801336_10154730370261336 | She had a brain tumor and on multiple meds, anything she said could be subject to a judges decision. Her mother gave birth to her & was by her side as she died, the husband is probably dating already..& needs some money
11 | Tina Menard | 10154728508801336_10154730278991336 | God Bless.  Life is precious in the womb and our in life's ending moments.  Both loved her and neither should be fighting over story of her life.  Both shared it, if the husband and mother loved her, they would either respect the young woman's wishes or work together.  In the end, ill feelings will not bring her back and is not a memorial of her life.
12 | Keith Mikell | 10154728508801336_10154730233171336 | Her mom is out to get paid and that's terrible. If she follows through and makes it happen, she will pay dearly. No amount of money will make up for the wrath that she will have to deal with.
13 | Natalie Davis | 10154728508801336_10154730415826336 | It seems like the husband is fabricating this "statement by his wife" that she wished for only him to tell her story. He knows if his mother in law publishes a book about the story it will steal his thunder and potentially ruin his opportunity to cash in on book and movie deals. Just seems strange that this woman who has such a supportive loving family would focus energy at the end of her life to write a statement banning her mother from talking about her experience. Doesn't add up
14 | Melissa Rae Biot | 10154728508801336_10154730401216336 | Honoring her deceased daughter's wish is the right ting to do. She was specific about her wishes and her mother is blatantly ignoring them. Show some respect, Mom.
15 | Gail Adie | 10154728508801336_10154730358856336 | I'm a mother....... but I know that whomever my daughter marries will know her in ways I never will. A more intimate way. I think the mother knew this and did this because she was upset that her daughter trusted her husband more then her.
16 | Ragnheiður Arna Magnusdottir | 10154728508801336_10154730310956336 | You are a disgusting mom if you don't respect your daughter last wish! I dont care she was her mom blablabla....she asked her husband to tell the story not the mom! Respect that!
17 | Tammy J. Correia | 10154728508801336_10154730339731336 | She was her mother! Point blank, end of discussion. Her views on her daughter are her views and she is entitled to share her perspective!
18 | Kara Doss Bridgers | 10154728508801336_10154730354831336 | The sad thing is, is that they are both profiting from her death.  He's just upset that the mother did it first.  Also, how do any of us know that she told her husband that she wanted only him to tell her story? That could be completely made up by him; no one will know because she isn't here anymore.
19 | Judi Tricka Blight | 10154728508801336_10154730414041336 | If he wanted to "cash in" then her story would have been told by him already.....maybe he's just respecting her wishes, and her mother is not.  Not everyone has a wonderful relationship with their mom, maybe that's why Brittany didn't want her to tell her story
20 | Shannon Hayes Abel | 10154728508801336_10154730390001336 | I think this young woman was very courageous. Telling her story in the manner she chose in order to help influence right to die legislation is a beautiful legacy. If she wants her husband to do that for her, then her wishes should be honored. I can't believe her mom would go against her like that. It's shameful.As much as I love my mom and am grateful for her presence in my life, my husband knows me in ways she never will. He is the keeper of my deepest, most personal thoughts and feelings, and he is who I share every day of my adult life with. My story would best be told by him.
21 | Virginia Outlaw | 10154728508801336_10154730406546336 | This sweet girl went through something I wouldn't wish on anyone. I'm sure both her mother and husband loved her and suffered with her.  Neither should be denied the chance to write this woman's story.  I would believe because one is the mom, the other a spouse, two unique perspectives on her life would be wonderful reads.
22 | Jennifer Thompson | 10154728508801336_10154730580316336 | I've seen several people state in comments that they've read in other articles on how he has paperwork from an attorney to prove it. In every article I have read, I haven't seen it. I honestly agree with a lot of other people. They are doing it for profit but unless this supposed "proof" is shared, only then can it change anyone's minds.
23 | Jennifer Barrett | 10154728508801336_10154730342251336 | It's the The Land of the free (barely). No one can keep another from writing about their experience of something. Her mother should have been respectful of her wishes but, that was her choice.
24 | Jillian Matthews | 10154728508801336_10154730357301336 | You can't just automatically side with mom and make him the bad guy. There are some truly selfish and messed up parents in the world.  Just because her mother knew her longer or gave her life means nothing. I know first hand about selfish screwed up, manipulative, calculated and vindictive mothers, so I know better than to immediately side with mom. The truth will eventually come out until then don't demonize him unless you have all the facts.
25 | Christine Walker | 10154728508801336_10154730677406336 | I do not think the daughter can dictate from the grave.    She may have wanted her story told by her husband and that is fine, but she cannot say mom couldn't write about her own experience.   She should have written it herself since she planned everything else.

UC Berkeley students are calling for “safe spaces” for transgendered people, as well as “spaces of color” at the University.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Deric Smith | 10154728490521336_10154730131781336 | When do us normal people that don't need all the attention get a safe space?
2 | Fred Poesel | 10154728490521336_10154730135511336 | why are college campuses trying to segregate people? lol i swear society is retarded.....
3 | Gina Dierickx | 10154728490521336_10154730141746336 | Grow up! Good GOD! Really ? This is what America has become? Remember when 18 year old kids were drafted to fight for our country? Now we have little dipshits running around needing safe spaces? The world is not going to be easy on you but every single individual can CHOOSE to find happiness and purpose. Quit your crying and get on with your life... We all have to!
4 | Donovan Williams | 10154728490521336_10154730135136336 | so, they are calling for segregation again? I am pretty sure Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. would have a strong opinion about that.
5 | Billy Erwin Cowan Wooton | 10154728490521336_10154730141136336 | There used to be "spaces of color" ... they were called segregated areas and  had designations like: "coloreds only" and "whites only" and they were established and enforced by laws called "Jim Crow."There was this whole event that lasted from the 1950s into the 70s in which people worked together to get rid of these spaces...I forgot what that movement was called...civil, something?
6 | Roger Kinnison | 10154728490521336_10154730138021336 | The University should start snapping pictures and suspending any student that disrupts another students ability to study or move freely around the campus.
7 | Gill Turner | 10154728490521336_10154730147626336 | Just my opinion:  were I a parent paying for my child to be educated at this  'institution of higher learning' I would demand that the school stop this idiocy or return the tuition fees all ready paid!!! If my child were voluntarily involved in the nonsense I would withhold future funding until their sanity returned!
8 | Jonathan Couch | 10154728490521336_10154730149406336 | I'm so sick of hearing how people in this country are offended by this or offended by that. People need to grow the f*** up and carry on with their life. Nothing but a bunch of liberal pu$$ys causing problems
9 | Scott Nowicki | 10154728490521336_10154730140636336 | Problem here is,these buffoons are forcing their space upon everyone else,demanding to have their space,demanding to be heard,disregarding everyone and everything around them. Cubism. Don't force YOUR agenda down the throats of others,stapling a giant "I'm a racist,I'm a bigot" sign on your back. It's not about having your stupid safe space,it's YOU, forcing your agenda card upon the world around you.
10 | Rebekkah Anderson | 10154728490521336_10154730146601336 | I love getting "pay back" for what my race has done 😂. Fun fact though, half my family hasn't even been in the US for 3 whole generations and the other half were barely surviving in the sand of Oklahoma, much less own slaves. Love that they also over look completely all the other races of slaves that were in history. Just sayin...
11 | Jill Carnall Kramer | 10154728490521336_10154730151236336 | What a bunch of attention seeking whiners. Companies should think long and hard about hiring any recent or pending Berkeley graduates. They don't seem to be able to function in the real world.
12 | Silas DerayzAngeles | 10154728490521336_10154730169466336 | Let the truth stand out,no matter how painful it may all seem to be; Iam black,and i do not support all these,we are all Americans.I do not support any form of racial segregation.On my part,rallying against the police for the recent killiing of blacks,is immature.Most of the white police a doing as good.They're doing a very commendable job on our streets and neighbourhoods.White police a good people just like any other,so holding rallies against them isn't the right thing.We should instead show our support for the police,no matter our race,having in mind tht,we've got "RADICAL" police,who are trying hard to discredit and brand anyother police as a racist which is not true.Secondly,our Judicial system is playing an upper hand in inflaming racial bias by not sentencing those found guilty of either racial killing or anyother racial evil.
13 | Brooke Beiber-Rice | 10154728490521336_10154730179916336 | So now they are saying certain areas are for "people of color" ? Why don't you just slap signs up on the bathrooms and water fountains again that separate who can use which one, people color from non color. That's what they used to say too, you'll be safer if you stick with your "own kind" . Do any of these college students ever take a history class? Have they learned nothing? This type of behavior was fought hard and long to get rid of. Now it's just going backwards.
14 | Stephen Miller | 10154728490521336_10154730214711336 | When my grandfather was 18 years old, his "safe place" was on a destroyer, namely the U.S.S. Jarvis, in the south pacific, fighting the Japanese Empire. How rediculous this nation has become!
15 | Zippy Bippy | 10154728490521336_10154730141101336 | Uggg-yet another politically correct leftist"screwl" as Rush would call it. One Trump sign on the campus would undoubtedly throw them into a tizzy
16 | Karen Roozen Mura | 10154728490521336_1598641127097999 | These people are protesting to basically undo all the hard earned progress of the last 50 years. They want segregation. Martin Luther King is rolling over in his grave.
17 | Jannette Sheldon | 10154728490521336_1598640427098069 | Well another college I won't let my children go to. $ saved! Thank you @UCBerkeley for making it a little bit easier who NOT to give our money and their dads GI bill to. I won't allow my children to be taught to be narrow minded, to be racist and to made felt that because they are white & Hispanic that their race is inferior or supreme!! @UCBerkeley no longer in the candidate running for colleges for my kids.
18 | Tom Younker | 10154728490521336_10154730170451336 | Just a thought... I probably wouldn't hire a doctor or lawyer from a modern day liberal university. I wouldn't want a guy who needs a safe space performing surgery on me even if he went to Washington University or Harvard...lol. The fairy tale campus lifestyle is nothing like the seriousness of everyday life. My lawyer better not think he can walk out of my jury trial because someone hurt his feelings.
19 | Angie Guest Johnson | 10154728490521336_1896222713935080 | Us "white kids" have been taught our whole lives to ignore color, that it doesn't matter what color a person is, we are all the same and now those of color can't let it go.... so many steps forward erased by 8 years of an Obama administration.
20 | Wendy Green Hoffman | 10154728490521336_1598685317093580 | Here's a news flash. The world is calling for UC Berkeley to wake up and step into the real world. Every space should be a safe space for all people. Segregation ended years ago. Congratulations on stepping backwards 60 years.
21 | Gary Ladyka | 10154728490521336_10154730223581336 | You idiots (protestors) are totally clueless! You are doing nothing except making things worse! You are doing the very thing you are protesting against!! I guess it's true when they say "You can't fix stupid!"
22 | Brenda Sparks | 10154728490521336_1001135003365070 | Supposedly the people who get accepted to UC Berkeley have 4.0 averages. And yet, they need protection from each other?? I guess "intelligence" is highly overated...
23 | BeBe-Tim Cole | 10154728490521336_10154730144591336 | Oh my word!!! How ridiculous can you be. Suck it it up. You're not there for your (unethical) sexual preference, or because of your. Color. You're there to learn and it shows, you need it. You can't ways have it your way or what you want, so grow up!
24 | Genia Ayers Glover | 10154728490521336_10154730261291336 | I would jerk my kid up by their ears and smack the crap out of them if they had done anything like this in college. Stop bowing down to this bs. They either go to class and learn or tell them to get off campus. If they want segregation to happen again in this country, they won't like the results of it. Maybe if they actually went to class to learn history they would know that.
25 | Elena Temples | 10154728490521336_1157931717610951 | Oh please. Grow a set. Time to take off the diaper and pull up your big kid panties and deal with it. Not everyone will like you and your choices. Deal with it. Not everyone likes mine. And that's ok. And yet I still have somehow managed to get along with people and go through life just fine without demanding my boss, or school or ANYONE build me a safe space. It's called being an adult.  Who raised this generation of entitled wussies?

1 | Andy Smarr | 10154728678596336_10154730118011336 | idiots. it's a rock with some crap scratched on it. i wish i could see your faces when you realize that "heaven" doesn't exist and that you wasted your entire lives praying to something that some guy made up.
2 | Mayra Perez | 10154728678596336_10154730090681336 | Ummm is a fake , not cause it doesn't exist , the real one was hidden in the ark of pact by Moses. And none has found the ark of pact. So none has found the tablet of 10 commandments.
3 | Lindsay Hoffmaster | 10154728678596336_10154730535306336 | To those saying heavens not real, why do you care what others believe? Does it affect your life on a daily basis? No?! Didn't think so.
4 | Beau Best | 10154728678596336_10154730203556336 | No freedom of speech No freedom of religion No freedom of expression No thank you.So glad that modern western societies and governments are secular.It is a lovely piece of Bronze Age history though.
5 | Daniel Grinestaff | 10154728678596336_10154730622626336 | Why the hatred? Its a piece of history. No one would say stupid things if it was the original bass guitar used by McCartney for the Beatles first US tour. I think this is just a bit more significant.
6 | Frank Sullivan | 10154728678596336_10154730567991336 | All you doubters, no one said it was the original.The Ten Commandments are the original foundations on which society as a whole were found. As to WHOM I pray to has nothing to do with this, so get off your high horse. As to judgement day, one of us is wrong, and I'm positive it is not me! Are you so sure that YOUR life gains you nothing more than a ride in a hearse at the end of it?! Think about it. Have a blessed day.
7 | PJ Cooper | 10154728678596336_10154730565366336 | Even though we know it's not the real 10 commandments tablet... how does one bring them self to put something with this level of connection up for sale? It's what I say: Nothing is sacred anymore, everything is for sale.
8 | Matt Field | 10154728678596336_10154730698491336 | People hate those who believe because they are unfortunately blinded to the truth. Jesus even said those who believe in him will be hated,  disliked,  mocked, etc. Just as he was.....I say bring it on. I would rather stand with God and be judged by the world than stand with the world and be judged by God.
9 | Kenny Marie Perry | 10154728678596336_10154730156506336 | I just don't believe that something of this significance should be just auctioned off. Museum is where it should be. IF it's real!
10 | Barbara Stokowski Florian | 10154728678596336_10154730700951336 | Relax! There is nothing here that says this is an original tablet. If it were, it would go for a lot more than $250k! It would be priceless. It is old though, so collectors will pay a lot of money for it. The statement in the article that the Ten Commandments are "Christian text" is pretty funny though, since they predate Jesus by about 1,500 years!
11 | Daniel Frusco | 10154728678596336_10154730324011336 | A re print sorry re chizel, who was the nut job to by that. I do not think that used a stone to remake the 10 commandments papiros or copper would have been a better choice easy to travel with.
12 | Jon Handel | 10154728678596336_10154730138556336 | The buying and/or selling of religious artifacts, dear children, is known as SIMONY. There, now you can impress all your friends.
13 | Doris Wagnon | 10154728678596336_10154730892646336 | Our God is so generous.  What you see is a tablet with the same Ten Commandments that is offered freely and His Word is written in stone for all to see, and yet, even with this priceless tablet with His Word written on it, those who reject Him, reject this priceless piece of stone with scribbles on it.  You, as unbelievers, demand that pieces of stone be removed from in front of you, and you have been given your demands, but God is always and forever reaching out to His creation and saying, "Only Believe, only believe My Word, only Believe in My Son Jesus."  So simple, yet God's Word will always be "Priceless" to the Believer.
14 | Hunter Grooms | 10154728678596336_10154730894491336 | You know, it's funny because noone actually knows where the ACTUAL Ark of the Covenant is because of this EXACT reason. We have gotten so far into sin we have forgotten the value and significance of what the tablets would mean. You think just because noone has found the gold box in which holds the stones God wrote on them on Mt. Sinai that it's fake. But the reason we haven't found it is because we would be more interested in selling it for the monetary value and completely disregard the spiritual value behind it. It's also a good thing noone has found it because the second they touch it they will be struck dead for not following God's SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS on how to approach, transfer, or handle it. (Reference 2 Samuel 6) Read your Bible and you will find the answers."In those days, when your numbers have increased greatly in the land," declares the LORD, "people will no longer say, 'The ark of the covenant of the LORD.' It will never enter their minds or be remembered; it will not be missed, nor will another one be made." Jeremiah 3:16
15 | Lane Claypool | 10154728678596336_10154730839726336 | John Campbell, it would be a more Christian attitude to pray for the atheists to accept Christ than it is to delight in the thought of them going to Hell. You should pray on your attitude towards the lost and do a better job of trying to bring them to Christ. It is alright to warn them about eternal damnation, but a Christian shouldn't delight in the thought of the lost suffering for eternity.
16 | Delwin Hyatt | 10154728678596336_10154730691706336 | Hey Andy, if I die and heaven does not exist I have lost nothing, when you die if there is a heaven  you have lost everything--FOREVER. Are you really willing to take that chance?
17 | Diaz Raul | 10154728678596336_10154730698201336 | So you found the ark then? Thats where the fabled "10 commandments" were last placed before being buried by god. Funny thing, so many older religions agree to there being more, not christians though. Lol. I love the morons who believe the crap governments endorse. No america, no political interests have media control..... Research isnt a thing for most of you.
18 | Lee Thomas | 10154728678596336_10154730489056336 | don't worry everyone who is scared it might get broken. I hear trump will buy it drop it off trump tower hit 2 people with it on the ground and say there at fault for it shattering and you all can call him a hero.
19 | Tony Smith | 10154728678596336_10154730824626336 | I love people Like Andy who can PROVE Heaven isn't real or Christ for that matter....oh wait,he cant.All he can do is form his OPINION And put it out there to be FACT.If what you say is true Andy about some guy making up that story would you care to Enlighten us all with your vast knowledge and wisdom?

23 | Laurie Dunco | 10154728678596336_10154730493546336 | While evolutionists toss years around like a football, they ignore a fundamental flaw in Darwin’s idea. What’s that? Even trillions of years wouldn’t be enough time to produce the simplest cell.Secular science textbooks make the origin of life sound simple enough. Throw in some chemicals, zap them with electricity, and you’ve got organic stew. At some point long, long ago, one such chemical concoction hit on the magical formula to succeed. After that, natural selection and genetics took over and marched toward humanity. Given enough time, these books assure us, it was bound to happen.But that formula for life is like multiplying by zero. No matter how big the other numbers, you’ll still end up with zilch. In other words, throwing in as much time as you like would still get you nowhere. It’s sort of like this:Darwin’s idea × billions of years × 0 (chance of actually happening) = 0.
24 | John Kerr | 10154728678596336_10154730436271336 | meanwhile in real news about whats happening in america - native americans are being attacked, pepper sprayed, beaten and arrested for trying to protect their drinking water from the dakota oil line- Fox News doesnt report this cos theyre basically corporate shrills = SHAME ON AMERICA
25 | Jason Reardon | 10154728678596336_10154730674376336 | Hilarious, some idiot will actually spend money on a rock with scratches all over it. Time to grow up and stop believing in these myths.

1 | Nathaniel Rodriguez | 10154728551036336_10154729960721336 | As a millennial I see so much non-patriotism in my generation..when I hear him talk it makes me feel so proud to be an American. Mr Trump, you are one of the reasons why I decided to serve my country. :)
2 | William Garcia | 10154728551036336_10154729934961336 | Our country Will Not Survive if Hiliary is allowed to steal this election. Folks, please think of your children, extended family & friends. We as a nation & a people have arrived at a time of choosing unlike any other of our lifetimes. If you choose to stay home, vote 3rd party or vote for Hiliary, you will be destroying any chance of our country's survival. I'm not asking you to vote for Donald Trump the man, I am begging you to vote for Donald Trump & Mike Pence' vision to save our beloved America and it's sovereignty. You need only look to Europe to see our future if Hiliary gains the White House. Open borders & Globalism is NOT the answer. A vote for Trump - Pence, and what they represent, will be the best gift / legacy you can give your children and your children's children. I beg you, please stand and be counted. VOTE ! ......... M
3 | Wesley W Hannus | 10154728551036336_10154729947896336 | I keep reading early voting favors democrat. They may be Democrat but they may be voting Trump. I know a lot of Democrats myself who are voting Trump.
4 | Belayneh Ayalew | 10154728551036336_10154729971991336 | Pay no attention to the liberal media polls my friends. They're meant to discourage you. If Hillary was as far ahead in the polls as reported, there would be no reason for the NYT from publishing that false story about Trump. The main stream media and the Democrats are scared Trump is going to win. That's why they manufactured that trashy hit-piece!
5 | William Garcia | 10154728551036336_10154729930446336 | I can't believe the stupidity of democrats thinking that stealing a few Trump signs from people's yards will discourage us from supporting him, the weasels better hope I don't catch them.
6 | Anna Marie Cain | 10154728551036336_10154729993296336 | If Elizabeth Warren is cheering for nasty women being tired of nasty men etc and need to go vote for Clinton.... Here's my chant: This nasty woman is voting for TRUMP..... who's tired of Clinton's nasty lies
7 | Rob Maynard | 10154728551036336_10154730018481336 | I wasn't gonna vote. I thought either way we were doomed, then all of Hillarys wrong doings came out so i started looking a little closer and doing more research. Trump may jabe said somethings but its still better than the ignorance Hillary tries to treat America with. Vote Trump for all of our futures.
8 | Monte Werle | 10154728551036336_10154729957856336 | Trump you have my vote! Hillary will destroy this country, she's ready to sell this country out. #VoteTrump, seriously we can't let Hillary win.
9 | Andrea Bayne | 10154728551036336_10154729965476336 | It's breath taking how corrupt and out of control the white house and agencies are and how spineless our congress is. I don't think a lot of this would be happening if Newt was still there. Clinton will take it to a whole new level. They'll be like the international mafia.
10 | Lars Kadison | 10154728551036336_10154729969581336 | If you try to analize what is going on, Trump has a message of action and inclusion for the country, while Hillary is applying Mommy's brakes and trying to keep the US overcommitted on the world stage.  Of course, there is an amazing amount of distraction being thrown at the voters in the hope that they stay home or vote for what's-his-name from NM. It is exciting to see if this strategy goes down in flames (which is good for future elections in this country), and then enjoy peace in the time before Thanksgiving and Christmas.
11 | Chance Murphy | 10154728551036336_10154730017071336 | Once the election is over, he'll most likely go back to his gold apartment, and all the people who thought he cared about them are going to be about what they were before the election to him. Just an opinion, and prediction. Probably also have trump tv. That'll be a Dandy.
12 | Jeanne Tall | 10154728551036336_10154730112231336 | Trump really loves this nation and ALL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE and without a doubt Trump will keep us safe and protect our welfare, something we have not heard or felt for such a very long time!
13 | Jon Jay Sinatra | 10154728551036336_10154729956341336 | Don't do it Hillary, don't steal this election. Gun owners in this country are 300 million strong. And if you think our family serving in the military are going to turn against us, to protect you! Then you don't belong in prison, you belong in a mental institution.
14 | Barbara Myrick | 10154728551036336_10154730262341336 | Whoa 👀👀👀👀👀!!!!  The Clinton sheeple are out in force early this morning, I guess that your sheep herder, snapped the whip this morning and told you dummies to put down the extra strength koolade and get on the Internet and start putting out your talking points and smear tactics against Trump.😀😀😀😀Guess what, it's not going to work, every Trump supporter is on to the con game Crooked Hillary is trying to pull over the American people, we don't want, nor need a corrupt, crooked politician in the White House, we have had enough of them ruining this great country.We don't care how many gullible sheeple that Hillary pays to lie, she's going down in flames, faster than ole Slick Willie zipper.😀😀😀😀Hillary cannot even fill a kindergarten class room during her rallies, whereas Trump supporters are coming to his rallies by the thousands, that goes to show you, that there's more smart people who are on the Trump train, compared to the gullible sheeple that are riding on the stinky bus with Crooked Hillary.She has the media, Slick Willie, both Obamas, Bernie Sanders, Tim Kaine, her daughter, Joe Biden, the whole corrupt government and she still is losing to Trump ! 😂😂😂😂😂No one wants Ole Granny pantsuit as president, when will she get that through her thick, corrupt skull???
15 | Hedy Bethany | 10154728551036336_10154730275876336 | Please spread this EVERYWHERE:"On election day, if your voting machine is a SmartMatic brand, DEMAND a paper ballot. George Soro’s now owns SmartMatic. You have the right to require a paper ballot, and under FEDERAL LAW the polling place MUST provide one for you. Don’t throw your vote away."

17 | Pa Momoh Forna | 10154728551036336_10154730093926336 | Sounds like a looser. I mean the worst US Presidential election ever. Surely there wouldn't be someone like Trump in the future. Unbelievable.
18 | Jf Kennedy | 10154728551036336_10154729918611336 | There have been signs of tampering with the voting machines please people pay very close attention to what is high lighted on who you choose. Be American do your part. If you happen to come across any of the walking dead coming into vote report them to a none Democrat
19 | Chance Murphy | 10154728551036336_10154730134501336 | Thanks Trump for bringing the phrase "grab her pussy" into mainstream. Nothing like classing up the GOP. Also, for the less intelligent, I'm making fun of the GOP 😉

My son moved forward to stop the bomber when the bomb exploded. He saved everyone in his unit," he said. "My son was Capt. Humayun Khan; he was 27 years old. And he was a Muslim American. I want to ask Mr. Trump: 'Would my son have a place in your America?'"
21 | Alan Sinclair | 10154728551036336_10154729919026336 | Exactly ! Trump TV will have something for every white, non-college educated suburban and small town dweller.....
22 | Davide Fior | 10154728551036336_10154730518221336 | So many people see trump as god and think Hillary is gonna be a bad president. Lmao. It's the same people who think Obama was a bad president.   People need to stop and realize the congress and the senate are the ones pushing policy through.  People elect these people to represent them but like this election, your gonna elect people to work with the same elites.  You can't expect change to happen instantly, it takes time
23 | Jay Spice | 10154728551036336_10154730093221336 | What a bomb a loser a racist a scam artist a con artist and we still don't know nothing about Donald Trump he hasn't released his taxes what is he hiding this never been done he really scan the American people bunch of fools
24 | Keith R. Huettemann | 10154728551036336_10154730345966336 | Sound like the warm up of a concession speech, leading to the slapping of his name across across the Breitbart website, launching himself into the media business. Thrusting a new network that would make Fox News "Liberal"
25 | Robert Fisher | 10154728551036336_10154730509296336 | makes sense his brand has been damaged, hotel bookings at trump properties is way down, so he may as well do speaking engagements about "make america great" (whatever that means) after he gets crushed in the election

Local artist Heather Wise crafted a "temporary replacement" for the missing head that one Twitter user likened to ET and another to a "demonic hedgehog."
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Tamukedde Maurice | 10154728263131336_10154729974066336 | If Americans keep offending God with such stupid stuff, then He will let Hillary be your President and you and I know that you will suffer and be destroyed when that happens
2 | Daniel Guerrero | 10154728263131336_10154729897781336 | That is the temporary replacement? Does that woman not have a grasp of what the baby Jesus's face may have looked like? With all this technology we have this day in age she could've googled a baby Jesus and found hundreds of photos to work up a replica. Geez man.
3 | Otto Wulff | 10154728263131336_10154729912326336 | They think that's funny huh? they mock and laugh? well what's God say in response who will judge them to eternal torment, Psalm 37:13 but the Lord laughs at the wicked, for he knows their day is coming.
4 | Sue Saltvick-Padilla | 10154728263131336_10154730340781336 | The article should have stated "local artist with mental issues" fashioned a replacement. Or, "local blind artist" or "local kindergarten class sculpting in clay for the first time" or
5 | Roger Kinnison | 10154728263131336_10154729873111336 | Somebody please tell me the local artist was an 8 year old. I am a construction worker and could have done a better job than that.
6 | Ed Williams | 10154728263131336_10154730331336336 | this is the type of leftist progressive intolerance we've come to expect from the pigs. it's disgraceful, it's a hate crime and it's another unAmerican activity that the left embraces.
7 | Brandi Peterson | 10154728263131336_10154730539151336 | Look folks, that was never Jesus to begin with. It was a statue. Even if it looked like an actual baby before, it was still a stone statue.Our God doesn't live within a statue. So it's all good.
8 | Jim Francois | 10154728263131336_10154730746021336 | Ironically, these are the same people who say we need to be more accepting and tolerant of Islam and how egregious it is when people criticize it.  But, y'know, it's perfectly fine when people mock Christianity.
9 | Maggie P Craig | 10154728263131336_10154730488736336 | Why do people feel they have to offend God and everything he stands for? What is wrong with these people, they have NO respect for anything, it is disgusting and shameful!

12 | Linda Hanson | 10154728263131336_10154730786641336 | Well - if a film-maker was arrested for causing Benghazi, and I believe is still jailed (or not), then shouldn't we apply the same standard here??? hmmmm...
13 | Emanuel Si Laura Onuta | 10154728263131336_10154730650331336 | I don't know who dumber the artist or the church for allowing something so vile on Jesus head! It looks demonic like some dragon lizard thing or a pile of 💩
14 | Jeffrey Mayer | 10154728263131336_10154730442536336 | Does anyone understand that this great country has gone to hell and a hand basket under Obama...and that this will continue under Clinton. DO WE have the guts to vote to retain our hard fought heritage, or let some corrupt lying politician.in Hillary Clinton.who is no better then you or I,.. destroy it further...The Brits had the guts, BREXIT...now do we !
15 | Lydia Ganzer | 10154728263131336_10154730861206336 | A disrespect for all religions tht believe n Jesus Christ -no r God doesn't live n statue it is a symbol of it period n should B respected as such!!!
16 | Chisai Lilly | 10154728263131336_10154730554476336 | Good God ..she should have left it headless...that looks like something that should be thrown back in the ocean
17 | Krista Ross | 10154728263131336_10154730856371336 | The artist did this out of the goodness of her heart, it was her first attempt and it's not finished, so chill out people, if you think you can do better, please step up!
18 | Felipe Gonzalez-Ochoa | 10154728263131336_10154729871441336 | Jesus is about as real as trumps chances of winning the election.  Speaking of trump why does that little orange demon head look just like trump?
19 | Chastity Worley Burton | 10154728263131336_10154730036801336 | Wtf is wrong with people? The thief and the artist needhelp
20 | Michele Jones | 10154728263131336_10154729889146336 | Liz Crokin is an award-winning author, a seasoned journalist and an advocate for sex crime victims.Media has failed so miserably at reporting the truth about Trump.    The left and the liberal media launch these hideous kinds of attacks at Trump everyday. Nothing could be further from the truth about the real estate mogul.  (Donald Trump is a racist, bigot, sexist, xenophobe, anti-Semitic and Islamophobe -- did I miss anything?)As an entertainment journalist, I’ve had the opportunity to cover Trump for over a decade, and in all my years covering him I’ve never heard anything negative about the man until he announced he was running for president.I was paid a lot of money to dig up dirt on celebrities like Trump for a living, so a scandalous story on the famous billionaire could’ve potentially sold a lot of magazines and would’ve been a “huge” feather in my cap.He doesn’t drink alcohol or do drugs.  He’s a hard working businessman and totally devoted to his beloved wife and children.He’s one of the most generous celebrities in the world with a heart.In 2004, I worked as an entertainment columnist for the “Red Eye Edition of the Chicago Tribune” and as a freelancer for “Us Weekly”.Trump & his family made frequent visits to Chicago during construction of the Trump International Hotel & Tower.   I’ve had nothing but positive experiences with all of them.Some of the acts of kindness:In 1986, Trump prevented the foreclosure of Annabell Hill’s family farm after her husband committed suicide. Trump personally phoned down to the auction to stop the sale of her home and offered the widow money. Trump decided to take action after he saw Hill’s pleas for help in news reports.In 1988, a commercial airline refused to fly Andrew Ten, a sick Orthodox Jewish child with a rare illness, across the country to get medical care because he had to travel with an elaborate life-support system.  He sent HIS own plane to take the child from Los Angeles to New York so he could get his treatment.In 1991, 200 Marines who served in Operation Desert Storm spent time at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina.An aircraft would not be able to take them home on their scheduled departure date.   He sent HIS plane to make two trips from North Carolina to Miami to safely return the Gulf War Marines to their loved ones.In 1995, a motorist stopped to help Trump after the limo he was traveling in had a flat tire. Trump asked the Good Samaritan how he could repay him for his help. All the man asked for was a bouquet of flowers for his wife.  Trump sent the flowers with a note that read: “We’ve paid off your mortgage.”In 1996, Trump filed a lawsuit against the city of Palm Beach, Florida accusing the town of discriminating against his Mar-a-Lago resort club because it allowed Jews and blacks. Abraham Foxman, who was the Anti- Defamation League Director at the time, said Trump “put the light on Palm Beach – not on the beauty and the glitter, but on its seamier side of discrimination. ”  Trump’s had a trickle-down effect.   Other clubs followed his lead and began admitting Jews and blacks.In 2000, Maury Povich featured a little girl named Megan who struggled with Brittle Bone Disease on his show.   Trump said the little girl’s story and positive attitude touched his heart.   He gifted the little girl and her family with a very generous check.In 2008, after Jennifer Hudson’s family members were tragically murdered in Chicago, Trump put the Oscar-winning actress and her family up at his Windy City hotel for free. In addition to that, Trump’s security took extra measures to ensure Hudson and her family members were safe during such a difficult time.In 2013, New York bus driver Darnell Barton spotted a woman close to the edge of a bridge staring at traffic below as he drove by. He stopped the bus, got out and put his arm around the woman and saved her life by convincing her to not jump.  Trump sent the hero bus driver a check.    He believed his good deed deserved to be rewarded.In 2014, Trump gave $25,000 to Sgt. Andrew Tahmooressi after he spent seven months in a Mexican jail for accidentally crossing the US-Mexico border. President Barack Obama couldn’t even be bothered to make one phone call to assist with the United States Marine’s release; however, Trump opened his pocketbook to help this serviceman get back on his feet.In 2016, Melissa Consin Young attended a Trump rally and tear fully thanked Trump for changing her life. She said she proudly stood on stage with Donald Trump as Miss Wisconsin USA in 2005. However, years later she found herself struggling with an incurable illness and during her darkest days she explained that she received a handwritten letter from Trump telling her she’s the “bravest woman, I know.” She said the opportunities that she received from Trump and his organizations ultimately provided her Mexican-American son with a full-ride to college.Lynne Patton, a black female executive for the Trump Organization, released a statement in 2016 defending her boss against accusations that he’s a racist and a bigot. She tearfully revealed how she’s struggled with substance abuse and addiction for years. Instead of kicking her to the curb, she said the Trump Organization and his entire family loyally stood by her through “immensely difficult times.”Trump’s kindness knows no bounds and his generosity has and continues to touch the lives of people from every sex, race and religion. When Trump sees someone in need, he wants to help.Two decades ago, (Opera asks Trump to help with "Make A Wish" children) Oprah asked Trump in a TV interview if he’d run for president. He said: “If it got so bad, I would never want to rule it out totally, because I really am tired of seeing what’s happening with this country.” That day has come. Trump sees that America is in need and he wants to help– how unthinkable!
21 | Harold Purnell | 10154728263131336_10154729899276336 | Is it me or is the demon head a dead ringer for Herr Drumpf?
22 | Ralph Jackson | 10154728263131336_10154729874761336 | Well Heather Wise should maybe pursue a new career if she considers that "art".. one of my dumps would of been a better replacement!
23 | Karen Youch Lundy | 10154728263131336_10154730789346336 | Who in that parish actually thought the terra cotta artist was any good? At least it brought the woman who stole the head back to her senses!
24 | Jill Busam | 10154728263131336_10154730459736336 | Why did the Priest leave this atrocity in place for even one minute?
25 | Eric T Lewis | 10154728263131336_10154730341341336 | the replacement head looked like some sort of creature from hell. I am glad the got the original head back.

Turkey, Suni Muslims, this is what life is about Survival , Peace On Earth for all to get on Obama & Hillary Clinton are Opening uo Wounds that May not Heal Please STOP now with your Hatred towards Donald Trump AMEN 🇺🇸

Nearly 10,000 soldiers, many of whom completed multiple combat tours, have been ordered to repay the cash bonuses after audits revealed widespread overpayments by California Guard officials.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Randy Duran | 10154728441026336_10154729722731336 | Yea because only in America can you be overpaid to put your life at risk for the wellbeing of the whole. Why doesn't congress take a pay cut instead
2 | Jon Ferrin | 10154728441026336_10154729724011336 | Who in the hell do you think is going to want to join now? This was no mistake it was planned so we have an even smaller military for the US to be taken over. Don't let the news fool you.
3 | Joey Hendley | 10154728441026336_10154729727056336 | What a freaking shame! Taken money back from soilders, homeless veterans sleeping in the cold streets, and yet we send millions of dollars to other country's that are in need. Wake up America!!
4 | Keith Richards | 10154728441026336_10154729726956336 | I have a better idea..why don't the politicians that voted to send them overseas take it out of their personal pay checks instead.. That would be a great gesture!
5 | Earl Pilling | 10154728441026336_10154729730341336 | I'm sure they'll be happy to repay these bonuses as soon and quickly as those who have Illegal entered the USA pay back all the money and cost of benefits Obama has given them.
6 | Darren Reasons | 10154728441026336_10154729732166336 | Ask Hillary to return the 6 billion that vanished. Then ask obama to use some of that 1.7 billion he handed to our terrorist enemies in Iran.. Tell them to use that and call those brave american soldiers good...
7 | A.J. Pinto | 10154728441026336_10154729721471336 | I feel sorry for hillary Clinton supporters. These people have no common sense and are completely blindfolded to where the corruption is coming from. The saddest part is if they were drowning hillary would watch them sink.If hillary Clinton was any other person she'd have three life sentences in prison
8 | Vince Heather Bonilla | 10154728441026336_10154729736001336 | Obama can resolve this immediately through Executive Order by allowing the government to own this mistake and not force our veterans to repay these bonuses accepted during enlistment pushes. Well, will he stand up for our military men and women who faithfully served our country? Or once again, ignore our service men and women?
9 | Marissa Ness | 10154728441026336_10154729723726336 | Nope. I would tell them they can dig my old flight deck boot out their a$$ once I done kicked them out my door if they ever came asking for repayment of anything.
10 | ShelleyandDelain Moore | 10154728441026336_10154729735361336 | Should be halted immediately. These men and women went to FIGHT in Iraq and Afghanistan. It's my opinion they should not owe a penny back. Do just one good Presidential thing before you leave office Mr. President. This is exactly why we will vote Trump! Killary and the establishment never do anything for our military. The military put their lives on the line, they fight for our rights and freedoms, and they are one of the lowest paid jobs. Thank God for these men and women. It's about time our country take care of them!
11 | Willie Abadilla | 10154728441026336_10154729768021336 | Government led by Obama gave $1.7 billion to Iran, was willing to give Michelle Obama's mother $160,000/year for babysitting her grandkids, spent millions of taxpayer money on lavish personal vacations, paid $12,000 for Michelle's dress and this same government wants to do this to vets who placed theor lives at risk to protect our way of life!! This is complete nonsense!
12 | Roger Kinnison | 10154728441026336_10154729729371336 | Congress can actually do something about this. My question is did they receive anything in writing? And how the hell can they come back 10 years later looking for money?
13 | Lisa Iriarte | 10154728441026336_10154729770676336 | I'm curious to know how many CEOs from Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Verizon, IBM, Microsoft etc. the list goes on Who were demanded to pay back any of their bonuses!!?? The answer would be zero! This government has turned this country into an absolute debacle. Its shameful & deplorable what they are doing to our Veterans & Active Military!! 😡😡😡
14 | Jenae King | 10154728441026336_10154729806081336 | These men and women don't make enough money to hardly live as we speak! It's pathetic and disgraceful asking for money back, they earned it! I wouldn't pay anything back! Tell Obama and the rest of the Politicians to take a pay cut!
15 | Rhea Johnson Caudill | 10154728441026336_1818998831645826 | So.....we promise our military a bonus and someone screws up and they have fought for this country and now we're going to screw them over by making it hard for them to live each month........meanwhile we give free hand outs to those who refuse to work, to those who are in our country illegally, & to refugees? Something is wrong with this!!!
16 | Kacie 'Wright' Zolman | 10154728441026336_10154729727086336 | This is absurd!!!!!!!!!!! I don't care what happened or whose fault it was. Do not make them pay a dime. How about thank them for their service instead!
17 | David Perkins | 10154728441026336_10154729741646336 | um wouldn't that be unAmerican to take away the Bonuses? after all recently some illegals being deported got to be citizens after the wrong button was purposely pushed, then DC said oh we can't take away what was given, that would be unAmerican, yea now look at our Gov. taking away some little pay that our soldiers got? soldiers who fight for our freedoms and even those illegals, absolutely disgusting! Shame on you DC!
18 | Sandrine Barbour | 10154728441026336_1818950264984016 | The only mistake is the mind-numbing incompetency of our government. Someone should pay this money back, but it should not be the soldiers who served....it should be those responsible for this screw-up. Heads should roll over this.........the incompetence and arrogance is disgusting. Whoever made the loathsome and unconscionable decision to go after the soldiers should be fired immediately.
19 | Tom Frank | 10154728441026336_10154729743941336 | Obama is doing everything he can to shrink our military so the other countries can destroy America Americans need to just hold on for another ever how long it takes to get Obama out and get Donald Trump them then they can go take care of business this filthy Muslim is doing everything he can to destroy America and Hillary wants to do the same thing
20 | Joyce Saylan | 10154728441026336_10154729769536336 | I want to see Obama go into a VA hospital and ask a battered, paraplegic soldier to give any money back.   If he wants it that bad, make him ask for it personally!  Each one!
21 | Johnny Gee | 10154728441026336_10154729764146336 | I don't have a problem with their extra income, and a pay a boat load of taxes. Our soldiers should be getting a double check before lazy people on welfare get one
22 | Kevin Wardwell | 10154728441026336_10154729800626336 | This is such B.S.! CONGRESS sucks so bad as well as the goverment trying to do this. The corruption of America continues! Bringing Hillary in as president would just make matters worse.
23 | Andi Larson | 10154728441026336_10154729788211336 | Every time obama wants to punish conservatives, he messes with our military. Remember when he shut down the WW2 memorial? That memorial is an open air space, not a building. obama spent more money putting up barricades and trying to keep veterans out then he saved and the vets went in anyway. They are braver and smarter than little barry otero.
24 | Suzie Roe | 10154728441026336_1803114623267523 | There is just no end to the failed leadership (I use that term loosely) in this country in recent years.  EPIC FAIL from the top on down.  I hope there is some recourse for these soldiers.  This is certainly not something that was their fault... suck it up govt.  Our country owes them, not the other way around!!
25 | Jared K. | 10154728441026336_10154729730886336 | Um, you erroneously receive money that doesn't belong to you, you're required to pay it back. Why is this an issue. I'm glad someone caught the error. Typical government waste & lack of oversight. SMH

A beaming smile of a baby girl just days after her premature birth is lighting up the internet.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Donna Sanabria | 10154728259741336_10154729686991336 | After all of this political hell we have been going through this little ray of sunshine can brighten up all of our days! What a doll!
2 | Tammy Bettiga | 10154728259741336_10154729712221336 | How can anyone ever say that this sweet child has no rights....HOW....I had a grandchild that was a primmie..4lbs...that child fought for her life...the day she was born....she fought....she made it.....she had a right to life...!!!
3 | Thoni Ubaka Ofunne | 10154728259741336_10154729690326336 | And some persons wouldn't shudder killing this baby before even getting a chance to live? A mother? Now I know what's she's done to other babies after Chelsea.
4 | Doxa Banks | 10154728259741336_10154729693106336 | Thank God hillary did not "deliver" her.......... God bless u for coming into this world kid!!!! You will grow up well to do great things for America
5 | Dawna Huff | 10154728259741336_10154729689766336 | If Hillary Clinton had her way about this child would've been aborted all the way up to nine months .. I wonder if she's upset about that this baby actually lived .... 🖕Ing hillary clinton is the one who was on video saying that children are effing retards ..
6 | Cindy Harriman | 10154728259741336_10154729754261336 | This warms my heart! As a preemie myself  (born in 1983, 3 months early weighed in at 1lb 14oz)  I know how hard it is just getting by daily. I had to fight but man if it wasn't for my parents and God, the nuns that came up to pray for us every day there is no way either me or my Mom would have made it. She was robbed while pregnant with me and the next day hemmoraged in the bathroom at home.  We had some angels living up the street that saved us and called 911. We both nearly died. Lost my beloved Mom back in 2014 but stories like this just comfort me so much in knowing that little ones are still fighting and staying strong. Prayers to you and your family sweet precious baby girl. You will be fine ❤
7 | Keith VanWinkle | 10154728259741336_10154729975701336 | Anyone who thinks abortion is the so called "right" of a woman should examine there life as a human being as far as I am concerned. It is murder. Nothing less and nothing more. Plain and simple. Don't tell me how you value life and human rights while supporting the killing of innocent babies in the womb.Life is a gift from God and that baby in the womb has no voice but ours. Be on the right and moral side of history. Protect Life. Don't be BARBARIC!!!!
8 | Bree Loggins | 10154728259741336_10154729717071336 | Aww, how sweet! My fraternal twin daughters came early at barely 32 weeks old. They were 4lbs 9oz each...Today they are happy, healthy, intelligent, teenagers. Amazing what these little miracles can teach us about life.
9 | Carrie Beck | 10154728259741336_10154729818146336 | As sick to death as we have all become of this election season seemingly invading every waking moment of our lives, as nice as it is to see this beautiful ray of sunshine amidst it all, and as wrong as it seems to taint it with anything political... It really is an important conversation to have folks. This precious little angel and her infectious smile put a face to what Mrs Clinton is advocating. It puts into perspective what the reality of it is. We're talking about supporting policies that allow babies in utero at this stage of development and later to be aborted. Looking at this infant and understanding the reality of what it is she's advocating, are we really ok with that as a nation? Especially as a matter of national governmental policy/law?... It doesn't take more than one look at that smile for me to know with everything in me that it is wrong.    How could we ever allow such a thing 😢 just look at her... She is perfect
10 | Nancy Beegood | 10154728259741336_10154729725056336 | Dumocraps would have aborted this angel without a second thought. Then they get rabid if an animal is killed. (I can explain it to them, I cannot understand it for them. smh)
11 | Taz Ganiyu | 10154728259741336_10154729708986336 | What a divinely radiant smile. Maybe she is intuitively glad to be alive even if a little early out. She will radiate life hope and purpose around her as she grows up. God bless you mom for your gift from God. Rest assured you will try your best to give her every opportunity to reach her optimum potential and make her dreams come true.  I know Im one since God gave me my own little premie at 24 weeks and at 1lb & 10 oz. It was a very challenging time for our family but God's grace kept him complication free throughout his childhood. He grew up like every normal child and 31 years later he is a successful practicing lawyer in the business district of Chicago.
12 | Peggy Lee Kent | 10154728259741336_10154729719566336 | Just think how many are aborted at this age not to mention older . It is a sad sad shame. That someone can call the shot on a life so innocent that could bring joy to someone     With a sweet smile such as this. God sees purpose in every life created.
13 | Jeremy Plumley | 10154728259741336_10154729708116336 | And to think progressive liberals would have thought nothing of aborting this precious child at the same time in a pregnancy and been praised for it.  God bless this baby and her mother.
14 | Patty Spradling Burse | 10154728259741336_10154730277126336 | Anyone who thinks its ok to have a late term abortion is evil. If mother's health is in jeopardy the baby can be delivered by c section or induction.
15 | Teresa Suggs | 10154728259741336_10154729809891336 | Why do women get pregnant when there's so many different ways to prevent it. They don't have to get pregnant cause to me this is murder. It's so messed up women who have kids have them taken away alot of times and it's not all of them, but some kill their baby's, then u have women who really want kids who can't have them. It's just messed up
16 | Keith Deirup | 10154728259741336_10154729704096336 | Oh look a premature baby, let me go into the comment section to watch misinformed blowhards bloviate about evil doctors ripping babies out wombs just cause they feel like it. Bizarro world in here.
17 | Rebecca Hill | 10154728259741336_10154729740281336 | Such a beautiful smile! It saddens my heart though that we've become a society that praises killing unborn babies up until birth. Looking at this smile, you cannot argue that this baby born at 34 weeks is not a human life. My friend had her baby at 28 weeks I believe. She only weighed 1 pound when she was born. She weighs a little over 3 pounds now and is healthy. Would a non human have been able to survive being born that early? I've talked with pro choice supporters and every single time I get into a discussion about this they always say "well it's not a life until it's born." That is the MOST foolish, ignorant and idiotic statement I've ever heard. My response is usually something like this, "Okay, so if it isn't a human life until it comes out the womb, then what is it before? An alien? An elephant?" Just as ridiculous as my answer sounds is just how ridiculous their argument sounds. Oh and when I ask if I can show them a picture of an abortion I always hear "I don't need to see that." Of course you don't because that would mean you know abortion is murder but your turning a blind eye just to keep your supporters happy. And yea I get it, there are situations where someone might think about an abortion (victim of rape, incest, etc), but there is ALWAYS another path to take. Murdering an innocent child is never okay.
18 | John OConnor | 10154728259741336_10154729714806336 | Isn't that a sight for sore eyes ❤️️under a Hillary administration, that baby inside her mother's womb has zero (o) constitutional rights as a human being.
19 | Desiree Morrison Kane | 10154728259741336_1084584044991697 | I had twins that were premature by 13 weeks.  Just over 2 lbs.  One is in Medical school to become a doctor and the other is a Behavior Therapist working with kids with autism.  According to the Left, it would be completely acceptable to abort them at 27 weeks.  That is murder.
20 | Montana Foreman | 10154728259741336_1872570879639914 | Beautiful!!! Just. Beautiful!! But just think people, this is a premature baby and Hillary is OKAY with aborting late term!!! Wake up America !! This little baby has rights to live!!! Vote Trump, November 8th!! Babies deserve life too!!
21 | Terra S Rodriguez | 10154728259741336_10154730127381336 | I spent 17 weeks in the NICU with my twins that were born at 28 weeks. I became friends with a young lady that dlivered her daughter at 23 weeks. Yes the baby need help, but she is thriving and alive now. So, yes i believe in the right to choose, but there needs to be limits. If a baby can survive, even take just one breath outside the womb then it is to late for an abortion. On the same note, everyone makes a mistake sometime in their lives, but a women should not be able to have 5+ abortion just because she cant keep her legs closed.  One big issue is even here in liberal California, they teach abstinence in school not safe sex. However, waiting until 20 weeks to decide you dont want a baby is ridiculous. As a woman, we know within a few weeks if we are pregnant, I personally feel that abortion should not be a choice after 12 weeks, unless medically necessary up to 22 weeks. After that if they need to take a baby early than a NICU can provide all the care. If however a baby is already passed than it is not really an abortion. On the same note I think a person should need a license to have kids. There should be classes you need to take,  pass a psychological exam, show you can financially provide for a kid, pass a crimal background check just like all education employees. I mean a person needs to pass a test to drive a car, to be a child care provider, hell you even need to pass tests to paint someone's else's  nails. You should have to do the same to have and raise kids. All parents that adopt have to do theses things. If things like that were required for every person that wanted a child there would be a lot less poverty and a lot less stupid people in the world.
22 | Louise Helsby | 10154728259741336_1614604358833950 | Pre eclampsia is the leading cause of maternal and baby deaths in the world, more should be done to fund research into this terrible disorder. I lost my son at 5 weeks old because of severe pre eclampsia. God bless this baby and its parents
23 | Carla Cowell | 10154728259741336_10154730237396336 | And Hillary Clinton is in favor of killing babies before and after they're born, because according to her, under our constitution, fetuses and newborns have no rights because they aren't people. And yes, she did say exactly that.
24 | Gregg Dunay | 10154728259741336_1872591956304473 | That's because she sees Donald Trump is winning in Florida and she knows Hillary wasn't there to end her beautiful smile and life . Maybe this baby girl will be Madam President someday.
25 | Kevin James Taylor | 10154728259741336_1084541234995978 | And some of you all thinks it's ok to abort... wow Go thank your parents for deciding to keep you all around. You guys are brainwashed and don't even know it. Life is life, murder is murder.. nothing to debate here!

The Clinton campaign’s recent attacks on Donald J. Trump for his comments about former Miss Universe Alicia Machado’s weight problems were months in the making, according to an opposition research report uncovered in emails released by Wikileaks.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Kevin Michel | 10154728490396336_10154729589141336 | I'm so tired of all these attacks from Clinton and Obama... I know this isn't along the lines of this story, but the mentality of the DNC just sucks... I live in North County San Diego... this mornings news was about Air Force 1 landing at Miramar Marine Corps Air Station so the president can attend a "fund raiser" in La Jolla California for Hillary Clinton. A couple of hours later the news was Air Force 1 taking off so the president could get to LA (100 miles away) to appear on the Jimmy Kimmel show. I'm sure Obama is back in Washington tonight, who knows where Hillary is... I don't care what he said while on the Kimmel show! I just know he spends a lot of our money to campaign for his choice for the next president... wonder what it costs to fly that 747 around supporting his political party and choice? I personally can't wait until he is gone and a thing of the past, and hopefully the next POTUS won't be so selfish with our money... you know, "pay to play," bringing refugees into our country and putting them on Welfare instead of taking care of Americans first... I could go on and on...
2 | Shannan Cubic | 10154728490396336_10154729682821336 | Seriously, I can give a crap less about anyone's weight, sex life, or taxes, I care about what the hell our economy and national security is going to look like for our family and grandkids. Trump 2016.
3 | Jerry Nungester | 10154728490396336_10154729588316336 | URGENT: PLEASE SHAREOn election day, if your voting machine is a SmartMatic brand, DEMAND a paper ballot. George Soro’s now owns SmartMatic. You have the right to require a paper ballot, and under FEDERAL LAW the polling place MUST provide one for you. Don’t throw your vote away.
4 | Sean Bell | 10154728490396336_10154729596781336 | FOX should re-title this "Smart strategy of a winning campaign." As if planning to use Trumps vulgarness against his own campaign needs to be done so in a timeline that FOX says is ok!? Stupid.
5 | Gary Alexander | 10154728490396336_10154729592756336 | POINTS TO PONDER BEFORE ELECTION DAY :If you are Gay, why are you voting for Hillary? She wants to bring in hundreds of thousands of refugees (hundreds of thousands of them muslim) that believe all Gays (who massacred 50 gays at a Florida night club?) should be executed.If you are Black, why are you voting for Hillary? She admires Margaret Sanger and defends Planned Parenthood. They want to abort as many black babies as possible. "Exterminate the Black Race because they are like weeds." Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.If you are a Christian, why are you voting for Hillary Clinton? She wrote her Senior Thesis on Saul Alinsky. He dedicated his book "Rules for Radicals" to Lucifer, The Devil? She says he was and still is her mentor.If you are a Veteran, in the military, or closely related to a military member, why are you voting for Hillary? She left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again. They called for help but the help was told to stand down.If you have a factory job, why are you voting for Hillary? She supported TPP. Factory workers are being laid off because jobs are going overseas. Don't forget the deals she made with China. She also welcomes open borders and for illegals to get benefits with YOUR tax money.If you are poor, why are you voting for Hillary? She is supporting Wall street and all the big banks. Big banks keep the poor, poor by destroying the poor man's credit by allowing medical bills and collections to affect your credit scores so you can pay higher interest rates than the rich. - Taking as much of the little money you earn.If you are a woman, how can you vote for Hillary? She has buried all of Bill's rape victims under the rug. Remember the little girl that was raped? She defended the rapist and laughed about it later.If you carry a gun, and believe in the Constitution, how can you vote for Hillary? She wants to eliminate the NRA, take your guns, and abolish the second amendment.If you breathe, why would you vote for Hillary? She has left a trail of dead people that did not agree with her or knew too much!Who is left?
6 | Bianca Sumner | 10154728490396336_10154729664411336 | I'm just sitting here in Northwest Georgia praying nightly that Trump wins and that Putin forgets all the stupid stuff Obama has done and Hillary threatened to do. America is tough but we don't need WW3
7 | Jorge Bernal | 10154728490396336_10154729591456336 | The worse part is that Fox News is pricing Wikileaks as heroes because is convenient for them, but, have they realize that by doing that they putting your country in a huge danger by cyber criminals? I just feel sorry for my American friends thanks to Fox News.
8 | Mindy Mahana | 10154728490396336_10154729610941336 | You get in a competition who judge you on looks. Win the competition and think oh now I can get fat. Well I seen the video he never said she was fat. He said he was proud she decided to go on a diet. Get over it you are a nasty women I seen what she does she's nasty. As alot of hillary supporters that are celebrities. It's gross.
9 | Christina Sierra | 10154728490396336_10154729592181336 | If you eliminate all of the hateful rhetoric from the Clinton campaign against Trump you will find a business man that loves America and he hurts when America hurts and nothing will make him happier than to see America succeed
10 | Denise M Smith | 10154728490396336_10154729592356336 | This documentary shows you the wealthy elite are behind a One World order which had already began with creating wars which created the UN. You've heard Bush talk about it and Obama has many times. You now are seeing a momoply with AT&T buying up DirectvTV, and now Time Warner which is why we can't allow Hillary in, ever! She is a global elitist who wants to make her hubby a big player at the UN. If she wins. The world leaders are afraid of this as it will denounce all countries and their currencies. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ijyw2CGF2sU&feature=share
11 | Wanetta Lynn Rose Smith | 10154728490396336_10154729608496336 | God has Blessed America again ..and given us a hero to help us save our nation ...And he is just a man who is not perfect ..but who is ? Donald Trump gave up a very comfortable life to try and save the land we all love.... Let us Pray for him and his mission .Vote for our country and vote Donald Trump .
12 | Joan Bradley | 10154728490396336_10154729698881336 | Why isn't Obama in Washington doing something about those poor vets being forced to pay back the bonuses they earned for defending our country? Instead out fund raising for Hillary?
13 | Wendy Alexakos | 10154728490396336_10154729670336336 | Of course it was. Everything was about making Donald Trump look bad to woman, because of this type of election. And those that have been waiting these long eight years for it to be Hillary's turn feed into this kind of stuff. Good thing for us, that with all those plans, there was no real research into all of these different women and their true backgrounds. And to all the media and pundants that want to ride the pony of Trump talking about law suits on Saturday, I say, I am so glad that he did. Romney rolled over and played dead, just like you all wanted him to. So of course, you all cannot control the independent business man that is Donald Trump. Go Trump!!!
14 | Sandy Dalton Perrin | 10154728490396336_593377074179985 | None of his accusers have been by chance. Everyone of these 11 women, Miss Universe and yes even the Khans have been planted by the Clinton's. What they don't realize is that we are smarter than what they think and it's having the opposite effect on the American people that are completely fed up with their corruption. Trump/Pence the only intelligent choice for change 🇺🇸.
15 | Maria Fernanda Giusti | 10154728490396336_10154729668576336 | I am from Venezuela! She is the worst of the worst. I fell ashamed! American citizens and doesn't know how to speak English
16 | Missy Smith | 10154728490396336_1260533280670842 | Why is this a story? Or even a "wikileak?" This is what political candidates do. ALL OF THEM. Very rarely in my lifetime have I seen a political ad that actually talks about the individual instead of all that's wrong with their opponent. This is not a Hillary thing. This is not an Obama thing. This is not a Trump thing. This is what campaign managers do.
17 | Zack David Douglass | 10154728490396336_10154729590291336 | Words like "Miss Piggy" and "Miss Housekeeper" show how sad and sexist Trump is. So disrespectful and disgusting. And Wikileaks released this? 😂 You know this is about 1% true.
18 | Kathy Johanson | 10154728490396336_1260447624012741 | From research I did of an article and press conference at the time, Trump seemed to be defending her and giving her a second chance, not tearing her down. The girl increased her weight by about 50%. She had a responsibility to stay as she was when crowned for the next year. Like it or not, that's the way it works, and she chose to run for the position of Miss Universe. Trump kept her from being fired.
19 | Mary Lindsley | 10154728490396336_1260488427341994 | It was Trumps job at that time, she signed a contract that said she would not gain weight during her time as Miss Universe if I understood right . It was a show and he was hard on everyone it was his job--if Clinton was doing that job she would have done the same thing.
20 | Frank Slodysko | 10154728490396336_10154729619881336 | Wait wait wait -- You're telling me that a political campaign was devising a STRATEGY?!  And they were taking their time, planning it out?!Whatever will the American population do about this?
21 | Carol Rice | 10154728490396336_10154729618646336 | No matter how much corruption is proven to have taken place by hellary and obummer the media, liberals and dems will call foul. if hellary were to get elected (God forbid). Everyone in every state that believe the dems, liberals and obummer have been conspiring illegally to put her in office, should start a petition to have her impeached, along with her fool of a choice for vice president. All should serve time in prison for their corruption and lies to the American people.
22 | Wendy Garcia | 10154728490396336_1257895037606973 | Alicia Machado is a liar. Her story doesn't make sense. Don't go blaming Trump for having an eating disorder. You said it yourself, it's even quoted. Now she says it was a lie. She's a liar regardless just like Hillary. She sure is getting a lot of publicity.
23 | Mike Burke | 10154728490396336_10154729590406336 | It's called preparation. Also wiki leaks is stolen property by domestic terrorist. We can't allow the people releasing the information to go unpunished.
24 | Loraine Stewart Scott | 10154728490396336_1257912580938552 | I'm watching all of this from the UK, and I thought our politics sucked! I cannot believe that someone who has been proven to be a liar and crook is being allowed to get away with it and is being actively encouraged by such a biased media. I'm disgusted at the levels they are going to undermine Trump. It absolutely proves to me that the Establishment do not want him to win BECAUSE THEY ARE ALL CROOKED!!! Please America, use this opportunity to start afresh... we took the step to get out of the crooked EU. Now embrace Trump and drain your swamp!
25 | Scott Barnes | 10154728490396336_1257834330946377 | Well that backfired in every way possible first before you lie, and Hillary should be better at this by now make sure there isn't a pre exiting statement the predates you allegations as exposed by foxes own Megan Kelly, secondly vet out that the poor helpless beauty queen to make sure didn't have a xxxporn, oh and not only the one from the reality show shot in night vision the one with full color 2 camera production value, also machado was expecting Hillary to protect her when the heat got turned up, but in true Clinton form machado  served her purpose, then Hillary tossed to the way side and discarded,her! But she did get citizenship, and if Hillary is elected could really seem for machado and us with socialism like she is back in Venezuela,

Pennsylvania's former top prosecutor Kathleen Kane has been sentenced to 10 to 23 months in prison, followed by 8 years probation, after being convicted of leaking grand jury documents to the press to retaliate against a rival prosecutor, and then lying under oath about it.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Ray Koonce | 10154728951256336_10154729516991336 | Shouldn't this qualify her to run for President? I'm confused... (sarcasm)
2 | Duane Congrove | 10154728951256336_10154729517236336 | And the difference between this woman and Hillary Clinton IS?
3 | Zach Kerman | 10154728951256336_10154729516511336 | Michelle Obama said if Donald Trump is elected: "We're telling our sons it's okay to humiliate women. We're telling our daughters this is how they deserve to be treated.".... that's funny. So does that mean that if Hillary Clinton is elected, we are teaching our sons & daughters that it's ok to murder, lie, cover up, be corrupt, demean women, use racial slurs, and stay with a spouse that openly rapes women & cheats on you?
4 | Aaron Yox | 10154728951256336_10154729517521336 | Meanwhile Hillary Clinton is still on the loose for deleting 39,000 emails and destroying evidence
5 | Chasitty Swartz Willow | 10154728951256336_10154729524816336 | I've lived in Pennsylvania all of my life and my state has never confused me as much as it has this year..we are going to imprison this women..who ..yes..she deserves to be imprisoned...but give the state over to Hillary in the election.. that logic is beyond me..
6 | Roger Kinnison | 10154728951256336_10154729519731336 | This is how the law is supposed to work, Maybe someone should tell Loretta Lynch to go talk to the prosecutors to see how to do it since she does not seem to understand that lying under oath is a crime.
7 | JC Churchtado | 10154728951256336_10154729517461336 | She should of used the Hillary excuses. She'd be free still.
8 | Clay Meryhew | 10154728951256336_10154729520276336 | Yet Hillary ignores the deaths of 4. Lies under oath. But has a chance of being sentenced to 4 years of presidency! This is so stupid. There is something wrong with our country. This woman deserves her sentence. But Hillary deserves to be sentenced to prison as well!
9 | Michael Coy | 10154728951256336_10154729522921336 | Oh hey look she is a Democrat - and lied under oath trying to kill any investigation into her friends accepting money from lobbyists (pay-to-play), Sound familiar?  Surprised Obama didn't have this squashed.
10 | Wayne R Johnson | 10154728951256336_10154729516201336 | Trump has been called vicious for using words like Liar, corrupt, careless, nasty etc. to describe Hillary Clinton.Hillary has a 26 year history of broken promises, under the table back stabbing behind the scene deals, cover-up after cover-up, multimillion dollar Clinton foundation operations of Pay for Play, lies to protect lies, embraces hate groups and apparently violence at trump events And they call Trump vicious?This is messed up! Vote Trump/Penceand help Make America Great Again
11 | Jill Busam | 10154728951256336_10154729522471336 | So Hillary gets no indictment, court or Prison and Hillary not only lied under oath, but she committed Treason! How the heck does that work? If everyone was treated like Hillary, no one would be in prison for any reason!
12 | Joshua Silvio | 10154728951256336_10154729522016336 | OK so how can Hillary break the law in broad daylight and get away with it ?!?! I'm so confused as to why our police are arresting citizens and allowing corrupt politicians to walk free ?!?!? Do our laws NOT apply to all Americans ???
13 | Linda Cooch Stout | 10154728951256336_10154729524976336 | What the hell - HOW come everyone in the free world gets prosecuted for this type of crime EXCEPT Killary - hell even Martha Stewart went to prison for lying to the FBI!!!
14 | Maria-Margarita Nena Osuna Nordlund | 10154728951256336_987422868034599 | Oh 😲 look, why Bill Clinton wasn't send to Jail for lying under oath??? Again the law doesn't apply to the Clintons....😡😡😡😡😡
15 | Keith Sperry | 10154728951256336_10154729523761336 | Why does she qualify for prosecution but hillary doesn't? This is why our justice system is no longer trusted by many citizens, selective prosecution.
16 | Mary J Thompson | 10154728951256336_10154729541111336 | She is a clintonite.... They helped her get in office, and this wasn't her first bbq, but finally caught for something... I want to see Hilliary in handcuffs too................DONALD TRUMP 2016
17 | Haleola Mcdowell | 10154728951256336_10154729524176336 | What is the difference between her and Hillary yet one gets prison time the other gets to run for president.  Guess if you pay off the right people you can get away with anything.
18 | Stuart Mcmahon | 10154728951256336_10154729534176336 | It does seem one rule for one and one rule for everybody else. This is basically what Clinton has done, yet she is not prosecuted... something is seriously wrong here. No wonder allies are looking elsewhere for funding etc... How can you trust a government like this.... Disgraceful.
19 | Rodney-Penny Bont | 10154728951256336_10154729541216336 | Confused why she goes to prison but fail to even change Hillary. But what doesn't surprise me is she a democratic member. Soon we will hear of convictions for voter fraud when all the dead voters appear.
20 | Greg Miller | 10154728951256336_987446014698951 | But Hillary Clinton lies to the FBI and lies UNDER OATH to Congress and the FBI,  st Loretta Lynch's direction, recommends no indictment. There's something VERY WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE!
21 | Robin Zeender | 10154728951256336_987448831365336 | Judge says Perjury is "the ultimate assault in the judicial system". Gee wonder if HRC will ever be held accountable for her her crimes of perjury?
22 | Judi Thomas Cortes | 10154728951256336_10154729533496336 | Wow, does this scenario sound familiar - well, except for being prosecuted and imprisoned.  This judge should've been on Hillary's case!
23 | Jan Maltone | 10154728951256336_10154729544021336 | Odd isn't it?Our laws are different depending on who you are or who you paid off.All of these people are corrupt.....get rid of ever politician ASAP.....vote them out or put them in jail...this is America and we need to abide by our constitution and our laws!
24 | Nasim Ghanbarpour | 10154728951256336_10154729536831336 | We have two different laws in this beautiful country ! Law for all the United States Citizens and Law for the Hillary Clinton. That's why she is running for the highest position in the world.
25 | Inez Belurgi | 10154728951256336_10154729536266336 | That's what they should be doing to Hillary!!! She's next or she will definitely be IMPEACHED!!! She has NO business running for PRESIDENT!!! Despicable Nasty woman

Mike Pence said "we've got support from independents, we've got support from many Democrats," and called for members of the GOP to come together and support Donald J. Trump.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Judi Wirtjes | 10154728778656336_10154729461856336 | This election is not democrats verses republicans. It is the American people verses the corrupt globalist elite. The globalists win and you can kiss the rest of your freedoms goodbye.
2 | Ray Rottler | 10154728778656336_10154729453061336 | What is funny is that CNN' Clinton News Network and others that are on a JIHAD quest against trump are showing their true colors. Trump will win, the polls are rigged. I truly think we will see another Reagan Era election, and Trump will win by a Landslide. Bleach Bit Clinton deserves no 2nd chance after failing her mission. Remember she is the one with the blood of 4 American's on her hands, Not Trump!
3 | Jarrod Hamlin | 10154728778656336_10154729456191336 | Watch their rally's, on average Trump has more than 50,000 viewers but Hillary Clinton can't get over 12,000 viewers, not to mention Donald is filling out arenas, where as Hillary Clinton can't even fill up and lunch room. You'll never see a Hillary cameraman, pan the audience. Because no one is there. The only poll Hillary is leading in is run by the Democratic media who polls more Democrats than Republicans. In real life Trump is going to win by a landslide. Look at their Facebook pages, Hillary Clinton only has the 7 million likes where as Donald Trump has over 12 million likes. The media is doing that so Donald Trump supporters won't vote, because they'll think it's a waste when in actuality if all trump supporters vote, Donald Trump will win by a landslide.Don't assume anything. VOTE VOTE VOTE. #Trump2016
4 | Krystal Dickenson | 10154728778656336_10154729456386336 | Our country Will Not Survive if Hiliary is allowed to steal this election. Folks, please think of your children, extended family & friends. We as a nation & a people have arrived at a time of choosing unlike any other of our lifetimes. If you choose to stay home, vote 3rd party or vote for Hiliary, you will be destroying any chance of our country's survival. I'm not asking you to vote for Donald Trump the man, I am begging you to vote for Donald Trump & Mike Pence' vision to save our beloved America and it's sovereignty. You need only look to Europe to see our future if Hiliary gains the White House. Open borders & Globalism is NOT the answer. A vote for Trump - Pence, and what they represent, will be the best gift / legacy you can give your children and your children's children. I beg you, please stand and be counted. VOTE ! ......... M
5 | Chad Myrick | 10154728778656336_10154729453831336 | One candidate wants to keep Obamacare...One candidate has pledged to get rid of it. They just announced premiums are going up 25% next year...again. What else do people really need to know in this election??? And people think they can't explain to their daughters why they voted for Trump? Maybe explain to them you voted for Trump so they wouldn't be financially devastated because of health insurance premiums. Maybe tell them you voted for Trump to protect the Supreme Court and their actual Constitutional freedoms like the ability to worship their God as they see fit or to protect them and their families via the right to bear arms. Maybe tell them you voted Trump to preserve national borders and an immigration system that doesn't hurt their future job prospects or standards of living. Or...you can tell them you couldn't support someone like Trump because he said offensive things in the past. It'll be easy to do since all you'll need to do is open your basement door and yell down to your adult daughter and her unemployed husband since that's where they'll be living if the country stays on its present course. Lastly...Hillary says she'll only increase taxes on the "rich." Ummm...what do you think rising Obamacare premiums are??? They are a direct tax on the middle class...and a tax that is skyrocketing annually thanks to the DEMOCRATS.#NeverHildabeast
6 | Mary Repko | 10154728778656336_10154729459061336 | Copied from another post; POST THIS WARNING EVERYWHERE! On election day, if your voting machine is a SmartMatic brand, DEMAND a paper ballot. George Soro’s now owns SmartMatic. You have the right to require a paper ballot, and under FEDERAL LAW the polling place MUST provide one for you. Don’t throw your vote away.
7 | Jan Schleier | 10154728778656336_10154729472536336 | It's time for the " Never Trump" folks to suck it up and put on their big boy pants and endorse our party's nominee! Seriously! A president Hilary will mean the end of our country as we know it.
8 | Michael Romero Usn Ret | 10154728778656336_10154729468886336 | I can't believe the stupidity of democrats thinking that stealing a few Trump signs from people's yards will discourage us from supporting him, the weasels better hope I don't catch them.
9 | Mike Fronimos | 10154728778656336_10154729503676336 | Trump/Pence will win by 8-12% popular vote, and win the Electoral College ... despite the Soros/Clinton/Obama illegal activities and MSM slanted views. The American silent majority will rise up on Nov. 8th!
10 | Genny King | 10154728778656336_10154729491646336 | I agree with him 100%...the gop needs to come together now! It's what the American people want...it's not for them they are there to represent us. I think the battle cry for change has been so loud that they truly need to listen to the American people. We don't want another Clinton..we don't want a politician that is corrupt and lies...we want Donald Trump who is in it for the American people!!!!!
11 | Jay Pearce | 10154728778656336_10154729479921336 | Thank you mike pence, it is about time... Killary will destroy this great nation... my wife and I cannot imagine a more qualified and level headed individual for VP... we expect a lot from you in that role...#draintheswamp
12 | Gary Allen | 10154728778656336_10154729469976336 | They better, As Trump Goes so goes the Republicans, The Party went Spineless 3 years ago, don't blame trump, support  him get him elected or lose your Country
13 | Daniel Beddard | 10154728778656336_10154729471746336 | I'm going to be blunt: come Election Day if the establishment republicans cost us the election and doom us to another four years of failed policies then I'll be voting for anyone, I mean anyone, who runs against them
14 | Sandy Finney | 10154728778656336_10154729461436336 | Sick of the back-stabbing GOP - their pride and thirst for power are more important than saving this country. We will remember you and we will vote you out of office.
15 | Linda Marocco | 10154728778656336_10154729514846336 | What is all this about the election being rigged by the Democrats?.. Is this true all the stories I am hearing!,., I am scared to death of Hillary winning, because of a rigged election.., How do we the people fight against that?.., this is a very scary time in this country!.., I am 60 yo and petrified for myself and my family if Hillary wins!.., God help us all!.,.. 🙏🙏🙏🙏
16 | Lucy Dickinson | 10154728778656336_10154729490456336 | Don't get discouraged friends. There is One above corruption. Please pray that Mr. Trump will win this election and bring America back from the brink
17 | Jerry Johnson | 10154728778656336_10154729502896336 | Trump has a zero chance of winning,the only thing he cares about is his new reality tv show if he was really serious he could have won the election by a landslide,why say all of the inflammatory things that only hurt him my goodness he went to to far   who knows when and if the republican party can recover if ever,we need a two party system.
18 | Wayne R Johnson | 10154728778656336_10154729458586336 | Trump has been called vicious for using words like Liar, corrupt, careless, nasty etc. to describe Hillary Clinton.Hillary has a 26 year history of broken promises, under the table back stabbing behind the scene deals, cover-up after cover-up, multimillion dollar Clinton foundation operations of Pay for Play, lies to protect lies, embraces hate groups and apparently violence at trump events And they call Trump vicious?This is messed up!Vote Trump/Pence and help Make America Great Again
19 | Yolanda Alsup | 10154728778656336_10154729459536336 | it's time for this to be over...im tried of it already..and to think people have the nerve to talk bad about President Obama and his family...they have showed way more class.♡
20 | Carol Talas | 10154728778656336_587278734807425 | After Trump is elected, I will no longer register as a republican. You republican officials should be ashamed of yourself. Are you all on Clinton's payroll? Trump has fought this battle almost on his own. Ms. Crooked is being supported by all the dems. Her party is 100% behind her. Donald is basically campaigning on his own. I am disgusted with all the republicans who are not standing with him!
21 | Ben Win | 10154728778656336_10154729478616336 | No one is going to support Trump if they didn't back when he started or mid way why now..... he has lost the trust of some of the most important GOP people. After all he has said he has made a bad name for Republicans and they really don't want to do anything with that.
22 | Ananias Jones | 10154728778656336_10154729457256336 | Stop promoting hate and they will. Donald Trump has given more aid to the Clinton campaign than to his own by promoting bigotry and hate.
23 | Trudy Cooley | 10154728778656336_1947354655492173 | People stop and think for a moment if Hillary wins she wants to bring in 620,000 refugees to our country and they could be "radical Islamic terrorist". It was on the news today that 296 Refugees Diagnosed with Active TB in Minnesota. I don't know about you all but this scares the hell out of me!!!! What effect will this have on our children and our grandchildren? So I decided to cast my vote for Mr, Trump to keep Hillary from winning and destroying this country of ours!!!!
24 | Travis Cotten | 10154728778656336_10154729453796336 | Republicans are the majority in congress. Its gonna be another 4-8 years of nothing. Not because Hillary wont try to do things. Its that congress won't allow it.
25 | Vince McMillan | 10154728778656336_525800014290401 | Why should they when they've been essentially thrown out in the cold? The current nominee is a democrat, the party doesn't stand by it's constituency, and like the Dems are bloated with corruption. I used to count myself amongst your ranks but nope not anymore y'all are still living in the dark ages and filling your own pockets. The only good one amongst you all is Rand Paul the rest are just out for themselves like Trump.

1 | Sophia Louise | 10154728682071336_10154729372326336 | How do people blindly continue to support Hillary? From emails, to Benghazi, from all that's been exposed in wiki-leaks. It's mind boggling, is this the type of person you want as POTUS? Trump's "words" don't compare to Hillary's actions. This election is so much more than putting someone in the White House. It's about our future, and our children's future. Vote Trump!
2 | Jonathan Seaman | 10154728682071336_10154729372526336 | Ill be taking a pic of my entry for proof when it comes out later SHE cheated!!!
3 | Jonathan Newburg | 10154728682071336_10154729388086336 | So some states have laws to ban a selfie with your ballots and you can get penalized, but an illegal immigrant votes, there is no penalizing for that person.  #rigged
4 | Chad Myrick | 10154728682071336_10154729372036336 | One candidate wants to keep Obamacare...One candidate has pledged to get rid of it.  They just announced premiums are going up next year 25%...again.  What else do people really need to know in this election??? And people think they can't explain to their daughters why they voted for Trump? Maybe explain to them you voted for Trump so they wouldn't be financially devastated because of health insurance premiums. Maybe tell them you voted for Trump to protect the Supreme Court and their actual Constitutional freedoms like the ability to worship their God as they see fit or to protect them and their families via the right to bear arms. Maybe tell them you voted Trump to preserve national borders and an immigration system that doesn't hurt their future job prospects or standards of living. Or...you can tell them you couldn't support someone like Trump because he said offensive things in the past. It'll be easy to do since all you'll need to do is open your basement door and yell down to your adult daughter and her unemployed husband since that's where they'll be living if the country stays on its present course.

5 | Tommy Gregory | 10154728682071336_10154729373446336 | Some voters have noticed that when they do straight party ticket electronic vote every office is marked EXCEPT for president! So when voting electronically double check to make sure your ballot reads the way you checked it especially for President!Feel free to SHARE!!!
6 | JP Chandler | 10154728682071336_10154729389976336 | It's harder for a political group to "steal" the election if people can photo and post their ballots. So of course it's illegal in swing states. Go figure.
7 | Anthony Higgins | 10154728682071336_10154729379121336 | So it's are right to vote but not our right to brag about our vote? Yea that makes sense. Way to go Hillary supporters you are officially slave sheep....smdfh #RealityCheck #Trump2016
8 | Stephen J Coia | 10154728682071336_10154729398821336 | Lol, screw the "law". I am taking a picture or video of my vote, not dicking around with potential voting fraud. Not in this election. Hillary and Obama dont follow the law, why should I. OH WELL
9 | Dina O Sotelo Thornton | 10154728682071336_10154729386376336 | I say its proof !! Just talking yesterday about that with the hubby , it would take away from the cheating !!! There is a photo to prove your vote!!
10 | Cathy Good Welker | 10154728682071336_10154729387616336 | POST THIS WARNING EVERYWHERE! On election day, if your voting machine is a SmartMatic brand, DEMAND a paper ballot.

11 | Amy Smith | 10154728682071336_10154729432756336 | So let me make sure I understand this... as a voter in NC....I can't take a "selfie" with my ballot; but I can vote without an ID? #priortiesamerica
12 | Tari Martin | 10154728682071336_10154729403241336 | this is freaking America! If I want to show my ballot to the devil! I should be able to! When men can go into women's bathrooms, college kids get offended by the truth and need a "safe zone" area, Bomb makers are invited to the white house, I AS AM AMERICAN WHO PAYS HER TAXES, BILLS AND RAISED MY KIDS TO RESPECT THE NATIONAL ANTHEM can show my ballot to who ever the F I want!!!
13 | Wes Mikel | 10154728682071336_10154729396151336 | Obamacare premiums are skyrocketing 25-50% in 2017. Do you honestly believe the very same democrats that told us, if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor, are the ones capable of fixing this disaster that they created in the first place?? Get real. A vote for Clinton is a vote for higher healthcare premiums, ultimately leading to a single payer healthcare system.
14 | Janice Burton | 10154728682071336_10154729389641336 | Why aren't photos of you and your vote allowed? Afraid of proof of rigged elections in our country??? SMH at the lies, corruption and dishonesty in the government.
15 | Brian Laskoski | 10154728682071336_10154729383176336 | So if Hillary gets elected, is the first order of business from the Senate and House is to start Impeachment Proceedings because she is unfit to be POTUS based on every law she has broken?  I doubt they would have the guts.
16 | Sonny Cox | 10154728682071336_10154729402506336 | I understand the "vote buying " argument , but could easily be investigated and found out with that much money going to people, "if they actually investigated".      But, meeee thinks the real reason is so it will not be proof of rigged elections.   If 1,000 people vote and 700 post selfies showing they voted for "A" candidate , but "B" candidate is announced as winner, it would be a tad bit harder to get away with it.
17 | Bernice Thieme | 10154728682071336_10154729437806336 | Voting is a private matter for the individual whom can choose to make it public. We the people are not guilty of selling our vote if we take a selfie, it's our way of stopping voter fraud one vote at a time.. everyone should take a selfie..
18 | Ken Barkhuff | 10154728682071336_10154729374101336 | No need to do such. Have just a little class. Anyone that knows you already knows how you're going to vote. You're not getting the gold star for a selfie with your ballot.
19 | Sara Turner | 10154728682071336_10154729423586336 | How can any True American or True Christian vote for Hillary? She is an evil woman and people who vote for her are so blinded! So glad I can see right through her! #Trump2016
20 | Rachel Marie Durkin | 10154728682071336_10154729450386336 | They just said on the news here in St. Louis that in Missouri and IL it was illegal to take a picture, they have told the poll people to watch out for people doing it. And apparently it can be a year in jail or up to a $1,500 fine. Ridiculous!!! What are they so worried about? It's my ballot!!!
21 | Victoria Patenaude | 10154728682071336_10154729404861336 | Well, that's one shady law! Hmmm. 😏Guess they don't want any evidence floating around ... of who's voting for whom. And just why would that be?!  🤔I'd say ... take your selfies anyway. Are they gonna put every voter (who snapped a photo while voting in those states) in jail?!  I highly doubt it!
22 | Mariah Bohana | 10154728682071336_10154729474786336 | what about Terry McAuliffe, an influential Democrat with longstanding ties to Bill and Hillary Clinton, gave nearly $500,000 to the election campaign of the wife of an official at the Federal Bureau of Investigation who later helped oversee the investigation into Mrs. Clinton’s email use.
23 | Natalie McLeister Smith | 10154728682071336_1797411613869916 | I get the argument that photos of ballots could be used for buying. I'm in a state.that says it is "illegal" but since it it's my inaliable right to do so, and the Constitution protects such right,  I'll snap a pic before I leave the booth anyway.
24 | Nora Jane Brown | 10154728682071336_10154729443396336 | Ummmmm. Private act???? It's OUR privacy we should be able to choose if we want it private or take a chance on our votes being stolen!  We're sick and tired of Satan's hell hounds!
25 | Michael Feneis | 10154728682071336_10154729414006336 | What's the penalty for taking a selfie or ballot vote in the banned states? And are any of these states banning clown masks for Halloween? If so, may I take a selfie with a scary clown mask on?

In a letter to school leaders, the ACLU-NJ and the local chapter of the NAACP said the school was using the salute to law enforcement to “intimidate and ostracize people who express their views about systemic racism and social justice.”

5 | Ryan Morris | 10154728416991336_10154729293961336 | Wtf is going on in this country? Everything is completely backwards, that's what's terrifying.
6 | Cristian Sepher | 10154728416991336_10154729293151336 | They want one world government full of sheep and no one to stand  up to them. Don't let this happen! GOD BLESS AMERICA!
7 | Charles Adams | 10154728416991336_10154729298286336 | This is a bunch of bull . See this is what we are going to get if Clinton is elected we people have a say in this matter on November the 8th I sure hope we use or common sense
8 | Harrison Gallaugher | 10154728416991336_10154729292376336 | This is why Hillary should never be in office. TRUMP2016.
9 | Karen Cooper | 10154728416991336_10154729314401336 | So it's only ok to organize a public display when you have something to gripe about but it's not ok to praise the good work that the majority of police and first responders do.  How quickly they've forgotten how middletowns police and first responders behaved during 9/11 going above and beyond to help in any way they could.  It's so disturbing that negativity is celebrated and positivity is condemned.
10 | Dave Parsons | 10154728416991336_10154729343591336 | Total crap, but typical of the ACLU and NAACP.  Both would be complaining if they didn't feel law enforcement was doing their bidding.  Wake up America.  Liberalism and "Progressivism" will be the death of our great country.
11 | Patrick Panda | 10154728416991336_10154729298251336 | Without rules and those who enforce them, you don't have a society or consequences. I'm a great shot and I want your stuff, but right now laws and police keep me from killing you and taking it.Be careful what you wish for.

We can use that money to rebuild America . 3 Trillions Dollars spend on Middle East we can use that money to rebuild America 3 times over . Another one of her dishonesty . WE NEED TRUMP FOR SURE .NO DOUBT ANYMORE .VOTE FOR TRUMP!
13 | Robyn Crew Johnson | 10154728416991336_10154729316056336 | It's so sad some people choose not to honor our law enforcement but those cops are the ones who get called when things get bad and people are put in harms way. Who are you going to call when someone breaks into your home or hurts your child or anything else police have to deal with. We may need them a couple of times in our life. They serve EVERYBODY EVERY DAY in those horrible type situations. And our military, don't get me started. People died for you to have the freedom to act like an a$$ and disrespect the anthem. It's disgraceful. Yes, they did also fight and die for your freedom of speech. Is there anything else you can do to voice your opinion without disrespecting people you don't know, will never know, who signed their name on the line for you?
14 | Katrina Haygood | 10154728416991336_10154729319386336 | Wait, I thought BLM said they weren't anti-police, but this sure sounds like they are. In fact, it sounds like they're anti-America. Hypocrite much? Maybe instead of imagining "oppression" everywhere, they ought to look in the mirror and see what they've actually become. Yeah, I know, fat chance of that ever happening. It's sad knowing that my generation made it "cool" to hate their own country.

16 | Morgan Sartin | 10154728416991336_10154729342086336 | The ACLU is intimidating these people for their beliefs by speaking out against it. So sick of these hypocrites. They want people to be racist so bad that they look for it. Disgusting I could spit on these intolerant people.

20 | Doug Joe Joey Allen | 10154728416991336_10154729324371336 | Does the ACLU have any expectation to prove, with actual evidence, "systemic racism?" Of course not.Fork it over or shut up. Hustle up.

25 | Joshua Silvio | 10154728416991336_10154729328011336 | If your ever curious why every commercial on tv has an inneracial couple, it's because the NAACP files hundreds of lawsuits per month against companies forcing them to do this !!!! I don't mind people doing what they want but I dont like it being forced down the throats of the people in this country for political agendas..... when was the last time you saw a commercial where a black man had a black wife or white man had a white wife..... stop forcing it NAACP and the tv advertisers need to learn to stand their ground

A top Clinton ally’s political organization gave nearly a half-million dollars to the campaign of the wife of an FBI official who would go on to help oversee the probe into Hillary Clinton’s email practices.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | A.J. Pinto | 10154728516546336_10154729194746336 | Michelle Obama said if Donald Trump is elected: "We're telling our sons it's okay to humiliate women. We're telling our daughters this is how they deserve to be treated.".... that's funny. So does that mean that if Hillary Clinton is elected, we are teaching our sons & daughters that it's ok to murder, lie, cover up, be corrupt, demean women, use racial slurs, and stay with a spouse that openly rapes women & cheats on you?

3 | Steve Callen | 10154728516546336_10154729208821336 | So, let me get my head around this for a minute... shortly after the Clinton Email server scandal was made public..VA Governor Terry McCauliffe, long time Clinton friend..goes and gets this doctor, just a Pediatric Doctor that he has ZERO ties to, and apparently doesn't even know and decides that "hey, she would make a great senator, so he asks her to run for senate, then he donates half a million dollars to her campaign fund...and she just happens to be the wife of a very high FBI official, who coincidentally gets promoted to Deputy and is put as the overseer of the Clinton Email case... LMAO...wait it gets better.....keep reading.#1, The 13th district DNC had already selected a candidate to run for senate, he was already campaigning, he was already putting money into his campaign, he was a retired Colonel and Vietnam veteran named Tom Mulrine... But out of nowhere, Gov. McCauliff over rides them..and decides that this pediatric doctor with zero government or political experience would make a better candidate for Senate... even though he doesn't know her..and...she just happens to be the wife of the FBI associate deputy director that would get promoted to deputy director, and his first assignment as the new deputy director is to oversee the Clinton Email case...#2- The Clinton's DONATED money to the PAC, that McCauliffe used to "fund" McCabe's campaign...and not only did Bill Clinton directly donate money, Bill and Hillary hosted benefit dinners and invited their billionaire donors to attend, they sold plates for $25,000 each, and gave all the money to McCauliffe's PAC fund... in total, Clinton Donors contributed MILLIONS and MILLIONS of dollars to McCauliffe's PAC... the fund that was used to pay money to, the wife of, the Associate Deputy FBI director, that gets promoted to Deputy, and is assigned as the overseer of the Clinton private email server case.So to summarize, Terry McCauliffe...long time Clinton friend who has had a very close relationship with the Clinton's since 1990 when he worked on Bill Clinton's campaign, this guy who has received millions of dollars from the Clintons and their donors, veto's the 13th district's selected candidate Tom Mulrine, he replaces him with his own hand picked candidate, who is a pediatric doctor that he doesn't know, who has zero political experience but he feels she would make a great senator from what he doesn't know about her, he then donates 500,000 dollars from his own PAC, which is loaded with millions of dollars from the Clintons and their donors...and this doctor just happens to be the wife of an FBI associate director, who coincidentally right after his wife's campaign ends, gets promoted to deputy director and assigned to oversee the Clinton private email server case... the case where the FBI granted immunity to all of the Clinton Aides, agreed to destroy evidence that was under a congressional subpoena, and then recommended no charges were filed against Hillary Clinton.Seems legit.....
4 | Roger Kinnison | 10154728516546336_10154729207556336 | Andrew  McCabe should be fired immediately , and an investigation should be done on the FBI's handling of this entire charade.

6 | Brenda Rick Nevel | 10154728516546336_10154729219071336 | This came from the Advocate (our local paper) and I am sharing it because it is exactly how most of us feel about Trump.  The Media just doesn't get it....they can't believe that people are so angry that they can no longer be manipulated!Millions of trump supporters feel this way about Donald J. Trump....."We don't care if the guy swears... or how many times he's been married...or who he voted for, or what his income tax return shows. We want the problems fixed. Yes he's an egomaniac, but we don't care. We know he's not a racist, or bad to women, or all the other things the liberal media is trying to label him with. We know he's raised a good family, and that says a lot about him.The country is a mess because politicians suck, the Republican Party is two faced & gutless, and illegals are everywhere and Muslims are openly trying to hurt this country and make the civilized world adjust to them. We want it all fixed!We don't care that Trump is crude, we don't care that he has changed positions, we don't care that he fights with Megan Kelly, Rosie O'Donnell, and so many of the elected establishment. We don't care that Rubio, Ryan, the Bush's, and so many other top old and new Republicans refuse to endorse him for their own selfish reasons, and we know what they are. We don't care that he doesn't know the name of some Muslim terrorists, we don't care that he tried some businesses that didn't work out.This country is weak, bankrupt, our enemies are making fun of us, we are being invaded by illegals, we are becoming a nation of victims, where every Tom, Ricardo and Hasid is a special group with special rights to a point where we don't even recognize the country we were born and raised in, AND WE JUST WANT IT FIXED. And TRUMP is the only guy who seems to understand what the people want.We're sick of politicians, sick of the Democratic and Republican Party. We're angry about the Iran deal, the budget, treatment of Israel, military weakness, lobbyists, special interests, overpaid politicians with their self serving bills and back room deals, trade deals, loss of jobs, manipulated economic numbers, businesses fleeing, and even the phoney pay for play Clinton Foundation.Americans are no longer going to be fooled, and the movement is out to change the direction we're taking. Trump may not be a saint, but he doesn't have lobbyist money holding him, he doesn't have political correctness restraining him, and all you know is that he has been very successful, a good negotiator, he has built a lot of things, he's flexible, and he's also not a politician. And he says he'll fix it. And we believe him because he is too much of an egotist to be proven wrong or looked at and called a liar.Public service has become elected greed. This may be our only chance to have a non-politician, despite his flaws, try and correct the mess, at least for 4 years. We must take the shot, because the consequences of putting Hillary Clinton in office are frightening. There is a tidal wave happening, and its going to overcome much of what's happened to this country."

No more Clinton's!!
9 | Marcia Peters | 10154728516546336_10154729215791336 | You failed to mention that our crooked governor also tried to restore the voting rights of 200k convicted felons who most likely would vote democrat in 2016.

12 | Fred Buterbaugh | 10154728516546336_10154729232696336 | Hmmm - Let's see: personal tax returns vs. intentionally lying to congress: personal locker room talk vs. allowing 4 people to be killed in Benghazi: speaking the truth vs. deleting 33,000 emails jeopardizing national security.... it's like comparing apples to oranges. What Trump said or did is on a personal level, Killarys crimes are as a political figure. If she can get away with all the crap that she has so far, I shudder to think of what she will do as POTUS. 😡

There is a reason because they do suck and report nothing bad about that woman. #CNNSucks
15 | Mark Dennis | 10154728516546336_884705348295741 | Are you kidding me . you support How quickly we forget! If you’re over 35, take a walk with me down memory lane—you won’t believe what you have forgotten. If you’re under 35, read on—I promise you that you will be amazed at what you missed! (By the way, sadly, this isn’t a joke. I wish it was.)REMEMBER WHEN BILL CLINTON WAS PRESIDENT?(January 20, 1993 to January 20, 2001—two terms)When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over an attempt to reform health care. Her proposed plan was so bad that many Democrats came up with competing plans of their own in protest, and in spite of threats and intimidation, on September 26, 1994, the “Hillarycare” bill was declared dead.This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million for studies, promotion, and other efforts.Then, President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general. Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood—both were forced to withdraw their names from consideration. Next, she chose Janet Reno, which husband Bill described as "my worst mistake." (Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.)Husband Bill also allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission—Lani Guanier was her selection. After considerable backlash from prominent Democratic senators concerning Ms. Guanier's radical views, Bill Clinton withdrew her name from nomination, stating that she did not represents the civil rights views that he had championed during his campaign.However, apparently a slow learner, husband Bill continued to allow Hillary to make more recommendations. She chose former law partners, Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department. Her selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kennedy was forced to resign. (Is anyone wondering yet what her Supreme Court Justice appointments would be like?)Many younger voters will have no knowledge of "Travelgate," the first major ethics controversy during Bill’s presidency.Hillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend, Harry Thompson—but the White House Travel Office refused to comply. She trumped up allegations of financial mismanagement and reported seven long-time White House employees to the FBI. This ruined their reputations, got them fired, and caused a thirty-six month investigation. Eventually, most of the employees were reinstated and Clinton associates were forced out of the travel office. Only one White House employee, Billy Dale, was charged with a crime—the enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds; a jury acquitted him in less than two hours.Still not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House Security. When Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies (Filegate) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff, suddenly Hillary and the President denied even knowing Livingstone, and of course, denied knowledge of drug use in the White House.Following this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents.Next, when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by Bill Clinton, Hillary was put in charge of the "bimbo eruption" and scandal defense. Let’s look at some of her more notable decisions in this regard . . . She urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation, they settled with Ms. Jones. She refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor. After $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr's investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs. Hillary's devious game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for 'lying under oath' to a grand jury, followed by his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives. Hillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, "I do not recall," "I have no recollection," and "I don't know" a total of 56 times while under oath. (Sound familiar?) After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had "mistakenly thought was hers."So you see, the email scandal and all of her malfeasance regarding the handling of Top Secret information, not to mention the "pay to play" schemes of the Clinton Foundation, are nothing new. Hillary’s entire political career has been nothing but a web of lies, corruption and destruction in her quest for power.Is anyone else ready to say, “Enough is enough!”?But unfortunately, I’m sure her loyal fans will say, "What difference does it make?"
16 | Josh Sanders | 10154728516546336_10154729201156336 | Today at her rally when talking about Wallstreet and bankers (people that pay her salary) Hillary said "No one is above the Law" Ahahahahaha I almost died swear to God lol 😂😂😂😂
17 | Nick Little | 10154728516546336_10154729268816336 | ⚠️If you are Gay, Why are you voting for Hillary when she wants to bring in thousands of refugees that believe all Gays should be executed?👁⚠️If you are Black, Why are you voting for Hillary when she admires Margaret Sanger and defends Planned Parenthood who want to abort as many black babies as possible? Exterminate the black race because they are like "weeds". (Margaret Sanger quote) Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.👁⚠️If you are a Christian, Why are you voting for Hillary Clinton when she wrote her Senior thesis on Saul Alinsky who dedicated his book 'Rules for Radicals' to Lucifer (the Devil)? She says he was, and still is her mentor.👁⚠️If you are a Veteran, in the Military, or closely related to a Military member, Why are you voting for Hillary when she left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again? They called for help but the help was told to stand down.👁⚠️If you have a factory job, Why are you voting for Hillary when she supported TPP? Factory workers are being laid off because jobs are going over seas. Don't forget the deals she's made with china. She also welcomes open borders and illegals to get benefits to be paid with Your tax money.👁⚠️If you are poor, Why are you voting for Hillary, when she is supporting Wall street and all the big banks? Big banks keep poor people poor by destroying the poor man's credit by allowing medical bills and collections to affect your credit scores so you can pay higher interest rates than the rich; Taking much of the little money you earn.👁⚠️If you are a Woman, how can you vote for Hillary when she has buried all of Bills rape victims under the rug, including that little girl that was raped? Lawyer Hillary defended the rapist, and then she laughed about it later, knowing that he was guilty.If you carry a gun, or believe in the Constitution; How can you vote for Hillary when she wants to eliminate the NRA, Take your guns, and abolish the second Amendment?👁⚠️If you breathe, Why would you vote for Hillary when she and the Clinton crime family have left a trail of dead people that did not agree with her, or they knew too much?Who is left? 👁
18 | Kenny Townsend | 10154728516546336_10154729223831336 | Politicians take care of politicians so they can continue to milk this country dry. Until people stop identifying as either democrat or republican we will continue to have a corrupt government at all levels. Drop both parties and vote for people based off their morals, ethics, and integrity and you won't have people like Trump and Clinton leading any elections. Put some integrity and ethics back into government...vote ALL incumbents out!!!

22 | William Oldham | 10154728516546336_1284455751588108 | Swamp looking massive, corruption deep, and tactics Of campaign more like unfounded smears and dirty tricks,Nazi like. Yet we have become so jaded that no one is demanding she drop out, and independent prosecutors be appointed by Congress. Obviously White House, Justice Debt, and FBI corrupted. Heads should resign immediately. People wondered about IRS head taking fifth with no follow up. Now have smoking gun of widespread corruption, and funneling of funds from court cases to left wing political entities. Donald right election rigged, look like backward banana republic. Need more whistle blowers and bi partisan cooperation to clean up up government. Democratic Party no better than Nazis, people need to vote them out to clean up government and rid system of big money and foreign influence. Clinton's like Hogg family on steroids.
23 | John-Sylvester Novak | 10154728516546336_884732508293025 | Is there no end to the corruption and underhanded dealings of the Administration,the Clinton's and the Democratic Party?

25 | Sandi Sullivan | 10154728516546336_1108855082567765 | This is reprehensible and there should definitely be repercussions in this corrupt political pay for play. The Clintons donate $675,000 dollars to an FBI officials wife for her political campaign if her FBI husband makes all the charges against Hillary Clinton go away. Will criminal charges be brought against her now or will she forever be held above the law with no accountability whatsoever? What type of kickbacks did Loretta Lynch and James Comey get because I doubt they'd put their jobs on the line without something in return. What normal intelligent person would vote this despicable, corrupt, lying piece of filth into the Presidency of this country. The biased media (CNN etc.) Probably won't even give this a mention because they won't report anything that puts her in a bad light no matter what criminal activity she's involved in. The Clintons I'm sure will pay to make this disappear also. She is pure evil and leaves you wondering what else she has in store for us as a nation.

We're telling our daughters this is how they deserve to be treated.".... that's funny. So does that mean that if Hillary Clinton is elected, we are teaching our sons & daughters that it's ok to murder, lie, cover up, be corrupt, demean women, use racial slurs, and stay with a spouse that openly rapes women & cheats on you?

Did you miss hearing about her being fired from the Watergate staff for being dishonest and unethical?How about those 33,000 emails she deleted and then had the computer wiped clean by professionals? Did you miss that? How about deleting emails after she was subpoenaed to hand them over to the Fed? You realize that’s Obstruction of Justice, right? Oh, and how about getting the rapist of a teenage girl off on rape charges then laughing about it? Did you miss that too?How about when she lied to the American people about Benghazi? You realize that story about the video was a lie, and she knew it was a lie, right?Did you miss her lying to the American people about her emails? How about when she lied about being under sniper fire?Well, then there was those times she lied about lying to the American people. Miss those too?What about that ‘pay for play’ with the Clinton Cash Foundation? That’s kind of hard to miss, huh?Did you miss all those other scandals she was in? You know… TravelGate, FileGate, WhiteWater, Rose law Firm, Vince Foster… she has a long list of scandals, you know... Did you miss her belittling her husband's sexual harassment ( and rape ) accusers? Oh – but the Paula Jones case was settled for $850,000 and Bill was impeached… for lying…You know she was labeled "Extremely careless" about national security by the FBI, right? Have you caught her latest lies about not knowing what the (C) meant on the classified documents? Or, that she can’t remember any briefings on how to handle classified material? Did you know that during her interview with the FBI she said she couldn’t remember 39 times? Did you know that during the Star Investigation she used that same defense of ‘I don’t recall’ 56 times? Did you hear her say she will raise taxes on the middle class? Did you know she had to return stolen items from the White House the last time they left? Have you seen the movies and several documentaries made about her questionable ethics? Don’t you wonder why she made congress and others spend millions and millions of tax dollars having hearings and investigating her numerous times, finding that she lied, that would not have been spent if she would have simply told the truth in the first place ! Facts - all facts ! But you are going to vote for her because.... you don't like Donald Trump ? Now, That is insane !

Keep your eye on the ball people. Keep asking her about her illegal activities and the Clinton Foundation.

22 | Linda Doll | 10154729034351336_10154729110766336 | "Last night a friend claimed that Donald Trump wouldn’t make a good president; he is brash, he is racist, he is a loudmouth; you know the normal things people learn to recite after being programmed by television news. The one I loved was that, “Trump is arrogant.” My friend questioned if one man could make “that much difference in the world today.” To my friend's credit, she was respectful enough to let me respond when she asked, “Really, what has Trump done?”I said, “In June of last year, Trump entered the race for president. In just a little over a year, Trump has single handedly defeated the Republican party. He did so thoroughly. In fact, he did so in such a resounding way that the Republican Party now suffers from an identity crisis. He literally dismantled the party. Trump even dismantled and dismissed the brand and value of the Bush family.Trump has Obama petrified that Trump will dismiss programs that weren’t properly installed using proper law.Trump has single handedly debunked and disemboweled any value of news media as we knew it—news now suffering from an all-time level of distrust and disrespect.Trump has leaders from all over the world talking about him, whether good or bad. Trust me, powerful men who have been president before weren’t liked by the global community. I doubt Mikhail Gorbachev liked Reagan when Reagan said, "Tear down that wall."Trump has expressly disclosed the fraud perpetrated on the American public by Hillary Clinton. He has, quite literally, brought Hillary to her knees—if you believe that nervous tension and disorders offer physical side effects and damage.Trump has unified the silent majority in a way that should be patently frightening to “liberals.”As the press accuses Trump of being a house of cards, Trump has proven the press is the real house of cards. He has whipped up the entire establishment into pure panic. Trump has exposed them for who they are and worse, what they are. George Clooney was right when he said Trump draws live news coverage of his podium that he’s not yet approached. Thanks, George, you were perfectly correct.What we see as headline news today are actually the last bubbles from the ship that is now sunk—meaning the standard news media, as a propaganda machine, has been exposed. They have no more value.In the same way Trump asked the African-American community this question, I asked my friend, ”At this point, what do you have to lose?” We have mass cop shootings, riots in our streets, ambushed cops, double digit inflation, bombs blowing up in our cities, targeted police, #BLM, a skyrocketing jobless rate, no economic growth, privately owned land being seized by the federal government, the worst racial tension in my lifetime, no God in schools, more abortions than ever, illegal aliens pouring into our country, sick veterans receiving no care, and a debt that doubled in seven years to $19 trillion. Are you really happy with the condition of the current system?One man has done all of this in one year—one guy, and on his own dime. And with everything I’ve written above, you believe Trump hasn't done anything? You claim that you are afraid of Donald Trump? No wonder we’re in trouble. You can say that Trump is a lousy presidential candidate. That’s your right. Just don’t ever say he’s not effective.That Megan Kelly, FOX News, CNN, MSNBC, Washington Post, Rachel Maddow, the Huffington Post, the New York Times, Raleigh’s News and Observer, the AP, Don Lemon, Jake Tapper, and many more, failed to implement their collectively orchestrated lie on the American people against Trump, is actually a massive testament to Trump. The press colluded pure propaganda to accomplish his demise … and they have collectively failed and miserably.Here's just one example of how badly America is injured right now. There are high school football players on their knees during the national anthem simply because the press used as propaganda to program those kids to do that very thing. But, these kids are mimicking NFL stars the same way the same kids chooses which brand of football shoe to purchase—they're overtly brain-washed to do that very thing.Now, we have a generation of children who hate America.America’s problem isn’t that little children are on their knee in collective disrespect of America. Our problem is that America is on her knee from collective disrespect by Americans.You can disrespect America all you want. But, it’s high-time you respect the silent majority. Because they’re not simply the “silent majority” as you’ve been trained to believe when Hillary calls them “deplorables.” The fact is, they are simply the majority. And now they're no longer silent either. Donald Trump changed all of that, single-handedly and within one year."

4 | Mark Jones | 10154728788556336_10154728842001336 | Reagan, who was thought of as " too divisive," ( sound familiar?) was behind 15 points in the polls just  before Election Day. He won in a landslide, taking 44 States, over 50% of the popular vote, and 489 electoral college votes. Never before has it been SO completely obvious how corrupt our media, government, and now pundits and pollsters are in our nation's history. Voter fraud has also been clearly exposed by Project Veritas. Millions of people are fed up with the blatant corruption in DC, the media, and absolutely don't want another 30 year career lying politician giving us another 4 to 8 years of the same nonsense that's been going on for the last 8 years. Over 150 electoral votes are up for grabs in toss up States. The media, democRats, establishment, and the over sampling of democrat pollsters are using smoke and mirrors in attempt to persuade Trump voters not to vote Nov 8th. Don't fall for it. Trump/Pence 2016! 🇺🇸

Think about it. Thank you
7 | George Haynes | 10154728788556336_10154728848336336 | Hahahah.. Robby Mook ( well known queer ) says they didn't know where Trumps tax returns came from but is sure that Hillary's email leaks came from Russia.. so believable..lol
8 | Vicky Mihelic | 10154728788556336_10154728907586336 | Fox news and other news media are wrong on polls Donald is ahead of Hillary. If you count the democrats and Bernie supporters who switched to the republican ticket unaccounted for in the electoral college vote. Those are not accounted for the registered democrats voter.  Don't believe the polls . On voting day ask for paper ballot. Don't trust the media they are in with Hillary.
9 | Len Larsen | 10154728788556336_10154728897906336 | Len Larsen Peter Marandola 1 – Donald Trump kept the Harlem Hoops project alive after learning the man who ran the program was killed during September 11th. The program gives urban youths a safe place to play basketball while instilling a positive influence in their lives.2 – When no commercial carrier was willing to fly a critically ill little boy from California to New York for medical treatment, Trump offered up his private jet to the family. The little boy’s medical care needs during the flight and space for necessary equipment were completely accommodated on Trump’s airplane.3 – When Ed McMahon was losing his home, Donald Trump stepped in to save the property from going into foreclosure. Trump then allowed McMahon to go on living in his home.4 – Donald Trump saved an ice skating rink in Central Park after the city planners in charge went grossly over budget and were not going to be able to open the rink for the Christmas season. Trump finished the project on his own dime and then operated the rink at his own expense for a year and donated all of the profits to charity.5 – Trump partnered up with Mel Farr and offered the opportunity for urban Detroit artists to appear at Carnegie Hall. The young artists would never have had such an opportunity to showcase their work without Trump serving as their benefactor.6 – Donald Trump broke the glass ceiling for women in the construction business. In 1980, he hired 33-year-old Barabara Res to head up a NYC skyscraper project as the site manager of the building.7 – After learning about a Buffalo bus driver stopping to help a woman attempting to jump off a bridge and kill herself, he tracked down the hero who talked the woman down. Trump gave the man a $10,000 check as a show of gratitude for the act of human kindness he felt should serve as an example to us all.

All the 'I'm picking out drapes for the White House' rhetoric, the manipulation of the polls, MSM rhetoric, isn't designed to convert Trump voters to Clinton voters. Do not drink their Kool-Aid! It's to stop marginal interest voters from voting at all, which is, in itself, a vote for Clinton. Please urge everybody to vote!

16 | Barbara Santkuyl | 10154728788556336_10154728904486336 | Copied and pasted fromWilliam D. Wheeler Sr.:I'm going to push this until the Nov election on every post I can. If you don't want the truth about Hillary don't read it.  A Lie Named Hillary ..  I oppose her because she cannot tell the truth to save her life. Any public servant who has the gall to issue a list of terms the press cannot utter, as if disposing the corpse of free will, is helplessly deluded and a petulant child. Sorry, Hillary, but no one owes you anything; especially the nation you proclaim to serve with nothing but the benevolence of blind ambition. If your candidacy cannot survive without the aid of deception, division, and the fabricated catcalls of “sexism” to demonize your critics, then please tell us why America needs you? Better yet, please explain how you’re even worthy of the job? A leader doesn’t need pollsters, a panel of advisers, two news conferences and a room full of media drones just to announce whether or not she used an unauthorized server to conduct official government business and therefore deleted emails in an attempt to avoid prosecution. A leader would never break the law in the first place. And a leader doesn't shout, "At this point, what difference does it make" when four lives are lost in the wake of her unmitigated failure. Any self-respecting adult with an ounce of integrity would simply admit the truth. Excuse me, any self-aware child who knows the difference between right and wrong, life and death. She was thrown off the Congressional Watergate panel for lying and she hasn't stopped lying since !!!!!. And some people want her as our President - she can't & won't even tell the Truth as Secretary of State - and remember all she has done there to pad her financial pockets and political career - That should never have begun.If I’m hiring someone to run my business, placing my future in foreign hands, I don't care whether you're a Democrat or Republican, a man or woman, white or black. I want the most qualified candidate whose character speaks for itself and whose ideals can stand on the merits of their own wisdom. That’s common sense. Are you going to have the audacity to tell me what I can and can’t ask; what verbiage is acceptable? If your resume and vision are truly best for the entire nation, not just one party, gender or race, either should be able to withstand the most blistering questions and exhaustive scrutiny. In fact, you should welcome any and all discourse to discredit your detractors and display your competence. A leader unites, empowers and inspires by example, not by excuses or endless blame. Tell me the national debt is a record 19 Trillion and that Barack Obama has raised it more than the first 43 presidents combined. Admit that an estimated 94 million Americans are out of the workforce, nearly 50 million are on public assistance, and that the economic recovery is a sham. Admonish Iran as a destabilizing force of Islamic radicalism that must never be mentioned in the same sentence as “nuclear power". Recognize the reality every civilized nation has immigration laws and that American sovereignty, the safety and security of her people, supersedes any political ploy to stuff the ballot box beneath the hollow cries of racism.Yes, just like generations of legal immigrants before your candidacy, respect is given when trust is earned. If you are incapable of acknowledging simple, documented facts - solely because it’s easier to hide behind a propaganda platform that cajoles and incites an expendable public - you're not interested in solving anything, let alone serving the American people or any notion of truth. You and the likes of you are the cancer killing the country I love. You’re the lie my forefathers warned us about. Hillary Clinton has a long and inglorious history of alleged document tampering and questionable legal maneuverings.. AMERICAN VOTERS WE NEED TO KEEP HER OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE.. SHE BELONGS IN JAIL - PLEASE - PLEASE SHARE THIS WITH EVERYONE !!!

1 | Daniel Getzler | 10154728715701336_10154728717771336 | another reason why we need to elect Trump on November 8th
2 | Justin Despotakis | 10154728715701336_10154728717351336 | But I thought we were promised that premiums would go down?  More lies!!!!!!!!!!!
3 | Ripley Harrington | 10154728715701336_10154728719966336 | Obamacare is an absolute disaster and Hillary Clinton will expand it. I am not really sure what a Hillary Clinton America would look like. The thought of it is terrifying. It's like Obama on steroids.
4 | Mickey Finn | 10154728715701336_10154728716861336 | I've waited all my life to see Britain pull out the EU, i can proudly say my brexit vote was no regret and if i die in my sleep at my grand age, i can honestly say i am proud to be British. We defeated the germans and we have defeated our left wing traitors and immigrants...Good work Brexiters 👍🏻Now it's Americas turn...Vote DONALD TRUMP!
5 | Jessy Wilson | 10154728715701336_10154728722166336 | We had Blue Cross Blue Shield at my work for years and because of Obama Care the entire company had to switch to Tufts. Many people lost their specialist doctors and therapist. I'm so sick of Blowbama Care.
6 | Berlon Roberts | 10154728715701336_10154728723566336 | Wake up America, #VoteTrump. This election is not about either candidate it's about the appointments to the United States Supreme Court. This President will have an effect on our country for decades and if Hillary is elected she will promote her global no borders, anti-life agenda. Drag someone to the polls with you and Vote
7 | Armetia Woodby | 10154728715701336_10154728723876336 | Yep he fixed health care real good!!!!! And remember if you cant afford it you get a penalty LMAO good Ole Obama and people think Hilary is better lmao.
8 | Heidi Cooper | 10154728715701336_10154728719741336 | How can people afford Obamacare?!! We can thank our greedy government politicians!! Obamacare didn't help anyone!
9 | Donna Griffis | 10154728715701336_10154728720291336 | After steadily climbing already over the past 6 yrs in anticipation of Obamacare, for lesser coverage. Ugh. Repeal this already!!!
10 | Traci Spitzer-Updegrove | 10154728715701336_10154728730136336 | Socialist medicine!!  Next it will take you months to even see a doctor and u will go to the doctor the government has chosen!  That's is the whole reason behind Obamacare!!  VOTE TRUMP !!!
11 | Mike Passeri | 10154728715701336_10154728726811336 | Yup. Remember...IT WAS DESIGNED TO FAIL! Next is that all that lose their coverage or can't afford their ObamaCare will be dumped into Medicaid/Medicare, enroute to single payer. THIS WAS THE PLAN!
12 | Ellen Trimmer Burchfield | 10154728715701336_976204632525747 | Hey Middle America, just say..YOU'RE WELCOME!! You're Welcome to all the low income families that we're (Middle America) now supporting who gets free/low fee medical care..BUT my family had to find alternate health care because Obama wanted $1100 a month with $10k deductible..$20k out of pocket before any benefit for my family..Couldn't afford it.So we'll pay for you and we're forced to find alternative so-so care that doesn't provide preventive care, just immediate care. Is there anything else I can pay for you?? Oh yea, college. $100k per child my family, your kids - FREE! Oh wait, open borders??Come one, Come all..Need help? Don't even have to ask, just thank Middle America we've got you covered..need food stamps, medical attention, subsides housing - Let me dig a little deeper when the well is already dry..You're Welcome! Going broke for all who are already broke.There has got to a better way for everyone! It's where the demoncrats want us...
13 | John Powers | 10154728715701336_666067576892267 | All you morons wanting Democrat Congressman and Senators remember it was Democrats that passed Obamacare. Not one single Republican voted to shove this nightmare down our throats. If you Democrats don't like the rate increases, I don't feel sorry for you because you voted them into office. As for the rest of us, we got screwed because of your stupidity.
14 | Shawna Compton | 10154728715701336_1840656836176518 | Only people who like Obamacare is the ones who don't work and get free health care so when this happens we all go broke it's actually a form of communism .
15 | Linda Monahan | 10154728715701336_10154728728776336 | My insurance jumps every year ridiculous hike thanks to Obamacare. Not only that co pays are higher, out of pocket higher, doctors afraid to order tests. Doctors getting paid next to nothing & closing practices. It is FRIGGIN NIGHTMARE!!
16 | Ann Lochridge | 10154728715701336_10154728736211336 | I'm better off dropping insurance and paying the damm fine. How am I supposed to feed my family if it goes go even more. Thanks for nothing Obummer
17 | John Smith | 10154728715701336_544515952409800 | Let's see...what lies were we told?1) Obamacare will stem the rising insurance rates.2) If you like your plan, you can keep your plan.3) If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.4) Obamacare will save Americans an average of $2500 per year.5) Obamacare will ensure that all Americans have health insurance.I could keep going, but I doubt my battery has enough charge to continue.Elect Donald Trump and stop this nonsense!
18 | Diane Lynn | 10154728715701336_544515685743160 | My husband and I pay 1750.00 a month for Blue Cross...which is outrageous... It pays for nothing because my deductibles are very high..This obamacare doesn't help the people actually paying for it...The president, the senators and the congresspeople should have this crappy obamacare, but NO they have great insurance and probably don't  even pay for it... I am so sick of this crap...Some people don't care because it doesn't impact them because they have employer insurance or get it basically free, but people, the ones that are paying for the people who can't afford it won't be doing it for long because we are going to run out of money then who will pay for you... So everyone should care about this issue...
19 | Mike Bednar | 10154728715701336_10154728724681336 | And lying old lady Clinton will take the next step in turning Obamacare into a single payer, socialist health care system. Trump/Pence for our White House, Obama/Clinton for the big house.
20 | Kitty Alt | 10154728715701336_10154728727276336 | And the you have that stupid Juan Williams saying that Obama care is a success! What a complete idiot as well as all of these dummies voting for Clinton soon there will be no insurance companies participating and the entire country is screwed.
21 | Robert Fritsche Jr | 10154728715701336_10154728732486336 | It was predicted and the know-it-all Liberals forced it down our throats anyway.Of course, we also know that this is part of the master plan to install a single-payer system. Um...won't work. Enjoy your horrid legacy, Mr. President.
22 | JM McCormack | 10154728715701336_10154728727516336 | 975.00 to 1,290 don't think Deductible went up to 5,000 and co- pays 45.00Deductible for meds 2,000people check your mail your letters are arriving ..Your dose of reality is on the way..
23 | Melvin R. Blann III | 10154728715701336_10154728738911336 | If you accept the premise that obama hates America, and hates Americans, then everything he has said, and done, and everything he has not said and not done, makes perfect sense. To better understand the origin of his beliefs, and their foundation, read, in his own words, obama's books, "Dreams From My Father" and "Audacity of Hope". Then look at what he has done in light of what he has said. barack obama is also a follower of, and a believer in Saul Alinsky, a communist community organizer who wrote a book titled "Rules for Radicals". Additionally read the books "The Roots of Obama's Rage" by Dinesh D'Souza; "Why the Left Hates America" by Daniel J. Flynn; "The Amateur" by Edward Klein; "Culture of Corruption" by Michelle Malkin; and "The Post-American Presidency" by Pamela Geller. These authors coorelate, in detail, the experiences, circumstances, and situations, many of which shaped obama's mind, clearly demonstrated throughout his presidency. Read/examine these publications, then tell me you can honestly believe barack obama, and the left, have America's interests in his mind, let alone in their heart. More directly obama is doing exactly what he stated 5 days before he was elected for his first term as president - his promise that "we are 5 days from fundamentally transforming America". barack obama is the greatest threat this country has ever faced. That he was elected at all is one thing, but that the American people have tolerated repeated insult, injury, and acts of lawlessness from this man, without objection, yet elected him for a second term says far more about us than it does about him. During his formative youth, obama was raised and schooled principally in Hawaii and Indonesia where he was simmered in racism, communism, marxism, and islam. As a result, "president", obama has exploded our debt, weakened our military, undermined the Constitution, worsened race relations, fanned class warfare, promoted communism, alienated friends, coddled enemies, ignored our laws, erased our borders, flooded our cities with unvetted muslims, punished success, wreaked havoc on our healthcare system, championed islam, denigrated Christians and Christianity, coursened our culture, demonized police, poisoned our politics, weaponized the IRS, EPA, BLM and other government agencies, and turned our schools into indoctrination centers. This is not the result of incompetence, this has occurred by design.
24 | Michael Buote | 10154728715701336_10154728739551336 | This. Obamacare is nothing but a bail out for ins.co's pharma co's,hey the nice thing is all you sheep democrats that voted for obama and will vote for clinton your rates are going up too,unless your getting a free ride,hows that working for you?
25 | Michael Bean | 10154728715701336_10154728736096336 | Only for those who work a job and don't fall below the poverty line. Which with those premiums would put them there. Such horseshit. I'm tired of subsidizing other peoples freebies with my money.
