With national polls showing Hillary Clinton growing her national lead and Donald J. Trump losing his grip on traditionally red states, Clinton looks likely to prevail on Election Day.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Cynthia Berry | 10154926020563812_10154926023293812 | I think we should wait until election day before we declare a victory for either candidate, last time I checked, the people haven't voted.
2 | Nick Green | 10154926020563812_10154926027063812 | Put the bottle down and go to bed ABC. The polls show a virtual dead heat in the battleground states with Trump chipping away at Hillary's lead in the other states.
3 | Susan O'Loughlin | 10154926020563812_10154926029253812 | The media really needs to stop feeding into this. Maybe all your posting how Clinton is ahead will make more people get up and vote for Donald Trump.
4 | Gordon Taylor | 10154926020563812_10154926023253812 | Sorry polls out today show Mr. Trump ahead nationally by two points. Do try to keep up ABC.
5 | Delores Smith Sester | 10154926020563812_10154926029668812 | Thank goodness people no longer trust media to report the truth.  Guess what ABC?  We are all going to vote no matter how you try to discourage us to stay home!
6 | Joey Raynor | 10154926020563812_10154926026568812 | Jesus Christ these polls are bogus .. they're based on registered voters instead of likely voters .. don't believe these polls people .. don't let crooked media outlets like ABC and CNN decide for u .. let's beat this crooked woman and put her in her place
7 | Lisa Morrison | 10154926020563812_10154926034568812 | that's a complete lie! I took your poll today with Trump beating Hillary badly and I took a photo of it today because I knew you would say that. Hes beating her in all other polls today.
8 | Peggy Christopher | 10154926020563812_10154926041468812 | Ronald Reagan was polling over 10 points behind Carter just 2 weeks before he won the election in a landslide!  #TrumpPence2016  Don't let the biased, lying, worthless media fool YOU!
9 | Rebecca Sleeman | 10154926020563812_10154926036548812 | Any way for Hillary to cheat she will find it. Guarantee she has already started the process of committing voter fraud. I'm not a fan of Trump but I definitely do not want Hillary as president. It's hard to believe anything that comes out of her mouth. She lies WAY to much
10 | Trish Guarnery Lueken | 10154926020563812_10154926022538812 | Trump is losing his grip on reality. That is, if he ever had it.
11 | Elena Domanico | 10154926020563812_10154926048718812 | I think the media wants everyone to believe she's already won. Americans will be sorry if she does! Be done with the Clintons for cryin out loud! It's time for change!
12 | Jennifer Shaw | 10154926020563812_10154926085418812 | ABC, CBS, and NBC are all in bed with the Clintons and all the elite squad known as the United States politicians. It's like one big orgy fest on our dime. Enjoy it these last few weeks before you get hit by Trump train. Trump 2016 🇺🇸🇺🇸
13 | Robbie Sumblin Thomas | 10154926020563812_10154926076763812 | Say what you will about Donald J. Trump. ..I just watched the Al Smith dinner on Fox..this Man Does NOT Waiver or Compromise on issues this nation holds in high regard, regardless of the situation, social or otherwise. For this Alone I respect him and stand firm in my decision to stand United with him in his vision, for the fight for truth, freedom and the pursuit of the American Dream for every American.
14 | Jayne Brubaker-Faber | 10154926020563812_1795634467375752 | ABC you need to get off her payroll!! You are blind!! American's don't want Hillary! Unless the powers go with their cheating ways and dead people votes, Trump will be our President!! Tired of their lies and their ways!! We need a fresh start!!  We as Americans deserve it! It's high time we focus on our own people. You media, are just plain owned by Hillary! The rest of us deplorables aren't
15 | Matt Ray | 10154926020563812_10154926075393812 | What a joke. If you seriously think that these polls even cover a 1/4 of American voters. You're and idiot. The American people would never vote for a corrupt politician.
16 | Ray Nelson | 10154926020563812_10154926034998812 | Just read an article on MSN that said Trump had cut Hillary's lead in half since the weekend.   I advised them to look at scientific polls, you know the kind, not those that only go after those who Watch a particular channel or  read a particular website's articles.
17 | Kelley Marshall Monaghan | 10154926020563812_10154926034828812 | ABC quit trying to fix the election. Media are trying their best to sway voters for Hillary when they are supposed to IMPARTIAL!!!!
18 | MV Kemp | 10154926020563812_10154926022628812 | The word corruption has lost it's effectiveness with Hillary because it's such a routine association. We are at a crossroads: Do we allow corrupt news portals to dictate the future direction of this country or do we vote for America's future?🇺🇸🇺🇸VOTE TRUMP🇺🇸🇺🇸
19 | Jolene Jaynes-Davis | 10154926020563812_10154926056738812 | Do you ABC News or any of your competitors know how to tell the honest unbiased truth or are you so corrupted now you know longer recognize what made you want to be an honest reporter... I'm asking because Trump does have more followers on ALL his social media apps then Hillary, his stuff has more views and shares, he has more people showing up to his events, his speech today had over 75 THOUSAND active listeners during the live view, Hillary barely made 3,400 yes just only 3,000!!! Yes I know this isn't actually VOTES but if this keeps holding true... I see more people throwing their vote toward Trump then Hillary...??? What happens or what did they give you that you would stop telling the truth, digging for honest answers, holding people accountable and instead become as corrupt as the Government has become...
20 | Daniel Rodriguez | 10154926020563812_10154926022553812 | More BS from ABC and her imaginary growing lead. Keep trying!
21 | Ekene Teecee Maduadichie | 10154926020563812_10154926053758812 | ABC wants to kill Trump.....ABC it's time you call it a day....throw Trump to the wolves he comes back with the pack.
22 | Nadine White Smith | 10154926020563812_10154926083138812 | Funny you can't trust Trump when he's never served a public office, for anyone to know. Hillary has obviously been lying . I mean why else would have to wipe out your computer, but people refuse to acknowledge it. Hillary's goal is open borders with world government. I mean come on people. That will be the end of what we call AMERICA
23 | Susan O'Loughlin | 10154926020563812_10154926056523812 | "At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul."
24 | William Weston Jr | 10154926020563812_10154926088338812 | Don't count Donald out, So far donald has accused Hillary of being a Lair but he is the biggest Lair, he accuse Bill of being a womanizer but he's a womanizer, the president said donald was whing, now Donald is saying the president and his wife are cry babies w, he is saying the Election is Rigged, now lets see if he is the one to Rig the election. Don't Trust Donald this guy is capable of doing anything to Win.
25 | Forrest Gladden | 10154926020563812_896293087169920 | I think you ALL are going to be surprised. Liberal media is doing everything in it's power to make people believe this so they will just give in and vote for Clinton. Problem more and more Americans are realizing this everyday and not falling for it.

Some Americans are considering not casting a vote for president in this year's election in what they say would be an act of conscience.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Deborah Oberg Braden | 10154925933493812_10154925942368812 | Anyone that doesn't vote needs to keep their mouth shut for the next 4 years. Your opinion won't count.
2 | John Baratono | 10154925933493812_10154925946103812 | Their "conscience" could very well get another disaster elected,... just like it did in 2000. When push comes to shove,... it's not just about someone's "conscience",...it's about the future and survival of a Nation !
3 | Nina Cilliers | 10154925933493812_10154925942353812 | How abour casting your vote for Gary Johnson the 3rd presidential candidate (who is actually sane and competant) instead, research him. Ex governor of New Mexico and frigging way hell more competant than the other two candidates!
4 | Sydney Chandler | 10154925933493812_10154925954533812 | Conscience my a**. These will be the very people whining and complaining if things become worse. These fools have no right to open their pieholes about anything because there have been far too many people who fought and died for the right to vote. Now these idiots are throwing what is tantamount to toddler tantrums and refusing to vote because of their so-called conscience. Get the heck outta here with that nonsense.
5 | Charlie Trinqual Carlson | 10154925933493812_10154925954733812 | The Electoral College decides who's the next president. Our votes don't. Ask Al Gore. The only vote that should matter is the popular vote. That's what reflects your vote. That's where your vote counts. Don't get it twisted.
6 | Mike Wood | 10154925933493812_10154925959568812 | Was listening to your commentary. ABC is complaining that Mr. Trump is acting irresponsibly by calling you out. We are not being mislead by Trump. Ms. Brazille. one of your own (sic) jounalist is passing questions. You must believe that we are too stupid to see the way you try to "steer" the public in a certain direction. Trump is not irresponsible, he's calling you out for what you are. You are not used to people calling you liars and deceivers. This is what you are. The fourth estate is on life support. Edward R Morrow and Ernie Pyle are spinning in their graves. Do you even remember unbiased reporting? How about courage and integrity? These words have to have some meaning? Check the dictionary, it's been a while since you've practiced both.
7 | Guerrier Franck-Eddy | 10154925933493812_10154925951723812 | Compulsory voting is neither a Law or a mandate. Voting is a civil right, not a civic duty. The 1st amendment of the American constitution which guarantees the freedom of expression ,also guarantees the right of those who choose not to vote as an expression of their discontent with the choices that are available to them.#FranckG
8 | Billy Reeves | 10154925933493812_10154925957348812 | For the first time in 20 years, I will not vote in this election. I'm insulted that they had to turn our political process into a reality TV show, that either way will more than likely be the precursor to WWIII.
9 | Linda Critelli | 10154925933493812_10154925946368812 | Pure evil, these poor people suffering and Hillary and Bill received billions and billions of dollars to help Haitians, yet Haiti didn't receive little to nothing to help them.  There is a special place in hell for baby killers and taking advatange of the weak and poor.https://www.facebook.com/AlexanderEmerickJones/videos/10154648862743459/?pnref=story
10 | Nicole Cornelison | 10154925933493812_10154925948733812 | the great thing about voting is that you dont have to vote for the 2 primary candidates.. there are other options and you can also write a name in..dont just not vote..your voice does count
11 | LaKisha Watson | 10154925933493812_10154925967033812 | If you find both the Republican and Democratic candidates unacceptable, abstaining doesn't communicate that.It communicates that you were too lazy to go vote, or you don't pay enough attention to politics to care.Voting for a third party says that you are informed and you care and you vote, but that you find the two major party candidates unacceptable. It's the only way you can send that message. It actually gives the two other parties incentive to produce better candidates next time, because they want to win back third-party voters. Third-party voters tell the bigger parties which direction they need to take in the future in order to appeal to the majority of the people. It's putting a big flashing neon sign over a large number of votes and saying "We're the people you lost this time. We're the people you need to win next time." A vote for Gary Johnson and Bill Weld-- aside from being a vote to elect the two best candidates for the job-- is a vote for a better future in terms of candidates and policies from all parties. It will help elevate and strengthen the Libertarians, but it's also a vote for American politics as a whole to move in a different direction than the disaster that gave us Clinton vs. Trump. It's a vote against two-party stagnation. It's your way to reject both of them, and everything about the toxic failures they represent. Instead of staying home, you can make loud and clear to anybody with future aspirations to the Oval Office, that the road to the White House runs through voters who want less war, less debt, and more freedom. And if enough of us do that, we just might get it. "The only way to waste your vote, is to vote for a candidate you don't believe in." #GaryJohnson
12 | Gutierez Dany | 10154925933493812_10154925958233812 | Of course we have to vote our consciousness, we have a corrupt politician who rigged the DNC and on the other hand we have a temperamental douche bag. We don't have options.
13 | Kathy Garant | 10154925933493812_10154925985308812 | It's important to vote. Pick one. Screw your conscience. One of the 3 nominees is going to be president. Search your conscience and vote for one. Hopefully for Hillary, because she is the most qualified and will not cause chaos in our country, but please vote.
14 | Cindy MF | 10154925933493812_1046463558799539 | I respect your choice to not vote. But on Nov 9, this country will still have a new president whether you like it or not. So wouldn't it be better if you make your voice heard by voting? Even if it comes down to who's the lesser evil as you mentioned. The reality is you really cannot have it all. There's no perfect candidate. But one of them is going to be the next president. So go out and vote.
15 | Terry Bogard | 10154925933493812_10154925967103812 | vote or don't vote but we are all screwed unless things change fast in the next 2 years. Most likely wallstreet will be bailed out again and yes the minimum wage will go to 15 an hour federally. Will the 1% give up their greed.. Nope! Will america regain it's common senses... No Way! but at the end of it can we keep hope alive to change things for the better and give back stolen futures?... By god YES!
16 | Mandy Scott | 10154925933493812_10154925973093812 | Very well, let the children have  seat around the coloring books and crayons table, meanwhile us ADULTS will decide who's going to run the country. That's fine with me.
17 | Megan Lenore Moore | 10154925933493812_10154926008148812 | Alot of people aren't voting for many reasons. Both candidates are incompetent and will destroy this country worse than it already is. I know a few who aren't voting and don't blame them one bit.
18 | Mary Ann Parsons | 10154925933493812_1046499462129282 | I'm not voten because they are not for the united states they only care about each other that all they talk about and they should be ashame here we are trying to stop bullien in school and our children see it on TV when they see these two woke up american stop this election before we don't have a united state
19 | Kelly Mahoney | 10154925933493812_10154925992933812 | Gary Johnson is on the ballot in all 50 states. He may not have heard the correct pronunciation of Allepo and he may not be able to immediately recall the name of a world leader, but he is a much better choice than the other two. He was governor of NM and not only balanced the budget, but left them a surplus. If you are unsatisfied with your current choices, know that you have another option.Johnsonweld.com
20 | Mayra Figueroa | 10154925933493812_1602252336452317 | It's an act of stupidity to not vote. While the candidate may not be their candidate or Sanders, it is stupidity to not vote and allow some bafoon and dictator such as Trump possibly win to be president of the US.
21 | Steve Cavaliere | 10154925933493812_10154925956133812 | Negative not voting is basically not accepting responsibility. Which is why we are in the trick bag right now. This is btw the final throes of the failed left/lib society before they find out lying and stealing are actually punishable. It should be less than a week before the msm finally realizes their gambit did not work.
22 | Luis Desrosier | 10154925933493812_1046491418796753 | This is the first time I actually listened to politics bc I was too busy defending this country for 15 years and the best candidates y'all can come up with is a lying manipulator and a bad-mouthed narcissist? Y'all can pretend like your votes matter and I'll pretend like Americans care about the direction of this country and its people🙄🙄
23 | Keith Que Winters | 10154925933493812_10154925963573812 | Going with the lesser of the 2 evils, but Lord. How would this even be a rebate ? Atlease with Romney or McCain, one would be fooled to believe their voters seen something...... But Trumps supporters? All you can say it" WTF, and you too " !!!!
24 | Nicole McCann | 10154925933493812_1602218019789082 | Ignorance is what it is !!!!!     The only people in this country who were allowed to vote from the very beginning where white men ..blacks had to fight for it...women had to fight for it ...how dare anyone say that they are not going to go vote when their ancestors fought for them to have that right ....if your white male and choose not to vote so be it but if you're black or a woman shame on you
25 | Charles Marean | 10154925933493812_10154925964323812 | Obviously, the lesser of the two evils is Trump, since taxing the rich raises prices in the stores to pay their taxes, and since the Democrats favor abortion. On the dumb ballot measures, I am voting agiainst bonds no matter what they are for, becasue the government could just coin the money. Bond money needs to be given back, and they intend to do so by taxes. Grants such as from coining money do not need to be given back.

Former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke is polling high enough in his bid for a U.S. Senate seat to participate in a televised debate that will be held Nov. 2 at Dillard University.

1 | Bonnie Shaver Long | 10154925871718812_10154925877148812 | Wow, this country is going to the dogs when they start letting people like this influence an election, who are these backward idiots supporting these people?
2 | Amy Matson | 10154925871718812_10154925874463812 | This is how far the country has fallen. Make it stop, for the love of humanity...
3 | Sarah de la Montanya-Mahler | 10154925871718812_10154925888803812 | Doesn't surprise me at all. Ever since Obama became president these right wing nut jobs have gone crazy. People like Sarah Palin and FOXNews have been telling them the sky is falling and made them hate Obama. It's caused a divide in this country and then they blame it on him. The product becomes this guy and Donald Trump.
4 | Bruce Smith | 10154925871718812_10154925877088812 | WTF is the United States turning into? First Trump, now Duke. The country is in very serious trouble.
5 | Mohamed Khlifi | 10154925871718812_10154925873573812 | They don't represent Christianity because Christianity is a religion of peace. 😂 😂 😂 😂
6 | Mahad Mudey | 10154925871718812_10154925876303812 | I guess now we know what the phrase "Make America Great AGAIN" actually means..
7 | Amanda Zayas | 10154925871718812_10154925881438812 | This is also one of the reasons we desperately need public colleges to be FREE BECAUSE the only way to rid this ignorance is through education
8 | Amber Hernandez | 10154925871718812_10154925887668812 | I'm not seeing the point of the astonishment. There's not much of a difference between Duke, Trump, Hitler...History is always doomed to repeat itself. And here we have it.
9 | Deborah Elston | 10154925871718812_10154925882008812 | This is absolutely disgusting. 😡 WTH is going on in this country that a former KKK leader will be in a televised debate? We are one sick nation.
10 | Kiki Hemphill | 10154925871718812_10154925885328812 | A former KKK leader is gaining enough votes for a real chance at a Senate seat. These are sad days in America.
11 | Martina Jackson-Haynes | 10154925871718812_10154925946428812 | I'm so disgusted with how our political landscape has allowed for someone with this background would even be seen as credible.
12 | Sarah Saylor | 10154925871718812_628397457329959 | I don't know how anyone can look at David Duke's extensive despicable/criminal background and relative success in politics and  deny that deep systemic racism is a problem in this country.
13 | Brian Martinez | 10154925871718812_10154925909133812 | So I don't get it, the left is up in arms that a former KKK clansmen, David Duke, may sit on the Senate.    But don't care one iota that Hillary's mentor, Robert Byrd, had the same job in the KKK as David Duke.You would think they would be up in arms about Robert Byrd as well.Can someone explain this Logic for me please.
14 | Rick Kentaft | 10154925871718812_10154925896078812 | Well Robert Byrd was a higher ranking member of the KKK but he was a Democrat so that was allowed right. This guy is just like Byrd a racist idiot. But Hillary Clinton loved Byrd.
15 | Teela English | 10154925871718812_10154925950023812 | If you have a documented history of racism, you shouldn't be allowed to run or even be in that kind of position of power. This is how systematic racism keeps going, you have a well known racist making life decisions for people of color and your expect fairness?
16 | Diblo Haidara | 10154925871718812_10154925892168812 | Well that can only take place in a state like Louisiana which is run by Trumptards lol who am I kiddingt since Trump got so far in this election every disgusting human being would try his chance, sad, this is why we need to take back our country from these zealots.
17 | Gary Glover | 10154925871718812_10154925891668812 | Wow, the US is allowing Terrorists to run for the senate? Maybe Bin Laden should have taken that route instead. I know Saddam Hussein was given the keys to a US city but wow, the senate now too.
18 | Mary Ann Gandolfi Nally | 10154925871718812_10154925925463812 | Ghoul shows up just in time for Halloween.He might have made the debate but he won't get elected.Only polling at 5%.
19 | Keven Underwood | 10154925871718812_10154925916173812 | This has nothing to do with Trump, its the outrage that the liberal democrats have caused across the nation. They have pissed everyone off and now people are sinking low
20 | Trimarco Joseph | 10154925871718812_10154925909968812 | This, or thiz sort of person being elevated,  is so typical of the South; specifically Louisiana,  the amount of money (orlack thereof) spent on education says so much about an area of the USA that is so beautiful and has so much culture to give to the rest of us., but is tragically entrenched in hate that its beauty is diminished by its hate. David Duke, and thosr who believe as he does need to go away.
21 | Patti Piper | 10154925871718812_1658656321092927 | I wouldn't vote for anyone that ever had anything to do with the kkk and im a white christian. I hate what the kkk stands for. They only started calling Trump racist after he ran for pres. Never heard that in the 30 yrs before.
22 | Linda N Joe Hebert | 10154925871718812_1658638944427998 | That was over 40 years ago. He ran for governor in the 80s against Edwards, and Edwards wound up in jail. All politicians have bones in their closet, how deep are you going to dig. They're all hiding something.
23 | Jessica Cook-Foti | 10154925871718812_10154925902423812 | What in the holy f is going on?!  How is it that this many racists have so much control on so many?!  I'm almost hoping for a split, like a North and south type of thing. Wouldn't it be interesting to see the conservatives on their own side, and the democrats/liberals on the other?  Honestly, I think it'd do everyone some good! I don't know how to handle these ppl anymore!
24 | Jules Gilbert | 10154925871718812_1658641441094415 | As if the presidential candidates weren't already like the nastiest game of "would you rather".. Casting a vote for either of them would be best described as spinning the prize wheel from hell!!!Now THIS?!?Man! People in this country have lost their effing minds!!! Who wants to chip in on a private island with me?!?
25 | Shane Eberhard | 10154925871718812_1658677041090855 | Anyone that is associated with a domestic terrorist group such as the KKK also the black panthers should never be able to hold public office in our country because those hate groups don't represent our freedom and democracy and neither does the people that lead those groups!!

UN says that evacuations from Aleppo could not be carried out today because of lack of security assurances. “We don’t trust the Syrian government. How can people who are killing us guarantee our safety?"
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Jason A Mojica | 10154925803313812_10154925805538812 | Hillary was laughing at Donald trump calling her out on syria. Because you know, nothing is funnier than helping to kill and displace millions of Syrians. Hillarys policies have given rise to terror groups such as isis and al Qaeda, all the while harming millions of people.
2 | Gill Jingle | 10154925803313812_10154925847048812 | The conflict in Syria isn’t really about terrorism at all. It’s about natural gas, competing pipelines and access to markets in the EU. It’s about money and power. The whole ISIS-thing is a big hoax to conceal what’s really going on, which is a global war for resources, more blood for oil.
3 | Jeanne Clevenger | 10154925803313812_10154925865693812 | The UN says they don't trust the Syrian government. We know how the UN feels, the American People don't trust the American government. Obama and Hillary are the cause of the UN's distrust and the American People's distrust. #NEVERHILLARY
4 | Marilyn Pavlicek | 10154925803313812_10154925805388812 | In Harrisonburg, Virginia, the FBI and local authorities are investigating after 20 dead people re-registered to vote this year. #VOTERFRAUD #DRAINTHESWAMP....

6 | Gerald Vaughan | 10154925803313812_10154925848418812 | Stay there with ISIS, see how that works out for ya! After all, they're just the JV Team!
7 | Gill Jingle | 10154925803313812_10154925847443812 | The geopolitics of gas and the Syrian crisis: Syrian opposition armed to thwart construction of Iran-Iraq-Syria gas pipeline. Syria’s troubles began shortly after it announced that it was going to be part of an “Islamic pipeline” that would transfer natural gas from the South Pars gas field off the coast of Iran across Iraq and Syria, eventually connecting to Greece and the lucrative EU market. A gas pipeline from Iran would be highly profitable for Syria. Europe would gain from it as well, but clearly someone in the West didn’t like it. The West’s gas-supplying allies in the Persian Gulf weren’t happy with it either, nor was would-be no. 1 gas transporter Turkey, as it would then be out of the game.
8 | Micah Carter | 10154925803313812_10154925954113812 | She supports rebels in Syria.... why won't she support rebels here in the US ?
9 | Gary Doan | 10154925803313812_10154925829093812 | Thank Hillary for the Syrian war, recruiting, funding and arming rebels to implement regime change, named Arab Spring. Funny the media never brings that up.
10 | Ron Mcvay | 10154925803313812_10154925816253812 | Let's get this right Hillary and Obama start this and arm them now want to bring all the refugees here???? Vote trump

14 | Yvonne Clerebout | 10154925803313812_10154925811933812 | In her email, Abedin told Podesta and current Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook that the lavish May 2015 meeting of the Clinton Global Initiative was based on a $12 million pledge from Moroccan King Mohammed VI to host the event.“The King has personally committed approx. $12 million both for the endowment and to support the meeting,” Abedin wrote.Clinton Foundation records do not show any direct pledge of funding from the king or government of Morocco to the charity.

24 | Gill Jingle | 10154925803313812_10154925847288812 | There is a plan approved by the U.S. government to create a new pipeline for transporting gas from Qatar to Europe involving Turkey and the regime of Israel. This new pipeline is to begin in Qatar, cross Saudi territory and then the territory of Jordan, thus bypassing Shiite Iraq, and reaches Syria. Near Homs the pipeline is to branch in three directions: to Latakia, Tripoli in northern Lebanon, and Turkey. Homs, where there are also hydrocarbon reserves, is the project’s main crossroads, and it is not surprising… that the fiercest fighting is taking place. Here the fate of Syria is being decided.
25 | Gill Jingle | 10154925803313812_10154925846783812 | 5 years ago, Iran, Iraq, and Syria singed energy pipeline deals, to create the crescent energy pipelines, so very shortly after, Syrian uprising began and the whole Syria fell into turmoil!  Also, the tribe of the U.S.A. repeatedly, constantly, and consistently has demanded the removal of Assad! The same scenarios about Saddam Hussein and Qaddafi!

“We have a bunch of babies running our country, folks,” Donald J. Trump said.

3 | Nick Mancinelli | 10154925739373812_10154925743713812 | How is it that Donald Trump can call anyone a baby and take himself seriously? He's the biggest one out there right now.
4 | Jane Clark Sims | 10154925739373812_10154925748458812 | Trump throws tantrums if he doesn't get his way. He takes no responsibilty for his actions! Then he calls others babies and losers!!! LOL

8 | Pam Bray | 10154925739373812_10154925748338812 | How many Wikileaks do we need to see and read about Hillary Clinton and her minions before we say enough is enough and start legal action against her. She is so corrupt, treasonous.

11 | Larry Fisk | 10154925739373812_10154925755828812 | Republicans control both house and senate and so yes they are a bunch of babies and losers. They obstructed all attempts to pass any beneficial bills.

15 | Ana Ortloff | 10154925739373812_10154925775108812 | Rickie ok. Is he serious? Calling others a big baby? 😂 again the hypocrisy floors me. He's whining about a rigged election before it's even over. Cries like a wuss when someone says anything (SNL) but OTHERS are babies??? 😂😂😂☔️️
16 | Pamela Habib | 10154925739373812_10154925782398812 | He wants to win and go work with these people? But he's calling them losers and babies? Starting on the right foot if you win I see. I think he thinks the country is like his company and he can hire and fire people the rest of us chose.
17 | Diane Thompson | 10154925739373812_10154925763658812 | And again, Trump is calling others names that are more aptly applied to him. Does he not realize that people are on to this childish psychosis of his?
18 | Don Jones | 10154925739373812_10154925776078812 | The only grief I see will be family members of victims from Hillarys refugees that kill and rape after they get here and guess what the taxpayer will be paying the bill.

But as a person gets older, they start to revert back to the infant stage. Mr. Trump needs a pacifier and a blanket.
20 | Theresa Hoyle | 10154925739373812_10154925785478812 | well is that not the kettle calling the pot black !! what i see is when someone labels him something he turns it around and trys to make it like it was his ideal !!! hes been whining like a baby for weeks !! he must have just gotten this news flash LOL
21 | Simon Dondi | 10154925739373812_1790797754522431 | As CIC Obama has the sole responsibility of keeping Americans safe from both external and domestic enemies. Trump and his Trumpets fall in the later category. Obama has to campaign to keep Americans safe..and that is real work!!

25 | Heather Davis Mayorga | 10154925739373812_10154925788143812 | Well, we have a Vice President who is now saying he'd like to beat Trump up. The whole lot of these people are just embarrassing. It's hypocritical to pretend either side is much better than the other.

TONIGHT ON ABC 20/20: Christopher Waide, who is serving a 48-year prison sentence for the murder of a Colorado teenager, says in exclusive prison interview that tarot cards convinced him to confess.

1 | Dennis Jones | 10154925639023812_10154925787043812 | He's pure evil...a minion of satan. Tarot cards are a tool of satan. Public hanging is what he should get. We should continue to Pray for that young victim and her family.
2 | Christine Vierra | 10154925639023812_10154926195608812 | Im not pagan.just psychic. And yeah .if had asked before..but..its up to the user as to the intention...sad. Because yes people not educated will blame everyone.
3 | Pierre Bernardo | 10154925639023812_10154925715783812 | He is NOT a thug.Just a good young lad who didn't get the support he needed. In truth, WE failed HIM.
4 | Jane Bauckman | 10154925639023812_10154925748313812 | He should have consulted the cards before he killed her.
5 | Ryan Parent | 10154925639023812_10154926026923812 | Crazy or not, I'm glad he confessed and the family knows what happened rather than being left with what possibilities surrounded their death.

Bruno, a 7-year-old chocolate labrador, likely survived on snow for water after spending a month trapped at the bottom of a well. http://abcn.ws/2dVRw91
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Kathy Vanover | 10154925572508812_10154925620618812 | This is such an amazing story. And for once it was a dog with owners that cared instead of a dog being mistreated. Hope he continues to get strong and healthy. And that steak is as big as his courage! 💕💕
2 | Alexis Carroll | 10154925572508812_10154925909708812 | This is a touching story but not everyone wants to see this SHOCKING photo right in their face. I am extremely sensitive to images like this and I'm pissed that they couldn't of shown the recovered image of this sweet dog. Anything for a click though...
3 | Suz Em | 10154925572508812_10154925667693812 | The news tonight brought to us by sponsor Pfizer. What if there was somethng negative to report about Pfizer? Would it be withheld for fear that the sponsorship would dry up? This is the problem of being beholden to corporations for your existence. The same is true for political holders of office.
4 | Babbie Turner | 10154925572508812_10154926124978812 | I'm so glad you found Bruno and he made a full recovery this story really touched my heart I'm so glad he had owners that loved and cared for him. God bless to all.
5 | Stephanie Reissing | 10154925572508812_10154925972483812 | Wtf? They didn't check EVERYWHERE for their beloved pet? And he was trapped near their house? That poor dog must have been so confused and scared 😢
6 | Sue Langlois Bean | 10154925572508812_10154925812608812 | Amazing he lasted so long, so happy for him and his family.  Glad they covered the well in so no one falls in it again.  Lovely end to a sad story.
7 | Ida Claire | 10154925572508812_10154925916148812 | Bless his heart, and his buddies that found him. Hope he comes back to good!! Too much fighting to lose the battle now!! GO BRUNO!!! 💕💕💕💕💕💕
8 | Julie Ann | 10154925572508812_10154925960283812 | Very sad, but not being treated badly by owners, but having an accident, so pleased they found him and he has wonderful owners to look after him. Poor little man 🐶😢
9 | Donna Hardin | 10154925572508812_10154925594358812 | Bless his heart....I am so glad that he will be spoiled and loved...Such a brave little guy....Get well soon.
10 | Sharon Camden Coleman | 10154925572508812_10154925650033812 | If there are laws regarding uncovered wells, the owners should be fined to the max. So dangerous to animals and humans.
11 | Amy Byerley | 10154925572508812_10154925590813812 | I'm so glad they found him. Praying for a quick recovery.
12 | Dorothy Molzner | 10154925572508812_10154925777858812 | Thank God he had the stamina to survive that awful long time. Glad he was found and wish him a speedy recovery.
13 | Jocelyn Glecy Stepnick | 10154925572508812_10154925613043812 | Sending my love and prayers hope you feel better soon 😍❤️😍
14 | Márcia Sibeles | 10154925572508812_10154925585408812 | Bruno ... everything's going to be fine... sending Love to you ((( <3 )))
15 | Sue Carroll | 10154925572508812_10154925756028812 | God bless Bruno! Prayers for a complete recovery! Love and hugs to you!
16 | Sonia Porta-Trejo | 10154925572508812_10154925827963812 | He's a warrior! And warriors don't die! They fight to survive!! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
17 | Liz Roncagliolo | 10154925572508812_10154926172128812 | That's why you shouldn't let your dog wander around on their own. Glad he recovered though.
18 | Lisa Beck | 10154925572508812_10154925847228812 | Stay strong Bruno, praying for you buddy!  You had angels watching over you sweet boy😇

21 | Dianne Navarro | 10154925572508812_10154925890448812 | Makes me wonder what really happened to our dog that never came back home?
22 | Karen McCleane Mullin | 10154925572508812_10154925782118812 | He never gave up, this sweet baby. He knew he would be found. Truly amazing his will to live.
23 | Vaj Chu Xyooj | 10154925572508812_10154925851173812 | Hillary would have left him there, cuz that's what she did
24 | سھيل اشرف | 10154925572508812_10154925690063812 | there is no water for humans .....no food for humans .....too many places in the world ....why they dont try to ahow that to the publuc ......

John Awesome and Nydia Hernandez were having a lovely engagement photo shoot in Holy Jim Canyon, California, when they encountered something unusual: a black metal band in the middle of the woods. http://abcn.ws/2erE9Ol
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Shannon Asbell | 10154925508863812_10154925758023812 | Awesome. That would have been something that would have made my day. Creepy to some, but metal is awesome. And, it was really great that they took these photos with this couple. Goes to show that people in metal are not evil. Let's all rock on. Amazing.
2 | Matthew Thomas Goodness | 10154925508863812_10154925816348812 | Heavy Metal artists and Dan's are actually some of the nicest people you'd meet...usually. It's usually the appearance and "take it or leave it" blunt way of speaking and being that turns most off.
3 | Jason Morris | 10154925508863812_10154925660078812 | If people could experience Hell for three seconds they would never celebrate death with heavy metal or Halloween or the goth look again. Instead they'd serve Jesus Christ . .https://lastdayspreacher.wordpress.com/2014/10/14/what-fresh-hell-is-this/

2 | David Walker | 10154925429153812_10154925499743812 | The Obama & Hillary Clinton Administrations should have their own habitat in every Zoo in the world for their criminal actions against America as Traitors. They are Skunks.

8 | Jennifer Stewart | 10154925429153812_10154925560163812 | We went to The Pop Corn Park Zoo in July and it was fun because they have so many different animals that are there and they make a lot of noise.

U.S. Department of State publishes 247 additional pages of email from former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's private server as part of court-ordered effort to produce some of her more recently discovered official email correspondence before the election.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Vicky Collins | 10154925403783812_10154925422338812 | Can we please go back and find the 22,000 that Rove deleted off a private server in the basement of the white house? There were years of emails leading up to the invasion of IRAQ. No one screamed back then!!!
2 | John Lisa | 10154925403783812_10154925412058812 | Are we releasing everyone in the State dept's emails??? I mean WTF? Why is this stuff being published???

I don't give one good damn about these emails and I'm voting for Clinton. Emails with her assistant telling her that her emails are going into the Spam folder...oh boy, shocker! Big freakin' deal. Enough of these darn emails, we have a deranged, psychotic racist sexual predator  in Trump trying to become President and I refuse to be derailed by some idiotic hypocritical BS regarding emails. This is just more fodder for Trump and his demented followers. Enough of this email nonsense

5 | Lisa Brooks-Kemp | 10154925403783812_10154925441603812 | I think its a disgrace that her emails are being made public. No other SOS has been treated this way, even though they used a private server.
6 | Vincent James Mcentee | 10154925403783812_10154925406768812 | As much as I dislike Clinton, AND Trump,I find the hypocrisy in these emails amusing. I am still waiting on the million of emails Bush is to have hidden.
7 | Carson Russell | 10154925403783812_10154925458188812 | How confidential are these emails if people want to see them, and agencies just keep pushing them out??? Let's dig through Donald Trump's email as well, so we can see who he actually raped, molested or grabbed inappropriately.
8 | Tony Tone | 10154925403783812_10154925407318812 | Here we go... Hillary Clinton has called people deplorables, basement dwellers, buckets of losers... she has called her husbands victims bimbos... super predators... she defended a child rapist saying she came on to older men and wanted to be raped... then laughed about it when he got off. The media is nothing more but a corrupt, soveit, communist like super pac for Hillary Clinton... you guys are the biggest and most vile hypocrites on earth. I have followed elections closely since the year 2000. I have never seen such bias, hypocritical, one sided coverage in my life. I don't know what Trump has done to the media, you all seemed to love him before he ran for President... but you guys are a disgrace. You all are not journalist but government controlled , partisan slaves!
9 | Randy Smith | 10154925403783812_10154925481123812 | Hillary supporters are blind to the fact that she is evil and will destroy this country with all the illegals she wants to bring in if y'all stop and think about that and try to figure out who will be paying for them and then maybe you will realize that your children and grand children will lose out but if you don't care about them vote for her and then tell your children and grandchildren you are sorry for the mistake you made
10 | Ilan Ramati | 10154925403783812_10154925645438812 | She now wins the award for most e mails released in the history of politics. Next year we get to see what kind of makeup she prefers. After that, we get to know what her favorite fish is. Oh wait. It's already in the e mails. And now, back to something important.
11 | Gerry Lynn Brady | 10154925403783812_10154925425373812 | She still has my vote!! I damn sure won't vote for a sexual assaulting, lying, CRYBABY.
12 | Elizabeth Marshall | 10154925403783812_10154925631363812 | Wikileaks just released information that proves that Soros is behind intentionally corrupted voting apparatuses that are being used in Venezuela and other parts of the world. This "election rigging" stuff is no longer just a bunch of paranoid ranting.
13 | Vicky Collins | 10154925403783812_10154925584458812 | I think really at this point we can argue until we are blue but reality check......Trump will lose and Hillary is going to win. Lets move on.  As far as the Republicans? You all created monster Trump  and have no one else to blame. Take the next  four years and try and prove yourselves worthy of winning an election! This has been a long, nasty road and I for one am elated to see it finally coming to an end!!! Good Luck!
14 | Maryann Forbus | 10154925403783812_10154925513378812 | How dare she accuse Trump of cozying up to Putin when Podesta was being bought by the Russians and they knew it. Her and Obama should be tried for treason. 🇺🇸Trump 2016
15 | Debi St Vincent Mair | 10154925403783812_10154925654378812 | Hillary is NOT good for this country.- As Secretary of State the state department "lost (missing)" $6 billion dollars- she destabilized the Middle East- She caused the death of 4 Americans in Benghazi  and lied to their families!- she destroyed 33,000 emails after receiving a subpoena from congress- She accepted money from foreign countries that are tied to terrorism both to her foundation and to her campaign (Saudi money is dirty money)- She believes is late term abortions and will uphold roe v wade - She and the DNC rigged the primaries to beat Bernie Sanders- She and the DNC hired people including the mentally ill to incite violence at Trump Rallies- The main stream media has donated tons of money to her campaign and refuses to cover her crimes - Clinton was in charge of the Russian reset where she gave them our plutonium- which they used to create a nuclear arsenal that they now intended to use on US her in the USA- She is Anti second amendment and in an email said she would use executive orders to ban guns- She called latinos and blacks names (to her you are just her meal ticket, her ticket to the White House, she has done nothing but keep you all slaves of the government!)- Her husband has raped multiple women and she has threatened these women to keep them quiet. - as Secretary of State she was involved in a pay to play where donations would get you favors - She would fundamentally destroy the constitution by appointing Supreme Court justices that will impose their ideology as opposed to the rule of law* please for the love of God and Country think about what she will do to this nation. It will be worse than Obama. Please look places other than the main stream media that are in her pocket! Pray. Please make an educated decision
16 | Derek Corbitt | 10154925403783812_10154925700108812 | More Republican hypocrisy. They're whine and moan about "Hillary's emails," and blame her for Benghazi and in part for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. And YET they say nothing about the role Bush, Jr. played in inciting the wars, let alone the massive amounts of information that went missing in his administration.
17 | Mary Kavanaugh | 10154925403783812_10154925631353812 | I will be so glad when they arrest her, Obama, Lynch and Comey. They are traitors, corrupt, liars and need to go straight to prison. They need to be held to the same laws the rest of us are held accountable for. This is absolutely ridiculous that this allowed to continue. Hillary Clinton for Prison
18 | Bryan Roy | 10154925403783812_10154925978858812 | All of these e-mails- including the Wikileaks revelations- should have been released during the Democratic primary.  Had they been released, we would not be listening to Clinton.
19 | Linda Rooney | 10154925403783812_10154925514788812 | These emails don't show anything, why are they being released to the public!!!! Isn't she allowed privacy?? So glad I already voted for Hillary!!!!
20 | Myles Miller | 10154925403783812_10154925406163812 | This is some more of that media bias that those Trump supporters speak of lol.
21 | Enrikê Russêll | 10154925403783812_10154925417078812 | OMG!!! Move on!!! Get over it!!! If those emails can be release to the news and the public... I guess they were not as confidential as the GOP wants us to believe... right?!? 🤔🤔🤔
22 | Ab Obob Oudamam | 10154925403783812_10154925842028812 | Hillary Clinton can't even keep top secrets, we learned from her during the debate that it takes 4 minutes for a nuclear strike to occur from the moment the POTUS gives the order.
23 | Rose Bradley | 10154925403783812_10154925434643812 | We have wasted thousands of tax payers dollars on this and man hours. The money and time would have been better spent on National Security.
24 | Connie Yznaga Davis | 10154925403783812_10154925455668812 | Drip, drip, drip. I can't believe that our own government departments put the good of the country aside to protect an insider politician...no matter who they are.
25 | Amy Pearson | 10154925403783812_10154925919483812 | I don't understand any mom or dad can vote for killary! Take a long look at your children and think, are you ready for every right they ever had to be ripped from them, are you ready to fight ISIS when they come to your home to hurt your children? The list goes on and on. The question is are you ready to pay the price for voting Hillary? ??

VP Joe Biden on Donald J. Trump's 2005 comments caught on tape: "I wish I were in high school and I could take him behind the gym." http://abcn.ws/2dumDfO
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Zack Harwell | 10154925385843812_10154925401768812 | So, is it OK for the sitting Vice President to imply physical assault of a candidate? This entire campaign simply lives in the mud.
2 | Katie Northern | 10154925385843812_10154925407508812 | What a horrible way to encourage school bullying by saying " take him behind a gym". Such a disrespectful thought coming from our VP
3 | Angel Jeremitha | 10154925385843812_10154925397503812 | If Trump had said that he'd be inciting violence, but Biden said it so it's funny! Right media?
4 | Joe Harkins | 10154925385843812_10154925411883812 | Isn't this the guy who pointed out the person holding the nuke codes on national tv in an effort to make someone else look like an idiot?Also, wasn't he being referred to as "Creepy Uncle Joe" after groping a young girl on national tv? #Irony
5 | Josh Mumblo | 10154925385843812_10154925408548812 | Ahh it's ok for a Democrat to incite violence and the news will glorify it. But if trump says something oh boy. Field day for the media to bash trump. Typical double standard held by politicians and media
6 | Michael Gagne | 10154925385843812_10154925431368812 | Thank you Joe Biden!And for those how say he is inciting violence, please remember that with Joe Biden, we've gone 8 years without a vice-president shooting someone in the face.
7 | Shaun Mason | 10154925385843812_10154925444398812 | Because she's a politician, because she's a Clinton, because she collects donations from oil companies and foreign countries, because she is a former First Lady, Hillary can bleach 33k emails, carelessly mishandle 115 classified emails and dodge a prison sentence when other people can't. What a disgusting assertion for a presidential nominee.
8 | Sherry Armstrong-Seifert | 10154925385843812_10154925408193812 | Very professional... So, it's ok to imply violence against a candidate & pay individuals to cause violence at his rallies???!!! Makes me so proud that your VP🙄. It appears your thoughtless & biased smear ABC is backfiring! 😂🚂🇺🇸🇺🇸🚂
9 | Aaron John Leigh | 10154925385843812_1759963254253877 | I'm more concerned with the fact that I thought he was talking about Hillary Clinton. Because she a Billionaire she can delete emails, lie to the FBI and run for president, she can accept funds from foreign governments that fund ISIS, she can give away classified nuclear intel. But that's none of my business.
10 | Tyrel Lemoine | 10154925385843812_10154925399703812 | So locker room talk is bad but beating someone is good? Great point you made dumbass
11 | John E. Collins III | 10154925385843812_1791900797750910 | Let's Go America! We all must get out on November 8 and vote for Donald Trump! Whether you are a Democrat, Republican or Independent, there is no way we can elect Crooked Hillary Clinton as our next president! She is the most corrupt politician to ever run for the presidency! She is a globalist, not a nationalist! We must elect Donald Trump in order to have real change in the way our federal government manages affairs at home and abroad! Vote Trump 2016! God Bless You Donald Trump!
12 | Stacey Hinman | 10154925385843812_1791909571083366 | Unreal!! Our country is going down the tubes and corruption and lies from Hillary and he has the nerve to stand there and threaten to take trump behind the gym! Sure ...promote more violence, promote all the corruption and promote for Hillary who is supporting terrorism!! What has happened to people morals, values and most of all respect?? Obama, Biden, Michelle Obama and the media are trying so desperately hard to keep Trump out of the White House, when they all at one time hated Hillary Clinton!!! Now all of a sudden, they are best of buddies!! They don't care about America. They just want Hillary to pick up where Obama started! Ruin the American people, promote and dismantle babies, kill our health care system, make us a socialist nation, and deplete our military ( think about that) then bring more refugees and terrorists on over to behead Christians, lie about classified emails, accept money from foreign countries!! The list goes on and on!!! We all will see what is going to happen, and it will be to late!
13 | Michelle Rene Blankenship | 10154925385843812_10154925464573812 | For those that keep saying Trump is a sexual predator where is your damn proof? What the old lady that came forward and said he molested her? Hahaha! Give me a break! That woman is old, delusional and wishes he did!!
14 | Danny Marquez | 10154925385843812_10154925452113812 | It's ok for our vice President to say take him behind the bleachers. But if Trump said that. It sick. Our media is so bias. How is that fair.
15 | Yesenia Rivera | 10154925385843812_1791902651084058 | He wish he could take him behind the gym so that he can hold him tight and whisper in his ear.----you are a hypocrite and a damn pervert!!!!
16 | Aileen Rizzuto | 10154925385843812_1791900134417643 | Why so angry Joe? So, it's okay for you to promote violence for the high schoolers and that would be okay? Cmon grow up and be a good example. ABC is this even worth posting? Not a fan of Joe Biden every time he speaks makes me cringe.
17 | Joe Middleton | 10154925385843812_10154925411038812 | Just like the democratic party to want violence, and yet they say republicans are violent, but we only hear it come out of democratic party.
18 | Irene Locker-Diamond | 10154925385843812_10154925480068812 | I like Joe Biden but I have to say he has been very touchy feely with women on stage and their discomfort was very obvious ...he's being a little self righteous
19 | Kelsey Umstead | 10154925385843812_10154925494123812 | Thats messed up joe. Im very dissapointed, you were the only thing good on the democrates, but now i just dont get it. Why defend such a lier?
20 | Linda Jordan | 10154925385843812_10154925466943812 | Katie Northern...what a horrible example from Trump...'I would bomb the s#$t out of them", just grab them by their pu##ies. Choose your battles. Your comment is stupid. Look at the context. Trump refusing to accept the results of the election...unpatriotic! Trump is the biggest bully ever. You people are sheep.
21 | Jeff Sipe | 10154925385843812_1759942190922650 | Joe, why the anger?If your party is ahead, and the vote not rigged, and Trump seems to go low, why are you not going high per the First Ladies great advice!It comes from the song swing low sweet chariot.A minstrel show's old south song designed to inform when the 'action' was to change!A code if you will.
22 | Paul Tester | 10154925385843812_10154925428958812 | So if anyone else had the email issue and was a government official or someone in the service they would face federal prison so it's ok for Hillary. Give me a break. I'm not a Trump supporter but this all you have on him. Yes he speaks his mind and can't act like a brat or a bully but give me a break.
23 | Michele Foord | 10154925385843812_1791903107750679 | Dems and media are bully and violence promoters.. WTG ABC!!! You really can't hide what's going on any longer! George Soros has voting machines in 18 states and counting.. you bet we want every vote counted.
24 | Jimmi Israel | 10154925385843812_1759966704253532 | "Last night a friend claimed that Donald Trump wouldn’t make a good president; he is brash, he is racist, he is a loudmouth; you know the normal things people learn to recite after being programmed by television news. The one I loved was that, “Trump is arrogant.” My friend questioned if one man could make “that much difference in the world today.” To my friend's credit, she was respectful enough to let me respond when she asked, “Really, what has Trump done?”I said, “In June of last year, Trump entered the race for president. In just a little over a year, Trump has single handedly defeated the Republican party. He did so thoroughly. In fact, he did so in such a resounding way that the Republican Party now suffers from an identity crisis. He literally dismantled the party. Trump even dismantled and dismissed the brand and value of the Bush family.Trump has Obama petrified that Trump will dismiss programs that weren’t properly installed using proper law.Trump has single handedly debunked and disemboweled any value of news media as we knew it—news now suffering from an all-time level of distrust and disrespect.Trump has leaders from all over the world talking about him, whether good or bad. Trust me, powerful men who have been president before weren’t liked by the global community. I doubt Mikhail Gorbachev liked Reagan when Reagan said, "Tear down that wall."Trump has expressly disclosed the fraud perpetrated on the American public by Hillary Clinton. He has, quite literally, brought Hillary to her knees—if you believe that nervous tension and disorders offer physical side effects and damage.Trump has unified the silent majority in a way that should be patently frightening to “liberals.”As the press accuses Trump of being a house of cards, Trump has proven the press is the real house of cards. He has whipped up the entire establishment into pure panic. Trump has exposed them for who they are and worse, what they are. George Clooney was right when he said Trump draws live news coverage of his podium that he’s not yet approached. Thanks, George, you were perfectly correct.What we see as headline news today are actually the last bubbles from the ship that is now sunk—meaning the standard news media, as a propaganda machine, has been exposed. They have no more value.In the same way Trump asked the African-American community this question, I asked my friend, ”At this point, what do you have to lose?” We have mass cop shootings, riots in our streets, ambushed cops, double digit inflation, bombs blowing up in our cities, targeted police, #BLM, a skyrocketing jobless rate, no economic growth, privately owned land being seized by the federal government, the worst racial tension in my lifetime, no God in schools, more abortions than ever, illegal aliens pouring into our country, sick veterans receiving no care, and a debt that doubled in seven years to $19 trillion. Are you really happy with the condition of the current system?One man has done all of this in one year—one guy, and on his own dime. And with everything I’ve written above, you believe Trump hasn't done anything? You claim that you are afraid of Donald Trump? No wonder we’re in trouble. You can say that Trump is a lousy presidential candidate. That’s your right. Just don’t ever say he’s not effective.That Megan Kelly, FOX News, CNN, MSNBC, Washington Post, Rachel Maddow, the Huffington Post, the New York Times, Raleigh’s News and Observer, the AP, Don Lemon, Jake Tapper, and many more, failed to implement their collectively orchestrated lie on the American people against Trump, is actually a massive testament to Trump. The press colluded pure propaganda to accomplish his demise … and they have collectively failed and miserably.Here's just one example of how badly America is injured right now. There are high school football players on their knees during the national anthem simply because the press used as propaganda to program those kids to do that very thing. But, these kids are mimicking NFL stars the same way the same kids chooses which brand of football shoe to purchase—they're overtly brain-washed to do that very thing.Now, we have a generation of children who hate America.America’s problem isn’t that little children are on their knee in collective disrespect of America. Our problem is that America is on her knee from collective disrespect by Americans.You can disrespect America all you want. But, it’s high-time you respect the silent majority. Because they’re not simply the “silent majority” as you’ve been trained to believe when Hillary calls them “deplorables.” The fact is, they are simply the majority. And now they're no longer silent either. Donald Trump changed all of that, single-handedly and within one year." From Be Forbes."Bebe Coe Bertino9/29/2016 , this is a copy and paste, and needs to be read and spread!! #onpoint
25 | Jeremy Fitzwater | 10154925385843812_661797940643357 | You know what's more disgusting.. An administration that does anything and everything they want to do including violating constitutional rights along with breaking several laws and yet still have so many people brainwashed into believing they're doing their job right

1 | Cheryl Moore | 10154925299948812_10154925671813812 | Most kids do not know the real issues facing our country, the ones who do are wealthy and do not have a nanny, they spend time under mom or dads foot and learn so they can speak to their parents and get the attention they need most of the time. Even then they don't really know, they need to be children. They do not need to know how bitter people spend their days arguing mostly false points and seeing one sided media spins.

7 | Kenneth Vest | 10154925299948812_10154925862453812 | ABC , WHEN will you STOP abusing children this way ? After all , if people want GOO GOO analysis , they can just listen to you , MINUS the children .
8 | Ian Ka | 10154925299948812_10154925312623812 | Why don't ABC News run their own Hillary vs Trump poll here on Facebook. It takes a few seconds to set up. We could see real people's opinions based on a much larger sample set than the random polls that news networks have and predict the elections based on 500 votes.
9 | Mason Lance | 10154925299948812_10154925310398812 | Democrats love a good handout. The party of Hussein Obama
10 | William Farro | 10154925299948812_10154925712558812 | As stated in recently leaked emails, the Crooked HiLIARy campaign says they need voters to be "ignorant and compliant" ..Mainstream media like NBC, CBS, ABC, CNN and NYTimes are doing their best to make this a reality.
11 | David H Craig | 10154925299948812_10154925465543812 | Vote for Trump it's your only chance against Hillary's plan for open borders, free trade and one world economy.
12 | June Wemlinger | 10154925299948812_10154925384688812 | Most children repeat what they've heard their parents say...that's all this is.
13 | Juan Salas | 10154925299948812_10154925404503812 | Michael Strahan, why are you asking these children questions on the current presidential election? This is a nasty and disgusting election! You're supposed to be protecting them, not putting them under the gun. Yeah, our candidates suck. They're not going to persuade you to vote Hillary or Trump nor should they care. While you're there, tell them all about the incumbent that's been around as long as their parents and a career failure and a major corrupt politician running for president. The reason why a person like Trump may become president is cause of people like her. Tell them the truth, Michael. We're stuck with Trump because crooked Hillary. Anyone else would of beaten Trump.
14 | DeAnthony Moon | 10154925299948812_10154925319373812 | Not all kids are coached some of them are smart enough to know what the hell is going on in this country they listen and observe
15 | Patricia Goetz | 10154925299948812_10154925357428812 | ABC employs that horrible Joy Behar ,what does that say about the network --??
16 | Shirley Cockerham | 10154925299948812_10154925439663812 | Kids mimicking what they heard from their parents and rehearsed as well. Give me a break.

19 | Stevie Cumming | 10154925299948812_10154925610993812 | They are minors, they don't really have opinions of their own. Get real
20 | Wendy Brinkman | 10154925299948812_10154926061773812 | Wow children are so much smarter than the adults. That is how shameful Trump supporters have become.
21 | Bill Galbreath | 10154925299948812_10154925925028812 | Don't speak evil of me. I just might be your father!
22 | Rico Suave Ayala | 10154925299948812_10154926131988812 | Maybe these kids should learn about and read the Constitution and the Federalist Papers before they spout off their ideas that have been tried already in countries like Venezuela and North Korea.

JUST IN: DHS and FBI "aware and are investigating all potential causes” of denial of service attacks that have led to several major outages today.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Michael Coy | 10154925201528812_10154925619398812 | DDoS are the easiest attacks to do. Teenagers often do them. If a bunch of pimple faced kids can take down a huge swatch of the internet we have a big problem.
2 | Alberto Ortiz | 10154925201528812_10154925211233812 | "We have a bunch of babies running our country" - trump (10-21-2016), said the same man who said this yesterday : "I'll totally accept election results ... if I win." Trump is screaming "Fraud, Rigged, Fraud, Rigged, Fraud, Rigged," everyday since June 2015! This is a textboock definition of a deplorable “Instigator-In-Chief”, an unredeemable natural born whiner. The indisputable reality today, 17 days to election day, indicates trump is behind by 9 points.This thing, trump’s movement, is not more than the aglutination of all those unsecure, alt-right, nativistic people segregating themselves behind trump, thus creating a new minority group within our nation with one principle and one principle only : “If You Don't Like It, It Bothers You, Kill It.” All hints coming from trump's mouth are leading this people toward a parallel reality, an us-versus-them mentality, a dark and dangerous dystopian zone. Let's welcome this new product in the grievance industry: the white ultra-nationalist militia ghettos. An American vestigiality. No wonder why gun sales are in record numbers. But, what does this new minority group will do with all those guns? What is it that you are planning to do after you lose on November 8? Scream "Fraud" like a baby again with a gun in your hand?!

Hillary is for full term abortions and tax dollars to go to PPH Trump is pro life, Hillary is for open trade and TPP Donald is for us to renegotiate our trade deals. Hillary is anti gun, Trump is pro gun and second amendment. Hillary is for 500+ per cent more refugees coming to America, Donald is for halting this and helping the refugees in their own land with assistance of neighboring countries, Hillary is for pay to play. Donald is for we the people, Hillary is for Obamacare, Donald if for appealing Obamacare and opening insurance up where they are not tied to certain states and health savings plans, Hillary if for increased taxes, Donald is for decreased taxes, Hillary is for increase in death tax to 65% Donald if for doing away with the death tax, Hillary is for government control of our educations system Donald if for turning it back to each state. Hillary is opposing allowing minorities to go to charter schools, Donald if for them to go to charter schools, Hillary supports BLM, Donald supports our police departments and is for law and order, Choose your president wisely as the supreme court needs to have conservatives on it to keep our second amendment, first amendment and on and on and on. Vote Trump.
20 | Jim O'Sullivan | 10154925201528812_10154926023788812 | Did you know that We Now Have a Muslim Government? ...John Brennan, current head of the CIA converted to Islam while stationed in Saudi Arabia.Obama's top advisor, Valerie Jarrett,~~is a Muslim who was born in Iran where her parents still live.Hillary Clinton's top advisor, Huma Abedin,~~is a Muslim, whose mother and brother are involved in the now outlawed Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt.Assistant Secretary for Policy Development for Homeland Security, Arif Aikhan,~~is a Muslim.Homeland Security Advisor, Mohammed Elibiary,~~ is a Muslim.Obama advisor and founder of the Muslim Public Affairs Council, Salam al-Marayati,~~ is a Muslim.Obama's Sharia Czar, Imam Mohamed Magid, of the Islamic Society of North America~~ is a Muslim.Advisory Council on Faith-Based Neighbor-hood Partnerships, Eboo Patel,~~is a Muslim.And last but not least, our closet Muslim himself,~~ Barack Hussein Obama.It's questionable if Obama ever officially took the oath of office when he was sworn in. He didn't repeat the oath properly to defend our nation and our Constitution. Later the Democrats claimed he was given the oath again….in private?CIA director John Brennan took his oath on a copy of the Constitution,~~not a Bible.Congressman, Keith Ellison took his oath on a copy ~~of the Qur'an.Congresswoman Michele Bachman was vilified and almost tarred and feathered by Democrats when she voiced her concern about Muslims taking over our government. Considering all these appointments, it would explain why Obama and his minions are systematically destroying our nation, supporting radical Muslim groups worldwide, opening our southern border, and turning a blind eye to the genocide being perpetrated on Christians all over Africa and the Middle East. The more damage Obama does, the more arrogant he's become! Our nation and our government has been infiltrated by people who want to destroy us. It WILL only get worse.PLEASE COPY AND SHARE,PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW THIS,MOST DO NOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Spectacular shot captures a jetliner flying past the moon over downtown Los Angeles.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Jennabee Keen | 10154925091328812_10154925100873812 | Why are we talking about the election?!?! This moon shot is stunning!
2 | Emily Comaduran | 10154925091328812_10154925120568812 | If the moon really was that close to us, we'd be bending over and kissing our behinds goodbye.
3 | Natalie Welts | 10154925091328812_10154925784513812 | Um, dearest ABC news, this is a crap posting. There are so many things wrong with this video. The moon would not be that close to the earth. There would be cataclysmic destruction due to the tides alone. Also, how could this be near downtown Los Angeles when there is what looks like a mountain and that amount of trees? When was the last time you were in downtown L.A.? There's plenty of skyscrapers but not mountains or trees like that.
4 | Todd S Sandmann | 10154925091328812_10154925187993812 | That's a special effects pic . Moon doesn't look like that anywhere. Might as well be a cartoon
5 | Clarice Barker | 10154925091328812_10154926016933812 | It reminds me of a Night Flight I took from Florida to Virginia the full moon Rose and I followed it for an hour it was amazing as it reflected in every body of water in Florida the Everglades and all it was just amazing
6 | Keith Christopherson | 10154925091328812_10154925904418812 | Matt Granger Lots of people calling this fake. I think it would make a fun topic for Toglife. It's a really neat demonstration on how tele lenses work.
7 | Reno Demous | 10154925091328812_10154925333958812 | if you look real close at it, you'll see e.t's son on the plane and elliot's son flying it.
8 | Juan Molina | 10154925091328812_10154925227853812 | Watch out, pilot! There's a giant moon there! Don't hit it!
9 | Sylvia Ross | 10154925091328812_10154925394748812 | Love the moon and love flying so this is spectacular to me 😍😍 xoxo
10 | Clyde Hudson | 10154925091328812_10154925386038812 | This is photo shopped. When zoomed in that close to the moon the plane would be much larger.
11 | Paul W Koehn | 10154925091328812_10154925618448812 | flying past the moon? really? wonder how many believe that to be true
12 | Andrew Zeig | 10154925091328812_10154925912313812 | Now I can be sure that the Moon is made of cheese :-) And I didn't believe my parents at the time.
13 | Dana Marler | 10154925091328812_10154925098918812 | So this has something to do about the election. Go away Trumpeter
14 | Shawn Orozco | 10154925091328812_10154925961908812 | My moon pictures always develops as a big black mass with a tiny white dot in the center of the photo. 😑
15 | Nalin Montez | 10154925091328812_10154925444548812 | That looks huge
16 | Natalie Nadozirny | 10154925091328812_10154925223978812 | Anyone ever see Melancholia? Just skip to the last twenty minutes. This image will leave you with nightmares
17 | Raheel Hussain Virk | 10154925091328812_10154925289063812 | When was this ? I thought it was gonna be in December crap missed it😞
18 | Lance Burns | 10154925091328812_10154925866368812 | I'd sure like to really 👀 what else we can accomplish together. More involved
19 | Becky Ellis | 10154925091328812_10154925359038812 | Can you imagine the pictures that people got from that distance up there
20 | Jacob M. Jones | 10154925091328812_10154926036068812 | Zahra Spearpoint we were probably like an hour or so too late for the super moon 🌙
21 | Dora Schaefer | 10154925091328812_10154925496113812 | I agree when you can see the craters fasten your seat belts for landing!

23 | Tishanna Waffles | 10154925091328812_10154925205763812 | Doubt the moon was that close to us, but it sure looks amazing
24 | Preethy Chowdary | 10154925091328812_10154925941243812 | If this is real I could say wowwww but still wowweee though 😜😜👊👊👊

The NFL has put New York Giants kicker Josh Brown on the commissioner’s exempt list as league investigators go through a trove of newly released documents in which the player admitted to abusing his then-wife Molly Brown.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | James Francesca | 10154924977348812_10154924990888812 | As much as I hate Tom Brady and NE he gets a four game suspension for under inflated footballs and these domestic abusers get 1 or 2 games. WTF.
2 | Chauntea Renee Mitchell | 10154924977348812_10154924990593812 | They should've already done something. Make all these abusers and rapists accountable! Ignoring this shows us how much the league overall cares about women.
3 | Hal Spencer | 10154924977348812_10154925058868812 | Adrian Peterson gets a year for one instance of disciplining his child,so you would think that Josh Brown should get 20 years for 20 instances of hitting his wife. But instead, his white privilege will get him off lightly.
4 | Shanna Coggins-Jennings | 10154924977348812_10154926116848812 | This man is not just a serial domestic abuser- he injured and abused his ex wife in front of their children. He readily admits he has no remorse and his tendencies toward violence started when he was a young boy. His domestic violence is just the start, he will kill someone at some point in the future.
5 | Jennifer McArthur Carroll | 10154924977348812_10154925059273812 | This is what a real NFL monster looks like, not a man who kneels in protest of racial injustice. He should be fired for violating the ethics clause of his contract.
6 | Jim Lo | 10154924977348812_10154924983093812 | Treat him like you did Ray Rice!!! This guy has abused this woman for a long length of time and should be treated accordingly
7 | Robert Vandergrift | 10154924977348812_10154925791483812 | NFL doesn't give a damn about domestic abuse. Hell, they don't care if murderers play for the league. NFL is becoming a joke any more, and I mean the bad kind of joke.
8 | Taree Johnson | 10154924977348812_10154925090928812 | Ah, the National Felony League pretending to be virtuous once again!
9 | Madonna Tucker | 10154924977348812_10154925053678812 | What's there to consider? He admitted his horrible deeds , he's done and over ! Out the door creep ! Pay ..? ? Dah !
10 | Sue Wood | 10154924977348812_10154925001548812 | Come on NFL do the right thing!!  What's good for one is good for all!!  Don't let this slip through the cracks!  I totally agree James Francesca!!
11 | Michael McGan | 10154924977348812_10154925075763812 | This stuff is rampant in the NFL. There's like 10 white players in the whole league and they have to pick this kicker? LOL
12 | John Corona | 10154924977348812_10154925049358812 | Just replace him with Howie mandel no one will know the difference lol
13 | Sue Ann ODonnell | 10154924977348812_10154925918468812 | This is why I no longer watch NFL...just a bunch of thugs.
14 | Rose Morgan | 10154924977348812_10154926001488812 | He needs to be put in a room with a bunch of real women!
15 | Joe Azodnem | 10154924977348812_10154925076398812 | What a sissy, he should try abusing his teammates instead. Wouldn't go as well for him.
16 | Thoai Nguyen | 10154924977348812_10154925003798812 | Well, he should have left his kicking talents on the field
17 | Mel Furd | 10154924977348812_10154925227473812 | Protect the precious Brand with any means necessary.
18 | Gary Eckman | 10154924977348812_10154925576333812 | Another Abuser of women! Trump loves this guy I have heard people say. Sad. Trump will be king of abuse. Putin his pal too.
19 | Jim Lo | 10154924977348812_10154925080478812 | Halo this feed isn't about your Love for Donny ding dong it about the NFL!! Wtf you people are all over trying to help a rapist himself
20 | Stephen John | 10154924977348812_10154925004428812 | Wow  are things  ever changing. !..Its like all that Hannity and Rush tell people over the radio is true after all...Too, how Hillary sat there and took Trump's lashing is incredible..Its all but over for her, even if she wins..If you dont have God with you, then what does it matter if you win the Presidency and gain the whole world, but lose your soul and bust hell wide open after leaving this brief stay in earth ?
21 | Brad Murray | 10154924977348812_10154924982138812 | NFL continues to embarrass itself with everything.

23 | Keith Gaboury | 10154924977348812_10154924990733812 | Probably slept with Goodell, so he's exempt
24 | Freddy Maldonado | 10154924977348812_10154925461738812 | They should fire this bum and Godell, should also be sent packing. The NFL has been knowingly  protecting this domestic abuser and his team mates are supportive of him. I wonder just how much Victor Cruz, would be supporting him, if it was Victor's sister he was beating down ?
25 | Phillip Pegues | 10154924977348812_10154925757028812 | If you beat up your spouse you should be fired‼️‼️‼️

The San Diego Zoo welcomes its newest member: An adorable four-pound baby Gorilla. http://abcn.ws/2ePu5D1
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Cynthia Berry | 10154924943098812_10154924992968812 | My 12 yr old daughter still cries about Harambe please keep this precious creature safe from idiots who don't watch their children.
2 | Ric King III | 10154924943098812_10154924966258812 | Please name her with some name as a nod to Harambe and his wrongful death. I do not mean to name her the same name, but something similar.
3 | Jennifer Sue Pruitt | 10154924943098812_10154924948773812 | ABC so glad you are posting things besides political crap . I am liking news a little better!
4 | Lynn Berezowski Filbert | 10154924943098812_10154924967093812 | I agree with the comments that they shoudl be in the wild, however their populations are diminishing in the wild and how tragic if they were extinct.......how do we fix that?
5 | Karyl Carmignani | 10154924943098812_10154924966253812 | To clarify, she was born at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park. What a cutie pie!!!
6 | Kevin Thomas | 10154924943098812_10154925926068812 | Are we just going to ignore the fact that Winston went from a butt kicking gorilla in "Overwatch" to a family man in a zoo now?
7 | Cecily Jackson | 10154924943098812_10154926045623812 | If they were released into the wild, they would be hunted down and killed for sport. This is the safest way for them to repopulate again.
8 | Charlotte Kearney | 10154924943098812_10154925758388812 | se how happy we are to see a baby Gorilla born But think it is ok to kill a child just before birth.   GOD is Watching you.
9 | Bill Kissick | 10154924943098812_10154924959628812 | I sure hope the momma doesn't let it fall into the human exhibit.
10 | Robert Frideaux | 10154924943098812_10154925319073812 | Oh no she is breast feeding in public, better condemn her for being vulgar. Lol
11 | Denise Longo | 10154924943098812_10154925198088812 | OMG she is breastfeeding in public, quick tell her to cover the baby up with a blanket!
12 | Thoai Nguyen | 10154924943098812_10154924954368812 | meanwhile the Cincinnati Zoo shot and killed a full grown, healthy gorilla
13 | Cynthia van Domselaar | 10154924943098812_10154924983388812 | you should name the baby WinKo after the mother and father or name it after the poor gorilla that was killed Harambe.
14 | Beverly Farmer | 10154924943098812_10154925577298812 | I love San Diego Zoo, Used to visit when I lived in Oceanside, CA.
15 | Kandy Schwartz | 10154924943098812_10154925011933812 | Too bad it was in a zoo. They should be free.
16 | Garrett Thomas | 10154924943098812_10154924972083812 | See these places for what they are, revenue generators. Boycott zoos.
17 | Taylor Mitchell | 10154924943098812_10154925252193812 | Laura Duclos you didn't tell me you moved to San Diego!!

Department of Homeland Security "monitoring" widespread internet disruption today that appears to be the result of repeated attacks on a critical internet infrastructure service.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Rex Tilton | 10154924871073812_10154924872708812 | The email evidence is not being denied by the Clinton camp and mounting. She is bought and payed for. The DNC chair provided debate question to Hillary Clinton and she didn't deny it. What the hell!! Time to jump ship to Trump. Corruption is running deep.
2 | Bill Galbreath | 10154924871073812_10154924986158812 | Hillary let out two very secret secrets in the debate.This disruption we are experiencing, is an attack by our very own federal agencies just to back up Hillary, as she attacked Donald on the Russian thingie. This is just further proof that our government is such a control in our every day lives now.It was supposed to be set up against our enemies.......now we know who the enemy really is. Our very own government.Snoopy said, "we've meet the enemy, and it's us"!
3 | Pamela Antilla | 10154924871073812_10154925220668812 | we need to boycott these corrupt media sources (except FOX)...its not like they dont know they are lying and most Americans know you cant trust the main stream media...honest journalism is dead
4 | Kevin Watson | 10154924871073812_10154924877968812 | Trying to silence Assange, NOT GOING TO HAPPEN! Dumbass dems will blame it on the Russians. Watch..
5 | Lacey Quartermaine | 10154924871073812_10154924880128812 | Does this have anything to do with Obama giving our Internet away
6 | Leah Gary | 10154924871073812_10154925127943812 | This disruption is not federal agencies trying to back up Hillary or any of that crazy sounding conspiracy right wing spew I've been reading. It's just something that is happening. I read an article awhile back where they arrested a Russian hacker in Germany not that long ago. More arrests are probably to come and I doubt they are coming from anywhere in the United States. My guess is, this is probably some foreign government doing something they shouldn't.
7 | Yvonne Jean | 10154924871073812_10154924933793812 | Worst case scenario internet is forever gone and I never see simple crockpot recipes on Facebook again..... Best scenario we never have to hear about Kim Kardashian again!
8 | John Fisher | 10154924871073812_10154924927428812 | Probably our government they don't want the truth out about the MSM and government corruption...Let's shut down the internet.
9 | Keith Alexander Keller | 10154924871073812_10154925800053812 | Let's all stop fighting and just be the USA once again and attack when attacked and stop attacking each other ! Nonseense, this country is going done the tube very very fast
10 | Marc Langsam | 10154924871073812_10154925166493812 | When the Obama administration announced its plan to give up U.S. protection of the internet, it promised the United Nations would never take control. But because of the administration’s naiveté or arrogance, U.N. control is the likely result if the U.S. gives up internet stewardship as planned at midnight on Sept. 30.On Friday Americans for Limited Government received a response to its Freedom of Information Act request for “all records relating to legal and policy analysis . . . concerning antitrust issues for the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers” if the U.S. gives up oversight. The administration replied it had “conducted a thorough search for responsive records within its possession and control and found no records responsive to your request.”It’s shocking the administration admits it has no plan for how Icann retains its antitrust exemption. The reason Icann can operate the entire World Wide Web root zone is that it has the status of a legal monopolist, stemming from its contract with the Commerce Department that makes Icann an “instrumentality” of government.Antitrust rules don’t apply to governments or organizations operating under government control. In a 1999 case, the Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the monopoly on internet domains because the Commerce Department had set “explicit terms” of the contract relating to the “government’s policies regarding the proper administration” of the domain system.Without the U.S. contract, Icann would seek to be overseen by another governmental group so as to keep its antitrust exemption. Authoritarian regimes have already proposed Icann become part of the U.N. to make it easier for them to censor the internet globally. So much for the Obama pledge that the U.S. would never be replaced by a “government-led or an inter-governmental organization solution.”Rick Manning, president of Americans for Limited Government, called it “simply stunning” that the “politically blinded Obama administration missed the obvious point that Icann loses its antitrust shield should the government relinquish control.”The administration might not have considered the antitrust issue, which would have been naive. Or perhaps in its arrogance the administration knew all along Icann would lose its antitrust immunity and look to the U.N. as an alternative. Congress could have voted to give Icann an antitrust exemption, but the internet giveaway plan is too flawed for legislative approval.As the administration spent the past two years preparing to give up the contract with Icann, it also stopped actively overseeing the group. That allowed Icann to abuse its monopoly over internet domains, which earns it hundreds of millions of dollars a year.Earlier this month, an independent review within Icann called the organization “simply not credible” in how it handled the application for the .inc, .llc and .llp domains. The independent review found Icann staffers were “intimately involved” in evaluating their own work. A company called Dot Registry had worked with officials of U.S. states to create a system ensuring anyone using these Web addresses was a legitimate registered company. Icann rejected Dot Registry’s application as a community, which would have resulted in lowered fees to Icann.Delaware’s secretary of state objected: “Legitimate policy concerns have been systematically brushed to the curb by Icann staffers well-skilled at manufacturing bureaucratic processes to disguise pre-determined decisions.” Dot Registry’s lawyer, Arif Ali of the Dechert firm, told me last week his experience made clear “Icann is not ready to govern itself.”Icann also refuses to award the .gay domain to community groups representing gay people around the world. Icann’s ombudsman recently urged his group to “put an end to this long and difficult issue” by granting the domain. Icann prefers to earn larger fees by putting the .gay domain up for auction among for-profit domain companies.And Icann rejects the community application for the .cpa domain made by the American Institute of CPAs, which along with other accounting groups argues consumers should expect the .cpa address only to be used by legitimate accountants, not by the highest bidder. An AICPA spokesman told me he has a pile of paperwork three feet high on the five-year quest for the .cpa domain. The professional group objected in a recent appeal: “The process seems skewed toward a financial outcome that benefits Icann itself.”The only thing worse than a monopoly overseen by the U.S. government is a monopoly overseen by no one—or by a Web-censoring U.N. Congress still has time to extend its ban on the Obama administration giving up protection of the internet. Icann has given it every reason to do so.
11 | Mark Mason | 10154924871073812_10154925190298812 | I wouldn't have thought anything about this except earlier this morning I read a article about empty Walmart buildings being turn into FEMA camps so it really does make me wonder what our government is really doing.. Conspiracy theory? I hope so
12 | Michael McNeal | 10154924871073812_10154924911283812 | My internet is so slow anyway, I will never notice interruptions !
13 | James Ivester | 10154924871073812_10154924917008812 | Every one is so corrupt, How are we not to be sure it's not our own gov or members of our gov?
14 | Gina Banister | 10154924871073812_10154924979923812 | Tell me again why our brilliant POTUS gave up the US control of the internet?But it's actually probably because of Hillary Clinton's unprotected server with National Security data that was hacked while Sec. of State😡
15 | John Braumann | 10154924871073812_10154924989338812 | They should call the CIA, they're probably seeing if they can silence dissent.
16 | Patrick Bryan S. Juarez | 10154924871073812_10154924964288812 | all the propaganda to make their "next measure" against their nemesis look justifiable to the world.#USAisATitAGAIN
17 | David Blake | 10154924871073812_10154924888593812 | Wonder what we will find out about hillary now. I bet shes sweating beads.
18 | Gerry Klepfer | 10154924871073812_10154924931943812 | Probably just the states that r up for for grabs r knocked out so they can't watch trump
19 | Vic Den | 10154924871073812_10154924903588812 | I think in order to protect the Internet, everyone who works in IT should be allowed to go home.
20 | Jim McCullough | 10154924871073812_10154925073608812 | Obama's Line in the Sand. You Won't Believe What It Ishttp://nation.foxnews.com/2016/10/21/wikileaks-reveals-obamas-line-sand-you-wont-believe-what-it
21 | Steve Morschauser | 10154924871073812_10154924902198812 | Practice attacks for a big one right before the election. They want Trump to win.
22 | Lou Brody | 10154924871073812_10154925260328812 | First the US Dems talk Ecuador into turning Assanges internet off. Now, the Dems probably had something to do with our internet just to stop Wikileaks.
23 | Cynthia Cantrill | 10154924871073812_10154924987378812 | The left's hero the zero turned over control of our internet to the UN, and not a peep from anyone! IDIOTS!
24 | Kenneth Isbell | 10154924871073812_10154924962318812 | I've noticed what people see the mainstream media putting out on television dies not reflect what most people are thinking. All you need to do is look at the comments on mainstream media Facebook pages. CNN, ABC, NBC, and CBS Facebook pages are littered with anti-Hillary comments on all official posts. I know because I've been reading and posting in them for over a month. I just don't see how these polls are accurate. Also, look at Hillary Clinton's Facebook page vs. Trump's Facebook page. Trump has millions more likes and followers than Clinton. There's just too many indicators that tell me these polls are false.
25 | Melissa Jo Walker | 10154924871073812_10154924953228812 | Hillary has a beautiful smile and a boisterous laugh, that I will say. But when a presidential candidate is accused of serious crimes against the laws regulating the office of Secretary of State of the United States of America,and other very serious matters, it is no laughing matter. Hillary Clinton was confronted by Donald Trump on national television about very serious crimes regarding perjury, obstruction of justice, and treason. She did not answer these questions for the American people, instead she laughed at us! The American people have had these same questions since long before Donald Trump entered the race for president. Hillary Clinton has laughed in our faces America! About very serious matters for which we have demanded answers for years now. And the media doesn’t make an issue of her laughing at America!? What a disgrace and a frightening time for American people that someone that we distrust so much has laughed in our faces and tried to destroy the only man who is powerful and wealthy enough to go up against the corruption of the Clinton crime family. From guns and drugs and money laundering in Mena, Arkansas to the present rigging of a presidential election, we have watched a crime family come into power and attempt to control the media and the truth about the direction of our country. We have proof that she has a public policy and a private policy, and so many more secrets. God bless Donald Trump for being our voice and for standing strong against the all out assault on his character as he fights to expose the truth. Democrats and media and many of the establishment Republicans, like the Bush family, should all be ashamed and disgraced for being so anti- American. This is no laughing matter, this is our Republic for which we the people will stand, until death! TRUMP/PENCE 2016 LET’S TAKE OUR COUNTRY BACK

Hillary is for full term abortions and tax dollars to go to PPH Trump is pro life, Hillary is for open trade and TPP Donald is for us to renegotiate our trade deals. Hillary is anti gun, Trump is pro gun and second amendment. Hillary is for 500+ per cent more refugees coming to America, Donald is for halting this and helping the refugees in their own land with assistance of neighboring countries, Hillary is for pay to play. Donald is for we the people, Hillary is for Obamacare, Donald if for appealing Obamacare and opening insurance up where they are not tied to certain states and health savings plans, Hillary if for increased taxes, Donald is for decreased taxes, Hillary is for increase in death tax to 65% Donald if for doing away with the death tax, Hillary is for government control of our educations system Donald if for turning it back to each state. Hillary is opposing allowing minorities to go to charter schools, Donald if for them to go to charter schools, Hillary supports BLM, Donald supports our police departments and is for law and order, Choose your president wisely as the supreme court needs to have conservatives on it to keep our second amendment, first amendment and on and on and on. Vote Trump.

4 | Steve Withers | 10154924791658812_10154924825763812 | I just saw a ABC News teaser on my local affiliate.It went like this (and this was the whole teaser)."Will Donald Trump accept the results of the election and can he stop the momentum of Hillary Clinton?"Is this this state owned media?Is this the old Soviet Union we're living in?I realize ABC doesn't give a rip about objectivity but as a citizen of the United States, you should.Don't fear the Russians, fear our corporate/government media.
5 | Jeff Caplan | 10154924791658812_10154924818928812 | You watch ... the Dems are you going to blame this on the Russians. Perhaps it's our own government that knocked out the sites and will falsely blame Russia as justification for starting a war.
6 | Yvonne Jean | 10154924791658812_10154924865218812 | Dear Anonymous could you please at least take down CNN News Facebook Twitter YouTube actually just take down the whole internet those of us who actually care about change are already very much prepared for internet to no longer exist. We will know what to do with what we have learned but while you are at it erase the debt that all of us in poverty have and take all the money from the wealthy to buy food shelter and clothing for all of those living in extreme poverty even those in other nations. It has become clear that the majority of Americans are taking for granted every day with the majority in the world go without. I only ask that we have clean water and land to grow food on so please destroy these big Elite monsters before they ruin this land more than they already have.

8 | Paul Nelson | 10154924791658812_10154924830628812 | It's a sign of the times. In the old days of war we "Advanced the front", Straifed the fields", "Stormed the beaches"  Today we "Twitter".
9 | Coni Brooks | 10154924791658812_10154924856543812 | Russia isn't involved. This is what's making them angry at America. Putin can out smart Hillary. Im pretty sure if he was involved, he would be fixing the election for her to win. That would be a win, win for Russia. With the Emails she all by herself, illegally put out there on her own server. Had shown, how smart she is not. National Security said twice, their not sure, who actually hacked Hillary server. That also could have been someone in our own state offices.
10 | Pam Johnston | 10154924791658812_10154925907013812 | It's a whole new world we are in.  The internet may have been around for awhile, but we are now seeing the downfalls of using it for just about everything.
11 | Darren Pope | 10154924791658812_10154924844938812 | Obama threatens a No-Fly Zone in Syria...Putin declares one first. Obama threatens cyber attacks on Russia in retaliation for alleged hacks into DNC and Hillary servers. Now this. You don't threaten and announce your intentions ahead of time. Hillary and the Obama administration are the JV team. Totally inept.
12 | Marc Langsam | 10154924791658812_10154925167338812 | When the Obama administration announced its plan to give up U.S. protection of the internet, it promised the United Nations would never take control. But because of the administration’s naiveté or arrogance, U.N. control is the likely result if the U.S. gives up internet stewardship as planned at midnight on Sept. 30.On Friday Americans for Limited Government received a response to its Freedom of Information Act request for “all records relating to legal and policy analysis . . . concerning antitrust issues for the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers” if the U.S. gives up oversight. The administration replied it had “conducted a thorough search for responsive records within its possession and control and found no records responsive to your request.”It’s shocking the administration admits it has no plan for how Icann retains its antitrust exemption. The reason Icann can operate the entire World Wide Web root zone is that it has the status of a legal monopolist, stemming from its contract with the Commerce Department that makes Icann an “instrumentality” of government.Antitrust rules don’t apply to governments or organizations operating under government control. In a 1999 case, the Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the monopoly on internet domains because the Commerce Department had set “explicit terms” of the contract relating to the “government’s policies regarding the proper administration” of the domain system.Without the U.S. contract, Icann would seek to be overseen by another governmental group so as to keep its antitrust exemption. Authoritarian regimes have already proposed Icann become part of the U.N. to make it easier for them to censor the internet globally. So much for the Obama pledge that the U.S. would never be replaced by a “government-led or an inter-governmental organization solution.”Rick Manning, president of Americans for Limited Government, called it “simply stunning” that the “politically blinded Obama administration missed the obvious point that Icann loses its antitrust shield should the government relinquish control.”The administration might not have considered the antitrust issue, which would have been naive. Or perhaps in its arrogance the administration knew all along Icann would lose its antitrust immunity and look to the U.N. as an alternative. Congress could have voted to give Icann an antitrust exemption, but the internet giveaway plan is too flawed for legislative approval.As the administration spent the past two years preparing to give up the contract with Icann, it also stopped actively overseeing the group. That allowed Icann to abuse its monopoly over internet domains, which earns it hundreds of millions of dollars a year.Earlier this month, an independent review within Icann called the organization “simply not credible” in how it handled the application for the .inc, .llc and .llp domains. The independent review found Icann staffers were “intimately involved” in evaluating their own work. A company called Dot Registry had worked with officials of U.S. states to create a system ensuring anyone using these Web addresses was a legitimate registered company. Icann rejected Dot Registry’s application as a community, which would have resulted in lowered fees to Icann.Delaware’s secretary of state objected: “Legitimate policy concerns have been systematically brushed to the curb by Icann staffers well-skilled at manufacturing bureaucratic processes to disguise pre-determined decisions.” Dot Registry’s lawyer, Arif Ali of the Dechert firm, told me last week his experience made clear “Icann is not ready to govern itself.”Icann also refuses to award the .gay domain to community groups representing gay people around the world. Icann’s ombudsman recently urged his group to “put an end to this long and difficult issue” by granting the domain. Icann prefers to earn larger fees by putting the .gay domain up for auction among for-profit domain companies.And Icann rejects the community application for the .cpa domain made by the American Institute of CPAs, which along with other accounting groups argues consumers should expect the .cpa address only to be used by legitimate accountants, not by the highest bidder. An AICPA spokesman told me he has a pile of paperwork three feet high on the five-year quest for the .cpa domain. The professional group objected in a recent appeal: “The process seems skewed toward a financial outcome that benefits Icann itself.”The only thing worse than a monopoly overseen by the U.S. government is a monopoly overseen by no one—or by a Web-censoring U.N. Congress still has time to extend its ban on the Obama administration giving up protection of the internet. Icann has given it every reason to do so.

NSA contractor accused of stealing gargantuan amount of sensitive and classified data from the U.S. government was studying Russian before he was arrested and would be a "prime target" for foreign spies should he be released on bail.

1 | Thoai Nguyen | 10154924762688812_10154924768348812 | uhm...people who pose threats to National Security and the compromise of classified information shouldn't be allowed bails
2 | Doug Lambert | 10154924762688812_10154924782838812 | A "gargantuan amount?"  Is that more than a "humongous amount?" More than a "s***load?"  Wish George Carlin was still with us!
3 | Freddie Miller Jr | 10154924762688812_10154924806213812 | Here's a tip. When you're working for the U.S. government and have access to 'sensitive' data, its not a good idea to start learning Russian (or Mandarin Chinese) and making plans for overseas vacations.
4 | Erin Lawlor | 10154924762688812_10154925060608812 | Oh so that's why Hillary isn't behind bars? She's a much bigger flight and security risk than anyone else in the world. But she doesn't speak Russian so - ok.
5 | Darin Robinson | 10154924762688812_10154924771898812 | seems like "Russian Fear" is in play now that the election is almost over. Who decided what to choose as the "scare the simple minded"? subject this holiday season? Is there a meeting or something?

18 | Melissa Jo Walker | 10154924762688812_10154924962598812 | Hillary has a beautiful smile and a boisterous laugh, that I will say. But when a presidential candidate is accused of serious crimes against the laws regulating the office of Secretary of State of the United States of America,and other very serious matters, it is no laughing matter. Hillary Clinton was confronted by Donald Trump on national television about very serious crimes regarding perjury, obstruction of justice, and treason. She did not answer these questions for the American people, instead she laughed at us! The American people have had these same questions since long before Donald Trump entered the race for president. Hillary Clinton has laughed in our faces America! About very serious matters for which we have demanded answers for years now. And the media doesn’t make an issue of her laughing at America!? What a disgrace and a frightening time for American people that someone that we distrust so much has laughed in our faces and tried to destroy the only man who is powerful and wealthy enough to go up against the corruption of the Clinton crime family. From guns and drugs and money laundering in Mena, Arkansas to the present rigging of a presidential election, we have watched a crime family come into power and attempt to control the media and the truth about the direction of our country. We have proof that she has a public policy and a private policy, and so many more secrets. God bless Donald Trump for being our voice and for standing strong against the all out assault on his character as he fights to expose the truth. Democrats and media and many of the establishment Republicans, like the Bush family, should all be ashamed and disgraced for being so anti- American. This is no laughing matter, this is our Republic for which we the people will stand, until death! TRUMP/PENCE 2016 LET’S TAKE OUR COUNTRY BACK
19 | Dennis Jones | 10154924762688812_10154924802358812 | Hillary Clinton is walking around free...she spilled the beans about our response times to a nuke attack.

23 | Doug Lambert | 10154924762688812_10154925352798812 | Lee Harvey Oswald also "studied Russian" and married the daughter of a KGB officer when he lived in Moscow.
24 | Brian Martinez | 10154924762688812_10154925207938812 | So why aren't they prosecuting Hillary, since she did the same thing?(Incoming Hillary zealots saying she committed no crime in 3, 2, 1...)
25 | Lois Havens | 10154924762688812_10154925756008812 | Our real problems is this. Hillary is for open borders, Trump if for extreme vetting and a wall. Hillary is for full term abortions and tax dollars to go to PPH Trump is pro life, Hillary is for open trade and TPP Donald is for us to renegotiate our trade deals. Hillary is anti gun, Trump is pro gun and second amendment. Hillary is for 500+ per cent more refugees coming to America, Donald is for halting this and helping the refugees in their own land with assistance of neighboring countries, Hillary is for pay to play. Donald is for we the people, Hillary is for Obamacare, Donald if for appealing Obamacare and opening insurance up where they are not tied to certain states and health savings plans, Hillary if for increased taxes, Donald is for decreased taxes, Hillary is for increase in death tax to 65% Donald if for doing away with the death tax, Hillary is for government control of our educations system Donald if for turning it back to each state. Hillary is opposing allowing minorities to go to charter schools, Donald if for them to go to charter schools, Hillary supports BLM, Donald supports our police departments and is for law and order, Choose your president wisely as the supreme court needs to have conservatives on it to keep our second amendment, first amendment and on and on and on. Vote Trump.
