2 | Alex P. Reed | 1540282255991799_1540290022657689 | He can lie all he wants, but he can't hide from the video that clearly showed him making the "retarded" gesture towards the disabled man, and his supporters laughed at it. Sickening behavior.
3 | Sasha Bens | 1540282255991799_1540286629324695 | "You gotta see this guy"Everyone that saw that knows he was mocking a disabled reporter. Donald Trump is a pathetic, insecure, immature,disgusting little man and he makes me sick. He's an embarrassment. What kind of person does that? He is everything I teach my children not to be...even kids know this is wrong!
4 | Roxann Kasparian | 1540282255991799_1540287745991250 | He did everything he said he didn't.  What is wrong with that man. Does he not realize there are things called video and audio?
5 | Joseph J Martin | 1540282255991799_1540283369325021 | She avoided a lot of the questions by answering with something that sounds smart but doesn't actually answer the question.  30 years of experience and some people still buy her bs. She could cook a live puppy in boiling water and some people would still come back with "oh, well Donald Trump is racist etc.
6 | Isidro Hernandez | 1540282255991799_1540291195990905 | I have a question why is every major News source bashing Trump and sugar coating Hillary not one has said anything good about Trump every major News source is saying he hates women and he said hombre CNN called him a turd. No major News source says nothing about the his solutions for the real problems in our Country and Tensions in the World .
7 | Elthon DeCastillo | 1540282255991799_1540291005990924 | A guy mocks a disabled, Clinton manipulates, in her emails, national security. But, mocking a disabled is worst than someone manipulating national security because, here's the kick, we are in more danger a person mocking a disabled, than someone manipulating our national security. That makes a lot of sense! LOL
8 | Lorrie Hutsell Sterling | 1540282255991799_1540293712657320 | Of course he did.   We all saw it. It was broadcasted worldwide!!! But he denies facts -- Gaslighting in its glory.   It's what he does. Because you actually check ---- let's him believe you are saying it's possibly he's telling the truth. So he's winning the fight.  And escapes any responsibility.   You can't deal rationally with a compulsive liar.
9 | Daniel Walek | 1540282255991799_1540293169324041 | Did anyone else feel like Mr. Dump didn't answer any questions and just blamed everything on Obama who is somehow the same person as Hillary?
10 | Gail Chirichella | 1540282255991799_1540291095990915 | We want wiki links...We want to see the wiki links on Hillary. You must show these to the American people! Or is Hillary off limits...yup a rigged election. One side election!
11 | Tim Huber | 1540282255991799_1540291765990848 | Trump DID not mock the disabled reporter for being disabled. Trump uses those SAME EXACT hand gestures ALL the time. Numerous videos exist showing such. Media LITERALLY has the masses blind.Mostly the liberal left and Clinton supporters.
12 | Daniel N Patty Britton | 1540282255991799_1540285479324810 | The liberal media uses this because they have nothing else, Hillary sucks and they can't fix that so they run everything into the ground....
13 | KeithDeb Newbrook Collins | 1540282255991799_1540300842656607 | He's made mistakes . said things he shouldn't have. he is not a diplomat.Hillary on the other hand has. blood on her hands. 30 years of polished political correctness with very little achieved. a foundation that's crooked. emails that disappear, is it enough lie and corruption for you yet or shall i go on.she is business as usual...do you seriously want 4 more years after the 8 we've had to live through. or do you want a business man to have chance to try to make America great again who owes no one and is not business as usual.thems your picks. pick one.devil you know or the devil you don't.
14 | Susan Muncy | 1540282255991799_1540300455989979 | If you ever saw the reporter he was supposedly mocking, you'd know that man's disability didn't allow the type of gyrations DT showed - he is very stiff. Plus DT has used those gyrations at other times when the subject was a situation rather than a person. So don't believe the knee-jerk first reaction/explanation by MSM. Wait for the truth to be published.
15 | Clint J. Everest | 1540282255991799_1540288702657821 | Hopefully after Hillary wins the election in a couple weeks, Trump and the remaining republicans can get the help they desperately need.  Many people are saying this.  Very sad.
16 | Teri Hollis | 1540282255991799_1540287595991265 | How about fact checking Hillary? Like the fact she stated she abolished the Iranian nuclear program when in fact it is only a freeze. How about her peeps saying that Trump did not bring up the wall when down in Mexico.. when in fact the Mexican President even acknowledged they spoke about but would not pay for it.
17 | Tim Saracki | 1540282255991799_1540300379323320 | What? Donald Trump never mocked anybody or said anything about those broads! Time to boycott NBC and PMSNBC along with CNN, ABC, DEF, GE, and LMNOP!!!!
18 | Charles Campbell | 1540282255991799_1540298949323463 | Vote Hillary Clinton and support isisShe is not even wearing a flag pin on her jacket.That's because she doesn't represent the best interest of the Americans
19 | Luis Argueta | 1540282255991799_1540305975989427 | Trump won't commit to accepting election results because he is the Biggest Loser!!! In his eyes, everything is Rigged!! So ridiculous!!!! SMH!! #neverTrump #IAmwithHer #Hillary2016
20 | Jean Hanson Skoglund | 1540282255991799_1540294779323880 | NBC, you need to find something else to put on here shows that your news dept don't know the difference between good news and bad....
21 | Andy Stacy Tucker Kittams | 1540282255991799_1540287862657905 | This news is disappointing. There is no reporting of all Hillary's false claims in the debate! MSM is proving to be a huge disappointment to the educated voter!
22 | Kyle Cooper | 1540282255991799_1540307299322628 | Or maybe he was mocking the news network for being so blind when they were fact checking. They were wrong. And that's what he was mocking.
23 | Craig Holmes | 1540282255991799_1540296082657083 | A new Bill Clinton sexual assault accuser has spoken publicly for the first time.In an interview with Breitbart, a former news reporter from Arkansas says Bill Clinton sexually assaulted her on three separate occasions in 1980.Leslie Millwee is one of several women who have now come forward with allegations of sexual assault by the former U.S. president.http://www.torontosun.com/2016/10/19/woman-claims-ex-president-bill-clinton-sexually-assaulted-her-3-times
24 | Kieran Sutherland | 1540282255991799_1540299205990104 | Bribe?? The Clinton emails. "Lastly, on a much more practical note: to get you out of this I am going to have to bribe Channel 2 with a significant and exclusive interview when we are in Jerusalem in two weeks, and I guarantee you that will be far more painful than  tomorrow's relative short and peaceful format." UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05771232 Date: 08/31/2015
25 | Matt Sappington | 1540282255991799_1540288979324460 | It's amazing that Trump supporters call the media lyers when there's video of him saying all this garbage lol

"I will look at it at the time. I'm not looking at anything now," Donald J. Trump  said during the final presidential debate.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Luis Argueta | 1540263229327035_1540263919326966 | So how is Trump going to help to resolve the issues with Social Security and Medicare??? Did he actually answer the question??? Of course not because he has no idea!!!!
2 | Carl Rosenbaum | 1540263229327035_1540264429326915 | If the elections are rigged, as attested by Donald Trump, then the Republican Party needs to explain how/why....- The GOP controls both Houses of Congress- The GOP has the majority of State Governorships- The GOP controls the majority of State Legislatures- The GOP controlled the Supreme Court up until Judge Scalia's deathMaybe the GOP should also explain why they believe the country is going in the wrong direction, since they are in control!!!
3 | Luis Argueta | 1540263229327035_1540264815993543 | Trump won't commit to accepting election results because he is the Biggest Loser!!! In his eyes, everything is Rigged!! So ridiculous!!!! SMH!! #neverTrump #IAmwithHer #Hillary2016

5 | Jack Shayle | 1540263229327035_1540267585993266 | I was very happy that Mr. Trump brought up concerns about the voting process. If a company doesn't regularly look at it's process to ensure it's healthy, it gets sick. Some are saying it's sacrilegious to question and doubt the voting process when there is strong evidence there is a problem. Questioning the process of democracy is democracy!!!
6 | Rob Swart | 1540263229327035_1540272989326059 | Trump must be defeated by such a large margin that his supporters get the clear message that his hedge on insurrection if he loses would be suicidal!!!!! Stand up for our Democracy. Trump is the only person who refuses to accept the verdict of the people. Just suggesting this should bring charges of treason. God save America.
7 | Terry Elwood | 1540263229327035_1540266452660046 | Before the great deludge of media comments that will undoubtedly target Mr. Trump and his refusal to accept the outcome of the national election, I would like to point out that Mrs.Clinton was not asked that same question, and therefore will not be held accountable to the same criticism of not accepting the election results. Just an observation, just a point to ponder. No comments or questions necessary
8 | Shawn Thomas Griffin | 1540263229327035_1540271842659507 | This was the most damaging answer Trump gave in tonight's debate. It made him sound like a pompous arrogant child. It's his way or the highway. Either he wins or he throws a monumental temper tantrum. Pathetic.
9 | Alberto Gomez | 1540263229327035_1540275342659157 | Can't wait for the election to be over, once he loses, then we will star our own campaign, this time against him, his company, his products and everything he represents, disgusting, nazi, bigot, liar #nevertrump
10 | Manuel Bonilla | 1540263229327035_1540276395992385 | He Choke Basically on every question that was ask always trying to change the Subject so he wouldn't answer about the Issues what a poor sportsman, Then to top it off he said "Nasty Woman" That hung him up my 3rd grader has better Vocabulary then he does Smh.....
11 | Shannon Malcom | 1540263229327035_1540273352659356 | He'll "keep us in suspense." LOLOLOL dude don't flatter yourself. I, for one, am not on pins and needles worrying about the baby fit he's going to have when he loses.
12 | Deirdre Merz | 1540263229327035_1540278045992220 | I am so tired of NBC and their biased opinions. What happened to unbiased reporting?  What happened to people watching the news, getting the facts and forming their own opinions. I've watched NBC for many years. I've been watching Lester Holt's evening news broadcast. But after the debate tonight watching Lester, Chuck Todd and Savannah Gutherie bash Trump over and over? I'm done. I don't need or wNt your opinions. What I do need and want are the facts.
13 | Mary Slagle Reed | 1540263229327035_1540303185989706 | How do you people that work at NBC think that Hillary outlined her plans for America?  She did not give complete answers on immigration or really anything! The government already spends billions each year supporting all these illegal immigrants who have children over here! While our elderly can barely keep a roof over their head, go without food, running water, electricity, and medications, we have illegal immigrants that are living wonderfully for free and sending the money they make here(which they receive in cash) back to their home country!  They don't pay federal income taxes yet file them using stolen social security numbers and get back thousands each year!!!
14 | Warren Murray | 1540263229327035_1540275829325775 | This is what happens when an outsider comes into politics, politicians know that they are accountable to the people for their actions as well as their employment. When you allow rich, greedy, power hungry tycoons to rise to the top, they feel they are accountable to no one and if things don't go their way, they would rather destroy the government than preserve it. It's time to put trump and his sideshow to rest, send them back to the corruption, hatred and racist villages they came from. Enough is enough !
15 | Daniel C Porter | 1540263229327035_1540277792658912 | What friggin choice would he have? Lose and declare himself the 'Peoples Champion', build his own white house and hire his own congress? Like he said, 'Nobody ignores defeat like I do".
16 | Kcired Rerref | 1540263229327035_1540266625993362 | To his defenseMr Trump said " he will wait" we're not there yet......nothing wrong with the answer because he knows he is going to win
17 | Connie Davenport Leagon | 1540263229327035_1540272482659443 | Hillary didn't answer the question either. Don't know why everyone is making such a big deal. Tell me something Hillary, Trump has campaigned for the presidency because he wants to make America Great in so many areas: jobs, trade, immigration, America First, stronger defense, take care of our vets, help the people in the inner cities, reestablish law and order, support our law enforcement officers, repeal and replace Obamacare, eliminate ISIS, remove common core, bring education management and control to the local level instead of from DC, reduce taxes for small business and large corporations, flatten our income tax and make it simpler, peace thru strength, give the religious minister's and other religious leaders their freedom of speech and repeal the Johnson Amendment, streamline our government and remove the corruption, preserve our 2nd Amendment rights, appoint conservative constitutional judges, strengthen our borders and eliminate sanctuary cities, and yet after 30 years in politics, I still don't have a clue what the hell you are running for except stronger together whatever the hell that means!
18 | Taylor Seitz | 1540263229327035_1540268499326508 | This was a terrible statement from a terrible man-child. It's obviously clear he has no regard for anyone other than himself: not voters, not members of his own party, not his country, not the rule of law, and not even this institution of democracy himself. It's one thing to oppose inequality and government corruption, but the openly fascist ideals spewing from this man-child's mouth must be repudiated by all patriotic Americans.
19 | Shelley Margaret | 1540263229327035_1540303549323003 | Were you guys all over Al Gore too, when he left us hanging for weeks as we recounted all the pregnant chads? We just learned this week that the Democrats have been bussing in people from out of state to vote fraudulently for the last 50 years (on tape), and Hillary's campaign has been paying people to cause violence at Trump's rallies,  and colluding with the media - how can we not feel this election is rigged??
20 | Sarah Hammons | 1540263229327035_1540282342658457 | they where both good pivoting when needed .but he like always talked with Metaphors.it always makes thing sound so bad but it is a very good way Create an impact,that is why people are convinced he is for real or knows what he is talking about it sounds so dramatic and he can say it with out a bit of guilt.but once again i heard all that is wrong with every thing and every one and how he could make it better but he forgot  or has no real idea again to tell us how he will do it.telling all how bad it is over and over manipulating people and having the slightest clue no plan to change any thing.
21 | Milton Cosby | 1540263229327035_1540283679324990 | If the election process is rigged than there is no integrity in the process. Trump is competing against people that for thirty, or more years have shown to the America people that they have no integrity. If he lose the election, I can understand him leading a revolt. Our Founding Fathers said, a little revolt is healthy for a democratic society. We are long over due.
22 | Robert Keyser | 1540263229327035_1540300282656663 | He did not say he would not either. Also for the record since Hillary seems to have also forgotten this... Al Gore in 2000 rescinded his concession and it took the Supreme Court to step in to determine the outcome of the election because of the crap going on in Florida with the counting of the votes.
23 | Scott Elam | 1540263229327035_1540267369326621 | But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. — Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies
24 | Jodi Whitehead | 1540263229327035_1540296272657064 | The Presidential Electorial College has been in place for years, people might be able to 'rig' part of it, by intimidating voters, stopping voters from casting their ballots, placing fear in voters in anyway......oh wait, this describes Trump and his koolade drinkers! Hillary wins, Trump needs to be a man and stop pouting those nasty lips, and deal with it......just like ever other loser has had to do!
25 | Albert Rubio | 1540263229327035_1540279895992035 | Overtime Media propaganda." Trump refused to commit to a peaceful transition, even as Wallace tried to explain to him that it was a bedrock principle of American government." -The AtlanticNo one is obligated to respect the outcome. Implying something ominous or a non peaceful response is a self serving invention.I don't support trump nor manipulative media.

2 | Tina-Marie Clark | 1540230615996963_1540250242661667 | Fact checking:Donald-9 times  Hillary- 0 times Yeah this seems legit!  NBC I have to say that you used to be my favorite news channel. But you prove tonight you are in the pocket of the Democratic Party. How is one supposed to vote in good conscious and not truly know all the facts? I can only pray that this country will vote based on past experiences and not media hype!
3 | Sultan Mahmud | 1540230615996963_1540248022661889 | Donald Trump is now a bigger threat to US democracy than ISIS will ever be.This is truly terrifying - no really it is. It could start a blood bath or mini civil war. Get him under control GOP!Since the Civil War the US has been a stable democracy. Trump is threatening to undo centuries of democratic culture and norms.He just destroyed himself - but in doing so has sown dragons teeth.Don't be surprised should monsters spring forth.
4 | Brian Lizotte | 1540230615996963_1540246662662025 | I thought fact checking presidential debates was supposed to be done on both candidates? Nothing But Clinton News only seems to want to be bias and promote propaganda. Clinton lied during the debate as well. Like has she said " 33,000 killed last year at the hands of gun related homicides " Fact is that 75% of those 33K are suicides. Not homicides
5 | Sheryl Ann | 1540230615996963_1540251109328247 | NBC grow up and stop protecting a bigger lier and that is Killery.. You fn know she belongs in jail.. stop stereo typing a man that wants to bettter our country , she has had plenty of chamces to fix America..
6 | Becky Swinney | 1540230615996963_1540252065994818 | His wife told Anderson Cooper Trump apologized to her and he said he did not. Hillary was right he lies about his lies about lies. He shouldn't talk about anyone's looks when he always looks like he is constipated. He never has anything nice to say about anyone or anything except himself. He is very negative and depressing
7 | Miguel Menendez | 1540230615996963_1540295369323821 | I do not care if Donald Trump called a woman fat. I do not care if he tried to sleep with a woman or if he likes "beautiful" women. I care that he sent a plane to pick up 200 Marines who were stranded after desert storm. I care that he supports our police officers and first responders. I care that he supports guns and standing behind our military. I care that he supports the death penalty and is AGAINST abortion. I care that he supports enforcing immigration laws. I care that he wants to destroy radical Islamic groups. I care that he supports COAL. These are things I care about. Him talking sexually about women does not bother me. Were they mean words? Yes. Were they words spoken in PRIVATE? Yes. Have you ever talked to your friends about the opposite sex in private and said things? I'm positive all of you have. But, News Flash!! Women have been sexualized for centuries!! Jay-Z, Lil' Jon, Lil' Wayne and every single other rapper helped establish that platform, but people are ok with music blasted all over the radio degrading women. Ever heard of Victoria Secret? Or their fashion show? Ever heard of Hooters? People are ok with that too. Until all of these things are different, women will be viewed this way. Your precious Obama couldn't change that and Hillary can't either. I feel sorry for the women Donald has belittled and said terrible things about. But I'm still much more offended by what Hillary Clinton has DONE over what Donald Trump has SAID... PERIOD!!!! So Trump doesn't do well at the debates, maybe he even sounds childish and incapable. But he is speaking the truth! Just because he's not a polished politician like Hilary or Obama doesn't mean he's unqualified to be president. He cares for this country, not growing the size of his pockets. That man has so much money he could never spend it all. He gets NOTHING out of being president! I'm standing for the man accused of saying mean words. I'll never back a woman under three different scandal investigations, possible murder at Benghazi, and the secretive email scandal which has been nothing but lies from the beginning. Trump 2016!!!
8 | Daniel S Burnham | 1540230615996963_1540244755995549 | Hey everyone Madonna is offering to give blow jobs to Hillary voters. Another role model for Michelle's girls. Then Nicki can teach them the words to Stupid Hoe. Nothing to get shaken to the core about. Oh Madonna says she swallows.
9 | Tina-Marie Clark | 1540230615996963_1540261842660507 | Did nobody else but myself notice how Hillary's eyes just kept looking down at the podium? Very interesting… Being it was leaked that she had received the questions before the debate. Seems fair huh?
10 | Clay Barber | 1540230615996963_1540250412661650 | Here's some FACTS for you clowns as they are PROVEN... HRC killed Americans and jeopardized the security of the nation...check that!
11 | Steve May | 1540230615996963_1540279579325400 | Question... If a white man is beat up by a group of black men and they spray paint his car with BLM would that be considered a hate crime? If a group of men set fire to a mosque would that be considered a hate crime? If people beat someone up because of their political beliefs would that be considered a hate crime? Do u see where im going with this? Be aware of ur surroundings and actions
12 | Eugene Daniel Odle | 1540230615996963_1540249295995095 | Well Hilary clintons husband got oral sex in the White House he shouldn't be aloud back in there plus he raped three or for other ladies I think trump has a right to say he wasn't attracted to his accusers just shows he didn't do what he was accused of
13 | Barbara Cipriano | 1540230615996963_1540247342661957 | Fact: the media's tactics are very old and boring! And don't work! 59-63% is the numbers for Trump's win in the polls.

15 | Joey Jordan | 1540230615996963_1540286609324697 | Actually he said what he said and what he said is no I did not try anything with her look at her what he was saying that is not my type and a lot of men look at it that way and honestly I seen her I would not have messed with her either. And you see what all his wife's look like don't you and you think a man that goes for women who look like them is going to go for anything else. Now I am not saying this to support Trump but saying you are twisting his words to make it say something different an idot could understand what he ment but seems a Democrat can't
16 | Christy Cole | 1540230615996963_1540245105995514 | When are you, NBC, going to start fact checking Killary? You're pissing off people left and right. Kind of like Killary wearing white after Labor Day! The nerve of her!

It wouldn’t be the first time a claim like this was made.You can clearly see at the 17 second mark that Hillary is reading her responses.
20 | Allen Willis | 1540230615996963_1540250902661601 | NBC why don't you spend some of this energy and FACT check some of Wikileaks's emails on Hillary?? Your not afraid of the TRUTH ARE YOU(
21 | Tyrone Terry | 1540230615996963_1540243485995676 | The craziest thing about Trump supporters is they go on and on calling Clinton a liar but in actuality, I can't think of anyone I know or anyone I see even on TV who lies more than Trump.

Then she says we need more military in Iraq to push back into Syria. Just double talk. Trump says: surprise attack the enemy and don’t tell them when we are coming and give the enemy opportunity to leave town.National Debt: Hillary, very negative; we will make the wealthy pay, and tax the wealthy their fair share so entitlements will be supported, and out-weighted spending can continue that would  appeal to welfare population. Trump: very positive, job creation, trade balance, immigration reform, and repeal/replace obamacare will have a positive effect on the economy.Acceptance of results: Remember hanging chads, Florida. We have seen examples of voter fraud in 2016. We have a FB friend that is an auditor that has seen the fraud, and taken it to the registrars. And since that was asked in the primaries about backing the winner, and to see his fellows back-peddle on their promise . I consider it very smart to say, let’s wait and see.

Hillary Clinton said Donald J. Trump encouraged Russia to hack Americans. He just suggested they "find" ones from when she was secretary of state.

1 | Trent Silver | 1540219169331441_1540221465997878 | Trump won this debate for us! He is not only presidential but he is showing us what his plans are on the economy, immigration, and national security. He got under her skin and her memorized lines will not save her tonight. VOTE for TRUMP IN NOVEMBER!
2 | Mark Arbes Jr | 1540219169331441_1540227719330586 | Wikileaks was brought up in tonight's debate. When Hillary Clinton was confronted about the contents, she didn't deny they weren't true, she instead, started whining about Russia. If I was Trump, I would've responded with, "At this point, what difference does it make," where the emails came from? Doesn't change the fact that they're true.
3 | Joey L Lowe | 1540219169331441_1540230639330294 | Well if it's Russia China or goldy locks no one should be able to breach.it should be more secure and her leaked emails on her private server started this whole thing.now our FBI our cia our homeland security is a joke.were getting hacked left and right and TRUMP will stop this crap also
4 | Don Poyas | 1540219169331441_1540230779330280 | Chris Wallace didn't ask about ObamaCare, law and order, the inner cities, school vouchers, FBI quid pro quo, sanctuary cities, Benghazi. Stop dithering over whether Trump wants to support Clinton. Al Gore sued when he lost! Trump wins our vote.
5 | Ronnie Miller | 1540219169331441_1540227889330569 | Most shocking statement of the third debate: National debt is 70% of GDP. The only way to bring that down is by growing the gross domestic product(GDP). When Regan was president it was 4%. GDP is the monetary value of all the finished goods and services created in the United States. Without jobs our nation is doomed and I'm not a gloom and doomer. I've only been alarmed once before when I read the book "Conquer the Crash" in early 2000s. He said the banks would collapse and they did.We need to stop exporting jobs out of the country. I use to support all free trade treaties. I was wrong. I Love cheep stuff from China and Mexico but it it's sort of like fast food. Taste great but it clogs the arteries. GDP is the heart of the United States.
6 | Ginger Taylor | 1540219169331441_1540227292663962 | HITLary wants to protect toddlers from Gun Violence or accidental shootings but is happy to kill an unborn fully developed fetus right before it is born. Hmmm that does not make sense, no sense of morality at all.
7 | Tammy Agee | 1540219169331441_1540229792663712 | Excuse me but let's not get too picky with semantics. She's an American and they would have to hack her account in order to 'find' them. Everyone knew what he meant! And that is spying on Americans, whether it's Hillary or anyone else! If you want to only give truth when it's word for word, let's listen to the tape and see how it was said and what he meant by it! She might have gotten a word wrong, but she wasn't lying! So there you go!
8 | Silvia Loza Albarracin | 1540219169331441_1540224172664274 | When he said he would like to see more emails, he is encouraging them, jackers are going to keep doing the same only if people is searching and praising their work
9 | Makarand Dusey | 1540219169331441_1540279262658765 | And how do they 'find' the emails? If some of you stop and think, you might find the answer. To make it easier, here is the answer...by hacking. In most countries, suggesting and inciting such activity would be deemed ' treason'. This baboon needs to be in jail.
10 | Cyndi Bailey Cain | 1540219169331441_1540233719329986 | She will not work to help the American people!! NBC is crooked!! Look what she has done and you can only bash him!! Really that scared!!! We the American people will have him as President!!! You can't stop us!! Change IS HERE!! I vote boycott your news!!!
11 | Heidi Johns | 1540219169331441_1540234809329877 | Fox News  is presenting the truth - non (media) bias - this is insane!!! NBC -So obviously owned... you're a media source/ responsible to provide the information equally. You are not to try and sway votes. If you don't think the American people see this, we are not blind-check yourselves!
12 | Sammy Johnson | 1540219169331441_1540232652663426 | I do not believe it...the NBC "Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda" actually fact checked something said by Ms. Clinton.
13 | James Goodman | 1540219169331441_1540248862661805 | So this major news venue, and Hillary, in politics for 39 years, actually. Think in any way shape or form, THINK. RUSSIA. Was awaiting donald trump to say the word hacking?   SERIOUSLY?
14 | Kathy Kelly Hurley | 1540219169331441_1540236759329682 | They'd have to hack her emails to find her emails, so yeah, she is right - he invited Russia to hack her emails. Pretty close to treason, isn't it??
15 | Brian Racer | 1540219169331441_1540229609330397 | I really don't care who hacked who, the real issue is that if she didn't do all these things their wouldn't be anything to find
16 | Chad Hance | 1540219169331441_1540243662662325 | No wonder sites like Breitbart are destroying sites like NBC. Trump not only said what he said tongue-in-cheek, but he said it well after her server had been taken off line. Even the so-called truth check up there says "find" because you can't hack something that doesn't exist.This is just another sneaky way to push this Russia/Putin/Trump propaganda. How about some reporting on Hillary and her people's connection to Putin and Russia?
17 | Cyndi Bailey Cain | 1540219169331441_1540230475996977 | The news is bashing him!! From the very start after the debate!!! Nice try Trump will vote Trump!! This is wrong you do this!! Bash her and what she has done!!
18 | Alexis Gonzalez | 1540219169331441_1540222832664408 | I just looked at about ten different polls on who won the debate tonight. The ones that said Clinton had won were already closed. The polls that were still open had overwhelming votes for Trump, and they were still pouring in. Hmmmm 🤔🤔🤔
19 | Sean Dolan | 1540219169331441_1540232682663423 | If the relatively easy access to firearms in neighboring states is the problem, then why doesn't Indiana or the rest of Illinois see the same levels of gun violence that Chicago does?
20 | Jennifer Peet | 1540219169331441_1540246725995352 | I love how NBC "news" is so quick to speak up for Clinton and speak down on Trump. I would really like to know what is being used to control all the news networks to work so hard to protect Clinton. Not 100% on who I'm for....but seriously....a lot of favoring Clinton. Shouldn't news be bipartisan??
21 | Jennifer Prizgint | 1540219169331441_1540235312663160 | Apparently, the FBI forgot to visit the Cornell Law Library. Word for word from the Cornell Law Library Former United States Attorney General Michael Mukasey tells MSNBC that not only is Hillary Clinton's private email server illegal, it "disqualifies" her from holding any federal office. Very specifically points to one federal law, Title 18. Section 2071.For those of us who do not have United States Code committed to memory, here's what it says:“(a) Whoever willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys, or attempts to do so, or, with intent to do so takes and carries away any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both. (b) Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States. As used in this subsection, the term “office” does not include the office held by any person as a retired officer of the Armed Forces of the United States.”Yes, it explicitly states "shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States.Shouldn't voters know that? The media won't tell them. So it's up to us. Post this everywhere
22 | Scot Hecker | 1540219169331441_1540235505996474 | The whole debate was a joke..One  for being called out as being crooked ..The other bringing up past claims as to someone being a civilian playboy that has yet been proven..Trump laid out his plans and it was clear..Fight for America ,middle class can NOT survive without CORPORATIONS ...Corporations are gone and Hillary wants to keep it that way..All you have to do is look back at the past 8 years and see how much the middle class has shrunk...Under Hillary there will be no change ..

5 | Jacob W. Smith | 1540187686001256_1540202805999744 | Whether or not illegal immigrants pay taxes is irrelevant. An illegal immigrant is and ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT. I am married to a hispanic woman whose family came here and earned their citizenship the right way. They are all voting for Trump. They feel that if they didn't get a hand out then why should anyone else.
6 | Mahdi Calanle | 1540187686001256_1540189472667744 | That awkward moment when Donald Trump says "no one respects women more than me" and then calls Hillary "a nasty, nasty woman".LOL
7 | Harvey Nicholson | 1540187686001256_1540196622667029 | I'm not voting for Trump or Clinton -- each are horrible candidates in their own right--but the constant bias against Trump shown by NBC is an absolute disgrace. For example, who cares if Trump said ICE endorsed him last week when it was last month--they still endorsed him!
8 | Tejuanna Points | 1540187686001256_1540194439333914 | He also said he Never mocked that handicap man..lol this guy does know a thing called internet and videos? Now who's the "Liar"?
9 | Jennifer Rapson Collings | 1540187686001256_1540194399333918 | Trump is never going to have the MSM, esp. NBC News on his side. They will always pick an angle that appears to hurt him, in favor of Hillary. If it wasn't the whole "won't accept the results of the election" thing, it would be something else. His only shot at winning is to get beyond the MSM spin and get a populist wave that doesn't give a hoot (wanted to use a more profound word) about whatever the MSM says.
10 | Rachel Romansky | 1540187686001256_1540199916000033 | Oh, THAT Putin? I didn't realize you meant THAT Putin. Of course I know Putin. Our relationship is HUGE. He's a good man. But not that bad Putin. That one is a bad man and has done terrible things. Bigly.
11 | Dustin Grant | 1540187686001256_1540211322665559 | Plenty of Trump fact checking going on by NBC. Is NBC going to do any fact check reporting on Hillary's scandals that are being revealed by Wikileaks? NOPE!
12 | Justin Lee Phillips | 1540187686001256_1540207355999289 | I'd like to give props to the American people for seeing through the medias propaganda.

13 | Jenn Jay | 1540187686001256_1540217145998310 | Just wondering why there are 10 fact checks about Trump and none about Hillary? Either she isn't worth checking or you are confirming his claims of media bias/rigging...
14 | Selena King | 1540187686001256_1540217409331617 | NBC you really use your news to promote Hillary! Don't be deceiving. He said he doesn't know him. He has met him. Is different then knowing someone.

17 | Valerie Bluett | 1540187686001256_1540197252666966 | Trump disputed something he said in the debate tonight before it was even over. He talks and never listens - let alone REMEMBERS what he just said.

21 | Travis King | 1540187686001256_1540193372667354 | REMEMBER WHEN BILL CLINTON WAS PRESIDENT?(January 20, 1993 to January 20, 2001—two terms)When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over an attempt to reform health care. Her proposed plan was so bad that many Democrats came up with competing plans of their own in protest, and in spite of threats and intimidation, on September 26, 1994, the “Hillarycare” bill was declared dead.This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million for studies, promotion, and other efforts.Then, President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general. Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood—both were forced to withdraw their names from consideration. Next, she chose Janet Reno, which husband Bill described as "my worst mistake." (Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.)Husband Bill also allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission—Lani Guanier was her selection. After considerable backlash from prominent Democratic senators concerning Ms. Guanier's radical views, Bill Clinton withdrew her name from nomination, stating that she did not represents the civil rights views that he had championed during his campaign.However, apparently a slow learner, husband Bill continued to allow Hillary to make more recommendations. She chose former law partners, Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department. Her selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kennedy was forced to resign. (Is anyone wondering yet what her Supreme Court Justice appointments would be like?)Many younger voters will have no knowledge of "Travelgate," the first major ethics controversy during Bill’s presidency.Hillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend, Harry Thompson—but the White House Travel Office refused to comply. She trumped up allegations of financial mismanagement and reported seven long-time White House employees to the FBI. This ruined their reputations, got them fired, and caused a thirty-six month investigation. Eventually, most of the employees were reinstated and Clinton associates were forced out of the travel office. Only one White House employee, Billy Dale, was charged with a crime—the enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds; a jury acquitted him in less than two hours.Still not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House Security. When Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies (Filegate) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff, suddenly Hillary and the President denied even knowing Livingstone, and of course, denied knowledge of drug use in the White House.Following this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents.Next, when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by Bill Clinton, Hillary was put in charge of the "bimbo eruption" and scandal defense. Let’s look at some of her more notable decisions in this regard . . . She urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation, they settled with Ms. Jones. She refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor. After $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr's investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs. Hillary's devious game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for 'lying under oath' to a grand jury, followed by his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives. Hillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, "I do not recall," "I have no recollection," and "I don't know" a total of 56 times while under oath. (Sound familiar?) After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had "mistakenly thought was hers."So you see, the email scandal and all of her malfeasance regarding the handling of Top Secret information, not to mention the "pay to play" schemes of the Clinton Foundation, are nothing new. Hillary’s entire political career has been nothing but a web of lies, corruption and destruction in her quest for power.Is anyone else ready to say, “Enough is enough!”?But unfortunately, I’m sure her loyal fans will say, "What difference does it make?"
22 | Mitchell Giddens | 1540187686001256_1540228105997214 | NBC... we all know, and realize that the Clinton Foundation bought you, and your opinions years ago, but you should try being real journalists again sometime. It's what you actually wanted to be isn't it?
23 | John Paul Knight | 1540187686001256_1540229465997078 | Trump did very well he kept his composure until she started insulting him like the media has!! Oh and did u see what happen when he brought up the violent video about Hillary supporters trying to ruin his rallies that was ignored very quick by Hillary!!
24 | Victoria Hardman Spangler | 1540187686001256_1540221505997874 | What are you serious?  Do you honestly think we care that crooked NBC is fact checking not only falsely and slanted, but where are the facts on Hilarys campaign paying rioters to descend on Trump rallies and physically attacking people?
25 | Sonya Boyd Collier | 1540187686001256_1540244619328896 | Obama tries to make peace with countries that hate us and the media thinks it's a good idea. Donald does it and it's a bad idea. All along I thought the Democrats was against war. I guess that's another lie they want you to believe.

1 | Zachary Stinson | 1540120619341296_1540158619337496 | Claim: nbc does fact checksThe truth: nbc is a bunch of democrat operatives pushing opinions as "facts"
2 | Justin Ozmore | 1540120619341296_1540165772670114 | It's crazy every post on NBC'S pages are fact checking Trump only. Not a single post fact checking anything Clinton said. Both Parties suck, but this is obviously rigged people.
3 | Jim Balfanz | 1540120619341296_1540158879337470 | He spoke the truth when he said, She talks a good game and then disappears until the next election. He is NOT a politician, but a businessman who does have a plan..... She has a "plan" which to to destroy America.
4 | Bryan Brown | 1540120619341296_1540158786004146 | Madam President Hillary Rodham Clinton, the 45th President of the United States.#shewon
5 | Javi Melendez | 1540120619341296_1540158002670891 | She is too smart to go against a man with 0 intelligence. I feel so bad that she has to play in the same ballpark as him and people are actually following him. #Imwithher
6 | Alexander Xochihua | 1540120619341296_1540175102669181 | As soon as the debate ends, NBC Hosts immediately highlight every bad Trump moment that they can imagine.  NBC, you're no longer a news source i trust.
7 | Brandon Boger | 1540120619341296_1540169036003121 | Nbc is a joke, media is corrupt. Not one bad thing said about Hillary, the women who belongs in jail. Trying to make Trump look bad but Americans are going to see through this.
8 | Tammy Goyne | 1540120619341296_1540165846003440 | Media is biased. Hillary may be a better speaker but she's made a life out of it. She lied all night and avoided several things. She is crooked and she is dirty.
9 | Brittaney Gresham | 1540120619341296_1540161082670583 | Umm, NBC you are lying. Unions for ICE members endorsed him. Two separate organizations that represent Border control personal did in fact endorse him. I do believe there is a police related union that did as well
10 | Rex Tilton | 1540120619341296_1540160286003996 | So you want to vote for Hillary Clinton. Understand she will open the immigration flood gates. Think what you want, Russia has zero respect for her and that will lead to some very big problems if she is elected. I don't like what Donald Trump says but his words don't come close to the Clinton's actions. Hillary Clinton will appoint very liberal Supreme Court Justices and that will lead to a disaster. Think about this when you are in the ballot box. She will keep Obama Care and it is a disaster.
11 | Elena Gabriel Pizano | 1540120619341296_1540185519334806 | I'm sorry; but where are Hillarys "fact checks"?  I am not for either candidate, but I would like for NBC to be fair and treat both candidates the same!
12 | Jimmy Christopher | 1540120619341296_1540183872668304 | NBC news has lost me forever they are so BIOS and it shows, I am so amazed THAT A NEWS MEDIA IS THIS BAD, I would rather never know the news then to listen to it from this media source
13 | Lloyd Bradshaw | 1540120619341296_1540165929336765 | What´s the purpose of the mainstream media? Saying that the press exists to inform, educate or entertain is like saying Apple corporation´s primary function is to make technology which will enrich our lives. Actually, the mass media industry is the same as any other in a capitalist society: it exists to make profit. Wake up America and check out the facts for yourself!
14 | David-Julia Schachter | 1540120619341296_1540173312669360 | I'm a bit confused about Democrats and this irresponsible liberal news network criticizing Donald Trump for saying "he will look at the results at the time" instead of promising to accept the results of the election. Hillary said that was unprecedented. But didn't Al Gore contest the election with Bush resulting in a Supreme Court case?
15 | Daniel Oliver | 1540120619341296_1540169346003090 | Seems like nbc news is behind hillary.. all reporters down trump and praise killary..get reporters that look at both sides and not biased opinions themselves.. keep it equal for the American people..
16 | Madeline Walker Arsement | 1540120619341296_1540179932668698 | NBC keeps saying Trump wo'nt accept who wins. That is not what he said, but they will keep saying it. It's very scary when these idiots on NBC dissects Trump, but hasn't said a word about Hillary. She is a liar & a criminal. If they agree with her, they are too. They are controlling this.They need to stop lying about what he said.
17 | Jenn Baker Rock | 1540120619341296_1540166599336698 | Why is it that we are not fact checking her this is why he says it is rigged. Not a fan of either but it is insane how much the media is controlling this election
18 | Johanna Scheffer Notaro | 1540120619341296_1540163432670348 | They sure as hell did. But would not trust your facts anyway. And Hillary saying that 90% of there foundation goes to charity is one big fat lie. They spend millions of dollars just on travel alone. She deserves a oscar for lying so well.
19 | Andrew Veale | 1540120619341296_1540170482669643 | I'm not voting for either, but how can you truly report as an "unbiased network" if you don't fact check the other candidate?
20 | David Boston | 1540120619341296_1540168129336545 | If federal agencies can't endorse candidates, why are Obama and Hillary flying around on Air Force One, campaigning for Clinton on the taxpayers' dime?
21 | Vanessa Marie Evans | 1540120619341296_1540206909332667 | Wow NBC..way to show the voters Trumps "outrageous" claims about you might actually be true! Good job. Thousands are now repeating the big caption thinking NBC proved Donald Trump lied about ICE endorsements...while NBC laughs. To be clear people NBC merely explained Trumps answer...even Hillary knew what he meant or she would have attacked "espionage"...I am still hurting over that rolling laugh...gotta love the irony.
22 | Ginger Alyson | 1540120619341296_1540184379334920 | Federal agencies themselves may not endorse candidate but somehow a sitting POTUS not only endorses a candidate but actively campaigns for he using taxpayer funds??? The First Lady and the VP endorse and campaign for her using taxpayer funds as well. I have no problem with saying " I endorse her" but I have a major problem with using taxpayer funds to campaign for her. Disgusting!
23 | Shawna Y Raymond Gallardo III | 1540120619341296_1797153910570585 | Wait NBC let's be a little more clear....Trump said ICE endorsed him last week. YOUR fact says it's falseA union representing some ice agents endorsed him last month but Feds cannot and do not endorse...Is the false statement the time period? This is a false statement because it was three weeks prior to what he said. So he's wrong....
24 | Fred Bressette | 1540120619341296_1540175649335793 | She insulted him about his comments on women but when asked about her husbands treatment of women she talked about trump again she didn't answer half questions just insulted and dodge questions. The news still talking about trumps treatment of women guess they didn't hear the question about how bill treated women. Oh wait it's the news nothing can be said about the ClintonsIf she raises taxes on big corporations and 25% of them leave the country and take jobs with them how does that help American families.
25 | Mandie Verlinger | 1540120619341296_1540180069335351 | Are we to assume by these "fact checks" that Clinton was 100% honest? And then to assume that you are 100% nonbiased? I'm so confused on  why there aren't any fact checks on her? Which would also lead me to assume that your fact checks are one sided and not fair to both parties. The voters deserve better.

9 | Glenn Macduck | 1540141789339179_1168063266589046 | Too funny. Gore sued after the vote because he refused to accept the results....Al Gore...democrat....sued because his feelings were hurt by election results
10 | Cecilia McDermott | 1540141789339179_890126241088631 | Let's do some better reporting NBC Donald did NOT say he would not accept the outcome of the election. Rewind and check it out and get it right!!!!
11 | Troy Torrison | 1540141789339179_1260551770663727 | Hillary was a very competent Senator and a highly effective Secretary of State. You know what you're getting. A popular leader who works hard.
12 | Letty Johnson Ryan | 1540141789339179_1540145662672125 | No handshake because he grabs females by their private parts! Can't blame her!
13 | Sonny Saggar | 1540141789339179_1168075636587809 | The candidate who disrespects our country's conventions does not deserve to win. That moment will swing many of the undecided. In fact, it'll lose him the few remaining educated supporters he had.
14 | Becky Haynes Cox | 1540141789339179_1540147986005226 | NBC SUCKS! So freaking biased! They need to go ahead and merge with maybe the National Equirer. Same level of true "news" reporting

17 | Sharon Cobb | 1540141789339179_905832139546770 | Hillary believes it is a woman's right to make her own medical decisions. The government has no place telling any woman what to do with her body. This ain't the handmaids tale.
18 | Richard Esguerra | 1540141789339179_1420097731353087 | 22million emails deleted by Bush White House....no one questions that? compared to 33,000 emails...Then they want to prosecute her.... First Prosecute Karl Rove and then we can look at Hillary

2 | Brittaney Gresham | 1540115406008484_1540140206006004 | Are you going to fact check Hillary? Or only Trump? Your bias is showing again.
3 | Brenden Donaldson | 1540115406008484_1540141646005860 | If those woman are not lying why did they wait to come out? Why not come out years ago? When he was a TV star? Or a powerful business man? Or why not come out when he started to run for President? Why wait until the 11th hour?
4 | Brandon O'Guin | 1540115406008484_1540162022670489 | Hey, NBC, not one "Fact Check" on Hillary, huh? Yeah, because, you know, she hasn't been a serial liar for decades. I'm sure everything she said in the debate was 100% truth. Lololol #YourBiasIsShowing
5 | Raja Wahid | 1540115406008484_1540140979339260 | How to interpret constitution = Hillary won & Trump was confused and stuck in his own logicsSecond amendment = Hillary wonIssue of  women right to abortion = Hillary won & Trump tried to avoid the question with blah blah #womb #NinthMonthIssue of immigration = Trump still want the wall and says drugs are coming and want the immigrants out & Hillary not in flavour of deportation of 15 million ppl but in favour of boarder security and deportation of violent pplDo you condemn the interference of Russians = Tumps was yes and again saying don't know Putin & Hillary said it's been reported by 17 state agencies that Russia is meddling the election process but the results is 60% trump and 40% HillaryTaxation system and economy = Hillary, minimum wage, equal wage, tuition free college and new jobs and big corporations pay more taxes and TRUMP didn't responded the question but stuck with NATO and Saudi Arabia and other alleys to pay for security #HillaryWonGroping women by Trump and issues of Clinton = trump said all the women are paid characters by Hillary campaign and Hillary quoted all the instances and exposed his nasty character of groping women #HillaryWonClinton foundation = 11 million are the beneficiary Hillary responded & added that CF has the highest rating and raised 30 million for Haitians #HillaryWonElection is rigged = Trump said that he will decide on Nov 09 whether to accept the results or not and further added that media is corrupt and it makes the election rigged. Hillary said that trump don't trust either FBI, RNC, Judges etc and it's his mindset #HillaryWonIraq and ISIS, boots on the ground?= Hillary said that we will support Iraqi army and don't want boots on the ground but will do arial attacks on ISIS and will look for political solution. Trump still wants the element of surprise in his attack on enemy which is illogical and will result in collateral damage #HillaryWonSyria and Aleppo = Trump added Syrian refugees are troggen horses however, Hillary said that we should go for political solution and added won't stop refugees and will work with Muslim communities!! #HillaryWonNational debt = Trump said will increase GDP growth increased by 5 to 6% which seems to be unrealistic however, Hillary said that she will add nothing to national debt and added will make the big corporations to pay more tax #HillaryWon
6 | Cory R Courtois | 1540115406008484_1540143066005718 | Not for nothing, but are you going to vet any of Killary's comments like this? I've seen none. Ahhh, for the good old days when journalists weren't shills for a campaign.
7 | Wayne Garrison | 1540115406008484_1540166446003380 | Thanks NBC, so nice to be bombarded by the nonstop Hillary love. It's so nice to see the constant bias. I see not one single feed where you fact checked Hillary. Looking good douchebags.
8 | Carol Ann Haworth | 1540115406008484_1540147552671936 | Think about it, they are coming from a foreign country with different customs and language. They will not be ready to work as soon as they get here. They will be on social programs.... ALL ON YOUR NICKEL! Go vote! And think about your paycheck.
9 | Cory Bordelon | 1540115406008484_1540206199332738 | NBC you have yet to post one negative thing about Senator Clinton. Yet everyday it's constant negative talk against Mr. Trump. It's clear where your political views lie. All I ask is if you're going to do "fact checks" do them for both candidates!
10 | Gene Manning | 1540115406008484_1540142382672453 | I am done with the media...they are so biased! NBC is the worst ever
11 | Danny Corso | 1540115406008484_1540172662669425 | NBC runs this story and doesn't cover WikiLeaks and pay to play and 33,000 deleted emails and the doesn't touch the James O'Keefe videos that show Bob Creamer and others sighting they are paind by the DNC and the Clinton campaign to insight violence and riots at Trump rallies. Nor does NBC cover the fact that Bob Creamer visitied the White House 960 plus times including 87 times with Obama. They run these accusations as if they are true . The mainstream media is in the tank for Hillary.
12 | Joey Holasz | 1540115406008484_1540172679336090 | NBC doesn't fact check [her]? This is the meaning behind biased "rigging." Not voting for either. America loses regardless but the media hasn't helped any.
13 | Robert Kalakewich | 1540115406008484_1540190262667665 | Oh, but they have... NBC wonders why no one watches their "News".... Fox News eats NBC "News" for lunch... and the ratings prove it!
14 | Angus Macgregor | 1540115406008484_1540155372671154 | How can everyone including NBC call this a fair election process.And I wonder what Equador was threatened with to shut up wiki leaks.
15 | Katrina Howard | 1540115406008484_1540162866003738 | My husband has said far worse things in public than what trump said behind closed doors. Just saying. Most men talk nasty and if you don't believe they do , then go hang out on a construction sight or with iron workers. They will teach you.
16 | Brian Young | 1540115406008484_1540141826005842 | The fact that no charges were ever made years ago, and they are just now coming out, and no legal charges being made...that largely debunks the political maneuvers.
17 | DeeDee Taylor | 1540115406008484_1540190512667640 | Ugh, NBC enough already. We are capable of fact checking ourselves. They both lie like rugs, stop pushing your liberal agenda.
18 | Sherry Armstrong-Seifert | 1540115406008484_1540161432670548 | PLEASE for the love.... People!!! It's not about Trump fondling women??? If that's the VERY worst thing the Clintons can dig up on DJT!!!? The list for Clinton would go on & on... Don't fall for the media misleading you off track! Remember, her lies, Benghazi, Pay to play, inciting violence, showing no remorse for placing U.S at risk & breaking the law countless occasions!!!
19 | Robin Lyon Rivas | 1540115406008484_1540155599337798 | It was shown in the wikileaks that the DNC paid people to be violent at the Chicago rally.  Is it so far fetched that they paid women to come out to falsely accuse Trump?
20 | Christ Mendoz | 1540115406008484_1540246395995385 | NBC how much $$$ did you give to Hilary 😂😂😂😂 because it's about the control of the human race Hillary has a lot of baggage as well say the thruth about how much you are giving her! About her lies!!  Real journalism...
21 | Tony Lee | 1540115406008484_1540245595995465 | Non bias as always nbc. This is why people are starting to hate our news outlets. When youre just a puppet for one candidate how can the public take you serious.
22 | Rachel Danielle Recca | 1540115406008484_1540140682672623 | Family coming out and saying they are lying doesn't count as a debunk? Emails begging for jobs doesn't count? Eye witnesses don't count?Wow....
23 | Laura Michaels | 1540115406008484_1540168639336494 | NBC is a liberal media outlet, no surprise here they, just like CNN never report anything negative about Hillary. Hell, I'd love to debate her on these same topics, especially with the economy and national debt.
24 | Linda Spott | 1540115406008484_1540180559335302 | Thanks, NBC! I knew this all along! Now if someone could just look at the released list of Trump Russian businesses, & verify it that would make my day!
25 | Tracey Brown | 1540115406008484_1540145629338795 | Remember when Hillary told Matt Lauer that the allegations of flandering in the oval office was a "vast right wing conspiracy".....well, it wasn't!!!

1 | Marisela DlCruz Bebawi | 1540119409341417_1540124409340917 | Thank you donald for handling the presidency so easily to Mrs. Clinton.She just had to let you talk.
2 | Carol S D'Agostino | 1540119409341417_1540130426006982 | You know it's not in his nature to accept defeat gracefully he's going to blame everyone involved of rigging the result, he's like a petulant child
3 | Beulah Marie | 1540119409341417_1540132619340096 | Hillary is actually the Puppet Master and her strings run throughout Washington. Trump will cut those strings and return control to the American people!!! 🇺🇸👌🏻👍🏻
4 | Erica Feit | 1540119409341417_1540133016006723 | You're disgustingly wrong in your efforts. If Clinton loses, Trump wins. That is a serious tragedy. While I do not believe Clinton is the answer to our country's problems, Trump points to our demise. Until our country can effectively elect an official from neither dominant party and only elect based on morals/beliefs/history of the candidate, we will not see the change we need. Protect us from Trump by voting for Clinton.
5 | Julien Aklei | 1540119409341417_1540157506004274 | It feels so wrong how NBC instantly starts bashing Trump the second the debate is over. They shouldn't host the debate if they can't be impartial.
6 | Allison Tysinger | 1540119409341417_1540138202672871 | Idiot. Proves it every time he opens his mouth. Bigly? Everything is a disaster? I know you are but what am I? Schoolyard retorts? He speaks like a 3rd grader. The only delusionals are those who think there is anything presidential about him or his character.
7 | Adam Allee | 1540119409341417_1540161382670553 | NBC!!! You people are liars!! He never said he would accept or Deny the results. He just didn't answer the question. You guys are manipulating!!!!!
8 | Debra McKenzie | 1540119409341417_1540184619334896 | Ok...my two cents..I'm so tired of the media deciding what the headlines tonight should be...and implanting thoughts and ideas in their audience heads to sway them to think their way....Yes ...Trump didn't say...first time in History...that he COULDN'T promise to uphold the outcome or decision of the Election ....Could you Blame him??? This isn't like any other election in our history!! Lies..distortion..you name it....I wouldn't promise either...WHO KNOWS what else can take place in 20 days....I applaude him for his HONESTY....he simply said...I DON'T KNOW...Now..their condemning him for it...GOD HELP US PLZZZZ!!!Ted Cruiz...Bush.....etc etc...pledged and then bc of unknown unforseen incidents took place that caused them to go against their principals..higher than that of a pledge changed their support...Point is....don't pledge if you don't know!
9 | Cindy Robinson Malott | 1540119409341417_1540180216002003 | Trump has a point. NBC is clearly trying to use their media platform to sway the voters towards Hilary; however, people aren't swayed that easily and can see through it.
10 | Michelle Morris-Rainer | 1540119409341417_1540166132670078 | Oh get over it media!  So he said he might protest the election. He has a right!  The crooked Clinton machine and years of crooked democratic votes it's his job. It's Americas job to hold these nasty lying political thugs accountable! This includes bought and paid for MSM hacks like you all at NBC too!
11 | Angelica Avila | 1540119409341417_1540157339337624 | Why wasn't Hilary asked the same question. And why did they let her get away with avoiding most questions they asked her. Especially regarding her foundation while she was Secretary of State and did so many favors for companies who made huge donations?
12 | Jim Harris | 1540119409341417_1540164032670288 | Nicolle Wallace you do not speak for all Americans. It's rigged because the News that I grew up watching doesn't give us the news anymore. NBC news spins to what their agenda is. I will no longer watch NBC shows or what they call News. I done with what they are peddling.
13 | Ryan Morefield | 1540119409341417_1540140169339341 | We need a body language expert to exam her while Mr Trump speaks on the millions of voters that shouldn't be registered to vote
14 | Martha Correa | 1540119409341417_1540212459332112 | Only Hillary Clinton was caught lying to congress.Only Hillary Clinton in 1974 was fired from a job (Watergate Committee) for being unethical.Only Hillary Clinton deleted 33,000 emails after she was ordered to hand them over to the Fed.Only Hillary Clinton had that same computer server wiped (BleachBit) clean by professionals.Only Hillary Clinton got the rapist of a teenage girl off on rape charges then laughed about it.Only Hillary Clinton lied to the American people about Benghazi.Only Hillary Clinton lied to the American people about her emails.Only Hillary Clinton lied about being under sniper fire.Only Hillary Clinton lied about lying to the American people.Only Hillary Clinton was involved in "Cash Cow"Only Hillary Clinton has a long list of scandals.Only Hillary Clinton nationally belittled her husband's sexual harassment and rape accusers.Only Hillary Clinton is a career politician.Only Hillary Clinton will not release her speeches to Goldman Sachs and other banks.Only Hillary Clinton is tied to Monsanto.Only Hillary Clinton was labeled " Extremely careless " about national security by the FBI !Only Hillary Clinton said she will raise taxes on the middle class.Only Hillary Clinton benefited from the DNC rigging an election !Only Hillary Clinton had to return stolen items from the White House.Only Hillary Clinton said the Benghazi victims parents where lying.Only Hillary Clinton wants you to vote for her based on her gender.Only Hillary Clinton has no real accomplishments after a lifetime in politics.Only Hillary Clinton has never created any jobs.Only Hillary Clinton has been investigated by the FBI and found to have put national security at risk.Only Hillary Clinton has had two or more movies and several documentaries made about her questionable ethics and integrityOnly Hillary Clinton was called "Broomstick one" by the Secret ServiceOnly Hillary Clinton made congress and others spend millions and millions of tax dollars having hearings and investigating her to find that she lied, that would not have been spent if she would of simply told the truth in the first place ! Fact - all facts !Only Hillary Clinton regularly cussed out and belittled her Secret Service detail.Shall I go on...?
15 | Violet Lee Eubank | 1540119409341417_1540189729334385 | well the DNC will play that up big and ignore her flip flop on several issues as he pointed out. But then we know she says what she thinks people want to hear and he just says what he things and feels. Rather have honesty than pleasing lies.
16 | Bonnie Cantrell | 1540119409341417_1540156902671001 | It is not up to him it's up to us the people it doesn't matter what he said the people are going to do what they want they aren't going to let her become president and everyone knows and they are trying to get him to talk the people down. People r done with the corruption with the government and the media. They should take that into consideration when they do and say what they do. It's sad that they think he can control the people he just gave them a voice. Damage control would be for them to prosecute her.
17 | Frank Rakich | 1540119409341417_1540195109333847 | And I see nothing wrong with Donald Trump said keep you in suspense The way the whole campaign is been run look at Hillary Clinton how corrupt all the people that she has paid to say bad things about Donald Trump look how corrupt she has been through the whole campaign why should it be traditional at the end when the whole freaking thing is been nothing but out to get Donald Trump to discredit him when it should've been all about Hillary Clinton and all the mistakes and lies that she pulled
18 | Karolyta Marberry | 1540119409341417_1540215109331847 | It's funny how Hillary will not give any truthful answers. When it comes to those emails. And just look at how mad she is getting. If there was nothing to those emails. Then it should not bother her. This women is corrupt just like the government is. The reason the government doesn't want Donald Trump to win. Is because he doesn't play by there rules. Food for thought.
19 | Linda Jackson | 1540119409341417_1540241845995840 | Hillary got caught with her earpiece in the other debate so someone can't tell her what to say. She had to take days off before this debate to memorize her lies, I mean lines. 30 years in politics and she has gotten NOTHING DONE. She couldn't even handle the Secretary of State position and had to step down. Thousands of emails destroyed and lying under oath. Unbelievable people will cast a vote for her.
20 | Nancy Vestal | 1540119409341417_1540220529331305 | Well, I wouldn't accept it either, because the DNC is pulling every trick in the book to rig the election, dead people voting, going to homes for mentally ill people and signing them up to vote for Democrats, hiring illegals to give them an ID etc, etc. Why should we trust the results if it goes to Hillary when we know she's trying to derail the election.
21 | Hector Perez | 1540119409341417_1540215025998522 | I watched the comments made by Kayleigh and Jeffrey After the debate. No wonder Trump is a lost soul. If I had these two idiots coaching me to run for president I would have booted them out a long time ago.The one thing I can say about Donald Trump. Your a Duck so get the Quack out of here while you have a chance.
22 | Kana Chandler Lones | 1540119409341417_1540157509337607 | What debate was Nicole looking at. He didn't say he wouldn't support her he said he will keep folks on the edge and will know closer to election time. Lester Holt is so damBias it makes me sick. Get him off the air. Geeze
23 | Star Amber Nelson Ridsdale | 1540119409341417_1540177679335590 | if the election is rigged then the American people should revolt. That is unacceptable in our free world where votes count. Killary is a liar and does so without hesitation. That is her scariest trait.
24 | Jared Hollis | 1540119409341417_1540182952668396 | With all the apparent fraud being exposed by emails at the highest levels of government why would trump in his right mind say he would automatically accept the results of presidential election.
25 | Sara Em | 1540119409341417_1540138182672873 | He is clinically insane and an embarrassment to this country. He is strictly an entertainer, if you can even call him that. Go back to reality TV drumpf, you have no place in the white house.

1 | Joshua Duncan Starks | 1540110816008943_1540121662674525 | "Believe" is not "know for certain".Is this a joke?
2 | Zachary Criscuolo | 1540110816008943_1540126256007399 | It says "believe" there is no definite proof! Shut up you liberal loser Chanel, NBC you should be ashamed. Assisting her to win off lying and cheating. What a shame!
3 | Beulah Marie | 1540110816008943_1540122826007742 | Hillary  is actually the Puppet Master and her strings run throughout Washington. Trump will cut those strings and return control to the American people!!! 🇺🇸👌🏻👍🏻
4 | Mark Anthony Ramirez | 1540110816008943_1540122836007741 | They "Believe"???  What kind of "fact checking" is that?As I've posted many times already, NBC "news" fact-checking the debate is like a 5th grader grading his own homework.
5 | Graham Daily | 1540110816008943_1540124659340892 | "Believe" but have no proof either....Fact remains what was leaked are damming FACTS against Clinton. Since we are talking facts and all
6 | Nana Nonana | 1540110816008943_1540126192674072 | only one candidate has american blood on their hand and that is hillary clinton. So much lies coming out of her mouth and her twisting words to make trump look bad
7 | Nelly Aldarondo | 1540110816008943_1540129312673760 | NBC only fact checks Trump!! How piggish and disgusting!! It shows how the liberal media is so much pro a woman who is a criminal with evil intent for our country!!!!
8 | Andreas Lohne | 1540110816008943_1540131176006907 | You'll notice that not once does she respond to the content. For all of her revealed crimes, she doesn't even respond to them. She just deflects "You were never meant to find out about that and you wouldn't have if not for Russia "
9 | Joyce Perkinson Winters | 1540110816008943_1540138632672828 | I don't give a rats azz if they are behind it or what their reasoning for it is. The American people have a right to know the information that is being provided by WikiLeaks.
10 | Joy Holley | 1540110816008943_1540126856007339 | Clinton has political experience. She actually understands this process. She's been to law school. Trump is just flying by the seat of his pants and sadly he's got a bunch of people flying with him.
11 | Brittaney Gresham | 1540110816008943_1540122832674408 | One thing we do know for sure, Hillary if she stays on her current position will be sending us to war with Russia.We are not ready for another long drawn out war. I rather have someone who doesn't go around blaming Russia and making the friction worse than someone who is blaming Russia for everything and wants to impose policies even our current administration is against.
12 | Kandi Reimers | 1540110816008943_1540140482672643 | Last time I checked, belief and fact are two different things. It very well may be Russia. But honestly, who cares, are they not clintons words? Is she not trying to hide them? That's what I care about, not WHO exposes her, but what they expose!
13 | Aly Acosta | 1540110816008943_1540196789333679 | At this point does it really matter who the hell is behind it? Wikileaks is 100 % accurate!! She's currupted and dishonest and she will break any rule/law to get where she wants. If it's Russia we should send them a thank you note for at least trying to prevent this Hillary disaster to become President!!!
14 | Tony Ocasio | 1540110816008943_1540181872668504 | What bothers me when she said she's going to draw a line in the sand no-fly zone in Syria what are you going to do with Russia if they cross that line are you trying to tell me you're going to start World War 3 over Syria are you kidding me but let me tell you something in the Bible the last days the war will start in the Middle East.
15 | Jean Nadwodny Schacherbauer | 1540110816008943_1540165489336809 | NBC one sided. Why didn't you talk to Mr. Trumps Campaign Manager. So obvious, really.  The Americans really do see what's going on. We Are Not Stupid.
16 | Anne Garrity-Balfe | 1540110816008943_1540135512673140 | Who cares who's behind it?  The fact is, she used a private unsecured server for government business. And those emails belong to the American people
17 | Ryan Prouse | 1540110816008943_1540129176007107 | Its funny. All you see is Trump fact checks. But, what about Hillary? Don't see any for her? Maybe the media really is on her side. Just sayin!
18 | Rebecca Madden | 1540110816008943_1540226305997394 | CNN's Wolf Blitzer said just today that they suspect it is russia but are not saying that publicly yet.  in any case, the point is what was in the e-mails. even if it ewas russia, that  does not change the fact that these things happen. wikileaks is very thorough and states that they have never had a mistake in ten years. let us not quibble over who hacked them and forget the significance of the findings. hillary is a master deflector.
19 | Ken Mullins | 1540110816008943_1540210352665656 | I don't necessarily agree with Donald Trump but if you notice the careful wording is that US intelligence officials "believe" that the Russians are behind these hacks. Nothing is said about irrefutable proof.
20 | Daniel Glover | 1540110816008943_1283926874985767 | They believe but that doesn't mean it's a fact! Russia has been the boogeyman for the Democratic Party for a while and I don't understand. Don't say that Donald Trump is wrong if you're coming up saying that they believe the Russians are behind it!
21 | Thomas Cummings | 1540110816008943_1283941101651011 | Does it matter whether it's Russia China Reb party...fact is they were her thoughts ideas and words own up to them and stop trying to spin it...it's really sad that Wikileaks and Veritas has to do the work that our media and honest journalism used to do...SO SAD
22 | Bernard Crowley | 1540110816008943_1236410509712674 | As Hillary would say..." what difference does it make at this point " !!.".....whether it was Russia...or some video....don't shoot the messenger.....do you have a problem with the message ?
23 | Greg Forby | 1540110816008943_1540215915998433 | Hey, NBC, not one "Fact Check" on Hillary, huh? Yeah, because, you know, she hasn't been a serial liar for decades. I'm sure everything she said in the debate was 100% truth. Lololol #YourBiasIsShowing
24 | Emily Trevino | 1540110816008943_1283949981650123 | The Claim - everything in the emails as presented. The Truth - everything in the email as presented. LOL nice deflection of Fact check. Maybe lets read and hear about some of those facts in those emails rather than fact checking if russia is involved. LOL I don't care about who gave the info just that it exists and the content is true and impactful to this country. Focus on that.
25 | Kassie Saine | 1540110816008943_1236411049712620 | Believe is not certain. I love that this was pointed out in so many comments. It is also exactly what Trump said, that she can't be sure. I also just love the comment that NBC  doing it's own fact checking is like a 5th grader grading their own homework. NBC and other Media sources are so terrible. It is so crystal clear how bias they really are. Sad, how about reporting on the issues instead of the underhanded bias crap that doesn't amount to anything.

1 | Stacey Marie | 1540084186011606_1540107449342613 | Why are you only fact checking Trump? Oh yeaaaaa mainstream media is in Dems pockets
2 | Emerson Senden | 1540084186011606_1540107582675933 | Not a single thing he said tonight has been true. I'm honestly embarrassed that my country allowed this man to build his so called business in the first place. (AKA paying people to build his brand and allow him to take the credit.) what a deplorable. #ImWithHer
3 | Nicole Anzilotti | 1540084186011606_1540120496007975 | I have lost all respect for #NBC as you are so biased in reporting/sharing the news to the people...your coverage of Donald trump is old and played out and it reminds me of a young child throwing a fit screaming trying to get their way! I would actually respect your reporting on Donald Trump if you reported on all the horrific things Hillary has done as well, but you don't.
4 | Tina Henry | 1540084186011606_1540114779341880 | I will vote in anyway I can to prevent the most corrupt treasonous Hillary from becoming President! Whether you are a progressive or conservative or anything in between, you should do the same if you love this country! #NeverHillary
5 | Barbara Healey | 1540084186011606_1540107962675895 | Sorry, as someone who manages a budget worth millions of dollars, I know that's impossible. You can't give away a lot of free stuff including education, not cut anything from the budget, not raise taxes and be budget neutral.
6 | Brett Peine | 1540084186011606_1540117616008263 | How will we give free college for most Americans without raising taxes.... how will we do most of what she wants without raising taxes.... oh wait, she's a life long politician. She doesn't understand a balanced budget. Only spend, spend, spend.
7 | Ginger Alyson | 1540084186011606_1540117009341657 | Hmm. Her buddy Obama told me insurance would be more affordable and I could keep my doctor if I liked him. That was a lie. So is this! It is either a lie that middle class taxes aren't going to increase or it is a lie that she will be providing some other increased benefits such as free public tuition she is using to pander to millennial.
8 | Jan Johnson | 1540084186011606_1540134826006542 | I say we start a protest against NBC!  Why don't you fact check the fact that Hillary did not answer any of her questions about wikileaks!  Just like America wants talk about trump and his scandals we also want her to address the questions!!!
9 | Ipka Dachko Varuxa | 1540084186011606_1540112929342065 | If we make more than $125k we have to pay for college, but if you make less, you don't have to pay? Is that fair? Did you mention that this is Hillary's plan??
10 | Billi Ingram | 1540084186011606_1540121016007923 | So explain this to me: how can college education be "free" (tax-funded) for any family making less than $125k/year (which includes many people who can afford to pay for it) by only raising taxes on the people making $250k/year or greater? Are you telling me that they are going to get enough tax revenue from the 1% to pay for the majority to go to college? That is an outright lie! It doesn't make sense financially. The only way it would make sense would be to bankrupt the wealthy with tax liability in order to pay for the majority of the population's college tuition. Not going to happen. She is a liar! Think about it! She will either raise taxes on the middle class or nobody will get free college. There's no other way to pay for it. Period.
11 | Jon Cato | 1540084186011606_1540188182667873 | Your fact checking is bogus. Hillary Clinton straight up said she would raise taxes on middle class workers. Last time I checked middle class is not extremely rich. NBC News its time for you to stop with your blatant lies and biased to fit your agenda to make a push for Hillary. Your reporting is no different than Hillary herself standing up before the people with bald face lies
12 | Chris N Katie Gearhart | 1540084186011606_1540127332673958 | So he wasn't wrong is what I'm reading. She is raising taxes and you're trying to make it look as tho he is still somehow wrong. Do you even need a high school education to be a journalist?
13 | April Anderson | 1540084186011606_1540123766007648 | Your fact checking is actually wrong. She said TONIGHT she would start in the middle for "fixing" the tax problem. You need you get your "facts" straight before posting such bias stuff.
14 | Toby Swofford | 1540084186011606_1540125332674158 | Fact check. Clinton destroyed mutiple mobile devices that were subpoenad during an investigation. Clinton deleted emails after they had been subpoenad. Clinton was not charged after her husband met with AG Lynch.
15 | Barbara Jackson Cassiliano | 1540084186011606_1540130646006960 | NBC hired Chelsea Clinton fresh out of college and her starting pay was 600,000. Thousand dollars. Thanks to her mother. What a joke.
16 | Jennifer Johns | 1540084186011606_1540194732667218 | Why is NBC only fact checking Trump? Bias news---- shame on you! You are supposed to be balanced. Don't tell me Hillary didn't lie!!
17 | Terry Harden | 1540084186011606_1540140186006006 | Exactly why I do not watch NBC, ABC, CBS, CNN, MSNBC!  All are in the tank for democratic candidate regardless of who it is.  Been that way for decades!
18 | Oltiana Mehl | 1540084186011606_1540186002668091 | Here goes NBC campaigning for Hillary again. Hillary, says she would raise taxes on the rich. Trump responds: "You can't control those who sponsor you Hillary." Conclusion? More lies coming from Hillary. Is there anyone her that thinks the rich would sponsor Hillary, but then sit back and watch her take their wealth away? No idiot ever became rich, so obviously they won't let Hillary outsmart them. Hillary is just saying this hoping that there are enough idiots out there to believe her.
19 | Randi BornAgain Lewis | 1540084186011606_1540128152673876 | I think Mr Trump might be actually right with one thing,a biased media,where are the Clinton fact checks? It seems all the bad about hillary gets suppressed and the good greatly highlighted. And all the bad about trump gets highlighted and the good suppressed.Come on NBC,I can't vote as yet,but when I can,I want to know that I'll have fairness in every aspect to may my decisions from
20 | Alexander Xochihua | 1540084186011606_1540184472668244 | I IMMEDIATELY discredit NBC news from this point as a trustworthy news agency when they immediately spin the debate anti trump at the end, but ask the audience to not applaud or boo, so that the audience at home can make their own decision. NBC=HYPOCRITE PROPAGANDISTS.
21 | Jackie Page | 1540084186011606_1540169702669721 | NBC - Clinton Cheerleaders You are such incredible hypocrites totally ignoring all the illegal & morally corrupt actions of the Clinton's.
22 | Cheyenne Ridgeway | 1540084186011606_1540121696007855 | This man is an embarrassment. Look: a tantrumming, name-calling child on the world stage. We should hang our heads in shame that this man is running for president. He is a national disgrace!
23 | Sarah Gilmore | 1540084186011606_1540123712674320 | Why do y'all even act like Americans have a choice? Like our voices matter. Doesn't matter who wins really, even though it's gonna be Hillary.. America's gonna end up wiped off the map either way.
24 | Dennis G. McAuliffe | 1540084186011606_1540109189342439 | Mr. Trump’s tax plan is similar to other recent tax reform proposals put forward by the Republican Congress and the Obama administration, in that all these plans lower tax rates, close loopholes, and scale back deductions and breaks in the code. However, the scale of the changes Mr. Trump is proposing is many times larger. According to an analysis by the Tax Policy Center, the static cost of his tax proposals—not accounting for the impact of the proposals on the economy and what that means for government tax revenue and spending—is $9.5 trillion over the next decade compared with current law. Tax revenues as a percent of GDP will fall to their lowest point on a sustained basis since WWII.All taxpayers receive a tax cut under Mr. Trump’s plan, but most of the cuts go to those with the highest income. High-income and wealthy households will benefit substantially from the lower marginal rates on income, dividends and capital gains. The alternative minimum tax and estate and gift taxes will be eliminated. Carried interest, which accrues to wealthy investment managers, will be taxed at the plan’s low business tax rates. And the surcharge on investment income that high-income households currently pay to help fund Obamacare will be repealed. The tax code under Mr. Trump’s plan will thus be much less progressive than the current tax code. More than one-third of the proposed tax cuts on personal income will go to the top 1% of income earners, with the average taxpayer in this group receiving a reduction in their tax bill of $275,000. Taxpayers in the bottom 99% of income earners will receive a tax cut of less than $2,500.Under Trump's plan, the conservative Tax Foundation expects that the bottom 80 percent of Americans will see just 0.8 percent to 1.8 percent more income after his tax cuts. Clinton's plan will only increase taxes for America's wealthiest earners.

3 | Tim Oswald | 1540065492680142_1540089652677726 | NBC, Nobody But Clinton. Such a shame, you used to not take sides and report the news with honest investigative reporting, now you obviously take sides. Save that for MSNBC.
4 | Jeremy Schiano Di Colella | 1540065492680142_1540084872678204 | The claim : chicago protesters were bought. The fact : THEY WERE PAID BY THE DNC !
5 | Oscar Garcia | 1540065492680142_1540090159344342 | Hilary said she wants to protect toddlers and at the same token she wants to ripped them out of the womb. Hmmm..that really make sense. Smh
6 | Maria Commesso | 1540065492680142_1540090252677666 | That is a total lie.  She said she wants a global western hemisphere.  She wants North America and South America like the European Union, where everyone can just go everywhere,  The fact checkers need fact checking.
7 | Erik Sabine | 1540065492680142_1540088169344541 | Still...NBC I challenge you...Fact check one freaking thing about Hillary!!
8 | Kennedy Alajemba | 1540065492680142_1540085639344794 | If Trump thinks he can intimidate Hillary, he's dead wrong. He's a bully and known as such. He's so ignorant. Again, why does Chris Wallace keep cutting her off when she talks?
9 | Laura Elisabeth McMorris | 1540065492680142_1540090319344326 | So glad we have an unbiased media.....that is okay. Most Hillary supporters aren't capable of seeing the truth even if you were to spend your time pointing it out.
10 | Janet Dunnivan | 1540065492680142_1540096056010419 | Her speech states that she wants open borders.trump is right...build a huge wall to keep these people out..Obama took our social security away from us to support non American people that are pure terrorist... 100%trump.
11 | Sharon Lovell | 1540065492680142_1540094789343879 | Ok so if it's not rigged why are there videos all over showing the Democratic Party talking about destroying votes of the Republican Party just so she wins. That is what you call rigged.
12 | Travis Smith | 1540065492680142_1540109782675713 | NBC, you're a joke. Your bias couldn't be more blatant. We've all seen the emails where she wants open borders. What happened to journalism? Where you report fair and honestly? Why do you not fact check Clinton?
13 | Joe Voyt | 1540065492680142_1540101822676509 | Didn't she just admit on national television she wants amnesty for 11 million undocumented immigrants? NBC are you out of touch with reality?
14 | Donna Hillard-Price | 1540065492680142_1540157556004269 | This is hilarious ... it has been quoted verbatim... she said open borders!! I am.very upset with NBC!!! Why do you keep twisting things ?? I didn't even watch your station today!! I gave FOX my attention
15 | Patty Lee | 1540065492680142_1540087729344585 | That is a lie she has said it more than once and it was in the things that came out.  NBC you are lying.
16 | Brittaney Gresham | 1540065492680142_1540084792678212 | That is what the email said. Hence his comment and why the host asked about it
17 | Janet Dunnivan | 1540065492680142_1540099029343455 | Yes..this election Is rigged..Hillary should be in jail for all the things she's done .feeding money to Isis...and so much more...lies and more lies Hillary can never be trusted again
18 | Timothy Wozniak | 1540065492680142_1540099692676722 | Hillary Clinton in 2013 said she dreams of a “common market with open trade and open borders,” saying that economic opportunity in the U.S. would grow as a result.
19 | Torri Zapata | 1540065492680142_1540109556009069 | I don't trust the bias media! You can't secure your borders but allow everyone in without checking who they are first! As trump said, he will secure the borders and SPEED up the process to come in LEGALLy like it should be! The process as it is now is impossible and costly! With her, she wants to bring in thousands of people without vetting them first! #TRUMP/ PENCE 2016
20 | Diana Stewart | 1540065492680142_1540164626003562 | Ok NBC  you have about pissed me off. Journalist are supposed to be biased towards the news. Fact: Fact: Fact:  yet when you show items only on one side of the fence then your being biased. Clinton says that the Clinton Foundation donates large percentage when in fact FACT: look it up. It's like only 8 percent that is donated. Rest is for travel, expenses, etc.  Look it up and do your math.Biased idiots
21 | Tracey Pollard | 1540065492680142_1799757306934130 | Wow NBC, based on the comments, you guys have shot yourself in the foot. So many people see how biased you are. You are going to lose a lot of viewers because you wanted to help Hillary get elected. Our family hasn't watched NBC in a long time and don't plan to ever again.
22 | Breannah Jones | 1540065492680142_1540088476011177 | Why don't they both just tell the truth and own up!!!! trump about his sexual harassment claims and hillary over her deleted email claims. Quit beating around the bush, both of em! What happen to integrity and honesty!
23 | Wendy Cronin Lancaster | 1540065492680142_1540142159339142 | Hillary Clinton is nothing but a lier hope she gets put in Prison where all murders belong crazy fool all for killing babies what is wrong with you people you support someone like that there is no help for her...
24 | Elmer Zink | 1540065492680142_1540101792676512 | Ah.. I see you go to an unreliable source, the Clinton website and quote that.. How about  her speech to Brazilian Bankers, where Hillary Clinton said,  "My dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders, some time in the future.
25 | Justin Strebe | 1540065492680142_1540099349343423 | Hay NBC maby you haven't noticed but there are two people on that stage, why don't you do your actual job not what Hillary is paying you to do.

4 | Lia King | 1540077966012228_1540091109344247 | The clinton foundation has done more good that Trump foundation, his foundation buy paintings for him and pay his lawsuits. It benefits him that is why they shut it down

7 | Erica Feit | 1540077966012228_1540139539339404 | You're disgustingly wrong in your efforts. If Clinton loses, Trump wins. That is a serious tragedy. While I do not believe Clinton is the answer to our country's problems, Trump points to our demise. Until our country can effectively elect an official from neither dominant party and only elect based on morals/beliefs/history of the candidate, we will not see the change we need. Protect us from Trump by voting for Clinton.
8 | Tomas Lee | 1540077966012228_1540094542677237 | wow - looks like Trump was forced to take a few Ritalin's before the debate, but they started wearing off 30mins into the debate!

10 | Reid Stonum | 1540077966012228_1540093459344012 | Hey NBC, if you are so "Hillary" why don't you talk about her comments about UFO's and that she said "we may have been visited". Hillary believes in aliens...according to the New York Times.
11 | Lynda Kravets Jenkins | 1540077966012228_1540129256007099 | The Donald is a bigot- he blames the "bad hombres" for border and drug problems. Wrong as usual. He has no grasp on reality and is still pouting over not winning an Emmy for his reality show.
12 | Theresa Salisbury | 1540077966012228_1540176296002395 | Ask yourself, what in the hell is in those 33 thousand emails that Clinton and Obama bleach bitted that, Wikileaks has? First Obama gave control of our internet to the UN then, he sensors FOX news and now.....he sent John Kerry to London to shut down Julian Assange. What in the hell is in those emails???  Ask this question on every single post! Lay it out just as I did. Make America think about what it is that Obama and Clinton is trying so hard to hide from us. Did they sell the US to the Saudis like reports have said in the past? And what does Putin know???
13 | Patricia Foulk-Reynolds | 1540077966012228_1540093529344005 | On the immigration:I wished he would have brought up the consumer consumption by immigrants and prove that the only reason why she wants open borders is yet gains for corporations and not the workers.
14 | Paul Albright | 1540077966012228_1540104226009602 | The bottom line should be: If you sneak into this country, even if you drop a baby while you're here, you should be rounded up and deported.
15 | Kathy Molly | 1540077966012228_1540119219341436 | When that 4 year old boys shoots your daughter let's see you feel bad then hill tgey are train little ones with grenades and guns. What hill ?  Everyone loves children but to train them to kill what do we do stand still.let um kill us????????
16 | Lisa Hopkins | 1540077966012228_1540136052673086 | Again Hillary is a class act! There are a gigantic amount of non-racist sane Americans who love our President, our country, our veterans, our disabled, our poor and if we all band together with the fellow countrymen and women who feel minorities are our equals we can show the Republicans what a United States looks and acts like!!! Stay safe and Vote for our country---VOTE BLUE!!!
17 | Wendell Davis | 1540077966012228_1540097809343577 | Hillary supports Open BordersFacts about the cost of illegal immigrants to the California Tax Payers.Washington, D.C., June 19, 2014: A study released by the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) finds that providing education, health care, law enforcement, and social and government services to illegal aliens and their dependents costs Californians $25.3 billion per year according to FAIR's report.The Fiscal Burden of Illegal Immigration on California Taxpayers. The state's 3 million illegal aliens and their 1.1 million U.S.–born children cost the average California household — headed by a U.S. citizen — $2,370 annually.Among the report's key findings:Funding the K-12 education for children who are themselves illegal aliens and for the citizen children of illegal aliens accounted for the largest share of the cost to taxpayers at $14.4 billion. These services included standard public school educations and supplemental English language instruction. Despite federal funding, the average per pupil expenditure is $10,450 each year.Justice and law enforcement costs — policing, court and incarceration — associated with illegal aliens soared to more than $4.4 billion.Medical services cost taxpayers approximately $4 billion, including $388 million associated with 68,000 births to illegal alien mothers.Public assistance — low-cost meal programs, free immunizations, etc. — are available to residents regardless of legal status. The $792 million price tag for these services is borne by California taxpayers.The report finds that taxes collected from illegal aliens amounts to about $3.5 billion annually."Twenty-five billion dollars a year in costs associated with illegal immigration represents a fiscal crisis that affects California's ability to meet its basic obligations to citizens and legal residents," said Dan Stein, president of FAIR. "While clearly the Federal government bears responsibility for its failure, or refusal, to enforce our immigration laws, in California's case many of the burdens of illegal immigration are self-induced."Despite overwhelming evidence that illegal immigration represents an unsustainable fiscal burden to the state, the California Legislature and local governments across the state continue to provide new benefits, new services, and new privileges to illegal aliens, even as the state neglects the needs and concerns of other Californians. The costs will continue to grow so long as the state continues to reward illegal immigration and impedes immigration enforcement. California taxpayers will continue to be the losers in this unhappy scenario," concluded Stein.How much will Hillary cost you and your State?

24 | Mark Anthony Ramirez | 1540077966012228_1540102716009753 | Trump said that he wanted to get bad hombres out of the U.S. and I don't get the controversy. I thought we all wanted them out.  I know that I do. Who wouldn't want the bad people out?
25 | Mark Mun | 1540077966012228_1540180812668610 | We’re in the seventh year of the slowest economic recovery since 1949. The proportion of working-age adults who are employed is the lowest in decades. Young African Americans face an unemployment rate of over 20 percent. The national debt has almost doubled; an American baby born today already owes more than $60,000. We’ve lost our Standard & Poor’s AAA credit rating. Cities and states face debt and pension crises of their own. Meanwhile, business profitsand durable goods orders are down, productivity is sluggish and 2 percent growth is the new normal. Economic inequality has increased; incomes are down; prices are up.The president’s signature “accomplishment,” Obamacare, is in a death spiral. Racial tensions are leading to riots. Violent crime is up sharply over the past 18 months. Life expectancy is falling for large segments of our population. The administration is conducting a war on fossil fuels,endangering our electric grid, while shoveling funds to green-energy boondoggles run by donors. The IRS, the FBI and the Justice Department are protecting political allies, punishing opponents and defying court orders. Title IX is used on campus to destroy due process and stifle speech. In the past 10 months, we’ve suffered terror attacks in San Bernardino, Calif., Orlando, St. Cloud, Minn., and Burlington, Wash., leaving 68 dead. Europe’s experience shows that if we continue these policies, we will suffer many more.The Middle East is in shambles. We gratuitously overthrew a stable government in Libya, creating a terrorist haven and getting our ambassador killed. We threw away victories in Iraqand Afghanistan. Syria is a humanitarian disaster. We sabotaged Iran’s Green Revolution andhalted sanctions, propping up and then funding with planeloads of cash a leading global sponsor of terrorism actively seeking nuclear weapons — all in a quest to reach an agreement so adverse to U.S. interests that it was not even submitted to the Senate. Iran is reportedly already violating it.This is not bad luck. It results directly from policies of the Obama administration that Clinton wants to continue.

12 | Linda Scallon | 1540064702680221_575558122634656 | Assault and harassment is about power. A man, perhaps feeling insecure about his masculinity or entitled about his status, uses assault to assert control and dominance over a woman.

4 | Ed E. T. Medeiros | 1540059649347393_1540070369346321 | And how does this prove his statement untrue? Guns will be obtained in any way possible by criminals who do not follow gun laws. The focus is on gun crime being big despite very strict gun laws.
5 | Roger Blankenship | 1540059649347393_1540085206011504 | So patheticIf the police were supported by the White House maybe innocent people would stop dying.Don't call the police when it hits your door step.
6 | Emily Smith Reaves | 1540059649347393_1540067312679960 | If her concern is toddlers getting shot or shooting other's how will tougher gun laws keep irresponsible fathers and mothers from leaving guns accessible to "toddlers"?
7 | Christina Smith | 1540059649347393_1540129832673708 | The media is SO biased. Stop listening to NBC, CNN, etc. They are afraid of what will happen if Hillary becomes president. Woosies. Grow a backbone and actually report on accurate news!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Check WikiLeaks and Project Veritas. Decide for yourself. The media is far too biased to actually report all news!!!
8 | Jeff Phillips | 1540059649347393_1540065602680131 | Here is a short resume of Hillary Clinton's accomplishments.1. Monica Lewinsky: Led to only the second president in American history to be impeached.2. Benghazi: Four Americans killed, an entire system of weak diplomatic security uncloaked, and the credibility of a president and his secretary of state damaged.3. Asia fundraising scandal: More than four dozen convicted in a scandal that made the Lincoln bedroom, White House donor coffees and Buddhist monks infamous.4. Hillary’s private emails: Hundreds of national secrets already leaked through private email and the specter of a criminal probe looming large.5. Whitewater: A large S&L failed and several people went to prison.6. Travelgate: The firing of the career travel office was the very first crony capitalism scandal of the Clinton era.7. Humagate: An aide’s sweetheart job arrangement.8Pardongate: The first time donations were ever connected as possible motives for presidential pardons.9. Foundation favors: Revealing evidence that the Clinton Foundation was a pay-to-play back door to the State Department, and an open checkbook for foreigners to curry favor.10. Mysterious files: The disappearance and re-discovery of Hillary’s Rose Law Firm records.11. Filegate: The Clinton use of FBI files to dig for dirt on their enemies.12. Hubble trouble: The resignation and imprisonment of Hillary law partner Web Hubbell.13. The Waco tragedy: One of the most lethal exercises of police power in American history.14. The Clinton’s Swedish slush fund: $26 million collected overseas with little accountability and lots of questions about whether contributors got a pass on Iran sanctions.15. Troopergate: From the good old days, did Arkansas state troopers facilitate Bill Clinton’s philandering?16. Gennifer Flowers: The tale that catapulted a supermarket tabloid into the big time.17. Bill’s Golden Tongue: His and her speech fees shocked the American public.18. Boeing Bucks: Boeing contributed big-time to Bill; Hillary helped the company obtain a profitable Russian contract.19. Larry Lawrence: How did a fat cat donor get buried in Arlington National Cemetery without war experience?20. The cattle futures: Hillary as commodity trader extraordinaire.21. Chinagate: Nuclear secrets go to China on her husband’s watch.
9 | Bart Johnson | 1540059649347393_1540132402673451 | More gun laws won't work Chicago has one of the highest crime rates in the country!! We need more guns in the hands of law bidding citizens
10 | Danny Nadal | 1540059649347393_1540070889346269 | Chicago does have some of the strongest gun laws regardless of what their officials believe. So everyone needs to pay the consequences because the thugs and crazies can't play nice?!
11 | Joe Begin | 1540059649347393_1540131872673504 | Ok liberal NBC thanks for the fact check. Chicago has one of the highest crime rates in the country. Those gun laws are working great there.
12 | Darryl Blackburn | 1540059649347393_1540119472674744 | Chicago has been violent since the 80's..that didn't just start happening. Nafta has been going on even when both Bush's were in  Office .. Bill Clinton isn't running for President....talk about stupid.
13 | Mitchell Snyder | 1540059649347393_1540091726010852 | Which proves gun laws don't work. We cannot stop the inflow of drugs from other countries what makes them think banning guns would have any other effect than what we see with drugs?
14 | Ryan Clark | 1540059649347393_1540101459343212 | Once again NBC you're full of it. Your "truth" does not relate to the claim. We the people are awake and see through your crap NBC.
15 | Paul Streiber | 1540059649347393_1540137822672909 | Most guns anywhere were first purchased "out of State" Funny how these lax gun law places don't have the violence. Like Vermont, no gun laws, lowest crime in the nation. Must be the guns get mean when they get to Chicago.
16 | Erica Feit | 1540059649347393_1540174919335866 | Trump supporters: You're disgustingly wrong in your efforts. If Clinton loses, Trump wins. That is a serious tragedy. While I do not believe Clinton is the answer to our country's problems, Trump points to our demise. Until our country can effectively elect an official from neither dominant party and only elect based on morals/beliefs/history of the candidate, we will not see the change we need. Protect us from Trump by voting for Clinton.
17 | Neomi Meir | 1540059649347393_1540092189344139 | Thousands of people in chicago got killed by gun violence, thats the only fact we care about. If he said the most strick or almost most, is completely irrelevant!
18 | Brandon O'Guin | 1540059649347393_1540154896004535 | That's precisely the point. All those laws do is make it very difficult, or impossible in some cases, for law-abiding citizens to have guns to defend themselves while the criminals who ignore those laws are able to arm themselves.
19 | Scott Bonnar | 1540059649347393_1540235205996504 | Ok NBC, time to fact check you. What is your source for most guns were brought from out of state? Also, no mention of the 3,475 people shot and 595 killed so far in Chicago? Both are a marked increase from last year.
20 | Kels Norwood | 1540059649347393_1540208215999203 | Yet they all find there way into the heart of the city... Looks like those laws have only effected the law abiding citizen and not those in which the law(s) were supposed to affect. Maybe if the politicians in the city got their funds cut and or withheld, then maybe just maybe, something would be done.
21 | Jo Ann Stephens | 1540059649347393_1540126079340750 | i leave in the chicago TV area and there are usualy somewhere between 150 to 300 deaths on a weekend. not every weekend, but enough weekends. that's crazy!! and they have ridiculously strict gunlaws. so how are being dying by being shot if there are no guns? because it's not true.  THERE ARE GUNS IN CHICAGO.
22 | John Bowman | 1540059649347393_1540118272674864 | So, if the US had Chicago laws, the guns would just come in from elsewhere. Like booze did and drugs, illegals and automatic weapons do.
23 | John Daniels | 1540059649347393_1540116092675082 | What difference does it make where they were bought? The citizens are denied the ability to protect themselve in the crime capital of the US!
24 | Stacie Gray | 1540059649347393_1540193789333979 | Chicago is over run with crime. Always has been... By mafia and later gangs, and crazy people.. either way what Trump said is true & anyone who thinks otherwise is foolish
25 | Mussell Taxii | 1540059649347393_1540203085999716 | Are you guys idiots.. of course they come from somewhere else... it doesn't matter if it's another state or another country. His point is stricter gun laws won't work #TrumpTrain #Trump2016

1 | Tomas Lee | 1325738610855721_1325740510855531 | wow - looks like Trump was forced to take a few Ritalin's before the debate, but it started wearing off 30mins into the debate!
2 | Madison Avenue | 1325738610855721_1325739857522263 | Hilary a True Leader Respecting another Leader!! President Obama
3 | Pam Rumisek Salinaz | 1325738610855721_1325742680855314 | Well Hilary, you turned your back on our Americans in Benghazi. Used your private email server to email government secrets, and you have the right to talk about espionage?
4 | Jon Sweitzer | 1325738610855721_1325745420855040 | If you're voting for Hillary and haven't educated yourself on the content of the emails released by Wikilieaks, then you're part of the problem with this country. If you've read up on the Wikileaks emails and you're still planning to vote for Hillary, then you are exactly what is wrong with this country.
5 | Dollie Jackson-Lord | 1325738610855721_1325744594188456 | I can not believe Donald Trump is making statements on national news that Russia is expanding their nuclear capability and America is doing nothing. Why would a presidential candidate make such as serious acquisition our nuclear ambitions.... that would be "Top Secret" and should not be discussed..... Unbelievable!
6 | Michael Coy | 1325738610855721_1325740477522201 | Hillary Clinton: I will not add a penny to our debt. - How about the trillions you are going to spend on WWIII ?
7 | John Bowers | 1325738610855721_1325741407522108 | Hillary wins hands down just from having the control not to fall to the floor laughing her azz off.
8 | Caroline Toepperwein | 1325738610855721_1325747227521526 | Really Hillary Clinton....you protected children? What about the child who was raped? Remember...you defended her attacker. Why did you not defend that child?!?
9 | Karen Warren | 1325738610855721_1325777077518541 | Republicans cut budget requesting funds for increased security at our embassies. George W used private email servers and also deleted thousands of these emails.
10 | Brent Diane McCulloch | 1325738610855721_1325745157521733 | As American hispanics, we are tired of how all of these coward racist liberals that hate America like Obama, Clinton, and their supporters are trying to turn this great country into a 3rd world one. Unfortunately, one of the biggest problems we have right now is the media and entertainment that are always trying to tell us how to think. They have created enough imbeciles that would re-elect a failure like Obama. Even more, we're supposed to bow down to anti-American Obama, love liberal policies no matter how destructive they are, love bigger enslaving government, and be in favor of illegal immigration because of the color of our skin... disgusting. That's why we support Donald Trump. Show everyone your support for Trump by buying the fantastic Trump Strong t-shirt at: www.teespring.com/trumpstrong .And let's Make America Great Again🇺🇸🇺🇸👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
11 | Jessie Perry | 1325738610855721_1325779947518254 | What kind of drugs are y'all on to support Hillary Clinton...She can lie all day long and y'all will suck it up...Trumps not perfect but he's not done the damage she has done and continues to do..but y'all just like to over look her crimes..
12 | Christopher Horn | 1325738610855721_1325745890854993 | She said that but so what. It's based on a lie. She totally took his Putin remarks weeks ago way out of context and is running them into the ground. That's a dirty politician. The real and important issue is the content of the emails. Maybe they had to do with espionage, maybe that's why they were deleted. She may not be in cahoots with Russia but her top campaign aide is a Arab Muslim that was editor of a radical islamist newspaper for twelve years... Therein (deep within, those deleted 33,000 emails) is your espionage
13 | Ben Thigpen | 1325738610855721_1325769924185923 | The reason we have wiki leaks and Russia involved is because we have never had a leader that was so incompetent as to use a private email server for classified materials, not be intelligent enough to know C stands for classified, and then try to destroy the evidence instead coming forward and try to protect the american people. Russia didn't cause the problem. Hillary did!
14 | Daisy Thomas | 1325738610855721_1325745407521708 | Hilary dont change the topic. Where is the 6 billion dollars. Trump created thousands of jobs to be exact. #SolidForTrumpForPresident2016
15 | Susan Stella | 1325738610855721_1325745047521744 | Her criminal activity is what started the hacking! She's just pissed that we the people, found out! I seriously pray this pos of a human, is haunted by the many, many souls she's taken! Rot in hades', killary!
16 | Leigh Owens | 1325738610855721_1325747704188145 | I'm telling you, she scares me just on the question about electing Supreme Court justices. She's not even close to the middle. #extremeleftistagenda #shesdesperateforthefarliberalvote
17 | Marlene Hincks | 1325738610855721_1325783080851274 | She has stated so many times that she hates "regular" people...Read The Emails , learn about her "true" mouth! Learn what she really calls minorities, poor & all who aren't "Elite"
18 | Tish Jo | 1325738610855721_1325750857521163 | I know I don't want to see our Amendments stripped from us,  I don't want to see coal plants closed due to ignorance,  making energy costs skyrocket, I don't want to see our health care resemble Canadas failed system, I don't want to see open borders where the vetting system is a joke and our safety is in jeopardy everyday of our lives, I don't want to continue to see our veterans who fought to keep our country safe treated like less deserving human beings than the illegal refugees being housed,  fed and given medical treatment for "being brave" by fleeing their country.
19 | Wayne Fleck | 1325738610855721_1325837877512461 | Donald Trump "I am rubber, you are glue, bounces off me and sticks on you" Basic third grade come back. 😜 oh yes and he is still a douche bag!😜🖕🏻
20 | Maureen Matt | 1325738610855721_1325814067514842 | Notice how Trump avoided talking about how he would address Social Security & Medicare funding and Wallace didn't follow up on it, because Trump and the GOP want to privatize social security and medicare and cut medicaid. All so the super wealthy can pay less in taxes!!
21 | Rosemary Hoormann | 1325738610855721_1325763644186551 | He hasn't made any sense on anything only about him. Who would even consider voting for this Republican candidate we as a Country should be ashamed that he is running for President.
22 | Erica Feit | 1325738610855721_1325796367516612 | Trump supporters: You're disgustingly wrong in your efforts. If Clinton loses, Trump wins. That is a serious tragedy.

Until our country can effectively elect an official from neither dominant party and only elect based on morals/beliefs/history of the candidate, we will not see the change we need.

23 | Robert Keyser | 1325738610855721_1325877180841864 | Hillary is the puppet... In fact, Hillary takes donations from Saudi Arabia and several other foreign governments and known felons. 15 or the 19 terrorists of the 9/11 attacks were citizens of Saudi Arabia. All facts... People need to go research this stuff and stop listening to Hillary and the media lies.
24 | Wendi Sargent | 1325738610855721_1325857890843793 | I cannot take credit for this, as I'm not the original author, but thought it is too important not to share.ALL Of A Sudden....Seven Short Years Have Passed!Before Obama, There was virtually no outlandish presence of Islam in America.• All of a sudden, Islam is taught in schools. Christianity and the bible are banned in schools.• All of a sudden we must allow prayer rugs everywhere and allow for Islamic prayer in schools, airports, and businesses.• All of a sudden we must stop serving pork in prisons.• All of a sudden we are inundated with law suits by Muslims who are offended by American culture.• All of a sudden we must allow burkas to be worn everywhere even though you have no idea who or what is covered up under them.• All of a sudden Muslims are suing employers and refusing to do their jobs if they personally deem it conflicts with Sharia Law.• All of a sudden the Attorney General of the United States vows to prosecute anyone who engages in 'anti-Muslim speech'.• All of a sudden, Jihadists who engage in terrorism and openly admit they acted in the name of Islam and ISIS are emphatically declared they are NOT Islamic by our leaders and/or their actions are determined NOT to be terrorism, but other nebulous terms like 'workplace violence."• All of a sudden, it becomes Policy that Secular Middle East dictators that were benign or friendly to the West, must be replaced by Islamists and the Muslim Brotherhood.• All of a sudden our troops are withdrawn from Iraq and the middle east, giving rise to ISIS.• All of a sudden, America has reduced its nuclear stockpiles to 1950 levels, as Obama's stated goal of a nuke-free America by the time he leaves office continues uninterrupted.• All of a sudden, a deal with Iran must be made at any cost, with a pathway to nuclear weapons and HUNDREDS of BILLIONS of dollars handed over to fund their programs.• All of a sudden America APOLOGIZES to Muslim states and sponsors of terror worldwide for acts of aggression, war, and sabotage THEY perpetrate against our soldiers.• All of a sudden, the American Navy is diminished to 1917 Pre-World War I levels Of only 300 ships. The Army is at pre-1940 levels. The Air Force scraps 500 planes and planned to retire the use of the A-10 Thunderbolt close air support fighter. A further draw down of another 40,000 military personnel is in progress.• All of a sudden half of our aircraft carriers are recalled for maintenance by Obama rendering the Atlantic unguarded, NONE are in the Middle East .• All of a sudden Obama has to empty Guantanamo Bay of captured Jihadists and let them loose in Jihad-friendly Islamic states. He demands to close the facility.• All of a sudden America will negotiate with terrorists and trade FIVE Taliban commanders for a deserter and Jihad sympathizer.• All of a sudden there is no money for American poor, disabled veterans, jobless Americans, hungry Americans, or displaced Americans but there is endless money for Obama's "Syrian refugee" resettlement Programs.• All of sudden there is an ammunition shortage in the USA.• All of a sudden, the most important thing for Obama to do after a mass shooting by two Jihadists, is disarm American citizens.• All of a sudden, the President of the United States cannot attend the Christian funerals of a Supreme Court Justice and a former First Lady because of previous (seemingly unimportant) commitments. **************************************************************************************************************All of a sudden, I’m sick to my stomach. I’m not sure the majority of Americans recognize the seriousness of the situation and how much “progress” has been made by Islam these last 7 years, a very brief time compared to a 75  year lifetime!🇺🇸 Yes, this IS Obama's legacy.

2 | Aaron C Smith | 1540036909349667_563933507132765 | I got to give it to her just for not laughing Everytime he goes and tries to put a sentence together. You can almost see smoke coming out his ears.

8 | Hilton Crawford | 1540036909349667_563935407132575 | Why cant this guy give an educated and intelligent response???
9 | Tania Watson | 1540036909349667_1540041759349182 | Hillary looks exhausted just having to stand beside this fool.
10 | Alina Baboolal | 1540036909349667_1182761878456662 | Who else is here just to read people's crazy comments?!
11 | Amber Whited | 1540036909349667_563962433799963 | Who protects the life of the baby?  That baby has a body and doesn't get a choice. Horrible! If you're a mother you would sacrifice your life for your baby.
12 | ClemmonsCarte Kimberly | 1540036909349667_1540042149349143 | Chris Wallace is running this debate wayyyyy better than all the rest!! He's actually got control

14 | Bruce Bungert | 1540036909349667_563935330465916 | While Hillary was trying to ban semi automatic weapons as Secretary of State, she approved air dropping of fully automatic weapons to terrorists in Syria.
15 | Kelley Wendland Fisher | 1540036909349667_563939030465546 | Women deserve the right to choose. I don't want Donald anywhere near my uterus, he's been near enough, some without consent.
16 | Rob Suddarth | 1540036909349667_1540039099349448 | It's the University of Nevada-Las Vegas, not the University of Las Vegas. Good job, journalists!
17 | Brenda Bellomy Smail | 1540036909349667_563935423799240 | How can he talk about ripping a baby out of a womb when he is raping babies

21 | Debbie Jane | 1540036909349667_1108505702564763 | I hate when people say they are pro-life. I really think most people are (99% plus) pro-life.  Better said and far more reflective of the true issue is the debate between pro-choice vs. anti-choice.
22 | Karla Nason | 1540036909349667_1294066490627695 | Killary speaks with tongue of serpent!  She is do evil And double talks everything --- accusing Russia of what she is guilty of

2 | Tammy Christian | 1539997286020296_1540001469353211 | I hope to hear the answers to questions about how each candidate is going to handle each issue. But, I have a feeling it's just going to be more mud slinging. Man, we have sunk low as a society and expect little out of our POTUS to have these two as our nominees.
3 | Janet Dunnivan | 1539997286020296_1540055922681099 | Trump is the best person.. Has American people in his heart..Hillary can't stop lying...she a career criminal.. Has been her entire life.Hillary has never accomplised anything but a trail of murder..lies..deciet to the USA people.
4 | Linda Coblentz | 1539997286020296_1540002289353129 | These debates always make me nervous. I'm afraid that my feeling that I'm about to throw up every time Trump speaks is not shared by millions of people. Perhaps I'll have a better grip this time.
5 | Reggie Love | 1539997286020296_1540004849352873 | Who is the best presidential candidate? Set aside your democratic and republican lenses, and make that decision.......it's not hard at all to figure that out!  Donald Trump have way more skeletons in his closet than Hillary. The Donald is too much of a dictator and wants to be cool with Vladimir Putin! Not good for his "Making America Great Again" slogan!
6 | Mikkey Martin | 1539997286020296_1540033736016651 | You Useful Idiots...you introduce Hitlery like Mother Teresa and Trump playing politics of distraction? What leeming wrote that that doesnt understand that is all Hillary's only hope is distraction from her scandals and corruption.
7 | Sandy Vohs Gaither | 1539997286020296_1540184076001617 | I will no longer be watching NBC due to the way they and their journalist have reported this election. I watched NBC for the last 45 years, news, weather, programs, the today show from the minute I woke till Hoda and Kathy L ended! No more! Sick of this one sided network!
8 | Rich McCormick | 1539997286020296_1540109082675783 | Just think #Trump and #MikePence want to undo a lot of things that ACTUALLY help middle to low income families...for example Abortion, equal rights, health care, and equal pay.I boggles my mind that people want to vote for this....WHY?
9 | Elizabeth Butler | 1539997286020296_1540053152681376 | And trump dont know what is to loose a brother to 🔫 violence like i did from make 10 and a ak 47 🔫 by a teenage 17 years old and 16 year old and my other brother kill him self on my birthday which is coming up 11-26 so do you think i fell on my birthday and thanksgiving day
10 | Dan Turpin | 1539997286020296_1540080579345300 | She is embarrassing him so bad, he is so outclassed that even his lies are turning on him.  He needs to run away while he has a chance.  I'm loving watching him turn red faced and lose his cool.
11 | Jamie Warner | 1539997286020296_1540048392681852 | Hillary won't answer how she actually plans to keep our boarders secure . She's delusional how she thinks "immigration reform " will suddenly stop the promblem .
12 | Sylvia Scheller | 1539997286020296_1540024196017605 | We've tried Republicans and Democrats, There is more than enough room for more parties and their ideas to flourish. Anyone else sick of divisiveness and petty argument simply for petty arguments sake? C'mon, WE THE PEOPLE ARE BETTER THAN THIS EVEN IF OUR CANDIDATES ARE NOT! #TheyBothSuck2016
13 | Peter Sotomayor | 1539997286020296_1540193306000694 | Finally. A moderator that asks tough questions of both candidates. Because Hillary wasn't protected by the moderator like the first 2 rounds, in which she lost decisively in the 2nd, her kool-aid drinking supports are having a meltdown.
14 | Vicente Izaguirre | 1539997286020296_1540261955993829 | Con elegancia, sabiduría, paciencia, serenidad, conocimientos,bases solidas,enfocada en los principios básicos familiares y exhortando a la unidad de todos los estadounidense la sra. Hillary Clinton demostró ser la persona idónea,indicada y calificada para ser la próxima Presidenta de los Estados Unidos de Norteamérica al enfrentarse a un Trump arrogante, irrespetuoso,presumido,irónico,mentiroso, amenazador,inestable,intolerable,divisionista,odioso,prepotente,instigador, rencoroso,repulsivo y pesimista en el tercer debate presidencial en las Vegas el día Miércoles 19 de Octubre del 2016.
15 | Millan Sanchez | 1539997286020296_1540016696018355 | Trump says Mexicans bringing drugs, yet he is coke freak himself... were does he think his dope come from? Malaria"s purse?
16 | Andrew Doerring | 1539997286020296_1540004516019573 | Donald Trump is going to win in a landslide and nbc and the lame stream media are going to wish they did things differently when they are on the outside looking in.
17 | The Riley-Christine Foundation | 1539997286020296_1540056802681011 | I can not believe Donald Trump is making statements on national news that Russia is expanding their nuclear capability and America is doing nothing. Why would a presidential candidate make such as serious acquisition our nuclear ambitions.... that would be "Top Secret" and should not be discussed..... Unbelievable!
18 | JD Ramos | 1539997286020296_1540210482665643 | Hillary is the voice of common sense. Trump has the audacity to belittle military progress abroad even when in the face of the secretary of state. He knows nothing except to be a putins puppet. he aligns himself with Russia because he is a traitor to his own country. A hypocrite to his own people. A hateful anti-women goon. Anti-religious, anti immigrant, anti planet. he is failed businessman, who has invested heavily on foreign countries instead of his own country. A number 1 fascit , anti-american hypocrite. I hope tonight was the last time we hear his filthy mouth. He is a national disgrace.
19 | Susan Shafer | 1539997286020296_1540034089349949 | After that debate introduction, it's hard to even imagine what circumstances could result in your abandoning your liberal propaganda. What shills.
20 | Johnny Wright | 1539997286020296_1540184086001616 | Now it's time for Trumpanzie's to say they won the debate .and democrats feel we won . So I will leave you with this Electoral votesHillary Clinton346.0Donald Trump191.5Popular voteHillary Clinton49.8%Donald Trump42.7%Not subject to change ether way a debate goes...
21 | Doris Bacon | 1539997286020296_1540247485995276 | Trump is right tho, lowering taxes on business will give us more businesses to open which will give us more jobs which will put more money back into the economy and more into Social Security and Medicare so in the end the entire Country will gain
22 | Bob Smothers | 1539997286020296_1540021859351172 | Oh joy! Now I can get settled in for my nightly dump.Kindle? CheckToilet paper? CheckTv is off? CheckWell seems like I am good to go.
23 | Spiring Naumee | 1539997286020296_1540131456006879 | Good day for her..✌✌✌✌✌✌..Her dedication for all American peoples will lead to Goal offer that will encourage she to do more. ..!! Hillary Clinton.... Fight..!!😃😃😃😃😃
24 | Vicki Plaster Kueppers | 1539997286020296_1540037076016317 | You have a filter on Hillary so she doesn't look so wrinkled. You can see the difference in the lighting by looking at the Blue background. They differ between the two. Please light them the same.
25 | Bonnie Wells Artist | 1539997286020296_1540026526017372 | The news is going to look like the fools they are. I have noticed that some of these puppets are now appear on many shows looks like a hectic schedule They believe people actually care about them and what they have to say brain-dead.

2 | Denis Poitras | 1539989056021119_1540006342686057 | Too funny the lady that said. I'm voting in Ohio and my vote means something lol a vote is a vote no matter where you are. People go vote to stop the Trump destruction of your country.
3 | Erica Feit | 1539989056021119_1540178439335514 | Trump supporters: You're disgustingly wrong in your efforts. If Clinton loses, Trump wins. That is a serious tragedy. While I do not believe Clinton is the answer to our country's problems, Trump points to our demise. Until our country can effectively elect an official from neither dominant party and only elect based on morals/beliefs/history of the candidate, we will not see the change we need. Protect us from Trump by voting for Clinton.
4 | Janet Dunnivan | 1539989056021119_1540059159347442 | Trump only hope...no more extension of Obama's. Destruction of our country.Hillary and Obama should be in prison for treason
5 | John Shelnut | 1539989056021119_1539989956021029 | This is not questioning the candidates on their political platforms which truly needs to be debated. I would like to know how they plan on carrying out their given platforms.
6 | Charles Marean | 1539989056021119_1539999752686716 | Dems call killing a pregnancy a woman's right to choose, although a pregnancy is a human life; the Republican platform includes right-to-life. Also, when you tax the rich they have to raise prices in the stores, so you're really taxing the poor. Bonds have to be paid back, but grants do not have to be paid back. The Republicans are closer to noticing that I think.
7 | Kieran Sutherland | 1539989056021119_1540301952656496 | Bribe!! The Clinton emails. "Lastly, on a much more practical note: to get you out of this I am going to have to bribe Channel 2 with a significant and exclusive interview when we are in Jerusalem in two weeks, and I guarantee you that will be far more painful than  tomorrow's relative short and peaceful format."

8 | Zabi Habash | 1539989056021119_1539991736020851 | The entire campaign, on both ends has been a complete joke and disgrace. The media has failed the people and the two major candidates are slated to ruin what little progress America has made the last 20 years. It's a joke, Trump, Clinton, the media coverage in the USA, like CNN, Fox and MSNBC are disgusting. A failure on every level, the rest of the world can have a good laugh and shake their heads at the joke unfolding in the states.
9 | Travis Murray | 1539989056021119_1539995066020518 | Just updating everyone. There are currently 443 people running for president. 73 democrats, 104 Republicans, and 266 unaffiliated. Take a look at other candidates if the pervert and liar aren't your cup of tea.
10 | Top Dollar Investment Group | 1539989056021119_1539990176021007 | Rudy Giuliani is wrong. Emails marked confidential is "not classified material" such as "Secret" or "Top Secret" because confidential email means just that: Intended for only certain people to see but it is not secret of top secret email. I'm tired of Republicans and all the Hillary haters trying to mislead the American public by insinuating that Hillary Clinton mishandled secret and top secret; aka: classified information. By saying she mishandled classified material is misleading to the general public. It's not a state of emergency or a national security issue.

11 | Steven Tucker | 1539989056021119_1539995816020443 | This is what the liberal Democratic party has become. Look, you may be a lifelong Democratic, but they are not who they once were and do you really want to be a part of what they have become? Democrats no longer care about people, that is evident by the lack of respect they continue to display for the American people. Watch this video, if you really care, to see exactly what devices they use to hurt the American people. You will not see the liberal mainstream media talk about it because they are a part of it. https://youtu.be/hDc8PVCvfKs
12 | Bonnie Upton | 1539989056021119_1540299819323376 | Hillary brags about caring for the lives of kids, but then praises abortion, which has killed over 60 plus million babies. Like that one comedian said, maybe if doctors started using guns to abort babies, maybe then liberals would care about abortions. Trump missed a chance when she was talking about "planned parenthood" to point out that margeat sanger, who clinton says she loves, bragged about pushing abortion on the black community, cause she said they were "growing like weeds, and needed to be exterminated"
13 | Rex Tilton | 1539989056021119_1539989419354416 | Corrupt career politicians have been in their jobs so long that they think they are above the law and do not respect the will of the people and they think it is funny,  WHAT THE HELL!!!!! These career politicians will raise our taxes and will pull us into large war. Praying for change. We need to try Donald Trump.
14 | Andy Mercer | 1539989056021119_1540004512686240 | Why hasn't NBC News and the Today show not reported on the video between the DNC and Scott Foval and Aaron Black.FOX news has.To damaging for HilLIARy and the DNC.That's why Trump says this election is rigged.Your reporting and your not reporting on HilLIARy or the DNC.
15 | Carla Brookman | 1539989056021119_1540049559348402 | Bob Creamer (felon) openly talked about how the campaign and Hillary Clinton knew all about the violence and intent to incite riots at the Trump campaign's and rig the election❗️On the video he clearly states these incidents are designed to look spontaneous and organic his words.The woman in a wheelchair  on oxygen who claimed to be punched in the face at a Trump event was given directions on how to bird-dog the media is they put it, she was never punched in the face.Bob Creamer has visited Obama in the White House on an average of once a week since Obama's been elected.The White House is not denying that he is visited the White House over 342 times.Phony polls being advanced by the bought and paid for liberal media so, when they steal the election at the ballot box so a Clinton win could seem plausible. This election is riggedYouTube#1 on trending ❗️Rigging The Election-Video 1Clinton Campaign and DNC Incite Violence at Trump Rallies And, Rigging The Election- Video 2TWO DEMOCRATIC operatives are out of a job as a result of the hidden camera videos❗️"The PUBLIC. CORRUPTION between, The Justice Department , the FBI, the State Department, [and] the intelligence communities is so in your face CORRUPT that it makes the 'House of Cards' look like a Saturday afternoon picnic."❗️VOTE TRUMPGet out the Vote America's Brexit❗️
16 | Douglas Flynt | 1539989056021119_1539994502687241 | REALLY? The Clinton Campaign HIRED the Mentally Disabled to get beaten up at Trump Rallies! They hired the mentally disabled, put them in controversial tee shirts, ProChoice, I'm With Her, eg, and followed them with hidden cameras hoping they would be assaulted by Trump Supporters. It didn't happen. Because Trump Supporters are civilized. If you vote for Hillary, this is the kind of sleaze you are supporting. What is wrong with you?
17 | Mary Harris | 1539989056021119_1540216302665061 | Says the biased so called news/talk show. How do these people look in the mirrors being such hypocrites?
18 | Joyce Landry Hannie | 1539989056021119_1540136359339722 | She talks out of both sides of her mouth! She is a hypocrite!
19 | Douglas Flynt | 1539989056021119_1539998349353523 | Hillary Clinton wanted the Mentally Disabled beaten up by Trump Supporters. Hillary Clinton used the most vulnerable among us as political bait. And you're going to vote for this garbage? ZEIG HEIL!
20 | Paul John Gavagan | 1539989056021119_1540028022683889 | HILLARY:“My accomplishments as Secretary of State? Well, I’m glad you asked! My proudest accomplishment in which I take the most pride, mostly because of the opposition it faced early on, you know, the remnants of prior situations and mind-sets that were too narrowly focused in a manner whereby they may have overlooked the bigger picture, and we didn’t do that, and I’m proud of that. Very proud. I would say that’s a major accomplishment.” Hillary Clinton 11 March 2014 Could someone please tell me what she just said? And she is running for President!???

1 | Josh Combs | 1539978506022174_1539990092687682 | Why not talk about the content of the hacks? Instead you distract people with who may be doing it or so on. I haven't heard anybody deny the content of the information. Corrupt government secrets exposed and one of the parties involved just so happen's to be the Democratic nominee. But it's out that you are bought and payed for, so why would anybody expect anything different.Journalism is dead
2 | Paul Albright | 1539978506022174_1540056789347679 | Now maybe our government can do something about Israeli interference in our elections. Which they do via their AIPAC lobby. And through the members of congress who hold duel US/Israeli citizenship.
3 | Kiela Hammel | 1539978506022174_1539992279354130 | Information on the .gov accounts are public information and FOIA eligible. They should be public and it's a shame someone had to hack information that belongs to the people those in power are hiding them from! We The People are in charge!! Not the elected officials! What's wrong with you people!
4 | Zabi Habash | 1539978506022174_1539982379355120 | When exposing the crimes of your leaders is a crime... you are ruled by criminals.We the people, have the power to prevent the government from persecuting Snowden. Remember, according to the constitution, we own and control our government, and have the authority to over throw it, not the other way around. I think this is something the government and the citizens of the United States has forgotten.
5 | William H Kien | 1539978506022174_1540295019323856 | Top intelligence Agency also told us Iraq was hiding weapons of mass destruction..I see our country once again beating a war drum..now it is for Russia..
6 | Luther A. Young | 1539978506022174_1540024016017623 | If it was really the Russians; however, with this administration's track record I seriously doubt the authenticity of the information they are putting out.
7 | Leif Derek Truitt | 1539978506022174_1540032079350150 | Nationalism unites people of different classes and ideologies. It can create harmony, link our past to our present and give a people a sense of identity. But nationalism is also a tool used by dictators, despots and power-hungry politicians alike. It can create violent and mighty forces as well as divide people from different geographies. It is used to exaggerate differences, foster generalizations and cause discriminatory thinking. These two halves of nationalism can perhaps best be viewed in the context of World War II. Churchill, Roosevelt and King used nationalism to unite their nations against brutal enemies for the preservation of democratic civilization. Hitler, Mussolini and Tojo exploited nationalism to fuel an expansionist voracity the likes of which the world had never seen before1.http://www.unitednorthamerica.org/nationalism.htm2.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec_Conference,_1943
8 | Tom Saffell | 1539978506022174_1540000292686662 | The people dont trust nbc news or any other news groups ! You have violated the peoples trust and covered up crooked hillarys crimes ! You just made us want to vote for trump even more ! Obama and his wife are racist and just as currupt as the clintons and the democratic party is crooked too ! Which one is killing witnesses ! Soros ? Or the above DEMONcrats !
9 | Mark Anthony Ramirez | 1539978506022174_1540038066016218 | I have a question. Why wouldn't the Liberals want to at least consider what Hillary MAY have done? These accusations against her would be VERY easy to prove, or disprove. All they have to do is analyze the computers of the sender, receiver, or the email host servers. Isn't finding out the truth important to them?
10 | Andrew Doerring | 1539978506022174_1540021129351245 | Just another distraction from what is in the emails. We the people don't care who released the emails. What we care about what is said in the emails. You can try all you want to change the subject but you can't change what the democratic party and crooked killery are saying in those emails.
11 | Charles Marean | 1539978506022174_1539985376021487 | The issue should be how to fund higher welfare and outlaw abortion and liquor. Instead, they've tricked the Conservatives into supporting Big Brother.
12 | Faustino Aprile | 1539978506022174_1540306022656089 | Democrats and Hillary are extremely careless when handling data, which is why their emails and classified documents are all over the internet.
13 | Morgan Orlins | 1539978506022174_1539978969355461 | If Hillary Clinton is elected, it will be the first time in American history that a know CRIMINAL was elected by the American people to be president.
14 | Morgan Orlins | 1539978506022174_1539980996021925 | It's a sad SHAME that hacked e-mails are doing the job that investigative American journalists USED TO DO!!!
15 | Rich Dahl | 1539978506022174_1540000442686647 | Which is worse? That the emails may have been hacked by the Russians, or the fact that they exist in the first place? Hillary is corrupt. Who cares how the proof got out?
16 | Vinnie Bredice | 1539978506022174_1540293812657310 | Little do they know it's probably coming from China or North Korea.
17 | Jo Anna DaPozzo | 1539978506022174_1540242529329105 | Russia was never involved, stupid lie, nobody believes it.... #JillCanWin #JillStein #SteinBaraka
18 | James Davidson | 1539978506022174_1540097799343578 | If it was Russia...then they have done more for the American people's rights to knowledge than our own government.
19 | Sid Ralph | 1539978506022174_1540134576006567 | Russians?? Right! Just as how they wanted everyone to believe that the North Koreans were responsible for the sony hack.
20 | Janet Dunnivan | 1539978506022174_1540060879347270 | Trying to tell american people that our country the real truth about what Hillary and Obama destruction of works.
21 | Kiela Hammel | 1539978506022174_1539990882687603 | Yet the leaks are happening because, like the DNC intern murdered in Washington, the leaks are coming from inside the party!!
22 | Brian Alexander | 1539978506022174_1539983832688308 | Though shalt not steal.   Unless it's done to hurt thy enemy.   Fundamentalist Christian reasoning.

24 | Pedro Still Sanders | 1539978506022174_1540033976016627 | The new WMDS (blame Russia) to cover up and distract from the Dirty Dems of the DNC'S corruption
25 | Thomas Webster | 1539978506022174_1540016169351741 | It hasnt been proven who hacked the dnc, if our powers to be in the cyber world are so smart why cant they prove who actually hacked ?

2 | Michelle Biggs Gray | 1539962469357111_1539976472689044 | Only people that pay taxes should be allowed to debate!! He should do his debate via satellite from prison!!! Why  does he get a pass!!!!
3 | Becky Wray-Jarrett | 1539962469357111_1539975299355828 | I'm not sure why he won't release his taxes.....it doesn't matter what he does his worshipers will forgive him anything.
4 | Gary Andzel | 1539962469357111_1539975242689167 | Donald lost all my respect when you started dealing with the Russians and is willing to sell his country on for money he can't be trusted he's loyal to no one but himself and money
5 | Donald Rettmann | 1539962469357111_1539971896022835 | Stop about Benghazi. Ambassador Stevens' family has said it was not Hillary's fault, it was the fault of republicans who cut funding for embassy security. The family supports her.
6 | David D. Linnemeyer | 1539962469357111_1539979046022120 | Forgetting for a moment the classification of the emails I want to ask, who paid for that server? If it belongs to the government what she did was theft of intellectual property.
7 | John Szuchan | 1539962469357111_1539973869355971 | I am an register republican but this year I am VOTING for Hillary Clinton
8 | Brian Baros | 1539962469357111_1539970462689645 | OMG these are just a couple of Over sensitive Reporters who have no idea what they are talking about and failed at screwing each other prior to talking with each other...
9 | David Wagher | 1539962469357111_1539965329356825 | Our election was rigged from the beginning. The votes of the people are not equal in all states. Some states make Electoral Collage vote all for the largest winner . This voids all of the lesser votes.
10 | Paula R. Page | 1539962469357111_1821193791498924 | Anyone who thinks the election is rigged obviously doesn't have very much faith in their candidate. And if you think Republicans haven't tried to illegally steer the vote...just look it up.
11 | Anna Graxcirena | 1539962469357111_1539971669356191 | Are the veteran going to be protected when they get injured? And the ones that are retired are they getting back the raise every year?
12 | Gary Andzel | 1539962469357111_1539970386022986 | It's very difficult to keep Donald focused on reality and on the subjects that is going to be asked what is he going to do when he loses the election
13 | John Shelnut | 1539962469357111_1539966532690038 | This is not questioning the candidates on their political platforms which truly needs to be debated. I would like to know how they plan on carrying out their given platforms.
14 | Sherri Hammer | 1539962469357111_1539968836023141 | Mike and Donald can disagree on things and still working very well together it's called being a grown up. They're not Democrats
15 | Willie Shane Parker | 1539962469357111_1539965152690176 | I would like to know why is it that the candidates are talking more about who did what and how they did it and not talking about how they are going to help the American people, isn't that what they are being elected for?
16 | Chris O'Brien | 1539962469357111_1761344774138564 | Hillary wants open borders, wants to ban guns, lied under oath, deleted emails intentionally, pay for play, provided Uranium to Russia, armed ISIS but nothing to see here folks
17 | BigTee Butler | 1539962469357111_1539968032689888 | Hope that I don't choke on my popcorn as Bubba Gump stalks Hillary on stage.
18 | BigTee Butler | 1539962469357111_1539970002689691 | He claims only "he" can make America great again..well I want to hear his plans of executing that! What are your plans? Please share🙏
19 | Brian Briscoe | 1539962469357111_1761356990804009 | Once ISIS starts beheading you rich families as well as the rest of us...you will be sorry you are so dishonest to the American People.
20 | Michelle Provencal-Bonin | 1539962469357111_1539971179356240 | America is tired of the mudslinging. Let's hear about policies and plans for our country.
21 | Herman Ter Haar | 1539962469357111_1019943728129189 | Well......He likes his daughter and all pretty women under 35 which is the age to exit as he stated. Guess Meliana is in overtime!
22 | Jn Searle | 1539962469357111_1539979369355421 | Omgosh what a circus you are making of this. Patricia Smith is a guest. Yes, you probably don't want to remember her. Her son was MURDERED Because of Hillary. NOT A RUMOR.
23 | James Stevens | 1539962469357111_1539976612689030 | Your right it's rigged, just ask Al Gore. He got cheated and acted like a good American and asked the people to support Bush.
24 | Tom Rokosz | 1539962469357111_1539965442690147 | Bunch of cry babies!!! We demand an extension to vote in new candidates! This is our country!
25 | Leslie Snead Stroup | 1539962469357111_1019938288129733 | Nothing illegal has been proven against HRC -- emails are not equivalent to a lying, amoral, narcissistic, misogynist, ill-informed hate mongerer!

Immigration has loomed large in the campaign but hasn't been truly dissected in the presidential debates.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Billy D'Antoni | 1539959326024092_1539970529356305 | TJ Marsden Those are the real issues. The emails broke federal law and the election is rigged it's already been proven. Please try to keep up.
2 | TJ Marsden | 1539959326024092_1539963946023630 | They'll be talking more about emails and grabbing woman's genitalia is instead of dealing with the real issues. Trump calling the election rigged and blaming the media is going to get more attention than real issues.
3 | Douglas Perry | 1539959326024092_1539972979356060 | From 1998-2013 there were 7000 undocumented immigrant deaths in California. In. 2015 there were 260 deaths just at the border. Trump's wall would save lives.
4 | Chisita Chisita | 1539959326024092_1539967402689951 | Maybe tonight's moderator will ask the following: . Moderator: Good evening ladies and gentlemen. Let's start the first question with you Mrs. Clinton. “When you left the White House after your husbands last term as president, why did you steal $200,000.00 worth of furniture, china, and artwork that you were forced to return? Mrs. Clinton, when you were Secretary of State, why did you solicit contributions from foreign governments for the Clinton foundation after you promised President Obama you would not? Mrs. Clinton, why do you and your husband claim to contribute millions of dollars to charity for a tax write off when it goes to your family foundation that gives out less than 15% of the funds you collect and you use the balance to support yourself tax free? Mrs. Clinton, why are you unable to account for 6 billion dollars of State department funds that seem to have disappeared while you were Secretary of State? Mrs. Clinton, why did you say you were broke when you left the White House, but you purchased a 2 million home, built an addition for the secret service, and charge the tax payers of the United States rent in an amount of the entire mortgage? And Mrs. Clinton, how is it that your daughter, Chelsea, can afford to buy a $10.5 million apartment in New York City shortly after you left the White House? And speaking of Chelsea, how is it that her first paying job, in her late 20's, was for more than the President of the United States’ salary? Was there a quid pro quo of any sort involved?? Mrs. Clinton why did you lie to the American people about the terrorist attack in Benghazi but managed to tell the truth to your daughter the same night it happened? Mrs. Clinton why did you lose your law license? Why did your husband lose his? Mrs. Clinton, what Really happened to Ron Brown when he was about to testify against you and your husband? Take your time to respond Mrs. Clinton.
5 | TJ Marsden | 1539959326024092_1540025202684171 | Billy D'Antoni. It's only right in your own mind. Your imagination needs it to be seen as rigged so then you can have an excuse of why your guy is losing. Pressuring me what law had anything to do with the emails that didn't come out at the time when she was using her own server. There is none. You and other people who are brainwashed into believing in it.
6 | Leif Derek Truitt | 1539959326024092_1539962336023791 | Nationalism unites people of different classes and ideologies. It can create harmony, link our past to our present and give a people a sense of identity. But nationalism is also a tool used by dictators, despots and power-hungry politicians alike. It can create violent and mighty forces as well as divide people from different geographies. It is used to exaggerate differences, foster generalizations and cause discriminatory thinking. These two halves of nationalism can perhaps best be viewed in the context of World War II. Churchill, Roosevelt and King used nationalism to unite their nations against brutal enemies for the preservation of democratic civilization. Hitler, Mussolini and Tojo exploited nationalism to fuel an expansionist voracity the likes of which the world had never seen before1.http://www.unitednorthamerica.org/nationalism.htm2.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec_Conference,_1943
7 | Bhaskar Reddi | 1539959326024092_1539990669354291 | Trump believes in strict enforcement of immigration laws where as Hillary does not offer any real solutions.In all her so called her service to the nation, she never touched the ongoing issue of illegal immigration which had resulted in the death of innocent citizens
8 | Donnie Conley | 1539959326024092_1540021742684517 | It's Worth taking the time to read because this story is starting to leak out from FBI agents and others "who are in the know" inside the Washington beltway! The agents at the FBI are livid that Comey did what he did. They are claiming there was more than sufficient evidence to bring several indictments against Hillary Clinton. It wasn't a slam dunk case, but it had more than a good probability of a conviction for Hillary Clinton. Lynch and Obama made it clear to Comey that if he pressed for an indictment, he would be taking the Democrat nominee for president out of the election. If he failed to get a conviction he would be facing charges of tampering with and changing the outcome of a federal election, to which he would be facing the rest of his life in prison, and Obama and Lynch, as well as others, would see to it that he did. Now you know why he presented his case the way he did and why it was so obvious he was reluctant to not press for an indictment. Hillary's statement to the FBI was intentionally given without a court reporter present or without any recording of her testimony to prevent her from having any further exposure to legal charges like perjury. If she lied to Congress, they have no written FBI deposition to confront Hillary with. This was set up to let her walk without fear of being charged with giving False Testimony or being charged with Obstruction of Justice. This is what those in the "legalese world" call a "Straw Man" legal charge. (It is a charge designed to make someone appear innocent of the charges!) EXAMPLE: Bill beats up Shirley at their home. Bill is arrested for "Felony Spousal Abuse" . Bill's lawyer gets the charges dismissed because Bill is not married to Shirley! (They are only "live in boyfriend and girlfriend".) Bill walks out of court totally exonerated of the charges thanks to a technicality! The twist in the case is the arresting officer knew all along Bill was not married to Shirley because the officer and Bill are old fraternity brothers. The officer intentionally charged Bill with something he knew would not stick. Bill would easily have been convicted of Assault and Battery, but he was not charged with that! This is what is known as the "STRAW MAN" charge. It is how you make a guilty person appear innocent. This is exactly what was done with the Hillary Clinton case! If she had been charged with "Destruction of Government Documents", she would have easily been convicted, because she admitted to doing this! Instead, she was charged with "Mishandling Classified Documents" which has wiggle room for reasonable doubt regarding Criminal Intent! I think citizens are finally fed up with the Clintons and the cesspool of corruption that is our current government. Real Americans are ready to take our country back. All of these years of corruption have taken a toll on American lives. Citizens opinions of a lying White House, a corrupt Congress, the "pay to play" politicians, the legalese lawyers and lobbyists, big overspending "welfare mentality" government, the "looking for a loop hole" justice system, the lying media, and our censored educational system with an agenda to dumb down the next generation, is at the lowest point ever. Hillary is on the wrong side of every issue. The British Exit from the EU (Brexit) is just a small sign that real citizens of civilized nations are ready to take their country back. They are sick of the results of open borders and globalization led by power hungry elites. Hillary Clinton has no character or integrity. She is an arrogant, condescending political elite who is only interested in lining the Clinton pockets with donations to the Clinton Foundation (wink, wink) from PACS, lobbyists, and foriegn nations that buy access and favors. The Clinton Foundation is nothing more than an operation used to launder money for the Clintons and other politicians involved in illegal activities. The Clintons are able to use the information of those participating to obtain cover for their activities, or blackmail those who are laundering money through them. Just count the number of politicians who arrive in Washington with nothing, but leave as millionaires and billionaires. Did their votes serve in the best interest of their constituents or did they only benefit themselves? If the representatives of your state fall in this category, then I suggest an investigation be launched.
9 | Paul Albright | 1539959326024092_1540057769347581 | It should be a no brainer. You sneak into this country, even if you drop a baby here, and you should be rounded up and thrown out.
10 | Thomas Evans | 1539959326024092_1540001842686507 | I just signed up to help round them up after the election! It's going to be great listening them to cry racist as we deport them.
11 | Jessica Weiner Coccia | 1539959326024092_1539963592690332 | Living in S.Fla..I'M ALL FOR IMMIGRATION REFORM..WE DESPERATELY NEED IT..But realistically no "wall" will ever get built.

12 | Darlene Shelley | 1539959326024092_1539976882689003 | Top Hillary Campaign Agitator Exposes How He Gets Women BEAT UP At Trump RalliesOCTOBER 19, 2016 POLITICSJames O'Keefe of Project Veritas has been making waves across social media and getting Hillary Clinton campaign operatives fired as he releases undercover footage of campaigners bragging about their highly corrupt and illegal tactics to help Hillary win.Now in his latest video, just released, top campaign agitator Aaron Black — who has already admitted to using paid protesters to cause violence — explains how he uses women as punching bags at Trump rallies to get beat up by men posing as Trump supporters in order to fabricate a sexist narrative.
13 | Hernan Senoren | 1539959326024092_1540239472662744 | Remix: I'm reaching out to my big donors who owns the big media to keep me afloat by shielding me through our bias anchorman. I'm reaching out to all my field campaign paid armies to ripped registration ballots and incite violence at Trump rallies. I'm reaching out to my liberals and illegals immigrant supporters to vote for me and turn this whole country upside down morally bankrupt and financially drain.
14 | Jeanne Clevenger | 1539959326024092_1539970799356278 | No amnesty. It must to be legal. Can the regulations be rewritten to allow a faster process...yes. Trump is aware of how cumbersome federal regulations are and has promised an overhaul in many areas. Understand that Trump emphasized "criminal immigrants" and he's right, we don't need them in America.
15 | Michael Fert | 1539959326024092_1539977316022293 | VOTING for HilLiary is like hiring Casey Anthony to babysit for you or hiring Bernie Madoff to invest for you! HILLIARY has no soul, no character, no honor, no shame, no dignity, no morals and NO INTEGRITY!You have to be brain dead NOT to realize what a corrupt, vile, evil, shameless, disgusting woman HilLiary is!
16 | Mark Smith | 1539959326024092_1539962866023738 | Send them home..give them no federal BENEFITS . MAKE THEM COME BACK THE LEGAL WAY

20 | Terry Ridley | 1539959326024092_1539968856023139 | Our children deserve more than to have these illegals dump onto them to support in the future.

"My father will always do the right thing. That's the type of person he is," Ivanka Trump said at Fortune's Most Powerful Women Summit.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Louis Cruz Jr. | 1539943106025714_1539944772692214 | Grabbing pussy's is the right thing?. Not paying people that work for you is the right thing? Trying to have an affair with a married woman while you're married is the right thing? Trump's a fraud!
2 | Venia Hill | 1539943106025714_1539946759358682 | I can't wait til this election is over so I never have to see don the con again or his demented family and hopefully his deranged supporters will crawl back into their caves. #nevercrookedtrump
3 | Jenny Ling Ling | 1539943106025714_1539948852691806 | I hope he loses as he deserves to lose after all the callous and vile things he said about females which he's trying to lie his way out of now claiming he never said them, what a lying hypocrite he is and way worse than that IMO
4 | Jen Miller | 1539943106025714_1539950582691633 | Ivanka it is great that you love your father but your love is blind if you cannot see the real truth. Loving someone is calling them out on their issues not enabling them to continue without owning 100% to their wrong doing.
5 | Thomas Mannion | 1539943106025714_1539948419358516 | Her father couldn't do the right thing by his first two wives or any of the thousands of people that he screwed over when he bankrupted his hotels.   Why would she expect any sensible person to believe he's going to do the right thing now?
6 | Alex Stanley | 1539943106025714_1539945712692120 | There is really only one way this is going to go. The question is, will she win a large enough majority to have an irrefutable mandate, and a Congress willing to work FOR the American people and not against the President.
7 | Sean John | 1539943106025714_1539952679358090 | Wow, central park 5, even after being exonerated he still called for their execution, stating "I don't like these people " his black employees at his casinos removed from sight when him and his wife came, his statement "I don't like blacks counting my money" "i want to go back to the 50s and 60s those were the good ol days" for whites? Cuz it certainly was not for blacks in this country! nah those are just rumors right, wrong I worked for brinks and me and my partner went to one of his establishment, brinks supplies each company with a updated book with the employees who will pick up their money, the manager at this location canceled the money drop even after he saw the book, my company Id, and spoke to the operations mgr at brinks who verified me, but he never questioned my partner who was Hispanic but actually look white. So he does the right thing by who's book?
8 | Beth Kallimani | 1539943106025714_1539976222689069 | Oh, honey. I understand your desire to defend the Donald. He's you're dad. But you need to hear this. You know, telling it like it is... the guy's a jerk and you're being played.
9 | Karen Dukes | 1539943106025714_1539973706022654 | If he'll except the outcome either way, why won't he say that instead of getting his supporters all riled up?! I love my dad too but when he's wrong he's wrong
10 | Melissa Johnson | 1539943106025714_1539957746024250 | Yeah. Your daddy will accept the outcome by stomping his feet, throwing a major tantrum and screaming at the top of his lungs.  Let's just SEE how he reacts!  Lol!
11 | Carol DK | 1539943106025714_1539958912690800 | Poor girl, she doesn't really know! It is like families of a serial killer do not always know, who their father/husband really is. Psychopaths know how to mimic "normal".
12 | Paul Streiber | 1539943106025714_1539945439358814 | Disgraced and fired Democratic Operative Robert Creamer, who orchestrated hiring mentally ill people to disrupt Trump rallies, visited the White House...342 times.
13 | Art Milo | 1539943106025714_1539968629356495 | Nothing your father ever does is right. Insulting women, labeling innocent people as criminal, instilling hate in the politics of the nation, using foreign workers and not paying taxes and then pretending to be a socialist. You and your family make me barf. Hypocrites!
14 | Valerie Wood | 1539943106025714_1539943432692348 | Why does no one believe this? Because he lies about everything.
15 | Gail Donovan | 1539943106025714_1539991476020877 | If he was willing to do the right thing, he wouldn't incite and promote violence and intolerance. Poor poor Ivanka, she must go home at night and cry herself to sleep having to put a normal spin on his craziness.
16 | John Shelnut | 1539943106025714_1539949756025049 | This is not questioning the candidates on their political platforms which truly needs to be debated. I would like to know how they plan on carrying out their given platforms.
17 | Bridgette Hayes | 1539943106025714_1540031612683530 | Not when it comes to grabbing pussy honey. NO HE WON'T. Or Vladmir Putin, or ripping people off with his university, or when it comes to his charities, or the workers in his hotels and casinos. SO what the hell are YOU talking about?
18 | Brandon Dollar | 1539943106025714_1539975419355816 | He's always done the right thing, if you discount his billion dollar loss, his 5,500+ lawsuits, his dozen sexual assault accusers, his draft deferments, his reputation for scamming contractors and small businesses...
19 | Melissa Aitken | 1539943106025714_1540275652659126 | He's gonna have to when it's the majority; he's all talk and no walk and it's whoever sounds right or similar that guides him. This time he'll have no happiness of his kind but he's always had to accept that. Donald Trump is not that politically influential.
20 | Thomas Mannion | 1539943106025714_1539998016020223 | Here's some more questions for Trump:If Bill and Hillary Clinton are such terrible people why are you on record in several different interviews from the 1990s up until 2008 saying that they're wonderful, nice people?Why did you call Paula Jones "a loser" back in the late 90's and then invite her to the last debate?If the Clintons are such terrible people, why did you invite them to your wedding?
21 | Glen Park | 1539943106025714_1540027326017292 | He hasn't done the right thing in a crap ton of horrendous things done already. He's already said in the past that he would accept the outcome of the election, then almost immediately tossed that out the window like everything else that's come out of his mouth.
22 | Don Golen | 1539943106025714_1539961199357238 | But her father said the election is rigged.  Is this one of those times when we aren't supposed to take him seriously again?  I'm so confused.  I never know when locker room Trump is talking or President Trump is talking.

24 | Shawn Wholaver | 1539943106025714_1539989806021044 | Yes he will accept the outcome or else it would be known as a coup and you know what happens to people and their family who attempt a failed coup .the people give them Justice and take all their wealth
25 | Henry Rios | 1539943106025714_1539997416020283 | Perhaps Ivanka Trump did not know that her father is sex offender; or perhaps she finds it difficult to accept it.The signs are out there and they've been out there for a very long time; he is a sexual predator. His fame and fortune have shielded him from being held accountable. If anyone ever tries to come forward, he has the money, lawyers, and influence to make it all go away.I appreciate the women for their courage and for coming forward when a man with a history of assaulting women is running for the presidency of the USA. Someone like that cannot be president! NOT GOING TO HAPPEN!!!!

"What is clear in this one instance, we failed. I want to know why it happened," NYPD Chief James O'Neill said.

2 | Leif Derek Truitt | 1539924839360874_1539938222692869 | The cops that shot her need to be hunted by the people of New York and put to death that's the only way to stop this madness.Should we obey governments that are bad?Romans 13:1 says, "Let every person be in subjection to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those which exist are established by God." If this is so, what about the bad governments like the Nazis or the communist regimes where they killed millions? If God is the one who sets up governments, are we supposed to obey those bad governments?The answer is no.We are to obey governments unless they violate Scripture. Acts 5:29 says, "We must obey God rather than men." Whenever a government violates Biblical teaching, Christians are obligated to disobey that government. For example, if a government were to declare that we should kill all Asians or immigrants or people with Down's syndrome, we should disobey. Governments are run by people and often become corrupt. Furthermore, the Bible never tells us to obey governments in contradiction to the revealed Word of God.In the Old Testament, God sent the Israelites to destroy different nations. Technically speaking, we could say that God set up those various governmental systems that He told the Israelites to destroy. But when systems become ungodly and anti-Christian, they are no longer properly representing God and should not be obeyed.Are we seeing a conflict or a contradiction? Not at all. Let's take, for example, Exodus 20, where we see two commandments: obey your parents and do not murder.  We can see that our parents are the authorities above us even as governments are and we should obey them. But, what should we do if our parents tell us to murder someone? Should we obey? Of course not. Obedience to our parents is only proper when it's consistent with the rest of the Scriptures. Likewise, submission to the governmental systems is only proper when it is consistent with Scripture.Finally, let's look at Rom. 13:6-7, "For because of this you also pay taxes, for rulers are servants of God, devoting themselves to this very thing. 7 Render to all what is due them: tax to whom tax is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honor to whom honor." Notice that Paul says that the rulers are servants of God. This is the context of the submission that is mentioned at the beginning of the chapter. If these rulers are no longer servants of God and if they contradict Scripture, they are not to be obeyed.1.https://carm.org/questions/skeptics-ask/should-we-obey-governments-are-badJohn 19:23When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his garments and divided them into four parts, one part for each soldier; also his tunic. But the tunic was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom

Would there be a way to manufacture a hybrid gun/taser so the policeman could have that option in his/her hands?? I'm sure it's impractical as it hasn't been invented.  Any thoughts Robert J Apgar ?

5 | Leif Derek Truitt | 1539924839360874_1539937862692905 | Nationalism unites people of different classes and ideologies. It can create harmony, link our past to our present and give a people a sense of identity. But nationalism is also a tool used by dictators, despots and power-hungry politicians alike. It can create violent and mighty forces as well as divide people from different geographies. It is used to exaggerate differences, foster generalizations and cause discriminatory thinking. These two halves of nationalism can perhaps best be viewed in the context of World War II. Churchill, Roosevelt and King used nationalism to unite their nations against brutal enemies for the preservation of democratic civilization. Hitler, Mussolini and Tojo exploited nationalism to fuel an expansionist voracity the likes of which the world had never seen before1.http://www.unitednorthamerica.org/nationalism.htm
