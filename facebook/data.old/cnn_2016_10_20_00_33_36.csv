1 | Abdier De Jesus | 10155485796866509_10155485797071509 | NO she Didn't...Its amazing how almost all media is controlled by clinton..they are trying hard to manipulate and control the the voters mind with their fake propaganda..Cnn=clinton news network,abc,nbc,cbs,yahoo news ext..they do think they can control the mass population as Laboratory rats..
2 | Carlo Garza | 10155485796866509_10155485797196509 | Hillary team paid people to start RIOTS at TRUMP RALLY'S in Chicago and it's on VIDEO and nobody seems to bring that up WTF is wrong with y'all 😠
3 | Bryan O. McDowell | 10155485796866509_10155485806176509 | Tonight a major party candidate for President of the United States said they support allowing full-term abortions, yet nobody in the media is talking about it. The complete disregard for life in this country is incredibly sad.
4 | Luis Argueta | 10155485796866509_10155485808086509 | Trump won't commit to accepting election results because he is the Biggest Loser!!! In his eyes, everything is Rigged!! So ridiculous!!!! SMH!! #neverTrump #IAmwithHer #Hillary2016
5 | Inge Mueller Morse | 10155485796866509_10155485809906509 | Did anyone notice after the debate Melania came up to him but there were no hugs or kisses exchanged. He shook the boys hands and did air kisses, and kissed Tiffany. I didn't see Ivanka kiss him either. As he was leaving the stage, he took Melania's hand they walked maybe 2 steps and the hand holding was over. Looks like trouble in Trumpland. Look out world.. Mrs Trump 4 is not far away.
6 | Daniel Glover | 10155485796866509_10155485810556509 | Yeah because you can know this in about an hour after the debate ended correct? The same news organization that said having the WikiLeaks is illegal but press is allowed to have them. In other words you want to spread propaganda! Which is exactly what you are doing right here
7 | Kathy Maichl-Jones | 10155485796866509_10155485813361509 | Such lies ... Trump totally called her out and she totally failed ... Your Hillary supporters live in a delusional world.  She's not even qualified to run.  She should be in prison for lying under oath to the FBI
8 | Stephen Saunders | 10155485796866509_10155485815241509 | There are millions of people who intend to vote for Trump who aren't voicing the fact for fear of needless confrontation.  On election day, however, their voices will ring the loudest.
9 | Javier Payan | 10155485796866509_10155485810516509 | Lmao! Impossible that KKKilary could  have stood a chance tonight. Trump won. CNN is so biased that Stevie wonder can see it. 😂
10 | Karlen Mkrtchyan | 10155485796866509_10155485811381509 | Isn't this criminal?John Podesta: "I think Teddy’s idea scratches the itch, is pretty safe and uncomplicated.On the picture ID, the one thing I have thought of in that space is that if you show up on Election Day with a drivers license with a picture, attest that you are a citizen, you have a right to vote in Federal elections."
11 | Johnny Connelly | 10155485796866509_10155485810696509 | Regarding the debates tonight... I think Hillary and Trump both handled themselves well. Trump could have handled himself a lot better; however, considering Trump has spent the last few years as a TV star and Clinton has spent the last few years as a professional liar, I give the win to Trump since he has less experience lying to the public.Also, at the very beginning of the debate regarding the Supreme Court Justices... Did anyone notice how Hillary's response did not include the "Constitution of the United States" at all?Trump is a nationalist who loves the United States of America and loves the Constitution of the United States as it was originally meant to be interpreted.
12 | Alexis Gonzalez | 10155485796866509_10155485810791509 | Hillary Clinton just said tonight, that if a day before my daughter's birth they found something wrong with her, I had the "right" to rip her out in pieces. She was born in that time frame that Clinton would still allow abortions. THAT IS truly deplorable!
13 | Sam Parthemer | 10155485796866509_10155485813081509 | If she hadn't shown up, CNN would still have posted that she won.  They are biased against her.. and NO, she did NOT win the debate.
14 | Nikki Enoch | 10155485796866509_10155485807856509 | Pumpkin: Orange... Hollow... Thrown out around the 1st week of NovemberTrump: Orange... Hollow.... Thrown out around the 1st week of NovemberSo THAT'S why every time I see a pumpkin I think of Trump.Mystery solved!!!! 🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃
15 | Yadiel Rios | 10155485796866509_10155485810511509 | Hillary represents everything that is corrupt with our government!How many times in the past 20 years have you or someone you know said "I'm sick and tired of the government always ripping us off"Or my favourite "what are we going to do about it it's the government there's nothing we can do"Well just this one time, this one election we have an opportunity to do something about that!Trump represents our only chance to cut the puppet strings of the establishment!Not to mention Hillary just told the world our nuclear response time live on the air! Given her history with classified information she clearly cannot be trusted!
16 | Cheryl Brady | 10155485796866509_10155485807801509 | Absolutely. There was no comparison between Hillary and Donald. She was prepared, focused, knowledgeable, substantive, empathetic, forward-thinking, poised and presidential.......Donald was......well....NONE of these things
17 | Denise Munoz | 10155485796866509_10155485799846509 | Denise Munoz Her campaign was paying people to beat up trump supporters...do you really want a president that has American citizens beat up going to a presidential rallys!! the liberal media made it seem like it was the republicans that were causing all the fights!! someone could have been killed!! that is pure evil its worst than the mafia!! that video is proof of what was really going on. https://youtu.be/5IuJGHuIkzY
18 | Dianne Noche Atienza | 10155485796866509_10155485798591509 | Being a Secretarty of State, Hillary already knows what will work and not work in governing the country. While Trump don't have that experience. His experience is managing his business. He can use that in managing Fox Network, not governing the USA.#PresidentHillaryClinton
19 | Shandy Elliott | 10155485796866509_10155485808266509 | So, did you take this poll in the CNN viewer section? How was this poll taken?
20 | Kenny Jourdain | 10155485796866509_10155485815366509 | 🚨🚨🚨Rigged 🚨🚨🚨. CNN you were never news. FOXNews has four more credibility than you. You guys are hacks and Hillary puppets🚨🚨🚨
21 | Ashley Dudley | 10155485796866509_10155485812606509 | All the cnn hate... why even on here if they upset you sooo much? Go back to foxnews.
22 | Eddie Casey | 10155485796866509_10155485813636509 | Cnn talk about clintons stance on abortion up to the 8th or 9th month of pregnancy that right there is wrong !!
23 | Brooke LaShea Peña | 10155485796866509_10155485812096509 | CNN you suck. She didn't win. She choked up and avoided questions. Trump shut her down and u know it! We all seen it!
24 | Josh Miller | 10155485796866509_10155485810016509 | Hey CNN why don't you report honest politics you hacks. https://www.facebook.com/DisdainForPlebs/videos/1189115454502233/I would strongly recommend everyone click on that and watch the video of how CNN cut a person on air who was going to prove how bad Hillary is
25 | Ramses Perez | 10155485796866509_10155485808811509 | Yeah right CNN who did you poll ??? Lying liberal media

1 | Sharukh Kohli | 10155485731071509_10155485742931509 | And China has the straddling bus. India has the world's first fully solar powered airport. Israel is making pure water out of the ocean. And where is USA??
2 | Eileen Tharp | 10155485731071509_10155485781511509 | Well all you libs who called me a liar when I said Hillary believes in abortion up to the day of birth, were you listening to this cold woman? If you can pull a baby out far enough to put a scissors or scalpel in its brain,which is what they do in partial birth abortions, then why can't you just take the baby  out and help it to live instead. This business of it's for the Mother's life is a joke. If you kill a baby the day before its birth date, how is that not the same as the day after? They are both viable and it's murder either way. She has no heart. And Black Lives Matter what about all the black babies aborted? Don't their little lives matter. You're giving liberals like Margaret Sanger (founder of Planned Parenthood) what she wanted, to control the growth of the black population. Look it up, she was a bigot, and now look at the millions of black babies killed in the name of "freedom.
3 | Mary Signore | 10155485731071509_10155485770806509 | CNN finally getting what they deserve. The screams of the people outside surrounding the Anderson copper show are TOTALLY are drowning out the commentators. America is fed up!!! All you hear is CNN SUCKS & LOCK HER UP.
4 | CB Mann | 10155485731071509_10155485781416509 | CNN should recuse themselves from this election. They are the 7th largest financial contributor to Clinton. 7th largest! They should make a public statement admitting they are pro Hillary, how much money they have donated (Millions) and that they can't be impartial because they are trying to get her elected. And it should be illegal to misrepresent themselves as a news organization when they are bought and paid for by the Democrats.
5 | Louie Kneitz | 10155485731071509_10155485815271509 | CNN cracks me up. All their fact checking says Trump's statements are false. Based in US Govt statistics. And who rims the Govt? OBummer? And not one fact check for Hilary. Whats_with that CNN?
6 | Fred LC | 10155485731071509_10155485776456509 | Same place the CNN shills are burying any semblance of journalistic integrity, and the wikileaks document dumps. You people are a disgrace and a stain on this nation.
7 | Justin Oertel | 10155485731071509_10155485746466509 | YOUR DEBATE PANEL IS SUPER BIASED!!!THE MEDIA HATES TRUMP. 👎🏻😡😡

9 | Cliff Cota | 10155485731071509_10155485784501509 | Never would happen here. Americans like others to see what they own even if they are not around.

11 | Lynne Irvine | 10155485731071509_10155485778431509 | I respectfully ask CNN not broadcast in a venue where you have to talk over protesters.  How does this enhance the NEWS?
12 | Rex Roy Lewis | 10155485731071509_10155485797446509 | Trippy, I had a dream about a garage like that years ago, but was for cars.

WHO THE HELL MADE UP THIS LAW?!?!?WHO WROTE THIS CORRUPT IDEA INTO LAW?!?!?!?You people need to get acquainted with the saying. "Absolute power, corrupts absolutely." These elitists pillage, and plunder the American Collective Purse for their benefit. They could be paying into Medicare, Medicaid, or Social Security. But no they make their buddies wealthy beyond the means of any average American.
16 | Dany Edwards | 10155485731071509_10155485764511509 | USA has Hillary the corrupt as president ! And she will make sure rich will get richer like Obama did ! Remember when Trump said landing in USA is like coming to a 3rd world country ?!

"Well, Chris, let me respond to that because that's horrifying." -- Hillary Clinton
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Bill Beardsley | 10155485697371509_10155485716671509 | Trump couldn't run a casino how can he run a country. He inherited his wealth and pissed most of it away. He also started a fake university. He isn't fit to run a fantasy baseball league.
2 | Dustin Messner | 10155485697371509_10155485729246509 | Hey CNN you do really suck.. Our household doesn't usually watch msm, and I am glad we don't. It has been proven that Clinton pays you and orchestrates you on her segments that are on CNN. Turner/CNN also has donated $817K to her campaign. Let me tell you something it shows. We watched CNN for two minutes, and it is no wonder why people think Hillary will win this election. Brainwash beyond belief. No other news outlet is quite like you. Let me tell you something, when Hillary loses, I am going to turn you on our TV just to see your mouths drop with absolutely nothing to say! I'm sure the money is good, but good luck to your credibility come November 8th!
3 | Dianne Noche Atienza | 10155485697371509_10155485714756509 | With the 2 presidential candidates, only Hillary is qualified to be the president. She has the experience(both positive and negative) in governing the country. Everybody learns from their mistakes, including Donald Trump. But Trump's experience and mistakes (when corrected), is not really applicable in governing the country. Trumps have the experience in governing his business, he can use that in managing FOX Network. It will be a shame to the world if he use it in running the USA. #PresidentHillaryClinton
4 | Stefan Konstantopoulos | 10155485697371509_10155485718166509 | Hillary's performance was embarrassing tonight. She would have done better if she spoke offf the cuff, rather than just read from her prepared statement cards. It was obvious she needed the extra crutch. Without those cards, she would have been sweating bullets. At any rate, she failed to do what she needed to do. She will not win.
5 | Johnny Connelly | 10155485697371509_10155485729776509 | Regarding the debates tonight... I think Hillary and Trump both handled themselves well.

6 | Mimi Snak | 10155485697371509_10155485731116509 | TRUMP IS A BIG BABY..... whines about everything!!!!! Has an excuse for everything, sore loser, racist, womanizer. If you people out there truly want a man running this country that can't even say that he will accept the winner whoever it is, then people you have a rude awakening coming your way if he gets in!!!!!!
7 | Stephen Saunders | 10155485697371509_10155485717821509 | There are millions of people who intend to vote for Trump who aren't voicing the fact for fear of needless confrontation.  On election day, however, their voices will ring the loudest.
8 | Sarah Stiegel | 10155485697371509_10155485717951509 | 8 Generations ago my direct relative, Col. Christopher Truby risked his life fighting the British in the American Revolution.  Today, nearly 240+ years later I find myself saddened by the state of our great country.  I have always felt pride being an American, a patriot, however at this time I'm almost embarrassed and most definitely saddened.  Our country has regressed 270+ years to a state where we need to overthrow our governing body.  Don't you remember learning in American history "no taxation without representation".?  Don't you remember the pride you felt learning how our founding fathers drafted such amazing documents like the Declaration of Independence and most importantly the Constitution of the United States?  Our fore-fathers died for those documents, those beliefs.  Now today 270+ years later our basic rights that we fought for are at stake and it sickens me to see how many people are willing to throw it all away.  This election isn't about taxes, immigration, or abortion, this election is about our basic American rights.  We are at risk of losing our guaranteed rights thanks to a corrupt woman and her ulterior motives.  I'm voting for America, for our founding fathers, for our Bill of Rights, for our Freedoms, for the best country in the world.  This isn't about race/ethnicity this is about US, as Americans, standing up for US, the greatest nation of the modern world.  We need to bring back unity, we need to be proud Americans.  It's time to stand up, with our right hand over our heart and proudly state "one God, indivisible, in liberty and justice for ALL".  Protect our America, our freedom.  Vote TRUMP 2016
9 | Todd Snarr | 10155485697371509_10155485701961509 | Donald Trump is not evil as described by Hilary Clinton, Democrats & these liberal news stations.They are all lying to you and some of you are falling for their lies.Being the owner of my S-Corp accounting business and the many years served with the Navy & IRS, Donald Trump is saying most everything correct. Do disagree on a couple of things, but most of it is true and correct for the "Real" Change needed for Our Country.If you buy into Hilary Clinton, like Obama, you are being deceived by many means.The stuff Hilary Clinton brought up regarding not paying taxes involves net operating losses carried back & then carried forward up to 20 years.&,Many people & businesses in our country to have these same tax benefits to claim losses. Hilary Clinton is a LIAR.I heard many lies from Hilary.Hilary Clinton, instead of answering the question given, turned away from it and tried to make up lies of Donald's character. This way Hilary Clinton doesn't have to answer the question.WAKE UP PEOPLE!!!!
10 | Wilson Deronette | 10155485697371509_10155485729061509 | CNN is a network of educated liars and corrupted reporters. You are not a news network, you are a compromised experienced American network. You are making matters worse for the system.
11 | Kathy Edgerly Aschauer | 10155485697371509_10155485719361509 | So I was just thinking that maybe some of the questions should have come from other sources For example The Supreme Court Justices Governors from troubled states & how about a question to TRUMP re: changing the tax code so he can't use it to his advantage & other wealthy people while the rest of the country pays federal taxesAlso similar questions for CLINTON
12 | Marie Garner | 10155485697371509_10155485784241509 | Why are you brainwashing people its because you are owned by the democrats, just like the UK BBC is run by the government. Clinton is a warmonger and a liar but you are always on her side and you never say the bad things about her which she has done for instance Benghazi. All you ever do is come down on Trump but Clinton is a dangerous person for America and the world
13 | Abby Fleischauer | 10155485697371509_10155485744126509 | Not on topic but the people yelling dumb stuff in the background during the pre & now post debate discussions are sooo annoying, how can you listen or even have a conversation. Now yelling Donald Trump, did he pay them to do this? 1 guy sounds so crazy , angry, & possibly drunk. It's ridiculous! I can't take much more of it
14 | Joey Hoeck | 10155485697371509_10155485767106509 | Trump won. The election is rigged. Stand up people. There scared to let trump in due to all the corruption. It's clear, so don't support CNN,abc, csnbc and the rest of the lies. In Indiana the Democrats have been cought changing Republican ballets to Democrat. The don't have a leg to stand on and they can't win fair. We all know trump has more supporters!! Trump2016
15 | Dave Kennedy | 10155485697371509_10155485706806509 | If Hillary Clinton Dodges and pivot anymore she should be on Dancing With the StarsI'm glad he brought up these videos a little bit more should of been saidhttps://milo.yiannopoulos.net/2016/10/blackout-okeefe-ignored-mainstream/
16 | Trisha VanHelten | 10155485697371509_10155485787906509 | If Hot Head Trump gets president mark my words we'll be in a nuclear war in no time. Is trigger happy he's a control freak and a bully he has no experience in war and making decisions at all. I believe he is the next anti-christ just like Hitler.. he would take illegal immigrants and ship them out on buses and trains and other words Deport them kind of sounds like what Hitler did to the Jews when he took them all off on trains to concentration camps in Poland and everywhere.. he's going to be like a Nazi and then we'll be back in another War just like Hitler because Hitler was racist and so is Trump think about that
17 | Annie Nguyen | 10155485697371509_10155485793641509 | Trump "I strongly support the military"Clinton "the military said Putin ordered a hack on intelligence accounts to disrupt the election"Trump "they're a bunch of idiots"
18 | Nicholas M Hager | 10155485697371509_10155485751561509 | They need to shut the people up yelling in the background behind the commentators. I switched off because I couldn't here them talk. And lose the Jesus signs too.
19 | Yolanda Antoine | 10155485697371509_10155485795876509 | It's amazing how Trump supporters can cry something is rigged, all of the people voting are democrats. Trump and his suppoters make more excuses  than a man on death row. So this tells us not only he will not accept a lose neither will his supporters.
20 | Vincent Gioielli | 10155485697371509_10155485711436509 | I believe it does matter who wins this election or others in the foreseen future. I hear people suggesting removing politicians, but I assure you any action such as that will have no measurable effect towards any favorable end state for us as the minorities who are not dream walking through reality. It does not matter if Hillary, Trump, and half of Congress were impeached from public service as that would not isolate the root cause of the issue. One thing I found true with physiological warfare methods when I was in Afghanistan is you always have to macro analyze every angle and break every detail down subsequently to find the root cause of the issue, as there are thousands of micro issues. From there you pick your courses of action based upon what gives you the highest measure of effectiveness towards achieving your goal. If you hypothetical impeached politicians from service it would still leave the country full of delusional and ignorant Americans. These are the same Americans that are voting for, supporting, and scheming over these candidates. Without these Americans supporting them and paying taxes to support their agendas the candidates would be powerless. People do not realize that we have had the power all along and a person in power is only as strong as the people who support them, but the people must be awakened to see that. They prey on your instinctual fears for survival and insecurities. Just like Hitler did with Germany, he took a population who was lost in a broken economy without direction and made them believe he could bring them into prosperity with his rhetorical speeches. Most people when threatened with the potential of ruining their delusion of security and comfort will willingly relinquish any and all rationality as a coping mechanism for their own survival.The problem is people will never rise collectively as they have been mentally handicapped through social engineering for generations. Just as the young children in Afghanistan who have been radicalized with ideological zealous perspectives of the Quran by corrupt mullahs, it starts with our children as well. Our education system from kindergarten through college has and still is indoctrinating many generations to be at the point to where they can be controlled. We as organisms and humans adapt to survive according to our external environment. People will articulate thoughts and view the world from their perspective (which is reality) based upon their theological, culture, sociological/economic, and educational environmental factors they have been indoctrinated into that has created the building blocks of their minds. These factors drive their subconscious and conscious thought processes for the rest of their lives. Only after educated themselves in adulthood and using critical thinking skills can they objectively question their indoctrination from birth. A constant driving force in our environment is the media and its influence to create a constant presence of manipulation on your conscious and subconscious mind which drives our actions. Our minds are constantly being barraged from all angles on how to feel, think, fabricating our moral baselines, and what courses of actions to take to achieve happiness according to societal standards. Where in this conundrum does it leave room for critical, objective, and creative thinkers?We are given the illusion of choices in life which are set in tightly fabricated parameters. Anyone who steps outsides these parameters is swiftly punished, ostracized, and lacks for quality of life. We have many meaningless choices, but few important that decide the outcome of our country as common citizens. You have hundreds of flavors of ice cream, movies to watch, games to attend, music to listen to, but only two choices in political parties to decide the fate of your country. The two parties are bought and sold by private interest that the common citizen can never dream of penetrating for their own aspirations to serve this nation. You cannot penetrate a party if you are not willing to consent to their agenda and let’s not forget you will also need exposure from the privately owned media in order to even become relevant.We think we have rights, but by definition a right is something that is inherent from birth and cannot be taken from the individual. So we know that to be true, we can logically say we only have a bill of privileges. Rights are not rights if they can be taken away. They are merely superficial constructs of the human mind to give you the illusion of choice to control and force you to consent into a system with no room to truly develop to your full potential.You also think you have ownership of your house, land, and assets? Try not paying your taxes and tell me how quickly you much you “own”. If you "own" something, it cannot be taken away from you, right? This sounds more like you are forced to consent into a monetary system of control that facilitates their dynamic labor force to drive industry, achieving clandestine strategic objectives, and collecting revenue from your already taxed wages. Then after already taxing your income they tax the possessions you buy. They literally control you and if you do not consent to their system a quality of life is nearly impossible.To defeat an ideological disease, which is what we have it starts with the children of our nation, which takes decades to develop. So when I correlate this thought process to the decline of our country over the decades I logically deduct that in my opinion this country was bought, sold, and prepared for these moments we are now facing a long before I was even born. I think we like other democracies rise and fall in cycles. We are in our decline and beyond all the corruption we are also financially crippled by debt which we can never mathematically repay. I don’t think of the future in a sense that I await its arrival and wonder when the day will come that I can say our country is gone out of our grasp. The arrival is now and I decided to keep my sanity by becoming a spectator. There is no course of action I feel I can take which will facilitate the ideological change of an entire nation of citizens, which is where the root cause of the issue stems from.The bottom line we the people of this nation who pay taxes and empower elected officials to serve us cannot take back the nation to regain our unified power away from the federal government until the people realize they do not currently posses any power. We have been divided into so many groups and against each other internally, because it is easy to control micro groups, instead of a unified group. Also once we stop fighting within each other, then we start to become more awakened and realizing our issues correlate more towards who is governing us, rather than purely from dynamics among each other. As long as citizens of this country remain delusional that they have a stake in the outcome due to the illusion of freedoms and choices we are given to control us currently, this country will not progress in the right direction.

22 | Dayee Mouwon | 10155485697371509_10155485775921509 | People saying he have the right to call her "nasty woman " because she supports 9 months abortion...From her answer, she didn't say she supports abortion, her only point is, that man should not be telling women how to take care of their own body. By the way, I don't see any law telling man how to control their dick....
23 | Fabian Sheppard | 10155485697371509_10155485731651509 | how come they never mention Jill Stein or Gary Johnson thats why people don't trust the media you guys act like there the only 2 candidates how about you talk more about jill and gary we the peoples sick of hearing about your 2 favorite candidates!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! p.s hillary stole from the white house on her way out during the end of bills term and had to return the goods!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
24 | Ma Theresa D Shiver | 10155485697371509_10155485795881509 | Trump won the debate for giving honest, straight answers to ALL questions. Hillary was just very sleek to deflect, avoid and going around the bush with her answers. She did not give answers to some questions. Indeed a SEASONED POLITICIAN. ALL TALK!
25 | Kunle Musky Ogunmola | 10155485697371509_10155485776321509 | He wont even listen to his campaign team, what would it cost him to have said he would concede and accept the results when the election is over. Trump listens to no one, how do we expect him to listen to his advicers if he becomes president. The man is hilarious! :-)

JUST IN: Hillary Clinton won the final presidential debate 52% to 39%, according to a CNN / ORC poll of debate watchers http://cnn.it/2e8faBX
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Harut Pogosyan | 10155485573376509_10155485575296509 | Go Hillary!! 3:0!! Bye, bye "NASTY" Trump!! #ImWithHer #StrongerTogether
2 | Matthew Nixon | 10155485573376509_10155485582081509 | CNN, your "news" network has turned into such a biased joke that fails to report real stories and facts to the public. The fact that you openly promote Clinton  while always bashing the other candidates goes to show the agenda and shameful efforts by this once great news organization.
3 | Justin Dancer | 10155485573376509_10155485587256509 | So 100% of the people who watched it say she won? I never did a poll. Plus most Hillary fans watch CNN. Just saying. #MediaBias
4 | Masum Ahmed | 10155485573376509_10155485582196509 | Trump said - in the ninth month you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb.”- But in reality Abortions do not happen at 9 months pregnant. there is no such thing as a nine month abortion.Trump said - We have some bad hombres and we're going to get them out.- He offended Hispanic people here againHe said - Such a nasty women to Hillary.- Wow! How come this guy said he has tremendous respect for Women.Finally Trump refused to say he would accept the result of next month's presidential election.-This is a big insult of American democracy.
5 | Jody Tarpening | 10155485573376509_10155485587966509 | I hope we don't vote for another polished politician! Obama sang the song to many and didn't follow through with any promises besides some healthcare dictionary that doesn't make sense to even the professionals! We can't vote for this woman! Please don't listen to the very biased media and do the research yourself! Media is a joke! We talk about several issues and on every single channel they want to replay the part where he said he would decide late on the support of the outcome of this election. Who gives a piss! I don't like losing either! I don't like trying to battle a candidate and the majority of every media outlet around! We are the puppets in this whole game! We listen to people on TV like it was GOD speaking to us directly! We listen to advice from celebrities and athletes as if they have every answer known to man! Heck we think actors that go on drunk binges do every drug known to man and beat their families are heroes when they seem to get their life back on track! Then we listen to what they would do or who they would vote for.. you have to be kidding me! We have taken GOD out of our lives and what do we do.... accept it! We are taking the sides of criminals over our trusted law enforcement and what do we do.... accept it! We are allowing men and women really to choose what bathroom to use on what ever day they feel like they most relate to and what do we do.... accept it! We allow people to burn our flags and be a role model kneeing for our national anthem what do we do... accept it! Now a school in South Carolina wants to remove the flag from the school because it offends people what do we do.... you got it.. accept it! We let 1000's of refugees into our country and give them more than we give our own.. that's ok we accept that too!I remember accepting that our idiot president Obama released known terrorist killers from our custody to free a soldier that he honored as a hero but ended up realizing the guy committed treason! What did we say to that... nothing we accepted it! Wake up! We have to change what direction this country is going or else our children and our children's children will be faced with something we can't even imagine! We have to stop looking the other way we have to stop accepting the actions of our government without putting up a fight! Vote for Hillary in November and it could be the nail in the coffin!
6 | Travis William Smith | 10155485573376509_10155485577796509 | Of course you would say that cnn..." This just in" you're all on crack
7 | Muhammad Sadiq | 10155485573376509_10155485579916509 | Hillary did an amazing job (yet again)! I love how you conduct yourself. You are definitely a classy, intelligent woman and I can't wait to see you elected November 8th! #ImWithHer
8 | Joaquin Valdez | 10155485573376509_10155485576486509 | Intellectually she won by a landslide. The baboon will not even accept defeat; how is that presidential, come on!
9 | Derek Sellers | 10155485573376509_1772877292975851 | Wait. CNN asked their viewers who won the debate, and people said Clinton?! I better switch over to Fox to see what they said. You all are sheep. Congrats
10 | Jennifer Spier | 10155485573376509_1808507859368383 | CNN is the most unreliable media outlet ever! Can't wait for trump to win and them actually have to report some real truths about him. It will be odd hearing them speak nice for once!
11 | Eric Sklar | 10155485573376509_1797127303877410 | Clinton News Network.... I'm not sure where you get your results from, Trump won hands down, she can't answer the Clinton Foundation accurately, avoided all of her emails from wikileaks and open boarder as it was for energy... put your Crack pipe down. She is by far the worst person to be a candidate for president and she should be in jail.
12 | Abhi Joshi | 10155485573376509_10155485591146509 | Trump lost badly, same old boring lines, rambling on points that make no sense. But I gotta give him credit for being entertaining, he was the butt of some very funny remarks. So long Putins Pumpkin Spice Puppet, back in your holes deplorables. Its over.
13 | Gargi Karmaker | 10155485573376509_10155485603271509 | Hillary won even in the 2nd debate too according to CNN when all other polls clearly showed Trump won....for only once CNN  mention the fact that they take the votes from registered democrats only  and next times never mention it ..so dishonest CNN..
14 | Matthew Bunton | 10155485573376509_1772878856309028 | On the second debate, it took CNN 1.5 hrs to get results. Not it just took them only 30 min. CNN already new she lost. I hate mainstream media. Only Fox and one american news is for me. #CNNISBOUGHTOUT
15 | Macky Cosmos | 10155485573376509_10155485585691509 | Clearly the vile predator and Russian sympathizer/draft dodger lost this important debate and further proved his incompetence by refusing to acknowledge defeat should it come. I am truly feeling blessed to be alive and witnessing a woman ascend to the presidency as the gravity of this great accomplishment is immeasurably beautiful and not to mention, it is about time. #ImWithHer #HillaryClinton
16 | Jeffrey W White | 10155485573376509_10155485596241509 | How can someone running for President of this country get away with saying we have a democracy! News flash Mrs. Clinton, this is a CONSTITUTIONAL REPUBLIC!!!!
17 | Haisha Patricia Rene Acelas | 10155485573376509_1772879572975623 | Can t wait for November 8th to hear Hillary C is the first Female  President. Back to back history... Sorry Trump America already great That s why I left my country to live and get a better life.
18 | Joshua Steventon | 10155485573376509_1797126620544145 | So when did CNN become the official winner declaring Network? I would like to see a poll from an independent news source. CNN has become nothing but the Clinton News Network, and I'm not even a Donald Trump supporter.
19 | Christine Tina Chingono | 10155485573376509_1772878402975740 | Hilary is diplomatic & well poised. She doesn't need to make rude comments to get her point across. USA doesn't need to be turned into a battleground the way #Trump would. He has no idea how to compromise - to him, it's his way or no way at all. Vote for #Clinton2016!
20 | Isidro Hernandez | 10155485573376509_1772880989642148 | I have a question why is every major News source bashing Trump and sugar coating Hillary not one has said anything good about Trump every major News source is saying he hates women and he said hombre CNN called him a turd. No major News source says nothing about the his solutions for the real problems in our Country and Tensions in the World .
21 | Gregory Audette | 10155485573376509_720287731451822 | The level of collusion, corruption and illegal coordination between the Obama Whitehouse, DOJ , Hillary Clinton and the DNC is staggering !!!  Couple that with the extreme liberal bias of the media flooding the airways with negative accusations about Trump while giving Hillary a pass on criminal violations is disgusting !!  America is in moral decline !!
22 | Josh N Amber Gagnier | 10155485573376509_1772882452975335 | If we went to Mars and found the smallest microbe we would claim we found LIFE.... But a baby is not alive until they are out of the womb according to Hillary Clinton.  She admitted to saying its ok to kill a child days before they are born. When will she be ok with killing the elderly when its evident they are going to die?
23 | Giyoo Suswaram Higashide | 10155485573376509_1004061009704579 | this is a joke right? look at polls from everywhere...it's Trump that's winning the hearts of people in America. Even if Hillary walked in drunk, CNN would post that she won...because they would have generated the false polls even before the debate.
24 | Kenny Jourdain | 10155485573376509_1797130623877078 | 🚨🚨🚨Rigged 🚨🚨🚨. CNN you were never news. FOXNews has four more credibility than you. You guys are hacks and Hillary puppets🚨🚨🚨
25 | Rubener OmiDina Yemaya | 10155485573376509_10155485585276509 | Did anyone else think that After the Debates Trump did not give Melania, a Friendly greeting as well to his son . But he he did with the Blond women .MMM Pretty strange just watch it . THANKS HILLARY , Start Practicing .

Hillary Clinton, citing Bernie Sanders, calls Donald J. Trump "the most dangerous person in modern history to have run for president." http://cnn.it/2e8elJE
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | MV Kemp | 10155485535431509_10155485538281509 | The massive corruption with the Clinton's, the complicit media and eight years of Obama really has us circling the drain.🇺🇸🇺🇸VOTE TRUMP🇺🇸🇺🇸
2 | Michael Spivey | 10155485535431509_10155485537706509 | Trump's refusal to accept a loss could incite violence on and after Election Day. It poisons our system of government. It divides people even further. Even the most well constructed republic relies on decorum and unwritten rules to survive. This man doesn't care. Everyone else in the GOP- everyone- must immediately accept the results to send a strong message
3 | Joyann Tinsel | 10155485535431509_10155485561031509 | Was undecided until tonight. Hillary Clinton never addressed any of the serious issues raised tonight. I'm happy that this debate seems so much more fair and now with the Forum that brought in the fairness my vote is going to Trump
4 | Bobby B. Bentley | 10155485535431509_10155485538656509 | Indeed, Saudi Arabia has donated up to $50 million to the Clinton Foundation, despite their horrid human rights. Qatar donated $1,000,000 to $5,000,000 to the Clinton Foundation despite Clinton being well aware of the country’s horrific record of violence against women.Fact-Check: TRUE
5 | Marisela DlCruz Bebawi | 10155485535431509_10155485538801509 | Thank you donald for handling the presidency so easily to Mrs. Clinton.She just had to let you talk.
6 | Robert Neff | 10155485535431509_10155485551571509 | What makes Trump even more dangerous is the absurd amount of all the loonies supporting him with no regard to what he says or does.
7 | Tammy Kirkpatrick-Driver | 10155485535431509_10155485571381509 | What's funny CNN is the fact your polls are off way off and all the other polls I see shows Trump is wayyyy up compared to Hillary ... No way Hillary is going to win... I truly believe the silent people of the lands will go vote and Trump will be President
8 | Yan Puebla | 10155485535431509_10155485556226509 | Trump: Nobody has more respect for women than me, believe me.... 20 mins to Hilary "What a Nasty woman", this clown is the biggest joke ever.
9 | Sherry Vogt | 10155485535431509_10155485573386509 | she's already cheated bernie sanders..she's paid people to riot at rallys...her and Obama emailed back and forth so the FBI is protecting Obama and hillary...she's a liar...a cheater...she's taken money from Saudi Arabia and other countries. ..she thinks it's ok for full term abortions when there are many people that would adopt...im for a woman's right to choose but unless the mothers life really is at risk...im against a full term abortion...Google all the people that are dead because of them...Google julian assange of WikiLeaks. ...he's exposing them so his life is in danger....if trump wins his life will be in danger along with all American lives...I believe she is under mind control and unhealthy...we need a change....He stands up for himself and doesn't cave into conforming to what othere say
10 | Jeffrey Anderson | 10155485535431509_10155485542126509 | Clinton News Network "CNN" Hillary and " Obama bin Lyin" , just bringing ISIS to a neighborhood near you , free everything , while he cuts Vets money and lets them die on the streets 💀💀💀💀💀
11 | Wen Wu | 10155485535431509_10155485583221509 | You are the most dangerous and corrupted presidential candidate in the whole history of man kind, Hillary! Hillary supporters are just blind at this point. How could anyone support her knowing all the lies and corruptions? Hillary is experienced in giving speeches to Wall Street companies and received $225000, $300000 per speech! Think about it: why would any company give anyone this amount of money unless they get something in returns? A vote for Hillary is a vote for corruption and this country will become the puppet of the world. How can someone in his/her right mind to support and vote for this corrupted individual is beyond my comprehension.
12 | Robert Peebles | 10155485535431509_10155485537001509 | He's a danger to American values and humanity. He refused to even except the outcome of the election.. the will of the people.  He is what's wrong with the system.. not the system itself. The proverbial toilet bowl which is the RNC, used their last wish to nominate this turd.  Out of all the Republican floaters that were in the water, this one was pulled out, dried off and touted as the greatest of all.   Now, republican voters (good decent people) are being made to swallow said turd; in hopes that if elected, the turd will taste better than it looks. It won't. It's a turd. Don't eat turds. #votehillary
13 | Percy Naranjo | 10155485535431509_10155485629651509 | Accept the outcome of an election? when Hillary Clinton's definition of democracy is what she did to Bernie Sanders. Pardon Trump's extreme cynicism.
14 | Deonte Ford | 10155485535431509_10155485609326509 | On November 8th I will do all I can as a citizen of this country to ensure that the Fascist far right movement does not succeed in electing Donald Trump into the White House. #ImWithHer!
15 | Patty McElhatton Lewis | 10155485535431509_10155485618376509 | Tell me why Hillary Clinton got away without answering questions that were given to her??Donald Trump answered the questions about the eight women that just in the last week ironically have come forward saying he had  kiss them or fondled them! And Hillary was supposed to address  her husband's affairs which were documented and he paid $850,000 to one girl to shut her mouth! She completely ignored answering that totally why is the media not talking about that right now!Donald Trump was the only one that  talked about our veterans? Men and women that fought for our country and are suffering with the worst medical care known to man! He mentioned illegal immigrants have got better healthcare than our veterans! Why isn't the media talking about that that he said? Hillary didn't even address our veterans!! Stop focusing on ONE thing Donald Trump said! Let's talk about what Hillary Clinton didn't answer the emails the videos the things that she said that came out in Wikipedia! And she thinks Donald trumps got the Russians against her!! Cut me a break she might as will just say the aliens are out for her too!And there's no doubt with these women coming forth in the last week against Donald Trump that definitely her campaign had something to do with it because she's got constant nasty commercials repeating over and over and over brainwashing people and children she says she's concerned about what children seeing what Trump says or does but she continues up show them these commercials over and over again!!
16 | Charles Martinez | 10155485535431509_10155485580666509 | I'm glad as are millions of others are also that Trump may or may not accept the results. This is in reference to a habitual liar that cheated on her last opponent (Bernie Sanders). Of course Bernie Sanders is going to support his party what's unfortunate is when he sold out to the same person that cheated him out of the election and has the backing of Wall Street of which he despised..... Hilary is a despicable person and rotten to the soul.
17 | Aaron Thiel | 10155485535431509_10155485544086509 | Hillary turned into a stuttering mess that couldn't control the volume of her voice. Could you imagine her negotiating with a hostile Putin with WWIII hanging in the balance? Hillary is in over her head and she knows it. This isn't the peaceful world her husband seen during his presidency and it scares the crap out of her.
18 | Isidro Hernandez | 10155485535431509_10155485627256509 | I have a question why is every major News source bashing Trump and sugar coating Hillary not one has said anything good about Trump every major News source is saying he hates women and he said hombre CNN called him a turd.

19 | Marsha Picton Weaver | 10155485535431509_10155485573481509 | She actually said that she is for killing a baby inside it's mothers womb even though it could survive an early delivery...any women that is ok with this is a disgrace.
20 | Cindy Boggs | 10155485535431509_10155485581426509 | I just want to say, CNN used to be an actual news source, now it's nothing but a biased, piece of crap, propaganda site.  I'm unfollowing CNN....no, I'm not a trump fan, but this obviously one sided reporting from a supposed news site is a joke.
21 | David C. Nasworthy | 10155485535431509_10155485629136509 | CNN News, you keep telling the sheep that elections aren't rigged but weren't you just caught falsifying polls and news stories for the DNC ? You remember , right? Wasserman-Shultz, resigning in shame ......elections are rigged?
22 | George Pilny | 10155485535431509_980491428744704 | CNN your words mean nothing!  Which sanders quote should we trust?!(CNN)- 4-7-2016Bernie Sanders is standing by his criticism that Hillary Clinton isn't "qualified" to be president as the Democratic presidential candidates engage in an increasingly heated battle ahead of the New York primary.https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2016/04/06/politics/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-qualified/index.html?client=safari
23 | Mark Sapanara | 10155485535431509_10155485593141509 | CNN's coverage of this election is an embarrassment. You are so obviously biased toward Hillary. You have gone from a respected worldwide news bureau to a sensationalizing tabloid.
24 | Gregory Hall | 10155485535431509_555620581305482 | Apparently, the FBI forgot to visit the Cornell Law Library. Word for word from the Cornell Law Library Former United States Attorney General Michael Mukasey tells MSNBC that not only is Hillary Clinton's private email server illegal, it "disqualifies" her from holding any federal office. Very specifically points to one federal law, Title 18. Section 2071.For those of us who do not have United States Code committed to memory, here's what it says:“(a) Whoever willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys, or attempts to do so, or, with intent to do so takes and carries away any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both. (b) Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States. As used in this subsection, the term “office” does not include the office held by any person as a retired officer of the Armed Forces of the United States.”Yes, it explicitly states "shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States.Shouldn't voters know that? The media won't tell them. So it's up to us. Post this everywhere
25 | Ray Georgean | 10155485535431509_10155485562446509 | So wait Clinton can talk bs, but Trump can't say anything back, it's not "bate" it's called calling her out as she was wrong!

1 | Eric Strunk | 10155485495321509_10155485515071509 | Can someone tell me how Trumps page has 11 million likes and Hillary's page has only 7 million. How come when I'm out driving I see hundreds of trump signs all over the place and only a hand full of Hillary signs. Trump rallies have people waiting outside because they're sold out. Hillary doesn't fill the room. Who the hell are these people polling? They have not called me or anyone I know!
2 | DM Craig | 10155485495321509_10155485515016509 | Putin respects me, but doesn't respect Hillary." Oh, dear LORD!!!! Putin is PLAYING you because he knows what an IDIOT YOU ARE. As Russia is building anti-missile and aircraft systems AROUND SYRIA --for WHAT? TO TAKE OUT AMERICAN AIRCRAFT! DUMP TRUMP!!!!.
3 | Mahdi Calanle | 10155485495321509_10155485515546509 | Sorry, Mr. Trump doesn't have time for a post debate interview, he has to check in with Putin, and then start planning his revenge tweets.
4 | Robert E. Jonas | 10155485495321509_10155485515561509 | Wait, wait wait... Hillary is all about saving 32,000 innocent toddler lives, but but but... she's all about aborting countless amounts of innocent babies?So, she wants to save lives, or end them? End Them.... She's on record that a baby is not alive even at 32 weeks, so its ok to kill them...My wife and i are expecting and she scares rhe Hell out of us!Major Robert Jonas,Ph.d
5 | Scott Burk | 10155485495321509_10155485519211509 | WOW, looks like someone opened the Trump nuthouse and let the crazies out. Thank you so much Van Jones for bringing us back to reality.
6 | Coty Hopkins | 10155485495321509_10155485519306509 | Haha!! The media is feeling the squeeze tonight. Their girl is on the ropes, and they are trying to spin her into a positive light.
7 | Darin RGra | 10155485495321509_10155485515571509 | Such a fake speech on Hillary's part. It is the same ole same ole. Improve lives of the middle class, the children, get jobs rolling again etc. They all have been saying it for years for the Presidential election Peanut Gallery but nothing worth noting for improvement. The only job rolling I see is rolling out of this country. Trump talks a different tone because he means what he says and is at the least being honest with us to the best of his ability for what he knows at this moment trying to fight through all of this muck that has been created. I don't think I would remark on what I would accept or not accept if I knew there was known corruption with what is supposes to be a fair and honest election. Why agree to losing due to criminal behavior. I wouldn't make that statement either at this moment. Hillary pretty said it at the end what she want to accomplish and that is "Make America Great Again" just in different words and almost sounded like she was going to say it.
8 | Christine Mary | 10155485495321509_10155485525581509 | CNN. You're losing our viewership. This Jeffrey on your panel is another certified moron. Your blonde female supporter of Trump feels her outfit is proper for this? I don't think so.Different standards for the GOP.
9 | Donna Woolner | 10155485495321509_10155485524076509 | Van Jones wish he would shut up!!! Again CNN is soooo one sided. I would never trust anything they have to say.. Hillary is a killer , liar, email schemer and CNN has no problem with this . Very sad!!!
10 | Kristine Bonilla-Dutra | 10155485495321509_10155485522931509 | Get off this issue CNN,   why don't you talk about all the other issues that were debated tonight like the economy,  Obama care, immigration ...omgSeriously, gee whiz
11 | Michael Jett | 10155485495321509_10155485523031509 | I think Van Jones should run for president, he is thoughtful, sincere and tells it like it is, plus hello you cant polish a turd is my new go to statement
12 | Gina Marshall | 10155485495321509_1833167940259909 | Smartest man I have ever had the pleasure to listen to. Major respect for Van Jones. Hands down...the most rational, logical, fair-minded commentator I have ever heard speak. Kudos for his intelligence, poise, composure, and grace. Thank you for your sanity during all of the insanity of this election year! ♡
13 | Ralph Olson | 10155485495321509_10155485523116509 | Van jones hit it dead on..he almost cried..because he knew democracy and freedom of america is at stake..but trumps "poorly educated" wont know that..how sad indeed..
14 | Timothy Adam Luke Godkin | 10155485495321509_10155485547161509 | Actually, Anderson Cooper; turds can be polished. MythBusters tested the saying and proved it's possible to polish lion poop and a couple of others. We get the point you were trying to make though, which is 100% on point in this case LOL.
15 | Nathalie Ben Kely-Scott | 10155485495321509_10155485522796509 | Let's see 6 of you Clinton supporters at that table and 2 trump supporters!!!??? That's very fair and unbiased!!!!???? How can we make up our minds on whom to vote for when you media hacks try to choose for us!!!?
16 | Josh Lewellen | 10155485495321509_1833167953593241 | I had to change the channel on these dip-shits. Nothing but a bunch of Hillary Clinton supporters! CNN has rigged the elections here, folks. #JL
17 | Taylor Na'Chelle | 10155485495321509_1161437123895499 | Hillary should start preparing her Presidential acceptance speech. Because I don't see how anyone can take Trump seriously. He has managed to offend the LGBT community, the female race, minorities, those with mental illness, the families of troops who have served and died, and the list goes on and on. #DumpTrump
18 | Joel Medina De Leon | 10155485495321509_10155485523441509 | The Reporters at CNN are like these two politicians. they start talking about a specific issue, and instead of giving an answer or talk about it, they turn around and criticize what the other candidate did or didn't  do!! SMH
19 | Judi Arbogast | 10155485495321509_10155485516291509 | Gore questioned the results of the election for weeks and questions it to this day! What about that? Discussion please!
20 | Todd Samuel | 10155485495321509_1161427887229756 | "Senator Clinton, please answer this question about the Clinton foundation" - clintons reponse "well you know Trump has no respect for woman" well done Hillary for not answering a single question as always
21 | Babbie Stephenson Peters | 10155485495321509_10155485542781509 | thank god for Van Jones, the only one who spoke the truth about the spoiled brat antics that the bully trump displayed at the debate. I can't wait for the CNN skit on SNL this weekend.
22 | Maurilio Goncalves Campos | 10155485495321509_1161431393896072 | Trump's refusal to accept a loss could incite violence on and after Election Day. It poisons our system of government. It divides people even further. Even the most well constructed republic relies on decorum and unwritten rules to survive. This man doesn't care. Everyone else in the GOP- everyone- must immediately accept the results to send a strong message
23 | Dave Bartlett | 10155485495321509_10155485530256509 | Obviously this Turd running his mouth is clearly out to bash Trump. He apparently has overlooked many of Clinton's actions and comments. Maybe this Turd should seek getting himself polished 1st
24 | David C. Nasworthy | 10155485495321509_1161430810562797 | Every single person on this stage including this very excitable black gentleman is voting for Hillary Clinton and none of them have ever criticised her in any of their stories .But the system ain't rigged. CNN News, weren't you guys just caught falsifying polls and news stories for the DNC?But the system ain't rigged.
25 | Derek Brothers | 10155485495321509_991988054245069 | Van Jones is a disgrace to the black race. I've been watching CNN the last couple months and it seems to me he is paid to put down trump. You are a disgrace to the black race. You are full of it

Donald J. Trump refuses to say he would accept the result of next month's presidential election http://cnn.it/2evJULz
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Violet Sanchez | 10155485471566509_10155485481356509 | Of course he'll keep it in suspense,  if he wins, he will say that everything was right and honest,  but if he lose he will cry like a cry baby he is claiming of a rigged election... he's so predictable and pathetic
2 | Alexis Gonzalez | 10155485471566509_10155485475631509 | I just looked at about ten different polls on who won the debate tonight. The ones that said Clinton had won were already closed. The polls that were still open had overwhelming votes for Trump, and they were still pouring in. Hmmmm 🤔🤔🤔
3 | Jason Bover | 10155485471566509_10155485477711509 | WikiLeaks has already proven the primaries against Bernie were rigged. Why the hell would Trump believe the election would be any different?
4 | Robby Carter | 10155485471566509_10155485475961509 | Trump reminds me of that special ed kid from high school who wanted to fight everyone but no one would do it because they would get in trouble.
5 | Eric Yourchisin | 10155485471566509_10155485476931509 | Yawn... Come on CNN i know you can do it.... Call out Hillary on something... Just one thing... A hair out of place... Or she sniffed .. Just something..
6 | Sean Warren | 10155485471566509_10155485475346509 | Ok this isn't funny anymore, where are the real candidates??? Because I swear we're all on one long episode of Punk'd, and we're just waiting for Ashton Kutcher to come out and dupe us all...smh
7 | Stacy Brown | 10155485471566509_10155485489921509 | I love how the debate is over and all CNN has done is criticize Trump!! Not one criticism has been said about Hillary! And people wonder why he is complaining about the rigging ! CNN is using the media to get people to Hillary..
8 | Kyle Switzer | 10155485471566509_10155485486291509 | How exactly did he refuse to answer the question? He said he would at the appropriate time after the election. With everything that Hillary's campaign is doing, he was well with in his rights.
9 | Gabriel Thomas | 10155485471566509_10155485476481509 | this is the best slogan for Trump so far. I can't help but give Trump credit for single-handedly destroyed the GOP and turned it into the PGP (P***y Grabbing Party). Bravo for that. You succeeded where the Dems have failed to do for decades.👍🏻👍🏻🙏🏻
10 | Milton Cosby | 10155485471566509_10155485490341509 | If the election process is rigged than there is no integrity in the process. Trump is competing against people that for thirty, or more years have shown to the America people that they have no integrity. If he lose the election, I can understand him leading a revolt. Our Founding Fathers said, a little revolt is healthy for a democratic society. We are long over due.
11 | Tommy Carter | 10155485471566509_10155485493111509 | Trump I will not go gentle into that dark night . Thank you Mr. Trump for saying what 200 million of us are thinking, I will not surrender to the rule of this crooked women   . Win, lose or draw this election is like flight 93 we have no choice but to fight because under Hilary's rule we will all die anyway . I could hear the 2nd amendment people saying from my cold dead hands . This trying to hold on for another 4 years of this evil crap is just too unthinkable to even be considered now so I will let you know is a great answer .
12 | WayneandEsther Tester | 10155485471566509_10155485489701509 | ET:  Will I accept the outcome of the election if Hillary wins, knowing full well that her campaign has admitted to rigging the election?  I'll have to wait and see. I'll leave everyone in suspense. And yes, that makes me a patriotic American when I care about the injustice of a presidential nominee trying to override my vote, because I'm an American who loves America and my vote for my country's leader who will appoint my country's Supreme Court justices who will shape my country for my future as an American should count.
13 | Kov Japiassu | 10155485471566509_10155485489166509 | Trump is definitely someone you can't take seriously.... he can't even answer a single question, of course that if nothing goes in his favor then it's automatically rigged... seems like he's just trying to promote his next reality show!
14 | Allison Howze | 10155485471566509_10155485490231509 | My absolute favorite thing said about tonight's disgrace of a debate was so perfectly put by CNN's Van Jones..."You can't polish a turd." Such a very very sad but true reference to this election. 🤔
15 | Robert Brown | 10155485471566509_10155485476426509 | I give Wallace a 4 out of 10. He ask Trump about the lying Women but never ask Hillary about her Raping Husband. just say No to Say NO to Hillary Clinton for president and YES to Donald Trump For President Great job on the Debate Mr. Trump you knocked it out of the ball park.
16 | Jessica Russo Miller | 10155485471566509_1784308541826670 | STOP highlighting this, unless it's to highlight that it's the worst question ever asked at a debate! Neither of them will genuinely support each other. He didn't say either way, she went on to make it dramatic saying how horrifying it was, yet she never answered if she would support a Trump win. Worst question - waste of time and media
17 | Shandy Elliott | 10155485471566509_10155485502461509 | And WHO would claim to accept something that is IN THE FUTURE especially where there is so many RECENT controversies against Hillary?Seriously, if you were in his position, you can't possibly say that you would simply accept the results when you have black and white proof that "something" is going on.
18 | Don Poyas | 10155485471566509_10155485495416509 | Chris Wallace didn't ask about ObamaCare, law and order, the inner cities, school vouchers, FBI quid pro quo, sanctuary cities, Benghazi. Stop dithering over whether Trump wants to support Clinton. Al Gore sued when he lost! Trump wins our vote.
19 | Emerson Williams | 10155485471566509_1834245640142660 | Hillary has the FBI, DOJ, several journalist, Mark Zuckerberg, Google, and many others in her pocket but you still don't believe the system is rigged?? Ask Bernie Sanders. #wikileaks
20 | Julie Packer Vergari | 10155485471566509_1784321495158708 | Well if Hillary wins, it'll be at least another 4 years where my husband and I will struggle and struggle - bringing home less and less. These democrats do NOTHING for the lower middle class!
21 | Otto Wulff | 10155485471566509_10155485499791509 | Have you noticed when anything is brought up to Hillary that she can't lie her way out of it she laughs waits a few seconds and changes subject.
22 | Tracee Foster | 10155485471566509_10155485500666509 | I was old enough and remember this, Al Gore refused to except the out come of the elecrion in 2000.On November 7, 2000, projections indicated that Gore's opponent, George W. Bush, had narrowly won the election. Gore won the national popular vote but lost the electoral college vote after a bitter legal battle over disputed vote counts in the state of Florida. Bush won the election on the electoral college vote of 271 to 266. One elector pledged to Gore did not cast an electoral vote; Gore received 267 pledged electors. The election was one of the most controversial in American history.[1][2]
23 | Zoe Kaiser | 10155485471566509_10155485482521509 | I'm going to say it again...Just want to point out that Clinton JUST TOLD THE WORLD OUR NUCLEAR RESPONSE TIME. Yeah. She'd keep us real safe. She really is bad at holding classified information.
24 | William Winston | 10155485471566509_1784321605158697 | This point seems to me to be less earth-shaking than Hillary's point-and-examples of Donald claiming everything that goes against him is rigged. Who cares if he accepts the election results? As soon as the winner is announced by the electorial college, I hope the US media will treat Donald Trump with the same studied disinterest that it is showing to the 66 tribes gathered at Standing Rock. Trump fears he's going deaf if he doesn't hear his name mentioned a lot in the media.
25 | Alex Kunitsky | 10155485471566509_1784311035159754 | Did anyone else watch CNN's post debate analysis for the first 30-40 minutes?! 2 Trump supporters against 7 Clinton supporters...talk about clear media bias. Then they cut to a small group of anchors who are all Clinton supporters. Now someone will say "and Fox isn't biased?" right? Now ask yourself how many majors news networks there are....CBS, ABC, CNN, MSNBC, etc. so 1 network against all the rest is a fair fight? Right........... The wise folks can watch any coverage from any channel and figure out what's BS, what's out of context, and most important: what stories get the most attention. I'm talking on both sides of the political isle. Support who you want but media bias is at an all time high and that's clear as day.

2 | Marcus Thomas | 10155485343041509_10155485409376509 | No one has more respect for women than me.(less than an hour later...)Such a nasty woman. - Donald Trump
3 | Chris Switzer | 10155485343041509_10155485408496509 | After tonight, may the deplorable and gutter dwellers known as the trump turds, be forever flushed back down to the sewers where they belong.
4 | Dianne Noche Atienza | 10155485343041509_10155485408676509 | With the 2 presidential candidates, only Hillary is qualified to be the president. She has the experience(both positive and negative) in governing the country. Everybody learns from their mistakes, including Donald Trump. But Trump's experience and mistakes (when corrected), is not really applicable in governing the country. Trumps have the experience in governing his business, he can use that in managing FOX Network. It will be a shame to the world if he use it in running the USA. #PresidentHillaryClinton
5 | Mateo Horhay | 10155485343041509_10155485408011509 | Before the comments get too nasty. Here is a positive one. I hope the remainder of your week is a great one. God bless you. God bless everyone. God bless America!
6 | Josh Lewellen | 10155485343041509_10155485422216509 | CNN is nothing but a joke. Clearly it's a democratic station. The majority of news anchors support Hillary. CNN is the laughing stock of all news channels. Their news reporters are complete idiots, they don't go off of facts, they go off of social media. #JL

12 | Rachel Campbell | 10155485343041509_10155485438861509 | He just had to say it in that manner which is so tasteless. What Donald Trump fails to realize is that the minorities are becoming the majority and so pandering to just white uneducated people will no longer work!
13 | Giancarlo Felipa | 10155485343041509_10155485417891509 | The reason Donald Trump did not agree to accept the outcome of the election. It's because all the theifth the Democrats have done. Plus he flat out won the debate. So many questions she didn't want to answer.
14 | Barry Smith | 10155485343041509_10155485418836509 | Hilary...free college, no tax raise, raise minimum wage, make all illegal aliens legal without question.Who is going to PAY for that????Too good to be true! See the light people!
15 | Dego Racer | 10155485343041509_10155485415646509 | Everyone I see bashing Trump but look at politics on a whole over the world people. The sweet talking and calm is always the dangerous one trust me. Like all politicians, they talk talk talk, promise you stuff and nothing is done. Those two may not be qualified overall based on reports but I believe Trump can try a thing or two to make America great if you allow him to. He is not like all politicians where they talk nice but tell the truth as it is and that's what hurting most a ya'll smh.
16 | Linda Bowles | 10155485343041509_10155485428241509 | She said 90 % of the Clinton Foundation goes to charity, that is a lie. She is not fit to be President. The one job of the federal government is to protect America. By using the server for her job she failed at National security. Don't matter who shared the emails, she still broke the law.
17 | Jeff Shaw | 10155485343041509_10155485416881509 | Was Clint Eastwood preparing Trump for the debate? This line could be from one of his westerns. "Let's get on our horses pardner and run down those bad hombres."

19 | Elada Sanders | 10155485343041509_10155485421071509 | Great job Trump; to bad she didn't answer for Wikileaks's .The transgressions against he husband mistresses and how sHE acted towards those ladies !!!
20 | Michael Wolfe | 10155485343041509_10155485422796509 | Something not right with her. Trump brings up violence ( video evidence proves her and Obama had ties too) her campaign help create at his events. 3 minutes later she says he causes violence at his events??? Lady what the hell is wrong with you. It's like Southpark where she can't get out of her own way.
21 | Drew Karanastic | 10155485343041509_10155485437996509 | Donald Trump did a great job. You must have been watching something else. Generate jobs, protect our borders and keep the 2nd Amendment intact. How could anyone support Hilldog? Deleting 33,000 emails after being subpoenaed,  proposing to grant amnesty to tens of thousands of illegal immigrants while having open borders, pay to play, the Clinton Slushfund, the slew of wikileaks scandals all while having a history of political failures.
22 | Allison Howze | 10155485343041509_10155485442281509 | My absolute favorite thing said about tonight's disgrace of a debate was so perfectly put by CNN's Van Jones..."You can't polish a turd." Such a very very sad but true reference to this election. 🤔
23 | Brian DuBose | 10155485343041509_1824319794516788 | He lied about taunting the disabled guy. He lied about his comments about giving Japan and Saudi Arabia nukes. He lied about mocking his sexual assault victims. He said he will keep us in suspense as far as him conceding to HRC if she wins. What is the point of debating him if he's going to lie, deflect and throw tantrums like a toddler?
24 | Caron Sanders Kirk | 10155485343041509_10155485416936509 | She never acknowledged her husband's dirty deeds and her cover ups when asked tonight, she changed the subject about pay for play, admitted one Wikileaks email was true and changed the subject when pressed on the rest of the Wikileaks emails.
25 | Bob Smith | 10155485343041509_1755678598040018 | Donald you're right, we're going to get them all out....out of the Senate and the House, kick all those bad hombres out and turn Congress Blue......and you're incompetence is leading us toward that goal.

We're in the spin room after the debate in Las Vegas. How did the candidates do? Did they live up to expectations? Leave your questions in the comments.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Stephanie Bennett | 10155485373501509_1220817927964875 | Hillary claims to be for women, children, and families....yet doesn't bat an eye at the thought of ripping a child from the mother's womb. Real nice.
2 | Christine DiGirolamo Lomen | 10155485373501509_1858643787697629 | Donald does not act Presidential, but I think he cares about the country more than Hilary. I think voting for Hilary will just be 4 more years of Obama.
3 | Danilo Raul | 10155485373501509_1586744638299097 | What an embarrassment for the republicans... how HOW can you people stand behind such a big man-child thinking he's gonna make the USA "great" again?
4 | Nicole Smith | 10155485373501509_10155485408121509 | Hillary did outstandingly well and won this debate hands down!
5 | Frank Malfettone | 10155485373501509_1429089913786482 | Why does Hillary get a pass for her scandals but we get 24x7 coverage about a claim from 35 years ago on a plane? Funny she was so scared she comes forward 3 weeks before an election.
6 | Amada L. Abrego | 10155485373501509_1598267237134998 | Donald and his family awkwardly end their presidential run by standing awkwardly on stage. A glimpse of the future people...when he losses😂
7 | Sharon Weiden | 10155485373501509_1220822511297750 | Abortion is still murder no matter how you sugar coat it.  Any mother I know if it was her health or baby she choose the baby.
8 | Monica Garcia | 10155485373501509_10155485404731509 | Why I have this feeling to drive up all the way to Las Vegas, smack some on the face and came back with a big smile on my face!!!
9 | Mike Haas | 10155485373501509_1220815324631802 | Kayleigh, you are earning your money, and your clothing allowance. Are you able to sleep at night, after helping to perpetuate such a scam, on the American people?
10 | Michael Veskovich | 10155485373501509_940806996024436 | You Hillary supporters are the most brainwashed people I have ever come across!! And I can guarantee none of you actually watched the debate. She got dominated tonight, just like she did in the last debate. Series 2-1.
11 | Randy J Smith | 10155485373501509_1220816647965003 | CNN is sooo demo sided it's not funny! What happened to neutral journalism??? Very sad you guys can't play it straight down the middle??😣
12 | Gary J. Snow | 10155485373501509_1429089413786532 | Hillary is a liar, a corrupt person.. she moves on to other things whenever he touches on that stuff.. to think she could be our prez yet still be very corrupt really scares me so much!!
13 | Jodie Brown | 10155485373501509_657625084398445 | Donald offended tonight when he called Hillary a nasty women and when he said bad ombreys!!! So offending. He lost my vote!
14 | Mike McGinnis | 10155485373501509_1220816841298317 | Saturday night live is going to have a field day with this one....."Wrong"....its going to be hilarious.....see y'all at the 270 mark the ONLY thing and number that matters now
15 | Joe Pawli | 10155485373501509_630501573795081 | Hillary is just a criminal. But she is in bed with the gnu so she will never be charged for her lies, crimes and murders. Hillary for prison 2017!
16 | Michele Wijangco | 10155485373501509_1598270887134633 | He doesnt even know what amnesty is!!! Fyi there are yrs that would qualify a person. Like being here since 2001 not for ppl who just came today duhhhh
17 | Anthony Massetti | 10155485373501509_705163309635444 | Her foundation only give 5.7 another lie fact check. While your at it Google video of Muslim terrorists training compounds here in America. CNN should be dismantled for treasons.
18 | Celestino De Cicco | 10155485373501509_10155485413006509 | GO HILLARY CLINTON!!!!NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.❤🇺🇸
19 | Nathan Magouirk | 10155485373501509_1598266260468429 | The debate would of been interesting to watch if Gary Johnson was included.Instead you have two puppets bickering at each other over false promises and oversized ego's.
20 | Doug Gibbons | 10155485373501509_630501633795075 | Chris tried to help her but it did not work...did you notice he didn't ask Hillary if she will accept the result and why was she was saying Russia is sabotaging the result,
21 | Stephen Suba | 10155485373501509_1220824824630852 | Ppl are so blind and brainwashed  they will still vote for her even after wiki leaks dumping thousands of emails showing her true nature
22 | Tracee Foster | 10155485373501509_940811606023975 | Hillary wins i cant wait to see her tell doctors to abort babies 4 days away frlm birth because moms life isni n danger. She kind of stuck her foot in her mouth.
23 | Karen Wollman | 10155485373501509_1598275907134131 | I never realized Hillary was the emperor of the world for the last 30 years, solely responsible for every bad thing that ever happened. Hmm.
24 | Chelle Viceroy | 10155485373501509_1250793121648417 | Never thought I would see the most important freedom we have is being rated as a reality show. Im so ashamed of what a laughing stock 2e have become. .
25 | Mark Patrick Lodes | 10155485373501509_595367110671195 | He doesn't respect women more than I do. I've never just grabbed a woman by the pussy because I thought I could get away with it on account of my billions...

Hillary Clinton: "What we want to do is replenish the Social Security trust fund..."

Donald J. Trump: "Such a nasty woman." http://cnn.it/2e8ayM7
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Dianne Noche Atienza | 10155485327736509_10155485341721509 | With the 2 presidential candidates, only Hillary is qualified to be the president. She has the experience(both positive and negative) in governing the country. Everybody learns from their mistakes, including Donald Trump. But Trump's experience and mistakes (when corrected), is not really applicable in governing the country. Trumps have the experience in governing his business, he can use that in managing FOX Network. It will be a shame to the world if he use it in running the USA. #PresidentHillaryClinton
2 | Alex E Andrade | 10155485327736509_10155485344066509 | Secretary Clinton was brilliant, calm, confident and eviscerated him with words and silence. She proved how she will lead our nation, from national security to the economy.Meanwhile, 'I don't know. I don't know Putin. I am not best friends forever with Putin. If we got along with Russia, that'd be great. He doesn't respect this person.' My friends, this three year old wants to be your President.
3 | Javi Melendez | 10155485327736509_10155485343701509 | She is too smart to go against a man with 0 intelligence. I feel so bad that she has to play in the same ballpark as him and people are actually following him. #Imwithher
4 | Irene Shaw | 10155485327736509_10155485342631509 | "Such a nasty women"! -Donald TrumpOkay....excuse me Mr. Trump, who thinks it perfectly okay to violate woman? Who thinks that all Mexicans (and other immigrants) are rapist and killers? You? Ohhhh that's what I thought. You are the nasty one....
5 | Rakibul Islam Shohel | 10155485327736509_10155485342936509 | Hillary you did an amazing job (yet again)! I love how you conduct yourself. You are definitely a classy, intelligent woman and I can't wait to see you elected November 8th! #ImWithHer
6 | John Michael Link | 10155485327736509_10155485345631509 | CNN should be ashamed of themselves, they're no longer a "news" agency but rather a government propaganda machine with an agenda. Much like socialist countries (North Korea) they spew what the government wants you to hear and obey. To strip you of individual thought, to offer a lopsided view which favors the candidate (Dear Leader) of their choice. This is not news, it's not even close to news, it's brainwashing on and endless grind at a scale never seen before on American soil. Make up your "own mind" based on which candidate best represent your vision of America NOTHING more. The rest is simply the Communist News Networks (CNN) formula of tipping the scale. Don't trust or believe them, rest assured they do not have your best interests in mind...they're a TV "Show" for heavens sake. Stop being drones with them at the controls, we are American's, we're not lost and we certainly don't need anyone deciding our fate especially puppets of corruption.
7 | Miles Centrella | 10155485327736509_10155485346381509 | Trump is unraveling. You can tell she got under his skin. He doesn't like women to overpower him and she really put him in his place.
8 | Stephen DeFranco Schuman | 10155485327736509_10155485349466509 | That's not how it went Clinton News Network. She said that about replenishing, AFTER he called her a nasty women. He was responding to a dig she took at him. At least report it right
9 | Patricia Rivera | 10155485327736509_10155485348546509 | He has such a way with words when it comes to degrading and belittling women. As much as he tries to hide it and deny it,  his true colors always come out.... He's A Pig!!!
10 | Christine Eagle | 10155485327736509_10155485346066509 | i knew CNN would focus on anything negative said.   Trump did well in this last debate, but I am sure CNN will pick Hillary as the winner.
11 | Sarah Moore | 10155485327736509_10155485344701509 | What I don't understand is republicans ready to die defending the right to bear arm, but want to interfere on the basic human right. Freedom to make choices and decision as it affects the women. Yet he nags about Saudia Arabia oppressing women
12 | Greg Wanner | 10155485327736509_10155485368461509 | Hillary is a joke and so is CNN. The big story is Trump won't accept if Killary wins. Haha wow standards must really have fallen to become a journalist. Story should be Hillary gave up US government secrets. 4 min from push to launch for nukes. Is it legal for her to release this info?
13 | Ronnie Hatem | 10155485327736509_10155485346631509 | I'm laughing at how pathetic your reporters are. All you care about is trump belittling woman that's all you can bring up? Your biggest headline is that he won't accept the results right away... that is the LEAST IMPORTANT THING. He won the debate.
14 | Virginia Buckler Brown | 10155485327736509_10155485371326509 | I am a woman and yes she is a lying criminal nasty woman. And you CNN are not fair. I will not watch your channel nor believe your lying spin of this election. I just pray that we have enough citizens in this United States that know the truth and vote against a criminal. Only a Clinton could lie to our government and get away with it and still be able to run for president. I pray that we get it right at the polls. God we need you now more than ever.
15 | Joseph Michael Wilcox | 10155485327736509_10155485364581509 | This is poor journalism by CNN. Yes, Mr. Trump interrupted but it wasn't for the comments about replenishing Social Security it was about what Mrs. Clinton said about Mr. Trump and paying taxes.
16 | Joshua Sparks | 10155485327736509_10155485368506509 | Not at all the main point of the Debate- I'm sorry but if you guys are upset about trump smashing this Lying should be prisoner that's sad. Let's change America so the people have the power back! Congratulations Donald🇺🇸#presidentialdebate
17 | Jim Wilson | 10155485327736509_10155485359616509 | Why don't they talk about why Hillary Clinton sidestep all of her emails she deleted and the people she hired to interrupt his rallies
18 | Elaini Young | 10155485327736509_10155485360696509 | Let me just sum up the debate for those who missed it. Hilary had ideas and tried to discuss her plans. Trump just rolled his eyes and called her names.
19 | Janice Phillips Bowers | 10155485327736509_10155485358456509 | Social Security is not an entitlement!!!I paid into it all my working years and what the government did with the money should be a crime
20 | Linda Potvin | 10155485327736509_10155485353436509 | to me MRS. CLINTON won that debate if I was voting it would be her cannot get him at all but i'm not voting and glad very difficult good luck americans got a hard choice in front of you
21 | Kevin Dami | 10155485327736509_10155485351301509 | Under Obama, Median household income last year jumped up 5.2 percent, to $56,516, Census reported. That was the largest percentage increase in 17 years.
22 | Nicole Carter | 10155485327736509_715131415302543 | Every person has a negative and positive about them. I feel Hillary has the experience because she made so many mistakes to learn from. I believe she learned and her narrative has changed eminently. I believe she is the best person for the job!!! Hillary Clinton 2017!!!
23 | Rob Renfrew | 10155485327736509_10155485354471509 | Lol I like how they just put up the part that makes trump look bad instead of the whole clkp, but he is right, the Clinton family since before Bill was president is a corrupt, Nasty family who have run over people to get where they are.
24 | Liz Moore Christian | 10155485327736509_715132225302462 | Only Hillary Clinton was caught lying to congress.Only Hillary Clinton in 1974 was fired from a job (Watergate Committee) for being unethical.Only Hillary Clinton deleted 33,000 emails after she was ordered to hand them over to the Fed.Only Hillary Clinton had that same computer server wiped (BleachBit) clean by professionals.Only Hillary Clinton got the rapist of a teenage girl off on rape charges then laughed about it.Only Hillary Clinton lied to the American people about Benghazi.Only Hillary Clinton lied to the American people about her emails.Only Hillary Clinton lied about being under sniper fire.Only Hillary Clinton lied about lying to the American people.Only Hillary Clinton was involved in "Cash Cow"Only Hillary Clinton has a long list of scandals.Only Hillary Clinton nationally belittled her husband's sexual harassment and rape accusers.Only Hillary Clinton is a career politician.Only Hillary Clinton will not release her speeches to Goldman Sachs and other banks.Only Hillary Clinton is tied to Monsanto.Only Hillary Clinton was labeled " Extremely careless " about national security by the FBI !Only Hillary Clinton said she will raise taxes on the middle class.Only Hillary Clinton benefited from the DNC rigging an election !Only Hillary Clinton had to return stolen items from the White House.Only Hillary Clinton said the Benghazi victims parents where lying.Only Hillary Clinton wants you to vote for her based on her gender.Only Hillary Clinton has no real accomplishments after a lifetime in politics.Only Hillary Clinton has never created any jobs.Only Hillary Clinton has been investigated by the FBI and found to have put national security at risk.Only Hillary Clinton has had two or more movies and several documentaries made about her questionable ethics and integrityOnly Hillary Clinton was called "Broomstick one" by the Secret ServiceOnly Hillary Clinton made congress and others spend millions and millions of tax dollars having hearings and investigating her to find that she lied, that would not have been spent if she would of simply told the truth in the first place ! Fact - all facts !Only Hillary Clinton regularly cussed out and belittled her Secret Service detail.Only Hillary Clinton
25 | Bill Ricard | 10155485327736509_10155485380836509 | My thoughts on tonight's debate:First and foremost I think that Chris Wallace did an excellent job as the moderator. He was fair to both candidates and didn't show any bias towards one candidate. SC held her own and seems like she's running out the clock. She sidestepped several questions about wikileaks, emails and the Clinton Foundation. DJT, held his own. However, still has certain trigger points that set him off, like any discussions about loans from his Dad. He did land several punches with the #wikileaks matter...All in all, I would say DJT won this debate on points. Next up Election day. May God bless both of these individuals for their willingness to serve as the next President of the United States. Godspeed to us all.

1 | Bobby Tang | 10155485286116509_10155485307636509 | Who says Trump is self-centered? I think Trump is generous. He just gave Hillary Clinton the title POTUS
2 | A Ma Tendance | 10155485286116509_10155485310446509 | Hillary Clinton president of United States 2016...Drump is so disrespectful can't stand him anymore. Hope he will go away for ever. Amen!
3 | Nicholas Williams | 10155485286116509_10155485329956509 | I used to hate Trump but from 8 years Ive been searching and reading about his work and policies & building walls, grabbing pussy & after all these years i realizeI STILL HATE TRUMP 😂😂😂😂😂
4 | Elvis Chima | 10155485286116509_10155485307621509 | Hillary's #debatenight closing statement, "we need everybody." Does that include the deplorables, unredeemables and the basement dwellers?
5 | Mateo Horhay | 10155485286116509_10155485309256509 | Before the comments get too nasty. Here is a positive one. I hope the remainder of your week is a great one. God bless you. God bless everyone. God bless America!
6 | Ruth Whittington Allen | 10155485286116509_10155485308791509 | killery is a smooth tongued political speaker....can make any lie sound good....Trump isn't a politician,but he will speak for the people in his stumbling way !...lets hope he NEVER talks like the establishment politician....
7 | Steve Harper | 10155485286116509_10155485316301509 | Hillary has NO American flag 🇺🇸 on her kimono pants suit for the third debate in a row . How disgusting and disrespectful to the men and women that have given their lives for that flag !!!!!
8 | Nely Corpuz Ratliff | 10155485286116509_10155485313111509 | Killary's political record is built from greed, stained with blood and covered with a whitewash of lies and conveniently fake excuses of stupidity whenever; the lies begin to weaken in a rain of truth. Where is her admission or her apology?
9 | Ayesha Taylor | 10155485286116509_595730170614160 | I am a #collegeeducated #independent #woman and I was disappointed with Hillary Clinton tonight. I really could not believe that Hillary brought Russia into this debate claiming espionage to turn the heat away from her of the underlying open border question. I am so disappointed she felt the need to sink to that level.
10 | Adam Fernando | 10155485286116509_10155485314351509 | Biased CNN/ABC/NBC news be like:- Debate Fact Check -Mr. Trump explained that we gave Iran $1.7 billion dollars to settle an arms deal upon the release of four detainee's earlier this year. He said the $1.7 billion was in cash bundles as big as the debate stage.This is false. It was slightly smaller than the debate stage.
11 | Raja Wahid | 10155485286116509_10155485309871509 | How to interpret constitution = Hillary won & Trump was confused and stuck in his own logicsSecond amendment = Hillary wonIssue of  women right to abortion = Hillary won & Trump tried to avoid the question with blah blah #womb #NinthMonthIssue of immigration = Trump still want the wall and says drugs are coming and want the immigrants out & Hillary not in flavour of deportation of 15 million ppl but in favour of boarder security and deportation of violent pplDo you condemn the interference of Russians = Tumps was yes and again saying don't know Putin & Hillary said it's been reported by 17 state agencies that Russia is meddling the election process but the results is 60% trump and 40% HillaryTaxation system and economy = Hillary, minimum wage, equal wage, tuition free college and new jobs and big corporations pay more taxes and TRUMP didn't responded the question but stuck with NATO and Saudi Arabia and other alleys to pay for security #HillaryWonGroping women by Trump and issues of Clinton = trump said all the women are paid characters by Hillary campaign and Hillary quoted all the instances and exposed his nasty character of groping women #HillaryWonClinton foundation = 11 million are the beneficiary Hillary responded & added that CF has the highest rating and raised 30 million for Haitians #HillaryWonElection is rigged = Trump said that he will decide on Nov 09 whether to accept the results or not and further added that media is corrupt and it makes the election rigged. Hillary said that trump don't trust either FBI, RNC, Judges etc and it's his mindset #HillaryWonIraq and ISIS, boots on the ground?= Hillary said that we will support Iraqi army and don't want boots on the ground but will do arial attacks on ISIS and will look for political solution. Trump still wants the element of surprise in his attack on enemy which is illogical and will result in collateral damage #HillaryWonSyria and Aleppo = Trump added Syrian refugees are troggen horses however, Hillary said that we should go for political solution and added won't stop refugees and will work with Muslim communities!! #HillaryWonNational debt = Trump said will increase GDP growth increased by 5 to 6% which seems to be unrealistic however, Hillary said that she will add nothing to national debt and added will make the big corporations to pay more tax #HillaryWon
12 | Gordon Aram | 10155485286116509_10155485330996509 | Hey CNN why are you not reporting on the new videos that show the DNC is lying? They admit to causing riots at the rallies, yet you refuse to report on this. We have video proof the election is getting rigged. Why won't you pick this story up? Are you afraid of Killary?
13 | Pall Hathwell | 10155485286116509_10155485328146509 | Coming next week: wiki leaks shocks the world by exposing the lunch order that the Clinton Campaign did not want you to see. Does Hillary want turkey or roast beef? Only Julian Assange knows the truth.😜
14 | Helen Johnson | 10155485286116509_595735040613673 | Hillary Clinton is so much more informed and confident than Donald Trump. Not to mention that he deliberatedly invitéd and placed people on the front row to make her feel uneasy and lose her focus. She refused to stoop to his level. Great Job, Hillary Clinton!!!!
15 | Dianne Noche Atienza | 10155485286116509_10155485319811509 | With the 2 presidential candidates, only Hillary is qualified to be the president. She has the experience(both positive and negative) in governing the country. Everybody learns from their mistakes, including Donald Trump. But Trump's experience and mistakes (when corrected), is not really applicable in governing the country. Trumps have the experience in governing his business, he can use that in managing FOX Network. It will be a shame to the world if he use it in running the USA. #PresidentHillaryClinton
16 | Kierra Kiki Cunningham | 10155485286116509_10155485314006509 | I just cant believe people take Trump seriously...and notice how he doesnt ever interact with the PEOPLE after the debates, he stays with his little group. He's not a people person, so how could I trust him to do good for the American people? I cant.
17 | Lisa Woodall | 10155485286116509_10155485335901509 | All CNN reporters are harping on, is that Trump said he wanted to keep us in suspense when asked if he would accept the results gracefully? HAVE YOU PEOPLE at CNN forgotten that you recently did an interview with the current resident of the White House, who said if Trump was elected he would barricade himself in there!!!
18 | Liz Moore Christian | 10155485286116509_595737087280135 | Only Hillary Clinton was caught lying to congress.Only Hillary Clinton in 1974 was fired from a job (Watergate Committee) for being unethical.Only Hillary Clinton deleted 33,000 emails after she was ordered to hand them over to the Fed.Only Hillary Clinton had that same computer server wiped (BleachBit) clean by professionals.Only Hillary Clinton got the rapist of a teenage girl off on rape charges then laughed about it.Only Hillary Clinton lied to the American people about Benghazi.Only Hillary Clinton lied to the American people about her emails.Only Hillary Clinton lied about being under sniper fire.Only Hillary Clinton lied about lying to the American people.Only Hillary Clinton was involved in "Cash Cow"Only Hillary Clinton has a long list of scandals.Only Hillary Clinton nationally belittled her husband's sexual harassment and rape accusers.Only Hillary Clinton is a career politician.Only Hillary Clinton will not release her speeches to Goldman Sachs and other banks.Only Hillary Clinton is tied to Monsanto.Only Hillary Clinton was labeled " Extremely careless " about national security by the FBI !Only Hillary Clinton said she will raise taxes on the middle class.Only Hillary Clinton benefited from the DNC rigging an election !Only Hillary Clinton had to return stolen items from the White House.Only Hillary Clinton said the Benghazi victims parents where lying.Only Hillary Clinton wants you to vote for her based on her gender.Only Hillary Clinton has no real accomplishments after a lifetime in politics.Only Hillary Clinton has never created any jobs.Only Hillary Clinton has been investigated by the FBI and found to have put national security at risk.Only Hillary Clinton has had two or more movies and several documentaries made about her questionable ethics and integrityOnly Hillary Clinton was called "Broomstick one" by the Secret ServiceOnly Hillary Clinton made congress and others spend millions and millions of tax dollars having hearings and investigating her to find that she lied, that would not have been spent if she would of simply told the truth in the first place ! Fact - all facts !Only Hillary Clinton regularly cussed out and belittled her Secret Service detail.Only Hillary Clinton
19 | John Staggs | 10155485286116509_10155485320756509 | I think Hillary is an evil woman I think she's dishes I think she's a liar I think that she is responsible for a lot of the mess this country is Sam and I do not like her...I don't particularly like trump but I will vote for him and as far as him saying she is a nasty woman she is a nasty woman. And I don't think Trump should have to accept the outcome of the election if there is any possibility that there it was a fraud are anything comes concerned in that aspect it could be Rick I think that Obama had it ready I wouldn't put anything past that Democratic Party at this point.
20 | Wendy Carr Cope | 10155485286116509_1141229525962172 | Clinton campaign caught on tape plotting violence at a Trump rally, orchestrated by a man who visited Barack Obama over 30 times at the white house.....where is the outrage?????
21 | Joel Miller | 10155485286116509_1141240969294361 | 4 million dead people are registered to vote this year. Some of them having deaths dating back to the 1940s. As a sane American citizen, I agree with Donald Trump when he says he will wait to see what happens before he concedes if he loses. That is all
22 | Aaron Nelson | 10155485286116509_1133353963438090 | Trump has no policies or plans in place he was ask a simple question answer the question. You keep blaming everything on Obama & Hillary Clinton what is your solution then we would like to know. Stop rambling on about nothing or using the same attack lines. Just answer the questions.
23 | Chris Carbone | 10155485286116509_595734977280346 | Almost everyone I know is voting Trump. Democrats, republicans and independents. Im from one of the most democratic states in the country. I see 0 clinton/kaine signs anywhere. Literally 0. All I see is Trump/Pence. If that doesnt tell you something in democratic ny where Hillary was a senator. Nothing will.
24 | Phaedra James | 10155485286116509_10155485334921509 | Donald will accept the results of a FAIR election. He's simply saying that he'll wait to see if there is some scandalous election day vote tampering. We don't know if that's going to happen. No one wants it to happen. But, what if there is some controversy?? He could have said it better but that's  the real point of what he meant.
25 | Carol Walker | 10155485286116509_10155485338856509 | Hillary won this debate again. Trump couldn't show leadership again. He didn't answer a full question, just like his campaign manager can't! Hillary Clinton 2016💯

1 | Jay De | 10155485280656509_10155485288066509 | H. Clinton was not my preferred Democratic candidate in either 2008 or 2016, but I've come to admire her for even keeping a calm demeanor debating this 3rd grader. He constantly interrupts & Bigly pisses me off. Wtf is bigly😩
2 | Marco Morales | 10155485280656509_10155485287011509 | LADIES AND GENTLEMEN ..IT'S OVER!!!....Our next president will be .....HILLARY CLINTON!!🇺🇸🎉🇺🇸🎉🎈
3 | Jeff Shaw | 10155485280656509_10155485293931509 | I don't really care if he concedes. He can pretend he is president as long as he returns to his Manhattan penthouse and never comes out again.
4 | Joey Brito | 10155485280656509_10155485287911509 | I like suspense in my movies, not in the decision making of a potential President.
5 | CJ Mehus | 10155485280656509_10155485287446509 | Donald doesn't want to be president, he's doing everything he can to lose, he's insulting and embarrassing you! You were ridiculous enough to go along with him and he wants out- back to his jet, golf courses and club houses where he'll never see any of you again.
6 | Mateo Horhay | 10155485280656509_10155485288491509 | Before the comments get too nasty. Here is a positive one. I hope the remainder of your week is a great one. God bless you. God bless everyone. God bless America!
7 | Damian Ramirez | 10155485280656509_10155485293836509 | Hillary is mopping the floor with Donalds mop of a head. Every trump enthusiast is as ignorant and a Imbecile as he is. Vote ppl! because the deplorables  will.
8 | Joe Ranger | 10155485280656509_10155485296046509 | And the Emmy Award for best supporting actor goes to Donald J. Trump for his debate night imitation of Alec Baldwin (as Trump) on Saturday Night Live. If Trump doesn't win the Emmy, it's rigged! Rigged! ;-)
9 | Carol Walker | 10155485280656509_10155485298276509 | Donald Trump can't even keep a steady hand on a debate with his breathing and temperament! Hillary Clinton has shown over and over she has a steady hand
10 | Scott Ballard | 10155485280656509_10155485305956509 | For those who still have not figured it out, as is evident from all of her answers, when HILLARY CLINTON says WE, she means the GOVERNMENT.   She is a SOCIALIST !!!!!!
11 | Riz Preena | 10155485280656509_10155485328051509 | Hillary Clinton won this, hands down. Americans are proud of you Madam Secretary, and we will be so proud to call you Madam President.
12 | Shirley Duggan | 10155485280656509_10155485305591509 | I am sorry he is just pathetic his answer why should I make him my president not one thing he said would Ever Make Me Want To Vote For Him Ever 🙄 To say he would not accept the election results and everything is rigged when he looses is the biggest issue of ALL !  He is a complete disgrace to Democracy !!
13 | Nancy Milewski | 10155485280656509_665013893658223 | Well, the Trumps proved they lie for a living, Melania's interview with Anderson Cooper she said "Donald apologized to me" for his nasty comments, then Donald said "i didn't even apologize to my wife because I didn't do anything wrong". WTF?
14 | Joel Miller | 10155485280656509_695265613957911 | 4 million dead people are registered to vote this year. Some of them having deaths dating back to the 1940s.

15 | Marilyn Dent | 10155485280656509_686124244879420 | I would not give them an answer either, democrats have always cheated. Hillary Clinton is one of the most corrupt people that ever walked in the world. If it weren't for a corrupt system, she would be in jail.
16 | Lisa Hughes Hickman | 10155485280656509_10155485291686509 | How about something on Hillary, like the rally violence she caused it or wikileaks?! Oh wait I forget it's Clintons network
17 | Cecily Bright | 10155485280656509_10155485325556509 | This man is a danger to our democracy and to the rule of law. He's going to encourage violence when he loses, something that has never happened in this country. Just because he isn't getting his way, he's going to toss out the Constitution in favor of violence.
18 | Amanda Waller | 10155485280656509_10155485310461509 | I doubt he will, but the RNC won't back him and I doubt he will get anywhere. I just hope we don't see any violence as a result of the outcome. This election has brought out the worst in a lot of people, and I'm a little nervous about what to expect from some of them.
19 | Kayla Cooper | 10155485280656509_665014040324875 | This is scary for all sides, no one should support this idea. This is what separates us from dictatorships. If you support the idea of a "civil war" in response to election results you don't like you are no better than a domestic terrorist.
20 | Brad Block | 10155485280656509_10155485310096509 | That is dangerous. He already has some of his supporters calling for armed insurrection if Clinton is elected. He needs to be very mindful of his words.
21 | Jeff Geller | 10155485280656509_695258037292002 | These republicans have their heads up their a**es. Not very Presidential to say he will keep us in suspense as to whether or not he will accept the results. He is a disgrace to all Americans. He must have used the word "disaster" 25 times when referring to this country. If he is so anti-American, why doesn't he just pack up his bags and move to one of the countries that his factories are in.
22 | James Stoughton | 10155485280656509_665019830324296 | CNN won't say anything about her emails being deleted, but Trump is being attacked by the media. Hilary is a criminal and if you for vote her, your condoning her criminal behavior. I won't have a guilty concience, when country goes to hell. I am registered Democrat and I will not vote for her.
23 | Amos Fagbeyiro | 10155485280656509_10155485305301509 | Trump is a national disgrace. How can you be a law and order candidate when you was on the hot mic describing how you have sexually assaulted women
24 | Ij Nolue | 10155485280656509_665017303657882 | Lol...is anyone watching FOX news now? Kellyann Conway says that Trump won the debate and will accept the winner of the election. Did this lady watch the debate at all? It's got to be difficult to follow and clean up after your foolish Boss. I feel for you Kellyann. Trump lost in the worst possible way!!!!!! Trump, Hillary is grabbing your p×××y in the worst possible way! I suppose you're used to shallow women.....this one grabbed you and screwd you the hell-out!!!! #buildawallaroundTrump!
25 | Andrew Long | 10155485280656509_695255537292252 | Its basically to say if i win ill be happy if i lose its rigged. Basically kids mentality. When Hillary wins he will not let her go it'll be worse than Obama in the bither fiasco. Hilary O'Reilly said if she loses she will still continue to work for the country and improve it if,   if he loses fairly will he do the same. Will he help fix the tax system since he's an expert can will he bring back more job with his factories overseas are just go back to looking after himself

2 | Mike Moss | 10155485187741509_10155485198826509 | Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States of America, Hillary Clinton. 👑
3 | Marcus Thomas | 10155485187741509_10155485198656509 | Trump is a loser as a business man. He filed bankruptcy 4 times leaving his vendors and employees holding the bag. Trump couldn't run a lemonade stand let alone country. People who are supporting Trump are the people you see get burned by blowhards and liars on shows like American Greed etc.
4 | Jay Miller | 10155485187741509_10155485198096509 | This is nothing but a victory lap for Hillary. Bye-bye Donald.

7 | Nafissatou Naf-naf Kingui | 10155485187741509_10155485207096509 | One thing's for sure: Trump doesn't understand and cannot discuss the Second Amendment or the Heller case. He deflects every question and just answers in the most general terms.
8 | April E Stout | 10155485187741509_10155485213406509 | Hillary wants to pass gun laws to protect the lives of toddlers but has no problem ripping them apart in the womb. She's a FN idiot
9 | Wendy Sumrall | 10155485187741509_10155485223751509 | I can only imagine how thrilled the next President of the United States must be that this is the last time she has to debate with Toddler Trump!! I know I'm beyond ready to give Hillary my vote!
10 | Kennedy Alajemba | 10155485187741509_10155485209296509 | If Trump thinks he can intimidate Hillary, he's dead wrong. He's a bully and known as such. He's so ignorant. Again, why does Chris Wallace keep cutting her off when she talks?
11 | Selman Selman | 10155485187741509_10155485214601509 | Why don't CNN report when Trump asked Hillary about the 33000 emails deleted off her servers after receiving court order and a 4 star general went to jail for lying to the FBI, and she totally ignored the question and went on talking about women.
12 | Stephen Edward | 10155485187741509_10155485204801509 | "Nobody has more respect for women than I do." Donald TrumpLMAO

15 | Craig Sanders | 10155485187741509_10155485200826509 | He just accused Hillary of lying. But says nobody has more respect for women than me. LOL

17 | Luis Diaz Cruz | 10155485187741509_10155485230416509 | A disaster, everything is a disaster, he is not stalking, tonight he is sticking to the podium, still sniffling, a disaster, if the election is rigged, why is he wasting his time participating in this debate? A total disaster.. If you ask me It is a disaster.Trumpie looks like a tired defeated candidate, Hillary looks presidential. What a disaster.
18 | Shirley Duggan | 10155485187741509_1459840647365734 | I cannot believe this man is representing the Republican Party .. He is the most despicable human being .. I have never heard anyone trying to get elected President of the United States  by attacking his opponent and having no facts on his plan, unable to answer any question on foreign affairs and yet people see him as a possible candidate !!! Are you kidding me people really he is a disgrace ..
19 | Shelby Kendall Henderson | 10155485187741509_10155485233531509 | The idiot says Hillary should not be allowed to run for president well the big dummy should not have either because he has a court case pending for Dec. on the rape of a 13 year old. I think that should have automatically disqualified him from the beginning.
20 | Betty Matos | 10155485187741509_1329360470431046 | Mr. Narrator please again you asked Mr. Trump if he would send troops back into Iraq?? He said many things but I did not hear a response to the question!! Can we please get a direct response to a question!!
21 | Kevin Harris | 10155485187741509_10155485228341509 | Trumps entitled to those tax breaks.... Sounds like Trump has entitlement issues that conservatives demonize poor Americans for having. Also building a billion dollar empire is better than helping children. Anyways my point is if Donald Trump thinks his tax break is a OK because the law allows him to do so the welfare and any other social benefit is a OK because the law allows it.
22 | Andrew Pete Matipa | 10155485187741509_10155485217396509 | This debate is centered on personal attacks instead of addresing real issues.Its a shame that american are going to vote based on who attacked or who insulted the other in a matured
23 | Kathy Tam | 10155485187741509_10155485227901509 | How does Hillary know that "Millions of undocumented immigrants pays taxes"? THEY ARE UNDOCUMENTED!! Wouldn't paying taxes make them documented and easy to find for deportation? That's not incentive to pay taxes.
24 | Gabriela Arroyo Gerala | 10155485187741509_1745362309057079 | OMGGG at first i used to get really angry, now he really just makes me laugh, like actually laugh out loud, he makes me feel like i'm watching a sketch from SNL, like he can't be real. Poor orange piece of garbage.
25 | Gabor K Kallai | 10155485187741509_10155485219686509 | U guys r so dumb it's unbelievable! They lead you by your nose! I don't say that trump is good but if Hillary wins u better prepare for war, but this one will be with nukes  and is going to be ugly where millions of Americans Will die. Do you want that ?? If yes then go ahead and vote for Hillary!Senior citizens!!  Asking you, do you want to loose your  kids, grand kids in a battle where they should not be at the first place! They are just used and sacrificed by the government for its own dirty cause to please the elite!

2 | Brandon Horan | 10155485093436509_10155485104531509 | If there is anybody who thinks Trump has the temperament to handle the Presidency, that person does not have the judgment to be a voter.
3 | Gary Downing | 10155485093436509_10155485107151509 | Trump has not changed what he says. Its always the same words and he is always attacking Hillary. He can't speak with facts and he can't keep his mouth shut while the other person is speaking. He is rude and disrespectful .
4 | Jared Bodily | 10155485093436509_10155485109951509 | He is a freaking dumba** he says he wants to kick out immigrants, but then goes on to say Obama, who is not running, is a bad guy for kicking out immigrants? LMFAO he has no game.

8 | Jon Andrew | 10155485093436509_10155485113381509 | CNN takes the one sentence with a Spanish word and makes it seem as if trump is racist by saying the mere word. You are pathetic CNN.
9 | Danielle Weaver-Teising | 10155485093436509_1166033720144388 | CNN, you are so biased. I have actually contacted my cable company to remove you from my channel line up. And I'm not pro Trump or Hillary. But your bias is absolutely disgusting and wrong at every level. #cnn #reportsbiasnotnews
10 | Will Wallace | 10155485093436509_10155485106096509 | Hillary called Trump a "puppet" for Putin. She is molly whopping Trump.
11 | Lori Ackerman | 10155485093436509_10155485142376509 | Truth... CNN really, that is what you take out of this and ise as your tag line.. knock the man on telling the facts, the truth, he is a straight shooter, tell it like it is and it should be respected rather than mocked.  Oh I am sorry CNN is bias on Killary..
12 | Stacey Toole | 10155485093436509_10155485115596509 | Did Hillary Clinton actually say "the federal government shouldn't be stepping in" and "government has no business?" I'm sorry, I must be hearing voices, or under the influence of hallucinogenic mushrooms......#HillarytheComedian
13 | Dan N Angie Pierce | 10155485093436509_10155485136196509 | Hillary says she doesn't accept guns where toddlers can get them and kill but she supports killing a baby in the womb at 9monthsTotal contradiction
14 | Noni Lynch | 10155485093436509_10155485102531509 | If we build a wall how will you get your cocaine DonaldTrump *sniff sniff*
15 | April Wier | 10155485093436509_1166036743477419 | Hillary is delusional. There are only so many people in the top1% ....at what point will their tax dollars run out and the middle class will be burdened with the unbelievable amount debt associated with social programs Hillary supports and will create? People need to know that the government is not responsible for providing opportunities.  The government must get out of the way of the people and the economy will grow.
16 | Debbie Fussell Lewing | 10155485093436509_10155485115066509 | 👍🏻🇱🇷 Trump!  Hillary has NO immigration plan at all!

17 | Heather Cawthra | 10155485093436509_1166034506810976 | When I read the comments on this post I have no hope for humanity 😐 If you believe mainstream media and you can't do any research and critical thinking of your own, you are the problem with America.
18 | Pat Cunningham | 10155485093436509_1166037460144014 | I am so glad I stayed up to see the final debate. Hilary is on fire tonight! She looks so Presidential. Donald Trump seems extra defensive & fidgety.  And, please stop touching the microphone. Unfortunately, we can all hear you.
19 | Steve Walton | 10155485093436509_10155485108126509 | Donald J Trump will be the next POTUS... he is showing the world tonight the kind of leader we need for this country!!! Trump/Pence 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
20 | Gary Downing | 10155485093436509_10155485112251509 | Ask Trump how many people he will deport. Ask him if he believes in martial law for this nation. Ask him if has brought his tax records. Ask him how he has helped working people by cutting wages and benefits. Tell him his list of military so called important people mean absolutely nothing compared to what is supporting Hillary.
21 | Zach Kerman | 10155485093436509_10155485101401509 | Trump should offer to help pardon Julian Assange right now and recognize him for the brave hero that he is. Help him further expose Hillary, her corrupt family and establishment and deliver justice. If I disappear after posting this, you know why^ #HillaryForPrison
22 | Tanya Doyle | 10155485093436509_10155485137326509 | Hillary is scary warmonger, and she is blaming Russia and Putin, lol, without any proof, what a disaster she is, voting for this liar would be the road to ww3
23 | Chris Allen | 10155485093436509_10155485136851509 | I have a sister-in-law that works at a doctors office. Her doctor tells her he would like to open 10 more offices in the next five years. He said he has to wait to find out who will be president, if Hillary is president he will not be able to afford to open those offices because of taxes.
24 | Mike Junk | 10155485093436509_1166039796810447 | What is so wrong with securing our borders?  People from all over the world that want to harm us use the southern border to enter our country. I get not all people coming here are bad but we need to do something to stop the ones that are.
25 | Caroline Reynolds | 10155485093436509_1318959208136709 | Omg. Donald Trump lacks substance. How can someone with any level of intelligence, think this guy can lead a country. We are not taking about construction and real estate now guys !!! Smh

Donald J. Trump on abortion at final #debate: "In the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth." http://cnn.it/2evwqiP
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Casey Koss-Dwight | 10155485083486509_10155485091971509 | No medical professional would ever do an abortion in the 9th month. The would do a C-section if the mother's life was in danger.
2 | John Bowers | 10155485083486509_10155485088146509 | Sounds like trump has been snorting some of that Mexican cocaine
3 | David McMillan | 10155485083486509_10155485088821509 | Oh my God, the Don is as calm as I have ever seen him. If he keeps this together, he may........who I'm I kidding, meltdown is surely on the way.
4 | Haley Blair | 10155485083486509_10155485090976509 | Neither the Government or anyone else should have a say in what I do with MY BODY and MY DECISIONS!!!! I pay my taxes, vote, work full time and try to be the best citizen I can be. We all have rights and those rights should be protected.
5 | Brandi Gonzales | 10155485083486509_10155485091906509 | What? You guys are ridiculous. For anyone not watching the debate this was taken out of context. CNN that is a desperate move. Are you scared of Trump or is Hillary threatening you?
6 | Sharon Clarke | 10155485083486509_10155485092656509 | That statement is so ridiculous. Nothing like that happens, at all, in this country. Late term abortions are performed because someone is about to die, mother or baby, and not because of convenience.
7 | Stephanie Long | 10155485083486509_10155485111161509 | Are you kidding me CNN? I'm not a Donald J. Trump supporter at all, but that is taken gravely out of context. He wasn't advocating that. He was talking about Hillary supporting partial birth abortion. You make it sound like he is supporting that.
8 | Jeff A. Johnson | 10155485083486509_10155485095396509 | Trump showing more concepts he has no clue on : abortion, and basic women's anatomy beyond their p*$$*.One concept he has down cold : pandering.
9 | Geoff Gentel | 10155485083486509_10155485089816509 | I think it's safe to say that if Trump was looking to have some sort of turnaround for his disaster of a campaign that tonight was not the night that it was going to happen.
10 | Anu Deol | 10155485083486509_10155485097946509 | He is disgusting & the way he said rip the baby out over & over is absolutely disrespectful to the mothers that unfortunately had to make that difficult decision..
11 | González Sandy | 10155485083486509_10155485132736509 | Abortion is illegal after viability, people. That would be murder by law. There is no such thing as abortion in the 9th month. That's called birth. By C-section. Unbelievable.
12 | Kyle Kelly | 10155485083486509_10155485135846509 | They don't abort healthy babies in the 9th month! Omg, people. Educate yourselves! If the mother's life is at risk, they will deliver the baby. If the baby is dying(with no hope for survival) or died in utero, they do a d&c.
13 | Selena Cousin | 10155485083486509_10155485133701509 | any educated person knows that no medical professional would "rip a baby from the womb" in the ninth month. i don't care if you are pro-life or pro-choice, that is simply ridiculous.
14 | Joshua Feuerstein | 10155485083486509_10155485092891509 | I'm with THE UNBORN HER!!!!!
15 | Nash Harris | 10155485083486509_10155485115166509 | Trump is repeating what She said. Way to blow this out of context CNN. Watch the debate- not just what they post as the article title.
16 | Beth MacLean | 10155485083486509_10155485110146509 | He is so ignorant and crude when it comes to anything to do with women. Get in touch buddy, this isn't the good ol' boys network.
17 | Virginia Kavanagh Drew | 10155485083486509_10155485121436509 | Fact check Donald people don't have abortions in the ninth month of pregnancy, absolute nonsense talk.  Fact check number two New Hampshire is not even close to "our southern border where heroin is pouring into the US. So why did he mention that people in New Hampshire are so concerned about "immigration" and then spout this foolishness. Just for a second I thought he was going to build a wall on the Canadian border.
18 | BrianandTracy Lemke | 10155485083486509_10155485097451509 | Trump blew it. Partial birth abortion means JUST WHAT IT SAYS! It means the baby is PARTIALLY delivered, then the doctor cuts open the baby's neck, sucks out the babies brain to render the baby dead and lifeless, then disposes the babies body like garbage. Sorry folks, but that is MURDER! And Clinton supports it!
19 | Nicole Smith | 10155485083486509_10155485096931509 | I think Trump lacks to comprehend what Hillary was even saying. It's a woman's right to do what she does with her body not yours Trump or the government!
20 | Dana Palos | 10155485083486509_10155485108201509 | I've lost a lot of respect for CNN. I thought their job was to report the news? Since when did news stations become biased? Oh since they started getting paid to report opinions rather than facts!
21 | Ingrid Grid | 10155485083486509_10155485137481509 | At 9 months would that even be considered an abortion? Wouldn't that be a live birth and a baby delivered? Who gets off on his dumb crap? this from a moron who goes around grabbing women
22 | Sarah Ann | 10155485083486509_1859266827639388 | Read up people. Only 4 doctors in the US perform late term abortions and it's NOT due to a woman changing her mind or convenience.
23 | Caprice Laurice | 10155485083486509_10155485105516509 | So he wants to take away women's rights is he crazy he will definitely not win he just sealed his fate. More women in this country then men he lost bye bye loser. Lots of you will be having babies and lots of young girls will be having kids and college girls. He's sick.
24 | Keosha Gaines | 10155485083486509_1859273384305399 | UmmmmIt's against the law to "rip a baby out the womb at nine months"... So what the hell is he talking about?! 😳But you dumb, ignorant people have chosen this bafoon as a candidate. SHAME ON YOU!
25 | Mina Zarnegin | 10155485083486509_1634764146823135 | Ignorant , ignorant, unintelligent man. If he'd spent a few minutes doing a simple online search or talking to a healthcare professional, he'd find that this is far from the truth.

One supporter described Philippines President Duterte’s first 100 days as "nothing short of awesome" while another backed the president for his sincerity.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Othomile Maruping | 10155484979806509_10155485091086509 | these debates keep destroying Donald.even more because he just can never beat Hillary in a debate, she is way too articulate and better prepared , even where he probably could have a point but Hillary is just too good
2 | Alexander Jumong Carbonel | 10155484979806509_10155485011546509 | americans just come to the phil. for sex , for their own selfish interests.....we are glad if u all will not come in our country....duterte's words are the real words of masses
3 | Stephanie Casey-Aragon | 10155484979806509_10155485018521509 | As a RN working for the VA and budget constraints in discussions in every meeting, and more budget cuts to come, how will our next administration meet our veterans needs, as well as keep it financialy viable for healthcare personnel to stay and serve our veterans?
4 | Garry James | 10155484979806509_10155485047296509 | Better agree with him, or find out you mysteriously became a drug dealer too. With drugs on your person, or in your car, or home. That's how this war on drugs, is cleverly used to hold onto power.
5 | Mike Barnhill | 10155484979806509_10155485726661509 | Of course, had MacArthur not kicked out the Japanese, the Philippines would never be able to elect this man. America certainly isn't perfect...Oh, and the Spanish? Whatever.
6 | Doug Pauly | 10155484979806509_10155485211686509 | But as always, The Phillipijnes are asking the USA to protect them from Red China's aggression. Isn't that always the case?
7 | Sarah Stiegel | 10155484979806509_10155485721521509 | 8 Generations ago my direct relative, Col. Christopher Truby risked his life fighting the British in the American Revolution.  Today, nearly 240+ years later I find myself saddened by the state of our great country.  I have always felt pride being an American, a patriot, however at this time I'm almost embarrassed and most definitely saddened.  Our country has regressed 270+ years to a state where we need to overthrow our governing body.  Don't you remember learning in American history "no taxation without representation".?  Don't you remember the pride you felt learning how our founding fathers drafted such amazing documents like the Declaration of Independence and most importantly the Constitution of the United States?  Our fore-fathers died for those documents, those beliefs.  Now today 270+ years later our basic rights that we fought for are at stake and it sickens me to see how many people are willing to throw it all away.  This election isn't about taxes, immigration, or abortion, this election is about our basic American rights.  We are at risk of losing our guaranteed rights thanks to a corrupt woman and her ulterior motives.  I'm voting for America, for our founding fathers, for our Bill of Rights, for our Freedoms, for the best country in the world.  This isn't about race/ethnicity this is about US, as Americans, standing up for US, the greatest nation of the modern world.  We need to bring back unity, we need to be proud Americans.  It's time to stand up, with our right hand over our heart and proudly state "one God, indivisible, in liberty and justice for ALL".  Protect our America, our freedom.  Vote TRUMP 2016
8 | Jonah Mainar Abbu | 10155484979806509_10155485061031509 | im one of the 16m filipino who voted duterte..i supported him coz we realy wanted changes...come visit the philippines so that u too caan feel the real change...less crimes no corruptions and feel secured..we love our president!! just shut u...
9 | Danino Domingo | 10155484979806509_10155485422631509 | Seriously, I am reading some comments here as if they know everything. Manila is much peaceful that it was decades ago. They are not killing drug addicts and pushers for no reason. Those thugs got their guns and they have fought back so there, they were killed. There are killings made by vigilantes but they should not blame our president with those killings. As a matter of fact, the administration is actually conducting an investigation which is on-going. Well I cannot make people understand what their minds cannot grasp so....By the way, Is it wrong if the president will have a peaceful treaty with China wherein both countries are part of Asia? It is like two neighbours making peace with each other for harmonious relationship.
10 | Andrew Heffelfinger | 10155484979806509_10155484997631509 | Dirty as hell and Obama isn't arming the drug addicts. But in Syria where Russia has interests.... "Oh arm the local thugs there and displace millions"
11 | John C Holben | 10155484979806509_10155485019991509 | you better wake up real soon. In less than 3 weeks we could have open borders, which means rampant terrorist attacks even at your children's school's. You'll have a government that controls everything you do. You'll have no more constitutional rights. Your guns will be taken away. You will NOT be able to protect your family. You're already horrible health care will just get worse and more expensive. Will more than likely go to war with Russia. Government will grow even more corrupt. So what do you really want? The 1st woman president who will be impeached or to start putting our country back on track and giving the government TERM limits! It's not that hard folks you're ether destroying America or making a positive change. Most important election of your life......
12 | Miclaire Waldorf Vander Woodsen | 10155484979806509_10155485176051509 | This man does not love money, does not love power, does not love position in government. He is just a Mayor in a small city far from manila. It is the people who rallied him to run for president which in turn he declined repeatedly. But due to mass calling from Filipinos at last minute, he answered the call and run for President and won landslide. This man is willing to die as long as his people live in paradise. That's our President and were are proud of him.
13 | Richard Seeger | 10155484979806509_10155484999576509 | What is scary is that this guy is worse than Trump which says something about voters :/
14 | Sheena Castro | 10155484979806509_10155485293941509 | Don't believe these fanatics of the current president of the Philippines. There are only 16 million of them who voted for the current president. Majority still did not vote their idol. There are 54 million registered voters, 49 million voter turn out, 100 million population. The country is being divided by the current president of the Philippines.
15 | Ken Harris | 10155484979806509_10155485004536509 | Only Hillary Clinton was caught lying to congress.Only Hillary Clinton was fired from a job for being unethical.Only Hillary Clinton deleted 30 some thousand emails after she was ordered to hand them over to the Fed.Only Hillary Clinton had that same computer wiped clean by professionals.Only Hillary Clinton got the rapist of a teenage girl off on rape charges then laughed about it.Only Hillary Clinton lied to the American people about Benghazi. Only Hillary Clinton lied to the American people about her emails. Only Hillary Clinton lied about being under sniper fire.Only Hillary Clinton lied about lying to the American people.Only Hillary Clinton was involved in " Cash Cow " Only Hillary Clinton has a long list of scandals. Only Hillary Clinton nationally belittled her husband's sexual harassment ( and rape ) accusers.Only Hillary Clinton is a career politician.Only Hillary Clinton will not release her speeches to Goldman Sachs and other banks. Only Hillary Clinton is tied to Monsanto. Only Hillary Clinton was labeled " Extremely careless " about national security by the FBI ! Only Hillary Clinton said she will raise taxes on the middle class. Only Hillary Clinton benefited from the DNC rigging an election ! Only Hillary Clinton had to return stolen items from the White House. Only Hillary Clinton said the Benghazi victims parents where lying. Only Hillary Clinton wants you to vote for her based on her gender. Only Hillary Clinton has no real accomplishments after a lifetime in politics. Only Hillary Clinton has never created any jobs.Only Hillary Clinton has been investigated by the FBI and found to have put national security at risk. Only Hillary Clinton has had two or more movies and several documentaries made about her questionable ethics. Only Hillary Clinton was called "Broomstick one" by the SS. Only Hillary Clinton made congress and others spend millions and millions of tax dollars having hearings and investigating her to find that she lied, that would not have been spent if she would of simply told the truth in the first place ! Fact - all facts ! Only Hillary Clinton regularly cussed out and belittled her SS detail. Only Hillary Clinton Only Hillary Clinton Only Hillary Clinton over and over again.But you are going to vote for her because.... you don't like Donald Trump ? That is insane ! I will never understand how any moral person in good conscience could vote for this woman
16 | Walker Cathy | 10155484979806509_10155485120166509 | Libya was cooperating. Egypt was peaceful. Iraq was seeing a reduction in violence. Iran was being choked by sanctions. Syria was under control. After four years of Hillary Clinton, what do we have? ISIS has spread across the region, and the world. Libya is in ruins, and our Ambassador and his staff were left helpless to die at the hands of savage killers. Egypt was turned over to the radical Muslim brotherhood, forcing the military to retake control. Iraq is in chaos.Iran is on the path to nuclear weapons. Syria is engulfed in a civil war and a refugee crisis that now threatens the West. After fifteen years of wars in the Middle East, after trillions of dollars spent and thousands of lives lost, the situation is worse than it has ever been before.This is the legacy of Hillary Clinton: death, destruction and weakness

We're in the spin room in Las Vegas ahead of tonight's debate. What should we watch for and expect? Leave your questions in the comments. #MyVote
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Shandy Elliott | 10155484948231509_10155484967071509 | I think we all should watch out for YOUR spin and how many times you divert from Hillary's behavior and try to point the finger elsewhere.
2 | Lindsey Santiago | 10155484948231509_1279078955477843 | Hillary is Fierce. She is experienced and has worked really hard and long for this, for us. To get behind her, is to get behind your country. #I'mWithHer
3 | Samuel F. Mormando | 10155484948231509_1633634940268822 | What I expect is journalistic integrity. What we will get is Hillary puppets pushing their false, biased narrative. CNN has no credibility left. We the people will never forget what youve done.
4 | Terry Wickwire | 10155484948231509_10155484969446509 | Predictions: Donald J Dump will ramble on with an unstable mindset, shifting from line to line with no reality that his son's computer usage has nothing to do with cyber hacking.
5 | Cynthia Smith | 10155484948231509_1773096066286153 | Wonder if he is gonna stalk, complain, throw out fake stats, show ignorance toward minorities, and lack temperament. That is on a good day! LOL!
6 | Jerry Botkin | 10155484948231509_661228670719702 | Wouldn't it be a nice change of pace if tonight's debate were a respectful and cordial exchange of ideas and contrast of philosophies?  What are the odds of that happening?
7 | Victor Demelo | 10155484948231509_661232210719348 | Republicans have sought to cut hundreds of millions of dollars slated for security at U.S. embassies and consulates since gaining control of the House in 2011. Blame the Republicans for Benghazi
8 | Joe Warner | 10155484948231509_1633635273602122 | When some CNN reporters had dinner at home of top Clinton staffer. What was the objective (goal) and was it realized?  @Wikileaks
9 | David Hawkins | 10155484948231509_1751380181745464 | Will anyone speak of education and how it should be redone from the bottom up to reflect the fact that it is the 21st century?
10 | Maher Mahmoud | 10155484948231509_661232300719339 | I'm not American. But if i were, yes I'd choose the lesser evil. Choosing the lesser evil, if you believe it to be so, is always better than nothing. Idealistic perfectionism achieves nothing.
11 | Deena Hanback Young | 10155484948231509_1633639023601747 | These CNN speakers are idiots.  They are so far left it is disgusting. They practically have hillary winning before we start.  I know no one who has been polled so they really have no clue.
12 | Vivan Ogoke | 10155484948231509_1633640006934982 | both candidates should concentrate on the policies n programme the have 4 america n make their case, is very unfortunate that some ppl r supporting a man who brags of victimizing the feminine gender
13 | Brenda Lee Compton | 10155484948231509_1773094946286265 | What is the 1st act of Business does either candidate plan on in the area of improving Medical care and living accommodations for our US Soldiers and Veterans.
14 | Susan Cho | 10155484948231509_1295625127137935 | I hope Hillary will give a clear answers to the email issues and put them away for the intelligent Americans! As for the rest, no matter what and how the answers provided, they will never let it go. Sad!
15 | Barry Lick | 10155484948231509_549331321929531 | "Spin Room"..at least they are partially honest. Cuff that vile broad and let's move towards a transparent "for the people" administration.
16 | Joseph Richardson | 10155484948231509_1773098619619231 | Do you think social media has had a direct impact on this election?  With so many opinions out there and followers, will this be a good or bad thing for this debate and the viewers siding?

18 | Patrick Bailey | 10155484948231509_661231870719382 | Hey Hillary Clinton my baby brother has been battling Cancer what's your plan for making health care more affordable for him? His name is Michael V Bailey
19 | Roockin Richard | 10155484948231509_1773094562952970 | I wave my rights to vote every one who gets voted in to office they complain about it this is really about The American people not candidates slinging mud.
20 | Ita Quattrone | 10155484948231509_549343998594930 | Hillary is the most qualified candidate who has national and international reputations!! She has shown her compassion and love for the small people around the globe since she  was young!!!
21 | Fabian Nwezay | 10155484948231509_1751382805078535 | Be impartial in your judgement tonight, to save your generation and even those yet unborn in Jesus name. For whatever you sow your children shall definitely reap it.
22 | Gwendolyn Vance | 10155484948231509_1174081519353350 | please stop having your shows in front of those obnoxious people behind you or at least put up plexiglass. Its super distracting & annoying
23 | Erik Lopez | 10155484948231509_1279076018811470 | Minorities are tried of the lies democrats have feeding them! They only care about everyone other the Americans! They have awaken and are not voting for killary!
24 | Must Unite to Stop Trump | 10155484948231509_1803019366631322 | Hopefully we'll hear a discussion of some issues tonight, but let's remember: the fact that one candidate is a woman is irrelevant; the fact that one candidate assaults women is very relevant.
25 | Margarett Tiffany Rawles Debro | 10155484948231509_1174099176018251 | Dear Mrs. Clinton,Please ignore your running mate insults and speak to the people of this country in reference to your goals.Sincerely,ILoveClass&Respect

Rudy Giuliani: "I know men who are touchy-feely... Donald J. Trump is not one of them." 

Live updates from tonight's presidential #debate: http://cnn.it/2e7MPfd

1 | Richard Takizawa | 10155484872416509_10155484881651509 | Watching Mark Cuban make Rudy Giuliani look like an idiot is very enjoyable lmao
2 | Diana Patton Price | 10155484872416509_10155484883636509 | I wonder how Giuliani thinks about Trumps being a Peeping Tom?A Timeline of Donald Trump's Creepiness While He Owned Miss UniverseFrom walking into a teen dressing room to joking about his obligation to sleep with contestants, Trump's a storied pageant creephttp://www.rollingstone.com/politics/features/timeline-of-trumps-creepiness-while-he-owned-miss-universe-w444634
3 | William Enersen | 10155484872416509_10155484888131509 | I am ashamed that Hillary and her party will insite the violence at Trump rallies and create a media storm calling it "The TRUMP Effect" makes me heartbroken that Washington is corrupt and the media is a paid sheep for the Donkey.
4 | Roger Freebold | 10155484872416509_10155484886241509 | A 5 year ban on all executive branch officials lobbying the government after they leave government service.... Change Lobbyist loop holes... Campaign reform!!!!... Term limits.... Democrats and Republicans not in office want this not more government and more red tape, we want less government!, would Hillary do this NO!
5 | Dennis Rubalcaba | 10155484872416509_10155484930096509 | Giuliani is senile, he does not remember 9/11, he claims no terrorist attacks happened until Obama was in office. How can he remember if trump was ever inappropriate. Why is this man on television???
6 | Thomas Johnson | 10155484872416509_10155484889236509 | He was touchy feely trying to shove his Tongue in the little Black girls mouth then he Sucked her Face didn't Rudy see the video everyone else is checking it out what about you CNN and is this the reason the daughter Tiffany won't allow him to kiss or hug her???
7 | Baudouin de Crombrugghe | 10155484872416509_10155484911406509 | Donald Trump, a "gentleman"???Wow! ...Rudy Giuliani is a really good little soldier of Trump!If some more intelligent people are voting for Hillary Clinton, you should ask yourself why...Maybe it's a more pertinent vote.Anyway, if you are strongly attached to free enterprise, there are also others alternatives like Gary Johnson who comes from a Lutheran background and was republican before 2011.If you are deceived about the behaviour of Donald J.trump, here is the reason: The problem of Donald J.Trump is that he probably has a double allele (OXTR) revealing a psychopathy/sociopathy, a narcissistic background and an inability to empathy. All this is probably combined with a "warrior gene" revealing a hard trends on aggressiveness.Sure that he has all of this and, as it's heavily impacting the public life, the voters have the right to know this.For that reason, I'm favourable to publish the results of a genetic test about the behavioural markers of the candidates to the presidency. Donald Trump can appear «fun» or more charismatic… but it’s all in appearance: He’s a really dangerous guy, a pathetic manipulator and a shameless liar.… And a dangerous guy for the whole planet!!! Guys like Donald Trump should stay in their business and never present themselves to a public mandate.Donald Trump is NOT the one that he shows.Make America SANE again and choose anyone else but not him!
8 | JoAnna Benefield | 10155484872416509_10155484911766509 | I keep hearing, in response to Republicans speaking on Bill Clintons assaults that "he's not the one running for President"! He isn't running, but he will be in the White House if Killery wins, so that's ok! So Democrats are basically saying "We will allow that, we approve of him assaulting more women!Let him in, after all he's not running!" Smh
9 | Lorraine Rivers | 10155484872416509_10155484955676509 | Shame on John King for claiming Arizona is in play based on a recent poll. The poll with 18% more Democrats than Republicans in a state with 100,000 more GOP voters? The one that oversampled women by 9%? The poll that oversampled college graduates by 200%? Funnily enough, Democrats, women, and college graduates overwhelmingly support Clinton so the poll had a ridiculously higher percentage of all of those groups....and she's still only up by 5%??!?!! Sounds to me like the Democrats are pumping up her support with these bogus polls in order to cover up the voter fraud they're planning to enact. Shame on all of you!
10 | Danielle Beley | 10155484872416509_10155484987251509 | I wish Giuliani & Cuban could've debated for 90 minutes. Thattttt back and forth was amazing! (Summary. Not verbatim)Giuliani: I'm not going to answer hypotheticals about Donald if I knew he had accosted some of these women. Mark, if you knew Clinton had killed someone would you still feel the same about her?Cuban (without hesitation): Uhh NO. I wouldn't.
11 | Sarah Stiegel | 10155484872416509_10155485722181509 | 8 Generations ago my direct relative, Col. Christopher Truby risked his life fighting the British in the American Revolution.  Today, nearly 240+ years later I find myself saddened by the state of our great country.  I have always felt pride being an American, a patriot, however at this time I'm almost embarrassed and most definitely saddened.  Our country has regressed 270+ years to a state where we need to overthrow our governing body.  Don't you remember learning in American history "no taxation without representation".?  Don't you remember the pride you felt learning how our founding fathers drafted such amazing documents like the Declaration of Independence and most importantly the Constitution of the United States?  Our fore-fathers died for those documents, those beliefs.  Now today 270+ years later our basic rights that we fought for are at stake and it sickens me to see how many people are willing to throw it all away.  This election isn't about taxes, immigration, or abortion, this election is about our basic American rights.  We are at risk of losing our guaranteed rights thanks to a corrupt woman and her ulterior motives.  I'm voting for America, for our founding fathers, for our Bill of Rights, for our Freedoms, for the best country in the world.  This isn't about race/ethnicity this is about US, as Americans, standing up for US, the greatest nation of the modern world.  We need to bring back unity, we need to be proud Americans.  It's time to stand up, with our right hand over our heart and proudly state "one God, indivisible, in liberty and justice for ALL".  Protect our America, our freedom.  Vote TRUMP 2016
12 | Dan Daugherty | 10155484872416509_10155485020916509 | CNN is thinking of doing a podcast and after careful consideration, they've selected the following locations as being premium locations for proper sound recording and now America gets to choose from among them:1) A Monster Truck Rally2) An Airport Runway3) Inside the jet of a 7474) A blender testing facility.
13 | Matt Cardenas | 10155484872416509_10155484911326509 | Men that fondle and grope don't do it when everyone can see. "Look, there's Rudy 911, let me fondle this chick so he can see how much of a man I am."
14 | Fran Lanier | 10155484872416509_10155484988311509 | Giuliani, you are not Trump's type!  Of course he has not been groping around you!  I am sure it took a lot of inward reflection to be brave enough for these ladies to come forward!  If this happened to a female that you loved you would feel differently!  Stop attacking them!
15 | Kelly Christensen | 10155484872416509_10155484972576509 | I've been trying to listen to CNN on My TuneIn App today...all the chanting in the background isn't working...I keep turning it off. It's sooooooo distracting...can you turn that nonsense down? I can't hear the CNN moderators!
16 | Elena Privitzer Perrotta | 10155484872416509_10155485511231509 | How much time did u devote to the James o Keefe showing the set up of rally rioting by Clinton campaignHow much time did u spend talking about the office that was fire bombed in NC Media bias will never watch CNN again
17 | Robert Leonard | 10155484872416509_10155484917061509 | I am watching CNN with their polls. Being as bias as they are how many Trump supporters would actually answer their poll? I have my doubts. Hillary might be ahead by 3 or 4 ut not the 8 and 9 they give her. As low as the medias ratings are why would anyone trust them.
18 | Nicky Hibbert Msw | 10155484872416509_10155485383796509 | Madam president there need to be social policy that address the issue of income inequality. You can't say you will tax the rich and the problem of income inequality disappear. Raise income and curve inflation so middle class can have money flowing in their pocket. Middle class don't need government controlling they life. Because all men are created equally by their creator and deserve the right to life liberty and happiness. Taxing the rich will not solve poverty reduction
19 | Jon Sellers | 10155484872416509_10155484920791509 | "Robert Creamer, who acted as a middle man between the Clinton campaign, the Democratic National Committee and “protesters” who tried — and succeeded — to provoke violence at Trump rallies met with President Obama 47 times, according to White House records. Creamer’s last visit was in June 2016."Are you reporting on this fraud????
20 | Leroy Shaquille Rogers | 10155484872416509_10155484887581509 | Like he would admit it at this point. He's like an unpopular kid wanting to be friends wpith the bully because he thinks it's cool.
21 | Debbie Robles Birdsong | 10155484872416509_10155484935121509 | CNN: What is all the background yelling as we're trying to listen to the panel before the debate?  There was a phone going off,  horn blaring..... Really?  Can't you shut that out while we TRY to listen to what the panel has to say?
22 | Abbie Fitzgerald Schaub | 10155484872416509_10155484948601509 | Horrible pre debate coverage, the background sounds of people chanting and yelling drown out the CNN broadcasters, very annoying. I gave up watching, who ever is programming the audio here?
23 | Jeff A. Johnson | 10155484872416509_10155485034346509 | That is a brave woman sitting in between them... surprised she can stand the brimstone radiating off of Giuliani (sorry, had to drop an Alex Jones reference in there)
24 | Haullie Free-Volker | 10155484872416509_10155484952311509 | I don't have to care about either one of these candidates, I care about each and every one of you first. Rights, equality, freedom, liberty and justice for a peaceful America. We CAN unite!
25 | Sherrie Santana | 10155484872416509_10155484898086509 | Does anyone notice that CNN only reports and post negative about Trump including his photos they make him out to look menacing. Its just more reason to vote for Trump.

1 | Zabi Habash | 10155484825366509_10155484837931509 | What a disgusting sold out puppet Giuliani is. Rudy Giuliani calls Trump a genius for losing 900 million dollars in 1995? I lose $10 in the back of a taxi cab and my wife calls me an idiot.
2 | Mark Boldwin | 10155484825366509_10155484833436509 | Mark Cuban, GET A LIFE!!! You defend your Crooked Hillary ONLY because you will BENEFIT from her policies that ONLY supports people like YOU and HURTS hard working people!!!
3 | Willie Love | 10155484825366509_10155484839851509 | All you but hurt Trump supporters that keep talking about CNN you do know you can unfollow the page right. Oh let's not forget to vote on November 28th and never forget 7/11
4 | Patricia Watson | 10155484825366509_10155484843011509 | Bravo Mark!  I'm from Canada so my thoughts don't count in the USA.  We have been watching this mayhem daily since we have a daughter now living in the US and from what we see you were right on the money in your debate with Rudy Giuliani.  Any chance you could think seriously about running for office down there?!! ;-)
5 | Eric Salazar | 10155484825366509_10155484830986509 | President Obama’s Kenyan-born, half-brother Malik will be in the audience in Las Vegas Wednesday night when Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton square off in their third and final debate.Malik — an American citizen who lives in Washington, DC, when he’s not in Kenya — says he will be a guest of Trump, the Republican nominee he supports for president.“I’m excited to be at the debate. My brother is an idiot. And Mrs Clinton is a criminal” Malik told The Post.
6 | Nwankwo Okereke Oleh | 10155484825366509_10155484829641509 | CNN is worthless i use to believe in this media but my eyes have seen hell on their report ever since this campaign started , to the extend i don't even bother to read their headlines talk less of reading the news in details, i am happy for following this campaign update at least i have know what this junk media represent once they hate you they can never report any good thing about you
7 | Jennifer Hord Wagner | 10155484825366509_10155484875511509 | I hate to agree with Cuban but he is right. Trump has whored his name out to everything but toilet paper. Makes me wonder just how rich he is.
8 | Caleb Carson | 10155484825366509_10155484845951509 | Rudy forgot to mention Trump is the front runner for the GOP!   If Mark could shut his pie hole long enough to listen for a change, he may have heard more of Trump's accomplishments.
9 | Charlie Kodatt | 10155484825366509_10155484872981509 | Mark Cuban grow up...you look like an idiot and honestly you even being there makes you look like a wannabe. If you want attention do something else instead of talking down about Trump and backing a criminal. Stay in Preston Hollow.
10 | Idieh Lynn | 10155484825366509_10155484828791509 | GO MARK!  That was GORGEOUS!  Rudy was stammering at some points!
11 | Óscar Roriz | 10155484825366509_10155484839041509 | Mark Cuban I really love you as a person and as an entrepreneur, but please stay away of this Mark. Don't give your name and sell yourself this way.
12 | Lynn Caroline | 10155484825366509_10155484860721509 | Mark Cuban thank you for pointing out Trumps many many business failures and bankruptcies Trump looks out for Trump Americans need to see his income taxes!!!!!!!!!
13 | Matt Myers | 10155484825366509_10155484847416509 | I'm glad the media is biased! Trump doesn't derseve a even oprrtunity to win this election. No man who proposes a ban on a religion or mass deportation deserves a chance to be president. If your so upset of "crooked Hillary" he should be appalled  at what trump has said and done. But all of those who support trump aren't Muslim so they could care less. What about if he but a ban on Christians/Catholics? How would you feel? All these bad things Hillary has done does not even amount to what this man has said and done.
14 | Maryclaire Medford | 10155484825366509_1150855764996337 | Hey mark whatta think of all the business deals w Saudi Arabia .good for our country? How bout ICE that supports DT? I think I will listen to them,not you
15 | Reginald Mcknight | 10155484825366509_2153143994910924 | Gullibleany is more like Rudy crazy probably been eating some of mold covered Trump stakes Donald gave him. Those steaks probably had mold which is affecting his brain more crazy for Trump.lol !
16 | Sharon Robinson | 10155484825366509_10155484868091509 | Look up what he did in Scotland! He took over peoples property, distroyed people's property, cut off their water and ran them off! He's a misberable SOB and distroys peoples's homes, families and lives!
17 | Paula Rimshaw Yanoshik | 10155484825366509_1150870891661491 | I like how when Mark Cuban had the chance, when Guiliani was making sex claims about the Clintons, and said how his own wife found Trump respectful, that Cuban didn't call out Guiliani and his wife as married cheating bags of sh*t, which they were. Check out the facts in case you don't know them. Donna from Hazelton PA.
18 | Steven Villarreal | 10155484825366509_10155484848181509 | Eight years ago the American people decided Hillary wasn't good enough to be President. They chose a lesser known, a lessor qualified person instead. The Democrats thought it was the right time to use the race card and not the sexist card. Turned out to be the worst anti-American President we've ever had. So now we have the same old Hillary, only now we know more about her lies and her attacks on the women that Bill cheated with. We know from Wikileaks how 2 face she is. She wants open borders. Her list of corruption grows daily. You just can't trust her.
19 | Kevin Dami | 10155484825366509_1150859228329324 | Vote Democrat - Under Obama, Median household income last year jumped up 5.2 percent, to $56,516, Census reported. That was the largest percentage increase in 17 years.
20 | John Cupac | 10155484825366509_10155484838061509 | Mark argues trump is bad business guyGood counter to Clinton should be in.prison lolBad business man vs criminal you decide
21 | Christopher Floyd | 10155484825366509_10155484882426509 | If he's failed so much how in the world can he afford that 747 plane? Not bad for a so-called failure. Mark Cuban, nice try on EMBELLISHMENT, but I'm not buying it.
22 | Miriam Viviana | 10155484825366509_10155484845721509 | Ugh, when this will be over? I don't like either candidate, Hillary Clinton is at the same level than former Argentina president Cristina Kirchner, soooo corrupt, and Donald Trump is ok for a celebrity, but he is not politician, and unfortunately he must to deal not only with America but with the whole world... HOPE for a better candidate in 2021, these 2 suck big time
23 | Ti Sinite | 10155484825366509_1150929344988979 | Excuse me, Mark Cuban!!! You slam Trump's business record. Have you shown yours? Trump is still a businessman, world class business man, is still named one of the billionaires in America and in the world. Beyond, he has the guts, much more guts than any other billionaires to run the Presidency for the White House. Hahahahaha just so you know in case, you've forgot to put your thinking cap on.
24 | Angela Williams | 10155484825366509_2153259038232753 | I have lost respect for mark Cuban. He supports a person for president who supports women killing their babies because they don't want them.  Mark Cuban is a shark and he supports Hillary Clinton who thinks like a shark. I am done with Shark Tank because I am done with Mark Cuban and Hillary Clinton and I have washed my hands of CNN.
25 | Steven Lambie | 10155484825366509_10155484872641509 | What happened to you most corrupt mma organisation elite xc mr cuban? It failed badly and your show was know for some of the worst fight fixing in mma, people in glass houses shouldnt throw stones.

Rudy Giuliani on Hillary Clinton: "If she was anybody else, she'd be under indictment right now" http://cnn.it/2evjU2A
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Bob Magee | 10155484806806509_10155484816951509 | Shouldn't you be remembering how Hillary was walking alongside you on September 12...only to have you claim she was never there (despite photo and video proof to the contrary)?  Just go away quietly, Rudy.
2 | Ralph Olson | 10155484806806509_10155484814001509 | juliani is a moron,who said there has never been any terrorist attacks before obama..and he was the mayor during 9eleven..MORON!
3 | Patricia Haidvogel | 10155484806806509_10155484817556509 | All the years of speculation and investigating repeatedly...she must be the smartest criminal ever. Giuliani should go take a chill pill. People aren't guilty just because you want them to be.
4 | Justin Sparks | 10155484806806509_10155484811976509 | Trump will have this in the bag, with all the Clinton emails and video evidence. #TRUMP2016 Hillary will be in jail November 9th
5 | Kathy Pratt | 10155484806806509_10155484823996509 | Erin you're doing a great job. My suggestion is that you stop letting the mayor run the question. He is rude and I commend Mark for his restraint. Please tell him to stop interrupting.
6 | Rick Friar | 10155484806806509_10155484811776509 | your eyes and ears, as well as humanity is under fire when you listen to Trump. No way you can ignore all of his issues and yet you sit there and act as if Hillary is so much worse than him. What a fail.
7 | John Shelnut | 10155484806806509_10155484810406509 | This is not questioning the candidates on their political platforms which truly needs to be debated. I would like to know how they plan on carrying out their given platforms.
8 | Matthew Schmidt | 10155484806806509_10155484821826509 | Mark Cuban is an idiot. He says that Trump hit on someone women. Who cares guys hit on women and sometimes men don't say the right things. Big deal he tried macking it to them. Get over it America! Men can be pigs. Trump for President!!
9 | Nick Zilber | 10155484806806509_10155484830951509 | its funny Giuliani talks about Clinton and his affairs yet this old man, married his cousin as his first marrage and his second he cheated on his wife and told the press about it before his wife, the joke this old man is
10 | Bob Kroner | 10155484806806509_10155484815926509 | If rudy was anyone else, he'd be on his couch with his hand in his pants yelling at the TV wearing a tinfoil hat.
11 | Jim Barlow | 10155484806806509_10155484832436509 | Rudy your an idiot one hit wonder mayor. If it weren't for the unfortunate events of 9/11 you wouldn't be where you are. An adulteress like you should t be judging anyone.
12 | William Martin | 10155484806806509_10155484823896509 | Well like Comey said, if she were indicted, she'd get off. The regulations for her department and vague and aren't specific about the punishments of violations of those regulation. If they were GWB, Colin Powell, Condoleezza Rice, and Several members of the US Attorney's office would have been indicted already. You can't put someone in jail for something that wasn't illegal when they did it.
13 | Shawn Nacona Stroud | 10155484806806509_10155484843591509 | I call B.S...when Bush had 13 Benghazis, a much more massive 2007 email scandal, ignored various 9/11 pre warnings and lied to start a war he was not indicted and Rudy is an idiot hypocrite supporting a confessed sexual assaulting pig with a growing victims list. Trump should be in jail.
14 | Bill Mallory | 10155484806806509_10155484820556509 | Enough about Bill Clinton ... he's not running. But if you must talk about his escapades , lets talk about his economy & the deficit under Bill Clinton.
15 | Gary Parks | 10155484806806509_10155484814771509 | I can't vote for a woman that wants to open borders. I can't imagine the effect on our country when Juarez, Mexico bleeds over into our country.
16 | Evangelist C. Quashigah | 10155484806806509_10155484834316509 | This is the kind of nonsense you spew out when losing election. For these same guys who put the FBI director on high pedestal only to turn against him because he didn't find basis to indict Hillary Clinton, is just preposterous.
17 | Rebecca Jeffers | 10155484806806509_10155484821681509 | Giuliani keeps saying Trump has apologized for all his comments and that he is a different person....bull pucky....How about all the priests and clergy that have been caught with their pants down - so to speak - I for one do not accept his apology and I see him for what he really is...
18 | Brian Santana | 10155484806806509_10155484857696509 | So let me get this straight. What trump said 11 years ago is a lot worse than what Hillary has done to our national security in the past 12years? Am i correct here?
19 | Amy Cranmer | 10155484806806509_10155484838836509 | Bat crap crazy Rudy! He cracks me up. Only a lawyer would think Trump will be great for the nation. The reason is most lawyers are as conflicted and corrupt as the Donald. Cannot do business in the building trades in NYC and NJ without dealing with every ethnic mob out there.
20 | Regina Schuester | 10155484806806509_1221105217954325 | Obamacare is not what we were told it would be. Clinton wants ClintonCollege. So does that mean on top of paying for other's insurance, under Clinton, we will also be paying for other's college?  And how can Clinton create jobs if Clinton imposes taxes on the people who create the jobs? Clinton wants all the immigrants to go out & get jobs making it more difficult for Americans to get a job & with immigrants probably getting special concessions because they are special?
21 | Sherry Moxley Myers | 10155484806806509_678937565612889 | Word for word from the Cornell Law Library Former United States Attorney General Michael Mukasey tells MSNBC that not only is Hillary Clinton's private email server illegal, it "disqualifies" her from holding any federal office. Very specifically points to one federal law, Title 18. Section 2071.For those of us who do not have United States Code committed to memory, here's what it says:“(a) Whoever willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys, or attempts to do so, or, with intent to do so takes and carries away any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both. (b) Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States. As used in this subsection, the term “office” does not include the office held by any person as a retired officer of the Armed Forces of the United States.”Yes, it explicitly states "shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States."
22 | Katrina Galanos | 10155484806806509_10155484833471509 | She must be Soooo loved by everyone... The whole planet is on her side ! She is better than Mata Harri ... mesmerizing the media, the FBI, the justice department, half of this country and she approaches sainthood.The GOP is so sick with jealousy and fear of loosing their seats that SNL is now more serious than the GOP ! Go Hilary !!  Four more years and better !
23 | Carl Andricsak | 10155484806806509_678925752280737 | I just don't understand how anyone in their right mind would choose corruption, murder, lying, open borders, risk national security etc. just to keep the person from the same party in office. Time for a change....
24 | Gloria Richman | 10155484806806509_1221010307963816 | Rudy is a desperate man whose political career is in the toilet and hopes for a late life resurrection by supporting the most despicable presidential candidate in American history.  The fat lady has sung Rudy, so please go home now.
25 | Mary Kluck | 10155484806806509_10155484866141509 | There has been no documented evidence of pay for play in the State Department and yet Giuliani keeps saying there is. Just like he doesn't remember Clinton being in NY at ground zero.

1 | CNN | 10155484649231509_10155484670181509 | There is no audio.
2 | JoAnne McKenzie Temple | 10155484649231509_1777656965841486 | Why did you cut off the feed when the interviewee mentioned the truths exposed by Wikileaks?  CNN is almost as corrupt as Hilliary.
3 | Pat Danielle Donnelly | 10155484649231509_10155484664381509 | Go Hillary take it to the house 20 more days and you're in
4 | Jim Kinder | 10155484649231509_1777653375841845 | Very proud to say Hillary Clinton will be our next President!!! Love it !!
5 | Barbara Lynn | 10155484649231509_1777657509174765 | I cannot believe that people are actually going to vote Hillary. I guess they love being ripped off and taken for a ride. Geez!!!!!!
6 | Pat Placencio | 10155484649231509_1790174627891155 | The first 10 people that come to the Cold Keg on West New Haven in Melbourne, FL after Hillary wins gets a free beer on me!  See you there Wed., Nov. 9th at 8pm.
7 | Mike Winings | 10155484649231509_1325921990752836 | Hillary is for her and lies about helping poor people, tells them what they want to here, and does something different! Liar liar liar
8 | John Jones | 10155484649231509_927320954067840 | Well, if you want someone as comm in chief that would leave your son or daughter to die, then you want Killerary.  But my family served and we wouldn't support any who would do that.
9 | Gregory Leone | 10155484649231509_1777652209175295 | There's no sound because CNN doesn't want you to hear them chanting "Lock her up!"
10 | Sterlin Brown | 10155484649231509_1417784688251123 | History will be made November 8th with Hillary Clinton as the first female president
11 | Brad Hamilton | 10155484649231509_1790171407891477 | Hillary is already on track for over 350 electoral votes!!! More states are flipping blue and leaving the dark side!
12 | Judy Mills Werner | 10155484649231509_1790172861224665 | I'd love to say something really nice about each candidate, but it escapes me. One's a womanizer and the other is a crook bringing back an impeached womanizer. Hmm......
13 | Ryan Wheeler | 10155484649231509_1801984376753899 | There is no audio feed because half of this country if not more wants her behind bars. They've chanting "Lock her up" and CNN Clinton News Network will not let us hear the truth

17 | Lorraine Hodgson | 10155484649231509_1325921024086266 | Very hard to listen to what people are saying over the noise of the crowd.  CNN needs to find a way to block the background noise.
18 | Jeremy Jay Groves | 10155484649231509_1801986203420383 | Dear person reading this, I hope your day has been going well, if not, I hope it gets better you are an amazing person who will inspire others to do great things keep up the good work.

"I think she is going to go down at a minimum as a great senator. I think she is a great wife to a president. And I think Bill Clinton was a great president," Donald J. Trump said in an interview in 2008.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Nathan Graf | 10155484601761509_10155484611526509 | Flip flop flip flop.....One minute he loves her the next minute he wants to lock her up in prison. Tell me, when are you Mr. Trump going to be locked up in jail for scamming millions of out innocent people for fake Trump University degrees. The hypocrisy is just limitless and astounding from the Republican scum buckets.
2 | Joseph Amberson | 10155484601761509_10155484614306509 | If CNN doesn't stand for Clinton News Network, it should. Biggest butt kissing news network for the Clintons I have ever seen.
3 | Andrew Jared | 10155484601761509_10155484611236509 | I'm starting to think Trump is just planted by the Clinton machine to secure even more votes in addition to the voter fraud scheme. She wants to have sure footing in The White House.

5 | Melissa Lynch Carter | 10155484601761509_10155484610796509 | DEAR HILLARY, Written by Summer Marie. I really hope you do not become the first female president.I write this not because I am some crazy, right-wing, anti-feminist conspirator; I hope you are not our first female president because it would be a disgrace to that title and a disgrace to all of the young women in our country who aspire to actually do some good for our nation.Many people believe you are the best candidate for the position because you have been doing this political thing for a while—but when was the last time that you were able to relate to the common American?You grew up in the rich white suburbs of Chicago as a young child and attended Yale. You then went on to ride Bill’s coattails all the way to your Senate seat as a former First Lady. Any true feminist would look at you and see that you are a fraud.You get on your soapbox and claim that every woman who is a victim of sexual assault should be heard—but what about Juanita Broaddrick? Carolyn Moffet? Paula Corbin? Sara Allen-James? Christy Zercher? Kathleen Willey? Monica Lewinsky? All women who were sexually harassed or exploited by your husband. Yet you stand by him continuously, defending him and helping clean up his messes. If you ask me, that’s not very appealing to me as a woman. You also stood by him after he openly admitted to having “sexual relations” with Monica. That sounds like a very conservative stand by my man move if you ask me.If you were as independent as you portray yourself to be, why didn’t you just leave Bill? Because you needed his political access to get your foot in the door.All of that aside, the sheer fact that you allowed four Americans to perish in Benghazi and then proceeded to later ask, “what difference does it make?” proves to me that you don’t care about American lives. Those were four American men who died. Four families in our country that suffered a loss. Four mothers that had to bury their sons.“What difference does it make?”“Because it’s not just a detail if it’s your kid, if it’s your family. It’s a big deal. And it should be a big deal to your president, too.”A detail to you, former Secretary—but to those families, a huge difference.Not to mention you want to allow all of these refugees in. Don’t get me wrong: I am a humanitarian. However, I, as an American citizen, am guaranteed safety as well as the safety of my future children and grandchildren in the Preamble of the Constitution of the United States. The one thing, if nothing else, that you as someone running for President of the United States should uphold. I understand that we should help people, but at the end of the day, would Syria do the same for us? In our time of crisis it is our job first and foremost, and yours, to ensure our own citizen’s safety.You use your platform of charitable humanitarian but now we are learning the extent to which your foundation is a fraud. It’s nothing but a money-laundering business that you can catch a tax break from.Which, by the way, is a wee bit illegal.You took up monetary donations after the Haiti earthquake and, yes, you did build a textile factory—on the opposite side of Haiti that wasn’t even affected by the earthquake. You also conveniently signed off Uranium to be given to Russia just after Uranium One shareholders deposited $145 million in donations to the Clinton Foundation. How thoughtful of them.You also claim to be against big business and fight all the big bad business bullies, but you’re in bed with them!Your daughter is, too. Your daughter married a former investor for Goldman Sachs. Your family managed to help spend some odd $3 million on their wedding. Wonder where that money really came from.You claim to be a friend of the black community and that you’re going to help bring them out of poverty. Look around! You are a part of the administration that has left them where they are and you have no intentions of changing that. You want control. Your mentor Saul Alinsky taught you that.You don’t know any struggle or strife. You are the epitome of “white privilege.” You traipse around in heinous $12,000 suits and preach about how you are for the people—how you are going to pull them out of poverty as you attend events where you give 20-minute speeches to the tune of $500,000 and eat $800 plates of food on your private plane.You have never faced financial strife. What makes you think you can help fix our national debt crisis?Above all things, if nothing else, the reason why I hope you don’t become the first female president is because you are a criminal. It does not matter if you didn’t intentionally use a server that was not secure. I may not intentionally go 55 in a 40 but the police officer is going to give me a ticket. I may not intentionally kill someone in a car accident; however, I can still go down for manslaughter. People don’t intentionally become drug addicts but you bet they still end up in prison for possession.You think you are above the law. You manipulate the system, which is not what a leader does. It’s not right.I am not some right-wing conspiracy theorist lunatic. I simply look at the facts.These facts tell me that I wouldn’t let you look after my pet rock, much less this nation.Yours truly, A Real Future Female Leader
6 | Stephen Ford Baxley | 10155484601761509_10155484677021509 | Remember Obama said the opposite about Hillary - but only when they were competing for POTUS - but now...oh, but wait, that doesn't matter. We are only talking about Trump here.
7 | Milay Cruz | 10155484601761509_10155484655746509 | Enough is Enough , Both parties need to stand up and demand a psychiatric examination , IT is so OBVIOUS Donald Trump is MENTALLY UNSTABLE !!! And it should be mandatory for anyone entering Office !!!
8 | Monique Rousseau | 10155484601761509_10155484616846509 | Well he was wrong about that. She would make an awful leader even with 30 plus years of experience. She lies too much and honestly would hate to hear that voice doe 4 years as she continues to do nada. #NeverHER
9 | Charisa Whitefeather | 10155484601761509_10155484646486509 | Well, they probably was before THEY got to her, and him and totally changed them both. That was past tense. This is a new day, time and era. Things have definitely changed. Our focus is now on the Don and his First Lady! YEA BABY!  LOL
10 | Helen Najib | 10155484601761509_813090335461117 | Annnddddd??? Michelle Obama said, "In my view....if you can't run your house, you certainly can't run the White House." Was talking about Hillary Clinton in 2008. And those are the only words I will ever agree with that come from Michelle.
11 | Stevie Neely | 10155484601761509_10155484638666509 | I love how the media reflects the relationship back then of Trump/Clinton like he was the only one who ever said anything about her... hello she has also said good things about him as well back then, idiots! It's both ways for both of them!
12 | Cindy Gonzalez Burdorf | 10155484601761509_10155484683141509 | YAWN! Move on...I THOUGHT Bill Clinton was a good president as well till the ALTERNATIVE MEDIA and Wikileaks pulled back the curtain on "the great and powerful Oz"! Face it! No one is buying the bs you guys are spinning ANYMORE! 😂😂😂
13 | Michael Siameh | 10155484601761509_10155484624631509 | This feels more like an erection than an election because America's getting f**ked no matter who wins. But still. Any of the other three will be a much better option than Jaundiced Hitler.
14 | Edgar Solomon | 10155484601761509_10155484650241509 | I am scared of a man on the ground with his hands up, Madea, a 66 year old grandma swinging a bat, or a 10 yr old kid playing in the park or one walking home minding his own business, or a man that is running away from me, or one on the ground asking me to help him breathe..... I am just a scared spineless whinny little girl and that's why I am voting for TRUMP!!!!!
15 | Dani Haider | 10155484601761509_1738385896414242 | And Barrack Obama said that she will say anything and do nothing to become president.Michelle said if you can't run your own house, you can't run the White House.Let those 2 sink in a little too.
16 | Emily Mitchell Bettis | 10155484601761509_10155484638391509 | Oh really?You think she IS a great wife?Not that anyone should judge anyone else's private marriage but didn't you say she was wrong for standing by him?None of what you say makes sense to me.
17 | Tanya Bailey | 10155484601761509_10155484640621509 | So he was duped like we all were. Now let's move on to real news, like how Hillary should be in prison. I think we should bring back the firing squad. Let all of Bill's victims take a shot.
18 | Ronald Ron | 10155484601761509_10155484653786509 | REALLY CNN??? hahaha you morons... everyone knows Donald was not into politics at the time he was into getting what he needed for his businesses and BSing the politicians... get real.. HAHAHA
19 | Michael Brandy Baldwin | 10155484601761509_1738384586414373 | Yes politicians suck. They all lie. They are all guilty of some dastardly deed or another right? No one sucks as bad as the American voter. They will believe any conspiracy and reject any fact when their leader loses. If trump has an upset the dems will.If the polls shift the reps will suddenly be sharing cnn polls everywhere chamlioning them as fact that Donald is the best (like they did after the first wikileaks hurt Hillary) Americans hate democracy. They hate it when people they dont like, who believe differently than them win the election. When your kids wake up in an America where the Democracy is destroyed and we have a revolution by people who hate the system because they have lost! All because you could not stand the constitution forcing you to share yiur country with people who are different than you!When they have torn this beautiful country down around their ears. They and their families will suffer and it will be their fault.
20 | Elizabeth Strong | 10155484601761509_1738388076414024 | 8 years have changed a lot of people's hearts and minds . Look at the change in your own candidate , she has changed with the wind . I would respect CNN more if you just came out and said " we are endorsing Hillary " stop the charade of journalistic integrity .
21 | Angela Dennis | 10155484601761509_1738382433081255 | This the thing people change their minds once they run against each other. However what counts is how they felt when they had nothing to lose such as when they weren't running. That's how they truly felt. These remarks are astounding. He is her fan. I've said this from day one.
22 | Kathy J Kennedy-Bell | 10155484601761509_935574139880976 | And he says she flip flops...ha freakin ha. There was one interview that he said she would make a great president. He changes his mind with the wind. He just not mentally and emotionally git to be President of the United States!!
23 | Ahmed Siddiqui | 10155484601761509_813109835459167 | With time the news outlets are expressing their political affiliations. If RT doesn't spare any chance to talk about leaked mails of Hilary, CNN goes extra miles for shaming Donald J. Trump. And in the whole drama when the majority is emotionally stuck to either side. Few independent thinker are wondering if the self praising, politically incorrect, tax evading racist is better or worse than the politically correct, wall street shill who speaks flowers while selling guns.
24 | Patrick Santoyo | 10155484601761509_1187915984635763 | So is this the same as Obama saying that she was not qualified and fit to run for president in 08? So now as of late he says shes the most qualified to run and endorsed her? It's okay if the democrats backtrack but not a republican right?
25 | Bill Pettigrew | 10155484601761509_10155484629881509 | He is a sociopath and a conman who works the angles in every situation and has no loyalty to anyone but himself he even stiffed his own brother when his father was dying he got him to change his will to remove his older brother!

Today, she works for Donald J. Trump at his hotel on the Las Vegas Strip. But she's not voting for him.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Chris Sachjen | 10155484494951509_10155484498111509 | I'd start polishing that resume and looking for work. Don't bite the hand that feeds. I'm not saying vote for him because he employs you, but maybe don't make a campaign against it.
2 | Doug Tmade | 10155484494951509_10155484500351509 | And yet tons of dead people will be voting for Hillary. Not surprised how the Clinton News Network (CNN) had been avoiding the admissions from two, now fired, DNC operatives admitting 50 years of voter fraud.
3 | Mike Healy | 10155484494951509_10155484505611509 | Good for her, but i tell you she will be still cleaning windows for someone else making them rich, and can you imagine a Hillary presidency, ugh...depressing.
4 | אליזבת כהן | 10155484494951509_10155484505206509 | As an Israeli, I hope Trump wins. I have a feeling the elections will be rigged too. 2 times ,a president was elected by the votes of Superdelegates backed by least amount of voters. Is this your democracy? Also, Americans get mad when foreigners get involved and share their opinions in America's elections but America always in our business during our elections and they are always in many other countries' businesses too.
5 | Yvette Cathers | 10155484494951509_10155484524246509 | Not voting for Trump is no legal or moral cause to fire someone, but going on TV and advertising that, along with saying all the things you don't like about him?  Yeah, she's probably fired, and I couldn't fault Trump for doing that.  Of course, I'm sure she was paid very well for doing this in the first place.
6 | Joe Gomez | 10155484494951509_10155484542991509 | These are not Trump employees. In the hospitality business, the only real hotel employees are the general manager, the chef, banquet manager and the folks in accounting. All the rest (housekeeping, laundry, food services) are sub contracted by a third party vendor. That's why they are referred to a "workers". Nice try CNN.
7 | William Taylor Claypoole | 10155484494951509_10155484502481509 | Gee... not even trying to hide the clear bias.I guess it is all in for network survival at this point. I foresee the FCC taking someone's license away. #Truth
8 | Dennis Moreno | 10155484494951509_10155484501841509 | That awkward moment when you're reading this comment to find an awkward moment but there isn't any, and still you're reading this comment and you're starting to realize it says nothing important and you just wasted a couple of seconds of your life but you're still reading and you don't even know why. That's awkward... You should give me a like for wasting your time.
9 | John A. Belinus | 10155484494951509_10155484499071509 | So discouraged by the rigged election. The liberal media and rigged ballot boxes will make Trump lose. I'm not going to even bother voting now. I'm staying home to pray on election day.
10 | Sumit Dahiya | 10155484494951509_1029313487177339 | Hey CNN, still waiting for you to report on Wikileaks. Heres a cue: your former employee Donna Brazille was feeding Clinton questions before a primary debate. You guys need to be ashamed.
11 | Sue Reynolds | 10155484494951509_10155484523336509 | So the news just runs around finding everybody who knows Trump and interviewing them and what about Hillary
12 | Josh Tucker | 10155484494951509_1157197794373953 | Lol wait...you can't honestly call him her boss. He is the boss of the regional manager who is the boss of the hotel manager who is the boss of the staff manager who is the boss of her boss. She has likely never met Trump...but come on CNN. Start trying to actually be a news organization instead of propoganda.
13 | Sagar Timalsina | 10155484494951509_1029320837176604 | Has CNN ever wrote a story about Mr. Trump's contribution to the society? He has created thousands of jobs and even that women wouldn't be able to feed her family if he weren't there for her as a employer. Don't bite the hands that feeds you and your family. Don't vote for him but you have no right to campaign against him as you working for his company. May god will see how hypocrite you are.
14 | Jan Murray | 10155484494951509_1029315137177174 | And in other news, Hillary is not getting votes from her employees either - because except for her closest cronies, she has no employees - never created any jobs, never created value for the economy, and only generated income by talking.
15 | Sean McLaughlin | 10155484494951509_10155484526066509 | The summer before last well after Trump sold his Taj Mahal Casino in Atlantic City I went there with my father for a day trip. We asked all different workers there if Trump runs for POTUS if they would vote for him. All the ones we asked said, "No." Just saying. #DUMPTRUMP2016
16 | Edgar Solomon | 10155484494951509_10155484529211509 | I am scared of a man on the ground with his hands up, Madea, a 66 year old grandma swinging a bat, or a 10 yr old kid playing in the park or one walking home minding his own business, or a man that is running away from me, or one on the ground asking me to help him breathe..... I am just a scared spineless whinny little girl and that's why I am voting for TRUMP!!!!!
17 | Gary Parks | 10155484494951509_10155484524121509 | Omg CNN, what about Wikileaks (HRCs public and private stance), how about Veritas videos, what about the Supreme Court justice (possibly two) that states will retire if HRC comes into office, come on at least report equally, so ashamed in media nowadays.
18 | Gregory Leone | 10155484494951509_10155484512581509 | It's funny how all week CNN was reporting that Trump was down in Nevada. Now that they are broadcasting from Nevada and there's thousands of Trump supporters surrounding their broadcast, they've dropped Nevada from the list of states Trump is trailing in. You'd think that CNN would be smarter about the lies that they feed us. #CNNLIES
19 | William Belzil | 10155484494951509_10155484540651509 | Funny how they can deny that there could be election fraud when they are blaming Russia for attempting to do that very thing. If voter fraud was not possible why blame Russia ? And with the new vote fraud videos about the corruption in the Democratic party and their major manipulations of this election , it's apparent, they themselves, believe voter fraud is possible.
20 | Heather Peck | 10155484494951509_665020386995486 | I'm so afraid for his employees who have come out and admitted they're not voting for him because he's extremely vindictive and will probably fire all these people after the election, or maybe even before.
21 | Marina Martin | 10155484494951509_1029394437169244 | What this woman is showing is at difference of Mrs. Clinton who always collected a paycheck from the government, Mr. Trump risked his money in good or bad  business gave and continues to give jobs to people... How many people could keep their family together with jobs provided by Mrs. Clinton ?
22 | Tasha Feese | 10155484494951509_1029346840507337 | So the US should just allow illegal undocumented persons from all over the map just flock in hand over fist? Really? Does any other nation allow this ridiculousness? NO!! And it isn't racist to want people to come here legally it's called NATIONAL SECURITY
23 | Linda Fiabane Kirby Halfpop | 10155484494951509_10155484575911509 | Why..........does CNN have their commentary panel compete with SCREAMING bystanders in back of them??????? Seriously, I would like to hear the comments and arguments, not the intense screams......
24 | Dave Little Dave Cohen | 10155484494951509_10155484567841509 | Whichever fool at CNN decided to put the panel in front of that mob deserves to be sent back to Producer School!! When the panelists are talking over each other on top of the crowd, you have to be a lip reader to follow whats going on??
25 | Brent McDonald | 10155484494951509_10155484552456509 | Where is all of the negative articles on Hillary? I mean, you guys are having to dig DEEP for stuff on Donald J. Trump, there's plenty of surface dirt on Hillary that you refuse to show. I don't care who the people are for or against, the truth is, WE ALL WANT THE TRUTH ON BOTH SIDES! Do your job and report it all!

One clip includes a brief cameo from former President Bill Clinton. "We had a good time and he out-drove me all day long, but I forgive him," Clinton says in the clip.

1 | Dianne Noche Atienza | 10155484318256509_10155484331696509 | With the 2 presidential candidates, only Hillary is qualified to be the president. She has the experience(both positive and negative) in governing the country. Everybody learns from their mistakes, including Donald Trump. But Trump's experience and mistakes (when corrected), are not really applicable in governing the country. Trumps have the experience in governing his business, he can use that in managing FOX Network. It will be a shame to the world if he use it in running the USA. #PresidentHillaryClinton
2 | Alberto Ortiz | 10155484318256509_10155484331836509 | People, this is getting uglier and uglier by the minute! The indisputable reality today, 20 days to election day, indicates trump is behind by 9 points. Period.Trump is screaming "Fraud, Rigged, Fraud, Rigged, Fraud, Rigged," everyday since June 2015! This is a textboock definition of a deplorable “Instigator-In-Chief”, an unredeemable natural born whiner. Trump is sowing the seeds of emotions to a very peculiar crowd which is dying to have an excuse.There isn't such a thing as personality transplant. We will see this tonight. Trump will make sure his globalized brand name and only his brand name will prevail. Trump's closing argument will be : "I'm gonna lose but it is not my fault." Are you ready for “Trump News Channel”? It was a business trip for trump all along.I'm starting to think that this guy, trump, doesn't want to win after all. He knows that if he wins this election, in the end, he will turn out to be the worst republican frustration in the history of US, but if he loses, he will be known as the biggest fringe-republican myth in the history of US. There is a tacit confirmation in favor of this statement every time he opens his mouth. “Just be nice to me.“ What else to expect from a megalomaniac without a telepromter, or without a script written on a piece of paper by the establishment? What else to expect from a Roger Ailes’ enabler? I can’t wait to watch the debate.
3 | Tina Pulliam | 10155484318256509_10155484741711509 | Trump is always judging women based on their looks.... Look at this dude! He should be elated to have money. Otherwise he'd be a lonely, plump, ugly fella.
4 | James Shirley | 10155484318256509_10155484338226509 | bet he won't be golfing on the American dime all the time when he is potus, Obama has already set the record for most days spent playing golf while holding the presidential office , google it if you don't believe me
5 | Tim Koch | 10155484318256509_10155484511996509 | The PGA, with its ethnically and culturally diverse membership would be wise to put many miles between itself and this racist.

More government control, More lying media. Kiss the constitution good bye. Kiss you're guns good bye. Say hello to open borders, terrorism, Sharia Law, horrible schools, men using your daughter's bathrooms, horrible expensive health care. A week military, no help for veterans and most likely War with Russia.
7 | Kyle Williams | 10155484318256509_10155484318701509 | Scumbag Clinton, who is "for all women" is now known to pay old women, and mentally retarded people, to go to Trump rallies and get beat up and abused on camera... disgusting.
8 | Marilyn Aderman Lillard | 10155484318256509_10155484495161509 | REGARDLESS OF THE SCANDLES ON BOTH SIDES... Do you want open borders?  Our hospitals will be packed, our schools will be over crowded, our welfare benefits will go away, our housing destroyed, and our safety jeprodized.  Our prisons will be over flowing and we'll be lucky to find people to work as police officers!!!!!  Jobs will suffer.  In the meantime, she will live like a princess as none of this will affect her.
9 | Sarah Stiegel | 10155484318256509_10155485775246509 | 8 Generations ago my direct relative, Col. Christopher Truby risked his life fighting the British in the American Revolution.  Today, nearly 240+ years later I find myself saddened by the state of our great country.  I have always felt pride being an American, a patriot, however at this time I'm almost embarrassed and most definitely saddened.  Our country has regressed 270+ years to a state where we need to overthrow our governing body.  Don't you remember learning in American history "no taxation without representation".?  Don't you remember the pride you felt learning how our founding fathers drafted such amazing documents like the Declaration of Independence and most importantly the Constitution of the United States?  Our fore-fathers died for those documents, those beliefs.  Now today 270+ years later our basic rights that we fought for are at stake and it sickens me to see how many people are willing to throw it all away.  This election isn't about taxes, immigration, or abortion, this election is about our basic American rights.  We are at risk of losing our guaranteed rights thanks to a corrupt woman and her ulterior motives.  I'm voting for America, for our founding fathers, for our Bill of Rights, for our Freedoms, for the best country in the world.  This isn't about race/ethnicity this is about US, as Americans, standing up for US, the greatest nation of the modern world.  We need to bring back unity, we need to be proud Americans.  It's time to stand up, with our right hand over our heart and proudly state "one God, indivisible, in liberty and justice for ALL".  Protect our America, our freedom.  Vote TRUMP 2016
10 | David Norwood | 10155484318256509_10155484626891509 | Folks the reason the USA is in debt as the UK same reason muslim aid take all muslim aid stop it stop all aid going abroad for 10 years deport all muslims except those doing a job worth while employ everyone fit to work, remove gun control cut crime, 4th in world for murder remove where gun control is tightest 3rd from lowest murders hmm weird that Switzerland gun control is nothing and open carrying is the norm 2nd lowest in the world. hmm weird that, but the education of gun use is also important, remember the police can blow your brains out at a distance you won't even see the shooter.

14 | Bob Magee | 10155484318256509_10155484345571509 | As with the footage of Apprentice...perhaps Anonymous needs to pay Golf Channel an electronic visit, and tell them either YOU release the footage in question, or WE do it for you.
15 | Mike Liatto | 10155484318256509_10155484387191509 | They were buddies. Kinda makes you wonder if they didn't have a plan all along. Trump gets to build up a base for his new television network, Hillary gets into the Whitehouse, because if she was up against a real candidate she would be far behind. Totally plausible.
16 | David Norwood | 10155484318256509_10155484631896509 | Black lies matter will increase the amount of dead blacks as black guys get ruder to cops and more violent expecting to get away with it. not gonna happen.
17 | Isabel Alaniz | 10155484318256509_10155484473826509 | CNN has proven itself to be a pay-for-play manipulation platform, allowing the highest bidder to dictate the news agenda. "Journalistic Malpractice"
18 | Bryan Bonser | 10155484318256509_10155484767866509 | Why I'm voting for TrumpSix key policy differences inform my decision.First, and most important, the Supreme Court. For anyone concerned about the Bill of Rights — free speech, religious liberty, the Second Amendment — the Court hangs in the balance. We are only one justice away from losing our most basic rights, and the next president will appoint as many as four new justices. We know, without a doubt, that every Clinton appointee would be a left-wing ideologue. Trump, in contrast will appoint justices “in the mold of Scalia.”Trump has a very strong list of potential Supreme Court nominees — including Sen. Mike Lee, who would make an extraordinary justice — and making an explicit commitment to nominate only from that list. This commitment matters, and it provides a serious reason for voters to choose to support Trump.Second, Obamacare. The failed healthcare law is hurting millions of Americans. If Republicans hold Congress, leadership has committed to passing legislation repealing Obamacare. Clinton, we know beyond a shadow of doubt, would veto that legislation. Trump has will sign it.Third, energy. Clinton would continue the Obama administration’s war on coal and relentless efforts to crush the oil and gas industry. Trump will reduce regulations and allow the blossoming American energy renaissance to create millions of new high-paying jobs.Fourth, immigration. Clinton will continue and even expand Obama’s lawless executive amnesty. Trump will revoke those illegal executive orders.Fifth, national security. Clinton will continue the Obama administration’s willful blindness to radical Islamic terrorism. She will continue importing Middle Eastern refugees whom the FBI cannot vet to make sure they are not terrorists. Trump has will stop the deluge of unvetted refugees and secure our borders.Sixth, Internet freedom. Clinton supports Obama’s plan to hand over control of the Internet to an international community of stakeholders, including Russia, China, and Iran. Just this week, Trump came out strongly against that plan, and in support of free speech online.These are six vital issues where the candidates’ positions present a clear choice for the American people.
19 | Bill Lukas | 10155484318256509_10155484459281509 | Really? The headline should read CNN does not do balanced reporting on each candidate nor will CNN report on the corruption of Hillary Clinton.That's what the headline should really read
20 | John Connolly | 10155484318256509_10155484687066509 | It is well documented that in 1953, Nazi mind control experimentation under order by CIA Director Allen Dulles and headed by Sidney Gottlieb was integrated into the backrooms of CIA offices, College Psychiatric Departments, prisons and Mental Institutions. Following World War 2 after Operation Paperclip morphed into Operation Bluebird then into Operation Artichoke and Operation Midnight Climax finally becoming MK Ultra mind control as it is known today.In 1953 the CIA research budget allotted roughly 10 million dollars to be dedicated to human experimentation involving hypnosis and amnesia, utilizing the effects of heroin, morphine, barbiturates, amphetamine, LSD, BZ, scopolamine, and other hallucination causing compounds.In 1977, a FOIA request unearthed 20,000 documents related to MK Ultra after Frank Church and the Ford Administration began investigating the CIA in 1975.As the US Supreme Court later noted, MK ULTRA was: concerned with "the research and development of chemical, biological, and radiological materials capable of employment in clandestine operations to control human behavior." The program consisted of some 149 subprojects which the Agency contracted out to various universities, research foundations, and similar institutions. At least 80 institutions and 185 private researchers participated. Because the Agency funded MK Ultra indirectly, many of the participating individuals were unaware that they were dealing with the Agency.Fast forward to today. MK Ultra victims number in the tens of thousands. Hollywood culture celebrates MK Ultra as Illuminati symbolism, whether most people realize it or not. A dark web of sleeper assassins lie dormant due to ongoing MK Ultra experimentation. And sex slaves, their free will broken under extreme stress from MK Ultra experimentation, exist among the highest seats of power submitting to their handler’s bidding. That is why Cathy O’ Brien’s story, as inconceivable as it may be to the average American, is important today.As detestable as Trump’s indiscretions may appear to the average American through the lens of a monopolized and propagandized media that Goebbels would be proud of. Trump’s supposed war on women pales in comparison to the claims of rape, drug trafficking, and full blown racketeering made against the CIA backed Clinton crime family.

24 | Phillip Scott Spratt | 10155484318256509_10155484784881509 | I'm starting to fell sorry for the people that work for CNN. Think about it, I'm sure you'd have to lie when you're asked where you work... "do you work CNN?, nooo, I'm a Animal control office for the city of Ferguson"... lol
25 | Jimmy Cummins | 10155484318256509_10155484594801509 | The Republican Party was founded primarily to oppose slavery, and Republicans eventually abolishedslavery. The Democratic Party fought them and tried to maintain and expandslavery. The 13th Amendment, abolishing slavery, passed in 1865 with 100% Republican support but only 23% Democrat support in congress.Historians say the KKK consisted of a group of Southern whites after the Civil War who were Democrats. But there's no evidence the KKK was created by their political party.

"I don't believe he thinks he's going to win anymore - I think his whole focus now is on how he's going to deal with the loss." says Tony Schwartz, Donald J. Trump's former ghostwriter, referring to how the GOP candidate feels going into the last debate http://cnn.it/2e7kKVh

1 | Dana Shows | 10155484092281509_10155484112941509 | CNN is ridiculous... If he loses it will be because main stream media outlets refuse to report the ACTUAL news which is Hillary Clinton and her corruption that keeps flowing over EVERY SINGLE DAY!
2 | Zach Kerman | 10155484092281509_10155484096586509 | I am STILL voting for Trump - I'm not interested in his vulgar language - I'm interested in strong borders  - strong Military - strong economy. I want law and order - I want our Vets taken care of - I want Manufacturers to come back rebuild our inner cities get people back to work and off welfare.  I'm looking for our Allies to trust us again and our enemies to fear us again - I want lower taxes for people and businesses.   I want Americans to come first and be energy independent.   Hillary can provide none of that - it's that simple!
3 | Zach Kerman | 10155484092281509_10155484097061509 | I'm sick and tired of those who say Hillary has no great accomplishments. I would say staying out of prison for the crimes she committed in the last four decades is a great accomplishment.
4 | James Raymond | 10155484092281509_10155484145736509 | Donald Trump rallies have over 15 to 20 thousand people and Hillary Clinton barely can bring in 300. Now tell me the the logic. If Hillary Clinton wins it's a rig system but to me it doesn't matter because it's a circus that I've enjoyed watching for the last couple of months and when she becomes president and taxes go up 29% for everybody and the Constitution will be shredded , that's when it's going to get funny
5 | Tony Santangelo | 10155484092281509_10155484148831509 | This is unrelated to this post but I just wanted to say you folks at CNN are losing all credibility as a fair and balanced news organization. So much so that we have stopped watching almost entirely at our house. It's too bad too because you were once the only media outlet we felt we could trust.
6 | Lekan Oyeyemi | 10155484092281509_10155484100896509 | The saga of Julian Assange seems to be drawing to a climax – one that will decide the fate of this historic whistleblower who, for years, has been a giant thorn in the side of governments everywhere. If he goes down, then, in a sense, so do we all. Because what that means is that there’s no room for truth-tellers in our world, and no tolerance for heroes.
7 | Daniel Jimenez | 10155484092281509_10155484146106509 | Wikileaks gets mentioned and you stop the interview. Does the fact that the information was gained illegally make it any less true? Journalists real journalists would of been digging in on both candidates and informing the people. You and the rest of the hacks have sold out. Hardly a mention of the videos showing how to commit voter fraud by the DNC. You guys should of been the ones to bring the news out. It is clear that you are now a special interest group. I want to hear about both candidates you guys are so one sided it really is shameful.

Trump is not my cup of tea, but the media has been protection Clinton from day one. Does she need to practice for a debate for a  whole week or she is just hiding to see if we forget about the games she has been playing with the public.
11 | Chris Shipman | 10155484092281509_10155484164516509 | Yes keep using this BS propaganda to try to manipulate Trump supporters into thinking there's no way he can win in hopes that we give up and don't go vote. Guess what it's not working.
12 | Holly Porter | 10155484092281509_10155484124856509 | just because CNN thinks Hilary is going to win doesn't make it so!  There are a great deal of people who are sick of the corruption and crooks in Washington!!
13 | Ma Dukes | 10155484092281509_10155484122901509 | Trump Stomps All Over Mike Pence's Efforts To Clean Up 'Rigged Election' CommentsBaby Trump is on a perpetual temper tantrum and I'm tired of it. I'm also not giving an ounce of attention to Wikileaks emails, and Clinton's folks should not read or address them. Putin can jump in the lake, and we need to shut him down by enasculating his effort. Clinton should not answer anything re the email except to say she has not read them, is busy, will not read them, does not know their authenticity, and is moving on with her campaign. Trumptin is a traitor to this country, and should be barred from intelligence briefings. Trump is nasty and has been nasty. Not because he cheats on his wife. But because his mother never taught him to keep his hands off girls, and not to peek under girls' dresses. She should have washed out his mouth out with soap, told him "no" more often, and spanked him when he needed it. He is a spoiled, self centered, brat. People, teach your kids, whip them sometimes , and don't make excuses for them. Trump was not parented and that is his problem. My thoughts. Pence is a used car salesman.

15 | Dave Gillespie | 10155484092281509_10155484181441509 | You can't win a general election without winning the majority of women, Hispanics, African Americans, and white college educated voters. Trump has done well with his base of supporters, but it isn't expanding, and that equals losing! The facts are the facts!!! 38 percent just won't cut it!!!! Tonight is his last chance to win voters outside of his base, but screaming, insulting, and treating it like a reality show won't do it. He must stick to the issues tonight. Another clown show won't help. We shall see. Can't wait.
16 | Crystal Hall Cirillo | 10155484092281509_10155484199521509 | Corrupt Clinton's corrupt media and pollsters are trying so hard to alter the outcome of this election.#Trump is winning and will be our next president despite your corruption.
17 | Jason Leffert | 10155484092281509_10155484126046509 | I'm really not interested in what the biase media has to say is going to happen! They would have you believe Hillary is up 50 points, she's not even able to control her own Facebook page!#TRUMP2016
18 | Sam J Marquez | 10155484092281509_10155484158836509 | No watch it on fox where the moderator is from because these clowns here on CNN have been feeding the ignorant masses nothin but garbage and they gladly eat it. They are already calling the race for Hillary tell us CNN what does her 💩 taste/smell like because you're obviously all up in there and people need to ask themselves why.
19 | Chris Lawless | 10155484092281509_10155484213306509 | All of you keep talking about women's rights. Yet Hillary has Huma Abedin right by her side. The fascist muslim that believes in genital mutilation. How does that work out for you?
20 | Greg Hudson | 10155484092281509_10155484164511509 | Thanks CNN for trying to dictate how we should feel.  Not that I condone email hacking but it seems that the Obama administration knew what was about to go down with Assange and cut it off before Hillary was rocked changing the shape and hard work of what has been a media message driven campaign all in an effort to elect Hillary.
21 | Marty Banks | 10155484092281509_10155484152261509 | i turned on cnn and thought to myself this must be the hate trump network, switched to fox and thought the same thing....then i realized the networks spin the news any way that pleases the government......the government has become our enemy and the media is its prophet.
22 | Mary Mavros | 10155484092281509_10155484246496509 | Of course he's not going to win. He never should have gotten this far. He was a joke that got out of hand and thanks to his own disdainful personality, people are coming to their senses and realizing what kind of terrifying nightmare a Trump presidency could actually be.
23 | Joseph Esteves | 10155484092281509_871866879617436 | Why is anyone going to watch this debate. We all know Donald Trump is going to be rude and Arrogant. He has ZERO class. We know he is going to speak out or turn and interrupt. And we know tomorrow morning TRUMP and everyone of his Surrogates aka Cronies is going to say he won the debate. So again why are we watching it?
24 | Joel Merrylees | 10155484092281509_1164473160287125 | The Republican party needs to start thinking about the 9th. Out of office again, Supreme Court lost, majority is hanging by a thread,  all the while their voters point fingers at everyone under the sun while they stand on the smoldering ruins of their party. They can't run a single room without falling over themselves, but have these hallucinations that the country is giving them back the presidency. Very amusing.
25 | Lisa Davenport | 10155484092281509_1204780499597060 | That's what the Main Media is trying to do make you think he's losing, So you don't go out and vote.. Strategy Play. Why you think Obama has been out hitting hard for her..there has been more Republican voters  Registered then ever.. When have you ever seen so many voters come out to fill up Stadiums like this Never.. I know of so many Democrats are voting for him. And also new voters.. There are 15 in my immediate family alone. New ones. I won't believe until the Fat Lady Sings as the saying goes..wee all know what will happen to this Country if Hillary wins.. America no more as we know it...🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
