Most people think Hillary Clinton will win the election and Donald J. Trump won't concede, a new poll found

1 | M Hilal Arfeen | 10155509608741509_10155509611376509 | No one want to answer mental trump who's politics based on mocking everyone and also racism.Donald trump knew that he will be losing election after badly exposed in front of nation.Mental trump should go to mental hospital after humiliation in the politicsSay No To Trump
2 | Gary Doan | 10155509608741509_10155509609841509 | I have given Democrats far too much credit in the past. Everyone should realize the press is biased, but most Democrats deny it. I had assumed that some people were either naive or brainwashed, but now I'm starting to believe they appreciate and support our biased corrupt media. There no way bias is not noticeable at this point in time and I'm an deeply ashamed of all Democrats. - An Ex-Democrat.
3 | Flo McKay | 10155509608741509_10155509613216509 | "There are an awful lot of people out there who still think this is a conventional election, that we are choosing between two candidates on the basis of experience, policies, and character.This is not a conventional election. This is, as the late, great Andrew Breitbart put it, "war!"An all-out culture war.It's not a war that conservatives started or have ever wanted. It is a war that has been thrust on us. But if we don't treat it as a war, if we don't take it seriously as a war, we will lose and lose miserably. We will lose not just for the next four years, but for the next 40 years, and possibly the next 400 years.In other words, this is not a skirmish or a tiny battle, as the #NeverTrump crowd imagines. If we don't defeat the enemy in November, there may not be another chance for a long time to come.When you're at war, your tactics change considerably. For your leader, you don't want a gentleman warrior or an intellectual who is good at articulating ideas but not very good in the trenches. Those are peacetime leaders, perhaps, but not wartime generals. At time of war, you pick a general who is tough as nails and will lead you confidently into battle and be victorious. You choose someone who knows how important it is, as Winston Churchill said, to "Never give up! Never give up! Never, never, never-never-never-never!" The general you pick may be foul-mouthed, crude, or brusque. He may have any number of personal failings. Those things don't matter in war. What matters is:Is he on your side?Is he a fighter?Can he rally the troops?Can he weaken the opponent?Can he administer death blows when needed?Can he emerge victorious?In short, you need someone who is strong, fierce, and not easily taken down. Ironically, the Republican symbol of the elephant is the perfect metaphor – a creature who, on the one hand, is often seen as big, clumsy, and lovable, but who turns out to be of the most dangerous animals on Earth. A creature who has been known to be vindictive and can trample even a rhinoceros – so a donkey shouldn't be that hard.Is this Donald J. Trump?Absolutely. He has shown that no matter what dirt gets dug up and thrown at him, he will not back down. He is the first Republican candidate to come along in more than 25 years who isn't afraid to battle the Democrats – and the media – with the same firepower they bring into battle.Scott Adams, the creator of the cartoon Dilbert, has written extensively on the "persuasion" elements of this election and says that Trump's temperament is predictable, that "when Trump counter-attacks, he always responds with equal measure. Words are met with words and scandal mentions are met with scandal mentions. (And maybe a few words.) But always proportionate and immediate."So what we are seeing, and what we may see for the remainder of the campaign, is Trump responding in full force to the media and the left-wing onslaught.In short, he's bringing out the big guns.But he's bringing out the big guns because that's what the other side already has aimed at him.Consider the 2005 video of Trump's lewd comments. The Democrat-controlled media thought they could take Donald Trump down and end his candidacy for good by airing the video two days before the second presidential debate. But, unlike almost every other Republican you can name, Trump didn't back down. He came out swinging.Debate moderator Anderson Cooper called Trump's 2005 comments "sexual assault," and said, "You bragged that you have sexually assaulted women. Do you understand that?"Trump corrected him and subtly undercut the claim: "No, I didn't say that at all. I don't think you understood what was said. This was locker room talk." He then apologized to his family and the American public and masterfully switched the subject:You know, when we have a world when you have ISIS chopping off heads and frankly drowning people in steel cages, where you have so many bad things happening … we should get onto much more important things and much bigger things.The moderators and the Democrats were stunned that their many shots at Trump did not succeed. He outgunned them at every turn. When he said Hillary should be in jail, they were reeling. No one has ever gone after Hillary the way Trump has. Now, having failed round one, the left has brought out even bigger guns – women who claim that Trump groped them and sexually assaulted them on numerous occasions going back to the 1980s.But once again, Trump will not be taken down easily. At a speech in West Palm Beach, Florida, he went on offense almost immediately."These people are horrible people. They're horrible, horrible liars," he said of the women accusing him. "And interestingly, it happens to appear 26 days before our very important election."He challenged the account of one woman, Jessica Leeds, who claims that Trump touched her on a first-class flight to New York more than 30 years ago and was "like an octopus." Trump's response: "Another ridiculous tale. No witnesses. No nothing."He cast aspersion on People magazine reporter Natasha Stoynoff, who claimed that Trump forced her against a wall and tried to kiss her in 2005, when she was interviewing Trump and his wife, Melania, in 2005. Donald Trump pointed out the "area was a public area – people all over the place."But the media is again trying to slay the elephant. For example, CNN senior media correspondent Brian Stelter immediately jumped into the fray, calling Trump's speech "paranoid" and "dangerous."This is war, ladies and gentlemen. It's not a conventional election, and it's not a gentlemen's disagreement or a skirmish or a fistfight. You can't sit at home with popcorn and enjoy the show, because eventually the lights will come up, and we will be saddled with either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump for four years.If it's Hillary, then you can gird yourself for what will surely be daily battles over guns, free speech, Supreme Court nominees, higher taxes, more immigration, more years of a bad economy, and a multitude of other bad decisions.Or you can take your chances with the elephant, Donald J. Trump.Whose side on you on?
4 | Mark van Kranenburg | 10155509608741509_10155509613911509 | I'm going to lose so bigly. It's incredible. Many people are telling me that my biggest asset is the way I lose. My loss is gonna be yuge; that I can tell you, folks.
5 | Alex Vogel | 10155509608741509_10155509612206509 | At this point Trump is blowing it so "bigly" and destroying the Republican party at the same time I'm starting to think he's on the Clintons' payroll.
6 | Virginia Perez | 10155509608741509_10155509611446509 | If you're like me, the sight and sound of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump make you want to vomit. There is a solution, it's called working the electoral college against them both. It's going to take guts. Here is how, if you live in a state that does not require write in registration (Vermont, Wyoming, Oregon, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Iowa, Delaware, and Alabama) you write in Bernie. This will remove those states from the electoral map which makes it easier for a third party candidate to win enough electoral votes with the other states. Everyone else, if your state is mostly blue, vote Jill Stein. If your state is mostly red, vote Gary Johnson. This should swing the majority vote to the third party candidate in most cases. Neither Jill Stein or Gary Johnson are perfect candidates, but Clinton and Trump sure as heck aren't either. But Stein and Johnson are less likely to kill us or get us killed. Bernie would get a total of 49 electoral votes, if people did this it would kick it right over to the House who would choose from the top three. Trump and Clinton would not be president. Trump and Clinton are political poison to US House Reps who are up for election every two years. Beyond that, there is no guarantee Trump and Clinton will both be in the top three if people follow through with this, could be Bernie, Stein and Johnson. Like I said it's going to take guts but if we don't try we're weak and we will end up with Trump or Clinton anyway. The Founding Fathers gave us an out for a reason and this is it.
7 | Matthew Schmalz | 10155509608741509_10155509612026509 | Sorry Trump supporters, she's winning and there's nothing you can do to stop it.
8 | Richard Takizawa | 10155509608741509_10155509612301509 | If Trump wins the election replacing Obama, then America will turn to be a comedy show. The title is "Orange is the New Black"
9 | Jeremy Smith | 10155509608741509_10155509614121509 | I knew she would win after Bernie was broken down...and how..of course she is going to win.
10 | Thomas Noble | 10155509608741509_10155509613986509 | Well everyone I know is voting Trump so apparently no one has Polled upstate NY
11 | San Sar | 10155509608741509_10155509611101509 | Most people think she's a liar and CNN is paid to endorse her.
12 | Anthony Holzhauser | 10155509608741509_10155509612476509 | Must be the dead people that are voting that think Hillary will win.
13 | Philip Gonzalez Sr. | 10155509608741509_10155509613306509 | Polls aren't jiving with early voter turnout. He's ahead in Arkansas,north Carolina,Florida. Polls are rigged obviously by the media that had dinner at Hillary's house.
14 | Ronald Tarasiewicz | 10155509608741509_10155509614216509 | No conspiracies, just 16 states with Soros funded voting machines. Move along now.
15 | Sreejith Surendranadh | 10155509608741509_10155509612506509 | Lets discuss about some thing else : The richest man ever lived John D. Rockefeller had a fortune of $663,400,000,000 in today's money.
16 | Jamie Dawn Plummer | 10155509608741509_10155509611966509 | You do know polls mean nothing right? Just because someone says something means nothing. Until it's on paper and counted it is worthless.
17 | Hans Neil | 10155509608741509_10155509610216509 | Stopping Trump for president is a short term solution. The long term solution and the most difficult one is fixing the educational system that created so many ignorant enough to vote for Trump.
18 | The Truth is Here | 10155509608741509_10155509613091509 | Dear person reading this,I hope your day has been going well, if not, I hope it gets better You are an amazing person who will inspire others to do great things so keep up the hard work. FOLLOW US TO LEARN THE TRUTH !

1 | Ali Haider Nazir | 10155509519486509_10155509537836509 | Why the corporations don't invent self using robots that'll self purchase their crap? If they are so reluctant to hire humans then without jobs how humans will afford to buy their garbage?
2 | Darlene Holtsclaw | 10155509519486509_10155509540886509 | Seems wrong at every level, machines malfunctions, computer boards fry, deer pop up, roads floods, detour signs, with the road washed out, highway road construction, on and on, how come if a truck can drive without anyone at the wheel, we have to be tested, driving test, drunk driving and insurance checks. Alway the big red ball that bounces into the street to have a little kid chasing it or a kid on a bike who is not watching. Scarey to me to think about all this. LOL.
3 | Adrian Esteban | 10155509519486509_10155509577351509 | Great!!! another way for truck drivers to loose their jobs. I guess low salaries wasn't enough, now this... And I wonder what's gonna happen when the truck malfunctions or you have heavy rain or snow, not even considering   winds... Machines can't react the same way...
4 | Kenneth Junior | 10155509519486509_10155509561571509 | Think of how many people this will put out of work,think of all the people who won't be able to afford the crap these driverless truck deliver.
5 | Dolores Liebner Dicicco | 10155509519486509_10155509558046509 | Terry McAuliffe sought out Jill McCabe to run because her husband was overseeing the investigation of Hillary's emails. This is the biggest scandal at the highest level of our Government. CNN colluded with Hillary Clinton, gave her debate questions, etc. You are not journalists. You channel is a joke.
6 | Dolores Liebner Dicicco | 10155509519486509_10155509545786509 | Why isn't your news about this? Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe’s political action committee donated nearly $500,000 to the election campaign of Dr. Jill McCabe--the wife of an FBI official who helped oversee the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server while secretary of state, the Wall Street Journal first reported.And the Virginia Democratic Party, a group over which the governor has considerable influence, contributed an additional $207,778 in the form of mailers, the campaign finance records indicate. The WSJ noted that this put donations from entities directly under McAuliffe or influenced by him at nearly $700,000, which was about a third of McCabe’s total campaign fundraising efforts. McAuliffe also reportedly recruited McCabe for the race.
7 | Larry Dise | 10155509519486509_10155509558086509 | I think if the US would stop giving all the money,food,housing,medical care,education,all the tax cuts,no taxes on the business,welfare,food stamps,to the immigrants,maybe then we can take care of the American citizens.
8 | Eugene Rickie. Washington III | 10155509519486509_10155509528176509 | Here come the Hilary haters to complain. On a post about a beer delivering truck
9 | Brian Monroe | 10155509519486509_10155509548176509 | Hmm first thought I had when watching this would be: what about in rain/ snow storms? Not entirely sure I would feel safe being anywhere near one of these..
10 | Rex Bishop Sr. | 10155509519486509_10155509572326509 | Well get ready to die on the roads, you have a fully loaded truck which weighs around a hundred tons running down the road 60 to 70 mph with no driver ?? Doesn't these sound daft ?? How many times have you had problems with a computer ??
11 | Wendell Thayne | 10155509519486509_10155509601726509 | Trucks will still need somebody to chain tires,drive in snow monitor a hazardous load and reroute if a road is closed. This truck only traveled 130 miles in good weather and still had a driver onboard to monitor it. Lots of legal questions too. Who gets sued if cargo spoils or there is an accident? We might see these on long interstate trips but driving two lanes or through city traffic maybe not.Will we want unmanned trucks with sulfuric acid roaming our highways? Beer is one thing, an unmanned truck loaded with high explosives is another.
12 | Shawn Cooney | 10155509519486509_10155509601911509 | Omg i hope this self driven auto truck stuff is just a fad and goes away kind of like the hydrogen car. It's possible but not practical...
13 | Christopher Villarreal | 10155509519486509_10155509545891509 | Sue Trevino tell uncle Michael that he needs to hurry up and retire before its too late for him to drive the Budweiser truck! lol
14 | Brent Leach | 10155509519486509_10155509532196509 | So who unloads it? The truck magically takes the order in the store? As a store employee I wouldn't be unloading the truck. That's the vendors responsibility
15 | Dean Mueller | 10155509519486509_10155509579916509 | So, millions of jobs are about to be automated. New trade agreements are going to suck an enormous number of jobs away from the American worker, while we bring in millions of their unwanted citizens. We have 20 to 30 million illegal immigrants who may be given amnesty soon (making them eligible for full benefits). Whoever is in charge of this government should not only be kicked out of office, but the country as well. We need to end this union and tell Washington to go to hell.
16 | Dave Cammilleri | 10155509519486509_10155509585836509 | America willBe sitting here one day and we have outsourced everything. People will have no jobs and other countries will be laughing at us.
17 | J Esko Williams | 10155509519486509_10155509592971509 | I mean whos at work and says I don't feel like driving. Can they make a machine so i don't have to work. Then i could move to Hawaii
18 | Debbie Reed Ramey | 10155509519486509_10155509593381509 | Self driving trucks, cars etc that can possibly put truckers out of a job but yet we can't find a cure for the common cold, flu or cancer that sound about right. Not.
19 | Gabriel James | 10155509519486509_10155509552701509 | What?! Where's the Trump bashing, CNN? That's usually your top segment. BTW, did anyone get fired for giving Clinton the questions a day ahead of time for the town hall between HRC and Bernie Sanders?
20 | Diane Reardon | 10155509519486509_10155509539766509 | donalds friend lawyer is mexican or spanish and she is good she is his true friend. even some black people on there for donald . on cnn you make it look like all people dislikes him not so
21 | Zaquarinius Jacoby | 10155509519486509_10155509543101509 | pretty soon America won't have people anymore... just in the underground... robots will repair robots... robots will fight the wars... robots! robots! robots! robot wives... robot husbands... robot teachers... ohhh... how bitter is the truth~ they know everythingeverything working perfectly for no one... or maybe the humans will become more like the animals... and society will outgrow them
22 | Diane Reardon | 10155509519486509_10155509534246509 | if hilary gets white house hope not she cannot get her friends do all her work it is crazy. sure donald says things but if he listens to alot of good people to calm down and do as he says like his manager he will win

25 | Adam Lasales | 10155509519486509_10155509573536509 | It seems the articles against trump are slowing down to little to none on CNN and ABC. Makes me think he might have this election, and they are trying to back peddle as quickly as possible.

It's Americans VS globalistsA socialist state by Hillary:''' ...Hillary Clinton did her college thesis on....How to create a social state by Saul Alinsky:There are 8 levels of control that must be obtained before you are able to create a social state.The first is the most important.1) Healthcare — Control healthcare and you control the people2) Poverty — Increase the Poverty level as high as possible, poor people are easier to control and will not fight back if you are providing everything for them to live.3) Debt — Increase the debt to an unsustainable level. That way you are able to increase taxes, and this will produce more poverty.4) Gun Control — Remove the ability to defend themselves from the Government. That way you are able to create a police state.5) Welfare — Take control of every aspect of their lives (Food, Housing, and Income).6) Education — Take control of what people read and listen to — take control of what children learn in school.7) Religion — Remove the belief in the God from the Government and schools.8) Class Warfare — Divide the people into the wealthy and the poor. This will cause more discontent and it will be easier to take (Tax) the wealthy with the support of the poor.Now, think ...Does any of this sound like what is happening to the United States?

This election is about we the people taking back the power from our corrupt, elitist government. The reason the Republicans, the Democrats, and the Media are so against Trump is not because of who he is, its because of what he represents. He represents the voice of the people. This election was supposed to be Hillary vs Jeb Bush. The people are tired of the 1% at the top pulling all the strings. On the Republican side we said you were putting Donald Trump in there. On the Democrats side they tried to put Bernie up there but were stifled by a corrupt and rigged DNC headed by Debbie Wassermann Shultz and Hillary Clinton. The powers to be are very very scared of we the people when we stand together. In this election, Donald Trump is really irrelevant. this election is not about him or Hillary. This election is about we the people taking our government back! Remember that on November 8th'

Donald J. Trump speaking at his golf course in Doral, Florida: "All of my employees are having a tremendous problem with Obamacare." http://cnn.it/2er5CCt
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Brie Jaxton | 10155509294111509_10155509306991509 | So wait.. if all of his employees are having tremendous problems with Obamacare, does that mean his company doesn't provide health insurance? hmmmm...
2 | Dave Palermo | 10155509294111509_10155509321801509 | All of your employees should have good health insurance through your "highly successful" companies Trump. If they don't, it's your fault. Time for them to work somewhere else.
3 | Terry Teresa | 10155509294111509_10155509313266509 | Many of Your employees are on Temporary Workers visas, that you applied for in July, and don't have the right to healthcare, which is why you hire them. The workers you do have, and are able to vote, AREN'T Voting for you, so it's obvious what they have a problem with.
4 | Kelvin Marten | 10155509294111509_10155509314071509 | Does that mean he's not providing his employees with health insurance? I believe Obamacare is only for those with no health insurance.
5 | Richard Anastasio | 10155509294111509_10155509319961509 | You'd think that a billionaire would offer his employees healthcare then they wouldn't need to go out on the healthcare exchange for insurance. Guess he cares more about HIS money that their problems!
6 | William Martin | 10155509294111509_10155509317596509 | Um....if your employees are on Obama care that means not only do you not provide them health insurance, you also don't pay them very much....
7 | Jaimee Brown Holdgate | 10155509294111509_10155509303861509 | If you only get your information from one source then dont vote. Educate yourself, gather information from multiple sites on both parties. And if after you've educated yourself and you still vote for Hillary.....then go back to school....someone did you a disservice.
8 | Tessa Brackin | 10155509294111509_10155509313051509 | Maybe he should provide better coverage for his employees then... If he's as rich as he claims and does as well with his businesses as he claims, it shouldn't be a problem.
9 | Laurie Boettcher | 10155509294111509_10155509304591509 | Why is he not providing his employees with insurance? Why are they on Obamacare?
10 | Danka Danuta | 10155509294111509_10155509321096509 | How does one have problems with ACA if they are employed full time... Does trumpobnot provide health insurance to his employees?
11 | Mark Singh | 10155509294111509_10155509321621509 | Two scenarios here:1. He does not provide healthcare for his employees, which is incorrect. 2. He does not know how Obamacare works.
12 | Michele Borucki | 10155509294111509_10155509325346509 | Well then why the hell do you not offer them health insurance? Employers like you are the reason the affordable care act exist. He's such a waste.
13 | Yuniel Molina | 10155509294111509_10155509342106509 | Maybe they wouldn't if he offered a good employer-paid health insurance benefit like any reputable company. Did you ever think about that Trump? #DumpTrump
14 | Blakeney Adams | 10155509294111509_10155509300366509 | Everyone, including myself, gets on social media and bashes the candidate they don't like. I do it to laugh at the responses and to watch heads explode with idiotic responses, but imagine this.What if Americans voted the outsider, Donald Trump, into the office of POTUS and then voted out every last single established career politician and replaced them with new blood. Replaced with Republican and Democratic leaders who owed nothing to no one except the American people. A fresh start for America with politicians that cared about you, your family, the laws and the Constitution. How great would that be for a change?Feel free to share this.
15 | Jill Cederburg | 10155509294111509_10155509319056509 | Why would Trump's employees have a problem with Obamacare? Does he keep them all part time so his company doesn't have to provide them health insurance options?
16 | Tracy Vest | 10155509294111509_10155509326561509 | Maybe if his company provided health care for his employees it would not be such a "tremendous" problem and they would not have to sign up for national healthcare.  Perhaps with all the money he saves by stiffing his employees and contractors, he can go out and buy a thesaurus so he can retire tremendous.
17 | Donald LaFace | 10155509294111509_10155509324631509 | In the states with Republican governors Obama care is in trouble , why do you think that is? The governor of Florida will do anything in his power to make sure that Obama care fails rather than improve the system.
18 | Doug Bransfield | 10155509294111509_1598923737071276 | They have to be offered insurance you clowns by payroll laws because his companies are over 50 EE's. They have the right to decline. If they decline, they need to go out to the open market which is supposedly is cheaper insurance called the infamous 'Obamacare'..Get a clue before making assumptions they don't get health insurance offered.. If he doesn't offer it, he can get a penalty of up to 3k per employee. Go learn about ACA- which half of you by the comments have no clue what that means...
19 | Sherry Marie Hanmore | 10155509294111509_10155509313836509 | state farm health insurance is a few bucks less than obamacare !!! GET RID OF OBAMACARE!!! Obamacare fining poor working families for not being able to afford something to begin with !!!!!! FORCED SERVICES , this should be illegal !
20 | Linda Lockwood | 10155509294111509_10155509343476509 | i have Obama care. i can't afford to go to the doctor. with a 6000 dollar deductible,, you may as well as figure your going to pay highest amounts for any care allowed. and consider your self screwed. only way its any good is if you have a hospital stay then you have a out of pocket bill of 6,000 plus all the co pays. doenst cover dental vision or hearing. it sucks. and thats for one person. if i was to put my husband on my plan. it would take pretty much my entire check just for the premium. and bankruptcy for the deductible.
21 | Diaz Raul | 10155509294111509_10155509326131509 | Trumps employees have used their own voice numerous times and their complaints arent about obama care. They think trump isnt a good person. His own employees. No foreshadowing there. Mind you, i want trump elected.
22 | Reina Cintron | 10155509294111509_1672206729736494 | Well I guess the mighty Trump does not offered insurance benefits to his people. Trump is such a hypocrite. Do not understand why people want to vote for him.
23 | Patricia Shoemaker | 10155509294111509_1598923190404664 | So Trump doesn't pay taxes and doesn't provide health insurance for his employees?  But his doors and toilets etc are covered with gold (I saw a tour of his house on TV). He is just for himself. Unbelievable. I am still amazed that some people hate Hillary so much they'd rather vote for this piece of trash :-( he has nothing to offer to this country.
24 | Lori Smith | 10155509294111509_1150634098350861 | Clearly he doesn't know how Obamacare works, who it benefits, and why full time employees of his hotel wouldn't have a clue about the intricacies of the ACA.
25 | Eileen Morales | 10155509294111509_10155509325601509 | Well how about these jobs start paying a livable wage and everyone can afford healthcare because depending on Medicare or CCBH isn't solving the problem either. Us tax payers still pay for that too 😒

2 | Deshawn Branch | 10155509213651509_10155509220856509 | They should do this nationwide. Every law abiding citizen should own a gun or two.

5 | Barry McCurry | 10155509213651509_10155509344021509 | Sign me up. A lot of you guys think this is a "trunk of the car" type of deal where they hand a gun to any customer.  They still have to go through the proper channels to take possession of the gun. Un-bunch your panties, liberals.
6 | Dolores Liebner Dicicco | 10155509213651509_10155509564896509 | Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe’s political action committee donated nearly $500,000 to the election campaign of Dr. Jill McCabe--the wife of an FBI official who helped oversee the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server while secretary of state, the Wall Street Journal first reported.And the Virginia Democratic Party, a group over which the governor has considerable influence, contributed an additional $207,778 in the form of mailers, the campaign finance records indicate. The WSJ noted that this put donations from entities directly under McAuliffe or influenced by him at nearly $700,000, which was about a third of McCabe’s total campaign fundraising efforts. McAuliffe also reportedly recruited McCabe for the race.
7 | Will Crighton | 10155509213651509_10155509311886509 | Of the homicides for which the FBI received weapons data, most (67.8 percent) involved the use of firearms. Handguns comprised 72.5 percent of the firearms used in murder and nonnegligent manslaughter incidents in 2011. In 2011, in incidents of murder for which the relationships of murder victims and offenders were known, 54.3 percent were killed by someone they knew (acquaintance, neighbor, friend, boyfriend, etc. Of the female murder victims for whom the relationships to their offenders were known, 36.5 percent were murdered by their husbands or boyfriends.

10 | Andrew Hitchcock | 10155509213651509_10155509469011509 | Im all for having restrictions on guns, if you are a criminal you should not be allowed to own or possess a fire arm, there should be some sort of background check for anyone trying to buy any type of assault rifle. However im also up for putting restrictions on the first amendment as well, if you burn or step on my flag, talk bad about my country you should  never be allowed to have any government assitance, if you are on government programs and violate that rule you must be immediatley taken off of it along paying back all that you have borrowed.
11 | Louie Kneitz | 10155509213651509_10155509464451509 | God Bless America when citizens have teh ability to do one stop shopping. Elect Trump / Pence and keep these option available. Hilary will out an end to them. She's going to try to abolosih our second amendment rights. And those that dont vote for her if she is elected, and that iss only with the help of fraud, will be restricted to dial up internet.
12 | Marion Donnelly | 10155509213651509_10155509256951509 | How commenters to this story managed to work Donald and Hillary into it just fascinates me. I guess any forum will do for those who must rant constantly.
13 | Yan Ack | 10155509213651509_10155509287906509 | guns are implements that are supposed to kill ppl. Can the ppl who buy guns, who love guns, realise the enormity of the criminal nature of their love for this object ? to love a gun, you must essentially be insane, you can't be a normal person to love such a thing. One can't excuse their having a gun on the grounds of self protection. Billions of ppl around the world live without guns, without dogs, they just live. They're not killed, they don't even think of such things.
14 | Vickie Clark | 10155509213651509_10155509218121509 | CNN do you cover all the wonderful things Trump has done to truly help people?

1 | Steven Gonzales | 10155509113921509_10155509180021509 | They should consider painting it with that clear substance that San Francisco has started painting on their walls. It repels urine and splashes it back to its owner.
2 | Dan Golding | 10155509113921509_10155509141206509 | This should delight all of you liberal Democrat Communist. Anything to destroy religion...and don't even begin to tell me that Democrats are Christians too, because that is impossible if you support Hillary Clinton and watch and believe everything that CNN (aka Pravda II, U. S. communist version).
3 | Tim Platte | 10155509113921509_10155509179621509 | No respect for anything.....Even if you aren't a Christian, at least have enough human decency to respect other's beliefs and not desecrate their house of worship.Human decency.....what am I thinking?  There's no such thing.
4 | Amber Silva | 10155509113921509_10155509182721509 | I'm an atheist, I don't personally care about the religious part of this story, but what a shame because churches are so beautiful, and the historic aspect. They should put up an electric barrier lmao that'll teach 'em when they go to urinate on it.
5 | Cathy L Clark | 10155509113921509_10155509132801509 | To all my Facebook friends, I tell you this because I care, Events in recent years, weeks days are leading up to two things-WW3 and the coming of Christ. IN what sequence, at what time, I do not know. It's imminent. Syria s the catalyst. You need to do these things- enjoy every moment, stock up on supplies in your basement and MOST OF ALL warm people to get right with God. It won't be the end of the world, but a challenge to stay alive. BUT You are guarenteed to be alive forever in Christ if you just repent and believe. You can laugh at me or simplyGoogle on reliable sources Russia and US relations and the Ezekiel 38th war and the players.
6 | Stephanie Carriker | 10155509113921509_10155509207646509 | I will say I saw more people urinating on the streets in Europe when I was there for 2 weeks last July then I had seen doing the same here in Texas in my entire life.  I will never go back to Brussels, Belgium because the entire city wreaked of urine, one fountain we walked by was completely filled with urine. Maybe it could be because in Texas you get charged with indecent exposure and possibly put on the sex offenders list instead of a $50- $100 fine?  Amsterdam had ample public urinals which helped a lot, but they lacked a place for women to relieve themselves, albeit the problem is not women urinating in the streets.

Im of the opinion that earth is just a toilet bowl that REAL intelligent life dumps its waste. Humans destroy EVERYTHING. Even the very planet they live on.

16 | Tai Vo Tan Tai | 10155509113921509_10155509201731509 | i read some of the comments and find it so disgusting and idiotic even for an atheist like myself, they cheer up for destroy of a world wonder artificial just to proved they don't believe in god, what if i told you that no one give a sh*t of what you belived in christianity, atheist or Muslim anymore but did you read the article, this is the world tallest church since 1377 cheering for the destruction of marvel construction like that enough to prove how ignorant you are and yet you proudly call yourself an intelligent atheist i think you dumb than a dog even a dog know where to pee properly.
17 | Vicki Spencer Beatty | 10155509113921509_10155509191511509 | Hey CNN let's tell the truth about obamacare!!!!! My premium has skyrocketed....way more!!!! Please quit being biased and report truth in this serious matter.
18 | Fred Wallick | 10155509113921509_10155509482306509 | The real DEFCON is not known to the general public...there is a DEFCON website, but its based on known world conditions and tries to calculate what the real DEFCON would be.
19 | Stan Gilbert | 10155509113921509_10155509185621509 | That must be a lot of PEE ... Is there no toilets or trees near by, maybe the Church need to install public toilets, its a lot cheaper than rebuilding a crumbling church. Are they sure it's not age that destroying the Church and they need to blame it on something else. Noting is built to last forever.
20 | Richard Chadwell | 10155509113921509_10155509144941509 | Is this church accommodating political correctness, or changing its church doctrine so that it is directly contradicting biblical doctrine? Maybe this is a sign that the church needs to change back to its glory and stop making excuses for sinners, instead of leading them to salvation thru our lord Jesus Christ! O:)
21 | Dakota Foy | 10155509113921509_10155509423421509 | oh yes peeing in public is more common in Europe I went to Amsterdam and drunk girls outside bars everywhere just letting it flow disgusting.
22 | Steve Miklewicz | 10155509113921509_10155509270196509 | So pray for stronger churches or wrap the frigen thing in saran wrap, either way this pisses people off way too much urine or your out. =]

I never found out who let the Dogs Out...where's the beef...how to get to Sesame Street... why Dora doesn't just use Google Maps...Why do all flavors of fruit loops taste exactly the same......why eggs are packaged in a flimsy paper carton, but batteries are secured in plastic that's tough as nails...why women can't put on mascara with their mouth closed... why "abbreviated" is such a long word... why lemon juice is made with artificial flavor yet dish-washing liquid is made with real lemons... why they sterilize the needle for lethal injections... and, why do you have to "put your two cents in" but it's only a "penny for your thoughts" where's that extra penny going to... why do The Alphabet Song and Twinkle Twinkle Little Star have the same tune... why did you just try to sing those two previous songs... and just what is Victoria's secret?"

1 | Jessica Blake | 10155509005541509_10155509020016509 | Does everything have to be shared on social media? Some things should be kept private rather than letting them go public. But I think that's only my opinion...
2 | Evert de Jong | 10155509005541509_10155509037936509 | How ironic, CNN posting something about breaking a law, even while their candidate breaks the law approximately 30 times a year, great journalism...........
3 | Louis Elias | 10155509005541509_10155509026611509 | We the People MUST put a stop to this corrupted and broken political system. We the People have a Voice and its Donald Trump. I encourage everyone to get out and vote, not registered then Get registered and Don't go on your own Take family members a Friend or Neighbour get out there and Vote Donald J. Trump this is the most important election in the History of this Nation. We the People will make our voice heard. This crooked establishment must be brought down
4 | Bridget Ann Yates | 10155509005541509_10155509034506509 | You're not suppose to photograph or share your COMPLETED ballot! And really, who cares?There are bigger fish to fry out in this f'd up world.
5 | Joseph S. Holmes | 10155509005541509_10155509023916509 | OMG "It's burst into flames! Get out of the way! please! Oh my, this is terrible... Oh, the humanity! ... and all the Voters"
6 | Kai Crystal | 10155509005541509_10155509030866509 | I don't think he should be given into trouble, if anything this will probably make more ppl vote. Good on him for encouraging people to get out there and vote. X
7 | David Stoia | 10155509005541509_10155509050221509 | Not to be confused with Justin Bieber, let's cut this guy some slack. If this selfie is illegal then so should be mainstream media's exceedingly biased, misleading, and exaggerative coverage of the candidates.
8 | Kat Vorhauer | 10155509005541509_10155509174441509 | It does not matter what we think.CNN is pro Hillary.If law enforcement is pro Hillary and Justin posted he voted for trump which I could not read out of the article he might get in trouble, that's how corrupt this whole election is.
9 | Richard McDonald | 10155509005541509_10155509103366509 | This has to stop! Does it matter if it's Justin Timberlake? I think with Trump running in this race people are just proud to be American and vote! I'm a Trump voter! And if somebody says there for Hillary I tell him to vote! But vote for trump! lol
10 | Aaron Futrell | 10155509005541509_10155509060181509 | It does not show who he voted for so no he did not do anything illegal if he took a pic of his ballot that would be a major issue
11 | Haricot Jane KR Starr | 10155509005541509_10155509119221509 | Do not be complacent -vote. And tell us about it enthusiastically. But do not take pictures of your ballot or in the voting booth. It is illegal.  (For good reasons- as evil people could use ballot photos in evil ways).   💙💙💙💙💙💙
12 | RJ Sepulveda | 10155509005541509_10155509167831509 | You know what should be more illegal? Making voting machines that we KNOW for a fact can be Hacked and then just ignoring that fact because our company has a contract out for them with our corrupt government.
13 | Melissa Lyn | 10155509005541509_10155509043301509 | So full of crap CNN. Just like you told everyone it was illegal to read wikileaks but it is ok for CNN to read Wikileaks.... F you CNN.
14 | David Weller | 10155509005541509_10155509207811509 | I feel that he did not break any voting laws. you cannot read anything on the screen or his voting card. I can understand if you could view who he was voting for, but you cannot. I think this is a good picture and a good why to get people out to vote. You never know who you might be in line with
15 | Kenneth H Gragert | 10155509005541509_10155509060186509 | Trump needs to run the ads Obama ran against Hillary during their primary campaign...The ads show him calling her a liar and all this stuff...
16 | Cook Von Shizerman | 10155509005541509_10155509094001509 | during the primaries me and a buddy of mine both wrote in his name and posted the picture on facebook... yeah, it was a joke but we really did both vote for my buddy in the Presidential Primary and people got absolutely livid with us!  some people were threatening legal action against us, but of course no one did anything
17 | Mary Waisanen | 10155509005541509_10155509247706509 | There are several states that allow ballot selfies. ABC has an article on which states allow which types of selfies. For example, Hawaii allows you to take a photo of your own marked ballot. Virginia has no law against taking any photos in the polling station, be it of themselves, fellow voters or their ballots. Each state is different. In Tennessee the law states specifically no photos or videos in the polling station, phones can only be used for informational purposes to vote. So, it's not illegal everywhere. Check your own states laws.
18 | Gretta Michellé | 10155509005541509_10155509078151509 | It is illegal in some states not all ... and quite frankly, I don't see what the big deal is, if you want t selfie, who cares! If you want to share aspects of your life via social media, who cares, no one is required to view it ... or comment
19 | Luke Arthur Rees | 10155509005541509_10155509147606509 | No mention of Obama care going through the roof upwards of 122 percent,wowYou have to watch Fox News to find these things out.
20 | Dolores Liebner Dicicco | 10155509005541509_10155509568001509 | Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe’s political action committee donated nearly $500,000 to the election campaign of Dr. Jill McCabe--the wife of an FBI official who helped oversee the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server while secretary of state, the Wall Street Journal first reported.And the Virginia Democratic Party, a group over which the governor has considerable influence, contributed an additional $207,778 in the form of mailers, the campaign finance records indicate. The WSJ noted that this put donations from entities directly under McAuliffe or influenced by him at nearly $700,000, which was about a third of McCabe’s total campaign fundraising efforts. McAuliffe also reportedly recruited McCabe for the race.
21 | Jennifer R Fraser | 10155509005541509_10155509226971509 | nope...nope...nope... that is a policy for doing at polling station. no cameras allowed. I used to work at polling stations for a year. I hope he gets fined because there may be copycats out there. Bad role model musician. Did the voting booth malfunctioned?!?!?
22 | Charles Hensley | 10155509005541509_10155509348781509 | Federal court has already said it is a violation of first amendment rights to prohibit this. With that said there are states that say you can't. However I will be taking a pic of mine for proof. They can arrest me if they want.
23 | Jeana Wells | 10155509005541509_10155509543706509 | Bad Justin Bad. Lol! Ok but seriously he needs to follow the law like everyone else. He probably didn't put much serious thought into this & just took a quick selfie but what he should've done is just taken a selfie w/him wearing his "I voted" sticker on.
24 | JamMhe Carticiano Bartley | 10155509005541509_10155509305191509 | Hey! #CNN you ask selfie is illegal probably you ask because you see Justin Timberlake Vote for #DeplorableTrump🇺🇸and now it's a big deal for Selfie! #CNN is Corrupt, Bias and trash that's why No,no,no for CNN👎👎👎
25 | Lamonte Jordan | 10155509005541509_10155509187476509 | As long as Hillary's out campaigning to be President. WHO has respect for the law now? NOBODY! Until you LOCK HER UP!

76% of American adults said they have "a great deal" of respect for their local police -- a 12-point jump since just last year
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Eric Napier | 10155508853166509_10155508868356509 | I  support the blue, but also harshly condemn police who abuse their powers. (yes, you can do both, your mind DOES have the capacity for multiple thought processes)
2 | Audrey Dellas | 10155508853166509_10155508861046509 | Yes. I have a great deal of respect for police, as is my major.I also have a great deal of respect for black lives.You can respect both :)
3 | Patrick McCoy | 10155508853166509_10155509033171509 | How can you respect someone who doesn't respect us!!! 😡 a few days ago I spoke to two offices here in New York City and try to engage in a conversation about sports,,,they gave me a look if if I was a criminal and continue to go on with their day,,,,prime example🤔🤔🤔🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
4 | Dalfred Echevarria | 10155508853166509_10155508882976509 | Its no secret that they deal with a ton of scary situations and help more than hinder. Even though I don't always see eye to eye with what some do I have 100% respect for what they do. Yes there certain instances where misuse of force or power is real but other than that they do a phenomenal job at keeping places safe
5 | Nehemie Saint-cyr | 10155508853166509_10155509094021509 | That's true white American have respect for the police because they here to protect them. But after everything I see on the news they are the execution for the black community that my free freedom of expression.
6 | Steven Pascal | 10155508853166509_10155508997086509 | CNN: Did your Poll include the Native People peacefully protesting the DAPL in North Dakota. Big Oil's private Army using Riot gear , attack dogs and pepper spray on women and children?
7 | Michael Wynn | 10155508853166509_10155508976626509 | Most do agood job..afew abuse their position, bringing, the decent cops...into disrepute , training ,well disciplined , under difficult circumstances...a tall order, for these men and women...we support you.
8 | Dana Marshall | 10155508853166509_10155508876431509 | It's only the criminals and the families that support "Thugs" that don't like law enforcement officers.
9 | Sharonda Scott | 10155508853166509_10155508967836509 | I live in a rural area and most police do not go on the beat everyday to put their lives in danger. Some have never dealt with dangerous or deadly situations. I have nothing against boys in blue but all of them do not deserve high praise.
10 | Nisha Joshua | 10155508853166509_10155508892576509 | I respect the fire department and military service members and all of our military vets. 100% I also respect the doctors, nurses and emt. I respect the people that prepare my food when dining out. Those people I resepect and trust 100%.
11 | Adam Rodriguez | 10155508853166509_10155508959461509 | I don't support the police until wide spread corrupted cops and their blind eyed partner's  start speaking up and out ..can't stand thugs of any type!!! I'll call a crack head
12 | Nathan Bratsko | 10155508853166509_10155508900401509 | Maybe that's because all this race tension and BS and BS about the cops is nothing but Media BS?  You're all owned by the megarich, the same megarich who almost got put in their places, regulated properly and taxed fairly, and then, all the sudden the media completely shifts gears into race this, cops that, race this and BS, and now no one is talking about the megarich anymore....
13 | Ricardo D. Mendez | 10155508853166509_10155508895491509 | Every time we see a police officer our kids say ( 3 and 5 years old ) , " hey there's a police ,they watching for bad guys, so we can be safe"
14 | Michael Conner | 10155508853166509_10155509045496509 | Every profession has bad apples. Wheather it's the cook who spits in the food or the police officer who thinks he is above the law. Regardless most people are good human beings doing the right thing. #bluelivesmatter
15 | Mark Barnett | 10155508853166509_10155509099301509 | I don't believe there has ever been a lack of respect for law enforcement, its just come to the forefront after the #BLM movement has attempted to drive a spike between local authorities and the Community.
16 | Tim Bankston | 10155508853166509_10155509177056509 | When Black Children have a Built In Image (There goes the Police) it's like an Alert Syndrome they Shouldn't Have Goes Off. Question??? Where does this Derive From? It's like A Prejudice that's Taught. Watch out for the Police. This Shouldn't Be.
17 | Jason Mcmillan | 10155508853166509_10155509016286509 | Strange CNN and the rest of the media wanted to start a race war and it backfired. And yes black lives and everyone else's life matters as well
18 | Kelly Dibia | 10155508853166509_10155509222791509 | Most people do....even after all of the comotion. More than likely there is at least an officer or two connected to your family somehow. I respect the police, but I will definitely call them out if I feel they are crooked or if I feel they made a bad judgment call. I think it's a two way street. We have to respect people as people. Uniform or not.
19 | Jeff Crutchfield | 10155508853166509_10155509124866509 | The racist,BLM group and all of the police and race bashing by CNN has made me appreciate the police more and have less respect for the blacks.Sorry but this is what you guys get. The media and Clinton helped fuel the police brutality and riots.Now that the support for these racist groups such as BLM has radically dwindled the media and Clinton's will toss you to the side since they are done using you.The democrats have destroyed this country for the Black community.Once Clinton is elected expect things for the Black community to get worse.Ask yourself, has the black community thrived these past 8 years? Is your job paying you more? Are you better off today than 8 years ago?
20 | Anita DuBose | 10155508853166509_10155509291071509 | I respect my the officers that uphold the law but not when people are being abused. All Lives Do Matter including Blacks and people with mental illnesses. We all know that the KKK and other white supremacist have infiltrated law enforcement.
21 | Dolores Liebner Dicicco | 10155508853166509_920624401404864 | Virginia Gov.

22 | Trent Britain Jéter | 10155508853166509_1119858158069843 | I think most Americans always respect the police. You can respect good officers and also condemn the actions of those that abuse their power. Some people feel like it's a all or nothing topic. This poll really doesn't reveal anything new. Even in communities where police are rightfully not trusted the people will still say they respect the police.
23 | Andrew Patch | 10155508853166509_10155509404821509 | I of course respect the police. And I undoubtedly appreciate their willingness to put themselves in harms way to keep me safe. But I do fear their militarization. The policeman in the headlining pic has what looks like an assault rifle, maybe it's not, I'm not an expert. Regardless, his giant gun does make me uncomfortable.
24 | Tenise Lavine | 10155508853166509_10155508903131509 | I have the utmost respect and admiration for the duties of police officers. It is for that exact reason that we should ALL have the highest level of disgust and outrage for those that disgrace the honor of that position by behaving like cowardly criminals.Police officers SHOULD represent the best of us, the most courageous with the highest level of integrity. We literally depend on them to represent righteousness to those who would not know it otherwise.
25 | Chris Davis | 10155508853166509_10155509254256509 | So many sheep. CNN does everything they can to demonize the police by only showing the miniscule amount of stories of police power abuse, and so many of their "fans" on here make comments about how terrible the police are. Now, after so much outrage against you anti police POS, including CNN, they post a story like this and everyone changes their tune. CNN and the people that watch it are zombies. You will never get the truth from CNN. Do your research people. You're being lied to, daily.

Those who have served share a common thread of bravery and patriotism, but not all share good fortunes after reintegrating into civilian life. This project seeks to help those most in need.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Rebecca Shelton | 10155508778941509_10155508799061509 | Yes a lot of veterans are homeless,  go with out meals and medical while we give illegals or refugees everything. Sorry our veterans come first and foremost if any of them are without then stop giving to others. Veterans should always come first
2 | Wendy Rene Evans | 10155508778941509_10155508816621509 | How about Obama allowing them to keep their enlistment bonuses. It would take 1 executive order to overturn that...What Obama has done to our Veterans is a disgrace!
3 | Ginny Rowland Yost | 10155508778941509_10155508806656509 | It's so horrible how our veterans are treated by the very country they swore to serve and protect. Our government ought to be very ashamed!! So many of them have seen things we can't even imagine and still suffer over it!!!
4 | Grace Richardson | 10155508778941509_10155508849386509 | Do any of you have first hand knowledge of a veteran in your family? I do and where I live, they are being very well taken care of. They get free hospital care and free meds. Also pensions if they don't have a private one. Yes, we do need to take care of them but some people won't let you help them.
5 | Jack Maxwell | 10155508778941509_10155508782771509 | Now talk about them trying to make them illegal for people to own and live in. We have a housing problem and yet they still tell you no. Even if it safe.
6 | Jody Jordan | 10155508778941509_10155508996566509 | I'll give you your due, AFTER you've served. Those of you complaining, don't understand what serving really means. I'm a USMC  get, along with my husband, 20 yr USMC get. Yes, we have medical insurance, it's not free still prescription co pays, and most coverage is 80 percent...still have hospital bills like everyone else. There's no free ride, no matter what you think....But a vet can only get insurance after 20 yrs service....once you are discharged under 20, you are on your own, and THAT is what I find disgusting.
7 | Andrew Przenkop | 10155508778941509_10155509005426509 | Staff Sgt. Matthew V. Thompson, 28, of Irvine, California, died Aug. 23 in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, of injuries caused by an improvised explosive device that detonated near his patrol while conducting dismounted operations.
8 | Anne A. Chevrier | 10155508778941509_10155508834896509 | Obama prefers to GIVE $4.5 Billion to help rebuild Syria and $419 Million to refugees PLUS $770 Million to renovate MOSQUES overseas...''Josh Earnest, White House spokesman, said that the United States has committed to spend $4.5 billion in order to help rebuild Syria while also addressing the refugee camps scattered throughout Europe. $419 million will be designated for humanitarian aid assisting with Syrian refugees. The money is coming from the United States Agency for International Development which means that Congress will not get the chance to deny the funding.''
9 | Ute Olsson | 10155508778941509_10155508843956509 | How about using all abandoned homes, hospitals and other big places - let the veterans restore them and use them as homes instead of losing great buildings for ever...
10 | Eric Smith | 10155508778941509_10155508959671509 | I have read a lot of comments on this page. Some are very thoughtful and others have a lot of anger and hurt. With that said, any help we could get to our vet's,regardless of the kind of help , there is no reason in this country they shouldn't have it. We as a country help everyone else, our veterans is a no Brainerd.

They have ruined ppls lives somewhere in a foreign country, they expect to come home to a good retired life. It doesn't happen that way. It is everybody's duty not to join the armed forces, in any country. The rich and powerful who rule the roost, have their sinful reasons to want to go to war and they use the soldier. btw, all the poor ppl you see now, were rich in their past life. They had it good for one lifetime and then they keep getting born as a poor person, endlessly. When you add up all of history's leaders and armies that killed, no wonder you have billions of poor ppl.

Affordable Childcare and Eldercare Act. Allows Americans to deduct childcare and elder care from their taxes, incentivizes employers to provide on-site childcare services, and creates tax-free Dependent Care Savings Accounts for both young and elderly dependents, with matching contributions for low-income families.7. End Illegal Immigration Act Fully-funds the construction of a wall on our southern border with the full understanding that the country Mexico will be reimbursing the United States for the full cost of such wall; establishes a 2-year mandatory minimum federal prison sentence for illegally re-entering the U.S. after a previous deportation, and a 5-year mandatory minimum for illegally re-entering for those with felony convictions, multiple misdemeanor convictions or two or more prior deportations; also reforms visa rules to enhance penalties for overstaying and to ensure open jobs are offered to American workers first.8.

3 | Bazza V Duck | 10155508617936509_10155508897366509 | Ya and you wonder why cops shoot first and ask questions later, it's a dangerous job!! Thanks to all Police Officers for risking your live every day for my safety, if someone doesn't obey your orders and you fell threatened keep shooting first!! I would much rather see you go home at the end of your shift than worry about some felon making it home alive!!
4 | Michael Edward Fields | 10155508617936509_10155508781581509 | Remember y'all law enforcement aren't allowed to shoot back anymore because of the whole riot things that occurs afterwards
5 | Ralph Duell | 10155508617936509_10155509336041509 | Wait this is impossible the gun used to shoot at the officer is illegal in CA this has to be a false flag the criminal knowing it was illegal to have in CA would have not bought it knowing it was illegal to possess they for would not have a gun to shoot at the cop................You all know someone out there is really thinking like this SMH
6 | Barry May | 10155508617936509_10155508979916509 | This is why chases should be suspended immediately. Let them go and back off so the law-abiding public isn't threatened by the high speed chase. Not one citizen should lose their life to a crash during a police chase. An RPG from the police would stop them, but also put the public at risk, so that wouldn't be a choice either. With the quality of video today, they can be tracked down and dealt with with no danger to the law abiding. You can't outrun the camera, and running is a felony, prison for the runners. Once that word got out on the streets, they wouldn't run. Running is a felony, no excuses.
7 | Edward Mestaz | 10155508617936509_10155509485461509 | Now someone has first hand experience at what officers have to deal with on a daily basis. He should have been concerned with her as soon as a firearm became present. I don't understand the objective of endangering her but it was a close call as bullets shattered the window inflicting scratches on her face. He still kept his cool while chasing the vehicle and calling in shots fired. 🙏🇺🇸
8 | Sofia Rayne | 10155508617936509_10155508906196509 | Cops can't shoot back anymore remember? It's kind of like gangs and thugs rule the country now like it did in Mexico before.

10 | Daniel Carroll | 10155508617936509_10155509597776509 | That can't be possible because the gun he used is illegal in California... they have such strict gun laws now... and the politicians they are idiots... pretty soon it will turn into Chicago...
11 | Rebecca Alexander | 10155508617936509_10155508625906509 | I wouldn't suggest passengers be riding along these days. I'm glad both survived.
12 | Suarez Tomas Ilario | 10155508617936509_10155508652721509 | What's it going to take to implement the Death penalty?? No, honestly. Why's America playing with cop killers?? If this was Saudi Arabia/China/Russia/North Korea/Afghanistan, cop killers would think 50 times before killing someone. No, honestly.
13 | Gerald Rogers | 10155508617936509_10155508874471509 | Uhhhh....why keep chasing him if they are shooting at your car AND you have someone in it? Now, if she would've gotten hit, who's fault would that be?
14 | Chris Stromberg | 10155508617936509_10155508742006509 | Cop should have never pursued the car with a civilian in the squad.  Smh.  Bad choice by the cop.  Could have been very costly if she was shot.

5 | Dreyer Painting | 10155508513676509_10155508557566509 | I'm voting Donald J. Trump and so is the rest of the Country. We will win in a landslide. CNN you lose the American public, no one has the time of day to defend you.

7 | Brad Endres | 10155508513676509_10155508561296509 | What a childish immature, biased and bigoted small man Obama is. Never in my life have I seen an acting president stoop to the level he has, and pick sides and pander like this man has. And he talks about Trump, he's no different, he slammed and insulted Clinton terribly when he ran against her, now she's an angel. Obama's ignorant and dangerous policies are the real reason to dislike the man, he promised a lot and gave false hope and chump change. Good riddance. We must keep as many Republicans in office as possible to keep the checks and balance of power that was intended and is needed to run this country. say no to the Clinton crime cartel, no to a 3rd world banana republic dictatorship. We can move south of the border when we want that.
8 | Miguel Cabanzo | 10155508513676509_10155508539041509 | Hey, CNN- make sure when the new president comes into office and starts to #DrainTheSwamp you catch every member of congress thrown into the street after being fired for corruption and scandal.
9 | Mel Feliz | 10155508513676509_10155508517086509 | Hillary Clinton is the most experienced and qualified candidate to run for President in decades. Donald Trump is the exact opposite. This race is not close whatsoever. The GOP is about to be humiliated next month. Trump will lose big but we must hold the Republican Party, especially those running in 2016 Races, responsible for their offensive and divisive candidate and Republicans must also be held accountable for their last 8 years of unprecedented rightwing obstruction, stagnation, sabotage, and treason during the Obama Era. ALL BLUE ALL THE WAY THRU ON NOV 8TH!

13 | Mirishikiari Shou | 10155508513676509_10155508538131509 | A President that lied to sick people and mislead them. He can smile and joke now, because he is set for life. Unlike the idiots that voted for him.

16 | Sandie Feider | 10155508513676509_10155508585151509 | Obama has divided our citizens back to 1940's era. He has given illegals more rights than our military and vets. He's elevated violence against law enforcement and worst of all he stumps for a 30 yr criminal to continue his reign of terror against our citizens.
17 | Curtis J. McGiveney | 10155508513676509_1065908393508422 | Very soon, it will become clear to the American people that the Democratic bag of nasty tricks is not unique to Hillary; that the corruption has deeper ties leading back to Obama. By flip flopping from saying that Hillary cannot be trusted, to saying she's the best thing since sliced bread, he has tied an anchor to his legacy. Soon, the smoke and mirrors will fade, and history will show how divisive and destructive he was for our country.
18 | Donna Bonner | 10155508513676509_1141785562581272 | Seems to me Obama spends a lot of time campaigning for Hillary. So, I guess he really doesn't need to be running the country. But what else is new? How many of our tax dollars is he spending flying around the country? But what else is new??

20 | Giovanni Moretti | 10155508513676509_10155508578836509 | This has been trumps personal goal to become president not bc he cares about America or anyone in it but to erase everything the president has done bc he cant take being belittled in the public eye trump could care less about the party the country the people but himself and his ego which is badly hurt..#voteblue
21 | Watila Nar | 10155508513676509_1826676260923136 | President Obama is one in the whole world with the greatest personality. I am not even from America, but we all will mourn his departure from one of the World's greatest position. ❤️
22 | David Ditto | 10155508513676509_1141779522581876 | Too bad Obama doesn't take anything as seriously as he does taking our money and giving it too his freeloading worshippers and BLM terrorists and enslaving whites and destroying the USA.
23 | Jonny Cass | 10155508513676509_10155508577216509 | What happened to real journalists, like this one showing hillary and her campaign violating campaign laws? Oh thats right, you rather talk about what trump said 12 years ago. Now what hillary now.
24 | Leigh Wills | 10155508513676509_1196589263739465 | Obama is the worst President in the history of USA. By the way its not very presidential to act like a 12 yr old on TV. When you should be trying to fix our country but instead your on a TV show.
25 | Yashni Ramsunkar | 10155508513676509_10155508613326509 | President Obama is a wonderful president, I wish every country in this world had a president like him including my country. Donald Trump needs to relax his brains and take his medication....

You spend 20 seconds on an attack on Clinton while you spend days on the attacks on Trump. Your job is report fairly to the American people to help us make an informed choice, but you do everything you can to persuade people to vote for Clinton. You should be ashamed.

4 | Collins Maxim | 10155508308986509_10155508352756509 | BREAKING NEWS!!!Exit poll results‎ of early balloting in many swing states indicate a clear victory for the Republican Presidential candidate, Donald J. Trump. Early voting started about ten days ago in many US states - where it is projected that almost forty-five million of the two hundred million registered voters have already cast their votes for their choice candidate, including the down ballot ticket e‎lections. The exit poll breakdown show a surprisingly sedate voter preference - national security and immigration ‎concerns top the list of almost seventy percent of the voters - while economic issues and social security respectively garnered fifteen and eight percentage points of the total votes cast. Some of the states voting heavily for T‎rump includes the traditional Republican red-states and Democratic blue-states. The Clinton campaign has acknowledged the trend - predicating on secret Republican voting despondent voters that may actually cost her the election beyond what has already been captured by various poll surveys. States showing massive Trump lead as reported by CNM, includes:Kilifi Nairobi Uasin Gishu Kiambu Mombasa Siaya Muranga Kisumu Mandera

TRUMP CONTRACT WITH THE AMERICAN VOTER“Therefore, on the first day of my term of office, my administration will immediately pursue the following six measures to clean up the corruption and special interest collusion in Washington, DC:•	FIRST, propose a Constitutional Amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress;•	SECOND, a hiring freeze on all federal employees to reduce federal workforce through attrition (exempting military, public safety, and public health);•	THIRD, a requirement that for every new federal regulation, two existing regulations must be eliminated;•	FOURTH, a 5 year-ban on White House and Congressional officials becoming lobbyists after they leave government service;•	FIFTH, a lifetime ban on White House officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government;•	SIXTH, a complete ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections.On the same day, I will begin taking the following seven actions to protect American workers:•	FIRST, I will announce my intention to renegotiate NAFTA or withdraw from the deal under Article 2205 •	SECOND, I will announce our withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership•	THIRD, I will direct my Secretary of the Treasury to label China a currency manipulator•	FOURTH, I will direct the Secretary of Commerce and U.S. Trade Representative to identify all foreign trading abuses that unfairly impact American workers and direct them to use every tool under American and international law to end those abuses immediately•	FIFTH, I will lift the restrictions on the production of $50 trillion dollars’ worth of job-producing American energy reserves, including shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal.•	SIXTH, lift the Obama-Clinton roadblocks and allow vital energy infrastructure projects, like the Keystone Pipeline, to move forward•	SEVENTH, cancel billions in payments to U.N. climate change programs and use the money to fix America’s water and environmental infrastructure Additionally, on the first day, I will take the following five actions to restore security and the constitutional rule of law:•	FIRST, cancel every unconstitutional executive action, memorandum and order issued by President Obama•	SECOND, begin the process of selecting a replacement for Justice Scalia from one of the 20 judges on my list, who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States•	THIRD, cancel all federal funding to Sanctuary Cities•	FOURTH, begin removing the more than 2 million criminal illegal immigrants from the country and cancel visas to foreign countries that won’t take them back•	FIFTH, suspend immigration from terror-prone regions where vetting cannot safely occur. All vetting of people coming into our country will be considered extreme vetting.Next, I will work with Congress to introduce the following broader legislative measures and fight for their passage within the first 100 days of my Administration:1. Middle Class Tax Relief And Simplification Act. An economic plan designed to grow the economy 4% per year and create at least 25 million new jobs through massive tax reduction and simplification, in combination with trade reform, regulatory relief, and lifting the restrictions on American energy. The largest tax reductions are for the middle class. A middle-class family with 2 children will get a 35% tax cut. The current number of brackets will be reduced from 7 to 3, and tax forms will likewise be greatly simplified. The business rate will be lowered from 35 to 15 percent, and the trillions of dollars of American corporate money overseas can now be brought back at a 10 percent rate.2. End The Offshoring Act Establishes tariffs to discourage companies from laying off their workers in order to relocate in other countries and ship their products back to the U.S. tax-free.3. American Energy & Infrastructure Act. Leverages public-private partnerships, and private investments through tax incentives, to spur $1 trillion in infrastructure investment over 10 years. It is revenue neutral.4. School Choice And Education Opportunity Act. Redirects education dollars to gives parents the right to send their kid to the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school of their choice. Ends common core, brings education supervision to local communities. It expands vocational and technical education, and make 2 and 4-year college more affordable.5. Repeal and Replace Obamacare Act. Fully repeals Obamacare and replaces it with Health Savings Accounts, the ability to purchase health insurance across state lines, and lets states manage Medicaid funds. Reforms will also include cutting the red tape at the FDA: there are over 4,000 drugs awaiting approval, and we especially want to speed the approval of life-saving medications.6. Affordable Childcare and Eldercare Act. Allows Americans to deduct childcare and elder care from their taxes, incentivizes employers to provide on-site childcare services, and creates tax-free Dependent Care Savings Accounts for both young and elderly dependents, with matching contributions for low-income families.7. End Illegal Immigration Act Fully-funds the construction of a wall on our southern border with the full understanding that the country Mexico will be reimbursing the United States for the full cost of such wall; establishes a 2-year mandatory minimum federal prison sentence for illegally re-entering the U.S. after a previous deportation, and a 5-year mandatory minimum for illegally re-entering for those with felony convictions, multiple misdemeanor convictions or two or more prior deportations; also reforms visa rules to enhance penalties for overstaying and to ensure open jobs are offered to American workers first.8.

9 | Eddie Munoz | 10155508202206509_10155508848506509 | DONALD J. TRUMP CONTRACT WITH THE AMERICAN VOTER“Therefore, on the first day of my term of office, my administration will immediately pursue the following six measures to clean up the corruption and special interest collusion in Washington, DC:•	FIRST, propose a Constitutional Amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress;•	SECOND, a hiring freeze on all federal employees to reduce federal workforce through attrition (exempting military, public safety, and public health);•	THIRD, a requirement that for every new federal regulation, two existing regulations must be eliminated;•	FOURTH, a 5 year-ban on White House and Congressional officials becoming lobbyists after they leave government service;•	FIFTH, a lifetime ban on White House officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government;•	SIXTH, a complete ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections.On the same day, I will begin taking the following seven actions to protect American workers:•	FIRST, I will announce my intention to renegotiate NAFTA or withdraw from the deal under Article 2205 •	SECOND, I will announce our withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership•	THIRD, I will direct my Secretary of the Treasury to label China a currency manipulator•	FOURTH, I will direct the Secretary of Commerce and U.S. Trade Representative to identify all foreign trading abuses that unfairly impact American workers and direct them to use every tool under American and international law to end those abuses immediately•	FIFTH, I will lift the restrictions on the production of $50 trillion dollars’ worth of job-producing American energy reserves, including shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal.•	SIXTH, lift the Obama-Clinton roadblocks and allow vital energy infrastructure projects, like the Keystone Pipeline, to move forward•	SEVENTH, cancel billions in payments to U.N. climate change programs and use the money to fix America’s water and environmental infrastructure Additionally, on the first day, I will take the following five actions to restore security and the constitutional rule of law:•	FIRST, cancel every unconstitutional executive action, memorandum and order issued by President Obama•	SECOND, begin the process of selecting a replacement for Justice Scalia from one of the 20 judges on my list, who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States•	THIRD, cancel all federal funding to Sanctuary Cities•	FOURTH, begin removing the more than 2 million criminal illegal immigrants from the country and cancel visas to foreign countries that won’t take them back•	FIFTH, suspend immigration from terror-prone regions where vetting cannot safely occur. All vetting of people coming into our country will be considered extreme vetting.Next, I will work with Congress to introduce the following broader legislative measures and fight for their passage within the first 100 days of my Administration:1. Middle Class Tax Relief And Simplification Act. An economic plan designed to grow the economy 4% per year and create at least 25 million new jobs through massive tax reduction and simplification, in combination with trade reform, regulatory relief, and lifting the restrictions on American energy. The largest tax reductions are for the middle class. A middle-class family with 2 children will get a 35% tax cut. The current number of brackets will be reduced from 7 to 3, and tax forms will likewise be greatly simplified. The business rate will be lowered from 35 to 15 percent, and the trillions of dollars of American corporate money overseas can now be brought back at a 10 percent rate.2. End The Offshoring Act Establishes tariffs to discourage companies from laying off their workers in order to relocate in other countries and ship their products back to the U.S. tax-free.3. American Energy & Infrastructure Act. Leverages public-private partnerships, and private investments through tax incentives, to spur $1 trillion in infrastructure investment over 10 years. It is revenue neutral.4. School Choice And Education Opportunity Act. Redirects education dollars to gives parents the right to send their kid to the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school of their choice. Ends common core, brings education supervision to local communities. It expands vocational and technical education, and make 2 and 4-year college more affordable.5. Repeal and Replace Obamacare Act. Fully repeals Obamacare and replaces it with Health Savings Accounts, the ability to purchase health insurance across state lines, and lets states manage Medicaid funds. Reforms will also include cutting the red tape at the FDA: there are over 4,000 drugs awaiting approval, and we especially want to speed the approval of life-saving medications.6. Affordable Childcare and Eldercare Act. Allows Americans to deduct childcare and elder care from their taxes, incentivizes employers to provide on-site childcare services, and creates tax-free Dependent Care Savings Accounts for both young and elderly dependents, with matching contributions for low-income families.7. End Illegal Immigration Act Fully-funds the construction of a wall on our southern border with the full understanding that the country Mexico will be reimbursing the United States for the full cost of such wall; establishes a 2-year mandatory minimum federal prison sentence for illegally re-entering the U.S. after a previous deportation, and a 5-year mandatory minimum for illegally re-entering for those with felony convictions, multiple misdemeanor convictions or two or more prior deportations; also reforms visa rules to enhance penalties for overstaying and to ensure open jobs are offered to American workers first.8. Restoring Community Safety Act. Reduces surging crime, drugs and violence by creating a Task Force On Violent Crime and increasing funding for programs that train and assist local police; increases resources for federal law enforcement agencies and federal prosecutors to dismantle criminal gangs and put violent offenders behind bars.9. Restoring National Security Act. Rebuilds our military by eliminating the defense sequester and expanding military investment; provides Veterans with the ability to receive public VA treatment or attend the private doctor of their choice; protects our vital infrastructure from cyber-attack; establishes new screening procedures for immigration to ensure those who are admitted to our country support our people and our values10. Clean up Corruption in Washington Act. Enacts new ethics reforms to Drain the Swamp and reduce the corrupting influence of special interests on our politics.On November 8th, Americans will be voting for this 100-day plan to restore prosperity to our economy, security to our communities, and honesty to our government.This is my pledge to you.And if we follow these steps, we will once more have a government of, by and for the people.”DRAIN THE WASHINGTON SWAMP Please copy and paste

12 | Eddie Munoz | 10155508090801509_10155508849961509 | DONALD J. TRUMP CONTRACT WITH THE AMERICAN VOTER“Therefore, on the first day of my term of office, my administration will immediately pursue the following six measures to clean up the corruption and special interest collusion in Washington, DC:•	FIRST, propose a Constitutional Amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress;•	SECOND, a hiring freeze on all federal employees to reduce federal workforce through attrition (exempting military, public safety, and public health);•	THIRD, a requirement that for every new federal regulation, two existing regulations must be eliminated;•	FOURTH, a 5 year-ban on White House and Congressional officials becoming lobbyists after they leave government service;•	FIFTH, a lifetime ban on White House officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government;•	SIXTH, a complete ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections.On the same day, I will begin taking the following seven actions to protect American workers:•	FIRST, I will announce my intention to renegotiate NAFTA or withdraw from the deal under Article 2205 •	SECOND, I will announce our withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership•	THIRD, I will direct my Secretary of the Treasury to label China a currency manipulator•	FOURTH, I will direct the Secretary of Commerce and U.S. Trade Representative to identify all foreign trading abuses that unfairly impact American workers and direct them to use every tool under American and international law to end those abuses immediately•	FIFTH, I will lift the restrictions on the production of $50 trillion dollars’ worth of job-producing American energy reserves, including shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal.•	SIXTH, lift the Obama-Clinton roadblocks and allow vital energy infrastructure projects, like the Keystone Pipeline, to move forward•	SEVENTH, cancel billions in payments to U.N. climate change programs and use the money to fix America’s water and environmental infrastructure Additionally, on the first day, I will take the following five actions to restore security and the constitutional rule of law:•	FIRST, cancel every unconstitutional executive action, memorandum and order issued by President Obama•	SECOND, begin the process of selecting a replacement for Justice Scalia from one of the 20 judges on my list, who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States•	THIRD, cancel all federal funding to Sanctuary Cities•	FOURTH, begin removing the more than 2 million criminal illegal immigrants from the country and cancel visas to foreign countries that won’t take them back•	FIFTH, suspend immigration from terror-prone regions where vetting cannot safely occur. All vetting of people coming into our country will be considered extreme vetting.Next, I will work with Congress to introduce the following broader legislative measures and fight for their passage within the first 100 days of my Administration:1. Middle Class Tax Relief And Simplification Act. An economic plan designed to grow the economy 4% per year and create at least 25 million new jobs through massive tax reduction and simplification, in combination with trade reform, regulatory relief, and lifting the restrictions on American energy. The largest tax reductions are for the middle class. A middle-class family with 2 children will get a 35% tax cut. The current number of brackets will be reduced from 7 to 3, and tax forms will likewise be greatly simplified. The business rate will be lowered from 35 to 15 percent, and the trillions of dollars of American corporate money overseas can now be brought back at a 10 percent rate.2. End The Offshoring Act Establishes tariffs to discourage companies from laying off their workers in order to relocate in other countries and ship their products back to the U.S. tax-free.3. American Energy & Infrastructure Act. Leverages public-private partnerships, and private investments through tax incentives, to spur $1 trillion in infrastructure investment over 10 years. It is revenue neutral.4. School Choice And Education Opportunity Act. Redirects education dollars to gives parents the right to send their kid to the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school of their choice. Ends common core, brings education supervision to local communities. It expands vocational and technical education, and make 2 and 4-year college more affordable.5. Repeal and Replace Obamacare Act. Fully repeals Obamacare and replaces it with Health Savings Accounts, the ability to purchase health insurance across state lines, and lets states manage Medicaid funds. Reforms will also include cutting the red tape at the FDA: there are over 4,000 drugs awaiting approval, and we especially want to speed the approval of life-saving medications.6. Affordable Childcare and Eldercare Act. Allows Americans to deduct childcare and elder care from their taxes, incentivizes employers to provide on-site childcare services, and creates tax-free Dependent Care Savings Accounts for both young and elderly dependents, with matching contributions for low-income families.7. End Illegal Immigration Act Fully-funds the construction of a wall on our southern border with the full understanding that the country Mexico will be reimbursing the United States for the full cost of such wall; establishes a 2-year mandatory minimum federal prison sentence for illegally re-entering the U.S. after a previous deportation, and a 5-year mandatory minimum for illegally re-entering for those with felony convictions, multiple misdemeanor convictions or two or more prior deportations; also reforms visa rules to enhance penalties for overstaying and to ensure open jobs are offered to American workers first.8. Restoring Community Safety Act. Reduces surging crime, drugs and violence by creating a Task Force On Violent Crime and increasing funding for programs that train and assist local police; increases resources for federal law enforcement agencies and federal prosecutors to dismantle criminal gangs and put violent offenders behind bars.9. Restoring National Security Act. Rebuilds our military by eliminating the defense sequester and expanding military investment; provides Veterans with the ability to receive public VA treatment or attend the private doctor of their choice; protects our vital infrastructure from cyber-attack; establishes new screening procedures for immigration to ensure those who are admitted to our country support our people and our values10. Clean up Corruption in Washington Act. Enacts new ethics reforms to Drain the Swamp and reduce the corrupting influence of special interests on our politics.On November 8th, Americans will be voting for this 100-day plan to restore prosperity to our economy, security to our communities, and honesty to our government.This is my pledge to you.And if we follow these steps, we will once more have a government of, by and for the people.”DRAIN THE WASHINGTON SWAMP Please copy and paste

These people have no common sense and are completely blindfolded to where the corruption is coming from. The saddest part is if they were drowning hillary would watch them sink.If hillary Clinton was any other person she'd have three life sentences in prison
18 | Heath Stinson | 10155508090801509_10155508092796509 | We all already know the media is corrupt, let me ask, did you know Debbie Wasserman Schultz was the co-chair of Hillary's 2008 presidential run, where she lost the nomination to Obama. So, in order to lock down the nomination for 2016, Hillary would've had to put Schultz in charge of the DNC to manipulate the party from within. In order for this corruption scheme to work, the Clintons would have needed first to, not only get the current DNC chair at the time to step down, but also get them to recommend Schultz for the position. A big request. And the Clintons would have likely needed to promise a powerful favor to that DNC chair, something more prestigious than being head of the Democratic party. So who was that person and what did they get in return? The previous chair of the DNC prior to Debbie Wasserman Schultz was...Tim Kaine.Let that sink in.

6 | Eddie Munoz | 10155507970311509_10155508850666509 | DONALD J. TRUMP CONTRACT WITH THE AMERICAN VOTER“Therefore, on the first day of my term of office, my administration will immediately pursue the following six measures to clean up the corruption and special interest collusion in Washington, DC:•	FIRST, propose a Constitutional Amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress;•	SECOND, a hiring freeze on all federal employees to reduce federal workforce through attrition (exempting military, public safety, and public health);•	THIRD, a requirement that for every new federal regulation, two existing regulations must be eliminated;•	FOURTH, a 5 year-ban on White House and Congressional officials becoming lobbyists after they leave government service;•	FIFTH, a lifetime ban on White House officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government;•	SIXTH, a complete ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections.On the same day, I will begin taking the following seven actions to protect American workers:•	FIRST, I will announce my intention to renegotiate NAFTA or withdraw from the deal under Article 2205 •	SECOND, I will announce our withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership•	THIRD, I will direct my Secretary of the Treasury to label China a currency manipulator•	FOURTH, I will direct the Secretary of Commerce and U.S. Trade Representative to identify all foreign trading abuses that unfairly impact American workers and direct them to use every tool under American and international law to end those abuses immediately•	FIFTH, I will lift the restrictions on the production of $50 trillion dollars’ worth of job-producing American energy reserves, including shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal.•	SIXTH, lift the Obama-Clinton roadblocks and allow vital energy infrastructure projects, like the Keystone Pipeline, to move forward•	SEVENTH, cancel billions in payments to U.N. climate change programs and use the money to fix America’s water and environmental infrastructure Additionally, on the first day, I will take the following five actions to restore security and the constitutional rule of law:•	FIRST, cancel every unconstitutional executive action, memorandum and order issued by President Obama•	SECOND, begin the process of selecting a replacement for Justice Scalia from one of the 20 judges on my list, who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States•	THIRD, cancel all federal funding to Sanctuary Cities•	FOURTH, begin removing the more than 2 million criminal illegal immigrants from the country and cancel visas to foreign countries that won’t take them back•	FIFTH, suspend immigration from terror-prone regions where vetting cannot safely occur. All vetting of people coming into our country will be considered extreme vetting.Next, I will work with Congress to introduce the following broader legislative measures and fight for their passage within the first 100 days of my Administration:1. Middle Class Tax Relief And Simplification Act. An economic plan designed to grow the economy 4% per year and create at least 25 million new jobs through massive tax reduction and simplification, in combination with trade reform, regulatory relief, and lifting the restrictions on American energy. The largest tax reductions are for the middle class. A middle-class family with 2 children will get a 35% tax cut. The current number of brackets will be reduced from 7 to 3, and tax forms will likewise be greatly simplified. The business rate will be lowered from 35 to 15 percent, and the trillions of dollars of American corporate money overseas can now be brought back at a 10 percent rate.2. End The Offshoring Act Establishes tariffs to discourage companies from laying off their workers in order to relocate in other countries and ship their products back to the U.S. tax-free.3. American Energy & Infrastructure Act. Leverages public-private partnerships, and private investments through tax incentives, to spur $1 trillion in infrastructure investment over 10 years. It is revenue neutral.4. School Choice And Education Opportunity Act. Redirects education dollars to gives parents the right to send their kid to the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school of their choice. Ends common core, brings education supervision to local communities. It expands vocational and technical education, and make 2 and 4-year college more affordable.5. Repeal and Replace Obamacare Act. Fully repeals Obamacare and replaces it with Health Savings Accounts, the ability to purchase health insurance across state lines, and lets states manage Medicaid funds. Reforms will also include cutting the red tape at the FDA: there are over 4,000 drugs awaiting approval, and we especially want to speed the approval of life-saving medications.6. Affordable Childcare and Eldercare Act. Allows Americans to deduct childcare and elder care from their taxes, incentivizes employers to provide on-site childcare services, and creates tax-free Dependent Care Savings Accounts for both young and elderly dependents, with matching contributions for low-income families.7. End Illegal Immigration Act Fully-funds the construction of a wall on our southern border with the full understanding that the country Mexico will be reimbursing the United States for the full cost of such wall; establishes a 2-year mandatory minimum federal prison sentence for illegally re-entering the U.S. after a previous deportation, and a 5-year mandatory minimum for illegally re-entering for those with felony convictions, multiple misdemeanor convictions or two or more prior deportations; also reforms visa rules to enhance penalties for overstaying and to ensure open jobs are offered to American workers first.8. Restoring Community Safety Act. Reduces surging crime, drugs and violence by creating a Task Force On Violent Crime and increasing funding for programs that train and assist local police; increases resources for federal law enforcement agencies and federal prosecutors to dismantle criminal gangs and put violent offenders behind bars.9. Restoring National Security Act. Rebuilds our military by eliminating the defense sequester and expanding military investment; provides Veterans with the ability to receive public VA treatment or attend the private doctor of their choice; protects our vital infrastructure from cyber-attack; establishes new screening procedures for immigration to ensure those who are admitted to our country support our people and our values10. Clean up Corruption in Washington Act. Enacts new ethics reforms to Drain the Swamp and reduce the corrupting influence of special interests on our politics.On November 8th, Americans will be voting for this 100-day plan to restore prosperity to our economy, security to our communities, and honesty to our government.This is my pledge to you.And if we follow these steps, we will once more have a government of, by and for the people.”DRAIN THE WASHINGTON SWAMP Please copy and paste

Bob Dylan's an author. Bill Murray's an author. How about comparing Trump to an author while we're at it? Wait, he actually wrote a book. That probably disqualifies him from author comparisons.

So, in order to lock down the nomination for 2016, Hillary would've had to put Schultz in charge of the DNC to manipulate the party from within. In order for this corruption scheme to work, the Clintons would have needed first to, not only get the current DNC chair at the time to step down, but also get them to recommend Schultz for the position. A big request. And the Clintons would have likely needed to promise a powerful favor to that DNC chair, something more prestigious than being head of the Democratic party. So who was that person and what did they get in return? The previous chair of the DNC prior to Debbie Wasserman Schultz was...Tim Kaine.Let that sink in.

So, if you are worried about your phone being bogged down overtime because of a slow processor, that is not an issue here.

6 | Eddie Munoz | 10155507752101509_10155508851131509 | DONALD J. TRUMP CONTRACT WITH THE AMERICAN VOTER“Therefore, on the first day of my term of office, my administration will immediately pursue the following six measures to clean up the corruption and special interest collusion in Washington, DC:•	FIRST, propose a Constitutional Amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress;•	SECOND, a hiring freeze on all federal employees to reduce federal workforce through attrition (exempting military, public safety, and public health);•	THIRD, a requirement that for every new federal regulation, two existing regulations must be eliminated;•	FOURTH, a 5 year-ban on White House and Congressional officials becoming lobbyists after they leave government service;•	FIFTH, a lifetime ban on White House officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government;•	SIXTH, a complete ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections.On the same day, I will begin taking the following seven actions to protect American workers:•	FIRST, I will announce my intention to renegotiate NAFTA or withdraw from the deal under Article 2205 •	SECOND, I will announce our withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership•	THIRD, I will direct my Secretary of the Treasury to label China a currency manipulator•	FOURTH, I will direct the Secretary of Commerce and U.S. Trade Representative to identify all foreign trading abuses that unfairly impact American workers and direct them to use every tool under American and international law to end those abuses immediately•	FIFTH, I will lift the restrictions on the production of $50 trillion dollars’ worth of job-producing American energy reserves, including shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal.•	SIXTH, lift the Obama-Clinton roadblocks and allow vital energy infrastructure projects, like the Keystone Pipeline, to move forward•	SEVENTH, cancel billions in payments to U.N. climate change programs and use the money to fix America’s water and environmental infrastructure Additionally, on the first day, I will take the following five actions to restore security and the constitutional rule of law:•	FIRST, cancel every unconstitutional executive action, memorandum and order issued by President Obama•	SECOND, begin the process of selecting a replacement for Justice Scalia from one of the 20 judges on my list, who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States•	THIRD, cancel all federal funding to Sanctuary Cities•	FOURTH, begin removing the more than 2 million criminal illegal immigrants from the country and cancel visas to foreign countries that won’t take them back•	FIFTH, suspend immigration from terror-prone regions where vetting cannot safely occur. All vetting of people coming into our country will be considered extreme vetting.Next, I will work with Congress to introduce the following broader legislative measures and fight for their passage within the first 100 days of my Administration:1. Middle Class Tax Relief And Simplification Act. An economic plan designed to grow the economy 4% per year and create at least 25 million new jobs through massive tax reduction and simplification, in combination with trade reform, regulatory relief, and lifting the restrictions on American energy. The largest tax reductions are for the middle class. A middle-class family with 2 children will get a 35% tax cut. The current number of brackets will be reduced from 7 to 3, and tax forms will likewise be greatly simplified. The business rate will be lowered from 35 to 15 percent, and the trillions of dollars of American corporate money overseas can now be brought back at a 10 percent rate.2. End The Offshoring Act Establishes tariffs to discourage companies from laying off their workers in order to relocate in other countries and ship their products back to the U.S. tax-free.3. American Energy & Infrastructure Act. Leverages public-private partnerships, and private investments through tax incentives, to spur $1 trillion in infrastructure investment over 10 years. It is revenue neutral.4. School Choice And Education Opportunity Act. Redirects education dollars to gives parents the right to send their kid to the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school of their choice. Ends common core, brings education supervision to local communities. It expands vocational and technical education, and make 2 and 4-year college more affordable.5. Repeal and Replace Obamacare Act. Fully repeals Obamacare and replaces it with Health Savings Accounts, the ability to purchase health insurance across state lines, and lets states manage Medicaid funds. Reforms will also include cutting the red tape at the FDA: there are over 4,000 drugs awaiting approval, and we especially want to speed the approval of life-saving medications.6. Affordable Childcare and Eldercare Act. Allows Americans to deduct childcare and elder care from their taxes, incentivizes employers to provide on-site childcare services, and creates tax-free Dependent Care Savings Accounts for both young and elderly dependents, with matching contributions for low-income families.7. End Illegal Immigration Act Fully-funds the construction of a wall on our southern border with the full understanding that the country Mexico will be reimbursing the United States for the full cost of such wall; establishes a 2-year mandatory minimum federal prison sentence for illegally re-entering the U.S. after a previous deportation, and a 5-year mandatory minimum for illegally re-entering for those with felony convictions, multiple misdemeanor convictions or two or more prior deportations; also reforms visa rules to enhance penalties for overstaying and to ensure open jobs are offered to American workers first.8. Restoring Community Safety Act. Reduces surging crime, drugs and violence by creating a Task Force On Violent Crime and increasing funding for programs that train and assist local police; increases resources for federal law enforcement agencies and federal prosecutors to dismantle criminal gangs and put violent offenders behind bars.9. Restoring National Security Act. Rebuilds our military by eliminating the defense sequester and expanding military investment; provides Veterans with the ability to receive public VA treatment or attend the private doctor of their choice; protects our vital infrastructure from cyber-attack; establishes new screening procedures for immigration to ensure those who are admitted to our country support our people and our values10. Clean up Corruption in Washington Act. Enacts new ethics reforms to Drain the Swamp and reduce the corrupting influence of special interests on our politics.On November 8th, Americans will be voting for this 100-day plan to restore prosperity to our economy, security to our communities, and honesty to our government.This is my pledge to you.And if we follow these steps, we will once more have a government of, by and for the people.”DRAIN THE WASHINGTON SWAMP Please copy and paste

1 | Emmy Schmemmy | 10155507704241509_10155507707691509 | You mean STD rates increase when we defund Planned Parenthood? SHOCKING.
2 | Brandon Horan | 10155507704241509_10155507710741509 | Seeing the number of people supporting Trump, seems like rates of stupidity and ignorance are also currently at an all-time high.
3 | Tyler Davis | 10155507704241509_10155507711891509 | Yeah. I'll keep my junk in my pants for awhile, then again I don't go around and mess with any and everything that has two legs..
4 | Brian Rushing | 10155507704241509_10155507725811509 | See what happens when you use Miley, Katy and Madonna to get out the vote. It sure didn't take long. 😂
5 | Melissa Kessner | 10155507704241509_10155507713251509 | I notice people don't take it seriously these days. I've had to stress condoms and their importance to many people and they act like I'm some old hag giving them the "drugs are bad" speech. A few months ago, I was going to send my friend the slideshow of STD's I was shown. When you see that it becomes real.
6 | Robert Taulo | 10155507704241509_10155507814286509 | Blame the popularity of Tinder and other sites for getting laid with a click of a button. Lack of Sex Ed in the schools and the simple fact that so many people today are just gross.
7 | Nathan Alexander LeBlanc | 10155507704241509_10155507902481509 | What's really sad is almost none of these comments have anything to do with this news article. STDs are more rampant now because society itself is different. People simply have more sexual partners now then our parents/grandparents did. We don't exactly have one or two sexual partners then get married for 20-40 years anymore. Where I'm from in Michigan it's common practice to simply go to a bar buy a girl some drinks, have sexual relations with her and send her home. Either the next day or the next week you go back to the bar pick another one. Yes sometimes the alcohol makes you feel invincible and you don't wear contraceptives like you should. So what I'm trying to say is right now we have the largest population we ever had, we have the largest youth population we've ever had and we get "around" more than we ever have. That explains the STDs at an all time high.
8 | Ashley Sotelo | 10155507704241509_10155507755371509 | People are awful. You shouldn't sleep with them anyways. Love is a myth and casual sex eventually becomes empty and boring. STDs are only mildly irritating compared to the agonizing pain caused by intimacy with other humans.
9 | Bill Reishtein | 10155507704241509_10155507857286509 | CNN should force all of their "reporters "to watch Chris Wallace moderate the debate. That is what a true journalist behaves like. Tough on both sides. Fair. CNN has so debased journalism, I don't think they even know what unbiased reporting even looks like anymore. It's sad and pathetic. I would remove mirrors from your HQ because it must be incredibly depressing for someone who went to journalism school to look in the mirror everyday and say... I'm looking at a partisan hack.
10 | Krystal Slicker Aker | 10155507704241509_10155507714076509 | Yay for monogamy and not putting out for everyone. Seriously though, there's these nifty things called condoms. Use them. There are even some for those with latex allegories.
11 | Gary Rose | 10155507704241509_10155507721621509 | Maybe your corrupt media anchors could debate this for two weeks - give it to Lemon, Blitzer, Bash, Burnett & that other vulture Cardona. Not forgetting the gurning face of Kohn who pulls the most ridiculous of faces - especially when someone speaks the truth about Clinton and the emails and the fraud - Kohn's face actually goes into overdrive!Debate this if you dare!https://youtu.be/mxjLuvR0338
12 | Richard Proceszyn | 10155507704241509_10155508149986509 | Yay!With a combination of defunding Planned Parenthood, lack of sexual education in public school, and Anti-vaxers, you've successfully brought back STD'S that were at minimal numbers.Way to go.Be proud...
13 | Gail Bentzinger | 10155507704241509_10155507752721509 | And St. Louis is right at the top. Since Missouri lost its first place in meth production and puppy mills, we had to find something else awful to excel at. / sarc off.
14 | Timothy Senior | 10155507704241509_10155508287456509 | The only surprising thing about this story is that people are surprised by it.  What else can you expect from a society that is ruled by promiscuity and debauchery?
15 | Jessica McNaboe | 10155507704241509_10155507731911509 | CNN - I don't understand your use of old STD posters in this story. Seems strange to me, especially since they have no relevance to the story whatsoever.
16 | Shelley-Belle Viteri | 10155507704241509_10155508326571509 | That's because no one taught  people these days to respect themselves, choose wisely, and to not be so self gratifying. Now we've got a bunch of narcissistic hoes running around acting like nothings wrong with being nasty. Well, yes hell there is something wrong with being nasty and its not going away now. No matter how pretty you think you are.
17 | Whitney Wade | 10155507704241509_10155509191786509 | Is that really shocking?  Sex is not a big deal these days. Kids start younger. Sex safe seems to be a joke. And worse of all... morals seem to be non existent!
18 | Melissa Daniels | 10155507704241509_10155507798751509 | The popularity of Tinder, lack of sex education, and the defunding of planned parenthood is to blame for this trend
19 | Jose Ephriamite Soto | 10155507704241509_10155508785086509 | I never understand why ppl just don't wear condoms. I remember I was afraid to have sex unprotected. Wrap it up. A condom only cost 1 dollar.

TRUMP CONTRACT WITH THE AMERICAN VOTER“Therefore, on the first day of my term of office, my administration will immediately pursue the following six measures to clean up the corruption and special interest collusion in Washington, DC:•	FIRST, propose a Constitutional Amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress;•	SECOND, a hiring freeze on all federal employees to reduce federal workforce through attrition (exempting military, public safety, and public health);•	THIRD, a requirement that for every new federal regulation, two existing regulations must be eliminated;•	FOURTH, a 5 year-ban on White House and Congressional officials becoming lobbyists after they leave government service;•	FIFTH, a lifetime ban on White House officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government;•	SIXTH, a complete ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections.On the same day, I will begin taking the following seven actions to protect American workers:•	FIRST, I will announce my intention to renegotiate NAFTA or withdraw from the deal under Article 2205 •	SECOND, I will announce our withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership•	THIRD, I will direct my Secretary of the Treasury to label China a currency manipulator•	FOURTH, I will direct the Secretary of Commerce and U.S. Trade Representative to identify all foreign trading abuses that unfairly impact American workers and direct them to use every tool under American and international law to end those abuses immediately•	FIFTH, I will lift the restrictions on the production of $50 trillion dollars’ worth of job-producing American energy reserves, including shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal.•	SIXTH, lift the Obama-Clinton roadblocks and allow vital energy infrastructure projects, like the Keystone Pipeline, to move forward•	SEVENTH, cancel billions in payments to U.N. climate change programs and use the money to fix America’s water and environmental infrastructure Additionally, on the first day, I will take the following five actions to restore security and the constitutional rule of law:•	FIRST, cancel every unconstitutional executive action, memorandum and order issued by President Obama•	SECOND, begin the process of selecting a replacement for Justice Scalia from one of the 20 judges on my list, who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States•	THIRD, cancel all federal funding to Sanctuary Cities•	FOURTH, begin removing the more than 2 million criminal illegal immigrants from the country and cancel visas to foreign countries that won’t take them back•	FIFTH, suspend immigration from terror-prone regions where vetting cannot safely occur. All vetting of people coming into our country will be considered extreme vetting.Next, I will work with Congress to introduce the following broader legislative measures and fight for their passage within the first 100 days of my Administration:1. Middle Class Tax Relief And Simplification Act. An economic plan designed to grow the economy 4% per year and create at least 25 million new jobs through massive tax reduction and simplification, in combination with trade reform, regulatory relief, and lifting the restrictions on American energy. The largest tax reductions are for the middle class. A middle-class family with 2 children will get a 35% tax cut. The current number of brackets will be reduced from 7 to 3, and tax forms will likewise be greatly simplified. The business rate will be lowered from 35 to 15 percent, and the trillions of dollars of American corporate money overseas can now be brought back at a 10 percent rate.2. End The Offshoring Act Establishes tariffs to discourage companies from laying off their workers in order to relocate in other countries and ship their products back to the U.S. tax-free.3. American Energy & Infrastructure Act. Leverages public-private partnerships, and private investments through tax incentives, to spur $1 trillion in infrastructure investment over 10 years. It is revenue neutral.4. School Choice And Education Opportunity Act. Redirects education dollars to gives parents the right to send their kid to the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school of their choice. Ends common core, brings education supervision to local communities. It expands vocational and technical education, and make 2 and 4-year college more affordable.5. Repeal and Replace Obamacare Act. Fully repeals Obamacare and replaces it with Health Savings Accounts, the ability to purchase health insurance across state lines, and lets states manage Medicaid funds. Reforms will also include cutting the red tape at the FDA: there are over 4,000 drugs awaiting approval, and we especially want to speed the approval of life-saving medications.6. Affordable Childcare and Eldercare Act. Allows Americans to deduct childcare and elder care from their taxes, incentivizes employers to provide on-site childcare services, and creates tax-free Dependent Care Savings Accounts for both young and elderly dependents, with matching contributions for low-income families.7. End Illegal Immigration Act Fully-funds the construction of a wall on our southern border with the full understanding that the country Mexico will be reimbursing the United States for the full cost of such wall; establishes a 2-year mandatory minimum federal prison sentence for illegally re-entering the U.S. after a previous deportation, and a 5-year mandatory minimum for illegally re-entering for those with felony convictions, multiple misdemeanor convictions or two or more prior deportations; also reforms visa rules to enhance penalties for overstaying and to ensure open jobs are offered to American workers first.8. Restoring Community Safety Act. Reduces surging crime, drugs and violence by creating a Task Force On Violent Crime and increasing funding for programs that train and assist local police; increases resources for federal law enforcement agencies and federal prosecutors to dismantle criminal gangs and put violent offenders behind bars.9. Restoring National Security Act. Rebuilds our military by eliminating the defense sequester and expanding military investment; provides Veterans with the ability to receive public VA treatment or attend the private doctor of their choice; protects our vital infrastructure from cyber-attack; establishes new screening procedures for immigration to ensure those who are admitted to our country support our people and our values10. Clean up Corruption in Washington Act. Enacts new ethics reforms to Drain the Swamp and reduce the corrupting influence of special interests on our politics.On November 8th, Americans will be voting for this 100-day plan to restore prosperity to our economy, security to our communities, and honesty to our government.This is my pledge to you.And if we follow these steps, we will once more have a government of, by and for the people.”DRAIN THE WASHINGTON SWAMP Please copy and paste

5 | Tyler Pahl | 10155507536681509_10155507622856509 | Oh look. Michelle Obama's role model for America. Calling women "hoes" and worse. Talking about drugs. Talking violence. Cheating on his wife. This is the kind of problem that is in America. If we REALLY look at the kind of people the young people in America look up to, we would see why our nation is in such terrible shape. Forget Obama, he has failed this nation, every one knows that, but the real troubling thing is that we have kids who look up to people like Lil Wayne, Jay Z, and Beyonce. How are these individuals good people, let alone role models?
6 | Ben Henderson | 10155507536681509_10155507537476509 | The slimy corrupt anti-American DNC and HRC that you support paid to have Americans attacked..

Those that attack Americans at political rallies and those that pay them are Domestic Terrorists and should be treated as such. We have room at GITMO.
7 | John C Holben | 10155507536681509_10155507538971509 | 'I hope everyone understands what this election is about. This election is not about Trump or Hillary. This election is about we the people taking back the power from our corrupt, elitist government. The reason the Republicans, the Democrats, and the Media are so against Trump is not because of who he is, its because of what he represents. He represents the voice of the people. This election was supposed to be Hillary vs Jeb Bush. The people are tired of the 1% at the top pulling all the strings. On the Republican side we said you were putting Donald Trump in there. On the Democrats side they tried to put Bernie up there but were stifled by a corrupt and rigged DNC headed by Debbie Wassermann Shultz and Hillary Clinton. The powers to be are very very scared of we the people when we stand together. In this election, Donald Trump is really irrelevant. this election is not about him or Hillary. This election is about we the people taking our government back! Remember that on November 8th'
8 | Quinn Baddeley | 10155507536681509_10155507586906509 | This gets better by the day hey all you women who support hillary Clinton. Not only does she take money from countries that will rape you . Listen to some of the songs Jay z sings lol
9 | Kyle Switzer | 10155507536681509_10155507575516509 | Hilary wants a guy who degrades women sing at her concert? That makes sense considering the way some of her foreign donors treat there women. Good choice Hillary.
10 | Dwight Summa | 10155507536681509_10155507576126509 | So classy, so CNN. Trump announces a contract with America! Oh wait CNN isn't about that are you. Giving debate questions to candidates? No you ain't about talking about that either are you. Really crazy how TV journalism, and I use that term very loosely for CNN, has switched roles in that The National Enquirer actually has more credibility than the likes of CNN these days.
11 | Dave Wilcox | 10155507536681509_10155507617701509 | so...Hillary who has condemned trumps view of women and how he disrespects women doesnt mind a rapper who has a history of writing songs disrespecting women and how they are treated like sex objects in his music...she doesnt mind him giving a concert in her name?  Has she returned any of the money that Saudi Arabia and other Muslim nations who treat their women like dirt all the money they have donated to the clinton foundation or given to bill as a birthay present?  She doesnt care one iota about womens rights except when it comes time to getting elected to an office.
12 | Matthew Spiteri | 10155507536681509_10155507551681509 | Pretty sure if he was campaigning for trump every whiner on this forum would be thanking not mocking him. But hey you guys got Ted Nugent - no one's gonna take him from you...
13 | Vickie Clark | 10155507536681509_10155507605521509 | CNN are you covering the fact that Obama lied about not knowing of Clinton's private server? CNN are you covering all the treasonous behavior of Hillary and the corruption at the DOJ and FBI? Or are you just an arm of the democratic national committee, and you are just as corrupt as the rest?
14 | Jonathan Colorado Harbit | 10155507536681509_1785093291746694 | I will vote for Hillary.....ONLY when I see her holdin a cigar, while wearing THE stained, blue dress, admitting that Monica did it better, and CNN broadcasts it LIVE.
15 | Raimi A Hassan | 10155507536681509_1785105561745467 | Oh this foolish guy is doing what obama ask him to do.... how many times have you cheat on Beyoncé? ..... all the evil secret things Clinton family did are covered because they needed her to continue the evil the government are doing
16 | Melvin Dexter | 10155507536681509_10155507599416509 | That's great,get a former crack dealer to vouch on your behalf. I think the Dems and the Repubs should pull both canidates and go back to the drawing board. This election has produced the sorriest excuse for canidates I have ever seen. Where's Ralph Nader?????
17 | Daniel Warstadt | 10155507536681509_10155507558006509 | We need a progressive supreme court, I dread Hillary Clinton, but Trump's judgement is a complete nightmare. We can't afford a Trump presidency, it will set us backwards far back. Hillary should have let Bernie be the nominee, but good golly jee we have to settle with another Clinton. I thank Trump for blocking Bush from becoming president, but he's even worse than Bush :(.
18 | Greg Alexander | 10155507536681509_10155507579306509 | Democrats were so horrified at Trump's comments, and I agree Trump has a long way to go to repent of his sins, but Jay-Z has lyrics just as bad, if not worse, than Trump's words.
19 | Michelle Springer | 10155507536681509_1785115055077851 | Apparently, the FBI forgot to visit the Cornell Law Library. Word for word from the Cornell Law Library Former United States Attorney General Michael Mukasey tells MSNBC that not only is Hillary Clinton's private email server illegal, it "disqualifies" her from holding any federal office. Very specifically points to one federal law, Title 18. Section 2071.For those of us who do not have United States Code committed to memory, here's what it says:“(a) Whoever willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys, or attempts to do so, or, with intent to do so takes and carries away any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both. (b) Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States. As used in this subsection, the term “office” does not include the office held by any person as a retired officer of the Armed Forces of the United States.”Yes, it explicitly states "shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States.Shouldn't voters know that? The media won't tell them. So it's up to us. Post this everywhere
20 | Randy Gibboney | 10155507536681509_10155507618886509 | Never going to happen. The American people have seen the corruption in the media and in Washington. We are sick of it. This election may not even be close. Only a fool would vote 4 Clinton
21 | Carly Garafone-Stevens | 10155507536681509_10155507625406509 | Ha this is a joke right?  His lyrics are disgusting but let's use him to promote Hilary. And then bash Trump from something 11 years ago. Omg what is happening to our country. Open your eyes people.
22 | Noreen Lee Pouliot | 10155507536681509_10155507576551509 | Don't people get it.The Elite owners of this country have Hillary & Co. and all these entertainers in their back pocket. They have all soul....d out to gain higher fame and success in the industry.
23 | Donald Wilson | 10155507536681509_10155507553006509 | I can see this. Drug dealers and race baiters have a long history of working with government. And if there's a candidate that all government without getting side tracked doing what's best for the people it's Hillary Clinton.
24 | Chris Callaghan | 10155507536681509_1785122465077110 | If you can get arrested for hunting or fishing without a license, but not for entering and remaining in the country illegally — you might live in a nation that was founded by geniuses but is run by idiots.If you have to get your parents’ permission to go on a field trip or to take an aspirin in school, but not to get an abortion — you might live in a nation that was founded by geniuses but is run by idiots.If you MUST show your identification to board an airplane, cash a check, buy liquor, or check out a library book and rent a video, but not to vote for who runs the government — you might live in a nation that was founded by geniuses but is run by idiots.If the government wants to prevent stable, law-abiding citizens from owning gun magazines that hold more than ten rounds, but gives twenty F-16 fighter jets to the crazy new leaders in Egypt — you might live in a nation that was founded by geniuses but is run by idiots.If, in the nation’s largest city, you can buy two 16-ounce sodas, but not one 24-ounce soda, because 24-ounces of a sugary drink might make you fat — you might live in a nation that was founded by geniuses but is run by idiots.If an 80-year-old woman who is confined to a wheelchair or a three-year-old girl can be strip-searched by the TSA at the airport, but a woman in a burka or a hijab is only subject to having her neck and head searched — you might live in a nation that was founded by geniuses but is run by idiots.If your government believes that the best way to eradicate trillions of dollars of debt is to spend trillions more — you might live in a nation that was founded by geniuses but is run by idiots.
25 | Miriam Summerall | 10155507536681509_1140604066031133 | To all the racist ignorant ppl on here, jay z is a multi million dollar business man who owns a basketball team!!!! So what was your point again about being a rapper??? He is still the rapper that some of yall white sons and daughters idolize lol

What’s it like to run the Trump campaign? CNN caught up with Kellyanne Conway to find out. http://cnn.it/2epvXki
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Eric Chen | 10155507432916509_10155507436386509 | I wanna see her face when Trump refuses to pay her just like other contractors of this orange.
2 | Shaun Riggs | 10155507432916509_10155507442376509 | One day she will have to tell her girls how she sold her soul to the devil when they were young for an evil orange pumpkin.
3 | Mel Feliz | 10155507432916509_10155507435316509 | The fact that she worked for Cruz before Trump shows that she has no soul left to sell. Whatever she may have had went away a long time ago. What people will do for money....
4 | Stephen Buckman | 10155507432916509_10155507441821509 | CNN ignoring today's Wikileaks emails again. What a slow news day for you guys. FBI wife paid $675,000
5 | Ed de la Garza | 10155507432916509_10155507501321509 | What are all of Don's supporter's doing on this page if they hate CNN so much, coming on here insulting anybody that doesn't worship the Don-Don? No logic or reason, just hate and insults is all they know how to do.
6 | Carmen Doult | 10155507432916509_10155507441301509 | Well she was on the news this morning saying that Clinton is already ahead by double digits. She's probably glad it's almost over.
7 | Don Snow | 10155507432916509_10155507438546509 | Trump knows exactly what he is doing 👍 We going to the White House baby 😎 Trumpnation lets ride 🐎🐎🐎🐎
8 | Ovadia Levy | 10155507432916509_10155507437951509 | I am a syrian voting for Trump, unfortunately most middle easterns are brainwashed into thinking hillary loves them but she only loves their moneyHillary Clinton is a massive media mafia fraudster
9 | Ro Spez | 10155507432916509_10155507473051509 | CNN, Trump & Conway are awesome! No matter how hard you try to make it bad, it's better than ever! All of your rigging efforts are working against you!
10 | Douglas Morgan | 10155507432916509_10155507503546509 | I have to say. It bothers me that KellyAnne Conway is the campaign manager for Trump, especially as a Democrat. But I give her a ton a credit! She is doing Yeoman's work! She is good at it. I wish we had someone like her on the Democratic side. I won't vote for her candidate by any stretch. But I have serious respect for her and what she accomplished in this cycle.
11 | Anna Thomas | 10155507432916509_10155507493646509 | Notice how she didn't make eye contact when answering questions about those woman's allegations, true liars won't make eye contact ever!
12 | Shawn Gustafson Schwerman | 10155507432916509_10155507524161509 | Uh, you do realize that KELLYANNE participated in this interview, invited CNN into her home and sat down with them. She calls the shots on what the media will talk about by what she and Trump talk about. She obviously is ok with this, shouldn't you be. She's just peachy for Trump as long as he signs her checks.
13 | Shanyn Elizabeth Tuck | 10155507432916509_10155507532206509 | I don't support trump at all. But I support a woman doing such a tough job with a level of grace professionalism as she has. She has an incredibly difficult job and she is a fighter. You gotta give it to her.
14 | Abbas Hassan | 10155507432916509_10155507477591509 | Poor lady, hardworking, proud mother of lovely kids but has to defend the indefensible- what a job to have, I don't envy her.
15 | Niklas Lindon | 10155507432916509_10155507484426509 | ⚠️If you are Gay, Why are you voting for Hillary when she wants to bring in thousands of refugees that believe all Gays should be executed?👁⚠️If you are Black, Why are you voting for Hillary when she admires Margaret Sanger and defends Planned Parenthood who want to abort as many black babies as possible? Exterminate the black race because they are like "weeds". (Margaret Sanger quote) Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.👁⚠️If you are a Christian, Why are you voting for Hillary Clinton when she wrote her Senior thesis on Saul Alinsky who dedicated his book 'Rules for Radicals' to Lucifer (the Devil)? She says he was, and still is her mentor.👁⚠️If you are a Veteran, in the Military, or closely related to a Military member, Why are you voting for Hillary when she left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again? They called for help but the help was told to stand down.👁⚠️If you have a factory job, Why are you voting for Hillary when she supported TPP? Factory workers are being laid off because jobs are going over seas. Don't forget the deals she's made with china. She also welcomes open borders and illegals to get benefits to be paid with Your tax money.👁⚠️If you are poor, Why are you voting for Hillary, when she is supporting Wall street and all the big banks? Big banks keep poor people poor by destroying the poor man's credit by allowing medical bills and collections to affect your credit scores so you can pay higher interest rates than the rich; Taking much of the little money you earn.👁⚠️If you are a Woman, how can you vote for Hillary when she has buried all of Bills rape victims under the rug, including that little girl that was raped? Lawyer Hillary defended the rapist, and then she laughed about it later, knowing that he was guilty.If you carry a gun, or believe in the Constitution; How can you vote for Hillary when she wants to eliminate the NRA, Take your guns, and abolish the second Amendment?👁⚠️If you breathe, Why would you vote for Hillary when she and the Clinton crime family have left a trail of dead people that did not agree with her, or they knew too much?Who is left? 👁
16 | Nick Guerrero | 10155507432916509_1192992567440438 | She is so delusional it's laughable. So much so that she even has to keep that uneasy smile and fake laugh on standby just to get through press junkets.When her daughters come of legal age would she be okay with one of them sacking up with a man like Donald trump? I think not!It's obvious she only took the job to raise her name and notoriety. Once things don't go as Donald trump has planned it will only be a matter of time till trump throws her under the bus and blames her for his campaign failures.Let's see what she has to say then!
17 | Regina Anderson | 10155507432916509_10155507513861509 | Imagine it is November 9, 2016 in America and we wake up knowing who our new President will be. If it is Hillary, think of the groups of people that will celebrate. Illegal Immigrants, criminals and future criminals who will be supported for pulling a gun on a police officer, planned parenthood, the media, and the list goes on and on that represent everything that is wrong with America. If you're still "with her," look around at who you'll be celebrating with. Now imagine waking up knowing that Trump is our new President. You may or may not like him, or really know what kind of president he will be. But here are some things you will know for sure:• The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.• The media has been neutered forever.• Career politicians will have lost all job security.• The guns in your home will safely stay there.• Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.• Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally• Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.• No more apologies to the world for being great!• Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.• Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.• There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.• The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.• The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.Copy and paste this as your status if you support and will vote Donald Trump for president 2016.
18 | Doug Baker | 10155507432916509_1885798358309656 | The real game is, and he's gaming - if he loses, he wins because the money he's borrowed, allegedly from Russian oligarchs to fund his campaign, will become tax deductable if he loses - that's $100 million. His narcissistic ego loves the crowd and because "he never loses", he's setting his base to believe he didn't lose "due to rigging". He never wanted to win, because if he did - he loses his tax break. He always used borrowed money to earn his tax-free life-style.
19 | Linda J. Anderson | 10155507432916509_10155507589576509 | Reality is about to take place which will reveal Hillary Clinton as our next President and I think that it's important that people just prepare their hearts and minds to accept it and begin to heal and try to work together as one. It should not come as a surprise that Donald Trump will lose and that's a given so hopefully he will accept the results of the outcome and not try to challenge it by suggesting that the system was rigged, in life, sometimes you win, sometimes you lose it applies to all of us.
20 | Bryan Hebert | 10155507432916509_10155507493316509 | I find it interesting that she is always in the news , is she running for President? Why is she always attempting to explain DT? Does not his words or actions speak for himself and that he always needs to be explained by some else?
21 | Loweta J Carroll | 10155507432916509_1193036477436047 | After her candidate loses, (badlyyyy) what will her resume read? Would you hire the woman for ANY executive position? No. Mr. Trump has already bought and paid for her. She will walk away from this wealthy. I guarantee she has known for months, Trump can't win. Trump knows it now as well. Which is why he created the "rigged election" nonsense.
22 | Tyler Mckinnon | 10155507432916509_10155507538951509 | All you entitlement seekers who are hoping to have everything paid for by others, thanks to HRC...are in for a big surprise.   If she wins...who do you think is going to pay for the free college or the healthcare...just ask our friends up north in Canada who pays or over in Europe...who pays....you have no idea what income tax high rates are...but you just might find out.   Keep drinking your Koolaid...it will be fun to watch you all squirm
23 | Mathew Pharias | 10155507432916509_10155507597796509 | Why dont you investigate what Hillary had to hide in 30000 mails Phones and Hard discs that she and her supporters had to destroy it.Or you just dont want people know your real journalism and reporting😂
24 | Daniel Henderson | 10155507432916509_1885806454975513 | Amazing that CNN can even turn what should be a nice story about a historic topic (first female campaign manager for a major candidate) and turn it into a hit piece. What a corrupt rag CNN has become.
25 | Navajo Crowdmanager | 10155507432916509_1885808281641997 | Of course Trumps going to win btw only thing polls are good for....... is pole vaulting I'd also sue CNN for defamation slander gross negligence and a premeditated w/malicious intent interferene with a federal presidential election by continually and haitually without disclaimers and or the presumption of innocent clause, stated as a matter of fact in my opinion said candidate was guilty of a felony . In so doing did irreparable harm to said presidential bid , brand and charachter of Trump again in my opinion..
