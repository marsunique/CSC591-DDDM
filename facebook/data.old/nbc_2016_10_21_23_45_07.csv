"It's at a point it has to be stopped or there is no stopping it," one man allegedly said in a text message to an undercover FBI agent in which he also referred to Somali immigrants as "cockroaches."

Trump and his supporters believe the real threat to Americans are the immigrants and they need to be deported. However the majority of mass murders have been committed by whites. Is Trump planning to deport them too? Of course not! He needs to stop spreading so much hate. Not all whites are criminals. Not all blacks are criminals. Not all immigrants are criminals. Not all Hispanics are criminals.
2 | Richard Rogers | 1542589915761033_1542590772427614 | I advise Mr. Obama to get back to work. His job's not done yet. I'm tired of him wasting taxpayer money! They are doing the best they can to rig this election. That's not whining, that's common sense. It's still not working! Hillary Clinton has had her silence purchased by the Middle East. These countries have even purchased a 550% increase in the number of refugees that will be brought to America from her. Countries that marry 10 year old little girls off to men 4 times their age to be one of 4 or 5 wife's, these countries allow their women to be raped nightly by their husbands with no recourse, they throw gays off buildings, they burn witches, they drown people of different faiths, we are talking about countries that are still in the 13th century as far as human/civil rights are concerned. In addition to these atrocities, Hillary Clinton has also been the most controversial political figure of all time. She has sold the government. She has no product, she has no service, she sells the government. It has also been proven through released emails that she and her party are biased against Christians, Jews, Mexicans, African Americans, Patriots, or anyone that doesn't agree with her. She has been caught up in as many sexual scandals as anybody else I know. She helped to destroy those women's lives when they accused Bill of his transgressions. In short, get out of the political influence business. You too Family Guy or at least deal in an even-handed fashion. #familyguy #trump2016 #nobama

1 | Tara Menge Hernandez | 1542568149096543_1542588249094533 | This is a wonderful story. I am so proud of all parties. Im so sorry that your message was overshadowed with the hate speech in these comments, by people who couldn't be bothered to read it.
2 | Lucie Barr | 1542568149096543_1542592169094141 | We have another chance to abolish the death penalty in California next month. Let's make this happen. Please if you're a progressive or even just a critical thinker you need to vote to abolish the death penalty in November!! Please share this with your CA friends.-we spend hundreds of millions of dollars more on death row inmates than we would if we transferred them to life without parole.-we spend more on prisoners than we do students. Why are we spending so much money on a handful of criminals when we can use that money to educate millions of children?-the reason the average prisoner is on death row for over 2 decades is because they haven't been proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. 85-90% of court cases involve NO DNA EVIDENCE so many people are convicted of crimes based on faulty and unscientific methods. Many people are exonerated from death row after being proved innocent which means we had previously sentenced an innocent person to death! That is not acceptable.

"I've lost elections. You don't feel very good the next day, do you? But we know in our country the difference between leadership and dictatorship, right?" Hillary Clinton asked a crowd.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Coni Brooks | 1542555402431151_1542559112430780 | I don't blame Trump. Virginia media claimed there are 20 dead votes that were found. Homeland Security are in several states checking votes. PA is one of them. Virginia media saying Soro placed so many voting machines in 16 different states. If there are dead votes, it is concidered rigged votes.
2 | Cory Bennett | 1542555402431151_1542567469096611 | You rigged the Dem nomination process. We're supposed to just 'believe' you now? ...after #Wikileaks too? And the job itself is more than four hours. A monkey coulda argued with him on stage for four hours. #DemExit
3 | Michael Kopp | 1542555402431151_1542560649097293 | LAWRENCEVILLE, Ga. -- Hazmat crews in Gwinnett County were called to clean up waste left behind by a Democratic Party Hillary clinton s  campaign bus.According to a Lawrenceville Police Department report, officers were called to the O'Reilly Auto Parts at 525 Grayson Highway after receiving reports that an RV was illegally dumping its sewage into the storm drain. Already shitting  on amercains
4 | Aaron Stallsmith | 1542555402431151_1542563842430307 | Donald Trump's candidacy has been extremely poisonous to our nation. He's taken a portion of our population and turned them into extremists almost on the level radical Islam. Hell, I wouldn't be suprised if him losing the election causes a surge in Neo Con terrorist groups. I shudder to think what damage would result from four years of him being in office.
5 | Cullen Patrick | 1542555402431151_1542559669097391 | Hillary will lose, the liberal media will drown, the un-American liberal  will be deported to pussy foot island and America will be great again! I will just be happy not to talk to dumb f**ck liberals anymore!
6 | Rockwell Torrey | 1542555402431151_1542560802430611 | This is your moment. This is your time to take a stand. When your grandchildren speak of you they will recount that you stood for America. You did not surrender. You did not run away. You held strong for freedom and the Constitution. You defeated Hillary Clinton. You voted Trump. You ensured that America survived.

8 | Don Januszewski | 1542555402431151_1542563365763688 | Hillary would destroy our country.. just look at her lies, deceit, an donators fraud to name just a few.  her emails show her true heart, an it isnt good..information found in the WikiLeaks dumps of John Podesta’s emails confirms “everything” written in Breitbart News Editor-At-Large Peter Schweizer’s book Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary. “These WikiLeaks dumps are documenting practically everything that Schweizer wrote,” Limbaugh said. “Everything in Schweizer’s book — we didn’t need it documented, we knew it was true.”“That book nails the Clintons.”The conservative talk radio legend was responding to a caller who said he educates potential voters by explaining to them how then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton helped broker the sale of 20% of U.S. uranium to the Russian government.Indeed, in 2010, Clinton approved the transfer of half of U.S. Uranium output to the Kremlin.As Clinton Cash documents in great detail, Hillary Clinton’s State Department was one of eight agencies to review the deal — but Hillary Clinton was the only agency head whose family foundation received $145 million in donations from people connected to the sale, as reported by the New York Times.In fact, Ian Telfer, the head of the Russian government’s uranium company, made a secret $2.35 million foreign donation to the Clinton Foundation, a Times investigation confirmed:    As the Russians gradually assumed control of Uranium One in three separate transactions from 2009 to 2013, Canadian records show, a flow of cash made its way to the Clinton Foundation. Uranium One’s chairman used his family foundation to make four donations totaling $2.35 million … Other people with ties to the company made donations as well.Bill Clinton also received a $500,000 speaking fee for a speech in Moscow paid for by a Russian government-connected bank.“And, in one case, a Russian investment bank connected to the deals paid money to Bill Clinton personally, through a half-million-dollar speaker’s fee,” reports the New Yorker.“The drive-bys are not reporting it,” Limbaugh fumed. “They don’t have him on as a guest to explain it. They ignore it, or try to ridicule it.”Before it was released last year, the New York Times bestselling investigative exposé Clinton Cash was being called the “most anticipated and feared book of a presidential cycle,” according to the New York Times.Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson

It is also a attack on our democracy and 1st amendment rights. So I jumped ship. Now after watching the media coverage and Hillary saying that Trump is the Hitler devil for the past year .I find out the Hillary campaign has been paying protesters to attack Trump supporters inside and outside rally's. Calling Americans deplorables? Really? This is not the Democrat party I signed up for. I'm now anti government. I will vote Donald J Trump before this corrupt government kills America for good .

Sure you know all about this. She reminds me of that woman on Dateline who killed her husband with his meds only to marry a wanna be scumbag con artist who stole over a million dollars from the VA administration.

By Federal law, this means Hillary Clinton is ineligible to run for President, according to 18 U.S.C. § 2071(b), which states:“Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States.”
21 | Sam Gadalla | 1542555402431151_1542566582430033 | Trump admitted on air that he walked into Miss USA dressing rooms so he could see the teen contestants naked. This is criminal and should be prosecuted.“I’ll tell you the funniest is that I’ll go backstage before a show and everyone's getting dressed,” Trump told Stern in recordings released Saturday by CNN. “No men are anywhere, and I’m allowed to go in, because I’m the owner of the pageant and therefore I’m inspecting it…. ‘Is everyone OK’? You know, they’re standing there with no clothes. "
22 | Angel Diaz | 1542555402431151_1542591902427501 | Well she is right. Look at all you now bashing her thinking there is going to be voter fraud.

1 | Bonnie Carter | 1452212104796023_1455216777828889 | Why is it that both candidates for president seem to think that we live in a democracy? Can't someone please tell them that we are governed by a republic. Look up the differences, and make up your own mind as to the reason even the news casters are letting this take place.
2 | Bird Heaven | 1452212104796023_1455182201165680 | Just hours after Hillary Clinton dodged a question at the final presidential debate about charges of "pay to play" at the Clinton Foundation, a new batch of WikiLeaks emails surfaced with stunning charges that the candidate herself was at the center of negotiating a $12 million commitment from King Mohammed VI of Morocco.One of the more remarkable parts of the charge is that the allegation came from Clinton's loyal aide, Huma Abedin, who described the connection in a January 2015 email exchange with two top advisers to the candidate, John Podesta and Robby Mook.Abedin wrote that "this was HRC's idea" for her to speak at a meeting of the Clinton Global Initiative in Morocco in May 2015 as an explicit condition for the $12 million commitment from the king."She created this mess and she knows it," Abedin wrote to Podesta and Mook.The "mess" refers in part to the fact that the three Clinton advisers were discussing the possibility of the former secretary of state pulling out of speaking at the May 2015 event because it was happening one month after the official launch of her presidential campaign and could raise more questions about her role at the foundation.In April 2015, Politico reported the Clinton Foundation was accepting a "major donation" of at least $1 million from a Moroccan government-owned company, OCP, a phosphate exporter. Politico added that an official at the foundation said it was "unlikely" Hillary would attend the May 2015 event, just weeks after the April launch of her campaign.

6 | Brian Carter | 1452212104796023_1455213204495913 | Hillary Spokesman Showed Reporter Phone, What Happens Next PROVES ItPosted by Matthew Bernstein | Oct 21, 2016 | Liberal CorruptionThe numerous amounts of WikiLeaks releases have shown that the media has been on Hillary Clintons side the entire time! They have shown that New York Times reporters are asking what they can do to help Hillary and her failing campaign.Every mainstream media source, outside of Fox News, has had a clear form of bias against the Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump. Whether it is their refusal to air any of the WikiLeaks releases or they consistently air comments made by Trump over ten years ago, they have shown that they are for Clinton.There is something else to add to the mix. There is video evidence that shows that NBC reporter Andrea Mitchell appeared to receive a question to ask from Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill. Not only did she receive the question, but also she even ASKED it!This came after the Wednesday night debate when Clinton was speaking with reporters for a little while. What occurs is that Clinton is speaking to the crowd and Merrill can be seen behind her typing on a phone. After he is done typing he then shows the phone to Mitchell, who does a quick nod in approval.Now nothing is actually said between the two and it’s impossible to tell what is on the phone, but the fact that the media has been coordinating with the Clinton campaign in the past shows that this is more than likely. Not to mention that she looks at the phone and nods before asking the question.Plus, the question that was asked wasn’t hard hitting at all. “How did you feel when he [Trump] said, you know, ‘Nasty woman, nasty woman,’ and ‘You’re a puppet,’ and… the issue of Vladimir Putin?” What kind of a question is that? Not to mention that it was Clinton who originally called Trump a puppet and he just sent the comment right back.But these are the types of questions that the media has been used to asking Clinton. There is nothing about her policy, nothing about the WikiLeaks releases, and absolutely nothing substantial! The question was how she felt because of a comment that Trump made.Naturally Clinton took the opportunity to attack Trump for not accepting that Russia is tied to the efforts of WikiLeaks. But again this type of question is exactly what Clinton has been getting all campaign. They’re all about how she feels and anything related to thatHow is that relative to anything that the voters have to go through? There are more important issues that need to be discussed, like the terrorist threat, Clinton’s continued assault on Russia, and jobs! Yet they are more focused on asking how she felt after some comments?And now this shows that members of the media might be receiving questions to ask Clinton from members of her staff? But there is also something else that should be noted. After Merrill appeared to give the question to Mitchell, he seemed to text something else to someone because he gave a “check your phone” gesture to someone else.It could possibly be another question that a reporter is going to ask! We don’t know whom he was sending the text to, but considering that he showed Mitchell a question that he wanted her to ask, nothing is out of the question.Naturally Mitchell denied everything about it. “I was on live and couldn’t see in the crush of the gaggle – but no way would anyone try to give me a question. That would never happen.” If that is the case, then you wouldn’t mind telling us what was on that phone.After all if it was something non important then you would have no trouble saying exactly what was on it. And considering the fact that the media has been in the pocket of the Clinton campaign for a long time, you would do whatever you could to make sure that you didn’t get caught in this. But all you give is that denial?That just raises more questions. But it also shows something else. The media will say and do anything to deny their involvement with the Clinton campaign. This evidence shows that clearly Mitchell liked what was on Merrill’s phone! Otherwise she wouldn’t have nodded in agreement.Plus if the media really wasn’t biased, why are they only giving the softball questions to Clinton and not to Trump? They never ask how he feels after Clinton attacks him. No they only ask him questions that they should be asking the both of them!But this isn’t the first time that the media has been completely against Trump. They have been helping Clinton since the start! They have shown that they have been helping Clinton with some of her scandals and everything that is involved with it. This includes some of the news media that is cutting feeds when people bring up the WikiLeaks scandal.They actually cut the feed and try to play it off like it was an accident. That couldn’t be any less of the truth because it happened seconds after the Congressman brought up the WikiLeaks releases.Not only that but as stated before, the New York Times has been controlled by the Clinton campaign as well. They are actively doing what they can to make sure that nothing bad about Clinton gets posted.Share this article to show that Clinton’s campaign staff might be telling the news media exactly what questions to ask. This just happened with Andrea Mitchell. The evidence shows that she was shown something on one of her staffers phones and then she asked a softball sized question.This is just another reason that we need to vote for Trump. Because the news media is apparently just going to ask questions that they were given from Clinton’s staffers. They aren’t going to ask anything substantial about the electionhttps://youtu.be/FqYQ2OtggPw

The villa has opened to the public after the frugal Pope Francis decided not to use it, judging it too luxurious and grandiose.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Maurice St Pierre | 1542328305787194_1542503942436297 | What beautiful artwork and architecture that can now be shared with the world....even those that think a news article on the Vatican is reason to trash President Obama and Hillary Clinton.
2 | Joye Frady | 1542328305787194_1542516009101757 | Mother Teresa said when a people kills their unborn they fall.... Reagan said funny people who think abortion is a good thing are already BORN.....all children are gifts from GOD....the POPE knows this..... Liberals Democrats not much....
3 | Douglas Flynt | 1542328305787194_1542536622433029 | Yeah. The Commie Pope is a stinking communist. Karl Marx in a big hat. I'm shocked NBC News hasn't made him the anchorman for their nightly news broadcasts that no one watches.
4 | Richard Rogers | 1542328305787194_1542501642436527 | I advise Mr. Obama to get back to work. His job's not done yet. I'm tired of him wasting taxpayer money! They are doing the best they can to rig this election. That's not whining, that's common sense. It's still not working! Hillary Clinton has had her silence purchased by the Middle East. These countries have even purchased a 550% increase in the number of refugees that will be brought to America from her. Countries that marry 10 year old little girls off to men 4 times their age to be one of 4 or 5 wife's, these countries allow their women to be raped nightly by their husbands with no recourse, they throw gays off buildings, they burn witches, they drown people of different faiths, we are talking about countries that are still in the 13th century as far as human/civil rights are concerned. In addition to these atrocities, Hillary Clinton has also been the most controversial political figure of all time. She has sold the government. She has no product, she has no service, she sells the government. It has also been proven through released emails that she and her party are biased against Christians, Jews, Mexicans, African Americans, Patriots, or anyone that doesn't agree with her. She has been caught up in as many sexual scandals as anybody else I know. She helped to destroy those women's lives when they accused Bill of his transgressions. In short, get out of the political influence business. You too Family Guy or at least deal in an even-handed fashion. #familyguy #trump2016 #nobama

Time for a fresh manicure? A woman in Mexico may have come up with the scariest nail art ever – dead scorpions.

3 | Cortney Holt | 1541227365897288_1542528782433813 | It's a bug people, I'm sure most of you squish flys in your house and chomp down on your hormone infused hamburgers and you all are getting your panties in a bunch over a bug 🙄🙄
4 | Malaya Sappa | 1541227365897288_1542489632437728 | Wow!!!a smart woman can put dead animals on her nails Seriously She doesn't know if that can be smelly awful Seriously Disgusting
5 | Elizabeth Rosario | 1541227365897288_1542525349100823 | Y'all say inhumane yet wear fox fur to keep yourselves warm in the winter and have goose feathers for pillows. Don't be hypocritical now.
6 | Elizabeth Kelley Olsen | 1541227365897288_1542539392432752 | Scorpions along with black widow spiders can all just die off yew ! Not because they are ugly but because I'm allergic to both along with the anti-venom so I'd rather not have to worry everytime I reach for something in a dark place
7 | Teresa DiLenge | 1541227365897288_1542528125767212 | A scorpion decal would be easier & less expensive.  I'm not their demographic, but I'd never use a real insect or animal as a fashion accessory.   Plus dead insects on my fingers?   No friggin way...but that's just me!!
8 | Allie Coe | 1541227365897288_1542539605766064 | I'm wondering if it's the molted exoskeleton that she uses instead of the actual scorpion.  Maybe this article just isn't as accurate as it could be.........I would be curious to find out directly from her but I'm waaaaaaay too far from Mexico lol
9 | Elizabeth R. Martin | 1541227365897288_1542545222432169 | He'll no. To each their own but I'm pretty sure I'd have a panic attack before it was done. I'll stick with French tips thank you.

11 | Coral Garcia | 1541227365897288_1542549262431765 | Louise this is what I was telling you about today.  Mexican news said the scorpions were alive... I don't like them dead or alive anyways 🦂🦂😱😬😬
12 | Don Clancy | 1541227365897288_1542503792436312 | Why not use a picture or sticker?   Why in the world would you want a dead animal glued to your finger?
13 | Larry Parsons | 1541227365897288_672701962903269 | Lol wow the creature lovers are just to funny. And there reason on why not to do this is even more laughable. Smh brainwashing is a serious problem in America and not only that it's causeing people to get stupider by the second.
14 | Christine Marie | 1541227365897288_672700029570129 | Cruelty just unacceptable just as bad or worse than China using live miniature turtles to make key chains. They want to live as much as we do.
15 | Jerusha Hardman | 1541227365897288_1542524505767574 | I cannot stand scorpions but this is just wrong. They are living things, not fashion accessories.

1 | Brad Paul Smith | 1542450055775019_1542456392441052 | Did I miss something or are all you commenters out of your minds. This isn't a political post!!!!
2 | Richard Rogers | 1542450055775019_1542451749108183 | I advise Mr. Obama to get back to work. His job's not done yet. I'm tired of him wasting taxpayer money! They are doing the best they can to rig this election. That's not whining, that's common sense. It's still not working! Hillary Clinton has had her silence purchased by the Middle East. These countries have even purchased a 550% increase in the number of refugees that will be brought to America from her. Countries that marry 10 year old little girls off to men 4 times their age to be one of 4 or 5 wife's, these countries allow their women to be raped nightly by their husbands with no recourse, they throw gays off buildings, they burn witches, they drown people of different faiths, we are talking about countries that are still in the 13th century as far as human/civil rights are concerned. In addition to these atrocities, Hillary Clinton has also been the most controversial political figure of all time. She has sold the government. She has no product, she has no service, she sells the government. It has also been proven through released emails that she and her party are biased against Christians, Jews, Mexicans, African Americans, Patriots, or anyone that doesn't agree with her. She has been caught up in as many sexual scandals as anybody else I know. She helped to destroy those women's lives when they accused Bill of his transgressions. In short, get out of the political influence business. You too Family Guy or at least deal in an even-handed fashion. #familyguy #trump2016 #nobama
3 | Denise A Spencer | 1542450055775019_1542454995774525 | Republicans for 50 years have pushed tax cuts for the rich while ignoring stagnant wages for the middle class. Now we have a 20 trillion debt from borrowing from China to pay for republicans tax policy for the rich.... and republicans call for robbing the middle class social security retirement funds we have all paid into to pay for their borrowing from China.

5 | Yvonne Clerebout | 1542450055775019_1542465939106764 | After Lincoln was assassinated, Johnson thwarted Republican efforts in Congress to recognize the civil rights of the freed slaves, and Southern Democrats continued to thwart any such efforts for close to a century.  In outright defiance of the Republican-led federal government, Southern Democrats formed organizations that violently intimidated blacks and Republicans who tried to win political power. The most prominent of these, the Ku Klux Klan, was formed in Pulaski, Tennessee, in 1865.

Rep. Brian Babin said Hillary Clinton is "saying some nasty things."
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | James Raynor | 1542416479111710_1542424009110957 | "Nasty", is when you cheat on your wife! "Nasty", is when you ADMITTEDLY walk up to females & kissing while grouping them (whether they want it or not) b/c you're a "star". "Nasty", is the way you speak of/about women. "Nasty", is the comments YOU MAKE about your OWN daughter!...THAT'S fk'n nasty!!!
2 | Connie Schroeder | 1542416479111710_1542419722444719 | wasting taxpayer money? now that is funny when the republicans have waited millions on Obamacare and e-mails to no avail. as for a rigged election that is balogna. Mr. Trump won't win and he proves everytime he opens his sarcastic mouth
3 | Terrell Sanzone | 1542416479111710_1542421815777843 | Yeah right.  Just remember Women wear their testosterone on their breastplates.  Just because some men don't like women who can dish it out as well as them, doesn't mean she's nasty.  It means she's assertive and formidable so bugger off!
4 | Christi Long | 1542416479111710_1542425975777427 | Let me get this straight....a man who said she has "deep hatred in her heart" and calls her the "devil" and "crooked Hillary" and chants "lock her up" and calls other people:LosersDummiesFat pigsDogsFat slobsFilthy animalsLittle MarcoLying TedCrazy BernieLow Energy JebGoofy Elizabeth WarrenPocahontasMiss PiggyMiss HousekeepingEating machine And who makes fun of his opponent's face and also another opponent's wife's looks...and says he grabs women's private parts because he's famous....wants to call someone NASTY??And this dude is supporting him for putting the "misbehaving little woman" in her place?I feel like I'm being Punk'd.
5 | Tina Miley | 1542416479111710_1542430152443676 | Only when a man feels threatened by a woman would he call her nasty. These men are afraid of Hillary because she is smarter, more prepared and more compassionate than all of those bozos put together.
6 | Matt Norcross | 1542416479111710_1542418512444840 | This is a big tempest in a teapot and is a confluence of sexist and ageist stereotypes, as if Hillary is this incompetent woman who doesn't need to run for office, as if she is this corrupt and lawless female.... if it were a man, there wouldn't be this much scrutiny. Only men hate her.
7 | Rissa Sefick | 1542416479111710_1542423575777667 | Can we just talk about how she was talking about funding Medicare, Medicaid, and social security when trump said she was nasty? Cause thats so nasty to want to help people omg.
8 | Allie Maiocchi | 1542416479111710_1542473909105967 | Let me explain something to ya'll...the meanest, nastiest, most vengeful, and strongest person is a woman when she is mad...if she is southern...I would advise that you sleep with one eye open...nasty or not she is the strongest female I know right now...because I would have knocked Mr. T's smug and foul mouthed face into next Tuesday by now...and I would not have cared who saw me! Keeping it under control in the presence of such a creep takes great control on her part.
9 | M Hilal Arfeen | 1542416479111710_1542419512444740 | Hillary is a better candidate for presidency as compare to play boy trump who's life is full of women harrassment and making fun of everyone stories.Donald trump will be badly defeat in the elections after exposed in front of nation.He should join some comedy theaters to entertain publicSay no to trump a characterless,ruthless leader
10 | Carol Snyder | 1542416479111710_1542498952436796 | Funny how Trump says truly nasty things but Hillary gets called "nasty" for suggesting Trump might try to find a way to avoid paying increased SS taxes. Talk about a double standard that truly hobbles women. Trump (and Rep. Babin) are just babies.
11 | Kenny Smythe | 1542416479111710_1542432275776797 | Its so nice to see a Nasty Women take it to Mr Nasty and his Chinese Steel world of foreign products. Its time to put this man out in the field with the rest of the non-proforming Animals
12 | Jose Chan | 1542416479111710_1542457235774301 | Nothing on this earth can be compared with Trump's nastiness. He is a misogynist, bigot, narcissist and classless candidate running for the presidency of a powerful country...
13 | Grecelda Corina Ahumada-Navarrete | 1542416479111710_1542475279105830 | Trump is a misogynist, bigot and a sexual predator. He belongs in jail for sexually assaulting a 13 year old and all the others. Texas congressman call your wife what ever you want but remember that you can get a slap. At least, I would slap your mouth for calling me any name that wasn't given to me at birth. The men in,my family respect all women, young and old. Hope we can vote you , Ted Cruz and Gregg Abbott out of office. We don't need you Republican gentleman running our state.
14 | Mike Wood | 1542416479111710_1542503055769719 | Was listening to your commentary. NBC is complaining that Mr. Trump is acting irresponsibly by calling you out. We are not being mislead by Trump. Ms. Brazille. one of your own (sic) journalist is passing questions. You must believe that we are too stupid to see the way you try to "steer" the public in a certain direction. Trump is not irresponsible, he's calling you out for what you are. You are not used to people calling you liars and deceivers. This is what you are. During the last thirty years the fourth estate has gone from unbiased to  critical condition and now is on life support. Edward R Morrow and Ernie Pyle are spinning in their graves. Do you even remember unbiased reporting? How about courage and integrity? These words have to have some meaning? Check the dictionary, it's been a while since you've practiced both.
15 | Greg Perry | 1542416479111710_1542471695772855 | Of the two candidates running for president...Only Hillary Clinton was caught lying to congress.Only Hillary Clinton was fired from a job for being unethical.Only Hillary Clinton deleted 30 some thousand emails after she was ordered to hand them over to the Fed.Only Hillary Clinton had that same computer wiped clean by professionals.Only Hillary Clinton got the rapist of a teenage girl off on rape charges then laughed about it.Only Hillary Clinton lied to the American people about Benghazi.Only Hillary Clinton lied to the American people about her emails.Only Hillary Clinton lied about being under sniper fire.Only Hillary Clinton lied about lying to the American people.Only Hillary Clinton was involved in " Cash Cow "Only Hillary Clinton has a long list of scandals.Only Hillary Clinton nationally belittled her husband's sexual harassment ( and rape ) accusers.Only Hillary Clinton is a career politician.Only Hillary Clinton will not release her speeches to Goldman Sachs and other banks.Only Hillary Clinton is tied to Monsanto.Only Hillary Clinton was labeled " Extremely careless " about national security by the FBI !Only Hillary Clinton said she will raise taxes on the middle class.Only Hillary Clinton benefited from the DNC rigging an election !Only Hillary Clinton had to return stolen items from the White House.Only Hillary Clinton said the Benghazi victims parents where lying.Only Hillary Clinton wants you to vote for her based on her gender.Only Hillary Clinton has no real accomplishments after a lifetime in politics.Only Hillary Clinton has never created any jobs.Only Hillary Clinton has been investigated by the FBI and found to have put national security at risk.Only Hillary Clinton has had two or more movies and several documentaries made about her questionable ethics.Only Hillary Clinton was called "Broomstick one" by the SS.Only Hillary Clinton made congress and others spend millions and millions of tax dollars having hearings and investigating her to find that she lied, that would not have been spent if she would of simply told the truth in the first place ! Fact - all facts !Only Hillary Clinton regularly cussed out and belittled her SS detail.Only Hillary Clinton Only Hillary Clinton Only Hillary Clinton over and over again.But you are going to vote for her because.... You don't like Donald Trump ? That is insane !I will never understand how any moral person in good conscience could vote for this woman.(This is just a small percentage of a much longer list
16 | Patrice Jones Trapp | 1542416479111710_1542530682433623 | This guy is a CHAUVENIST just like the deplorable leader these guys need to know that women are just as capable as they are but they want to toss STONES when the women are stronger and smarter the them, shame on you does your wife allow you to do this
17 | Robin Ebling | 1542416479111710_1542565195763505 | Wow. Amazing double standard!  Also, too many people spouting all sorts of crazy, unsubstantiated, rumors. Women, especially, should be smarter. They have had to fight for rights which are on the chopping block in this election. Sad.
18 | Rickie L Davis | 1542416479111710_1542552725764752 | Hillary is nasty and everyone should be worried if she get elected . If your happy with how our country is being run then you should vote Hillary . If your tired of our polititions running our country for their own agendas then it's time for change . Hillary is not the answare . She has proven that already .
19 | Pressoir Wadnes | 1542416479111710_1542422682444423 | Rigged elections was supposed to happen in third world countries not America. Hillary Clinton might be the female version of Adolf Hitler. Who would be killed first jews,black,Latino or the mix race.
20 | Lila Perez | 1542416479111710_1542519695768055 | Babin saying this is typical of many politicians who think a woman's place is not equal to theirs. I Hope we still have intelligent Women in Texas that can vote this a$$$hole out of office and send him to oblivion
21 | Cynthia Streett | 1542416479111710_1542471212439570 | All the time, a Texan GOP Rep, entitled wealthy man, needs to be told to "SHUT UP, you are a nasty, sexist, narcissistic, secular, arrogant and controlling man. If you wish to converse with HILLARY, take a number Mr. Reprehensible
22 | Tonya W Boyd | 1542416479111710_1542454775774547 | We all do Christi. As a woman of color (who doesn't nor has ever lived in the slums. Homeowner college graduate gainfully employed taxpayer), with two Black sons, one who serves his country and the other who has special needs, as a divorced woman who's husband cheated, as a woman with grown woman curves, as a thinking feeling human being, I cannot for the life of me understand how anyone can listen to the nonsensical rants of this egomaniac and think, oh yeah, that's what we need in a president. Ashton Kutcher should've jumped out by now on this unfunny joke that has been the 2016 Presidential race.
23 | Bob Skinner | 1542416479111710_1542473462439345 | His ego just like trump shows the ignorance level they have .I don't care if your even a trump fan , you have to see that she has more strength, wit , composer and without a doubt brains than these bafoons .In all my years the only logical explanation for guys like this is either low esteem or lack of courage.When they need to try and be / look better than the next person all they can resort to is degrading or belittling because they can't smart themselves ahead of the person .
24 | Marinés Romero de Lares | 1542416479111710_1542431729110185 | Never, in my entire life, I saw a business man, rich or millionaire, with some kind of studies or career, traveled (viajado) – We use that adjective when a person has been in many countries and we suppose has a broad cultural perspective, etc- … saying to a lady, who happens to have been a First Lady, etc..  NASTY = REPUGNANTE… never until now that Trump apart of this, also said he will not accept the results IF he will not win. Good-bye, Democracy because he has not clarified what he will start to do IF he does not win. A revolution like Hugo Chavez in Venezuela? Who finished the Democracy in a country and now they have 16 years under his regimen?
25 | Gill Jingle | 1542416479111710_1542430359110322 | Hillary Clinton has made it crystal clear. Anyone who votes for her is voting for greatly expanded warfare in the Middle East and probably military confrontation with Russia elsewhere as well.

"Why is Obama campaigning? He ought to be out working."

- Donald J. Trump criticizes President Obama for campaigning for Hillary Clinton. Read more: http://nbcnews.to/2eCpiRI
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Brad Preston | 1542345459118812_1542392309114127 | Every second-term president in modern history has campaigned for the presidential nominee of their party. Trump needs to stop being a #whinylittlebitch.
2 | Steven Kloock | 1542345459118812_1542393032447388 | To keep a dangerous moron out of office? Yeah, that's why he's campaigning. It's literally the most patriotic thing he could be doing with his time.
3 | Carlos Cabrera | 1542345459118812_1542396282447063 | Trumpet just said, "we have a bunch of babies running our country." Lol this man has been doing nothing but whining and accuses others of being "babies." Just great.
4 | Enrique Melendez | 1542345459118812_1542391805780844 | Why aren't Republicans working in Congress? He is a bad hombre.
5 | Devin Scott Rucker | 1542345459118812_1542397205780304 | Because as our Commander in Chief, he's obligated to protect us from Donald Trump, a clear and present danger to national security and foreign relations. Donald needs to stop pouting and start planning that new line of motor lodge motels for all the deplorables who continue to support his hate and bigotry-filled campaign!
6 | Rachel Rader | 1542345459118812_1542395162447175 | maybe because he knows that he is less than 100 days from office and whatever he tries to do will be blocked at this point. Also every outgoing president campaigns for their successor.
7 | Pamela Garner | 1542345459118812_1542397549113603 | He's definitely showing his true colors on what he REALLY knows about being the President of the United States....Absolutely NOTHING. Must he keep making a complete fool of himself? 😂😂😂
8 | Mike Hoover | 1542345459118812_1542391612447530 | How can he do any work with this GOP Congress, they obstruct anything he does.
9 | Beth Harrison | 1542345459118812_1542397662446925 | Because that's what they do. Trump you just don't have what it takes. You are not presidential! Can't wait to see The hissy fit you pull when you lose because you're a sore loser.
10 | Pam Bray | 1542345459118812_1542394989113859 | How many Wikileaks do we need to see and read about Hillary Clinton and her minions before we say enough is enough and start legal action against her. She is so corrupt, treasonous.
11 | Rhoda Robinson Brown | 1542345459118812_1542392445780780 | Sucks to be Trump.Not one living president or their wives are voting for him.This speaks volumes when they all have done the job and they know he can't
12 | Alex Garcia | 1542345459118812_1542405512446140 | He has been working... working hard. In fact, he's been tirelessly advocating for Judge Merrick Garland to be given a up or down vote in the Senate and Republican Senators are the ones NOT DOING their job. How about calling them out Mr. Donald J. Trump?  Just a thought, you know... since we are calling people out on not working.
13 | Vincent LeMarc Greer | 1542345459118812_1542402842446407 | Every time this guy opens his mouth... it is to whine and cry! Talk about implementing policy, talk about ending the war in Afghanistan, talk about climate change, talk about education, talk about tax reform? This guy is just a big wind bag.
14 | Francis Tetteh | 1542345459118812_1542407459112612 | Trump Please ask John MCain, Mitt Romney and Pres. George Bush to campaign for you. You're so poisonous that your own party honchos don't support you! Stop squealing man-boy.
15 | Sue Rex Michael | 1542345459118812_1542408669112491 | As George Takei has explained, he is obligated "to protect his citizens from threats, both foreign and domestic"
16 | Jay Drescher | 1542345459118812_1596597043981482 | As we ponder the future and look in the rear view mirror, the indignities heaped on Pres Obama and his family make me wince. He served and has earned a break. If the Constitution had not been amended, he would likely have earned another term.
17 | Matt Leeds | 1542345459118812_1542406162446075 | He is a absolute disgrace. What a horrible disgusting piece of scum he is. Just a immature whining loser!!! He's not even a man... Trump is a coward. He won't even accept the outcome of the election when he loses. After the last debate he has officially lost he has no chance. He is pathetic. This sorry excuse of a human is a Blue Falcon. #BlueFalcon
18 | Brooks Portman | 1542345459118812_1542401039113254 | Apparently Trump doesn't understand how Capitol Hill works. These worthless Republicans have been blocking everything Obama has tried to do in his second term. Including nominating a new Supreme Court Justice. Luckily for him his deplorable don't understand.
19 | Joshua Biebesheimer | 1542345459118812_1542402945779730 | He's working to keep America Safe, trying to keep Donald trump as far away from the White House as he can.
20 | Toñi M Domínguez | 1542345459118812_1456823627673987 | I agree. He is spending our money, which could be used to take care of homeless, veterans, and so many others on need. Instead, Obama is spoiling it on that despicable woman.
21 | Skyler Rau | 1542345459118812_1542398209113537 | That's a shame that there is more democrats campaigning for a women who deserves 2 be president   and will be better suited for the American people vs trump who has caused more problems in the usa with the disrespect towards all women,all color,all gays,all jn general....we should be equal all together....vote blue hillaryKaine 2016
22 | Ron Schramm | 1542345459118812_1542403319113026 | I hope he does nothing but play golf and campaign for Hillary. I am quite ok with him spending MY tax dollars that way. He's had to deal with the worst, do nothing, obstructionist waste of money GOP Congress in our nation's history.  So I couldn't care less what he does.

The three attacks used "smart" household appliances like DVRs, routers and printers that are linked to the web to create "botnets" that overloaded websites by sending them more than 150,000 requests for information per second.

1 | Rachel Rader | 1542370135783011_1542375785782446 | anyone heard of the 3 card monty scam? that is what this was. we were so busy looking at the sites that were down we didnt see what site they really hit. What did these guys really take? Oh and yes it could be the russians. They pay hackers (not in Russia)  to overload other systems To keep eyes off what their hackers were really hitting.
2 | Bonnie Upton | 1542370135783011_1542376819115676 | It's all being censored by the government and media. Wikileaks email has been shut down, the embassy was surrounded by swat, and there's a massive cyber attack blocking free communication up the east coast. The democrats, Clinton and Obama are corrupt as hell along with the FBI, the dnc, and the attorney general. Trump isn't the nicest guy and best candidate but the dems are straight up criminals
3 | Ben Shackelford | 1542370135783011_1542376049115753 | The Internet of Things plays its part. Manufacturers need to get their heads out of their butts and put security in their devices. That having been said, the US has never been known for having the best cybersecurity. Btw, if it was DNS and not any website in particular, why can't we use other services or have multiple backup redundant servers to handle requests if one server or service gets disabled or overwhelmed?
4 | Pedro Still Sanders | 1542370135783011_1542381232448568 | Don't forget to mention some people are discovering that the traffic was coming from Seattle (Redmond area).near the Microsoft headquarters. An excuse to place the elections under DHS to install HRC via election fraud, which will be harder to challenge under them.

7 | Gary Eckman | 1542370135783011_1542384062448285 | Trump and Putin together shut it down. That is who. Its a test for election day. Trump will be the molester in chief if putin gets his orange muppet in. Lots of people have been saying. Luckily Putin is a communist dictator and so is Trump. SAD.

Russia or anyone else didn't need to hack anything, Hillary left them laying there unsecured for any simple network specialist to grab with no effort! When are people going to learn? It's all smoke n mirrors!

14 | Dana Larson | 1542370135783011_1542414689111889 | Obama already has us at war with the Russians. I guess they believe they need more propaganda for American citizens to be Ok with getting nuked.
15 | Stephanie David Kelly | 1542370135783011_1542547695765255 | It was either a distraction, so they could get something else, a trial run...or our government!! You know, in case Trump is winning in November! I love my country, but our government is shady as hell !!!!
16 | Richard Rogers | 1542370135783011_1542374162449275 | I advise Mr. Obama to get back to work. His job's not done yet. I'm tired of him wasting taxpayer money! They are doing the best they can to rig this election. That's not whining, that's common sense. It's still not working! Hillary Clinton has had her silence purchased by the Middle East. These countries have even purchased a 550% increase in the number of refugees that will be brought to America from her. Countries that marry 10 year old little girls off to men 4 times their age to be one of 4 or 5 wife's, these countries allow their women to be raped nightly by their husbands with no recourse, they throw gays off buildings, they burn witches, they drown people of different faiths, we are talking about countries that are still in the 13th century as far as human/civil rights are concerned. In addition to these atrocities, Hillary Clinton has also been the most controversial political figure of all time. She has sold the government. She has no product, she has no service, she sells the government. It has also been proven through released emails that she and her party are biased against Christians, Jews, Mexicans, African Americans, Patriots, or anyone that doesn't agree with her. She has been caught up in as many sexual scandals as anybody else I know. She helped to destroy those women's lives when they accused Bill of his transgressions. In short, get out of the political influence business. You too Family Guy or at least deal in an even-handed fashion. #familyguy #trump2016 #nobama
17 | Shelia D. Hughey | 1542370135783011_1542399962446695 | If y'all are looking for a perfect leader, His name is Jesus, He is the King of Kings, and He will be here very soon...Until then, America needs President Trump today!!! We the People are going to come out in droves and elect Donald J.Trump by a landslide; there will be no contesting our votes, we will not let them steal our future. You unclean Clinton birds and your evil globalist cohorts won't be feathering your nests at our expense any more!...America is speaking loud and clear...CAN YOU HEAR US NOW???As a follower of Jesus, I believe Donald J. Trump is an answer to prayer for this once great nation and he just might be a temporary reprieve from God’s judgment that we so rightly deserve and which looms so ominously on the horizon. Just like with Belshazzar, the handwriting is on the wall, America has been weighed in the balance and found wanting...the enemy is at the gate but the Word of God says that if we humble ourselves through fasting and prayer, He will hear us and He will heal our land...I believe Mr. Trump is His answer to heal our land...He is clearly fighting back against the forces that be that are doing everything in their power to bring about chaos in our nation that will lead to the New World Order global government antichrist Beast System of Revelation.  He will fight for us, I believe that...he knows most of these devils personally and knows more than we do about them. He knows the republicans and demoncrats are just two heads on the same old serpent and anyone that they put forth is just a puppet on the strings of satan himself. He knows we are one election away from not even being a sovereign nation any more. Further, I think, he, and every other thinking man, knows that we are living in the last days and Bible prophecy is being fulfilled right before our eyes. I am sure he feels the weight of that responsibility.True Americans don't care about the republican or demoncratic party...the establishment is the problem and America is voting against IT... I don’t care what label the establishment puts on him, I just know he is an angry American just like the rest of us, and rightly so. WE HAVE HAD ENOUGH!!! I just know we truly are on the verge of losing everything our forefathers shed their blood for and if there is one chance to save it, I think Mr. Trump is that chance. This not a contest between the left and the right, this is a fight to the death between good and evil...we live in a time where the goats are being separated from the sheep...it's so easy to see who the goats are to those who can perceive...if a person is not sealed with the Holy Spirit, you can assume they have the antichrist spirit, it's so rampant and becoming more so every day.People don't like his tone, he's not politically correct, he doesn't tip toe around the issues because he might step on sensitive toes...Well I like what Pastor Robert Jeffress said, I don't care about his tone, I don't care that he uses profanity, a lot of good men do...I just want a mean son of a gun that's not afraid to stand up to the evil onslaught that threatens our nation, our sovereignty and our future....I like that he's never been a member of some elite secret society, I like that he's never been to Bohemian Grove...I like that he's never been a member of the CFR or Trilateral Commission, he's never been to a Bilderberger meeting...he's not an initiate into the good ole boys club, and that's why they hate him and that's why We the People support him...Those of us paying attention, see the physical, mental, spiritual and economic rape of Europe that's going on, by design, and no one is doing anything except opening the flood gates further to implode Europe, and these savages will do the same thing to America if given the chance, they have no intentions of assimilating into the culture, they have one goal and that is to set up a worldwide caliphate and kill the infidel, which is us ...shut the door and build a wall, a very high wall. If they come here, they must be thoroughly and properly vetted or they must stay out.I have had many people ask me how I, as a Christian woman, could support Mr. Trump; you've called him evil and arrogant and a liar, an adulterer, you’ve said that he has flip flopped on abortion and other issues. I believe the Doctrine of GRACE. For everyone who questions whether or not Donald Trump is a Christian because he says he has never asked for forgiveness, I say to you, consider the thief on the Cross...he never repented, he never asked for forgiveness, he simply said, Lord, remember me when you come into your Kingdom...all he did was believe that Jesus was Lord... Some of you even say he is the antichrist (as a side note: the current liar in chief fits this bill far more succinctly...if he rides off into the sunset and golfs happily ever after, he was just another globalist puppet, but, if he steps onto the world stage, especially as Secretary General of the UN, well I will be watching him intently and you should as well)... The Word says Salvation comes when we believe and receive Him as Lord...the rest comes in the sanctification process...I see Mr. Trump as a baby Christian that needs our prayer and support...the man stood on the world stage and said to the entire world, I am a proud Christian, in a world that hates Christians, after the pope said he wasn't a Christian...that speaks volumes to me. He has a lot to learn about being a good Christian, but as president of the United States, I guarantee you, the Lord will drive him to his knees when it is time. In the Word, time after time, the Lord has used imperfect men to achieve His end...you see, Moses, Paul and David were all murderers...Paul murdered hundreds if not thousands of Christians, yet the Lord used them in mighty ways...or, consider Cyrus, he was a pagan Persian King who God used to release the Israelites out of Babylonian captivity and even helped them to rebuild Jerusalem and the temple. ...right now, our country needs a Chief Executive Officer and a born leader, not a Pastor...we have enough of those and most are evil wolves in sheep's clothing... to these naysayers, these Pharisees, I say, put your stones back in your pocket, not one of us is perfect, we all have need for improvement in every area of our lives... I do believe that he is a Christian, as imperfect as he is, and I pray for him that he recognize that we are all sinners in need of a savior, we all fall short of the Glory of God and we must all get on our knees before Him in repentance and ask forgiveness and direction for our life...I pray every day that Donald Trump see and understand this and I believe that he will.  He is a good man and a great leader and will change our country for the better and give us a nation to hand down to our children and grandchildren. He is giving us a voice that we thought was long dead...he is not a perfect Christian, but, in an evil world where true Christians are being marginalized and persecuted and shut up more and more every day, I believe he will fight to make sure we are all free to worship as we choose, without persecution...that's why I choose him.Even so, come quickly, Lord Jesus...I had a wide awake, open vision of the Lord's return in 1976 when I was 13 years old. This July was 40 years since that date... Thank you for taking time to view and share...the hour is late, the harvest is great, but the laborers are few...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt--TNZzsxc&list=LLtysruP3VK3vCcmWldmrz6g&index=5...feel free to copy and paste....
18 | Jeanne Brooks-Miller | 1542370135783011_1542588859094472 | The Pope's Message To Catholics :However, last night made it abundantly clear that Donald Trump is a pro-life candidate and Hillary Clinton is not. And I’ll leave you with Fr. Michael Orsi:"We are in a battle for the soul of America…Somehow, [Christians] have come to buy the story that you cannot be political in church. Let me tell you right now, oh yes, you can, and oh, yes, you better be. Because you might not have a church to go to if you don’t vote the right way in November.”
19 | M Brendan Diven | 1542370135783011_1542376782449013 | MAJOR INTERNET OUTAGES IN AMERICA...NOT ANYWHERE ELSE! DO NOT ACCEPT THE MSM at NBC News blaming hackers. THIS WAS A US BASED, HIGH LEVEL (possible government) ATTACK.Now the gov't (not hackers) is causing a massive disruption on major internet sites like Twitter. They're going to blame it on hackers. Thing is, if it was hackers, Facebook would be the A-#1 target...however, FB is the disinformation buddy of Obama & Clinton.I've also been testing a few of my European based websites, very minor, and still can't get into them. This is a GOVERNMENT, not hacker, controlled internet black out.Get ready, this is only the beginning.I'm just saying, Wikileaks really gave a lot of vindication to what you call "tin foil hat" conspiracy theorists.I can say with 100% certainty that this was NOT an Anonymous or /4chan DDoS attack. There was not chatter on the normal DDoS channels. Also, none of the Anon sub-groups are bragging about the take down which happens almost immediately.I'm about 99.5% sure this is government black out or attack. OK, I jumped the gun saying our government did it...but these black outs were caused at the internet connection level and not the server level. I just find it curious Facebook has been spared when any past social media attacks by hackers always go after FB first.Just saying some other foul play is going on.

Michael Slager's attorneys argued his statement to state agents should be thrown out because the agents said they hadn't seen video of the shooting.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Lealand Bruce | 1542343192452372_1542352292451462 | What Slager did was murder. No reason to shoot unarmed man running away. Walter Scott wasn't threat, he was running away. Slager should have called backup, call tow truck to impound Scott's car, & staked out his house. The cops knew where Scott lived. Slager & his fellow officers should have staked out Scott's house, & when Scott got home, arrest him. No reason in shooting Scott dead.
2 | Zach Jensen | 1542343192452372_1542430312443660 | It's interesting that all officers must first go through their state's academy, which requires all cadets to be physically fit and to be able to run fast, as if in foot pursuit. Apparently, some officers have left the academy in the mindset of "Screw running, when I can just shoot'em instead." Hopefully, this case will set a precedent, and more officers will be required to chase unarmed suspects, instead of shooting them.
3 | Doug Lambert | 1542343192452372_1542363469117011 | Tim---that's the scary part. It suggests that his fellow officers see nothing wrong with his conduct, and might well do the same thing. Not to mention falsify evidence to "protect" each other.

It is republican and conservative racists policies and rhetoric that has led to targeting of minorities, and racists incarceration rates from a republican drug war.... and f - ing shooting blacks down in the street and getting away with it... Republicans should get the blow back, not the cops. They are the murderers. They are racists. Stop the republican war on minority Americans....

After her talk she offers question time.One little boy puts up his hand. Hillary asks him what his name is. "Kenneth," he says. "And what is your question, Kenneth?" she asks. "I have three questions," he says."First -- whatever happened in Benghazi?"Second -- why would you run for president if you are not capable of handling two e-mail accounts?"And, third -- whatever happened to the missing six billion dollars while you were Secretary of State?" Just then the bell rings for recess. Hillary informs the kiddies that they will continue after recess. When they resume Hillary says, "Okay, where were we? Oh, that's right, question time.Who has a question?" A different boy -- little Johnny -- puts his hand up. Hillary points to him and asks him what his name is."Johnny," he says."And what is your question, Johnny?" she asks. "I have five questions," he says. "First -- whatever happened in Benghazi ?"Second -- why would you run for president if you are not capable of handling two e-mail accounts?"Third -- whatever happened to the missing six billion dollars while you were Secretary of State?"Fourth -- why did the recess bell go off 20 minutes early?"And, fifth -- where's Kenneth?"

You decide if there’s a rather curious similarity:Here’s the original research outline we presented April 10th, 11th and 12th 2015Walter Scott deblurredupdate-1Updated 4/12/15 2:15pm with additional videoOn the first day we saw the North Charleston, South Carolina, shooting video of Walter Scott by Officer Michael Slager we were as shocked as everyone. However, as our research now indicates, there is much more to the story.What we cover here in the latest update might just change the entire way the story continues…Day #1 April 7th – The shock of the videoDay #2 April 8th – The community reaction/responseDay #3 April 9th – The video witness comes forth – The Dash Cam Video releasedDay #4 April 10th – Facts Being Assembled – Ryan Julison Discovered – The Passenger researched and Responding Officers statements reviewedDay #5 April 11th – Research reveals media manipulating narrative – Uncomfortable evidence kept from public.Today, April 12th – We share alarming discoveries within the non-discussed details.Treeper Diwataman , who previously discovered the “Three Stooges” interaction with Trayvon Martin (which became a game changer leading to the discovery of why Trayvon was at the 7-11) has done another incredible job creating a video to aid a larger understanding.With discovery of the full radio dispatch recording of North Charleston Police, and with the Dash Cam video(s) from two vehicles, Diwataman was able to assemble a video syncing all of the data into one format easily understood.The sync’d video IS BRILLIANT and shows the length of time in the chase, confrontation, physical struggle between Officer Slager and Walter Scott, and the first aid administered by the responding officers.Additionally, by adding a running clock from the moment Scott begins to run from the vehicle scene you can see the length of the struggle:Walter Scott map 2You can clearly see and hear this was not a short fight prior to Officer Slager using his firearm to shoot Walter Scott. But that fact alone is not the most important discovery in the past 24 hours.What is potentially a game changer occurs when you review Officer Slager stating he had lost control/custody of the x26 Taser he deployed to restrain a non compliant Scott – and recognize the Taser actually appears to have been used against him.At least one dart appears lodged in the upper torso, chest, shirt of Officer Slager.walter scott tazer leadsIf you review the raw footage (source New York Times) of the witness shooting video you can clearly see the wire from the Taser connected to Officer Slager.Additionally, if you follow the wire you also recognize the cartridge from the Taser itself is being dragged behind the fleeing Walter Scott.This is critical because the darts are on one end of the wire, and the cartridge is on the other end – usually cartridge remaining in the trigger assembly. However, the cartridge is obviously dislodged in the struggle.If the cartridge is dragging behind Scott -somehow tangled with his foot/shoe or leg – and the line is visibly taut (which it is) then the dart end is indeed attached to Officer Slager.*NOTE* The civilian version of the x26 (x26C) only has 10-15′ of wire, but the LEO version is 25′ to 35′. From the imaging it appears the length is at least 25′.walter scott - taser x26 - slagerwalter scott - taser s26 specsThis means when the Taser fired during the struggle, the darts actually penetrated Slager, not Scott.Factually this aligns with the recorded statement of Slager and the reports of his initial debriefing.It could be that one dart is in the leg of Slager and the other is in the upper torso region as evidenced below.Walter Scott deblurredWalter Scott - taser leadThis would also explain the picture of Slager being debriefed after the confrontation with his left pant leg folded up as he explains events to the documenting officer.walter scott - slager - uniform debriefExpanding these visuals and going back to the original source video taken by eye-witness Feidin Santana, an emerging picture comes to the surface. Officer Slager did in fact lose custody of the Taser to Walter Scott.walter scott tazerThis puts Slager at a serious disadvantage and obvious risk.Eye-witness Santana describes hearing the sound of the Taser in his statement (as shared by his attorney Todd Rutherford):[…] After observing the two men struggle on the ground and hearing the sound of a Taser gun, I began filming the altercation with my cell phone”. (link)Walter Scott - feidin santana statementfeidin santanaIn the micro-seconds of decision-making, and having chased a fleeing suspect, and having physically struggled for almost two minutes, a scenario emerges where Slager -having lost the advantage of his Taser, and facing the risk of incapacitation from his own Taser being used against him – doesn’t realize (as they stand up – still fighting) the cartridge has dislodged from the trigger assembly.The Taser wire is clearly still attached to Officer Slager as he draws his firearm to regain control against the risk presented by Scott. The whereabouts of the actual trigger assembly unknown to Slager but in the video you can see it landing behind them.If you frame by frame the video you will note the wire is still attached to the torso of Slager, and tightening by the fleeing Scott, as Slager fires the first shot.walter scott tazer leadsBetween shots 1 and 2 the wire pulls free from the officer’s upper torso as Scotts’ forward momentum dislodges it.However, the wire is also still hung up on the foot/leg area of Scott as he runs away. You can see the Taser cartridge bouncing along behind him.View post on imgur.comAn argument can be made, and would be supported by factual evidence, that Officer Slager didn’t know Scott was not in possession of the trigger assembly. Slager now focused on using his firearm – this is all happening in microseconds.How dramatically this information changes the position or perspectives of the people who are holding opinion is most likely based on the ideology/bias of the observer.Does the paradigm shift all the way to justification? Not sure – that’s not our forte’.However, weighing all of this against a charge of murder, and considering it presented before a jury…. well, at least to us, at the very least, this presents ‘very reasonable’ doubt.south carolina 3Walter Scott - Feidin SantanaVideo eye-witness Feidin Santana with his attorney Todd Rutherford visit with the family of Walter Scott and their attorney Chris Stewart – Friday 4/10/15.[…] “The family’s legal team was gathering evidence for a civil federal lawsuit. “A civil lawsuit can’t bring him back to life,” Mr. Stewart said of Mr. Scott, “but it provides for the future, which would be his children” (link)The youngest child of Mr. Scott is 16 and the older three are in their 20’s. That’s a fact you will see largely ignored by the MSM. However, perhaps Mr. Scott in death will do for his children what he chose not to do in life.[…] “He (Feidin Santana) kept recording as the officer struck Mr. Scott and put a stun gun to Mr. Scott’s side, then as Mr. Scott slipped away”.. (link)“Slipped away”? “A Tussle”? What’s next, a pillow fight? And then there is this little nugget:[…] “He (Feidin Santana) checked Facebook to see if he knew anyone in common with the family, and found that they shared some friends. He asked one of those friends to make an unusual introduction. He showed the video to the Scott family on Sunday and turned it over to state investigators on Monday.

1 | Barbara Scribner | 1542299715790053_1542320299121328 | Whee that's scary. If a Republican said that he would be accused of citing violence. Just good natured fun if it's a leftist.
2 | Chris Kirkland | 1542299715790053_1542319092454782 | What an idiot. Thing I like is the fact that we get called all kinds of things by people who are just mad Trump is winning. Yet I refuse to call them names or make rude remarks to them. Wonder why they are worried that most republicans are staying out of the limelight till election day....
3 | Don Warnick | 1542299715790053_1542318049121553 | ...you got to Love these "Tough Guys" hiding behind a Computer key board or as Biden hiding behind a mic with Armed Security...LoL...cowards..LoL..LoL..
4 | Joseph Simon | 1542299715790053_1542327349120623 | The blood of the unborn ‘is on your hands’ if you back pro-abortion candidate.Don't vote for Hillary Clinton and the Democrats until they change their stance on abortion  (killing of babies).
5 | Marc Hutchinson | 1542299715790053_1542319215788103 | The louder you cry,whine, piss and moan about how inappropriate these locker room comments were the further you distance yourself from the people you are trying to convince.
6 | Ron Haupt | 1542299715790053_1542339425786082 | So I see that Biden is violence prone. So why don't the news media shove the mike in his face and question his violent tendencies? And the question Hilliary about her e-mails. But no they just keep questioning Trump about his statements and accuse him of being racist and sexist. So why isn't the media held accountable of their questions and ask the opposition on their accusations?
7 | Bea Martin | 1542299715790053_1542340435785981 | Biden is little wuz . Let's see how you roll behind a gym without your body guard . Tough talk. Put your money where you and Obamas big mouth is! Go trump!!
8 | Tim Mason | 1542299715790053_1542317772454914 | Biden saying Biden things. I'm gonna miss this administration.
9 | Robert Keyser | 1542299715790053_1542333795786645 | LOL... Oh come on Uncle Joe.... Besides you would not last 10 seconds behind the gym. Did you take an extra Viagra pill or  something this morning?
10 | Raymond Moore | 1542299715790053_1542320155788009 | What I hate is all these people talking about someone talking smack knowing they have skeletons in the closet as well. What have you said Biden that we don't know about? What has anyone for that matter.  We got to many issues other then some words a while back. GROW UP!
11 | Paula Kay Enghauser Wold | 1542299715790053_1542366632450028 | Yes. If a Republican said this, they would be criticized. Also, I watched news tonight. I had stopped watching it because they are slanted. However, it came on when a neighbor stopped by. Interesting once again they show Trump telling a joke that was booed. Interesting that I did not see them show the joke Hillary said that also got booed. I also listened to Trump's speech in North Carolina today that was full of actual plans for his administration and was well planned and written. Of course somewhere today on another main stream network, the person criticized Trump for using a more scripted speech. So, first the press jumps on him for not acting Presidential when giving a speech, but when he is scripted like Hillary always is ......double standard again. It was a good speech. Saw nothing about that, and if they had, they would have taken it out of context or only something to make fun of. Again....no ethics with NBC.
12 | Marc L Ecclesiaste | 1542299715790053_1542349852451706 | Wow.. imagine if Donald Trump said that? He's inciting violence. But I'm sure all of the media people are going to just laugh it out.
13 | Carol Berman | 1542299715790053_1542370242449667 | I wouldn't mind taking Trump behind the shed and "insulting" him the way he's "insulted" all those women…..and, no, Trump is NOT winning and will lose big time in a few weeks, folks...
14 | Kerry Gille | 1542299715790053_1542358555784169 | Hahahahaha...little Joey Biden, you're hysterical! You couldn't take ME down, without all your body guards. And, I have fibro myalgia and move slow! And, you think you can take Donald Trump...all I can say is THANKS, I Really Needed that deep belly laugh I just got for the past 45 minutes!!!!! You're a joke!!!!!
15 | Michael Shippole | 1542299715790053_1542321312454560 | Senior citizens walking around shooting their big mouth off who when called out for their tough guy stance cry that others are picking on senior citizens. It's the kind of imbecile society we live in today, and this one is the VP in the Obama administration.
16 | Jim Baker | 1542299715790053_1542348242451867 | Lol Donald would turn that skinny little wife groping pervert into a pretzel.  I wouldn't even buy tickets, the show would be over before I could sit down.
17 | Steven Craig Kessler | 1542299715790053_1542338585786166 | The Clinton Foundation in 2011 employed more women than men but paid them less, on average, according to a salary schedule included in an email released Friday by WikiLeaks. NBC NEWS WILL NOT TELL YOU THE TRUTH ON THIS TONIGHT.
18 | Steven Craig Kessler | 1542299715790053_1542341292452562 | Hillary Clinton engaged in "pay for play" for accepting an invitation to speak at a Clinton Global Initiative event in Morocco in exchange for a $12 million donation pledge to the Clinton Foundation from that country's king.

19 | Mary Ellen Macioge | 1542299715790053_1081288225272619 | Listen to all the idiots laughing.... what a bunch of trained seals ... I'm embarrassed for them... he groped so many women and told the world who got Bin Laden... told them it was Seal Team 6... weeks later helicopter carrying them was shot down... so laugh it up morons!!!!!
20 | Misty Dow-Gilbert | 1542299715790053_1081245975276844 | You take him behind the gym and do what exactly. Joe your just grateful no one has caught you on tape...I mean good grief...you practically molest women on live television you sicko.
21 | George Vincent | 1542299715790053_1542346892452002 | OMG;!! I can't believe the Vice President just said he wanted to take Donald Trump behind a school gym and beat him to a bloody pulp! I am so triggered by the VP's talk of violence right now.
22 | Rick Ranalli Jr | 1542299715790053_1780670862195874 | Hahaha, this is the hardest Biden ever worked in 8 years...I pretty sure he wasn't talking about beating up Trump, lol what a joke
23 | Jeff Helgesen | 1542299715790053_1780707998858827 | A stupid, stupid man, please stop talking. Don't worry Trump, it's almost over. Nov, 9th, you can check off running for Prezident of your bucket list. Sorry you can't check off being President, of your list.

5 | Douglas Flynt | 1542209335799091_1542420239111334 | All of these perceived "inequalities" are drummed up by liberals to create division among the people. It's the old divide and conquer strategy. Saul Alinsky advocated inciting divisiveness among the masses in order to factionalize people into smaller groups that can be politically isolated. Liberalism is what is behind our divided country.
6 | Richard Rogers | 1542209335799091_1542312642455427 | I advise Mr. Obama to get back to work. His job's not done yet. I'm tired of him wasting taxpayer money! They are doing the best they can to rig this election. That's not whining, that's common sense. It's still not working! Hillary Clinton has had her silence purchased by the Middle East. These countries have even purchased a 550% increase in the number of refugees that will be brought to America from her. Countries that marry 10 year old little girls off to men 4 times their age to be one of 4 or 5 wife's, these countries allow their women to be raped nightly by their husbands with no recourse, they throw gays off buildings, they burn witches, they drown people of different faiths, we are talking about countries that are still in the 13th century as far as human/civil rights are concerned. In addition to these atrocities, Hillary Clinton has also been the most controversial political figure of all time. She has sold the government. She has no product, she has no service, she sells the government. It has also been proven through released emails that she and her party are biased against Christians, Jews, Mexicans, African Americans, Patriots, or anyone that doesn't agree with her. She has been caught up in as many sexual scandals as anybody else I know. She helped to destroy those women's lives when they accused Bill of his transgressions. In short, get out of the political influence business. You too Family Guy or at least deal in an even-handed fashion. #familyguy #trump2016 #nobama
7 | Thomas Donaldson | 1542209335799091_1542303365789688 | The one thing I do admire about Hillary Clinton is the way she could pick up an ashtray in a cocaine-fueled rage and throw it 50 feet  with uncanny pinpoint accuracy..Smacking her rapist husband directly in the forehead..

1 | Jim Connole | 1542266719126686_1542269979126360 | If people are dealing with their own family/friends who have mental illness maybe it's better to leave the police with guns out of a family issue.Cops are strangers to them and will use force if they feel threatened. Some are quick to get the police involved in family matters with loved ones rather than work it out themselves.Just like suicide issues with family/friends. You know them, you can try to talk them out of it. Doesn't take a Government man/woman with a gun and a badge to do it.

What happend????The Media has become a Joke, by putting out these Slanderous Headlines without producing and True Facts or Evidence, Humm just like the Election Process going on.....The Media needs to be shut down for Printing False Accusations.....
4 | Bill Hunt | 1542266719126686_1542299769123381 | It's in the news almost daily. A family is trying to deal with a mentally ill family member or friend that is out of control. They are worried about that person hurting themselves or someone else to the extent that the police are called in to help. But the police can't control them either and the relative/friend is killed. I would like to propose that a branch of every city's police force be dedicated to dealing with the mentally ill. It would save many lives and injuries to both the ill person and police. Why hasn't anyone thought of this before?
5 | Pedro Routh | 1542266719126686_1542316339121724 | "...she was naked and armed with scissors. He persuaded her to put down the scissors but as he was coaxing her out of the room, she picked up the baseball bat and charged him. Barry fired two shots, killing her."So, this person charged a cop with scissors and a baseball bat. And she was shot.Not sure why this is controversial. It's incredibly sad and tragic that she died, but she charged a cop with scissors and a bat. Maybe he should've tasered her. Did he have one? The story doesn't say.Based on the story, it seems like he was faced with being stabbed or bludgeoned and he defended himself.
6 | Vivian Woodruff Thanos | 1542266719126686_1542315082455183 | It's pretty sad that families with a mentally ill family member cannot call the cops.  It happens all the time.   Did this always happen?  I don't remember it years ago.  I know someone who was mentally ill and his mother had to call the fire department every once in awhile to rescue her.  But they never did him any harm.   They just took him away for a while, put him in a halfway house, to get him back on his meds.
7 | Vincent Moody | 1542266719126686_1542291669124191 | All the people protesting should of been the ones that helped her people didn't care for her until she was dead and I bet if I threatened  any of y'all with any kind of weapon and y'all had a gun would you try talking or would you shoot me we all know the answer

13 | Brian Caswell | 1542266719126686_1542361629117195 | Again no investigation for a cop killing. No wonder regular citizens distrust and even hate the 1 % of cops that use GUNS INSTEAD OF BRAINS.

They are doing the best they can to rig this election. That's not whining, that's common sense. It's still not working! Hillary Clinton has had her silence purchased by the Middle East. These countries have even purchased a 550% increase in the number of refugees that will be brought to America from her. Countries that marry 10 year old little girls off to men 4 times their age to be one of 4 or 5 wife's, these countries allow their women to be raped nightly by their husbands with no recourse, they throw gays off buildings, they burn witches, they drown people of different faiths, we are talking about countries that are still in the 13th century as far as human/civil rights are concerned. In addition to these atrocities, Hillary Clinton has also been the most controversial political figure of all time. She has sold the government. She has no product, she has no service, she sells the government. It has also been proven through released emails that she and her party are biased against Christians, Jews, Mexicans, African Americans, Patriots, or anyone that doesn't agree with her. She has been caught up in as many sexual scandals as anybody else I know. She helped to destroy those women's lives when they accused Bill of his transgressions. In short, get out of the political influence business. You too Family Guy or at least deal in an even-handed fashion. #familyguy #trump2016 #nobama

4 | Richard Rogers | 1542239182462773_1542242509129107 | Reuters interviews 1201 respondents.626 Democrats (52% of total)423 Republicans (35% of total)122 independents30 other party.That’s nearly 33 percent more Democrats than Republicans.In reality Gallup reported in March that 46 percent of Americans are Democrats, and 40 percent are Republicans. Reuters freighted their poll with 20 percent more Democrats than Republicans.Since the Reuters poll sampled more Democrats than all the others combined, we can safely say that Trump appears to be in much better shape than the poll suggests and could likely be headed to a landslide victory in November.

6 | Thomas Donaldson | 1542239182462773_1542337342452957 | The one thing I do admire about Hillary Clinton is the way she could pick up an ashtray in a cocaine-fueled rage and throw it 50 feet  with uncanny pinpoint accuracy..Smacking her rapist husband directly in the forehead.. Secret Service documents tell how she would trash the White House and throw objects at the walls. Hillary Clintons out of control Tantrums we're legendary.. Secret Service would hide from Hillary when she went berserk...   The Clintons never actually stole the furniture from the white house or the State Department.. Hillary smashed it into kindling...The furniture was removed to be repaired or replaced and it was returned .. glued back together...     It would be fun to let an expert examine the furniture...An antique specialist could tell us which antiques are cheap copies...     Of course ...Nowadays all Jittery Hillary has the energy for is a long nap and a diaper change..   I wouldn't trust her around an ashtray..

He didn't repeat the oath properly to defend our nation and our Constitution. Later the Democrats claimed he was given the oath again….in private?CIA director John Brennan took his oath on a copy of the Constitution,~~not a Bible.Congressman, Keith Ellison took his oath on a copy ~~of the Qur'an.Congresswoman Michele Bachman was vilified and almost tarred and feathered by Democrats when she voiced her concern about Muslims taking over our government. Considering all these appointments, it would explain why Obama and his minions are systematically destroying our nation, supporting radical Muslim groups worldwide, opening our southern border, and turning a blind eye to the genocide being perpetrated on Christians all over Africa and the Middle East. The more damage Obama does, the more arrogant he's become! Our nation and our government has been infiltrated by people who want to destroy us.

14 | Sherry Barbour Bell | 1542239182462773_1542241559129202 | Lawsuit Has Just Been Filed Against Hillary and The DNCPOLITICSOctober 21, 2016A+A-EMAILPRINTWe knew it all along.It would only be a matter of time until the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign would be in the hot seat.James O’Keefe with Project Veritas have filed an official complaint with the Federal Election Commission. Yes, it’s getting real.This development comes after O’Keefe released two videos “which expose apparently illicit actions by a group of political actors associated with the Clinton campaign, the DNC, and the White House.”And by “illegal”, O’Keefe is referring to the DNC hiring Clinton supporters to protest Trump rallies and create “anarchy”.According to Breitbart:The establishment media was forced to cover O’Keefe’s videos after one subject, Robert Creamer, announced he would quit working for the DNC. This break came a day after the first video release prompted another subject, Scott Foval, to leave his job with another Democratic political group, Americans United for Change……Scott Foval of AUFC on 09/15/16 “So, I’ll give an example. In Iowa. Progress Iowa has a built-in group of people that they can message, who will show up. But what they will not do, is do that unless someone is paying them on the proiect. Because there’s staff time involved, there’s transportation involved, there’s food, lodging, training, whatever, involved….….SCOTT FOVAL : We have to be really careful. Um, because, what we don’t need is for it to show up on CNN that the DNC paid for ‘X’ people to … that’s not gonna happen. We need to keep it, you know, I hate to use the Beyonce term, “partition,” but we need to keep the partition.O’Keefe also highlights the DNC hiring people to aggressively bird dog Trump rallies. ” ‘Bird dog’ is a term used by the group to describe face-to-face pressure on GOP supporters. Foval emphasizes that the goal of ‘bird-dogging’ is to create a sense of ‘anarchy’ around Trump.”The establishment media curates and censors stories, creating multiple illusions for millions of Americans believe.The DNC pays thousands to create false narratives.Who and what can we trust?Certainly not the shiny veneer of the Democratic party.

And then she laughed about it. And we're supposed to care that Christie swore and threw a water bottle at her? Why am I smiling?

They are doing the best they can to rig this election. That's not whining, that's common sense. It's still not working! Hillary Clinton has had her silence purchased by the Middle East. These countries have even purchased a 550% increase in the number of refugees that will be brought to America from her. Countries that marry 10 year old little girls off to men 4 times their age to be one of 4 or 5 wife's, these countries allow their women to be raped nightly by their husbands with no recourse, they throw gays off buildings, they burn witches, they drown people of different faiths, we are talking about countries that are still in the 13th century as far as human/civil rights are concerned. In addition to these atrocities, Hillary Clinton has also been the most controversial political figure of all time. She has sold the government. She has no product, she has no service, she sells the government. It has also been proven through released emails that she and her party are biased against Christians, Jews, Mexicans, African Americans, Patriots, or anyone that doesn't agree with her. She has been caught up in as many sexual scandals as anybody else I know. She helped to destroy those women's lives when they accused Bill of his transgressions. In short, get out of the political influence business. You too Family Guy or at least deal in an even-handed fashion. #familyguy #trump2016 #nobama
11 | Bob Adams | 1542207752465916_1542250365794988 | Looks like the boxes of records from the Rose Law Firm that were found in the White House two years later. We were told by the trust worthy media that that was all right because the Clinton's have a D behind their names. Hypocrisy: the practice of claiming to have moral standards or beliefs to which one's own behavior does not conform; pretense.

They must have been really, REALLY bad.
14 | Darrell Seybold | 1542207752465916_1542263579127000 | Bernie supporters did the same thing all over America, but they're OK right??
15 | Kazper Nguyen | 1542207752465916_1542310799122278 | Whether Christie aiding abetting or accomplice to after the Fact, Christie surely hell knew about it. Its seem like everyone on his Teams knew about it but except himself, come on do you believe closed the George Washington Bridge was a study, ex-aide of christie admitted to retaliate for not endorse Christie re-election. By the Way where deleted Emails not where but who's deleted the Emails and Why deleted Email. Can you recover the Emails since the USA Freedom Act allowing 180 days. or 18 months to a years.
16 | Tom Mauro | 1542207752465916_1542322115787813 | Trump is in a death spiral and it's so intriguing to watch

18 | Joseph Colton | 1542207752465916_1542247859128572 | When Obama leaves office this country will be 21 trillion in debt, if Hil-liar-y wins and when she would leave office this country will be over 31 trillion in debt, which means our grand-kids and great grand-kids will inherit a bankrupt country! I hope everyone realizes what this will mean!!!! The only ones that will not be affected by this will be Hil-liar-y and her wall-street friends!

In an emotional video released by the Clinton campaign, Khan flips through pictures of his son, recalling his service in Iraq.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Leo Decaj | 1542175209135837_1542175395802485 | Yes..he is a hero. NOT YOU! Your lobbying special interest shady immigration deals from the middle east you have been doing for years. Pay to play.Your son will always have a place in America. You're a POS who keeps using your son's death as a political statement. You're a disgrace to Gold Star families.
2 | Kaleb Sveiks | 1542175209135837_1542178359135522 | Khan, ties to the Clinton foundation, and his Law firm who grew attention for selling green cards, and who owes 850,000 in taxes who had his tax lean put on hold right after he started speaking for Hillary at events. He is also a supporter of sharia law.
3 | Chuck Steinell | 1542175209135837_1542180655801959 | Your son is a hero.   You are pathetic.  You have traded your venerable position as a Gold Star parent for the bootlicking position of Clinton's attack dog.  Too bad, because most of America would support you but for your rhetoric and biased support on Clinton's stage.
4 | Julie Mathers | 1542175209135837_1542176909135667 | Khan who has strong ties to the Clinton foundation writes Sharia law for the Saudi royal family.. He also removed his law firm website after gaining attention for selling green cards.
5 | Wendi Sargent | 1542175209135837_1542187632467928 | So hillary brings out the gold star family once again. Guess wikileaks is coming out with something pretty good! It would be nice if she would answer ANYTHING with the truth. It would be a nice change
6 | Ron Wallenburg | 1542175209135837_1542191845800840 | Nothing But Crap. NBC is still playing this dead card? He was paid $25,000 to read a speech prepared by the DNC and given the "prop" (Pocket Constitution) that was purchased a couple hours before hand, most likely while writing the speech.
7 | Robert Tyler | 1542175209135837_1542179302468761 | I've heard more about this Khan idiot than I have about the other candidates running for President....he's a Clinton plant...anything to take the microscope off of her shady a&& campaign
8 | Ian Ka | 1542175209135837_1542190802467611 | Why don't NBC News run their own Hillary vs Trump poll here on Facebook. It takes a few seconds to set up. We could see real people's opinions based on a much larger sample set.
9 | Jesse Brown | 1542175209135837_1542184469134911 | So...where are the people bashing Clinton for exploiting a deceased war hero? People bashed Trump for exploiting a deceased war hero when a lady blamed Clinton for her son's death, so where's the equality?
10 | Cristina Portugal | 1542175209135837_1542322082454483 | Whatever! What's the point?!? They should stop with the emotional traps to get votes! Ridiculous!And this man should be ashamed of himself for using the memory of his son to help elect his candidate!
11 | Scott Descoteaux | 1542175209135837_1542300015790023 | These people are pathetic, they are soiling the memory of their son by using his heroism to support the most corrupt human being to ever run for The presidency of United States.
12 | Deborah Burkhart | 1542175209135837_1542444729108885 | Well what about the gold star mothers whose sons were sacrificed in Benghazi by Hillary . What would this father have to say if his son were one of those? She didn't parade them in front of the world as paid supporters..she hasn't even apologized to them for lying about it. She says "at this point, what difference does it make?" Where's your outrage now?
13 | Tina Hayes | 1542175209135837_1542220195798005 | I guess she couldn't use Pat Smith and the rest of the Benghazi Gold Star families seeing how she as Secretary of State lied to them and then called them liars. Hillary and her camp along with the media are Gaslighting the American people.
14 | Kathryn Johnson | 1542175209135837_1542193339134024 | Yes but not you. You work against everything your son believed. And your wife lady there are pictures out there with you dressed like the average American. Your way of life full of hate and corruption led your son to be a hero for freedom for all.
15 | Eddy Delgado | 1542175209135837_1542278625792162 | Oh spare me the melodrama. Why doesn't Hillary have the parents of the guys that got killed at the embassy she failed to protect showing their photos? And why doesn't NBC ever mention any of them? You're all just stuck on this Muslim as if he were the only son lost in Iraq.
16 | Vinnie Bredice | 1542175209135837_1542381299115228 | In an emotional video published by the families of the Benghazi massacre we flash to an arrogant and flippant Hillary Clinton screaming "what difference does it make!?!?!?!?!"
17 | Jason Welcome | 1542175209135837_1542277565792268 | They have already proved that this guy is in the swamp with Killary! I'm so glad that the libtards keep bringing up the corruption they are into. I find it great that this post gave me one more reason to vote for Trump! What idiots! Anyone paying attention to TRUTH WILL NOT VOTE FOR KILLARY PERIOD! We need the swamp cleaned now!
18 | Paul Trabulsi Sr | 1542175209135837_1542446535775371 | holy orange crap... you professional trump-trolls are getting in some O.T., aintcha?  Let me guess... you have extra time while your white hoods and robes are at the dry cleaners. A small tip for you: save your cleaner cash for after the election, when you soil yourselves in a bowel-emptying tantrum.
19 | Alan Ma | 1542175209135837_1542269059126452 | With all due respect please stop politicizing your son's sacrifice for our country. Your family came in legally. If anything, his sacrifice wouldn't be for nothing had we not pulled out from Iraq in such a stupid and myopic manner.
20 | Dolly Marino | 1542175209135837_1542247915795233 | More than you will ever know,No matter who gets in office,(definitely not Trump),the Love in many hearts for your son and all service personal,is held in the highest respect, just because of some have hate living in there hearts ,don't mean majority has love,this is OUR AMERICA, RESPECT FOR ALL!!!
21 | Jack Pereira | 1542175209135837_1542411645778860 | NBC give it a rest your repeating the same garbage on Hillary's request , this election has made you lose all credibility as news reporters, Yes news reporters not journalists. Everyone I know from both parties have stopped watching your pathetic channel
22 | Matthew Kaye | 1542175209135837_1542226615797363 | Hillary has helped us to tenderly hold the Muslim Brotherhood next to our hearts , and to look to Political Islam for guidance and wisdom . Love Islam , and vote for Hillary Clinton . America needs the Muslim Brotherhood more now then ever . America will be Wahhabi by the time Hillary Clinton leaves the White House . Prepare .
23 | Joel Samson | 1542175209135837_1785096031762575 | We need to give Oscar award for this guy. You are making more people in America to hate Muslims. Trump is nothing to what you are saying, he is the voice millions, how are you going to change the millions of Americans view or worlds billions view? Once Buddha said conquer anger by unanger. Jesus said Love your enemies. Do not bring religion into political game.
24 | BobbyGambit LaFleur | 1542175209135837_1542208999132458 | My God. How much mileage are they going to get out of a military death before it gets disrespectful and considered political stunts?!? Can all our  families go live and show pictures of our fallen soldiers ?!?  There are thousands.
25 | Chelsea L. Pemberton | 1542175209135837_1542320629121295 | The reality is.... everyone is equal. Everyone has family and friends that they love. Everyone wants to be safe and warm.Those of you trying to take those things away from them are truely the ones who are evil.

1 | Lealand Bruce | 1542121362474555_1542144215805603 | Bill Murray doing what Bill Murray does lmao! Hope the Cubs finish off the Dodgers & win the World Series for 1st time in over century!
2 | Charlotte Barnett | 1542121362474555_1542156425804382 | I love Bill Murray!! Best use of the White House in the last 8 years!!!!!Go Cubbies!!!
3 | Bill Karim | 1542121362474555_1542142265805798 | "I will accept the results of the NLCS...if we WIN!"-LA Dodgers
4 | Dwayne Flaherty | 1542121362474555_1542172075802817 | I'd rather listen to Bill Murray talk about baseball predictions then to listen to any BS coming out of Washington with obama at the helm...
5 | Sheryl Jessica Wales | 1542121362474555_1542227389130619 | Some of these people need to relax and get away from the computer.... Thank you to All the people that gave everyone the freedom of speech we all enjoy.. No matter how ignorant or ridiculous!!!:)
6 | Richie Grossman | 1542121362474555_1276737665704775 | Bill, the feeling is totally mutual. I'm a Yankee fan. I love the city of Chicago. I think the matchup between the Cubs and Indians will be historic and memorable no matter who wins. I'm actually tired of the cruel and usual arrogant teams appearing in the limelight. These two teams have earned the spotlight. So I pray for those Cubbies to win against the Dodgers. It was fun watching Larry King go home early last night as the Cubs capitalized on that win.
7 | Gerald Dory | 1542121362474555_1542229202463771 | Bill Murray has had a great comedic life, most of us attest to that. Being at the White House briefings is another thing. I'm not speaking against him as a person, we all enjoy his humor. The White House briefings should only allow individuals associated with the briefings, i.e: reporters, staff,secret service. We've lost the sanctity and respect for POTUS. 👔💼🏛🛫🇺🇸
8 | Kristopher M Lisowski | 1542121362474555_1542232129130145 | I want to take a DVD copy of Ghostbusters and throw it at him for allowing that walking abomination of a Ghostbusters movie that came out this year to get made. If he hadn't dragged his feet for so many years there could have been a real Ghostbusters sequel with the original cast before Harold Ramos died!
9 | Bill Taylor | 1542121362474555_1542306675789357 | White house security is so weak that an unstable person like Bill Murray can come and go as he pleases. Obama has turned the White House into the East Coast Hollywood, after Bill Clinton turned it into the East Coast Playboy Mansion and house of ill repute of course.
10 | Jean Elizabeth Faber Hanvik | 1542121362474555_738803289606577 | LOVE this guy! I think there must be more than one of him, though. He seems to pop up everywhere! Bill Murray for President!
11 | Richard J. Biver | 1542121362474555_738850516268521 | It never ceases to amaze me that people always have something to complain about,especially with something as small as this with Bill Murray,so harmless and easy to understand,a fun thing.But no some of you have to throw there two cents in this and blow it out of proportion,unbelievable.
12 | Susie Adams | 1542121362474555_1276734712371737 | He's Bill Murray, he can do this and it's cool! Anyone else, and I mean anyone else...nope! He put better use to the White House than anyone
13 | Rider Dong | 1542121362474555_1542304535789571 | Distraction! Gotta keep Americans distracted from all of the nonsense their government does! #freejulianassange #wikileaks #podestaemails
14 | Ken Blanton | 1542121362474555_738839602936279 | Crappy reporting as usual ... had Murray tried to "crash" anything he should have been prevented by WH security. This is just making a misleading headline for the sake of it ... under the pretense that it's funny. Nothing about this election or American politics is funny any more.
15 | Meaux Hathaway | 1542121362474555_1276761109035764 | While I LOVE Bill Murray and appreciate his unique brand of humor...."ROME" is burning...God Bless his humor!! We all need a moment.
16 | Don Zimmerman | 1542121362474555_1542311825788842 | I like Bill Murray, but this wasn't funny at all. Doesn't help that he would do anything for the Great Divider Obuma. TRUMP 2016
17 | Diego Ortiz | 1542121362474555_1542232082463483 | Dodgers are gonna win. Kershaw will shut them out in game 6, but game 7 will be a close nail biter and the Dodgers will win for Vin. (Though he has a point about the trees lol)
18 | Pam Munson | 1542121362474555_1542315952455096 | If Americans were as concerned and informed about the election and what happens to our country as they are about sports and the outcome of them,  just maybe our country would be in a better place!
19 | Brent Hoyer | 1542121362474555_738791496274423 | This guy has been disturbed it seems his entire life. Supposedly a comic but not very funny almost pathetic. What does anyone see in this guy and why let him get away with antics like this?
20 | Dameon Holt | 1542121362474555_655733321274165 | Rumour has it that Trump has been given a role as a recently deceased ex presidential candidate who comes back to haunt the American voters who did not vote for him.
21 | Patricia Harvey | 1542121362474555_1276743399037535 | During his reign on SNL, Bill Murray did a baseball skit in which I think he played for the Cubs but I can't find it....It was like his dream job or something.  He's fabulous!

Just like he did to Venezuela and causing the collapse of their nation".
23 | George Wilson | 1542121362474555_1542272525792772 | It's unfortunate our (your) Justice Department is not doing their job resulting in WikiLeaks exposing information from the criminal (corrupt) and providing it to the victims (the people).Independent and undecided voters it's up to you. Accepting the same or vote for change. My vote is for change, exposing, and prosecuting the corrupt.
24 | Richard Rogers | 1542121362474555_1542141505805874 | I advise Mr. Obama to get back to work. His job's not done yet. I'm tired of him wasting taxpayer money! They are doing the best they can to rig this election. That's not whining, that's common sense. It's still not working! Hillary Clinton has had her silence purchased by the Middle East. These countries have even purchased a 550% increase in the number of refugees that will be brought to America from her. Countries that marry 10 year old little girls off to men 4 times their age to be one of 4 or 5 wife's, these countries allow their women to be raped nightly by their husbands with no recourse, they throw gays off buildings, they burn witches, they drown people of different faiths, we are talking about countries that are still in the 13th century as far as human/civil rights are concerned.

In short, get out of the political influence business. You too Family Guy or at least deal in an even-handed fashion. #familyguy #trump2016 #nobama
25 | Keith Johnson | 1542121362474555_1542242632462428 | That is nice. But how about doing some reporting now? I knew about Chinese, Russian, or North Korean state run media. But I had no clue there was such a thing in America. By the media outlets helping with the cover up of the widespread corruption and collusion to protect Hillary Clinton uncovered by WikiLeaks, ALL the media networks combined are behaving like another State run media. I hope America sees it and remembers it on November 8.

1 | Lola Tortola | 1542120709141287_1542124789140879 | November 9th , when the election is over, can not come soon enough. At this point, everyone has made up their minds who they are voting for, no one has anything new to bring to the table, and I pray the divisions amongst friends and family will be repaired, and quickly. Looking forward to a break from all of the vile rhetoric and bashing, from all sides.
2 | Jo-Ann St Andre Sabbagh | 1542120709141287_1542122002474491 | If I were only getting my "news" from NBC, I'd be ready to canonize Hillary and crucify Trump. The truth lies somewhere in the middle. The amount of bias that this network is spewing is like nothing I've ever seen in my lifetime. It's a shame that so many people don't take the time to look elsewhere to get their information besides the mainstream media which have become liberal sponsored propaganda networks. The media is suppose to report the news, not shape and create it according to their agenda. And yes, that includes Fox News as well. Allowing the media to pick and choose the way they present political information to the public is a step towards a very scary time for our nation. I urge everyone to use common sense, think for yourselves and don't buy into everything you hear and see in what's quickly becoming state sponsored propaganda stations. We don't need the media to tell us what to think, how to feel and who to vote for based THEIR agenda. That's insulting! Prove that we are intelligent and capable voters and we are capable of making up our own minds once we're given unbiased information based on fact, not agenda. Demand unbiased reporting from our media outlets no matter what your political affiliation. We deserve it.
3 | Jeanne Clevenger | 1542120709141287_1542121959141162 | This is absolutely horrible. Throw Trump in jail for life. What will he do next...delete 30,000 emails after being subpoenaed for them?
4 | Steve Bridges | 1542120709141287_1542132899140068 | If you hate NBC so much, why are you watching it and coming to their page. I know why. You're stupid. Your parents were stupid. Your grandparents were stupid. And if the state doesn't place your kids somewhere..they'll end up being stupid.
5 | Brandon Lowe | 1542120709141287_1542126919140666 | There wouldn't be a Wikileaks if Hillary Clinton would have followed The subpoena and turned over all the documents she was supposed to in the first place. However at this point what difference does it make.

Come on now Don't try to put down one when it was someone on his campaign verses her doing it herself!
7 | Kathleen Smith Velasco | 1542120709141287_1542130312473660 | Biased NBC,  just wow, you need to take a break from bashing Trump. Just take a deep breath and try to skip from bashing him a day or two. Your credibility to me is very questionable.
8 | Danielle J Glasco | 1542120709141287_1542139375806087 | I had to come look at NBC'S page just to see the bias nonsense they are trying to brainwash the American people with and it's exactly what I thought I would see BS. I'm voting TRUMP. 💪
9 | Chun Man Ng | 1542120709141287_1542144065805618 | So sad that every time Trump or his cronies/family do something illegal,immoral,stupid or just gross , his devotees would out pops the WhatAboutHillary speech!
10 | Monica Ayres Kooger | 1542120709141287_1542247169128641 | The only thing I can say for sure is that this country needs mandated Civics Classes. Everyone who believes in Trump is sure he's going to do miracles!!! Except for being the man with the codes and the face of America he gets ZERO done unless Congress writes the new laws and they pass both houses of Congress!! Then he signs the laws. This is a Democracy... not a kingdom or dictatorship!!
11 | Jose Ivan Montoya | 1542120709141287_1542126875807337 | The Hillary email leaker is not the Russians...Assange alluding to Democrat aide that was murdered at night in Washington, DC. The stakes for this election have never been clearer.Vote trumpSend killery to prison 2016
12 | Lucy Fuchs Brill Venz | 1542120709141287_1542218892464802 | Oh my. How could this possibly happen? Trump only hires the best people. I realize this is a super PAC, but you know he had a hand in this. His son appeared at one of their fundraisers, clearly a conflict of interest. Trump supporters, try to stick to this issue only. Don't conflate it with anything else.
13 | Lisa Sandona | 1542120709141287_1542253835794641 | Awesome - everyone who's exposed is looking at their credit card statements going - "hmmmm... white sheets, brown shirts, gasoline... 2x4s, Melania Trump porn PPV...Trump University tuition payment,,, hey - what's this? I didn't done buy nuthin' at a bookstore! I was robbed!  Hillary!  Benghazi! I wanna see emails! LOL.
14 | Jessica Warren | 1542120709141287_1542241042462587 | The amount of dumb in these comments is killing me. People actually think Trump knew of or was involved in this. People think this was at his hotels. People think this was HIS credit cards! None of them read the story. If they did, they don't know what a PAC is. Become informed before commenting please!
15 | Rick Ustler | 1542120709141287_1542127529140605 | Can't even handle their campaign with out screwing up. LOL Make America Great Again by Stealing your identity. I wonder how many other Trump supporters who donated will end up paying off his bankruptcies through their stolen credit card info. LOL loser. This is why Donald like them stupid and also why Donald has little hands. Little hands can get into your back pocket so much easier.
16 | Anthonie Arend van Zoeren | 1542120709141287_1542128545807170 | No worries. I'm sure a trustworthy, tell-it-like-it-is candidate like him will take full responsibility and fix all of this. After all, only he can, right?
17 | Mustapha Oulkadi | 1542120709141287_1542226549130703 | En Italiano se dice, "uno stronzo" como este, lo que dijo a Clinton, si seré presidente te mandare a la cárcel, digo a la Hillary, si es Usted presidente, por favor haga el posible, de mandarlo a la cárcel, donde merece estar, este gilipollas que se dueño del mundo. Ha sido un ladrón toda su vida y siempre evadió los impuestos. Al Capone lo cojieron por los impuestos, haber si este cabron termina sus días en la carcel
18 | Charles Gardner | 1542120709141287_1542120785807946 | Hillary has lied, stole, cheated....shouldn't be on stage❌❌❌Hillary is a lying untrustworthy crook...and already lost❌❌❌
19 | Amit Barua | 1542120709141287_1542136029139755 | Not the first time, his hotels have been warned about, he ignored it, it happened again and got fined. Trump is scamming people's credit cards and his loyal supporters won't say anything..
20 | Mike Flavin | 1542120709141287_1542131219140236 | So what? Who is going to try and spend someone's last 5.00 they keep in their account to keep it open? Maybe if Trump supporters weren't on SSDI or working for walmart it might be an issue.
21 | Amy Towns | 1542120709141287_1542571792429512 | How about letting us know about Assange's safety? He is THE man of the hour. I watched NBC and MSNBC religiously for years. You are a sell out. A complete disappointment.
22 | Halina Hukisz Kowalczyk | 1542120709141287_1542315152455176 | I demand unbiased reporting from our media outlets no matter what your political affiliation. We deserve it. You are ready to canonize Hillary and crucify Trump.
23 | Pete Leclair | 1542120709141287_1542156909137667 | The media is rigged. A well known fact. They want to enhance their own pockets and put anything up that is all truth about Trump. Sarcasm here. But will stop the rockets for Hillary so the astronauts don't miss anything good she has done. She is such a good humanitarian while the rest of the deplorable people who support Trump  need to hear this cockamania bs.Whoever thought that the media plays fair and square and would not hesitate to destroy personal lives at all costs while the dollars roll in for the good witch of the west. Get it together America. When foreign dollars are going into her coffers or showing up at her speeches for 500 a plate and notes passed by napkins written in ink. You k ow there is a problem.
24 | Kathy Seip | 1542120709141287_1542391142447577 | I would be most worried (if I were crazy enough to donate to his campaign) that people would find out that I supported a misogynistic, racist, and arrogant candidate!
25 | Clemen FisherMan | 1542120709141287_1542139712472720 | Don't worry folks, Trump and his surrogates Will say repeatedly " Wrong! we didn't publish any credit card number" and believe them, magically, It never happened. To transform Lie to truth, JUST REPEAT THAT LIE NUMEROUS TIMES AND WILL END IN TRUTH. THANKS TO TRUMP

Despite being home to less than 5% of earth’s population, the U.S. houses nearly 25% of the world’s prison population, making it the world’s leading jailer.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Shelley Margaret | 1542102985809726_1542107105809314 | Well we could do like these other countries and just let people rape and kill and steal and sell drugs.... would that be better?? Smh...Could be why so many people in other countries want to get here so desperately that they will cross our borders illegally...
2 | Randy Allen | 1542102985809726_1542108702475821 | So, the Democrats promises to help the black community really was a lie? Since the 1960's, democrats have promised jobs, better housing, better education and a bright future for their children. They lied....Democrats keep lying to blacks and the blacks fall for the lies and vote democrat again and again. So, in todays world...The democrats are the modern day slave owner.
3 | Karen Anne | 1542102985809726_1542110472475644 | Could it be that's because we're the only country that has a for profit prison system? You know, like we're the only industrialized country with a for profit health care system.
4 | John Mattison | 1542102985809726_1542105885809436 | The war on drugs has destroyed the black family, there is no reason why marijuana should send black fathers to jail. You cannot be a social conservative and continue the was on marijuana, and thus, the black family.
5 | Sheena Thompson | 1542102985809726_1542123739140984 | Incarcerate blacks for the most petty offenses, therefore giving them a record,then they are criminalized. So I high paying job with benefits they won't get due to the arrest record on file. The system works great for the disenfranchised 😩😩😩
6 | Rick Paradise | 1542102985809726_1542136015806423 | We're only in the lead because other countries don't openly document & release their stats. Throughout history, countries have often used secret prisons to house those held to be particularly dangerous to the regime/population. During its years, Soviet Russia often boasted that crime was strictly a perverse western phenomenon, that soviet society eliminated the need for theft, and that rapes and murders did not happen in the worker's paradise. This was despite the fact that many millions of citizens would be sent to secret gulags (prisons) in Siberia and Ukraine for all sorts of crimes against the state.China, North Korea,Vietnam, Cuba, and Cambodia have all done the same under their own brutal communist regimes.Middle east nations like Iran are notorious for executing people for the slightest offences, thus completely avoiding the burden of creating an actual prison system.
7 | Ken Hunichen | 1542102985809726_1542125729140785 | We have Opiates and the Democrats to thank for this. Both encourage theft and crime in impoverished communities! NBC calls for violence by creating racial divide! The best resolution to all is get the jobs back in the US and put everyone back to work just like Trump said!
8 | Robert Reyes | 1542102985809726_1542131459140212 | Great spin national Enquirer, oops I mean NBC.  This redirect reflect on the astronomical crime rate present in the US.  Only a small percentage of those committing crimes actually end up in prison
9 | Mitchell Snyder | 1542102985809726_1542109765809048 | There are two sides to this little story. On the first side you have people saying why are they in jail, and on the other side you have people saying well they broke the law. The solution is simple get rid of any nonsense laws that go beyond or outright violate the constitution/ bill of rights and whatever remains deserves to be in jail. 😉 Though honestly I think people would find that a great many still belong in jail.
10 | Timothy Crump | 1542102985809726_1542230172463674 | We have a subculture that promotes crime, reveres criminals, and chooses that lifestyle....in a country that offers more opportunity to succeed legitimately than any other country in the world....
11 | Conrad Parkes | 1542102985809726_1542534575766567 | Can you say Racism. $$$$ Injustice and Systemic. Modern day slavery moved behind bars. Eyewitness! Malcolm X said 50yrs. Ago the  Criminals assault you then charge you with assault.
12 | Doug Neuhaus | 1542102985809726_1542218265798198 | Ever notice nhow all the promises the democrats make to fix social problems are all fixes for their previous fixes?  Republicans and small business are the best way out for the poor, not government handouts.
13 | Jeff Herbig | 1542102985809726_1542196745800350 | so if 40 percent is black and poor must be a awful lot of white poor people in as well why that not brought up i know because they are white i got it now being white dont count unless they think we are being raciest
14 | Silverflute Song | 1542102985809726_1542431692443522 | As a sociologist this is always disturbing on so many levels. This country is run by money and I believe the first step in changing this is taking away the privatization of prisons. No one should make money off of something like this.
15 | Jen Sweet | 1542102985809726_1542230845796940 | because we all know here in american its a beat down society....fined, ticket, mandate, tax and imprison is what Uncle Sam does to his citizens....
16 | Doug Lambert | 1542102985809726_1542119815808043 | Although blacks in America make up 12--13% of the population, they represent 35% of all jail inmates and 37% of all prison inmates. Apparently, white defendants can afford better lawyers or don't have a lengthy criminal history, or both.
17 | Michelle Fair Schepman Hill | 1542102985809726_1542118052474886 | what is really sick there are so many in the prisons doing mandatory prison time and all they had to do is fire a gun and it doesnt matter what they were shooting the ground rats or what ever they are doing 20 years
18 | Doug Lambert | 1542102985809726_1542123675807657 | Randy---"the Lord helps those who help themselves." Anyone would mentor a black student or trainee, bc they are WILLING to  learn and work toward their goals. But too many (far too many) expect to be GIVEN whatever they want, with no effort on their part.
19 | Will Cruz | 1542102985809726_1542107869142571 | Better police forces, dedication to law and order everywhere in the country, more laws and regulations all lead to holding more people accountable for their actions.
20 | Richmond Lim | 1542102985809726_1542106449142713 | I thought the Media's Darling Obama and Clintons are doing a Good Job ??? You shouldn't publish this. It's Election period Remember? Post only the Good news. You should ONLY release this news when Trump Wins ! Go on, Blame it on Trump !
21 | Thomas Rollins | 1542102985809726_1542107412475950 | Well when you look at some of the other countries and their either lack of laws or lack of enforcement it becomes clear as to why.
22 | Zachary M. Isom | 1542102985809726_1542105705809454 | I am curious how much of this is due to other places simply killing those who are convicted of crimes. Obviously we have issues as far as the war on drugs and things of that nature that need to change ASAP, but I have a feeling the civilized tendency of our justice system has an impact as well.
23 | Nikki Bargerstock | 1542102985809726_1542591025760922 | You know who doesn't end up incarcerated? The people who follow laws. The millions and millions of people who function just fine and don't do stupid s¥€t to get themselves tossed in. So want to cut back on inmates? Sure, stop privatization. A whole justice system overhaul, cause it sure does need it! But at some point people need to realize that their actions are ON THEM. Let's bring back personal responsibility. That's a dying trend we need to rescue!
24 | Bhaskar Reddi | 1542102985809726_1542297552456936 | What does it tell you, folks? A nation of criminals no matter what the reason and consitions are. Would this change? No.Why? Politicians do not want touch with that issue. You are on you own to live and survive. The tax money u pay is going to the dust bin and from there it goes Congress's pet projects.
25 | Jay Love | 1542102985809726_1542112492475442 | The system is designed to incarcerate black people for petty crimes. The most hated race on the planet is black people and we are some of the nicest people you ever want to meet. We're like pitbulls often judged but the sweetest when you encounter us. Karma is a Bitchhh and they got it coming!

No, it's not just you. Here's why Twitter, Spotify and Reddit have been intermittently down throughout the day.

1 | Maria Zamora | 1542076942478997_1542086792478012 | Wishing they would reboot everyone's credit score to a 700 or higher!!! Lol!!
2 | Brad Bernier | 1542076942478997_1542083582478333 | If this is true it leads one to think that outside forces want into the election process and or they are constantly checking for weaknesses in the system.
3 | Catherine Carr | 1542076942478997_1542099532476738 | Well now is'nt that strange, I would say Trump has he's big money in this, so when he LOSSES, he can say "see I told you it was rig" and you fool's will believe him!!... and poor Trump can't go on twitter at 3 in the morning, doing he's coke!!
4 | Rosemary DeSantis Deene | 1542076942478997_1542119942474697 | This effected my computer at work today.  The IT guy tried explaining to me what happened, but I didn't understand.  All I knew was I was sent home early because I couldn't do any work.  At least I got paid for the full day.
5 | Janet Cieslacker | 1542076942478997_1542099712476720 | So is it the Russian's this time? Anonymous?  Maybe its our ding dongs of state practicing for their pre announced attack on Russia. None of which would surprise me at this point.
6 | Tyler Spacht | 1542076942478997_1542077995812225 | Anonymous posted a video saying they were going to shut them down,  and the media is next.
7 | Alex Casteleiro | 1542076942478997_1542412672445424 | You could just ask Trump's son to solve the problem...Trump: "I have a son. He's 10 years old. He has computers. He is so good with these computers, it's unbelievable. The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough. And maybe it's hardly doable. But I will say, we are not doing the job we should be doing. But that's true throughout our whole governmental society."
8 | Mary Harris | 1542076942478997_1542523122434379 | Just goes to show you America has dropped the ball on cyber security. While Obama worries about global warming/climate change scam we are being attacked in cyberspace daily
9 | Denise Trouard | 1542076942478997_1542362452450446 | Trump? Funny but the only cheater I've seen is Hillary who stole the primary election by cheating! Besides voting machines aren't "online" they would've had to have been rigged before they were put into place.
10 | Matthew Theroff | 1542076942478997_1542265919126766 | DDoS attacks are literally hooligan pranksters flooding the servers using millions of ip addresses to intentionally shut them down. They get a thrill out of denying access to certain services and as a gamer it pisses me off.
11 | Tim Wenzel | 1542076942478997_1542536492433042 | Who was it who just announced we would be retaliating against Russia for suspected haching? Oh yeah, our government. My guess, this is just a little taste of what the Russians will do if we screw with them.
12 | Marc Langsam | 1542076942478997_1542229069130451 | When the Obama administration announced its plan to give up U.S. protection of the internet, it promised the United Nations would never take control. But because of the administration’s naiveté or arrogance, U.N. control is the likely result if the U.S. gives up internet stewardship as planned at midnight on Sept. 30.On Friday Americans for Limited Government received a response to its Freedom of Information Act request for “all records relating to legal and policy analysis . . . concerning antitrust issues for the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers” if the U.S. gives up oversight. The administration replied it had “conducted a thorough search for responsive records within its possession and control and found no records responsive to your request.”It’s shocking the administration admits it has no plan for how Icann retains its antitrust exemption. The reason Icann can operate the entire World Wide Web root zone is that it has the status of a legal monopolist, stemming from its contract with the Commerce Department that makes Icann an “instrumentality” of government.Antitrust rules don’t apply to governments or organizations operating under government control. In a 1999 case, the Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the monopoly on internet domains because the Commerce Department had set “explicit terms” of the contract relating to the “government’s policies regarding the proper administration” of the domain system.Without the U.S. contract, Icann would seek to be overseen by another governmental group so as to keep its antitrust exemption. Authoritarian regimes have already proposed Icann become part of the U.N. to make it easier for them to censor the internet globally. So much for the Obama pledge that the U.S. would never be replaced by a “government-led or an inter-governmental organization solution.”Rick Manning, president of Americans for Limited Government, called it “simply stunning” that the “politically blinded Obama administration missed the obvious point that Icann loses its antitrust shield should the government relinquish control.”The administration might not have considered the antitrust issue, which would have been naive. Or perhaps in its arrogance the administration knew all along Icann would lose its antitrust immunity and look to the U.N. as an alternative. Congress could have voted to give Icann an antitrust exemption, but the internet giveaway plan is too flawed for legislative approval.As the administration spent the past two years preparing to give up the contract with Icann, it also stopped actively overseeing the group. That allowed Icann to abuse its monopoly over internet domains, which earns it hundreds of millions of dollars a year.Earlier this month, an independent review within Icann called the organization “simply not credible” in how it handled the application for the .inc, .llc and .llp domains. The independent review found Icann staffers were “intimately involved” in evaluating their own work. A company called Dot Registry had worked with officials of U.S. states to create a system ensuring anyone using these Web addresses was a legitimate registered company. Icann rejected Dot Registry’s application as a community, which would have resulted in lowered fees to Icann.Delaware’s secretary of state objected: “Legitimate policy concerns have been systematically brushed to the curb by Icann staffers well-skilled at manufacturing bureaucratic processes to disguise pre-determined decisions.” Dot Registry’s lawyer, Arif Ali of the Dechert firm, told me last week his experience made clear “Icann is not ready to govern itself.”Icann also refuses to award the .gay domain to community groups representing gay people around the world. Icann’s ombudsman recently urged his group to “put an end to this long and difficult issue” by granting the domain. Icann prefers to earn larger fees by putting the .gay domain up for auction among for-profit domain companies.And Icann rejects the community application for the .cpa domain made by the American Institute of CPAs, which along with other accounting groups argues consumers should expect the .cpa address only to be used by legitimate accountants, not by the highest bidder. An AICPA spokesman told me he has a pile of paperwork three feet high on the five-year quest for the .cpa domain. The professional group objected in a recent appeal: “The process seems skewed toward a financial outcome that benefits Icann itself.”The only thing worse than a monopoly overseen by the U.S. government is a monopoly overseen by no one—or by a Web-censoring U.N. Congress still has time to extend its ban on the Obama administration giving up protection of the internet. Icann has given it every reason to do so.

14 | Leah Gary | 1542076942478997_1542546392432052 | Perhaps it's some of those Russian hackers Donald Trump encouraged to "hack" into America. Either way, I'm sick and tired of this sort of thing. It's all you ever hear about any more.

18 | Sharin Rowert | 1542076942478997_1542104465809578 | NBC, ABC, CBS, most of the media, the DNC, the RNC, the FBI, the attorney general, most of Hollywood, have all jointed the Clinton Crime family, to bring down America..  YOU are all digging up dirt, FOR THEM, But, refusing to tell anything ABOUT THEM..  They are, and will be bringing in thousands of refugees (which taxpayers will have to support)..  Some will be our enemy, killing our people..  She put our country in danger, and broke the law with her e-mails..  She will appoint judges, that will make sure a baby can be killed, the day BEFORE it is born..   YOU will be responsible for destroying America, IF she is elected...  SHAME on you...

21 | Richard Rogers | 1542076942478997_1542083162478375 | I advise Mr. Obama to get back to work. His job's not done yet. I'm tired of him wasting taxpayer money! They are doing the best they can to rig this election. That's not whining, that's common sense. It's still not working! Hillary Clinton has had her silence purchased by the Middle East. These countries have even purchased a 550% increase in the number of refugees that will be brought to America from her. Countries that marry 10 year old little girls off to men 4 times their age to be one of 4 or 5 wife's, these countries allow their women to be raped nightly by their husbands with no recourse, they throw gays off buildings, they burn witches, they drown people of different faiths, we are talking about countries that are still in the 13th century as far as human/civil rights are concerned. In addition to these atrocities, Hillary Clinton has also been the most controversial political figure of all time. She has sold the government. She has no product, she has no service, she sells the government. It has also been proven through released emails that she and her party are biased against Christians, Jews, Mexicans, African Americans, Patriots, or anyone that doesn't agree with her. She has been caught up in as many sexual scandals as anybody else I know. She helped to destroy those women's lives when they accused Bill of his transgressions.

Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said he has "separated" from the U.S.
So where does the relationship between Duterte and the President Obama administration go from here? http://nbcnews.to/2ee0od8

Castro, Che', Pol-Pot and Ho Chi Min are all examples of nut jobs that gave us plenty of trouble and death. These are minor league players compared to the nut jobs like Stalin, Hitler and Mau.
2 | Nick Morales Dalmacio | 1542026365817388_1542061365813888 | A lot People are getting this wrong. There good and bad reasons why he cut ties with U.S for "Economical" reasons which is good for the country's independence. So he would not ask for U.S Aid (wealth). The bad thing is that, if ever Philippines goes to War. They're on their own.
3 | Dallas C DAlfonso | 1542026365817388_1542054675814557 | So does that mean US American CASH will no longer be Honored by the Philippines? So the $25 Billion dollars sent to the Philippines by its emigrants will stay in the US?
4 | Richmond Lim | 1542026365817388_1542054305814594 | Spoken like a true idiot really. Even the Chinese hosts look pretty 'shocked' by his statements. They must be thinking, "What da hell do you mean its China, Russia and us? " China and Russia still want business with the world. They are gonna be poor if they are gonna go against everyone else. No wonder the Filipinos never got their country right.
5 | Ben Thigpen | 1542026365817388_1542068655813159 | What happened to all the peace the democrats said Obama brought. We are at war I'm the middle east. Russia is making nuclear preparation for the US and now an island nation is laughing at us! Obama has divided a country and divided the world. Let's elect a real leader this election. Vote Trump
6 | Andre' Clark | 1542026365817388_1542089749144383 | What did the Philippines offer or provide the U.S with other than cheap labor(taking Americans jobs) and a strategic position? They gained more than they provided. All they're doing is switching to a more brutal slavemaster...

8 | Claude Berry | 1542026365817388_1542071345812890 | Understanding Duterte’s Position on South China Sea vs. The Interest of the West The South China Sea area is actually more important to the US and Europe than to the Philippines. Lying in that vast body of water is an international waterway where 5 Trillion US Dollars in global trade passes every year going to the Western countries. If China controls the whole stretch of the waterway, including overflight thereon, global trade to Europe and US will become more expensive. The adverse impact of it to the west will be very costly. This explains why US and Europe were supportive of the Philippines and they were all urging China to respect the decision of the Permanent Arbitral Tribunal favoring Philippines on our claim. Duterte’s position on the issue however, is not subservient to the West. When he declared that he is pursuing an independent foreign policy, he is bent on negotiating with China directly instead of becoming confrontational as the West wants him to be. Duterte is aware that our court victory is an empty one for lack of enforcement mechanisms on the decision. Neither the US nor the west and even any of the UN instrumentalities can help the Philippines enforce that decision. It solely relies on China’s recognition for which it has already repeatedly rejected. If we decide to confront China by force, which country will come to help us? The NATO military arsenal cannot be stretched to the South china sea because its forces are confined to Europe in an attempt to contain the Russian military flexing in Europe and mid-east. Germany will never come to aid the Philippines because of its trading relations with China. France will be a reluctant potential ally because of the external threats it has been facing. Great Britain will never send its military planes to the Philippines because it has been courting China for trading relations as an aftermath of the Brexit. If we use diplomacy, particularly by bringing the issue to the halls of the UN and asking the members to enjoin China into accepting the decision, we should take note of the fact that more than half of the countries in the UN are having trading relations with China for which they cannot afford to severe ties with, much less with ASEAN. What we see here is purely “politics among nations” at work and Philippines must be careful on its approach and for which Duterte has shown a great deal of expertise in terms of diplomatic maneuvering. Given that scenario, we are left with US and Japan at our side to help us in our confrontation with China. However, America is heavily indebted to China and the level of its trading relations with China outweighs any possibility for any war between the two. But the more serious question which should bug us is this: Is US really a true ally in this conflict? When Duterte brought out the issue on Bud Dajo Massacre in 1906, he wanted the Filipinos to revisit our alliance with the US in the light of his intention to adopt an independent foreign policy. During World War II in 1941, we fought side by side with America where we lost more than a million Filipino lives. It was never our war, yet we were invaded by Japan because America was with us. After the war, US government helped Japan in its reconstruction efforts financially and economically until it became the world’s second largest economy next to US until to date. What happened to the Philippines as an ally which gave up more than a million lives defending America? While a miniscule of assistance were given to us since World War II, these were handed out with strings attached and were designed to continue US interference in our internal affairs. Now, America and its allies in Europe want to use us again as a pawn to serve its economic and political interest in the South China Sea – to keep that international water way navigation-free. On the other hand, our main interest in the area is fishing right as well as exploiting the rich mineral resources underneath. From all indications, China is mainly interested in the control over that stretch of international waterway militarily as part of its hegemony over the region. Duterte believes that by negotiating directly with China using the decision of the court as our leverage, we can get most of what we want. However, Duterte believes that we cannot successfully negotiate with China if we remain under the shadow of Uncle Sam. Hence, the need to project an independent image to convince China that we are negotiating with them in good faith sans any influence from the West. This left US and Europe in quandary on how to protect their interest over South China Sea with the revolting posture of Duterte. The only way is to get Duterte out and replace him with a pro west Philippine President. This partly explains why the West is anti Duterte and all forces including traitors from our country are now in global conspiracy to get him out of the presidency by using all sorts of issues to discredit him, e.g. his foul mouth, extra judicial killings, hitler image, and many more to come. For all of us Filipinos, including Anti Duterte forces, the President has just expressed a long overdue rebuke on the US shabby treatment to our country as an ally in the Asia Pacific. He wants US and Europe to treat us well as co-equal. America owed our country big time based on historical accounts and Duterte wants US to realize that and pay our country even with interest. If US made Japan as the second largest economy in the world post world war II and after all the damage Japan has inflicted US and our land, why didn’t US help Philippines as much as Japan if our country is a true ally? Sanamagan. Filipinos should realize that there is more to the issues of EJK and the foul mouth of the President as systematically magnified by the West and their collaborators in our country, including both local and international media. We should “look at the forest, not just the trees”. The West wants Duterte out of the presidency for his anti-west sentiments and for his refusal to protect the interest of the west – that’s the crux of the matter and that’s what’s behind all these shenanigans. It’s a grand conspiracy to discredit him internationally because of the massive support he enjoys from our country’s masses. It’s a clear imperialistic design concocted by the West and swallowed hook line and sinker by political prostitutes and opportunists of this country to serve their selfish interests – a grave act of betrayal against the sovereignty of our country.

We give friendship love and respect but we are not idiot to let america use our country as battle ground for war against china..We know u obama!! Help from u.s?? Thank u so much we really appreciate it but no thanks if u wanted to put the lives of filipino in danger..I love u goodbye u.s.
10 | Ricardo Montiel | 1542026365817388_1542069145813110 | The Chinese said "hey, join us, America is only using you, and here's some money..." And this is what you get, a deranged (Trump-like) guy who's on his knees for China. And the Chinese govt loves this lol
11 | Bob Calder | 1542026365817388_1542095342477157 | To be clear, the fact pattern is as follows: Duterte was sworn in as President on July 1st. As of September, the death toll attributed to his police tactics against "drug dealers" has risen to 2,400 and climbing. He has all the makings of a brutal totalitarian dictator. “I don’t care about human rights, believe me,” he said in early August.Is this a failed foreign policy or a population turning their backs on civil rights and the rule of law to solve a problem. Sound familiar?
12 | James Kuloloio | 1542026365817388_1542089102477781 | He's a dictator so of course he's going to turn to Russia, China and probably North Korea.  Dictator. Hmmmmm, wasn't Ferdinand Marcos a dictator too? And how did that end up for him.
13 | Marie Cabrera-Illg | 1542026365817388_1542108995809125 | Wrong move, Mr President!  Sure, you've made a lot of progress ridding the country of drugs, but your success went to your head!  Breaking your ties with America will stroke your ego, but will hurt millions of Filipinos both in the US & the Philippines.
14 | Nikki Mahmoudi | 1542026365817388_1542144715805553 | If Obama wasn't the president, and America had a real worthy president , the Philippine president would have had much more respect. As lt is, Obama is the butt of joke of other nations. All he is worried about ,is himself, and taking advantage of tax payers money,to compensate for what he missed in life. His empty arrogance is not lost to the world, even third world countries.
15 | Bau Pham | 1542026365817388_1542061975813827 | President Duterte declared himself is Chinese, he betrayed allies and the entire Filipnos ethnic, troops, even his country. He murder revenge personal killed more than 2,000 Philippines peoples after inaugural President 90 days. All because for himself Dictator political and money, his lie excuses for country's that Filipinos don't doubt or know anything.China is communists very wicked, even get their ethnic Chinese internal organs stealing for sale. so next turn are Filipinos!Do you put belief in President Duterte?, this man might be mentally ill, he have many excuses to get your organs give to China. because all for monies, Duterte's care No one but himself. Disgusting.
16 | Jack Griffin | 1542026365817388_1636800166612467 | another Obama success?  8 years of destroying America.. funding every war on earth with our tax money.. last year he gave Syria 15 billion for weapons.. Ironic and comical that Obama gives a guy in a mud hut with no ID machine guns rocket launchers but worries about US citizens being armed...
17 | Mark Anthonio Dinochenso | 1542026365817388_1542082259145132 | Cut off all ties no travel visa's no military basses no trade no depoliticized relations just cut them off boom. Then let the people see who they want.
18 | Starry Gwalla | 1542026365817388_1542092459144112 | He needs to be ousted immediately. He's going for communism. The phillipinos are good people but they voted for communist dictator.  Now they're  about to pay for that.
19 | Lisa Jackson | 1542026365817388_1542123499141008 | Congratulations, you control your country. The United States has plenty of blood on their hands starting with stealing the land from the Natives to bringing Africans here against their will to work for free. USA, raped, robbed and murdered.
20 | Samir Yusuf | 1542026365817388_1542298015790223 | Good for you president Duterte, The US never respected your country but instead raped the Phillipnes with no apology, you cleaned up your country from drug infestation, your approval ratings are higher than any president even though some Americans think otherwise lol. Your country have the right to ally with anyone, who are Americans to decide the Phillipines future?
21 | Khal Sal Lion | 1542026365817388_1542116475808377 | Hoax but think about it dear america..(y)Dear America,Duterte: Hi! It's been a long time we've been friends. And yes we called each other "Brothers". We fought side by side and ready to die for each other. I will not forget when you helped me out during the strongest typhoon I appreciate it. But lately I realized you have taken our friendship for granted. I welcome you here in my place for free. If you want to stay go ahead. There is no requirement needed. If you want to visit me more often i am happy. But i was wondering. How come if i wanted to visit you i needed to pay a visa? If i want to stay and live there you require me to take an English exam? I do not require you to take a Filipino exam. My place is infested with drug problem and you criticized me instead of helping me out. You know like sharing technology and stuff. China has taken one of my island and he's bullying me. I won my case in the international court. As much as i wanted to fight for my right. I do not know or have doubts if you will fight with me again side by side just like old times and ready to die for each other. So since i have doubts with your kind of friendship I decided to be friends with China. And oh boy! To my surprised. He is not the bad guy I thought he is. Instead of criticizing me. He is now helping me build rehab centers and we have agreed to help each other economically. I am not leaving you for old times sake. I am just now limiting our friendship. I guess that's what really happens when you take an old friend for granted. Your little brown brother,Philippines PSI am thinking of charging you also for a visa and to take Filipino exam should you wish to visit or stay.
22 | Felino Jr Torrente | 1542026365817388_1636753919950425 | The US has been in the same situation several times before particularly in Cuba and Venezuela, among others. The US just left these countries to their own devices and look where they are now. Cuba has normalized relations with the US and Venezuela is in deep economic trouble. In 2012, to spite the US. Rafael Correa of Ecuador housed Julian Assange of Wikileaks fame at its embassy in London; now, Ecuador is regretting such decision.
23 | Stephen Young | 1542026365817388_1636759986622033 | the philippine are a desperatly poor country. they export their people. they have geographical location. and a tumultuous culture that inhibits rational growth. this latest president probably isn't doing them much good. he looks like a thug.
24 | John L. Stiffler | 1542026365817388_1542133495806675 | I hope Direct TV pulls their call centers out of there !  Of course he should talk to Cuba and see how well siding with Russia worked out for them ! Bye-Bye, this is going to save the US a lot of money.
25 | Nancy Chesney | 1542026365817388_1542322605787764 | We should not pull our troops out of there. Businesses yes. If there is any aggression to our troops then bang. All businesses need to be pull out. They move there for cheap labor 1.00 a day. Our shareholders and CEO are committing treason if they continue to do business in this country.

4 | Richard Rogers | 1542001169153241_1542007319152626 | I advise Mr. Obama to get back to work. His job's not done yet. I'm tired of him wasting taxpayer money! They are doing the best they can to rig this election. That's not whining, that's common sense. It's still not working! Hillary Clinton has had her silence purchased by the Middle East. These countries have even purchased a 550% increase in the number of refugees that will be brought to America from her. Countries that marry 10 year old little girls off to men 4 times their age to be one of 4 or 5 wife's, these countries allow their women to be raped nightly by their husbands with no recourse, they throw gays off buildings, they burn witches, they drown people of different faiths, we are talking about countries that are still in the 13th century as far as human/civil rights are concerned. In addition to these atrocities, Hillary Clinton has also been the most controversial political figure of all time. She has sold the government. She has no product, she has no service, she sells the government. It has also been proven through released emails that she and her party are biased against Christians, Jews, Mexicans, African Americans, Patriots, or anyone that doesn't agree with her. She has been caught up in as many sexual scandals as anybody else I know. She helped to destroy those women's lives when they accused Bill of his transgressions. In short, get out of the political influence business. You too Family Guy or at least deal in an even-handed fashion. #familyguy #trump2016 #nobama

10 | Gordon Gabaree | 1542001169153241_1542013052485386 | I lock my doors at night and I've own homes with walls and so do alot of us for many different reasons.That doesn't make us racists! So listen to me, Millions of Trump supporters feel this way about Donald J. Trump....."We don't care if the guy swears... or how many times he's been married...or who he voted for, or what his income tax return shows. We want the problems fixed. Yes he's an egomaniac, but we don't care. We know he's not a racist, or bad to women, or all the other things the liberal media is trying to label him with. We know he's raised a good family, and that says a lot about him.The country is a mess because politicians suck, the Republican Party is two faced & gutless, and illegals are everywhere and Radical Islamic Terrorists are openly trying to hurt this country and make the civilized world adjust to them. We want it all fixed!We don't care that Trump is crude, we don't care that sometimes he changed a position.He's showing us he can be a flexible leader as we show him are concerns.We don't care that he fights with Megan Kelly, Rosie O'Donnell, and so many of the elected establishment. We don't care that Cruz, Ryan, the Bush's, and so many other top old and new Republicans refuse to endorse him for their own selfish reasons, and we know what they are. We don't care that he doesn't know the name of some Radical Islamic Terrorists, we don't care that he tried some businesses that didn't work out.Great businessmen built this country of ours in the likes of Rockefeller,Vanderbilt and Carnegie! They had bankruptcy's.This country is weak, bankrupt, our enemies are making fun of us, we are being invaded by illegals, we are becoming a nation of victims, where every Tom, Ricardo and Hasid is a special group with special rights to a point where we don't even recognize the country we were born and raised in, AND  JUST WANT IT FIXED. And TRUMP is the only guy who seems to understand what the people want.He even asks groups of us what we want him to do regarding issues that all of us live by.Wow, For the People,By the People!We're sick of politicians, sick of the Democratic and Republican Party. We're angry about the Iran deal, the budget, treatment of Israel, military weakness, lobbyists, special interests, overpaid politicians with their self serving bills and back room deals, trade deals, loss of jobs, manipulated economic numbers, businesses fleeing,Obamacare needs to be replaced and State borders need to be opened up for real healthcare competition and even the phoney Pay for Play Clinton Foundation.Americans are no longer going to be fooled, and the movement is out to change the direction we're taking. Trump may not be a saint, but he doesn't have lobbyist money holding him, he doesn't have political correctness restraining him, and all you know is that he has been very successful, a good negotiator, he has built a lot of things, he's flexible, and he's also not a politician. And he says he'll fix it. And we believe him because he is too much of an egotist to be proven wrong or looked at and called a liar.Public service has become elected greed. This may be our only chance to have a Non-Politician. He's not perfect, he's 70 years old and made his fortune and I think he's Truly  Genuine in his love of our counrty and wants to make things better for All.... Despite his flaws try and correct the mess, at least for 4 years. We must take the shot, because the consequences of putting Hillary Clinton in office are frightening. There is a tidal wave happening, and its going to overcome much of what's happened to this country and remember that Mike Pence is a Good Man and Politician standing beside Mr. Trump."

2 | Dwayne Leggett | 1541980792488612_1541993919153966 | Sounds about right. We the people bathing in dirty over priced water. Fighting high light bills and over priced cost of living tax. While these politicians showing out wasting time and money. If Americans keep waiting on  politicians too make life better we Doomed.
3 | Mark Corney | 1541980792488612_1541987589154599 | Sounds like the Clinton and Obama Presidencies. Joseph Goebbels:On the "Big Lie"“If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it. The lie can be maintained only for such time as the State can shield the people from the political, economic and/or military consequences of the lie. It thus becomes vitally important for the State to use all of its powers to repress dissent, for the truth is the mortal enemy of the lie, and thus by extension, the truth is the greatest enemy of the State.”But it was the Nazi's.

Accepting the same or vote for change. My vote is for change, exposing, and prosecuting the corrupt.
5 | Tony Tone | 1541980792488612_1541982919155066 | Okay Hillary Clinton where are your 33,000 deleted emails, what happened in Benghazi, how come you are worth over $300 millions with no product or business despite you saying in 2000 that you were broke & in debt and why are people who worked for you are suddenly found dead with "6 gun shot wounds" in the back of the head in an apparent made believe suicide just days before they were to expose you?Please no pivoting back to Donald J. Trump's private locker room chats.
6 | Henry Garcia | 1541980792488612_1542061895813835 | You Trumplorables are a shame to yourself no wonder why Trumps going to lose. Can't even read a story and enjoy it but you have to bring the hatred into every aspect of everyone life. Give it a break and if you don't like this country then leave. AMERICA LOVE IT OR LEAVE IT!!! Do us all a favor and leave.
7 | Les Brown | 1541980792488612_1541988179154540 | Tied to Hillary and the White House 2 Felons Robert Creamer and Scott Foval.Scott Foval: "We have mentally ill people we pay to do sh*! make no mistake"We want answers now!!!! Demand congressional investigation!!
8 | Richard Rogers | 1541980792488612_1542007459152612 | I advise Mr. Obama to get back to work. His job's not done yet. I'm tired of him wasting taxpayer money! They are doing the best they can to rig this election. That's not whining, that's common sense. It's still not working! Hillary Clinton has had her silence purchased by the Middle East. These countries have even purchased a 550% increase in the number of refugees that will be brought to America from her. Countries that marry 10 year old little girls off to men 4 times their age to be one of 4 or 5 wife's, these countries allow their women to be raped nightly by their husbands with no recourse, they throw gays off buildings, they burn witches, they drown people of different faiths, we are talking about countries that are still in the 13th century as far as human/civil rights are concerned. In addition to these atrocities, Hillary Clinton has also been the most controversial political figure of all time. She has sold the government. She has no product, she has no service, she sells the government. It has also been proven through released emails that she and her party are biased against Christians, Jews, Mexicans, African Americans, Patriots, or anyone that doesn't agree with her. She has been caught up in as many sexual scandals as anybody else I know. She helped to destroy those women's lives when they accused Bill of his transgressions. In short, get out of the political influence business. You too Family Guy or at least deal in an even-handed fashion. #familyguy #trump2016 #nobama

11 | Michael Smith | 1541980792488612_1542051472481544 | Who's Joe Biden? You never here anything about this clown because he don't do anything worth talking about.

16 | Randy Curry | 1541980792488612_1542050382481653 | The postings here show that there are way too many morons in the US
17 | Paul John Gavagan | 1541980792488612_1541983285821696 | HILLARY:“My accomplishments as Secretary of State? Well, I’m glad you asked! My proudest accomplishment in which I take the most pride, mostly because of the opposition it faced early on, you know, the remnants of prior situations and mind-sets that were too narrowly focused in a manner whereby they may have overlooked the bigger picture, and we didn’t do that, and I’m proud of that. Very proud. I would say that’s a major accomplishment.” Hillary Clinton 11 March 2014 Could someone please tell me what she just said? And she is running for President!???
18 | Teddy Simon | 1541980792488612_1541989839154374 | And again some are so uneducated they can't even read to know they are commenting on the wrong article . Trumparrots .

23 | Thomas Donaldson | 1541980792488612_1542559755764049 | Actually.. it's just the opposite.... The reason why the Democrat party is so concerned about Trump accepting defeat.. Is because the Democrats know that we know they're cheating.. Only a cheater would  even ask that question... Obviously Trump has the majority vote..... The only ones voting for Hillary are the criminals ...So the Democrats have to cheat.. remember they're criminals... Criminals don't give up power once they get it... So they cheat... Now the cheaters are asking us if we will roll over ..when we catch them cheating.... No.. I don't think so.. not this time... The Constitution says the citizens can legally remove a corrupt government...
24 | James Goodman | 1541980792488612_1542289629124395 | Let's talk about the level of have not seen this man in 8 years now all of a sudden he has this energy what up a puppet

45% of Republicans said they might not accept election results following Donald J. Trump's warning.

1 | Brian Engel | 1541935552493136_1541937639159594 | This has to be the dumbest story in the news. Who cares if X candidate "accepts it", the electors will cast their votes and that is who the President will be.... period, like it or not.
2 | Slayde Warren | 1541935552493136_1541939149159443 | It's your choice not to accept it. There is nor has there ever been evidence of widespread voter fraud. Voter suppression yes. Fraud, no. One of the two will win. The loser can choose to accept it or not. It's irrelevant. You don't have to concede but it changes nothing.
3 | Jeremy Lee Jones | 1541935552493136_1541938972492794 | Here is the kicker for all the liberals. 15% more democrats are poled so your up by 9 so technically your down by 6% which is 2% above error. Trump wins!
4 | Kevin D. Johnson | 1541935552493136_1541944622492229 | They're idiots. Don't accept man made global warming either, but that's not going to prevent it from happening. They have immature minds. They don't get their way, throw a tantrum.
5 | Regina-Paul Nevins | 1541935552493136_1541945149158843 | Why is there such and outcry over this, are the liberals and democrats forgetting Al Gore not accepting the results and taking it to the Supreme Court not long ago  ? That didn't seem to be an issue, the democrats rigged the election against Bernie as proven thru emails, if Trump has proof of voter fraud he shouldn't accept it nor should the American people
6 | Jennifer Martin | 1541935552493136_1541942509159107 | You are talking about people who don't believe in evolution and thinks the sun revolves around the earth. Religious people are easy to tricked into believing all manner of the ridiculous.
7 | Mike McNeil | 1541935552493136_1541937089159649 | I am not sure how anyone is not at least a little skeptical of the validity of elections when we see political parties use any media or political manipulation available , and that their elitist and industrial supporters will spend any amount of money to buy influence.  That the only possible thing that prevents rigged elections would be that their propaganda is so effective that there is no need,or fear of discovery.  Certaintly not that there are no wolves at democrcys door.
8 | Corey Roberts | 1541935552493136_1541957639157594 | One of two things will rot and die after this election; either the Republican Party, or America itself. Ignorance has become the new common sense. Feelings and beliefs have become the new fact and truth. Conspiracy theories run amok, despite any credible evidence to back them up. Science has become a belief. Hatred has be patriotic.
9 | John Schmidt | 1541935552493136_1541974369155921 | I didn't "accept" Reagan or either Bush being elected, esp Reagan. I expressed my outrage by being involved in the process to advocate for candidates of my choice. That statistic is propaganda used to get more votes. If Trump's message was clear and productive *and* represented the values of the majority in the nation GOPers would not have to resort to fear-mongering.
10 | Sonya M. Lovin-Stace | 1541935552493136_1782337208687196 | At this point I wouldn't put it past some of these Republican fanatics to mess with the polls and try to make people believe the Democrats are behind it. Even in that dinner last night Hillary had more support and if 50 republicans in our government are backing away that has to say something.
11 | Valerie Wagner | 1541935552493136_1541967822489909 | Someone explain what he thinks will happen if he loses please. Yes he can demand a recount and yes there will be legal holdups but we've all faced that before. His supporters are threatening an uprising? So basically if he can't win he's going to try to take the position by force? Interesting. I'm gonna need more popcorn.
12 | Rick Stoll | 1541935552493136_1541948195825205 | At the beginning of this campaign Trump said in a speech  we are going to win so much you will get tired of winning. Okay, now replace "winning" with "losing". Have a nice day!
13 | Luis Moral | 1541935552493136_1541959195824105 | Of course Trump has no preparation no knowledge all he has are a bunch of slogansand all this people who never been involved in politic and are now cause social media they are very unreasonable you have to understand that Trump isn't gonna turn Washington upside down we have a congress an a senate that can limit and will limit his powers if he had a chance of winning but nayhe wont win
14 | Jeff Willis | 1541935552493136_1541940219159336 | Well have you seen those videos about ppl from the democrats saying how they done it for 50 years and will keep doing it?? And the NY democrat commissioner of elections saying how it's rigged?? Smh
15 | Donna Elizabeth Pagano | 1541935552493136_1541945635825461 | Ok Fox. Tell your followers the truth. Although problems exist with dead voters not being removed from lists the study Trump quoted said only 31 cases of voter fraud were linked. The other discrepancies are from people not changing their address. You may be one of them.
16 | Joseph Mueller | 1541935552493136_1362579797109377 | You know, I just don't think I care what these people who "aren't going to accept the results" think. It's not up to them. This is The United States...we're going to have an election and someone will win. In January, that winner will become President. That's how it works and if a minority of voters who's candidate lost doesn't like it, then they can learn to deal with it.
17 | Mymy N. Swanson | 1541935552493136_1541958562490835 | Who cares what the CORRUPTED, BIASED and LOBBYISTS medias as Washington post, CNN, ABC news, NBC, CBS, MSNBC ...or crooked Hilary PETES think !! The silent majority will talk the November 8th wait and see !!
18 | Michael Rios | 1541935552493136_1782319048689012 | Hillary won the first debate by a lot but in the second one she did terrible. She still won but Trump was right behind her and I wouldn't consider that a real win. In the third debate she destroyed him or rather Trump destroyed himself. She didn't have to try hard to win but she was on her A game. Trump sank like a stone and just hurting himself. There was a moment you could see him realize he lost and no matter what he tried it was to late.
19 | Mark Lloyd | 1541935552493136_1541985412488150 | In political discussions, people say things like "I fear that a 3rd party vote is essentially a vote for major candidate X" (Hillary Clinton/Donald J. Trump). I realize that it is a virtual certainty that Clinton or Trump will win. If you truly support one of them that is fine. However, I refuse to let my vote help/support either of them. My vote is for massive change to the broken 2-party system. We can't fix a broken system by voting to keep the same system. The time for true change is now!Change has to start somewhere. The political parties have been changed in this country before and they can be again. But we have to be willing to step up and be heard! If I have to choose between taking the blue pill or the red pill, I'll take no pill at all."America deserves better. The two-party duopoly has brought us here. It’s time to try another way." - Gary Johnson #LiveFree #Checkout3rdParties #SendaMessage #JohnsonWeld
20 | Teresa Mac | 1541935552493136_1541987002487991 | The party that constantly talks about the Founding Fathers, the Constitution, their patriotism, won't or might not accept the election results.  The signers of the Constitution are spinning in their graves.
21 | Gloria Vargas | 1541935552493136_1362613533772670 | Mr. Trump has the choice not accept Hillary nomination for President but we all know who's getting the Mallory of votes on this campaign!!!'..... he is not prepare to be the president of this nation he had provided to all of us his temperament, authority put him down!!!!!
22 | Jason Morales | 1541935552493136_1541965989156759 | Let's be honest here. There is 319.8 million people In the United states of america. Of those people who actually can and do vote only 538 votes actually matter. You can not tell me that some of these people are in others pockets. We will NEVER be a TRUE democracy until we get rid of the college electoral vote and go to general population vote.  Way to much power and corruption in america!!!
23 | Leslie Lyen-Zylstra | 1541935552493136_1362549777112379 | This election has become a circus. Turning intelligent sane people crazy. Making our country a laughing stock to the rest of the world and l for one will be glad to have this whole fiasco over.
24 | Ricky A Don | 1541935552493136_1541963372490354 | Trump is popular amongst his Republicans fan base BUT it wont help him to the white house. .To win an presidential election you need 45% white 65% woman vote 70% black vote 60% Hispanics vote and 65% Asian and other race 39% Hillary has all that ...The only thing Trump has going for him is white male vote that alone wont get Trump at the white house unless Hillary invited him lol
25 | Ann C Cleland | 1541935552493136_1541973302489361 | Look at last election stats . Any area that did not have voter id laws, Obama won. Any area that had voter id ,he lost. Some areas had more votes than voters on the books AND some areas had ZERO votes for Romney. Statistically not realistic.
