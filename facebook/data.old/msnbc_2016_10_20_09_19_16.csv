"He is obsessed, and in some ways rightfully so, about voter fraud, and he believes he's been totally mistreated by the media," Reince Priebus, the Chairman of the Republican Party told NBC's Hallie Jackson.

America was great before Trump told us it wasn't, and despite his insinuations it will be great once he loses and moves on to Trump TV Network to milk his followers for a monthly fee. The part of America that enables him to be a capitalist and make money off those people is why America is great. Capitalism 101.
2 | Dave Severson | 1326250020804580_1326266620802920 | So, in the mind of Trump and his supporters, any republican who wins a seat in the House or Senate will have won their seat because of a "rigged" election and their win should be null and void too?
3 | Nicholas J Stojakovich | 1326250020804580_1326267117469537 | IF IT WON'T CONCEDE-IT LEADSPredictably and immediately the MSM became obsessed and went bat***t crazy over Trump's refusal to say he will accept the results of the election if he loses. Further stoking the flames of unrest, that they now want you to believe they are so concerned and worried about. Give me a break. Once again their hypocrisy knows no bounds. Just take a good hard look at how one-sided they covered the Baltimore, Ferguson and Philadelphia riots, repeatedly referring to them as citizens exercising the rights of free speech and "righteous rage", when buildings and automobiles were being burned, stores looted and numerous people were physically attacked and assaulted, occasionally resulting in their deaths. I'll agree that it could and should have been better phrased. However, what Trump communicated was that he will wait to see how the election was conducted. Not that he would not concede. I've never seen anything remotely like this, where a candidate is asked repeatedly over and over again if he will concede, before one vote is even cast. And why not ask the other candidate the same question over and over again?Is it really unheard of in American political history, where a candidate does not immediately concede after an election, because of some highly unusual irregularities?I distinctly remember that Al Gore spent nearly three months litigating the results of the 2000 election and that many of his progressive supporters attacked Bush as an illegitimate president even after the SCOTUS decision, for years afterwards, some to this very day. Some of the pundits and prognosticators, that have come to despise Trump with every fiber of their being, characterized this as Trump being against a "peaceful" transition, while continuing to ignore hard evidence that HRC working in tandem with the DCCC and HRC Super Pacs, actually paid the homeless and mentally ill, to start riots at Trump rallies throughout the country. This notion is absurd, that Trump who has repeatedly condemned the breakdown of law and order in society and is overwhelmingly supported by law enforcement, would be refusing to concede because he's setting the stage for rebellion, riots and revolution. Frankly, I'm much more concerned with this occurring by instigators and anarchists on the hard progressive left and Alinsky trained union activists, if Trump came from behind and actually won. Bob Creamer and his cronies have certainly demonstrated that they have the means, know how and are willing to engage in such activities. What Trump said was that he will review how the election is conducted and then decide. Given the behavior surrounding this election, such as the Pew report on the number of mistakes in registered voters, the Hillary campaign paying thugs to start fights at Trump rallies, the MSM comparatively refusing to cover the email scandal, and Wikileaks, it is not entirely unreasonable to say I will review how the 2016 election was conducted before I congratulate Hillary Clinton. /NJS
4 | Eidref Esguerra Santiago | 1326250020804580_1326265957469653 | Thats true....Trump enemy is not Hillary that F**** media wants to ride for 10 mins. popularity to make their TV Stations better rating. Also failure of his fellow GOP to support him. After Trump I will never vote for this J**** A**** Republicans.
5 | Robert Neff | 1326250020804580_1326264007469848 | Trump even said the Emmys were rigged against him. I have a feeling he's not going to go quietly. In Trumps mind, everything is a conspiracy against him. That's how paranoid psychopathic narcissists think.
6 | Kathy Terry Hansen | 1326250020804580_1326265857469663 | YAAAAWWWWNNN!Trump is a thin skinned manbaby! Bragged how the media got him the nomination and now blaming it for his losing. Of course it had absolutely nothing to do with his bad policy's, filthy mouth or his disregard for the truth.
7 | Mike Williams | 1326250020804580_1326258967470352 | Abortion is a horrific crime against humanity, and when a society is willing to kill the unborn in order to benefit financially, we’re sliding down a slippery slope of immorality right into utter destruction.
8 | Rennae Marshall Christman | 1326250020804580_1326264624136453 | Why is it that the question of accepting election results wasn't asked of Hillary Clinton? Even after she replied that it is customary to accept the decision she still NEVER said she would accept the decision. Lord knows with 96% of the media donating to the Clinton campaign do we really need to consider the coverage here and the fairness?? Plus if you look at her near the end of the debate she had all she could do to keep her eyes open...WATCH..We the people support Donald Trump!! Hillary was TRUMPED when it comes to truth, honesty and corruption!! We the people support Donald Trump!!
9 | Kimberly MacDonald | 1326250020804580_1326264767469772 | Oh shut the hell up Priebus! Trump is a hot mess and you know it. Oh..by the way..he is destroying what is left of your pathetic party you know.
10 | Funmi Akinsanya | 1326250020804580_1326266160802966 | Yes the media are doing Halliry work for her but guess who's providing all the materials Mr Trump, the media are reporting what he says and does plus Trump brings ratings and the media loves that, he loves that as well in the primaries but since the demographics are different in the general his crying foul....
11 | Marty Beatty | 1326250020804580_1326258767470372 | American Thinker   October 20, 2016Such a nasty womanBy J. MarsoloAt the end of the debate, while Hillary was droning on with snippets rehearsed, Trump gave the best description of Hillary.  He said, "Such a nasty woman."  Who could disagree with that?  She is nasty and a woman.On substance and manner, Trump was clearly the winner.  Hillary gave her usual robotic answers sprinkled with cheap shots, which is her preparation for the past week.Trump brought out that the violence at his rally in Chicago and other rallies was caused by operatives of the Clinton campaign.  Hillary did not deny it.On the Middle East disaster in Syria, Iraq, Iran, and Libya, Trump clearly stated that Obama and Hillary, as secretary of state, caused the disaster by withdrawing from Iraq without leaving a force.  Hilary did not deny it.On Mosul, Trump said we announced several months ago that we would attack Mosul to get the ISIS leaders, thus giving the ISIS heads-up to leave.  Hillary did not defend giving the ISIS leaders advance warning so they could leave Mosul.  So if we take Mosul, so what?  The ISIS leaders have left, so they can continue to attack us.On the emails scandal, Hillary did not deny that she destroyed emails after a subpoena was issued by Congress.On the question whether we should leave a force in Iraq if we defeat ISIS, Hillary gave a "Clintonian" answer that we would not leave an "occupying force."  Hillary, if president, may leave a force but not classify it as an "occupying force" and call it another name.Trump was clear that we would build the wall and support the Second Amendment, whereas Hillary dodged the question about her speech advocating "open borders."  She gave a Clintonian answer that this meant not open borders for immigration, but open borders for electrical grids.  Only the MSM believes this.Hillary dodged the question on the corruption in Haiti by the Clinton Foundation. Trump was clear on reducing taxes and appointing conservative judges who may overturn Roe v. Wade, thus sending the abortion issue back to the states, which was the law until 1971.  He was strong in opposing late-term abortions, whereas Hillary clearly supports abortion up to the minute of birth.The big issue for the TV pundits was Trump's refusal to say he will accept the results of the election if he loses.  Trump said he will wait to see how the election is conducted.  Al Gore spent three months litigating the results of the 2000 election, then many Democrats attacked Bush as an illegitimate president.Some of the TV pundits tried to characterize this as Trump being against a peaceful transition.  This is absurd.  Trump said he will review how the election is conducted and then decide.  Given the issues surrounding the election, such as the Pew report on the number of mistakes in registered voters, the Hillary campaign paying thugs to start fights at Trump rallies, the MSM refusing to cover the email scandal, and Wikileaks, it is rational to say we will review how the election was conducted.Trump won because his issues of reducing taxes, border control, and defeating terrorism are in the best interest of our country.  Trump made it clear that Hillary will be the third term of Obama.
12 | Jeffrey J. Jones | 1326250020804580_1326265447469704 | People seem to forget, that Al Gore didn't accept the results of an election, in fact he took it to the Supreme Court. When they ruled against him, he and some of his followers still didn't accept it, to this very day.
13 | Leslie Sloss | 1326250020804580_1326262967469952 | Come on now. Let's please move on from the Trump fiasco. It's finished. It's done. He has officially imploded. It's embarrassing to watch this mess.
14 | Freddie Golino | 1326250020804580_1326255120804070 | Hmm...I see millionaires and billionaires telling me to vote for Hillary. I see all these actors and actresses who don’t live in reality tell me to vote for Hillary. I see that Hillary's biggest donors are Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and Citibank. These elite folk don't want things to change. Their pockets are getting fat and ours skinny. I'm voting for Trump! I guess to be fair Trump is a billionaire!
15 | William Harden | 1326250020804580_1326264957469753 | Truth hurts. Media serves the left not the news. Thank god we have the internet so we can research the truth ourselves and be able to look past the left wing media manipulation.
16 | Freddie Golino | 1326250020804580_1326253617470887 | Imagine a woman who's actions killed 4 Americans in Benghazi, a women who calls young black males "super predators", a woman who sold out the State Department to folks who donated to her foundation, a woman who lied to the FBI for 18 months, a woman who lied to the American people for 18 months. And most of all...A woman who went after her husbands victims after he raped them. Sound like a horrible human being? Hillary Clinton has done all of these things and if she were not rich she'd be in jail by now.
17 | Jeff Erickson | 1326250020804580_1326259380803644 | Except there is no voter fraud unless you count the fact that republican governors and republican state legislatures have purposely passed voter suppression measures directly aimed at minorities.
18 | Fall Abdoul | 1326250020804580_1326266894136226 | Here is the man whose election at the top of RNC signaled GOP crash.
19 | Virginia Perez | 1326250020804580_1326252897470959 | Got nothing to say about how the Republicans busted Hillary's campaign, the DNC and the press too? Inciting violence or what they call, 'Conflict Engagement' and then blaming it on Bernie supporters. They caught them cheating in Iowa. It's not just the supposed, 'Russians.' When will you people admit you're advocating the violence? When will you people admit you're just as dangerous? Bernie's offices were shot up and the Republicans were firebombed. Julian Assange was silenced because he committed the crime of telling the TRUTH. Clinton's supporters are just fine with first amendment suppression, loved Naked Trump but smashed Naked Hillary like ISIS. Get over yourselves Democrats. You ain't making JFK or MLK or John Lennon or any of your supposed hero's proud.
20 | Martha Gower Moseman | 1326250020804580_1326261254136790 | Everything he's gotten....he's asked for....you act like a fool....then expect to be treated like a moron
21 | Samantha Smith | 1326250020804580_1326253887470860 | so every time THEY loss its fraud if they win it was fair right? why didn't he say that when he won the primary? wasn't voter fraud than? hmm interesting maybe it was we should look into that
22 | Chris Tanner | 1326250020804580_1326256504137265 | All the kings horses, and all the kings men, couldn't put Dumbty Trumpty back together again.

24 | Cheryl Brady | 1326250020804580_1326253060804276 | Rience CANNOT possibly know if Trump is going to accept the election results. Unless he's psychic?

One study found just 31 verified cases of voter fraud out of 1,000,000,000 votes cast.

1 | Pakalu Papito | 1326245050805077_1326254017470847 | am i cute? No. But do i have a nice personality? Also no
2 | Patrick Bittel | 1326245050805077_1326254280804154 | If elections are rigged that explains why Republicans hold more than half of the seats in the house and Senate and most of the the governors are Republicans and most of the state legislatures are Republicans. They got there through rigged elections.
3 | Gregg Duarte | 1326245050805077_1326261640803418 | Call bs. Just in the last month just one of the many dead people voting in Colorado voted 6 times since being dead. And the illegal Washington mall shooter voter illegally 3 times.
4 | Chuck Stanley | 1326245050805077_1326259444136971 | There were more cases than that in texas alone. Google texas election fraud investigation.     They say 'one study' well I can find one study that will show my dog is smarter than both the two humans shown in this photo
5 | Jim Baker | 1326245050805077_1326259860803596 | It only took one ALLEGED case for Al Gore to refuse to accept the results and MSNBC talking heads accused the SCOTUS of stealing the election from him. You clowns really have no credibility anymore.
6 | Ramona Hundley | 1326245050805077_1326259220803660 | That just means that's all they are owning up to finding. After all, this is the same FBI that cleared Hillary on her emails.
7 | Mike Williams | 1326245050805077_1326256227470626 | Abortion is a horrific crime against humanity, and when a society is willing to kill the unborn in order to benefit financially, we’re sliding down a slippery slope of immorality right into utter destruction.
8 | Mike Foster | 1326245050805077_1326262770803305 | 33,000 missing subpoenaed Emails is obstruction of justice.. Hillary will lose..Obamas DOJ may keep her out of jail.. but Americans will keep her out of power.
9 | Freddie Golino | 1326245050805077_1326258704137045 | Hmm...I see millionaires and billionaires telling me to vote for Hillary. I see all these actors and actresses who don’t live in reality tell me to vote for Hillary. I see that Hillary's biggest donors are Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and Citibank.

10 | Robert Crouch | 1326245050805077_1326253827470866 | must have been a democrat study paid to cover up multiple voter frauds.. honestly,major believe this outlet of cover up artists for Clinton BUT other democrats...Hypocrite Hillary..  new nickname!
11 | Mike Alalof | 1326245050805077_1326245934138322 | That sound you heard in last nights debate was the final nail hammered into Trump's political coffin. His childish temperament was glaring when Hillary called him a “Putin's Puppet” and Trump using that first grade retort “No your're his puppet”. His lack of maturity is simply astounding. Also Trump's refusal to tell us if he would concede the election outcome with a “wait and see” comment that a dictator like Putin or any other dictator would say to throw doubt in our election process. No, Mr. Trump, it's time to lower your political campaign into the ground.
12 | Cheryl Brady | 1326245050805077_1326246307471618 | BUT....Trump of course will say that the "fact-checking" was rigged.
13 | Dan Pretto | 1326245050805077_1326249727471276 | So that's proof that it does happen. And for every instance that was identified, how many more were not?
14 | Jess Esuarp | 1326245050805077_1326245584138357 | Apparently, the FBI forgot to visit the Cornell Law Library. Word for word from the Cornell Law Library Former United States Attorney General Michael Mukasey tells MSNBC that not only is Hillary Clinton's private email server illegal, it "disqualifies" her from holding any federal office. Very specifically points to one federal law, Title 18. Section 2071.(google this)For those of us who do not have United States Code committed to memory, here's what it says:“(a) Whoever willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys, or attempts to do so, or, with intent to do so takes and carries away any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both. (b) Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States. As used in this subsection, the term “office” does not include the office held by any person as a retired officer of the Armed Forces of the United States.”Yes, it explicitly states "shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States."Shouldn't voters know that? The media won't tell them. So it's up to us.Can you help hold Hillary accountable?
15 | Ssenabulya Dan | 1326245050805077_1326249737471275 | Well, Trump will just say that the study and/or the factchecker is rigged!
16 | Virginia Perez | 1326245050805077_1326249420804640 | Russians have committed Espionage because Wikileaks or some pimple faced hacker busted her cheating. Talking about her support of TPP and how she supports natural gas pipelines!!! Basically, climate change isn't real and her position is symbolic. She's something else. The new scare word is Espionage. Be very afraid, the Russians want you to have a democracy!! By the way, Europeans have no problem working with Russia, they just landed on Mars together.
17 | John McAuliffe | 1326245050805077_1326249664137949 | Check a second study then.
18 | Erik LaPresta | 1326245050805077_1326263147469934 | What about the DNC thugs attacking Trump supporters in Chicago? They put American citizens and our police officers in danger. Another pass?
19 | Paul C. Norton | 1326245050805077_1326267634136152 | How many more votes than the opponent does the winner need to win? Is it more than 31 our less than 31?
20 | Shawn Adams | 1326245050805077_1326250374137878 | You can't tell that to the right wing radio listeners they are fed propaganda all day long.
21 | Beulah Marie | 1326245050805077_1326263630803219 | If there is evidence of voter fraud why should he, or we the American people, accept the results. And based on the Project Veritas undercover videos released, it has admittedly be done for years! Why is the media and America not livid at what was revealed in those videos but will immediately crucify Trump for saying that he would wait and see what actually happens before making that commitment. Should we just idly sit by and allow the corruption of the election system in this country to continue? In case you haven't seen those videos for yourself here is the link to their website.  Watch it and make your own decision and stop letting the media make decisions for you and do not comment unless you have watched both videos! (And by the way, Scott Foval has since been fired from his position and Bob Creamer, who has been to the White House over 340 times, has since resigned due to these videos)... http://projectveritasaction.com/
22 | Mark A Wolfe | 1326245050805077_1326259464136969 | Then why are they investigating all 93 counties in Indiana for voter fraud when they're finding boxes stuffed with Democratic votes
23 | Marcus Ling | 1326245050805077_1326263517469897 | That fact doesn't preclude the state's Secretary of State. Oh FL.
24 | Stephen Szymanik | 1326245050805077_1326257850803797 | One case is fraud.How can you think illegal is ok just because there aren't that many cases.  Scumbag biased tabloid!!!
25 | Chris Tanner | 1326245050805077_1326259064137009 | All the kings horses, and all the kings men, couldn't put Dumbty Trumpty back together again.

Here are the five major takeaways from the final debate between Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Gerry Hopkins Dwyer | 1326185977477651_1326190377477211 | Will somebody tell Kellyann Donnelly that Hillary Clinton won the last debate. Honestly I know she gets paid to say Trump won but, she's really become quite a bore and looking real stupid as her candidate!
2 | Bryant Miller Jr. | 1326185977477651_1326192560810326 | Whats wrong with waiting on results? Also there are no proof that Russia is helping trump at all. They have no clue who hacked the server and they stated that FACT. When Sanders was talking about corruption everyone was all for him but Hillary BULLIED him out of the race but when trump talks about corruption the media rips him apart. Sounds a lil sketchy to me.
3 | Jennifer Rich | 1326185977477651_1326188747477374 | Every time I see Trump on a debate he sounds like such an idiot. I'm embarrassed that other countries are watching this play out, and this is coming from someone who doesn't care for Hillary either.
4 | Jimi  LaLumia | 1326185977477651_1326190954143820 | Losers* Donald Trump: Top to bottom, this was Trump's most consistent and best debate. But, it wasn't a good debate for him. Not at all. His signature moment — and the defining moment of the entire debate — came when he refused to say he would concede if the election results showed he had lost. Trump's I'll-just-wait-and-see answer was a total disaster and will be the only thing people are talking about coming out of the debate.
5 | Jim Baker | 1326185977477651_1326186294144286 | I will never forget the smiling face of the pantsuit Don when Trump brought up the video proving Democratic officials PAID hit men to incite violence at political rallies. That is text book organized crime.
6 | Chris Sommers | 1326185977477651_1326196007476648 | Did Donald J. Trump just call Hillary Clinton a nasty woman? Says the one who likes groping on women and kissing them without their consent...
7 | Chester Bush | 1326185977477651_1326186547477594 | This morning the main stream media is totally fixated on whether Trump would accept the election results yet last week Al Gore was on stag with Hillary whining that his election was stolen even after he took the results to the Supreme Court.yet no one looks at him with total distaste for his actions.
8 | Joseph Matthews | 1326185977477651_1326243000805282 | I know that MSNBC and other government-run media have to find a negative to report about Donald Trump at the conclusion of the debate to overshadow the fact that he continued to expose her corrupt, pathologically immoral actions and ineffective policy proposals, so that doesn't surprise me. Most average voters could care less what he said about whether he would accept the results or not. I don't think most people much understood the question or the answer. I mean, what's he going to do if he doesn't accept the results, march down the street bearing muskets and rifles. It's obvious MSNBC and other networks will do everything in their power to get Mrs. Clinton into the White House, though it's hard to understand why. Perhaps they fear it would cut into their cozy relationship with the establishment inside the Beltway or it would mean they couldn't cut corners in paying taxes. There has to be some reason because she offers nothing but lies, scandals and was an absolutely horrendous secretary of state who accomplished nothing other than flying around a lot and put the country in danger through her use of a private server.
9 | Gloria Little | 1326185977477651_1326194570810125 | Hillary Clinton Vs Donald Trump Facts:Of the two candidates running for president...Only Hillary Clinton was caught lying to congress.Only Hillary Clinton was fired from a job for being unethical.Only Hillary Clinton deleted 33 thousand emails after she was ordered to hand them over to the FBI.Only Hillary Clinton had that same computer wiped clean by professionals.Only Hillary Clinton got the 42 year old rapist of a 12 year old girl off on rape charges. Hillary then laughed about it on the news.

Trump did not increase our debt to $20 trillion.3. Trump did not ruin our credit.4. Trump did not double African-American unemployment.5. Trump did not send out healthcare costs skyrocketing and the average is now $660 a month5. Trump did not increase welfare to a record level for eight solid years.6. Trump did not sign a law making it legal to execute and imprison Americans without due process. 7. Trump did not set free all the terrorists in Guantanamo Bay to return to the field of battle. 8.

The Obama/Clinton cult have illegally occupied our government and swiped our future and that of our progeny.Hillary has had 30 years in office to make America great again, what makes you think she will turn on a light this time? American needs real change and the wealthy Billionaire Tycoon will be way better in office than a crooked Hillary Lawyer! (Liar)But you are going to vote for her because.... you don't like Donald Trump ? That is insane !I will never understand how any moral person in good conscience could vote for this woman.Clinton wants to attack Russia and start WWIII and Donald Trump wants to be friends with Putin and together Russia and the US can defeat ISIS! Trump and Putin will have a Presidential steak dinner just like Obama and Trudeau had!For Trump to build the US/Mexico wall to keep out illegal aliens from Mexico, Philippines, and South America, what is wrong with that?If people want to immigrate to the US, do it legally! For Trump to make immigration tougher, that will only make American safer. The recent NY bomber was born in Afghanistan and moved here at a very young age. Everyone got along with this sleeper Muslim all through school in the US, and then he builds and blows off several pressure cooker bombs, so who knows who is going to attack the US next?  Trump will tighten Immigration!CNN is bias towards crooked Hillary, and should not be allowed to air their bias "Debate Night in America" as this sways voters to vote for Hillary Clinton. Be Smart, vote for Trump!

11 | Vern Vartdal | 1326185977477651_1326203730809209 | (1) Trump is a liar.  (2) Trump is a puppet. (3) Trump is a grade school bully (I know you are but what am I?). (4) Trump has no idea that Russians are doing the killing in Aleppo.  (5) Does it matter?  Trump has run the worst campaign since we have been alive and he's going down in flames...
12 | Chuck Yohe | 1326185977477651_1326227430806839 | Funny... Trump doesn't pay taxes "because it's ok according to the tax code" and he's smart but Hillary is beating the pants off him, fair and square, by using his own words against him and she's a cheating (nasty woman)... double standard, much?
13 | Al Sorenson | 1326185977477651_1326231280806454 | How about the treason that Hillary committed during last nights debate talking about our nuclear warheads that it takes four minutes to launch them that's top-secret information.. everyone is bashing trump this and that.. wake up people.. if Hillary is comfortable giving up top-secret information as she did in the final debate makes me wonder what information was bleached and covered up in the 33,000 emails she destroyed.

15 | Ida Warren | 1326185977477651_1326199917476257 | From the comments, it appears that  Fox followers have now flocked to their spokesman, Joe Scarborough, to hear theirtalking points screamed out in a rant. Way to go MSNBC!

We can't even trust the media, they're working to manipulate the American public and push democrat party government propaganda.Hillary is corrupt and all she does is put a spin on questions she asked with out answering or being forced to answer.

20 | William DeCoster | 1326185977477651_1326192477477001 | The Clinton Foundation Got Rich off Poor Haitians by filtering money through Haiti and back to itself. In January 2015 a group of Haitians surrounded the New York offices of the Clinton Foundation. They chanted slogans, accusing Bill and Hillary Clinton of having robbed them of “billions of dollars.” Two months later, the Haitians accused the Clintons of duplicity, malfeasance, and theft. And in May 2015, outside New York’s Cipriani, where Bill Clinton received an award and collected a $500,000 check for his foundation. “Clinton, where’s the money?” the Haitian signs read. “In whose pockets?” Said Dhoud Andre of the Commission Against Dictatorship, “We are telling the world of the crimes that Bill and Hillary Clinton are responsible for in Haiti.” VIDEO ===> https://youtu.be/3c2oBh1yDhc

We fact checked the whole thing. Here's what was true and what was a straight up lie.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | C Burton Hannum | 1326101660819416_1326127454150170 | Let's face it, after a year of listening to Trump's incomplete rants, denials, threats, brags and false statements it was refreshing to watch Hillary school him hard in real politics. There were times during the debate where one could actually see the glint of Trump's tinfoil hat under his smoldering wig. Frankly, she had his number and so now do Americans.
2 | Minnie Shopshire Taylor | 1326101660819416_1326124530817129 | What the Trump supporters don't seem to realize is that Donald Trump doesn't give a crap about them. They are just pawns being used by a narcissistic buffoon.
3 | Diana Cox | 1326101660819416_1326144304148485 | I am on my knees thanking god this morning. I now am assured that this nightmare will be over on nov 8. Trump and his band of Nazis can start their tv network and he can be on 24/7...all trump all day every day and no one has to listen. I pray that the FBI etc continue to investigate him for any anti American activites and that he loses the case against trump U. I pity Eric and Don Jr as they are flawed men in the mold of their father.
4 | Tony Ross | 1326101660819416_1326138170815765 | Joe Scarborough just went off,on his guest Harold Ford Jr,just because he said,Hillary Clinton won the debate last night lol, she did Joe. i'm voting for Hillary Clinton for president, NEVER Racist Donald Trump,hes unfit to be president.
5 | Crystal Hammond | 1326101660819416_1326113444151571 | NBC can't even be bothered to report the news. Why would anyone be bothered to believe their 'fact check'? Besides the FACT that they are lying right to your face. Fact check.. Lol. You couldn't fact check the definition of integrity with a dictionary in front of your faces.
6 | Gary Basham | 1326101660819416_1326129207483328 | These comments are hilarious. Trump supporters believe that since Trump lied more, the media is biased. The media didn't make him lie. He did that.
7 | Chris Peckham | 1326101660819416_1326121567484092 | What has America come to, where nearly half her citizens are willing to vote for the presidential candidate that is willing to kill babies in the ninth month of pregnancy.  Hillary admitted this in the 3rd debate and will appoint Supreme Court justices that agree with her. And of these voters the ones that say they're Christians, how can you sit in Gods house, and say you're Christian, and think killing babies in the ninth month of pregnancy is OK. You should be ashamed of yourself.
8 | Brian Herring | 1326101660819416_1326137500815832 | This list shows the true Hypocrisy and Lies of the Liberal Media and how they lean heavily in favor of the Liberal Party.It's Sad!We are in for some really hard times if Clinton is made President.
9 | Jon Ricco | 1326101660819416_1326131864149729 | Trump stepped on an ant accidentally 13 yrs ago..leaving his Las Vegas Chinese steel constructed hotel..MSNBC reports the Ant stepped forward for a 3 minute interview
10 | Mark Alderson | 1326101660819416_1326146210814961 | Msnbc  you people are so one-sided Hillary lost last two debates but yet you put her above the country she's afraid of Russia she's afraid of China and she would  sale any of us out to make a buck including you people
11 | Sharon Werner | 1326101660819416_1326148097481439 | Why was he allowed to ignore the question on social security. He went into repealing obamacare. Wallace should have made him answer. Trump does not have a clue when it comes to issues
12 | Cindy Clark | 1326101660819416_1326170507479198 | I don't trust MSNBC to 'fact check' anything, considering they clearly support Clinton. Biased checks just don't cut it. Trump spoke to Americans - Clinton spoke for herself & her own needs.
13 | Patricia Hensley | 1326101660819416_1326161577480091 | That's exactly what's wrong with you democrats that is voting for Hillary i  have looked at both sides and and I'm telling you Russia did not hack the dnc just like Hillary hired those people to start fights at Trumps rallies you wouldn't believe the truth if it punched you in the face because you are so brainwashed.
14 | Lou Gordon | 1326101660819416_1326159920813590 | Some people still think he is the real deal and she is a liar. These debates don't really seem to help or change many peoples opinions. They go back to believing what the media has fed them which is mostly inaccurate or deceptive info on both of them.
15 | Jamie L. Petrone | 1326101660819416_1326140137482235 | The media is against Trump but our soldiers and police are for him.. what does that say alone? Leaving our boarders open is a very dangerous thing. Not saying all immigrants are bad people. Some come here because of their own countries wars etc. But the bad one's ARE bringing drugs into such as heroin! Not to mention terrorist and Isis. If you're okay with all that then yeah vote Killary. The only reason she is letting them in is for their votes. She doesn't care about America. She's already financially set. That and all the money her and Bill stole from the Clinton foundation. Trump is a womanizer! So what? What man isn't? He has money and he uses that to his advantage as did Bill. Just like a rockstar and all their groupies. Now whoever he may of had relations with which I'm sure was consented are being blamed for as he "forced himself on these women " did you ever think that maybe they just wanted their 5 minutes of fame???? Please do your homework on Killary before you consider voting for this evil broad. Vote 3rd party if you'reagainst Trump so bad. She will not bring any good to America I can almost guarantee it
16 | Edward Darden | 1326101660819416_1326183204144595 | Joe Scarborough is clouding the air by parsing Trump's words. Joe wants us to do what Trump told us to do, namely, don't expect a straight answer and wait until election night for Trump to "keep us in suspense." Why should America give Trump the power to determine whether he will behave with patriotism? It is true that he can do as he pleases but he must take responsibility for his recklessness.
17 | Kerry Ann Troville | 1326101660819416_1326141824148733 | You folks seem highly intelligent enough, did it ever occur to you all that this whole presidency was rigged by Hillary and Donald themselves  for you to VOTE HILLARY IN. You all seem to fo get during her 30 years in government office, Hillary Donald, Bill and any wife Don had at the time were and are best friends. They have been seen countless times in various government social events parties and family  get togethers. This is not made up or a theory. Go RESEARCH yourselves the countless images and social parties and government get togethers they have been. Also.keep in mind Chelsea and Dons daughter are best friends who grew up together while parents were in the white house and current today. Again fox in sheep clothing.
18 | Dennis Presley | 1326101660819416_1326204354142480 | I don't understand how people can follow your network. I don't like either of these candidates. But this network along with its partner NBC, CNN have given hundreds of thousands of dollars to Clinton's campaign. Wake up people. Do your own research and do t rely on these clowns. Their goal is to spin it toward their candidate.
19 | Amy Miller | 1326101660819416_1326203070809275 | I was asked if I wanted a abortion when I was pregnant with my son because he had a chance of having cystic fibrous n I was a carrier we had no clue what the chances were but I took a chance with my son. I personally would never abort my baby at any part of my pregnancy. If he would die after he is born that would be in gods hands not mine.
20 | Angela R. Sills | 1326101660819416_1326196037476645 | Folks, Trump is saying what we as Americans want to say, but of course can't because we will be labeled "racist" or whatever else they call us! Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, as it is suppose to be, but Trump/Pence will get my vote!! People please vote and if you don't just keep your opinions to yourselves!!
21 | Steve Schiestel | 1326101660819416_1326233207472928 | Can we just accept that MSNBC is not a news source but in fact just a democratic spin machine that has clearly been bought and paid for.    I trust your reports less than I trust Mexican water.  I get the same gut feeling from both.
22 | Harry Mollineaux | 1326101660819416_1326155560814026 | Why is no one alarmed at Trump's response to entitlements? Hillary responded with fact's on what she would do to make medicare and social security more solvent. Trump's answer on how he would solve these issues are the following. His answer to how he would fix medicare, obamacare is a total failure, and he will replace it with something. On social security his answer was nothing!!!!! He didn't say one word on how he would improve it, not one word!!! This is the number one concern for a lot of americans and his answer was NO ANSWER!!! He had an answer for his buddy Putin, an answer for the woman who accused him of sexual assault, an answer for his wall, which will never happen, but not one syllable about Social security! This was the last nail in his political coffin!!! Thank Got!!
23 | Precious Mixon | 1326101660819416_1326128370816745 | We have all these thousands of Veterans in this country that are homeless, no health care, etc. Treated as if they are from a 3rd world country . When they are the ones that shouldn't have to worry about healthcare, and where they will lay their head to sleep tonight, if their family will have food and warm clothes. But Nooooo!!! Give it to all these illegal aliens and  immigrants that have done nothing for this country but help bring it down. Look out for those destroying our country before you do those that fought, and sacrificed everything they had for this country. So you can live free. Way to go Hillary !!! You sure aren't the brightest crayon in the box at the crazy house are you !?
24 | Jill M. Gerolmo | 1326101660819416_1326170720812510 | The media, especially MSNBC, is so corrupt and so dirty that you are like a propaganda machine the likes of nazi Germany under Hitler. American people are not as stupid as you think. Democrats are, clearly but there a lot of free thinking Americans who see your treachery.
25 | Tarangi Te | 1326101660819416_727490260761837 | Trump doesn't care about the truth, only in getting elected so he can benefit the wealthy 1% and the largest corporations, whilst whipping up support from the dumbest people, right out of a Southern Pro-slavery Plantation Owners playbook, and like all modern republican candidates

"I will look at it at the time. I'm not looking at anything now," Trump said when asked point blank if he would absolutely accept the results on Election Day.

2 | Donna Copeland | 1326066780822904_1326078100821772 | Hillary Claims Trump is Lying About Abortion; Here’s The BRUTAL TruthOctober 19, 2016 By C.E. During the third and final presidential debate, moderator Chris Wallace brought up abortion and Hillary Clinton was caught in yet another lie. Breitbart reported:At the third presidential debate, Donald Trump spoke of partial-birth abortions ripping babies apart.Fact-Check: TRUEHillary Clinton was very uncomfortable with Donald Trump’s gruesome description of the partial-birth abortion procedure, but Trump was correct. Pro-abortion activists don’t like the term “partial-birth abortion,” preferring the more sanitized medical term “dilation and extraction.” The basic idea behind the procedure is to remove the fetus partially from the womb, where it is most commonly killed by puncturing the skull with scissors or a similar implement.However, there is a “dismemberment abortion” variation on the procedure, which does indeed involve ripping the fetus apart, to reduce the danger to the mother from the hazardous partial-birth abortion procedure.As to how common such procedures are, there is some uncertainty about how often the procedure is used, but 500 to 1,000 per year is often cited as an estimate. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated there are about 10,000 late-term abortions (20 weeks or later) per year, but the vast majority of them are not partial-birth abortions. Clinton went on to reference the life and health of the mother, however, she had no such concern for the life and health of the unborn child.Abortion is rarely done to save the life of the mother, rather, it is the murder of an innocent child who people like Clinton refuse to advocate for.
3 | Sonali Bedre | 1326066780822904_1326087520820830 | Hillaree:"The russians are rigging the election!!!!"10 minutes later.."Its dangerous for donald to say the election is rigged!!!"
4 | Chris Finch | 1326066780822904_1326068897489359 | Too late by then Donny boy....you'll have been relegated to the toilet s-bend of political history by then.....and no one will be taking the slightest notice of your unhinged rants anymore
5 | Carlos Hernandez | 1326066780822904_1326077510821831 | He's done! Never even gave "The" African Americans, bad hombres, or nasty women a second thought they these demographics vote also. AA's, Latinos and Women, belittled by him during the campaign, will belittle him on election day.
6 | David Brandt | 1326066780822904_1326101557486093 | Hey MSNBC our  president has said he won't accept the election results if Trump wins ....when are you going to report on that ??? What a one sided news organization !!!
7 | Jason Counter | 1326066780822904_1326072160822366 | In other words... he'll only accept the results if he wins the election. If Hillary Clinton wins, he'll claim that it was "rigged".
8 | Jamie Borkowski | 1326066780822904_1326080050821577 | Voter fraud is real! Trump was right! The Democrats have had their hands in the cookie jar for 50 yrs! Now they have tapes to prove it!
9 | Julie Pisani | 1326066780822904_1326196507476598 | Those that are using the Al Gore defense won't fly. This is a whole different pond of fish. First off, the election didn't take place yet. Second, Al Gore won the popular vote along with election being so close by a handful of votes. Yes, that should be looked at. And in the end, Al Gore conceded with a wonderful speech.
10 | Yoko Sugata | 1326066780822904_1326088840820698 | Trump is a man child who has no idea what the hell he's talking about. Big fail. I was tortured for 90 minutes listening to his ramblings and every time I wanted to throw up, Hillary brought me back to the world of intelligence. Big win for Hillary last night and all the other debates.
11 | Joe Capone | 1326066780822904_1326266010802981 | I wouldn't except them either.Majority feels he won 2nd and 3rd debate, yet polls show she won.Bernie sanders had way more support then Hillary and she still won..Registered democratic voters who are not even real people getting votes in for Hillary....
12 | Kathy Ingram Byrne | 1326066780822904_1326185287477720 | Understand why Trump would not at this time agree to accept the outcome of the election, things are coming out more and more about Hillary I wouldn't. More than likely it is not the election outcome its the fact he feels he would be supporting a person of questionable and criminal behavior If she wins the election. That shows Trump as being honest and having integrity.
13 | Sam Dixon | 1326066780822904_1326205420809040 | Yes, because nothing says "peaceful transition of power" quite like paying thugs-for-hire to incite violence at an opponent's political rally- and having your friends in the media cover for you until it's exposed on video. 🙄
14 | Molon Labe | 1326066780822904_1326132224149693 | But Rich Noyes at Newsbusters asks where the network was in 2004, when its partner MSNBC, led by Keith Olbermann, was regularly “casting doubt” on that year’s election results, spending “night after night venting loopy left-wing fantasies about how President George W. Bush had supposedly stolen the election from John Kerry.
15 | Larry Denenberg | 1326066780822904_1326217250807857 | Whiny Scarborough, complaining about Gore and the Democrats claims of election manipulation and alluding to the current Trumpie whines. No way. That was close. This will be a home run. I love how the media shakes people up for ratings. One of the reasons Trumpie got his exposure. He's a media creation as much as a GOP creation. The media,too should be ashamed of themselves. Never happen!
16 | Mary Prigel Adcock | 1326066780822904_1326181184144797 | I remember before Obama was elected the first time media covered for days and days that there would be rioting in the streets. The Dems seems to revel in the thought then. Now Hillary is horrified. I also recall the first GOP debate. All the candidates were asked would they accept the outcome of the primary process. All raised raised their hands to say, "Yes," except Donald. All the media and the candidates seemed horrified. So...how many of those candidates followed through with that promise? Bottom line, it's a stupid question, because as Trump said, you truly don't know how you'll react until that moment, and to say anything different is just giving the politically correct answer.
17 | Frankie Russo | 1326066780822904_1326155260814056 | Good that's because he's fighting for America and Americans Trump is not stupid he is smart and he has awoken hundreds of millions of Americans and we all see how the media is operating we will see the fraud,  treason ,manipulation , lies and crimes being committed by the Democrats the White House the Liberals and the media thank you Lord for giving us the trumpet exposing all of the lies corruption fraud manipulation and crimes all you media Outlets are fools to think you could manipulate the American people only a small percentage of Americans on the left can be brainwashed the rest of us have been silent . Not for long. Finally someone comes along and stands up for all the American people and you attack him. If  Donald Trump doesn't become president the media and the left will reap what they sow
18 | Melinda Garcia | 1326066780822904_1326154917480757 | Hillary sending in democrat operatives to cause fights, and disrupt Trump rallies, is a bigger threat to our democracy than Trump saying, I'll look at it in time
19 | Connie Purves | 1326066780822904_1326233027472946 | You Tony are right. I wished you would put that out there to vote on. Joe was his old self, he went crazzzzy on Harold. To bad Harold was speaking for me.
20 | Soni Strohecker Soulagnet | 1326066780822904_1326232864139629 | Oh Rach..how soon you forget things, perhaps "I can't recall" you might have caught from the the Liar...Bill Clinton said the same thing to Gore...and he took, what 3 , 4 months to give it up...Chads...remember. tsk tsk...And I think Obama might have lean toward that also...I will double check my facts on that one...YOU might try doing the same..Oh wait...only Liberal Sheep follow you...
21 | Matanza Cuervo | 1326066780822904_1326067407489508 | He will refuse to accept fraudulent results.. as he should..
22 | Robert Taber | 1326066780822904_1326182814144634 | I don't really understand the issue here, other then more noise as a distraction from Hillary's real agenda. I don't know why he bothered to even say it. He has no choice but to except. What is he going to do, move into the White House anyway ? Let's get away from the small S**t and get down to the facts. Hillary's election is the demise of this country as we know it.
23 | John LaFollette | 1326066780822904_1326201350809447 | I wouldn't accept the results either until we see on election day how much fraud is discovered or not.   That would be kind of stupid to say in advance sure I will accept the results no matter how much cheating, no prob, it's all fine.  Give me a break.  The narratives they make up at these fictional news outlets like MSNBC and CNN belong in fiction drama books for entertainment.  It's closer to poison than it is news.
24 | Brion Griffth | 1326066780822904_1326123970817185 | Just wait until Clinton is president for a year. All this pro Clinton nonsense will go away when she signs the TPP, lowers the corporate tax rate and raises your taxes and goes back on her promises just like olé flandering Bill did. You all will be hating on her like no other. Don't get me wrong Trump is a freggin idiot but wait till she's in office for a year. It seems " moving on" is a constant theme with the Clinton's.
25 | Kevin Henderson Sr. | 1326066780822904_1326176180811964 | The American people will never accept Hillary as president. The emails released from wiki leaks are proof of treason and will be followed up. If she wins she will be impeached.

“John Podesta said you have terrible instinct. Bernie Sanders said you have bad judgment – I agree with both," Donald J. Trump said.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Lincoln Newell | 1326036690825913_1326038074159108 | It will be either Mr. Trumpeter or Mrs. Clinton —> experienced, forward-looking, indomitably determined and eminently sane. Her election alone is what stands between the American nation and the reign of the most unstable, proudly uninformed, psychologically unfit president ever to enter the White House.
2 | Al Shannon | 1326036690825913_1326062020823380 | And Yet, Senator Bernie Sanders is actively campaigning and supporting Hillary Clinton. Sanders said "A Trump presidency is a real danger to the entire world". John Podesta is the chairman to Hillary's campaign and is totally devoted to her candidacy. It only proves that Russia knows nothing about American politics. Hillary makes friends of her enemies. Trump makes enemies of his friends.
3 | Tony Ross | 1326036690825913_1326141157482133 | Joe Scarborough went off on Harold Ford Jr,just because he said Hillary Clinton won the debate last night,she did Joe lol, i'm voting for Hillary Clinton for president,NEVER Racist Donald Trump,hes unfit to be president.
4 | Harlee Jones | 1326036690825913_1326050857491163 | Hillary said she supports babies being killed at the time of their birth. Then said she wanted gun control to protect toddlers. So which is it Liberals ? ...Do you all wanna kill them or protect them?.....Hillary cant make her mind up apparently.
5 | Juliet Habeigh | 1326036690825913_1326149644147951 | So trump thinks he has better instinct and good judgement? After 2decades of unpaid taxes, business bankcruptcy, trump U, groping women etc etc???! He is just a sore loser, instead of answering questions but bombarding his opponent and complaining of a rig election. He looks like a kid loose in a classroom voting.
6 | Kisha Nelson | 1326036690825913_1326210194141896 | She had a great come-back to that comment. Bernie Sanders is actively campaigning for her and he think Trump is the most dangerous man in modern U.S. political history. In other words, he is a bad hombre.
7 | Emmit Penny | 1326036690825913_1326118894151026 | How could you tell. He never answered the questions he was asked. When he was asked about his treatment of women. He said, "Hillary was paying people to come to his rallies and cause fights." When he was asked about his SS and Medicare plans he talked about China. When he was asked about trade he said Hillary was responsible for all the wars that were going on. When the question of her emails came up he said she should go to jail and when he actually had a chance to go after Hillary regarding the answer she gave, but, didn't give about her charity. He totally missed the mark. He called her a, Nasty Woman???? He said Russia was a better country then ours. He insulted our military and refused to concede if he lost. So if he did "hit Clinton on leaked emails" it was totally lost in his frenzy.
8 | Gretch Darone | 1326036690825913_1326144660815116 | I support Trump I do not oppose of anyone supporting Hillary that is their right they see something in her that we don't see and we see something in trump that they don't see that's what makes us different and there's nothing wrong with that just go with your heart and go with your gut and go vote I respect other people's opinions I won't mind respected as well
9 | Eddie Girardi | 1326036690825913_1326053524157563 | I'm suprised MSNBC posted this, good job even though I wish you covered more political candidates and exposed more political corruption and were on the people's side instead of ratings. We deserve unbiased truth. I follow MSNBC because they aren't crazy like CNN. Fox is the only right wing media, it needs some competition to keep them in check.
10 | Gretch Darone | 1326036690825913_1326143760815206 | She does got bad judgement, we have waited 8 years for change gave them the chance and nothing my Chicago has gotten worse our inner cities have gotten worse just my old neighborhood has gotten worse our youth has gotten worse because there's nothing for them to do if they have a lot more jobs and better education out there. I would say different we need change something else better than what we have now I want to see our youth exhale and become great American citizens I want them to have awesome jobs so they can make a family of their own and not have to struggle so bad I don't want them to have to look over their shoulders if someone's going to kill them I won't change just for them
11 | Brenda Gayle Tucker | 1326036690825913_1326066017489647 | Well voters we have heard Hillary & Trump all their debates and Hillary want to secure and save our SS/Medicare fix our infrastructure by having the wealthy pay their fair share of taxes, Trump wants to give the wealthy more tax handouts, voters here is just a few of the $1 trillion 460 billion tax handouts we give to the top every yr, CEO's bonsues $7 billion a yr, Corporate luxury Jets Big Oil $37.5 billion a yr. Big Pharm's $270 billion a yr. Capital Gains $51 billion a yr. Corporate State and Local $80.4 billion a yr. Big Ag. $18 billion a yr. Wall St. $83 billion a yr. export-import banks $112 billion federal contracts for top 200 biggest companies $800 billion a yr. voters these is just a few of the tax handouts we give to the top I think Hillary is right the trickle down tax handouts to the top has not worked the last 30 yrs. it is time to try Hillary plan she will grow the middle class secure our civil right, human rights, women rights, education etc. Trump policies will take us back 50 yrs. !
12 | Ginger Spelts | 1326036690825913_1326055207490728 | Former Boston Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling called Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton “the most despicably corrupt, lying human being to ever run for the office.” Shut out the media hype for the corrupt and just get out and vote on Nov. 8th for #OnlyTrump2016 Time to #DRAINtheSWAMP
13 | Carmen Perryman | 1326036690825913_1326099930819589 | If we started quoting the people who spoke about your instinct #AMNESTDON we would be listing them until next year this time.
14 | Tarangi Te | 1326036690825913_1326268070802775 | You mean Trump-sponsored Russian-altered emails they love releasing to the public themselves whilst holding Hillary Clinton criminally accountable for them being on potentially unsecured servers?
15 | Russell Newman | 1326036690825913_1326142640815318 | Truly, what does it take, to see she would be so bad for this country. To ignore facts over 25 years shows she can't be stop from abusing this country. Your vote is the only thing between light and darkness.
16 | Paulie Roberts | 1326036690825913_1326046720824910 | If Trump is looking in Clinton's emails, I want to see Trump's business emails. I want to see who he has business with. I want to see his business with China and Russia. Oh that is right, he delete his business emails.
17 | Robert A. Murray | 1326036690825913_1326233934139522 | Let me get this straight! Daniel Ellsberg leaks the Pentagon Papers and is celebrated as paragon of morality. Julian Assange exposes documents related to the controversial Iraq War and he is lauded. Now, e-mails....remember Hillary destroyed many of those under her control... whines about the Wiki Leaks that reveal the corruption and inside the beltway shenanigans of the Clinton Campaign and her pant suit gets in an uproar!?
18 | Judson Thomas | 1326036690825913_1326042087492040 | Spider Clinton... No one can spin a lie like her...No one...caught  saying to wall st that she would give one answer to wall st and a different one to the public she said she was talking about Abe Lincoln.. When quoted as saying she wanted open borders and a one world economy she spun it around and said she was talking about energy... SPIDER CLINTON.
19 | Chris Finch | 1326036690825913_1326049714157944 | Can someone please explain to me (I've switched over to fox) why they're completely utterly ignoring his refusal to say he'll accept the result? It's like it never happened.....And they're fawning over his "debate win"Wow.....just wow.....
20 | Judy Kent | 1326036690825913_1326050037491245 | I am outraged I am outraged that Hillary Clinton has hired people to harm American people because they support trump harm them peppersprayed .punch spit assult women children edlerly and man Americans because they will not vote for her you news media make me sick by supporting a women what claims it is a outrage because he said lets wait and see but msnbc supports children women and elderly being harmed what has come out in this debate and you are upset over trump saying lets wait and see there is actual video prove video proof if trump did this you would have this on for weeks you are all sick
21 | Rich Wilfong | 1326036690825913_1326245890804993 | So Trump believes information from an alleged sex offender that is an Australian citizen sought for extradition to Switzerland for a rape charge that is seeking refugee status from France but is holed up in a Ecuador embassy  in the UK while dealing with stolen property that was hacked from American citizens illegally by a foreign government (Russia) that is trying to influence the American election? Sounds like it is right up Trump's alley.
22 | Bill ONeal | 1326036690825913_1326223257473923 | Says it all folks! Her own campaign manager who knows her as well as anyone on the planet doesn't have any faith in her behind closed doors! Why should we?
23 | Shannon Elizabeth Davis | 1326036690825913_1326055627490686 | Not according to his 2008 interview where he said she was a strong leader and should be president lol - he talks out of the side of his mouth. I'm surprised he knows blow Podesta even is - he probably doesn't.. His surrogates fed him that line.
24 | Chris Edmondson | 1326036690825913_1326061180823464 | Donald J. Trump is right about one thing, she shouldn't have even qualified to run for president. She belongs in jail and instead is being placed above the law.
25 | Brion Griffth | 1326036690825913_1326124040817178 | Just wait until Clinton is president for a year.

"What Hillary is saying, in the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby. Now, you can say that that's okay, and Hillary can say that that's okay, but that's not okay with me," Donald J. Trump said.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Pamela Michele | 1325979334164982_1325996257496623 | Ripping a baby out of the womb at 9 months – that's called a c-section, Donald.
2 | Michaela Whitney | 1325979334164982_1326009800828602 | Most states don't allow for late term abortions already. And if they're done it's usually to save a mother's life. (Don't think this sort of thing is a joke, I live with health conditions where there's a chance a pregnancy could kill me) But this man has no idea what he's talking about.
3 | Sharon Lee | 1325979334164982_1325982827497966 | What is really up the nose Donald. That's the biggest hidden question! Why haven't you showed those taxes and don't try to cover up nothing. Will we see them before November. That is the other biggest one. I somehow doubt it. He is hiding something!
4 | Sharon Larson | 1325979334164982_1325999507496298 | Abortions do not happen at nine months. tRump has no idea what he's talking about.
5 | Emmit Penny | 1325979334164982_1326047240824858 | What a moron. If you have to have an abortion at the last trimester its because the life of the mother is in danger or there is something severely wrong with the baby. And, any woman knows you can't just get an abortion four days before giving birth (which he repeated at least five times). In addition to him denigrating women he now has shown his ignorance in how women have children.
6 | Paulie Roberts | 1325979334164982_1325982547497994 | Bad part is that you can not have an abortion like that. If the baby is ready to pop out, you can not kill the baby that way. All a person can do is to give the baby up for adoption.
7 | Clay Acorn | 1325979334164982_1326010400828542 | I don't want to keep thinking like a mean person, Trump rubbed off on a lot of us Democrats, can't wait till he loses so I can go back to being nice to Republicans.
8 | Sharon Lee | 1325979334164982_1326003500829232 | Trump loves to put fear in people! Even children! He is a bully! He knows he is losing. Lose he will! He is running on empty. He will say and do anything and promise anything for a vote!
9 | Norna Cuyler | 1325979334164982_1326031980826384 | The deplorables really beleive what drump said...smh the decision should be between a woman and her Dr. The state has no right to make any decision concerning womens health. Ironically that Louisiana republican senator who was having an affair demanded his mistress get an abortion.  I'm wondering how many women had one behind trump and his deviant sexual acts. I wonder how many racist pricks would haul there daughter off to get an abortion if she got pregnant by a black guy.
10 | Rick Colon | 1325979334164982_1326158540813728 | This is the difference between men and women.. Most of us men don't know how this abortion works .. The difference between most men and Donald Trump is that when we men don't know something we keep our mouths shut and listen and learn but Trump just makes up his own conclusions lol
11 | Marilyn Upchurch | 1325979334164982_1326124477483801 | This is the dumbest debate ever. If you don't agree with abortion, don't have one and stay the hell out of another person's business if they decide to have one. If you care so much about other people's babies, use your energy to foster or adopt one of the very many orphaned children. Some of you are the same ones crying about your taxes being used to provide financial assistance to needy children.
12 | Tina Waters | 1325979334164982_1326079720821610 | So he's completely against cesarean births even if it will save the life of the mother and child. If he is elected and tries to outlaw cesarean births, that will put American society back into the dark ages. Women and children will die needlessly and won't make America great.
13 | Cassidy Primm | 1325979334164982_1326064907489758 | Why'd y'all pick the false claim to quote, MSNBC? Hmmm? Hillary's response will be what's history come November 9th. "I will defend Planned Parenthood. I will defend Roe v. Wade and I will defend women’s rights to make their own health care decisions,” Clinton said on the topic of abortion and a woman’s right to choose.“And we’ve come too far to have that turn back now. Indeed he said women should be punished, that there should be some form of punishment for women who obtain abortions. And I could just not be more opposed to that kind of thinking.”
14 | Holly Mae Guilliams | 1325979334164982_1326055237490725 | Sad.................90% of the people responding to this sound byte don't have a clue .............................. "currently" .. states have regulations on maximum term limits (x amount of weeks) abortions can be performed ..... Queen of corruption Hillary Clinton wants to change that to ........... "no limit" ................. pretty much meaning exactly what Trump said! ...  (now what woman would wait 9 months to abort is beyond me.....however I don't believe in abortions anyway)
15 | Linda Radel | 1325979334164982_1326034354159480 | Donnie Dimwit is obviously totally ignorant on the subject of abortions.  In a late-term abortion babies cannot physically be ripped from a mother's uterus (or womb as he likes to call it!).  To do a pregnancy termination in that manner could very well lead to major hemorrhaging, which might be too severe to stop.  Only in extreme cases, where the mother's life is in serious jeopardy would a late-term abortion be done...and most times a baby born very late in the pregnancy survives.
16 | Donna Copeland | 1325979334164982_1326078150821767 | Hillary Claims Trump is Lying About Abortion; Here’s The BRUTAL TruthOctober 19, 2016 By C.E. During the third and final presidential debate, moderator Chris Wallace brought up abortion and Hillary Clinton was caught in yet another lie. Breitbart reported:At the third presidential debate, Donald Trump spoke of partial-birth abortions ripping babies apart.Fact-Check: TRUEHillary Clinton was very uncomfortable with Donald Trump’s gruesome description of the partial-birth abortion procedure, but Trump was correct. Pro-abortion activists don’t like the term “partial-birth abortion,” preferring the more sanitized medical term “dilation and extraction.” The basic idea behind the procedure is to remove the fetus partially from the womb, where it is most commonly killed by puncturing the skull with scissors or a similar implement.However, there is a “dismemberment abortion” variation on the procedure, which does indeed involve ripping the fetus apart, to reduce the danger to the mother from the hazardous partial-birth abortion procedure.As to how common such procedures are, there is some uncertainty about how often the procedure is used, but 500 to 1,000 per year is often cited as an estimate. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated there are about 10,000 late-term abortions (20 weeks or later) per year, but the vast majority of them are not partial-birth abortions. Clinton went on to reference the life and health of the mother, however, she had no such concern for the life and health of the unborn child.Abortion is rarely done to save the life of the mother, rather, it is the murder of an innocent child who people like Clinton refuse to advocate for.
17 | Emily Van Heukelom | 1325979334164982_1326069620822620 | It's so frustrating because the facts are out there and he just chose to completely ignore them. Late term abortions are not because the woman didn't want the pregnancy. They happen because something is terribly wrong with the fetus or because the woman's life is in danger. And they make up like 1% of abortions.
18 | Tracy Hunt-Hardy | 1325979334164982_1326201664142749 | Coming from a man who clearly doesn't see his children until they are old enough to work. Btw he said he never apologized to his wife. The wife said he did. Probably hasn't talked to her since she got preggo😉
19 | Sheila Crenshaw Johnson | 1325979334164982_1326000207496228 | I'd be willing to bet Donald has ordered more than a few abortions himself.
20 | Gwendolyn Robertson | 1325979334164982_1326174687478780 | Donald, Donald, Donald, such an ugly, crass and deplorable statement! I nearly fell out of my chair and my skin crawled with your stupidity. Tsk, tsk! So uninformed about women's bodies! You don't perform an abortion, for any reason, at 9 months. At nearly full term, it's called a C-section, Donald, to save the baby and/or the mother's life. Perhaps if you were in touch with REALITY, and women's issues in particular, you wouldn't make such an IGNORAMUS statement!!!
21 | Nicholas J Stojakovich | 1325979334164982_1326109974151918 | "A spokesman for Clinton’s campaign told us that she meant that many late-term abortions — not all or even most — are because of medical reasons. But that’s not what she said. Her statement left the impression that the majority, if not all, late-term abortions are medically necessary. The available evidence does not support that assertion........One study that did examine the question of why late-term abortions are sought was published in 2013 in the Guttmacher Institute’s peer-reviewed journal, Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health. That study compared 272 women who had abortions at or after 20 weeks with 169 women who had first-trimester abortions; importantly though, the study specifically excluded any women who sought later-term abortions due to fetal anomaly or maternal life endangerment.The study’s primary finding was that “[i]n many ways, women who had later abortions were similar to those who obtained first-trimester procedures.” It found that those who delayed abortions until later in their pregnancies were more likely to be younger women, those with limited financial resources and those who experienced logistical delays such as the need for extended travel to an abortion provider.Though the study did not include medically necessary late-term abortions, it at least illustrates that there are women receiving abortions after 20 weeks who do so for non-medical reasons."http://www.factcheck.org/2015/09/clinton-off-on-late-term-abortions/
22 | Donna Gatlin | 1325979334164982_1326168380812744 | Kansas had strong abortion laws with an exception on late term, for the health of the mother. A barrel racer, at 6 months, decided having a baby would prevent her from competing, two Drs signed off that her health would be impacted - death of a child. This is one story of to many.
23 | Mary Linderberg | 1325979334164982_1326233504139565 | Note to Hillary -- you can't regulate stupidity regarding toddlers on the 2nd Amendment. That's troglodytes mentality.  How can someone promote gun control under the pretext of saving toddlers yet it's OK to kill babies? The democrat position on abortion is odd since they don't trust the people to make any other substantial decisions on their own.  Hillary Clinton’s claim that partial birth abortion should be protected due to a number of women who have serious health issues is not supported by research.
24 | Janet White | 1325979334164982_1326262994136616 | That's ridiculous. If the baby has died or is born with the brain outside of the skull this is a possible scenario. No one rips a healthy baby out of a womb just to kill it. Another scare tactic by the Trumpette's who know nothing about what they are talking about as usual.
25 | Mabel Schultz | 1325979334164982_1326215307474718 | i am pro-life, and I'm an Independant. This is a very sensitive subject, one that, unless you've had to make this kind of decision, is nobody's business but the family involved.  The government has no right to impose anything on this subject. This decision is between a woman and her family/ higher power and her doctor.  Having said that, to all the horrific comments about the women who choose abortion, for whatever reason, are you all just as willing to make sure that your " village" is ready and prepared to make sure these children are given everything all other children are given? Are you just as willing to take these children's well being to heart, even into teen age years and adult hood, or are you going to toss them aside the first chance you get?   To say you strongly oppose abortion, then go on to say to someone, this world would be better off if he/she had been aborted is a horrible thing to say.  ( there is a comment like that on this subject).

Here are 11 moments that stood out from the final face-off between Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump.
--------------Comments:--------------

I still can not wrap my mind around the fact that out of all the Republicans in the US,  that idiot is the one that made it. When I look at him all I can think, is really that was the strongest swimmer in his dads sac!!!!!!!! If anyone was ever Pro Choice it should have been his mother!!!! Ugh I hate his face!!

Why on earth do you need someone so blatantly biased like Hugh Hewitt?  Are you trying to outdo CNN by out-Coreying Corey?

7 | Jerome B Chlebus | 1325942340835348_1325970234165892 | Hillary Clinton flat out didn’t answer some of the questions posed to her at the final presidential debate Wednesday.On issues from immigration to substantial allegations about the Clinton Foundation, to her view of the Constitution Clinton chose instead to pivot and deflect rather than answer the question. Here are three of those occasions.1. She answered a question about her view on how the Constitution should be interpreted without even mentioning the founding document.“What’s your view on how the Constitution should be interpreted?” debate moderator Chris Wallace asked in the opening question. “Do the founders’ words mean what they say or is it a living document to be applied flexibly according to changing circumstances?”Clinton dodged the question. “I have major disagreements with my opponent about these issues and others that will be before the Supreme Court,” she said. “But I feel that at this point in our country’s history, it is important that we not reverse marriage equality, that we not reverse Roe v. Wade, that we stand up against Citizens United, we stand up for the rights of people in the workplace, that we stand up and basically say: The Supreme Court should represent all of us.”2. Asked to defend allegations of “pay-to-play” arrangements between Clinton Foundation donors and the State Department while she served as Secretary of State, Clinton completely dodged the question.“I’m thrilled to talk about the Clinton Foundation because it is a world renowned charity and I am so proud of the work that it does,” she said, after stating everything she did at State was in the country’s interests. “You know I could talk for the rest of the debate,” she continued, before launching into a spiel about the Clinton Foundation’s charitable work.3. When Wallace confronted Clinton about leaked comments that she wants “open borders,” she again dodged the question entirely.“Is that your dream, open borders?” Wallace asked?“Well, if you went on to read the rest of the sentence, I was talking about energy,” Clinton replied. “You know, we trade more energy with our neighbors than we trade with the rest of the world combined. And I do want us to have an electric grid, an energy system that crosses borders. I think that would be a great benefit to us.”She then launched into an attack on the Wikileaks coverage that led to the leak, by bringing up accusations that Russia is behind the hack and is using it to try to manipulate the election.Trump called Clinton out on this particular dodge. “That was a great pivot off the fact that she wants open borders, OK? How did we get on to Putin?”Follow Rachel on Twitter

Her top adviser/aid is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood. This is an organization determined at creating a Muslim/Islamic (ideology) caliphate though out the world. Christians are being slaughtered around the world. Women and children are being traded in the slave market by these rats. and you can best believe it is happening here already in America.

Watch the moment Donald J. Trump called rival Hillary Clinton "a nasty woman."
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Lisa Gonner | 1325921167504132_1325922157504033 | Let's all get Nasty Woman t-shirts and show that chump just how nasty we can be - we're not going to let him offend or assault women any longer!!
2 | Miguel Romero | 1325921167504132_1325923960837186 | Trump doesn't like strong women. He insults them and calls them names. Him calling Hillary a 'nasty woman' is just another example of his cowardliness and his weakness of being a man. #nevertrump
3 | Bruce Romanish | 1325921167504132_1325922737503975 | Interesting double standard. After all the horrendous things he's said about her this campaign, and the pathetic name calling, she offers one funny and spot on zinger and once again he has to have the last word.
4 | Brandon Still | 1325921167504132_1325922014170714 | Donald J. Trump says Mexico is going to pay for the wall, but when he met with the Mexican president "he choked," Hillary Clinton says. Lol
5 | Howard Landsperger | 1325921167504132_1325924817503767 | Calling Hillary a nasty women was bad but that was nothing compared to his statement that he couldn't promise to accept the results of this election, that is treasonous plane and simple, and any republican party elected official that will not come out and publicity condemn him on this point is in violation of their oath of office to uphold the constitution and they need to be held accountable for it.
6 | John Kelly | 1325921167504132_1325938110835771 | The only thing I think that came out of this debate is it drove home the point further that his temperament is not that of a Presidential person. He still doesn't have solid ideas. I'm sure people who don't like Hillary had justification for that as well but in the end she's the better choice. No one will ever convince me that if Donald Trump was a politician he wouldn't become corrupt. There is nothing in his past that suggest that he would ever be above deceit and corruption. Clearly his business practices give me reason to believe he would be worse.
7 | Daisy Llano | 1325921167504132_1325972230832359 | What he said about Rosie Odonell as well. It is obvious that Trump feels small when confronted with strong women and if they disagree with him, he calls them nasty.
8 | Christine Riley | 1325921167504132_1325934084169507 | But first he said, "Nobody respects women more than me". Then when Hillary started to dispute it, he calls her a nasty woman. Liar liar pants on fire.
9 | Deborah Wilson | 1325921167504132_1325930210836561 | The post.debate.screaming in the background is ridiculous. Why do they have this with live people behind them? I'm going to have to turn it off, it's way too distracting. I'm sure the panel and Chris Matthews feels the same way.
10 | Trip Allen | 1325921167504132_1325939250835657 | Who are the nasty jerk guys yelling with such annoying anger behind the set of Chris Matthews' panel. Get rid of them, please. Call cops on them for disturbing peace. Oh, wait, they're white n privileged.
11 | Jean Grugan | 1325921167504132_1325975370832045 | It is unbelievable that anyone thinks DT has the ability and temperment to be the leader of the free world. If that has not been sufficiently observed before, take a long hard look and listen to the third debate. It will and should be repeated often so anyone who has any doubt can realize what a disaster he has promoted and how frightening the prospect of electing him would be.
12 | Dexter Badger | 1325921167504132_1325942930835289 | I know Donald...she's horrible. She's gonna make you pay your fair share, then put it back in social security. Replacing what Ronnie Reagan stole
13 | Krystal Perez | 1325921167504132_1325937807502468 | Ha, why am I not surprised? I see him, I hear him, and my blood boils. We cannot let a sexist, racist, unknowledgeable, trash-talking, pathetic, inhumane Republican be the face and voice of our country.
14 | Le Defi | 1325921167504132_1326086450820937 | He left aa soon as the debate finished He run like a thief  He was defeated by the lady that he call crooked  she humiliated him with style Go hillary clinton the first American president Congratulations
15 | Mary Gellott | 1325921167504132_1326080507488198 | "No one has more respect for women than me" ....but before the debate is thru, he is spewing this "nasty" insult ....childish, reckless, vindictive.....he just can't help it ...his true nature ALWAYS comes through .......
16 | Jane Eastwood Weisner | 1325921167504132_1325936787502570 | The key word is "woman" Trump reminded every women watching of that time in her life when she was dismissed because she was a woman.
17 | Brenda Ray | 1325921167504132_1326087387487510 | What a (another) misleading and biased headline! He didn't lash out at her but responded to her statement. Why wasn't that printed? I'm a Democrat but you've got to be blind not to see how these media are in the pockets of and tank for Hillary Clinton, and howbtheycare supporting her lies.  Frankly, she should not be running in the first place; and we need to stop there...never mind debating anything about her!
18 | Pam Fontenot | 1325921167504132_1326089490820633 | The silver lining on this is that she's presenting an awesome policy point for her plans on social security at the moment he does this. Social Security often gets way too little notice - just this year the COLA going into 2017 is .3 (point three); 2016's was ZERO. .3 is on average about $2-3 more a month. Rents, food, and medical will exceed in their rising costs that  POINT 3% COLA.Please,  let this clip go far and wide so folks who didn't hear the debate get to hear her proposal. So, in a way, thanks, Donald!#ImWithNastyEdited to correct percentage.
19 | Matt Smith | 1325921167504132_1325924640837118 | Not just a nasty woman, but a pathological liar, one of the most immoral individuals to ever be in politics, a backstabber, and by far one of the most untrustworthy people on the planet.100% Killary Clinton
20 | Arthur Winch | 1325921167504132_1325952034167712 | It's called projection folks....what you are you project onto your opponent!  Nice try Donnie, but we know the truth because we've been paying attention!!
21 | Michael Knock | 1325921167504132_1325941174168798 | Decision Wasn’t About ToddlersHillary Clinton claimed the Heller decision was about toddlers. It was actually about whether a 66-year-old police officer had the right to keep a gun at home.During the final presidential debate on Wednesday night, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton told another unbelievable whopper about the country’s gun laws. In her answer to a question about her views on gun rights, Clinton said she opposed the Supreme Court’s Heller decision, which recognized the constitutional right for individuals to own and carry firearms, because it was about whether toddlers should have guns.Yes, she said that.It’s a lie so absurd that I honestly don’t know where to begin, but I’ll give it a shot: No, the Heller decision was not about toddlers. It had nothing to do with toddlers. Nothing!  It’s no coincidence that the word “toddler” doesn’t appear in either the majority or dissenting opinions in the case. Nor does the word “toddler” appear anywhere in the 110-page transcript of the case’s oral arguments before the Supreme Court. Because the case had absolutely nothing to do with toddlers.
22 | Lamont Lewis | 1325921167504132_1326091890820393 | Yes. Can't imagine him calling Cruz a nasty man. He speaks his mind, but he's not John Wayne or Garry Cooper. There's a difference between speaking your mind and speaking insane. Trump is incapable of of doing that simple feat. And neither can any of his cult supporters. Matters not noe he had his chance and funked it up last night. Hillarys gonna win...
23 | Renee Redden | 1325921167504132_1326173634145552 | You just heard Hillary Clinton on live TV, into a mic she knew was on, explicitly defend, and say point blank that late term / partial birth abortions are ok and that she will appoint Supreme Court justices to ensure that they remain legal. That means that up until the babies due date, the baby is half delivered, kicking and screaming, and its spine is cut or brain punctured and its life is ended. If you're ok with that, you are dead inside.
24 | Enrikê Russêll | 1325921167504132_1325922474170668 | He says he respect women but I am still here waiting to see him respect one... specially one like Hillary Clinton, smarter and better that he will ever be!
25 | Faye Franklin | 1325921167504132_1326110514151864 | That's a sign he had no business in politics!!! He can't speak professional and think the USA is one of his casinos he can roll the dice and say and do what he wants!! He's not a politician by far and his place is the circus or continue to be a corrupt businessman as he is and a complete racist!!!!! Go Hillary!!!!!!!!!!

And he tweeted after that he won the debate. Amazing how delusional one person can be. I really hope the Al Smith dinner is televised tomorrow night.
2 | Ssenabulya Dan | 1325895450840037_1325896220839960 | Poor Pence! Must be hard to have to defend a loser, no wonder Pence dodges questions about Trump or just lies! Sad!

6 | Mary Flora | 1325895450840037_1325904030839179 | I used to think Pence was a fairly reasonable, although extremely ring wing, conservative who really believed in his positions. Not he has sacrificed his integrity for political gain smh

The acoustics of the talking heads could not be worse.These people should fold up their tent and go home of meet in a room with walls. I had to turn it off.
8 | Thames Price | 1325895450840037_1325913540838228 | Hugh Hewitt is a moron trying to spin and defend the garbage DT says. Thought he had finally come to his senses, but now sounds just as delusional as DT.
9 | Heather M. Mellott | 1325895450840037_1325917407504508 | What is worse? Being the devil or making a deal with him? I think Pence is worse in this situation. Also, please tell those college students to keep it down. It's getting ridiculous.
10 | BillandJudy Koontz | 1325895450840037_1325937267502522 | trump has constantly put down the democrats.but he has also ripped into the republican party to.he's trashed Mitch,Paul,and Ted,jeb,rubio and serveral others who are prominent leaders in their party.a lot of it personal.can someone please explain to me how the hell can they support him?
11 | Nathan Aman | 1325895450840037_1325926337503615 | Mike Pence is destroying his future ambitions for president by standing with Trump and keep changing his position to cover for Trump. That is a very bad idea to say the list!
12 | Kimberly Wormdahl Cummings | 1325895450840037_1325914444171471 | You are allowing one of the commentators to rant on and on about the possibility that someone affiliated with the Clinton campaign may have paid people to speak out at Trump rallies and yet you refused to counter that with the fact that Alex Jones was paying people to wear shirts at Democratic rallies saying "Bill Clinton is a rapist". It doesn't get to be one sided and in your effort to be 'balanced' you allow the right to just go crazy with little checks and balances.
13 | Kenny Benally | 1325895450840037_1325927794170136 | I truly feel bad for Pence.  He's shackled to that nut job Republican nominee and he's going down with that sinking ship.  He sounds way more competent and decent than Trump ever could, but Pences' unwavering support of Trump makes me want to ask him "Why?!"
14 | Cary Christian Charlson | 1325895450840037_1325965120833070 | How can you accept election results if you don't know where they've been rigged.. should Trump accepting the election if Hillary wins Texas unanimously???Maybe we should wait and see the results before we pass any judgment
15 | Roofus Ray | 1325895450840037_1325931187503130 | Hillary done went and told another nation secret, during the debate, on live TV: that out response time to a nuke strike is 4 minutes!  And that my friends is called federal prison, the FBI just sent a general to prison today, for the exact thing!
16 | Patty Rasmussen Flierl | 1325895450840037_1325920100837572 | PENCE is a deplorable...HE SUPPORTS this vile, dirty man who just said on National TV that the foundation of our DEMOCRACY - the peaceful transition of power - is something to be TOYED with!  This is UNAMERICAN...PENCE supports him!!!
17 | Jazmin Barton | 1325895450840037_1325915684171347 | You've got to get rid of Hugh Hewitt. The roundtables are great, but when you include him in them, it ruins the entire thing. Replace him with Nicole or Steve or some other reasonable Republican strategist.
18 | Denise Russo Carter | 1325895450840037_1326228020806780 | Look what you got yourself tangled with. A disgusting degenerate, deplorable individual, a moron, a womanizer did I check off all the boxes? No worries you can have nothing to do with him, once. Hilliary is President!
19 | Malo Azizi | 1325895450840037_1325901734172742 | Deplorable 💯 🐖 🐖 Trump is disgrace to America.💩Clueless, No dignity or morals= Trump campaign. 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻Bigot,Lyin,Desperate, we have all heard Trump narcissist, misogyny, white suptremist, thin skinned reactions to bully anyone in his way. A slew of law suits for fraud at Trump Universaty, many bankruptcies ( just take the money & run) , failed marriages. No experience, no plan. Just "believe me", I know more than the military Generals. Trump products all made out of the USA. Don't forget the conspiracy behind everything. Can't wait till this fool disappears into the hole he crawled out of.#NEVERTRUMP
20 | Teri Hendrickson | 1325895450840037_1325933330836249 | Trump has played the media by HIS rules and it is laughable that he is saying that they are against him. He paid for virtually no advertising for most of the campaign capitalizing on the media hanging on every word!
21 | Will Halterman | 1325895450840037_1325923587503890 | After WIKILEAKS dropped the bombshell that Clinton and the DNC rigged the primaries, I don't blame him for not answering. If I had feelings, I'd be upset like the Bernie supporters should be if I wanted a country based on socialism
22 | Joanne Matthew | 1325895450840037_1325917047504544 | Why isn't anyone talking about DT Jr. Being interviewed after the debate and after praising his father for all the great things he's done, this....meaning running for president....is a step down for him? The most important job in the country is a step down for him! How wonderful of him to humble himself and sacrifice his high standards to want to be our president. I don't think he can get any lower than this kind of thinking.
23 | Harlee Jones | 1325895450840037_1325903714172544 | To be fair ....Hillary claimed Obama rigged the primary against her.....Proof exist that she cheated Bernie and Al Gore swears to this day that Bush rigged it on him.....Soooooo you liberals have no right to speak on this one........
24 | Jason Bucklew | 1325895450840037_1325909557505293 | I was undecided until tonight.  I kept an open mind the best I could throughout all this. I think tonight made up my mind.  I'm sorry Mrs. Clinton but you seem to have an axe to grind with Russia and with everything going on in the Middle East, I don't think we can afford to have someone that is so upset with them.  I'm voting for Mr. Trump because of this.  I don't want a war with Russia.
25 | Chrystal Patton | 1325895450840037_1325923590837223 | How in the hell can anyone still have an ounce of faith in Hillary after WikiLeaks exposed her dirty deeds and she acknowledged it as a breech! They are telling the TRUTH!!! The media is rigging this election by flat ignoring telling Hillary supporters what all was found. Please, before you vote for her just go read what all she has done. It's sad she even has a shot at this. Oh and if it's not rigged what the heck happened with Burnie?!

We fact-checked the claims made during Wednesday's debate. Here is what we found.

--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Cathy Siler | 1325859114177004_1325863887509860 | Donald Trump knows there is more coming out on the rigged election through Wiki Leaks this week; that is why he said he will not accept result of the election. Donald’s always one step ahead of the media. Just wait you will see.
2 | Connie Plaisance Sarvis | 1325859114177004_1325867164176199 | So glad he didn't concede,He blew them away!!! Its gonna be headlines, knows how to shake the media <3Wikileaks is proof of corruption and voter fraud on video shows the DNC has been cheating for no telling how many years. (probably 8) dead people are voting, so until something is done... I don't blame him one bit! He's brilliant for the warning if it continues #WOMENFORTRUMP
3 | Tammy Shelton Eskola | 1325859114177004_1325870340842548 | Hillary told multiple lies MSNBC.....why are you not a balanced news organization? No integrity.I feel like we're in a communist country where we are only fed what the elites want us to see. Wake up America.
4 | Charlene Aycock | 1325859114177004_1325883704174545 | Any women who accepts Killary's stand on partial birth abortion, there is something wrong with you! She lied saying to save mother's life, if mother's life becomes in danger in the 7th, 8th, or 9th month they usually do a emergency C section and save both lives!!! All partial birth abortion is about is killing a baby mother decides she no longer wants!!! that babies heart is beating you can hear it, that baby moves, you can feel it, it is just pure murder,  PERIOD. Wake up.
5 | Harry J DiDomenico | 1325859114177004_1325889557507293 | Huge win for Trump tonight! So huge he rattled you idiots! Spin it as you all like but your actions say otherwise! Trump was spot on about you corrupt media people and your actions continue to support him! Besides that Trump destroyed her on points and everything else and even better is we all now know the truth about the violence at Trump rallies etc and just how slimy the Clinton campaign is!
6 | Sherri Gardner Crandall | 1325859114177004_1325875467508702 | It's So disturbing to watch the news media cbs, abc, CNN  who are supposedly unbiased, to be so one sided!! I'm not a trump or Clinton supporter and undecided at this point but it's blatantly obvious they are democratic supporters! I don't believe that the American people can possibly be given an unbiased point of view from any news organization at this point
7 | Eileen Tharp | 1325859114177004_1325904217505827 | Hillary Clinton, wow, abortion on demand, no limitations. Tell me this if the life of the mother of an 8 month fetus is in danger how can they pull a baby out far enough to put a scalpel through its little brain (which is standard practice in partial birth abortions( why can't they go ahead and save the baby. Oh the heck with it, lets just kill all the little babies 8 months, 9 months, after birth. Hillary doesn't care she's a cold hearted monster that's how she has managed to live with a rapist all these years.
8 | Harry J DiDomenico | 1325859114177004_1325904560839126 | Other then you idiots nobody cares about the not accepting the results stuff! Keep spinning! We all remember 2000! It is a non issue and it shows just how bent you people are! Trump played you all like a fiddle with that answer! Lol
9 | Jeffrey Alan Cumbie | 1325859114177004_1325881094174806 | Targeting Trump and standing behind Hillary . . . Yeah, the media isn't corrupt at all . . . Trump was right, this system is rigged, now it's definitely #Trump2016
10 | Jason Santerre | 1325859114177004_1325895754173340 | This is way to funny. 1 "Not so fast" for Hillary and all the rest against Trump. You are not reporters,  your am organization designed to move people towards the direction you want. You are soooo one sided it give reporting a bad name.
11 | Angie Bellows | 1325859114177004_1325860594176856 | Americans are either taken for FOOLS or are actually FOOLS if they don't wake up against this CORRUPT SYSTEM! We have to take our country back from those who lie and profit – while all the hard-working Americans suffer! NO MORE! A vote for Trump is a vote for hope again!  It’s now or never.This election is about whether you prefer globalism or Americanism!  I say AMERICA FIRST!
12 | Danny Smoot | 1325859114177004_1325862830843299 | Hillary thinks it should be legal to abort a child because it has brown eyes or is Mulatto in the 9th month. She is a MONSTER. #NEVERHILLARY
13 | Inge Mueller Morse | 1325859114177004_1325878820841700 | Did anyone notice after the debate Melania came up to him but there were no hugs or kisses exchanged. He shook the boys hands and did air kisses, and kissed Tiffany. I didn't see Ivanka kiss him either. As he was leaving the stage, he took Melania's hand they walked maybe 2 steps and the hand holding was over. Looks like trouble in Trumpland. Look out world.. Mrs Trump 4 is not far away.
14 | Kelly Gregory | 1325859114177004_1325916064171309 | People are being purposely blind with this election. Purposely blind.....there are actual videos of Clinton Campaign cronies plotting riots at Trump rallies, and committing voter fraud. They have countless email documents released, proving Clinton has committed a felony with numerous interviews of her lying about it, and they were so sensitive to our national security, they should have locked her up many years. And not only that but these very emails contain other various schemes and scandals affiliated with Clinton. She failed to answer the plea for help from our American Soldiers and the Ambassador at Benghazi, leading to their demise, and LIED to the mothers of those soldiers! And just tonight....she re-justified (in her mind) the brutal murder of babies in the womb even up to their birth date. Look up how they do late term abortions. What animal could support something like that? Honestly, what animal could support abortion at ANY stage?! IT IS A HUMAN. A complete different set of DNA from the mother at the moment of fertilization. Not some floating tumor. How on earth could anyone justify voting for her?
15 | Neil Johns | 1325859114177004_1325950837501165 | What has she done? I know she was a senator and secretary of state but tell me what she accomplished with those jobs! When she was senator she sponsored or co sponsored over 700 bills. Three passed. Two of the three were the renaming of streets. Please...tell us what she has accomplished. You all seem to be an expert!!
16 | Robert Scheffel | 1325859114177004_1325924050837177 | In every debate and tv add Hillary only talks about helping women and children.... Does she hate men? Why isn't anyone questioning her about men? Does she believe that women need assistance and that women can't do things on their own? I know very powerful successful women...some of them work with Trump at his companies... How many women work at Hillary Clinton companies? Of wait she doesn't have any companies... Whoops why isn't this being reported Fox News
17 | Jermaine Cool | 1325859114177004_1325882990841283 | My Questions is this.. When Trump looses the election for the republicans next month, would he be cheered home by the RNC leadership as a hero or would he be seen as a slug that dragged the party into his most darkest and disadvantaged places  in the history of the party.... #lifeafterloosingDJT
18 | Veelande Momo | 1325859114177004_1325912980838284 | "Once or if Trump ever show his Taxes his supporters will be totally hurt and come to realize how Trump used and lied to them."  "I wouldn't eat a rotten egg unless I know it's good."  Trump is the rotten egg 🍳 Sorry folks.
19 | Harry J DiDomenico | 1325859114177004_1325897194173196 | Anyone else watching these idiots talking like nothing happened? Wow we learned a ton about how terrible Clinton is with the paying for Violence at Trump rallies and these idiots at MSNBC don't think it will cause backlash? That is just the tip of the crap that came out about her!
20 | Margaret-Rose Principato | 1325859114177004_1325884270841155 | What you as NEWS PEOPLE need to do, WHEN Trump loses, is stop ALL coverage on him so that he'll just slink away!!  If you keep FEEDING the MONSTER, he will NEVER go away, and more frightening.....he'll GROW!
21 | Andrew Beverley | 1325859114177004_1325924060837176 | Trump is demanding accountability on all aspects of our democracy. With all this recent evidence of fraud and videos of DNC corruption I applaud his answer of waiting till election day because who knows what might happen. Trump exposing all this is a win for every American!
22 | Constance A Marshall | 1325859114177004_1325865997509649 | C'mon MSNBC I'm sure it would be much easier fact check if you have an option that says, Trump lied, dodged, and made up his own facts"
23 | Kathleen Young | 1325859114177004_1325912740838308 | Very annoying when I tune in to listen to the moderators on theshow and instead have to listen to the sideshow in the background!  Turned it off! One of the most ridiculous ideas ever to broadcast in front of demonstrators!
24 | Cynthia Washburn Saturday | 1325859114177004_1325893490840233 | Hillary made Trump look like the Chump he is. #PutinsChumpTrump She had facts and he had adjectives....... Bigly..... "we're gonna do more better with Mexico..." ~from Trump's superior brain!!! LOL ;D
25 | Bill Breaux | 1325859114177004_1325884457507803 | MEDIA BIAS BEGAN WITH CLINTONS ! ( BILL CLINTON'S TERM IN OFFICE 1993-2001 )  Gallup Polls since 1997 have shown that most Americans do not have confidence in the mass media "to report the news fully, accurately, and fairly". According to Gallup, the American public's trust in the media has generally declined in the first decade and a half of the 21st century. Again according to Ladd, "In the 2008, the portion of Americans expressing 'hardly any' confidence in the press had risen to 45%. A 2004 Chronicle of Higher Education poll found that only 10% of Americans had 'a great deal' of confidence in the 'national news media,'" In 2011, only 44% of those surveyed had "a great deal" or "a fair amount" of trust and confidence in the mass media. In 2013, a 59% majority reported a perception of media bias, with 46% saying mass media was too liberal and 13% saying it was too conservative. The perception of bias was highest among conservatives. According to the poll, 78% of conservatives think the mass media is biased, as compared with 44% of liberals and 50% of moderates. Only about 36% view mass media reporting as "just about right".

6 | Matthew M Watson | 1325857497510499_1325894227506826 | Both of the candidates for President remind me of mighty oak trees. They started out as nuts and have grown very shady over the years. And like old trees that seem strong both have rotten hearts and are hollow at their core!
7 | Aaron Thiel | 1325857497510499_1325859387510310 | Hillary turned into a stuttering mess that couldn't control the volume of her voice. Could you imagine her negotiating with a hostile Putin with WWIII hanging in the balance? Hillary is in over her head and she knows it. This isn't the peaceful world her husband seen during his presidency and it scares the crap out of her.
8 | Cynthia Washburn Saturday | 1325857497510499_1325893584173557 | Hillary made Trump look like the Chump he is. #PutinsChumpTrump She had facts and he had adjectives....... Bigly..... "we're gonna do more better with Mexico..." ~from Trump's superior brain!!! LOL ;D

11 | Desiree Seal | 1325857497510499_1325938600835722 | She is a real piece of work and I would never vote for someone whom thinks it ok to abort a baby right before birth. The only way this should happen is a doctor not an abortion clinic was to perform a dnc, that is not an abortion that is being talked about. I am for a women right but not at that stage you made the choice can't change your mind when that child has a heart and brain now. Sorry it's the sad truth she thinks it's OK. For the simple fact because all the sudden life changed or I found out my child is missing an arm or some other disability. That baby still don't deserve to die. Furthermore she is a proven criminal the code she has broken made her unfit to run for office.
12 | Ben Benson | 1325857497510499_1325890054173910 | The Trump campaign is all about repeating the same lines over and over again. The truth, a half-truth or indifferent. If you say it enough, someone will believe it.
13 | Rich Radley | 1325857497510499_1326234020806180 | 270. That's what it takes to become president. 270 electoral votes. If no candidate gets 270 or more Electoral votes then the House chooses the president from the top 3. That is the way it is. I'm Voting for Jill Stein for 270 reasons
14 | Mississippi Flush | 1325857497510499_1326173140812268 | Hillary gave out classified information last night by telling the whole world that our nuclear response time is 4 minutes. How stupid was that!?! and not a peep from the corrupt news media!
15 | Amy Sue Dury | 1325857497510499_1325920884170827 | Where's fa t checking Hillary? Or what about her giving out the nuclear response time... Yes the system is rigged as Trump has said over and over
16 | Yoko Sugata | 1325857497510499_1326119034151012 | Trump is a man child who has no idea what the hell he's talking about. Big fail. I was tortured for 90 minutes listening to his ramblings and every time I wanted to throw up, Hillary brought me back to the world of intelligence. Big win for Hillary last night and all the other debates.
17 | Dianna Marie | 1325857497510499_1325857944177121 | BOOM! Trump was excellent, confident & won the debate from the minute he spoke. best debate preformance he's had
18 | Jason Fry | 1325857497510499_1325900827506166 | Why would we ever believe US intelligence agencies when they couldn't even do their job and put Hillary in Jail. Also, my two cents on Trump...You think going full pro life is going to win you this, what a moron its 2016 man.

Donald J. Trump refused to say if he will accept the results of the presidential election. Trump surrogates Rudy Giuliani and Kellyanne Conway stood by Trump's "bizarre" debate comment in the Spin room.

1 | Michael L Friend | 1325850677511181_1325851424177773 | Poor Donald, he's having to face the real possibility of losing to a woman on Nov. 8 (a Clinton, no less) and having to admit he has lost something major, for the first time probably in his life, and can't get up the words (or the testicular fortitude) to say he can't concede should he lose election night. He and his family and lackeys keep trotting out that "rigged election" garbage, hoping it will stick.
2 | Sean Lintner | 1325850677511181_1325859070843675 | I would just like to put my opinion in. I find it disrespectful that he wants to say just because things aren't working in his favor that the election is rigged. I live in Fort Myers Florida. I chose to be a poll worker this year for the first time I'm 45 years old. I worked in the primary election. And I was asked to come back for the general election. We knew this was going to be a contentious fight. But I can assure you that everything that I was trained on in Lee County it is not rigged. And I find it appalling did he could take it the easy way out to accuse people good hard-working people of that it's disrespectful to the American public who volunteer their time not to mention Every County in the  United States.
3 | Nathan Iveland | 1325850677511181_1325851327511116 | "Fascism did not rise in the thirties because it was strong, but because democracy was weak." Our sworn inheritance of a democratic system, which is guaranteed by our elections, is under attack by Donald Trump and his fascistic, empty and insupportable rhetoric of "rigged" elections. Every republican politician supporting snifflegrabapuss should be ashamed of themselves and disqualified as an elected representative of the people.
4 | Jessica Madrid-Bautista | 1325850677511181_1325859430843639 | Kelly Anne looks like she's been hit by a truck.  Your knee is bleeding, your hair is a wreck, & you look like your under the influence of something.  You're delusional, sweetie.
5 | Constance A Marshall | 1325850677511181_1325857797510469 | This is a travesty and anyone, I do mean anyone, still supporting this unhinged man for POTUS is too toxic for American values! A must have for election success, its called "Trump Speaks & Tweets", the gift that keeps on giving!
6 | Krystal J. Miranda | 1325850677511181_1325856860843896 | Recall that Hillary Clinton did her college thesis on his writings and Barack Hussein Obama writes about him in his books.How to create a social state by Saul Alinsky:There are 8 levels of control that must be obtained before you are able to create a social state.The first is the most important.1) Healthcare — Control healthcare and you control the people2) Poverty — Increase the Poverty level as high as possible, poor people are easier to control and will not fight back if you are providing everything for them to live.3) Debt — Increase the debt to an unsustainable level. That way you are able to increase taxes, and this will produce more poverty.4) Gun Control — Remove the ability to defend themselves from the Government. That way you are able to create a police state.5) Welfare — Take control of every aspect of their lives (Food, Housing, and Income).6) Education — Take control of what people read and listen to — take control of what children learn in school.7) Religion — Remove the belief in the God from the Government and schools.8) Class Warfare — Divide the people into the wealthy and the poor. This will cause more discontent and it will be easier to take (Tax) the wealthy with the support of the poor.Now, think ...Does any of this sound like what is happening to the United States? The difference is Trump Loves America and Hillary let men die, Voters Remember Benghazi Never Hillary
7 | Donna Haskins | 1325850677511181_1325880284174887 | When I hear Donald Trump speak all I can hear and see is a third-world dictator I cannot believe that someone is actually voting for him we are Americans we live in a free country we believe in our constitution in the Second Amendment we have someone running for president that is against everything what America stands for I know that's the true Americans will stand up I know that I am not the only one and loves this country I may not agree with the laws but I still love this country
8 | Kathi Harrington- Hoops | 1325850677511181_1325857934177122 | Conway better run she looks 30 years older  then she did when she started  working for him. She flip flops about as much as he does .
9 | Mark Guetzka | 1325850677511181_1325858660843716 | MSNBCs post debate discussion on whether Trump will accept losing the  election sounds like a bunch of sniveling kids. Is that the best you can come up with? Just proves what Trump claims is true. The media is biased.
10 | Peggy Mitchell | 1325850677511181_1325914690838113 | The eloquent Charles Blow has a few choice words for Mr. Trump."Donald Trump is constitutionally incapable of processing the idea that wealth is not completely immunizing, that some rules are universally applicable, that common decency is required of more than just “common” folks. He seems genuinely offended that he should be held to the same standards of truth, decorum and even law as those less well off."
11 | Carrie Schwartz | 1325850677511181_1325897370839845 | Big news.... idiots! Your queen bee has sold out America and your going to help her finally sink the ship. The "GOSSIP" you all listen to reminds me of high school days, you waste your brain cells on mush. Hillary Clinton is a criminal! Her foundation is full of pay for play, she is a traitor, do you see what is happening to Europe? Did you know Hillary sold Uranium to Russia? So WHO has ties with Russia? The state department is missing 6 BILLION DOLLARS, do you know how many homeless people that could help, or maybe help a veteran or build up our weapons? Did you know the Clinton's ripped off the Haitian people? Yep, they flew over there after the earthquake promising to raise money to rebuild, have you seen what they did with the Billions of dollars they raised? Hardly anything! She also was caught selling property rights to Syria, property of the Haitian people, remember Watergate? How about the thousands upon thousands of people in countries like Iraq, Iran, Syria all left in rubbles. What they have commuted is war crimes yet you are so foolish to spend your energy on the trash the news media feeds you.
12 | Aaron Davison | 1325850677511181_1325872214175694 | You people are brain dead ! The DNC has been caught twice this year with voter interference. Why would anyone believe they are done being bad actors ? They are falling into the same corrupt ways as the Clinton's and you all lap up this crap media outlook. Something has to be changed to prevent either parties from doing the things the DNC has done during the Clinton campaign.
13 | Anne Valerie | 1325850677511181_1325892144173701 | Bizarre?U love to put your spin on things.It probably meant he knows he should win..if he doesnt...considering all the voter fraud and corruption hildabeast has going on...he would want to investigate into it before hand.But don't worry..he's not losing.
14 | James Parsons | 1325850677511181_1325895697506679 | Well played Mr. Trump... He managed to stop all the bad press he was getting as of late by one sentence... Not abiding by the results of the election if he loses... Keep them in suspence...... Did he lose?? Well played... Squirrel........... And doesnt Hombre mean Man or Dude???
15 | Donna Tolbert | 1325850677511181_1325866304176285 | Hillary is a career politician... bought and paid for! Trump loves America, no one can buy him! He is bringing all the corruption to light!  If he doesn't become president that's ok he gave it is all .He woke up America to the corruption going on. Now It's all out in the open now we can all make do with whatever we want with it. He has my vote.

No we are not perfect but all Rose gardens got thorns and The USA is Great already . The garden has to continue to get gardeners who wants all the people to have a fulfilling life who wants it. Don't you love your country and your democracy we are victors.
17 | Charla Ellis | 1325850677511181_1325866004176315 | MEDIA! Do not be intimidated by Trump's statement that YOU guys are biased and Pence saying he was sure the MEDIA would be more fair from now on to the end of the election????!!!!  If there was any rigging,it was the fact that TRUMP was covered  constantly through "free" media interviews which clearly helped him become the candidate.... You guys could even remind him of that. Keep in the open his outrageous refusal and his calling people to be vigilant.
18 | William H Kien | 1325850677511181_1325944407501808 | Donald Trump answers the question: What is 2+2?"I have to say a lot of people have been asking this question. No, really. A lot of people come up to me and they ask me. They say, "What's 2+2"? And I tell them look, we know what 2+2 is. We've had almost eight years of the worst kind of math you can imagine. Oh my god, I can't believe it. Addition and subtraction of the 1s the 2s and the 3s. Its terrible. Its just terrible. Look, if you want to know what 2+2 is, do you want to know what 2+2 is? I'll tell you.First of all the number 2, by the way I love the number 2. It's probably my favorite number, no it is my favorite number. You know what, it's probably more like the number two but with a lot of zeros behind it. A lot. If I'm being honest, I mean, if I'm being honest. I like a lot of zeros. Except for Marco Rubio, now he's a zero that I don't like. Though, I probably shouldn't say that. He's a nice guy but he's like, "10101000101", on and on, like that. He's like a computer! You know what I mean? He's like a computer. I don't know. I mean, you know.So, we have all these numbers and we can add them and subtract them and add them. TIMES them even. Did you know that? We can times them OR divide them, they don't tell you that, and I'll tell you, no one is better at the order of operations than me. You wouldn't believe it. That I can tell you. So, we're gonna be the best on 2+2, believe me. OK? Alright. Thank you."No I did not write this, its a share of a share of share, I don't take any credit but I thought it was to hilarious that it deserved to be reshared.
19 | Barry Rucker | 1325850677511181_1325877600841822 | I guess I am a bad democrat. I held the same job for 34 years, I have 20 years of military service, I have 2 college degrees, and I think for myself. My job of 34 years is now in Mexico thanks to Bill Clinton and  NAFTA.
20 | Krystal J. Miranda | 1325850677511181_1325856577510591 | Wow Donald trump did not lie and bypass this questions , omg shoot him he didn't lie to the American people , it would have helped him to lie but he didn't . I love this
21 | Michele Lazarow | 1325850677511181_1325910977505151 | Please do not have anymore post-debate discussions near college campuses. I cannot hear the discussion over the idiots screaming in the background. It was so annoying I had to put on CNN.
22 | Deborah Heckbert Lima | 1325850677511181_1325862034176712 | About The Rigged election , hats off to Marco Rubio. But is it a little too late.More Republicans have to come out and say this election is not rigged. Every single time this man gets put down every single time he acts like a child and says childish things. He then comes out and blames everything on everybody else. Including his victims. You don't need to be a rocket scientist to realize what this man is doing. This is going to be a landslide for the Democrats I have predicted this since day one and it will go down ballot this man is done at least for this election. I could see changes that we need but it needs to be somebody else this man is off the charts it's not normal and no matter how they try and make it seem normal it is not normal, it's only a diversion off of issues like his taxes and sexual assaults
23 | Damon Philip Jones | 1325850677511181_1325908000838782 | So the first  awnser rendered by DT would have you believe he is a strict constitutionalist " the way it was meant to be" EXCEPT, when it comes down to the presidential electoral process, on that part of the constitution, he'll keep us " in suspense" . I believe he's been hanging out with PUTIN too much. If you like Russia so much move there !
24 | Neil Johns | 1325850677511181_1325951034167812 | What has she done? I know she was a senator and secretary of state but tell me what she accomplished with those jobs! When she was senator she sponsored or co sponsored over 700 bills. Three passed. Two of the three were the renaming of streets. Please...tell us what she has accomplished. You all seem to be an expert!!
25 | Karla Jean Garcia | 1325850677511181_1325935170836065 | I think many of us ,not just Trump will not be willing to accept if he loses after seeing the O'Keefe videos released yesterday. Those videos show the depth of corruption in the Democratic Party and just how low they have sunk! If those videos hadn't been released Trump and  his supporters would have most likely accepted it if he lost. But they were released and something needs to be done about this.

4 | Jeannette Boe | 1325850367511212_1325878254175090 | Trump once again defended Putin when it came to hacking. I do believe Trump owes the Russian oligarchs money. I believe he is indebt to them.

6 | Kenneth Brown | 1325850367511212_1326164947479754 | During tonight’s debate, Donald Trump said that he doesn’t know Russian Federation dictator Vladimir Putin. But that’s not true- here’s a video of him saying the exact opposite.Donald Trump admitted that he does in fact have a relationship with Vladimir Putin, in newly surfaced a 2013 video which asked very specifically about his relationship to the Russian strongman. The Republican nominee then said that he has a relationship with Putin – twice, and with emphasis – then proceeded to trash President Obama, while undeniably praising Russia’s President as “very brilliant” for his handling of Syria, and praising Putin’s leadership. Trump’s statement below does not appear on Mother Jones Magazine’s October 5th, comprehensive timeline of the Trumps in Russia.The interview was conducted by Thomas Roberts of MSNBC in Russia in 2013 in an effort to promote the Miss Universe Pageant, which Trump owned at the time and was hosting in Moscow at Crocus City Hall. “Do you have a relationship with Vladimir Putin? A conversational relationship or anything that you feel you have sway or influence over his government?”The rest is a transcript of Donald Trump’s 57 seconds long answer author’s emphasis in italics:“I do have a relationship.”“Annnnd, Ahh-ee can tell you that he’s very interested in what we’re doing here today. He’s probably very interested in what you and I are saying today, and he’s going to be seeing it in some form.”“But I do have a relationship with him.”“And, uh I think it’s very interesting to see what’s happened. I mean look. He’s done very brilliant job, in terms of what he represents, and who he’s representing.”“If you look at what he’s done with Syria.”“If you look at so many of the different things, he has really eaten our President’s lunch.  Let’s not kid ourselves.”“He’s done an amazing job. He’s put himself, really as a lot of people would really as a lot of people would say, he’s put himself in the forefront as a leader, in a very short period of time.”“Now in all fairness to Obama, I think that he’s done the same thing with Bush, with President Bush.”“I think that Putin has done an amazing job with showing leadership that our people have not been able to match.”More supplemental material, including video of Donald Trump Jr. talking about his “many many trips” to Russia and more from the Democratic Coalition Against Trump‘s research is below this video:Russia’s economy is heavily dependent on the price of oil, which was still high then and has plummeted since, sending Moscow into a sea of deficit spending that lasts to this day. In 2013 the price of oil was traded firmly in the $100 per barrel range, and it has plummeted 50% in recent years. Trump’s praise of Putin should be tempered with the knowledge that he runs a Russian petro-state.We always knew that Donald Trump had a vodka brand – that failed – and it was in fact in Russia. We even accept the claim at face value, that the Trumps did tell the truth about selling some luxury real estate to Russian companies and buyers – not lightly, but it’s simply known in the real estate market that these buyers do exist. But the Trump family ties go far deeper than they’ve led us to believe, and there’s more video to prove it.
7 | Wise George | 1325850367511212_1325924600837122 | I don't think Hillary or Obama are respected around the world. They I believe are blamed for many problems throughout the world. Trump is not with Putin and is not a puppet for Washington or the Media. Stand strong Americans and vote Trump/Pence we all need your support.

Yeah right, the white people I see still have their good jobs, didn't lose their homes, in fact, have been able to sell them when that wasn't even a thought in 2008, still go on vacations, aren't riding buses and walking because they have no choice, own their vehicles, often more than one, and are still able to send their children to college. GTFOH crying broke, especially when all your retirement is based on Wall Street, which has had record highs! GTFOH
10 | Nancy Medley | 1325850367511212_1325918360837746 | I'm still stuck on his late term abortion statement. First, late term abortions are only done when BOTH the mother and child will die if the pregnancy continues. This RARELY happens. No one is simply ripping out VIABLE babies from their mothers womb and killing them. Most abortions are performed in the first 8-10 weeks of gestation. When a woman has an abortion she is first counseled about her options. She will also be given birth control to prevent pregnancy in the future.

23 | Tony Ross | 1325850367511212_1325895770840005 | Hillary Clinton on the debate tonight,for the third time in a row, i'm with Hillary Clinton for president, NEVER Racist Donald Trump,hes unfit to be president.
24 | Doug Burris | 1325850367511212_1325854277510821 | When you are bought and paid for by Wall Street banks and foreign governments, you are likely the puppet.
25 | Amber Preston | 1325850367511212_1325856407510608 | Donald Trump is a jealous troublemaker and he's a danger to this country. He is going to raise hell if he loses the election. His supporters too

"I will look at it at the time. I'm not looking at anything now," Donald J. Trump  said during the final presidential debate.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Lisa Borrelli Regal | 1325845924178323_1325847054178210 | A presidential nominee for the United States of America that Openly supports Putin and says he will Not accept the democratic process of the elections... Let that sink in
2 | Jamie Lawenda | 1325845924178323_1325847610844821 | that is just unacceptable.the premise of democracy is that it is the will of the people who is elected president -itsnot up to donald trump to decide if he accepts that. Its the way our government  works.
3 | Brian Carter | 1325845924178323_1325855494177366 | Only a disgraceful candidate like Trump can interrupt his opponent to call her a "nasty woman" and have that be the SECOND most insane thing he said at the debate! He's a complete embarrassment to this country and the republican leadership should not only disavow him tomorrow but apologize for nominating a egotistical, insecure, rascist, sexual predator!
4 | Deb Gee | 1325845924178323_1325848757511373 | He looked like Satan tonight. Tired, mean, bitter. In comparison to Hillary, oh dear the split screen really magnified the difference between the souls of these two.
5 | Kathleen Tebbetts Lewis | 1325845924178323_1325848987511350 | I could not care less whether or not he concedes, as long as he is not the winner!  And I never have to listen to his idiocies ever again.
6 | Thomas Fraley | 1325845924178323_1325851197511129 | Remember Al Gore??Took his loss to Bush all the way to the Supreme Court before he accepted defeat. ..but it's ok for a liberal to do it i guess...Gore conceded then took it back and fought all the way to the Supreme Court...but Trumps a bad guy for saying "we'll see on November 8th??...
7 | Stacy Metzger | 1325845924178323_1325851800844402 | He's basically flipping off the democratic process. Is he considering a coup attempt if he loses? Sadly, I don't think I'd put that past him. His behavior and what he has said indicates he wants a dictator not the president.
8 | Jackie Cunningham-Bell | 1325845924178323_1325902577505991 | Really?? I guess we weren't watching the same debate.    She dodged the missing emails, evaded the question in Haiti and y'all are upset about him not accepting a possible loss?? If the entire media outlets weren't so biased towards him and so in Hillarys corner maybe just maybe we all could be confident in this election  results... Trump over Hillary any day if the week!
9 | Daniel Guyewski | 1325845924178323_1325874037508845 | Dead people have already been found on voter rolls im different states, democrat operatives have been caught on tape admitting that they bus people around the country to illegally vote! Election fraud is already happening so wake up people!
10 | Justin Bowler | 1325845924178323_1325951984167717 | I owe child support and can't get a fishing Liscence how is she aloud to run for president after selling favors, lying to Congress and the FBI, deleting evidence subpoenaed by Congress. Our laws are officially null and void. She should at the very least stand trial and prove her innocence. All these butt hurt I need a safe space whiny people out here that if you have a different opinion your a racist r a bigot these people are trashing America.
11 | Jose Daniel Vargas Torres | 1325845924178323_1326035077492741 | Trump keeps supporting Russia, and other countries. We need someone that supports America and is not a racist pig and knows how to treat women with respect. Trump is the biggest loser. Trump and his supporters should move to Russia, Canada, UK or China. Trump is not a true American and neither is the people that support him. That is very pathetic and I feel sorry for all of his supporters that's an embarrassment for America and everyone else.
12 | Jim Finn | 1325845924178323_1325880304174885 | if you're not looking at anything right now what are you basing your Rigged assertion on? forget your taxes, can you just warn us when the voices inside your head tell you to go Postal?
13 | Pat Feind | 1325845924178323_1325854580844124 | Sounds like the school yard bully fighting against everyone pushing him OFF the school yard. Just can't, and won't, except the fact that others don't like, don't want this on their playground.
14 | Krystal J. Miranda | 1325845924178323_1325859234176992 | Recall that Hillary Clinton did her college thesis on his writings and Barack Hussein Obama writes about him in his books.How to create a social state by Saul Alinsky:There are 8 levels of control that must be obtained before you are able to create a social state.The first is the most important.1) Healthcare — Control healthcare and you control the people2) Poverty — Increase the Poverty level as high as possible, poor people are easier to control and will not fight back if you are providing everything for them to live.3) Debt — Increase the debt to an unsustainable level. That way you are able to increase taxes, and this will produce more poverty.4) Gun Control — Remove the ability to defend themselves from the Government. That way you are able to create a police state.5) Welfare — Take control of every aspect of their lives (Food, Housing, and Income).6) Education — Take control of what people read and listen to — take control of what children learn in school.7) Religion — Remove the belief in the God from the Government and schools.8) Class Warfare — Divide the people into the wealthy and the poor. This will cause more discontent and it will be easier to take (Tax) the wealthy with the support of the poor.Now, think ...Does any of this sound like what is happening to the United States? The difference is Trump Loves America and Hillary let men die, Voters Remember Benghazi Never Hillary
15 | Brandon Adams | 1325845924178323_1325849397511309 | Hey MSNBC why don't you actually prove you aren't bought and paid for and actually say something about Hillary. I've watched your broadcast for an hour and it has been nothing but bashing Trump. God forbid we bring up the many points that Hillary has proved she is a fraud and shouldn't by law be able to run for president
16 | Andrew Beverley | 1325845924178323_1325926044170311 | Trump is demanding accountability on all aspects of our democracy. With all this recent evidence of fraud and videos of DNC corruption I applaud his answer of waiting till election day because who knows what might happen. Trump exposing all this is a win for every American!
17 | Jeff Bartulla | 1325845924178323_1325848184178097 | As he should, the media has become a problem along with the DNC making it a propaganda machine. We as Americans need to take a hard look at what we are allowing to happen and demand the media and a Hillary tell the truth.
18 | Robert Young | 1325845924178323_1325875594175356 | Are we just gonna ignore the sustains of the wiki leaks documents where Hilary said she has a public policy and a private one. Every time it's brought up we discuss where the leaks came from and not the fact of what the leaks do to our so called democracy
19 | Arletha Alexander | 1325845924178323_1325863214176594 | If the system is rigged then they need to go back and look at everyone that's incarcerated and make sure they were not jailed fraudulently!
20 | Ian Pickett | 1325845924178323_1325861064176809 | So. What. If Trump won't accept the results of the election. Trumps a total moron but that whole "tradition" is stupid. IF an election were to be rigged than of course it should be exposed and if a person is a sore loser after a fair and square loss ....who cares?Or did Democrats forget about their hanging chad protest that went on forever? The fact is that any American who truly thinks the system at large including the elections isn't "rigged" not only isn't paying attention but also must not really understand how disenfranchising the electoral college system itself is.Our elections are a joke, just ask all the dead people registered to vote, the countless ballots left uncounted or people like George Soros owning voting machines.
21 | Neil Johns | 1325845924178323_1325952914167624 | What has she done? I know she was a senator and secretary of state but tell me what she accomplished with those jobs! When she was senator she sponsored or co sponsored over 700 bills. Three passed. Two of the three were the renaming of streets. Please...tell us what she has accomplished. You all seem to be an expert!!
22 | Carol Radsprecher | 1325845924178323_1325966210832961 | Trump doesn't seem to realize that we are still a democracy. I suggest someone throw a pail of water on him once Hillary wins, and all of America, and the world, can watch him shrivel up and leave only his alligator shoes.
23 | Curtis Cunningham | 1325845924178323_1325863590843223 | The last debate he said he would except. Nobody in the media wants to show that. Fact checking is what she wants. Plz go check. Google, you tube, news paper archives, and listen to Obama talk about her accomplishments in the last election when she ran against him. Plz people plz do her fact checking. You could be amazed at who she really is.
24 | Patrick Sisti | 1325845924178323_1325895544173361 | Can ya blame the guy? Look what Hillary and the DNC did to Bernie!How many states had problems with voter rolls, downed machines, faulty machines, closed polling stations, etc etc etcAnd how many states flipped back to Bernie after his campaign forced investigations
25 | David Giudice Sr. | 1325845924178323_1325923870837195 | It is an attack on the very spirit of our electoral process. So sad that so many are standing behind this man, the truly "crooked" candidate in this election. What does it say about us?

MSNBC is the place for politics. For the most-up-to-date news from the 2016 trail, check out our elections hub page at decision2016.nbcnews.com.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | David Dingman | 1133503483412569_1133506790078905 | Trump will be our next President. Trump will bring fear to countries like Iran and North Korea because he is that unpredictable right now. That is the kind of President we need in the face of these out-law countries threating humanity..
2 | Maria Panek O'Rourke | 1133503483412569_1133623850067199 | MSNBC is not the place for politics. It is the place for giving free campaign advertising to Clinton and Trump. Sanders should be a part of your "town hall" on Monday night. Otherwise, call it what it is, which is "free campaign commercial for Clinton, our favorite candidate"
3 | David Campbell | 1133503483412569_1135771106519140 | I am very disappointed in the biased coverage of Trump. Everyone of your hosts and reporters condemn Trump for the violence at his rally's. You people have not explored why the protesters show up with the goal to shut Trump down. I don't blame the violence on Trump. You have angry people who are crashing Trump events. How about some balanced reporting (Halley Jackson) instead to finding everyone you can to spout anti-Trump BS.  I don't like Trump, I voted for Bernie! However MSNBC is the organization that is feeding the Anti-Trump rhetoric. If you are truly interested in reporting the truth, stop drawing to conclusions and start looking for the systemic reason for the violence coming to Trump rallys.
4 | Jeff Hepola | 1133503483412569_1135592083203709 | The way you folks have handled this election season is atrocious.  You effectively made Trump the leading candidate by giving him non-stop free coverage.  If Gov. Kasich, who is the best qualified of the GOP candidates, had gotten one quarter of that free coverage, this could be a very different race.  Instead you feed people news on Trump who is catering to the angry, and Sanders who caters to the naive.  Reporters on the ground are doing great work, but back in the studios you are a major disappointment.
5 | Randee Breckenridge | 1133503483412569_1133529706743280 | Why in God's name isn't Bernie Sanders going to be in your town hall? Gotcha running scared huh...you people are ridiculous. Its ok...we don't need you...OBVIOUSLY! Viva la revolution!!!
6 | Robin Friedman | 1133503483412569_1184286111667639 | I watch Andrea Mitchell on her interview with Bernie Sanders today and think she is a total disgrace. She kept whining to him that he didn't he think he was interfering with her being able to go after Trump and he said over and over there are three people running for president and then she would ask another question about Hillary Clinton. If she was interviewing Bernie Sanders why didn't she let Bernie Sanders discuss Bernie Sanders viewpoints. Half of the interview was trying to get him to say he's keeping Clinton from doing a full-out blast on trump. I think she is way past your Prime doesn't ask good questions anymore and it's really boring. And when she comes on MSNBC I turn to CNN. But I'm afraid you've done that to me with a few others by getting rid of the good people on MSNBC.
7 | Sharon Walker | 1133503483412569_1282844978478418 | Where is Joy Reid? She's the only reason I watch MSNBC now. She doesn't pander and I loved how she has her facts and knowledge together. Wow when she actually was able to get Jesse Jackson on air unplanned to answer questions.
8 | James Parker | 1133503483412569_1133521413410776 | lol MSNBC trying to distance itself from their real slogan "Lean Forward" which everyone knows is just another term for Bend Over.
9 | Kat Brumitt | 1133503483412569_1174508122645438 | I have been an avid supporter of ALL of your programing, believing that everyone should have a voice. NO MORE! I disliked the obvious preference shown to "Dumf" by " Morning Joe" and co-host, and the brewha that resulted from it. But accepted that your programming was leading toward preferential treatment of candidates such as both Clinton and "Dumf". Your treatment of obviously slighting of Sanders angered me, but still I watched hoping you would retun to your previous way of unbiased reporting! You did not! Now I have just watched " Morning Joe"s positively disgusting pandering of "Dumf" and his feeble attempt to distract "Dumf" from continuing that vile misogynistic, rant! I will no longer "like" any of your programing and no longer watch my favorite news shows! I also will be encouraging all friends to do the same!
10 | Rob Hendrickson | 1133503483412569_1152809714815279 | I simply can not believe how the hosts of Morning Joe have deteriorated into a cheerleading squad for one of the most reprehensible candidates ever to run for the presidency. Joe, Mika, you have let your viewers down so profoundly, it actually makes me sad. Mika, in particular...you have reached the level of the average Fox News personality. This is going to go very badly for this show when Trump's candidacy implodes, as it inevitably will.
11 | Mike Shea | 1133503483412569_1164709813625269 | Why do you (specifically Morning Joe) continue to hammer Hillary on her release of transcripts from her speeches.  What are you thinking?  Why should she?  There is going to be a general election and she will be the candidtate.  Can you imagine how the Republicans will pick her speech apart word by word and take things out of context to use against her? Are you serious???  Why would she put ammo in the Republican guns? Give me a break.  Let the Repub candidates release their speeches and then she will release her speeches. Just imagine what the MEDIA would do with her transcripts!  What a dumb thing to expect her to do.
12 | David Bourque | 1133503483412569_1156828804413370 | James Carville (spelling) should wake up to the fact that many lifelong Democratic voters are fed up with corrupt politicians of both parties and consider themselves independents. Hillary has been bought and  paid for by greedy corporate America just like the vast majority of the party hierarchy. How can he be so stupid?
13 | Karen Gerardi | 1133503483412569_1153175751440251 | Watching the after debate show on msnbc is like watching the View. Everyone talking over each other, journalists calling statements insane. Journalists are supposed to bring facts to the forefront without intersecting their personal beliefs. Is msnbc in Hillary's pocket?
14 | John Chapman | 1133503483412569_1243495502413366 | Touching speech last night from Bill Clinton (Democrat National Convention) as he reminisces about his "life long walk with Hillary."I am sure it was unintentional, but Bill forgot a few key issues as they walked together down this "path of love."* As a young woman when Hillary worked for one of Arkansas' largest and most prestigious law firms she was terminated due to "unethical practices," which I guess Bill had forgotten.* Along this "love walk" was an never ending string of adulterous affairs perpetrated by Bill, several of whom brought law-suites stretching from his time in Arkansas, Washington DC and New York. His lovely wife Hillary attempted to cover them up, then humiliated and diminished the abused women.* No mention of the numerous (never ending) scandals that faced both Hillary and Bill during his Presidency, including Travel Gate (illegal firing of staff and false statements to investigators), Vince Forster death (illegal removal of documents from his White House office), White Water (illegal accounting practices, costing tax payers $73 million), Craig Livingstone (illegal FBI file leaks), Charlie Trie, John Huang and Johnny Chung (all convicted of finance violations or illegal contributions for the Clinton's), Rose law firm scandal (interference of a Federal investigation), The renting of he White House Lincoln bedroom (for personal gain of financial contributions), Pardon-gate (release of a convicted tax evader who was a major Clinton contributor), The removal of White House furnishings (which embarrassingly the Clinton's were forced to return), upon their departure from the White House, just to name a few.* Monica Lewinsky affair; a 23 year old girl giving our illustrious President oral sex under under his desk in the oval office. Lie's and cover ups abounded.* Impeachment, as a result (I never had sexual relations with that woman) of lying to Federal investigators. Hillary, as usual, downgraded, diminished and humiliated Monica Lewinsky, driving her to thoughts of suicide.* Hillary openly lied about being under sniper fire (with her daughter) at Bosnia airport.* Benghazi; our Ambassador and 3 other Americans were killed due to Secretary Hillary Clinton's negligence and disregard of pleas for help.* E-mail scandal; The FBI concluded that there was neglect on Hillary's part with the use of a private (unauthorized and illegal) e-mail server and with the removal of 30,000 sensitive and/or classified e-mails.* Attorney General Loretta Lynch; meets Bill Clinton on a private plane directly before the FBI comes to an indictment decision on the e-mail scandal.* Speaking fee's reaching into hundreds of thousands of dollars per speech, to groups and governments whereby Hillary would owe favors.* The Clinton Foundation; where did this money come from and what is it used for and how did Bill and Hillary accumulate well over $100 million in personal wealth by being public servants for a lifetime?* More e-mail controversy at the Democrat National Convention regarding "special treatment and favoritism" forcing the DNH head to step down, whereby Hillary immediately hires her for the Clinton campaign.I am certain that Bill just overlooked some of these minor life events as he strolled through his love and admiration for his wife Hillary. After all, these minor details weren't worth mentioning. I lived through each of these episodes and I remember clearly the far reaching consequences of each breach. Is this who America wants to lead the free world? Not me!
15 | Sean D. Huntington | 1133503483412569_1282880605141522 | "We should have taken the oil." After invading a sovereign nation, deposing their leader, dismantling their military and killing countless citizens, our biggest mistake according to Donald Trump was having left without having stolen all of the oil in Iraq, necessitating the occupation of all of the oil fields, with the requirement that they are protected against Iraqi and terrorist attack, which would require establishing permanent bases and a military presence in country, in effect setting up a situation where the US military would never leave. "It used to be to the victor go the spoils" -- and so the Trump foreign policy boils down to invading sovereign nations, stealing their wealth and natural resources and establishing permanent occupying forces to protect the private-sector war profiteers. Make America Great Again! You know, like when America used the military to steal the land, wealth and natural resources of Native Americans.
16 | David Tucker | 1133503483412569_1282929788469937 | Matt Lauer was an amateur in tonight's forum. Maybe you would not have to tell Sec. Clinton to hurry with her answer about ISIS, had you stuck to the topic and not spend ten minutes about emails. And could you go any softer on Trump? NBC and MSNBC are becoming jokes! You know you have little credibility left when liberals like me can barely stomach you these days.
17 | Maria Setterwall Barth | 1133503483412569_1764613497111342 | Are you kidding. The selling of Hillary with very select coverage to favor Establishment. What about Climate Change, clean water crisis. protest in North Dakota, gun discussion, prison reform, trade policies, sales of billion of dollars worth of weapons to Middle East, Veterans' Hospitals, Veterans on the street.etc.
18 | Carrie Walker Ruano | 1133503483412569_1282869018476014 | Matt Lauer was a jerk, he is a Trump supporter, gave Trump the easy question, he could talk as long as he wanted. He rushed Hillary threw every question. Next time get someone who is unbiased!
19 | Don Mackenzie | 1133503483412569_1187531758009741 | Why doesn't MSNBC cover the news on the weekends ?  Every time I turn it on on the weekend they are showing reruns of Caught on Camera or Lockup - is MSNBC a 7 day news channel or are this the firdt sign they are going under ?  It's hard to believe in an election year they can't provide 7 days of news coverage.
20 | Kevin Longworth | 1133503483412569_1767775906795101 | I can't believe the commentary from MSNBC. You are ignoring the most important points made by Sen. Kaine. Trump who is the self described "king of debt" is in debt to China and Russian oligarchs. Kaine put the question out there, would Trump be a president who has American interests first, or his own financial interests?Trump refuses to release his tax returns, hiding this indebtedness information from voters.The other important point Kaine made was that Trump and Pense both called Putin a stronger leader than Obama, but they don't know the difference between a dictator and a leader. In my opinion, these are the key points that disqualify Trump/Pense.
21 | Jon Rosell | 1133503483412569_1174069109356006 | Less repetition.  More in depth, investigative, impartial journalism.  More international and local news, rather than spending 15 different shows endlessly repeating the same top 3 stories to fill a 24 hour news cycle.    Instead, utilize the resources and platform at your disposal in a more responsible manner with a consciously redesigned approach with the sole goal of informing your audience.  Replace the echo chamber with the many crucial stories that get missed or thrown out with the trash on a daily/weekly basis.You already appeal to an educated, more liberal leaning, mind.  Your viewers are seeking understanding of the bigger picture.  They'll stay tuned longer if the same stories weren't repeated every hour; you'll also attract new viewers with stories that they won't be hearing on other networks.  Stick to this model through any initial reflexive opposition and you can build a reputation as the news source for a broader understanding of the issues and one that is binge-worthy rather than cyclical and repetitive. I recommend studying models of journalistic institutions like BBC, NPR, PBS and VICE for examples of how to approach news with the intent to seek wisdom, share knowledge and inform our electorate, rather than chase trends on Twitter.  Our republic's very foundation is damaged and it's future threatened by a lack of an informed and engaged electorate, which in turn depends on diligent, uncensored and impartial journalism.I implore you to apply a public-spirited, chivalrous and long term lens upon your role in our ongoing experiment with democracy; as part of an honest self-evaluation of your current capitalist and reactionary network model, followed by reflection upon the role you wish to play in future history; where boldness is rewarded.  If you are foresighted enough to rearrange the network's priorities; replacing profit with broad, nuanced journalism; you can reintroduce the concept of integrity to cable news, help preserve democracy and decrease political polarization while simultaneously attracting a larger more diverse audience and increasing your revenue and brand prestige in the process.
22 | Gordon James | 1133503483412569_1282859335143649 | I am flabbergasted at the lack of insight and absolutely no comments in respect to Trump's comments regarding Putin. What is going on with the analysts and producers? Matt confronted Trump regarding Putin's policies regarding Russian invasion of Crimea, the Ukrainian quagmire, a potential conflict of enormous proportions, and Russian support of Assad. Trump emphatically defended Putin and repudiated Obama. Lawrence O'Donnel just gave it lip service as I watch this journalistic tragedy of omission. I have never been more disappointed in the analysis of MSNBC-two hours and absolutely no mention of the major disturbing comment of the entire forum. I am moving to CNN< MSNBC is simply not listening> What the hell is going on with you people. If morning Joe does not address this Putin-Trump relationship count me out. Good-bye MSNBC-you have been infiltrated by the right.
23 | Joanie Allen | 1133503483412569_1767549080151117 | I was so offended listening to Joe Scarb-whatever, slamming Hilary this morning, (with Mika hanging her head down knowing it was total crap) sticking up for his buddy Trump, then on the next show Andrea Mitchell (used to be a journalist - I have lost all respect for her!) calling that extreme right wing nut-bag Pence a moderate republican!?! Anti Gay, wants to destroy Social Security, Indiana bathroom laws, climate science & evolution denier, attacking planned parenthood, wants abortion to be banned - there is NOTHING moderate about this guy!
24 | Carin Simmons | 1133503483412569_1282887225140860 | Is anyone on this bloody asinine channel going to bring up the rape of female soldiers? "What did they expect?"  W. T. F.???  You just let those Generals say Trump did a good job and he said NOTHING and thought rape is expected!?
25 | Jo Liggett | 1133503483412569_1175437505885833 | Okay, now seems just the opposite.....Bernie's wife has been on Rachel show 2 times recently, yesterday being latest for her, and now tonight on With All Due Respect, she is on again today.  Haven't seen Hillary, Bill or their daughter on.......MSNBC showing a Bernie bias?  Just the opposite of above comment.

1 | Shay Goldberg | 1540123256007699_1540126716007353 | Donald Trump started off rambling with the very first question about the Constitution and continued his incoherent and disconnected responses often going off topic . . . while losing control.On the other hand, Hillary Clinton remains calm, poised and informed giving well-thought out intelligent answers.
2 | Mark van Kranenburg | 1540123256007699_1540127262673965 | "If she wins, I will absolutely support her." - Trump, 1st debatePoor Donnie is getting afraid he's losing to her in three weeks.
3 | Marcus Thomas | 1540123256007699_1540123656007659 | Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States of America, Hillary Clinton
4 | Ric Winthrop | 1540123256007699_1540131892673502 | Has Trump actually answered any of the questions that Wallace directly asked him....No.   He just asked him about Social Security and Medicare but Trump completely avoided answering the question.  Loser!
5 | Marchelle Crawford Marshall | 1540123256007699_1540151442671547 | TRUMP and the name calling .. "Such a Nasty Woman!  I am So blessed that the men in my life for 52 years (my husband of 32 years) has never spoken to me the way Donald J. Trump speak of women.  I wonder what happens when he and his wife disagree!
6 | Charlene McMillan | 1540123256007699_1540128899340468 | Trump does not want to be a loser and not to a woman. Someone give him a crying towel cause he will need it. Trump is a LOSER!!!
7 | Dean Henry | 1540123256007699_1540131536006871 | If what Trump says is true, Hillary would be the first candidate to try and steal an election from the candidate who is losing.
8 | Lae Ivey | 1540123256007699_1540134656006559 | We're going to make Hillary the next POTUS! He's only whining about the election being rigged cause he's losing... I can't wait for November 8th.. You will be taking the walk of shame!!!!!
9 | CJ Mehus | 1540123256007699_1540135179339840 | Donald doesn't want to be president, he's doing everything he can to lose, he's insulting and embarrassing you! You were ridiculous enough to go along with him and he wants out- back to his jet, golf courses and club houses where he'll never see any of you again.
10 | Beulah Marie | 1540123256007699_1540132226006802 | Hillary is actually the Puppet Master and her strings run throughout Washington. Trump will cut those strings and return control to the American people!!! 🇺🇸👌🏻👍🏻
11 | Matt Ernst | 1540123256007699_1540159582670733 | Chris Wallace has left her off the hook on answering two questions he posed which were never answered. 1. To explain her role in discrediting the victims of her husband (never even broached) & 2. Would she shoot down a Russian plane in her hypothetical no fly zone in Syria.
12 | Gregg Allen Robison Sr. | 1540123256007699_1540160009337357 | So, why is it that the news anchors are so BIAS, that all they can do at the end of the debate is try to slam Trump? Also, he didn't say he wouldn't accept the results of the election, he said, "Let's wait and see".
13 | Greg Solomon | 1540123256007699_1540172299336128 | Screw all of u - every media outlet trashes trump - are u all blind she's just a politician she's going to talk and nothing gets done - Trump Trump Trump!!!!!!!!!
14 | Frank Malfettone | 1540123256007699_1540142472672444 | You know why people don't trust the election process? Because of the biased media working overtime to fill voters with propoganda. 24x7x365 home cooking for the Democratic voters and #wikileaks is confirming what we have been saying. See you Nov 8.
15 | Pat Frasier | 1540123256007699_1540169376003087 | Msnbc is Bias, talk show on Trump and what he said. Msnbc are word flip flopers. There are O'Keefe videos undercover of DNC Campaign rigging and voter fraud. Msnbc is bought and is not for the people. If you know of no rigging or voter fraud, then you all need to quit, this shows you are the worst news chanel if your haven't heard the news or tell it. Haters...
16 | Kathy Lou | 1540123256007699_1540159312670760 | Steve Schmidt just got in the best post debate line...that Trump looked like an old man in the park feeding the squirrels and arguing with himself!   No more calls folks, we have a winner!
17 | Kathleen Winkler | 1540123256007699_1540170179336340 | Thank you Steve Schmidt for clearly explaining how serious it is for our country's peaceful transition of power to be maintained. It is such a relief to hear a rational, sane person after that display of complete Trump insanity.
18 | Dar Win | 1540123256007699_1540127802673911 | For some reason when I hear or see Hillary Clinton, I think of the woman who told Winston Churchill, “If I were your wife I’d put poison in your tea!” in which I feel Churchill's sentiments in his reply, “If I were your husband I’d drink it.”
19 | Karen Eubanks | 1540123256007699_1809221476026028 | Thanks for the moment of clarity after the bucket of crazy Trump's campaign manager unleashed on us. Rachel is a voice of reason and outstanding news reporting. 👍🏻 The only thing Trump won tonight was "most likely to harbor delusional plans to become a dictator"
20 | Emmanuel Prikas | 1540123256007699_1540186099334748 | I cannot believe that one of the most impressive pieces of writing in history, the US constitution & vehicle to peacefully settling the violent appointment of Thomas Jefferson, was just s**t all over by that orange grub. Not accepting defeat is proof that no laws could ever stop this fascist maniac
21 | Jennifer Clawson Murray | 1540123256007699_1540177626002262 | Of course he thinks the election is rigged. Classic Narcissism - it's never my fault. It can't be that I made a mistake. So therefore, it must be the system. It must be someone else's fault.
22 | Gene Jones | 1540123256007699_1540209999332358 | Ladies & Gents that's how you tell lies to the American voters, so they can vote for you! Empty promises just like Obama did it with his free health care! Everyone was fooled about it and now Obamacare is a disaster!HC is another big gov. puppet! She doesn't care about the middle class! She will tax us the most!!!Don't be fooled by another Democrat like Obama did...
23 | Jermaine Cool | 1540123256007699_962185027261331 | My Questions is this.. When Trump looses the election for the republicans next month, would he be cheered home by the RNC leadership as a hero or would he be seen as a slug that dragged the party into his most darkest and disadvantaged places  in the history of the party.... #lifeafterloosingDJT
24 | Isabel Cruz | 1540123256007699_1540168599336498 | Another Donald crafted response to maintain our attention, hold us in suspense, prolong his hold on us like an emotionally burden child not wanting to be "abandoned" by others! The only outcome out of this debate is "ooooh, he will not accept the election results"! He is playing us like a fine fiddle.
25 | Joy Johnston | 1540123256007699_1809224626025713 | Let's all not get too cocky, this election rigging claim Trump and his people are putting out there could be that they are the ones rigging the electoral system through intimidation and manipulation... Trump and his surrogates and supporters will not accept the results even if they are clear Clinton won...... like I have saying for over a year Trump and people want to destroy our democracy of barrier free elections as U.S. citizens plus he wants to obliterate the republican party ....

3 | Sandi Mossa | 1540082496011775_1540099076010117 | He is the bad person here. He just spreads hate and ugliness every time he opens his mouth, unless he is talking a about Russia and Putin! He does love Russian and Putin. No we should not trust him with anything. He is evil.
4 | Andrei Leonard Muresan | 1540082496011775_1540088089344549 | He's a LIAR!!!! Not one word of truth coming out of his mouth this evening!
5 | Tony Ross | 1540082496011775_1540341002652591 | Hillary Clinton won the debate tonight,for the third time, The only reason Donald Trump is saying the election is rigged,hes losing,if he was winning,he'd never say,it's rigged.I'm voting for Hillary Clinton for president, NEVER Racist Donald Trump, hes unfit to be president.
6 | Sonya Louis | 1540082496011775_1540108732675818 | Trump- Immigrants come from Outside the US, meaning they come from the Middle East, Europe, Africa, the Phililphines, etc!!!!!!! Trump not just Mexico has immigrants coming here. Wake up Trump !!! You sound so Stupid Trump, Please go back to College! Thank you Trump for showing us How deep your Drug use is!!!!
7 | Dennis Cisar | 1540082496011775_1540095806010444 | Chicago 3511 shot 608 dead that is what you get when Democrats run things. And wait till ISIS runs free because of her , there will be heads in the streets
8 | Anna Savage Michael | 1540082496011775_1540156749337683 | Don't ya love how she didn't answer to taking millions of dollars from countries like Saudi??  She's a strong proponent for women and gays yet takes millions from countries that support their murder and torture.
9 | Senore Ricardo | 1540082496011775_1540102696009755 | Neither of these 2 people should ever be POTUS ... why didn't The Donald say ... the reason i exported jobs was because I could and so could and all of my competitors thanks to you ... NAFTA ...H1Bs and now TPP... thanks to you and your husband
10 | Aubrey Jackson | 1540082496011775_1540117736008251 | Trump is not suppose to know as much as Hillary, she should have been winning these debates by a land-side, but she has performed horribly.  She can hardly look the camera in the eye.He's hammering her.  Those grins and chuckles come nervously.Lying year after year.  She has to look down to best think of her lie.
11 | Missy Thorpe-Getz | 1540082496011775_1540133069340051 | Hillary should know all about respecting woman...her husband is the poster child of respecting woman..bahahaha!! And her response is to stand by and say nothing!! Boy that helps woman rights. She is worse then her husband! It's sick!
12 | Doris Lair | 1540082496011775_1540097372676954 | Wish some of the open borders and bring in more illegal invaders could see what this has done to border states. Bankrupted our hospital, schools funds used for illegals English-language and 3 meals a day, drugs, robberies, shootings & on & on & on.
13 | Dale Lange | 1540082496011775_1540103059343052 | We have American ground troops fighting in Iraq again. In the past, Obama claimed we had to pull our troops out because they weren't protected by a status of forces agreement. How can he now send troops in without the protection that caused the withdrawal?
14 | Joh VH | 1540082496011775_1540222712664420 | The media is so childish, biased and one-sided for Hillary Clinton whereas everything Trump says is true. And to all EUROPEANS who support Hillary Clinton: You should be ashamed of yourselves! If Hillary will be elected, she will start a WAR with Russia which will mean that Europe will be the piggy in the middle.
15 | Shirley Duggan | 1540082496011775_1540134829339875 | Oh my word he can't answer a question do you hear him not one question did he answer .. He can't he does not know what he is talking about because he never and I mean Never Answers A Question Because He Can't !!
16 | Natalie Cade | 1540082496011775_1540137712672920 | Can someone tell me why Trump thinks immigrants only come from Mexico and the Middle East??? All I can say is we all need to vote this idiot back to Trump Towers!!!!
17 | Steven Wollam | 1540082496011775_1540112529342105 | Trump not only hasn't said anything new but he's also making the same old erroneous accusations by using the same old simple minded generalized language and words.
18 | Neil Johns | 1540082496011775_1540394889313869 | What has she done? I know she was a senator and secretary of state but tell me what she accomplished with those jobs! When she was senator she sponsored or co sponsored over 700 bills. Three passed. Two of the three were the renaming of streets. Please...tell us what she has accomplished. You all seem to be an expert!!
19 | April Mitchell | 1540082496011775_1540644159288942 | The two most outrageous moments of the debate are directly connected. Trump's unprecedented declaration that he may not accept the results of the election and his absolute refusal to put the blame on Putin's Russia for hacking or anything else are both scandalous, but they not separate positions at all.The goal of Putin's propaganda and cyberattacks are to discredit American democracy, to make Americans fear and hate each other and to distrust the very system that makes the United States such a powerful force in the world. This also serves Putin well domestically, where Russian news, all state controlled, is full of announcements about the US election being rigged, despite a total lack of evidence to the contrary. If even America's elections are fake, goes their argument, how can anyone complain about Russia's sham elections?Tonight Trump announced himself loud and clear to be an agent of Putin's goals to destabilize the United States and its democratic process. He constantly repeats Russian propaganda that America is weak and corrupt. Then Trump demonstrated that he is fiercely loyal to Putin, beyond any possible political advantage. These two positions go together. Trump is Putin's stooge and he just confessed to it on stage in Las Vegas.
20 | Evita R. Roque | 1540082496011775_1540189752667716 | "We have some bad, bad people that has to go out of this country" Yes! And you should be the first one to go out stupid! Racist! Depraved!😝Besides a nasty guy calls a woman nasty???🙈 He just had no arguments left and he was clearly so frustrated, lol!😜 Sáquese cochino!😀😀😀😀😀😜😜😜😜😜😜
21 | Al Snook | 1540082496011775_1540224392664252 | Ridiculous , since the first time Dangerous Donald mentioned the Wall, no one has bothered to ask him HOW he was going to build it.He just says he's going to build it and everyone leaves it at that.DD complains constantly about how Hillary gets nothing done. However he never talks about How he'll actually do anything. Strange that.
22 | Ray Smith | 1540082496011775_1540122486007776 | It's like Mike Wallace is interviewing Hillary Clinton and there's a heckler standing on the stage with her! Thank god he cant hold his composure for more than a few minutes, he might have been able to BS his way through this.
23 | OmaryJulieta Elorza | 1540082496011775_1540120266007998 | One of these candidates knows the facts, the stakes and the plans. The other is your uninformed, drunk relative who never, ever shuts up.
24 | Kelly Ray Jackson | 1540082496011775_1540231262663565 | Get real Hillary isn't going to send literally millions of people to college for free and not raise taxes! Wake up ! The middle class WILL pay for it! She is a liar who will say anything to win! Any idiot can do the math on that ridiculous plan!
25 | Karen Myers Jorgenson | 1540082496011775_1540127086007316 | I think if you look closely you can see that Trump is wearing a breathe-right strip that's covered up with make up. It's the only smooth place on his face. That has to be why he's sniffing less tonight.

1 | Geoff Gentel | 1325733330856249_1325737660855816 | And just like that Trump has crashed and burned the third time.
2 | Ryan Parent | 1325733330856249_1325739344188981 | Trump lost this debate ten minutes in. Welcome to the White House President Clinton :) wooooohoooooo
3 | Eric Brian | 1325733330856249_1325742767521972 | MSNBC you are so biased it's not even funny. Why don't you post something about your buddy Hillary that is knocking her. The leaked emails called her out and she switches to Putin. Oh and where is your American Flag pin??
4 | Kimmeth Powell | 1325733330856249_1325747644188151 | he still cant just say he condemns Putin's hacking? No instead its more praise and promises of how close we will be with them - go ahead and look at whats going on with Russia and Syria - Russia isn't doing that much to combat ISIS, they are exploiting the situation to set them selves up, not us. They won't do us any favors.
5 | Donna Gates-Stuber | 1325733330856249_1325755734187342 | She's so desperate going after nothing of importance.  She is so lucky to have the liberal media behind her to cover her corruption and criminal acts. Hopefully the American people are smarter than that.
6 | Shanika Ricketts | 1325733330856249_1325754027520846 | Didn't is Wife said that he apologize to her when the tapes were release! Didn't he just said him didn't even apologize to his wife because it's not true #fact play the Meliana tapes 😀😃😄
7 | Top Dollar Investment Group | 1325733330856249_1325741414188774 | I can not believe Donald Trump is making statements on national news that Russia is expanding their nuclear capability and America is doing nothing. Why would a presidential candidate make such as serious acquisition our nuclear ambitions.... that would be "Top Secret" and should not be discussed..... Unbelievable!
8 | Katie Johnson | 1325733330856249_1325756090853973 | OMG! Trump on the Access Hollywood tape, that he didn't even apologize to his wife because he didn't do anything to apologize for. Melania said to Anderson HE VERY MUCH APOLIGIZED! So is she lying or is he lying? Also Ivanka said he apologized to her as well. HMMMM lying runs deep in that Trump family!
9 | Aubrey Jackson | 1325733330856249_1325750574187858 | Only a bald face liar, like Hillary, can't consistently look into the camera.My grandmother used to say if you lie, you will still.  If you still you will kill.She's been lying all of her life.  She's been stilling since she's been in office.  She was responsible for the killing of the four Americans that died in the 2012 Benghazi attack: Ambassador Chris Stevens, Information Officer Sean Smith, and two CIA operatives, Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods, both former Navy SEALs. Stevens is the first U.S. ambassador killed in an attack since Adolph Dubs was killed in 1979.
10 | Pat Cunningham | 1325733330856249_1325761014186814 | Why does Donald Trump continue to bring up the issue of whether or not Hilary is fit enough to be President. If you look at the split screen she's more poised and articulate. Donald T. is the only one moving around, drinking water, and adjusting his microphone. I am so glad to see this Hilary tonight. She's baiting Donald & he's becoming unhinged all over again.
11 | Craig Halbert | 1325733330856249_1325778154185100 | Hillary is sweating buckets blaming the Russians for her woes centered on the #Wikleaks emails. Clinton is complaining about hacking didn't she store classified documents on her private email sever located in her basement?Clinton is blaming Trump for the violence at his rallies but the people formulating the violence are on the Democratic Party payroll.
12 | Dar Win | 1325733330856249_1325781314184784 | For some reason when I hear or see Hillary Clinton, I think of the woman who told Winston Churchill, “If I were your wife I’d put poison in your tea!” in which I feel Churchill's sentiments in his reply, “If I were your husband I’d drink it.”
13 | Kathy Burns | 1325733330856249_1325752740854308 | Hillary already has been proven to use double talk.. she tells her sheep what they want to hear all the while planning their demise in private... Keep sleeping you Hi-LIAR-y sheep
14 | Neil Johns | 1325733330856249_1325953310834251 | What has she done? I know she was a senator and secretary of state but tell me what she accomplished with those jobs!

You all seem to be an expert!!
15 | Eva Perez | 1325733330856249_1325914380838144 | The kindergarten bully showed up within 10 min into the debate!Whoa!!!Good for Hillary to pivot to Putin! We cannot let a foreign power meddle in our elections--we're not a 3rd world country! So if Drumpft & the Repugs want to dwell on the Wikileaks hacked e-mails, which fact-checkers proved are the handiwork of Putin(which Drumpft encouraged early on in his campaign) they are in effect letting a foreign power influence our elections!
16 | Caroline Kennedy | 1325733330856249_1326122044150711 | Bush and Cheney between them subverted the course of justice, according to a judgment at the time, by destroying over 22 million emails.  Olin Powell and Condaleeza Rice did the same. Where is your anger over that? Where is your condemnation? I delete many of my emails. I am sure you do too. But you seem to judge Hillary by a totally different standard to everyone else.
17 | Carol Newberg | 1325733330856249_1325778990851683 | That is not a plan tremendous jobs it is very sad! People that are political hacks. We don't use those people we use political hacks! Very much smarter! Make a lot of money! What the hell did Trump just say, word salad!
18 | Ross Mc | 1325733330856249_1325741770855405 | Bad loans caused the recession. Freddy mac fanny mae.. Who created these banks? DING DING Yes the democrats. Check your sheriff sales. It's still killing the economy.
19 | Menard Alex | 1325733330856249_1325753344187581 | She laughting at donald when he tells the truth because she doesnt care about americans and she cant look at the camera when she talks because shes lying!!!!!!
20 | Shawn McGinty | 1325733330856249_1325743897521859 | Why does no one care about the content on wiki leaks? Russians hacked her accounts, that's wrong, but Look at the content.  She's not saying any of that stuff is untrue.  Deflect.  Someone call her out.  The stuff being released is damning and it needs to be considered
21 | Lance Agee | 1325733330856249_1325743520855230 | Why is Hillary Clinton using prepared notes?Remember when Hillary Clinton gave that reset button to the Russians? Remember when the Clintons sold 150 million in uranium to the Russians? Sounds like she is a puppet.
22 | Carol Newberg | 1325733330856249_1325755420854040 | What kind of country do we want in? Not to live in Trump Land that is for sure! Trump will turn this planet into a black crisp!
23 | Rodney Goff | 1325733330856249_1325747557521493 | It just crossed my mind she's talking about global warming How does the United States get by with shredding tires sending them to China to burn in their power plants with the Coal
24 | Ray Smith | 1325733330856249_1325744587521790 | HaHaHa! He didn't make it to the 30 minute mark b4 he cracked! "WRONG!!!!" YAY!! I win the company pool!! I had 29 minutes!!
25 | Tristen Schoppaul | 1325733330856249_1325741114188804 | Now that's funny. It's also false but nobody will care on the left. Clinton as president and it's a guarantee to war with Russia.

2 | Christyne A Cisterna | 1325722844190631_1325729897523259 | I want to know why when Trump speaks of "illegal aliens" why is it ALWAYS Mexicans? Why are we NOT talking about the Russians, Canadians, Middle Easterners?
3 | Marcus Thomas | 1325722844190631_1325727074190208 | The last time a Republican was president we were losing 790,000 jobs a month. Under President Obama strong leadership we are adding 280,000 jobs a month. Lets keep moving in the right direction. #VoteBlue I'm Donald Trump and I approve this comment.
4 | Rita Spinelli | 1325722844190631_1325731080856474 | They will legislate women back to coat hanger days. Women under trump will be set back a century...all through carefully crafted legislation
5 | Donna Marconi | 1325722844190631_1325733960856186 | He's just not very polished or articulate. He can't beat her at debating. Everybody knows who they're voting for already this is just theatre
6 | Naisun Mckoy | 1325722844190631_1325735917522657 | The majority of illegal immigrants come into this country legally on visas. They just never go back. They are flying here not walking over the border. Building a wall is asinine. We need reform. Deport illegals with criminal records and create a path the citizenship for law abiding illegal immigrants so they pay taxes and contribute.
7 | Tommy DeVaughn | 1325722844190631_1325829414179974 | I wish she would call him on his lack of knowledge of The Constitution. The Constitution is more than four words of the 2nd amendment; right to bear arms. That is all he knows about The Constitution, and he proves it with the plethora of assertions he has made during his campaign. I also wished she would have called him out on his decisions to avoid answering questions when he knows he lacks the knowledge base. Then he redirects to attack her personally. As if to say, let’s not talk about me. Let’s talk about her, her husband, or Obama instead of what I know about governing. Republicans should be offended by his campaign because he has fraudulently represented the GOP. I am highly offended he plays the victim and at every angle he paints our country, its ideals, our people, and our democracy in such a dark and gloomy outlook. Lindsey Graham is correct. If he loses, he will lose because he failed as a candidate.
8 | Tom Gertenhäuer | 1325722844190631_1325737860855796 | Where is your proof that Russia is behind the hack attack? without proof of any kind for sure, that's solid, but its interesting when the RNC was being hack attacked, there was no accusations against russia for doing it, and no upset feelings about it either, but i guess its different when its your dirty secrets being made public isn't it? before hacked info was totally legitimate, but now it isn't legitimate because "russia" is doing the hack attack and could be manipulating the emails, lol
9 | Rodney Goff | 1325722844190631_1325735790856003 | You can't raise minimum wage things will Skyrocket stock will drop retirement will be lost and what about people that went to school to further their education i just make a little  above  minimum wage does that mean since I have an education If they raise minimum wage I'll get a raise too
10 | Diana Patton Price | 1325722844190631_1325856514177264 | I used to be Pro-Life until I shared a hospital room with someone getting an abortion.  I was there for surgery to help get pregnant and I was mad at her.  Then  after our procedures she was crying so hard...she told me her story.  I promised myself I would never judge anyone like that again.  Republicans don't realize the problems that occur in pregnancies.  I remember years ago watching a program about the American companies that moved to Mexico.  One was polluting so bad that both towns, one in Texas and the other one in Mexico were having babies born without brains.  Republicans would made a woman carry a baby to full term knowing that it is going to NOT survive.  Medical decisions belong in the hands of the family and the doctor...no one else.  Republicans will make a woman have the child but they don't want to help her take care of it with Healthcare or if she needs help financially.  Years ago Newt G. wanted to put children from poor families in group institutions and he also wanted everyone to have a computer.  Replace the baby with a laptop....they are also against Birth Control, but they aren't as vocal anymore as they used to be.
11 | James Wairimu | 1325722844190631_1325736770855905 | Wait until Chris ask him about why he take the blue pill away from home. Mr groper will sweat, he dnt like black women? That's why he keep saying they should go to Africa. He always have an eye  for immigrants to Mary n white women to grope.
12 | Hannah Kronenberger | 1325722844190631_1325731617523087 | I would love if they would shut up, stop bashing each other and talk about the issues. We should be talking about immigration and we've moved onto nuclear weapons. WHAT THE HELL PEOPLE GET YOURSELVES TOGETHER. I'm so absolutely disappointed right now and this debate just started.
13 | Elsa Wertman-Bush | 1325722844190631_1325797864183129 | How did she get to sidestep the question on how her husband treats women and how she has treated those same women. That is one we should have seen her have to answer. God I hope she loses. Lying lying and then she lies some more.
14 | Cathy McIntosh | 1325722844190631_1325728754190040 | she will fall tonight....with all the leaked emails showing what a cow she is...I cannot stand to even listen to her voice!
15 | Billy Thomas | 1325722844190631_1325732680856314 | Five minutes ago Hillary's biggest concern was protecting toddlers from guns and now she is trying to justify late term, partial birth abortions~ GATSBY
16 | Sherry Johnson Balch | 1325722844190631_1325739717522277 | He claims he wants to cut taxes for EVERYONE, especially the rich, BUT at the same time ramp up spending. Anyone see a problem with that? LOL
17 | Sherry Johnson Balch | 1325722844190631_1325741267522122 | Whenever he brings up how we are losing jobs, why doesn't anyone call out his and his family's manufacturing jobs not in the US?
18 | Dottie Zydek | 1325722844190631_1325797080849874 | The thought of someone like Trump basically telling women what they can or cannot do regarding their lives and bodies is terrifying .
19 | Eric Forrest | 1325722844190631_1325807504182165 | She put him down tonight next week he should be cleaning out his locker no more locker room talk he was the same guy conspiracy lies rude can't take a lost look no taxes we said cool but he cant accept the lost thats lack of leadership there champion loose with pride and congrats the winner he can't lead this country with no plans still
20 | Pat Edelman | 1325722844190631_1325752314187684 | You popped him with that one!  He even had to gather himself together...for once he stood speechless and wasn't interrupting!  YES!
21 | Luke Brown | 1325722844190631_1325731330856449 | Actually Putin said on a YouTube available video that we USA outsmarted him and he doesn't know what we are doing
22 | Scott Bates | 1325722844190631_1325734867522762 | 33,000 kids dead by accident shooting but 3,500,000 unborn babies die each year! Hilery your worried about the wrong number...one is an accident and one is planed
23 | Top Dollar Investment Group | 1325722844190631_1325741794188736 | I can not believe Donald Trump is making statements on national news that Russia is expanding their nuclear capability and America is doing nothing. Why would a presidential candidate make such as serious acquisition our nuclear ambitions.... that would be "Top Secret" and should not be discussed..... Unbelievable!
24 | Carla Simon | 1325722844190631_1325740750855507 | Trump says he will bring back jobs to Amercia, does that mean he will bring his companies back to Amercia? So many of his products are made over seas.
25 | June J McMullen | 1325722844190631_1325726950856887 | And when he says, "Believe me", he is lying -more than usual

1 | Mary Ann Hood McCann | 1325720834190832_1325723287523920 | I really wanted Chris Wallace to address the fact that Trump has not always been pro-life. He used to be pro-choice. Can you say "flip flop"?
2 | Brian Cochran | 1325720834190832_1325723894190526 | Birth rates have declined dramatically as a result of birth control access. Want no abortions? Give universal access to birth control. Abstinence does not work.
3 | Fiona McArthur | 1325720834190832_1325723177523931 | How many women at 9 months do that to there child...he is a liar...late term is the most traumatic for the mother and hey don't do it lightly
4 | Tabitha Hoffler | 1325720834190832_1325725887523660 | Trump gets away with not really saying anything of substance. He blames everyone for everything. He is never responsible for anything.
5 | Regina Dear | 1325720834190832_1325728840856698 | He has been giving her death stares! We do not need a President who rules with intimidation or domination. Never, EVER Trump!!!
6 | Shirley Westfall | 1325720834190832_1325723497523899 | Because women are so stupid we cannot make our own choices. Even though he wanted Marla to abort Tiffany.

8 | Teresa Lucas Doherty | 1325720834190832_1325727204190195 | If a pregnant mother is murdered the perp is charged with two counts of murder. One for the mother and one for the unborn fetus. Why the double standard..It is murder either way.
9 | Jill Narstrom | 1325720834190832_1325725087523740 | If Republicans don't win this race this will likely be end of the two party system, and then that's the end of America and our constitution. Say whatever you want but whoever is President major changes are on the way and I at least want to know I did my part urging people to get out and vote Trump!
10 | Jerry Toupal | 1325720834190832_1325726014190314 | Trump said just last week that ICE endorsed him . But he has been saying this since before September. So which is it? Neither because they are a government entity.
11 | Brenda Brickner | 1325720834190832_1325738107522438 | Didn't he want Marla to abort his daughter Tiffany and she wouldn't? I have no facts just seems to me i read that somewhere...

14 | Jeremy Kelly | 1325720834190832_1325723934190522 | Didn't we decide about abortion about 50 years ago. Time to move on.
15 | Franklin Strum | 1325720834190832_1325809504181965 | Republicans supporting Hillary. She said she would remove all restrictions on abortion, including partial birth abortion and appoint a pro choice Justice that will rule her executive order Constitutional

17 | Sophia Blandings | 1325720834190832_1325735320856050 | Abortion at nine months due to health of the mother:.” Furthermore, Roe cites specific examples of what may be considered harmful to a mother’s health, such as the “stigma of unwed motherhood,” the work of “child care,” and “the distress, for all concerned, associated with the unwanted child.”
18 | Jimmy Rockford | 1325720834190832_1325798207516428 | Partisans on the left will say Hilllary won. Partisans on the right will say Trump won. This Canadian who is disgusted by both saw Trump easily win. Sorry to those who disagree.

23 | C Marie Burke | 1325720834190832_1325724834190432 | Trump can't put two sentences together.He is jumping around and seems as if he can't stay on topic.
24 | Cheryl Brady | 1325720834190832_1325723170857265 | No he won't because he won't win.

2 | Geoff Gentel | 1325718480857734_1325720900857492 | I think it's safe to say that if Trump was hoping for a turnaround for his disaster of a campaign it ain't going to happen tonight!
3 | Marcus Thomas | 1325718480857734_1325720254190890 | Republicans are pro-life and yet support the death penalty. Hypocrisy? Yes! Do as I say, not as I do, the Republican way of life.
4 | Tom Gertenhäuer | 1325718480857734_1325721917524057 | intereting how with all the covereage of the crazy stuff trump said about women, funny how no one brought up a former chef of hillary clinton, that said he heard her call black people the N word
5 | Diane Wadsworth | 1325718480857734_1325812640848318 | Once again Trump starts off focused and then goes off the rails. He praised Russia and Putin again, knows NOTHING about Mosul or Aleppo,  and just wandered around the Middle East questions with fluff and zero substance. He is NOT presidential.

1 | Marcus Thomas | 1325716067524642_1325718087524440 | Trump is finish and he knows it. In the meantime Trump is going to blame everyone from the media to a 10-year-old girl riding her bike in the neighborhood. We just have to sit back and watch the full meltdown of Trump over the next few weeks until Hillary gets elected.
2 | Justin Zollar | 1325716067524642_1325849900844592 | Their job is to confirm or reject. And they've rejected. This is just typical liberal propaganda and Hillary pandering to people that think with emotion rather than logic.

7 | Barbara Healey | 1325716067524642_1325718714191044 | So nice that she supports Roe Vs Wade, but what about protecting a viable baby/fetus?? Doesn't a baby older than 4 months old get a chance to live?? The health of the mother should always be considered, but if the mother is healthy why kill the baby??

9 | Zabi Habash | 1325716067524642_1325756734187242 | When the FBI director straight up says "in other cases like this we have recommended charges, but in this case we do not" that's when you know the depth of corruption in this government. They don't even hide it anymoreThe FBI found her incompetent, not criminal. Either way she is not fit to be elected to Dog Catcher, much less POTUS.
10 | Kirstien Demuth | 1325716067524642_1325718164191099 | Hillary won the debate hands down. Get your head out of your a$$ if you think otherwise.
11 | Franklin Strum | 1325716067524642_1325720960857486 | To be short on guns Hillary will ban open carry, reverse Heller decision and have gun manufacturers sued for criminals actions. To be short on abortions she will lift all restrictions on abortion including partial birth abortion and have taxpayers funded abortions.
12 | Jennifer Yu | 1325716067524642_1325746520854930 | Trump is so laughably ignorant. India and China are developing countries, of course their growth is higher. And ehT a hypocrite!
13 | Sophia Blandings | 1325716067524642_1325735824189333 | Abortion at nine months due to health of the mother:.” Furthermore, Roe cites specific examples of what may be considered harmful to a mother’s health, such as the “stigma of unwed motherhood,” the work of “child care,” and “the distress, for all concerned, associated with the unwanted child.”
14 | Carlos Yam | 1325716067524642_1325721764190739 | Unbelievable he wants walls but he keeps hiring immigrants for his business
15 | Pam Streeter | 1325716067524642_1325718350857747 | Trump got his first whine in about Ginsburg saying mean things about him. waaaaaahhh
16 | Yvette Cathers | 1325716067524642_1325719147524334 | Good luck getting the senate to do its job.  Or congress, for that matter.
17 | James Weir | 1325716067524642_1325725984190317 | Trump is FINISHED! What a biggly idiot. Trumps new word "biggly".
18 | Tomas Davis | 1325716067524642_1325718207524428 | Clinton is losing terribly in the debate. WikiLeaks just dropped emails with Clinton calling Blacks the "N" word.
19 | Geoff Gentel | 1325716067524642_1325719910857591 | I'm not sure if Donald took Coke again for this debate or if he popped about five Valiums?
20 | Artis Williams | 1325716067524642_1325790130850569 | ....And your winner, with a TKO in the 3rd round..., And the new President Of The United States Of America..... Hillary Clinton!!!!!
21 | Diana Patton Price | 1325716067524642_1325872577508991 | After 45 years of conservative rulings, here’s what a liberal Supreme Court would do"...In 1973, the Supreme Court reversed a lower-court order that had compelled Texas to fund its school districts — the poor Hispanic and African American districts and the richer, mostly white districts — equally. The vote in San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez was 5 to 4 . A year later, the same Republican-appointed majority stopped the courts from extending school desegregation into mostly white suburbs. In both cases, the rulings emphasized the value of local control of schools. As a result, public schools are more segregated today than they were in 1970, and there are serious questions about the quality of the education provided in poorer districts...."https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/after-45-years-of-conservative-rulings-heres-what-a-liberal-supreme-court-would-do/2016/02/19/efa63ad4-d589-11e5-b195-2e29a4e13425_story.html?utm_term=.1199b551f884
22 | Gloria Taylor Aufner | 1325716067524642_1325720540857528 | Anybody counting his sniffs? I change the channel when he starts trying to talk
23 | Rodney Goff | 1325716067524642_1325719130857669 | She don't want to kid to shoot himself with a gun as long as the he doesn't come out you can slice its throat what's the difference between a knife and a gun
24 | Rodney Goff | 1325716067524642_1325782370851345 | He's not lying because January 1st 2017 all health insurance will rise 56%
25 | Fred Arcala | 1325716067524642_1325720634190852 | Once the Donald is boss of America for life, only he will be able to appoint anyone for anything. True law and order.

--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Karen White | 1325693407526908_1325695027526746 | Get rid of Andrea Mitchell She is bias against Hillary. She repeated that Hillary was doping like it was true. She is irresponsible and should be fired. Send her to fox. She is lousy at her job
2 | Ritz Ritzy | 1325693407526908_1325693824193533 | ok Hillary good luck girl! just keep blocking and talking about the issues. You're almost there! #Hillary2016
3 | Al Shannon | 1325693407526908_1325739634188952 | Wallace is an embarrassment to real journalist. He will never nor his network be asked to get near a national debate stage. He has fed Trump the questions and has been attacking only Hillary. So far, Hillary is still wining.
4 | Deb Brodigan | 1325693407526908_1325723817523867 | Sniffing, sniffing, sniffing, scare talk, not really answer the question. Mexico has said they will move to take back New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, part of California, and part of Colorado if NAFTA is stopped.
5 | Kathy Pazienza | 1325693407526908_1325705294192386 | I really dislike TV host Chris Matthew's! He constantly interrupts his guests , asks them a question, then interrupts and talks over them. It is getting to the point that if he is on, we turn the channel. Rachel Maddow,Chris Hayes, and Joy are much better !!
6 | Belinda Cullen Black | 1325693407526908_1325699570859625 | Wouldn't it be wonderful if they both were given a test in Civics as part of the debate?  Hillary's been in government all her life  and is on a completely different playing field than Trump.  He would crash and burn.
7 | Cammie Stevens-Washburn | 1325693407526908_1325718740857708 | I have watched all the debates and it is very rare that Trump Ever Ever Ever answer a question........He deflects to Hillary. Hillary has the answers or an ideas....Deflect Deflect Deflect never Ever does he answer a question. He can't even answer a question!!!! God Help Us if Trump becomes President!!! Trump you are not God!!!
8 | Silver Cloud | 1325693407526908_1325705447525704 | Sorry Donald Trump is way ahead and we do have a rigged Election...everybody knows it just like Hillary has been getting away with Murder... No surprise.
9 | Cammie Stevens-Washburn | 1325693407526908_1325760630853519 | It's time the American People do whats best for America!!! GO HILLARY!!!   Trump it takes more than one person to pass a law!!! Trump you are creating riots....No Trump you should never have been aloud to run!!!
10 | Al Shannon | 1325693407526908_1325717047524544 | I told you so. Already it is evident that Trump has been fed questions by Wallace. Trump knows nothing about particular cases of gun control unless he has been fed the questions.
11 | Patricia Williams-Schlitz | 1325693407526908_1325701704192745 | So , Brian Williams, if the elections aren't rigged, how do you account for the recently released videos EXPLAINING how they've been "doing  it for the past 50 years" !!! Report ALL the news, PLEASE!😡😡😡
12 | Richard Kiely | 1325693407526908_1325698567526392 | Pence is not an American. He so obviously hates Americans and states that there is widespread voter fraud. At the base of this is an undermining of how democracy works. The Republican Party is fanning the flames of treasonous acts. Americans will not stand for this. Americans will stand up to the non-American extreme right wing believers and they shall be chucked, jolly to the sea.
13 | Lee B Brian | 1325693407526908_1325711517525097 | It hasn't started but Trump & his supporters will declare him the overwhelming winner!! Which is okay with me. Seeing as Hillary will win the election by a landslide!!!
14 | Carlos DeCarvalho | 1325693407526908_1325697934193122 | Liberals need to get your heads out of the sand, drive with your window open, see the people around you, stop turning away from the reality, facing poverty head on and do something about it? When was the last time you walked up to a poor person and hand them a $20 bill and said god bless you, knowing that you are far better off then they are! Liberals are self interest individuals who only see themselves and no one else! It sickens me!
15 | Kalar Walters | 1325693407526908_1325697450859837 | Love Steve Schmidt!!!  P.S. Why isn't the difference discussed between voter fraud and voter registration fraud?  The latter does not result in voter fraud, but it sounds bad.  Please explain that to people!
16 | Sandy Palumbo | 1325693407526908_1325890724173843 | Hillary.....you going to make jobs for medical staff that performs third trimester abortions? Third trimester abortions are murder. You will have a hard time finding RNs and MDs to do this heinous act. If the child is ill and threatening the life of the mother, the fetus can be delivered by C Section with dignity, respect and humanely. The child can also be baptized in the faith of the parents.Instead, Hillary wants the fetus ripped apart in incredible pain. Hillary....you are a malignant, evil, hateful sick woman. Go to Hell with your sick ideas. Sandy Palumbo, RNTRUMP 2016
17 | Mark Idzik | 1325693407526908_1325698634193052 | Hey Steve Schmitt instead of helping the left and NBC why don't you get a real job instead of criticizing Republicans the foundation is there but people like you make us look bad just by saying what you do as opposed to telling the truth it's not Trump's fault that it's crumbling a part of a commission to look into voter fraud then you'll find the real answers do the research my friend
18 | Sue Rolfe | 1325693407526908_1325700804192835 | Did Brian Williams just vow to brings "facts back" after this is all over?? How about you bring facts back now? He's so painful to listen to. Poor Rachel Maddow. You should team her up with Chris Hayes.
19 | Steven Tucker | 1325693407526908_1325695954193320 | This is what the liberal Democratic party has become. Look, you may be a lifelong Democratic, but they are not who they once were and do you really want to be a part of what they have become? Democrats no longer care about people, that is evident by the lack of respect they continue to display for the American people. Watch this video, if you really care, to see exactly what devices they use to hurt the American people. You will not see the liberal mainstream media talk about it because they are a part of it. https://youtu.be/hDc8PVCvfKs
20 | Buster Pleton | 1325693407526908_1325734167522832 | it's sad that just debating get's him so mad. He CANNOT be president, no way. He did try to be cool, but Hillary got him to show how he still is..........DANGEROUS.
21 | Cheryl Hall | 1325693407526908_1325698517526397 | We should all be talking about those emails, the collusion between the HRC camp and the State Department, the FBI, her lies to us the American people, her public stand and her private one only for the Wall Street big shots, selling the office of Secretary of State to the highest bidder. There is so much to distrust about her that I get such a sick feeling whenever I see or hear her name. Her corruption is revolting.
22 | Ken Cindy Tedesco | 1325693407526908_1325700404192875 | Please all Trump supporters . Pray for Donald Trump to expose Hillary for what she is ,a traitor to our country and that she refused to help Americans being murdered in Benghazi and their bodies dragged in the streets
23 | Buster Pleton | 1325693407526908_1325725467523702 | Uh oh, spoke to soon, he's becoming unraveled, and interrupted twice now. Though his tone is still good. No hollering.....yet.

The self-proclaimed "Trump troll extraordinaire" says Donald J. Trump  keeps talking about a "rigged election," because campaign CEO Steve Bannon wants to boost his business.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Kevin Lynch | 1325677634195152_1325680294194886 | Ok MSNBC, you have had every Trump camp manager include Pence on pre debate show now. I cannot take these bafoons. Trump wanted to make the last debate a Jerry Springer show so he brought everything on as he is throwing stones while living in a glass house.
2 | Sergio Lorenz | 1325677634195152_1325680210861561 | The only thing that’s ‘rigged’ is a system that lets a billionaire pay zero taxes like this tramp Mr trump.
3 | Cynthia Huhs | 1325677634195152_1325680897528159 | This isn't a DICTATORSHIP trump. As much as you'd like it to be. People's voices have a right to be heard, and so far, the smart ones can see right through a con-artist like YOU!!!
4 | Top Dollar Investment Group | 1325677634195152_1325681494194766 | Rudy Giuliani is wrong. Emails marked confidential is "not classified material" such as "Secret" or "Top Secret" because confidential email means just that: Intended for only certain people to see but it is not secret of top secret email. I'm tired of Republicans and all the Hillary haters trying to mislead the American public by insinuating that Hillary Clinton mishandled secret and top secret; aka: classified information. By saying she mishandled classified material is misleading to the general public. It's not a state of emergency or a national security issue.

5 | Daniel Santefort | 1325677634195152_1325691814193734 | No Mark Cuban is insanely jealous of Donald Trump and has been for decades.....He is a Chump, irrespective of his wealth..."Put a Suit on a Monkey...You still have a Monkey" Humphrey Bogart  CUBAN is a Monkey.....
6 | Cynthia Huhs | 1325677634195152_1325679904194925 | Funny how the media, and the system is rigged when it doesn't go Trump's way. Waaaahhhhhh!!!! What a LOSER!!!!
7 | Mark Deda | 1325677634195152_1325678000861782 | Ops wrong page 😜" I hear that train a comin’It’s rollin’ round the bend.Gonna pick up Mrs. ClintonAnd take her to the pen.They’ll have her coronationMake her cell block queenHillary for prisontwo thousand and sixteenThey’ve got an orange pants suitHangin’ on the wallAnd a cell for Bubba WillieJust a little down the hall.We’ll put ‘em in the big houseLock them up inside.Unless a whole lot of witnessesCommit suicide.Remember James McDougalAnd 20 or 30 moreAbout to testify, they found ‘em dead upon the floor.Now they’re pilin’ up the bodiesLike they did back thenThey want back in the White HouseHere we go again.Glue the china to the tableNail the table to the floorLock up all the silver‘fore they haul it out the doorWhite trash in the White HouseBeats all I’ve ever seen.Hillary for prisontwo thousand and sixteen
8 | Carlos DeCarvalho | 1325677634195152_1325683430861239 | Is it just me! Or Is it that most liberals are wired differently then most Americans? You intellectual Hillary supporters live in a bubble! Much like the DOME show. You don't get out beyond your neighborhood and friends. So, you only see what tv offers. Get out and touch real people, those who have been ravaged by Obamacare, the poor who are still living in limbo awaiting the promises the DNC gave 20 years ago and still haven't delivered! So, when I read the narrow mind intellectual liberals spew what they heard on tv. I feel for you, I understand, you are lost in your own little world of wealth and extravagance.
9 | Rebekah Jackson | 1325677634195152_1325681290861453 | Thank you Mark Cuban. Trump's run has been all about making money. Hey, all I'm seeing is Mike Pence- msnbc has waa-aaay too many trump surrogates. Hey, where's Tim Kaine, why don't you talk to him instead of the gas bag Pence.
10 | Betsy Kardos | 1325677634195152_1325698124193103 | And Trump campaign is running a FB Live event plugging new network/online venture even as I type. How pathetically ignorant do viewers have to be for Fox "News" to not be biased and inaccurate enough?!
11 | Odonnell Sanders | 1325677634195152_1326182167478032 | The election was rigged the minute Trump became the nominee. All the GOP had to do was pick someone to defeat Clinton and all they could come up with is Trump. Yep, the GOP rigged the election so the Democrats could win.
12 | Glenn Boone | 1325677634195152_1325690927527156 | They need to asked Ben Ginsburg that when Pence said in his state their investigating 1000s of voter registration fraud. Then these voters are not on the registration rolls to vote because they are under investigation so how could their be voter fraud?
13 | Linda Heflin | 1325677634195152_1325692620860320 | Trump trolls go away, go away, go away. come again another day, not really, just go away. it is ops the wrong page and you will never get that song to catch on here with anyone but chris matthews. I am sure when the debate is over matthews will embarass himself and the network by announcing one more time that don the con won again.
14 | Carlos DeCarvalho | 1325677634195152_1325698097526439 | Liberals need to get your heads out of the sand, drive with your window open, see the people around you, stop turning away from the reality, facing poverty head on and do something about it?

15 | Huns Core | 1325677634195152_1325950937501155 | if HiLIARy is not nasty, why her daughter looks not like clinton but Hubbell?, if she is not nasty, why she insulted the women her husband insulted? if she is not nasty,why she deleted 33,000 emails ,if she is not nasty, why she left 4 American men dead without helping them,.........she is a liar as Obama said: she only talks but never can do ...https://youtu.be/UoE73WNoCXo
16 | Julie Leonard Fleury | 1325677634195152_1325689354193980 | its funny they never report on hillarys wrongdoing there is so much to report but this brainwashed hillary Chanel report everyday on donald let me tell you donald has not done half what bill and hillary clinton did focus on these criminals
17 | Mary Linderberg | 1325677634195152_1325713814191534 | Nice try, but It amazes me that CBS, can do a five minute piece on voter fraud and dead people voting in Colorado but denounce Trumps claims of voter fraud as rhetoric...think about that a minute (or more).
18 | Lise Melin | 1325677634195152_1325682884194627 | Not by much. Bannon, a longtime conservative media executive, was the chairman of the far-right Breitbart News (source of many conspiracy theories), and now CEO of Trump's campaign.
19 | Kevin N Mary Stocker | 1325677634195152_1325683567527892 | Nevermind those videos of Democrat consultants that boasted how they rigged the elections or those DNC emails outlining the strategy how they rigged the election in Hillary's favor.
20 | Jobie Lyne Christy | 1325677634195152_1325710844191831 | Trump's own manager acknowledged Wednesday morning during an interview on MSNBC, that she doesn’t believe the election is rigged.“No, I do not believe" that there will be widespread voter fraud in the election, she said. “So absent overwhelming evidence that there is, it would not be for me to say that there is.”
21 | Sandy Palumbo | 1325677634195152_1325890840840498 | Hillary.....you going to make jobs for medical staff that performs third trimester abortions? Third trimester abortions are murder. You will have a hard time finding RNs and MDs to do this heinous act. If the child is ill and threatening the life of the mother, the fetus can be delivered by C Section with dignity, respect and humanely. The child can also be baptized in the faith of the parents.Instead, Hillary wants the fetus ripped apart in incredible pain. Hillary....you are a malignant, evil, hateful sick woman.

22 | Luz Mark | 1325677634195152_1325696637526585 | They might as well had gotten Jerry Springer to moderate the last debate if Trump is bringing up garbage.. so adult and mature.. not👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽
23 | Mark Idzik | 1325677634195152_1325699360859646 | But Brian Williams was there he knows it all oh my God give me a break this guy's like he's even got a job but the reason they need him is because people listen to his crap even though its ratings are way down
24 | Brandon Horan | 1325677634195152_1325678327528416 | Well, Mark Cuban is no wrong. I'd choose a potato over Trump to run the office.
25 | Joe Mac | 1325677634195152_1325681097528139 | Trolls out in force! Hey trolls! If Trump is losing  why are they're so many over paid uninformed Lying trolls on every page? Why all the bashing? Why all the Lies? Why all the nonstop posting of the corrupt polls? Why??? Because you and your Saudi owned media are scared!
