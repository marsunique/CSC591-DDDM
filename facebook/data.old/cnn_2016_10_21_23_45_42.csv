Should prostitution be legal? For some women, they are proud to call this a career. Lisa Ling takes you to one of America’s most famous brothels on #ThisIsLife Sunday at 10p ET/PT.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Anthony Mosavi | 10155495046141509_10155495053051509 | Yes, prostitution should be legal, and government-supervised. Prostitution being illegal makes a black market where women, men, and children can be practically owned and treated inhumanely by cartels, pimps, and criminal organizations.
2 | David Stauder | 10155495046141509_10155495089336509 | If it's legal both women and men would be protected via the law and healthcare.  Prostitution has always existed. Why not make all parties protected. Including witting or unwitting spouses.
3 | Cameron Rodgers | 10155495046141509_10155495090256509 | Omg i cant believe in 2016 people are talking about legalizing prostitution!! My goodness this country is going down the drain.
4 | Derrick Burke | 10155495046141509_10155495064906509 | As long as it's a choice. Law enforcement ruin the lives of many men and women when they arrest people for prostitution. If I want to sell my body then I should be able to! It's my body!
5 | Brandon Graham | 10155495046141509_10155495054396509 | If it were legalized there would be a lot less human trafficking
6 | Sergio Peña | 10155495046141509_10155495056516509 | Yes, so I can stop wasting money & time on dates.
7 | Yaroslav Zaitsev | 10155495046141509_10155495097896509 | If europe is an indicator, price for prostitutes is dropping off the face off the earth because other women are giving it up for free. In a place like germany where it is legal, influx of romanian and russian women is literally killing that industry and they have healthcare and legislation protecting them. If you make prostitution legal, there will be an overnight drop in marriage rates and relationships because it will be cheaper to you know.... than you know... Either way with invention of male birth control pill soon to hit the market, our society is going to get a much needed face lift.
8 | Tony Ton | 10155495046141509_10155495107236509 | Surrrreeeeee, prostitution is OK eh CNN but a kiss on the lips is considered sexual assault if a male initiates it? Make up your friggin minds. Maybe it's time men fought back and sued for female sexual advances. I'll be the first.
9 | Nick Carter | 10155495046141509_10155495117866509 | I couldn't do it but I'm not against it. Its kinda like legalizing marijuana. Its not really hurting anyone and regulation relieves jails and courts. It also creates another source of taxes.
10 | Michael Angelo Vivas Villaluz | 10155495046141509_10155495054506509 | prostitution is the oldest job in the history of mankind... if it should be legal, maybe yes, but morality stands in the way, in most of it acceptance...
11 | Basil Ohagwu | 10155495046141509_10155495113586509 | Polygamy should be legalized too.Marriage between a human and animal (wide or domestic) should be legalized too.In fact, legalize everything, after all, everything is choice. LolPeople are getting out of their minds everyday.
12 | Jon Hanson | 10155495046141509_10155495072186509 | Yes, it would greatly reduce the black market, sex slaves, and the exploitation of minors. It would make it safer for these women, and the government shouldn't tell a woman or man what they can and can't do with their bodies
13 | PTown BikerBoy | 10155495046141509_10155495059011509 | Should it be illegal?.....well it's their choice....just make sure you have a receipt so you don't catch any additional charges if you know what I mean😂😂😂
14 | Jeff Wegner | 10155495046141509_10155495106971509 | It already is legal. How many women stay in a marriage of convenience because they don't want to lose the Volvo or the house in the 'burbs?
15 | Kris Rodriguez | 10155495046141509_10155495090086509 | Yes and No.Yes for the reason that women should be able to do what they want with their bodies.And no for the reason that they would likely eventually be killed by either a psycho or a pimp.
16 | Helen Mansfield | 10155495046141509_10155495112831509 | What a consenting woman decides to do with her body for money, with another consenting adult shouldn't be illegal. That's why there's human trafficking. Make it legal, regulate it and the criminal element will lose interest.
17 | Mike McCullough | 10155495046141509_10155495140726509 | It is legal in Mexico, Germany, Israel and might as well be in France (Bois de Boulogne) and Italy. Prague is renowned for the brothels. In Japan, Soap Land runs TV ads. Around the world, Americans have a reputation for hangups over sex. I have never heard of any shocking horror stories coming out of Nevada.
18 | Richard Mcvoy | 10155495046141509_10155495098776509 | Absolutely it should be legal it's kind of funny that you can give something away for free but if you charge for it you can go to jail makes no sense
19 | Brian Stratton | 10155495046141509_10155495136981509 | If you do legalize it the price skyrockets and then people will still find a way to do it to avoid taxes and what have you.
20 | John Zell | 10155495046141509_10155495113146509 | If Planned Parenthood  can sell baby parts, and Hillary Clinton can sell political favors. Women should be able to sell there, you know what. Oh and guys too.
21 | Ken Eldridge | 10155495046141509_10155495062071509 | CNN CAN NOT BE TRUSTED THEY’RE PLUMMETING IN RATINGS! CNN is now the 1,470th most respected brand among consumers, followed by MSNBC at 1,471th. Fox News also continues to regularly win the ratings battle against its cable news counterparts.
22 | Bob Staffa | 10155495046141509_10155495054316509 | 100% yes. It's her body to do with what she wants. If legalized it would eliminate the dangers and crime of trafficking.
23 | Yvette Cathers | 10155495046141509_10155495067636509 | Prostitution spreads disease, destroys marriages, and erodes society.  Why don't we just turn the whole country into a ghetto slum all at once.
24 | Mike Daly | 10155495046141509_10155495056431509 | There would Be less demand For Sex Trafficking. So yeah
25 | Cook Von Shizerman | 10155495046141509_10155495085131509 | Prostitution, gambling, and drugs should be legal nationwide.... Tax it and regulate it and collect the revenue

Jake Tapper: "I don't speak for Jews."

Curt Schilling: "Right, no, I know you don't."
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Dustin Ginsberg | 10155494964551509_10155494965631509 | We vote Democrat because we know what it's like to not be treated as equals, targeted for our religion and we strive to help our fellow man/woman.Plus, with all the awful anti Semitic remarks being said by trump supporters, it's no wonder we aren't voting for him.
2 | Billy Parvatam | 10155494964551509_10155494970886509 | Curt Schilling would get destroyed by Elizabeth Warren in a senate race
3 | Paula Morris Esterline | 10155494964551509_10155494985776509 | Curt Schilling you may have been a great baseball player but a politician you are not!! Stick to baseball!! I have seen you now on both CNN and MSNBC today and you are a complete and total jerk and that's putting it mildly!! How dare you call into question Jake Tappers faith as it relates to the democratic party and Israel!! Just sad and low!! Then you tried to say Chris Matthews said something he didn't say!! I hope you do run against Elizabeth Warren and she sees right through you and puts you in your place!! You are a Trump wannabe and have no business in politics!! End of rant!!
4 | Gene Bannister | 10155494964551509_10155494987686509 | In this election I would think those of the Jewish faith are seeing many similarities in another man who wanted to blame others & make his nation "great" again and they do not want another Hitler.  His fanatic followers could not see it either & some still believe his rhetoric and policies.
5 | Daniel Collins | 10155494964551509_10155495016151509 | Eli Wiesel, a notable Nobel Prize recipient and Holocaust survivor came to this country a long time ago because we accepted him and offered him refuge when other countries refused him entrance.  I respect Mr. Wiesel's life and work.  As time went by, I realized that the Democrat Party represents now, what we as a country represented then to Mr. Wiesel.  All accepting, all tolerant and all respecting other religions and faiths.  The GOP, and this idiot that I once respected as a pitcher for my Red Sox, don't get it.  We're a melting pot, and people regardless of where they come from are welcome.  Even though I am not Jewish, I cannot presume to speak for any of the Jewish faith or any faith for that matter, but I would imagine that anyone seeking shelter from persecution and hate, flock here to worship their own religion, free from harm.  I like to think that the Democratic Party ideals encapture that better than the GOP.
6 | Michelle Scannell | 10155494964551509_10155494977916509 | He must've lost a lot more blood than I'd thought in that bloody sock, because listening to him speak, he sounds as if he has some permanent brain damage. So sad. Did appreciate his Sox contributions, but accolades end there.
7 | Kaana Joe | 10155494964551509_10155495001541509 | I am so disappointed by American democracy. The Democratic Party especially Hillary Clinton reminds me of the corrupt African leaders. How can Americans vote for a liar, corrupt and power hungry women?
8 | Michele D'Anjolell | 10155494964551509_10155495027031509 | Chris De La Rocha12 minsI'm not trying to offend anyone, but its really sad how: Oblivious, feminine, and unaware many people are these days. I'm only 18 years old, and I can see past the bias media and the evilness in the democratic party, easily. The issue with my generation is we are spoiled, lazy, and attached to our electronics all the time. The media has taught us men to act feminine, and have taught the woman to be the man in the relationship. We have got to start making up our own minds instead of liberal celebrities brainwashing us. I keep on seeing ''I'm not voting for Trump in this election because he is mean.'' That's exactly my point about the feminization of America. When did men all of the sudden get offended by words? Who, What, When, Where, and why did we go wrong? If you were to tell the men of the early 17th century fighting for our freedom that our men of the 21st century were going to start acting like sissy's, and elect a criminal instead of a qualified candidate because of a tape that came out they would probably get the whip out, and leave you with a good butt whipping, and shape you up. When was talking vulgar worse than actual criminal actions?''Are you better off than you were four years ago?''. The answer to that is heck no. We have been under a democratic regime for the past eight years, and things have gotten a lot worse. Even if you have been a life long democrat you know I'm correct. Now because of the Obama administration we have: ISIS, Obamacare, a corrupt FBI, the government funding planned parenthood, the BLM, gender confusion, many more people living in poverty in the inner cities, More people on food stamps, mass shootings, a racially divided country, and an average of twenty-five veterans committing suicide because they aren't receiving the right care that they deserve.I wish there was a way we could actually go back eight years in time, and elect a different president. Oh and the people that call you racist because you say Obama isn't a good president are the racist one's. Everyone knows he has been the worst president of all time. This isn't a skin color issue this is a statistic issue.Look at the national debt. 10.63 trillion in January 2009 when Barack Obama took the oath of office. That was about $34,840 for each of the nation’s 305 million people at the time. The debt is now $19.688 trillion – a whopping increase of more than nine trillion dollars in less than eight years – or $60,380 for each of America’s 324 million inhabitants.People are afraid to say he is the worst of all time because they don't want to be labeled as a ''bigot.'' But hey facts are facts.Galatians 6:7- ''Be not deceived ; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth , that shall also reap.'' Isaiah 5:20- '' Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil ; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness ; that put bitter for sweet , and sweet for bitter!'' This verse mean's in the end days bad will be called good, and good will be called bad. If you told the woman of the early 20th century that abortion was going to be legal, and funded by the government they would be spinning in their graves. A vote for Trump/Pence is a vote for Jesus Christ in this nation. A vote for Hillary is a vote for more violence, killings, and corruption. This is the last chance to steer this sinking ship in the right direction! if Trump isn't elected a republican will never get in office ever again.
9 | Chunk Diesel | 10155494964551509_10155494976426509 | On Facebook we see the true character of people through how they communicate.Many are eager to ascribe the worst motives to others but want the exact opposite for themselves.Stereotyping is a strong trait of a lack of character: "This person of this religion/race/country said this so they must all be like that."Many times I observe people talking AT each other instead of talking WITH each other.I have also seen that many hold a conversation to just say their part and not have any ounce of willingness to try to understand where the other person is coming from, maybe what they've been through or if that person is hurting inside.Another trait of a lack of character would be to assume the worst from what a person says, not giving them the benefit of the doubt. Again, if the tables were turned and you were misunderstood and truly meant what you said in a different way... wouldn't you rather be given the benefit of the doubt?These traits come from something called grace and mercy, which leads to compassion and understanding, which leads to protected friendships, acquaintances, and societies.Do you know where they teach grace, mercy and UNCONDITIONAL forgiveness. Nope, not Netflix.... nope not Monday Night Football... nope not Scadal. Below is an example of a certain "someone" saying 'Loving your family is EASY, try loving someone(by action and/or words) that you just don't like or they just don't like you.'““You have heard the law that says, ‘Love your neighbor’ and hate your enemy. But I say, love your enemies! Pray for those who persecute you! In that way, you will be acting as true children of your Father in heaven. For he gives his sunlight to both the evil and the good, and he sends rain on the just and the unjust alike. If you love only those who love you, what reward is there for that? Even corrupt tax collectors do that much. If you are kind only to your friends, how are you different from anyone else? Even pagans do that. But you are to be perfect, even as your Father in heaven is perfect.”Jesus Christ‭‭Matthew‬ ‭5:43-48‬ ‭NLT‬‬
10 | Enrique Sanchez | 10155494964551509_10155495008841509 | Because they were able to see what would become of the GOP. They nominated an individual for the presidency that blames immigrants for the this countrys problems like Hitler did to their ancestors in 🇩🇪
11 | Dee Ann Carbo | 10155494964551509_10155495000211509 | i watched the interview.  he also said to jake tapper, I suppose you vote Democrat.  Jake Tapper was very uncomfortable.  said no he didn't. it was an all around weird conversation.
12 | John Winkels | 10155494964551509_10155495105226509 | It has always been an enigma to me as well.  I don't understand how a self-professed Jew could vote for the democrats, who are openly and blatantly anti-Semitic.
13 | Paul Vani | 10155494964551509_10155494977566509 | The Curse of the Bambino continues except now we are cursed with the lingering Curt Schilling instead of a World Series drought.
14 | Dane Campbell | 10155494964551509_10155495011346509 | I think the assumption is that American Jews feel Israel is a primary issue to them rather than falling in with the politics of their local communities. That assumption is apparently incorrect. They supported Obama at 70% or more, and no President has been less favorable to Israel. If Republican want to appeal more to these voters, they will need to pick a different issue.
15 | Deborah Kaplan | 10155494964551509_10155495046626509 | Because the Constitution recognizes freedom of religion but evangelical republicans often don't. They see no problem with imposing Christian rules on everyone and assume that's just fine with all of us.
16 | Everett F. Pomare | 10155494964551509_10155495057491509 | It's because, frankly, most American Jews tend to be very liberal, even more liberal than whites, believe it or not! Jews have supported many socially liberal campaigns for many years now, and we can expect that to continue as the years go by. In addition, Jewish people in the U.S. are usually not Orthodox: this means that they don't keep Kosher, only go to temple on special occasions, could care less about the Sabbath on Saturday, and tend to be very community-service oriented. Religiously speaking, most American Jews are liberal Reformists (or are Conservatives, who are basically Reformists with a little more Hebrew in their services, but just as liberal). Not so with the Orthodox, who are VERY conservative, and VERY resistant to change.
17 | William Martin | 10155494964551509_10155495003916509 | This is the future of the party, celebrity over substance because people with educations aren't going to bite. I'm a huge Giants fan but if Matt Cain ran for Senate I'd say no way, he doesn't even have a BA? Schilling's claim to fame is he destroyed a video game company.
18 | Dave Vachon | 10155494964551509_10155494992436509 | Curt Schilling may have been a great baseball player, but he's dumber than a bag of hammers. That he's seen as a bright light for his movement is good news for progressive politics.
19 | Brogan Foarde | 10155494964551509_10155495032016509 | Maybe because the idea of an extreme right-wing demagogue promising to eliminate certain ethnic groups under the pretense of ultranationalism doesn't sit too well with Jews.
20 | Tim Malone | 10155494964551509_10155495043376509 | Schilling is a racist has been, trying desperately to stay relevant.  Just ignore him, all he wants is attention.  He's the male version of Ann Coulter.
21 | David Burlison | 10155494964551509_10155495095241509 | If I was Jewish I would also feel more comfortable voting Democrat. Right now the Republicans are strongly appealing to conservative Christian activist. However, and Ironically, the more conservative and devout the Christian is in reality, the greater is the devotion to protect and respect the Jewish community. And any attack on the Jewish community would be an attack on the Real Christian community.
22 | Giovani Morgs | 10155494964551509_10155495107301509 | Just another Trump wanna-be buffoon with absolutely no experience trying to run for a high office instead of working his way up. He's a privileged punk that think society owes him because he played a little ball in the pros and has a political opinion thats worth as much as the hair in my a$$
23 | Melissa Jakubowski Kingsley | 10155494964551509_10155495084086509 | We're about to be rid of one crazy alt right fool, let's not bring another one to the forefront. When you give them a voice, you're part of the problem.
24 | Barbara Ocon Hulsizer | 10155494964551509_10155495114546509 | This was actually a very good conversation. His question was an attempt to get an opinion or seek an answer. It was NOT asked with disdainful malice. As for this possible race, I live in CA
25 | Debbie Collins Smith | 10155494964551509_10155495066641509 | Why would Jake not vote in a presidential election...and admit it ..... would be better if he said I don't discuss my politics I just report.

Locals joke the new head makes baby Jesus look like spiky-haired Lisa Simpson from the famous cartoon, The Simpsons
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Sandra Cruz Ramos | 10155494893146509_10155494900486509 | There certain things you can joke around and this ain't one of them :/
2 | Fotune Alina Jim | 10155494893146509_10155494924671509 | CNN indirectly making mockery of Jesus, try doing that to your peaceful Muslims "Mohammed"and see what will happen to you fools, by now they probably would have blown up your tv stations. Jesus remains the greatest  and most influential Man that ever lived and is still living, with 2.6 billion followers and believers. You morons ain't even close to his shoes.
3 | Blanca Rodriguez | 10155494893146509_10155494923346509 | Well, no one really knows how HE looked like. We are told in the Bible not to make idols from above or bellow. The one thing we know is that Jesus was humble, loving, forgiving and all the good and perfect attributes there are.
4 | Wayne Hines | 10155494893146509_10155494914941509 | You are so right Kellyanne Conway,If Trump would've made that comment that Biden made,Networks all over the country would have a field day.We know what's going on,Don't worry.
5 | Olia Catala | 10155494893146509_10155494900826509 | Looks like Donald trump...orange with bad hair
6 | Samuel James Fast | 10155494893146509_10155494962886509 | This isn't ok. Neither is making cartoons about Mohamad, making jokes about Hawkins being a cripple, or laughing at Buddhists because they beleive in reincarnation. Life is difficult, life is hard, and the last thing humanity needs is for people to make it harder. As much as it is up to me, I plan on living in a way that makes the lives of those around me easier, and more joy filled. It would be great if the person who did this would do the same.
7 | Fitz Greg | 10155494893146509_10155494958191509 | Kinda disrespectful of CNN. Then again they are a joke to begin with. You know if someone did this to the Muslim culture they would have at least blurred out the picture out of respect. CNN obviously only respects certain types of religions, races and political affiliations. We are not all EQUAL according to CNN.
8 | Dar'Rell Brackett | 10155494893146509_10155494965041509 | Couldn't care how Jesus looks though this image and all other images are a lie and very unimportant. all I know is I need him and the world does to. woe to those who don't have believe in Christ.
9 | Stephen Bentley | 10155494893146509_10155494992661509 | For those whom are religious, IF you read the Bible at all, you would have found that Jesus is sarcastic through a lot of his teachings. He even got irritated at people that didn't understand what a metaphor was. Maybe some of you need a refresher. Cuz I can tell you Jesus would have probably had a chuckle at this.
10 | Balsam Hameedo | 10155494893146509_10155495084536509 | Besides Muslims can not joke about Jesus or other prophets it is forbidden totally and god promise to punishes any one does such action either Jesus or Moses or Abraham all Muslims love  them and believe them it all in Quran, the book that you think teaches violence No it teaches us about life ages ago and all about other nations and religions  the ones from god same one we worship the same God Jesus talk about So stop accusing Quran and you never read it !!!!!
11 | Charlene Armstrong | 10155494893146509_10155494920121509 | To be honest it looks more like how He is described in the Bible, rather than the long haired fair skinned images that people have been floating around for years. I'm a devoted Christian by the way.
12 | Devin Higgins | 10155494893146509_10155495074371509 | I wonder how everyone would feel if someone defaced Lincoln's face in his memorial.. I mean yeah, there are those who don't believe in Christ and yeah Jesus isn't enshrined as a national  monument, but still it's all about respect..
13 | Balsam Hameedo | 10155494893146509_10155495031106509 | Do you know that Jesus peace up on him born in the summer because in the story of his birth , God told Maria his mother to eat dates the fruit when she was in pain giving birth to prophet Jesus  , and dates grow and ripe in the summer . Later it has been discovered that dates help the body to give more of the birth hormones that help in the birth of the baby and make it more easier
14 | Fern Car | 10155494893146509_10155495115701509 | CNN I am not surprised you posted this, you after all feel the same way as Hillary Clinton does about Catholics. Clinton News Network you make me sick.  Post a picture of Mohamed, oh, I guess you won't because you can only ridicule Jesus.

Atlanta star Donald Glover will portray Lando Calrissian "in his formative years as a scoundrel on the rise" in the upcoming Han Solo Star Wars movie.

I know why he is doing a candidate write in. He thinks he is smart. But not smarter than Jack Bo. He is doing the write in so regardless of who wins, he will be able to criticize that winner. That way he keeps his job as a criticizing critic. His write in candidate has no chance of winning.

5 | Bird Heaven | 10155494781766509_10155494800236509 | Just hours after Hillary Clinton dodged a question at the final presidential debate about charges of "pay to play" at the Clinton Foundation, a new batch of WikiLeaks emails surfaced with stunning charges that the candidate herself was at the center of negotiating a $12 million commitment from King Mohammed VI of Morocco.One of the more remarkable parts of the charge is that the allegation came from Clinton's loyal aide, Huma Abedin, who described the connection in a January 2015 email exchange with two top advisers to the candidate, John Podesta and Robby Mook.Abedin wrote that "this was HRC's idea" for her to speak at a meeting of the Clinton Global Initiative in Morocco in May 2015 as an explicit condition for the $12 million commitment from the king."She created this mess and she knows it," Abedin wrote to Podesta and Mook.The "mess" refers in part to the fact that the three Clinton advisers were discussing the possibility of the former secretary of state pulling out of speaking at the May 2015 event because it was happening one month after the official launch of her presidential campaign and could raise more questions about her role at the foundation.In April 2015, Politico reported the Clinton Foundation was accepting a "major donation" of at least $1 million from a Moroccan government-owned company, OCP, a phosphate exporter. Politico added that an official at the foundation said it was "unlikely" Hillary would attend the May 2015 event, just weeks after the April launch of her campaign.

22 | Edgar Ibanez | 10155494781766509_10155494898126509 | Dear America,              Hi! It's been a long time we've been friends. And yes we called each other "Brothers". We fought side by side and ready to die for each other during WWII. I will not forget when you helped me out during the strongest typhoon I appreciate it. But lately I realized you have taken our friendship for granted. I welcome you here in my place for free. If you want to stay go ahead. There is no requirement needed. If you want to visit me more often i am happy. But i was wondering. How come if i wanted to visit you i needed to pay a visa? If i want to stay and live there you require me to take an English exam? I do not require you to take a Filipino exam. My place is infested with drug problem and you criticized me instead of helping me out. You know like sharing technology and stuff. China has taken one of my island and he's bullying me. I won my case in the international court. As much as i wanted to fight for my right. I do not know or have doubts if you will fight with me again side by side just like old times and ready to die for each other. So since i have doubts with your kind of friendship I decided to be friends with China. And oh boy! To my surprised. He is not the bad guy I thought he is. Instead of criticizing me. He is now helping me build rehab centers and we have agreed to help each other economically. I am not leaving you for old times sake. I am just now limiting our friendship. I guess that's what really happens when you take an old friend for granted. Your little brown brother, Philippines PS I am thinking of charging you also for a visa and to take Filipino exam should you wish to visit or stay.

A fire destroyed Katherine’s family home. So she found a controversial, but legal, way to help. What do you think about her decision? Hear her story on #ThisIsLife with Lisa Ling Sun night.

1 | Russ Waldron | 10155494714401509_10155494729201509 | Easy to judge, hard to understand. But there are other options. In the end no matter if you agree or not you should care about her as a fellow human.
2 | Matthaios Ghanim | 10155494714401509_10155494755926509 | I left Iraq to Syria in 2007. Despite the fact that my passport was stamped "forbidden to work". I managed to work and support my family. the I arrived to the U.S in 2009 with just $200. 7 years later, I now live in a house and almost graduating from EWU with a bachelor in electrical engineering. Neither me nor any female in my family prostituted. We just worked hard. This is nothing but a petition from the CNN to accept this degrading job for women as an option. Yet, CNN thinks that Trump is a misogynistic moron. Frankly, it is Hillary and her supporters who are misogynistic morons.
3 | Monique Moreno | 10155494714401509_10155494722921509 | Wow! Other options my dear. Work hard for what you want & never give up ur pride
4 | Yvette Cathers | 10155494714401509_10155494746606509 | Once a woman looks at her sexuality as a trade-able commodity, that's how she's going to always use it.  This kind of woman ruins a marriage and makes life a living hell.
5 | Steven Rickert | 10155494714401509_10155494777326509 | It's her life and she can do what she wants. I don't care one way or another. That's what's wrong with most people always complaining about how someone else lives their life.
6 | James Johansen | 10155494714401509_10155494785101509 | people are jelly, this girl is going to get quite a bit of cash for 15 minutes of laying on her back.. Sure she only gets one virginity but how many females threw it away one some mistake guy that lasted 2 minutes and regret the decision..
7 | Aaron Lucero | 10155494714401509_10155494793031509 | Get it mami! Get that money.. you could lose it for free in the back seat of a beat up Chevy s-10.. so marinate on that people.. she's gonna get paid for 1x smashing.. I wish I could sell my dick for a house.. I wouldn't think twice..
8 | Bernadette Vargas | 10155494714401509_10155494804026509 | This is life... This is garbage!  CNN why are you doing a report on prostitution like its something new? This story is a worthless waste of time. She's no different than all the other prostitutes who all have their reasons for selling their bodies. Today she's selling herself for her family and tomorrow to pay her cell phone bill. The virginity factor is misogynistic bs! #hotgarbage

11 | Ricky J Mcgruder | 10155494714401509_10155494932856509 | this is why i do not want to bring any kids in this world. you have a man who is so desprate for sex with a virgin that he is willing to pay 400,000 for a women nothing about or does not even know if she good in bed,bad hyiene or has a std. men are the most nasty disgusting creature ever. they’ll pay to have sex with a alien or animal if they could.

13 | Abed Mohammed | 10155494714401509_10155494777006509 | Regardless of her reasons, I think there're other options besides selling your virginity. Your virginity is your dignity, once it's gone, then I don't know what to tell you 🤔😔
14 | Yaroslav Zaitsev | 10155494714401509_10155495084641509 | Just out of sheer curiosity... WHO will pay her money? So far these "virginity auctions" have proven to be a complete disaster for women auctioning off their virginity... that is... it was typically bid by arab nationals from places like dubai and ONLY for confirmed virgins who look like 10/10... and after finding out who won bids... each and every single woman participating in this farce has backed out of that arrangement only to try and sell her virginity again and again and again with money offered halving itself with every year over 18. Now what I would like to know is .... who would want to offer her money when other women are giving it away for free and "collectors" only go for the priced stuff like a tall beautiful slender super model looking girl form a place like brazil with a hour glass figure....

17 | Ricky J Mcgruder | 10155494714401509_10155494886206509 | I agree. and i can’t believe men are willing to pay 400,000 thousand for a women who might not be good in bed and might have a bad female odor. when they could pay more beatiful,sexy,smarter, and experience women 2,000,1,000 or at least 5,000 at the most.

In all likelihood as dynamic as at times during the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962.“At this time, the DEFCON Warning System feels that an increase to DEFCON 3 would be a prudent move.”Russian citizens have been encouraged to find bomb shelters and gas masks today, as state-sponsored infomercials on television gave out guidelines on how people should prepare for a nuclear attack.President Vladimir Putin meanwhile has ordered the evacuation of 40 million people in a military drill.He also transferred nuclear-capable Iskander ballistic missiles to one of its strategic Baltic regions last week, in what officials claim was part of regular military manoeuvres.However many world leaders fear the moves are being carried out in preparation for war.The conspiracy theory site warned citizens to prepare for any potential conflict, saying: “This is a very sensitive situation which has the potential to spiral out of control.

22 | Peter Nault | 10155494714401509_10155494895441509 | What do I think about it? It's prostitution. A profession that has latched itself to every era of human evolution. Women making a profit off what God gave them. Like most of us do everyday with the brain God gave us, our hands that can manipulate tools and our feet that allow us to stand in front of a machine for 8 hours. Woman are fighting for their rights and this is one of their sacred rights. Freedom to do what they please with their own body. Feminists will argue that it's a profession propped up by men who have given women no other choice and propagate these activities by continuing to offer up cash in exchange for sex. If there was no demand there would be no supply. I see it as a chicken or the egg dilemma. Did a stimulated man first decide to offer a starving woman a chunk of meat in exchange for sex or did an opportunistic woman take advantage of a lascivious nomad in exchange for a free meal. It's an integral part of a woman's natural instinct to find a man who can provide for her and the offspring that will soon follow. Prostitution is a twisted distortion of instinctual behaviours brought on by necessity, greed, loneliness or a bit of all three.

4 | Robert Arnold | 10155494651441509_10155494977356509 | So much talk about Alexander Hamilton lately Alexander Hamilton was a queen 18th century terminology for gay homosexual why don't they talk more about that you would think the lgbtq community would be upset.
5 | Chris Gable | 10155494651441509_10155494666136509 | Another alternate reality: What if the guy who could have won 1 million didn't have his mouth stuffed with peanut butter when he tried to answer the question of who shot Alexander Hamilton?
6 | Joe Yergey | 10155494651441509_10155494687596509 | I think we should send The Flash back to change the timeline. Maybe if we're lucky, enough things will change so we'll get a decent candidate to vote for in this election.
7 | Toni Velagic | 10155494651441509_10155494727606509 | Random fact: Aaron Burr is my 1st cousin, 9 times removed.  His grandfather, Daniel Burr was my 9-times great-grandfather on my dad's (Brian Wheeler) side.

9 | Joe Young | 10155494651441509_10155494701896509 | This is a great read. Although rough around the edges and more of a "common man" take, forgive the length: For those of you who wonder why so many of us are voting for Trump- I think this sums it up pretty good! For What It's Worth Department: Try this. This came from the Advocate (our local paper) and I am sharing it because it is exactly how most of us feel about Trump. The Media just doesn’t get it....they can't believe that people are so angry that they can no longer be manipulated! Millions of trump supporters feel this way about Donald J. Trump.....We don't care if the guy swears... or how many times he's been married...or who he voted for, or what his income tax return shows. We want the problems fixed. Yes, he's an egomaniac, but we don't care. We know he's not a racist, or all the other things the liberal media is trying to label him with. We know he's raised a good family, and that says a lot about him.The country is a mess because politicians suck, the Republican Party is two faced & gutless, and illegals are everywhere and Muslims are openly trying to hurt this country and make the civilized world adjust to them. We want it all fixed!We don't care that Trump is crude, we don't care that he has changed positions, we don't care that he fights with Megan Kelly, Rosie O'Donnell, and so many of the elected establishment. We don't care that Rubio, Ryan, the Bush's, and so many other top old and new Republicans refuse to endorse him for their own selfish reasons, and we know what they are. We don't care that he doesn't know the name of some Muslim terrorists, we don't care that he tried some businesses that didn't work out.This country is weak, bankrupt, our enemies are making fun of us, we are being invaded by illegals, we are becoming a nation of victims, where every Tom, Ricardo and Hasid is a special group with special rights to a point where we don't even recognize the country we were born and raised in, AND WE JUST WANT IT FIXED. And TRUMP is the only guy who seems to understand what the people want.We're sick of politicians, sick of the Democratic and Republican Party. We're angry about the Iran deal, the budget, treatment of Israel, military weakness, lobbyists, special interests, overpaid politicians with their self serving bills and back room deals, trade deals, loss of jobs, manipulated economic numbers, businesses fleeing, and even the phony pay for play Clinton Foundation.Americans are no longer going to be fooled, and the movement is out to change the direction we're taking. Trump may not be a saint, but he doesn't have lobbyist money holding him, he doesn't have political correctness restraining him, and all you know is that he has been very successful, a good negotiator, he has built a lot of things, he's flexible, and he's also not a politician. And he says he'll fix it. And we believe him because he is too much of an egotist to be proven wrong or looked at and called a liar.Public service has become elected greed. This may be our only chance to have a non-politician, despite his flaws, try and correct the mess, at least for 4 years. We must take the shot, because the consequences of putting Hillary Clinton in office are frightening. There is a tidal wave happening, and it's going to overcome much of what's happened to this country

You read about them in history books that men wrote years ago. Men who talked with them walked with them and fought with them. And you believe they existed. Yet when it comes to Jesus Christ. Everyone wants to call down fake or fairy tale on him. Jesus Christ was a man who said he was the son of God. He proved it by doing many supernatural miracles and feats. He had several disciples who he also called friends. Who walked talked and wrote about him in a historical book call the Bible. But somehow Aaron burr and Alexander Hamilton have no problem gaining you guys trust. But when it comes to Jesus Christ nooooo MOST OF YOU WOULD RATHER BELIEVE IN A GIANT MAGICAL BOOTY BOUNCING WHALE OVER JESUS CHRIST!!! SMH😞😞😞😞😞

Yes, "sharenting" is a thing, and many parents do it
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Russ Waldron | 10155494596706509_10155494700766509 | I've never had a problem with people that create a profile to share life events for their kids. First steps, first day of school, riding a bike. These are all cool things that social media can help share with friends and family. The people I have a problem with are the ones that create a profile in their child's name and then "speak" for their child in that profile. Expressing opinions and views that you know are not the child's and that are posted so that the parent can hide behind their kids profile or use that profile to instigate arguments or division that they don't have the guts to do under their own name. It happens plenty and it's crap.
2 | Gerald Kramlich III | 10155494596706509_10155494608216509 | Do: Post joyful pictures of them at play and positive comments reflecting your love of them.Don't: Post naked pictures and any questions on where the nearest fire house is to drop them off... or drown them.
3 | Benjamin Haden | 10155494596706509_10155494615491509 | People are really talking about Donald Trump & the election on a post that has nothing to do with a the election. The post could say "I love pizza!" and y'all would be talking about the election.
4 | Jessica Roqueta | 10155494596706509_10155494608346509 | Basically don't share photos of your children without clothes. And how did this turn political...

11 | Michael Williams | 10155494596706509_10155494607951509 | Why don't CNN News run their own Hillary vs Trump poll here on Facebook. It takes a few seconds to set up.

3 | Joseph O'Connell | 10155494535346509_10155494535726509 | CNN is in Hillary's pocket. CNN is owned by AT&T/Time Warner, which donated to Hillary's campaign. Corruption runs deep in the Clinton camp.

People are cattle...open the gate and follow each other. Donald is not one of those cattle, and that is exactly what this corrupt nation needs.

There are new screen time limits for your kids set by the American Academy of Pediatrics

1 | Cap Chris | 10155494458896509_10155494464896509 | The day I die is the day someone else will tell me what to do and what to do for my kids.
2 | Andrea Beaulieu | 10155494458896509_10155494475471509 | Screen time is bad for you no matter what age. I am 33 and decided to go back to school full time last year. At my last eye doctor appointment my vision drastically changed. My eye doctor determined it's because of all the extra screen time. Now I have to wear readers with my contacts.

4 | Lacey Jones | 10155494458896509_10155494588836509 | CNN is being very misleading about using the word 'rules'. This is simply what they recommend. Its actually a pretty common question,  how much is too much. So you ask the internet or your pediatrician (on the first kid anyways lol). Well they refer back to these set of guidelines. No one is coming in your house turning your tvs off. They are just giving you information. Do with it what you want.

Many Bernie Sanders' supporters are asking themselves this fall, "Are you selling out if you support Hillary Clinton?"
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Tena Thorne | 10155494375961509_10155494387046509 | I don't know of any Bernie people that are willing to vote for her, especially after the WikiLeaks revelations. She cares only for herself.
2 | Amber Nicole | 10155494375961509_10155494396766509 | I'm a Bernie Sanders supporter who will be changing her party declaration to anything BUT democrat and will NOT be voting for Hilary on November 8th.
3 | Mark van Kranenburg | 10155494375961509_10155494383651509 | No, you aren't selling out. Sanders and Clinton voted together 93% on all the bills during their shared Senate years. Also, Sanders has always said, even during the primary, that Clinton on her worst day will make a much better President than any Republican on their worst. And he had a large influence on the platform. As he himself said: "Our job now must be to see our progressive platform implemented by a Democratic Senate, a Democratic House and a Hillary Clinton presidency."
4 | Dylan Tepper | 10155494375961509_10155494384506509 | He literally began his campaign, saying he would support the democratic nominee. Look, I hate what happened, I wish he had won, but regardless he lost. Now if we fight to get Democrats into the senate, he will be the chairman of a significantly important senate committee, so work for that.
5 | Amanda Justice Loudon | 10155494375961509_10155494404276509 | I love Bernie and he was my choice. I am progressive and liberal and I agreed with him on many social issues. Trump will not get my vote. I will vote with Bernie as a democrat.
6 | Andy Cuse | 10155494375961509_10155494467461509 | Everyone keeps making fun of Trump for saying that things are rigged agenst him. The people should be reminded that Bernie Sanders said that the election was rigged agenst him during the primary.
7 | Audrey Dellas | 10155494375961509_10155494392301509 | *rolls eyes* you are selling out if you vote for anyone BUT Clinton. She's the only one who stands for the issues Bernie does, is the only one he supports, and is the only one running on a platform he helped create.
8 | Yaroslav Zaitsev | 10155494375961509_10155494398476509 | I remember when Bernie's supporters kept saying "feel the burn"... well they are indeed feeling a burn alright... to be promised so much and then it all went under the bus like a racoon splattered against the asphalt. The main issue is that people that rooted for that old coot legitimately wanted him to win. And then he sold out. His female fans sold out to Hillary... naturally... and majority of his male fans hate hillary with dire passion so would vote for anyone but her. Such a cliche...
9 | Michael Nagy | 10155494375961509_1793855884228113 | I'm a Trump supporter, but I feel sorry for Mr. Sanders.  He tried to run a honest and fair campaign on the issues and got railroaded by Hillary and the Democratic party.
10 | Randall Harrison | 10155494375961509_10155494422071509 | If you prefer a Clinton this is what your vote goes to:A suspended lawyer turned career politician, that was fired by her democratic boss for lying and unethical behavior. That CHEATED and lied to beat BERNIE SANDERS. That sold her office to the highest bidder for millions of dollars and then destroyed the evidence of her crimes by deleting 33,000 emails and "hammering" her phones and iPads. That orchestrated paying and training protesters to disrupt Sanders and Trump rally's, including paying bipolar individuals with a known history of violence. That's who you are supporting for President. The one Wikki Leaks is publishing evidence of corruption daily, including showing a "pay to play" for 12 million from Morocco today. She's scum!
11 | Robert Gottlieb | 10155494375961509_10155494377136509 | "The Bernie Sanders candidacy didn’t die a natural death — it was murdered. And the murder weapon has the fingerprints of the Washington Post all over it. The chairman of Amazon a Clinton ally owns The Washington Post.” http://nypost.com/2016/10/12/how-the-washington-post-killed-bernie-sanders-candidacy/
12 | Danny Hollier Jr. | 10155494375961509_1634199180212440 | Yep, they are. Hillary stole the primary from Bernie. The DNC rigged the election against him. If not for the bias and the super delegates, it likely would have been Bernie debating Trump two nights ago. Democrats need to ask themselves about future elections. What if it happens again? Do average Dem. voters have a voice in their own party anymore?
13 | Matt Caddell | 10155494375961509_1224661804263551 | Well, seeing as how she rigged the election against Bernie by colluding with the DNC and got the CNN town hall questions from Donna Brazile, voting for her would be selling out. She is bought and paid for by Wall Street as evidenced in released emails. #NeverHillary
14 | Brian Bj Satran | 10155494375961509_10155494497356509 | Yes,You're selling out.Everything Bernie and Trump has said about her is true. Bernie was really the only logical choice in this election and Hillary, Wasserman-Shultz, and CNN made sure he got screwed out of it.
15 | Allen Helmick | 10155494375961509_1634202083545483 | They have no where to go except to an Independent or Trump. Bernie sold his soul to the Democrats. She is everything he campaigned against yet he stands by her side. It's funny how he just recently bought a new house.....like I said. He sold his soul.....to the Devil of the Democrat party.
16 | Kemi Olatunji | 10155494375961509_1793872750893093 | Can any of the Bernie Sanders supporters vote for Hillary Clinton considering the revelations by the Wikileak on how the DOC rigged the primary election for her? They'll be so naive if they think Hillary Clinton will honour any of the promises she made to Bernie Sanders, taking cognisance of her track record on honesty.
17 | Kathy J Kennedy-Bell | 10155494375961509_1793864904227211 | If the Bernie Sanders supporters turn to vote for Trump, you will lose everything that Sanders supported. Sanders fought for his supporters when doing the democratic platform at the convention. He still is fighting to get Clinton elected so progressive issues are dealt with. You may not be happy about the situation, you may not completely trust Clinton and you may not even care much for Hillary Clinton but you have to know that Bernie Sanders will be there along side Clinton fighting for you. If you trust Bernie to do the progressive agenda then trust him to do the job of helping Clinton with the issues of Americans!!
18 | Bill Sortino | 10155494375961509_10155494396326509 | As a die hard Sanders Progressive it is hard to vote for Hillary. But there is an issue is such importance that I have no alternative. Hate and potential Fascism are far closer to our lives than we are ready to admit and those of us who have had family in the last real (not political for corporate interests) war, the second WW, we know what this type of mentality produces. From what I hear and read on the Progressive Blogs and sites, there are few who will not vote for her. The polls are a fake and conducted strictly for the media hype.
19 | Richard Blanchard | 10155494375961509_1634206400211718 | Major corporations own Hillary Clinton. If Sanders supporters are serious about breaking the hold of these powerful entities on our government, then Donald J. Trump is their choice for President.
20 | Dan Lubahn | 10155494375961509_10155494468306509 | Never trust anyone that's made a fortune as a "public servant". Rich from corporate sponsors. You don't get paid millions of dollars legitimately just for speeches...
21 | Joshua Jaskolka | 10155494375961509_1634214763544215 | So buying into bernies rigged govt speeches like I did, and getting fired up about change and than finding out the only thing that was rigged was his campaign by the DNC and just because your a 100% liberal you vote Clinton over Johnson? When I'm old and gray or even dead and people are at my funeral they will be saying I was real as it gets. You bought into this  rigged bs and none of you liberals were as real as the republicans so they DNC knows for future elections they can rig it for whoever they want and they know none of y'all wouldn't do anything about it. The republicans were real, and had class if they didn't like trump they weren't voting for him the stayed true to themselves and I respect them for that. The liberals showed they were as mindless as everyone already knew. For you even buying into this dem and repub bs your already walking with the sheep. Being a democrat or republican is on its way to extinction. It is impossible to rate someone statistically by them saying their one or the other. The elections need to be voted not be what someone is but what someone's willing to do for America. Too many republicans vote republican because their parents were republicans and they have 0 knowledge of these candidates and all liberals vote liberals with below 0 knowledge of anything. Liberals are so gone in voting that the majority knows absolutely nothing but they know their voting Clinton. But once we get away from voting for conservatives and liberals it will get interesting because then we will have to do our home work.
22 | David Sayre | 10155494375961509_1634242053541486 | Wasn't the Democratic primary proven to had been rigged, yet the media continues to complain about us being hacked, rather focus on their star child Hillary Clinton cheating her way. It should be #berniesanders in this election. So instead im voting for #donaldtrump
23 | Daniel Warstadt | 10155494375961509_1793867077560327 | I voted for Bernie in California's Primary back in June, and I have already cast my ballot for Hillary via mail-in ballot for this November. Bernie does not want Trump to be president, he is fine with Hillary Clinton. When Democrats win back the Senate, Bernie gets to be head of the budget committee.
24 | Ben Esslinger | 10155494375961509_10155494397366509 | I voted for Bernie Sanders in the primary, and I believe in his progressive agenda. He's going to be more successful furthering that agenda working with a President Clinton than with a President Trump.
25 | Keith Miller | 10155494375961509_1793861510894217 | For those who are debating because of personality, it's not like you are inviting them into your home, you don't have to be friends with them.  Maybe what we need now is a hard-on ball buster.  Maybe not.  But I'd rather go with the ball buster than the proven liar any day.

Bridget Anne Kelly, Chris Christie's former deputy chief of staff, finally broke her silence saying Christie knew about the lane closures leading to the George Washington Bridge nearly a month beforehand
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Vicki Brown | 10155494286886509_10155494298931509 | Christie should go down in history as one of the worst governors ever.  No wonder he supports Trump - they share the same evil, vindictive nature.
2 | Cheryl Darling Stewart | 10155494286886509_10155494333086509 | That fat freak made regular moms and dads sit in traffic, having kids to pick up after school, knowing that if u dont get them at a certain time u will be charged extra, or worse they will call child services cause u left them at the daycare too long....and this traitor laughed in the faces of the newyorkers and lied.....stabbed them in the back and had them suffer....u fat f......
3 | Jose Alarcon | 10155494286886509_10155494302656509 | I love it, all this republican hypocrites and their champion thrump, are the biggest band of corrupt degenerates this country have seen in years, and finally they're getting the recompense they deserve.
4 | Michael Rushing | 10155494286886509_10155494310356509 | Nah ! Christi Lied!  Well he's been so far Up Donald Trumps A$$ , he wouldn't know the Truth if it Bit Him ! I can remember Christi doing the Same thing as Donald Trump,  saying it's All Lies ! Yeah Right!
5 | Michael Brennan | 10155494286886509_10155494315376509 | He should be charge with murder because someone lost their life. EMTs couldn't get to the guy in time to save em
6 | Dave Mayhugh | 10155494286886509_10155494347636509 | Finally the TRUTH comes out, and proves that Chris Christy is nothing more than a petty liar. I like how they are now calling it a "traffic study", how quaint. Deputy chief of staff had approval from Christy a month before the event happened, and Christy said he knew nothing about it. WOW
7 | Michael James | 10155494286886509_10155494296596509 | First question I would ask, is who is she voting for? Took this lady this long to break her silence. If she knows Christie knew. That means she knew and is just as guilty as those involved.
8 | Joe Goodman | 10155494286886509_10155494306146509 | Wanna bet there are empty shelves Little Debbie snack cakes from grocery stores 10 mile radius around the governors mansion?Christie KNOWS they don't have them in prison so he's eating them now.
9 | Cindy Schulz | 10155494286886509_10155494526146509 | Christie is going down! Just like Trump thinks his S--t don't stink and he can get by with everything just because who he is; well guess what something smells! I think you will be going down the drain just like Trump there Christie ole boy!
10 | Carolina Endara | 10155494286886509_10155494639621509 | This was sooo obvious, he lost trust after this problem. how politicians can play this way with American people!  It's incredible! just in America!
11 | Chris Frisch | 10155494286886509_10155495065706509 | The most corrupt politician to ever run for President with leaked emails confirming hate for Catholics, rigged elections, taking donations from foreign governments and inciting real violence at opponents rally's with proof for all...and CNN is covering...Chris Christie.  Are you guys just sitting over there getting baked out of your minds or what?
12 | Buster McGuire | 10155494286886509_10155494542751509 | Hillary also had and watched 4 AMERICANS tortured and murdered. But you freaking retarded hillary supporters are worried about a traffic jam.  I guess you don't work?? If you did you would see a traffic jam everyday.
13 | Lalopua Young | 10155494286886509_10155494541401509 | Good that your standing up for yourself especially when you got thrown under the bus like the way Christie fired you an went on TV and say those awful things towards you.And he's planning on running for the presidency in 4 years.
14 | Lalopua Young | 10155494286886509_10155494980066509 | Come on people what would this woman gain by this kind of action she had nothing to gain but still she was used as excuse for Christie because the Mayor of the other side of town did not endorse his running for the presidency so please before you make rude comments towards this woman check your facts.
15 | Angie Japka | 10155494286886509_10155494476141509 | This is obviously a political hit job by the left. She held out all this time with the truth until someone blackmailed/bribed/bullied her into lying. That's how the left works. How about some investigation on Emailgate and pay-for-play scandal? This administration is so corrupt
16 | Juan Carlos Bonilla | 10155494286886509_10155494458341509 | Of course he knew...really?!! Too bad Marco Rubio froze in that debate..this is something he should've rubbed in Christie's face when he said Marco was repeating himself!!
17 | Dustin Pease | 10155494286886509_10155494591451509 | CNN will report that some guy shut down a lane of traffic but they won't report on how Hillary let 4 Americans die because she was tired and wanted sleep. Worse media in the world!!!
18 | Brian Shales | 10155494286886509_10155494459601509 | OMG WikiLeaks just released Clinton involved with a 12 million dollar deal for her foundation with Morocco and you try distract with this garbage? Stop being a corporate puppet for once and show some guts for crying out load. That's what the people want from you not distractions..
19 | Ann Johnson | 10155494286886509_10155494375811509 | This is why Christie should have been impeached and removed from office. The man was so immature and deluded that he would cause a traffic jam, to get back at someone that angered him. Not only were people inconvenienced but it delayed Paramedics from reaching people that were in need of life saving medical assistance.
20 | Rene Quintero Timms | 10155494286886509_10155494432281509 | This guy closes a bridge and you Hillary supporters go crazy....Hillary Riggs elections,calls blacks super predators,calls hispanic rallies taco bowls,hates catholics,wants an open border,left unsecured confidential emails open and you still.vote for her!!  You people really are sheep!!!   Lmao
21 | Erik O'Neil Dryden | 10155494286886509_10155494356726509 | CNN refusing to explore WikiLeaks revelations is why it is RIGGED, CNN and the establishment government are OWNED by the same corporations, WAKE UP RETARDED AMERICA
22 | Sonu Gill | 10155494286886509_10155494918211509 | That look Christie had when he stood behind Trump at one of his rallies... I find myself making that face frequently during this election period...
23 | Brian Hendricks | 10155494286886509_10155494579341509 | Oh no!  A bridge was closed for a little while a long time ago!   Everything else going on (voter fraud, corruption, failed forrign policy, voter intimidation, etc) just pales in comparison to that bridge!
24 | Brenda Luckritz Philbrick | 10155494286886509_10155494321486509 | Ummm duh!!! We always knew that he was hiding something!!
25 | Timothy Ellison | 10155494286886509_10155494461736509 | Yep there's the crookedness for Christy to fit in with the Trump campaign. He probably told Trump that so he could be part of the campaign. That's the type of stuff Trump would admire! And Do himself. LMAO!

3 | Lola Ola | 10155494172736509_10155494236446509 | Fox News Channel led all networks with 11.3 million viewers during the debate. ABC had 11 million, NBC had 10.4 million, CBS had 10.1 million, CNN had 8.7 million, Fox broadcasting had 6.6 million and MSNBC had 5.5 million,
4 | Jonathan Buttall | 10155494172736509_10155494911381509 | As this page shows, science articles should never have comment sections. Many Americans don't know what science even is and very few comments here had any relevance.

6 | Andrew Keen | 10155494172736509_10155494200996509 | Under Obama, more people in poverty, more people on food stamps, lowest labor force participation rate since 1972, household median income is down, a GDP growth under 2%, ISIS was able to flourish, NOT one country can be identified to have better relations under Obama, the National Debt has DOUBLED under Obama, race relations are at an all-time low etc. etc. O, wait, Obama does hold the record for most reality show appearances by a sitting President!

And  with the two mainstream moronic candidates, it's not gonna change anytime soon. Our government has lost its ability to give and take. Just look at how congress and the senate operate.
2 | William Wolf | 10155493910961509_10155493916646509 | What point is that CNN??? Obama is more than ready to borrow more money for welfare from the Chinese Communists?? :joy:Duterte obviously doesn't need a middle man, he knows exactly where China is.The Chinese are more than capable of doing us harm, their soldiers are faster, better trained, equipped and they also have "allies." Do we really want and need nuclear WWIII?? Don't believe the hype peeps, Apple Inc has too much money invested in China. They only sell their crap in the States, and keep their money offshore. The only reason that our military still functions is because we invade weaker than China and Russia countries, borrow money from whomever we possibly can while tax the life out of the taxable. Now, let's talk about pu.... cats lol

International law says that China is wrong on this. US is enforcing international law and ensuring its own interests. China also has the right to assert their interests and influence in the region; they just have to obey the law while doing so! Simple enough?
5 | Thomas J Osburg | 10155493910961509_10155493928271509 | What a waste of time. For some crappy bit of ocean and some crappy Islands. Hasn't the US created enough instability to last generations in the Middle East and Europe these past few decades.

8 | Ralph Kristian Duran Bautista | 10155493910961509_10155494407461509 | waste of time? well, lemme tell you this. most of the products you use at home pass through these waters. if you let China impose itself there, they could charge all the passing ships and that fee would be passed on to the consumers. that's only ONE thing that could happen. so tell me again if it's a waste of time.

15 | Benjo Precioso Salgado | 10155493910961509_10155494970701509 | Understanding Duterte’s Position on South China Sea vs. The Interest of the West The South China Sea area is actually more important to the US and Europe than to the Philippines. Lying in that vast body of water is an international waterway where 5 Trillion US Dollars in global trade passes every year going to the Western countries. If China controls the whole stretch of the waterway, including overflight thereon, global trade to Europe and US will become more expensive. The adverse impact of it to the west will be very costly. This explains why US and Europe were supportive of the Philippines and they were all urging China to respect the decision of the Permanent Arbitral Tribunal favoring Philippines on our claim. Duterte’s position on the issue however, is not subservient to the West. When he declared that he is pursuing an independent foreign policy, he is bent on negotiating with China directly instead of becoming confrontational as the West wants him to be. Duterte is aware that our court victory is an empty one for lack of enforcement mechanisms on the decision. Neither the US nor the west and even any of the UN instrumentalities can help the Philippines enforce that decision. It solely relies on China’s recognition for which it has already repeatedly rejected. If we decide to confront China by force, which country will come to help us? The NATO military arsenal cannot be stretched to the South china sea because its forces are confined to Europe in an attempt to contain the Russian military flexing in Europe and mid-east. Germany will never come to aid the Philippines because of its trading relations with China. France will be a reluctant potential ally because of the external threats it has been facing. Great Britain will never send its military planes to the Philippines because it has been courting China for trading relations as an aftermath of the Brexit. If we use diplomacy, particularly by bringing the issue to the halls of the UN and asking the members to enjoin China into accepting the decision, we should take note of the fact that more than half of the countries in the UN are having trading relations with China for which they cannot afford to severe ties with, much less with ASEAN. What we see here is purely “politics among nations” at work and Philippines must be careful on its approach and for which Duterte has shown a great deal of expertise in terms of diplomatic maneuvering. Given that scenario, we are left with US and Japan at our side to help us in our confrontation with China. However, America is heavily indebted to China and the level of its trading relations with China outweighs any possibility for any war between the two. But the more serious question which should bug us is this: Is US really a true ally in this conflict? When Duterte brought out the issue on Bud Dajo Massacre in 1906, he wanted the Filipinos to revisit our alliance with the US in the light of his intention to adopt an independent foreign policy. During World War II in 1941, we fought side by side with America where we lost more than a million Filipino lives. It was never our war, yet we were invaded by Japan because America was with us. After the war, US government helped Japan in its reconstruction efforts financially and economically until it became the world’s second largest economy next to US until to date. What happened to the Philippines as an ally which gave up more than a million lives defending America? While a miniscule of assistance were given to us since World War II, these were handed out with strings attached and were designed to continue US interference in our internal affairs. Now, America and its allies in Europe want to use us again as a pawn to serve its economic and political interest in the South China Sea – to keep that international water way navigation-free. On the other hand, our main interest in the area is fishing right as well as exploiting the rich mineral resources underneath. From all indications, China is mainly interested in the control over that stretch of international waterway militarily as part of its hegemony over the region. Duterte believes that by negotiating directly with China using the decision of the court as our leverage, we can get most of what we want. However, Duterte believes that we cannot successfully negotiate with China if we remain under the shadow of Uncle Sam. Hence, the need to project an independent image to convince China that we are negotiating with them in good faith sans any influence from the West. This left US and Europe in quandary on how to protect their interest over South China Sea with the revolting posture of Duterte. The only way is to get Duterte out and replace him with a pro west Philippine President. This partly explains why the West is anti Duterte and all forces including traitors from our country are now in global conspiracy to get him out of the presidency by using all sorts of issues to discredit him, e.g. his foul mouth, extra judicial killings, hitler image, and many more to come. For all of us Filipinos, including Anti Duterte forces, the President has just expressed a long overdue rebuke on the US shabby treatment to our country as an ally in the Asia Pacific. He wants US and Europe to treat us well as co-equal. America owed our country big time based on historical accounts and Duterte wants US to realize that and pay our country even with interest. If US made Japan as the second largest economy in the world post world war II and after all the damage Japan has inflicted US and our land, why didn’t US help Philippines as much as Japan if our country is a true ally? Sanamagan. Filipinos should realize that there is more to the issues of EJK and the foul mouth of the President as systematically magnified by the West and their collaborators in our country, including both local and international media. We should “look at the forest, not just the trees”. The West wants Duterte out of the presidency for his anti-west sentiments and for his refusal to protect the interest of the west – that’s the crux of the matter and that’s what’s behind all these shenanigans. It’s a grand conspiracy to discredit him internationally because of the massive support he enjoys from our country’s masses. It’s a clear imperialistic design concocted by the West and swallowed hook line and sinker by political prostitutes and opportunists of this country to serve their selfish interests – a grave act of betrayal against the sovereignty of our country.

He isn't going to precision Airstrike anything. He will drop bombs on everyone and everything.

1 | John McAuliffe | 10155493738891509_10155493745391509 | Apple has long since ceased to be a technology company, and has become a marketing company that sells products of some sort. You scarcely buy new tech, but you do buy their brand
2 | Joe Yergey | 10155493738891509_10155493809971509 | Android is a superior product. Buying Apple is like buying Jordans. You're only paying for the name. As far as advanced tech, there's so many different companies manufacturing Androids that the intense competition leads to cutting edge products. A good example is the HTC Vibe. A phone with virtual reality built in. In the end it comes down to your preference. If you want to be trendy and  flashy, get an iPhone. If you want cutting edge tech, do your homework and select from a large group of companies that use Android as their OS.

5 | Chris Frank | 10155493738891509_10155494230776509 | Apple is kinda going to crap ever since Steve jobs passed. He wouldn't of allowed any of the products until they are perfect. For sure wouldn't allow the iPhone 7 design to be the exact same as the 6 and for sure not of allowed the ugly bump from the camera. He wanted seamless, clean, ahead of the game products. Not this poo...
6 | Ronald Weidner | 10155493738891509_10155494126356509 | Apple is playing games like usual. Best we can all do is to quit being consumers in all honesty. Start making our own stuff. Especially with computers. We can make our own desktops and they'll have better performance than anything apple sells. I'm not sure about building smartphones and laptops ourselves. It's possible but it'll be a little more skills involved. Consumerism is our worst enemy.
7 | Victor Lee | 10155493738891509_10155494730771509 | Android users you got share with the company? We are just a consumer, why damaging others ppl brand just to prove yourself your mobile brand is better than others? Anyway Apple has no competitor but yet android love to compare Apple with them whenever android launch new phone but I don't see Apple compare with android because Apple understand both is different platform! Come on android users go compare your own competitors. Android have dozen of brands to choose from. Only idiots will chose Samsung because of branding but Apple market? The one and only, we want quality not quantity

17 | Bill Johnson | 10155493738891509_10155493751161509 | Well this is probably offensive to someone. But here it is. Yes it is a copy paste, but I think it is worth the read.An intriguing Ministry of Finance (MoF) report circulating in the Kremlin today says that elite Western bankers were “stunned/bewildered” a few hours ago after the Bank For International Settlements (BIS) registered a $1.8 billion transfer from the Clinton Foundation (CF) to the Qatar Central Bank (QCB) through the “facilitation/abetment” of JP Morgan Chase & Company (JPM)—and for reasons yet to be firmly established.According to this report, the Bank for International Settlements is the world’s oldest international financial organization and acts as a prime counterparty for central banks in their financial transactions; the Qatar Central Bank is the bank of that Gulf State nations government and their “bank of banks”; JP Morgan Chase & Company is the United States largest “megabank”; and the Clinton Foundation is an international criminal money laundering organization whose clients include the Russian mafia.With Hillary Clinton’s US presidential campaign Chairman John Podesta having longstanding ties to the Russian mafia and money laundering, this report continues, the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) maintains “complete/all times/all ways” surveillance of him and his criminal associates—including both Hillary Clinton and her husband, and former US President, Bill Clinton, and who are collectively designated as the “Clinton Crime Family”.On Saturday 15 October (2016), this report notes, the SVR reported to the MoF that Hillary Clinton and John Podesta met with JP Morgan Chase & Company CEO Jamie Dimon at Clinton’s Chappaqua Compound outside of New York City—and who, in 2009, both President Obama and Hillary Clinton allowed to break US laws by his, Dimon’s, being able to buy millions-of-dollars of his company’s stocks prior to the public being told his JP Morgan bank was receiving a Federal Reserve $80 billion credit line—and that caused JP Morgan’s stocks to soar and that have had an astonishing 920% dividend growth since 2010.Within 12 hours of the Hillary Clinton-John Podesta-Jamie Dimon meeting at the Chappaqua Compound, this report continues, the BIS registered the transfer of $1.8 billion from the Clinton Foundation to the Qatar Central Bank.To why the Clinton Foundation transferred this enormous sum of money to Qatar, this report explains, is due to the longstanding ties between this Islamic neo-patrimonial absolute monarchy and then US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton who “oversaw/managed” the “massive bribery scheme” that allowed this Gulf State nation to secure the 2022 World Cup—and that the Qataris were so appreciative of they donated millions to the Clinton Foundation, and incredibly, in 2011, gave former US President Bill Clinton $1 million for a birthday present—bringing Hillary Clinton’s total “cash grab” from these Persian Gulf sheiks of $100 million—all occurring as recently released secret emails revealed Hillary Clinton’s knowledge that both Qatar and Saudi Arabia were, and still are, funding ISIS.To what Jamie Dimon “related/said to” Hillary Clinton that caused her to suddenly transfer $1.8 billion to Qatar, this report notes, revolves around his JP Morgan bank being told by the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) in April (2016) that this “megabanks” master plan to save itself had “serious deficiencies” that could “pose serious adverse effects to the financial stability of the United States”.Two months after the FDIC’s warning letter to Jamie Dimon, in June (2016), this report says, he cryptically “sounded a warning” that the United States sub-prime auto loan bubble was nearing collapse and stated that “someone is going to get hurt”.Unbeknownst to the American people, MoF experts in this report explain, is that just 8 weeks ago multiple warnings began to be issued that the United States $1 trillion sub-prime auto loan bubble was beginning to collapse—and that this past week became so severe the Bank of America issued a recession warning telling its elite customers that “this market is scary”, and the British-based multinational banking and financial services company HSBC, likewise, issued a “Red Alert” warning all of its clients warning them to “prepare for a severe market crash”.With one of the first “victims/casualties” of this sub-prime auto loan bubble being the German global banking giant Deutsche Bank that is “nearing its doom” and laying off tens-of-thousands of it workers worldwide, this report grimly states, the American mainstream propaganda media is failing to allow the people of that nation to know the full extent of this looming catastrophe—who unlike Hillary Clinton who has just protected $1.8 billion of her wealth, will be left defenseless once again at the hands of their elite rulers.As Wikileaks secret Hillary Clinton emails have now proven that the US propaganda mainstream media is now totally controlled by her, and who continue their blackout on the “Clinton Crime Story of the Century”, this report continues, the absolutely horrifying statistics released this week showing that an astounding 35% of American who have been brutalized by the Obama-Clinton regime these past 8 years are so buried in debt they can no longer pay their bills is, likewise, being kept from these most innocent of peoples.And rather than the US propaganda mainstream media warning the American people of their economies looming destruction, this report concludes, they have, instead, begun a “systemic mainstream misinformation” campaign to manipulate the presidential election polls showing Hillary Clinton leading—but that stands opposed to actual (but unreported) polls showing Donald Trump leading.

CNN is therefore biased and untrustworthy. The facts speak for itself.Fact: CNN is in Hillary's pocket.Fact: CNN is trying to influence the outcome of this election.

1 | Richard Stewart | 10155493642536509_10155493654881509 | So it's kinda like what banks do with dye packs except if you are a bike thief you will be temporarily blinded and vomiting everywhere instead of dyed red. 😂😂😂
2 | Marc Raymond | 10155493642536509_10155494139056509 | I gave up on fancy security...nothing is foolproof and if you have a bond with your bike it's not worth it. Got myself a cheap secondary bike from Craigslist for commuting/locking in the city and keep my good bike for pleasure rides.
3 | Felicia Chase | 10155493642536509_10155493654681509 | I think putting a cop on a bike is a dangerous thing and never have agreed with this sort of patrolling horses also are a wrong way to police,How about walking the beat like in the old dayz
4 | Denis Manolache | 10155493642536509_10155493674366509 | The bike thief of the future, instead of cutting off the lock, will disassemble and reassemble the bike at the crime scene, in less than two minutes :)) now, let's see how you deal with this! :))
5 | Gary Vogt | 10155493642536509_10155493778931509 | I actually think the CNN news is protected with this stinky stuff. Sure has little truth to their political reporting making it stink.
6 | Beth Aranas | 10155493642536509_10155493893606509 | Good idea! Every time I walk to our Metrotown here in Burnaby,I always pass by bikes still tethered in the bike parking,2 were vandalized & missing each a wheel.Sad for the owners who became helpless bec of the fact that probably nobody witnessed the despicable act,so no witness to tell tales. I feel sorry for thise bike owners. I hope this innovation will push thru. Good luck.😊

8 | Wade Steele | 10155493642536509_10155493657116509 | Clinton Foundation honors the wife of a convicted Palestinian terrorist.***  “Hanan al-Hroub, whose husband was jailed for providing chemicals used in making bombs that killed Israelis, was invited to speak at a Clinton Global Initiative dinner.” Ruling: True.
9 | Angelo Morena | 10155493642536509_10155493709301509 | So . . it seems the Clintons took $12 million dollars from the King of Morocco . . King Mohammad VI . . in 2015.We learned this from an email . . sent from Hillary's assistant, Huma Abedin to John Podesta . . Podesta is Hillary's campaign manager.It is quite an eye-opener!It seems the Clinton Foundation 'forgot' to include this donation in their records.Huma wrote: "She (Hillary) created this mess and she knows it."
10 | Dee Marie | 10155493642536509_10155493647121509 | I'm surprised that would be legal. I'm sure someone will feel sorry for the thief and get this banned.

3 | Daniel Larsson | 10155493523546509_10155493541846509 | This poor excuse of a man has no idea of when to quit. It's going to be so sweet watching him go bankrupt and end up on the streets of NY begging for change in a year.
4 | Mark Mun | 10155493523546509_10155493525921509 | Barack Obama saying he'd have "the most transparent administration ever". Now he's mad that Wikileaks is going to make that happen.
5 | Monique Rousseau | 10155493523546509_10155493545171509 | CNN is also a loser. I wonder if they ever will become actual journalists instead of opinion writers force feeding us their BS all day long. Clinton is evil and liar in my opinion lol. 🙏🏻🇺🇸💯Trump!!
6 | Ron Moore | 10155493523546509_10155493541141509 | Hahahahaha! They're babies? Look who's kicking and crying again. Can't wait until November 8th when he learns he lost the presidency. He will have a raging manchild fit.
7 | Joshua Scott Laird | 10155493523546509_10155493620596509 | God forbid the president campaigns to protect everything he has accomplished. He doesn't need an idiot like you who would be a bull in a China shop destroying all of the progress that has been made.
8 | Edgar Gomez | 10155493523546509_10155493588301509 | Early voting!!! Don't wait to November 8th. Let's defeat this orange loser to take a message to the world that we stand up to bullies, ignorance, and bigotry. The message needs to be clear that we respect and support our woman.
9 | Ann Brown | 10155493523546509_10155493547876509 | Talking about himself again. He does this projection a lot. He has shown himself to be both a baby and is in the process of becoming said loser. Lol.
10 | Justin Robert | 10155493523546509_10155493548111509 | It's like he has a conversation with his conscience before each speech for material. This guy just projects everything he wonders about himself onto others. It's a huge tell.
11 | Donna Shell | 10155493523546509_10155493613851509 | Dump, people are coming together regardless of their differences to stop you! I don't like Clinton either, but you sir are far worst than her!
12 | Alyssa Beth Matthews | 10155493523546509_10155493584066509 | He is correct. Michelle Obama did start the " if you can't run your house, you can't run the White House"  statement that when viral. And now she is campaigning for her. This is why we need someone in office who is not part of the political " club ".
13 | Joy Moulter | 10155493523546509_10155493578696509 | Voting trump CNN is biased. Shocked they had to admit it looked bad for killery when the video of her telling people to incite violence at his rallies. Anyone considering voting for her needs to have their head examined. After all the lying, Wikileaks, deleted emails, Benghazi and smashing of phones I don't know how anyone could ever vote for her. I'm voting for trump because America needs a leader not any more clintons in the White House
14 | Brandon Kay Sann | 10155493523546509_10155493536881509 | Its scary to think that people like Donald Trump are allowed to be Presidential Candidates!
15 | Henry Lara II | 10155493523546509_901636489980309 | You can't even take care of a casino!! You can't win an Emmy but Obama can win a Nobel and 2 elections. More whining from the Donald.
16 | Mayra Luna-Rivera | 10155493523546509_10155493588536509 | Really!! What kind of loser is he?? Insulting ppl like is nothing. He has no self respect for no one. Ppl wake up he is going to the the destruction of this country. We sure don't need that kind of person running our country.
17 | Denny Alexander | 10155493523546509_10155493548541509 | I've come to the conclusion that donald trump is DEADPOOL,  and his hands are still going through puberty because someone chopped off his original hands.
18 | Antonio L. Stewart | 10155493523546509_723418084487379 | Can someone wake me up when this election is over and Hillary Clinton is our President-Elect? That way, this Trump nightmare can be over once and for all...sort of!!!
19 | Erik Guie | 10155493523546509_1839644656281434 | Believe me, if Trump weren't such a dangerous psychopath, The Obamas would not be out campaigning this much. Believe me.  Sad! I'm hearing people say things. Big league.
20 | Frank Goodman Sr | 10155493523546509_10155493561581509 | Anyone who advocates, agrees, or otherwise approves of foreign hacking of our affairs is a traitor to American values. Especially our election process. Prosecute anyone who does that. Domestic whistleblowing is our right and duty if we know of any such activity in or out of government.
21 | Raymond Towler | 10155493523546509_10155493613841509 | Funny, I think all Trump wants too do is campaign. He doesn't act like someone that wants to win an election. And should we talk about when Trump said Hillary would be a great president.
22 | Brian Lewis | 10155493523546509_901636106647014 | He is proof that you don't really have to be brilliantt, well adjusted or even sane to be successful. You just need a lucrative talent and/or the right situation. If this dude walked into an interview for a minimum wage job even the McDonalds manager would be thinking "yeah, not going to be a team player and take direction."
23 | Matt Leeds | 10155493523546509_10155493606436509 | What a horrible disgusting piece of scum he is. Just a immature whining loser!!! He's not even a man... Trump is a coward. He is pathetic. All he's doing is embarrassing himself now it's just sad... This sorry excuse of a human is a Blue Falcon. #BlueFalcon
24 | Leslie Gasperich | 10155493523546509_1232116616846792 | Josh Matlock Obama tells trump to stop whining and he responds by calling Hillary's surrogates babies 😳 he's officially using pee wee Herman's "I know you are but what am I" line of defense. 😂 #yourethepuppet
25 | Kathy J Kennedy-Bell | 10155493523546509_1839645079614725 | He should move to Russia, seem he like the dictator Putin leader more than Americas leaders. Never have I known a presidential candidate that talks about our country so negatively. He is so UN-PATRIOTIC!!

Stunning transformation: This bride got a wake-up call when she saw her proposal photos. She lost more than 100 pounds in time to walk down the aisle. http://cnn.it/2eedt6e

1 | Evelyn Rodriguez | 10155493436906509_10155493457166509 | Im on the same boat and im eating better and going to the gym and i stay focused and positive and by the grace of God i have lost 45 lbs
2 | Michaelyn R. Haley | 10155493436906509_10155493464746509 | I have 110lbs to lose. I'm on day 3 of my life change. I'm scared I will fail...but failure is not an option if I want live and see my kids graduated and dance at my two sons weddings. This is very inspirational to meand I'm motivated to know it's possible with real life changes and no gimmicks.
3 | Nicole Domínguez | 10155493436906509_10155493714751509 | how is this weight shaming? SHE (not you, not anyone else) wasn't feeling good with herself, so she changed to feel more comfortable and happy. If you dont want to lose weight, dont. But she is happy with herself.
4 | Desiree Db Aburto | 10155493436906509_10155493465381509 | Rosy Selena Bloom I hope she doesn't sell out in 6 months and be promoting flat tummy tea like every one else on Instagram lol
5 | Anna Kaz | 10155493436906509_10155493473926509 | Breaks my heart that I didn't do the same. I was the heaviest on my wedding day, and it's my one true regret that I did not try sooner to look how I feel on the inside. Good for her, she looks beautiful!
6 | Karla Barbour | 10155493436906509_10155493961006509 | I've been learning why its so hard to loose weight & much of it is down to our gut, I'm just starting a detox and have taken part in the British gut project. I don't need to lose too much but its more about the depression I suffered with, since taking a supplement I did lose about a stone, other changes have been significant too which lead me to research more deeply.
7 | Stephanie McDermott Rucker | 10155493436906509_10155493731141509 | It's great if you want to do this but there's also nothing wrong with embracing your size and finding a banging dress that fits you at your large size either. Like great for her and everything but don't feel like you have to change because you're getting married. The person you're marrying is marrying you. How you are now. That's not gonna change with weight loss or weight gain and if it does you might not need to be marrying that person.
8 | Mandy Briscoe | 10155493436906509_10155493968356509 | Make sure you do it for yourself first Missy. Then realize that most of us gain some back after marriage. Don't let that ruin your spirit. Best of luck! You look gorgeous either way!
9 | Sonia Fiorelli-Cornejo | 10155493436906509_10155493808506509 | I see this and just want to tell the 30 year olds, as a 58 year old, that you have to keep it up, whatever it is that you are doing, its a big PAY OFF when you get to 58, my age.  Just do the math, keep going and don't stop.  God Bless
10 | David Dhaliwal | 10155493436906509_10155493474871509 | Wow! Good for her. I'm 160 pounds before i used to weigh 180 pounds I'm trying to gain 10 pounds about 170 pounds so I can look good in my suit for my wedding in India in about two months.
11 | Becca Weisberg | 10155493436906509_10155493480811509 | I started a diet to get back to my wedding weight. I'm very frustrated, haven't lost any weight and it's been 20 minutes already!
12 | Stratton Blanks | 10155493436906509_10155494461321509 | I bet you 13456324567 dollars you didn't read that number. You just skipped right over it. You didn't even realize I put a letter in it. No I didn't but you went back and looked. I want my like.
13 | Tung Trinh | 10155493436906509_10155493477256509 | CNN you should checking out the Washington post they said that you CNN hired Corey lewandowski jeffey Lord and other are spread lie. many time i turn my channel to MSNBC and back to CNN when they not talking It so disrepecting to the ppl watching, i cant stand their lie cause i Dont want to hear the lie. so hope you dont put those lying mouth on the program that i follow
14 | Tim Nick Knight | 10155493436906509_10155493461351509 | Wow, CNN is attracting all the right wing nut jobs, sad that their moron wack job has melted down.  Wahhh Wahhh Wahhh
15 | Brett Sikorski | 10155493436906509_10155493919931509 | Trevor Herrick needs to cut about 100 until he's got any definitive muscles, he likes to eat, and he eats like a piggy from a trough
16 | Todd Crites | 10155493436906509_10155493465446509 | She looked good either way but great job on achieving your goal!!! 😊💪👍
17 | Deedee Isie | 10155493436906509_10155493751091509 | So sad our society has placed so much emphasis on how women look. What's wrong with her picture during proposal?
18 | Isaac Anim | 10155493436906509_10155493445226509 | Everybody is saying CNN are biased! Why are you silent? Change your lifestyle now! Before everyone boycotts your a$$
19 | Mel Gee | 10155493436906509_10155493548611509 | Good for her. And she knows she has a guy who loves her for who she is and not just how she looks. Thats awesome
20 | Bill Right | 10155493436906509_10155493447621509 | The first Republican president was Abraham Lincoln, either the first or second best president we ever had, depending on who you talk to you. The first Democratic president was Andrew Jackson- the most genocidal president we ever had, slaughtering endless thousands of Native Americans. And the "big switch" is a big lie, as is proven over and over again. So don't even try...'Nuff said for me- I will NEVER vote the party of the KKK
21 | Tracie Burgess Dellinger | 10155493436906509_10155493456721509 | Are you fat shaming CNN? You don't won't other people to talk about a women's weight.
22 | Candace Hirsch | 10155493436906509_10155493920216509 | Good for her AND the man who loved her through it all!!
23 | Emily Lazzell | 10155493436906509_10155493536236509 | "Interviews with 2,021 adult Americans conducted by telephone by BSG on October 10-13, 2016. The margin of sampling error for results based on the total sample is plus or minus 2 percentage points. The sample uses a LVS based on voting history (65%), self-attestation (12%), social-media data mining (10%), demographic / socio-economic class (18%). This sample includes 1101 interviews among landline respondents and 920 interviews among cell phone respondents.NO SKEWS OR NARRATIVE SCREENS WERE EMPLOYEDExecutive Overview: Hillary Clinton Flash-Crash to 12% Favorable, Losing 19-77% NationallyAt this point Donald Trump has both momentum and enthusiasm. Distrust in the mainstream media is blunting the impact of the collective polling narrative. As Election Day approaches, Hillary Clinton’s favorable ratings have crashed to historic lows (12%) in non- partisans and Donald Trump is consolidating support (97% of LV Republican-identifying respondents are either enthusiastic or very enthusiastic about voting for Trump).Among independents, Hillary voters who are exposed to any alternative media (73%) are aware of the WikiLeaks emails and find them either disturbing (54%) or deeply disturbing (18%). Among liberal-identifying whites, support is shifting from Hillary (-27 since October 1st) to Donald Trump (78%) or Jill Stein (21%).For voters who solely consume mainstream media only 28% are aware of the WikiLeaks emails and of those, only 8% are aware of the content. For these voters Clinton leads Trump by +8.Minority voters are less likely to consume alternative media (only 14%) and are less likely to be aware of the email leak (only 18% for males, 9% for females). Even with this group, enthusiasm is down 63 points compared to October 2008.On other fronts, the counter-narrative is failing as well. Most heavy consumers of social media understand that the allegations against Donald Trump of sexual misconduct have largely been debunked (77%). We understand that communications strategies in that space have been unable to reduce the impact of this messaging. Worse, among white males in telephone polling 93% of them either approve (72%) or strongly approve (21%) of Donald Trump’s hot-mic tape.Only 39% of women approve of them however a majority (64%) say they ‘understand that confident men talk that way.’ In effect, these allegations have been diffused.On a positive note, most respondents who were liberal-leaning (83%) or Independent (59%) were unaware of the messaging front concerning Bill Clinton’s sexual misconduct. While the vast majority (88%) were aware of consensual extra-marital relationships, the mainstream media approach to the stories has left only 8% of liberal-leaning voters and only 19% of independents aware of the allegations of rape.On a disturbing note, some 70% of Republican-leaning voters are aware bussed-in voting, false-face operations, and dead-man’s-party registration drives. This may necessitate severe strategy changes for November."http://media.wix.com/ugd/0cf371_514bfe6a2dec4871ab7da7d50b9be410.pdf

Marijuana is getting more potent in Colorado, thanks to high-tech growth facilities in the state. http://cnn.it/2eBEQVO
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Nick Taylor | 10155493319816509_10155493344676509 | It's the pharmaceutical companies that want to make weed illegal again. They don't like the money they are losing because marijuana works with minimal side effects unlike the pills they want to force feed down your throat.
2 | Matthew Douglas | 10155493319816509_10155493465541509 | I'm sorry but the average potency of marijuana has not been 6% since my grandparents were smoking it at Woodstock. I wonder how all those ER visits go? Give you a bottle of water a bag of chips and tell you to chill out.
3 | Melanie Morse | 10155493319816509_10155493354091509 | Cue the reefer madness! Well, open your eyes people, we've never tested marijuana before as we have. I'd love for the reporter to ask her where and when those numbers are from!
4 | Sunny Hirpara | 10155493319816509_10155493545566509 | Shut the hell up, it's impossible to overdose (resulting in serious physical damage) - also a pharmacist here. Some people just don't like the feeling if they aren't used to it. Stop demonizing cannabis. People need to get their facts straight.
5 | Tom Lee | 10155493319816509_10155493380301509 | The Colombian natives that wished to poison America and steal it's spirit are laughing in their graves.  They have won.  We are now growing their poison for them.  America is now a drug nation.   Forget the discussion regarding side effects.  A high nation is a paralyzed numb nation.  It's a handicapped nation.  Deep down every pot smoker knows I'm right.  Way deep down.   Every drinker, smoker, pill popper has a conscience and some doubt about their using.
6 | Thomas Giezey | 10155493319816509_10155493341706509 | Yeah, Ill have to see it to believe it. Someone mail me a great big bag of Colorado reef so I may run my own tests..../sarcasm off
7 | Carol Renteria | 10155493319816509_10155493436401509 | This gives a new meaning to John Denver's song: LyricsHe was born in the summer of his 27th yearComing home to a place he'd never been beforeHe left yesterday behind him, you might say he was born againYou might say he found a key for every doorWhen he first came to the mountains his life was far awayOn the road and hanging by a songBut the string's already broken and he doesn't really careIt keeps changing fast and it don't last for longBut the Colorado rocky mountain highI've seen it rainin' fire in the skyThe shadow from the starlight is softer than a lullabye
8 | Adam Roberts | 10155493319816509_10155493410676509 | So let me get this straight. Something was handed over to private industry. And it started to become better, almost instantaneously? So... You're saying that the government doesn't have to be involved in every single facet of our lives, yet we are still capable of taking care of ourselves?... Amazing!!
9 | Jared Bock | 10155493319816509_10155493486556509 | As a Colorado resident I can say thank you to the marijuana industry for eliminating 80% of prescription painkiller sales in Colorado which has led to a 60% drop in prescription drug Overdose's.
10 | Teresa Muschott | 10155493319816509_10155493722196509 | I dont know why they don't just legalize it as recreational everywhere instead of going through this crap of making it medical first which takes a couple years down the road for them to set it up.  They will change the form, strength and put it in some vapor and charge an arm and a leg for it and those who need it most won't be able to get it.  SUCH BS
11 | Terry Mullican | 10155493319816509_10155493880186509 | George Washington  grew it all over the country, man. He had people growin' it all over the country, you know. The whole country back then was gettin' high. Lemme tell you, man, 'cause he knew he was onto somethin', man. He knew that it would be a good cash crop for the southern states, man, so he grew fields of it, man. But you know what? Behind every good man there's a woman, and that woman was Martha Washington, man, and every day, George would come home, she'd have a big fat bowl waiting for him, man, when he'd come in the door. She was a hip, a hip, hip lady, man.
12 | Ryan Gomez | 10155493319816509_10155494923426509 | California medical marijuana patient.Highest I've had was 30% thc.Wasn't bad at all, I smoked less of it then lower % marijuana.It's a simple recipe for use.Higher percentage, smoke less for same effects.Takes less time to medicate and get back to our day.
13 | Pat Massey | 10155493319816509_10155494813271509 | Yeah it's almost on par with what we've being smoking for eight years.  And it's all moot because the thing to do is distill the active ingredients out and smoke those. So it's all going to be basically pure hits of THC at the end of the day.
14 | John Thuot II | 10155493319816509_10155493515966509 | I have to say, Medical Weed has helped me through some of the toughest part of my migraines I suffered from for the past 6 years.  Meds that never even touched the pain associated with them, weed helped so much. No need to suffer folks, if you have ailments from severe pain and in a legal state, check with your docs. It will help tremendously!  Its all natural too!
15 | ILana Goldberg | 10155493319816509_10155493505231509 | Weed is best medicine is natural better than pills is chemical ruin liver I hope in Florida passed new law
16 | John A. Belinus | 10155493319816509_10155493843346509 | When I was a teen, we snorted a lot of this stuff. I stopped awhile back when a friends son injected just 1/2 a marijuanna and now he is in a permanent coma.
17 | Craig Kuzma | 10155493319816509_10155493506016509 | So use marijuana responsibly. Alcohol is still 114 times more dangerous. But it's ok. Because the right people are getting the money. The government don't care about your health
18 | Miguel Juarez | 10155493319816509_10155494354656509 | But doesn't people also go to the ER to get their stomach pumped for high alcohol consumption and they don't have data for that because I believe that happens very very often, I am pretty sure.
19 | Starr Danos | 10155493319816509_10155494345141509 | I have friends leaving our state of Louisiana to move to a legal state by the hand full!!! ALL states should care about their people but LA still doesn't! #TIMETOLEGALIZE
20 | Jimmy Edwards | 10155493319816509_10155493478366509 | How come you'll aren't saying anything about John Podesta's (Hillary's campagn manager) daughter receiving 75,000 shares of stock in a Company that Putin is linked to???
21 | Bryan Skyberg | 10155493319816509_10155493355011509 | 31% THC is still way too high. I would go for hit if they eliminated the additive portion of the plant until then for here in california I will vote against legalizing it
22 | Jacqueline L. Musallam | 10155493319816509_10155494939406509 | Colorado's economy is booming as well. Decriminalize it once and for all. It should be up to the individual what they want to do with their body and their life.
23 | Jesse Jones | 10155493319816509_10155493696506509 | This is a complete BS story. Potency has been on the rise since the 70's when it was around 6%. It's been up over 15% for years now. So when the lady says national average is 6% she is talking in 1970, not present day average.
24 | Edward Barker | 10155493319816509_10155494998861509 | Isn't 100 proof alcohol which they sell in every liquor store in America potent as well? I thought so, and that can actually kill you!
25 | Robert Colfack | 10155493319816509_10155493336366509 | Hopefully those liberals get so stoned in Colorado and forget to vote.....

"I want to ask Mr. Trump: would my son have a place in your America?"
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Robin Roos | 10155493203451509_10155493205966509 | Perhaps it should be made known that Mr. Khan is an immigration lawyer and that he only handles Muslim clients. Today I looked for Mr. Khan's client list and found out that the list has been made unavailable to the public by none other than the State Dept under Hillary's tenure. I couldn't believe what I had found out so I looked for info on Mr. Khan's past just to find out that he was a co-founder of a Muslim org that recruited by literature for jihadists in Malaysia and was associated to a married couple by the name of Abedine... Sound familiar??? It should... (got this post from someone half a year ago) They are the parents of Huma Abedine the senior advisor to Hillary Clinton.  What makes it even worse is that her parents are both card carrying members of the Muslim Brotherhood with ties to the Saudi Royal family who btw have given millions to the Clinton foundation and her campaign. https://youtu.be/5IuJGHuIkzY
2 | Carl Augustus Nix III | 10155493203451509_10155493210091509 | Yes..he is a hero. NOT YOU! Your lobbying special interest shady immigration deals from the middle east you have been doing for years. Pay to play!!
3 | Michael James | 10155493203451509_10155493227661509 | Your son will always have a place in America. You're a POS who keeps using your son's death as a political statement. You're a disgrace to Gold Star families.
4 | Etai Versa | 10155493203451509_10155493208036509 | I want to know would Mr Kahn have made as many speeches as he did if he wasn't paid for them?!
5 | Joe Miller | 10155493203451509_10155493210211509 | Trump is for the veterans ...He is for America .. Clinton would say what difference does it make and your worried about trump ..
6 | Jose Contreras | 10155493203451509_10155493232986509 | Would you please stop it. It was already proven Mr. Khan is just another Clinton shill. His son was a brave American hero fighting the ideology Trump is trying to keep out and the democrats have exploited. To politicize his death to score "points" for Clinton is shameful. His son, just like Mr. Kahn are American citizens. Why would he need to concern himself if his son would have a place in America? He did, and he knew it which is why he died defending his American brothers. Enough already.
7 | David Saka | 10155493203451509_10155493238921509 | Trump never had a problem with this mans son, he only had a problem with him and his wife who cashed in to make a speech at the DNC during the summer and the Clinton's confine to pay him to make phony ads and by the way the Obama White House forgave Mr. Kahn personal tax debt of 750KTotally disgraceful
8 | Mathew Sadowski | 10155493203451509_10155493225436509 | Hey CNN, are you not gonna report on the latest damning news on Obamacare?! Many major insurers are dropping out and premiums are gonna SKYROCKET beginning next year..
9 | Sternlicht BJen | 10155493203451509_10155493210441509 | All politics aside...my heart just breaks for this family...and every other family who has lost a child. As parents, our kids are our heart, and if our child dies, a piece of our heart dies with them. No parent should ever have to bury their child.Army Capt. Humayun Khan saved lives that day, and his parents should be so proud of him.
10 | Clara Stringhetta Gawley | 10155493203451509_10155493309211509 | Regardless of your political preference what sort of people deliberately pick up a fight with the parents of a young man that die for the country they claim to love ? Deplorable is to put it mildly .
11 | Corinna Davies Turner | 10155493203451509_10155493218606509 | Mr. Khan, your son was a hero and I am so very sorry for your loss. Please continue to speak truth to power. This ad is extremely powerful and necessary! <3
12 | Mike Demsko | 10155493203451509_10155493245126509 | His son would be honored and respected, his father brought shame by letting the very people parade him around as a publicity stunt. These people are the ones disgracing our military by allowing the Va system to remain in shambles.
13 | Basel Kurfali | 10155493203451509_10155493241211509 | This man is a disgraceful puppet. .Trump will bring the nation together and heal the wounds and rifts made by this negligent awkward administration. ..
14 | Harvey Harv | 10155493203451509_10155493297026509 | Funny how CNN is silent on Hillary's comments about Benghazi families! Bias much? Or is the Hillary camp paying too much for your outlet to be fair and balanced on calling out both sides!
15 | Stephen Redding | 10155493203451509_10155493225521509 | Your son was a hero. You sir are a sharia law muslim. That means you think you do not havto abide by Americas laws and our constitution. So therefore sir, Go F*CK Yourself!
16 | Julie JJ Cofield Ford | 10155493203451509_1855167644769850 | If people would listen to what Trump actually said this wouldn't be an issue. He wants to halt immigration of Muslims that come from countries that support radicalism   We do need to better vet any immigrant coming here.
17 | Chris Matyskiel | 10155493203451509_671767026334670 | I want to ask if Clinton feels sorry for stopping the army from saving the americans in bengazi and letting them all die while she went to bed then blamed everything on a movie. And then said what does it matter.
18 | Kristal Rene'e Coleman | 10155493203451509_10155493296676509 | I don't understand how people say that this man is exploiting his son's death for money. Maybe you haven't list someone that you love dearly. If you did, you'd know that no amount of money would be able to bring that person back or make you forget them. He can support whomever he wants, but it just hoes to show how sick people are to suggest this about that man and his wife. #RIJCapt.Khan ## AmericanHero
19 | John Holt | 10155493203451509_10155493247776509 | Why can't the Clinton Campaign run on their merits and have commercials about why you should vote for Hillary, instead of commercials on why you shouldn't vote for Trump. Kinda sounds like they don't believe she can be elected on her accomplishments, whatever they may be.
20 | Carol Walker | 10155493203451509_671821646329208 | Omg! The first time I saw the Khan family at the Democratic Convention my heart went out to them and the sacrifice their son and they made for our country and the more I hear Donald Trump speak the way he does the more I dislike him and what he stands for. How can you say you want to be the leader of our great nation and treat people with such a lack of compassion? The Khan family are different then any other American family who have lost a love one after they gave their life for our country! How dare you Donald Trump stand on television and look straight at the camera and speak so horribly to the Khan family as if you speak for our America! You say you want to be the president of our country, there's no way that's going to happen, because unlike your followers, not all of us feel or think as you do! And our loving America will speak for the Khan family and all others whom you have disrespect on November, 8th when we stand as one nation and vote for Hillary Clinton!
21 | Bryon Conner | 10155493203451509_671790436332329 | Dear Mr.Khan,I want to Thank You and your wonderful Wife.You are what my parents raised me to Believe ,That all people must be treated with dignity without any ethnic biases.Your Son would be so proud of your actions.The world must have people fight for those who are less fortunate.May you know that what my family has fought for in this Country , is what your Son fought for.Take Care Sincerely Bryon Conner
22 | Kathy J Kennedy-Bell | 10155493203451509_10155493304196509 | I read comments from you heartless negative trolls. How do you sleep at night after the horrible things you say. You should be ashamed of yourself. This man lost his son during a war the the GOP Republican President Bush started. Dont make comments about Trump and his sacrifice when he HAS NOT SACRIFICE a thing. Trump is a heartless mean spirited man and if he becomes President and Russia comes flying into America all of you Trump supporters will be sorry you voted for that manipulator. Hes lying to Americans and he will destroy our country!! God in Heaven help us!!!!!!!!!
23 | Sovereign Christoph | 10155493203451509_10155493255406509 | Well, your son is already dead so we will never know that. Will we?Btw, shouldn't you let your son R.I.P instead of invoking his memory on a daily basis just so that you can encourage people to vote for Hillary?
24 | Allen William | 10155493203451509_1855167854769829 | Sorry sir, your son was not a radical which is what Mr Trump is wanting to get rid of. You can twist your story however you see fit but the radical Islamic terrorists that are out to harm you or me need to be banned
25 | Linda Ament | 10155493203451509_1855200001433281 | This guy makes me sick to my stomach. He's just like an Islamic terrorist that used his own son as a suicide bomber. Nothing matters to him but his own cause and himself, not even the honor and dignity for his brave son. Overwhelmingly shameful!!

--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Kellen Mann | 10155493110531509_10155493120851509 | Yes, that is grace. What do the Clintons do? They steal thousands of dollars worth of furniture  when they vacate. They also complain for months and years on end about how W. Bush stole the election. Gore sues 4 times because he didn't accept his defeat. Don't throw rocks in glass houses, Clinton!
2 | Elson Riza | 10155493110531509_10155493119441509 | They are establishing their world tyranny by stealth -- manipulating current events, re-engineering society and controlling perception.-Our true rulers have determined that we shall have no real say in our collective future. Like livestock, we will chew our collective cud on sex, drugs, toys and trivia, which they will supply in abundance.
3 | Ada Queen | 10155493110531509_10155493165016509 | CNN thank you for killing this country and its Grace. We the people are just watching this country go down the drain by collective act of mainstream media, Hollywood, government and the elite.
4 | Gainlar Reyes | 10155493110531509_10155493122801509 | Americans (not all) imported terrorism in their own land. Trump maybe be noisy but he's talking about valid issues. Terrorism, Economy, Discrimination that the current administration did not polished, that includes Clinton. She has failed, she lied, she might start a war. I'm very worried for my relatives out there in US.
5 | Prosper Nwanjiobi | 10155493110531509_10155493140486509 | I hope Hillary doesn't end up embarrassed at the end of the day. To write Trump off at this point is a mistake she might regret. She could well be the one writing that letter to Trump at the end of the day. #never count your eggs till they are hatched
6 | Lisa Makar | 10155493110531509_10155493172396509 | Yes it is an example of grace.  But let's bear in mind that this letter was written ON Inauguration Day and NOT before the election has even occurred.  Comparison of apples and oranges.  How quickly the people on the Left forget how things went with Gore....I concede....No wait, I didn't mean to concede, I take that back.
7 | Scarlet Brubaker | 10155493110531509_10155493281156509 | I don't believe for one second that Clinton won't contest the election when Trump wins!!! They started months ago blaming the Russians for exposing her fraudulent activities by releasing her emails! Propaganda! And by the way, who pressured Ecuador to cut off Assange's internet???? Three guesses! By the way, a BIG "Thank you!" to Assange !!!
8 | Lyn D. Kennelly | 10155493110531509_10155493146456509 | Let's see the letter Bill Clinton left for George W. Bush, too!  It is a tradition that each President leaves a letter for the next President.  I would hope that they are all a reflection of leadership.
9 | Daniel Vallantine | 10155493110531509_10155493451891509 | I look at all these claims and conspiracy documentaries targeting Clinton and all I honestly see are stories with not a shred of proven evidence, but rather filled with convenient half truths and blatant propaganda. None of this stuff has been, or, I believe, can be proven in the courts. In my opinion all these conspiracy theories do is create fear and undermine the very institutions that allow societies to function peacefully. It is interesting to me as to why people create these theories and why they do gain traction and support. Maybe they give people a sense of empowerment when they, for some reason or other, otherwise feel helpless, I don't know.I just find it sad, for someone who has seemingly worked all her life if the public domain, not for self enrichment or ego aggrandizement, but for the betterment of the lives of other people, that there are people who want to try and undermine that. It does seem to me though that the most high profile and successful people will always have the biggest and loudest critics. If anything, I do agree though that we should always question, but to demand that unsubstantiated claims are nothing short of fact is just nonsense.
10 | Rob Howarth | 10155493110531509_10155493241046509 | Joe Biden, threatended Russia, CNN scamed the rocket scientest voters to elect hillary, knowing that she will order a no fly zone over Syria, shooting down Russian Planes that are taking out ISIS, saving USA tax dollars. Russian Ships are going through the Englinsh Channel now. The Clintons and Bush's can bully third world countries but not the big boys, like Russia or China.Thanks to the media, especially CNN telling the voters to elect hillary as president, which they did, President Hillary Clinton will start World War 3 with Russia. Trump was right.
11 | Jose Contreras | 10155493110531509_10155493176396509 | Why wouldn't it be a graceful transition? That was the start of the Clinton/Bush Dynasty along with their adopted child Obama. Trust me it isn't over, I'm sure Michelle and Chelsea are being primed to continue the American Dictatorship by proxy.
12 | Angel Hughes Jackson | 10155493110531509_10155493225471509 | I just watched a video about people coming out talking about how after the Matt Lauer town hall she went off screaming and yelling racist and sick profanity! Then she called the head of CNN and told him they will all be hanging from nooses if Trump wins?  Why would they ALL be hanging from nooses I wonder. Maybe because they ALL will be convicted if she isn't elected...  Where is that CNN? I hope first Trump wins then I hope you are put OUT of business you are a disgrace to journalism! But it's sounds eerily similar to what countless secret service says she would do when Bill was president!
13 | Berto Bastidas | 10155493110531509_10155493527161509 | TRUMP IS A BIG BABY..... whines about everything!!!!! Has an excuse for everything, sore loser, racist, womanizer. If you people out there truly want a man running this country that can't even say that he will accept the winner whoever it is, then people you have a rude awakening coming your way if he gets in!!!!!!
14 | Louie Kneitz | 10155493110531509_10155493299736509 | Funny though how Clinton refused to accept the results of 2000 and Kerry was reluctant to accept the results when he lost to Bush in 2004. Its OK for dems but not OK for Trump even after its been proven by wikileaks and undercover videos the Dems stack the deck against the Republicans. Even against their own party. Bernie Sanders in the primary. What does the one responsible get for it? Hired by the Hilary campaign. Dems once again using rose colored glasses
15 | Mark Archuleta | 10155493110531509_10155494916496509 | George H.W Bush was in my opinion one of the best Republican Presidents we have had in office.  I voted for him and I was and still continue to be a Democrat. Sadly George H.W Bush was the last Republican I will vote for. Trump and company have destroyed what  was a respectful and honest party.  I will vote for Hillary, and since those in the Senate and House Republican's can not or refuse  to do their jobs, I will vote Blue straight  down the line.
16 | Nicole Urbano-Vandelac | 10155493110531509_10155493528976509 | That was before Bill did Monica in the oval office! Oh and Trump shouldn't give you his blessing! EVER!!! We'll just have to break the cycle this time, because, well, we've never had a corrupt cow like you running before!
17 | Kevin War | 10155493110531509_10155493403436509 | Shut up the story is the democrats CNN News 📰 this is bs I don't have a dog in the fight anyone that defends them their is something wrong with you.people need to be fire and legal action needs to take place where it's needed total bs it's disgusting
18 | Franklin Bartholomew | 10155493110531509_10155493289311509 | I agree, that is what leadership looks like,.....Not taking all the White House furniture,  stealing all the W's off of the keyboards in the White House, and proclaiming George W. was selected not elected, .... If only they showed George W the same leadership his father showed them
19 | Douglas Chandler Graham | 10155493110531509_10155493207676509 | CNN could show some "grace" if they would talk about Hillary Clinton's emails and her foundation. They would rather talk about Trump calling her a nasty woman, which according to the secret service people and others that have seen her temper agree.
20 | Mindy Echler | 10155493110531509_10155493188686509 | Says the woman who screeched "what difference does it make" when confronted with her b.s. lie about the Benghazi attack being the result of a YouTube video.....how can anyone one vote for that vile woman
21 | Joe Doodian | 10155493110531509_10155493216596509 | I guess Al Gore was an animal for challenging the dangling chad in Florida. I am sure Hillary is above challenging an election if it was close and there was evidence of a problem. The hypocrisy is hysterical.
22 | Mark Kiss | 10155493110531509_10155493254941509 | This letter was written in a fair election so what is the point. As we all know, if a democrat loses an election by a small amount, say 400 votes in Florida, they will take it to the supreme court. Al Gore, super Hypocryte on this one. It aslo seems like common sense that if the election is rigged and there is proof, I would want it contested. That is common sense. Trump is saying he will do what the law says while the biased media continued to twist his words. Only an idiot would not contest a flawed election. Hillary Clinto will be the first to cry foul and run to lawyers, being the hypocrite she is. And, as we all know, the election was over over 5 weeks before Al Gore conceded.
23 | Todd Boike | 10155493110531509_10155493145726509 | She's a clown, it's completely different, the mainstream media and rigged polls and having your dog vote wasn't happening then what is happening to Trump..you people can't see that..wow
24 | ציפי וידוסר אדי | 10155493110531509_10155494598906509 | "The Clintons"12 rapes46 mysterious deaths1 dead ambassador10 investigations 1 impeachment 2 disbarment 30,000 deleted emails Nothing to see here keep votingVOTE FOR THE LOVE OF AMERICA ❤ TRUMP
25 | Justin Whitton | 10155493110531509_10155493857116509 | Does leadership allow planes to fly into world trade towers the same time as demo bombs go off thru the building to deceive those who appointed you to office ... That's not leadership to me

1 | Sammy Daas | 10155492977706509_10155492988951509 | For once, let's show some respect and humanity. No comments about trump or hillary. This grieving father and hero deserves that much.
2 | Michele Lynn | 10155492977706509_10155493009586509 | God bless our first responders and emergency workers. I could never do it. My husbands cousin, a police officer, responded to a head on collision of a mac truck and a vehicle. It was his wife in the car. She died, leaving him as a single dad to a one year old. It was awful.
3 | Brittany Robertson-Fitzgerald | 10155492977706509_10155493031211509 | One of the worst things imaginable as a parent. A nightmare this poor man will never be able to wake from. Praying for this father and the rest of the young man's family and friends.
4 | Betty Mallaley Huard | 10155492977706509_10155493001226509 | That poor man 😢 I'd lose what's left of my mind 😕 Rest in Peace
5 | Sean Brandon Box | 10155492977706509_10155493155611509 | I am so sorry to the family of this young man. After reading this, my one year old reached up to me and I just held him and literally weeped. He then started making these funny noises with his mouth as if trying to make me laugh. He just sat there and played with my face. This definitely is a huge reminder to be the best dad I can be all the time and to always love my kids, because we never know when a loved might be taken from us ❤️
6 | Pam Richardson | 10155492977706509_10155493029086509 | This happened to my aunt and uncle. He was a volunteer firefighter as well. He and another son went to the scene and realized it who it was. That was 26 years ago, it is still sad to remember.  Bless this family, I can't imagine what they are going through.
7 | Brandy Nelson Marks | 10155492977706509_10155493137096509 | This happened to my aunt in 1976. She was a nurse and on her way home from work and saw an accident that had just happened and stopped to help. It was her daughter. She had just turned 18 and was about to graduate high school. Such a horrible thing to live with.
8 | Colleen Green | 10155492977706509_10155493205391509 | The same thing happened to me as a volunteer EMT. I was called to the scene of an accident not knowing it was daughter who had passed in the accident. It was surreal. There are no words to explain the emotions and the shock to your system. I rarely drive on that road now. It is just to painful and the memories come flooding back as if it were just happening. I hope in time you can move forward. Find peace in your heart. ❤️️
9 | Billie R Kemper | 10155492977706509_10155493312806509 | As a parent, I couldn't even finish this story. Heartbroken, devastated, I don't know what to say. I'm beyond sorry for this dad, this family. May they be lifted up in prayer and surrounded by family and friends. RIP young man.
10 | Randi Trowbridge | 10155492977706509_10155493339856509 | This happened less than 35miles from my house. This community has now been hit with 4 deaths in a month. Pray for them. Remember that life is about helping out those who need help and being the kind of person that lifts people up.
11 | Keith Kittrelle | 10155492977706509_10155493090781509 | My main 9 to 5 is at a major hospital and I often work in the emergency room and have helped with many traumas and I have some family, including my parents, that live close to this hospital and every time we have a call that a trauma is on its way in and the victims are the age of any of my family members I get a sickening feeling in my stomach until I can see it's not any of them.
12 | Kelly Farnum | 10155492977706509_10155493155341509 | This happens a lot in small communities where you have a volunteer fire and rescue. I can't imagine what this father is going through. Thoughts are with them.
13 | Jennifer Lee Evans | 10155492977706509_10155494030616509 | So heartbroken for this father. Sometimes you read something and all you want to do is give the person in the story a hug. I know it wouldn't take away his pain but still.....
14 | Brandi Hernandez | 10155492977706509_10155493646871509 | This is my worst nightmare. Having a 17 yr old on the road, every time I hear traffic is backed up due to a wreck I instantly start praying and dialing his number. God bless this child's soul, God bless his family. I pray in all this chaos that family finds comfort. I just don't know how I could live with that pain. No parent wants to bury a child. Its just not the way its supposed to be. I am hurting for this family.
15 | Melissa Povlsen | 10155492977706509_10155493046626509 | This is why I didn't drive to where my daughters accident happened at. I know #1 I didn't want to see her that way &#2 I wanted EMS to focus on the injured and not focused on me.
16 | Dawn Marie Quire Wise | 10155492977706509_10155493787671509 | Prayers and positive vibes for him, his family, and all his responder family as well. With a wonderful support system, he will heal from this. You never really recover. You just learn to live with it. Trust me. I am living proof that it can be done. It's been 8 years since I pulled up in an ambulance, to find my beautiful daughter. My heart breaks for him. He will forever be changed. But there is a purpose for what he does.

17 | Deanna Crozier | 10155492977706509_10155494964671509 | This is so sad. All my prayers go to his family.  I worked in the emergency room and every time I heard a siren I was thinking it could be someone I knew or one of my kids
18 | Argie Georgiades | 10155492977706509_10155494307771509 | What an unbelievable tragedy. My family and I are praying for this young man's family to have the strength to go on. As a mother, this is unfathomable to me. Please remember to always tell your l children that you love each and every day. Thank you for this reminder.
19 | Edna Milbourne Sackman Merz | 10155492977706509_10155494616301509 | Losing a child has got to be the worst thing that can happen to a person. Finding him this way has to make it even more devastating and tragic. Prayers for this family.
20 | Monica Lopez | 10155492977706509_10155493918361509 | My condolences to this young man's family. I can't even imagine the pain. My prayers are with you and know God, the creator will give you the strength to go on. So sorry for your loss. 🙏🏽

22 | Matthew Smith | 10155492977706509_10155494160691509 | This is just a terribly heart wrenching story. I can't even imagine having my own child pass away before me, let alone discovering it the way that father did.
23 | Cheryl Heymans | 10155492977706509_10155493179446509 | Just heartbreaking! It's bad enough to lose a parent but to be a first responder to that crash? Prayers for this kid's family and friends.
24 | Andrea Dewdney-Goldson | 10155492977706509_10155493177881509 | I'm so sorry for your loss, as a mother of two young men, I can't even imagine your pain......love and prayers to you and your family.
25 | Mark Smith | 10155492977706509_10155493237411509 | Finally a story where I barely see any political comments thanks for finally showing some compassion

1 | Angela Shaw | 10155492879676509_10155493412621509 | I love that a post about Aaron Rodgers and The Big Lebowski is being trolled by people hating on both Clinton and Trump. Can't Aaron Rodgers just wear a sweater and it not be turned into a political debate?
2 | Bob Smith | 10155492879676509_10155492945371509 | The Clinton News Network's plummeting ratings graphically show how many people recognize CNN has no credibility anymore. Time to drain the swamp and put CNN out of business.

--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Bill Boggs | 10155492675896509_10155492683406509 | So many teachers in support of racism in America. This is why our children are being brainwashed by Liberals. BLM's is a hate group.
2 | David Milne | 10155492675896509_10155492749991509 | Stand up for racism and killing cops, these teachers an school system needs a over haul, fine want teach this crap BLM , let's also teach how one minority group is more violent then others and how one minority group over others have more opportunities then others yet still can not get there act together.Facts an figures don't lie.
3 | Zulma Matos | 10155492675896509_10155492731501509 | CNN is not somewhere you can go to for the truth on what is really going on . CNN all they do is distort stories and lie all day long.
4 | Skyler Schmidt | 10155492675896509_10155492712966509 | Keep it up. Seattle is always at the forefront of human rights and social change. If you can't say that black lives matter, you have no business being in education. As a teacher, I say this proudly.
5 | Anthony Holzhauser | 10155492675896509_10155492762736509 | This is wrong, BLM does not belong in schools. BLM is a racist group against white just like KKK is racist against black. Groups that separate race are nothing but trouble.
6 | Jenna Beverly | 10155492675896509_10155492917331509 | This is ridiculous I bet if teachers went to school wearing white lives matter in a mostly black school they would all be fired and the news would call them racist even along with them wearing a blue lives matter shirt gtfoh with this BS
7 | Matthew R F Wakeling | 10155492675896509_10155492748966509 | glad to know that these teachers support a group who enjoys to vandalise, loot, and destroy. do the statitics and you'll realise that it's 'unequal' because of the population by race. you can't feel sorry for lazy people. of course there will be a gap between rich and poor, able and not able, skilled and not skilled. it's not now a thing to take pity for the lazy - it will always be 'unequal' but the conditions are very much equal for all. PS - not saying blacks are lazy. it's an example about people who are lazy, about people who don't have fathers, about people who drop out of school to sell drugs, it's a life cycle - the campaign should be #stopdroppingoutofschool or #stopabandoningyourkids (by race, blacks have the most abandon fathers which is often a reason why they perform so badly), blacks are killing blacks and more whites are killed by cops. check the facts. this BLM group is not necessary. If most criminals are black, then, yes, you'll probably find that more blacks will be 'hunted down' by cops :) ALL LIVES MATTER.
8 | Don Mcclure | 10155492675896509_10155492906711509 | Black lives matter is funded by George Soros. George Soros says "his life"s work is to see the destruction of America" Before you uniformed democrats attack me, just check YouTube
9 | Brett Hooks | 10155492675896509_10155492975491509 | "Ok class. Today we are gonna learn how to light a car on fire. Then tomorrow we will learn how to bust into stores and use proper lifting techniques to carry out a tv. Then on Friday we will learn how to as a group jump on one innocent white person and beat them half to death. After all that and if everyone behaves then we will teach you how to murder cops for extra credit."
10 | Shanna Kurth | 10155492675896509_10155492804226509 | They wore T-shirts with the name of a movement on them and they are lauded for their commitment to equality. They. Wore. T-shirts.I sincerely hope this is not all they are doing for their students -- regardless of color.
11 | Victor Lawless | 10155492675896509_10155492956226509 | I get it, believe me , I went to a few schools in South Phoenix , predominately Mexican and it was no picnic being white. I understand what these people are trying to do, America needs to change, It isn't going to be easy but it is necessary for the long term survival of this nation. Racism is a destroyer of nations. A catalyst for conflict , and a leveler of the human soul. It's easy to be a racist for any human being , but it's not easy to change.
12 | James Osborne | 10155492675896509_10155493066451509 | I am from Seattle and my wife worked for SPS. With that said who paid for the shirts? As a WA tax payer you should ask because my wife told me all about it days ago and the answer is drum roll.... the school district did. This is 1 of the reasons we left Seattle all the schools focus on is the misbehaving black kids. Those children can physically and sexually assault other children with no consequences. That's right no suspension no nothing I was a witness to this on several occasions and when I started to ask questions the principal of my child's school and a couple others made up a huge lie about me and got me banned from the school. My daughter was treated so horribly [by students and staff] at a certain school in west Seattle that I removed her from the school with 2 months left in the year and home schooled her. We were a part of this schools community for a decade everyone loved my children and my wife and I volunteered all the time at the school. This School District has gone so far off the rails it is sad
13 | Christopher Lovullo | 10155492675896509_10155492931771509 | Funny how being racist doesn't apply to black people. Only applies when they are on the receiving end of it huh?? Black Lives Matter is a racist movement, no better or less racist than the KKK...
14 | Derrick Davis | 10155492675896509_10155492682081509 | If "black lives matter" bothers you but you post "blue lives matter" everywhere then the word of contention was "black"
15 | David Plaza Jr. | 10155492675896509_10155492901821509 | For those of you who say BLM is a hate group you're wrong. So many different races and nationalities are apart of BLM. The KKK an actual haye group do you think there are many different races thats apart of it?
16 | Wayne Elder | 10155492675896509_1825619807672766 | I wonder what would happen if the whites refused to attend a racist school? Home school for a while and see what happens to the schools finances. Let them teach the minority students alone for a while lets see where their test scores go.
17 | Timothy James Darge | 10155492675896509_1227466140647118 | Nobody of any race wants to destroy or have destroyed their own city. Every race has "trouble makers". It's government's job to assure well being in our nation. Government controls jobs, education and city safety that's what taxes are for.
18 | Barry Beck | 10155492675896509_1227443713982694 | Funny how this school wants to show inequality. 1989 I was beaten down publicly as a student at this school for looking white at a protest rally against the Gulf War. I was beaten by students and adults and this is not a joke. It was in the papers there. Mayor Norm Rice was the Mayor a the time and came and seen me in the hospital and at our home. At the time we lived in an apartment building on the corner of 4th and Cherry just above the chocolate shop. I made police reports and was able to identify several students including and adult volunteers for the school. The school did nothing, no one was arrested, my family was harassed, and it took several months to heal. I was an 11 year old child! I knew no racism,  no hate, I was just another child. To this day I can not find myself to be racist as being the product of a biracial marriage. So please, spare me the inequality crap that come from this school.
19 | Michael Shocker Bates | 10155492675896509_10155492868011509 | Brain washing kids is the worst form of education I have ever seen. This is getting sad and no one will stand against these teachers because of the topic Im sad to see this world our children live in.
20 | Mark Lyons | 10155492675896509_10155493183901509 | The problems we face across this Country are a direct result of the disintegration of the family. To reconstitute the family should be a top priority but isn't because of political correctness.
21 | Sue Sanne | 10155492675896509_10155492898096509 | This is criminal! BLM is a racist group that advocates violence and hate. Those parents should pull their kids immediately & explain to them why. ..
22 | Jose Avila | 10155492675896509_1825618014339612 | Every group will have people that will join and do the opposite of the main message. The BLM is a  movement to bring awareness of the life that blacks experience. Many are mad because they were content to see what they wanted to believe. The true message is to open peoples' fixed view of the world and bring light to a problem that has been ignored for too long.
23 | Tony L. Thompson | 10155492675896509_10155493022281509 | As a parent, I would not be happy with this. Not every parent supports BLM, same goes for POTUS, religion, etc. The teachers should do this in their own time away from the classroom or school grounds. They should not force their opinion on students whose parents feel differently about the organization. I would most certainly complain to the school board and would consider keeping my kid home if they do not support what the teachers are imposing upon them.
24 | Rab Ferrier | 10155492675896509_1825701600997920 | The sloggan should be every life matters and it shouldnt matter if your black, white, yellow, red or even blue n green its only a skin colour and its sad that the world revolves more around racist hate than anything else
25 | Sarah Renfroe | 10155492675896509_653450761483096 | ALL LIVES MATTER! EQUALITY MATTERS. By singularly declaring black lives matter, you are promoting racism, which is the very opposite of this movement's origional purpose. This whole # thing should be dropped. It cheapens the sentiment and separates us rather than bringing us together. HUMAN LIVES MATTER.
