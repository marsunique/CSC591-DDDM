1 | Dan'l Miller | 10154765377529729_10154765500119729 | Is this what you thought that you were getting by putting a woman in power?In 2013, one of then-Secretary-of-State Hillary's biggest accomplishments was accepting bribes from the Russians to sell the Russians 20% of the USA's uranium reserves (i.e., half of the active mines), so that Russia could build the new Satan 2 nuclear missile, the RS-28.Hillary literally made it possible to bring Satan into this world. A vote for Hillary is a vote for Russia destroying an area as large as France or as large as Texas. Go ahead, vote Hillary* if that is your desired future, because she was perhaps the key actor on the world stage who made that onerous future possible ‚Ä¢today‚Ä¢.Isn't it ironic that the person who makes the Satan 2's explosive uranium possible for the Russians is now saber-rattling to provoke a war with the Russians? Funny how that happens, isn't it?And you thought having a woman as president would mean that the Dept. of Defense would need to have a bakesale, right? That is what the bumpersticker promised, right?* Or even vote for a minor candidate or don't vote at all, so that you can also do your part to pave the way for Russia exploding the Satan 2 in a town in America near you.http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/russia-reveals-chilling-first-images-9118075
2 | The Truth is Here | 10154765377529729_10154765380504729 | Dear person reading this,I hope your day has been going well, if not, I hope it gets better You are an amazing person who will inspire others to do great things so keep up the hard work. FOLLOW US TO LEARN THE TRUTH !
3 | Paul John Gavagan | 10154765377529729_10154765390549729 | That would screw-up Hillary's talking points
4 | Aliceann Carlton | 10154765377529729_10154765499924729 | Many comments here are spam/troll spinoff regarding Hillary Clinton with the usual conspiracy tone.  Best to get on with the topic instead of the cliff runners' drop off.

2 | HarrietandMike Lewis | 10154763385039729_10154763545599729 | His minuscule ego absolutely requires he be a winner. That's why he says it's all rigged. Then he can blame his abject failure on everyone but where the true fault lies. He's a LOSER.
3 | Danny Babcock | 10154763385039729_10154763867544729 | Trump and his supporters; don't like, "Facts", or math and statistics, or you know "fake" polls that are never right. But, isn't it odd that when Trump uses a "poll" to boost his ego, that's okay, that one must be right? Odd isn't it, I wonder why? I think the Trump campaign has an interesting way to predict the outcome of an issue, or event, like a poll. What they must do is read the bumps on little Donny Trumps head and Chant! Afterwards, Trump uses that valuable insight and talks REAL loud, says it three time and rants on and on poof its fact! Come on you've got to laugh!

Whether it‚Äôs to save face or to set the stage for a post-election media play, Trump has effectively stopped talking about any policy issues, instead focusing his fire on the ‚Äúrigged‚Äù electoral system itself. It is a message he reiterated Wednesday night during the final presidential debate, when he refused to say whether he‚Äôd accept the results of the election if he loses. ‚ÄúI will keep you in suspense,‚Äù he said.

The masses do not like Hillary for there is nothing there to like....the Democrats do not even like Hillary...but she is all they have.....bad spot to be in and they can run but they cannot hide! I don't care if one goes to church every time the door is open and claims to be this or that...if they vote for Hillary Clinton or support her by not voting, they have serious moral and ethical issues and a really bad heart problem and are vain and self centered. We are down to where the rubber hits the road...there is little time left....America make up your mind wisely and soberly....because this is not about Republicans and Democrats...about right or left....about personalities.....it is about whether we will have a country left to leave to our children and grandchildren and others to come....for a country without borders and laws and without sovereignty is not a country but a land mass filled with people. Lots of heroes have died for what we have....lots and lots of American blood shed for what we have....lots of sweat and tears and prayers in building of America....are we going to just sit back and let it go to the control of the scum of the earth to the sewer dwellers and dumpster divers and liars and traitors and criminals never to rise again?

25 | Joe Armstrong | 10154763385039729_10154765246359729 | Hillary Clinton wants to establish a 65% inheritance tax on the savings and property of every Americans relatives, parents, grandparents or any other relative who "God Bless Them" pass away.  This means she wants the Federal Government to take a one-time grab using the IRS to take 65% of everything these hundreds of thousands of people strived to build and save for their entire lives.  It means as close relatives pass on in life, those they worked for their entire lives will only see 35% in inheritance.  Now, don't forget...your state inheritance taxes would also have to be added to that number and would approximate on average another 15% of the total amount of the inheritance you will probably be expecting.if any man or woman spends their lives accumulating stocks which have real estate valuations, grocery store chains, fast food chains, railroads, trucking companies, newspapers, magazines, real estate portfolio investors, tax-exempt foundations which have property holdings, why does this inheritance tax requirement not apply to anyone, any business, or any industry where an individual has spent his life accumulating property and wealth to better their heirs lives.  Why are Agricultural investments alone being targeted?Which means, in essence, every American would receive about 20% of the inheritance you thought you'd be getting.  Those who built their savings and properties wanted it all for you...Clinton wants to share a bit of it with you!Once this is law...just remember, you voted for Hillary.  Oh yeah, btw...Obamacare is going to double your costs in the next two years and Clinton is not getting rid of it.

1 | Matt McBride | 10154763132039729_10154763157164729 | Today I saw a map showing a Trump landslide based on Reuters polls.  One thing's for certain, 2016 will be an example of how the media used polling to attempt to influence turnout.
2 | Wendy Woodring | 10154763132039729_10154763180269729 | Give up Washington Post bc no one buys your crap anymore! Have you noticed Trump's Rallies vs Hillary's little town hall appearances? His rallies people fill stadium and still have to turn.people away and with Hillary she has to pay for a bus to bring her prop people with signs! Everyone knows it so give up!!! Your post mean crap because you're not credible anymore! Trump supporters should actually thank all of you media bc you are actually helping Trump get more supporters. Everyone sees how much corruption that's going on with the biased media and reporting. Polls are fabricated for her too. LOL!  It's actually funny bc now we are realizing we are outsmarting all of you guys bc we know what to do on election day! I won't be using the voting machine. Especially if it has Smartamatic (Soros owned) voting machines. We are going to ask for paper ballots! People will be watching at every site. PA is already getting.ready for the voter fraud to watch for it!
3 | Larry Laibson | 10154763132039729_10154763416584729 | This is self-fulfilling prophesy being propagated by the main stream media which are totally in the tank for Hillary.The recently released Podesta email exposes the Hillary campaign playbook for rigging polls through ‚Äúoversampling‚Äù and other chicanery on how the polls are structured. Most Polls, especially those touted by main stream media, are purposely biased in favor of Clinton and the Democrats in order to show inevitability, attract voters to " the winner" or to distract voters from coming to the polls for a " candidate who has already lost." There are many competing factors including third party candidates, the hardiness of their supporters, the Independent voters, and the Enthusiasm Factor in all camps. In this last area, there is greater enthusiasm for Trump with many Hillary voters being more "anti-trump than for Hillary". There has also been a decrease in enthusiasm among Black and Young Voters compared to past elections. Phone polls are historically less accurate than on-line (tracking) polls.There are definitely some valid polls based on proper statistical sampling. Pay attention also to the "missing numbers" for these are offer the deciding factor. For example in past Georgia elections the Governor and US Senator were down about 47% to 41% about a week before the ballot but the majority of the pollsters didn't analyze and factor in the missing 12% and those who did predicted how they would vote and called the victory accurately. http://www.investors.com/politics/ibd-tipp-presidential-election-poll/

8 | Sara Richards Thompson | 10154763132039729_10154764973079729 | What a lie! I'm trying to figure out right now, why I ever pushed the like button for Washington Post.. This could not be farther from the truth. Trump is at 62% and Hillary is at 13%.... Look it up people... Do you really want to believe everything the government and the bought out newspapers and TV stations tell you? All the major corp media outlets like ABC, CBS, NBC, New York Post, Washington Post etc are owned by 6 of the wealthiest people of the world... If you don't think that politicians and banking moguls lie...... Or have motives within their little worlds to lie... Than I'm not sure there's much helping you.... üòî Donald Trump is killing this election, and these bought out media sources are scrambling to make it look otherwise so people will think there's no point in voting for him. Ask yourself why they would possibly want Hillary in there so bad? Have you researched for yourself to see what kind of people Trump and Hillary are? Do yourself a favor and research... And like I said stay away from biased, bought out company's üòï Don't let their tricks fool you. Have a blessed day

12 | Denny Bissonnette | 10154763132039729_10154763499734729 | We shouldn't get too wrapped up in the polls.Depending on the questions asked...do we know the questions?And depending just who we ask.

14 | Mark Favret | 10154763132039729_10154763207869729 | Now with this there is need to clean out the Republicans so something can get done for a change instead shutting down our government and Obstruct it as much as they have and promise to continue it.

17 | Leonor Abuke O'Brien | 10154763132039729_10154763273759729 | They say, Polls is a mechanism to make and safe public opinion. But the polls do not have enough participants, I heartily believe the results cannot be considered valid. Not all people have access to the Internet for example, so how could it be valid. What I think about this poll is that, it's a way to sway people's mind that hey the other party is leading because he/she is popular online.  And most importantly, the mainstream media are so biased not fair and balance. Americans must be careful to not put any stock into public opinion polls. If America is survive any length of time, Hillary Clinton cannot be allowed to occupy the White House. Hillary Clinton is a fraud, con artist, narcissistic liar. Plain, simple, cut, dried and flat. She is lying right to the faces of those whom she wants to elect her as their leader. And the scariest part is, they‚Äôll still vote for her anyway.Whether you like Trump or not, He will slow down the process of the globalist takeover of America. He is the only option to the immediate and complete tyrannical takeover of America. We must be careful to not let phony polling results influence our perceptions and efforts in supporting Donald Trump.
18 | Rick Buswell | 10154763132039729_10154763972934729 | Don't believe the liberal media the polls it really matter have Trump slightly ahead like a investors Business Daily which is probably the most accurate pull out there
19 | Earl Meyer | 10154763132039729_10154763890014729 | I believe it's going to be a Trump sweep of the country. If it's close the electoral college will switch it, so it cannot be close.

How in the hell can you support the continued corruption in our government?!? If Hilary wins there will be NOTHING nor No branch of government to stop her!!! She has already proven that!!! Please take off your Republican & Democrat hat & start thinking like an American!!! This country is on her knees, with her head bent down and Hilary is holding the killing sword!!!!

13 | Fred Fieldstone | 10154762492919729_10154762985544729 | Don't be duped by Donald.. 1. A constitutional amendment to impose term limits on Congress:	The Constitution provides that an amendment may be proposed either by the Congress with a two-thirds majority vote in both the House of Representatives and the Senate or by a constitutional convention called for by two-thirds of the State legislatures. None of the 27 amendments to the Constitution have been proposed by constitutional convention. The Congress proposes an amendment in the form of a joint resolution. Since the President does not have a constitutional role in the amendment process, the joint resolution does not go to the White House for signature or approval.     2.A hiring freeze on federal employees in various areas of government:	Obama has previously done this. President Obama issued an executive order implementing a 1.3 percent across the board pay increase for federal employees in 2016.The salary boost is a slight bump from the 1 percent increase civilian government workers received for 2015 and 2014. Before that, a three-year pay freeze had been in effect.   3. A requirement that for every new federal regulation, two existing regulations must be eliminated:	The Federal Rulemaking ProcessThe process of creating and enacting federal regulations is generally referred to as the "rulemaking" process.First, Congress passes a law designed to address a social or economic need or problem. The appropriate regulatory agency then creates regulations necessary to implement the law.	First, Congress passes a law     4.A five-year ban on executive government workers becoming lobbyists after leaving public service:	First, Congress passes a law     5.A ban on White House officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government:	First, Congress passes a law     6.A complete ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections:	First, Congress passes a law also:  http://www.omaha.com/news/politics/experts-explain-why-voter-fraud-is-rare/article_e7e4daf9-0b24-5d75-904d-15bcb4e84e70.html
14 | Constance N Danny Mauricio | 10154762492919729_10154762554614729 | The primaries showed that Trump got 14 million votes for him and 17 million votes against him. No one has told him about that fact And I am not talking about the 17 million votes Hillary received, I m talking about republicans.
15 | Frances Scott | 10154762492919729_10154765060299729 | Joe Hall 3 hrs ¬∑ Have you ever heard Hillary Clinton say that she loves America? Have you ever heard her supporters say that they love her and are praying for her? Didn't think so!! The masses do not like Hillary for there is nothing there to like....the Democrats do not even like Hillary...but she is all they have.....bad spot to be in and they can run but they cannot hide! I don't care if one goes to church every time the door is open and claims to be this or that...if they vote for Hillary Clinton or support her by not voting, they have serious moral and ethical issues and a really bad heart problem and are vain and self centered. We are down to where the rubber hits the road...there is little time left....America make up your mind wisely and soberly....because this is not about Republicans and Democrats...about right or left....about personalities.....it is about whether we will have a country left to leave to our children and grandchildren and others to come....for a country without borders and laws and without sovereignty is not a country but a land mass filled with people. Lots of heroes have died for what we have....lots and lots of American blood shed for what we have....lots of sweat and tears and prayers in building of America....are we going to just sit back and let it go to the control of the scum of the earth to the sewer dwellers and dumpster divers and liars and traitors and criminals never to rise again? Well, are we...and that question will be answered on November 8, 2016!!!!!
16 | Roberta Roy | 10154762492919729_10154762726579729 | We live in a country where if you have a Trump sticker, your car could be burned. If you wear a Trump hat, you could be physically attacked. Campaign headquarters are being firebombed. Innocent people are being attacked by paid thugs, that are hired to specifically invite violence by Hillary Clinton Is that the America you want your children to live in? Unlike the democrats the republicans don't call you names and physically assault you if you have a different opinion... how many times has he, his wife and Hillary gotten on tv and talked down to the American people and used their selective memory tricks... so sick of all of them...
17 | Doreen Zanni | 10154762492919729_10154765032249729 | Watched Trump's rally in Tampa last night on OAN. The dishonest media did not move the cameras around to show the crowd.Cameras just showed Trump. Saw the pictures today. There were thousands there! Dishonest media may not have shown the massive crowd but they could not mute the ROAR of the crowd! Trump 2016!
18 | Joe Armstrong | 10154762492919729_10154762687789729 | Hillary Clinton wants to establish a 65% inheritance tax on the savings and property of every Americans relatives, parents, grandparents or any other relative who "God Bless Them" pass away.  This means she wants the Federal Government to take a one-time grab using the IRS to take 65% of everything these hundreds of thousands of people strived to build and save for their entire lives.  It means as close relatives pass on in life, those they worked for their entire lives will only see 35% in inheritance.  Now, don't forget...your state inheritance taxes would also have to be added to that number and would approximate on average another 15% of the total amount of the inheritance you will probably be expecting.if any man or woman spends their lives accumulating stocks which have real estate valuations, grocery store chains, fast food chains, railroads, trucking companies, newspapers, magazines, real estate portfolio investors, tax-exempt foundations which have property holdings, why does this inheritance tax requirement not apply to anyone, any business, or any industry where an individual has spent his life accumulating property and wealth to better their heirs lives.  Why are Agricultural investments alone being targeted?Which means, in essence, every American would receive about 20% of the inheritance you thought you'd be getting.  Those who built their savings and properties wanted it all for you...Clinton wants to share a bit of it with you!Once this is law...just remember, you voted for Hillary.  Oh yeah, btw...Obamacare is going to double your costs in the next two years and Clinton is not getting rid of it.

How can unpopular Clinton be doing as well as fairly-popular Obama?
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Melissa Jeanne Byers | 10154761916544729_10154762095839729 | It's simple. Trump is absolutely unacceptable. No matter how much we dislike Hillary, Trump is dangerous. I'm voting for Tim Kaine for Vice President.
2 | Charlie Kraebel | 10154761916544729_10154762089614729 | Because more people dislike Trump than they dislike Clinton. Hillary's so-called "accomplishments" are smoke and mirrors. She barely campaigns on her own merits and instead attacks The Donald.And Trump is just a jackass. Hillary is going to win because people are going to vote against him instead of for her.
3 | Larry Laibson | 10154761916544729_10154762104779729 | Imagine if Hillary was a Republican and Trump a Democrat.......nothing else changed. main stream media would be praising Trump, ignoring all his deficiencies and would constantly attacking Hillary on front pages and lead news headlines, concentrating on her constant lies, lack of trust, lack of accomplishments, pay for play with the Foundation, private server/emails and mishandling classified material, and her very apparent health problems.
4 | Stephen Herron | 10154761916544729_10154762603354729 | It is easy to "look" popular when every poll oversampled her likely supporters (Dems) by a ridiculous amount. The media is embarrassing only itself with the propaganda they are producing.
5 | Larry Laibson | 10154761916544729_10154761999339729 | Podesta released email yesterday shows how significant preplanning goes into how the polls are structured and conducted to give significant percentage advantage to Hillary. These polls are lapped up by much of the main stream media to portray a "sure victory and you might as well stay home if you support Trump or the GOP".  Over the weekend, three Polls came out showing Trump ahead by several points. Here's one.  http://www.investors.com/politics/ibd-tipp-presidential-election-poll/
6 | Carolyn Musselwhite Ingram | 10154761916544729_10154761999374729 | Because of the 24 hour non-stop negative biased reporting on Trump while ignoring Hillary's criminal activity!  That is how.
7 | Tom Stowe | 10154761916544729_10154762000194729 | If it wasn't for certain Media promoting the Hell out of her, the shuttering of Jullian Assange's WiFi, and Trump's alleged skeleton women coming out of the woodwork to grope his campaigns genitals; then I think people would not be seeing Hillary where she is at. I am guessing Bernard would have been debating the Trumpster and Hlllary and Bill would be off to being Hillary and Bill, the Clinton Foundation, and Wall Street Speakers. What do I know though, I don't support anyone running this election cycle.
8 | Fred Fieldstone | 10154761916544729_10154763013184729 | No candidate is ever perfect. The excuse that one is just "less evil" than the other , so why vote, doesn't cut it. No choice is cowardly. Make a choice. Make them responsible for their actions or vote against them next election cycle. VOTE. Appreciate what you have.
9 | Victoria Diene | 10154761916544729_10154762126894729 | Because Trump started on the wrong foot early in the game, he demonized muslims, disrespected women and was very discriminatory. Most people remember the negative things you say, before remembering the positive.
10 | Constance N Danny Mauricio | 10154761916544729_10154762070684729 | Millions of people have been waiting to vote for Hillary since 2008. She isn't unpopular,she is lied about. Republicans lie,all they do is lie.

Their past transgressions against people of color unfolding as a day of white atonement.. as billions globally smiling watching news accounts of sadistic white mayhem and anarchy as they burn down their once beloved and admired country, The United States Of America.
15 | Harriet Goldstein | 10154761916544729_10154763288934729 | Her unpopularity is overblown and perpetuated by a media looking for a story. I just voted for Hillary with great joy.

17 | Robert Knapp | 10154761916544729_10154762352299729 | I hated Trump until I saw the media cover up Hillary's corruption and happily voted against it.
18 | Mary Linderberg | 10154761916544729_10154762073259729 | All of the alphabet media including NBC,CBS,ABC,CNN AND MSNBC have all brought a stench to the media that will never wash off.        They have ruined the trust we had in them by siding with one political party. They have tainted the names of Cronkite and Murrow with their flagrant disregard for the truth in reporting that those men stood for. (Unfortunately Wikileaks has had to take their place as true investigative journalist of yesteryear).       The integrity of the media will forever be overshadowed by their dishonesty.  (It's no wonder the American people feel that voting and the system is RIGGED with this biased news coverage).  Well said George Zayer, this so bears repeating!
19 | Frances Scott | 10154761916544729_10154761987269729 | Joe HallTrump has given us his economic plan, his plan to drain the swamp and stop the corruption, his plan to help small businesses, and his plan of action for the first 100 days of his administration....what about Hillary's plans...well, Hillary, first of all, cannot give you a plan because she first has to ask her deep pockets donors just like any bought and sold politician. That should give one pause just like the fact that she has one stance in private and one stance in public which is widely known due to the leaks. So, all we know is that if Hillary is elected, we will be getting a sick, corrupt, deranged, depraved, and undeserving criminal and just another leader from behind....another who will just add to our problems because she has no clue how America works....another who will add to our deficits and debt and America at large gets nothing in return....another who will sell us all out at the drop of a hat!! And yet millions are just waiting to vote for her because she is a woman, a Clinton, and a Democrat with nothing to show for 30 years in politics....who cannot run on her record. In the age of instant information....it is shocking how many willfully ignorant people we have that vote. If folks had to have a voter ID, and pass a Civics test, and pay taxes in order to vote....the Democrats would never win another election!!!!!
20 | Frances Scott | 10154761916544729_10154765060709729 | Joe Hall 3 hrs ¬∑ Have you ever heard Hillary Clinton say that she loves America? Have you ever heard her supporters say that they love her and are praying for her? Didn't think so!! The masses do not like Hillary for there is nothing there to like....the Democrats do not even like Hillary...but she is all they have.....bad spot to be in and they can run but they cannot hide! I don't care if one goes to church every time the door is open and claims to be this or that...if they vote for Hillary Clinton or support her by not voting, they have serious moral and ethical issues and a really bad heart problem and are vain and self centered. We are down to where the rubber hits the road...there is little time left....America make up your mind wisely and soberly....because this is not about Republicans and Democrats...about right or left....about personalities.....it is about whether we will have a country left to leave to our children and grandchildren and others to come....for a country without borders and laws and without sovereignty is not a country but a land mass filled with people. Lots of heroes have died for what we have....lots and lots of American blood shed for what we have....lots of sweat and tears and prayers in building of America....are we going to just sit back and let it go to the control of the scum of the earth to the sewer dwellers and dumpster divers and liars and traitors and criminals never to rise again? Well, are we...and that question will be answered on November 8, 2016!!!!!
21 | Roberta Roy | 10154761916544729_10154762760369729 | We live in a country where if you have a Trump sticker, your car could be burned. If you wear a Trump hat, you could be physically attacked. Campaign headquarters are being firebombed. Innocent people are being attacked by paid thugs, that are hired to specifically invite violence by Hillary Clinton Is that the America you want your children to live in? Unlike the democrats the republicans don't call you names and physically assault you if you have a different opinion... how many times has he, his wife and Hillary gotten on tv and talked down to the American people and used their selective memory tricks... so sick of all of them...
22 | Joe Armstrong | 10154761916544729_10154762794559729 | Hillary Clinton wants to establish a 65% inheritance tax on the savings and property of every Americans relatives, parents, grandparents or any other relative who "God Bless Them" pass away.  This means she wants the Federal Government to take a one-time grab using the IRS to take 65% of everything these hundreds of thousands of people strived to build and save for their entire lives.  It means as close relatives pass on in life, those they worked for their entire lives will only see 35% in inheritance.  Now, don't forget...your state inheritance taxes would also have to be added to that number and would approximate on average another 15% of the total amount of the inheritance you will probably be expecting.if any man or woman spends their lives accumulating stocks which have real estate valuations, grocery store chains, fast food chains, railroads, trucking companies, newspapers, magazines, real estate portfolio investors, tax-exempt foundations which have property holdings, why does this inheritance tax requirement not apply to anyone, any business, or any industry where an individual has spent his life accumulating property and wealth to better their heirs lives.  Why are Agricultural investments alone being targeted?Which means, in essence, every American would receive about 20% of the inheritance you thought you'd be getting.  Those who built their savings and properties wanted it all for you...Clinton wants to share a bit of it with you!Once this is law...just remember, you voted for Hillary.  Oh yeah, btw...Obamacare is going to double your costs in the next two years and Clinton is not getting rid of it.
23 | Shannon K. Walsh | 10154761916544729_10154762144849729 | Clinton is NOT unpopular
24 | Mitzi Linn | 10154761916544729_10154762335984729 | YOU are delusional...She is not unpopular...it is a media myth

1 | Kevin Lynch | 10154761897044729_10154762110119729 | Trump is a bafoon. I supported him till the fact checkers began to CLEARLY show that Trump is allergic to telling the truth.He is a snake oil salesman. He is telling everyone he is anti establishment but he tells people to vote in the obstructionist republicans.Trump is the "do as I say not as I do candidate."
2 | Coleen Fountain | 10154761897044729_10154762151074729 | Before I Cast my vote for Pres. Hillary Clinton these were the things I consider. Her accomplishments.Iran sanctions. Sec. Clinton accomplished the nearly impossible mission of getting China, Russia, the European Union and the civilized world on board with crippling sanctions against Iran. This is what brought Iran to the negotiating table.Key in rebuilding America‚Äôs leadership and prestige overseas after the Bush years. She restored our alliances with the EU and key Asian allies as well as key relationships in Africa and Latin America.Management of the State Department during which time we saw a 50 percent increase in exports to China.Aggressive work on climate (particularly at Copenhagen).She negotiated the cease-fire in Gaza that stopped the Hamas from firing rocket after rocket into Israel.She helped secure the START treaty‚Äôs ratification.Secretary Clinton was also an outspoken champion for women around the world. She set records for travel while leading the State Department and used every trip to empower the women of the 112 countries she visited. She made gender equality a priority of U.S. foreign policy. And she created the ambassador at large for global women‚Äôs issues, a post charged with integrating gender throughout the State Department.Normalization of relations with Cuba. After 55 years of sanctions that accomplished nothing except to galvanize the Castro regime, reason has finally set in. The three Bills she passed S. 3145,S.3613,S.1241. Her activism on behalf Women and children is renoun,her activism for raising the minimum wage and combating climate change is stellar. Not only am I voting for her  remembering the Govt. shutdowns by the Republican obstruction of Rand Paul, Ted cruz, Marco Rubio,Mike lee, just to name a few and others are not getting a vote from me . When you shut down the govt. you make all Americans vulnerable. We are not protected, You all affected our well being, our means of paying our bills, un due hardship.   You  have Oct. 1 to July to balance a budget.  A whole twelve months to pass Bills. We put you in office to work for the people and This Congress has been the worst Congress ever. So this is why I am not voting for those who oppose to do what they are suppose to do.These are facts and verifiable. She has the Qualifications to be my next Presidents.
3 | Betty O'Rourke | 10154761897044729_10154762409244729 | NO, you're a demagogue, a narcissist, a racist, a bigot, a fear mongering hate spewing vile human. You don't give a damm about your country.

A constitutional amendment to impose term limits on Congress:	The Constitution provides that an amendment may be proposed either by the Congress with a two-thirds majority vote in both the House of Representatives and the Senate or by a constitutional convention called for by two-thirds of the State legislatures. None of the 27 amendments to the Constitution have been proposed by constitutional convention. The Congress proposes an amendment in the form of a joint resolution. Since the President does not have a constitutional role in the amendment process, the joint resolution does not go to the White House for signature or approval.     2.A hiring freeze on federal employees in various areas of government:	Obama has previously done this. President Obama issued an executive order implementing a 1.3 percent across the board pay increase for federal employees in 2016.The salary boost is a slight bump from the 1 percent increase civilian government workers received for 2015 and 2014. Before that, a three-year pay freeze had been in effect.   3. A requirement that for every new federal regulation, two existing regulations must be eliminated:	The Federal Rulemaking ProcessThe process of creating and enacting federal regulations is generally referred to as the "rulemaking" process.First, Congress passes a law designed to address a social or economic need or problem. The appropriate regulatory agency then creates regulations necessary to implement the law.	First, Congress passes a law     4.A five-year ban on executive government workers becoming lobbyists after leaving public service:	First, Congress passes a law     5.A ban on White House officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government:	First, Congress passes a law     6.A complete ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections:	First, Congress passes a law also:  http://www.omaha.com/news/politics/experts-explain-why-voter-fraud-is-rare/article_e7e4daf9-0b24-5d75-904d-15bcb4e84e70.html

2 | Rita Diane Palmer | 10154759839274729_10154760138709729 | Trump hurriedly disbursed promised checks to veterans organizations after reporters raised questions about whether he had done so; faced questions about whether Trump University was engineered to scam its clients; and cited Judge Curiel‚Äôs ‚ÄúMexican heritage‚Äù as the reason he should step down from the Trump University trial.‚ÄúSome folks have been waiting for Act Two,‚Äù said one California GOP official. ‚ÄúNow they‚Äôre thinking, ‚ÄòOh s---.‚Äô‚ÄùTrump will always be the same person who delivered the off-the-cuff announcement speech that called Mexicans ‚Äòrapists.‚Äô People need to decide whether to embrace that or reject it.

7 | Mel Trom | 10154759839274729_10154764464694729 | Bernie will not win as write in. The only way Bernie wins is to be on Team Hillary and the Dems wrestling control of Senate and House from the sick GOP.
8 | Frances Scott | 10154759839274729_10154761990804729 | Joe HallTrump has given us his economic plan, his plan to drain the swamp and stop the corruption, his plan to help small businesses, and his plan of action for the first 100 days of his administration....what about Hillary's plans...well, Hillary, first of all, cannot give you a plan because she first has to ask her deep pockets donors just like any bought and sold politician. That should give one pause just like the fact that she has one stance in private and one stance in public which is widely known due to the leaks. So, all we know is that if Hillary is elected, we will be getting a sick, corrupt, deranged, depraved, and undeserving criminal and just another leader from behind....another who will just add to our problems because she has no clue how America works....another who will add to our deficits and debt and America at large gets nothing in return....another who will sell us all out at the drop of a hat!! And yet millions are just waiting to vote for her because she is a woman, a Clinton, and a Democrat with nothing to show for 30 years in politics....who cannot run on her record. In the age of instant information....it is shocking how many willfully ignorant people we have that vote. If folks had to have a voter ID, and pass a Civics test, and pay taxes in order to vote....the Democrats would never win another election!!!!!
9 | Mike Graham | 10154759839274729_10154759882539729 | US press over played their political propaganda hate Trump in this election. America is more divided than ever over FedGov wars, giving Billions of tax $$ to other countries, SSI Vet's not being taken care of, education, water supply's, health care cost out of control, roads bridges tax being diverted. Americans have lost control of Washington Democrat and Republican elected representatives. Their focus now is mass importing of Islamic refugees costing hundreds of Billions of our tax $$.
10 | Paul John Gavagan | 10154759839274729_10154759847804729 | My favorite part of the debate was when they asked Trump if he thought the election was rigged, meanwhile earlier in the day 2 DNC staffers were fired after the O'keefe tapes showed them rigging the election, then you assclowns in the media chastised him for his response, that type of hypocrisy is priceless
11 | Roberta Roy | 10154759839274729_10154760322644729 | We live in a country where if you have a Trump sticker, your car could be burned. If you wear a Trump hat, you could be physically attacked. Campaign headquarters are being firebombed.

Unlike the democrats the republicans don't call you names and physically assault you if you have a different opinion...

3 | Aliceann Carlton | 10154759509554729_10154759595324729 | The "out of focus" effect is due to the aperture setting on the camera to bring forward the speaker and reflect the crowd without merging both into a tough to identify view.

Republican senators and House members scrambled to protect their seats.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Danny Babcock | 10154752571494729_10154760254999729 | Come on.... I know Clinton isn‚Äôt perfect, but after the three debates, it‚Äôs very clear Trump doesn‚Äôt have the intelligence, or temperament to be President. Now add that Trump knows he's in trouble, so it's the Media, it‚Äôs the Clintons, it‚Äôs the Establishment, his shorts are too tight, it‚Äôs the rigged and corrupt system that's doing it to Trump. If the Democrats could rig elections why are the House and Senate in Republican control? If elections could be rigged, the GOP sure as hell wouldn‚Äôt have Trump as their nominee. Trump is the GOP‚Äôs Armageddon. Republicans running for offices are screwed... if they endorsed him, they're screwed‚Ä¶ if they stay silent about his ridiculous behavior they are screwed. LOL!
2 | Bella Dina | 10154752571494729_10154759955474729 | As a dead voter, I am sick of Trump accusing all dead people of rigging the elections!! Boo, your watching too many Halloween movies!!!
3 | Herbert Edgard Alamo | 10154752571494729_10154760406229729 | Hillary Clinton has vaulted to a double-digit advantage in the inaugural ABC News 2016 election tracking poll, boosted by broad disapproval of Donald Trump on two controversial issues: His treatment of women and his reluctance to endorse the election‚Äôs legitimacy.

5 | Rebecca Laskey | 10154752571494729_10154759470254729 | HARVARD HAS BROKEN A 128-YEAR OF VOTING REPUBLICAN, BECAUSE OF TRUMP!Dear Members and Alumni,In every presidential election since 1888, the members and Executive Board of the Harvard Republican Club have gathered to discuss, debate, and eventually endorse the standard-bearer of our party. But for the first time in 128 years, we, the oldest College Republicans chapter in the nation, will not be endorsing the Republican nominee.Donald Trump holds views that are antithetical to our values not only as Republicans, but as Americans. The rhetoric he espouses ‚Äìfrom racist slander to misogynistic taunts‚Äì is not consistent with our conservative principles, and his repeated mocking of the disabled and belittling of the sacrifices made by prisoners of war, Gold Star families, and Purple Heart recipients is not only bad politics, but absurdly cruel.If enacted, Donald Trump‚Äôs platform would endanger our security both at home and abroad. Domestically, his protectionist trade policies and draconian immigration restrictions would enlarge our federal deficit, raise prices for consumers, and throw our economy back into recession. Trump‚Äôs global outlook, steeped in isolationism, is considerably out-of-step with the traditional Republican stance as well. The flippancy with which he is willing to abdicate the United States‚Äô responsibility to lead is alarming. Calling for the US‚Äô withdrawal from NATO and actively endorsing nuclear proliferation, Donald Trump‚Äôs foreign policy would wreak havoc on the established world order which has held aggressive foreign powers in check since World War II.Perhaps most importantly, however, Donald Trump simply does not possess the temperament and character necessary to lead the United States through an increasingly perilous world. The last week should have made obvious to all what has been obvious to most for more than a year. In response to any slight ‚Äìperceived or real‚Äì Donald Trump lashes out viciously and irresponsibly. In Trump‚Äôs eyes, disagreement with his actions or his policies warrants incessant name calling and derision: stupid, lying, fat, ugly, weak, failing, idiot ‚Äìand that‚Äôs just his ‚Äúfellow‚Äù Republicans.He isn‚Äôt eschewing political correctness. He is eschewing basic human decency.Donald Trump, despite spending more than a year on the campaign trail, has either refused or been unable to educate himself on issues that matter most to Americans like us. He speaks only in platitudes, about greatness, success, and winning. Time and time again, Trump has demonstrated his complete lack of knowledge on critical matters, meandering from position to position over the course of the election. When confronted about these frequent reversals, Trump lies in a manner more brazen and shameless than anything politics has ever seen.Millions of people across the country are feeling despondent. Their hours have been cut, wages slashed, jobs even shipped overseas. But Donald Trump doesn‚Äôt have a plan to fix that. He has a plan to exploit that.Donald Trump is a threat to the survival of the Republic. His authoritarian tendencies and flirtations with fascism are unparalleled in the history of our democracy. He hopes to divide us by race, by class, and by religion, instilling enough fear and anxiety to propel himself to the White House. He is looking to to pit neighbor against neighbor, friend against friend, American against American. We will not stand for this vitriolic rhetoric that is poisoning our country and our children. President Reagan called on us to maintain this, our shining city on a hill. He called on us to maintain freedom abroad by keeping a strong presence in the world. He called on us to maintain liberty at home by upholding the democratic process and respecting our opponents. He called on us to maintain decency in our hearts by loving our neighbor.He would be ashamed of Donald Trump. We are too. This fall, we will instead focus our efforts on reclaiming the Republican Party from those who have done it considerable harm, campaigning for candidates who will uphold the conservative principles that have defined the Republican Party for generations. We will work to ensure both chambers of Congress remain in Republican hands, continuing to protect against executive overreach regardless of who wins the election this November.We call on our party‚Äôs elected leaders to renounce their support of Donald Trump, and urge our fellow College Republicans to join us in condemning and withholding their endorsement from this dangerous man. The conservative movement in America should not and will not go quietly into the night.A longtime student of American democracy, Alexis de Tocqueville once said, ‚ÄúAmerica is great because she is good. If America ceases to be good, America will cease to be great.‚Äù De Tocqueville believed in the United States. Americans are a decent people. We work hard, protect our own, and look out for one another in times of need, regardless of the color of our skin, the God we worship, or our party registration. Donald Trump may not believe in that America, but we do. And that America will never cease to be great.HILLARY CLINTON CANNOT TAKE AWAY SECOND AMENDMENT GUN RIGHTS WITHOUT APPROVAL OF CONGRESS.  HILLARY DOES NOT WANT TO ABOLISH YOUR 2ND AMENDMENT.  ANOTHER TRUMP LIE.AMERICA IS ALREADY GOOD AND WE ARE BETTER THAN DONALD TRUMP!REGISTER AND VOTE BLUE UP AND DOWN THE BALLOT.*****Hillary wins all 3 debates and the is the winner of the Al Smith Dinner*****#NeverTrumPutin#NoTaxesNoVote#NeverTrumpPence

That should give one pause just like the fact that she has one stance in private and one stance in public which is widely known due to the leaks. So, all we know is that if Hillary is elected, we will be getting a sick, corrupt, deranged, depraved, and undeserving criminal and just another leader from behind....another who will just add to our problems because she has no clue how America works....another who will add to our deficits and debt and America at large gets nothing in return....another who will sell us all out at the drop of a hat!! And yet millions are just waiting to vote for her because she is a woman, a Clinton, and a Democrat with nothing to show for 30 years in politics....who cannot run on her record. In the age of instant information....it is shocking how many willfully ignorant people we have that vote. If folks had to have a voter ID, and pass a Civics test, and pay taxes in order to vote....the Democrats would never win another election!!!!!

What have we gotten....NAFTA, the Iraq and Afghanistan wars which we are still fighting....the downgrade of our credit rating.....a $20 trillion debt.....historic lows for the workforce participation rate....racial division and looting and burning....Occupy and Black Lives Matter....a disintegrating infrastructure although a trillion dollar stimulus was thrown at the wall but did not stick and ended up in deep pockets....a corrupt IRS and DOJ...an overreaching and incompetent EPA....the rape of coal....a border that is still very, very porous....huge trade imbalances with Mexico and China and the giant sucking sound is still audible....a weakened military in very volatile and dangerous times....a trade of five terrorist leaders for one deserter.....200 terrorists released from Gitmo.....a huge ransom paid to Iran....increased Muslim immigration.....the disaster of Obamacare....rampant political correctness.....a do nothing Congress.....the worst recovery from a recession since the Great Depression.....no audit of the Fed....an overreaching and corrupt BLM....and thousands and thousands and thousands of pages of regulations added to the Federal register. Does anyone in their right mind want more of the same....because if Hillary Clinton is elected that is exactly what we will get. She is a stupid bought and sold nickle and dime politician and self serving career criminal which does not even recognize the problems as such and would not know how to fix them if she did...never done one thing for America at large in over thirty years in politics and in the DC scene. Trump is the only one on the radar who gives a whit about America and her people....and has what it takes to get her started back on the road to where she should be in the first place....which is so very obvious a blind man can see it!!

Since modern-day campaign finance rules were put in place in the 1970s in the wake of the Watergate scandal, no president has ever been elected with the help of wealthy contributors who doled out such huge sums.

We haven't left our brothers and sisters littered on battlefields so that you useless fucks in this administration can treat our Country like it's your personal piggy bank dictatorship. Freedom is not free and you've overdrawn your account. It's time for all of you to go. This Country still belongs to "We the people", not the Democratic Party. Please vote wisely.
3 | Kevin Lynch | 10154759062914729_10154759713549729 | I applaud this group of guys. If I had money I would use it to attack Trump on his many LIES.Trump has admitted to violating one of the Ten Commandments " Thou shall not covet thy neighbors wife."He admitted it on audio and the Republican christian base still backs him. The Republican machine supported Trump all the way till the Audio came out and the Stern tapes.There is much much more also. The man is a sexual predator as he said it was ok to refer to his own "daughter as a piece of ass". He also stated to an aquantance that he would sleep with his daughter if she wasn't his daughter.His power is obviously used for perversion.

5 | Rebecca Laskey | 10154759062914729_10154759474344729 | HARVARD HAS BROKEN A 128-YEAR OF VOTING REPUBLICAN, BECAUSE OF TRUMP!Dear Members and Alumni,In every presidential election since 1888, the members and Executive Board of the Harvard Republican Club have gathered to discuss, debate, and eventually endorse the standard-bearer of our party. But for the first time in 128 years, we, the oldest College Republicans chapter in the nation, will not be endorsing the Republican nominee.Donald Trump holds views that are antithetical to our values not only as Republicans, but as Americans. The rhetoric he espouses ‚Äìfrom racist slander to misogynistic taunts‚Äì is not consistent with our conservative principles, and his repeated mocking of the disabled and belittling of the sacrifices made by prisoners of war, Gold Star families, and Purple Heart recipients is not only bad politics, but absurdly cruel.If enacted, Donald Trump‚Äôs platform would endanger our security both at home and abroad. Domestically, his protectionist trade policies and draconian immigration restrictions would enlarge our federal deficit, raise prices for consumers, and throw our economy back into recession. Trump‚Äôs global outlook, steeped in isolationism, is considerably out-of-step with the traditional Republican stance as well. The flippancy with which he is willing to abdicate the United States‚Äô responsibility to lead is alarming. Calling for the US‚Äô withdrawal from NATO and actively endorsing nuclear proliferation, Donald Trump‚Äôs foreign policy would wreak havoc on the established world order which has held aggressive foreign powers in check since World War II.Perhaps most importantly, however, Donald Trump simply does not possess the temperament and character necessary to lead the United States through an increasingly perilous world. The last week should have made obvious to all what has been obvious to most for more than a year. In response to any slight ‚Äìperceived or real‚Äì Donald Trump lashes out viciously and irresponsibly. In Trump‚Äôs eyes, disagreement with his actions or his policies warrants incessant name calling and derision: stupid, lying, fat, ugly, weak, failing, idiot ‚Äìand that‚Äôs just his ‚Äúfellow‚Äù Republicans.He isn‚Äôt eschewing political correctness. He is eschewing basic human decency.Donald Trump, despite spending more than a year on the campaign trail, has either refused or been unable to educate himself on issues that matter most to Americans like us. He speaks only in platitudes, about greatness, success, and winning. Time and time again, Trump has demonstrated his complete lack of knowledge on critical matters, meandering from position to position over the course of the election. When confronted about these frequent reversals, Trump lies in a manner more brazen and shameless than anything politics has ever seen.Millions of people across the country are feeling despondent. Their hours have been cut, wages slashed, jobs even shipped overseas. But Donald Trump doesn‚Äôt have a plan to fix that. He has a plan to exploit that.Donald Trump is a threat to the survival of the Republic. His authoritarian tendencies and flirtations with fascism are unparalleled in the history of our democracy.

I am embarrassed for them all!Please do not give up! Vote! They are afraid of us! Let's show them why they should be!With all the TRUTH out there now, but because the media refuses to air it, with maybe the exception of Fox, there is no good reason to understand why Democrats will not support someone who cares about the safety of their country and their families! I would like to believe that those supporting HC are not gullible and sheep and koolaid drinkers, etc...and that their ONLY defense is because of a decade old sound bite from a private citizen at the time. I only know with certainty that the direction HC wants to take our country in will most certainly result in higher incidents of terror, rape, and worse! The man who killed all those innocent gay citizens in Florida, whose father stood behind her on one of her visits to Florida scared me horribly! Of course they support her open borders without the possibility of vetting! How else could they possibly come to our country and do horrific things to innocent legal citizens? I am done trying to explain this to anyone who refuses to see the truth and facts and uses the other candidates dirty talk as their big soap box Internet moment! If and when new terror takes place on either of our coasts, I will pray for the innocent! BUT I refuse to sit in my home for months on end,refusing to leave because of fear, and replaying it over and over AND over again like when 9 11 took place! Knowing that YOU could have done your part to avoid another terror attack and stood by because you were more concerned about the word "pussy" and less about the safety of you, your children, your grandchildren, and your fellow citizen, is on each of your heads, no longer on mine!God Bless my fellow Americans!Trump/Pence 2016

10 | Rebecca Laskey | 10154759059384729_10154759477879729 | HARVARD HAS BROKEN A 128-YEAR OF VOTING REPUBLICAN, BECAUSE OF TRUMP!Dear Members and Alumni,In every presidential election since 1888, the members and Executive Board of the Harvard Republican Club have gathered to discuss, debate, and eventually endorse the standard-bearer of our party. But for the first time in 128 years, we, the oldest College Republicans chapter in the nation, will not be endorsing the Republican nominee.Donald Trump holds views that are antithetical to our values not only as Republicans, but as Americans. The rhetoric he espouses ‚Äìfrom racist slander to misogynistic taunts‚Äì is not consistent with our conservative principles, and his repeated mocking of the disabled and belittling of the sacrifices made by prisoners of war, Gold Star families, and Purple Heart recipients is not only bad politics, but absurdly cruel.If enacted, Donald Trump‚Äôs platform would endanger our security both at home and abroad. Domestically, his protectionist trade policies and draconian immigration restrictions would enlarge our federal deficit, raise prices for consumers, and throw our economy back into recession. Trump‚Äôs global outlook, steeped in isolationism, is considerably out-of-step with the traditional Republican stance as well. The flippancy with which he is willing to abdicate the United States‚Äô responsibility to lead is alarming. Calling for the US‚Äô withdrawal from NATO and actively endorsing nuclear proliferation, Donald Trump‚Äôs foreign policy would wreak havoc on the established world order which has held aggressive foreign powers in check since World War II.Perhaps most importantly, however, Donald Trump simply does not possess the temperament and character necessary to lead the United States through an increasingly perilous world. The last week should have made obvious to all what has been obvious to most for more than a year. In response to any slight ‚Äìperceived or real‚Äì Donald Trump lashes out viciously and irresponsibly. In Trump‚Äôs eyes, disagreement with his actions or his policies warrants incessant name calling and derision: stupid, lying, fat, ugly, weak, failing, idiot ‚Äìand that‚Äôs just his ‚Äúfellow‚Äù Republicans.He isn‚Äôt eschewing political correctness. He is eschewing basic human decency.Donald Trump, despite spending more than a year on the campaign trail, has either refused or been unable to educate himself on issues that matter most to Americans like us. He speaks only in platitudes, about greatness, success, and winning. Time and time again, Trump has demonstrated his complete lack of knowledge on critical matters, meandering from position to position over the course of the election. When confronted about these frequent reversals, Trump lies in a manner more brazen and shameless than anything politics has ever seen.Millions of people across the country are feeling despondent. Their hours have been cut, wages slashed, jobs even shipped overseas. But Donald Trump doesn‚Äôt have a plan to fix that. He has a plan to exploit that.Donald Trump is a threat to the survival of the Republic. His authoritarian tendencies and flirtations with fascism are unparalleled in the history of our democracy. He hopes to divide us by race, by class, and by religion, instilling enough fear and anxiety to propel himself to the White House. He is looking to to pit neighbor against neighbor, friend against friend, American against American. We will not stand for this vitriolic rhetoric that is poisoning our country and our children. President Reagan called on us to maintain this, our shining city on a hill. He called on us to maintain freedom abroad by keeping a strong presence in the world. He called on us to maintain liberty at home by upholding the democratic process and respecting our opponents. He called on us to maintain decency in our hearts by loving our neighbor.He would be ashamed of Donald Trump. We are too. This fall, we will instead focus our efforts on reclaiming the Republican Party from those who have done it considerable harm, campaigning for candidates who will uphold the conservative principles that have defined the Republican Party for generations. We will work to ensure both chambers of Congress remain in Republican hands, continuing to protect against executive overreach regardless of who wins the election this November.We call on our party‚Äôs elected leaders to renounce their support of Donald Trump, and urge our fellow College Republicans to join us in condemning and withholding their endorsement from this dangerous man. The conservative movement in America should not and will not go quietly into the night.A longtime student of American democracy, Alexis de Tocqueville once said, ‚ÄúAmerica is great because she is good. If America ceases to be good, America will cease to be great.‚Äù De Tocqueville believed in the United States. Americans are a decent people. We work hard, protect our own, and look out for one another in times of need, regardless of the color of our skin, the God we worship, or our party registration. Donald Trump may not believe in that America, but we do. And that America will never cease to be great.HILLARY CLINTON CANNOT TAKE AWAY SECOND AMENDMENT GUN RIGHTS WITHOUT APPROVAL OF CONGRESS.  HILLARY DOES NOT WANT TO ABOLISH YOUR 2ND AMENDMENT.  ANOTHER TRUMP LIE.AMERICA IS ALREADY GOOD AND WE ARE BETTER THAN DONALD TRUMP!REGISTER AND VOTE BLUE UP AND DOWN THE BALLOT.*****Hillary wins all 3 debates and the is the winner of the Al Smith Dinner*****#NeverTrumPutin#NoTaxesNoVote#NeverTrumpPence

About everything the Fed touches, it completely screws it up....like healthcare and energy....because government is not the solution but the problem. The government is staffed by politicians and bureaucrats who are almost all totally self serving aka stay in power at all costs!! The Federal government has greatly increased in size under Obama, and it will be even much worse under Clinton. The Founding Fathers saw a small central government whose main functions were to provide for national security, to regulate commerce between the states, and to pass just enough legislation to keep the bad guys in check....fact!! A recent bit of information informed us that 67% of the decisions which historically have been made by the states are now made by the Federal government. In the case of government, bigger is definitely not better. So, the system needs to be dismantled from the top down and restructured the smart way....and no one on the planet is able to undertake such a monumental task but Donald J. Trump. He will run a very lean WH...no czars in every closet and no highly paid yes men...and has said that he will examine every department budget line by line looking for water, fraud, and abuse...and if he said it, he will do it....for that is his record!! The government must be taken totally out of education, energy, and healthcare for starters....how can they manage such when they cannot even balance a budget and have absolutely no expertise in these fields. Trump 2016....a true leader for a leaderless land!!!!!

What have we gotten....NAFTA, the Iraq and Afghanistan wars which we are still fighting....the downgrade of our credit rating.....a $20 trillion debt.....historic lows for the workforce participation rate....racial division and looting and burning....Occupy and Black Lives Matter....a disintegrating infrastructure although a trillion dollar stimulus was thrown at the wall but did not stick and ended up in deep pockets....a corrupt IRS and DOJ...an overreaching and incompetent EPA....the rape of coal....a border that is still very, very porous....huge trade imbalances with Mexico and China and the giant sucking sound is still audible....a weakened military in very volatile and dangerous times....a trade of five terrorist leaders for one deserter.....200 terrorists released from Gitmo.....a huge ransom paid to Iran....increased Muslim immigration.....the disaster of Obamacare....rampant political correctness.....a do nothing Congress.....the worst recovery from a recession since the Great Depression.....no audit of the Fed....an overreaching and corrupt BLM....and thousands and thousands and thousands of pages of regulations added to the Federal register. Does anyone in their right mind want more of the same....because if Hillary Clinton is elected that is exactly what we will get. She is a stupid bought and sold nickle and dime politician and self serving career criminal which does not even recognize the problems as such and would not know how to fix them if she did...never done one thing for America at large in over thirty years in politics and in the DC scene. Trump is the only one on the radar who gives a whit about America and her people....and has what it takes to get her started back on the road to where she should be in the first place....which is so very obvious a blind man can see it!! Damn the Clintons and their foundation....damn the crooked Democrats....damn the Rinos and the establishment....damn the Never Trumpers and the Cruzers.....this is a government of, by, and for the people and we shall prevail with Mr. Trump 2016....the Terminator and Mr. Clean rolled into one.

Now I am engaged in many great civil suits, testing whether I raped a 13-year-old; whether I conceived of Trump University to defraud the people. We are met on a great battlefield, where I pledge to sue the eleven women (and counting) that have endured my sexual assaults.We have come to dedicate a portion of this field, as a final resting place for the Republican Party, which Lincoln founded. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this at Gettysburg, given that the Ford Theater wasn't available.But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate, we can not consecrate, we can not hallow this ground. The brave men and women who are struggling to defeat me and elect Hillary Clinton, will crush my campaign in 3 weeks, so that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom‚Äîand that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.(Author Unknown)

The rhetoric he espouses ‚Äìfrom racist slander to misogynistic taunts‚Äì is not consistent with our conservative principles, and his repeated mocking of the disabled and belittling of the sacrifices made by prisoners of war, Gold Star families, and Purple Heart recipients is not only bad politics, but absurdly cruel.If enacted, Donald Trump‚Äôs platform would endanger our security both at home and abroad. Domestically, his protectionist trade policies and draconian immigration restrictions would enlarge our federal deficit, raise prices for consumers, and throw our economy back into recession. Trump‚Äôs global outlook, steeped in isolationism, is considerably out-of-step with the traditional Republican stance as well. The flippancy with which he is willing to abdicate the United States‚Äô responsibility to lead is alarming. Calling for the US‚Äô withdrawal from NATO and actively endorsing nuclear proliferation, Donald Trump‚Äôs foreign policy would wreak havoc on the established world order which has held aggressive foreign powers in check since World War II.Perhaps most importantly, however, Donald Trump simply does not possess the temperament and character necessary to lead the United States through an increasingly perilous world. The last week should have made obvious to all what has been obvious to most for more than a year. In response to any slight ‚Äìperceived or real‚Äì Donald Trump lashes out viciously and irresponsibly. In Trump‚Äôs eyes, disagreement with his actions or his policies warrants incessant name calling and derision: stupid, lying, fat, ugly, weak, failing, idiot ‚Äìand that‚Äôs just his ‚Äúfellow‚Äù Republicans.He isn‚Äôt eschewing political correctness. He is eschewing basic human decency.Donald Trump, despite spending more than a year on the campaign trail, has either refused or been unable to educate himself on issues that matter most to Americans like us. He speaks only in platitudes, about greatness, success, and winning. Time and time again, Trump has demonstrated his complete lack of knowledge on critical matters, meandering from position to position over the course of the election. When confronted about these frequent reversals, Trump lies in a manner more brazen and shameless than anything politics has ever seen.Millions of people across the country are feeling despondent. Their hours have been cut, wages slashed, jobs even shipped overseas. But Donald Trump doesn‚Äôt have a plan to fix that. He has a plan to exploit that.Donald Trump is a threat to the survival of the Republic. His authoritarian tendencies and flirtations with fascism are unparalleled in the history of our democracy. He hopes to divide us by race, by class, and by religion, instilling enough fear and anxiety to propel himself to the White House. He is looking to to pit neighbor against neighbor, friend against friend, American against American. We will not stand for this vitriolic rhetoric that is poisoning our country and our children. President Reagan called on us to maintain this, our shining city on a hill. He called on us to maintain freedom abroad by keeping a strong presence in the world. He called on us to maintain liberty at home by upholding the democratic process and respecting our opponents. He called on us to maintain decency in our hearts by loving our neighbor.He would be ashamed of Donald Trump. We are too. This fall, we will instead focus our efforts on reclaiming the Republican Party from those who have done it considerable harm, campaigning for candidates who will uphold the conservative principles that have defined the Republican Party for generations. We will work to ensure both chambers of Congress remain in Republican hands, continuing to protect against executive overreach regardless of who wins the election this November.We call on our party‚Äôs elected leaders to renounce their support of Donald Trump, and urge our fellow College Republicans to join us in condemning and withholding their endorsement from this dangerous man. The conservative movement in America should not and will not go quietly into the night.A longtime student of American democracy, Alexis de Tocqueville once said, ‚ÄúAmerica is great because she is good. If America ceases to be good, America will cease to be great.‚Äù De Tocqueville believed in the United States. Americans are a decent people. We work hard, protect our own, and look out for one another in times of need, regardless of the color of our skin, the God we worship, or our party registration. Donald Trump may not believe in that America, but we do. And that America will never cease to be great.HILLARY CLINTON CANNOT TAKE AWAY SECOND AMENDMENT GUN RIGHTS WITHOUT APPROVAL OF CONGRESS.  HILLARY DOES NOT WANT TO ABOLISH YOUR 2ND AMENDMENT.  ANOTHER TRUMP LIE.AMERICA IS ALREADY GOOD AND WE ARE BETTER THAN DONALD TRUMP!REGISTER AND VOTE BLUE UP AND DOWN THE BALLOT.*****Hillary wins all 3 debates and the is the winner of the Al Smith Dinner*****#NeverTrumPutin#NoTaxesNoVote#NeverTrumpPence

4 | Frances Scott | 10154759058069729_10154759671779729 | Joe HallThe current Federal government is a bloated, inefficient, incompetent, overreaching, wasteful, and corrupt mess, to say the least! About everything the Fed touches, it completely screws it up....like healthcare and energy....because government is not the solution but the problem. The government is staffed by politicians and bureaucrats who are almost all totally self serving aka stay in power at all costs!! The Federal government has greatly increased in size under Obama, and it will be even much worse under Clinton. The Founding Fathers saw a small central government whose main functions were to provide for national security, to regulate commerce between the states, and to pass just enough legislation to keep the bad guys in check....fact!! A recent bit of information informed us that 67% of the decisions which historically have been made by the states are now made by the Federal government. In the case of government, bigger is definitely not better. So, the system needs to be dismantled from the top down and restructured the smart way....and no one on the planet is able to undertake such a monumental task but Donald J. Trump. He will run a very lean WH...no czars in every closet and no highly paid yes men...and has said that he will examine every department budget line by line looking for water, fraud, and abuse...and if he said it, he will do it....for that is his record!! The government must be taken totally out of education, energy, and healthcare for starters....how can they manage such when they cannot even balance a budget and have absolutely no expertise in these fields. Trump 2016....a true leader for a leaderless land!!!!!
5 | Joe Armstrong | 10154759058069729_10154759223519729 | This election is in all honesty a referendum on higher taxes.One of the most amazing realities of Democrats is how hard they seem to extol people into voting so that they not only raise their own taxes, but they seem to want to insist that we all must be forced to comply with higher taxes.  I do not want my federal taxes raised, I do not want my state taxes raised, I do not want my inheritance & estate or property taxes raised, and I do not want sales taxes raised.  The government at all levels needs to learn to spend the huge sums of money they are already taxing us with.  A vote for any Democrat simply means every single tax I have mentioned is going to be raised.  Most amazing is the fact that 2/3rds of voting Democrats do not even pay them.
6 | Scott Wayne | 10154759058069729_10154759239854729 | Crooked Hillary is partly owned by Billionaire George Soros (American HATER). Hillary as a youth was Mentored by Saul Alinsky(Communist American HATER) to get into a position of power, at any cost, to take America down. Hillary (American HATER) sides with Islamic Radicals and promises to bring millions more refugees into America without confirmed vettting, which is likely to give us another Boston, Orlando or California Islamic Terrorrist Slaughter. Vote NO to Hillary's HATE for America by Voting YES for Trump's LOVE for all good Americans and make US SAFE $ PROSPEROUS again! Corrupt Media is America's Iron Curtain! People R turning off hillaries HATE and LIES.

What have we gotten....NAFTA, the Iraq and Afghanistan wars which we are still fighting....the downgrade of our credit rating.....a $20 trillion debt.....historic lows for the workforce participation rate....racial division and looting and burning....Occupy and Black Lives Matter....a disintegrating infrastructure although a trillion dollar stimulus was thrown at the wall but did not stick and ended up in deep pockets....a corrupt IRS and DOJ...an overreaching and incompetent EPA....the rape of coal....a border that is still very, very porous....huge trade imbalances with Mexico and China and the giant sucking sound is still audible....a weakened military in very volatile and dangerous times....a trade of five terrorist leaders for one deserter.....200 terrorists released from Gitmo.....a huge ransom paid to Iran....increased Muslim immigration.....the disaster of Obamacare....rampant political correctness.....a do nothing Congress.....the worst recovery from a recession since the Great Depression.....no audit of the Fed....an overreaching and corrupt BLM....and thousands and thousands and thousands of pages of regulations added to the Federal register. Does anyone in their right mind want more of the same....because if Hillary Clinton is elected that is exactly what we will get. She is a stupid bought and sold nickle and dime politician and self serving career criminal which does not even recognize the problems as such and would not know how to fix them if she did...never done one thing for America at large in over thirty years in politics and in the DC scene. Trump is the only one on the radar who gives a whit about America and her people....and has what it takes to get her started back on the road to where she should be in the first place....which is so very obvious a blind man can see it!! Damn the Clintons and their foundation....damn the crooked Democrats....damn the Rinos and the establishment....damn the Never Trumpers and the Cruzers.....this is a government of, by, and for the people and we shall prevail with Mr. Trump 2016....the Terminator and Mr. Clean rolled into one.

TRUMP FAMILY CHARITIES!CROOKED DONALD TRUMP AND THE TRUMP CRIME FAMILY Spent more than a quarter-million dollars from his charitable foundation to settle lawsuits that involved the billionaire‚Äôs for-profit businesses, according to interviews and a review of legal documents.Those cases, which together used $258,000 from Trump‚Äôs charity, were among four newly documented expenditures in which Trump may have violated laws against ‚Äúself-dealing‚Äù ‚Äî which prohibit nonprofit leaders from using charity money to benefit themselves or their businesses.In one case, from 2007, Trump‚Äôs Mar-a-Lago Club faced $120,000 in unpaid fines from the town of Palm Beach, Fla., resulting from a dispute over the size of a flagpole.In a settlement, Palm Beach agreed to waive those fines ‚Äî if Trump‚Äôs club made a $100,000 donation to a specific charity for veterans. Instead, Trump sent a check from the Donald J. Trump Foundation, a charity funded almost entirely by other people‚Äôs money, according to tax records.In another case, court papers say one of Trump‚Äôs golf courses in New York agreed to settle a lawsuit by making a donation to the plaintiff‚Äôs chosen charity. A $158,000 donation was made by the Trump Foundation, according to tax records.According to the report, Trump used Trump Foundation money, that would be money that was donated by other people to his charitable foundation to do charitable stuff, to pay for debts owed by Trump's personal businesses. This, however, is in keeping with Trump using Trump Foundation money for a political donation to Florida's Attorney General and to buy a portrait of him for his personal use. These all are covered by the IRS regulations prohibiting "self-dealing" by charitable organizations.New Information:  Trump asks those who owe him money to send it to his Trump Charity to avoid paying taxes on it.UPDATE: TRUMP DOES NOT HAVE THE PROPER CERTIFICATION TO SOLICIT OUTSIDE DONORS!

This is a dog whistle call to his KKK and white supremacist supporters to engage in all manner of voter suppression in close swing states. Don't be fooled people, these folks are out to sow chaos, throw the vote tally into the state courts, and steal the election. The only chance we have to stop it is to win big.

12 | Rebecca Laskey | 10154752559169729_10154757705849729 | HARVARD HAS BROKEN A 128-YEAR OF VOTING REPUBLICAN, BECAUSE OF TRUMP!Dear Members and Alumni,In every presidential election since 1888, the members and Executive Board of the Harvard Republican Club have gathered to discuss, debate, and eventually endorse the standard-bearer of our party. But for the first time in 128 years, we, the oldest College Republicans chapter in the nation, will not be endorsing the Republican nominee.Donald Trump holds views that are antithetical to our values not only as Republicans, but as Americans. The rhetoric he espouses ‚Äìfrom racist slander to misogynistic taunts‚Äì is not consistent with our conservative principles, and his repeated mocking of the disabled and belittling of the sacrifices made by prisoners of war, Gold Star families, and Purple Heart recipients is not only bad politics, but absurdly cruel.If enacted, Donald Trump‚Äôs platform would endanger our security both at home and abroad. Domestically, his protectionist trade policies and draconian immigration restrictions would enlarge our federal deficit, raise prices for consumers, and throw our economy back into recession. Trump‚Äôs global outlook, steeped in isolationism, is considerably out-of-step with the traditional Republican stance as well. The flippancy with which he is willing to abdicate the United States‚Äô responsibility to lead is alarming. Calling for the US‚Äô withdrawal from NATO and actively endorsing nuclear proliferation, Donald Trump‚Äôs foreign policy would wreak havoc on the established world order which has held aggressive foreign powers in check since World War II.Perhaps most importantly, however, Donald Trump simply does not possess the temperament and character necessary to lead the United States through an increasingly perilous world. The last week should have made obvious to all what has been obvious to most for more than a year. In response to any slight ‚Äìperceived or real‚Äì Donald Trump lashes out viciously and irresponsibly. In Trump‚Äôs eyes, disagreement with his actions or his policies warrants incessant name calling and derision: stupid, lying, fat, ugly, weak, failing, idiot ‚Äìand that‚Äôs just his ‚Äúfellow‚Äù Republicans.He isn‚Äôt eschewing political correctness. He is eschewing basic human decency.Donald Trump, despite spending more than a year on the campaign trail, has either refused or been unable to educate himself on issues that matter most to Americans like us. He speaks only in platitudes, about greatness, success, and winning. Time and time again, Trump has demonstrated his complete lack of knowledge on critical matters, meandering from position to position over the course of the election. When confronted about these frequent reversals, Trump lies in a manner more brazen and shameless than anything politics has ever seen.Millions of people across the country are feeling despondent. Their hours have been cut, wages slashed, jobs even shipped overseas. But Donald Trump doesn‚Äôt have a plan to fix that. He has a plan to exploit that.Donald Trump is a threat to the survival of the Republic. His authoritarian tendencies and flirtations with fascism are unparalleled in the history of our democracy. He hopes to divide us by race, by class, and by religion, instilling enough fear and anxiety to propel himself to the White House. He is looking to to pit neighbor against neighbor, friend against friend, American against American. We will not stand for this vitriolic rhetoric that is poisoning our country and our children. President Reagan called on us to maintain this, our shining city on a hill. He called on us to maintain freedom abroad by keeping a strong presence in the world. He called on us to maintain liberty at home by upholding the democratic process and respecting our opponents. He called on us to maintain decency in our hearts by loving our neighbor.He would be ashamed of Donald Trump. We are too. This fall, we will instead focus our efforts on reclaiming the Republican Party from those who have done it considerable harm, campaigning for candidates who will uphold the conservative principles that have defined the Republican Party for generations. We will work to ensure both chambers of Congress remain in Republican hands, continuing to protect against executive overreach regardless of who wins the election this November.We call on our party‚Äôs elected leaders to renounce their support of Donald Trump, and urge our fellow College Republicans to join us in condemning and withholding their endorsement from this dangerous man. The conservative movement in America should not and will not go quietly into the night.A longtime student of American democracy, Alexis de Tocqueville once said, ‚ÄúAmerica is great because she is good. If America ceases to be good, America will cease to be great.‚Äù De Tocqueville believed in the United States. Americans are a decent people. We work hard, protect our own, and look out for one another in times of need, regardless of the color of our skin, the God we worship, or our party registration. Donald Trump may not believe in that America, but we do. And that America will never cease to be great.HILLARY CLINTON CANNOT TAKE AWAY SECOND AMENDMENT GUN RIGHTS WITHOUT APPROVAL OF CONGRESS.  HILLARY DOES NOT WANT TO ABOLISH YOUR 2ND AMENDMENT.  ANOTHER TRUMP LIE.AMERICA IS ALREADY GOOD AND WE ARE BETTER THAN DONALD TRUMP!REGISTER AND VOTE BLUE UP AND DOWN THE BALLOT.1st DEBATE ~ EPIC FAILURE ON DONALD TRUMP‚ÄôS PART!  AND THIS GUY WANTS TO BE PRESIDENT???  I DON‚ÄôT THINK SO!  HILLARY CLEARLY WON THE DEBATE, HANDS DOWN!!!2ND DEBATE ~ WOO, WHAT A DISASTER.  TRUMP STALKED HILLARY ON STAGE AND WAS OUT OF CONTROL.  NEEDS TO PUT DOWN HE CRACK PIPE FOR AWHILE.  HILLARY WINS THIS ONE TOO.3RD AND FINAL DEBATE.  IS TRUMP OFF HIS MEDS?  TRUMP IS THE KNOWS NOTHING CANDIDATE.  THE ONLY THING HE KNOWS, IS HOW TO LIE.  HE DOES THAT QUITE WELL.  THIS IS A SICK MAN.  HILLARY TAKES ALL.#NeverTrumPutin#NoTaxesNoVote#NeverTrumpPence

16 | Mary Bunk | 10154752559169729_10154756940814729 | I have to believe that most Americans reject Trump's hate mongering.
17 | Rob Visconti | 10154752559169729_10154756917164729 | Trump just piles up the lies on top of each other. No wonder the Deplorables worship him. Same ilk. #NeverSexualAssaultPredatorTrump
18 | Rebecca Laskey | 10154752559169729_10154757706609729 | SO THE NARCISSISTIC PATHOLOGICAL SERIAL LIAR, THE GUY WHO ASSAULTS, RAPES AND DEMEANS WOMEN ASKS: "WHAT THE HELL DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE"???As a Black, Muslim, Gay AND A Woman. EVERYTHING!!Here is why:1. The misogynistic pathetic small man has shown over and over again throughout his life he has zero respect for women. He has said cringe worthy horrible/outrageous things about women all his life. He has consistently insulted, belittled, sexualized, and stereotyped women. Such insecure small man with zero respect for women and their contributions to our society should have NO place holding the highest office in the land. And he has promised to nominate conservative justices who will limit women's reproductive rights & women's ability to make informed decisions about their own bodies. This is a man who believes women should be "punished" for having an abortion. And he promised to overturn Roe vs. Wade if he gets elected. Just a little history here: "In the 1950s, estimates of numbers of illegal, unsafe abortions ranged widely, from 200,000 to 1.2 million per year. The methods used were often ineffective and dangerous. Desperate women were driven into the back alley, where they endured danger and abuse, sometimes sexual." Access to safe, legal abortion saves women's lives. The reality is there‚Äôs no such thing as no abortion. Just safe & unsafe. As a woman I can NOT afford to have a president who will take us back decades on the progress we made on women's rights. So as a woman I have everything to lose. 2.  I was raised in a Muslim family, even though I no longer consider myself a practicing Muslim. So that xenophobic con man's hate-filled rhetoric is a direct attack on my family and I. So as a Muslim American, I can NOT have afforded to have a president as hateful and careless as him. This country does NOT afford to have a man whose xenophobic rhetoric is feeding terrorist groups like ISIS's recruitment videos. A man whose hate-filled rhetoric terrorist experts believe is detrimental to the counterterrorism and anti- terrorism missions around the world. History shows a leader who believe people should be treated differently based on their religion is dangerous. So as a Muslim American I have everything to lose. 3. As a black person I can NOT afford to have a racist person who refused to disavow Ku Klux Klan as a president. A person who was the leading voice of the ‚Äúbirther‚Äù movement, a racist effort to try to delegitimize the nation's first black president. A racist person who ignored Fair Housing Act and let his employees mark applications of minorities with a 'C' for 'Colored' & refused to rent or negotiate rentals ‚Äúbecause of race and color.‚Äù A racist person whose campaign is attracting scary number of neo-Nazi white supremacist organizations. A racist man whose campaign selected white nationalist leader as a delegate. A racist man who hired Breitbart News executive chairman Steve Bannon, a leader of white supremacist group as his campaign CEO signaling his campaign is fully embracing the white supremacist alt-right & all their race-baiting ideas. A racist person whose campaign rallies looks like a klan gathering. On top of that he promised to nominate conservative justices who will take us back decades on voting rights. So as a black American I have everything to lose. 4. As a lesbian I can NOT afforded to have a president who does NOT think I should marry whoever my heart desire. The LGBT community has made historic progress in the past few years, I cannot afford to have a president who will destroy all those progresses by nominating conservative justices who will turn the clock back years. So as a gay citizen, I have everything to lose. 5. As a proud citizen of this great country who believes in American values I can NOT afford to have a self-serving, greedy, pathological liar, con-man who is walking all over those values as a president. To the white people who are not motivated by hate and resentment but still support Trump, I as a minority would like to ask you to think about how Trump's presidency affect me and people like me. I would like to sincerely ask you to reconsider your support for him. Please. To the people who are planning to vote for a third party candidate: I would like to ask you to think really, really hard. Especially, if you care about progressive ideas and believe Trump presidency will take us back decades on the progress we have made on women issues, LGBT issues...etc. The fact is we are a two-party system, Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump will be America's next president. Period! And your vote could decide the next President. Simply put, a vote that is not for Hillary is directly or indirectly a vote for Trump. Just as a note, I am NOT saying Hillary is perfect or doesn't come with a lot of baggage. So if you believe the con-man is unqualified, temperamentally unfit, and dangerous please reconsider voting for Hillary Clinton and vote blue up and down the ballot.Trump and Pence show extreme contempt towards Gays, LGBT and LGBTQ.  Both on are record as being ANTI-GAY!A vote for Trump is a lost vote - he will not become the next president of The United States of America!It is paramount that The President of The United States of America is a sane, intelligent, curious, controlled person, who is a reliable, detail-oriented, steadfast, cautious and methodical person without whom organizations and society would dissolve (fall apart). Hillary fits the aforementioned description! She is a woman, who can keep her cool!Trump on the other hand is non-reflecting and ruthless character, who lacks emphatic traits under non-sexual circumstances. He is extremely nervous and very emotional driven. He completely lacks self-knowledge! He is little bothered by second thoughts and self-doubt. That doesn't mean he is smart but that he is rather dumb. His knowledge is in general extremely limited. Since he does not reflect on his errors or analyze any mistakes to any great extent - Trump is incapable to learn from his errors, and so he will be caught in a loop, repeating his mistakes, which can have catastrophic consequences for the US, the rest of the world and possible beyond depending on the nature of his actions.In all fairness in the Vice Presidential debate Tuesday night, October 4, 2016, Mike Pence acted far more "vice presidential" than Tim Kaine, who was rude and insulting as well as he was talking over Mike Pence, who just had to sit there and take it.HOWEVER, Trump would still do the right thing if he voluntarily steps down from the presidential election campaign. Whether he steps down or not he will not be elected as the next President of The United States of America!DONALD TRUMP TRIED TO FIRE NANCY O‚ÄôDELL AFTER SHE REJECTED HIS ADVANCES!  HOW COME HE HASN‚ÄôT APOLOGIZED TO HER?  HIS APOLOGY MEANS NOTHING !!!PROMINATE GOP LEADERS ARE DITCHING DONALD TRUMP IS DROVES.  THE RNC STOPS WORK ON THE ‚ÄúVICTORY‚Äù PROJECT AND PULLS FUNDING FOR DONALD TRUMP !!!DONALD TRUMP RAPED HIS 1ST WIFE, IVANA.  THAT IS DOCUMENTED IN HER BOOK THE (LOST TYCOON).DONALD TRUMP RAPED A 13-YEAR-OLD CHILD AND THE FEDERAL CASE IS PENDING IN NEW YORK.  HE HELD HER AGAINST HER WILL AND RAPED HER REPEATEDLY‚Ä¶‚Ä¶THERE IS A WITNESS‚Ä¶..TRUMP THINKS THAT BECAUSE HE IS A ‚ÄúSTAR‚Äù THAT HE CAN GET AWAY WITH ANYTHING‚Ä¶.HE IS A ‚ÄúSEXUAL PREDATOR‚Äù, WHO NEEDS TO BE BROUGHT TO JUSTICE.  TELL YOUR MOTHERS, YOUR SISTERS AND YOUR DAUGHTERS, NOT TO VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP!!!TRUMP IS ON RECORD, IN SUPPORT OF BILL CLINTON DURING THE WHITE HOUSE SCANDAL‚Ä¶BILL CLINTON NEVER RAPED ANYONE!LEST NOT FORGET, HILLARY AND CHELSEA WERE THE VICTIMS OF BILL‚ÄôS INDESCRETIONS‚Ä¶BILL CLINTON IS NOT ON THE BALLOT!!! TRUMP THE SERIAL ABUSER/GROPER, SEXUAL PREDATOR, PEDOPHILE AND RAPIST IS !!! #NeverTrumpPence#NoTaxesNoVote#TrumpTheRapistAndPedophile
19 | Frances Scott | 10154752559169729_10154759672964729 | Joe HallThe current Federal government is a bloated, inefficient, incompetent, overreaching, wasteful, and corrupt mess, to say the least! About everything the Fed touches, it completely screws it up....like healthcare and energy....because government is not the solution but the problem. The government is staffed by politicians and bureaucrats who are almost all totally self serving aka stay in power at all costs!! The Federal government has greatly increased in size under Obama, and it will be even much worse under Clinton. The Founding Fathers saw a small central government whose main functions were to provide for national security, to regulate commerce between the states, and to pass just enough legislation to keep the bad guys in check....fact!! A recent bit of information informed us that 67% of the decisions which historically have been made by the states are now made by the Federal government. In the case of government, bigger is definitely not better. So, the system needs to be dismantled from the top down and restructured the smart way....and no one on the planet is able to undertake such a monumental task but Donald J. Trump. He will run a very lean WH...no czars in every closet and no highly paid yes men...and has said that he will examine every department budget line by line looking for water, fraud, and abuse...and if he said it, he will do it....for that is his record!! The government must be taken totally out of education, energy, and healthcare for starters....how can they manage such when they cannot even balance a budget and have absolutely no expertise in these fields. Trump 2016....a true leader for a leaderless land!!!!!
20 | Frances Scott | 10154752559169729_10154759785814729 | Joe HallThe liberals and globalists and Rinos and Democrats have had their chance for thirty years to keep America great but they have failed miserably because their po...licies were not founded on wisdom and reality but on politics and ideology. What have we gotten....NAFTA, the Iraq and Afghanistan wars which we are still fighting....the downgrade of our credit rating.....a $20 trillion debt.....historic lows for the workforce participation rate....racial division and looting and burning....Occupy and Black Lives Matter....a disintegrating infrastructure although a trillion dollar stimulus was thrown at the wall but did not stick and ended up in deep pockets....a corrupt IRS and DOJ...an overreaching and incompetent EPA....the rape of coal....a border that is still very, very porous....huge trade imbalances with Mexico and China and the giant sucking sound is still audible....a weakened military in very volatile and dangerous times....a trade of five terrorist leaders for one deserter.....200 terrorists released from Gitmo.....a huge ransom paid to Iran....increased Muslim immigration.....the disaster of Obamacare....rampant political correctness.....a do nothing Congress.....the worst recovery from a recession since the Great Depression.....no audit of the Fed....an overreaching and corrupt BLM....and thousands and thousands and thousands of pages of regulations added to the Federal register. Does anyone in their right mind want more of the same....because if Hillary Clinton is elected that is exactly what we will get. She is a stupid bought and sold nickle and dime politician and self serving career criminal which does not even recognize the problems as such and would not know how to fix them if she did...never done one thing for America at large in over thirty years in politics and in the DC scene. Trump is the only one on the radar who gives a whit about America and her people....and has what it takes to get her started back on the road to where she should be in the first place....which is so very obvious a blind man can see it!! Damn the Clintons and their foundation....damn the crooked Democrats....damn the Rinos and the establishment....damn the Never Trumpers and the Cruzers.....this is a government of, by, and for the people and we shall prevail with Mr. Trump 2016....the Terminator and Mr. Clean rolled into one.
21 | Sergey Malovatov | 10154752559169729_10154757480489729 | The Political Reality of US Presidential Election 2016Hillary Clinton is an utterly corrupt politician with a globalist agenda that has nothing to do with anything remotely related to a proper public service by a decent democratically elected state official. The concerted effort of the corrupt government, certain corporations, and most of the mainstream news media to lopsidedly praise and laud Hillary Clinton as if she was self-evidently the best possible presidential candidate in the history of the United States has become so ridiculous, extravagant, and disproportionately undemocratic that it is inevitably drawing attention to itself. Especially, if you take into account the controvercies and the conflict of interest that arose during her political career.Needless to say that the interests of the corporations do not coinside with the interests of the ordinary people. The multinationals often act in violation of their respective national regulations and laws. To make their lives easier the corporations are actively subjugating the political interests of the governments using mainstream news media outlets, social media platforms, and bloggers to promote their unlawful corporate agenda.More characteristic of a totalitarian dictatorship than a democratic republic, such closely coordinated efforts on the part of increasingly consolidated powers of the US government, multinational corporations, and the Fourth Estate, should arouse suspicion that something is definitely wrong. The democratic laws are not supposed to be violated so brazenly by so many powerful people acting in concert to support one political nominee! Pretty much in line with the globalist agenda, Hillary Clinton is waging an undeclared war against everything American, from Christian religion to Constitutional rights to cultural traditions to national borders. Despite all the recent media buzz, it becomes increasingly clear that Hillary Clinton is destructive to American society! I do pity anyone who is so severely brainwashed by the corrupt Left mainstream media's Communist propaganda that they fail to see the difference between a criminal crooked immensely corrupt politician and a real American patriotic state official or a genuine public servant!To the nation and its peoples, a corrupt and dishonest character and state criminal like Hillary Clinton is certainly a liability, and not an asset! Everybody knows that including the overwhelming majority of the American people! I hope that the American people will know better than buying into the Clinton campaign's propaganda and lies aimed at deflecting public's attention from Hillary Clinton's horrible track record and crimes!As a politician, Hillary Clinton is a political cadaver like nobody has ever seen anywhere in the world. Professionally Hillary Clinton is in the same position as her husband was after he had been disbarred and his political career had been essentially over. Although she has not yet been disbarred, Hillary Clinton would not even be able to practice law! Check out her track record starting from her bar exam and you will see that she must have been a lousy lawyer.Hullary Clinton is a total fraud in everything remotely related to her professional activity. Hillary Clinton‚Äôs only virtue is her being doggedly loyal to her rich benefactors who have donated to the Clinton Foundation. That is why she has all those scandals and crimes trailing Hillary Clinton throughout her professional life. No matter how hard hard she tries, Hillary Clinton cannot hide her faulty, incompetent, and disgustingly corrupt track record.That is the legacy of a career criminal! Now that the US government essentially acts like a private corporation, representing certain corporate interests, using the nation's largest news media as its PR asset, it was possible to promote Hillary Clinton as a presidential nominee. However, it would also mean the end of American statism as we know it, should such a scheme succeed on the part of the corporate world. The interests and the future of the overwhelming majority of American citizens would be left hanging in the air. This kind of political development would require a whole new set of policies on the part of the global elite to ensure stability and sustainable development of the Western civilization.The collusion of interests of the US Government, the corporate world, and the media gives the new establishment an immense power over the vast numbers of populace. However, it does not give the newly forged Leviathan any clues as to how to manipulate and coerce such a great number of people into nonexistence.The current state of nuclear nonproliferation agreements between various nations does not make it possible to safely start another world war in one corner of the globe without risking it to spill over in a nuclear attack anywhere else. The weapons of mass destruction make the elites as vulnerable as the masses of powerless people.Another global war is not an option. We are in a transitional period. Too much power too soon would hurt everybody. The time for the Leviathan of the "the new world order" has not come yet. The beast still has a too underdeveloped brain to be able to effectively govern the new reality of a total political power in globalist context.Therefore, the nationalist element will still be allowed to play a role to keep balance. The people's interests will still be taken into account. And a nationalist leader will be in place.Hillary Clinton was good to have displayed the power and abilities of the new political reality. However, it has also displayed its limits. Therefore, Donald J. Trump is most likely going to be elected president and Hillary Clinton, with all her criminal records and dishonesty, will enter history as a harbinger of a brave new world that we have been lucky to skip by. That is for now.

Is this a singular moment, tied exclusively to Trump‚Äôs larger-than-life personality and searing rhetoric, or has he loosed into the culture a new virus of confrontation and anger?

What a novel idea."In addition to first-day acts, Trump said he will spend the first 100 days of his term working with Congress on a series of acts to restore America's economy and security. Trump claimed his Middle Class Tax Relief Simplification Act would grow the economy by 4 percent a year and create 25 million new jobs through simplifying the tax code, regulation relief and lifting restrictions on energy production."

2 | Jill Greene | 10154756106459729_10154756183869729 | I'm hoping that the dumpster fire that is Donald Trump's existence finally awakens the US to its refusal to acknowledge its shortcomings and inspires Americans to do something to fix it. Racism, sexism including homophobia and transphobia, xenophobia, political corruption, economic inequality...we've been burying our heads in the sand about this stuff for too long. Time for us to roll up our sleeves and get some shit done.
3 | Kevin Lynch | 10154756106459729_10154756276924729 | I am one that has been personally affected in many ways by government corruption. Donald does not talk to me. Donald is exciting a fringe group who feel that others are cheating them.Many have been stuck at the same pay level because they refuse to educate to move up and all they do is bitch.His supporters ALL take vacations, own homes and have nice cloths.He has just tapped into the hateful class who blame the poor for all their problems. Fuck them too.

6 | Jeff Schrade | 10154756106459729_10154756266274729 | I am a Republican and while I don‚Äôt like Trump‚Äôs combative approach, he has tapped into the tremendous anger, fear and frustration out in much of America -- the same fear that Bernie Sanders tapped into.  As the head of Gallup recently pointed out, the percentage of Americans who say they are in the middle or upper-middle class has fallen 10 percentage points, from a 61% average between 2000 and 2008 to 51% today.  If that number turns around, I think the nation will become a happier place, both financially and politically.

7 | Danny Babcock | 10154756106459729_10154756908594729 | Come on.... I know Clinton isn‚Äôt perfect, but after the three debates, it‚Äôs very clear Trump doesn‚Äôt have the intelligence, or temperament to be President. Now add that Trump knows he's in trouble, so it's the Media, it‚Äôs the Clintons, it‚Äôs the Establishment, his shorts are too tight, it‚Äôs the rigged and corrupt system that's doing it to Trump. If the Democrats could rig elections why are the House and Senate in Republican control? If elections could be rigged, the GOP sure as hell wouldn‚Äôt have Trump as their nominee. Trump is the GOP‚Äôs Armageddon. Republicans running for offices are screwed... if they endorsed him, they're screwed‚Ä¶ if they stay silent about his ridiculous behavior they are screwed. LOL!
8 | Rita Diane Palmer | 10154756106459729_10154756750039729 | "American families are drowning in debt caused by ever-rising college costs," Clinton said in a news release, "and it is imperative that the next president put forward a bold plan to make debt-free college available to all. My New College Compact will do just that -- by making sure that working families can send a child or loved one to college tuition-free and by giving student debt holders immediate relief."

10 | Jamila Kae | 10154756106459729_10154756293139729 | The republican party has for half a century at least been fundamentally about narcissism, xenophobia, homophobia, misogyny, war-mongering and unmitigated greed.  All Donald did was put a vulgar bully's face on it.
11 | Sandi Bartlett | 10154756106459729_10154757005749729 | Hillary Clinton said.....I was horrified by what Trump said about not accepting the results of the election, we are a nation of laws>>>> Really Hillary? Then why did you break the laws of our country by bleach bit and deleting 33,000 emails, smashing blackberries and lying to Congress and the FBI? The nerve of this woman is beyond belief.
12 | Beth Lynn Stephens | 10154756106459729_10154757496399729 | Trump has revealed the urgency of term limits for Congress, Senate, etc.  They need to be either for the people of this country or get out.

18 | Rebecca Laskey | 10154756106459729_10154756257124729 | SO THE NARCISSISTIC PATHOLOGICAL SERIAL LIAR, THE GUY WHO ASSAULTS, RAPES AND DEMEANS WOMEN ASKS: "WHAT THE HELL DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE"???As a Black, Muslim, Gay AND A Woman. EVERYTHING!!Here is why:1. The misogynistic pathetic small man has shown over and over again throughout his life he has zero respect for women. He has said cringe worthy horrible/outrageous things about women all his life. He has consistently insulted, belittled, sexualized, and stereotyped women. Such insecure small man with zero respect for women and their contributions to our society should have NO place holding the highest office in the land. And he has promised to nominate conservative justices who will limit women's reproductive rights & women's ability to make informed decisions about their own bodies. This is a man who believes women should be "punished" for having an abortion. And he promised to overturn Roe vs. Wade if he gets elected. Just a little history here: "In the 1950s, estimates of numbers of illegal, unsafe abortions ranged widely, from 200,000 to 1.2 million per year. The methods used were often ineffective and dangerous. Desperate women were driven into the back alley, where they endured danger and abuse, sometimes sexual." Access to safe, legal abortion saves women's lives. The reality is there‚Äôs no such thing as no abortion. Just safe & unsafe. As a woman I can NOT afford to have a president who will take us back decades on the progress we made on women's rights. So as a woman I have everything to lose. 2.  I was raised in a Muslim family, even though I no longer consider myself a practicing Muslim. So that xenophobic con man's hate-filled rhetoric is a direct attack on my family and I. So as a Muslim American, I can NOT have afforded to have a president as hateful and careless as him. This country does NOT afford to have a man whose xenophobic rhetoric is feeding terrorist groups like ISIS's recruitment videos. A man whose hate-filled rhetoric terrorist experts believe is detrimental to the counterterrorism and anti- terrorism missions around the world. History shows a leader who believe people should be treated differently based on their religion is dangerous. So as a Muslim American I have everything to lose. 3. As a black person I can NOT afford to have a racist person who refused to disavow Ku Klux Klan as a president. A person who was the leading voice of the ‚Äúbirther‚Äù movement, a racist effort to try to delegitimize the nation's first black president. A racist person who ignored Fair Housing Act and let his employees mark applications of minorities with a 'C' for 'Colored' & refused to rent or negotiate rentals ‚Äúbecause of race and color.‚Äù A racist person whose campaign is attracting scary number of neo-Nazi white supremacist organizations. A racist man whose campaign selected white nationalist leader as a delegate. A racist man who hired Breitbart News executive chairman Steve Bannon, a leader of white supremacist group as his campaign CEO signaling his campaign is fully embracing the white supremacist alt-right & all their race-baiting ideas. A racist person whose campaign rallies looks like a klan gathering. On top of that he promised to nominate conservative justices who will take us back decades on voting rights. So as a black American I have everything to lose. 4. As a lesbian I can NOT afforded to have a president who does NOT think I should marry whoever my heart desire. The LGBT community has made historic progress in the past few years, I cannot afford to have a president who will destroy all those progresses by nominating conservative justices who will turn the clock back years. So as a gay citizen, I have everything to lose. 5. As a proud citizen of this great country who believes in American values I can NOT afford to have a self-serving, greedy, pathological liar, con-man who is walking all over those values as a president. To the white people who are not motivated by hate and resentment but still support Trump, I as a minority would like to ask you to think about how Trump's presidency affect me and people like me. I would like to sincerely ask you to reconsider your support for him. Please. To the people who are planning to vote for a third party candidate: I would like to ask you to think really, really hard. Especially, if you care about progressive ideas and believe Trump presidency will take us back decades on the progress we have made on women issues, LGBT issues...etc. The fact is we are a two-party system, Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump will be America's next president. Period! And your vote could decide the next President. Simply put, a vote that is not for Hillary is directly or indirectly a vote for Trump. Just as a note, I am NOT saying Hillary is perfect or doesn't come with a lot of baggage. So if you believe the con-man is unqualified, temperamentally unfit, and dangerous please reconsider voting for Hillary Clinton and vote blue up and down the ballot.Trump and Pence show extreme contempt towards Gays, LGBT and LGBTQ.  Both on are record as being ANTI-GAY!A vote for Trump is a lost vote - he will not become the next president of The United States of America!It is paramount that The President of The United States of America is a sane, intelligent, curious, controlled person, who is a reliable, detail-oriented, steadfast, cautious and methodical person without whom organizations and society would dissolve (fall apart). Hillary fits the aforementioned description! She is a woman, who can keep her cool!Trump on the other hand is non-reflecting and ruthless character, who lacks emphatic traits under non-sexual circumstances. He is extremely nervous and very emotional driven. He completely lacks self-knowledge! He is little bothered by second thoughts and self-doubt. That doesn't mean he is smart but that he is rather dumb. His knowledge is in general extremely limited. Since he does not reflect on his errors or analyze any mistakes to any great extent - Trump is incapable to learn from his errors, and so he will be caught in a loop, repeating his mistakes, which can have catastrophic consequences for the US, the rest of the world and possible beyond depending on the nature of his actions.In all fairness in the Vice Presidential debate Tuesday night, October 4, 2016, Mike Pence acted far more "vice presidential" than Tim Kaine, who was rude and insulting as well as he was talking over Mike Pence, who just had to sit there and take it.HOWEVER, Trump would still do the right thing if he voluntarily steps down from the presidential election campaign. Whether he steps down or not he will not be elected as the next President of The United States of America!DONALD TRUMP TRIED TO FIRE NANCY O‚ÄôDELL AFTER SHE REJECTED HIS ADVANCES!  HOW COME HE HASN‚ÄôT APOLOGIZED TO HER?  HIS APOLOGY MEANS NOTHING !!!PROMINATE GOP LEADERS ARE DITCHING DONALD TRUMP IS DROVES.

19 | Rebecca Laskey | 10154756106459729_10154756256649729 | HARVARD HAS BROKEN A 128-YEAR OF VOTING REPUBLICAN, BECAUSE OF TRUMP!Dear Members and Alumni,In every presidential election since 1888, the members and Executive Board of the Harvard Republican Club have gathered to discuss, debate, and eventually endorse the standard-bearer of our party. But for the first time in 128 years, we, the oldest College Republicans chapter in the nation, will not be endorsing the Republican nominee.Donald Trump holds views that are antithetical to our values not only as Republicans, but as Americans. The rhetoric he espouses ‚Äìfrom racist slander to misogynistic taunts‚Äì is not consistent with our conservative principles, and his repeated mocking of the disabled and belittling of the sacrifices made by prisoners of war, Gold Star families, and Purple Heart recipients is not only bad politics, but absurdly cruel.If enacted, Donald Trump‚Äôs platform would endanger our security both at home and abroad. Domestically, his protectionist trade policies and draconian immigration restrictions would enlarge our federal deficit, raise prices for consumers, and throw our economy back into recession. Trump‚Äôs global outlook, steeped in isolationism, is considerably out-of-step with the traditional Republican stance as well. The flippancy with which he is willing to abdicate the United States‚Äô responsibility to lead is alarming. Calling for the US‚Äô withdrawal from NATO and actively endorsing nuclear proliferation, Donald Trump‚Äôs foreign policy would wreak havoc on the established world order which has held aggressive foreign powers in check since World War II.Perhaps most importantly, however, Donald Trump simply does not possess the temperament and character necessary to lead the United States through an increasingly perilous world. The last week should have made obvious to all what has been obvious to most for more than a year. In response to any slight ‚Äìperceived or real‚Äì Donald Trump lashes out viciously and irresponsibly. In Trump‚Äôs eyes, disagreement with his actions or his policies warrants incessant name calling and derision: stupid, lying, fat, ugly, weak, failing, idiot ‚Äìand that‚Äôs just his ‚Äúfellow‚Äù Republicans.He isn‚Äôt eschewing political correctness. He is eschewing basic human decency.Donald Trump, despite spending more than a year on the campaign trail, has either refused or been unable to educate himself on issues that matter most to Americans like us. He speaks only in platitudes, about greatness, success, and winning. Time and time again, Trump has demonstrated his complete lack of knowledge on critical matters, meandering from position to position over the course of the election. When confronted about these frequent reversals, Trump lies in a manner more brazen and shameless than anything politics has ever seen.Millions of people across the country are feeling despondent. Their hours have been cut, wages slashed, jobs even shipped overseas. But Donald Trump doesn‚Äôt have a plan to fix that. He has a plan to exploit that.Donald Trump is a threat to the survival of the Republic. His authoritarian tendencies and flirtations with fascism are unparalleled in the history of our democracy. He hopes to divide us by race, by class, and by religion, instilling enough fear and anxiety to propel himself to the White House. He is looking to to pit neighbor against neighbor, friend against friend, American against American. We will not stand for this vitriolic rhetoric that is poisoning our country and our children. President Reagan called on us to maintain this, our shining city on a hill. He called on us to maintain freedom abroad by keeping a strong presence in the world. He called on us to maintain liberty at home by upholding the democratic process and respecting our opponents. He called on us to maintain decency in our hearts by loving our neighbor.He would be ashamed of Donald Trump. We are too. This fall, we will instead focus our efforts on reclaiming the Republican Party from those who have done it considerable harm, campaigning for candidates who will uphold the conservative principles that have defined the Republican Party for generations. We will work to ensure both chambers of Congress remain in Republican hands, continuing to protect against executive overreach regardless of who wins the election this November.We call on our party‚Äôs elected leaders to renounce their support of Donald Trump, and urge our fellow College Republicans to join us in condemning and withholding their endorsement from this dangerous man. The conservative movement in America should not and will not go quietly into the night.A longtime student of American democracy, Alexis de Tocqueville once said, ‚ÄúAmerica is great because she is good. If America ceases to be good, America will cease to be great.‚Äù De Tocqueville believed in the United States. Americans are a decent people. We work hard, protect our own, and look out for one another in times of need, regardless of the color of our skin, the God we worship, or our party registration. Donald Trump may not believe in that America, but we do. And that America will never cease to be great.HILLARY CLINTON CANNOT TAKE AWAY SECOND AMENDMENT GUN RIGHTS WITHOUT APPROVAL OF CONGRESS.  HILLARY DOES NOT WANT TO ABOLISH YOUR 2ND AMENDMENT.  ANOTHER TRUMP LIE.AMERICA IS ALREADY GOOD AND WE ARE BETTER THAN DONALD TRUMP!REGISTER AND VOTE BLUE UP AND DOWN THE BALLOT.1st DEBATE ~ EPIC FAILURE ON DONALD TRUMP‚ÄôS PART!  AND THIS GUY WANTS TO BE PRESIDENT???  I DON‚ÄôT THINK SO!  HILLARY CLEARLY WON THE DEBATE, HANDS DOWN!!!2ND DEBATE ~ WOO, WHAT A DISASTER.  TRUMP STALKED HILLARY ON STAGE AND WAS OUT OF CONTROL.  NEEDS TO PUT DOWN HE CRACK PIPE FOR AWHILE.  HILLARY WINS THIS ONE TOO.3RD AND FINAL DEBATE.  IS TRUMP OFF HIS MEDS?  TRUMP IS THE KNOWS NOTHING CANDIDATE.  THE ONLY THING HE KNOWS, IS HOW TO LIE.  HE DOES THAT QUITE WELL.  THIS IS A SICK MAN.  HILLARY TAKES ALL.#NeverTrumPutin#NoTaxesNoVote#NeverTrumpPence

22 | Paul John Gavagan | 10154756106459729_10154756170089729 | My favorite part of the debate was when they asked Trump if he thought the election was rigged, meanwhile earlier in the day 2 DNC staffers were fired after the O'keefe tapes showed them rigging the election, then you assclowns in the media chastised him for his response, that type of hypocrisy is priceless
23 | Frances Scott | 10154756106459729_10154759787074729 | Joe HallThe liberals and globalists and Rinos and Democrats have had their chance for thirty years to keep America great but they have failed miserably because their po...licies were not founded on wisdom and reality but on politics and ideology. What have we gotten....NAFTA, the Iraq and Afghanistan wars which we are still fighting....the downgrade of our credit rating.....a $20 trillion debt.....historic lows for the workforce participation rate....racial division and looting and burning....Occupy and Black Lives Matter....a disintegrating infrastructure although a trillion dollar stimulus was thrown at the wall but did not stick and ended up in deep pockets....a corrupt IRS and DOJ...an overreaching and incompetent EPA....the rape of coal....a border that is still very, very porous....huge trade imbalances with Mexico and China and the giant sucking sound is still audible....a weakened military in very volatile and dangerous times....a trade of five terrorist leaders for one deserter.....200 terrorists released from Gitmo.....a huge ransom paid to Iran....increased Muslim immigration.....the disaster of Obamacare....rampant political correctness.....a do nothing Congress.....the worst recovery from a recession since the Great Depression.....no audit of the Fed....an overreaching and corrupt BLM....and thousands and thousands and thousands of pages of regulations added to the Federal register. Does anyone in their right mind want more of the same....because if Hillary Clinton is elected that is exactly what we will get. She is a stupid bought and sold nickle and dime politician and self serving career criminal which does not even recognize the problems as such and would not know how to fix them if she did...never done one thing for America at large in over thirty years in politics and in the DC scene. Trump is the only one on the radar who gives a whit about America and her people....and has what it takes to get her started back on the road to where she should be in the first place....which is so very obvious a blind man can see it!! Damn the Clintons and their foundation....damn the crooked Democrats....damn the Rinos and the establishment....damn the Never Trumpers and the Cruzers.....this is a government of, by, and for the people and we shall prevail with Mr. Trump 2016....the Terminator and Mr. Clean rolled into one.

25 | Sergey Malovatov | 10154756106459729_10154757481639729 | The Political Reality of US Presidential Election 2016Hillary Clinton is an utterly corrupt politician with a globalist agenda that has nothing to do with anything remotely related to a proper public service by a decent democratically elected state official. The concerted effort of the corrupt government, certain corporations, and most of the mainstream news media to lopsidedly praise and laud Hillary Clinton as if she was self-evidently the best possible presidential candidate in the history of the United States has become so ridiculous, extravagant, and disproportionately undemocratic that it is inevitably drawing attention to itself. Especially, if you take into account the controvercies and the conflict of interest that arose during her political career.Needless to say that the interests of the corporations do not coinside with the interests of the ordinary people. The multinationals often act in violation of their respective national regulations and laws. To make their lives easier the corporations are actively subjugating the political interests of the governments using mainstream news media outlets, social media platforms, and bloggers to promote their unlawful corporate agenda.More characteristic of a totalitarian dictatorship than a democratic republic, such closely coordinated efforts on the part of increasingly consolidated powers of the US government, multinational corporations, and the Fourth Estate, should arouse suspicion that something is definitely wrong. The democratic laws are not supposed to be violated so brazenly by so many powerful people acting in concert to support one political nominee! Pretty much in line with the globalist agenda, Hillary Clinton is waging an undeclared war against everything American, from Christian religion to Constitutional rights to cultural traditions to national borders. Despite all the recent media buzz, it becomes increasingly clear that Hillary Clinton is destructive to American society! I do pity anyone who is so severely brainwashed by the corrupt Left mainstream media's Communist propaganda that they fail to see the difference between a criminal crooked immensely corrupt politician and a real American patriotic state official or a genuine public servant!To the nation and its peoples, a corrupt and dishonest character and state criminal like Hillary Clinton is certainly a liability, and not an asset! Everybody knows that including the overwhelming majority of the American people! I hope that the American people will know better than buying into the Clinton campaign's propaganda and lies aimed at deflecting public's attention from Hillary Clinton's horrible track record and crimes!As a politician, Hillary Clinton is a political cadaver like nobody has ever seen anywhere in the world. Professionally Hillary Clinton is in the same position as her husband was after he had been disbarred and his political career had been essentially over. Although she has not yet been disbarred, Hillary Clinton would not even be able to practice law! Check out her track record starting from her bar exam and you will see that she must have been a lousy lawyer.Hullary Clinton is a total fraud in everything remotely related to her professional activity. Hillary Clinton‚Äôs only virtue is her being doggedly loyal to her rich benefactors who have donated to the Clinton Foundation. That is why she has all those scandals and crimes trailing Hillary Clinton throughout her professional life. No matter how hard hard she tries, Hillary Clinton cannot hide her faulty, incompetent, and disgustingly corrupt track record.That is the legacy of a career criminal! Now that the US government essentially acts like a private corporation, representing certain corporate interests, using the nation's largest news media as its PR asset, it was possible to promote Hillary Clinton as a presidential nominee. However, it would also mean the end of American statism as we know it, should such a scheme succeed on the part of the corporate world. The interests and the future of the overwhelming majority of American citizens would be left hanging in the air. This kind of political development would require a whole new set of policies on the part of the global elite to ensure stability and sustainable development of the Western civilization.The collusion of interests of the US Government, the corporate world, and the media gives the new establishment an immense power over the vast numbers of populace. However, it does not give the newly forged Leviathan any clues as to how to manipulate and coerce such a great number of people into nonexistence.The current state of nuclear nonproliferation agreements between various nations does not make it possible to safely start another world war in one corner of the globe without risking it to spill over in a nuclear attack anywhere else. The weapons of mass destruction make the elites as vulnerable as the masses of powerless people.Another global war is not an option. We are in a transitional period. Too much power too soon would hurt everybody. The time for the Leviathan of the "the new world order" has not come yet. The beast still has a too underdeveloped brain to be able to effectively govern the new reality of a total political power in globalist context.Therefore, the nationalist element will still be allowed to play a role to keep balance. The people's interests will still be taken into account. And a nationalist leader will be in place.Hillary Clinton was good to have displayed the power and abilities of the new political reality. However, it has also displayed its limits. Therefore, Donald J. Trump is most likely going to be elected president and Hillary Clinton, with all her criminal records and dishonesty, will enter history as a harbinger of a brave new world that we have been lucky to skip by. That is for now.
