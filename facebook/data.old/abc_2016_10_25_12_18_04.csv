Pres. Barack Obama read one of Donald J. Trump's tweets about him while reading 'Mean Tweets' on Jimmy Kimmel Live: "President Obama will go down as perhaps the worst president in the history of the United States." Pres. Obama responded with: "Well, @realDonaldTrump, at least I will go down as a president." http://abcn.ws/2eFTlJD

1 | Jon Harding | 10154939615433812_10154939621858812 | What I found was most funny was the fact that Obama didn't disagree that the fact he will go down as the worst president in the United States of Americas history!
2 | Debbie O'Connor | 10154939615433812_10154939624858812 | Yes he IS the worse President in the history of the U.S.. I have no respect for him whatsoever. I have stopped watching Kimmell because Im tired of him bashing Trump and being so biased. Hillary is the biggest crook and liar ever and stupid people will still vote for her! #womenfortrumpandagainstcriminals
3 | Paul Germeyer | 10154939615433812_10154939632408812 | He( Obama) certainty does not act like he is president of our country, he acts like a little twisted little boy who does not have the maturity to be in the position that he is in, now how many of his followers are still praising him and Hillary after finding out how much their Obama health care is going up and that the illegals coming into our country will be given free everything,,good old democrates...
4 | Mark Rowlinson | 10154939615433812_10154939618303812 | Trump is a piece of trash. A sexual pervert with woman and has a child rape case pending. How proud Trump supporters must be to stand behind this vile evil man.
5 | Gary Doan | 10154939615433812_10154939618788812 | I have given Democrats far too much credit in the past. Everyone should realize the press is biased, but most Democrats deny it. I had assumed that some people were either naive or brainwashed, but now I'm starting to believe they appreciate and support our biased corrupt media. There no way bias is not noticeable at this point in time and I'm an deeply ashamed of all Democrats. - An Ex-Democrat.
6 | Milena Hettwer | 10154939615433812_10154939644653812 | Well it's true he isn't the best president we had in our nation, but when it comes to character and how you present yourself to people in general, I like him better than Trump or Clinton, as a Republican I don't agree with how this election has become a media circus rather than focusing on the actual issues that our nation needs to resolve.
7 | Steve Sullivan | 10154939615433812_10154939646323812 | Wonderful! Of course, in reality he's one of the two or three best Presidents of the post-World War II era, despite all the Republican obstructionism. Boy, are we gonna miss him.
8 | David Rand | 10154939615433812_10154939670463812 | I like to read. Some of things I have read recently is an article where Historians rate former and current presidents based off of who is the best and who is the worst. Obama is no where near the bottom of the pile according to academics who actually matter. Yet these people who say Obama is the worst president in US history couldn't even tell you who all of the presidents are or what they have done.
9 | Rod Grafton | 10154939615433812_10154939655743812 | It's a coruption / anti coruption vote, Obama has been corrupted by Hillary Clinton, his support is because of that Hillary is ultimately absolutely guilty, its all about the cover up..DON'T VOTE HILLARY CLINTON INNOCENT..
10 | Shellie Tuff | 10154939615433812_10154939668093812 | Because he doesn't have to address that. Instead he took the high road and made his point. There is a good book called The Best Worst President about Obama. Lots of facts in it.
11 | Dolores Liebner Dicicco | 10154939615433812_10154939655113812 | Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe’s political action committee donated nearly $500,000 to the election campaign of Dr. Jill McCabe--the wife of an FBI official who helped oversee the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server while secretary of state, the Wall Street Journal first reported.And the Virginia Democratic Party, a group over which the governor has considerable influence, contributed an additional $207,778 in the form of mailers, the campaign finance records indicate. The WSJ noted that this put donations from entities directly under McAuliffe or influenced by him at nearly $700,000, which was about a third of McCabe’s total campaign fundraising efforts. McAuliffe also reportedly recruited McCabe for the race.
12 | Suzi Reese | 10154939615433812_10154939664888812 | Tell us again obama how you didn't know about old hillary's email server. According to the new wikileak dump today, the clinton folks were really fretting because you lied to the American people....and they need to get it cleaned up. Were you fretting too?
13 | John Jordan | 10154939615433812_10154939669298812 | Would this be the same Obama who looked right into the camera's and said "I didn't know about Hillary's private email server" but was, at the same time, sending her emails there?  You mean, that same liar?
14 | Donna Selvidge | 10154939615433812_10154939668613812 | obama did what he could. cause the republicans made it clear they wouldnt do anything to help and they didnt. the only thing they did was shut the government down.
15 | Luisa Inez Newton | 10154939615433812_10154939633198812 | Obama is secure in his wonderful legacy of service to our country. Dumbo Trump is an insecure liar who is currently under indictment for fraud over fraudulent Trump University
16 | Tim Hardwick | 10154939615433812_10154939655763812 | BS he might be in the office of president but he has not been an American president and we all are counting the days till he is gone and Trump is in office.
17 | Adriene Martin | 10154939615433812_10154939654488812 | Whether you like trump or not, how can anyone support this traitor!! Or Hillary??? What the hell is wrong with you people?!?!
18 | Richie Brienza | 10154939615433812_10154939674038812 | We need to cancel the election and have him serve a 3rd term. These 2 are going to destroy the nation no matter who gets in. I voted for O twice i won't vote for either 2.
19 | Mike Camack | 10154939615433812_10154939646693812 | Obummer has accepted the fact that he's a POS that F'ed up the country. If you've never done it, big business isn't something you want to try to learn by OJT. But this fool is so arrogant that he thinks he's the bomb. Idiot!
20 | Tony Tone | 10154939615433812_10154939632238812 | We the People MUST put a stop to this corrupted and broken political system. We the People have a Voice and its Donald Trump. I encourage everyone to get out and vote, not registered then Get registered and Don't go on your own Take family members a Friend or Neighbour get out there and Vote Donald J. Trump this is the most important election in the History of this Nation. We the People will make our voice heard. This crooked establishment must be brought down
21 | Adam Lasales | 10154939615433812_10154939637888812 | It seems the articles against trump are slowing down to little to none on CNN and ABC. Makes me think he might have this election, and they are trying to back peddle as quickly as possible.

We have been cheated at a critical and complicated time. Trump's talk about a rigged system and looming voter fraud, along with his assertions that every policy is a disaster, that everyone in Washington is incompetent, and that his opponent belongs in jail undermine confidence in the pillars of our democracy itself.Well, the circus is over. It lost its magic long ago. Even the clowns are crying now. http://www usnews com/opinion/articles/2016-10-24/donald-trumps-the-biggest-2016-loser-but-not-the-only-one

Hillary Clinton has continued to praise Merrick Garland and call for his confirmation before his nomination expires in December. But it remains an open question whether Clinton, if she is elected, would submit Garland’s name for re-nomination or consider other options.

2 | Tracey A Carc | 10154939367253812_10154939378513812 | 10-24-2016 Former Hillary Clinton staffer Kathleen Kane was found guilty Tuesday of perjury and other charges. Kane was found guilty on nine felony charges in total for allegedly leaking confidential information to the media. A jury found Ms. Kane, 50, guilty of nine criminal charges, including perjury and criminal conspiracy, convicting her of leaking grand jury information, and then lying about it, in an effort to discredit a political rival.
3 | Gee Gee Allan | 10154939367253812_10154939422518812 | I know some may consider Trump's personality to be a bit over the top and even though they usually vote Republican, are considering not voting or voting third party in protest.  If for no other reason, it's important to vote for him so we get Supreme Court justices who support the constitution.

For anyone not registered to vote, please do so.... your opinion will not count if you don't vote. We, as a nation, are at a crossroads. Do we continue to travel down the path the tyrants have taken us? Or do we chart a new course and get our country back again. Trump has to win by a landslide. A "stay at home" vote, a third party vote or, worst of all, a vote for Hillary, is sending America into the abyss. FOREVER..Trump might be loud, obnoxious and offensive, but I believe he has risen, by God, to give us one last chance..This IS OUR REVOLUTION! .. Please, let your voice be heard. For our children and grandchildren......

8 | Gaines Liner | 10154939367253812_10154939404008812 | The SCOTUS has already stripped us of our freedom of choice thanks to Obamacare. The government can tax you for the things that you do, but now it can tax/fine you for not doing what it demands you do. Not wanting to buy health insurance results in a tax/fine today. Not buying an American made car might be taxed/fined tomorrow. The precedent has been set and the power given to the state to tax/fine inaction. Thanks to the shortsighted.....

It's Americans VS globalistsA socialist state by Hillary:''' ...Hillary Clinton did her college thesis on....How to create a social state by Saul Alinsky:There are 8 levels of control that must be obtained before you are able to create a social state.The first is the most important.1) Healthcare — Control healthcare and you control the people2) Poverty — Increase the Poverty level as high as possible, poor people are easier to control and will not fight back if you are providing everything for them to live.3) Debt — Increase the debt to an unsustainable level. That way you are able to increase taxes, and this will produce more poverty.4) Gun Control — Remove the ability to defend themselves from the Government. That way you are able to create a police state.5) Welfare — Take control of every aspect of their lives (Food, Housing, and Income).6) Education — Take control of what people read and listen to — take control of what children learn in school.7) Religion — Remove the belief in the God from the Government and schools.8) Class Warfare — Divide the people into the wealthy and the poor. This will cause more discontent and it will be easier to take (Tax) the wealthy with the support of the poor.Now, think ...Does any of this sound like what is happening to the United States?
10 | Arden Wickenheiser | 10154939367253812_10154939604463812 | I am appalled at how the media has been so biased in their reporting. This great nation has become a third-world country where facts are being twisted, suppressed, covered up, or not acted on; all for the purpose of getting a corrupt candidate elected. With what is known about Hillary Clinton, she couldn't get a job in corporate America. So why are people willing to make her President of the USA and leader of the of the free world?
11 | Bill Lukas | 10154939367253812_10154939456983812 | ABC is no longer a reliable source of unbiased journalism concerning the 2016 election.I for one have written off ABC as an informative news source.
12 | Welsh Jhoulys | 10154939367253812_10154939421058812 | It has to be some kind of Artificial intelligent Google-Facebook Search and Hide, that keeps anyone from looking at this question. No matter how many comments someone is willing to look through they will never see anyone's comment that includes the question of why Obama created a Health Care System Designed to fail when he was in complete control of the Congressional Law Makers.
13 | Blakeney Adams | 10154939367253812_10154939464643812 | Everyone, including myself, gets on social media and bashes the candidate they don't like. I do it to laugh at the responses and to watch heads explode with idiotic responses, but imagine this.What if Americans voted the outsider, Donald Trump, into the office of POTUS and then voted out every last single established career politician and replaced them with new blood. Replaced with Republican and Democratic leaders who owed nothing to no one except the American people. A fresh start for America with politicians that cared about you, your family, the laws and the Constitution. How great would that be for a change?Feel free to share this.
14 | Brenda Moore Stickney | 10154939367253812_10154939564553812 | The stakes this year are very, very high. The socialist machine has been gearing up for a takeover of America for the past fifty years. They’ve bought all the TV news organizations, all of the daily and weekly newspapers and magazines across the country. They’ve positioned liberal professors in all of the colleges, and left wing teachers in the high schools. Now we find that George Soros, the Socialist billionaire and Clinton supporter, even “owns” the voting machines! A patriotic man like Donald Trump, even with all of his money, can’t compete with this massive corruption. It’s been too long in the making. He can’t compete unless the truth be told. The internet may be our last hope, and the Fox Business cable news channel (for now).Hillary was promised she would win before this election began. Isn’t it strange that she is not  trying very hard to campaign? And, that no one is showing up to her events? Why there are few Hillary yard signs? She was promised the Presidency and they will deliver it, never mind what the “sheeple" want. If you’ve been watching the mainstream news or not following the news at all, you are their puppet. Frightening things are happening out there that you don’t even know about. Leaked emails have been surfacing, that are unbelievably incriminating, and yet the mainstream media pooh-poohs or ignores them. Very, very scary. She has repeatedly violated many federal codes and laws, yet nothing is done, it is covered up. Right wing conspiracy, they say, lies. But now, angry FBI agents are leaking incriminating emails, in protest of their boss ignoring her serious misdeeds. It is not Russia. It is frustrated people with information, who see the disgusting lies being told, who care deeply about America and the fraud being perpetrated on the American people. It is truly sickening that no one listens. If an “ordinary civilian Clinton” can do whatever she wants and nothing happens, wait until she is President! Very scary. It is then called a dictatorship. Obama has already begun some of the tactics. “Executive Orders” are signed every time Congress won’t “cooperate” with what he thinks should be done. The courts have stricken down his “orders” yet he continues to sign them. It’s an expensive and dangerous game the taxpayers are funding.Imagine that sort of disregard for our checks and balances, our Constitution, continuing for four more years. I can’t imagine what America will look like…. it is truly heartbreaking. The goal is to change the country from a free Republic, completely transforming America by changing its core, its people. Obama promised it, and you voted for it. Much of the rest of the world is understandably jealous of the greatness of the USA, the newcomer to the world, and they plan to have it for themselves, eventually. We are on that war path, though it may be neatly accomplished this time without firing a shot, a job from within. Vote for her and you will advance it along quite nicely.I implore you…. to seek the truth, make an informed decision. Educate yourself with anything and everything you can find out about your candidate. Knowing all that I know, it seems impossible for anyone to vote for such a corrupt and dangerous person. Remember, you don’t know what you don’t know. Please, inform yourself. Know. Don’t be their puppet.
15 | Suzanne Wright | 10154939367253812_10154939581203812 | Oh the lies! Kane was found guilty of passing information from a grand jury in PA where she held office. She passed information about members of the PA state government who were swapping port while at work. But you know Tracey it makes a good story, almost sounds like Hillary was there helping her!
16 | Josh DuBose | 10154939367253812_10154939370423812 | Hillary should appoint the most liberal justices she can find because the republicans have been obstructionist to Obama's moderate choice.
17 | Jeromy Lee Buquoi | 10154939367253812_10154939569348812 | Forget the political stuff and pay attention to what is really going on. Watch the book of Daniel come alive in the news! A perfect timeline and explanation of current events verse by verse in Chapter 11. Pass this on to the world! Daniel11truth.com/end-times-signs-current-headlines.htm God Bless All!
18 | Blakeney Adams | 10154939367253812_10154939380198812 | You can't trust anything the Clinton's say. They're gonna tell you what you want to hear but they're gonna do whatever the hell the highest payer wants. She is owned and prostituted out by George Soros and Middle Eastern oil and if she gets elected they going to be the true ones running the country. 😂😂😂
19 | Theresa Angelique Fowlkes | 10154939367253812_10154939422413812 | It's a shame OBSTRUCTIONIST Republicans refused to do their jobs to hold a hearing for who Obama nominated. They NEED TO BE VOTED OUT for that reason alone. :(
20 | Douglas H Darter | 10154939367253812_10154939415638812 | A court left of center that respects the people's rights that it governs would be a refreshing change for us all. We have tried this right wing conservatism and it's desire to force everyone to be an evangelical Christian despite the Constitution's ban on such things for long enough. I for one will be voting against that kind of behaviour until it is swept into the dustbin of history forever.
21 | Marlene T Waldron | 10154939367253812_10154939434418812 | ABC News when are you going to give coverage to the rape case brought against Donald Trump when the victim was just 13 years old?
22 | Veronica Henrick | 10154939367253812_10154939447053812 | Hillary Clinton (part2):But she wanted President Obamas to become a judge from Supreme High Court unless he is retirement. He told her no.But she is NOT a Christian, she is NOT her faith, and she is NOT believed in God. She chooses her own way; her own thinking, her own understanding, her own world, and her own depend on her feeling (gut) WITHOUT heart. If she does, she WILL struggle herself just like President Obama who had a failure and broken promised himself. Just saying.Matthew 3:2John said, "Change your hearts and lives because the kingdom of heaven is near."P.S. Hillary but even worse. She made a deal to sell uranium (or approved a deal) to Russia, I think. Since then the companies and countries have been giving the Clintons a lot of money. Before the deal, Bill Clinton made $100,000 for each speech. After that, they gave him $500,000 every time and many more speeches. So they are being paid. Obama may still play a role, in the end, times. Since the US is not in Revelations (or many other nations) it means we will not be involved in Armageddon. Since we are so powerful we would be involved but if Obama and Hillary make us so weak that another nation captures us or destroys us then it is like in the Bible, we won't exist.Don’t you know that 12 states who are suing the Obama Administration over the transgender policy that they are trying to force down the throats of the American people! Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said last week that he’s going to encourage every public school superintendent in his state to IGNORE the Obama policy requiring schools to allow students to use bathrooms and locker rooms of the gender they identify with rather than their biological sex—good for him! That’s some backbone. We need more politicians and leaders like these who will take a stand against the dangerous riptide of political correctness in this country. We can all do something—contact your representatives and school superintendents and let them know that you expect them to protect your family’s privacy and stand against policies like this that allow sexual predators inside women’s and girls’ locker rooms and bathrooms! Hillary Clinton is one of them who supported Obama. Big disappointment in them. Pray them.NOTE:Hillary Clinton didn’t show up and supported for Louisiana people aftermath flooding. So President Obama didn’t show up there for several days while he was on vacation and party really, seriously?Hillary Clinton took the money by wealthy people from International, not in the USA. Hillary Clinton’s message to coal country, “We’re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.”Hillary Clinton wanted the high taxes in the USA where she can be covered up to Syrians for housing, bills, foods, etc.Obama-Clinton Foreign Policy: 1. Dangerous nuclear deal with number one state sponsor of terrorism. 2. Paying Iran a secret $400 million ransom 3. Compromising the Security of the United States.Hillary Clinton’s husband Bill had 4 accusers by women in the past. Which one is worst raped by Bill Clinton or groped by Trump? Who’s care? That was more than 10 year between 25 years ago! Just like former ex-Miss Universal Pageant or whoever. Give me a break. “Distraction.” Stop obsession for God's sake!Personal issues should NOT be involved business political. Whoever by an evil spirit with the act to destroy without honor to God. I’m an absolutely sure that social media is controlled by the Clinton’s. So they can tell the people what to think. The Clintons, evidently, have access and control of the media.Hillary Clinton her husband Bill Clinton is saying President Obama is crazy because of Obamacare. I bet Hillary Clinton slapped his face behind the door!Hillary Clinton campaign bus dumps sewage on Georgia street (Lawrenceville, GA). Is that a good example to you?Hillary Clinton is the most dangerous person to killing unborn babies EVERYDAY from Parenthood Planning by CEO: Cecile Richards) for abortion what she said on the Third Presidencies Debate. Life and Death! Does God-honoring Hillary Clinton if she is okay for woman’s right to killing unborn babies, killing babies, or selling baby’s part is that your good example to tell your family, relatives, friends, or even children? If a man who raped me and get me a pregnant or got a pregnant, I will NOT abortion my unborn or kill the baby. I can keep my baby or give out to baby for an adoption who’s mother can’t have a baby.Hillary Clinton is the most dangerous person in the USA to killing the hundred people to throw you out into the Lake Fire of Hell lasting forever without honor to God by the soul who will be wailing, burning, screaming, teeth gnashing, and painful never stop lasting forever. Disgraceful. Why should celebrity or famous people ask the people or audience to vote for Hillary Clinton as a CRIMINAL, MURDER, PATHOLOGICAL LAIR and even her husband Bill Clinton as a RAPIST seriously, really? Do they appreciate them, uh?Galatians 6:7 (NLV)Do not be fooled. You cannot fool God. A man will get back whatever he plants!Matthew 25:41 (NLV)"Then the King will say to those on His left side,"Go away from Me! You are guilty! Go into the fire that lasts forever. It has been made ready for the devil and his angels.Matthew 25:46 (NLV)These will go to the place where they will be punished forever. But those right with God will have life that lasts forever.Revelation 20:15 (NLV)If anyone's name was not written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.1 Corinthians 6:9–10 (NLV): Do you not know that sinful men will have no place in the holy nation of God? Do not be fooled. A person who does sex sins, or who worships false gods, or who is not faithful in marriage, or men who act like women, or people who do sex sins with their own sex, will have no place in the holy nation of God. Also those who steal, or those who always want to get more of everything, or who get drunk, or who say bad things about others, or take things that are not theirs, will have no place in the holy nation of God.John 14:6 (NLV)Jesus said,"I am the Way and the Truth and the Life. No one can go to the Father except by Me.NOBODY ELSE CAN SAVE from the world but TRUST JESUS TODAY! Hillary Clinton, Elizabeth Warren, President Obama, First Lady Michelle Obama, John Kerry, and whoever will NOT save you at all but Jesus can and He will!!!!Tim Kaine (D-Virginia) is NOT honoring to God. So be it. Just pray for him no matter what. He has NO heart but fools himself, sadly. I disliked his rude, aggressive, angry, and his obsession repeating over, over, and over again on Vice Presidencies Debate, disgusting me.
23 | Anthony Castellano | 10154939367253812_10154939424608812 | He is about the best the Republicans can hope for in a Democratic administration. The senate needs to do its damn job and have an up or down vote.
24 | Gary Doan | 10154939367253812_10154939434398812 | I have given Democrats far too much credit in the past. Everyone should realize the press is biased, but most Democrats deny it. I has assumed that some people were either naive or brainwashed, but now I'm starting to believe they appreciate and support our biased corrupt media. There no way bias is not noticeable at this point in time and I'm an deeply ashamed of all Democrats. An Ex-Democrat.
25 | Johnny Saldua Jr. | 10154939367253812_10154939449688812 | Please Lord don't allow this evil woman to reign over us as a punishment. We repent. This lady would allow the murder of millions of unborn babies, open borders to anyone without screening, persecution of the church and so on.

Amid the daily din of the 2016 presidential horse-race and the flurry of comments from each of the candidates, it is often difficult to keep track of something basic - Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump's positions on the issues.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Marvin D Combs | 10154939301698812_10154939341138812 | Forget the smear campaign on both sides. Here is what we know. On immigration. Trump: Strengthen borders. Stop Syrian refugees until stringent vetting. Clinton: open borders increase Syrian refugees. On economy. Trump: Renegotiate trade deals more favorable to US. Reduce corporate tax policy allowing US companies to bring trillions back to US. Clinton: Keep corporate tax rates in place forcing more companies to seek tax breaks over seas reducing US jobs. Pro NAFTA Pro TPP. On Obamacare. Trump: Repeal and replace failed program. Clinton: Keep in place and tweak problems with program. On ISIS and national security. Trump: aggressively seek out and destroy ISIS. restore law and order to US. Clinton: Work to build more coalitions with NATO and continue failed efforts in place. On Abortion. Trump: Pro life repeal Roe v Wade end late term abortion. Clinton: Pro abortion pushing legislation to allow late term abortion during 3rd trimester. On 2nd amendment. Trump: Protect existing constitutional right to bear arms. Clinton: Push for elimination and radification of 2nd amendment abolishing right to bear arms. On Supreme Court appointees.

2 | Georgia Bailey | 10154939301698812_10154939331948812 | She has a public opinion and a personal.  That is what she told the big bankers.  So basically what she says in her rallies more than likely is not her true opinions.  Wikileaks has shown plenty of her thoughts of issues so I'm not going to take the propaganda machines word on anything.
3 | Matthew Kaye | 10154939301698812_10154939341208812 | The Media is constantly shoving Hillary Clinton down our throats , and we are gaging on her poisonous fetid mess . We did not choose her , she just decided to run on her own , and uses the Media to make it look like we are in favor of her . We are not . I am willing to vote for a woman , of any race , just not this woman, in this race .
4 | Joe White | 10154939301698812_10154939340888812 | He has no position. Just a bunch of grievances and complaints. He does not know how to implement any ideas. His advisor, Putin will be there to help him I'm sure.
5 | Susan Ann Richards | 10154939301698812_10154939332238812 | I was a voting machine judge in Ohio. It is really difficult to rig the votes there. It has to be rigged after the machines go to the Board of Elections. How do voters know their votes changed and why didn't they say something to the voting machine judge?
6 | Mark Evans | 10154939301698812_10154939337428812 | Where's nprs reporting of Terry McCullough donations to the fbi agent's wife of over 600000 dollars and the fbi decided not to press charges? Where's the report about the undercover-video democrats admitted to bussing around voters in NY? And  flooding them with absentee voting ballets? Where's the report about the unaffordable Care Act that Hillary supports and 60 plus insurancecompany's are pulling out of. And premiums going up 25 to over 100%
7 | Bren Baker | 10154939301698812_10154939411693812 | All I need to know is this:Trump pays ZERO federal taxesTrump grabs women by P* and doesn't careTrump has an upcoming trialTrump has filed bankruptcy 5 timesTrump has been married 3 times, cheated on atleast twoTrump didn't raise his own kidsTrump dodged the draftTrump has zero foreign policy experienceTrump uses his charity as a slush fundTrump paid the FL AG to not investigateTrump used charity money to buy a $10,000 portrait of himselfTrump has stiffed thousands out of millionsTrump has produced no logical plan for anythingTrump says one thing, his campaign says anotherTrump, you are done
8 | Kelly Buckley | 10154939301698812_10154939490508812 | Not really that difficult, Hillary Clinton has actual plans and has told us about them bDonald Trump tells us how great he is and to believe him while providing absolutely no proof he has a plan or how he'll do anything
9 | Cindy Reed Hansrote | 10154939301698812_10154939362808812 | Well ABC News, if you and your msm counterparts would actually be journalists and report on the issues instead of trying so hard to get a criminal elected that you spend the majority of your newscast mudslinging BS instead of talking about the issues... nobody to blame but yourselves.
10 | Tammy Davis | 10154939301698812_10154939489763812 | wow ABC is all bout Clinton. Can clearly see they are not a true news organization. Trump wants to repeal ACA aka Obama Care and replace with more cost effective model that will build competition between state lines, and use Health Savings accounts. He doesn't need to pay back insurance companies or lobbyist for funding him. Hillary wants to take away Americans guns but makes arms deals with foriegn countries. Trump believes Americans have a right to bear arms as is written in our constitution. Hillary wants to increase taxes on those making 125,000 or more. Those people who worked their whole lives to get to that point. So she can use it for her wars and climate change agenda. To make foreign contributors and wall street richer. . Trump wants to cut taxes 35 percent, so people can use their own money to make decisions about their own life and not depend on government programs. Clinton is or was under FBI investigation and everyone in her camp had to plead the 5th to protect here while letting the Russians or whoever hack her server and DNC emails? Because she put our national security at risk for her own convenience and 4 Americans died!! Trump biggest fault was that he used the tax codes that politicians including Hillary and Bill created to save money. Used the laws they created!!! Hillary will abort a baby at 9 months while we subsidies Plan parent hood that is suppose to provide birth control not abortions as stated in title x government guidelines. Trump believes that all those children with disabilities like the ones Hillary parades on stage while campaigning deserve the right to life. If it was up to her they would of been aborted!

12 | David Vincent | 10154939301698812_10154939485708812 | Since Obama has sent the Natioanal Guard collection Notices on enlistment bonuses. We the people should demand to be reimbursed for all Taxpayer Monies used for his vacations. To include cost of extra Secret Service details, Fuel and Maintenance of Air Force One!!!!!!!   Share this with your friends. If they have to payback for risking there lives, Then I want my tax monies for golf clubs and meals.
13 | Pam Noland Wilkinson | 10154939301698812_10154939534008812 | Well I got nothing from reading this news story. Read a lot of the comments and have decided it does not matter who we vote for. We are screwed either way. Hillary is a thief(skimming from her foundation according to comments) liar and married to a cheat. Trump is a thief (skimming from his foundation according to comments)liar and cheat. Yep I learned a lot.
14 | Stephen Lewis | 10154939301698812_10154939386123812 | Thanks to Wikileaks we now know that at least 65 mainstream reporters were working closely with the Clinton campaign this election year. They were invited to top elitist dinners with Hillary Campaign Chairman John Podesta or Chief Campaign strategist Joel Benenson.
15 | Kamile Smith | 10154939301698812_10154939316713812 | Trump has been called vicious for using words like Liar, corrupt, careless, nasty etc. to describe Hillary Clinton.Hillary has a 26 year history of broken promises, under the table back stabbing behind the scene deals, cover-up after cover-up, multimillion dollar Clinton foundation operations of Pay for Play, lies to protect lies, embraces hate groups and apparently violence at trump eventsAnd they call Trump vicious?This is messed up! Vote Trump/Pence and help Make America Great Again
16 | Diane Mullette | 10154939301698812_10154939404163812 | There is only one issue in this election:If you want to live in a borderless world ruled by an international govt with access to only the lowest pay jobs and no rights or freedoms vote for Hillary.If you want the Rule of Law, good paying jobs, our borders, our country, our Constitution and our rights and freedoms, vote for Trump.This is the most important election of your life. #Time4Trump
17 | Bill Breaux | 10154939301698812_10154939349843812 | Democrats are spoiled children they riot when they don't get their way, they spend all their money and then want some of yours. Democrats cannot control their lives but want to tell you how to live yours. Democrats can't take care of their own families but want tax paying non-democrat Americans to adopt illegal aliens and Muslim refugees while still paying for democrat's welfare recipients, food stampers and prison inmates......We prefer voting for Trump !
18 | Samantha Hartwell | 10154939301698812_10154939315518812 | Plain and simple Trump has NO REAL ISSUES... Other than tax breaks for the TOP 1% which none of his supporters fall under❗️
19 | Johnny Saldua Jr. | 10154939301698812_10154939456913812 | It's clear where they stand on children. Hillary doesn't mind a 9 month old baby being ripped into shreds from its mothers womb and Donald is against it. That's an intrinsic evil. You can't go any lower than that! Imagine if this was  done against the Bald Eagles,.... Oh people would e going to prison. Our nation has lost its mind

Before pressing the cast ballot button, I scanned to make sure all I had voted for appeared in the final list. All did EXCEPT my choice for President. I called the helper and she was puzzled. The judge came and she was also puzzled. I had to go back to page 1, indicate straight party ticket and then scroll down to my Presidential candidate and click on that name. After that, the final ballot appeared as I wanted and then I cast my ballot.My advice: Double check your ballot before you press the final cast ballot button."Came from a voter in the Houston area...No dems are complaining...pay attention people...voter fraud is out en force!We are getting record numbers of voters this year...Texas is a red state so most are repubs!

2 | Vicki Tate | 10154939215233812_10154939237063812 | Dear Hillary Supporter, Did you miss the part where she lied to congress? You know that’s called perjury…. Did you miss hearing about her being fired from the Watergate staff for being dishonest and unethical?How about those 33,000 emails she deleted and then had the computer wiped clean by professionals? Did you miss that? How about deleting emails after she was subpoenaed to hand them over to the Fed? You realize that’s Obstruction of Justice, right? Oh, and how about getting the rapist of a teenage girl off on rape charges then laughing about it? Did you miss that too?How about when she lied to the American people about Benghazi? You realize that story about the video was a lie, and she knew it was a lie, right?Did you miss her lying to the American people about her emails? How about when she lied about being under sniper fire?Well, then there was those times she lied about lying to the American people. Miss those too?What about that ‘pay for play’ with the Clinton Cash Foundation? That’s kind of hard to miss, huh?Did you miss all those other scandals she was in? You know… TravelGate, FileGate, WhiteWater, Rose law Firm, Vince Foster… she has a long list of scandals, you know... Did you miss her belittling her husband's sexual harassment ( and rape ) accusers? Oh – but the Paula Jones case was settled for $850,000 and Bill was impeached… for lying…You know she was labeled "Extremely careless" about national security by the FBI, right? Have you caught her latest lies about not knowing what the (C) meant on the classified documents? Or, that she can’t remember any briefings on how to handle classified material? Did you know that during her interview with the FBI she said she couldn’t remember 39 times? Did you know that during the Star Investigation she used that same defense of ‘I don’t recall’ 56 times? Did you hear her say she will raise taxes on the middle class? Did you know she had to return stolen items from the White House the last time they left? Have you seen the movies and several documentaries made about her questionable ethics? Don’t you wonder why she made congress and others spend millions and millions of tax dollars having hearings and investigating her numerous times, finding that she lied, that would not have been spent if she would have simply told the truth in the first place ! Facts - all facts ! But you are going to vote for her because.... you don't like Donald Trump ? Now, That is insane !

22 | Veronica Henrick | 10154939215233812_10154939299533812 | Obama Will "Accept" 100,000 Refugees In The US Starting 2017. Hillary Clinton WILL supported him.In a move 'spun' by John Kerry as "keeping with America’s best tradition as a land of second chances and a beacon of hope," NYTimes reports the Obama administration is willing to accept to 100,000 annually in 2017, a significant increase over the current worldwide cap of 70,000. Kerry further added that the US would explore ways to increase the limit beyond 100,000 in future years while carrying out background checks to ensure that the refugees have not been infiltrated by terrorists.Ironically, just as Europe is shutting its doors to Syrian refugees, the US is opening its own.Significantly, the countries that have generated most of the refugees are all places where the United States has invaded, overthrown governments, supported insurgencies, or intervened in a civil war. The invasion of Iraq created a power vacuum that has empowered terrorism in the Arab heartland. Supporting rebels in Syria has piled Pelion on Ossa. Afghanistan continues to bleed 14 years after the United States arrived and decided to create a democracy. Libya, which was relatively stable when the U.S. and its allies intervened, is now in chaos, with its disorder spilling over into sub-Saharan Africa.Everywhere people are fleeing the violence, which, among other benefits, has virtually obliterated the ancient Christian presence in the Middle East. Though I recognize that the refugee problem cannot be completely blamed on only one party, many of those millions would be alive and the refugees would for the most part be in their homes if it had not been for the catastrophic interventionist policies pursued by both Democratic and Republican administrations in the United States.It is perhaps past time for Washington to begin to become accountable for what it does.On Friday, Obama said that the United States will admit 10,000 Syrian refugees for resettlement over the next 12 months, following criticism that America is not doing enough with Europe's migrant crisis. It now appears, as The NY Times reports, Washington is taking on more responsibility...The Obama administration will increase the number of refugees the United States is willing to accept to 100,000 annually in 2017, a significant increase over the current worldwide cap of 70,000, Secretary of State John Kerry said on Sunday.The announcement came as Mr. Kerry conferred here with German officials on the wave of migrants that has swamped Europe and met with Syrian refugees who are seeking asylum in Europe.Under the new plan, the American limit on refugee visas would be increased to 85,000 in the fiscal year 2016. The cap would then rise to 100,000 the following year.Mr. Kerry said that the United States would explore ways to increase the limit beyond 100,000 in future years while carrying out background checks to ensure that the refugees have not been infiltrated by terrorists.“This step is in keeping with America’s best tradition as a land of second chances and a beacon of hope,” Mr. Kerry said in his prepared remarks. “And it will be accompanied by continued financial contributions to the humanitarian effort — not only from the U.S. government, but from the American people. The need is enormous, but we are determined to answer the call.”Finally, as a reminder, The United States has taken in about 1,500 Syrian refugees since the conflict began more than four years ago, while Europe has been absorbing hundreds of thousands.We Americans are in something approaching complete denial about how truly horrible our nation’s recent impact on the rest of the world has been. We are universally hated, even by those who have their hands out to receive their Danegeld, and the world is undoubtedly shaking its head as it listens to the bile coming out of the mouths of our presidential candidates. Shakespeare observed that the “evil that men do lives after them,” but he had no experience of the United States. We choose to dissimulate regarding the bad choices we make followed up with lies to justify and mitigate our crimes. And still later the evil we do disappears down the memory hole. Literally.Mr. Obama has the authority to increase the refugee cap, but Congress will need to approve additional funding. State Department officials have said that it would cost $1.1 billion to accept and resettle 70,000 refugees in 2015.*  *  *One cannot help but wonder whether US "allies" threw down some ultimata as the Washington-created refugee crisis swamps resources from Germany to Saudi Arabia...
23 | John Zilvetiz | 10154939215233812_10154939360883812 | Keep this in mind : Donald Trump did not steal your money. Donald Trump did not raise your taxes. Donald Trump did not quadruple the price of food. Trump is not stirring a race war. Trump did not leave any US soldiers in Benghazi to be slaughtered and desecrated by Muslims. Trump did not send the US Navy to fight for Syrian Al-Qaeda. Trump did not arm ISIS and systematically exterminate Christians throughout the Middle East. Trump did not betray Israel. Trump did not provide financing and technology to Iran's nuclear weapons program. Trump did not give our military secrets to China. Trump did not remove our nuclear missile shield in Poland at the behest of Russia. Trump did not shrivel our military, and betray our veterans. Trump did not cripple our economy. Trump did not increase our debt to 20 trillion dollars. Trump did not ruin our credit, twice. Trump did not double African American unemployment. Trump did not increase welfare to a record level for eight years. Trump did not sign a law making it legal to execute, and imprison Americans. Trump did not set free all of terrorists in Guantanamo bay. Trump did not steal your rights, violate US Constitutional law, or commit treason, hundreds of times. Yet Trump is being ripped apart in the news, non stop. Barrack Hussein Obama, Hillary Clinton and the criminals occupying our government, are not. The media is the Democratic Party. Save our culture.

While Donald J. Trumps non-traditional presidential campaign has attracted its share of criticism from both Democrats and Republicans alike, recent controversies have pushed many in the GOP to a breaking point.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Lisa Davis | 10154939048833812_10154939104293812 | Shame on your network for its bias position esp on your story regarding TRUMP NETWORK and media bias for HRC. 4 nods against Trump to his one blip on your morning news. Like in your face bias bias bias 😨
2 | Don Lister | 10154939048833812_10154939111188812 | Why is the media ignoring the polls predicting Trump is in the lead? I'm betting you've never heard a word about these polls in the media.Rasmussen has Trump up by 43-41 percent.USC/LA Times has Trump up by 1 point.And most importantly, the most accurate poll of the 2012 election, IBD/TIPP has Trump up 43 to 41 percent.Funny how the mainstream media doesn’t mention these polls.
3 | Tom Bower | 10154939048833812_10154939061323812 | Speaking about the Ohio senate race...I'm not sure it's very tight. I just heard yesterday that the DNC pulled some money out of the campaign because they feel it's pretty much lost. Strickland is a weak candidate. Plus there is plenty of dark money coming into Portman's campaign. His ads blanket the TV stations and I rarely see a Strickland ad.
4 | Becky L. Castille | 10154939048833812_10154939088228812 | Shame on the Republicans... You are suppose to stick together in a time of crisis. I hope y'all don't treat your family like that. Kick them to the curb when they need you most.
5 | Pete Leclair | 10154939048833812_10154939094658812 | Breaking news A 25% increase that is due November 1. How nice of the DNC to give a heads up to those who can't even make ends meet. Two weeks before a decision. I am sure this Obama care will go over well for the big insurance profits for sickness and death. Unbelievable! !!!
6 | Ellie Rodal | 10154939048833812_10154939106938812 | You should have backed your nominee... that shows more guts than running... but that is what is wrong with politicians they really don't know what the people are feeling or thinking they pretend to know and then reality bites them in the rear.  Welcome to reality, you might have had a better chance but people out here don't like spineless hypocrites as you have shown yourselves to be. Say what you want about Trump and his methods but really the man has more guts than the whole republican party...
7 | Kathy Alston-Schintgen | 10154939048833812_10154939120278812 | Maybe if they campaigned on the issues Instead of bringing up the he said, she said crap they would do better. Healthcare for one. 25% increase in already high premiums?? That's a great starting point
8 | Casey Griffith | 10154939048833812_10154939295803812 | The ones backing away from Trump are part of the establishment that Trump wants to remove from our government. At this point no one can vote for Clinton and honestly claim they believe she is innocent and trustworthy after all that has been exposed.
9 | Donna Lynne Tomak | 10154939048833812_10154939169148812 | Becky L. Castille I was about to say the same. He is there for a reason and we the people are backing and supporting him. So hear the voice of us the people and Republicans support your candidate
10 | Anthony Castellano | 10154939048833812_10154939069748812 | Down ballot Republicans should hammer away at Democrats over the Obamacare premiums increasing by double digits. Democrats own in 100%. #VoteRedUpandDowntheBallot
11 | Brenda Moore Stickney | 10154939048833812_10154939566378812 | The stakes this year are very, very high. The socialist machine has been gearing up for a takeover of America for the past fifty years. They’ve bought all the TV news organizations, all of the daily and weekly newspapers and magazines across the country. They’ve positioned liberal professors in all of the colleges, and left wing teachers in the high schools. Now we find that George Soros, the Socialist billionaire and Clinton supporter, even “owns” the voting machines! A patriotic man like Donald Trump, even with all of his money, can’t compete with this massive corruption. It’s been too long in the making. He can’t compete unless the truth be told. The internet may be our last hope, and the Fox Business cable news channel (for now).Hillary was promised she would win before this election began. Isn’t it strange that she is not  trying very hard to campaign? And, that no one is showing up to her events? Why there are few Hillary yard signs? She was promised the Presidency and they will deliver it, never mind what the “sheeple" want. If you’ve been watching the mainstream news or not following the news at all, you are their puppet. Frightening things are happening out there that you don’t even know about. Leaked emails have been surfacing, that are unbelievably incriminating, and yet the mainstream media pooh-poohs or ignores them. Very, very scary. She has repeatedly violated many federal codes and laws, yet nothing is done, it is covered up. Right wing conspiracy, they say, lies. But now, angry FBI agents are leaking incriminating emails, in protest of their boss ignoring her serious misdeeds. It is not Russia. It is frustrated people with information, who see the disgusting lies being told, who care deeply about America and the fraud being perpetrated on the American people. It is truly sickening that no one listens. If an “ordinary civilian Clinton” can do whatever she wants and nothing happens, wait until she is President! Very scary. It is then called a dictatorship. Obama has already begun some of the tactics. “Executive Orders” are signed every time Congress won’t “cooperate” with what he thinks should be done. The courts have stricken down his “orders” yet he continues to sign them. It’s an expensive and dangerous game the taxpayers are funding.Imagine that sort of disregard for our checks and balances, our Constitution, continuing for four more years. I can’t imagine what America will look like…. it is truly heartbreaking. The goal is to change the country from a free Republic, completely transforming America by changing its core, its people. Obama promised it, and you voted for it. Much of the rest of the world is understandably jealous of the greatness of the USA, the newcomer to the world, and they plan to have it for themselves, eventually. We are on that war path, though it may be neatly accomplished this time without firing a shot, a job from within. Vote for her and you will advance it along quite nicely.I implore you…. to seek the truth, make an informed decision. Educate yourself with anything and everything you can find out about your candidate. Knowing all that I know, it seems impossible for anyone to vote for such a corrupt and dangerous person. Remember, you don’t know what you don’t know. Please, inform yourself. Know. Don’t be their puppet.
12 | Gerald Logan | 10154939048833812_10154939596633812 | I can't remember any senatorial campaign in recent memory promising to vote against future legislation championed by a potential president-elect representing their OWN PARTY! Even they know Trump is nuts! You should see Pat Toomey's latest ad -- he's almost sweating!
13 | Ron Schwab | 10154939048833812_10154939183458812 | Good they will all lose because they didn't back the man that the people chose. I from Nevada will never vote for Heck or Sandoval ever again for anything. America deserves Clinton!!! Enjoy your future that will never come.
14 | Cindy Weaver | 10154939048833812_10154939644698812 | 93 million Americans eligible to vote stayed home in 2012. Only 58% of Americans eligible to vote participated in 2012. If you want your candidate to win you have to vote. The rallys are fun and can be inspiring too but if you don't vote you haven't accomplished anything for your candidate. Think about it and Vote America!
15 | Keith White | 10154939048833812_10154939519103812 | POST THIS WARNING EVERYWHERE! On election day, if your voting machine is a SmartMatic brand, DEMAND a paper ballot. George Soro’s now owns SmartMatic. You have the right to require a paper ballot, and under FEDERAL LAW the polling place MUST provide one for you. Don’t throw your vote away.
16 | Richie Hicks | 10154939048833812_10154939129168812 | I pray for us , Heavenly Father please show the people of our nation the truth , that they r being manipulated, the evil that lurks before us is real . God you built us as a nation of truth and I know you can keep us strong if we wake up . Please show the true colors of the powers that be . IN JESUS  CHRIST I PRAY AMEN
17 | Donna Fouts | 10154939048833812_10154939298658812 | ABC if you refuse to report the news honestly, don't report anything, you are a huge disappointment and I now have stopped watching GMA, after watching it for years I know how tainted you are!!!!!
18 | Arden Wickenheiser | 10154939048833812_10154939626658812 | I am appalled at how ABC News has been so biased in their reporting. This great nation has become a third-world country where facts are being twisted, suppressed, covered up, or not acted on; all for the purpose of getting a corrupt candidate elected. With what is known about Hillary Clinton, she couldn't get a job in corporate America. So why are people willing to make her President of the USA and leader of the of the free world?
19 | Louis Elias | 10154939048833812_10154939296928812 | We the People MUST put a stop to this corrupted and broken political system. We the People have a Voice and its Donald Trump. I encourage everyone to get out and vote, not registered then Get registered and Don't go on your own Take family members a Friend or Neighbour get out there and Vote Donald J. Trump this is the most important election in the History of this Nation. We the People will make our voice heard. This crooked establishment must be brought down
20 | Mark Evans | 10154939048833812_10154939340238812 | Where's nprs reporting of Terry McCullough donations to the fbi agent's wife of over 600000 dollars and the fbi decided not to press charges? Where's the report about the undercover-video democrats admitted to bussing around voters in NY? And  flooding them with absentee voting ballets? Where's the report about the unaffordable Care Act that Hillary supports and 60 plus insurancecompany's are pulling out of. And premiums going up 25 to over 100%
21 | Leslie Sloss | 10154939048833812_10154939446968812 | Trump will do what Trump does. He has divided and conquered the GOP. Trump has promoted sexual assault on women with his lewd comments to Billy Bush. Trump has mocked the disabled. Trump has insulted race after race. Trump has consulted with HIMSELF on military issues and watched shows for foreign polilcy advice. Trump has accused Hillary of being crooked and YET there are accusations of him doing some of the same things he has accused her of doing. Everything Trump is accused of, he is a master of spinning it onto Hillary. Just do a little serious research on all of this. I'm not posting this to argue and I won't argue. These are just some of the truths about Trump and his run for presidency. He is tiresome, boring and will fade into the night eventually. I am an independent voter, by the way, who quickly turned my back when Trump mocked that disabled reporter. That in itself was enough for me. It's right on video. All of his messes are either on audio or video and he STILL denies these things. The wikileaks, promoted by a hack from Russia, has shown no smoking guns. It was reported that Trump was informed that Russia was behind the leaks and Trump still denied it. He doesn't question that a foreign entity hacked into our system. In fact, he asks them to find more of Hillary's emails. That didn't surprise me because Trump and Pence both praise Putin. That is not patriotic to me. Then the Associated Press posted a story, 11/22/14 about the GOP, republican run house, at the time, had found no wrongdoing in the Obama Administration in Benghazi, during their investigation. And after 11 hours of grueling testimony from Hillary last year, still, no criminal charges. After all this is said and done, like I said, Trump mocking that disabled reporter was all it took for me to realize where Trump's heart was. After praising Putin, I realized, for myself, where I feel his allegiance lies. He has tried to divide this country by saying he will only accept the election results if he "wins". Again, that is not patriotic. In fact, it sounds like a bully tactic to get my vote. No thanks. I think, in fact I know, my vote will go to Hillary. I know she is not perfect. For me, better, by far, than the alternative.
22 | Gary Hackworth | 10154939048833812_10154939365668812 | LMAO....get real....The media polls are wrong and have been wrong for several election cycles. The reason is simple. The media are okay with them being wrong. They were wrong in Maryland when they missed the gubernatorial election by over 14%. Otherwise, they would have had to predict a Republican win in 2014. They wanted to help the Turdocrat, so under-reporting for a Republican candidate is part of their playbook.
23 | Dar Lian | 10154939048833812_10154939390678812 | shame on you ! ABC news and three replican candadates , if you or your sons are nominees no one will support them like you just did right now to your own party!
24 | Carol Roy | 10154939048833812_10154939138088812 | I don't know how Ayotte could say just a couple weeks ago that Trump was a good role model for children and now she is distancing herself from him...he's the same guy who mocked a disabled journalist...
25 | Jan Bucher | 10154939048833812_10154939445178812 | Clearly you don't care or think it matters what Americans think..but when   they do down..so do those who helped...you are replaceable..just give it time..first was shocked,surprised,now ashamed what people do for money

1 | Terri Wilkinson Rushing | 10154939015963812_10154939049213812 | I agree with Trump and lots of us out here I polled feel the same way! This reminds me when Bush won and the media had been telling us he was going to lose! The day after he won the media was so shocked and that was all they could talk about! Y'all are so biased!!!
2 | Don Lister | 10154939015963812_10154939112088812 | Why is the media ignoring the polls predicting Trump is in the lead?

3 | Pete Leclair | 10154939015963812_10154939059058812 | Breaking news that the media sets aside. A 25% increase insurance for profit health care. Someone is making billions off of the tax payers. Profit for illness. A disgrace to those who cannot even eat or keep up with house issues and family while big insurance is making billions
4 | Andy Maviglia | 10154939015963812_10154939081573812 | In 14 days the stress of a Drumpf presidency will be gone. His racist bigoted rhetoric will be out of the news and we can focus on keeping America great again with another Democrat POTUS.
5 | Darrell Davidodetchenstein | 10154939015963812_10154939048678812 | No stress for me @ all! Living comfortable in my skin, knowing that I cast my ballot against fascism, hatred, xenophobia, ignorance, bigotry and racism.
6 | Debbie DiOrio Tatarowicz | 10154939015963812_10154939528308812 | Media is biased and their "polls" are too- and meant to influence the public in the direction of their bias. Some people are dumb enough to vote according to what they think majorities are doing, as reported by inaccurate and biased "polls". Many times in history the "polls" have been dead wrong. We won't know until it's over. I can say this- nobody asked me! I'm a woman and I can't stand either Hillary or Trump!
7 | Jill Janes | 10154939015963812_10154939539623812 | Yes I have stress! My eyes were opened to the fact that racism and the pure hate of people that aren't the same as you exists to such an existent it blows my mind. It is heartbreaking! And it makes me physically ill.....
8 | Vicki Tate | 10154939015963812_10154939290098812 | What about "Those Damn E-Mails"Hillary Clinton’s conduct in setting up a private e-mail server which transmitted top secret information and the FBI declining to recommend criminal charges demonstrates that she is above the law. Worse, Hillary acts like there is one law for her and her family and one law for everyone else. Oh, she takes “full responsibility” for her e-mails while saying other Secretaries of State have done the same. So when Hillary takes full responsibility for something, she is really taking no responsibility at all. This is a very dangerous quality for someone who seeks the office of President of the United States to possess.BenghaziAny government official who feels the need to ask, “At this point what does difference does it make?” where it concerns the deaths of four Americans including our Ambassador to Libya is unfit to be President of the United States. Mind you she asked this question after publicly blaming an internet video for the attack on the consulate, an attack that just happened to occur on the 11th anniversary of the September 11th attacks. Of course, her e-mail correspondence with daughter Chelsea on the attack indicated it was carried out by an “al Qaeda like group.” Again, Hillary takes full responsibility, but as she told Scott Pelley on 60 Minutes, “It was not my ball to carry.” We’ve come a long way from “The Buck stops here” to “It was not my ball to carry.” In this case, a long way isn’t a good way.The Clinton FoundationIs Donald Trump correct to say that Hillary Clinton turned the State Department into her family’s personal hedge fund by using the Clinton Foundation to sell access to foreign governments, many of which have dubious human rights records? Well, Trump ought to know. He helped fund the Clinton Foundation. At the very minimum, there is the appearance of impropriety. At worst, there’s enough corruption to put the UN to shame.Russian ResetHillary Clinton has got Russia wrong from the moment she gave Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov a red button that was supposed to say reset in Russian. But instead of saying ‘perezagruzka’ it read ‘peregruzka,’ which means overcharged. It is nevertheless somehow fitting. Hillary may be the only person who actually believes the Russian reset worked. She claimed this because it brought the Russians around on sanctions against Iran. Well, where are those sanctions now? Also the people of Ukraine and Crimea might disagree with that assessment. Oh, things have been reset all right when a 3-Star Russian general can walk into the U.S. Embassy in Iraq and tell our military to get the hell of the sky.

If a man who raped me and get me a pregnant or got a pregnant, I will NOT abortion my unborn or kill the baby. I can keep my baby or give out to baby for an adoption who’s mother can’t have a baby.Hillary Clinton is the most dangerous person in the USA to killing the hundred people to throw you out into the Lake Fire of Hell lasting forever without honor to God by the soul who will be wailing, burning, screaming, teeth gnashing, and painful never stop lasting forever.

17 | Doug Lambert | 10154939015963812_10154939207348812 | The "election" is still 2 weeks away. It is the endless toxic stream of propaganda and puerile insults that not only demeans both candidates, but the "process" and the nation itself.
18 | Stephen Lewis | 10154939015963812_10154939389113812 | Thanks to Wikileaks we now know that at least 65 mainstream reporters were working closely with the Clinton campaign this election year. They were invited to top elitist dinners with Hillary Campaign Chairman John Podesta or Chief Campaign strategist Joel Benenson.
19 | Ronald Desfosses | 10154939015963812_10154939320808812 | I can point at one direct cause of stress. You  ABC and your obvious coruption trying to get a known criminal elected and throwing out your lies to discourage Trump supporters. IT ISNT WORKING.
20 | Shawn Edwards | 10154939015963812_10154939097768812 | I voted already so the stress is pretty much gone now. I'm stress free because I voted my Conscience and neither Hillary nor Trump got my vote.
21 | Doug Lambert | 10154939015963812_10154939214233812 | Don---it's bc a "lead" of less than 3 points is statistically insignificant. The 3% is a "cushion" against errors in data either way.
22 | Betty Jo Carpenter | 10154939015963812_10154939342893812 | Once again you miss the point --  it is not the stress of the election --  it is the stress of a media that is willing to lie, cheat and steal to get their candidate elected
23 | John Krum | 10154939015963812_10154939132913812 | Don't vote for the lying corrupt Hillary this election unless you want fewer jobs, 100,000 more isis refugees, loss of your 2nd amendment rights and higher taxes for the middle class. Remember she tells you the voter one thing and will do the opposite. She's a liar.
24 | Gary Doan | 10154939015963812_10154939441143812 | I have given Democrats far too much credit in the past. Everyone should realize the press is biased, but most Democrats deny it. I has assumed that some people were either naive or brainwashed, but now I'm starting to believe they appreciate and support our biased corrupt media. There no way bias is not noticeable at this point in time and I'm an deeply ashamed of all Democrats. An Ex-Democrat.
25 | Mike Singer | 10154939015963812_10154939369988812 | WASHINGTON (AP) -- Premiums will go up sharply next year under President Obama's health care law, and many consumers will be down to just one insurer, the administration confirmed Monday. Premiums for a most plans will increase an average of 25% across the country by the federally run online market....and Hillary is bound to expand Obama Care? We CAN'T AFFORD THAT!!!!!

It's Americans VS globalistsA socialist state by Hillary:''' ...Hillary Clinton did her college thesis on....How to create a social state by Saul Alinsky:There are 8 levels of control that must be obtained before you are able to create a social state.The first is the most important.1) Healthcare — Control healthcare and you control the people2) Poverty — Increase the Poverty level as high as possible, poor people are easier to control and will not fight back if you are providing everything for them to live.3) Debt — Increase the debt to an unsustainable level. That way you are able to increase taxes, and this will produce more poverty.4) Gun Control — Remove the ability to defend themselves from the Government. That way you are able to create a police state.5) Welfare — Take control of every aspect of their lives (Food, Housing, and Income).6) Education — Take control of what people read and listen to — take control of what children learn in school.7) Religion — Remove the belief in the God from the Government and schools.8) Class Warfare — Divide the people into the wealthy and the poor. This will cause more discontent and it will be easier to take (Tax) the wealthy with the support of the poor.Now, think ...Does any of this sound like what is happening to the United States?

1 | Stephanie Shearer Risher | 10154938877658812_10154938887938812 | ABC...you make me sick! NOT credible and bias....Can we please her about these emails??...You know the 33000 deleted ones or how about WIKILEAKS-- Explain the corruption and lies for YOUR candidate-- GO TRUMP!
2 | JJ Harris | 10154938877658812_10154938894943812 | Make sure you vote for Trump on election day. The media has done nothing but lie this whole election why wouldn't they with this. Stay vigilant my friends they're hoping by posting this we'll get discouraged and not cast our ballots!
3 | Ryan Beers | 10154938877658812_10154938891998812 | Are you sure? Or are you simply trying to sway voters to the winning side? I wonder how every media outlet has different numbers? In some cases even a different leader
4 | John Coppola | 10154938877658812_10154938891843812 | Forget the smear campaign on both sides. Here is what we know. on immigration. Trump: Strengthen borders. Stop Syrian refugees until stringent vetting. Clinton: open borders increase Syrian refugees. on economy. Trump: Renegotiate trade deals more favorable to US. Reduce corporate tax policy allowing US companies to bring trillions back to US. Clinton: Keep corporate tax rates in place forcing more companies to seek tax breaks over seas reducing US jobs. Pro NAFTA Pro TPP. on Obamacare. Trump: Repeal and replace failed program. Clinton: Keep in place and tweak problems with program. on ISIS and national security. Trump: aggressively seek out and destroy ISIS. restore law and order to US. Clinton: Work to build more coalitions with NATO and continue failed efforts in place. on Abortion. Trump: Pro life repeal Roe v Wade end late term abortion. Clinton: Pro abortion pushing legislation to allow late term abortion during 3rd trimester. on 2nd amendment. Trump: Protect existing constitutional right to bear arms. Clinton: Push for elimination and radification of 2nd amendment abolishing right to bear arms. on Supreme Court appointees. Trump: Conservative appointees abiding by US constitution. Clinton : Liberal appointees moving toward a more open and accepting inclusive branch of government. on Government spending. Trump: eliminate waste fraud and abuse. reign in government spending. Clinton: Increase government spending by throwing more tax dollars at failed policies. on energy policy. Trump: develop and pursue energy from US companies. increase US consumption from existing clean coal. solar. wind and alternate sources. Clinton: eliminate clean coal pursuing additional energy sources abroad from middle east. on campaign reform. Trump: establish term limits. eliminate super pacs reducing big money from favoritism in government. Clinton: promoting pay for play politics as usual. if you can look through the smoke screen these are important issues every American really needs to weigh in on. Vote 2016 your vote counts!!
5 | Tina Vickers Nolen | 10154938877658812_10154938911898812 | People!  We just need to get out and vote to prove abc wrong!!  That will be one of the greatest victory!! The other will be having Trump as President!!
6 | Steven McCurdy | 10154938877658812_10154938891878812 | More drivel from the guts of hell....in 1980 with 5 days until election day, carter was up by 9 points....Reagan won a landslide.....ABC PRAVDA is a just propaganda...
7 | Sharon Puckett | 10154938877658812_10154938907468812 | WHY VOTE FOR TRUMP? . • 13,000,000 more Americans are on food stamps • We are $20 trillion in debt • One in six men ages 18-34 are incarcerated or out of the work force • The media is against Trump • Establishment Republicans are against Trump • 95,000,000 million Americans are out of the labor force • We have the worst economic recovery since the 1940s • We have the lowest home ownership rate in over 50 years • Obamacare is a complete disaster • We are less secure and our borders are wide open • Trump will work to stop executive overreach • Trump will get rid of waste, fraud and abuse • Trump will bring back true law and order in this country • Trump will appoint Supreme Court justices who adhere to the Constitution • Trump will close our borders – a nation is not a nation with open borders • Trump will lower taxes and “really” close loopholes • Trump will stop ISIS • Trump will focus on getting rid of common core • Trump supports our military and our veterans • Hillary is marked with scandals and has been for 30 years • Hillary supports abortion • Hillary supports amnesty • Hillary is responsible for four dead Americans and is responsible for the Benghazi tragedy • Hillary is anti-second amendment –anti-gun • Hillary supports high taxes and spending • Hillary is evil. She is dishonest. She is corrupt. She is self-serving. She is disingenuous. She blatantly lies. She abuses her power and influence. Hillary is OBAMA. • Trump is an outsider • Trump is not a politician • Trump is a “huge” threat to those in power who want to keep the status quo • Trump is a fighter and a bold leader • Trump is a patriot who loves this country
8 | Charles R. Jones | 10154938877658812_10154938931833812 | Can we all just respect each other, we do not have to vote for the same person. this race has made a lot of so called good friends fight an not be friends any more. god loves us all no matter who we are voting for,. we do not have to agree , but we are all in this together weather you like it or not. i myself will be voting for mr. trump. just please get out an vote. do not wast your vote by not voting. god bless us all.
9 | Rhonda Worley-parsley | 10154938877658812_10154938899758812 | I am a Hillary supporter and I would LOVE to see this big of a spread; however, I really don't think it is that much. I think this will be a much, much closer race. I hope every Hillary supporter will get out and VOTE.
10 | Elias Ndayisaba | 10154938877658812_10154938900278812 | Yes Abc News clearly identified as lucifer supporters that why you support evildoers like clinton from first day upto day while decompaigning trump for now your days are numbered .team God Fearing In Fighting Satanic Works.
11 | Rebekah Smith | 10154938877658812_10154938957558812 | If Trump were leading, would there be so many cries of media bias and rigged elections? Hmm. It's weird how that works. One way or another, one candidate is going to lead in numbers, and eventually win. Telling people which one it is doesn't equal bias or cheating. Trump has repeatedly, almost daily, said something divisive and offensive, yet it must be BS and unfair when his actions have consequences. Mkay.
12 | Robert Moltzan | 10154938877658812_10154938965418812 | i don't think so, wasnt going to vote but between wiki leaks and the media you've made up my mind. the choice is clear evil or the devil her self add in to that the video of Robert Kramer admitting to sending people to disrupt trump rallies being paid and admitting that Hillary told him to do it? really disgusting and if the rest of the country really paid attention Bernie would be the nominee... she should be in prison.
13 | Daniel Salazar | 10154938877658812_10154938889698812 | ABC, you can't rig the election, even though you're trying your best. Only 27% of those polled were Republicans. Trump 2016!
14 | Mary Evans | 10154938877658812_10154939001493812 | Take a look at Trumps rallies and you can see who's winning..He has 10s of thousands at them.He broke a record in my state of penna..Kane had a rally the other day and he only had 30 people..Hillary can't even fill a stadium..Everyone has seen how corrupt her and the government is and that's why Trump is winning cause people want change..I feel sorry for the people that can't or don't want to admit the truth
15 | Justin Fraioli | 10154938877658812_1605559156414117 | Methodology for this poll, 350 dems to 280 repub/ women 565 to men 435/ age bracket 65+/ YES THIS POLL IS RIGGED/ CHECK THE METHODOLOGY/ this is exactly the game they played in BREXIT.
16 | Brock Delay | 10154938877658812_10154938931978812 | You have to read the fine print on these polls! MethodologyThis ABC News poll was conducted by landline and cellular telephone Oct. 20-23, 2016, in English and Spanish, among a random national sample of 1,155 likely voters. Results have a margin of sampling error of 3 points, including the design effect. Partisan divisions are 36-27-31 percent, Democrats-Republicans-independents.
17 | Dale Barlow | 10154938877658812_10154938969878812 | Watching the walking dead the other night reminded me of this year's election run. Rick (Trump) is on the bus and walkers (Hilliary, Obama, ABC, NBC, CBS, MSNBC) are surrounding him trying to hush the change the USA desperately needs
18 | Glen Harnish | 10154938877658812_10154938954138812 | What ABC means, is they go around at lunch time and ask their employees. Unfortunately for the 38%, they are now on a paid suspension until they complete some more conditioning classes
19 | Jimmy Palazzo | 10154938877658812_10154938900548812 | We work and pay taxes to just fill the pockets of lazy people that just wanna live off the country and not even attempt to get a job and do something with thier lives. And we'll just be also funding the Refugees brought over here before the American citizens who really need it
20 | GaryandJoline Borkowski | 10154938877658812_10154938953853812 | What's depressing  me out about this election is that we honestly have a women. That is not qualified to be president. With all the information out there, with even witnesses and documents and she is able to run and we have a president standing by her who knows she is guilty and FBI that knows she is guilty...the DOJ knows she guilty. We have people coming forward and speaking out and we have a source called weki leaks that knows more than our president..and He Is sitting by and allowing it to happen..or should say take place and he does nothing but stand by her and say it's ok..So yes stressed out that we do not have a government that does not do  there job that our tax payers money pay for..instead our tax pay for this women to be above the law. As people that has done less than she has gets prosecuted...Yup just don't understand...
21 | Frank Dolski | 10154938877658812_10154939007208812 | If you believe the news and these polls, I have some great swampland in NJ to sell you of value. I have lost all faith in ABC and most news channels for trying to brainwash Americans in to their decision for public elections. This is absurd and we are not that stupid. I hope that their ratings tank and they lose sponsors as this is becoming almost criminal.
22 | Katrina Marie | 10154938877658812_10154938965053812 | I think this is All BS ....I hate that Women !!!I will never Vote for that lying POS!!! She can't keep her own house together! Both of them are White Trash her and her husband!!!! #Trump I'm going to Vote today after work.
23 | Vicki Tate | 10154938877658812_10154938950103812 | Dear Hillary Supporter, Did you miss the part where she lied to congress? You know that’s called perjury…. Did you miss hearing about her being fired from the Watergate staff for being dishonest and unethical?How about those 33,000 emails she deleted and then had the computer wiped clean by professionals? Did you miss that? How about deleting emails after she was subpoenaed to hand them over to the Fed? You realize that’s Obstruction of Justice, right? Oh, and how about getting the rapist of a teenage girl off on rape charges then laughing about it? Did you miss that too?How about when she lied to the American people about Benghazi? You realize that story about the video was a lie, and she knew it was a lie, right?Did you miss her lying to the American people about her emails? How about when she lied about being under sniper fire?Well, then there was those times she lied about lying to the American people. Miss those too?What about that ‘pay for play’ with the Clinton Cash Foundation? That’s kind of hard to miss, huh?Did you miss all those other scandals she was in? You know… TravelGate, FileGate, WhiteWater, Rose law Firm, Vince Foster… she has a long list of scandals, you know... Did you miss her belittling her husband's sexual harassment ( and rape ) accusers? Oh – but the Paula Jones case was settled for $850,000 and Bill was impeached… for lying…You know she was labeled "Extremely careless" about national security by the FBI, right? Have you caught her latest lies about not knowing what the (C) meant on the classified documents? Or, that she can’t remember any briefings on how to handle classified material? Did you know that during her interview with the FBI she said she couldn’t remember 39 times? Did you know that during the Star Investigation she used that same defense of ‘I don’t recall’ 56 times? Did you hear her say she will raise taxes on the middle class? Did you know she had to return stolen items from the White House the last time they left? Have you seen the movies and several documentaries made about her questionable ethics? Don’t you wonder why she made congress and others spend millions and millions of tax dollars having hearings and investigating her numerous times, finding that she lied, that would not have been spent if she would have simply told the truth in the first place ! Facts - all facts ! But you are going to vote for her because.... you don't like Donald Trump ? Now, That is insane !
24 | Sharon Whyne | 10154938877658812_1605557416414291 | What stresses me is that abc is such a biased so called news outlet.Reminds me of the propaganda that our enemies spewed over the radio at our men fighting the war.You can bet after the election abc won't be on the air and it will serve them right.Vote Donald Trump don't listen to the propaganda.
25 | Kim Poole Armstrong | 10154938877658812_644172049118165 | ABC why don't we just go ahead and inaugurate her today????????? I mean why even hold an election??? I, for one, am DONE with you ABC and your unethical and biased reporting on this election!!!

The rate is highest among men in Southern states, such as Arkansas, where 40% of cancer deaths were linked to cigarette smoking.

1 | Rick Brazeau | 10154938875408812_10154939183108812 | James China let you sir are are misogynist and racist, a pathetic excuse for an american.Canadians used to look up to Americans because of your patriotism and democratic beliefs.There was a time, not so long ago that we would comment on how all Americans would rally behind their president no matter what they believed personally.That was one of the things that made America so strong in the eyes of the world. This kind of comment is why the world laughs at you and why you are weak.
2 | Ryan Beers | 10154938875408812_10154939253633812 | Way I see it is I'm gonna die when the big man upstairs decides I do. Could be today tomorrow or many years from now. While we are making it illegal to smoke... Cars should be illegal because car accidents kill thousands evey year. Junk food too. Actually anything with sugar it causes diabetes and obesity. Out drinking too. It causes liver disease. Ill stop there but that list should go on and on. Just outlaw everything and everyone can sit home and eat grass and tree bark and they shouldn't ever have to worry about someone else dying
3 | Amy Williams | 10154938875408812_10154939277523812 | My mom died from Renal Cell Carcinoma which is directly linked to smoking. She had stopped years before she died and it made no difference. My father has had recurring bladder cancer as well, also directly attributed to smoking. There is no cancer on either side of my family aside from them. It's awful. Do not smoke.
4 | Debi Miller | 10154938875408812_10154939618573812 | My dad died from emphysema - his death certificate said he death was due to smoking.....so the truth? when the doctor found my dad's emphysema the first question he ask was which beach he grew up around - he didn't he grew up in the south where the land is sandy (good for cotton) - the doctor told him his lungs were full of sand and that whether or not he smoked would have made a difference on what he would die of other than an accident - so they just said his death was due to smoking....the hell with environmental factors because they are some more them pesty facts the government chooses to ignore.
5 | James Chinadle | 10154938875408812_10154938896278812 | Obamaladen is as pathetic as the piece of garbage he endorses. I wonder how he feels about Hillary calling Muslims "Sand N*ggers"? To Hillary Mexicans are "Taco Bowls". Then the "Deplorables" and "Basement Dwellers". And of course, black people are "Super Predators" Maybe that's why Trump's rallies are massive and hers are pathetic.
6 | John Byrnes | 10154938875408812_10154939465853812 | Truth is truth, in more highly educatedstates like Ma, Ct, NH and NY cigarettesmoking is way down precisely becauseof that education and sophistication. None of which or little of which can befound in places like Arkansas, Alabama,Mississippi and South Carolina. Interest-ingly enough, all Red states.
7 | Bill Christenson | 10154938875408812_10154939022623812 | I would say ban them then but people don't care we have something like 3000 unborn babies dying from abortion everyday in America. So Americans obviously don't care about our youngest citizens why should they care about dumbasses that want to kill themselves? They worry about the helmet laws for motorcycles but leaves unborn children get murdered. Pathetic

Iowa man donates about $700 to cover overdue lunch balances for 89 students at local elementary school. "I find it hard to believe that in this day and age there are kids that go hungry."
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Christine DuBois | 10154938812238812_10154938827053812 | I was one of those kids as a student! My mom died when I was three and my father when I was in the seventh grade. Instead of going to lunch I went to the library or the nurses office through much of high school!  It made me very determined to make sure my kids never had to go through that!
2 | Jackie Ramos-Vazquez | 10154938812238812_10154938837653812 | I think lunch should be free regardless of financial status. My God they're their to learn and they let them go hungry? Hell I would hate going to school. Just saying.
3 | Lindsay Lee | 10154938812238812_10154938822798812 | THIS IS RIDICULOUS!!! I live in Toledo and we have a horrible funding issue for our public schools BUT they give ALL kids FREE BREAKFAST AND LUNCH NO MATTER WHAT!!!! No reduced meals or overdue balances, FREE!!!! If we can do it here, with such LOW FUNDING, why can't everywhere else!!!! So sad, something needs to change ASAP!!!!
4 | Celia Diaz | 10154938812238812_10154938933663812 | Sheesh some of u need to get off your high horse. Anyone can go hungry at any moment. Money comes and goes. But can someone please explain to me how prisoners get 3 squares a day but our kids can still go hungry?!?
5 | Ricky Williams | 10154938812238812_10154938869853812 | My father was one of those kids. He made damn sure my family never came close to going hungry. To this day he's 80 yrs now, and has a complex about enough food in his home. He has two freezers and refrigerators on his farm.
6 | Lisa Gee | 10154938812238812_10154938818408812 | It angers me when I hear these kind of reports. I'd like to go visit their homes and their parents and see do they have tattoos, alcohol, cigarettes , do they do drugs are they a Democrat ?I hate to stereotype but there's a reason for stereotypes. The child neglect in this country is pathetic. Selfish, entitled self-absorbed people who think of nothing but themselves!
7 | Polly Williams | 10154938812238812_10154938872983812 | As a child with an immigrant single mother who offended did three jobs just to keep the lights on, there were many days I went without lunch. So I understand the struggle. God bless this man and others who step in and step up to help these children
8 | Pamela Marcenaro Negron | 10154938812238812_10154938819718812 | It is hard to believe with all the taxes that someone pays and that it goes back to the schools that they can't spare a miserable $700 to cover for this. Clearly, some of these children are dealing with distressed family situations..
9 | Christie Ware Bryan | 10154938812238812_10154938884253812 | Public school lunches and breakfasts are served through the Federal School Lunch Program. Parents can fill out forms at the beginning of the school year and based on their income, they can qualify for FREE or REDUCED prices for their children. Even if they don't qualify for free or reduced lunch and they eat at the school, a portion of every child's meal is paid for by the federal government. If students have overdue lunch bills, it is because their parents did not pay the remaining amount that was charged after the federal government paid its part.
10 | Polly Williams | 10154938812238812_10154938869168812 | The heart of this man is big and he along with countless selfless others are some of the reasons why this is the greatest country on the face of this earth. 🙏🏿
11 | Will Conner | 10154938812238812_10154938923023812 | Still don't understand, why a "PUBLIC" school. ran by the state. The students still has to pay for lunches. I know most states offer free lunches to lower income families.  But, come on.
12 | Virginia Bossett | 10154938812238812_10154938827743812 | And the Kicker is that what is left, usually goes down the garbage shoot. Milk is opened And poured out, if a student did not drink it.
13 | Tim Moriarty | 10154938812238812_10154938846198812 | Well, adults getting knocked up when they don't have the funds to support their child. People know a child isn't cheap before they get in bed. Obviously there are other scenarios such as a guardian losing their job, but lets be honest that isn't the majority
14 | Annalisa Castillo | 10154938812238812_10154939254243812 | People don't realize that children go hungry in this country all the time! It's a sad reality but organizations are too concerned with feeding other countries when we have a massive problem right here in our country 😔 Bless the person who helped those children fill their little bellies! I would do the same thing 😊
15 | Cheryl West Smith | 10154938812238812_10154939028703812 | The schools should be reaching out to parents who aren't paying. Obviously they are having financial difficulties. There are social workers at every school who could help with free lunch forms, or other resources. PTA's can help out where traditional help leaves off.
16 | Dan Borland | 10154938812238812_10154939410703812 | Without food for the brain it cannot learn, this is a shame and happens at the collegiate level too. Its no wonder we are falling behind at all levels but we sure can drop money for defense/offensive purposes.  So sad at so many levels.
17 | Emily Phillips | 10154938812238812_10154939329998812 | Years ago, my grandmother worked in a high school cafeteria and she always kept spare change and a few dollar bills in her apron for those kids who either didn't have money or not enough.  It broke her heart and frustrated her that those kids who had past due accounts or no money at all got a sandwich consisting of 2 pieces of bread and a slice of cheese, yet school employees got to eat free.  She would stand by and watch her supervisor and fellow cafeteria workers take home the leftovers and toss out what they didn't want.  I remember she confronted the supervisor and was told that it was school policy and that was that.  She retired shortly after.  For the record, she NEVER brought food home nor did she take her lunches at the school.  My grandfather always cooked her breakfast before she left and she always took her own lunch in.
18 | Joe N Becky Adams | 10154938812238812_10154939072993812 | It's sad that the United States has children going hungry, veterans going without and homeless and we are pouring millions of dollars in to other countries and bringing in more people. Let's take care of the people here in the United States first.
19 | Robert Fierling | 10154938812238812_10154939478238812 | Well done Mr. Fenton. You are absolutely right, children should not have to go hungry. It would be good for our school children if we took some of the money designated for support of illegals and used it to provide food for needy school children.
20 | Bonnie Fritz Robinson | 10154938812238812_10154939542748812 | Thank you Mr. Fenton for such an awesome gesture you are a very kind person. But its sad to say that we can support all these refugees coming to America but won't feed our own kids first. We pay enough property taxes no child should go hungry in school. Thank you again Mr. fenton because some schools won't feed children if there is an outstanding lunch bill.
21 | Nancy Hetz | 10154938812238812_10154939498323812 | Thanks to Mooshell, a lot of our students are going hungry from the sloppy lunches that she makes our schools serve, and they can't study on an empty stomach, another way of dumming down America, like the Obamas started out to do. Time to get our country back on the right track.
22 | Rhonda McKinney | 10154938812238812_10154939467228812 | My mother back in the day was very poor and this was before free and reduced lunches and one principal notices the tiny sandwhiches she and her sibilings would bring and he made it so they got hot school lunch, bless him and men like this gentlemen no kid should go hungry
23 | Eliath Mena | 10154938812238812_10154939536128812 | Also, that kind of  debt for kids is not mentally healthy so early in life. Like, really? Let's teach our children that it's a struggle to eat at school while you are learning what you need to know! Andddd, sometimes the lunches are crap! I remember well what these kids feel.
24 | Shannon Korsmeyer | 10154938812238812_10154939087843812 | That's awesome he did that. These schools are deliberately neglecting kids of nutrition that they need!! Obviously the parents don't have the money, so they might not have much to eat at home either! I'm glad my kids school at least gives them a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and fruit and milk when they get behind on lunch money.
25 | Chuck Willis | 10154938812238812_10154938965328812 | That' because we are paying people like trumps share of taxes ...that money still comes out of other taxpayers pockets and it his the lower income hard.tgats why it's important to care that the rich pay their fair share as well.

In the wake of recent discussions from the political campaigns about the conduct and language around sexual assault, a group of celebrity men are challenging the notion that "boys will be boys" in a series of public service announcements.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Deborah Plumb | 10154938713468812_10154938758528812 | I am a veteran. I served shoulder to shoulder with men; held my own and never asked for special gender consideration (except for pushups; women in the military get a break on pushups). After the military, I worked on seismology teams hauling heavy equipment just like the men; construction jobs. I always held my own. I enjoyed being treated like one of the guys; took pride in it. And in the work place, most women do. That is something a lot of men don't seem to understand. There is a standard of treatment that isn't just implied, it's the law.  It shouldn't be difficult to refrain from sexist rhetoric and keep your hands to yourself. Isn't it common sense? Treat every woman the way you would want every man to treat your daughter, and your mother.
2 | Johnny Washika Gachago | 10154938713468812_10154938731353812 | Men vs women, black vs white, thats all I see these days in the news and we cant cover one story on the Dakota Pipeline protest.
3 | Alan Young | 10154938713468812_10154938742603812 | But Trump is rich and famous. He thinks he is entitled to grope any women, especially those who are vulnerable and socially not his equal. And his supporters are endorsing that by supporting him 😁
4 | Nural Taylor | 10154938713468812_10154938779308812 | So she gets ice-t who used to be a pimp and wrote on article on why white women are Better than other races to be in a psa.. ehh. Not interested. He also said to slightly intimidate your spouse for power not exactly a role model
5 | Ryan Beers | 10154938713468812_10154938835878812 | It's funny because everyone ignores anything negative about Hillary but everyone jumps as soon as Trump does or says anything. Lol if that's not sexist I don't know what is. P.s. no I'm not defending Trump I'm simply stating a fact
6 | Loni Morrow Powe | 10154938713468812_10154938821313812 | Boys will be boys..but he's a 70 year old man for Christ sakes smh..and yea I know it happened when he was a young 60 smh give me a break he's a disgusting POS 💩
7 | Russell Friscia | 10154938713468812_10154938753433812 | I'm not sure that a rapper who has made his millions glorifying gang violence is qualified to pass judgment on Trump's statements about making passes at women.
8 | Kody Divon | 10154938713468812_10154939086343812 | I, on the behalf of all good men out there, would like to apologize. We do not consider this locker room talk, and we do not condone such phrases or actions. Many other men and I are just as disgusted as you at the comments made and some of the deplorable men in this thread. They do not represent us all nor do they represent our ideals.We believe in the uplifting of women and standing beside you when such things are said. I am disgusted at the fact that after such comments there are still individuals who would support him. Sexual assault or the idea of sexual assault is wrong in every form. It's a disgusting act and an act that the majority of us condone to fullest extent. I hope that more men will come forward and voice their opinions on the matter and how disgusted we are. We treat women with the same: honour, integrity, and respect that we would want our daughters or mothers to be treated with. I am sorry that you have had to felt the emotions that were instilled by this one man's comments. Just know, that we as good men, will not stand behind it.
9 | Peter Mccloud | 10154938713468812_10154938976013812 | Ice t needs to shut up.. dam hypocrite.. the man wrote songs about shooting people for no reason, songs about shooting cops and songs about mistreating women.. but then again the way the news says you can't say pu$$y like trump .. just shove cigars in them like clinton.. smh
10 | Deby McCurley | 10154938713468812_10154939263508812 | Ok first of all I lmao when I seen ice t in this picture. You have the man whom in the late 80s and early 90s was preaching about shooting cops and cop killers as your poster child?? WTF is wrong with you ppl!!!!
11 | Sarah Espada | 10154938713468812_10154938762768812 | However the original episode of Law and Order SVU has been changed to after election cause of it beening to reality to what is going on in the elections. Disappointed. This could have educate those that want to shame those that wait to speak out on those that have power. I have seen too many ppl disrespecting others on both sides about sexual assault that not educate about the subject. Sexual assault is not about age, looks, or what someone's mental state is however power of another person. This no longer about the elections when it comes about this, more about educating and giving those that didn't have a voice now have a voice against sexual assault.
12 | Rhonda Arbuckle Knox | 10154938713468812_10154939113413812 | So what 🇺🇸Trump🇺🇸 said over 20 yrs ago is deemed "unacceptable", but what "she/it" and all these foul mouthed rappers/Miley's/whoopies/ etc, have done/do for years/daily is "acceptable"? The division in our world is what is "unacceptable" and nobody to blame but ourselves!!! Stop pointing fingers... open your eyes, your hearts, and don't say you've never done anything that required you to be forgiven!!!! Pray, Think, Vote!!!!
13 | Sharon Klopp Franklin | 10154938713468812_10154939046158812 | I love it... we have years of music glorifying beating, raping, and degrading women  and no one from their peers speaks out.... but get Trump in the mix and all of a sudden it's a taboo thing.    Boys - how about you start mentoring the young men on the street who are killing each other and making babies left and right?
14 | Nicole Sutton | 10154938713468812_10154939388193812 | There will always be people that see bad in everything no matter what. How about pay attention to what the video is about instead of the people or person in it. Ice t made music but guess what it was just music but this video isn't about him. Its about standing up for people that need it and not standing up for rapists and giving them excuses for their low life actions.
15 | David S Romero | 10154938713468812_10154939005158812 | Ice T must have forgot about being part of the "pimps up, hoes down" documentary. And law and order basically give a road map for sexual assaults in their episodes.
16 | Sherri Davis Norwood | 10154938713468812_10154939239468812 | ABC trying everything they can to down TRUMP.... if you are a man and in lots of cases a woman and you or someone very close to you say they have NEVER said just 1 thing that Trump said you are a damn lie.  You people are so traumatized by what Trump said that it makes you go brain dead of what Hillary has actually done!
17 | Megan Johnnic | 10154938713468812_10154939191073812 | Lol you all are ridiculous. Clearly you didn't read the article or watch the videos. She's trying to stop the stigma of things that are said after an act of sexual assault happens.... And the videos show what men say as excuses. #ChangeTheCulture
18 | Karen Robinson Roberts | 10154938713468812_10154938812453812 | I hope some of these are by writers, directors and producers of movies, tv and other media. If it is no longer to be IRL, then it no longer needs to be in print or video... also... music.
19 | Deborah Plumb | 10154938713468812_10154938730943812 | In other words, Donald Trump, you're behavior is unexceptable. And your pathetic "locker room talk" excuse is not exceptable.
20 | Roger Villarreal Larry | 10154938713468812_10154939121708812 | And girls will be girls too because I've seen in many cases these female teachers having sex with young male students and only get a slap on the wrist. Women need to be held accountable and responsible for their crimes just as men are, don't make it out like men are dogs when you got women out there that are equally as bad if not even worse, it's time men grow some dam balls and stop letting females get away with breaking the laws. Double standard court system!!!

22 | Robert A. Sandoval | 10154938713468812_10154938777218812 | Implying that this is a cultural problem is kind of stupid I would say it's more of a handful of individuals but then again that can be argued.Also the boys will be boys argument the only thing I have heard that from was from left-leaning feminist and then again that's yet to actually be proven
23 | La Vanna Kay Taylor | 10154938713468812_10154938857638812 | 30 years ago it wasn't like it is today. Men have gotten better at not trash talking. Any woman that can tell the truth about the cat calls back in the old days knows it to be true. Call it what you want, locker talk , guy talk what ever.  You are judging him on what happened many years ago. I don't like him nor Hillary. But knowing her track record I will not vote for her. She is fake.

Donald J. Trump jumped on news that average premiums under Obamacare will jump sharply - by 25% in popular plans before taxpayer subsidies kick in.

3 | Todd Lamkey | 10154938343423812_10154938356473812 | My insurance is outrageous! I don't qualify for obama's care! Still get fined because the premiums are so high!!! Someone is high...not me!
4 | Cindi Curtin | 10154938343423812_10154938416343812 | Well , Mr Trump , it appears you haven't actually looked into the plans.. I have and they're ( monthly premium ) not bad compared to.. say....a huge medical bill.. There are a lot of self employed people out there , who have probably called their insurance brokers for a price on catastrophic medical ..This is a good plan ..Those who qualify get a reduced premium .. aside from that, it's affordable ..Look into it , before you make some off the hip comment... You have enough money to pay for your healthcare , so I'm pretty certain you don't really care much about how the plan works
5 | Mare Stev | 10154938343423812_10154938433443812 | Horny Trump and his losers;we pay tax to cover our health care. For the past two decades, how much tax has the stupid Donald Trump paid?? The guy selling oranges on the street has paid more tax than the pervert Trump.
6 | Shawn Gentry | 10154938343423812_10154938468838812 | Yeah my insurance premium going up thanks to the governor of Tennessee approving a hike on the premiums. If not for The marketplace my employer insurance would have been 500 dollars a month. No thank you. 271 month through the marketplace. Team Hillary all the way.
7 | Netty Rajkowski | 10154938343423812_10154938414818812 | My insurance went up $200 and we have had our insurance through work! Now we pay $700 a month! Smh i have to cancel life insurance just to pay for our health insurance! I hope she doesn't get in we are all doomed!
8 | Mike Mcpherson | 10154938343423812_10154938470863812 | It's bad but I would probably not be here without Obama care had health insurance all my life until about 10 yrs ago worked at places who did not offer insurance I didn't vote for him but he has enabled me and my wife to have insurance and for this I am very thankful I hope that the costs can be reduced somehow but no matter I will find the money for my premium
9 | Mya Brown | 10154938343423812_10154938463398812 | Donald Trump cares only about Donald Trump if he was the captain of a ship and it was going down he would be first one off that ship and then the other small  boats left behind, he will take that too for all his riches and gold. Donald Trump is selling American people, false hope he's no better than a used lying car  salesman..
10 | Todd Faugno | 10154938343423812_10154938375313812 | Government control of health care is a Saul Alinsky tactic applied by nobama to continue to control the people.  Between that and crippling the economy, It needs to be repealed.  We should not be penalized for not having insurance.  Never killary https://imprimis.hillsdale.edu/effects-of-the-affordable-care-act-on-economic-productivity/
11 | Michael Beckerman | 10154938343423812_10154938436708812 | Two things that will soon be coming to a very abrupt end: Obamacare and Trumps run for the White House. I'll be glad when they are both a distant memory.
12 | Bobby Zink | 10154938343423812_10154938507928812 | Obama has never controlled health care premiums. There will never be health care reform until the insurance companies lose control. Insurance companies never lose... #americamakeamericagreatagain
13 | Dee Green | 10154938343423812_10154938420293812 | So suddenly Donald Trump has never-before-revealed expertise in economics OR health care? You couldn't find anyone with credibility to say that, so why not the guy who's been proven to lie every 50 seconds?
14 | Kim Pham | 10154938343423812_10154938438718812 | Lol. She's lowering the premiums, not raising them. I swear if one truthful thing ever came out of Trump's mouth it would be a miracle. VOTE BLUE, PEOPLE! VOTE HILLARY!
15 | Diana Crandall | 10154938343423812_10154938498573812 | Don't be too quick, Trumpet. It's still the best and only option available for a while lot of people. We can pretty much guarantee 'your plan' won't be any more affordable with as many protections as Obamacare offers. It's still new, too, so it's bound to get better as time goes on.
16 | Laura Smith Ryan | 10154938343423812_10154938847868812 | Are you people really defending a 25% hike in premiums??? How about congress, senate and WhiteHouse take Obamacare and keep those premiums down!!! Nope didn't think so. Obama swore to the American people this would not happen! "Affordable Care Act"... What a joke!! Trump 2016
17 | Pamela Rice | 10154938343423812_10154938579003812 | If Obamacare is so wonderful, can you please tell me why, since the inception, has my disabled husband been switched to so many different drugs for his illnesses quite simply because the insurance company decided that they didn't want to pay for the medication that he had been on so long that was working? Now he is starting all over again! Sheeple please stop acting like this is nothing important! Veterans are dying waiting to be seen because of months of back ups! There has to be change!
18 | Allison Marder Mikes | 10154938343423812_10154939171273812 | Mr Trump ,what's your big plan ?How are you going to fix it ?You are so busy telling people about there rates going up ,And Hillary is going to make it more expensive and they are in a panic about the rising cost ,why don't you tell people exactly what you are going to do ,before you start ripping into Obama care .All you want to do is win this election ,it's a popularity contest for you ,you don't really care about the people and this country .I find it funny that you are concerned about the cost going up on insurance ,but it does not affect you ,because you could afford it ,and you don't even pay taxes .After this election ,you are going back to tour gaudy gold penthouse and your limo parked outside your fancy building and you will just move on bragging about your fantastic building and hotels .You can not relate to real people .
19 | Daniel Moore | 10154938343423812_10154938422958812 | Who ever the Americans vote for, make sure you go out a Vote, every Vote Matters, The Polls where wrong here in the UK when we had our EU Referendum, despite the poll we won. Stand up to the Establishment.
20 | Dave Dougherty | 10154938343423812_10154938355558812 | You don't have to support Trump to understand the ACA has been one massive failure. From top to bottom the law is as corrupt as they come.
21 | Melissa Manliguis-Paddock | 10154938343423812_10154939001223812 | What you trump supporters don't understand is that what Trump is proposing will cost you more! The insurance companies will charge what they want and cover what they want. So if you or your child has a pre-existing they will not cover you. In the end your medical bills will be higher then what Obama care costs. Hillary says she will overhaul what Obama has put out there and I believe her. Trump has no idea what he is doing to us! He doesn't even have a plan although he says it WILL be great really then what is it? What is your great plan oh orange one! ?
22 | Lisa Jackson | 10154938343423812_10154938872708812 | It is long past time for a single payer system..... The insurance middleman is not even necessary and just raises the costs of healthcare. They are doing this in other countries successfully!!!!
23 | Debra Schneider | 10154938343423812_1814266978829764 | My Obamacare is still a better deal than I got from my company, and I do not mind paying more to help all the people with no insurance. If you want to repeal it, you must explain what it will be replaced with. Just like all his other promises, Trump has zero interest in or knowledge how to do that, neither do his "advisors" to whom he does not listen anyhow. It is astonishing to me that this ignorant, lying, cheating, tax-dodging, racist, misogynist, egomaniacal snake-oil salesman has managed to find the most ignorant and desperate people to fall for his scams. Hitler in the 30s all over again.
24 | Dee Green | 10154938343423812_10154938432388812 | What America can't afford is a return to tens of millions of adults and children relying on the ER because they have no access to medical care, because it was too expensive. Our ERs were closing, remember? Increasing premiums can be dealt with by the woman who has advocated for a public option for years. This would significantly curtail costs, and give average citizens the health care benefits members of congress currently enjoy. Sad that every opportunity for discussion is turned into a war of words in favor of clicks, straight out of the gate.
25 | Jacob Dabkiewicz | 10154938343423812_10154938777683812 | Think about that headline, the premiums for tax payers is going up 25%. But according to ABC News it's OK, because taxpayers will be subsidising the increase.Rates going up, but it's OK because YOUR premium increase will be covered by YOUR income tax increase.

9 | Michael Milburn | 10154938322768812_10154938843518812 | Trump will win in a landslide. He has tens of thousands at EVERY rally hillary only has a couple of hundred.

10 | Ronald Desfosses | 10154938322768812_10154939128298812 | Who gives a damn about the headlight performance you moron. They are adjustable and should be checked at every inspection.
11 | Kiki Hemphill | 10154938322768812_10154938366658812 | Standards of vehicles need to be raised all around. Some minor car accidents can end up a total loss. With the amount of money that cars cost, the price of service, insurance, taxes, etc, we deserve for car companies to produce better vehicles.
12 | Joseph Colton | 10154938322768812_10154938357643812 | Heroin is pouring into this country from Mexico because it is so easy to do! Our kids, our family members, our friends, our neighbors, etc. our dying every day because of this! Every one who reads this probably has someone in their family who is addicted to heroin! Trump brought this up at the debate, Hillary ignored it. Obama has also ignored this over the last 8 years and allowed it to become a epidemic! Heroin is in almost every high-school in this country, and in a lot of middle-schools! Think about your kids and everyone when you go to vote!

Hillary Clinton and other high-profile Democrats are sharing the spotlight with some of those vying for other seats that are up for grabs, and while Donald J. Trump has tried to make recent calls for support for other Republicans, his earlier comments may make his efforts seem half-hearted.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Steven Thorn | 10154938263058812_10154938313433812 | ABC news doesn't care about honesty. All they care about is getting Hillary elected. USA News media is propaganda wing of the DNC.
2 | Alan Young | 10154938263058812_10154938321363812 | Trump will only lead America to disaster. He is incompetent to lead the country and a real and present danger to all women except those who love being groped by rich strangers 😃
3 | Cesar Alvarez | 10154938263058812_10154938313893812 | Killary Rotten Clinton will be the end to the Middle Class. You seriously think she is going to raise taxes on the rich that have given her millions of dollars for her campaign?? She wants Open Borders, More Muslims with Benefits and Free College, guess where the money is coming from??? That's right the Middle class. The Middle Class will be gone and the poor will be even more more
4 | Robert Reeder | 10154938263058812_10154938646813812 | Since the republican party hates Trump and refuses to spend any money supporting him(even though he has raised millions for the party), I am not surprised he isn't too enthused about other republican races.
5 | Biniyami Chatman-Featherston | 10154938263058812_10154938406153812 | President Clinton seems it's going to be yet another reality.If Trump wins, I would feel he got lucky. We'll see.  Early voting has started. Get out there and vote.
6 | Mike Griffin | 10154938263058812_10154938827428812 | ABC is totally corrupt! Ignoring all the WikiLeaks documents and James O'Keefe Video's to protect Hillary Clinton is Criminal. Because they also show you have paid links to the Clinton campaign. Pure 3rd World Propaganda. How did this happen in America.
7 | Samson Rajkumar | 10154938263058812_10154938331818812 | American election system has be rigged since 2008. Every election system is corrupted and there is no more honesty and integrity in American Government. It's time to clean, vote for Trump.
8 | Elizabeth Racca | 10154938263058812_10154939285463812 | so your saying that it's ok to put a rapist back in the White House . How stupid can you people be wake up if Hillary becomes President we are all screwed can't y'all see it we losses everything we are going to be just like the other country's . She will take our freedom away. And she wants open borders god help us ! I have daughters and grand babies and I would never allow them to be hurt I will die for them . So you people really need to think about your loved ones if Hillary becomes president god help us all.
9 | Kelsey Umstead | 10154938263058812_10154938854458812 | Look three corrupt people. Hey abc, tell us how they made their millions, on public servent salaries? That would be journalism you know the stuff you used to do before you went into bed for the Clinton campaign
10 | Gary Doan | 10154938263058812_10154938299128812 | We have a Presidential candidate running from prosecution for her crimes and running for President at the same time, that's a first. The media is doing a bang up job, covering up for Clinton and attacking the opposition. The media and the Democrats they support are totally corrupt.
11 | Veronica Hutchinson | 10154938263058812_10154938326373812 | Can you guys maybe do some coverage of the thousands of peaceful water protectors at Standing Rock North Dakota and the fact that the Governor has huge financial interest in the oil industry and is on the regulatory board that allowed the Pipelines and Oil Industry so much freedom ?
12 | GaryandJoline Borkowski | 10154938263058812_10154939098593812 | I would vote a Democrat if they stood against Hilliary and what she has done and created..she is wrong for our Country her intentions are not for the people..she about her self and her legacy. People that don't speak out is more or less saying they are ok with how the government is run..I can respectfully respect some one if guilty but sincerely  apologise for there actions and wants to turn things around..but Hilliary she just acting likes it will all just go away it's a normal way of life  for her..Have to wonder if that the  way of any politicians...
13 | Gina Harvey | 10154938263058812_10154939153628812 | She will win cuz she payed people off this woman's guilty as hell in to much I don't like either one but she Is a killer it will come out
14 | Jess Garcia | 10154938263058812_10154938301253812 | Amarillo Texas, San Antonio and The state of Illinois are having residents post about their Voter Fraud, currently being shared on FB.
15 | Markandtoni Coetzee | 10154938263058812_10154938590383812 | Markandtoni Coetzee The gang that raped 9women.. Yes all rapist including Bill Clinton should be hanged for killing a women's will to live !!! Yep!! Very sad that so many Americans got there eyes shut.... Hillary Try taking responsibility for your actions  including covering up Bill rape victims, lying to the FBI, lying to the American people, letting 4 Americans die in Benghazi, selling out the state department for profit and the list goes on and on! .. But very quick to point fingers where your crimes are the worst in the world!!!! And your media is wrapping everything up as they got paid by the Clinton foundation. Wake up smell the coffee you are being fooled. I am South African and get all the news and media that gets held from Americans
16 | Dawn Larson | 10154938263058812_10154938596103812 | Considering the revelations of corruption and potentially criminal activity .. why aren't the Democrat candidates for the Senate and House being asked by the media if they condone this and if they still support Clinton? They are running down ballot from this woman .. they should be asked, just as republican candidates are asked about Trump.
17 | Christian James | 10154938263058812_10154938305993812 | People of ABC News must really love Hillary ! Trump is right about the crooked news media .
18 | Prince Phillips | 10154938263058812_10154938347523812 | Man, I give it to Trump he has beat his message into some folks heads they really good they repeat his every conspiracy verbatim.
19 | Pepi Kusiak | 10154938263058812_10154938989138812 | This comment stream is hilarious!!There's mostly Trump supporters a few uninformed actual Hillary supporting humans and a large handful of paid Hillary trolls. 😁
20 | Stephen Lewis | 10154938263058812_10154939393413812 | Thanks to Wikileaks we now know that at least 65 mainstream reporters were working closely with the Clinton campaign this election year. They were invited to top elitist dinners with Hillary Campaign Chairman John Podesta or Chief Campaign strategist Joel Benenson.
21 | Michelle BC | 10154938263058812_10154938337153812 | Michelle BC Trump 43% Hillary 41%We are winning and the press is refusing to report it. Don't let them fool you- get out and vote! #DrainTheSwamp on November 8th!
22 | Veronica Henrick | 10154938263058812_10154939404258812 | Hillary Clinton (part2):But she wanted President Obamas to become a judge from Supreme High Court unless he is retirement. He told her no.But she is NOT a Christian, she is NOT her faith, and she is NOT believed in God. She chooses her own way; her own thinking, her own understanding, her own world, and her own depend on her feeling (gut) WITHOUT heart. If she does, she WILL struggle herself just like President Obama who had a failure and broken promised himself. Just saying.Matthew 3:2John said, "Change your hearts and lives because the kingdom of heaven is near."P.S. Hillary but even worse. She made a deal to sell uranium (or approved a deal) to Russia, I think. Since then the companies and countries have been giving the Clintons a lot of money. Before the deal, Bill Clinton made $100,000 for each speech. After that, they gave him $500,000 every time and many more speeches. So they are being paid. Obama may still play a role, in the end, times. Since the US is not in Revelations (or many other nations) it means we will not be involved in Armageddon. Since we are so powerful we would be involved but if Obama and Hillary make us so weak that another nation captures us or destroys us then it is like in the Bible, we won't exist.Don’t you know that 12 states who are suing the Obama Administration over the transgender policy that they are trying to force down the throats of the American people! Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said last week that he’s going to encourage every public school superintendent in his state to IGNORE the Obama policy requiring schools to allow students to use bathrooms and locker rooms of the gender they identify with rather than their biological sex—good for him! That’s some backbone. We need more politicians and leaders like these who will take a stand against the dangerous riptide of political correctness in this country. We can all do something—contact your representatives and school superintendents and let them know that you expect them to protect your family’s privacy and stand against policies like this that allow sexual predators inside women’s and girls’ locker rooms and bathrooms! Hillary Clinton is one of them who supported Obama. Big disappointment in them. Pray them.NOTE:Hillary Clinton didn’t show up and supported for Louisiana people aftermath flooding. So President Obama didn’t show up there for several days while he was on vacation and party really, seriously?Hillary Clinton took the money by wealthy people from International, not in the USA. Hillary Clinton’s message to coal country, “We’re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.”Hillary Clinton wanted the high taxes in the USA where she can be covered up to Syrians for housing, bills, foods, etc.Obama-Clinton Foreign Policy: 1. Dangerous nuclear deal with number one state sponsor of terrorism. 2. Paying Iran a secret $400 million ransom 3. Compromising the Security of the United States.Hillary Clinton’s husband Bill had 4 accusers by women in the past. Which one is worst raped by Bill Clinton or groped by Trump? Who’s care? That was more than 10 year between 25 years ago! Just like former ex-Miss Universal Pageant or whoever. Give me a break. “Distraction.” Stop obsession for God's sake!Personal issues should NOT be involved business political. Whoever by an evil spirit with the act to destroy without honor to God. I’m an absolutely sure that social media is controlled by the Clinton’s. So they can tell the people what to think. The Clintons, evidently, have access and control of the media.Hillary Clinton her husband Bill Clinton is saying President Obama is crazy because of Obamacare. I bet Hillary Clinton slapped his face behind the door!Hillary Clinton campaign bus dumps sewage on Georgia street (Lawrenceville, GA). Is that a good example to you?Hillary Clinton is the most dangerous person to killing unborn babies EVERYDAY from Parenthood Planning by CEO: Cecile Richards) for abortion what she said on the Third Presidencies Debate. Life and Death! Does God-honoring Hillary Clinton if she is okay for woman’s right to killing unborn babies, killing babies, or selling baby’s part is that your good example to tell your family, relatives, friends, or even children? If a man who raped me and get me a pregnant or got a pregnant, I will NOT abortion my unborn or kill the baby. I can keep my baby or give out to baby for an adoption who’s mother can’t have a baby.Hillary Clinton is the most dangerous person in the USA to killing the hundred people to throw you out into the Lake Fire of Hell lasting forever without honor to God by the soul who will be wailing, burning, screaming, teeth gnashing, and painful never stop lasting forever. Disgraceful. Why should celebrity or famous people ask the people or audience to vote for Hillary Clinton as a CRIMINAL and even her husband Bill Clinton as a RAPIST seriously, really? Do they appreciate them, uh?Galatians 6:7 (NLV)Do not be fooled. You cannot fool God. A man will get back whatever he plants!Matthew 25:41 (NLV)"Then the King will say to those on His left side,"Go away from Me! You are guilty! Go into the fire that lasts forever. It has been made ready for the devil and his angels.Matthew 25:46 (NLV)These will go to the place where they will be punished forever. But those right with God will have life that lasts forever.Revelation 20:15 (NLV)If anyone's name was not written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.1 Corinthians 6:9–10 (NLV): Do you not know that sinful men will have no place in the holy nation of God? Do not be fooled. A person who does sex sins, or who worships false gods, or who is not faithful in marriage, or men who act like women, or people who do sex sins with their own sex, will have no place in the holy nation of God. Also those who steal, or those who always want to get more of everything, or who get drunk, or who say bad things about others, or take things that are not theirs, will have no place in the holy nation of God.John 14:6 (NLV)Jesus said,"I am the Way and the Truth and the Life. No one can go to the Father except by Me.NOBODY ELSE CAN SAVE from the world but TRUST JESUS TODAY! Hillary Clinton, Elizabeth Warren, President Obama, First Lady Michelle Obama, John Kerry, and whoever will NOT save you at all but Jesus can and He will!!!!Tim Kaine (D-Virginia) is NOT honoring to God. So be it. Just pray for him no matter what. He has NO heart but fools himself, sadly. I disliked his rude, aggressive, angry, and his obsession repeating over, over, and over again on Vice Presidencies Debate, disgusting me.
23 | Eddie Deano Zeiler | 10154938263058812_10154938302103812 | I voted trump today and Abc still trying to slow down the trump train 🚂
24 | Ben Henderson | 10154938263058812_10154939255388812 | The slimy corrupt anti-American DNC and HRC that you support paid to have Americans attacked.. It wasn't right when African Americans were attacked for the color of their skin, it wasn't right when It happened to homosexuals and it's not right now! Those that support this are Anti-American... Those that attack Americans at political rallies and those that pay them are Domestic Terrorists and should be treated as such. We have room at GITMO.
25 | James Chinadle | 10154938263058812_10154938897853812 | Obamaladen is as pathetic as the piece of garbage he endorses. I wonder how he feels about Hillary calling Muslims "Sand N*ggers"? To Hillary Mexicans are "Taco Bowls". Then the "Deplorables" and "Basement Dwellers". And of course, black people are "Super Predators" Maybe that's why Trump's rallies are massive and hers are pathetic.

Mississippi NAACP president calls for federal hate crime investigation after parents of black high school student say white students put a noose around their son's neck at school.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Corey Alexander Walker | 10154938193523812_10154938234528812 | American "Patriots" on this: "Why is everyone so sensitive? It was just a joke. Get over it. American "Patriots" on Kaepernick: "He's disrespecting our country! I'm so offended!"
2 | Steven Velez | 10154938193523812_10154938205638812 | Conservatives & trump supporters don't see any problems with it. It's like they say, when they do circle jerking together. Boys will be boys.
3 | Sheila Nestor Burke | 10154938193523812_10154938304993812 | The sad thing is 4 black males in Alabama beat a white high school student. Fractured his skull and put in the hospital in critical condition. There has been very little coverage of that story and no mention of hate crime even though he could have easily died. What makes one story any better than the other?
4 | Kiki Hemphill | 10154938193523812_10154938218523812 | These perpetrators need to be punished with a hate crime. This is disgusting, and deplorable behavior! It's physical assault! I'm sure people will say they weren't raised like this.
5 | Lori J. Fuller | 10154938193523812_10154938252448812 | Doesnt matter if they did this as a joke or not, this is some really sick sh*t. I dont care if the parents of these kids are Teachers, Cops, or Judges, Lawyers or what ever, they should all be treated equally and given the same punishment. You keep letting this slide and its just going to keep happening.
6 | Theresa Woollard | 10154938193523812_10154938237193812 | This is not OK. Charging them as adults is not OK either bc they are not operating at an adult capacity. They should be charged criminally as juveniles and expelling them from school for assault will follow them around long enough to haunt them forever (like their victim will be haunted from the fear and humiliation that was inflicted). It will make their lives harder. College will not accept them very easily, if at all. The course of their lives will definitely be altered to say the least. The message needs to be sent that this won't be tolerated and it's disgusting behavior to put it mildly :( Praying for the victim and his family. This is a tough road to travel.
7 | Jann Oleannder | 10154938193523812_10154938500613812 | It's Mississippi, they still think like it's 1860, you cannot drag them out of the darkness of racism, it's inbred, generation after generation. This is a horrible act and is racist with the noose, like their granddaddy would have done , Jesus,  will they ever grow up?
8 | Lita Gutierrez | 10154938193523812_10154938248848812 | You stupid people that are deflecting by bringing up your same old argument about Hillary are encouraging these disgusting hateful criminal acts by young people. You really want your kids to do this sort of thing? Why not teach them about basic human decency? What a sick sick America we're becoming. Thanks trump!
9 | Shawna Carothers | 10154938193523812_10154938210103812 | What the hell does Trump have to do with this? This is just hateful individuals!
10 | Alexis Quick | 10154938193523812_10154938250813812 | Everyone saying this is trumps fault...really? You do realize kids were bullies to each other before him. There were bullies like that in my school and that was over 12 years ago. Its something that's always been going on. It's sad though.
11 | William Hull | 10154938193523812_10154938864918812 | Scary that teens are now following the empowered movement brought about by Trump's minions. He has given voice and validation to racism and hate for all things not white or male. But then again, it is Mississippi.
12 | Tammy Taggart | 10154938193523812_10154939219448812 | Lets clear this up real fast I'm a conservative... and I don't agree with what happened joke or not... It is wrong. It is dangerous. It is inhumane... Something could have went horribly wrong. If it was not a joke. The four boy's who did this needs jail and mental help.
13 | Jeff Cook | 10154938193523812_10154938508678812 | Unacceptable.It's not unreasonable to make an example of the offenders.This sort of thing must stop.It's not funny in the slightest.
14 | Rhonda Bryant | 10154938193523812_10154938937483812 | Anyone who thinks of this as a "joke" is clearly uneducated and without compassion for their fellow man. This is what Trump has created in America.
15 | Denise McNeal | 10154938193523812_10154938674798812 | I agree what kind of crap is this. It's not 1940 folks where people just didn't know better then the hate they were taught. Today our kids should be living together as one. This kind of nonsense needs to stop. Kids and parents need to be brought in!
16 | Daniela Wilkins | 10154938193523812_10154938568423812 | They should be charged with aggravated assault and a hate crime. Little POS. The Trump effect-that's what happens when people in the public eye get away with saying and doing whatever they want..To avoid ignorant comments--before you say anything, read this: https://www.splcenter.org/20160413/trump-effect-impact-presidential-campaign-our-nations-schools
17 | Angela Evans | 10154938193523812_10154938316503812 | Despicable any human with decency and civility would be horrified to hear about this happening to any child regardless of what party they are in. Seriously I pray that we can start focusing on what unites us versus what divides us! I hope the family of this young man gets the love and support he needs!
18 | Linda Jordan | 10154938193523812_10154939344728812 | Shawna Carothers...Trump embodies all that is divisive and hateful in this country. Hispanics are rapists.. blacks live in poor neighborhoods...women are sex objects...do you get it now? He espouses hate. Try and focus and make the connection. I know that it is difficult.

21 | Bryan McClellan | 10154938193523812_10154939150628812 | It's a sad day when anyone justify this kind of behavior. It wouldn't matter if the young black man was in on it, it's not okay behavior, and wasn't the case. Just throwing more fuel on the fire that media has spun out of control. I'm sure their parents are proud.

The only people to blame, are the ones that did the act, and the ones that taught them to act that way.
24 | Jeannine Robinson | 10154938193523812_10154939566473812 | It's trumps fault. Angry, racist white ppl who get all reeved up at his rallies and think they can go back to lynching. And the reason trump is even at the point where he has gotten is the  racist ppl that resented having a black president for the past 8 yrs and his black flotus in the white house
25 | Joanne Lynn | 10154938193523812_10154938355083812 | Awful. What is happening to the youth in this country?   Back in public high school when I went through, blacks and whites were friends. No one would even think about doing something like this. Smh

Authorities begin evicting immigrants from the cramped makeshift refugee camp dubbed the Jungle in the port city of Calais in northern France. The makeshift camp has become home to an estimated 8,000 refugees.

To Hillary Mexicans are "Taco Bowls". Then the "Deplorables" and "Basement Dwellers". And of course, black people are "Super Predators" Maybe that's why Trump's rallies are massive and hers are pathetic.

Spineless pigs...stop watching CNN for a solid week and see what happens. You don't need to watch to keep up to date on anything...you know what they are going to say....watch a non bias network or go online were they make little money....wake up and do something that matters.

"Obama will go down as perhaps the worst president in the history of the United States - @realDonaldTrump," Pres. Barack Obama said, quoting one of Donald J. Trump's tweets. "Well, @realDonaldTrump, at least I will go down as a president."

1 | Kenny Jackson | 10154938051948812_10154938055658812 | President Obama ! 55 percent Approval rating ! The TOP ever as a President this late in his Terms ! Awesome Job ! President Obama !

3 | Jim Merrick | 10154938051948812_10154938073873812 | Obama has been the best president of my lifetime! (I'm 49)The worst I would have to say was Reagan because of the long term effects we are still suffering with.
4 | Kevin Jennison | 10154938051948812_10154938058673812 | Yes, yes he will, sorry if the truth hurts your feelings, but Obama has been,( and is a has been) a failure for this country. YES WORST PRESIDENT IN HISTORY. and we have had a few bad ones.
5 | Anders Lifvenborg | 10154938051948812_10154938075628812 | This is such bull crap... based on what? He took us out of a recession the republicans put us in and he has a better approval rating than most presidents.
6 | Debra Davis | 10154938051948812_10154938067828812 | For someone that is the "worst" president in history... he was voted in to office not once, but twice. 😂
7 | Vittoria Shepp | 10154938051948812_10154938086063812 | I'm going to miss my President Obama I love him he so classy and the First lady you did a good job even when the Republicans try to pressure you still did a good job
8 | Eddie Elliott | 10154938051948812_10154938057143812 | It makes me sick ABC is paid off and they're praising the Obama and the clintons... Jimmy Kimmel sucks
9 | Eddie Deano Zeiler | 10154938051948812_10154938058663812 | Trump 2016C is for Clinton whose campaign is sliding. And C’s for the classified emails she’s hiding. C’s for concussion, a bump in December. And C is for can’t, as in “I can’t remember”. C is for closet where servers were hid. And C is for cough that’s affecting her bid. C is for cash as in “pay to play.” Don’t you ‘C’ she is lying in so many ways. HILLARY 4 PRISON!!!
10 | Regina Anderson | 10154938051948812_10154938087403812 | Imagine it is November 9, 2016 in America and we wake up knowing who our new President will be. If it is Hillary, think of the groups of people that will celebrate. Illegal Immigrants, criminals and future criminals who will be supported for pulling a gun on a police officer, planned parenthood, the media, and the list goes on and on that represent everything that is wrong with America. If you're still "with her," look around at who you'll be celebrating with. Now imagine waking up knowing that Trump is our new President. You may or may not like him, or really know what kind of president he will be. But here are some things you will know for sure:• The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.• The media has been neutered forever.• Career politicians will have lost all job security.• The guns in your home will safely stay there.• Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.• Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally• Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.• No more apologies to the world for being great!• Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.• Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.• There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.• The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.• The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.Copy and paste this as your status if you support and will vote Donald Trump for president 2016.
11 | Pride Liz | 10154938051948812_10154938153483812 | I just finished watching!  Say what u want but I believe 100% president Obama was/is a great president!  Every time he tried to do something great he was railroaded by the republican controlled house ....he is very charismatic and I adore Michelle!  Unfortunately, I also believe he is being judged by his skin color rather than the content of his character!!
12 | Kenneth Mueller | 10154938051948812_549635238572055 | If you remotely think President Obama is the worst president in history... you're either a terrible historian or have issues with someone being black in the Oval Office.
13 | Courtney Allen | 10154938051948812_10154938087533812 | Quite frankly, as someone who is still president of all of America's citizens he should remain unbiased while still in office. Speaking of bias,  this is a news channel and should stop being so disgustingly one sided.
14 | Alice Gonzales Nieto | 10154938051948812_10154938098098812 | No, Trump!! You will go down as worst presidential candidate in the history of the world!!! And, you will never be president!!!
15 | Teri Cardenas | 10154938051948812_10154938152333812 | Obama is 1 of the best Presidents ever!! I may not agree with Obama care to much but it works for a lot! The President and Mrs. O have a lot of Love and Respect for the Country!! "Trump's just mad because He already know's ..He'll never wear the Shoes for President!!
16 | Linda Nava | 10154938051948812_10154938092618812 | Don't give Trump any cred, you have been a wonderful President and will be remembered as such. You had more crap to clean up than any of the others. You had obstacles placed in your way that no other had. I commend you and am proud to be an American. I am proud of the first African American President and the First Woman President in my lifetime. We HAVE come a long way and I don't want Trump to set us back a hundred years. God Bless the United States of America 🙏🏼🇺🇸❤️🙏🏼🇺🇸❤️
17 | Dee Miller | 10154938051948812_10154938119363812 | Read the facts or believe the lies Trump is feeding you Americans:"Barack Obama is among the greatest presidents any of us can hope for in a lifetime. Anyone who has lived in America—or the world, for that matter—while he has been in office is an extremely fortunate person indeed. And, as much as the GOP keeps trying to tarnish his reputation, the world knows that he is an incredible president that we can be proud of.He’s even made moves against police violence. But most recently, Obama broke a record for US presidents. He has achieved a record-setting 78 months of job growth. Since 2010, businesses have added more than 15.1 million jobs. That’s longer than any president ever has before.Jason Furman, the Chairman of the Council Economic Advisers, said  “So far in 2016, job growth has averaged a solid 182,000 jobs a month, well above the pace of about 80,000 jobs a month needed to maintain a low and stable unemployment rate, and hourly earnings for private-sector workers have increased at an annual rate of 2.8 percent, much faster than the pace of inflation.” That’ll show those Republicans who insist that Obama is tanking the economy! Although maybe it won’t…they never do seem convinced by facts."
18 | Cory Dauphinee | 10154938051948812_10154938081703812 | Obama is a BIG hypocrite....back in 08 he said that Hillary can't be trusted and she is the worst thing that can happen to the country and so on, now he says he trusts her and all Americans should as well and she's the best thing that can to the country...lmao...
19 | Lissa Smith | 10154938051948812_10154938096263812 | Gotta luv POTUS. Class with dignity, very responsible, humbleness, humor, wisdom, and coolness. In my opinion he is the best prez ever....
20 | Karen Royce Gerrity | 10154938051948812_10154938145613812 | Trump will go down as the biggest loser human being ever allowed to run for president!  Speaks volumes about the Republican Party or should I say what was once the Republican Party!
21 | Linda Rush | 10154938051948812_10154938056508812 | Obamma is the worst president. And I can wait till Mr Trump is president. Because folks, that is going to happen.
22 | Dee Miller | 10154938051948812_10154938107583812 | The reason why so many of you Americans hate Obama and have climbed aboard #TheTrumpTrainToHellThe main reason why Trump gained such popularity is because he's exactly the type of presidential candidate Americans have grown up with. Paternalistic, authoritarian, warmongering, imperalistic, racist, sexist and anti-immigrants, to name just a few. With someone like him in the White House, the majority of Americans feel that they can just sit back and let him run things. They don't have to think nor decide for themselves.  That's why many of them hate Obama because he forced Americans to see what was unacceptable about American society and what needed to be changed. 😐
23 | Bret Brock | 10154938051948812_1251674728187073 | I don't see how Obama has been that great?from the news I get here in Oklahoma! playing golf & help creating a race war?Creating a forced healthcare? that will eventually lead to all Americans being forced to get an RFID chip implanted in them! Which is as stated in the book of revelations the mark of the beast! grab your Bible's people! I believe we're screwed either way. Russia is already threatening war with us. Which will lead to World War III.
24 | Houston Wells | 10154938051948812_549631948572384 | Obama is terrified of Trump. Obama's constant behavior towards Trump is proof of that. Obama practices voter suppression, and tax abuse every time he uses our money to campaign for Hillary. Obama has shown poor judgement and a lack of maturity
25 | Valerie Spielman | 10154938051948812_549657091903203 | President Obama has been an awesome president. I will miss the whole family and I would vote for him again if I could. Donald Trump is just a joke. What a despicable human being. Such a whiny little kid.

Increasing use of early voting and largely increasing overall turnout in the past several general elections may contribute to a record number of people voting, according to an ABC News political analyst.

1 | Stephanie Easley | 10154938009853812_10154938018273812 | Trump supporters seem motivated. They weren't holding back today at our local precinct. Local pastors and all. They're fed up with Washington corruption.

3 | Adam Racine | 10154938009853812_10154938057733812 | HA!......The only excitement generated is by Trump, Not Clinton. He will win and shock the media once again. Although they wont be that shocked since they secretly want him to win simply for the ratings.
4 | Daniel Bambrick | 10154938009853812_10154938121263812 | ABC does this every time voting starts. Its just paid advertising to "encourage" people go and vote. ABC News sold out a long time ago

10 | Ben Henderson | 10154938009853812_10154938017798812 | The slimy corrupt anti-American DNC and HRC that you support paid to have Americans attacked.. It wasn't right when African Americans were attacked for the color of their skin, it wasn't right when It happened to homosexuals and it's not right now! Those that support this are Anti-American... Those that attack Americans at political rallies and those that pay them are Domestic Terrorists and should be treated as such. We have room at GITMO.

In less than two weeks, (14 Days) (some casting votes now in early voting states)We face a grave impact on our socieity, No matter who wins this presant election. Please, every christian, needs to pray that God's will should be done. With so much turmoil, and confusion. We are currently facing, on either side of the isle.Whether of the two candidates, should it be Donald Trump, or Hillary Clinton, Neither one can fix whats wrong with America. Only God can do this.Again, whom ever considers themself to be a christian, please, pray, also keep me in your prayers, as will I keep you in mine.God Bless
13 | Vicki Tate | 10154938009853812_10154939293988812 | What about.......Those Damn E-MailsHillary Clinton’s conduct in setting up a private e-mail server which transmitted top secret information and the FBI declining to recommend criminal charges demonstrates that she is above the law. Worse, Hillary acts like there is one law for her and her family and one law for everyone else. Oh, she takes “full responsibility” for her e-mails while saying other Secretaries of State have done the same. So when Hillary takes full responsibility for something, she is really taking no responsibility at all. This is a very dangerous quality for someone who seeks the office of President of the United States to possess.BenghaziAny government official who feels the need to ask, “At this point what does difference does it make?” where it concerns the deaths of four Americans including our Ambassador to Libya is unfit to be President of the United States. Mind you she asked this question after publicly blaming an internet video for the attack on the consulate, an attack that just happened to occur on the 11th anniversary of the September 11th attacks. Of course, her e-mail correspondence with daughter Chelsea on the attack indicated it was carried out by an “al Qaeda like group.” Again, Hillary takes full responsibility, but as she told Scott Pelley on 60 Minutes, “It was not my ball to carry.” We’ve come a long way from “The Buck stops here” to “It was not my ball to carry.” In this case, a long way isn’t a good way.The Clinton FoundationIs Donald Trump correct to say that Hillary Clinton turned the State Department into her family’s personal hedge fund by using the Clinton Foundation to sell access to foreign governments, many of which have dubious human rights records? Well, Trump ought to know. He helped fund the Clinton Foundation. At the very minimum, there is the appearance of impropriety. At worst, there’s enough corruption to put the UN to shame.Russian ResetHillary Clinton has got Russia wrong from the moment she gave Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov a red button that was supposed to say reset in Russian. But instead of saying ‘perezagruzka’ it read ‘peregruzka,’ which means overcharged. It is nevertheless somehow fitting. Hillary may be the only person who actually believes the Russian reset worked. She claimed this because it brought the Russians around on sanctions against Iran. Well, where are those sanctions now? Also the people of Ukraine and Crimea might disagree with that assessment. Oh, things have been reset all right when a 3-Star Russian general can walk into the U.S. Embassy in Iraq and tell our military to get the hell of the sky.

Because they also show you have paid links to the Clinton campaign. Pure 3rd World Propaganda. How did this happen in America.

16 | Michael Barrett | 10154938009853812_10154938123383812 | Conservatives Have Groomed the Perfect Suckers for Trump’s Epic ScamIn 2000, Donald Trump boldly told Fortunemagazine, “It’s very possible that I could be the first presidential candidate to run and make money on it.” Sixteen years later, he’s structured an entire presidential campaign around making good on that boast.  Trump is turning out to be a disaster for the Republican Party, the real estate magnate is pretty much guaranteed to come out richer. That was the plan all along. And conservative voters, conditioned by decades of right-wing politicians and media exploiting and enhancing their gullibility, make the perfect victims for his ruse. https: newrepublic com/article/134667/conservatives-groomed-perfect-suckers-trumps-epic-scam

DOG LOVES DESSERT: They say every dog has its day. For Rambo, a 2 ½-year-old English bulldog from Alabama, that's any day the ice cream man drives up. "He's like, 'Give me my ice cream, my dad will pay you.'" http://abcn.ws/2epL6lI

1 | Judy Green | 10154937965533812_10154938001613812 | When I was a kid we had a huge Great Dane who loved ice creams.  He used to go into the local milk bar, stand with his front legs on the counter and droooooolll until the owner gave him an ice cream.  Mum eventually had to open an ice cream account for the dog!!
2 | Gloria B. Jenkins | 10154937965533812_10154938247008812 | We had a German Shepherd that my dad would occasionally buy a pint of vanilla ice cream for.  He'd cut the pint in half and the dog would scarf it up!
3 | Alicia Davisson Damore | 10154937965533812_10154938262523812 | I had a mutt, named Mutley accordingly, who my grandmother would have to buy his own ice cream cone when the truck came down the street. What a great memory. This was 40 years ago! And the reason my grandmother started buying him his OWN cone was because she saw me sharing mine with him one day!!! Lol.
4 | Lisa Davis | 10154937965533812_10154938182393812 | lol when I was at the beach last month, an ice cream truck came around twice during the week. Someone in the house next to the one we were renting had a big dog who would run out to the truck and sit there waiting for the person driving it to toss him a treat just like this!
5 | Connie Kendrick | 10154937965533812_10154938251278812 | When I was a little ,girl in the late fifties, my grandmother had a Toy Manchester dog who went to the door when she heard the ice cream truck coming  :) I spent part of summers with her.
6 | Daniel Sweeney III | 10154937965533812_10154938093518812 | I had a Siberian huskie that was first in line every time the ice cream truck stopped on my street. He always got his too, lol!
