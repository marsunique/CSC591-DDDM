1 | Linda Dedrick | 1331645006931748_1331649730264609 | Don't care what poll's say we must VOTE BIG AND BLUE and make sure that racist sexist worthless pig is Never elected president NEVER EVER TRUMP.
2 | Mamiejane G Burdick | 1331645006931748_1331654923597423 | When I heAr Trump I know my dear daddy would love to be alive to join Vice President .Biden and take Ol Trump out behind the barn for a lesson, My dear wonderful decent daddy would be appalled at what comes out of Trumps mouth, I know women are disgusted but how in the world can men condone Donald Trumps nasty evil behavior, My husband voted for Hillary in early voting, He respects all women and Trump does not not do his followers,
3 | Gary Doan | 1331645006931748_1331645163598399 | I have given Democrats far too much credit in the past. Everyone should realize the press is biased, but most Democrats deny it. I had assumed that some people were either naive or brainwashed, but now I'm starting to believe they appreciate and support our biased corrupt media. There no way bias is not noticeable at this point in time and I'm an deeply ashamed of all Democrats. - An Ex-Democrat.
4 | Larry Katz | 1331645006931748_1331647963598119 | Destroy Trump's brand.Boycott all Trump products, including all of his family's goods.Boycott Trump clothes, ties, wines, books, hotels, golf courses.....Throw out anything you already own with a Trump label.Throw it into the streets!Send him the only message he'll understand! No money for the Trumps!#GrabYourWallet
5 | Johnathan Shaw | 1331645006931748_1331652070264375 | Hillary Clinton 2016! Conservatives is just what it means ,No growth , No infrastructure,  No Living wages!! Even Donald Hitler Trump Sr has said that the Democrats have a better record for all to get ahead. I guess that is how he made his fortune under Democratic rule of Law!
6 | Greg Clark | 1331645006931748_1331647900264792 | I would never vote for somebody who sat on the board of directors for Wal-Mart...one of biggest or biggest Anti-Union company in the world...Trump 2016
7 | Smith Sean | 1331645006931748_1331654853597430 | Hillary couldn't beat an 74 yr old socialist dude fair & square hell she can even out shine trump who many say is the worst candidate to ever run for president. she's terrible folks. only 5 pt lead?
8 | Dolores Liebner Dicicco | 1331645006931748_1331657280263854 | Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe’s political action committee donated nearly $500,000 to the election campaign of Dr. Jill McCabe--the wife of an FBI official who helped oversee the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server while secretary of state, the Wall Street Journal first reported.And the Virginia Democratic Party, a group over which the governor has considerable influence, contributed an additional $207,778 in the form of mailers, the campaign finance records indicate. The WSJ noted that this put donations from entities directly under McAuliffe or influenced by him at nearly $700,000, which was about a third of McCabe’s total campaign fundraising efforts. McAuliffe also reportedly recruited McCabe for the race.
9 | David Procter | 1331645006931748_1331654063597509 | Let me see. It was Clinton winning by eleven points over the weekend, but Trump complained about the polls, so now it's a five point lead. Don't ever try to convince me about the honesty and reliability of polling. It is but a refection of the corruption in politics.
10 | Linda Janowski | 1331645006931748_1331657046930544 | I heard the DNC got hacked two days ago.. Trump is ahead by 19 %  Nationwide.. The dems are in a panic. They believe by giving false poll numbers they are using this as a psychological weapon.. (stupid)  They even said a hurricane would not stop Trump supporters, going out to the polls. They even thought about having a shooting take place in certain areas just to keep the voters home. How Fxxx low can they go..
11 | Melissa Mastrianni | 1331645006931748_1331651993597716 | You don't have to let the machine switch your vote! Be alert and if you see it, call someone over right then and there to have it switched back! The machine can be recalibrated!You can do this! Voters have been experiencing this w/early voting! DON'T JUST WALK AWAY! It can be fixed! FIGHT!http://usgovinfo.about.com/od/thepoliticalsystem/a/votingmistakes.htm
12 | John Charles Belz | 1331645006931748_1331651446931104 | Four years ago Romney was told all the polls were biased.   He should only believe the Fox poll which had him winning.   The results showed all the polls were correct except the biased Fox poll.
13 | Barbara Wright | 1331645006931748_1331652030264379 | What I don't get is the same ones calling Hillary is a murderer while having murder & hate in their own hearts by obsessing about the Second Amendment; the right of the people to keep and bear arms. Isn't the purpose of bearing arms are to commit murder but use the Second Amendment to get away with murder? It doesn't make sense to me. 🤔
14 | Terry Woody | 1331645006931748_1331652586930990 | For people who were thinking about voting for a third-party candidate, especially millennials, here is an excellent commentary on why you need to vote for Clinton.http://video.gq.com/watch/the-closer-with-keith-olbermann-this-election-is-too-important-to-dare-not-vote-for-hillary-clinton?c=series
15 | Michael Barrett | 1331645006931748_1331653753597540 | Donald Trump's the Biggest 2016 Loser – But Not the Only One  | US News The Republican presidential candidate has dragged the GOP, the media and the nation down with himOf course, the biggest losers in this campaign are the American people and the political process. We have been cheated at a critical and complicated time. Trump's talk about a rigged system and looming voter fraud, along with his assertions that every policy is a disaster, that everyone in Washington is incompetent, and that his opponent belongs in jail undermine confidence in the pillars of our democracy itself.Well, the circus is over. It lost its magic long ago. Even the clowns are crying now. http://www usnews com/opinion/articles/2016-10-24/donald-trumps-the-biggest-2016-loser-but-not-the-only-one
16 | Bill Saks | 1331645006931748_1331653166930932 | This is the worst thing ever not a single candidate getting fifty percent . It means the president will not have controlling legal authority . And if the polls are correct we have a criminal not legally qualified to be president
17 | Where there is love there is life | 1331645006931748_1331654283597487 | Don't define her by the way she looks or the clothes she wears. Her beauty is far greater than     what meets the eye. Look at her heart and the river of love that flows from within her. Adore her for being the goddess she is. Fall in love with her soul and she will guide you to understand the sacred ways of your heart.
18 | Carmen Veliz | 1331645006931748_1331655986930650 | Yeah MSNBC poll like I will believe that. NBC proven to have colluded with Clinton Campaign, so of course they will be honest.  LOL!
19 | A.J. Pinto | 1331645006931748_1331645716931677 | Remember: electing Hillary sends a message to our children that lying, cheating, and committing crimes are ok as long as you win. We need role models to lead by teaching what is appropriate. She sullies feminism and women worldwide. Women should never be portrayed as too weak to win fairly. Ever. That is neither feminist, progressive, nor "liberal". But that is the democratic party now... self-inflicting misogynists, solidifying female inferiority. She "didn't know" what is classified, is utterly clueless, projecting female stupidity; that females are unfit to lead. She's not worth selling out your family, your kids, or yourself for. We thought It couldn't possibly get worse, but it did. It got a lot worse with the latest leaked emails.
20 | Gregory Alan Hubbard | 1331645006931748_1331650300264552 | Got to love false hope thank you MSNBC for supporting Crooked Hillary
21 | Michael Onwuzuruike | 1331645006931748_1331648380264744 | All fake polls! TrumPence is winning bigly coming November 8th! Go Trump!
22 | Don Warnick | 1331645006931748_1331648276931421 | ...geeeeeez...LoL..yesterday you reported that Hillary was 11 points ahead of Trump...looks like Trump is gaining fast...LoL..LoL..
23 | Raymond Towler | 1331645006931748_1331647786931470 | President Obama won by 4% in 2012 so that's probably accurate.538 has Hillary winning every swing state and AZ so Hillary has an 86% chance of winning the election
24 | Pamela Jessen Arrington | 1331645006931748_1331658233597092 | Donald Trump could never serve as our president without massive conflicts of interest. He should never have been allowed to run. He was not vetted.
25 | Bryant Amper | 1331645006931748_1331647420264840 | http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-10-25/podesta-shocker-cheryl-mills-tells-podesta-we-need-clean-obama-has-emails-herThat, ladies and gentlemen, is proof that the president not only lied, but did so with the clear intention of protecting the Clinton campaign.

1 | Lucie Boyo | 1331600766936172_1331604076935841 | There are tens of millions of people in this country who are dumb enough to support Trump who is a “demagogue” who appeals to the “lowest common denominator.”
2 | Bonnie Campos | 1331600766936172_1331601386936110 | On  November 8 the racist white, Trump supporters of the United States  will learn they have been grossly outnumbered for quite some time...
3 | Shane Harness | 1331600766936172_1331602496935999 | When you cast a vote for a proven corrupt candidate (Hillary) you become part of the the corruption. Vote Trump, let's drain the swamp.
4 | Kevin Blount | 1331600766936172_1331609076935341 | Besides people who work for him, who has ever said anything positive about Trump? He is hardly respected amongst his peers.
5 | Alvin Harrison | 1331600766936172_1331616713601244 | Thank you, Richard for speaking out. You have just articulated everything New Yorkers have known about him for years. It's why he will lose his own home city by a landslide!
6 | Loretta Magallon | 1331600766936172_1331612006935048 | Yeah, Trump is such a good employer he doesn't even know what healthcare his employees have what a loser idiot.
7 | Victoria Rogers | 1331600766936172_1331618930267689 | Trump is 70 years old and still hasn't learnt that being fair and honest matters, that treating people with respect and dignity matters, that human rights means civil rights and that everyone wants the same out of life regardless of ethnic group or socioeconomic status
8 | Julie Rose | 1331600766936172_1331611713601744 | I’m concerned about the imminent destruction of our nation through disastrous policies should the Democrats remain in control. I fear a dangerous, Third World level of lawless one-party rule by a party that has demonstrated its contempt for the Constitution, the rule of law, the separation of powers, the democratic process, the watchdog role of the media, the military, American sovereignty, capitalism and liberty. If Hillary Clinton can get away with all of her corruption before she is even in charge of the executive branch, can you imagine what she’d be able to do when controlling it, presumably with a mandate to continue in the same vein?Call me crazy. Call me an alarmist. Call me hyperbolic. But understand I am but one of the millions who fear for America’s future – and with overwhelmingly good reason.The choice between Clinton and Trump? It’s not even close.Read more at http://www.wnd.com/2016/10/dangerous-collusion-and-a-fearful-future/#riHrm8XviVhzlqKm.99
9 | Dar Sebelius Klitzka | 1331600766936172_1331619160267666 | I don't see many if any billionaires praising Trump. That's a very small exclusive club and they know each other well but I can't name one who is actively out there praising the likes of Trump. That's says it all when they can't back and praise one of their own.

12 | Beatrice Florina Florescu-Boomhower | 1331600766936172_1331627716933477 | Branson left shocked and worried he may become nr.6 on dopey donnie's list of people for which he will spend the rest of his sorry a..s life to exact revenge on. If Branson says don the con is dangerous and insane, we are ✅. So, vote Blue for sanity, drop the tin foil 🎩 and get back to reality, work, children, and pay taxes because trumpty dumpty doesn't anyway.

13 | Linda Caywood | 1331600766936172_1331627290266853 | Nice try stu.

But you are going to vote for her because.... you don't like Donald Trump ? That is insane!
14 | Barbara Stephenson | 1331600766936172_1331634610266121 | I just want to throw this out there. An honest question. When this election is over, and all the dust has settled, I would really like to know...  Can we, as Americans, accept the outcome and work together to make things better?  Can we all work as a team and make our communities better?  Whatever happens on November 8th, it's gonna happen. Let's look at November 9th. And January. Can we, as a country, as a united America, agree that change is needed. Can we, please, work together, to make the change better for our grand babies?
15 | Kenny Schuler | 1331600766936172_1331639713598944 | My buddy Jeff is rock solid. Last night we saw a car with a Hillary sticker on it, SO Jeff said The sticker was too small to let ppl know that this person is a supporter.. So he spray panted "In Black paint" Hillary for prison all over it... Im still rolling!!!
16 | David Serry | 1331600766936172_1331636523599263 | So... Does Branson support Hillary? That would be Dumber yet. I mean seriously.. if for the reasons he gives supporting Trump would be dumb.... then for those very same reasons, supporting Hillary would be Dumber yet.

Go home and lick your wounds and start making plans to leave the country w your fearless leader, dump trump!
20 | Dean Mueller | 1331600766936172_1331628370266745 | Who cares what this fruit thinks? Maybe we don't want Hillary, a despicable criminal who claims she was broke when they left the white house, is now worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Now we know from leaked emails that they were running a pay to play scam to use her influence as Secretary of State for those who donated to the Clinton Foundation or paid her dirtbag husband a fortune for 20 minute speeches. Maybe we also don't want a sixfold increase in Syrian refugees. Branson can keep sucking it.
21 | Dale Whiting | 1331600766936172_1331636156932633 | And Trump thinks 11 women coming out against him will hurt! Those pale in comparison to Branson's statements and all are at risk of a Trump presidency!

You will be paying everyone's college tuitions for the rest of your life.Hillary will continue Obamacare. Obamacare has a 25% increase this year and only one participant so far, every other insurance company has backed out. Hillary will also raise taxes, if you think this doesn't hurt you, think again. When your landlords taxes double your landlord will raise rents, tax hikes are a reason to increase rent controlled apartments. We cannot afford a Hillary presidency!

"It's over for Obamacare," Donald J. Trump declared while campaigning in Tampa last night.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Luanne Harper | 1331554630274119_1331560020273580 | Completely misleading headline. As the premiums rise, so do the stipends. I checked this morning and after reading all the hysterical the sky is falling posts, was shocked to see that the premium on the exact policy I had last year is actually cut by about 40%. If you're anti-Obama, then you hate Obamacare, but it has little to do with the system itself.
2 | Mary Garibay | 1331554630274119_1331564450273137 | Once Obama and the Dems gave up on single-payer, the ACA became a gift to the health insurance industry and big pharma...The best option would be single payer...Lets hope Hillary can get it done!
3 | Susan Hitchcock | 1331554630274119_1331569120272670 | And none of you remember the insurance companies raising everyone's rates annually before obamacare???????? At least now they HAVE to cover you! Meaning they can't deny coverage!!!!!!!!!
4 | Brad Hoctor | 1331554630274119_1331563263606589 | This surprises people when the Republican congress refused to fund the program? The reason premiums are going up and some companies are even pulling out of the ACA is because Republicans are being spoiled brats and are refusing to do their job in a sad attempt to blame Democrats for the stalemate hoping to regain the White House. They'd rather the budget be spent outrageously on weapons contracts that the joint chiefs of staff have already said are over funded since they (Republicans) have vested interests in those contracts. If congress is flipped and the ACA is allowed to be properly funded you'll see premiums go down and more companies participating. You'll also see the prices readjusted so it's not a burden to much of the middleclass like it currently is.
5 | Roger Gienapp | 1331554630274119_1331564426939806 | I don't understand why anyone would gloat over the fact that 30 million people are going to potentially lose their medical insurance. Why does it make a person happy when someone else is hurting?
6 | James Bertsch | 1331554630274119_1331563193606596 | It needs some work no doubt; but, in order to make it as effective as possible would require bipartisan efforts.  A concept foreign to our current government.
7 | Joe Vicki Lowrey | 1331554630274119_1331581053604810 | Health insurance premiums reflect the skyrocketing drug and hospital charges, as they always have; Obamacare's not to blame. It probably helped slow the increases.
8 | Peggy Hardt | 1331554630274119_1331564856939763 | There are NO premiums in 'Obamacare!'  It's NOT insurance!  It's the LAW that requires everyone to carry healthcare insurance, just like you are required to carry vehicle insurance.  If premiums are going up, blame the insurance companies.  They are the ones retaliating for having to provide insurance for pre-existing illnesses.  They are the ones retaliating for having to quit selling 'junk insurance' that takes your money, yet provides for nothing.
9 | Ed Levine | 1331554630274119_1331565016939747 | Social Security was a weak program when it started. We need to build on Obamacare, introduce a public option, go after big pharma and then the premiums will go way down.
10 | Steve Lynn | 1331554630274119_1331566073606308 | Trump the businessman said we need to repeal Obamacare while he said all his employees are on it? If he was a good employer he would be paying for a group plan for his employees but he is to cheap!!!
11 | Pam S. Kinkade | 1331554630274119_1331577176938531 | it's not just aca, it's all insurance. their trying to kill off all us older folks because young people pay in and don't use the insurance that often thus they line their pockets. (warren)
12 | Jaimee Brown Holdgate | 1331554630274119_1331601063602809 | If you only get your information from one source then dont vote. Educate yourself, gather information from multiple sites on both parties. And if after you've educated yourself and you still vote for Hillary.....then go back to school....someone did you a disservice.
13 | MJ Rich-Schmerberg | 1331554630274119_1331626953600220 | As usual, America's insurers do what they always do....manipulate the system in their favor. But, like anything else, many people  in this country only care about their own interests. I just got into it with a friend of my daughters at a birthday party on Saturday who was speaking out about "Obamacare" and  how it ruined America and her husband is a firefighter and his workload is increased because calls to 911 increased by 30 %". I said : "Really?  well isn't that because more people can actually call an ambulance now and get to the ER now? SHE said "NO, they're abusing the system" SO, I said,  I'm sure doctors offices are seeing the increase as well so I don't understand your vitriol for people who are availing themselves of healthcare"   What did I open my mouth for? She brought up a political sticking point, but when I called her on it by asking why she was complaining, when her husband is VERY WELL compensated by the tax payers for his job here in California, so why are you blaming the victims? I then became some sort of pariah for not allowing her to misalign people who are vulnerable, especially the aged, of whom she had previously misaligned when she spoke about her daughter working in a nursing home.  I won't even mention the things she said, except to say I hope I never have to go where her daughter works. I thought the rule was "first do no harm", but whatever.  I've already planned my offing so I don't deal with the abject hatred of the old and sick in this country by such very good Christians like her.
14 | Liberty Pierce | 1331554630274119_1331619806934268 | His quote, "my employees have so much trouble with ObamaCare".... says so much or little about the crap business owner he is. That's all. Read through the lines folks. He is just ramping up his TV station viewership with over millions in free publicity.
15 | David Caulkins | 1331554630274119_1331575770272005 | None of that is true. If you despise, you despise Obamacare. It's called the Affordable Care Act. The rates have stayed steady. The insurers raise them arbitrarily.
16 | Jim Campeau | 1331554630274119_1331575633605352 | Obamacare is a disaster that is crushing the middle class with double digit premium inflation. Poor people who can't afford insurance are forced to pay for it or pay fines they can't afford either. It needs to go away and quickly.
17 | Kay King Stemen | 1331554630274119_1331617296934519 | I have Obamacare. I need Obamacare. It has been good. My premium will go up some but it will still be affordable for me because I qualify for the government subsidy.  I need it for 4 more years until I can go on Medicare. Most of the people complaining about Obamacare don't even have it! They get health insurance through their work.
18 | Ronald Fisher Jr. | 1331554630274119_1331643940265188 | You don't think there is reason that this is being brought up 2 weeks before the election? Blame insurance companies not the Affordable Care Act. They like Republicans. They make more money when Republicans are in office. Wait until you get turned down because of a preexisting condition. You don't want to go back to that.
19 | Keith Lawson | 1331554630274119_1331654036930845 | The real issue is the MEC loophole being used by businesses. I had low cost comprehensive coverage through Obamacare, then my job offered the lowest Minimal Essential Coverage MEC, and I lost my stipend making it to expensive to have REAL health coverage. The MEC coverage covers a few doctor appt.'s but pray I do not go the hospital, no coverage for that.
20 | Robert Forsythe | 1331554630274119_1331561253606790 | TRUMPCARE: Just file for bankruptcy when the medical bills come in.
21 | Kendrick Toney | 1331554630274119_1331598536936395 | It's a shame how the Republican Party and the big insurance companies can get together and disrupt the ACA by raising rates to bring about discourse among consumers, and outright bring about a repeal of sorts! Shameless
22 | Maureen Kapp | 1331554630274119_1331645836931665 | The fault is not with Obamacare, but with the greed of the insurance companies, they are never satisfied with their profits, always greedy for more. And the corporations that own the physicians and also operated on greed.
23 | Eve Maria Bridgeforth | 1331554630274119_1331605683602347 | This Obamacare Scare tactic will NOT WORK.  I have it  as an entrepreneur finally. my dad was spared because of it and there is still room for improvement unlike the GOP with NO PLANS at all and totally ok with people going bankrupt due to health concerns.  SORRY...The GOP  and Trump is such a nightmare, this will not change 1 thing!!!
24 | Dennis Holder | 1331554630274119_1331617073601208 | And then he lied about his employees being on Obamacare.And couldn't afford the hoke in price. WHEN 95%of his employees insurance is paid through the company. And besides if he paid more the maybe they could afford insurance
25 | Jean Regenwether | 1331554630274119_1331624593600456 | I challenge the media, all media to this. So we yell the premiums are going up. Then you stop. Have a discussion as to why. Is it because of insurance companies? Is it due to the rising cost of all medical treatments? Is it due tot he cost of big pharm? Counter balance that with would premiums be going up without the ACA. There needs to be an indepth discussion on this issue. My gut feeling it all comes down to greed and profit. They beat the heck out of the American people before ACA with costs and premiums and they are still doing it. Before ACA, anyone without insurance that was treated and they could not pay, that affected all of use with increasing costs. I do not agree with people paying a fine, but one way or the other, the people end up absorbing the cost of the uninsured. The cost of health care with or with out the ACA has been rising and has been all about greed for a very very long time.

In a four-way match-up, Hillary Clinton enjoys 46% support among likely voters, while Donald J. Trump has 41% support.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Tawanda Harris | 1331515826944666_1331557016940547 | I wonder if all of the Trump supporters who are claiming that the system is rigged would be saying that if he was leading in the polls. This is the same "rigged" system that gave him the votes to become the republican presidential nominee.
2 | Brian Herring | 1331515826944666_1331535740276008 | It's amazing how Liberal media polls jump around so much... 10 points, 5points, 12 points... The election is very close and with all the facts coming out about polls and fraud it just shows us how bias they are.
3 | Louis Elias | 1331515826944666_1331544383608477 | We the People MUST put a stop to this corrupted and broken political system. We the People have a Voice and its Donald Trump. I encourage everyone to get out and vote, not registered then Get registered and Don't go on your own Take family members a Friend or Neighbour get out there and Vote Donald J. Trump this is the most important election in the History of this Nation. We the People will make our voice heard. This crooked establishment must be brought down
4 | Sue Smith | 1331515826944666_1331548063608109 | Do you  want a president that MAY totally disrespects women or do you want a president thats whole party disrespects othe unborn, wants to restrict the 2nd amendment, and believes that marriage is truly between ANY two concenting adults (mother, son case coming up) and will select Supreme Court justices to turn America that way.
5 | Karapet Beglaryan | 1331515826944666_1331525440277038 | Those who think that Trump is an outsider and can change the establishment and solve the problems they are concerned with should remember that Trump is surrounded and supported by current and former ultra right insiders. Trump, being less prepared and less informed, will very soon become a victim of those people in his administration. He will be the formal top while the country will be run by people who to some extent, have even more horrific ideas. Entering politics without prior experience and a well prepared team with healthy ideas is a necessary precondition for the success. His supporters are ready for revenge but not for service for the benefit of the whole society.
6 | Evelyn Silcott | 1331515826944666_1331525286943720 | Please keep the tin foil hats on and don't bother to vote for Trump. Stay home. It's a waste of time. Do something enjoyable. Yes, it's rigged......Vote Hillary Clinton!
7 | Jim Latham | 1331515826944666_1331632040266378 | In Hillary Clinton's America the Catholic Religion is "bastardized", Latinos are "needy", Blacks are "underachievers and never-do-wells", Trump supporters are "Deplorable", and Bernie Sanders supporters are "basement dwellers. Her own words; not mine. But hey, you just go right ahead and vote for her sunshine. Validate her hate and division and say it's "simply politics". Simply politics? Right. Whatever it takes for you to sleep well at night.
8 | Donna Copeland | 1331515826944666_1331551093607806 | Painful when you're collecting a salary and not reporting the full scope of the truth to the American people all because you're waiting in the wings for the benefit of the one that you're supporting report the truth report the emails guess it was okay for the reporting on Trump's stolen emails didn't hear any of you reporters complain about that but now all of the sudden you twist it around and you claim that because Hillary's emails or stolen they don't count they do they count more so than ever and the American people are wise to your deceptible reporting
9 | Harry Kagothos | 1331515826944666_1331521743610741 | To shame this doctored opinion poll,Americans should hold a protest vote for Trump .Teach your crooked media a lesson as media shouldn't be allow to select a president for the people.
10 | Dolores Liebner Dicicco | 1331515826944666_1331657896930459 | Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe’s political action committee donated nearly $500,000 to the election campaign of Dr. Jill McCabe--the wife of an FBI official who helped oversee the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server while secretary of state, the Wall Street Journal first reported.And the Virginia Democratic Party, a group over which the governor has considerable influence, contributed an additional $207,778 in the form of mailers, the campaign finance records indicate. The WSJ noted that this put donations from entities directly under McAuliffe or influenced by him at nearly $700,000, which was about a third of McCabe’s total campaign fundraising efforts. McAuliffe also reportedly recruited McCabe for the race.
11 | Loren Jury | 1331515826944666_1331531953609720 | What does it say about the level of discontent in our country that a professional salesman can launch a presidential campaign with a promise to build our very own Great Wall of China and a vague promise to "make America great again" -- and become the Republican standard-bearer?   And the Democrats? It is long overdue that we have a woman as a legitimate contender for the White House. But Hillary Clinton is the definition of the establishment so many are determined to reject
12 | David Procter | 1331515826944666_1331649003598015 | Let me see.  It was Clinton winning by eleven points over the weekend, but Trump complained about the polls, so now it's a five point lead.  Don't ever try to convince me about the honesty and reliability of polling.  It is but a refection of the corruption in politics.
13 | Mark Dooney | 1331515826944666_1331551976941051 | MSNBC live is corrupted..they speak of mostly Trumps downfalls and bash him every chance they can...how come they dont talk about crooked Hillary and the FBI payoff? because Hillary probably contributed a few 100k and told them more will come if she is elected
14 | Carrie Conrad Garrett | 1331515826944666_1331557876940461 | I'm glad the corrupt media is lying about the polls..It is getting more Republicans out to vote TRUMP...Thanks..Rasmussen and IBD/TIPP are the only polls that are actually true..These other ones from the media are totally bias and a load of crap..
15 | Mike Krott | 1331515826944666_1331552300274352 | And yet, still no story on Jill McCabe,  McAuliff, Andrew McCabe, #500k, and the quid pro quo of having a Dem Operative, 'investigating' #evilhiLIARy s email crime. And it is, a crime.#ClintonNewsNetwork is a joke.
16 | Michele Mccoy-Willis | 1331515826944666_1331536350275947 | Senator John McCain said on a radio show this:"I promise you that we will be united against any Supreme Court nominee that Hillary Clinton, if she were president, would put up...I promise you. This is where we need the majority."PLEASE DON'T GET COMPLACENT THIS ELECTION, WE STILL NEED TO GET OUT AND VOTE BECAUSE WE CAN'T TAKE ANYTHING FOR GRANTED. WE NEED TO MAKE OUR VOICE HEARD AND OUR VOTE COUNT ON NOVEMBER 8TH....Republicans are now trying to save the SENATE and HOUSE, knowing they're not going to get the White House.  All the obstruction that have been caused for the last 8 years with the refusal to consider proposals and have filibustered bills, have hurt and delayed progress of continued growth, and this has gone on way to long. We need a Democratic Senate and House to work with our Democratic President. As long as we keep in mind what's at stake in this election and that not only the Presidency, but the Senate, House and future Supreme Court Nominees. The Supreme Court is just as or more important, remember Supreme Court Justice Terms NEVER EXPIRE, only Retirement or Death creates a vacancy. The Laws that will be PASSED or REPEALED will impact the life of our CHILDREN and GRANDCHILDREN for DECADES to COME.We need to keep the White House and take back the House and Senate. Vote BLUE from the LOCAL COURTHOUSE to the WHITE HOUSE, and make a stop by the MAYORS, GOVERNORS, and STATE HOUSE. We need to make sure we get the Representives we need, from the local level to the national level, who will get the job done that they were elected to do. Don't leave out anyone!!!VOTE BLUE DOWN THE TICKET and STAY FOCUSED ON THE TASK AT HAND!!!! (feel free to copy, paste and share)
17 | Diane Marie Wargo | 1331515826944666_1331516883611227 | It's rigged and don't lie and say its not. The same government that has repeatedly lied about arming or not arming rebels in the Middle East ..... Sure they wouldn't rig the election, lol
18 | Shawna Carey | 1331515826944666_1331592083603707 | Dear all young voters...Please remember that Hillary Clinton sold massive weapons to ISIS knowing that ISIS beheads woman and they use innocent little toddlers as soldiers and teach them at as young as 5 years old how to execute civilians by shooting in the head or beheadings...If the babies don't follow through the the leader will chop the toddler in half...HILLARY SUPPORTS THAT...#PleaseStopHillary #SaveTheChildren
19 | Harry Kagothos | 1331515826944666_1331554856940763 | If Trump is just a nobody why has he attracted the huge number of enemies outside there not only to finish him politically but also financially by attacking his businesses .This is an eye opener that he is the guy to change American politics . Business as usual and old older will only isolate US .Hope voters will breath a fresh air of change politically or they live to regret the missed opportunity to change .
20 | Sebastian Pinto | 1331515826944666_1331528363610079 | You guys aren't doing a good job. With all the negative stuff about DT that you guys are saying he still manages 41% according to your poll is a phenomenal achievement.
21 | Marco Matteucci | 1331515826944666_1331564770273105 | So this is a scientific proof that american people consists in a:46% of monkeys41% of donkeysnor those monkeys neither those donkeys has the slightest perception of their existence on Earth: They simply eat, sleep, vote, but the monkeys will win the US election farce
22 | Blakeney Adams | 1331515826944666_1331599043603011 | Everyone, including myself, gets on social media and bashes the candidate they don't like. I do it to laugh at the responses and to watch heads explode with idiotic responses, but imagine this.What if Americans voted the outsider, Donald Trump, into the office of POTUS and then voted out every last single established career politician and replaced them with new blood. Replaced with Republican and Democratic leaders who owed nothing to no one except the American people. A fresh start for America with politicians that cared about you, your family, the laws and the Constitution. How great would that be for a change?Feel free to share this.
23 | Mike A Dickerson | 1331515826944666_1331528373610078 | Trump is a threat to the GOP elite. And the democratic elite. Those folks don't care about the people its all about donors and getting reelected. No matter how good they tell us the economy is for wallstreet, on mainstreet regular americans are still struggling and unable to find decent jobs. They talk a good game but its all smoking mirrors.why do you think their only argument against trump is that he's "mean" the dems rather create irrelevant issues and act like they are priority. Botton line , we need jobs and lower taxes. And real investment in America. For 8 years obama been talking about jobs to rebuild the infrastructure,  Where are they? It will never happen because they would lose a talking point for the next crooked politician.
24 | Rose Marie | 1331515826944666_1331516603611255 | HRC wants single-payer universal health care!!! THAT is the ONLY thing that is going to work in today's world where employer's no longer provide health insurance!! I am hoping and praying for universal health care sooner rather than later!!!
25 | Gregory Dale Holland | 1331515826944666_1331520196944229 | Trump is a man with a vision for America, not a specific vision, a great vision...the best vision...Trump has a plan to make this country great again....What plan??....a great plan...a plan that will work because it's the best plan.....Why???... because Trump knows good people...which people???....the best people....people that are not stupid like other people....people who know how to get deals done...what deals???...great deals...the biggest deals... because I know words... What words???...I have the best words... I get my information from watching TV... I consult with myself because I have a great brain... A great brain???...the best brain...Trump will also build a big wall to keep Mexicans out and he will make Mexico pay for it!...How....??? its all part of the great plan!...ISIS will be gone very, very quickly...How???... I won't tell you.. It's a secret !!!... (This guy is a “one-man circle jerk” and he is only about entertaining the uneducated who love him and his great plan. He's all air - no substance.

Biden said his biggest issue with the election is that there's been no discussion of policy, in part due to Donald J. Trump's many controversies.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Dennis Cossiboon | 1331479410281641_1331480126948236 | I am a gay man in a very liberal town in Illinois and I vote Trump. No one ever called Trump a racist or any other label till he started running for president. Love it when a liberal says I watch "faux" too much.. Fox is part owned by Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia and Qatar (countries known for brutal treatment of women and gays) partly funds Hillary Clinton's campaign and foundation in play for pay. Wikileaks also released that ISIS is funded by Saudi Arabia and Qatar....so why would I trust Fox or believe Hillary Clinton's bs about stopping ISIS, when wikileaks shown Hillary armed ISIS and accepted donations from ISIS financiers.... Trump has zero involvement in this type of behavior. Clinton is for sale, and will continue to use her positions of power to line her pockets will simultaneously screwing American people. Just like WSJ released yesterday the FBI was paid off during her criminal investigation of server and E-mail. Just like she had a public stance against gays while running against Obama and now it's just her private stance to her donors. She undoubtedly would be the most crooked President in history.
2 | Jami Dickerson Weathers | 1331479410281641_1331484450281137 | Why are you not covering the fact that insurance premiums under Obamacare is going up 25% or more November 1st? You say you care about your viewers but you are doing nothing to tell them the truth!! Come over to FOX news people and hear what it's going to cost you now to have insurance you can't use!!
3 | Pam Ben | 1331479410281641_1331481676948081 | Because Hillary should be disqualified as she has broken the rules and the law many, many times during this election. She should not be allowed to run. Funny though that she cannot get anyone to go to her rally's and Trump has hundreds of thousands and Hillary camp thinks she is going to win. In my opinion it is good (trump) vs evil (Hillary).
4 | David Fuller | 1331479410281641_1331495920279990 | "This is some one else's post! Thought I would share it! "VOTERS BEWARE: I voted a straight party ticket this morning. Before pressing the cast ballot button, I scanned to make sure all I had voted for appeared in the final list. All did EXCEPT my choice for President. I called the helper and she was puzzled. The judge came and she was also puzzled. I had to go back to page 1, indicate straight party ticket and then scroll down to my Presidential candidate and click on that name. After that, the final ballot appeared as I wanted and then I cast my ballot.My advice: Double check your ballot before you press the final cast ballot button."Came from a voter in the Houston area...No dems are complaining...pay attention people...voter fraud is out en force!We are getting record numbers of voters this year...Texas is a red state so most are repubs!

5 | Kathy Manuel | 1331479410281641_1331545453608370 | Biden you should be more concerned about calling out the BAD Job Mr President did on Obamacare....HE LIED to the AMERICAN People! Fooled me once shame on me, Fool me twice shame on YOU!  NO you bunch of liars there won't be a second time, I'm VOTING TRUMP!
6 | Don Lister | 1331479410281641_1331496566946592 | Why is the media ignoring the polls predicting Trump is in the lead? I'm betting you've never heard a word about these polls in the media.Rasmussen has Trump up by 43-41 percent.USC/LA Times has Trump up by 1 point.And most importantly, the most accurate poll of the 2012 election, IBD/TIPP has Trump up 43 to 41 percent.Funny how the mainstream media doesn’t mention these polls.
7 | Steed Hamilton Houlsby | 1331479410281641_1331482450281337 | We should talk about Biden not being able to keep his hands to himself and being a overall creep and wierdo.. he says he wants to punch Trump in the face, double standard you dont report.
8 | Johnny Steel | 1331479410281641_1331538346942414 | Looks like more FBI corruption exposed as the jail a general for giving a reporter some info on Iran deal but saying Hillary is clear ????? Hillary did 100 times worse. Now the FBI is involved in a big money deal where cash was exchanged with the clintons and their buddies and FBI members! We have no federal law enforcement. Obama and Loretta lynch actually got the FBI to become criminal ! I'm voting Trump. Our country is under attack from within. FBI is corrupt!!!!!
9 | Dave Appel | 1331479410281641_1331648333598082 | The statement by Biden would imply that he doesn't believe Clinton or Kaine are strong enough to dictate or express their own message. Highlighting their weakness is not a strong endorsement for either of them for executive leadership.
10 | Joy Bryant | 1331479410281641_1331483336947915 | since the crowds are turning on the media - why can't or doesn't the media simply say - for the safety of our employees - we aren't covering the next trump hate rally ?  Well leave the word hate out
11 | Anthony Morgan | 1331479410281641_1331515590278023 | I love how you lying democrats deflect when the heat is on your sorry behinds. Biden stood there with his drunken self-side by side with the dumbest man in the room Obama as the disaster named after him has sunken the poor black folks further into a pit they cannot get out! Why didn’t you run your drunken mouth about his disastrous policies then?
12 | Courtney Sustendal Smith | 1331479410281641_1331514243611491 | The media, MSNBC, is covering the ridiculous controversies. I guarantee most Americans care more about the economy than Trump calling a former Miss Universe fat. Trump has policies - it's the medias fault for not informing people.
13 | Mike Krott | 1331479410281641_1331552893607626 | My biggest issue is the slobbering in the tank media. How about a report on this?  And yet, still no story on Jill McCabe,  McAuliff, Andrew McCabe, #500k, and the quid pro quo of having a Dem Operative, 'investigating' #evilhiLIARy s email crime. And it is, a crime.#ClintonNewsNetwork is a joke.
14 | Jeanne Ruf | 1331479410281641_1331529936943255 | I believe that's what the media chooses to report. It's the media Joe Biden. They could report on so much policy, but when you are biased and you have people who love only sex and entertainment then that's what you report.
15 | Kathy Manuel | 1331479410281641_1331538103609105 | Why no coverage on this ..... a little bias reporting I'd say? Clinton Ally Aided Campaign of FBI Official’s Wife.

16 | Joanie Smith | 1331479410281641_1331653856930863 | It's because he has no answers about issues..just lies his way thru day by day about nothing...he is a total fraud and if you can't see that then you are blind in one eye and can't see out of the other. Do your homework folks..stop just watching Faux News who couldn't tell the truth about what is going on if their lives depended on it..
17 | Barry Hochfield | 1331479410281641_1331507973612118 | You see the problem is of the three things required of any political candidate, 1 competence, 2 integrity and 3 good policies, we are all used to ticking the first two boxes quite quickly and focussing on selecting based on the 3rd. With Trump he fails so miserably at requirements 1 and 2 he's even threatened the very fabric of democracy while we spin inside his rat-holes. Just as well Hillary is an acceptable alternative although I'd rather would have had Bernie or even Michelle (her time will come though)
18 | Don Brittain | 1331479410281641_1331494186946830 | Our country will need lots of healing after this election. So many supporting both of these candidates are passionate about their beliefs. I stand for our republic and the candidate that will uphold the beliefs of our Constitution. I trust each American citizen will take the time to look past the sludge each candidate has slung and look at which candidate will not trample on our Life, Liberty, and Pursuit of Happiness!!!! Trump has many flaws and will need to surround himself with great advisors, but being a retired veteran I can't vote for Hillary understanding if I would have lied under oath I would have been held to a higher standard than she. Keep the faith in our Republic and May God Bless America.
19 | Tamara Meyer | 1331479410281641_1331561430273439 | From all that I've read, if Trump had been able to show he has problem solving abilities, he would be well on his way to becoming President. His me-only, slap-down solutions are not intimidating, they're scary. His "when I'm done with you" attitude doesn't just scare the enemies.
20 | Joe Quinn | 1331479410281641_1331586710270911 | Sweet. Let's talk about how democratic policies have failed the country for 60 years. Just look at Detroit. A gleaming example of democratic failure.
21 | Ken Stewart | 1331479410281641_1331521326944116 | LMAO! Biden is clueless! Hillary's had more serious controversies than Trump in this campaign. Every day it's a different scandal with Clinton, her campaign, her foundation, or her emails! Trump reveals a number of issues in his first 100 days in office speech and what does the lamestream liberal media do? They focus on his comment to sue the accusers and give zero coverage to the contents of his speech! Clinton wants to avoid the issues! ObamaCare Obama's main claim to fame, is a disaster, the economy is in doldrums, and the results of Obama/Clinton in the foreign policy arena has been abysmal! She can't run on Obama's record or hers, and voting for her is just 4 more years of the past 8 years, which just goes to show how stupid Dumbocrats are! If Clinton talks about the issues, she gets her clock cleaned! Can't wait to see their ObamaCare premiums jump 25-100% and then see how excited they are!

I do it to laugh at the responses and to watch heads explode with idiotic responses, but imagine this.What if Americans voted the outsider, Donald Trump, into the office of POTUS and then voted out every last single established career politician and replaced them with new blood. Replaced with Republican and Democratic leaders who owed nothing to no one except the American people. A fresh start for America with politicians that cared about you, your family, the laws and the Constitution. How great would that be for a change?Feel free to share this.

Monday was Elizabeth Warren's turn to join her fellow Democrats in cranking up the heat on her Republican colleagues in the Senate, who have become as big of targets as Donald J. Trump in the closing days of the campaign.

It is about replaceing dead weight money grabbers in Congress who will continue to do nothing. This current Congress has proven they cant and wont work with the current president or a future president. They need to go!
2 | Leonard Merriman | 1331437386952510_1331467486949500 | Create a huge Ground game in Texas, Ohio & Florida Hillary Clinton and crush chump along with TV appearances daily or press conferences , come on you do those and watch people wake up to the truths
3 | Don Brittain | 1331437386952510_1331495020280080 | Our country will need lots of healing after this election. So many supporting both of these candidates are passionate about their beliefs. I stand for our republic and the candidate that will uphold the beliefs of our Constitution. I trust each American citizen will take the time to look past the sludge each candidate has slung and look at which candidate will not trample on our Life, Liberty, and Pursuit of Happiness!!!! Trump has many flaws and will need to surround himself with great advisors, but being a retired veteran I can't vote for Hillary understanding if I would have lied under oath I would have been held to a higher standard than she. Keep the faith in our Republic and May God Bless America.

I'm betting you've never heard a word about these polls in the media.Rasmussen has Trump up by 43-41 percent.USC/LA Times has Trump up by 1 point.And most importantly, the most accurate poll of the 2012 election, IBD/TIPP has Trump up 43 to 41 percent.Funny how the mainstream media doesn’t mention these polls.

I am an Independent who leans Democrat, but I am proud of Repubs who stand against a racist party leader at the risk of losing support from the party and possibly their future in politics. We need to stop mud-slinging and start working together to get things done in Washington for Americans. This election should end a two-party system. I may be naive, but I believe most politicians are good people trying to do their best for their constituents.

The GOP is easy enough for me to not support but the Democrats are not much better. Looking past the facade, Republicans and Democrats only serve Republicans and Democrats.

9 | Dennis Cossiboon | 1331437386952510_1331480196948229 | I am a gay man in a very liberal town in Illinois and I vote Trump. No one ever called Trump a racist or any other label till he started running for president. Love it when a liberal says I watch "faux" too much.. Fox is part owned by Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia and Qatar (countries known for brutal treatment of women and gays) partly funds Hillary Clinton's campaign and foundation in play for pay. Wikileaks also released that ISIS is funded by Saudi Arabia and Qatar....so why would I trust Fox or believe Hillary Clinton's bs about stopping ISIS, when wikileaks shown Hillary armed ISIS and accepted donations from ISIS financiers.... Trump has zero involvement in this type of behavior. Clinton is for sale, and will continue to use her positions of power to line her pockets will simultaneously screwing American people. Just like WSJ released yesterday the FBI was paid off during her criminal investigation of server and E-mail. Just like she had a public stance against gays while running against Obama and now it's just her private stance to her donors. She undoubtedly would be the most crooked President in history.
10 | Paul Ruehs | 1331437386952510_1331468946949354 | Why it’s important to change the Congress this election cycle … Trump may win in November (according to him, he is winning as is reflected in “several polls” … many swing states are extremely close and could go either way) it will not benefit our form of democracy to have all three tenants of government controlled by a single party … Republicans will have the presidency, both houses of Congress, and the US Supreme Court.  Trump will have a blank check to do what so ever he wants with no checks and balances imposed to ensure all citizen’s interests are represented.  If Trump loses the election, and the GOP continues to control the Congress, it will be business as usual meaning that nothing will get done and gridlock will continue.  Over the past six years the Republicans controlled the Senate and House.  Time and again, they have proven they are incapable of moving bills and/or doing anything.  And finally, we continuously hear how people are “feed up” and dissatisfied with the direction the country is headed, this being the case, it makes no sense to constantly vote the same people (the ones who are responsible for the competency of our government) into office, i.e. Marco Rubio.  Rubio has stated on numerous occasions that he hates his job and doesn’t show up for work because it would make no difference.  Yet, Rubio has no qualms about cashing his overly generous pay check every two weeks.  And sees no hypocrisy in applying for the same job!  If you vote the status quo don’t expect anything to change.
11 | Ruth Gonzales | 1331437386952510_1331503260279256 | Elizabeth Warren is one hell of a great speaker for the people I watched her in Congress go after the CEO of Wells Fargo Bank and she asked him questions that he could not answer days later he resigned Well Fargo lied to their customers the people who put their hard earned money into their banks and than the CEO blamed it on the people who only made about 12 dollars a hr and they were fired but when the CEO resigned he left with millions of $ and Elizabenth Warren went after him hard but he played the blame game and you know who does that yes Trump does. Wells Fargo has lost the trust of the people.    And I don't blame them at all.
12 | Sandra Felberg | 1331437386952510_1331650450264537 | If I told you that Democratic Party lobbyist Tony Podesta, whose brother John Podesta chairs Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, is a registered foreign agent on the Saudi government’s payroll, you’d probably think I was a Trump-thumping, conspiratorial nutcase. But it’s true.The lobby firm created by both Tony and John Podesta in 1988 receives $140,000 a month from the Saudi government, a government that beheads nonviolent dissidents, uses torture to extract forced confessions, doesn’t allow women to drive, and bombs schools, hospitals and residential neighborhoods in neighboring Yemen.The Podesta Group’s March 2016 filing, required under the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938, shows that Tony Podesta himself oversees the Saudi account. At the same time, Tony Podesta is also a top campaign contributor and bundler for Hillary Clinton. So while one brother runs the campaign, the other brother funds it with earnings that come, in part, from the Saudis.  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/medea-benjamin/hillary-clinton-the-podes_b_11779826.html

Electing him was like turning on a light in a dark room and exposing the cockroaches. Unfortunately for them, AMERICA IS DOING BETTER THAN EVER. RECORD unemployment numbers, legalized gay marriage, 5% growth, best year for jobs since 1999, consumer confidence up, deficit down 60% in 2014, gas prices low, health insurance cheaper than ever ($85/month), car insurance cheaper than ever ($25 per month from Insurance Panda), the 1% starting to be taxed more!There are a lot of people who don't like President Obama simply because he's black they just don't say it out loud.

While he was in office, in 1978, Bill and Hilary Clinton made a real estate investment, partnering with a woman named Susan McDougal. Together they purchased 220 acres of land for what would become the Whitewater Development Corporation. The investment went bad, and the Clintons lost $40,000. Businessman David Hale stepped up, and made criminal allegations against the three investors, saying he was pressured into providing a $300,000 federally-back loan to McDougal. She ended up serving 18 months in prison for contempt of court for refusing to answer questions about the matter. Before leaving office, Bill Clinton granted McDougal a pardon.

In the year 2000 American military had four opportunities to kill the leader, but pulled back, giving various reasons such as wanting to capture him alive, fear of killing innocent civilians and failing to kill him, while hurting diplomatic ties.

Our country has been so good to me, and I felt I had to act.“I’ve seen the system up close and personal for many years. I’ve been a major part of it, I know how the game works in Washington and Wall Street. I know how the rules are rigged every day against Americans.”One of the biggest problem, he said, is rampant voter fraud and the refusal of the media to recognize it, along with any poll that shows Trump ahead in the polls.So to an enthusiastic crowd, Trump outlined his ten-point plan to “Make America Great Again.” He called it a contract between himself and the American people. Here are some of the acts he would implement within the first 100 days of his administration:    Push a constitutional amendment for term limits for members of Congress.    A hiring freeze on all federal employees to reduce federal workforce through attrition, exempting military public safety and public health.    A permanent Ban on members of the Executive administration from ever becoming political lobbyists.    Eliminating two federal regulations for every one passed.    Repeal the “Obamacare Disaster” and provide relief to American families.    Impose tough tariffs on foreign imports to keep American companies from moving overseas.    Immediately open up energy production to jumpstart our economy.    Appoint judges who will strictly uphold the Constitution.    Immediately begin renegotiating NAFTA to make it a better deal.Trump made a point of saying he would not approve the Time Warner-AT&T merger deal, arguing it would be too much consolidation in an already limited media market.Trump also said he would cancel “every unconstitutional executive action, memorandum and order issued by Barack Obama, cancel funding for sanctuary cities, remove all of the more than 2 million criminal illegal immigrants from the country. “These are our drug dealers, gang heads, gang members, killers, and cancel visas to foreign countries that won’t take them back.”gettysburg Trump
21 | John Younkin | 10154029326139067_10154029940724067 | Many wonder why Hilary stayed with Bill after he was publically outed for having an extramarital affair with Monica Lewinsky. It’s been reported that Hilary knew of Bill’s cheating habits, and they weren’t limited to the White House Intern. For someone who is so vocal about women’s rights, why did she choose to stay with a man who wasn’t loyal? Ronald Kessler, an investigative journalist who specializes in writing about the Secret Service claims Hilary and Bill’s marriage is a ‘total fake’ and the two stayed together for a business relationship that will undoubtedly make them both richer.
22 | John Younkin | 10154029326139067_10154029960369067 | Hilary Called Out for Looking Down on Poor and Uneducated, Hilary prides herself on her elite education, including Wellseley College and Yale Law School, where she met Bill. Their marriage led to Hilary’s quick climb into power and high society. With so much privilege, many question whether she can truly relate to the lower and middle-class people, who she says she will help. People who have worked alongside Hilary have reported her as a snob, and that she believes she is better than those who are less educated and wealthy. In an interview with Fox and Friends Weekend Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee said, “Hillary Clinton is an elitist snob. She believes she’s smarter than you. She thinks that she’s more sophisticated than you.”
23 | Phil Parker | 10154029326139067_10154029407679067 | DON'T FORGET TO VOTE EARLY & VOTE OFTEN!!I guess the Obama's forget what they said about Hillary back in 2008?  So which Obama story should we believe... the 2008 version, or the 2016 version??
24 | Michael Hall | 10154029326139067_10154029490309067 | OBAMA...aint doing nothing and wont be allowed to do nothing.....so many people are doing the exact opposite of what he tells them to do.......your done....so get the hell out of the house.....TRUMP...is moving in......nice post MSNBC.....sorry about your luck....and hopefully yall will be shut down soon as well for being a pitiful excuse for news.....that does nothing but lie to the public .....thats not what you should do....shame on you.....THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL......WONT WIN IN THE END.....WELL....ITS NOT WINNING NOW BUT YOU TRY AND CONVINCE THE PUBLIC THAT IT IS.......YOUR A JOKE
25 | Dennis Lunstroth | 10154029326139067_10154029481384067 | This is the biggest fear among the GOP. That a liberal court will toss out all those Gerrymandered districts that keep them in office despite the changing voting habits of America. That happens and they will cease to exist outside of a few pockets of dead enders.

During a rally in Tampa, Donald J. Trump said he has "nothing to do with Russia"... but then went on to say our leaders "say such bad things about Putin" that it's no wonder Moscow doesn't want to negotiate with them.

2 | Clay Acorn | 1331084986987750_1331111403651775 | Russia and Trump go hand and hand, they're one in the same, come November 8th it's all over for Trump and his basket of deplorables.

When you win the presidency, we will block you every turn.If Trump wins, the election is legitimate and the people have SPOKEN. If Hillary wins, it must be RIGGED.Donald Trump is accused of forcing himself on over ten women. STICK TO THE ISSUES. Bill Clinton accused of misconduct by 4 women. His wife should be disqualified from office.Hillary Clinton has not directly mentioned any of Trump's accusers. She need to stop distracting from real issues. Trump has a press conference with 4 of Bill Clinton's accusers, gives them front row seats to the debate, and mentions them at a debate. Great job taking the gloves off president Trump.Bill Clinton cheats on his wife. Impeach him. Trump proudly brags about sexual assault (has 5 kids with 3 wives and has cheated on his wives). Elect him.Hillary oversaw the department of state while 4 people died in an embassy attack. JAIL HER. 2 Republicans were in office while over 200 people died in embassy attacks. No problem.Immigrants don't pay taxes. Round them up and kick them out. Trump doesn't pay taxes. He's a business genius.Independent fact checkers found Trump is likely the least truthful candidate in the history of politics. He tells it like it is. Hillary is statistically more truthful than most politicians according to fact checkers. She is the most untrustworthy person ever.Hillary's foundation only spent 87% of their donations helping people (average amount is 75%). CROOKED. Trumps foundation paid off his debts, bought paintings of him, and made political donations to avoid investigations for a fake university while using less than 5% of funds for charity (and he got shut down by NY State). So savvy... Put him in the white house.Trump made 4 billion dollars in 40 years, when an index fund started at the same time with the same "small loans" he received would be worth $12 billion today... without a trail of bankruptcies, thousands of lawsuits and burned small business owners. He's a real business whiz. Hillary took a loss of $700k. She's a criminal.Trump is the first candidate in the modern era not to release his tax returns, and took a billion dollar loss in 1 year. Genius. Hillary releases 40 years of taxes. Corrupt.Trump denies saying things (on the record) he actually said (on the record), he's just telling it like it is.Your arguments are thin. Your ignorance of reality is shocking.  Your double-standards are offensive, and your willingness to blindly support him and recycle the rhetoric is absurd. Your opinion is not fact. Your memes are not news articles. And your hypocrisy is not a platform."

Trump is turning out to be a disaster for the Republican Party, the real estate magnate is pretty much guaranteed to come out richer. That was the plan all along. And conservative voters, conditioned by decades of right-wing politicians and media exploiting and enhancing their gullibility, make the perfect victims for his ruse. https: newrepublic com/article/134667/conservatives-groomed-perfect-suckers-trumps-epic-scam

He has borrowed money from the banks in Russia and presumably has done deals with the Oligarchs, in reality, controlled by Putin and Russia Mobsters. I would presume Trump is sweating bullets if he can't win the election. Just like with the old Sicilian Mobsters, they wanted pay backs or you could find yourself in a heap of trouble.
13 | Jermaine Cool | 1331084986987750_1331322693630646 | Gosh! Trump? Most case the relations between 2 nations is about its citizen and resources not the president.

America is loosing face on world stage because of him.
14 | Yvonne Kemp | 1331084986987750_1331475260282056 | It is very strange that no one has hacked into Donald Trumps email, but he is screaming that the system is rigged, well Hilary Clinton could say the same thing, since everyone thinks it is so popular to hate Hilary, especially the males with all their comments they make putting her down all the time in the eye's of the public. Wow what some men won't team up together and do to women. SAD TO SEE.

Just for this time have courage and say no the person who by all means cannot be a role model and a symbol for the country. I understand, you might disagree with the Democratic Party ideology and its candidate but this is the only way to get your party back. Let the team of haters, racists, and sex offenders sunk.

Libertarian presidential nominee Gary Johnson insists that Americans who support him will not be wasting their votes in November.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | David Richoux | 1331088473654068_1331092176987031 | No, that is not the way things work right now. In a perfect world, I still wouldn't vote for him because he lacks the skills needed to be President. Maybe a better 3rd Party candidate, but not this one.
2 | Zach Booth | 1331088473654068_1331093586986890 | My conscience, blissfully, does not incline me to vote for candidates who would wreck the entirety of the safety net to accord with naive libertarian ideology.
3 | Candice Wagner | 1331088473654068_1331103610319221 | To be honest I would like to vote for someone not as liberal as Clinton,or as far right and stuck on himself as Trump...but this guy has less knowledge of government than a fifth grader. My conscience says vote Clinton because. There is nobody else running more qualified. Stien is a nut
4 | Shahin Mahdavi | 1331088473654068_1331099253652990 | People, please please don't vote for another Nader, don't ruin America by voting for him. Do you remember 2000 election? Now is not the time to show your libertarianisms!!!!!Please cast your vote with thoughts not emotions....
5 | Larry Greenberg | 1331088473654068_1331095623653353 | Some of you need to get over yourself and just vote for Hillary there is no alternative we don't care about your conscience.
6 | Daniel Ueltschi | 1331088473654068_1331096846986564 | Gary Johnson was simply out of it this year, both in his election chances and his overall awareness. Thought he was great 4 years ago but maybe he's hit his head on something since then.
7 | Rachel Anne Osborn Martin | 1331088473654068_1331100203652895 | The election is too close and too important for protest votes. Neither 3rd party candidates are strong candidates for President. I don't mean their chances of winning which are nihl; I mean their qualifications, experience and preparedness to be President are just not up to standard. If you care about our nation vote who you think would do the best job as President. There is only one qualified candidate.
8 | Jeff Hall | 1331088473654068_1331121410317441 | 5% popular vote gets the Libertarian Party upgraded status, no need to petition for future state ballots (energy can be redirected towards campaigning), & Federal matching of campaign funds as long as we stay there. But yes, tell us more how wasteful our votes are.
9 | Linda Mills-Minor | 1331088473654068_1331159976980251 | This was the perfect election to boost a third party candidate yet the Libertarians gave us Johnson who is so ill prepared for the job. #missedopportunity
10 | Sharon Mullican | 1331088473654068_1331185926977656 | The Libertarians are the Tea Party without the religious right agenda...they want no government, no government protections or services and pay your own way no matter how young, old or infirm. Capitalism with no controls. It's great if you're already rich, bad if you don't want to be a slave.
11 | Jack Bronson | 1331088473654068_1331162386980010 | I was willing to listen to the guy, but after so many stupid gaffes, he lost me.  Like Bernie, he's calling attention to some real problems but he's not ready for primetime.  My vote goes to Her.
12 | Beatrice Florina Florescu-Boomhower | 1331088473654068_1331094713653444 | It's okay Gary, go back to hiking, smoking...whatever it is you smoke, take some geography lessons, and come back when we need some more entertainment. We will not vote for you anymore, you are a true disappointment.
13 | Jeff Hall | 1331088473654068_1331116476984601 | To call someone's vote wasted is to arrogantly (and often incorrectly) assume that they would consider voting for your candidate.
14 | Carl Funkweiler | 1331088473654068_1331097290319853 | and yet, some Bernie supporters are voting for this idiot when his policies are nothing close to Bernie's.
15 | Jeff Hall | 1331088473654068_1331110346985214 | "Insists" implying he's wrong. Haha you "news" networks are pathetic. HRC will get all CA's electoral votes anyways. My vote goes to the 5% the Libertarian Party needs to get federally matched funds like the big two.
16 | Alice Boyden | 1331088473654068_1331137653649150 | He was our governor. I remember the insults he hurled at teachers calling us lazy and undeserving of raises. That's when I was teaching all day and bringing home hours of work every night.
17 | Brian Squeaky Switzer | 1331088473654068_1331174113645504 | If it was Bernie Sanders, I'd vote for him, but Gary Johnson?  Naw.  I'd rather vote for one of Two candidates that might actually win.
18 | Jeff Hall | 1331088473654068_1331118800317702 | You're right - only one ticket qualified with executive legislative experience over large groups of citizens & residents. Re-elected Governors Johnson & Weld.
19 | Jens Rettberg | 1331088473654068_1331348970294685 | After one decides to vote third party, there's still a choice between him and Stein - what are positive arguments to vote for him? Is it his plan to make students debt-free? Is it his plan to go against climate change? Is it his plan for LGBT rights? What is it that people would say, Yes, Johnson is the right man?
20 | Laurie Vyselaar | 1331088473654068_1331536470275935 | I'm voting for Gary Johnson as are millions of people. He is the only candidate that hasn't totally embarrassed this country with sex scandals and dirty politics. He is not involved in pay to play with countries and corporations. His plan is to cut government waste and address entitlements. Social security goes over the fiscal cliff in 2030. That is only 14 years from now. Hillary's plan adds more entitlements and folks the money will come out of our pockets. Taxing the super wealthy won't happen. They have moved their money to foundations like the Clintons, Gates and Trumps. They have a life time of income from their foundations and it is tax deductible. Wake up America.
21 | Lorraine Palmer | 1331088473654068_1331141633648752 | Just say no to 3rd party election spoiler. Just say no to libertarian dismantling of the social safety net. Just say no to tongue biting, blithering idiot, what's Aleppo? Johnson!
22 | Jay Leathers | 1331088473654068_1331508290278753 | Because voting for someone w five percent in the polls isn't wasting a vote? Talk about white, upper class privilege. The poor, people of color, vets, disabled, these people will be impacted by  Trump win, not this psycho.
23 | Cade Foster | 1331088473654068_1331622120267370 | Guys like this should pitch in and endorse Hillary since they have no chance whatsoever in scoring by themselves - we call these people so-called Libertarian spoilers . They placed themselves between the sheets only to confuse confused ones and with their little votes while transferred to the Democrats would make not only a nice gesture but also an improvement to the present democratic party's scores .
24 | Ann Ellen Smith | 1331088473654068_1331552990274283 | Look Gary, you are a good guy. You aren't going to win, this year. If you love America throw your support to Trump. He will stop corruption so you have an actual chance of election in another year. Just saying ❣️🇺🇸
25 | Joan Walters Peterman | 1331088473654068_1331119080317674 | Yes they will !!! You have no chance to win !! You are really not qualified because you didn't know about Aleppo or couldn't name a world leader. Really should give up the smoke !!

We are now just 15 days away from the presidential election. What were the headlines in past campaigns when it was 15 days to election day?

All In with Chris Hayes takes a deep dive into the archives to find out.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Joseph Matthews | 719376668227361_719400924891602 | For MSNBC viewers, I'll report news of the day to you since you won't hear it on this network: Huge spikes in price increases in Obamacare are killing the middle class; Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe donated about $700,000 through PACs to suport the political campaign of a candidate married to the second in charge at the FBI who helped "investigate" Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server; an undercover video reconfirms that Mrs. Clinton's campaign coordinated efforts to cause violence at Trump rallies; and Donald Trump gave yet another inspiring speech directed to the American public who wants to drain the swamp.
2 | Johnny Steel | 719376668227361_719656861532675 | Looks like more FBI corruption exposed as the jail a general for giving a reporter some info on Iran deal but saying Hillary is clear ????? Hillary did 100 times worse. Now the FBI is involved in a big money deal where cash was exchanged with the clintons and their buddies and FBI members! We have no federal law enforcement. Obama and Loretta lynch actually got the FBI to become criminal ! I'm voting Trump. Our country is under attack from within. FBI is corrupt!!!!!
3 | Ernest Sordelet | 719376668227361_719610558203972 | Just watched Robert Costa talk about Trump's moves to gain ground, the problem with that is the story he was asked about concerned the rising costs of Obamacare. Anyone else ever notice that throughout history the other targets for destruction during a popular uprising, besides government offices, are the buildings and offices housing the "media"?
4 | Beatrici Keytee | 719376668227361_719394271558934 | Won't find those anchors these days on msnbc, or cnn. After the election there will be a lot of high heeled  babs, flatulent narcissists and gender questionable folks looking for work.
5 | Jimi  LaLumia | 719376668227361_719577791540582 | Can you imagine the outcry if polls showed Trump leading , and Hillary called the polls phony and rigged? Just imagine what the response friom the Re PIG LIcans would be!
6 | Rema Loeb | 719376668227361_719408841557477 | This may seem very amusing, but history is being made and almost completely ignored by MSNBC as well as other mainstream media. At Standing Rock for several months now thousands of native people and friends have been gathered to pray and protect the waters of the Cannonball and the MissouriRiver, where a pipeline is being built at least as large as the KXL. The DAPL will carry heavy Bakken oil under the Missouri River and through treaty lands at Standing Rock, through South Dakota, Nebraska,. Iowa, Illinois, then down the Mississippi to the Gulf to be shipped for enormous profit for the corporation. Iowa farmers have also protested this. Militarized police and National Guard and even sheriff's police from other states are surrounding these peaceful people at Standing Rock, arresting them, not allowing them to see lawyers, and have even arrested independent journalists such as Amy Goodman, Deis Schlosberg, etc. Why are you people not there covering this dangerous and important event? Why, in fact, are Hillary (and Gore who spoke with her today) and Trump not speaking about it?

8 | Jerome B Chlebus | 719376668227361_719477651550596 | On Saturday at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, Mr. Trump delivered a speech that promised a contract between him and the American voter.So let's take a look at it.The Republican says he will push for term limits on all congressional members.He will freeze hiring at the federal level.He will crack down on lobbying.And he will renegotiate trade deals that he feels are harming America.So far, nothing too dramaticBut then Mr. Trump upped the ante.He says he will stop funding sanctuary cities.He says he will remove two million undocumented immigrants - people he feels are dangerous - and cancel visas from countries that won't take them back.He repeated that he will suspend immigration from terror prone regions like the Middle East.In addition, Trump promises middle class families with two children a 35% tax cut.He says he will spend one trillion dollars on infrastructure over the next 10 years.He promises to repeal and replace Obamacare.He says he will build the border wall.Also, Trump says he will support Kate's Law -- mandatory five-year prison sentences for those who illegally reenter the USA with a felony conviction on their sheet.Now, most of these promises appeal to Republicans and are abhorrent to Democrats.

17 | James Graul | 719376668227361_719410888223939 | Dutch Sheets  says “One of the most devastating occurrences in America in our lifetimes, ranking up with The Supreme Court's decisions of Roe v. Wade and Engel v. Vitale (the removal of prayer from schools), was the election of Barack Obama. I gave a strong warning about what would happen to our nation if he was elected. Sadly, it has all come to pass: a continued liberalization and empowerment of the judicial system in America; a weakened economy (our national debt has doubled in seven years to $19 trillion!); further moral deterioration, along with a rebellion to and mockery of God (does anyone remember the White House lit up in the colors of the LGBT movement after marriage was redefined by the Supreme Court?If that wasn't an "in your face" to God and those of us who "cling to their God, guns and religion" by the man who mockingly said it, I don't know what could ever be!); increased violence; a weakened position in the world, along with a weakened military; the advance of radical Islamist terrorism; a setback in race relations; and more. I rejoice that our nation has been able to elect our first black president. I am deeply saddened, however, that it was Barack Obama.The damage has been so great that America is now one president away from a complete transformation to secularism, a loss of our Judeo-Christian foundation, the loss of our position as the stabilizing force for good in the earth, and the leading voice of the gospel to all the world.If elected, Hillary Clinton will be the president who finishes the job. She stands almost entirely against everything we, the church, are for, and for everything we are against. Hillary is pro-abortion, including partial-birth abortion, the most insidious evil of the last century; will raise taxes while continuing out-of-control spending; will further weaken our military; is for completely open borders; is pro-gay marriage; supports Obamacare; has no respect for our Judeo-Christian heritage; sells influence; and is a proven liar. Do not be fooled—she will completely finish what Obama started.http://www.charismanews.com/opinion/watchman-on-the-wall/60736-dutch-sheets-shares-prophetic-insight-for-church-dilemma-over-elections”

19 | Jennifer Schilling | 719376668227361_719431888221839 | Most Americans are following Donald Trump, yes he said a few bad words, but don't tell me that all men and many woman have never talked that way. Until he ran for President I had never heard one negative thing about him. He is known for his keen business sense, his charity, his clubs that are open to all people, and his remarkable family. Killary is a criminal, a pathological liar, a murderer and a proven failure for 30 years. This is a very important election, educate yourself think of the Supreme Court for one, then open borders, think about your tax money going supporting undocumented illegals. Look at the big picture and listen to Trumps plan. The establishment is desperate to keep him out, they have become a cesspool protected by their own laws. The corrupt biased media outlets like this one are liberal and controlled and manipulated. May I suggest a few outlets to the truth: FB: Dennis Michael Lynch, Lou Dobbs, Allen West, Scot Baio, Herman Cain, Dr. Ben Carson and Hannity. Look at the Wikileaks. Educate yourself and your decision will become  very clear. Americans want their country back, America needs Trump !

1 | Nikki Myles | 719371731561188_719377754893919 | I believe 80% of Hillary haters, don't have legitimate reasons to hate her and 60% of those people hate her because she's a woman. And most of them are probably other women, we can't EVER just support each other. ☹️
2 | Paul Lees | 719371731561188_719372794894415 | Hillary Clinton is promoting unity. Trump is promoting stereotypes, bigotry, and divisiveness. America is far stronger united and Trump should never represent a nation built upon equality.
3 | Christine Peters | 719371731561188_719381314893563 | I'm trying to remember who came up with this idea, but I use it frequently: in a great deal of "White America", there is, at the core, the concept of the "Totem Pole" - and each group occupies a different spot on the pole, depending on how they are viewed by society. White American Evangelicals have always believed themselves on top, naturally, as ordained by their religion and religious leaders. Below them are Catholics - tolerated, but not quite as good as they are - and below that are all other peoples; brown, black, yellow, LGBT, and everything else you can think of. At the lowest point, however, one finds the most dreaded person of all: the n***er-lover.Donald Trump has spent his entire campaign trying to bring back the concept of the Totem Pole - this is the base of his support. Whites naturally belong at the top, and everyone who points out that this is wrong is un-American.Hillary Clinton has spent her life trying to tear down the Totem Pole. She was long ago cast down to the bottom of the totem pole, and the caste at the top will never believe anything she says or does, because of her efforts to bring down the pole. For better or worse, it is my belief that THIS is the source of the hatred and lies directed against her, and it will never stop until those who believe themselves at the top of the Totem Pole are gone!!Written by Scott Grant. President Obamas election knocked that totem Dow, and the right have tried stopping him on every level, but the people know what's going on and now a women is going to win it and the far right is going crazy once again!! Get over it!!!

12 | Ed Saraiba | 719371731561188_719413828223645 | A gentleman named Bill Howell eloquently wrote the below letter.Dear Mr. Trump,It’s taken me a while to realize this and to admit it, but I’m grateful to you.For the past few months I’ve spent a good deal of time lamenting your campaign and the poison it has so effortlessly generated. I’ve watched our country imploding, our public discourse become polluted, our political climate grows ever more corrosive, and wrongly assumed you were to blame.It’s only lately I’ve come to understand that you haven’t manufactured our current national ugliness—you’ve simply revealed it.By saying the irresponsible, mean-spirited, ignorant things you say so freely and so frequently, you’ve given other like-minded people license to do the same. You’ve opened up the floodgates for our corporate sewage to flow fully. People no longer conceal their vile mess, they now revel in it, they broadcast it and retweet it.You’ve made bigotry and racism socially acceptable again and that has been a kind of twisted gift because it’s allowed me to really see people; not as they pretend to be on the surface—but in the very depths of their wounded, weaponized hearts.Over and over as your campaign has persisted, your supporters would tell me that they like you because you “speak your mind”. It wasn’t until recently that I’ve realized that you speak their minds. You’ve given credence to their prejudices and made those prejudices go mainstream.Thanks to the terrible ground you’ve broken, politicians, pastors, friends, and strangers, both in person and on social media now regularly out themselves as hateful, intolerant, and malicious—and they remind me just how close they are to me, just how deep the sickness in us runs, and just how far we have to go together.You’ve emboldened people to be open about things they used to conceal for the sake of decorum, and though it turns my stomach, I know that this is the only way we can move forward; to have that cancerous stuff exposed fully so that it can be dealt with. Our progress as a nation is predicated on authentic dialogue, no matter how brutal and disheartening that dialogue is.In other words, you’ve let us know what we’re really dealing with here and while it’s been rightly disturbing, it’s also been revelatory. That’s the thing about that kind of harsh light: you’re forced to see everything. Beauty and monstrosity equally illuminated.Now don’t get me wrong, I think you’re the least qualified, least knowledgeable Presidential candidate we may ever have had participate this far into the process, and if you somehow were elected I’d fear gravely for the world my children would inherit—should it survive your Presidency at all. I believe you’re reckless, bitter, and completely reprehensible; the very worst kind of bully.But whether you win or lose, you’ve already allowed me the blessing of Truth; about me, about you, about other candidates, about our nation.And in the process you’ve also shown me that I am not alone in resisting you and this ugly thing you’ve revealed about us.You’ve generated an equally loud, equally passionate response to it and this is where I find my hope these days.I find it in those for whom equality isn’t just a cheap buzzword, it’s the most precious of hills to die on.I find it in those people who refuse to be silent in the face of our impending shared regression.I find it in those willing to be bolder in defending the inherent value of all people.I find it in the growing army of those who will not tolerate hatred as a core American value.I find it in those who reject violence as our default response to dissension.I find it in the ever rising voice of people who will not let malice and bitterness represent them in the world.Today I find my hope in those who, like me, will not be complicit in allowing bigotry and intolerance to become a source of national pride, because we’ve seen where that leads.Yes, Mr Trump, you’ve unearthed our hidden sickness and you’ve allowed it to go viral.You brought every awful thing about us out into the open.You will NEVER Get My Vote!Copy Paste Share!

25 | Matthew S. Henderson | 719371731561188_1827756600794293 | What legit reason does Hillary Clinton have for deleting 33,000 emails AFTER congress requested them? What reason does she have to justify the fact that her staffers destroyed 13 devices with a hammer? How do you justify accepting donations from countries that degrade women? Why did the Clinton foundation steal the money that was donated to Haiti?? There are no acceptable defenses for these disgusting acts. The Clintons always have and always will be about themselves and you supporters only care that Donald Trump "said" something that hurt your feelings. This is why she is leading in the polls. People have their priorities screwed up.

1 | Jason Counter | 1331005980328984_1331008043662111 | Honestly, if Trump supporters think the election is "rigged", then maybe they just shouldn't vote anyway. I'm sick and tired of them whining about how their beloved hero, Donald Trump, is losing. Get over it, Trump supporters! If you really believe the polls are "rigged", then why are so worried? If you truly believe that he's actually going to win, then stop complaining about the polls being "rigged". And if you actually believe the election will be rigged in Hillary Clinton's favor anyway, then just don't vote. Stop whining and complaining about this election being "unfair" just because your candidate is awful.
2 | Anthony W Sanford's | 1331005980328984_1331006403662275 | Hillary is winning the election, Democrat voter's do not need to vote now. You can stay home, your vote is no longer needed. This has been a public service announcement. The Clinton campaign thanks you.
3 | Benjamin James | 1331005980328984_1331012276995021 | If Donald Trump is thinking of draining the swamp and feels this is truth. Then Donald Trump should start by pushinghimself down the drain first.”
4 | Trevor Ricci | 1331005980328984_1331007386995510 | The Trump campaign says its leading in the polls. Then they say they are behind in the polls. Then they say they are ahead in the polls.......Even a broken clock is right two times a day.
5 | Celia Contreras | 1331005980328984_1331028536993395 | Of course, it's rigged....NOT. He's a pathetic sore loser. He can't handle losing....especially to a "Nasty Women." He"s being the "little boy" that his wife called him..he needs to act like a man and man up.
6 | A.J. Pinto | 1331005980328984_1331006163662299 | Michelle Obama said if Donald Trump is elected: "We're telling our sons it's okay to humiliate women. We're telling our daughters this is how they deserve to be treated.".... that's funny. So does that mean that if Hillary Clinton is elected, we are teaching our sons & daughters that it's ok to murder, lie, cover up, be corrupt, demean women, use racial slurs, and stay with a spouse that openly rapes women & cheats on you?
7 | Beatrice Florina Florescu-Boomhower | 1331005980328984_1331023246993924 | I'm so tired of the complaints when something doesn't go their way... Faux Noise just released the Benghazi report with nothing, Nothing, NOTHING against Hillary Clinton!!! So, breathe in, breathe out, count to 10 and stop insulting, attacking, and offending those who disagree with you folks-republicans/Trump supporters. Respect each other, be nice to each other, help one another and enjoy life. Lots of love to All.
8 | Ed Saraiba | 1331005980328984_1331067473656168 | A gentleman named Bill Howell eloquently wrote the below letter.Dear Mr. Trump,It’s taken me a while to realize this and to admit it, but I’m grateful to you.For the past few months I’ve spent a good deal of time lamenting your campaign and the poison it has so effortlessly generated. I’ve watched our country imploding, our public discourse become polluted, our political climate grows ever more corrosive, and wrongly assumed you were to blame.It’s only lately I’ve come to understand that you haven’t manufactured our current national ugliness—you’ve simply revealed it.By saying the irresponsible, mean-spirited, ignorant things you say so freely and so frequently, you’ve given other like-minded people license to do the same. You’ve opened up the floodgates for our corporate sewage to flow fully. People no longer conceal their vile mess, they now revel in it, they broadcast it and retweet it.You’ve made bigotry and racism socially acceptable again and that has been a kind of twisted gift because it’s allowed me to really see people; not as they pretend to be on the surface—but in the very depths of their wounded, weaponized hearts.Over and over as your campaign has persisted, your supporters would tell me that they like you because you “speak your mind”. It wasn’t until recently that I’ve realized that you speak their minds. You’ve given credence to their prejudices and made those prejudices go mainstream.Thanks to the terrible ground you’ve broken, politicians, pastors, friends, and strangers, both in person and on social media now regularly out themselves as hateful, intolerant, and malicious—and they remind me just how close they are to me, just how deep the sickness in us runs, and just how far we have to go together.You’ve emboldened people to be open about things they used to conceal for the sake of decorum, and though it turns my stomach, I know that this is the only way we can move forward; to have that cancerous stuff exposed fully so that it can be dealt with. Our progress as a nation is predicated on authentic dialogue, no matter how brutal and disheartening that dialogue is.In other words, you’ve let us know what we’re really dealing with here and while it’s been rightly disturbing, it’s also been revelatory. That’s the thing about that kind of harsh light: you’re forced to see everything. Beauty and monstrosity equally illuminated.Now don’t get me wrong, I think you’re the least qualified, least knowledgeable Presidential candidate we may ever have had participate this far into the process, and if you somehow were elected I’d fear gravely for the world my children would inherit—should it survive your Presidency at all. I believe you’re reckless, bitter, and completely reprehensible; the very worst kind of bully.But whether you win or lose, you’ve already allowed me the blessing of Truth; about me, about you, about other candidates, about our nation.And in the process you’ve also shown me that I am not alone in resisting you and this ugly thing you’ve revealed about us.You’ve generated an equally loud, equally passionate response to it and this is where I find my hope these days.I find it in those for whom equality isn’t just a cheap buzzword, it’s the most precious of hills to die on.I find it in those people who refuse to be silent in the face of our impending shared regression.I find it in those willing to be bolder in defending the inherent value of all people.I find it in the growing army of those who will not tolerate hatred as a core American value.I find it in those who reject violence as our default response to dissension.I find it in the ever rising voice of people who will not let malice and bitterness represent them in the world.Today I find my hope in those who, like me, will not be complicit in allowing bigotry and intolerance to become a source of national pride, because we’ve seen where that leads.Yes, Mr Trump, you’ve unearthed our hidden sickness and you’ve allowed it to go viral.You brought every awful thing about us out into the open.You will NEVER Get My Vote!Copy Paste Share!
9 | Doris Pugh | 1331005980328984_1331015003661415 | Just get your people out to vote that's the main thing any candidate can do not to rely on polls .We dems maybe in the lead but we can't chance any thing now we have to vote and get others to vote also.

12 | Timothy Reents | 1331005980328984_584395028410406 | "It's one thing if both sides have valid information to share and debate, but it's quite another when one side has valid arguments and facts to back them up while the other side only has lies and misinformation. We've gotten quite comfortable with false equivalency and the blame for it falls squarely on the media. As Asimov told us long ago, There is a cult of ignorance in the United States, and there has always been. The strain of anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge." Quote from a friend of mine Jeff Ehrhart
13 | Chris Pitchford | 1331005980328984_1331013233661592 | No. If anything—as shown by turnout in Florida—this can be a landslide IF YOU VOTE #Hillary2016 #GOTV http://www.latinodecisions.com/blog/2016/10/24/latino-tracking-poll-week-6-clinton-74-trump-15/
14 | Susan Kiely | 1331005980328984_684368155052434 | "The following is a list of incumbent governors of the states and territories of the United States as well as the mayoralty of the District of Columbia. Among the states, there are 31 Republicans, 18 Democrats, and 1 independent that hold the office of governor."  If states are in charge of their own states elections, and the majority of states are governed by a republican, then Trump has been saying for weeks that all of these governors are fixing the election to favor Hillary.  Now the polls are wrong, so are they now cheating to favor him?
15 | Henry Flores | 1331005980328984_1331015883661327 | Who cares? It ain't over till' it's over! Get out and VOTE everyone!!! Let's turn this country BLUE!!!!!#VoteBlueStraightTicket #ClintonKaine2016 #ImWithThem #StrongerTogether #TexasDemocrat
16 | K Victor Smith | 1331005980328984_1331090683653847 | So, the polls were great when he was ahead and quoting the polls for 45 min of a 60 min debate! But now he is behind the polls are wrong and everything is rigged?!! Now, there were lots of never trump people ever since he started running, so if the election was rigged, he wouldn't be the nominee. But, it was probably rigged to let him win because they knew he would be the absolute worse nominee. Come on man!!!
17 | James Whitsell | 1331005980328984_1331025510327031 | According to a new Wikileaks release the Clinton campaign over sampled the demographics and fed it back into the media polls causing the results to be askew. I ask all of you Hillary supporters, how many of you on here have actually been officially polled? I can't find anyone in my world that has been. I really would like to know!
18 | Rodney Moss Sr. | 1331005980328984_1331014353661480 | Believe it is close...because many people are secret Trump votes...Many Men and believe it or not...allot of women are not ready for a woman President and will keep quite and vote for him...So we must get the Vote out
19 | Brian Kuhta | 1331005980328984_684414455047804 | It's 2012 all over again.  'Romney can't be that far behind, the polls are biased.'  Sorry republicans, no poll bias in sight-  your candidates are just that bad.
20 | John Schmidt | 1331005980328984_1331039393658976 | When the polls showed Don-the-con leading the other GOPers he bragged about it; now that the polls are showing him being trounced by a wide margin Don-the-con is denying the validity of the polls. What a loser. :-(
21 | Lizette Rivera-Santiago | 1331005980328984_584617048388204 | I remember when Trump had the lead all he could do was brag about how he knew that he was going to continue with an even huger lead. And now that he's being crushed, the Election is being rigged. So it's like Trump say's, if he win's he will accept that the Elections were never rigged & if he loses it's because the elections are rigged! Get over it Trump, your not going to win & especially you are going to lose against a woman!
22 | Peggy Berk | 1331005980328984_1331090766987172 | This is not funny! This is serious. It is part of his attempt to delegitimatize the results of the election. There's a lot of buzz about Trump not conceding if he loses. But there is worse-case scenario: What if he declares victory after he loses? What if the same supporters  who are buying into "the polls are fake,"  "everything the media says is a lie," etc. buy into the Trump speech on election night declaring victory? This would be far more dangerous than simply not conceding.
23 | Anthony Gordon | 1331005980328984_684404858382097 | Trump and his campaign is full of crap and gets worse by the day! This is nothing more than white privilege at its best. This man has said unbelievable things about our government and our democracy all while enjoying the benefits of it. He used the very system he claim is corrupt to blow a billion dollars in one year then use that to get out of paying federal taxes. He use his wealth and status to push himself on women then brag about sexually assaulting them all because he's wealthy and he's a star! He's been MARRIED three times, filed bankruptcy 4 times, ran a fraudulent school that's under investigation, speaks very unintelligent, knows nothing about foreign affairs or policies, defends Russia and won't acknowledge their involvement in trying to help him win the Presidency, and refuse to release his tax returns! Only a white man can be so ignorant, disgusting, and reckless that people could overlook those things to try and elect him President! Nothing more than white privilege that they say don't exist! GTFOOH!
24 | Johnny Steel | 1331005980328984_584616341721608 | Looks like more FBI corruption exposed as they jail a general for giving a reporter some info on Iran deal but saying Hillary is clear ????? Hillary did 100 times worse. Now the FBI is involved in a big money deal where cash was exchanged with the clintons and their buddies and FBI members! We have no federal law enforcement. Obama and Loretta lynch actually got the FBI to become criminal ! I'm voting Trump. Our country is under attack from within. FBI is corrupt!!!!!
25 | Pierre Avignon | 1331005980328984_684682315021018 | If anything we should still be very worried right now, with that climate of over confidence on the Clinton side. There is a silent minority out there, with strong knee-jerking potential, that, combined with a significant absenteeism from those who think it's a done deal or wan't vote for her or either, can put that dangerous man in the White House.

4 | Jeff Bartulla | 1545474578805900_1545492755470749 | If she wins the election it will be the shortest victory lap in history. Now she not only has to win the White House she must win both houses so she can fend off impeachment proceedings. The emails keep showing the facts of her corruption and now the proof they were not altered in any way.

6 | Temora Gray | 1545474578805900_1545517018801656 | Oh yes, Hillary has my vote. I completed early voting today in Texas. The polling place (a Library), was 95% female of color and COMPLETELY BLUE. I waited for about 1.5 hours to vote. There were about 1000 people in line. Cars were double parked and people were enthusiastic for Hillary. There was a republican guy (second generation Hispanic American) who was so disheartened about his party's standard bearer, I was able to convinced him to vote for Hillary. He, however said he would vote some republican legislators in but was voting for Hillary in honor of his mother, a strong woman he always loved. I felt really good today about Hillary turning Texas blue.  My experience  from what I've heard, is not unique around many towns/cities in Texas.
7 | Aytar Allen | 1545474578805900_1545519065468118 | Hillary will become president and then this BS will be over. So many idiotic statements from both sides but mainly Trumps side. Soon all the trumpsters will be relegated to the Breitbart type sites.
8 | Mike DiBiase | 1545474578805900_1545543878798970 | Then why are you still married to Bill. Had to  keep the money rolling into the foundation. No matter how woman were treated in those country. There is only one woman you care about that's you. The rest will be forgotten after the vote.
9 | Bill Yarbrough | 1545474578805900_1545513762135315 | Trump is the champion of women. Liberals found twelve to speak against him. I have had that many jealous girlfriends fighting over me.Trump is a man's man, a true gentleman.Women are jealous of his wife, that's the problem.President Donald Trump, that is hope and change. Rejoice and shout for joy, hope is on the way.
10 | Jay Smith | 1545474578805900_1545478648805493 | Meanwhile an avalanche of evidence emerges daily showing an unbelievable amount of corruption involving Hillary. Payoffs, bribes, voter fraud, fake and rigged polls. Trump is coarse.  Hillary is a blatant corrupt elected official.
11 | Jim Creary | 1545474578805900_1545504862136205 | LMAO Can Americans be that brainwashed to vote in the most corrupt politician in the free world. Renowned layer, not cognisant of classified info and illegality of private email server. Proven pay for play State Department ! Free pass by mainstream media, promoting her campaign. Questionable if progoganda is illegal in the US, certainly makes one wonder. Only to the loony left does building a wall to keep out illegals, guns and heroin equal Trump hates Mexicans or temp ban on Muslims equals Trump hates Muslims ( Carter sent home Iranian students and banned Shiite Muslims during the Iranian hostage crisis, the loony left and mainstream media as forgetful as Hillary it's shameful ). Only the loony left buys that bs and can't see it for what it is Propaganda!
12 | Linda Walker Anderson | 1545474578805900_1804650799814489 | I agree that the disrespect some men have for women is absolutely discussing & demeaning; however, I can't believe Hillary's group. Keeps talking about it with everything Bill Clinton has done these20-30 + years!

16 | Sandra Adkins | 1545474578805900_1545530362133655 | Hillary not qualified due to her extreme Carelessness of handling Classified Information and her Perjury!

18 | Henry H Mayo Jr. | 1545474578805900_1545483748804983 | So the media is rigged, the polls are rigged, the republicans not giving support to Trump is rigged, the moderators in debates are rigged, all newspapers endorsing Clinton are rigged, all living presidents endorsing Clinton are rigged and the American Government is rigged. Yeeah... Right. Trump really lives in his own little universe to believe this. All Trump is doing is trying to brainwash people and control what they see, hear and think. That way he only lets them see what he wants and tell them lies and they will never listen to media that points out (in Trump's own words) that he is lying.
19 | Joseph Kincheloe | 1545474578805900_1793524187555824 | America needs more "Nasty Women" like Elizabeth Warren. No Lies, like every GOP mouthpiece we're all so sick of listening to. Just honest, straightforward, common-sense Leadership. AMERICAN, as it should be.
20 | Jim Tracey Hildreth | 1545474578805900_1545570765462948 | First would you really have someone open an introduction for you by start with Donald Trump is a PIG and inappropriately touched women! When the women your introducing husband has physical RAPED multiple women and lost his license to practice law due to his RAPE charges.What's it say about his wife who sits there smiling while a speaker talks about women being assaulted knowing her husband mentally abused and Raped women without their consent. How does a women verbally assault those same victim her husband raped and keep kicking these poor ladies after what they have gone through. But no Hillary just keep tarring them apart for something they didn't do! It was Bill Clinton that Raped these innocent ladies.Trump never raped anyone or was charge for inappropriately touching anyone!History Lesson:Here in case you want a little Clinton history lesson and weren't old enough at the time and missed the fun and when Hillary began to lie.How quickly we forget! If you’re over 35, take a walk with me down memory lane—you won’t believe what you have forgotten. If you’re under 35, read on—I promise you that you will be amazed at what you missed! (By the way, sadly, this isn’t a joke. I wish it was.)REMEMBER WHEN BILL CLINTON WAS PRESIDENT?(January 20, 1993 to January 20, 2001—two terms)When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over an attempt to reform health care. Her proposed plan was so bad that many Democrats came up with competing plans of their own in protest, and in spite of threats and intimidation, on September 26, 1994, the “Hillarycare” bill was declared dead.This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million for studies, promotion, and other efforts.Then, President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general. Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood—both were forced to withdraw their names from consideration. Next, she chose Janet Reno, which husband Bill described as "my worst mistake." (Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.)Husband Bill also allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission—Lani Guanier was her selection. After considerable backlash from prominent Democratic senators concerning Ms. Guanier's radical views, Bill Clinton withdrew her name from nomination, stating that she did not represents the civil rights views that he had championed during his campaign.However, apparently a slow learner, husband Bill continued to allow Hillary to make more recommendations. She chose former law partners, Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department. Her selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kennedy was forced to resign. (Is anyone wondering yet what her Supreme Court Justice appointments would be like?)Many younger voters will have no knowledge of "Travelgate," the first major ethics controversy during Bill’s presidency.Hillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend, Harry Thompson—but the White House Travel Office refused to comply. She trumped up allegations of financial mismanagement and reported seven long-time White House employees to the FBI. This ruined their reputations, got them fired, and caused a thirty-six month investigation. Eventually, most of the employees were reinstated and Clinton associates were forced out of the travel office. Only one White House employee, Billy Dale, was charged with a crime—the enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds; a jury acquitted him in less than two hours.Still not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House Security. When Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies (Filegate) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff, suddenly Hillary and the President denied even knowing Livingstone, and of course, denied knowledge of drug use in the White House.Following this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents.Next, when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by Bill Clinton, Hillary was put in charge of the "bimbo eruption" and scandal defense. Let’s look at some of her more notable decisions in this regard . . . She urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation, they settled with Ms. Jones. She refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor. After $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr's investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs. Hillary's devious game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for 'lying under oath' to a grand jury, followed by his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives. Hillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, "I do not recall," "I have no recollection," and "I don't know" a total of 56 times while under oath. (Sound familiar?) After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had "mistakenly thought was hers."So you see, the email scandal and all of her malfeasance regarding the handling of Top Secret information, not to mention the "pay to play" schemes of the Clinton Foundation, are nothing new. Hillary’s entire political career has been nothing but a web of lies, corruption and destruction in her quest for power.Is anyone else ready to say, “Enough is enough!”?But unfortunately, I’m sure her loyal fans will say, "What difference does it make?"
21 | Sally Vance | 1545474578805900_1545541985465826 | What about guys like Bill?  Now that he will be "First Gentleman" (cough, puke, cough) he will have plenty of time to resume his dirty deeds!   HE DID WORSE THAN TRUMP in our White House and ON OUR TAX DOLLARS while his was OUR PRESIDENT and again, guess who was paying his wage, OUR TAX DOLLARS!!  Trump was just a private citizen!!!!!!!!
22 | Steve Weidert | 1545474578805900_1545483968804961 | Because you and Hillary are both nasty women, and just because Trump told the World you are, doesn't make it untrue. Shut up and get your Witch costume on, it is almost Halloween.
23 | Cher Lynn | 1545474578805900_1804912499788319 | Lmao... I may be a "deplorable redneck", but you are a "nasty" woman. As a woman, if I were running for Pres, I'd expect low punches....you, though, have plenty to be called nasty about. Suck it up buttercup- sticks & stones! #Trump2016 #CleanTheSwamp
24 | Myra Cromer Cash | 1545474578805900_1805003489779220 | This woman thought what a nasty woman right after Hillary's comments and right before Trump said it.Being a woman doesn't give you a free pass for being nasty.Hillary Clinton and Warren have both proven to be chronic liars and man bashing does not improve their images.

1 | Dale Whiting | 1330914220338160_1330921540337428 | Donald, you are an idiot! You claim that media influenced polls showing Hillary far ahead cause your supporters to stay home and Hillary' s to turn out! It's just the opposite. Your smart campaign spokes lady knows this and over the weekend admitted that you appeared to trail. That makes Hillary supporters overconfident leading some who might have to struggle to get to their polling place to stay home! YOU IDIOT! Shut your mouth!
2 | Jim Baker | 1330914220338160_1330924190337163 | This is not aTrump claim or leaked email. It came from inside the FBI.Latest unreported news is that the FBI Deputy leading the investigation into Hillary's email/national security breach is married to a Democratic candidate who received over $675,000 from Clinton's best friend. This is the most corrupt POTUS candidate and news media in American history.
3 | Veronica Henrick | 1330914220338160_1330922800337302 | Hillary Clinton is the most dangerous person to killing unborn babies EVERYDAY from Parenthood Planning by CEO: Cecile Richards) for abortion what she said on the Third Presidencies Debate. Life and Death! Does God-honoring Hillary Clinton if she is okay for woman’s right to killing unborn babies, killing babies, or selling baby’s part is that your good example to tell your family, relatives, friends, or even children? If a man who raped me and get me a pregnant or got a pregnant, I will NOT abortion my unborn or kill the baby. I can keep my baby or give out to baby for an adoption who’s mother can’t have a baby.Hillary Clinton is the most dangerous person in the USA to killing the hundred people to throw you out into the Lake Fire of Hell lasting forever without honor to God by the soul who will be wailing, burning, screaming, teeth gnashing, and painful never stop lasting forever. Disgraceful.

15 | Christina Van Merkom-Baartman | 1330914220338160_1598483737127712 | People yell that Obama divided America. But Obama didn't divide our country; their unwarranted hatred of him did. Electing him was like turning on a light in a dark room and exposing the cockroaches. Unfortunately for them, AMERICA IS DOING BETTER THAN EVER. RECORD unemployment numbers, legalized gay marriage, 5% growth, best year for jobs since 1999, consumer confidence up, deficit down 60% in 2014, gas prices low, health insurance cheaper than ever ($85/month), car insurance cheaper than ever ($25 per month from Insurance Panda), the 1% starting to be taxed more!There are a lot of people who don't like President Obama simply because he's black they just don't say it out loud. Apparently being a closet racist is the only thing they know.

He's blamed everyone from his ghost writer to the Global Financial Empire, every head of state, Media....all over the entire world, including, I suppose, Tonga.  He is disassociating.  He cannot face the fact that we won't have him anywhere near anything important in our world, for sure.  AND, not only are we cleaning his clock...he is being beaten by 'A GIRL'......  Divine Justice.
19 | David Colman | 1330914220338160_933656090072422 | If Clinton is up 12 points and Gary Johnson is at 5% that has to mean that the Democrat-preferring Gary Johnson supporters switched from Johnson to Clinton, and the swing voter group is breaking towards Clinton. Most of this difference (between this and the earlier poll) would probably be the power of the surrogates Clinton has brought out (President Obama, the First Lady, Joe Biden,  and her husband) who all have approval ratings of > 50%, whereas not only are there not any surrogates on the right that have a national profile and broad coalition of supporters and those that can help him in individual states don't want to campaign with/for him. I think the power of Clinton's surrogates is more responsible for the change in Trump's numbers since the first debate than Trump's controversies. Trump's approval ratings were so low before the first debate that I don't see how he can drop 8 points because of controversies that were already part of his public image.
20 | Joe Berghold | 1330914220338160_1330946873668228 | We go to North Dakota for an update on the ongoing Standoff at Standing Rock, where thousands of Native Americans representing more than 200 tribes from across the Americas are resisting the construction of the $3.8 billion Dakota Access pipeline, which is slated to carry oil from North Dakota’s Bakken oilfields through South Dakota, Iowa and into Illinois. On Saturday, over 100 people, who call themselves protectors, not protesters, were arrested at a peaceful march after they were confronted by police in riot gear, carrying assault rifles. They say police pepper-sprayed them and then arrested them en masse, and discharged rubber bullets to shoot down drones the water protectors were using to document the police activity.
21 | Mary Best | 1330914220338160_1330944980335084 | Donald Trump you didn't have no problem inviting the media in on a conversation, you was having with the Clinton's accusers just before the second debate. Matter of a fact when you want to use the media to your advantage, there is no problem. Now that you realize you are losing, you want the media to go away. Then you can continue to brainwashed and keep your supporters in the dark.
22 | Lisa Norvell | 1330914220338160_933791200058911 | trump shouldnt be telling his supporters hes winning if kelly anne conway said they are behind hope they bring out the national guard to handle the nut jobs that want to cause trouble when he looses by a landslide

5 | Stephen Meek | 1330874007008848_1330876453675270 | That idiot should be winning Texas by a landslide. Sorta kinda tells you what is getting ready to happen in other Republican red states in 14 days.

18 | Donald Jones | 1330874007008848_1330874580342124 | This is DEMOCRATIC..... Revelation chapter 13.....1 I looked and saw a beast coming up from the sea. This one had ten horns and seven heads, and a crown was on each of its ten horns. On each of its heads were names that were an insult to God.2 The beast that I saw had the body of a leopard, the feet of a bear, and the mouth of a lion. The dragon handed over its own power and throne and great authority to this beast.3 One of its heads seemed to have been fatally wounded, but now it was well. Everyone on earth marveled at this beast,4 and they worshiped the dragon who had given its authority to the beast. They also worshiped the beast and said, "No one is like this beast! No one can fight against it."5 The beast was allowed to brag and claim to be God, and for forty-two months it was allowed to rule.6 The beast cursed God, and it cursed the name of God. It even cursed the place where God lives, as well as everyone who lives in heaven with God.7 It was allowed to fight against God's people and defeat them. It was also given authority over the people of every tribe, nation, language, and race.8 The beast was worshiped by everyone whose name wasn't written before the time of creation in the book of the Lamb who was killed.9 If you have ears, then listen!10 If you are doomed to be captured, you will be captured. If you are doomed to be killed by a sword, you will be killed by a sword. This means that God's people must learn to endure and be faithful!11 I now saw another beast. This one came out of the ground. It had two horns like a lamb, but spoke like a dragon.12 It worked for the beast whose fatal wound had been healed. And it used all its authority to force the earth and its people to worship that beast.13 It worked mighty miracles, and while people watched, it even made fire come down from the sky.14 This second beast fooled people on earth by working miracles for the first one. Then it talked them into making an idol in the form of the beast that did not die after being wounded by a sword.15 It was allowed to put breath into the idol, so that it could speak. Everyone who refused to worship the idol of the beast was put to death.16 All people were forced to put a mark on their right hand or forehead. Whether they were powerful or weak, rich or poor, free people or slaves,17 they all had to have this mark, or else they could not buy or sell anything. This mark stood for the name of the beast and for the number of its name.18 You need wisdom to understand the number of the beast! But if you are smart enough, you can figure this out. Its number is six hundred sixty-six, and it stands for a person.

2 | Gregory Dale Holland | 1330825807013668_1330825977013651 | Trump is a man with a vision for America, not a specific vision, a great vision...the best vision...Trump has a plan to make this country great again....What plan??....a great plan...a plan that will work because it's the best plan.....Why???... because Trump knows good people...which people???....the best people....people that are not stupid like other people....people who know how to get deals done...what deals???...great deals...the biggest deals... because I know words... What words???...I have the best words... I get my information from watching TV... I consult with myself because I have a great brain... A great brain???...the best brain...Trump will also build a big wall to keep Mexicans out and he will make Mexico pay for it!...How....??? its all part of the great plan!...ISIS will be gone very, very quickly...How???... I won't tell you.. It's a secret !!!... (This guy is a “one-man circle jerk” and he is only about entertaining the uneducated who love him and his great plan. He's all air - no substance. And he is their “Champion”.)

4 | Jon Cancelino | 1330825807013668_1330830713679844 | E. Warren, us progressive voters had it with you after you failed to endorse Sanders. Trump is an afterthought to the real danger coming next year.Don't come running when your partner on the trail goes against your policy stances.
5 | Regina Heyward | 1330825807013668_1330851733677742 | The following letter addressed to Donald Trump I am sharing with you was written by a lady on another page. She asked readers to share it... feel free to do so... My open letter to Trump supporters. I know it is long but please read and take a second to think about it. The future of this country depends on it. Feel free to share! So You Want Someone To ‘Tell It Like It Is’? OK, Here You Go. 1. You join a lying machine and call Hillary crooked. But you support a man who refuses to release his tax returns. You support a greedy, self serving, manipulative proven tax cheat. You support a crooked narcissistic psychopath who is worried his tax returns would reveal evidence of financial ties to Russian oligarchs and other dictators of the world. Just like we now know Putin's puppets illegally paid millions to his crooked former campaign manager, maybe he has been getting paid too. A corrupt little man whose daughter vacations with Putin's girlfriend. Making Russia great again? A con man who funneled millions of campaign money to his own companies and used campaign money to pay his family handsomely. Using his own words, a disgusting and corrupt man who surrounds himself with a disgusting corrupt people. 2. You say you love our veterans but support a man who believes POWs are not heroes because they were captured? A man who has shown he lacks emotional intelligence when he attacked families of a fallen war hero. A man whose company fired a veteran for being deployed to Afghanistan. A man who insults and derides our generals.3. You think a soulless, heartless small man who mocked a disabled reporter will make a good president. A man whose first instinct after a tragedy is always self-aggrandizement, like after Orlando mass shooting & when Dwyane Wade's cousin Nykea Aldridge was killed. As 3,000 people were dying, this man bragged about how 9/11 attacks were good for him & bragged about how his building is now the tallest in Manhattan just hours after the attack. When the pound fell to a 30-year low following the vote to exit EU, he boasted about making money off British economic uncertainty. When the housing market collapsed in 2008 and millions of Americans lost their homes, he said “ I 'sort of hope' real estate market tanks.” Trump is always looking out for Trump. How do you believe a greedy, narcissistic man who fundamentally lacks empathy and compassion will be a good president? He is not even a good person.4. You say you're patriotic & love this country but you support a man who has so little understanding of the basic parameters of our constitution's limits & has zero respect for it, except the part he uses to incite violence. A careless small man who asked Russia to spy on our former Secretary of State. A man who trash talks our NATO allies and our president but lavishly praises brutal dictators like Saddam Hussein, Kim Jong Un, Muammar Gaddafi, Vladimir Putin...etc5. You support a small man who has been married three times and has admitted to infidelity in the past. A man who was accused of raping his wife & has a federal lawsuit accusing him of raping a 13-year-old girl during a party hosted by convicted pedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein. A man who comments about his daughters breasts and body. Then you turn around and bring up Bill Clinton's history with women? I agree with you 100% Bill has a disgraceful history with women but no comparison to Trump who has said cringeworthy, disturbing things about women his whole life. May I remind you Bill is NOT running to be the next president. If you are saying oh, candidates spouses are fair game then you can't ignore that he is married to a woman whose naked pictures are all over the internet. 6. You support a man whose business career is a very long list of bankruptcies, defaults and deceptions because he is good for our economy? A man who was born into wealth and built that wealth by scamming, stiffing and bullying ordinary working citizens of this great country. 7. Yes, Hillary is not perfect, then again no one is. You call her dishonest but support a narcissistic pathological liar? Every time Trump opens his mouth every other word that comes out is a lie. Fact checkers have proven it over and over again. We are talking about a man who makes things up to spew hate and fear, like when he lied about seeing an Iran ransom video and a video of muslims celebrating in New Jersey on 9/11. The man is incapable of telling the truth and he is delusional.8. You support a hypocritical man who hired undocumented immigrants for his real estate projects & exploited our visa program. He is a man capable of solving our immigration problem?9. I agree 100% if she's elected Hillary and her whole family must distance themselves from the Clinton foundation. Let other people continue the great work the foundation is doing. With that said, you support a man whose foundation is found guilty of a pay-to-play scam and false claims of giving on its tax forms and then turn around and try to push fabricated scandals about the Clinton foundation. The IRS found the con man used funds from his charitable foundation to make a campaign donation to Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi. Just after 4 days of the bribe payment Pam dropped Trump U case. He also held $150K fundraiser for Pam after she dropped a criminal case against his university. His foundation claimed on its tax return forms that it gave $10,000.00 to The Giving Back Fund, but the organization says that donation does not exist. A man who completely retooled his charity to spend other people’s money. A man with deep ties to global financiers, foreign politicians and criminals. 10. You claim the con man whose line of clothing and accessories are made in Bangladesh, China, Honduras and other low-wage countries is the man to fix our labor laws? You claim the man who outsources everything is the answer to creating jobs here at home?11. You claim the unfit, unstable Putin's little puppet whose campaign is fully embracing alt-right's anti-Muslim and anti-Immigrant ideologies with all their conspiracy theories is the one to unite the country?12. You support a bottom feeder who put racial discrimination in housing at the heart of his real estate developments, started the birther movement, said "Obama would look perfect on food stamps, he has the right face for it,” and has shown he is prejudice with his actions & words over and over again. Then he pretends he cares about the black communities. He brings up Hillary's reference to a group of violent repeat criminals as "super-predators" in 1996? I don't agree with her choice of words all those years ago but she has apologized since. Something Trump refuses to do. Of course you can use all kind of deflection tactics & tell yourself whatever makes you feel better but the reality is if you are supporting a racist, misogynistic, xenophobic, bigoted, unfit, unqualified, disgusting con man, you really should admit to yourself you don't care what he says or does. You are using your hatred to cloud your judgement.
6 | Wayne Pearson | 1330825807013668_1330831010346481 | I've had it with career politicians who do nothing. I've had it with politicians who get away with breaking the law, because laws don't apply to them.

8 | Sandy Becraft Barrier | 1330825807013668_1330869003676015 | I used to watch Chris Matthews and Mornings With Joe faithfully. When did your network decide to become a campaign add for Clinton? Here's a novel idea for a news network, report the news, not biased campaign rhetoric. You cost Hillary this vote. I am sure Trump appreciates it.
9 | Linda Mccarty | 1330825807013668_1330843900345192 | Just saw Kelly Anne on Steve's show. So sick of seeing that empty blank, smiling face spout stupidity. She'll back him no matter what as long as she gets big money for it. Who is really crooked? Trump is tweeting his mind away and Kelly Anne says just ignore it no one pays attention to it! God, will someone please put her somewhere, where she can not hurt herself! She is sooooooooooooooooo empty!

13 | Benjamin James | 1330825807013668_1330830453679870 | Kellyanne Conway is a true Wicked Witch, her words are a plethora of wicked spells. She trys to put people in a hypnotic state to believe in a man like Donald J. Trump, a direction that is the door way to hell.
14 | Joe Berghold | 1330825807013668_1330947343668181 | We go to North Dakota for an update on the ongoing Standoff at Standing Rock, where thousands of Native Americans representing more than 200 tribes from across the Americas are resisting the construction of the $3.8 billion Dakota Access pipeline, which is slated to carry oil from North Dakota’s Bakken oilfields through South Dakota, Iowa and into Illinois. On Saturday, over 100 people, who call themselves protectors, not protesters, were arrested at a peaceful march after they were confronted by police in riot gear, carrying assault rifles. They say police pepper-sprayed them and then arrested them en masse, and discharged rubber bullets to shoot down drones the water protectors were using to document the police activity.
15 | Janice Martin | 1330825807013668_1775230446069918 | Every woman in the United States has dealt with a Donald trump type person at school, work, on the street and socially. We are fed up! We are fed up with the 'boy talk'. We are fed up with the excuses. We are fed up with being blamed. We are fed up with being ridiculed. Any woman who is honest knows this to be true.
16 | Gerri Frederiksen | 1330825807013668_1330863277009921 | While Hillarys camp wants to continue campaigning in the swamp, I would like to know why Warren is pushing for an end to school of choice? Dont want the children in the projects (modern-day plantation) straying to far or getting an education that isnt government approved? From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs. Sound familiar?
17 | Susan Geary | 1330825807013668_1804232533125342 | These dialogues will continue whoever gets into the White House, unless Americans finally wake up and realize the Democrats and the Republicans are the problem. Both of them have screwed us for years.
18 | Mike DiBiase | 1330825807013668_1803979036484025 | It's to bad she has nothing to offer the country or she would talk about it. DNC playbook you have nothing, run down the other on anything but your record. A senator and state dep all protected never even ran a state. Has no idea how to work with fellow Americans.
19 | Joe Quinn | 1330825807013668_1775306229395673 | Elizabeth Warren  is a complete nutjob hypocritical commie whacko. Chief Lies Too Much is going down in flames. Look at her latest approval numbers. Her lies and the socialist scams of the Democratic Party are being exposed.
20 | John McCarthy | 1330825807013668_1330833753679540 | That massive fiscal and monetary stimulus alone can’t fix what ails America has been painfully demonstrated. It took 43 presidents to run up a debt of $10 trillion. Barack Obama doubled it in eight years. All we have to show for this is an anemic 1 percent growth rate.Donald Trump’s economic plan is all about rapid growth. He will cut taxes, reduce regulation, unleash our energy sector, and eliminate our growth-sapping trade deficits. This solid, Reaganesque recipe for growth and a new bull market puts Dow 25,000 within easy reach.Predictions MapSee the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. See Predictions Map →Hillary Clinton has promised to hike taxes, increase regulations, put our coal industry out of business, and throttle our oil and gas industries. She is also directly responsible for many of the bad trade deals swelling our trade deficit. Why any prudent investor would cast a ballot for this Clinton bear market agenda is an enigma wrapped in a mystery.There is a far deeper difference between Trump versus Clinton that sophisticated investors should be mindful of. Clinton’s plan Keynesian “tax and spend” stimulus strategy has been proven not to work over the last eight years. Trump focuses directly on the underlying structural imbalances our nation’s GDP equation is now saddled with.As with any nation, America’s GDP is driven by consumption, government spending, business investment and net exports (exports minus imports). From 1947 to 2001, America’s real GDP grew in at a balanced 3.5 percent per year. Since 2002, that average has fallen to 1.9 percent. This has cost millions of jobs and trillions of dollars in foregone income and tax revenues – one additional GDP point creates 1.2 million jobs.
21 | Glenda Reitz | 1330825807013668_1330834733679442 | America has a message too - we are tired of corruption and tired of everyone in American being held accountable except Mrs Clinton....wish you would use the same passion for accountability to Mrs Clinton as you did the Wells Fargo CEO
22 | Sally Vance | 1330825807013668_1775058806087082 | What about guys like Bill, who is running for the office of "First Gentleman" (cough, puke, cough)?  He will have plenty of time to resume his dirty deeds, which he did in OUR WHITE HOUSE, ON OUR TAX DOLLARS!!  Trump was just a private citizen, we didn't pay for his dirty deeds!!
23 | Arthur Villines | 1330825807013668_1330988370330745 | I don't believe all of the Liberal Lies being spread, however I do believe Judicial watch and project veritas in exposing that everything Trump has said is true about the corruption in the campaign and in the Clinton Foundation - She is truly play for pay, It's TRUMP 2016.
24 | Linda Calabrese | 1330825807013668_1804105996471329 | These two make me ashamed to be a woman...no ideas just a man bashing campaign...guaranteed in a few months Wikileaks will come out with how Hillary paid these women to come out against Trump.
25 | Nora Strunk | 1330825807013668_1330875137008735 | I find it odd that if Trump calls a woman nasty or evil, the left goes crazy. Yet Warren says nasty about a man and that's ok?  Come on , if you don't like the language, don't use it yourself

1 | Fred Stemme | 1330814647014784_1330836780345904 | This morning on Morning Joe Mica excoriated Michael Steel regarding his feelings about Donald Trump and when he had them. Michael remained a gentleman through the process. Mica said, "I may be riding my high-horse" to which Mike Barnacle agreed. I agree, too. Where does Mica get off lambasting someone about  his or her views regarding a particular candidate? Like she's the arbiter over anyone's views. She decides what you should think and when, telling people who they ought to support and when. She went way too far and owes Michael Steel an on air apology. And if you think I'm a Trump supporter, you'd be wrong. I'm a lifelong Democrat and even though I don't like it, I will vote for Hillary Clinton on Election Day.

12 | Dee Fox | 1330814647014784_1330961330333449 | It was pretty obvious that Hillary was given some kinda medication to keep her calm at the last debate. She looked glazed over. If she does have Parkinson's Disease and isn't telling the American People, then is she going to have Bill stand in for her? How will we know? I don't think they will have Kaine take over as President....he may be in the dark about it, as well. I think we should demand to see her records for the last hospital stay where she had a severe clot in her brain. She has never been truthful when it comes to records so I think she needs to come clean with her medical condition, NOW!

It didn't register Ross until my 5th attempt. I'm a GOTV activist and a voter education worker. I know how to firmly and precisely press the pad. We just recently moved to Hendersonville and there are a lot of retirees and elderly here. I doubt many would check for errors.

Placing orders in January for costumes that don't sell until October can be frightening. But this shop has some key tips on how to manage a seasonal business.

1 | Val Salatino | 1330794387016810_1330795660350016 | Omg! please take Trumpty Dumpty OFF the air. He is spewing his crap and projecting his B.S. f#king sa - lob.
2 | Victor Kaulius | 1330794387016810_1331528170276765 | Halloween - stupidest celebration ever, What happened to " just a free candy day for the kids"? Media has hyped it up to be way more than what it should be.
3 | Ginger Spelts | 1330794387016810_1330796767016572 | I think it is wrong for the media to be calling an election two weeks before the election. That could discourage voters from voting if they think the election is already over and that is just wrong no matter what side you are on. That is not democracy.
4 | Denise Ledford Geneos | 1330794387016810_1330802160349366 | WASHINGTON – When sources told the media that the decision not to prosecute Hillary Clinton for mishandling classified information “was a top-down decision,” one person closely involved in the investigation explained, “Loretta Lynch simply wants to stay on as Attorney General under Clinton, so there is no way she would indict.”That was despite the fact that, of the more than 100 FBI agents and analysts who worked with six attorneys from the DOJ’s (Justice Department) National Security Division, Counter Espionage Section to investigate the case, according to the source, “No trial level attorney agreed, no agent working the case agreed, with the decision not to prosecute.”Read more at http://www.wnd.com/2016/10/hillary-isnt-the-only-one-lynch-wont-prosecute/#i77mYzQZSDgQt3qB.99
5 | Keith Johnson | 1330794387016810_1330992780330304 | That is nice. But how about doing some reporting now? I knew about Chinese, Russian, or North Korean state run media. But I had no clue there was such a thing in America. By the media outlets helping with the cover up of the widespread corruption and collusion to protect Hillary Clinton uncovered by WikiLeaks, ALL the media networks combined are behaving like another State run media. I hope America sees it and remembers it on November 8.

It didn't register Ross until my 5th attempt. I'm a GOTV activist and a voter education worker. I know how to firmly and precisely press the pad. We just recently moved to Hendersonville and there are a lot of retirees and elderly here. I doubt many would check for errors.

Mitt Romney won the Lone Star State by 16 points back in 2012.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Elle Hartz | 1330729180356664_1330730930356489 | I think it's hilarious that TX and AZ are turning blue. What can I say, don't piss off voting Mexicans, Pendejo.
2 | Jobie Lyne Christy | 1330729180356664_1330735670356015 | Trump's whole campaign is a lie. It started with a lie."By self-funding my campaign, I am not controlled by my donors, special interests or lobbyists. I am only working for the people of the U.S.!"“I don’t need anybody’s money,” Donald Trump boasted in June during his rambling presidential announcement. “I’m using my own money. I’m not using the lobbyists. I’m not using donors. I don’t care. I’m really rich.”
3 | Emily Van Heukelom | 1330729180356664_1330756610353921 | So sad that people are stupid enough to vote for this creature. He is not going to help you. He has done nothing as a businessman to bring jobs back to the us or to support local businesses. He has been for himself and only himself since his beginnings.
4 | Patti Webb | 1330729180356664_1330733877022861 | Come on Texans..you guys are smart enough to see through the orange haze!
5 | Jen Morton | 1330729180356664_1330803280349254 | Early voting started in TEXAS today. My mother has already gone and had to wait 40 minutes, which we've NEVER had to do. I hope that means Clinton supporters are out in droves. We will soon see...
6 | Aaron Potier | 1330729180356664_1330747940354788 | Texas is purple now.  No turning back. I don't care if Texas goes blue. I just want it relevant and in play every election. Now to remove the Governor,  Lt. Governor,  and take back the legislature.
7 | Julane Quick | 1330729180356664_1330772333685682 | C'mon Texas voters. Be part of history. Vote for the most experienced, most prepared candidate for the job who just happens to be a woman. She has a reputation for working with other political parties or countries. Vote proud.VOTE HILLARY.
8 | Martin Zdravkov | 1330729180356664_1330748787021370 | Texas for Hillary Trumps lost that state and bushs are leaning Clinton it's a demographically favored for democratic nominee who is running against djt
9 | Laura Canavan | 1330729180356664_1330753793687536 | For the reports about "early voting in PA": Please note: Pennsylvania — There is no early voting in Pennsylvania, as voters need a state-approved excuse to vote absentee.So I am not sure WHAT you are reporting, please check your facts.
10 | Andrew Teal | 1330729180356664_1330795090350073 | The Cubs and Indians are in the World Series, Donald Trump is the GOP Presidential nominee, there has been record flooding and heat waves across the country, and Texas is a toss up in the general election. 2016 is the weirdest year I've ever seen.
11 | Rodney Moss Sr. | 1330729180356664_1330763503686565 | I don't think Texas will turn Blue.....But Boy an I enjoying hearing these rednecks complaining....about the liberal media spreading lies....
12 | Carlos E. Villafane Cruz | 1330729180356664_1330788773684038 | My hope, and my prayer, is that when the time comes to be in the voting booth, the majority of those Conservatives that say they are voting for Trump will have either a religious epiphany or critical thinking moment and realize that everything Trump has said and done makes him a danger to our Nation.And to those independents, specially the ones that wanted Bernie instead of Hillary, honor Bernie's request and vote for Hillary.If you truly believed in Bernie's message you should, without hesitation follow his directive.I am for Bernie and I believe he knows what he is saying.November 8th, 2016VOTE BLUE.it's the only way to stop these treasonous, DO NOTHING CONGRESS.The time to move progressively forward is here.
13 | Brenda Stancombe | 1330729180356664_1330803337015915 | I can't understand why the reporters talk over Hillary's rally but let this arrogant Russian loving liar talk completely uninterrupted. I am so sick of hearing him and his blatant lies.. It's so obvious he is with Putin and all he stands for..OMG we are so screwed if he gets in office..
14 | John Moore | 1330729180356664_1330764817019767 | Texas sure has it's rolling fields of corruption with that Republican party running their state. Their education system is a shamble and they are having daily crisis with their CPS (Children Family Services) their AG Paxton is due to face fraud charges, that he keeps postponing, they worry more about who can use a bathroom than doing something about cleaning their polluted air, but let's not forget the biggest yet..Their Governor was AG and running for Gov. and he threw out the TRUMP UNIV FRAUD case and recvd a campaign donation of $35,000 from Trump, his first and only donation EVER made to Texas. OHHH and they continue to waste their tax payer dollars on suing the dang Government. VOTE BLUE TEXAS!
15 | Dustin Neal | 1330729180356664_1330831343679781 | Bill Marhar admitted that Trump supporters median income was $78,000 a year and Hillary supporters median income was $40,000 a year.. clearly there is no question that the hard working smart people are voting for Trump..
16 | Denise Barbadoro | 1330729180356664_1330802953682620 | Wikileaks just proved hilary used bogus polls to keep Sanders voters away on election day, she is doing the same thing here.  No one falls for the rigged polls but Hilary voters who will, obviously, fall for anything.
17 | Maggie Ann McNutt Patterson | 1330729180356664_1330925250337057 | Come on Texas!!! Let's show the world just how great America IS!!! I do not care what the Polls are reporting.... Folks,,, Trump is inventing a consiracy theory of a ,,, "rigged election",,,,!! This is no way to make "America Great Again"!! It underminds the the very fundamental principles of our precious democracy!!! Get Out and Vote Blue to demolish any question Trump is acceptable or a credable consideration for our president!!! Let's show the World just how great America is by voting enthusiastically and in mass for our country's honor and decency!!! Clinton/Kaine 2016 and Blue down ticket!!! ENOUGH is ENOUGH!!!!!
18 | Matt Schiemer | 1330729180356664_1330778220351760 | Let's turn Texas blue!!  Man would that piss some people off.  I'll be doing my part here in Austin in about an hour... early voting starts today :)
19 | Brian Neil | 1330729180356664_1330739753688940 | Sampling indicates 57 percent democrats and 38 percent republicans leaving 15% independents so this poll is meaningless and as much propagandist fallacy as the candiate herself
20 | Kenny Benjamin | 1330729180356664_1330758890353693 | Why did you take off Hillary Clinton and U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren when they were speaking today?? The one time they could be heard and you take it off and talk about Trump.This is on all channels and your to blame if he gets in.If Trump was speaking you would air the whole speech. DISAPPOINTED MSNBC
21 | Heather Ammons | 1330729180356664_1133101883462218 | Perhaps you should report the TX legislature voted to reduce number of early voting locations in an effort to discourage voters. Read some stood in line an hour & a half in SAN Antonio. Isn't this violating Constitution & deliberate effort to suppress votes?
22 | Richard Parker | 1330729180356664_1330780263684889 | The only poll that matters is the election day poll. I can't wait to see the media and these leftist propaganda pollsters wiping egg off they're faces. America knows what they're doing. They're using the polls to influence this election because Hillary is losing Big League. Here in the real world Trump is winning even in so-called blue states
23 | Tom Jacobi | 1330729180356664_1207858825942634 | Well lets face it, a Trump would never have gotten where he is now pre 2008. Our leadership in Washington just needs to take a good look at themselves to understand why a Trump is as "popular" as he is.
24 | Catherine Hennessey Martinez | 1330729180356664_1330794997016749 | I would like to have heard Elizabeth's and Hillary's whole speech, not you ignorant reporters and talking heads interrupting. You never interrupt Donald Trump's s,peaches.
25 | George Rozell | 1330729180356664_1330924300337152 | I went today(Houston) it was like nothing I have ever seen..The pollster that worked there said he's been working sense 1996 and he has NEVER seen this many ppl ..and the women out numbered men 2 to 1 and statistically when it's a huge turnout dems win ..yea!!!..Bye bye..RED STATE!!

Is Donald J. Trump planning to launch his own TV network if he loses the election?
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Chris Monck | 1330687230360859_1330690470360535 | I saw a woman yesterday jumping out of her car to plant Trump signs. She was blocking traffic, but didn't care. Worst of all, she was driving a Honda! Make America great again by driving a Japanese car. LOL!!
2 | CJ Mehus | 1330687230360859_1330693610360221 | He's doing this on purpose! Donald doesn't want to be president, he's doing everything he can to lose, he's insulting and embarrassing you (his supporters)! You were ridiculous enough to go along with him and he wants out- back to his jet, golf courses and club houses where he'll never see any of you again. And when he "loses" he's going to throw a pretend "rigged" trumpertantrum to make it look like he's not a quitter or loser. All while he sits laughing, eating his lobster. Then he's going to ask his supporters to make HIM more money by watching the TV network he's starting (end game all along) #usespeopletogetwhathewants
3 | Clemen FisherMan | 1330687230360859_1330694690360113 | I can guess easily that it won't be named Trump Tv as most of 'his hotels' are going to replace TRUMP by SCION. The big surprise Will be, after being launched, how many days before filling bankruptcy? Tic Tac...
4 | Cathy Morris Burrows | 1330687230360859_1330707293692186 | Very cool. Trump supporters can stay in their homes, huddle in front of their televisions, watch their "savior, while throwing things and cursing, thankfully, avoiding the rest of society. A definite WIN/WIN!
5 | Curtis Benelli | 1330687230360859_1330706930358889 | I can only imagine Trump TV....probably something just as insane as Infowars, Blaze and Sarah Palin TV all wrapped into one big bag of crazy.
6 | Celia Contreras | 1330687230360859_1330731737023075 | TV station survival is based on revenue...no company in their right mind would advertise on this station. And the "little people" who support him, don't have the money to continue to donate. And..Ivanka's clothing line revenue is going down a trump hotel bookings are also down...
7 | Buzz Bussard | 1330687230360859_1330710957025153 | now, that would corrupt the media.... I always consider the source when listening to ANYTHING.... and when I need a really good laugh, I listen to hannidy or limbaugh... they are both practicing up for the "idiot of the month contest"... trump would only make a third contestant
8 | Nancy Cunningham | 1330687230360859_1330724480357134 | Never watching that or buying any product. He will be in court on the 28 for his crooked university, that ripped off soooo many people. By the way, release your tax returns!
9 | Larry Burgan | 1330687230360859_1330703230359259 | Well DUH, who didn't see that happening...He stated he could run for President and be the only 1 to make money because of that...Go ahead silly people and buy his products (where are they made?) and put money into the pocket of the guy that made a fool of you!!!...Life is good!!!
10 | Raymond Towler | 1330687230360859_1330693010360281 | Yes, he can make millions taking on Fox News. He's got roger Allies working on his campaign and he's got Breitbart working on the campaign as well. Alex Jones and Sean Hannity will jump to a Trump network and they will have all the Hillary haters to watch the next 4 years
11 | Mary Williams | 1330687230360859_1330895273673388 | Let me take a guess as to what commercials will be on this Trump network: Viagra, Cialis, medical malpractice attorneys, monster truck shows, gun shows, reverse mortgage lenders, ……and more Viagra.
12 | Paul Wentink | 1330687230360859_1330714833691432 | Why are we listening to an idiot Trump supporter instead of Elizabeth Warren? SHAME ON YOU HALLIE JACKSON! I don't care what Trump people think, especially at the expense of hearing Elizabeth Warren speak. Bad move. Turning YOU OFF!
13 | Michael Colbourne | 1330687230360859_1330754153687500 | Trump TV was the whole reason he ran in the first place. Publicity. He didn't plan on the RNC to be actually dumb enough to nominate him. When he realized it might actually happen it was too late. He had to commit at that point. He doesn't want to be president and never did.
14 | Carol Allen | 1330687230360859_1331073436988905 | I predict he will file bankruptcy AGAIN, Melania will divorce him, and after he dies, one of his children will write a best seller describing him as the worst father in the world!!!
15 | Chris Nighman | 1330687230360859_1330809057015343 | This was probably his plan "A" all along! Build up your political faction into an audience, with no real intention of winning.
16 | Bubba Wilson | 1330687230360859_1331150006981248 | Of course he is. This has all been his preamble. The irony of it is, he'll be targeting Fox viewers. Hannity has spent an awful lot of time on the casting couch and so has Rudy. Christie will be a little detained in all likelihood but the Trombies will be an easy audience.
17 | JM Connor | 1330687230360859_1331051953657720 | He's been working pretty hard not to get elected and this is his exit strategy.. how would he serve in office if he owned a tv network.. exactly.. he wouldn't.. and this deal has been in the works so.. i guess he's been punking the world.He owes millions, his hotels are failing and his family name is coming off of buildings all over the world.. his family depends on him for everything  5 kids, 3 wives, butlers and lawyers to pay and ex girlfriends to sue.. he's a busy guy..
18 | Al Snook | 1330687230360859_1330972216999027 | Wouldn't be at all surprised. A great surprise would be if anyone is dumb enough to put real money in it.On the other hand, ISIS & Putin would probably throw big amounts at it.The inevitable financial disaster could be a big help in our efforts against adversaries.
19 | Brad Robey | 1330687230360859_1331647250264857 | If,, lol you mean when he loses... Donald trump wants to have sex with his own daughter and you all want him to be your leader lmao MURICA FOR INCEST TRUMP 2016
20 | Jerry Boen | 1330687230360859_1331270150302567 | FEEL FREE TO SHARE  ......   Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton answer the question: OK Donald your first ..........What is 2+2?"I have to say a lot of people have been asking this question. No, really. A lot of people come up to me and they ask me. They say, "What's 2+2"? And I tell them look, we know what 2+2 is. We've had almost eight years of the worst kind of math you can imagine. Oh my god, I can't believe it. Addition and subtraction of the 1s the 2s and the 3s. Its terrible. Its just terrible. Look, if you want to know what 2+2 is, do you want to know what 2+2 is? I'll tell you.First of all the number 2, by the way I love the number 2. It's probably my favorite number, no it is my favorite number. You know what, it's probably more like the number two but with a lot of zeros behind it. A lot. If I'm being honest, I mean, if I'm being honest. I like a lot of zeros. Except for Marco Rubio, now he's a zero that I don't like. Though, I probably shouldn't say that. He's a nice guy but he's like, "10101000101", on and on, like that. He's like a computer! You know what I mean? He's like a computer. I don't know. I mean, you know. So, we have all these numbers and we can add them and subtract them and add them. TIMES them even. Did you know that? We can times them OR divide them, they don't tell you that, and I'll tell you, no one is better at the order of operations than me. You wouldn't believe it. That I can tell you. So, we're gonna be the best on 2+2, believe me. OK? Alright. Thank you." ......  Thank you Mr Trump, now same question Mrs Clinton ... “4”.
21 | James Carol Dodson | 1330687230360859_1330767670352815 | Can you imagine the kind of audience his network would attract?  It would be like Fox News on steroids. Donald has already proven that he and Roger Ailes are much alike when it comes to dealing with women. I guess about the only difference is that Trump has never had a Television Network.
22 | Robert Conroy | 1330687230360859_1331483736947875 | This guy must be wanting to lose every penny he's got. This is a multiple bankrupt business man who even lost a casino and now he wants a tv station? He better hope it does better than his presidential run
23 | Chris Thacker | 1330687230360859_1330711570358425 | Its the only reason he ran in the first place, when he loses he will cut and run from the republican party like it never existed.
24 | Glen More | 1330687230360859_1330812677014981 | What a diversion by the media...Hillary does a bus tour. Has her ground game and media cronies set everything up (hall rentals / notifying voters / etc). Soooo...how many supporters showed up?? Unknown...but U could shoot a cannon thru the place and not hit anyone. Sooo…the media keeps these smoke screens going to cover for the poor Hillary showings.
25 | Dennis Turnage | 1330687230360859_1330795923683323 | Remember when the news outlets had real reporters and not just news readers? You should not call yourselves journalist...itsd an insult to anyone with just half a brain.

A new national poll shows Donald J. Trump entering the last two weeks of the campaign in a steep deficit.

1 | Bonnie Campos | 1330631250366457_1330632930366289 | November 8 the racist white's of the United States  will learn they have been outnumbered for quite some time......
2 | Kimberly Harvish | 1330631250366457_1330636870365895 | Polls range from Hillary being 12 points ahead to Donald being 1 point ahead. There's no sure thing - get out and VOTE.
3 | Eric Estey | 1330631250366457_1330649180364664 | It's funny to see Dems so happy that a despicable pathological liar like Hillary Clinton is leading the charge for their party...lol...is that the person who truly represents who you are as a party? Have any of you ever watched The Clinton files? Read Clinton cash? She is a disgusting candidate, just as Donald Trump is. This election cycles choice of candidates is a national disgrace.
4 | Eileen Carter | 1330631250366457_1330653167030932 | The polls are FAKE LIKE HER! Just like the fake protesters she paid for to incite riots that ended up getting one person shot and numerous people hurt.There's video and paperwork to prove it.She does not care and she is not genuine.
5 | John Steinbach | 1330631250366457_1330642217032027 | Still get out to #VoteBlue all the way through the ballot.  Many States have early voting, take advantage of this so you don't have to stand in long lines come Nov. 8th.
6 | Jason Johnson | 1330631250366457_1330651583697757 | Whenever you guys talk about the wikileaks you let your guests just blame the russians and then you all move on. That's not journalism. And everyone that watches msnbc should be outraged. Just because it makes clinton look bad doesn't mean it should be buried. We should want our voters to have all the facts on both candidates.
7 | Rich Byrnes | 1330631250366457_1330668913696024 | In Texas there is a town called New Braunfels where there is a large German-speaking population.One day, a local rancher driving down a country road noticed a man using his hand to drink water from the rancher's stock pond. The rancher rolled down the window and shouted: "Hallo! Nicht das Wasser trinken. Die Kühe haben geschissen darin." Which means: "Hey! Don't drink the water. The cows have been crapping in it." The man shouted back: "I'm from New York and just down here campaigning for Hillary. I can't understand you. Please speak in English."The rancher replied: "Use both hands."
8 | Beverly A. Class | 1330631250366457_1330648917031357 | . And then, we have a candidate who thinks it is wise to tweet about our military operations. "The attack on Mosul is turning out to be a total disaster. We gave them months of notice. U.S. is looking so dumb. VOTE TRUMP and WIN AGAIN!Ã¢Â�Â� Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 23, 2016
9 | Alicia Delacruz | 1330631250366457_1330638167032432 | The US is NOT JUST GOP...this is the same rhetoric the GOP spewed the last 2 elections and they lost! It baffles me on how the GOP is so one dimensional in a very real diverse,and multidimensional society. I appreciate the US political system when you have a majority population of people of color and immigrants; then alienate them and still expect to win when it did not work the last 2 elections, and furthermore, in the very diverse America, the GOP has dug itself so deeply into a corner with its exclusive rhetoric, I don't see it recovering because what the people think is normal - is not. The Hispanic population is a large group, with Asian following and collectively they outnumber white conservative Americans, that's just a statistical fact and I am not even including all the other groups Trump has alienated. The US Census has already stated come 2020, white Americans will be the minority, so I get the fear, but how the GOP is going about it..is typical and yet so very flawed. Trump will not win and he has managed to upset the established GOP. The DNC has registered to vote; more Hispanic, Asians, African Americans, Indians, Immigrant Americans, and due to Bernie, more Democrats has also registered to vote more than ever. Bernie Sanders was able to galvanize the Millennials- who by the way is larger and more diverse than the Baby Boomers. #nevertrump #Iamwithher
10 | Dennis Sherrard | 1330631250366457_1330688590360723 | This is not over. For those like me who are supporting Ms. Clinton, don't get complacent.  Stay vigilant, get people registered, take them to the polls, and for goodness sake don't assume she has this won.
11 | Max Korn | 1330631250366457_1330686500360932 | We live in a country where if you have a Donald J. Trump sticker, your car could be burned. If you wear a Trump hat, you could be physically attacked. Campaign headquarters are being firebombed. Innocent people are being attacked by paid thugs, that are hired to specifically incite violence. Is that the America you want your children to live in?
12 | Jacquelyn Gilmartin | 1330631250366457_1330672910362291 | There is no denying who will win this race, however, this has opened my eyes to just how many bigots are in this country. In this day and age, our country STILL battles with racism, sexism, etc and it's disgusting. #DumpTrump
13 | Floyd Steele | 1330631250366457_1330684447027804 | Everyone must vote!  Vote!! VOTE!!!We have a very good chance to end grid lock in Congress, appoint supreme court justices, improve Obama Care, get prison reform, get guns off our streets, rebuild our cities and towns and grow jobs rebuilding the infrastructure throughout America, get a minimum wage increase, and above all, kick republicans out of office that refuse to do their jobs!
14 | Frankie Pagano | 1330631250366457_1858007194485453 | I guess MSNBC will now be jumping on the Hillary bandwagon after giving Donald Trump and his surrogates 24-7 coverage for the last eight months and repeating all of their lies and Hillary bashing as well. If I were Hillary I would tell MSNBC to take a walk!
15 | Carmen Kozlowski | 1330631250366457_542664639258055 | November 8th, the hate will be over and we'll have Donald J. Trump as President. He'll  rebuild our values and our education again. Hillary's campaing is just insults,read the liberal posts, it's very sad....:(
16 | Billy Flynn | 1330631250366457_1858052331147606 | To think, there is a man running for president that is actually looking to help the impoverished parts of our country, to create an inflow of money, to create jobs for people that are looking, to cut taxes for working people and small business owners, to enforce the immigration laws in our country, to stand up for our LEO and our Military.   It is incomprehensible that there are people out there that need this help more than anyone else, and they are voting for Hillary.  Trump is not a racist, there are no grounds for that. Trump is not a rapist as there is no proof.  Trump is not wrapped in scandal like we see Clinton!   The choice is clear.  The uneducated stifle their own future.
17 | Dar Sebelius Klitzka | 1330631250366457_1858019197817586 | Hubby and I voted early here in LasVegas and voted BLUE for every dem on the ballot. Time to put in dems who want to work for us instead of obstruct and recess rather than do their job. The GOP created the commie monster who took over their party so it's time they lose their jobs in this democracy where the people still have a voice.
18 | Christen Schellinger Rodriguez | 1330631250366457_1858018531150986 | The electoral map is all that matters.."big beautiful polls" and "yuuuuge rallies" mean nothing. Get out and #VoteBlue The fact is #NeverTrump will NEVER turn a single blue state and the "likely" are leaning her way. There are traditional red states  in play like Arizona?!?! Texas?!? Utah?!?! Georgia?!?! That haven't been blue in a long time. Her path is clear victory, his is very narrow and looking more like a HRC  #landslide every day. That's not "rigged" that's math. 😊😂😂😂
19 | Jacqueline Benjamin | 1330631250366457_1330656033697312 | Trulyhope you Americans go out and vote blue. Be very careful, read and reread your ballot especially after voting, any irregularities please report it. Good luck and make the rest of the world proud of you by electing your first woman President instead of a man who acknowledges publicily that he molest women.
20 | Ann Kimoto | 1330631250366457_1330683940361188 | It's time to vote for someone who is most qualified, even temper, and most importantly, for the people of this great nation. Vote blue all the way.
21 | Bama Clara | 1330631250366457_542677975923388 | If you are a supporter of the Bernie Sanders movement then you better hope Hillary Clinton doesn't become President which would destroy the movement. If Trump wins then Hillary Clinton goes away and leaves a real good chance that the next Democratic Presidential candidate in 4 years can come from the Bernie Sanders movement. If Clinton wins then the next 8 years she would be in control of the Democratics Party and you can say good bye to the Bernie Sanders movement.
22 | Bruce Brewer | 1330631250366457_1285344581496038 | Newsweek says it's a tie at 41%-41% nationally. This poll means nothing other than to discourage Trump voters to not even bother voting, as MSNBC says it's over anyways. AKA part of the rigging used first against Bernie and now Trump.
23 | Jim Ash | 1330631250366457_1285292554834574 | Other polls show trump a head or tied. Unless it's done by a liberal site like msnbc. Then the crook leads. Heck even the LA times poll has them tied. Msnbc is on the clinton payroll no doubt according to wikileak e-mails. Corruption is every where in the media and DC.
24 | Kat Moser | 1330631250366457_1285297244834105 | I highly doubt that.. this is b.s. Hillary is a racist. Why do you think she's for abortions, mainly to abort black babies in the inner cities. . She's a murderer, her husband is a rapist. . This whole election is sic..
25 | Lorrie Cutright Eden | 1330631250366457_1285341614829668 | http://occupydemocrats.com/2016/10/24/trump-allegedly-tied-13-year-old-girl-raped-struck-face/None of the television networks have reported on this. CNN, MSNBC has not reported on this. You would think two dates would be all over the news. November 28, Trump University's hearing, and December 16, the hearing of trump being accused of raping a 13 year old girl.  Check it for yourself!

5 | Michael Marki | 1330566543706261_1330591040370478 | Why is it that when Trump was trash taking other candidates in the primary, media said he was not acting presidential. Now Obama is out there trash talking Trump and media says he's a great campaigner. Double standard?
6 | Jim Campeau | 1330566543706261_1330612987034950 | Obama is a crybaby...he's got no room to talk about anyone else on that issue.

The hatred and intolerance of the left created Trump..blame yourselves for creating the monster.
7 | Cheryl Marlene | 1330566543706261_1330577877038461 | Trump surrogates, including Kellyanne Goebbels, continually cite the amount of signs that they see in the states and neighborhoods that show support for trump as reason to believe that the excitement is on their side.. It is important to note that due to the violent nature and the questionable sanity of trump supporters, Clinton supporters are afraid that they (trump supporters) will commit acts of violence and vandalism on their family and property. I live in a red, uh pink state, where guns are carried as often as pencils and I am afraid that one of these crazy deplorables will hurt me or destroy my property.
8 | John Kelly | 1330566543706261_1330653943697521 | This election year makes me feel the way I do when I am on a carnival ride that is making me sick. I just want it  to be over with already. This election year is the 21st-century equivalent to Sputnik. Sputnik was the first satellite to be launched and launched by the USSR. It was a wake up call and it made Americans question whether their education system and if our capabilities at fallen way behind. This election is making me feel the same way. America has gone stupid and it needs to get un-stupid FAST. Hillary's first task is president is to figure out how to get half the country to start using their brains again.

14 | John McCarthy | 1330566543706261_1330835073679408 | That massive fiscal and monetary stimulus alone can’t fix what ails America has been painfully demonstrated. It took 43 presidents to run up a debt of $10 trillion. Barack Obama doubled it in eight years. All we have to show for this is an anemic 1 percent growth rate.Donald Trump’s economic plan is all about rapid growth. He will cut taxes, reduce regulation, unleash our energy sector, and eliminate our growth-sapping trade deficits. This solid, Reaganesque recipe for growth and a new bull market puts Dow 25,000 within easy reach.Predictions MapSee the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. See Predictions Map →Hillary Clinton has promised to hike taxes, increase regulations, put our coal industry out of business, and throttle our oil and gas industries. She is also directly responsible for many of the bad trade deals swelling our trade deficit. Why any prudent investor would cast a ballot for this Clinton bear market agenda is an enigma wrapped in a mystery.There is a far deeper difference between Trump versus Clinton that sophisticated investors should be mindful of. Clinton’s plan Keynesian “tax and spend” stimulus strategy has been proven not to work over the last eight years. Trump focuses directly on the underlying structural imbalances our nation’s GDP equation is now saddled with.As with any nation, America’s GDP is driven by consumption, government spending, business investment and net exports (exports minus imports). From 1947 to 2001, America’s real GDP grew in at a balanced 3.5 percent per year. Since 2002, that average has fallen to 1.9 percent. This has cost millions of jobs and trillions of dollars in foregone income and tax revenues – one additional GDP point creates 1.2 million jobs.

Invest more on BIG Government jobs with a diverse US citizen work force instead of BIG businesses with a homogenous or foreign work force because big business has collapsed our economy twice now.  1928/29 and 2008/09  and three strikes and you're OUT!2.  Invest more on Science and technology instead of bankers and financial advisors because their ponzy scheme are fraudulent and they have proven to be a bunch of CROOKS!3.  Invest more on Main Street instead of Wall Street because they end up causing people to be homeless and become TOO BIG TO FAIL! 4.  Invest more on Teachers and professors instead of Directors and Executives because  they get paid way too much and when they do a bad job they receive a GOLDEN PARACHUTE!5.  Invest more on infrastructure instead of mega vacation homes for the rich because it's not doing anything for the society and they can go to a fancy resort hotel and it's a home that they only live in for a week or two and then remains EMPTY!6.  Invest more on Schools instead of mega prisons because they are targeting blacks and are taking boys that raise a little hell and turning them into men that become angry MONSTERS!7.  Invest more on Social services instead of Foundations because they are just a way of recycling wealthy money and creating a fake TAX EXEMPTION BUCKET!8.  Invest more on Military instead of private mercenaries and contractors because they instigate prolonging wars and they cost outrageously TOO MUCH!9.  Invest more on Green energy instead of oil dependency because it's causing climate change and they are causing senseless WARS!10. Invest more on citizens instead of Super Pack and lobbyist because we need a government for the people instead of being a government for the ROYALIST!11.  Invest more on Healthcare instead of private insurances because they cost too much and they do not encourage people to live HEALTY LIVES!12.  Invest more on PBS & CSPAN instead of privatization of TV news because the rating war has caused them to become too tabloid like, reality show like, combative controversial like.  It would help if the political pundit were required to have at least a masters degree in order to have a stimulating intellectual point/counter point discussions; thus, avoiding HATEFUL DIVISION!#Im_With_Her !........................................

1 | Mark Rooks | 1330515857044663_1330520033710912 | The Democrats are corraling Trump into excepting the election results no matter the amount of voter fraud ..Of course we all remember how gracefuly Al Gore accepted the results ..all the way to the supreme court ..And we all know how accepting the democrats  in california were with election results ..when voters voted to end welfare for illegals  .. after whining the courts reversed the will of the voters . And same with gay marriage democrats were not happy with the election results ..democrats went to the court for a reversal of the will of the voter .. very accepting ..So should the democrats be  lecturing Trump about accepting the election results.. when they fight every election that does not go their way ..

Changing polling locations. An election official can make this call just days before an election.2. Changing polling hours or eliminating early voting days. This may be particularly problematic in urban counties where long polling lines are most likely, as Henry Grabar reported last fall.3. Reducing the number of polling places. This raises the same problem as above, particularly when the eliminated polling places had disproportionately served minority communities.4. At-large elections. At-large elections for school-board members or city councils often dilute the voting power of minorities who have greater influence in single-candidate district elections. In an at-large election, a cohesive voting block with 51 percent of the vote can elect 100 percent of the officials.5. Packing majority-minority districts. Election maps drawn to push all of a community's minorities in one or a handful of districts can dilute their voting power.6. Dividing minority districts. Similarly, election maps can slice minority communities into multiple districts so that they have no cumulative influence in any one place. The line between these two tactics is a fine one (and also illustrates why the VRA was useful for assessing facts on the ground).7. Voter ID laws: This increasingly popular tactic, sometimes likened to a modern-day poll tax, has the potential to disenfranchise voters who don't have a driver's license, or who don't have the money or ability to obtain one (a disproportionate share of these people are minorities). Such laws can also have a disproportionate impact in cities, where many people don't own cars.8. Onerous candidate qualifications. In 2007, a Texas provision tried to limit those people eligible to become water district supervisors to landowners who were registered to vote.9. Changing multi-lingual voter assistance. Making it harder for non-English language speakers to vote is a good way to dilute their power.10. Changing election dates. Another trick that may not require legislative approval.11. Creating new elections. In 2006, the DOJ objected to a plan in the Houston area that would have eliminated some joint elections and required voters to travel to multiple polling places.12. Canceling elections. We're not even really sure how Kilmichael, Mississippi, thought they could get away with this.
3 | Kenneth Mitchell | 1330515857044663_1330570320372550 | If you're against this buyout. Tell me who appears to be more opposed to it, Trump or Clinton? Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump decried the merger before it was even official, announcing at a campaign rally in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania Saturday afternoon that it would “destroy democracy.” His campaign later issued a statement, steeped in early Twentieth century populist rhetoric, promising that a Trump administration would “break up” and “prevent” such economic consolidation in the future.Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s running mate, Tim Kaine, echoed the sentiment on Sunday, saying on NBC News’ Meet the Press that he was “pro-competition” and that “less concentration… is generally helpful, especially in the media.” Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon also evinced skepticism about the deal, telling reporters that “marketplace competition is a good and healthy thing for consumers.”
4 | Adam Modelski | 1330515857044663_1330806997015549 | This is not consolidation it is vertical integration.  They are forward looking and they feel that this move will allow them to execute new technologies more quickly.  That remains to be seen.  The car manufacturers pretty much got out of the parts business.  So it's a gamble.

10 | John McCarthy | 1330515857044663_1330801193682796 | "The Five Things Hillary Clinton Wants You to forget in 2016"Here are just a few! It's a great article."1. Her unsuccessful record as Secretary of State.Well, there actually isn’t any “record” for Hillary to run on—unless you count international tragedies like the Benghazi attacks in 2012. In that case, Hillary Clinton definitely has a record. But it’s a pretty terrible one.2. The Secret Email ServerThe secret server is big deal because as one of the highest ranking government officials in the nation, Hillary Clinton may have had information stored on that server that hackers and enemies of the U.S. would want to steal, and such information would be very easy to obtain because Clinton’s private email simply wasn’t held to the same security standards as government ones. One cyber-security expert called it ‘Total amateur hour’. Shots fired. We already know that the server was hacked twice from a computer in Serbia. The FBI is still probing to figure out of the secret server compromised national security.3. The Clinton FoundationWe don’t know much about Hillary Clinton’s foundation, but that’s probably the way Hillary wants it. The Clintons’ charity is famous for being overly secretive about who donates and how much money they give, even after Clinton promised to disclose all foreign donations to the foundation when she took office as Secretary of State.The foundation hasn’t even come close to doing so.We understand why Clinton would make such a promise. After all, wouldn’t it be a conflict of interest for the Secretary of State to accept donations to her own charity that may intersect with U.S. foreign policy? It would be, but that didn’t seem to deter Hillary at all. The Clinton Foundation has failed to disclose a staggering 1,100 foreign donations. It seems that Hillary Clinton isn’t too concerned about transparency (see #2).The foreign donations aren’t the only shady thing about the Clinton Foundation. Have you heard of Sidney Blumenthal? He is the Clinton BFF that the Obama administration refused to let Hillary hire into the State Department. So Hillary, being Hillary, just hired Blumenthal to the Clinton Foundation where he advised Clinton on State Department matters anyway, including issues pertaining to Benghazi. Hillary Clinton just can’t take no for an answer.Hillary has been in politics for a long, long time, and she’s been making bad choices since Day 1. From the Whitewater scandal to her questionable speaking fees, Hillary Clinton just seem to stay out of scrutiny. Yet in 2016, she’s running for president again."-Independent Journal Review

1 | Ken Odil | 1330481793714736_1330489607047288 | Trump's nomination was due to the fact that many in our society have trouble distinguishing reality from what they see on TV. Donald sure looked great on The Apprentice but apparently a lot of people don't realize that is entertainment and is scripted and edited. Put Donald in the real world all of a sudden the don't look so good. Should it be any surprise that Trumps core supporters are people who live in the faux reality of the Right Wing Echodrome? The low information individual who gets all their information from right wing radio and Fox "News."
2 | Showie A. Ford | 1330481793714736_1330495427046706 | The reason is because Americans are so so so scared of ISIS. Americans are terrified of Muslims. Trump painted the world as terrifying, and then said he could fix it. In reality, Trump will probably allow just as many refugees in as Clinton. Trump will probably not deport anyone. Trump will probably continue to send our men and women to die in wars we have no business fighting. But he sure talked a big game. And THAT is why he won the nomination. As he says, "if you say something enough times, it becomes a fact"
3 | Kevin D. Johnson | 1330481793714736_1330515037044745 | This election is historic. The first woman president. A resounding defeat of fascism. A landslide wave of democrats retaking the senate and house. The dissolution of the Republican Party.
4 | Kevin Lynch | 1330481793714736_1330496620379920 | Hue is an idiot. Americans already have tried checks and balances and it is shown that the REPUBLICANS ARE NOTHING BUT OBSTRUCTIONIST.
5 | Dixy Forster | 1330481793714736_1330493490380233 | The establishment in Washington thought Trump would give her a walk away victory, but what happened is, the only man on the planet who could defeat and expose the corruption that is Washington's gravy train for career politicians is going to be our next president! Hahaha!  Suckers!
6 | Jacquie Jones | 1330481793714736_1330488797047369 | No.It is their personal selfish choices. Their basic civic inability to govern. Lack of respect for all voters including their own.
7 | Steve Lynn | 1330481793714736_1330486767047572 | Republicans love Trump. He has the true views of the Republican party and is willing to say what republicans say behind closed doors. Trump is a hero and the Senators and Congressmen are behind Trump 100%.
8 | Daniel Craig | 1330481793714736_1330589500370632 | One reason left out is that Trump, being a complete political amateur and not prone to take advice from "washington elites," completely ignored the Median Voter Theorem. Primary elections are won by appealing to the extreme tail of a party's base; those are the ones who actually show up in a primary. The general election, however, is won by capturing as many of the moderate voters as possible, who reside in the middle of the electoral bell curve. Therefore, the skillful politician (not using this as a pejorative, as is the latest fashion), treads the careful line of appealing to the partisan base in the primary, while not alienating the larger group of moderates, who will be needed in the general. Trump, being the personification of the Dunning Kruger effect as applied to politics, dove deep into his base with many old partisan chestnuts that simply don't play well with the majority of Americans. By turning up the jingoistic rhetoric, turning the racial dogwhistle into a bullhorn, and offering a simplistic, albeit woefully flawed, solution to every complex problem America faces; Trump has earned the zealous support of his populist base. In doing so he has won the primary, but by making a laughably weak effort to pivot to the moderate center he alienated in that primary, he has crippled his chances at victory in the general election.
9 | James Mcgrew | 1330481793714736_1330508873712028 | REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST THIS WEEKEND SAID "Trump is the guy who showed up at his wedding with a stripper and was convinced all would be fine"
10 | Misty Hill | 1330481793714736_1330524677043781 | The ONLY way Hillary could win is by signing up dead people to vote and rigging the machines. America is done with the lies she's being telling for 30 years. America wants honesty and protection and a growing economy. She hasn't and can not lead, not that she ever would be the actual leader since the the Democratic Party would be running their own agendas and she would just be their puppet. You think you are fighting for Hillary but you are actually fighting for a corrupt elite of rich and power driven men who want a one world government. They are not to be trusted and if you could see past your eye lids you'd know that. We can play dumb and continue on this run away train or we can use Nov 8th to stop this sabotaging of "we the people". Politicians are lying to you and you have to stop giving them the power, by believing them.
11 | Jimmy Rockford | 1330481793714736_1330492407047008 | Because smart Americans are sick of watching corrupt politicians on both sides of the fence destroy their country. See, thats being non-partisan folks. Try it for once and save your failing country.
12 | Jackie Reeves | 1330481793714736_1330543617041887 | Trump is out there all day every day speaking to crowds yet he never ever mentions those Republicans fighting so hard for their Congressional seats, why isn't he helping them out like Clinton and her staff are the Democrats that are running.  Seems like he only cares about himself but if he doesn't get a Republican Congress he is not going to get things done
13 | Sha Leighann | 1330481793714736_1330505923712323 | What has happened to the Republican Party? The party of Lincoln. My grandfathers party, who believed in conservative values, smaller government and a government for the people.What happened to the party that valued women, bragged about Christian values and protecting the constitution? My grandfathers party, who always scream and pound their fists to protect their 2nd amendment rights but want the 19th Amendment (an amendment for voting rights for all, that people have given their lives for in our lifetime) repealed. What happened to respecting our military and our vets? To protect their rights at all costs. A party now that disgraces gold star families, calls our generals disasters, and praises Putin for his leadership.The answer is actually simple. What has happened is that those like my grandfather have bailed on the party that they no longer recognize. What's left are the crazy evangelicals, the KKK ultra-right, and a sexist, bigoted hateful group of individuals who only want to see this country ripped apart. And it started with the likes of Gingrich, Bush Jr and Cheney and muted into what we have now which are the Obstructionists types like McConnell, Cruz and Rubio.  These individuals who back these crazy notions because they have put party over family, morals and the people they are supposed to be representing. They brought religion into politics. They tout family values then go against everything the Bible teaches. So even after everything you've heard and seen these last few months, if you still support "this party" now, then yes, you get grouped into the racist, sexist, bigoted category. Because if you say you don't care who is representing the top of your party, you only care about the ideals the party represents, well then that kind of says it all.......
14 | Jeanne Ruf | 1330481793714736_1330851567011092 | The RNC is a party for rich white men. They've left the rest of us out. They haven't sought out what America is becoming which is more people of color. They've left the middle and lower class and it's all about the upper class. I see the Democrats heading in that direction too. Where do you think Hillary is getting all of her money.?  They promise the middle and lower classes and work for the upper classes. America, we need to pay very close attention because they are the elites and have forgotten us.
15 | Gisele Desrochers | 1330481793714736_1331235113639404 | Dear Mr Trump, Friends of mine keep thinking that any day now your going to announce that it was all a joke and that you really tricked us all. You'd then say that you've been a democrat all your life and decided to help Hillary win the election by getting the nomination and showing the ugly side of humanity by being the most foul person you can muster, going as far as just short of saying the N word. Then you'd admonish all those that flocked to you for even considering a candidate so unworthy like yourself. I can't help thinking about that scenario....Think about it, wouldn't that be epic? It would be the biggest plot twist ever, it would make you a legend and be the biggest boost to your brand ever! I think you should go for it.
16 | John Kelly | 1330481793714736_1330641090365473 | Republicans tend to be a news junkie's and The news tends to be negative especially Foxnews which is designed to make them feel that way. Alt-right media is designed to cash in on fear and paranoia. Everyone from Rush Limbaugh to Ron Paul are scaring the crap out of conservatives so that they can sell gold and other things that survivalist buy. Then along comes Donald Trump, the best spokesman Breitbart and the rest ever had. Stupid Donald doesn't realize he's being used. The results will leave Donald Trump in Financial ruin because all they wanted was to boost their brand and get a nationally known spokesman. Steve Bannon doesn't want to help trump win, it's obvious. Bannon is in this for himself and stupid Donald doesn't realize that or if he does it's, too late. Unfortunately smart Republicans have nowhere to go with this except down with the rest of their party. How many moderate Republicans are going to become a Democrat once I realize Hillary is a centrist?
17 | Martin Zehr | 1330481793714736_1330881787008070 | No, I do not accept this campaign as a legitimate election due to the manipulation of the primaries, the active disinformation campaign of the media, the intrusion of a CIA agent in states, the debate schedules, the 24/7 promotion of non-stories  and unproven allegations, the effort to allege without proof a candidate as a conscious agent of a foreign power, and the fraudulent and spurious smear campaign unprecedented in American history.
18 | Johnny Steel | 1330481793714736_1331550936941155 | Corrupt politicians! Our government is all corrupt and needs to be redone. Democrats, republicans are all crooks. Clintons scandals and pay to play are everyday news. A criminal can't be president. Only choice is Trump! He may be loud, but he is not a corrupt politician lining his pockets selling his office like Hillary has done ! If only 1% of all the crimes levied against Hillary are true , she's a felon and unfit. And you know she's unclean. No way everything is not true! And the latest about FBI receiving cash ! Our whole system is corrupt
19 | Mark Rooks | 1330481793714736_1330520087044240 | The Democrats are corraling Trump into excepting the election results no matter the amount of voter fraud ..Of course we all remember how gracefuly Al Gore accepted the results ..all the way to the supreme court ..And we all know how accepting the democrats  in california were with election results ..when voters voted to end welfare for illegals  .. after whining the courts reversed the will of the voters . And same with gay marriage democrats were not happy with the election results ..democrats went to the court for a reversal of the will of the voter .. very accepting ..So should the democrats be  lecturing Trump about accepting the election results.. when they fight every election that does not go their way ..

21 | JF Tash | 1330481793714736_1331103750319207 | Republicans decided after Obama won to disrespect the office of the president b/c a black American is running the real America. The American that is greedy, racist,sexist and takers. No way would the slave would become the master. Republicans allowed all and any hate to try to destroy America's hope but they destroyed themselves when they allowed hate to take over the Republican party. That's how the Republican party got Trump.
22 | Jerome B Chlebus | 1330481793714736_1331192646976984 | On Saturday at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, Mr. Trump delivered a speech that promised a contract between him and the American voter.So let's take a look at it.The Republican says he will push for term limits on all congressional members.He will freeze hiring at the federal level.He will crack down on lobbying.And he will renegotiate trade deals that he feels are harming America.So far, nothing too dramaticBut then Mr. Trump upped the ante.He says he will stop funding sanctuary cities.He says he will remove two million undocumented immigrants - people he feels are dangerous - and cancel visas from countries that won't take them back.He repeated that he will suspend immigration from terror prone regions like the Middle East.In addition, Trump promises middle class families with two children a 35% tax cut.He says he will spend one trillion dollars on infrastructure over the next 10 years.He promises to repeal and replace Obamacare.He says he will build the border wall.Also, Trump says he will support Kate's Law -- mandatory five-year prison sentences for those who illegally reenter the USA with a felony conviction on their sheet.Now, most of these promises appeal to Republicans and are abhorrent to Democrats.

She is dishonest. She is corrupt. She is self-serving. She is disingenuous. She blatantly lies. She abuses her power and influence. Hillary is OBAMA.• Trump is an outsider• Trump is not a politician• Trump is a “huge” threat to those in power who want to keep the status quo• Trump is a fighter and a bold leader• Trump is a patriot who loves this country• Trump is an American who puts we the people first

Did you know that control over the internet was recently transferred to the U.N, did you know that the UN is not subject to our constitution and can violate our 1st amendment rights. Do you see the problem? even when you take out the election and the trump/hillary hate, the wikileaks oncover a level of collusion between the political and media establishment to craft public opinion and determine outcomes. We better wake up

Every tax every Health and safety law. Every homeless person every mentally ill person. Every extreme religious group. The Tea Party. Donald Trump. Privately owned jails and privatizing of our public schools. The loss of the middle class. We are all at fault. Each and every one. We are responsible for allowing the elite and religious to drive the division and hate. We the people of the USA caused the issues at hand. We need to fix it. Not some politician or a religious leader. We the people need to stop being sheep and think for ourselves and fix this elitist religious caused issue.

6 | Janice Archer Weaver | 1330453490384233_1330546227041626 | The same party who portrays our election system as pure as the driven snow, is the same party who before the sun rose the day after the 2000 election had 200 lawyers in 4 targeted counties in FL!
7 | John McCarthy | 1330453490384233_1330800857016163 | "The Five Things Hillary Clinton Wants You to forget in 2016"Here are just a few! It's a great article."1. Her unsuccessful record as Secretary of State.Well, there actually isn’t any “record” for Hillary to run on—unless you count international tragedies like the Benghazi attacks in 2012. In that case, Hillary Clinton definitely has a record. But it’s a pretty terrible one.2. The Secret Email ServerThe secret server is big deal because as one of the highest ranking government officials in the nation, Hillary Clinton may have had information stored on that server that hackers and enemies of the U.S. would want to steal, and such information would be very easy to obtain because Clinton’s private email simply wasn’t held to the same security standards as government ones. One cyber-security expert called it ‘Total amateur hour’. Shots fired. We already know that the server was hacked twice from a computer in Serbia. The FBI is still probing to figure out of the secret server compromised national security.3. The Clinton FoundationWe don’t know much about Hillary Clinton’s foundation, but that’s probably the way Hillary wants it. The Clintons’ charity is famous for being overly secretive about who donates and how much money they give, even after Clinton promised to disclose all foreign donations to the foundation when she took office as Secretary of State.The foundation hasn’t even come close to doing so.We understand why Clinton would make such a promise. After all, wouldn’t it be a conflict of interest for the Secretary of State to accept donations to her own charity that may intersect with U.S. foreign policy? It would be, but that didn’t seem to deter Hillary at all. The Clinton Foundation has failed to disclose a staggering 1,100 foreign donations. It seems that Hillary Clinton isn’t too concerned about transparency (see #2).The foreign donations aren’t the only shady thing about the Clinton Foundation. Have you heard of Sidney Blumenthal? He is the Clinton BFF that the Obama administration refused to let Hillary hire into the State Department. So Hillary, being Hillary, just hired Blumenthal to the Clinton Foundation where he advised Clinton on State Department matters anyway, including issues pertaining to Benghazi. Hillary Clinton just can’t take no for an answer.Hillary has been in politics for a long, long time, and she’s been making bad choices since Day 1. From the Whitewater scandal to her questionable speaking fees, Hillary Clinton just seem to stay out of scrutiny. Yet in 2016, she’s running for president again."-Independent Journal Review

11 | Sarah Wilder | 1330453490384233_1330649607031288 | Most likely the NSA working with the UN to test the "Kill Switch" when they steal the election for hillary.
