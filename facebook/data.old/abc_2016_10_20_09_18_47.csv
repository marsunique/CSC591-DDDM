2 | Jeannie Marie Davis | 10154919780128812_10154919801448812 | I believe a guy was just killed in one of his , so called, car that can drive themselves!
3 | Sandy Miller | 10154919780128812_10154919794103812 | Suppose that every day, ten men go out for a beer and the bill for all ten comes to $100.If they paid their bill the way we pay our taxes, it would go something like this:The first four men (the poorest) would pay nothing.The fifth would pay $1.00The sixth would pay $3.00The seventh would pay $7.00The eighth would pay $12.00The ninth would pay $18.00The tenth man (the richest) would pay $59.00So that’s what they decided to do. The men drank in the bar every day and seemed quite happy with arrangement, until one day, the owner threw them a curve.“Since you are all such good customers, he said, I’m going to reduce the cost of your daily beer by $20.00.“Drinks for the ten men now cost just $80.00The group still wanted to pay their bill the way we pay our taxes so the first four men were unaffected. They would still drink for free. But what about the other six men – the paying customers? How could they divide the $ 20 windfall so that everyone would get their “fair share?” They realized that $ 20.00 divided by six is $3.33. But if they subtracted that from everybody’s share, then the fifth man and the sixth man would each end up being paid to drink his beer. So, the bar owner suggested that it would be fair to reduce each man’s bill by roughly the same amount, and he proceeded to work out the amounts each should pay!And so:The fifth man like the first four, now paid nothing ( 100% savings).The sixth now paid $2 instead of $3 (33% savings).The seventh now pay $5 instead of $7 (28% savings).The eighth now paid $9 instead of 12 (25% savings).The ninth now paid 14 instead of 18 (22% savings).The tenth now paid $49 instead of $59 (16% savings).Each of the six was better off than before! And the first four continued to drink for free.But once outside the restaurant, the men began to compare their savings.“I only got a dollar out of the $20“ declared the sixth man. He pointed to the tenth man, “but he got $10!”“Yeah, that’s right, shouted the seventh man. “why should he get $10 back when I got only two? The wealthy get all the breaks!”“Wait a minute,” yelled the first four men in union. “ We didn’t get anything at all. The system exploits the poor!”The nine men surrounded the tenth and beat him up.The next night the tenth man didn’t show up for drinks, so the nine sat down and had beers without him. But when it came time to pay the bill, they discovered something important.They didn’t have enough money between all of them for even half of the bill!And that, boys and girls, journalists and college professors, is how our tax system works.The people who pay the highest taxes get the most benefit from a tax reduction. Tax them too much, attack them for being wealthy, and they just may not show up anymore. In fact, they might start drinking overseas where the atmosphere is somewhat friendlier.

The man who died suffered a fatal "cardiac episode" while running from scaffolding falling from the Miami high-rise, authorities say. Five others were injured by falling debris.

Texas youth football team that drew attention after 14 out of 19 players decided to take a knee during national anthem has ended its season early amid tension among coaches and parents.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | John Hurley | 10154919535238812_10154919542828812 | A grown up problem effecting children...These kids should be enjoying their childhood. The coach failed them by not teaching discipline and respect instead of using them for an adult problem.Kids don't know racism until adults push it on them.Now their season is over...
2 | Lena St. Julian | 10154919535238812_10154919552393812 | Football is supposed to be about the children, not about the coach spreading his hostile propaganda. Shame on him for using the kids to get himself in the news.
3 | Bo Pagliei | 10154919535238812_10154919550138812 | It's a shame these kids have no Idea what they are kneeling for . Great Job Coaches
4 | Anita Brownson | 10154919535238812_10154919678258812 | If one of my kids was on that team, they might do that one time, but I guarantee they wouldn't do it the second time. I'd go out on that field, and as my father used to say, " Jerk a knot in their shirt tail.."
5 | Jesse Bishop | 10154919535238812_10154919608358812 | Absolutely they have the right to kneel. But what hey aren't teaching the kids is that for every action there is a reaction. And reaction is that they no longer have a team. And I bet the coach never told them that this could happen. It's sucks for the kids. They don't deserve it
6 | Ryan Beers | 10154919535238812_10154919624583812 | Here's my deal. I think it's funny that everyone is all bent out of shape over this. Granted it wouldn't be my way to protest but at least it's peaceful. Instead burning down cities, blocking highways, and killing people. I don't see it as disrespectful to the country. I think it shows pride in its own way. At least some people want to change this country for the better instead of blindly following the authority figures and trusting them to simply improve it. As for this particular instance if these kids made their own decision to kneel I'm ok with it. If the coach manipulated this then he should be fired.
7 | Paul Cadovius | 10154919535238812_10154919658723812 | This group of 11 and 12 year olds are very impressionable and want to do good and be in good favor with the coach. These kids do what the coach says to do on the field to please him not knowing why they are doing it
8 | Beverly McAdams | 10154919535238812_10154919744808812 | It is a shame that kids 11 and 12 years olds are being taught racism and hate for our country and Police Officers by Adults that should be teaching them sportsman like conduct and team playing. I would withdraw my child if he was playing in this team.
9 | Gretta Michellé | 10154919535238812_10154919581773812 | What has this taught these young men? In my opinion a negative lesson ... that their voice doesn't matter, that they have to follow the status quo, that they aren't capable of being leaders ...I guess for many the first amendment only works if it is working for you - so keeping fighting for EQUALITY young men, the very thing you are fighting for, you have been denied.
10 | Ricky Taylor | 10154919535238812_10154919543278812 | This is not the way to start raising our young to be defiant. And they'll wonder why they grew up to be criminals.
11 | Scott Hutchins | 10154919535238812_10154919752523812 | Want to get the kids involved, great, organize a car wash, bake sale etc and let the proceeds help the kids that can't afford basic necessities in THEIR neighborhood.  Kneeling does NOTHING to help, they have good equipment, fields to play on, where did that money come from?  Have them sacrifice THEIR privileges for others who are oppressed, or so called.
12 | Sandra Borel Blanchard | 10154919535238812_10154919564813812 | Good, if you cannot teach children to respect the flag of their country you should not be coaching them!!
13 | Crystal Lee | 10154919535238812_10154919664338812 | They brought the issues to the field, they can deal with the consequences....bottom line, we dont care what you believe but as team, you should act as such
14 | Cathy Goorman DePorter | 10154919535238812_10154919799823812 | Freedom speech is the cornerstone of our Constitution. If the kids have full understanding of the issue, then their individual right to kneel. If forced by coach, he can kneel, but don't force the kids. This is Texas justice, their philosophy, our way or else.
15 | Jules Gilbert | 10154919535238812_10154919831173812 | Can we not just let the kids be kids and enjoy their childhood while they have one still, and let them play and learn football, without laying the weight of the adult world on their tiny shoulders, or using/directing them to be our theatrics or voices in political and social movements and agendas? Because bottom line, as you can clearly see depicted here in the consequences, THEY are the ones who will ultimately suffer the consequences and pay for the adults' choices, actions, and "coaching" of them.
16 | Jeannie Gliniany Comer | 10154919535238812_10154919805103812 | Ridiculous!  Where, but in America, do people have the freedom & rights that we have? It's not perfect. No doubt that positive changes continue to be needed. Many of those who protest make millions of dollars which probably wouldn't happen if they lived elsewhere. So a celebrity football player who has benefited tremendously in this country decides to make a statement by being disrespectful to America, others chose to follow in a puppet manner. Perhaps your protest could be better made by getting out there and help by being part of a positive change in your community!
17 | Doug Lambert | 10154919535238812_10154919592893812 | Lena---exercising First Amendment rights is hardly "hostile propaganda." But the kids should have the freedom to express THEIR opinions, not be forced to convey the coaches' feelings.
18 | Caitlin Baxter | 10154919535238812_10154919738833812 | Congratulations fuckers Your actions have caused 19 adolescents to lose their ability to play a sport they love I hope you're happy shitheads
19 | Matthew Smith | 10154919535238812_10154919649078812 | Way to go Coach. Their childhood is secondary to your political persuasions, what do the kids matter when we gots us a protest to do eh? Sorry kids, this is what happens when you take an adult action, consequences, good and the bad. In hindsight it may actually be a great life lesson for some who are smart.
20 | Jon Laye | 10154919535238812_10154919691368812 | Maybe the 49rs will be next. NFL TV viewership is way down, the league and teams are already scrambling to try to find a solution.
21 | Eboni Johnson | 10154919535238812_10154919832018812 | If I felt they did this of their own volition then fine, they'd be expressing their feelings.  When adults put these things in the heads of children it is a shame.  I wouldn't have been pleased.
22 | Roger Dehaven | 10154919535238812_10154919701463812 | Good the kid's should NOT be able to kneel!! If they choose to kneel 14 out of 19 of them just cancel the season and not have football. It's very disrespectful!!
23 | George Rocha | 10154919535238812_10154919767433812 | Ungrateful kids , they have no idea of how many People died defending the colors of the American flag ..National Anthem is what represents Freedom in the USA , trying to follow. Loser and Mediocre idol lije Kaepernick will take you nowhere. ..
24 | Darlene Savoie | 10154919535238812_10154919728863812 | W H Y ,and where the hell do they come from,very ungrateful kid's BUT most of all any one who put them up to this is a disgrace......
25 | Brian Waddington | 10154919535238812_10154919842543812 | this disgusting act of racism is why the issue of racism is still going to be prevalent in 25 years. It is about education and this act of defiance will only continue to spiral in the wrong direction!

California attorney general launches criminal investigation into whether Wells Fargo employees committed false impersonation and identity theft as part of accounts scandal.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Nathan Ungar | 10154919482048812_10154919493103812 | So now go after the mid level employees being forced into this tactic.  It's a culture at WF.  It doesn't just happen overnight - this has been happening through out WF from coast to coast not isolated in one particular office.Start fresh and re train and get rid of all the pressure and unreachable goals
2 | Daniel Villa | 10154919482048812_10154919743668812 | Good because someone has to due the time for the crime. If it was you or me, forget it they would have raided my house and no doubt would have shot at least two of my dogs(which are very gentle animals by the way) and would have trampled all my plants in my yard.
3 | Xander Cage | 10154919482048812_10154919793373812 | Take em all to jail. It's identity theft/fraud plain and simple... is it different because they're in a cushy bank? They had access to personal information and they should have known it was wrong, anyone knows it has lasting effects on credit reports as well as being just wrong. They should have quit or raised a flag.
4 | John McAuliffe | 10154919482048812_10154919484968812 | If they donate the rest of their holdings to the Clinton campaign, they they may not have to pay any tax
5 | Richard Main | 10154919482048812_10154919766423812 | good, go after specific people and not just attack the entire business with nothing credible or no one accountable
6 | Vreyene Kirbee | 10154919482048812_10154919493588812 | Hahaha criminal nman lahat ng bangko e, sila lang ang nahuli

8 | Paul Streiber | 10154919482048812_10154919689853812 | The Clintons should give back every dollar they got from these crooks!

The Greater Depression is coming get ready .Pass on a financial genius for a crook, and its 100% we go into  a Depression. When we look back and think we picked her bc hes a narcisist and we bought her crap I know u will feel like fools.
22 | Joan L Nieto | 10154919482048812_10154919552263812 | What do you think?? Should women own their bodies???I think prostitution should be legalized in all countries for the sake of women owning their own bodies and choosing whether they want to sell it or not. This should help with more rights and not be so taboo. There would also be a lot less prostitution with ubi (universal basic income) then women could choose whether they really want to do that job or not and not because they just need money to survive. UBI would reduce prostitution. This way people have choices. People should not be controlled as slaves or as prostitutes and all people should have pure negotiating power in the world.

16 | Joan L Nieto | 10154919410863812_10154919553503812 | What do you think?? Should women own their bodies???I think prostitution should be legalized in all countries for the sake of women owning their own bodies and choosing whether they want to sell it or not. This should help with more rights and not be so taboo. There would also be a lot less prostitution with ubi (universal basic income) then women could choose whether they really want to do that job or not and not because they just need money to survive. UBI would reduce prostitution. This way people have choices. People should not be controlled as slaves or as prostitutes and all people should have pure negotiating power in the world. See links for ubi belowU Basic income vids https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Okx60F3eHpohttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UqESogRgrYwU Basic income facebkhttps://m.facebook.com/profile.php?id=378087157960&tsid=0.06808198608852534&source=typeaheadhttps://m.facebook.com/profile.php?id=192450520792683&tsid=0.901639997153383&source=typeahead

Mother of Florida boy born with spina bifida, which impairs development of the spinal cord, hopes photo of him standing for the American flag will help spread awareness about the spinal disorder.

1 | Sheena Triplett | 10154919359183812_10154919466878812 | Him and other people taking a knee has nothing to do with each other...I'm sure he isn't feeling oppressed because of the color of his skin...some people are so ignorant smh
2 | Amanda Joseph | 10154919359183812_10154919376863812 | As a mother of a child with Spina Bifida please do your research!! Prenantal Vitamins are not the Answer to everything. It's a multifactoral cause. Children of Vietnam Veterans that have Spina Bifida have special care in place just for them! I wish there was more awareness in regards to SB as October is Spina Bifida Awareness Month!!
3 | Vicki Mainard | 10154919359183812_10154919411298812 | I have ton of respect for Arek. If a kid in wheelchair can stand when the flag is going [past anyone can. He every excuse not to and he chooses to stand. Well done young man.
4 | Tina Fontaine | 10154919359183812_10154919426233812 | If this cutie can stand, so can everyone else and if you live in the USA, you should wanna stand for our flag and National anthem!!!
5 | Lynnsie Goad | 10154919359183812_10154919490198812 | At least he can prove he's more of the star football players, while they knee for the flag this young boy holds himself up for the respect of his country. That's what a real man looks like. God bless you
6 | Mark Thomas | 10154919359183812_10154919510633812 | Comparing this kids condition to the protest against systemic injustices against minorities in America is dismissive to the protest and disrespectful to this brave young man. There is a difference between having a physical disability that makes it difficult to "stand" for the national anthem and suffering systemic disenfranchisement which makes you not want to stand during the national anthem. Don't confuse or compare the two!
7 | Paul Palmer | 10154919359183812_10154919735183812 | The American Flag is Folded 13 Times...The first fold of our flag is a symbol of life.The second fold is a symbol of our belief in eternal life.The third fold is made in honor and remembrance of the veterans departing our ranks who gave a portion of their lives for the defense of our country to attain peace throughout the world.The fourth fold represents our weaker nature, for as American citizens trusting in God, it is to Him we turn in times of peace as well as in time of war for His divine guidance.The fifth fold is a tribute to our country, for in the words of Stephen Decatur, "Our Country, in dealing with other countries, may she always be right; but it is still our country, right or wrong."The sixth fold is for where our hearts lie. It is with our heart that we pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States Of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with Liberty and Justice for all.The seventh fold is a tribute to our Armed Forces, for it is through the Armed Forces that we protect our country and our flag against all her enemies, whether they be found within or without the boundaries of our republic.The eighth fold is a tribute to the one who entered into the valley of the shadow of death, that we might see the light of day, and to honor mother, for whom it flies on Mother's Day.The ninth fold is a tribute to womanhood; for it has been through their faith, their love, loyalty and devotion that the character of the men and women who have made this country great has been molded.The tenth fold is a tribute to the father, for he, too, has given his sons and daughters for the defense of our country since they were first born.The eleventh fold, in the eyes of a Hebrew citizen represents the lower portion of the seal of King David and King Solomon, and glorifies in their eyes, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.The twelfth fold, in the eyes of a Christian citizen, represents an emblem of eternity and glorifies, in their eyes, God the Father, the Son, and Holy Spirit.With the final fold the flag is completely folded, the stars are uppermost reminding us of our nation's motto, "In God We Trust."
8 | David Aguilar | 10154919359183812_10154919748553812 | It is truly sad that a lot if people did not understand what the article was about. My son has Spina bifida and can only walk using braces and a walker. He does not let his disbality stop him in anway. He find a way to overcome it and move. It is truly amazing the determination and inner strength it took for this young man to stand up out of wheelchair and pay respect to flag.
9 | Peter Schreyer | 10154919359183812_10154919701268812 | This is the dumbest f****** story I've ever seen what a non-news story who the f*** cares what does that have to do with why people are kneeling. Mainstream media just is so full of s*** it's unbelievable
10 | Abram Gabriel Chavarria | 10154919359183812_10154919798068812 | I worked at a high school and there was a girl who had spina bifida. At the time elevators required a key to operate them. If I saw her going to my building I would wait to  see if she was going upstairs because I saw her take the stairs, crutches and all. That was over 10 years ago, now the elevators don't need a key and I've seen kids in wheelchairs waiting to use the elevators because of healthy kids are "too tired to take the stairs".
11 | Trish Guarnery Lueken | 10154919359183812_10154919699233812 | This whole stand, kneel thing has gotten out of hand. Before you know it, kneeling will become the universal way of showing respect.
12 | Tammy Binion | 10154919359183812_10154919750953812 | My daughter has this and has had 22 surgeries on her spine and she's only 13. It's really a hard thing to go through. She's going through depression and all types of other things. God bless this young man and everyone else dealing with this.. 😥
13 | Heather Scattergood | 10154919359183812_10154919447073812 | Not only bring awareness, but make NFL players think twice about going down on a knee.
14 | Roselyn Briggs | 10154919359183812_10154919376298812 | She can spread it w/o using the flag, ppl will listen, there is a huge difference between what is going on and that
15 | Krystal Crawley | 10154919359183812_10154919589108812 | Seriously what does one have to do with the other. ABC likes to race baiting with stories like these
16 | Maegan Beatty | 10154919359183812_10154919518653812 | That is so powerful! I am proud to be an American!
17 | Robert Richter | 10154919359183812_10154919438258812 | He's a white kid. It doesn't mean anything. His wheelchair would be confiscated under Obama-Clinton regime.
18 | Marissa Peart | 10154919359183812_10154919461303812 | Stuff like this wouldn't be a story if CK didn't make it one. People refuse to understand why he felt the need to kneel.
19 | Melissa Barnard | 10154919359183812_10154919405753812 | HEY NFL players DO YOU SEE THIS young MAN????
20 | Danielle Williams | 10154919359183812_10154919564553812 | Anything for fifteen minutes...this has no correlation to WHY WE sit.
21 | Susan Summers | 10154919359183812_10154919825548812 | What a wonderful child he is MY HERO, God Bless You !!!
22 | Alyssa Nalapo | 10154919359183812_10154919809073812 | *quietly looks at comments comparing kid to Kapernick, and thinking its absolutely hilarious*
23 | Amie Rosiak | 10154919359183812_10154919762758812 | God Bless him. Then you have perfectly fine athletes who kneel.
24 | Paul Paradis | 10154919359183812_10154919503878812 | It won't sway the racist only BLM hate group because the kid is white.
25 | Jeffery Mcwire | 10154919359183812_10154919413963812 | Kids with Spina Bifida need special medical attention and i hope the government would seek in helping out these mother whose kids is suffering from Spina Bifida

Donald J. Trump said the women who have accused him of sexual misconduct in recent days are looking for their '10 minutes of fame.' "Why would they all make up these stories?" http://abcn.ws/2enNnvP #Debates
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Rickey Norton | 10154919277463812_10154919298343812 | better yet, why would the wait 30,20, or even 10 years to come foward just weeks before the election. Hell evev liberal voters can figure this out if they think really hard....
2 | Katrica Driscoll | 10154919277463812_10154919337483812 | No proof (unlike Clinton's indiscretions). I'm not buying it ladies. Why did you wait until right before the election and where is documented proof? Give me that beyond a shadow of a doubt (you know, something similar to those 30k+ emails that his opponent is tied too) or stop lying and go home.
3 | Andrew Benware | 10154919277463812_10154919295058812 | hmmm... Bill Clinton's accusers should be heard and respected but his are all liars and ugly and making it all up. Hypocracy at its finest.
4 | Lauretta Rivers | 10154919277463812_10154919354963812 | Why would they wait 30 days before an election to come out...all a part of Hillary's scheme...she can't win on her own merit or records because it is horrible....but she can destroy the opponent at any cost...and the media is her personal tool...shame shame shame...
5 | Dan Burnzinsky | 10154919277463812_10154919379078812 | If people want 4 more years of the same government corruption , LIES , debt , no jobs, people shooting at cops, cities burned down , healthcare going up till you can NOT afford it , then vote for Hillary ! But don`t cry when we are attacked , illegals are stealing you`re jobs and getting better care then you . Illegals pouring into this country . Crime , murders and rape by ILLEGALS . Its what you Hillary voters want . There will NEVER be a change in our life time .
6 | Lisa Cooke | 10154919277463812_10154919386108812 | They were most likely paid to say those things! They came forward a week after hearing a recording! Oh yeah like I believe them. If it were true why didn't they come forward sooner? I don't believe them!
7 | Joel Odegaard | 10154919277463812_10154919301653812 | Money from the Clinton foundation, because they weren't good enough to make it on there own so thought this was a good idea. But let's face it you don't wait years to accuse a billionaire you go right away when it can still be proven. And for all you women who are gonna say you were assaulted and never came forward how many of the men were billionaires?
8 | Eva Mcgregor | 10154919277463812_10154919392853812 | My thought is, that he is so rich he gets women flirting with him on a daily basis ,he doesn't even need to stoop this low.
9 | L L Ind Ziolkowski | 10154919277463812_10154919367278812 | Abc news needs to drop this bull..drop it!!!Just like lying pig serial killer Clinton said..they're all trash..buwahaha!!!Her campaigned group and herself are totally horridly disgusting..bottom line!!!
10 | Mike Goldstein | 10154919277463812_10154919392928812 | Did Hillary Violate Federal law when she revealed the Launch time for our Nuclear Weapons on Television last night? I think she did.
11 | Cass Crowley | 10154919277463812_10154919336658812 | That pointing finger...👈🏻👇🏻👉🏻👆🏻(And yes, they were all willing to just let it go, to let sleeping dogs lie...unTIL that second debate after that tape of him had come out about his sexual deviousness, and he said it was 'only words folks' and that he had 'never' done that to anyone. That set them ALL off! Of course that's what happened, absolutely and without a doubt. He's been the sleeping dog.
12 | Lisa Templin-Rayborn | 10154919277463812_10154919355538812 | ABC shouldn't be able to use "new' in the company ... It should day "selective / bias-based new". Shame on you. If only you were the watchdog of society and presented both sides. Instead of watchdog your a lap dog.
13 | Jeremy Kopko | 10154919277463812_10154919318718812 | I haven't heard anything about the alleged victims suing trump, if they're coming out what are is the endgame?  Endgame is to mislead yet again on the corruption. We don't need a career polititan, as Donald said, you were in politics for 30 years, why haven't you changed it yet.
14 | Jan Coffman | 10154919277463812_10154919598278812 | Game over Humpty Trumpy. I would like to remind Trump that the world is not rigged against you as you claim. You will lose because you are unqualified, unfit, unstable, unprepared, a bully, draft dodger, racist, tax cheat, adulterer, shallow, narcissistic, and a liar. A man with no respect for our war heroes, women, or the disabled. It's over Trump you were knocked out tonight..... game over!!!#POS#SoreLoser
15 | Mason Hayat | 10154919277463812_10154919358368812 | OK, let's clear this once and for all. If Trump genuiinely believes that the owners of this country don't want him in the White House so they are doing everything in their power to keep him out ( which is the exact meaning of the word rigged that he keeps using in this regards ) OK, if that is the case, then he must pull out now and make himself seriously and geniunely heard . But if he choses to wait so he " might" win as it is, then his claims are not worth a Goddamn penny.
16 | Stephen Elsberry | 10154919277463812_10154919285343812 | " I hear that train a comin’It’s rollin’ round the bend.Gonna pick up Mrs. ClintonAnd take her to the pen.They’ll have her coronationMake her cell block queenHillary for prisontwo thousand and sixteenThey’ve got an orange pants suitHangin’ on the wallAnd a cell for Bubba WillieJust a little down the hall.We’ll put ‘em in the big houseLock them up inside.Unless a whole lot of witnessesCommit suicide.Remember James McDougalAnd 20 or 30 moreAbout to testify, they found ‘em dead upon the floor.Now they’re pilin’ up the bodiesLike they did back thenThey want back in the White HouseHere we go again.Glue the china to the tableNail the table to the floorLock up all the silverfore they haul it out the doorWhite trash in the White HouseBeats all I’ve ever seen.Hillary for prisontwo thousand and sixteen

18 | James Davis | 10154919277463812_10154919313643812 | Well he spoke about the women when asked about them but Hilary completely ignored the question about bills rape accusations because she knows he did it and covered it up ruining those ladies lives and what about
19 | Robert Richter | 10154919277463812_10154919439368812 | I too believe there will be massive voter fraud. I'm with Trump on this issue. I think voter fraud is the goal of Dem's open border plans. Take the results to court, if necessary Donald, because you know they would.
20 | Tim Harris | 10154919277463812_10154919714188812 | I posted this On Speaker Paul Ryan's fb page... Please share this is an emergency. "Dear Speaker, After last nights debate I was hoping to see something that made me want to vote and "sell" me on one candidate one another. So, I am a busy man, I have a retail outlets, a wholesale division that operates throughout the USA, I deal in stones, minerals, crystals and gems. So, I must participate in international trade. I wouldn't hire either person to run my company. If I was looking to hire for that position, I would pull the job and keep things as they are and re-advertise and start the process all over again.... Universities, major corporations and small companies will pull the job position and re-advertise it. Why can't we the people do this. Let's postpone the current presidential election until July, 4th, 2017 and start all over. This is tearing the country apart, I've read the constitution, this whole process is not in it. Neither one is qualified for the most important job in the world... Please act now on our behalf.
21 | Lauretta Rivers | 10154919277463812_10154919471178812 | another play from the Hillary Playbook...referring to him having a tantrum...he has some legit grips...the media is in the DNC pocket...and she has played dirty and hasn't been called out...most of us are able to see the bias...some are blind to it.  He runs a business I am not worried about his temperment...more worried about a woman who owes a lot of people of a lot favors and the American...can't afford to pay her off so we have to get behind the elite...
22 | Rendy Halm | 10154919277463812_10154919597633812 | You are all answering your own question on why they chose not to speak. For the very reason you all are speaking. Trump is the victim and the real victims, the woman who were assaulted are the liars. Remember when Bill Cljnton did this and everyone wanted him impeached? I guess the only real truth here is it does matter political affiliation. If your a democrat sexual assault is unacceptable. If your a Republican trying to win an election it's justified. Remember this at the last debate the man who claims to have the most respect for woman actually victimized them again by holding a press conference for them to tell their stories and seat them in the from tow if the debate. He used them and their stories for political gain. How is that respect for woman? I never condoned Clintons behavior against woman and I don't condone Trumps. It speaks volumes to their character or lack thereof.
23 | Linda Kimbro | 10154919277463812_10154919617798812 | How are they wealthy now. Remember they were flat broke when they left the White House but now they are worth more than a quarter of a million dollars  but they don't work. Only thing they have is a charity. There is lots I don't understand about the devil couple.
24 | Vince Allison | 10154919277463812_10154919467358812 | Funny how the press and liberals (redundant I know) had no problem with gore refusing to accept the results. Today on ABC am George said gore agreed to accept the results during the debates. Yet when the time actually came he did the opposite. No wonder the liberals love him. At least Trump is honest.
25 | Konny Theresia King | 10154919277463812_10154919511683812 | we are doomed ! trump is full of himself and hillary is hiding too much, neither one should be running :(  , i know , why not elect charly brown!

Miami city official proposes using bats, which eat mosquitoes, to try to combat the spread of the Zika virus.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Richard Fink | 10154919233233812_10154919824013812 | Lmao!!! Do they know how many bats they would need to make a significant impact? What's next? How about releasing millions of frogs because frogs love mosquitoes too. Get the scientists to do their job and find a damn cure for this disease
2 | Kelli Jean Gould | 10154919233233812_10154919256963812 | Wow. Late to the game.  Bats. Should have been the first weapon. They can eat soo many of them compared to their own body weight
3 | Hideyo Peterson | 10154919233233812_10154919251948812 | It sounds good, but when bats population increase too much, what harm would that cause not only to humans but to other animals and nature?
4 | Brook Pike | 10154919233233812_10154919355213812 | But Bats are the #1 carrier of rabies.....with the higest outbreaks in MI and Indiana in a very long time... Please make sure to vaccinate..
5 | Ben Alexander | 10154919233233812_10154919236748812 | The fact that Hillary is not wearing an American flag pin says it all. She is not for America. She is only for herself. If she wins, we all lose. She is a liar, criminal and a con artist. We need real change!
6 | Conner Aaron Dyer | 10154919233233812_10154919247633812 | Dangerous dangerous dangerous to introduce wildlife into an environment. Look at Australia.
7 | Debbie Polchlopek Markwardt | 10154919233233812_10154919494558812 | Bats do a great job of eating mosquitoes but I can see them over loading on bats and now they will have two problems
8 | Katie Davis | 10154919233233812_10154919653963812 | But I thought zika was just perpetuated by the media to scare us??
9 | Frances Law | 10154919233233812_10154919352113812 | Are they using existing bat populations or bringing in new colonies? If the latter they may introduce another problem.
10 | Stacy McDaniel | 10154919233233812_10154919356743812 | Then you have a bat problem and they carry disease too!
11 | Eleanor Billig | 10154919233233812_10154919258363812 | Not going to work..they won't eat them they don't want to catch the zika virus ..Besides doesn't anyone remember the love bug solution how'd that work for ya' s Floridians and bats are a lot bigger to have around when it doesn't work out 😔
12 | Frank Diggler | 10154919233233812_10154919767728812 | I foresaw it in a vision bats would be the answer.
13 | Caitlan Farrell | 10154919233233812_10154919791578812 | All I'm thinking of is brining in the cane toads to eat the cane beetles...
14 | Saskia Niekoop | 10154919233233812_10154919834788812 | See! Michael why it's important to keep animals from going extinct.
15 | Canaan Lamborghini | 10154919233233812_10154919719618812 | That's a terrible idea! We'll end up with a vampire problem next!
16 | Brandy Jones | 10154919233233812_10154919548908812 | Is it just me or How will the Bats Not Get the Virus from eating infected food?! Is there a BFDA (Bat Food & Drug Admin) ?
17 | Beth Kearney | 10154919233233812_10154919276983812 | Look what's going on down here is Australia! Don't do it! Trust me!
18 | El Joey | 10154919233233812_10154919402338812 | Bats with rabies are going to be more aggressive with zika now. Beware, Batman is behind all the commotion.
19 | Doug Lambert | 10154919233233812_10154919432713812 | Ben---the fact that you post your shallow political insights on a thread about bats and a virus says it all. And it isn't much. Bye!
20 | Doug Lambert | 10154919233233812_10154919372918812 | This is another example of the great minds that "lead" us.
21 | Joshua Onos Bayagbon | 10154919233233812_10154919274758812 | Blood suckers are way more dangerous than zika virus. I don't trust them, they might result to a new deadly threat (deadly virus).
22 | Hilary Arceneaux | 10154919233233812_10154919834063812 | Every time they release a new animal in Florida to combat some other pest, its bad.
23 | Joseph Devanna | 10154919233233812_10154919392798812 | Sounds good, of course then they'll have vampires as well.
24 | Dave Gross | 10154919233233812_10154919485353812 | Happy Halloween, lol 🎃

Kurdish military commander overseeing forces in Iraq says it could take 2 more weeks for advancing troops to reach Mosul, and 2 months to liberate the city from ISIS.

1 | Joseph Chandler | 10154919121003812_10154919137673812 | Anyone voting for Clinton really needs to reconsider their vote. You cannot defeat isis with only strategic air strikes and a couple hundred special forces members. Sooner or later a ground invasion and ground force will have to be done along with air strikes as well as others. My God are people really as uneducated as they were when we tried to enforce a no fly zone in Iraq but people still disobeyed it. All I see is history repeating itself.
2 | Brad Evans | 10154919121003812_10154919228218812 | INTERESTING INFO.1) ABC News executive producer Ian Cameron is married to Susan Rice, Obama's National Security Adviser.2) CBS President David Rhodes is the brother of Ben Rhodes, Obama’s Deputy National Security Adviser for Strategic Communications.3) ABC News correspondent Claire Shipman is married to former Obama Whitehouse Press Secretary Jay Carney.4) ABC News and Univision reporter Matthew Jaffe is married to Katie Hogan, Obama’s Deputy Press Secretary.5) ABC President Ben Sherwood is the brother of Obama’s Special Adviser Elizabeth Sherwood.6) CNN President Virginia Moseley is married to former Hillary Clinton’s Deputy Secretary Tom Nides.Etc... etc...

3 | Tom Lacerte | 10154919121003812_10154919246328812 | Just think... 8 years ago, the U.S. was in control of Mosul.

Phil Chess, co-founder of influential Chicago blues label Chess Records that launched the careers of Howlin' Wolf and Muddy Waters, has died at age 95.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Theo Brubaker | 10154919010083812_10154919050593812 | Tim. I had to look that up. This guy, Shiloh Fernandez played Phil Chess in the movie. His part must've been edited out, or we see him (unidentified as Phil) anonymously turning mixer dials in the studio. Weird he was really left out.

You will realize most of us have not been fooled into believing all your con jobs.   Not only that we will be absolutely determined to not spend one penny on anything Trump.   There are a few reasons for that.   #1  Don Jr and this elephant tail.   #2   Photo of you one a bed with Ivanka.  She looked 15 and you looked ready to ___________.   #3   Selina Scott British Reporter that you allegedly stalked for 20 years.   I read about this story years ago LONG before the campaign.  Selina refused to get in Trump's airplane bed.   Yes, she was doing a documentary on Donald just like the People one.

Actress Shailene Woodley faces maximum penalty of 60 days in jail and/or fine of up to $3,000 if convicted of criminal trespass and riot charges after her arrest earlier this month while protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Dakota Morrison | 10154918892378812_10154918928578812 | Thank you shailene. Not only did you stand up for what you believe in, but you managed to draw more media attention to the issue than it would've ever seen otherwise. Glad to see some people know how to use their platform for good.
2 | Nora Lefthandbull | 10154918892378812_10154918903243812 | So-called mainstream media is just getting wind of this? Old news. Get your reporters there to continue coverage. Thank you.
3 | Katherine Wilson | 10154918892378812_10154919029673812 | Such bs. They admitted to only arresting her because of who she was. Didn't arrest any of the other people who admitted they were with her. They're trying to make an example of her, it's ridiculous. She left with everyone else when asked to do so.
4 | Adelice Legleu | 10154918892378812_10154918900503812 | Weren't the charges dropped? Glad this was all record. Plus they NEVER READ HER RIGHTS!
5 | Michael Coy | 10154918892378812_10154918914258812 | The riot part is funny. She live streamed the whole thing.. Dandelions and butterflies but no riot.
6 | Misty Hall | 10154918892378812_10154919155083812 | Go to her page. She was live for 2 hrs before she got arrested. It shows everything including her walking peacefully back to her car when they were asked to leave. They followed her and only her and arrested her. There was NO riot.
7 | Adéwalé Joséphe | 10154918892378812_10154918904293812 | Id bail her out if shes down to watch Netflix and Chill.
8 | Lea Ates Genna | 10154918892378812_10154918931538812 | Yeah well someone need to press charages against that company trying to put in that pipeline, and also press charges against the people who gave them the permit
9 | Kelly Heckman | 10154918892378812_10154919250598812 | Guess you miss this story huhDoubt it will ever be seen or hit the national news JOURNALISTS held hostage in their car by mob inside Dakota Access Pipeline protest campsite- blocked in and threatened for 30 mins.Protesters threatened to slash tires, break into the car, seize filming equipment. Journalists were trapped in their car until massive police presence led to their release. Journalists Phelim McAleer and Magdalena Segieda were subjected to a terrifying 30 minute ordeal after being attacked by Dakota Access Pipeline Protesters whilst conducting interviews at the Sacred Stone Camp.It started with one protester grabbing McAleer's microphone mid-question and physically assaulting him.Others joined the attack forcing McAleer and his colleagues to flee to their car intending to leave the protest camp.However the car quickly became surrounded by a mob with a pack of dogs and sticks who also used three vehicles to block in the journalists preventing them from leaving the camp.The mob became increasingly violent ordering the journalists out of their car warning of the consequences of refusing to get out.At one point protesters started to shake the car and punched the windows. They also stated they were going to destroy the film equipment and any footage gathered."It was a terrifying 30 minutes." McAleer."There is a lot of talk about love and peace at the camp but yesterday we got a look at the reality behind the talk and it was an ugly violent reality," he added.Not being able to escape, the journalists feared for their lives and called the police.The police deployed several police cars as well as air support and a SWAT team and only after their arrival did the protesters allow the journalist to drive out of the camp. McAleer said the situation turned violent after he started asking difficult questions about how the protesters were against oil and pipelines but used oil based products (cars & plastic) in their campaign."This sends a chilling message to journalists covering the Dakota Access Pipeline story. The message is you can only ask softball questions if you ask difficult questions you will be met with violence and intimidation.""My fellow journalists need to report this and call them out on this intimidation of journalists just trying to do their job."Segieda said "We were just doing our job and met with incredible aggression. It was the scariest 30 minutes of my life. If the police didn't arrive I'm not sure if we would have make it out of there and certainly not with our footage".McAleer, a veteran journalist who covered The Troubles in Northern Ireland said this was one of the most terrifying situations he's ever been in during his long career.McAleer and Segieda will release footage shortly.

16 | Joseph Chandler | 10154918892378812_10154918901593812 | She did indeed trespass on private property and videoed it and even stated she feared being arrested for trespassing even though she knew it was wrong she did it. Pay the fine and accept responsibility for your actions.

1 | J Kimberly Walker | 10154918832273812_10154918879808812 | Disappointed at the feed on this officer's death.  The public knowns nothing about him...he was responding to a call of need...and was murderd, leaving behind a family.  Heartbreaking for those left to grieve for him...and the same is said for the innocent lives of civilians who have the same outcome at the hands of those tasked to protect them.
2 | Mark S Bowman | 10154918832273812_10154918983703812 | This is so sad, that people are using this post and platform to preach about issues, totally unrelated to this tragedy. This murder, had no bearing on race or BLM. It was in one of the most sparsely, populated areas in a desolate section of Northeastern California, yet people are purposely discussing this as if it were another situation similar to El Cajon, Ferguson, etc. I'm all for the race discussion when it applies, but this one was far removed from what people are discussing on this post.
3 | Jason Lackman | 10154918832273812_10154918937823812 | And people wonder why cops are a little quick to pull the trigger....How many of these cops might have been alive if they didn't have to process whether or not they could fire back/first when they see a gun without causing a week's worth of riots throughout the country? I mean, assuming they were able to.
4 | Kimmie Jo Christianson | 10154918832273812_10154918884293812 | It really sad that people of any gender thinks this is ok there's bad cops yes there's bad civilians of all color and nationalities yes but that gives no one the right to shoot anyone and it sure doesn't give anyone the right to think it's ok RIP Sir and thank you for your service prayers for you and for your family and prayers even for the person who though your life was worthless as a law enforcer
5 | Dvee Walker | 10154918832273812_10154919138918812 | I don't understand man, this man got murdered and he left a family behind, innocent African Americans get murdered by trigger happy racist cops 🚓, these are two different events pls let's not mix em up ok, someone's family is grieving right now.😞
6 | Jeff Kalb | 10154918832273812_10154918886048812 | So much ignorance on this post. Nobody should be targeted and killed for any reason. And if youre one of the ones who are happy about this, youre whats wrong with this world.
7 | Carrie Leschke | 10154918832273812_10154919504113812 | 31 year old Jack Hopkins needs to be remembered for his bravery and ultimate sacrifice. His life was senselessly taken while he was trying to "serve and protect".  He was abruptly taken away from his loved ones. Not one more, they said. Yet, there have been dozens. Say what you need to now because it may be the last time you see your loved ones.
8 | Brenda Devereux | 10154918832273812_10154918890158812 | No words! Cannot begin to imagine how his family feel, I don't know the man and I can't stomach the thought of his senseless murder.
9 | Andy Dickerson | 10154918832273812_10154918881178812 | Carroll e gant jr. How do you know this cop was corrupt ? Maybe he was a good man. It's the younger ones who are more corrupt.the older cops are just trying to get to retirement.young ones are trying to make a name.again.only a handful are corrupt.I've dealt with many nice cops.
10 | George Rocha | 10154918832273812_10154919496898812 | We must reinstate Death Penalty in California , we can not let Felons run wild in the State killing innocent people no more ...
11 | Anthony Roldan | 10154918832273812_10154918880193812 | Is it me..but it looks like every time a cop kills someone in one state...a cop gets killed in another...it's a war....out there for both sides
12 | Triana Perez | 10154918832273812_10154919539618812 | This is very sad but what about all the people who are dying by police as well. It's sad that people can't just calm themselves
13 | Orazio Saitta | 10154918832273812_10154918937658812 | America people is bed with. NO Rispet is bed Vampire. Killed people is.

14 | Xavier Morales | 10154918832273812_10154919573283812 | This is the result of all your online stupidity and hatred of authority. Spreading fear and ignorance among communities. Youve succeeded in starting a war on police, now.....the good police that have nothing to do with the few...very few instances of bad encounters with law enforcement and the public, are being targeted like this. I hope the police give up on the people in this country one day so people know how ugly the world can really be without them.
15 | John Michael | 10154918832273812_10154919838493812 | I blame CNN, ABC, CBS, NBC, NY DAILY NEWS, NY NEWSDAY, NY TIMES ETC. You all have blood on your hands for making people hate the police. We all know that's what was in the plans.
16 | Seven Seven | 10154918832273812_10154919721153812 | Yeah but twenty people probably been murdered by pigs this week !! 4 systematically paid pigs deaths dont justify them murdering close to a thousand people this year alone !!
17 | Maurice Taylor | 10154918832273812_10154918887423812 | Ok I feel for his family I honestly I do not want to read the comments or comment outside of this thread. I AM ALWAYS APPALLED AND UPSET WHEN A PERSON WHO HAS DEDICATED HIS OR HER LIFE TO PROTECTING THE PUBLIC IS KILLED!! RIP OFFICER!!! SMDH!
18 | Ruthann Cook Sokol | 10154918832273812_10154918840403812 | SO SORRY AND ASHAMMED OF WHAT AMERICA HAS BECOME.
19 | Ann Day | 10154918832273812_10154919451863812 | Rest in peace sir. Thank you for your service. Thoughts and prayers to the family and friends. This madness needs to stop!!!!!
20 | Brian Edwards | 10154918832273812_10154919020118812 | People already blaming BLM and Obama for a random police killing. Of course I'm talking about a very specific group of people.
21 | Walter Ron Ron Mayes | 10154918832273812_10154919039048812 | R.i.p condolences to the family all lives matter the shooter is the one to blame

They have done nothing but spread malicious hate and rape hysteria which results in bigotry and suspicion on men and perpetuates anti-male prejudice and misandry!!! I will NEVER look at this phony and worthless publication ever!!!
2 | Mark Carter | 10154918764243812_10154918875693812 | Listen people. It's not about the presidential race. Thinking it's skewed  it to that. Someone got hurt in this case. Maybe it did happen maybe it didn't. Gosh I hope rape didn't happen for the girls sake.
3 | Skender Boci | 10154918764243812_10154918773428812 | I would like to remind Donald #Trump that the system is not rigged instead you might lose because you are unfit, unstable, unprepared, a bully, a tax cheat, a pervert, a racist, narcissist, shallow, a person that have no respect for women or disabled people and heartless.

1 | Derawle Drew | 10154918740888812_10154918763098812 | If the elections are rigged, as attested by Donald Trump, then the Republican Party needs to explain how/why....- The GOP controls both Houses of Congress- The GOP has the majority of State Governorships- The GOP controls the majority of State Legislatures- The GOP controlled the Supreme Court up until Judge Scalia's deathMaybe the GOP should also explain why they believe the country is going in the wrong direction, since they are in control!!!
2 | Kyle Simpson | 10154918740888812_10154918779593812 | It is obvious what separates Trump and Clinton on how they view their voters. Trump made a statement tonight on how he relies on American voters seeing through propaganda, while Wikileaks emails show Democrats rely on voter ignorance.
3 | Hilary Marshman | 10154918740888812_10154918761503812 | Nasty vile woman supports babies being aborted at 9 months. Im completely disgusted by her. She shouldve been aborted.
4 | Phyllis Hargrave | 10154918740888812_10154918786708812 | Every time Trump leaned into the microphone and said "wrong" all I could think of was Alec Baldwin and SNL....Bahahahahaha!!!
5 | Crystal Gardner Cheaves | 10154918740888812_10154918802308812 | Trump is going to win, Americans can see past all the democrats cheating and lies. Hillary is the queen of lies. Trump might not be as polished a debater as Hillary, or might not know every bad guys name in the middle east, but atleast he will stand up for our Country. We also have confirmed that Hillary has no problem KILLING a 9 month fully developed baby. We also know Hillary should not have been able to run for President in the first place and if the FBI would do their job she would be in prison. Enough brainwashing by Hillary. Donald Trumps got this 2016

8 | Jonathan Buttall | 10154918740888812_10154918779213812 | Trump again sabotaged himself for the third debate in a row by saying he won't accept election results........even before his inevitable loss by a landslide. Conservative media was appalled and furious at him. This is the second month of Trumps complete meltdown.
9 | Lori Adams | 10154918740888812_10154918764518812 | Opposed to what the democrats, liberals and media would have you believe about our country being based on a peaceful transfer of power, our country actually was based on the peoples right to overthrow a corrupt government. It was considered our duty. In addition, the first contested presidency was the third election and took place in 1796 and it was contested by the hot headed, Thomas Jefferson. Check the facts!
10 | Donna McGlothlin | 10154918740888812_10154918856878812 | I would like to know Hillary talks about Trump's money. What about her money what she got from people the government does or doesn't know about. What about the money they stolen from social security. My husband and I live on $1700 a month. $600 rent. My husband is a veteran. Congress wants $174,000 a year and hasn't passed a budget. If we did that we would get fired. The Government borrowed the money from social security and didn't  put it back. As far as you abc Hillary Clinton has talked twice to Donald once. You news media suck on informing America. She has had 30 years to make and hasn't.  Trump may not be the best but he's better then a trader who gave $80,000,000 million dollars to our enemy who want to kill us. If she wins we as a nation of death.
11 | Lori Mills | 10154918740888812_10154919254943812 | Fact check. People in Colorado are receiving more than one ballot. George Soros paid to build the voting machines to be used in Colorado and other swing states.,
12 | Donna McGlothlin | 10154918740888812_10154918878558812 | You all are stupid Obama going to declare Marshall Law and there won't be an election. That's how smart you are abc news you sucks. TELL the damn truth before you kill America just one of you.
13 | Huns Core | 10154918740888812_10154918830673812 | if HiLIARy is not nasty, why her daughter looks not like clinton but Hubbell?, if she is not nasty, why she insulted the women her husband insulted? if she is not nasty,why she deleted 33,000 emails ,if she is not nasty, why she left 4 American men dead without helping them,.........she is a liar as Obama said: she only talks but never can do ...https://youtu.be/UoE73WNoCXo
14 | Lora Wiencek Dominow | 10154918740888812_10154919619943812 | The only fact we need to know is...neither of these people are worthy of the office of president of the United States! What an unbelievable embarrasment it is that this is the best we could do!
15 | Kathy Chiappone Brooks | 10154918740888812_10154919461798812 | ABC I stopped watching all of your programming, completely biased station. Get back to the basics of reporting the news and the facts not skewed in one direction or another. Getting rid of George Stephanopoulos would be your first step.
16 | Donna Marie Givens | 10154918740888812_10154918837988812 | This all may be a mute point since she saw fit to announce our nuclear response time to the world. Yep, a real guardian of national security.
17 | Bill McKetrick | 10154918740888812_10154918884643812 | If you Trumptards are lucky.......when he loses, maybe Donald Trump will buy an island where you can all go live under his rule. You can call it 'Dumbfuckistan' !!
18 | T Elliott Cato | 10154918740888812_10154918862363812 | Attention Visitors: The Trumpanzees are currently in the midst of one of their frequent poo flinging fests. For your own well-being please do not attempt to engage, inform or feed the animals as they process their grief, but feel free to scroll through and observe their antics as they rage among themselves.Management greatly appreciates your patience and self-discipline.
19 | Rickie Prichard | 10154918740888812_10154919846673812 | The Never Bash Clinton network is rolling full steam this morning. I have about 6 different major news networks that show up on my page, you guys are hands down the most aggressive this morning...... It's just too bad it's not unbiased journalism.
20 | Derrick Wray | 10154918740888812_10154919065423812 | How is it that a huge news organization such as ABC's thinks that there are just 2 candidates for president this election?!Jill Stein has been making large gains!!#DrJillStein
21 | Kimmie Jo Christianson | 10154918740888812_10154918834033812 | I'm a nobody and even I knew that once you push that button you only have X amount of time to recant not much so you better make sure that's what you want to do but then I was taught about the cold war
22 | Jeremy Schwanz | 10154918740888812_10154919683513812 | So Mike Wallace said that even Al Gore conceded. Well yes he did but not till after weeks of legal battles and a Supreme Court dessision did he concede a month after the elections were over and a recount. I like that Trump is doing this cause it is absolutely goin g to put the election day in the spotlight and keep it honest. There is no other choice.
23 | Kimmie Jo Christianson | 10154918740888812_10154918839598812 | The only thing Trump said tonight that was true was they tell to many what there going to do that's why Bushes Shock and Awe was effective to bad he did finish it during desert storm
24 | April Mitchell | 10154918740888812_10154918784003812 | The commentators are missing the point that the two most outrageous moments of tonight's debate are directly connected. Trump's unprecedented declaration that he may not accept the results of the election and his absolute refusal to put the blame on Putin's Russia for hacking or anything else are both scandalous, but they not separate positions at all.The goal of Putin's propaganda and cyberattacks are to discredit American democracy, to make Americans fear and hate each other and to distrust the very system that makes the United States such a powerful force in the world. This also serves Putin well domestically, where Russian news, all state controlled, is full of announcements about the US election being rigged, despite a total lack of evidence to the contrary. If even America's elections are fake, goes their argument, how can anyone complain about Russia's sham elections?Tonight Trump announced himself loud and clear to be an agent of Putin's goals to destabilize the United States and its democratic process. He constantly repeats Russian propaganda that America is weak and corrupt. Then Trump demonstrated that he is fiercely loyal to Putin, beyond any possible political advantage. These two positions go together. Trump is Putin's stooge and he just confessed to it on stage in Las Vegas.
25 | Betty Goodman | 10154918740888812_10154918797018812 | Also we the American people do not have to just accept anything ! In the shape this country is in ! Wonder how many of the media is related to clintons ! African American people have been more offended since obama s I'm sivk

Heroic Texas police officer honored with Life-Saving Award after using CPR to save 3-year-old boy suffering a febrile seizure. http://abcn.ws/2douZFw
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Jackie Keel | 10154918707568812_10154918722173812 | This sure beats all the debate posts on my feed tonight....by a million miles ❤️
2 | Fernando Silva | 10154918707568812_10154918758128812 | Some cops are just normal workers, doing what they have to do to go thru a day of work.Some cops are bad guys hiding behind a badge.And some cops are real life heroes, who deserve all the recognition and praise from us, citizens.For more heroes in uniform.
3 | Michael Kline | 10154918707568812_10154918731723812 | Praise God for the giving this officer the ability to remain calm and collected to perform this lifesaving measure that gave this child his new lease on live. God is great.
4 | Mike Kist | 10154918707568812_10154918731468812 | This is what 99.9 % of Police Officers do, they truly are HEROES! .....All lives matter All the time!
5 | Tina Alexander Chambers | 10154918707568812_10154918736268812 | Thank goodness. My oldest suffered a febrile seizure when he was 2. It's beyond scary. And his lasted for nearly an hour - extremely rare. Thank you all police - fire - and ambulatory crew for your efforts everyday !!!!! For all.
6 | Karina Pereira | 10154918707568812_10154918913678812 | A febrile seizure doesn't require CPR, my daughter had them from the moment she was born all the way until she turned 4 years old. I just had to straighten her neck to make sure her breathing passage was open for her to breath. But she never required CPR
7 | Lou Ann Snell | 10154918707568812_10154918784068812 | Mom and dad really need to learn CPR. That way they an be trying to save him instead of standing there waiting on the police. Hopefully it never happens again but it wouldn't hurt to be prepared.
8 | Kellie Ann | 10154918707568812_10154919255263812 | Some of the comments on here are despicable. A child's life was saved because someone showed up who knew how to help. So how about we just give a shout to this family and officer for a positive outcome.
9 | Franchita Thumpper Johnson | 10154918707568812_10154918788298812 | My 3 year old grandson just came home from a week stay in the hospital yesterday behind this same thing, but I performed CPR until rescue got here. Shout out to the officer for saving his life.
10 | Dwayne McDougle | 10154918707568812_10154918918353812 | Quit calling them hero's! They are people who swore to serve and protect simple as that just like myself and many other Veterans who have served their country in time of war and etc am know hero and I don't like the word we as human beings are supposed to help each other in time of need it's what makes us human beings as simple as that !
11 | JoEllen Wynne | 10154918707568812_10154918872988812 | Febrile seizures don't require CPR. It is dangerous. This story does an injustice to education of the public and can harm kids.
12 | Cynthia Anderson | 10154918707568812_10154918875923812 | A police officer is more then just a cop he is keeper of our laws and first to respond at times of need how do some treat them most we do with respect and thankfulness ! Think before you judge them to harshly you never know when they could save the life of someone you love! God watch over our police officers!
13 | Jennifer Gilbert | 10154918707568812_10154919073033812 | My husband and I were also blessed by a wonderful fireman that we just happened to pull into his driveway 14+ years ago when our then 2 year old daughter was having a grandmal seizure and went into cardiac arrest. The firefighter received a life saving award for saving her life too it took 3 rounds of CPR on her. Just more proof of how wonderful God is and that there is wonderful people in the world still!! I'm so happy for you that you still have your son!!!
14 | Brandy Watson | 10154918707568812_10154919688983812 | Daelyn Clark this was you.. My whole word stop that day when you had that seizure. The one thing I hope you never take for granted is your precious life. I almost lost you that day and god said it was not your time. I truly hope that means something to you now that you are 17 and making adult decisions...I Love you kiddo
15 | Maria Pinales-Davis | 10154918707568812_10154919381533812 | It's one of the worst things a parent can experience! My son had a febrile seizure when he was 2 and he turned blue, stopped breathing and started foaming at the mouth after the seizure and he required CPR.
16 | Maa Luna | 10154918707568812_10154918735768812 | Thank you god for everything you done you had this cop on duty at the right time here for the best reason was to save this child's life
17 | Michelle Williams | 10154918707568812_10154918912288812 | If it was febrile, why did they not give the child some medicine to reduce his fever??  Could've been prevented it seems like.  Kudos to the officer for saving his life tho!
18 | Suzie Salka Corbitt | 10154918707568812_10154918930498812 | God bless this hero!!!! I know he'll say " just doing my job ma'am." But he's a hero in my book!!!! He saved a little guy!!! And basically saves the parents too!!! Police are my heros!!!!!!!!!
19 | Evelyn Maya | 10154918707568812_10154918789793812 | This is so scary my little one had a few and it was one of most the scariest moments I have experienced. Thank God and the police officer who knew exactly what to do 🙏🏻
20 | Darcy Thomas Davis | 10154918707568812_10154919461033812 | I don't understand why, regardless of what type of post it is, people have a way of turning it into something political, something race related, something this movement or that movement related, something hate related. Can't we just find the beauty in a posted video showing a life being saved without putting a negative spin on it?
21 | Misty Partin | 10154918707568812_10154919404438812 | Huge kudos to the policeman for staying calm and following his training. I'd bet he doesn't encounter pediatric CPR situations often. And yes, for all you know-it-all types who aren't medical (or if you are, you need more training), CPR was necessary in this child. Yay for PALS training for all our heroes in blue!!http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/122/18_suppl_3/S876.figures-only
22 | Juan Escaval | 10154918707568812_10154919642193812 | Is an awful feeling seeing your child in danger and more so when you can't even act to do something abouted with so much feelings mix together....im glad an great full that the police save his life thank you sir. For your service...
23 | Kim Peter Yber | 10154918707568812_10154919610738812 | Can't honor him just like that. That's the part and huge part of being a police officers, they are the first to respond. It's natural for a police to know basic cpr. Why don't we award normal people and homeless who made amazing job on helping people in small simple things that are not documented like this. Anyhow good job pig!
24 | Tina Long | 10154918707568812_10154919291903812 | Kudos to the police officer for what he did here!!  God bless you sir and thank you for your service! To the mom and dad and child may God bless you and watch over you always. There's nothing you could have done to have changed what happened. Febrile seizures come out of no where.
25 | Patti Harris-Friebele | 10154918707568812_10154918756353812 | Kaitlyn Friebele these are the kind of seizures you used to have. Robert Friebele thank God hers were never this bad. The ones she had were bad enough! I'm glad this little guy is ok. Very scary.

FIGHT AGAINST ISIS: Iraq has begun an offensive to retake the city of Mosul from ISIS, the terror organization's de-facto capital in the country. http://abcn.ws/2ea5hX5
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Randy Moldenhauer | 10154918645938812_10154918688503812 | Hillary has worked with Larfarge for many years. She sat on the Board of Directors as far back as the 1980’s. She helped grow the firm for decades.Lafarge’s Executive VP for Operations, Eric Olson, was a featured attendee at the annual meeting of the 2013 Clinton Global Initiative.Lafarge gave $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation in 2015 and is listed as a donor in early 2016.Lafarge has ties in Iraq and was once connected to Saddam Hussein. Reportedly, Hillary insisted that Lagarge invest in oil in the early 2000’s, and the firm started purchasing oil from less-than-savory rebel organizations. This example, along with the aforementioned cement business, are just two ways out of many that Lafarge funded groups like ISIS.Consider this again: Hillary sat on the Board of a firm that has funded ISIS in multiple ways. WikiLeaks documents provide the proof.
2 | Davion Toon Washington | 10154918645938812_10154918711293812 | I gotta pledge allegiance to the flag of a CORRUPT United States Of America🚫🇺🇸, and to a republic that used to stand "one" nation under God now divisible without liberty nor justice for all😔 ....SMH💯
3 | Stephen Kite | 10154918645938812_10154919130683812 | Have you worked out why MSM supports America's anti-ISIS operation in Mosul and elsewhere in Iraq (which is causing death and suffering to civilians), yet holds a contradictory perception of the anti-terrorist efforts by the Syrian and Russian forces in Aleppo?
4 | Vaj Chu Xyooj | 10154918645938812_10154918710618812 | trump is correct.. where the hell is the element of surprise if u announce it to the world that u gone attk someone???

10 | JJ Smith | 10154918645938812_10154918663383812 | good thing the USA told them a month ago they were attacking so Obama and Hillary's buddies could get away
11 | Jeremy Williams | 10154918645938812_10154918652068812 | It ABSOLUTELY disgusts me when people are shady and above having the ability to show decency to others! I am not a judgmental person whatsoever! I try to forgive and forget and to "move on" and make the best out of any situation, no matter the circumstances. I will always try to find something kind to say about everyone I meet. Kindness goes a long way. People won't always remember what you said or did but they ALWAYS will remember how you made them feel. There's a little quote I absolutely love.."The only difference between the saint and the sinner is every saint has a past, and every sinner has a future"Good words to remember!!
12 | Dave Bennett | 10154918645938812_10154918707548812 | Be prepared to see this way more if Hillary is elected president on us grounds. She supports open boarders which is no bueno
13 | Bob Mees | 10154918645938812_10154918731973812 | Wow, this isn't about the candidates at all. It's about a horrible situation and we need to see more of it. Like we did in the Vietnam war. It finally turned the public perception. Thoughts for all the people involved. Remember there's families with children there when you do your next bs post. Oddly, it seems to be trump supporters mainly. Peace.

New email surfaces between Hillary Clinton and IT specialist responsible for maintaining her private email server - and critics say that it may undermine her claim she couldn't remember communicating with him.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Barney Wilkins | 10154918588688812_10154918609433812 | Read this folks - "Apparently, the FBI forgot to visit the Cornell Law Library. Word for word from the Cornell Law Library Former United States Attorney General Michael Mukasey tells MSNBC that not only is Hillary Clinton's private email server illegal, it "disqualifies" her from holding any federal office. Very specifically points to one federal law, Title 18. Section 2071. For those of us who do not have United States Code committed to memory, here's what it says:“(a) Whoever willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys, or attempts to do so, or, with intent to do so takes and carries away any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both. (b) Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States. As used in this subsection, the term “office” does not include the office held by any person as a retired officer of the Armed Forces of the United States.”Yes, it explicitly states "shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States.
2 | Cynthia Washburn Saturday | 10154918588688812_10154918597788812 | Hillary made Trump look like the Chump he is. #PutinsChumpTrump She had facts and he had adjectives....... Bigly..... "we're gonna do more better with Mexico..." ~from Trump's superior brain!!! LOL ;D
3 | Jeff Deroche | 10154918588688812_10154918665313812 | This is a meaningless report. I send enough emails at work, most of them I archive. I could not recall who sent me an email last week as I receive more than 100 per day. It's ridiculous background noise.
4 | Dave Kennedy | 10154918588688812_10154918601883812 | If Hillary Clinton Dodges and pivot anymore she should be on Dancing With the StarsI'm glad he brought up these videos.A little bit more should of been saidSHARE VIDEOS.. https://milo.yiannopoulos.net/2016/10/blackout-okeefe-ignored-mainstream/
5 | Dana Ortiz | 10154918588688812_10154918630038812 | I don't recall everyone I've ever talked to or emailed and quite frankly my circle is much smaller than hers. I can barely remember what I wore yesterday 😂 if the FBI does or doesn't do its job that is on them. How can you say she "lied" when she stated she doesn't recall something? 🙄 if she had said she didn't but did that would be a lie.
6 | Chris L. Christensen | 10154918588688812_10154918657323812 | Hillary Clinton is a pathological liar who has enabled her husband Billy to rape and abuse women. She is a greedy, corrupt and evil woman. She is a disgrace and scourge to the United States and to all Americans.
7 | Mary Ellen Bayma Bieganowski | 10154918588688812_10154918676573812 | People are so sick of the emails.  Trump is courting trouble with our allies, kisses Putin's bum, alienates Blacks and Mexicans, doesn't pay his taxes, demeans women, runs a foundation that he uses the money for his own purpose rather than the charities that people thought they were donating to, he's stiffed mom and pop businesses, and people who went to the Trump Institute, but, hey, he's presidential.....right?
8 | Andrei Scutea | 10154918588688812_10154918605418812 | Trump 2016! How will corrupt Hillary Clinton banks like Wells Fargo pay their fair share? Solindra? Obamacare? Open borders? How? With what? $6 billion disappeared! $1.7 billion in Iran! $20 trillion debt!🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨By lying and stealing from taxpayers.
9 | Bradley Jordan | 10154918588688812_10154918969033812 | Wow, for the first time in the election,  A lways B acking C linton finally reported something negative and unbiased. I'm certain they won't make a habit of it. Well,  all three debates are over and Mr. Trump scored a hat trick. #Trump2016 #HillaryForPrison
10 | Cindi Taylor Hughes | 10154918588688812_10154918647708812 | So sick of Russia interfering in the election. Not really caring much about the emails in comparison to the alleged child rapist, Trump U scammer, Fla.DA briber, Trump Foundation racketeerer.
11 | Walter G. Kloepfer | 10154918588688812_10154918998898812 | She still might not remember communicating with him. I have forgotten many of the people I communicated with because it was simply day-to-day business and nothing out of the ordinary.  Many people don't dwell on the routine and think about it. Kind of like remembering what you had for breakfast yesterday...sometimes you have to think about it even to remember.
12 | Lingyi Zhang | 10154918588688812_10154919064528812 | Umg her claim was that she didn't recall communications regarding the email server. Both emails, even if she recalled she had with this guy, had nothing to do with the email server at all. So whats the problem? I also doubt she remembered these emails. These seemed very common IT help desk requests. I can't remember how many times I asked our help desk about issues with my PC.
13 | Mike Monahan | 10154918588688812_10154919412743812 | It doesn't matter that she can't remember, what matters is that she willingly broke the law, knowing that she is above the law.   She is snubbing her nose at the American people, and ABC wants you to believe that enforcement of the law requires that she admits that she remembers something.  All the law requires is proof she did something.
14 | Trevor Drescher | 10154918588688812_10154919393423812 | Just because she doesn't recall doesn't mean she's lying. Sometimes I can't recall why I went to the store. She only probably has a couple hundred interactions per day.
15 | Johnny Too Tall Ciambello | 10154918588688812_10154918663123812 | I'm confused.... this surfaced two days ago and it's just now being shared on social media? Just AFTER the final debate instead of... well, two days ago?
16 | Robert Daniels | 10154918588688812_10154918817093812 | Killary lost again and if you think she didn't they you really are a special kind of stupid girl. She has no chance America is done with having a puppet in the White House and killary Clinton is a puppet and a murder. Donald trump for president time to make America great again and lock killary Clinton up for treason.
17 | AJ Branham | 10154918588688812_10154919232323812 | Here's the thing, one or two emails about nothing would make me not remember communicating with a person also.  If, she isn't friends with or speaks to them on a regular basis (she talked to hundreds) then I'm sure (if it were me), that she wouldn't know one Bryan from another.  Stop looking for things that aren't there.  She's been cleared, move on and let's get our country back to the issues.
18 | Abbas Hassan | 10154918588688812_10154918783008812 | Exactly not remembering is not a crime and you have to realize she is looking at a ton of communications- not just electronic. Moreover I think that the fact she admitted it and mentioned that she regretted doing it the way she did In itself should be less damning.
19 | Suzanne Kitchens Gantner | 10154918588688812_10154919550918812 | That's all you have... emails!  Give it a rest. You can't find anything else?  Nobody cares it's a mute point and everyone knows Wikileaks is aligned with fraud and Russia. Move on.
20 | Donna Kellum | 10154918588688812_10154918716868812 | Well thank you ABC for putting out some real information on Clintons crimes! Next week do you think you might try letting your viewers see more facts about this nasty women instead of covering it up for her?
21 | Randy Moldenhauer | 10154918588688812_10154918606798812 | What is this, ABC reporting something negative. Wow George Soros will be pissed. Want to keep him "Happy"
22 | Lisa Patterson | 10154918588688812_10154919393833812 | I'm sure she had advisors telling her what to say and when. No matter what she said, she wasn't going to please everyone. Now maybe if Trump had an advisor he wouldn't say half the crap that pours out of his mouth.
23 | Richie Reyes | 10154918588688812_10154918711278812 | According to Merriam Webster, though, "bigly" is a word. It means "in a big manner, with great scope," or "in a swelling blustering manner," which pretty much sums up what Trump is all about. A big, blustering swell. #nevertrump
24 | Tracie Kennon Rodriguez | 10154918588688812_10154919758563812 | Both candidates are old enough to be my parents, I have days and weeks I am doing good to remember any details. I'm healthy too. I wonder in another 25 if I will still be able to remember with clarity. Saying I don't recall is just that you can't pull it up from memory. It doesn't me it did or didn't happen, it's a statement of being unsure.
25 | Tomas Davis | 10154918588688812_10154918596198812 | I actually feel sorry for Hillary and how badly Trump was able to annihilate her, still he went soft on most of her lies. Even the audience felt Trump was too easy on her.

2 | Diane Urban | 10154918506803812_10154918647833812 | Chris Wallace did a great job.You had the beauty filter on Hillary. Retire Cokie Roberts and Martha Radditz.  Can't remember the other boob, no I'm not talking about George S, but the other boob commentator.
3 | Barney Wilkins | 10154918506803812_10154918588238812 | "Apparently, the FBI forgot to visit the Cornell Law Library. Word for word from the Cornell Law Library Former United States Attorney General Michael Mukasey tells MSNBC that not only is Hillary Clinton's private email server illegal, it "disqualifies" her from holding any federal office. Very specifically points to one federal law, Title 18. Section 2071. For those of us who do not have United States Code committed to memory, here's what it says:“(a) Whoever willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys, or attempts to do so, or, with intent to do so takes and carries away any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both. (b) Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States. As used in this subsection, the term “office” does not include the office held by any person as a retired officer of the Armed Forces of the United States.”Yes, it explicitly states "shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States.
4 | Mike Jurkins | 10154918506803812_10154918656928812 | ABC is a joke.  Here I quote a sample of your BS article,  "6 billion in Iraq contracts were incomplete or could not be located. It did not say $6 billion had been lost."  If you can't locate something, it is lost, you B-squad goons.  Go report on high school sports or something more to your talents.
5 | Jim Hroma | 10154918506803812_10154918749473812 | Does not seem to matter much what the facts really are,with networks like ABC airing the totally biased slander they are putting on the air .Years ago the media reported the facts and the public made their own decisions,now garbage networks like ABC are trying to tell people what they should believe and do,no matter what the truth may be.
6 | Wade Hogan | 10154918506803812_10154918573338812 | Is Hillary paying ths media outlet off as well because Trumps response was completely understandable considering all the fraud and crime Hillary has got away with. Yet this media outlet seems to keep backing Hillary and bashing Trump. Hmm makes me as an American citizen really question your loyalty to we the American people!

20 | Jefferson Neo | 10154918506803812_10154919190238812 | Posted by: Unknown I Remember Why We ALL Despised Her SO Much Back Then... Those that refuse to learn from the lessons of history are condemned to repeat them:   How quickly we forget! If you’re over 35, take a walk with me down memory lane—you won’t believe what you have forgotten. If you’re under 35, read on—I promise you that you will be amazed at what you missed! (By the way, sadly, this isn’t a joke. I wish it was.)REMEMBER WHEN BILL CLINTON WAS PRESIDENT?(January 20, 1993 to January 20, 2001—two terms)When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over an attempt to reform health care.Her proposed plan was so bad that many Democrats came up with competing plans of their own in protest, and in spite of threats and intimidation, on September 26, 1994, the “Hillarycare” bill was declared dead.This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million for studies, promotion, and other efforts.Then, President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general. Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood—both were forced to withdraw their names from consideration.Next, she chose Janet Reno, which husband Bill described as "my worst mistake."(Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.)Husband Bill also allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission—Lani Guanier was her selection.After considerable backlash from prominent Democratic senators concerning Ms. Guanier's radical views, Bill Clinton withdrew her name from nomination, stating that she did not represents the civil rights views that he had championed during his campaign.However, apparently a slow learner, husband Bill continued to allow Hillary to make more recommendations.She chose former law partners, Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department.Her selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kennedy was forced to resign.(Is anyone wondering yet what her Supreme Court Justice appointments would be like?)Many younger voters will have no knowledge of "Travelgate," the first major ethics controversy during Bill’s presidency.Hillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend, Harry Thompson—but the White House Travel Office refused to comply.She trumped up allegations of financial mismanagement and reported seven long-time White House employees to the FBI. This ruined their reputations, got them fired, and caused a thirty-six month investigation.Eventually, most of the employees were reinstated and Clinton associates were forced out of the travel office. Only one White House employee, Billy Dale, was charged with a crime—the enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds; a jury acquitted him in less than two hours.Still not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House Security.When Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies (Filegate) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff, suddenly Hillary and the President denied even knowing Livingstone, and of course, denied knowledge of drug use in the White House.Following this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents.Next, when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by Bill Clinton, Hillary was put in charge of the "bimbo eruption" and scandal defense.Let’s look at some of her more notable decisions in this regard . . .She urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation, they settled with Ms. Jones.She refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor.After $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr's investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs.Hillary's devious game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for 'lying under oath' to a grand jury, followed by his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives.Hillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, "I do not recall," "I have no recollection," and "I don't know" a total of 56 times while under oath. (Sound familiar?)After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had "mistakenly thought was hers."So you see, the email scandal and all of her malfeasance regarding the handling of Top Secret information, not to mention the "pay to play" schemes of the Clinton Foundation, are nothing new.Hillary’s entire political career has been nothing but a web of lies, corruption and destruction in her quest for power.Is anyone else ready to say, “Enough is enough!”?But unfortunately, I’m sure her loyal fans will say, "What difference does it make?"Source:copy/paste......wish I could take credit for this eloquent recap of Historical events

This has always been a problem of the 2 party oligarchy but it has now evolved either on its own or by design to totally fracture the country. And its working brilliantly...

20 | Nick Lavacca | 10154918499678812_10154918545448812 | Time to take a stand and Sound the Trump Pence 2016. We need America back.FOX is why we had Bush in office and why we invaded Iraq without proof and even though it took 11 years to find WMD's which a lot of people don’t even know because the media didn’t cover it very well, the Bush's companies Halliburton and KLH still received billions in no bid contracts and there is still hundreds of millions of tax payers money that never was accounted for. This isn't about politics, this is about the future of American rights and freedom.The whole Media system controlled by a few is corrupt as we can clearly see. How much is air time from the ads on TV per second. The few CEO’s who own major media outlets have given Billions to stop Trump in free air time. We need to take our stand and Sound the Trump/Pence and take this country back.
21 | Lou Brody | 10154918499678812_10154918683393812 | ABC, do your research about the creation of ISIS. Michael Hayden, former director of the CIA and NSA, said on MSNBC's "Morning Joe" on Thursday that Trump could have made a valid point for connecting Obama and ISIS."The actions of the Obama administration in withdrawing from Iraq … actually set the conditions for the recovery of al Qaeda in Iraq, which then became ISIS," Hayden said. "So there's a very powerful case to be made."   I think we need to get a fact checker just to check ABCs factchecking.
22 | Julia S Roberts | 10154918499678812_10154918626058812 | Not one thing Trump said was true. How can people believe him, cause he says so? Simon Says.....

Her name is Bobbie Ann Williams, and she – along with her family – have passed multiple lie-dictator tests when asked if Clinton is the father of her illegitimate son Danny.Buddy Young, a former Arkansas State Trooper, has admitted that in 1983, he drove Clinton and Bobbie to her mother’s home near Hot Springs for an extended, intimate visit while the mother was out-of-town. Both were paid $400 each, plus a $50 tip.What makes the story so compelling is, Danny also looks like Bill!This wouldn’t have been the first mistress Clinton had who happened to be African-American. He also reportedly dated Lencola Sullivan, Miss Arkansas of 1981.https://youtu.be/E_jDaZyV2qw

25 | Anthony J. Mitchell | 10154918499678812_10154919067718812 | Trump claims President Obama, and Hillary Clinton pulled out of Iraq. FalseThe status of forces signed by President Bush, and Iraq detailed the departure of US troop from Iraq. President Obama attempted to negotiate a new status of forces, but Iraq refused to provide the level of protection US troops needed in order to maintain their presence. As a results. The bush-Iraq status of forces agreement went into full effect forcing a withdraw. http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/may/18/jeb-bush/obama-refused-sign-plan-place-leave-10000-troops-i/

After Hillary Clinton said Russian Pres. Putin would 'rather have a puppet as president,' Donald J. Trump shot back: "You're the puppet." http://abcn.ws/2dQ4apU

1 | Delmer Rodriguez | 10154918482508812_10154918486923812 | Trump completely collapsed in each of the three presidential debates. Hilary did not have to do much because the Donald was a self-destructing time bomb the whole time. Trump lost by a lot in all debates. Those who say otherwise and blame the 'media' instead have their heads in the sand.
2 | Clint J. Everest | 10154918482508812_10154918499868812 | Hopefully after Hillary wins the election in a couple weeks, Trump and the remaining republicans can get the help they desperately need.  Many people are saying this.  Very sad.
3 | Alice Sell | 10154918482508812_10154918514428812 | Such an immature and pathetic human being. So ill-prepared to do anything except look after himself. He lies about his lies. It's jus so unfathomable how anyone can be for this despicable low life.

10 | Cynthia Clark | 10154918482508812_10154918564098812 | If Hillary wins that means millions of our USA military will be killed.....under Obama and Clinton our military is not strong enough to go to war with Russia....Hillary will cause many mothers and fathers to lose their sons and daughters in the military...Hillary wants to go to war with Russia.....and bring in 65,000 refugees to rape and murder your children....how will you be able to explain to your daughters why you voted for a woman that brought these savages into our country and allowed them to rape your child.....
11 | Linda Salazar | 10154918482508812_10154918515448812 | Folks I think we are being blinded by trickery!! This stuff with Donald Trump is blinding us to what is going on in the USA with Russia. Putin and Obama are at odds. We DO NOT have bomb shelters. Russia does. Keep your eyes on the true picture. If we have an all out war with Russia you better believe there will be a draft. These young men under 26 will be called up.
12 | Andrew Noseworthy | 10154918482508812_10154918506488812 | If they ever do a live action movie about the puppet Pinocchio in his later years, Trump is gonna get the call from the director. He's a natural. And they'll save money on the makeup. Just gotta get the CGI team working on the nose job. No need to rig the Oscars, the statue is his.
13 | Houmed Ali Kamil | 10154918482508812_10154918561543812 | Trump won this final debate hands down .Women In America and all around the world should take to the streets against Hillary who is a dangerous warmonger.She is a real threat to international peace and stability.. By insisting on the need to defend terrorists in Aleppo and elsewhere in Syria,the former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton could start WW3 against Russia and China.
14 | Eddie Kostlevy | 10154918482508812_10154918502983812 | Hillary is a world class fool sorry to say.Trump should have pointed out why do you put up a big grin when your caught in a lie.All those sanctions on Russia have done nothing.Russia is tight with Iran way more than we are.Putin likes america and wants to work with us and our stupid leaders don't get it.Yes Assad may be bad but the alternative may be a lot worse.Assad is alligned with Iran too.So whose the Dummy Hillary.

20 | Mark Bourez | 10154918482508812_10154918508428812 | She is the puppet, she sold access for donations to the Clinton foundation. QUID PRO QUO. She turned over 20% of US uranium to Russia, they can nuke us with our own uranium because of her greed. They invaded Crimea on her watch. They're a heavy influence in the middle east because of her, the Iran deal made it possible for Russia to sell our uranium to Iran!! Gave Iran 1.7 billion dollars to buy our uranium from Russia.
21 | Luis Argueta | 10154918482508812_10154918522813812 | Trump won't commit to accepting election results because he is the Biggest Loser!!! In his eyes, everything is Rigged!! So ridiculous!!!! SMH!! #neverTrump #IAmwithHer #Hillary2016
22 | Darla Rabesca | 10154918482508812_10154918626113812 | So typical on how all the media outlets are trying to sway voters to Clinton's side?! Aren't news corporations suppose to be equal to everyone?! The only news to trust nowadays is the Russian TV news, Wikileaks, YouTube and Fox news that ppl can count on! Can't believe in the corruption that we all know is happening!
23 | Gabriel Gamez | 10154918482508812_10154918630003812 | I still don't know why people still vote for a criminal Hillary she made American soldier lose their life in Benghazi and especially ambassador Chris Stevens she cost him his life for she had a email thingAnd she had a sickness and disrespect the 9/11 memorialYeah she has a long criminal record
24 | Christina Laumbach | 10154918482508812_10154919128003812 | Don’t dismiss the foreign audience. Trump has struggled for years to become a player in Russia, and may finally have his chance, assuming he loses in November. Trump has generated intrigue in Russia by bro-thumping Vladimir Putin, the Russian leader who is almost categorically dissed by conventional western leaders. Trump is now the one western personality bestowing any respect at all upon the Russian strongman. It seems quite possible Russia has hacked into Clinton campaign emails—and published them, via Wikileaks—to help Trump get elected. It also seems possible Trump has used his candidacy to curry favor with Putin, should he lose. Trump has said he would love to build his landmark towers in Moscow and other Russian cities, and he might just get his chance.
25 | India Michele | 10154918482508812_10154918938013812 | DT needs to stop playing with our country n the Russians like that. That govt doesn't like us and us in bed with our enemies and supplying weapons to them n many other terrorist organizations.. that alone should be high treason

1 | Stephen Saunders | 10154918440913812_10154918468213812 | There are millions of people who intend to vote for Trump who aren't voicing the fact for fear of needless confrontation.  On election day, however, their voices will ring the loudest.
2 | Brandon L Matthew | 10154918440913812_10154918457648812 | You are telling me we got #BadOrangeHombres AND #Clowns now roaming our streets and 'folks' its bad. Could Donald Trump be the leader of these clowns? We dont have the science or technology yet to find out.

5 | Nick Lavacca | 10154918440913812_10154918546373812 | Time to take a stand and Sound the Trump Pence 2016. We need America back.FOX is why we had Bush in office and why we invaded Iraq without proof and even though it took 11 years to find WMD's which a lot of people don’t even know because the media didn’t cover it very well, the Bush's companies Halliburton and KLH still received billions in no bid contracts and there is still hundreds of millions of tax payers money that never was accounted for. This isn't about politics, this is about the future of American rights and freedom.The whole Media system controlled by a few is corrupt as we can clearly see. How much is air time from the ads on TV per second. The few CEO’s who own major media outlets have given Billions to stop Trump in free air time. We need to take our stand and Sound the Trump/Pence and take this country back.

10 | Cindy Sargent | 10154918440913812_10154918468773812 | A story by Oliver North, he knew the Clintons too...Do you remember 1987 when the Senators were giving Ollie North such a bad time? This brings it all into perspective, thought you might be interested in this forgotten bit of information.It was 1987! At a lecture the other day they were playing an old news video of Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North testifying at the Iran-Contra hearings during the Reagan Administration. There was Ollie in front of God and country getting the third degree, but what he said was stunning!He was being drilled by a senator,"did you not recently spend close to $60,000 for a home security system?"Ollie replied, "yes Sir, I did".The senator continued, trying to get a laugh out of the audience, "Isn't that just a little excessive?""No sir" continued Ollie."No, and why not?" the senator asked."Because the lives of my family and I were threatened sir"."Threatened? By whom?" the senator questioned."By a Muslim terrorist sir". Ollie answer."Terrorist? What terrorist could possibly scare you that much?""His name is Osama bin Laden, sir", Ollie replied.At this point the senator tried to repeat the name, but couldn't pronounce it, which most people back then probably couldn't. A couple of people laughed at the attempt. Then the senator continued. "Why are you so afraid of this man?", the senator asked."Because sir, he is the most evil person alive that I know of", Ollie answered, "And the Muslims are trying to take over America and destroy it from the inside out and putting their people into our political offices."And what do you recommend we do about him?", asked the senator."Well, sir, if it was up to me, I would recommend that an assassin team be formed to eliminate him and his men from the face of the earth."The senator disagreed with this approach, and that was all that was shown of the clip. By the way, that senator was Al Gore! Also: Terrorist pilot Mohammad Atta blew up a bus in Israel in 1986. The Israelis captured,tried and imprisoned him. As part of the Oslo agreement with the Palestinians in 1993, Israel had to agree to release so-called, "political prisoners". However, the Israelis would not release any with blood on their hands.The American President at the time, Bill Clinton, and his Secretary of State, Warren Christopher, insisted that all prisoners be released. Thus Mohammad Atta was freed and eventually thanked us by flying an airplane into Tower One of the World Trade Center. This was reported by many of the non-American TV networks at the time that the terrorists were first identified. It was censored in the US from all, pass this on!

22 | China Harris | 10154918440913812_10154918489303812 | A PLAN TO SAVE OUR NATION!!!SHARE!!!!!!!My fellow Americans, A majority of our citizens believe that our nation is doomed because we will elect a President that can not be trusted or a President that will divide our nation with hateful rhetoric and actions.We have a plan that will SAVE our nation, and it is going to take us coming together to do it. I am asking you to read our strategy very carefully because I am going to need your help. Here are the steps we need to take together.STEP #1On November 8, it is our goal to keep Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump from winning 270+ electoral votes.There are eight states that will allow a WRITE-IN Presidential Candidate, and I am asking the people in the following States to WRITE - IN my name:"ROBBY WELLS"Oregon, Wyoming, Iowa, Alabama, Delaware, New Jersey, Vermont, and New Hampshire.If you have friends and family in these eight states, I am asking you to share this strategy with them. Everyone must know our plan, and everyone must come together to implement this plan.STEP #2By winning several states as a WRITE-IN, we will ensure that Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump will not gain over 270 electoral votes. STEP #3Once all the votes are tallied, and no candidate receives over 270 electoral votes, the sitting Congress will take the top three electoral vote getters (Clinton, Trump, and Robby Wells) and vote to decide who the 45th President will be.STEP #4*The majority of Congress is Republican, which means Mrs. Clinton, who is a Left leaning Democrat, will most likely be defeated.*There will be no Democrats, and close to 70% of Republican Congressmen that will not vote for Mr. Trump, who is a Right leaning Republican, which means he will also be defeated. *That means that we can win this election as an Independent that sits in the Middle, taking the absolute best from the Left Wing and Right Wing, with a plan to restore Prosperity so that every citizen will have a chance at the American Dream. I believe our nation is about to see it's finest hour, and we are going to save our nation.WRITE-IN "ROBBY WELLS" for PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES!!!robbywells2016.com#RiseUp #RiseUpAmerica #NewBreed #RobbyWells4President#WeAreGoingToDoIt #WriteInRobbyWells
