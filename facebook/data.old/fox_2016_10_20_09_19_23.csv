During the final presidential debate, Donald J. Trump would not commit to accepting the results of the election. http://fxn.ws/2eTsxY6 #FoxNews2016
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Anita Miller | 10154713729731336_10154715003741336 | He is just being honest. There has been voter fraud in the past. In reality, he is just standing up for justice.
2 | Justin Tuttle | 10154713729731336_10154715005116336 | Remember when Gore refused to accept the state of Florida in 2000  until 36 days after the election after it was recounted. There is nothing wrong nor horrifying about it at all. Which btw, back when the mainstream media had even a shred of honesty, they actually supported Gore in his endeavor.
3 | Karen Bryson | 10154713729731336_10154715005231336 | What's horrifying is that there are currently numerous investigations ongoing in several states for voter fraud and it's only early voting!!!!
4 | Bella Ray | 10154713729731336_10154715006176336 | She finds this horrifying but killing a baby a day before it's born is totally acceptable. Her judgement is horrifying.
5 | Ann Wallace Stewart | 10154713729731336_10154715005631336 | I don't think it's horrible that he wants to verify before he accepts the election results remember what happened a few years back with the hanging Chads? Way to go Mr Trump we're all for you!!
6 | Vanessa Balon-Wahler | 10154713729731336_10154715008511336 | Is THIS really what is important? Seriously? I can't believe how much everyone is making out of this. Why aren't people dwelling on the fact that Hillary dodged and avoided answering questions?
7 | Don Miller | 10154713729731336_10154715003316336 | Its all rigged. I hope he exposes this matter. Trump for us!
8 | Monty White | 10154713729731336_10154715003411336 | That's only horrifying to you because if he checks it you know he'll find something
9 | Mike Herod | 10154713729731336_10154715002221336 | Hilary is declared to be incompetent with national security rather than a criminal by the FBI, a few hours after bill and Loretta meet secretly. Hilarys sheep accept this con willingly but draw the line at rigging elections. Heh! Sheep Я Stupid😜
10 | Omo Jesu Fagbolu Esther | 10154713729731336_10154715021166336 | Killing babies from their mother's womb isn't horrifying to Killary but Trump saying that  he might not accept the result of the election, for good reasons if I may add, she's horrified??? The woman has no soul, she's long ago sold it to Satan.
11 | Nita J. Linch | 10154713729731336_10154715004001336 | Al Gore did said the same thing,,, dems didn't mind that!   More double standards...lol
12 | Stacey Ducker | 10154713729731336_10154715022526336 | I wasn't the least surprised when Trump answered he'd wait and see if he would accept the outcome of the election. Shocking to all viewers, and the media will use that one soundbite for the next few weeks up to the election. Why? Because no candidate in the history of our country has ever said that. No candidate was bold enough to actually speak their opinion. It wasn't a canned politicians answer to appease. And hasn't that been Donald Trump from the beginning? Upsetting the apple cart from day one. He's not a politician. And even when confronted by the fact his daughter and VP running mate said he would accept the outcome of the election, he didn't waiver on his own conviction. You may not like him, you may detest him, he may make you uncomfortable, but what you can't say is that he follows the norm and feeds us what we want to hear.
13 | Sheryl Elaine Martinson | 10154713729731336_10154715016086336 | So he chose to be honest. I appreciate that. Some of us voters feel the very same way. Will I believe Hillary won the election fair and square and accept it, if she wins after all the illegal stuff she has pulled and ongoing lies she tells? I don't think so.
14 | Amanda Gorham Miller | 10154713729731336_10154715014701336 | This is not important to me. How about how Hillary wouldn't answer many of those important questions? With her corrupt background, It's hard for me to belive there won't be a rigged election too!
15 | Dean Capron | 10154713729731336_10154715005371336 | y is that horrifying ? The republicans didn't accept him even tho he is the peoples choice and I will not accept you as my President , you are a proven political loser that electorals want - not the people
16 | Michael Cline | 10154713729731336_10154715012761336 | I realize our political system is more about semantics than it is about policy and truth but can intelligent people please stop the ridiculous narrative that the media is trying to convey... if "rigged" is too tough of a word to describe our election process, fine, choose a different word, but please don't try to act like things are on the up & up when it comes to political campaigns in this country.  How does a dead person vote?  How do candidates receive more votes in certain voting precincts than there are registered voters in those districts?  Why are election officials on video bragging about voting multiple times in the same election?  How do illegal immigrants become registered voters?  How do petitions to place candidates on ballots end up being signed by people who don't even exist?  How in a country so deeply divided politically does any candidate carry a voting precinct with 100% of the votes cast in their favor?  Everything I've listed has actually happened in this country and is again happening right now.... Again, if the word "rigged" bothers you, fine, but if you're more upset by the person exposing the truth than you are with the ones committing the crimes, you're part of the problem.
17 | Ondie Jo Held | 10154713729731336_10154715007001336 | With all the proof of voter fraud running rampant in this election I wouldn't agree to concede yet either!!!! Notice how they didn't ask her the same question. It's like they already know she's going to be win...I smell a rat
18 | Laura Richardson | 10154713729731336_10154715009241336 | I was not upset by that at all! Finally someone who will not just lay down and accept what they are told. With all the videos emerging showing full intent to commit fraud, investigations into fraud such as in Ft. Worth, Texas, I do not blame him one bit.
19 | Judy Hammond | 10154713729731336_10154715007461336 | Everyone says that he is retreating from what he said a few weeks ago, but they fail to mention that many of the major fraud issues have only recently been proven
20 | Kelly Britton | 10154713729731336_10154715013791336 | I understand where Trump is coming from. It's a proven fact that the DNC colluded to rig the primaries, they have paid people to start trouble at Trump rallies, and there is information on voter fraud being posted every day. Mr Trump has every right to question the numbers should they end up to be very close. All politicians have this right. All of the hubbub is, once again, a way to deflect from all of the above. It's like shooting the messenger. In my opinion, we all should be way more upset about the things that I listed than if Trump is wiling to accept the outcome immediately.
21 | Jean Bonnot | 10154713729731336_10154715005996336 | Time to call politicians and voters in the Republican camp who expressed they will vote for Hitlery for what they are: TRAITORS to party and nation! As a Frenchman, I will not resist but happily blast them as 'Halal cheese-burger eating surrendering monkeys' ..Yes that includes the corrupt Bush family
22 | George M Jeanette Sr | 10154713729731336_10154715013521336 | What's horrifying is HRC is allowed to run for office. What's horrifying is the DOJ and FBI is in her back pocket! What's horrifying is several good military men are going down for far less than what she did .... that's horrifying!
23 | Raymond Griffith | 10154713729731336_10154715007871336 | We already know that dead people are on the voter rolls. Why would he concede the election when there is probably some funny business going on to elect KIllary.
24 | Gregory Frissora | 10154713729731336_10154715023246336 | She calls him horrifying..... Let see,she is the casual murdering of babies that she silence them;who will be there voice,they are killed in the name of a woman's right;who defend them,she will be horrible on national security
25 | Lisa Bosh Gregory | 10154713729731336_10154715008086336 | At least he didn't pivot away and blame Abe Lincoln or Putin. What ya see is what ya get with him....with her? Not so much.

Donald J. Trump said Hillary Clinton supports procedures in which babies are "ripped" from the mother's womb on the final day of pregnancy.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Stephanie Stout | 10154714236486336_10154714913566336 | Let's do a little educating this morning: Late-term abortions are not performed to save the life of the mother. Inducing premature birth or emergency cesarean sections serve that purpose. The age of viability for a fetus is 23 weeks gestation. Clinton is talking about aborting (not birthing) fetuses that are 35, 37, even 40 weeks (full term) gestation. Babies that would LIVE if they were born instead of aborted. The abortion that Hillary Clinton wants available "for women's healthcare" is one of convenience for the mother, and she is a liar when she says differently.
2 | Kyle Jacobson | 10154714236486336_10154714916696336 | She is for saving toddlers from gun violence, but is okay with killing babies a few days before they are born. She's a hypocrite, no doubt about it.
3 | Dawn Rutherford-Hockett | 10154714236486336_10154714923796336 | My baby was born at 28 weeks weighing 1 lb 14 oz.  She came out breathing and screaming like an 8 lb baby.  She is now 13 and I am thankful to God every day for giving her life!!
4 | Jim Baker | 10154714236486336_10154714912141336 | I will never forget the smiling face of the pantsuit Don when Trump brought up the video proving Democratic officials PAID hit men to incite violence at political rallies. That is text book organized crime.
5 | Nean Jamison | 10154714236486336_10154714913296336 | But, she loves babies. That's why we need to abolish the second amendment!!!  Kills me how these libs are all about the kids but, support murderous operations like planned parenthood.
6 | Chris Holguin | 10154714236486336_10154714915831336 | Hillary says that it's a disgrace that 33,000 toddlers are killed by guns every year.Then turns around and says she supports Roe vs Wade (abortion). #IRONY
7 | Cathy Grabow | 10154714236486336_10154714921201336 | Megyn Kelley is disgusting!! She has nothing better to talk about than the accusers of Trump Let it go!! No one wants to hear it anymore. The issue are what are important at this point!
8 | Peggy Ann Clark Clark | 10154714236486336_10154714913391336 | Sadly, this was & is still her theme to make everybody doubt Trump.. Simply trying to raise more questions to his base & what he stands for.She, is the one whose rhetoric continues on.   We will remain standing w/Trump no matter what she tries to throw at him.
9 | William Hunting | 10154714236486336_10154714917576336 | His terminology may be gruff but he's exactly right and I don't believe that psychopath lying manipulative treasonous woman has ever sat down with anyone she claims she has sat down with ALL LIES FROM HER
10 | Felicia McDaniel Arey | 10154714236486336_10154714936221336 | I do not care if Donald Trump called a woman fat. I do not care if he tried to sleep with a woman or if he likes "beautiful" women. I care that he sent a plane to pick up 200 Marines who were stranded after desert storm. I care that he supports our police officers and first responders. I care that he supports guns and standing behind our military. I care that he supports the death penalty and is AGAINST abortion. I care that he supports enforcing immigration laws. I care that he wants to destroy radical Islamic groups. I care that he supports COAL. These are things I care about. Him talking sexually about women does not bother me. Were they mean words? Yes. Were they words spoken in PRIVATE? Yes. Have you ever talked to your friends about the opposite sex in private and said things? I'm positive all of you have. But, News Flash!! Women have been sexualized for centuries!! Jay-Z, Lil' Jon, Lil' Wayne and every single other rapper helped establish that platform, but people are ok with music blasted all over the radio degrading women. Ever heard of Victoria Secret? Or their fashion show? Ever heard of Hooters? People are ok with that too. Until all of these things are different, women will be viewed this way. Your precious Obama couldn't change that and Hillary can't either. I feel sorry for the women Donald has belittled and said terrible things about. But I'm still much more offended by what Hillary Clinton has DONE over what Donald Trump has SAID... PERIOD!!!! So Trump doesn't do well at the debates, maybe he even sounds childish and incapable. But he is speaking the truth! Just because he's not a polished politician like Hilary or Obama doesn't mean he's unqualified to be president. He cares for this country, not growing the size of his pockets. That man has so much money he could never spend it all. He gets NOTHING out of being president! I'm standing for the man accused of saying mean words. I'll never back a woman under three different scandal investigations, possible murder at Benghazi, and the secretive email scandal which has been nothing but lies from the beginning. Trump 2016!!!Copy and paste!!! And pass it on #trumpforpresident
11 | Cassie Pulido | 10154714236486336_10154714913441336 | His choice of words were wrong yes but I think his point was she thinks it's OK to kill a baby at term. Which is disgusting.
12 | Carol Vaughn Drake | 10154714236486336_10154714925231336 | Chris Wallace: Regarding the debate on Wednesday night, Chris Wallace was by far the best moderator who has done a debate this election season. He kept everyone on schedule, showed no bias to either and forced them to stay on topic better than any other moderator.  Congratulations Chris!
13 | Nancy Foytik | 10154714236486336_10154714926526336 | What was said last night in the debate about full term babies being aborted....I am sorry but, no one can support that and  be a decent human being.
14 | Jami-Geary Mullendore | 10154714236486336_10154714924861336 | She was trying so hard to defend partial birth abortion with the rationale about the mother's health; and I watched as I believe she might have wanted to make some comment about finding out that the baby has a severe health defect...reject the imperfect!  There is NO good reasoning for partial birth abortion...it's criminal by all accounts. And Roe v Wade has absolutely NOTHING to do with women's health services, but rather everything to do with allowing a woman the right to murder - yes I said murder - an innocent, unborn life that has no say in the matter.
15 | Jamie Gibbens | 10154714236486336_10154714943246336 | She's a psycho. If a mother is days away from delivery and something is affecting her health THEY INDUCE OR DO A CESAREAN. They don't just kill the baby. She's a nut case and doesn't deserve to be up there. Sicko.
16 | Jill McGaha | 10154714236486336_10154714918616336 | I am sick . Literally after hearing her say that she knows people who did this.  NO MOTHER would ever choose her life over her childs at that point in her pregnancy.
17 | נעמי גוקמן-בן חמו | 10154714236486336_10154714918916336 | Hillary Clinton snapped last night that Donald Trump is a puppet ruler of Russia Vladimir Putin. We can only forgot to note that it is sold Putin control over one-fifth of uranium in the United States and has received fees that oil. Hillary slams back again and again baseless accusations Trump's attitude to women. We can only forgot to note that in 1975 it is entitled to protection and took complete serial rapist who raped a girl of 12 and she laughed and mocked her as a girl. Her child because of the rape unable to have children since. In addition to the campaign's budget is funded Perfidious twenty percent of funds come from Saudi Arabia. UAE. Qatar. And Bahrain. Countries not know the concepts of women's rights. democracy. Freedom of expression. Or freedom of religion. In addition to the burning of election headquarters of the Republican Party is harming the First Amendment talks about freedom of expression. And of course constitutes a serious federal crime. Needless to say, this issue has not been studied in the United States. The left-wing media in Israel and the United States reviewing this issue only in a footnote without a thorough discussion on the severity of this terrorist incident. Burning down the Republican Party I call political terrorism.
18 | Bg Caudill | 10154714236486336_10154714926231336 | Vote TRUMP- It's clear for me life vs death for a 8 pound baby. Anyone who supports killing an infant is evil. Step up and support life as millions will die if you do NOT.🐘🐘🐘
19 | Lynnette Bobowicz | 10154714236486336_10154714931886336 | If people saw the remains of these aborted babies there would be no questions . Can you imagine a pan full of bloody baby body parts? Reality folks. Sick and sad we have come to that.
20 | Cheryl Pacitto Crowley | 10154714236486336_10154714930531336 | Hillary tried to say that late term abortion, up until birth should be allowed because sometimes the health of the mother is at risk. This is an outright lie to try & gain support.. In the third trimester, clearly right before birth, that baby would survive if delivered so there is never a reason to abort (aka kill) a baby at that stage. Simply deliver the baby & mother would be totally fine.
21 | Liesl Stevenson | 10154714236486336_10154714925166336 | Hilary is such a hypocrite! I felt like when she said she supports the 2nd amendment but was concerned about toddlers killing themselves with a gun, it was pretty contradictory with her support for late term abortions. Which is it? Do you care about kids or don't you Hillary?
22 | Janet Taft | 10154714236486336_10154714928126336 | The only thing I can say is if a woman waits that long to have an abortion is they may not  be very good parental material to begin with ...but this does not excuse any of it .Late term abortion is murder . I don't condone abortions but if a woman is going to get one it needs to be done right away .
23 | Robin Block | 10154714236486336_10154714936726336 | Babies are delivered early when a mother's life is in danger. Happens all the time. I was induced early and delivered a healthy baby. Late term abortions are about killing babies, not saving lives.
24 | John Heuermann | 10154714236486336_10154714918766336 | sadly at this point those that are obviously "brain dead" Hillary voters wouldn't change their vote if she was on tape personally delivering weapons to Bin Laden or Isis. They're just that dumb. And then, there's the "Christian" whose feelings can't take voting for such a man as Trump who says he's the man for the job and we all know what's he's promised to do, but he's a cheater, a lover of self and money, and a cusser. So since some can't forgive or take a man's word he has changed they stay home thus giving us our AND our children's worse nightmare... Hillary as President. And when that happens, I for one won't have any pity on anyone who stayed home because Trump TALKED ugly 11 years ago.
25 | Andrea Reif | 10154714236486336_10154714946876336 | Her reasoning for supporting late term abortion made absolutely no sense. If a mother is in danger at a late stage of pregnancy then the baby may need to be delivered pre term with a neonatal team standing by. The baby would most likely need the NICU but certainly wouldn't need to be killed. I'm a Registered Nurse but I didn't need my nursing degree to figure that out, just morals and common sense!

"She mentions this, which is all fiction ... probably or possibly started by her and her very sleazy campaign, but I will tell you what isn't fictionalized are her emails, where she destroyed 33,000 emails criminally after getting a subpoena from the United States government." – Donald J. Trump on allegations of sexual harassment
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Wessley Newton | 10154713577946336_10154714816916336 | My favorite part of the debate was when they asked Trump if he thought the election was rigged, meanwhile earlier in the day 2 DNC staffers were fired after the O'keefe tapes showed them rigging the election, then you assclowns in the media chastised him for his response, that type of hypocrisy is priceless
2 | Smith Sean | 10154713577946336_10154714823586336 | That was a great deflection from Mr. trump lol he nailed it & forced her to go defensive on the emails which totally made her look stupid. Oh & the closing remarks by Mr trump were brilliant. loved it
3 | Quentin Evans | 10154713577946336_10154714820851336 | So she's against guns because of some deaths to "toddlers" but for abortion killing thousands more. Right on Killary
4 | Brad Nelson | 10154713577946336_10154714818191336 | Ten reasons to vote Democrat#10. I vote Democrat because I love the fact that I can now marry whatever I want. I've decided to marry my German Shepherd.#9. I vote Democrat because I believe oil companies' profits of 4% on a gallon of gas are obscene, but the government taxing the same gallon at 15% isn't.#8. I vote Democrat because I believe the government will do a better job of spending the money I earn than I would.#7. I vote Democrat because Freedom of Speech is fine as long as nobody is offended by it.#6. I vote Democrat because I'm way too irresponsible to own a gun, and I know that my local police are all I need to protect me from murderers and thieves. I am also thankful that we have a 911 service that gets police to your home in order to identify your body after a home invasion.#5. I vote Democrat because I'm not concerned about millions of babies being aborted so long as we keep all death row inmates alive and comfy.#4. I vote Democrat because I think illegal aliens have a right to free health care, education, and Social Security benefits, and we should take away Social Security from those who paid into it.#3. I vote Democrat because I believe that businesses should not be allowed to make profits for themselves. They need to break even and give the rest away to the government for redistribution as the Democrat Party sees fit.#2. I vote Democrat because I believe liberal judges need to rewrite the Constitution every few days to suit fringe kooks who would never get their agendas past the voters.And, the #1 reasonI vote Democrat is because I think it's better to pay $billions$ for oil to people who hate us, but not drill our own because it might upset some endangered beetle, gopher, or fish here in America. We don't care about the beetles, gophers, or fish in those other countries."The difference between genius and stupidity is that genius has its limits". Albert EinsteinI know you all will appreciate this definition. The best description of Obamacare so far: Remember when Nancy Pelosi said: "We have to pass it, to find out what's in it."A physician called into a radio show and said: "That's the definition of a stool sample."
5 | Gary Doan | 10154713577946336_10154714818111336 | Trump mentioned a video. I watched it after the debate. The Veritas undercover video is the biggest political bombshell in history. It makes Watergate plumbers look like school kids breaking into the teachers office, So many crimes, collusion, hate crimes and even taking advantage of violent mentally disturbed homeless people. Paid terrorists in all major cities, plus they pay legal fees and costs.$1500 in Chicago to incite violence. Hillary blamed Trump for the violence. WATCH the VIDEO, its is beyond belief it could happen in a non-communist country. The video is higher quality, real people boasting about committing crimes and their criminal network, with names, titles and ties. Watch it if you doubt it, it has gone viral on youtube.
6 | Cheryl Ann | 10154713577946336_10154714829736336 | Wow!  Missed the debate but love this video.  I'd say he put it out there very well.  What the real truth is... She should not even be allowed to run for President in the first place after all she's been proven to have done.  Good for him.
7 | Terry Carroll | 10154713577946336_10154714821596336 | Was on Mark Cubans fb page last night and saw a post of someone asking for someone to kill Donald Trump. And the media says Trump supporters are the ones trying to incite violence.
8 | Howard Carson | 10154713577946336_10154714840846336 | MODERATOR: "Hillary, please explain the Wikileaks content and corruption of your campaign." HILLARY: "The Russians are trying to control or elections! That's what we should be talking about!" TRUMP: "If you weren't such a liar and your campaign wasn't so corrupt, there would be no content for the "Russians" to hack and release!"
9 | Timothy Blair | 10154713577946336_10154714855011336 | Is it just me, or did it appear that Clinton kept looking down at the podium when responding to some of the issues, as if she was reading a scripted response ??? Quite unusual for a debate !!!
10 | Victoria Jones Shirley | 10154713577946336_10154714835126336 | The Media Seems ridged as well, Out of all the the great moments in the debate, they still focus on Tump about accepting the final outcome of the election. They looked way to much into that response.
11 | Colin Sherman | 10154713577946336_10154714823856336 | One measures a person by what he/she gives, not by what they take. We have a man in Mr Trump, who funded his own primary election campaign and part of his presidential campaign, so he could give his services to the country he loves and which gave him so much. If elected, he has refused to accept a presidential salary. He donates millions of dollars each year insisting on not being identified. He has helped hundreds of people in need anonymously- thats the man he is. His plane has flown many mercy missions to disaster areas around the world carrying much needed medical and food supplies which he paid for - and without anyone needing to ask.
12 | Jack Jenkins | 10154713577946336_10154714817916336 | Wikileaks should be ashamed for illegally revealing Hillary's illegal activities
13 | Doug Garcia | 10154713577946336_10154714903326336 | No one has mentioned, that when Chris Wallace asked Donald Trump, to comment on sexual allegations against him, and at same time asked Hillary Clinton to address sexual misconduct by Bill, that Clinton spun the conversation so that Mr. Trump answered to his question, and she NEVER addressed Bill's misconduct at all....
14 | Pete Carnicelli | 10154713577946336_10154714854331336 | I don't know about all of you, but the way she is dressed makes me feel like the only time we are going to see her is when she appears on all state sponsored television programs and every entrance to a government building....and in a mandated framed photo in everyone's house. And on all our food... and when we have to apply for our national identification cards. Also I feel her power suit says "supreme leader" more than it says President of the United States of America. You know, now that I think about it I'm almost sure Kim from N. Korea has that same outfit except in grey. This is turning into the Hunger Games for real. So what I'm really waiting for is finding out what district I'm going to belong to.
15 | Dori Griffith Blades | 10154713577946336_10154714887666336 | Well, she was cheating again!  If you go back and watch when the camera panned over, you could see the TelePrompter on her podium lit up!  Also, she was using signals across her chin and cheek again!So once again, she cheated and got help again!!One more thing.. when she accused him of something, he answered. When he came back and asked her a question like the emails, she did not respond and attacked again! Nasty woman!I will not change my mind!  I'm angry!Trump/Pence2016🇺🇸
16 | Jennifer Burrus | 10154713577946336_10154714861416336 | I have read comments on all the different news sites....an overwhelming majority of people are for Trump! The media is biased wanting us to believe otherwise by rigging the polls in Hillary's favor. ....this is so when Hillary becomes president we aren't surprised and it doesn't look rigged.
17 | Nelwyn Hymel Hebert | 10154713577946336_10154714870946336 | Language is powerful tool. Hillary Clinton is a master at the political language that Trump has yet to acquire. She uses the vocabulary of politicians to weave a deceitful web that sounds appealing to many in mainstream America. She's been rehearsing that script for 30 years. Trump speaks plainly without the jargon of Washington. She uses that language to disguise the corrupt, criminal behavior that she's engaged in for all those years. This is a sly, evil tactic used by dictators for centuries. Don't let Trump's inability to spew political rhetoric fool you. He knows what needs to be done and will put the right people in the right places to do it.
18 | Scott Mattern | 10154713577946336_10154714820326336 | And she can't say crap about it because SHE DOES NOT RECALL. ;)
19 | Anthony Musa | 10154713577946336_10154714886476336 | I would like to express my gratitude to Mr. Wallace for conducting a debate within the true spirit of Journalism.  He was an excellent moderator he was fair to each candidate and allowed the process to go forward to allow the People to make their own minds. The other Moderators should take note and learn from his example of how to do it right. Thanks
20 | Eduardo Cotto | 10154713577946336_10154714845561336 | I took exception to Hillary thinking , she would be a better commander in chief. Last night she gave away national security information. She let the world know , we have a four minute response time in a nuclear event, and no body has said a word about. She telegraph our secret !!!
21 | Ondie Jo Held | 10154713577946336_10154714837596336 | She's a pathetic excuse for a woman. She had the nerve to pass off the violence at his rallies AFTER he pointed out it was her and her goons that caused it. She won't give back the millions places like Qatar and Saudi gave her, she wouldn't comment on the pay to play schemes, she didn't say how far along she supports abortion (it's THIRTY SIX WEEKS!!!!) but Trump not committing to willingness to concede and calling her a nasty woman is the talk of the debate? Please. Liberal media at its best
22 | Greg Gooch | 10154713577946336_10154714956646336 | Lets examine a little closer. I'm really trying to figure out why so many are in favor of Hillary. Everyone talks about how bad Trump is. Ok, I won't say he's perfect. In fact even though working at the Taj was a great job and one of the best and most enjoyable I ever had, I still was never a huge Trump fan before. but I did admire his ability to do get things done and do what he says he will do. When a close associate died in a helicopter crash he said at a ceremony his family will be taken care of for the rest of their lives, housing, education, medical etc. That's a pretty good boss if you ask me.Hillary on the other hand, said in her closing statement; she's going to stand up for the average American. She said we need everybody; we need their talents, skills and ambitions and she'll stand up for families, income and education. She'll get the money from the wealthy. Does that include her and members of Congress or are they excluded like they always are? Well between her and Bill they've been in office for the past thirty years or more. The suspicious murders began in Arkansas. Friends, associates, interns, Bills lovers, lawyers, prosecutors; anyone who threatened their future success; all unexplained deaths by bullet in the back of the head or hanging in their living room. If they're not killed off, they're discredited and destroyed in the media. Is this what she means when she says she knows the Presidency? These are people with no reason to commit suicide. All young, in their prime of life, all very closely tied to the Clinton's. No evidence, no investigations no arrests. Google it! The list is up to around sixty people that we know about about half a dozen since the email scandal including the guy who hacked into their account in Hungary. Funny; you never hear about this in the media...How's that promise going so far?Aside from all the murders; how is the average American making out with thirty years of Clinton's? Our manufacturers have nearly all disappeared, with more leaving every day; the latest include: Ford and GM; small business is hurting, in favor of the Wal Marts who sell nothing but products Made in China; our family income is the lowest it's been in decades, our economy is failing, our educational system is failing our children, healthcare is failing everyone from the elderly to veterans to children, (we've spent over 25K in co pays and non covered office visits and procedures in the last year alone that would have cost us maybe a few hundred at most before Obamacare and next to nothing when I used to work for Trump since my healthcare cost me $2 a week w/ $5 co pays,)families are failing, so many parents are failing their children. Police are being shot and killed every single day for no reason; Flags are being burned, Christians are being slaughtered, the Middle East is on fire, We now need to go back and fix her and Obama's failed negotiations. There's Ben Ghazi; What difference does it make, the email scandals, the repeated lies to the entire world? She's for women, gays, and children but takes hundreds of millions of dollars from the countries who behead women and slaughter gays, and she supports abortion of even fully grown children because women can get cancer screenings?She points to her experience; so what the hell are these big accomplishments she talks about, besides being part of all that is wrong in Washington? Isn't the idea to clean up Washington and break up the strangle hold of politicians on this country?
23 | Joanne M Rizzi | 10154713577946336_10154714901576336 | She was rude, I think she is on drugs, really if you watch Hillary in her debates, speeches, interview's she starts out perky then after about a half an hour peters out.
24 | Rodney Liptak | 10154713577946336_10154714855486336 | She is an American Disgrace and should have lost her security clearances and been ineligible to run on day 1 of the email investigation, which was rigged by Obama so he would have not to testify as a witness at her trial since he was ok with her using a private server!
25 | Susan Compton Allen | 10154713577946336_10154714893041336 | Did anybody notice how dazed Hillary Clinton got on certain questions? My husband and I thought something was wrong with her. It came out when Trump mentioned wikileaks. Go back and watch her response her eyes are almost closed and she was dazed babbling on about nothing that made any sense!

A high school student in Oklahoma, said she used her cell phone to record a teacher saying, "To be white is to be racist," during a lecture on "how to heal the racial divide."
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Ginger Spelts | 10154712823671336_10154714721346336 | Hillary gave out classified information last night by telling the whole world that our nuclear response time is 4 minutes. How stupid was that!? OMG and not a peep from the corrupt media!
2 | Steve Parriman | 10154712823671336_10154714714961336 | This statement tells me that this woman is clearly racist herself, maybe she should just speak for herself.
3 | Stacey Joubert | 10154712823671336_10154714717236336 | The liberals are voting for a gender in this election, the way they voted for a race in the last election. I can't wait for Caitlyn Jenner to run for office.  I'll make a fortune selling bibs to salivating liberals 😂😂😂😂
4 | ED Schmidt | 10154712823671336_10154714733341336 | There is no place in the educational system for teachers and professors who teach hate. None . They should be fired when they try to influence young minds be it in high school or college. Fired !
5 | Silas DerayzAngeles | 10154712823671336_10154714753636336 | We all need to accept that racism is now on the upper lane.It is time we show appreciation for police in particular,who do a very commendable job.Im black,and i do not think rallying against the so called"white police" for killing of black men really bore any fruits.Most White police a doing as good,except a bunch of "radical police",who are trying to put every other police in one bracket of RACIST.It's time we support white/black police who is doing a great service for each of us no matter our race.
6 | Justin Cantrell | 10154712823671336_10154714718821336 | Well I guess I'm racist. No stopping me now from calling other races out on their BS, right? No? Well screw you too liberal media.
7 | David Hill | 10154712823671336_10154714778721336 | That's just stupid. No one can help how they're born. How you act after maturing determines if you're racist or not. That teacher needs to be fired and re educated
8 | Christie Rebstock | 10154712823671336_10154714721366336 | The fact this "teacher"is able to have enough intelligence to get a degree amazes me! Their ignorance like many others causes the racial divide!
9 | Janel Woiwod | 10154712823671336_10154714735136336 | 1st of all, clearly this "Philosophy" Teacher was hired for the wrong position. Schools need to hire qualified Teachers! Instead of the Districts wasting their budgets on filling the pockets of Administration and wasteful spending they should be investing in qualified Teachers.2nd of all...This moron was not teaching Philosophy! This was straight up racism and a political agenda of their own opinion. I'd like to known if this curriculum was pre-approved by the school!!!As a parent I would be completely outraged regardless of what race was the subject matter was. This was NOT a college class!!Just my opinion...
10 | Mary Ann Phillips Snell | 10154712823671336_10154714739791336 | This is unacceptable !  Hopefully the teacher will be removed - there is no room in our classrooms for this kind of thing - it is racist and we do not need teachers teaching racism to our kids - good for you to the student who turned this in -
11 | Jay Gee | 10154712823671336_10154714744446336 | Aaaand why wasn't the teacher's race revealed?Oh, cause you're only allowed to portray white people in a negative light in the media. My bad, forgot.
12 | Logan Peerless | 10154712823671336_10154714753716336 | Really? I guess I was just born racist... NOT.. At no time in my life have I been racist. Racism is horrible. I believe everyone should be treated with respect of how I want to be treated. This is ridiculous and people actually believe it... That is the sad part. The teacher saying this is the worst part. You can't tell children that because you're asking for people to put hate in their hearts and make them racist in the process towards white people. Can we all stop saying different races and just call each other Americans. Caucasian American, African American, Mexican American, Latin American. Etc.. They all have one very distinct similarity and that is AMERICAN. When we finally push race out, I believe racism will end.
13 | Ruth Miller | 10154712823671336_10154714732366336 | Great example of Liberals trying to Destroy Children's Self Esteem and make Children feel Guilty and Miserable for their entire lives because they were born to the wrong parents.
14 | Sarah Gore | 10154712823671336_10154714744136336 | Being racist is a choice it has nothing to do with skin. You choose to be a jerk or not to be saying " I can't help being a racist my skin made me do it "is bs and a cop out. Own your choice and be open to discussion and growth
15 | Jon Gunkel | 10154712823671336_10154714718861336 | This is the problem with schools. People like this are teaching our children
16 | Kristy Fouty | 10154712823671336_10154714750311336 | She would have been fired on the spot if she would have said every black is a thug or every Mexican is illegal but I guess it's OK to teach this kind of garbage when your only stereotyping against " white racist "  NO WONDER THE US IS GOING TO HELL!!!!!
17 | Cole Brown | 10154712823671336_10154714780451336 | Racism is the dumbest thing ever! How does anyone have hate toward someone else's race, or pride in ones own race, if NOBODY had a CHOICE in his or her race. We play no role whatsoever in choosing our race, gender, nationality, or ancestry. So where does pride or hate come from?? Smh
18 | Cheryl H Onidi | 10154712823671336_10154714810166336 | The color of ones skin does not make a person racist. That cannot be controlled. The character and actions of a person determines racism and it exists in every race. I will not apologize for being born white.
19 | Nicole Zaccagnini | 10154712823671336_10154714770246336 | I had a college professor that taught "Interracial and Intercultural Communications" and after hearing her say for three weeks straight that "if you're white, you're racist," I challenged her and asked if other races could show signs of racism... and after dancing around my question, she kicked me out of class.
20 | Christie Cooper | 10154712823671336_10154714813871336 | If this had been a white teacher and he has made a negative comment against any other race, he would have already been fired.
21 | Melissa Diotte | 10154712823671336_1092309804223847 | The correct term is prejudice. There is only one race. There are many ethnicities. Prejudice is found in all ethnicities. It is not an exclusive thing. Ugliness and hatred of something or someone different from your group is found in all. To claim otherwise is to be hypocritical  or superior. All little humans are born without prejudice. They are conditioned by the expressed beliefs and values within their family, community and society. The presence of prejudice is the fault of everyone regardless of the color of their skin. Until we embrace that and stop blaming and pointing fingers and stop making excuses; start being personally accountable for what we condition our children to believe; it will continue.
22 | Michelle Hunt | 10154712823671336_1776775079261381 | Saying "to be white is to be racist" is just like saying to be black is to be a thug.... Absolutely Ridiculous!If the roles were reversed and a teacher would have called blacks thugs they would have been fired immediately.
23 | Jessica Artz | 10154712823671336_10154714756311336 | Wtfrigg?! You can only poke the bear so much before it bites! Quit calling all whites racist! We frankly are sick of being labeled racist by obvious racists! MLK is literally rolling in the grave!
24 | Mike Czibovic | 10154712823671336_10154714765076336 | All this Politically Correct crap has gone to far and the teacher needs to get off the stick. I was born in the United States, so, by definition, I'm a native American. I'm also a white guy, so the other Native-Americans will need to adjust, or find another name to describe themselves if the hyphen isn't enough. After all, they were immigrants at one time, too.As far as this article goes, the teacher needs to apologize and get some retraining. Racism is rampant enough in this country with out that knucklehead adding fuel to the fire.
25 | Mark Hennington | 10154712823671336_10154714777661336 | Of all the so-called races of the world none have reached out and ventured forth to contact and learn about other races than the white skinned europeons. They gave spanned yhe world to trade, learn and bring the message of a loving caring God to the world. Yes there are evil men who exploited and deceived among them. But the White race has almost single handedly done more to bring the world together through trade and freedom. Rather than some seeking to emulate the good, they have chosen to accentuate the bad.

1 | Christina Miller | 10154712910876336_10154714656856336 | Fantastic that someone realized the young girl's Pain and stepped in to do the right thing; and that it was a student, even better!!!!!😄
2 | Rhonda Xenakis Mazza | 10154712910876336_10154714706091336 | These kind of stories restore our hope in humanity everyday. Beautiful. What a fine young man and his parents should be proud that they raised him well! And the story reminds us of the sacrifices our military make every single day! God Bless our troops 💗🙏🏻
3 | Louis Mosca | 10154712910876336_10154714721661336 | What a ridiculous event? You mean actual leaders of a school system chose to do this and did not have enough intelligence to know what this would do???.
4 | Vivian Mullins Mitchell | 10154712910876336_10154714867146336 | What a heartless cheer coach!  Why would you put a routine together knowing a child didn't have a partner and just leave her standing alone?  Thankfully that young man had a sweet heart to help.
5 | Ronnie Wilkinson | 10154712910876336_10154714658516336 | A great story, The parents of the young man have done an outstanding job. Must be very proud.  I grew up with my dad in Vietnam,, I know it met a lot to the little girl.
6 | Becky Womble Nethercutt | 10154712910876336_10154714839886336 | He's an awesome young man!! The world would be so much better off with more people with such consideration and kindness. Even though mom missed the memo, I wish the cheer coaches would have done something to resolve the issue before it came to this...
7 | Jackie Brand Buckner | 10154712910876336_10154714861351336 | What an amazing young man!! Wouldn't it have been great if they announced that this little girl's day was deployed serving our country!
8 | Alyce Alvarez | 10154712910876336_10154714860706336 | People you can't cater to everyone !!! My daughter had donuts with dad every year and sometimes he can go and sometimes he can't due to work reasons don't mean we are gonna ruin it for the rest 🙄😒 !! In that case we should not celebrate Father's Day because not everyone has one , halloween because not everyone can afford a costume , Christmas because not everyone can buy gifts !!! No just stop !!! ..... On another note so happy to see this young man stepping up and knowing something was wrong , glad he made her day . At the end of the day she knows her dad is there in spirit.
9 | Zoë Ruckman | 10154712910876336_10154715021341336 | Growing up, I hated "father daughter" things, as my father was usually at sea. Now that divorce rates and unwed mothers are so much higher, I don't understand why they inflict such things on kids. Good on the high school kid though, more sense than the adults
10 | Corey Savoie | 10154712910876336_10154715033081336 | Awesome thing this young man did for this sweet girl!!! He had to have been brought up to proper and his parents must be proud!!! This is the America I know and want my kids to grow up with!!!!
11 | Beverly Bart | 10154712910876336_10154714957511336 | It is the stories like this, that remind me of the real people in the world. Not what is playing out in the elections, where there are so many lies, so many doing dishonorable things, saying awful things, tearing people apart. Here is one young man standing up for a young girl, whose father is out serving his country. Now this is something truly inspiring and important.
12 | Matija Močnik | 10154712910876336_10154715029801336 | My dad left this morning and went on a 6-months deployment in Kosovo so I can imagine how she felt but her dad isn't just a soldier on a deployment he is a hero! Proud of her dad and her family!
13 | Thomas Franks | 10154712910876336_10154714745021336 | Glad to know Hillary did so well. Now it is time to wrap up this election and put it to bed. I have been following Hillary since her primary race against Obama. If you recall, Clinton got more popular votes than Obama. She has always been a serious contender and fighter. This gave her more experience. The election of President Obama was a good thing. Now it is time for the baton to be handed over to Hillary Clinton. It is time for all to come together and give Hillary trhe respect and the Presidency she deserves. I ask that we give her a resounding victory by giving her the house and the senate. So many people in our country and in our world have so much to gain in her Presidency. She is the symbol of compassion, love and hope. Let us all join her.
14 | Danielle Rives Weeks | 10154712910876336_10154715031081336 | An amazing young man who has been raised right! As the wife of someone who has been deployed, this really pulled at my heartstrings; for I am also a mother. <3
15 | Sam Fuentes | 10154712910876336_10154714748131336 | Nice, but I can't help to think about all the working men who often miss events like this, pipeliners, truck drivers, traveling plant workers, etc.
16 | Tina Marie Garber | 10154712910876336_10154714662211336 | What a sweet young man. So glad he was her hero for the event.
17 | Crystal Salvador Hurley | 10154712910876336_10154714708241336 | Very kind young man for doing what he did. Shame on the adults in charge of the cheerleaders for not respecting her father serving away from home.
18 | Steve Huber | 10154712910876336_10154714759341336 | I applaud him. And wonder why the leader would plan something involving the fathers if they knew her dad couldn't be there.
19 | Kim Medina | 10154712910876336_10154714693446336 | This is the America I want back more. Thank you to both men, the one serving and the one who filled in for him
20 | Mark N Lorishay | 10154712910876336_10154714686496336 | There are still good hearted people. This was very overwhelming to read so touching!
21 | Mike Plummer | 10154712910876336_10154714674361336 | There might be hope for future of this country yet. Momma and Daddy y'all raised one hell of a young man. Bravo.
22 | Susan Wilson-Schwahn | 10154712910876336_10154714661061336 | A fine young man. That boys parents did a wonderful job and should be quite proud.
23 | Maureen Heath | 10154712910876336_10154714686336336 | This young man has so much heart! Twice now in the past week, San Antonio youth have been on the national stage!
24 | Susan Hochlander | 10154712910876336_10154714681511336 | I just think this young man is the best. I feel so proud of him!

"This is like Tammany Hall politics of ... two centuries ago."

Mayor Rudy Giuliani reacted to allegations that Democratic operatives paid people to create violence at Donald J. Trump rallies. http://bit.ly/2dBLlsV
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Jeff-Kristi Molyet | 10154714008481336_10154714588616336 | Why is it when audio recordings of trump leak, (obtained illegally because he did not know he was being recorded) the left all dive in and thrive on it! Then we have audio and video that are shown in several different instances of things being done illegally  and the left say it is a lie and scam, edited, and illegally obtained! Double standards....again!
2 | Tina Meeks | 10154714008481336_10154714623701336 | If the Democrats paid to create violence at Trump's rallies, I believe they paid all those women to come forward and falsely accuse Mr. Trump of attacking them.
3 | Teresita Golkar | 10154714008481336_10154714593956336 | This debate clearly shows she is a very dishonest person, always blaming Trump when she cannot answer the question and switching the topic!
4 | Karen Jalaba | 10154714008481336_10154714615126336 | The left, lying machine, will never get my support! Hillary got away, without answering any questions regarding her illegal activities!
5 | Sylvain Ruest | 10154714008481336_10154714560221336 | Attention Visitors: The Trumpanzees are currently in the midst of one of their frequent poo flinging fests. For your own well-being please do not attempt to engage, inform or feed the animals as they process their grief, but feel free to scroll through and observe their antics as they rage among themselves.Management greatly appreciates your patience and self-discipline.
6 | Ron Jensen | 10154714008481336_10154714824111336 | Sometimes I wish I could channel my thoughts, because when she called him dangerous last night, the first thing I thought I would've said had I been standing there was "Secretary Clinton, I'm happy to put the American public's minds at ease where that is concerned, because on any given day I'm far less dangerous than you are corrupt."I thought that might've been a good reply.
7 | Joe Barry | 10154714008481336_10154714718441336 | Get ready for a LANDSLIDE Trump victory in America, it's going to be a huge win for American sovereignty and the final death blow to Globalism (new world order).. The Majority of Americans are voting for Trump because they are sick of business as usual in Washington DC and the American people are fed up with the criminality/corruption that runs rampant in the Federal Government.. There is a Monster vote just hiding under the surface and election day it's going to be seen, so many closet Trump supporters.. Trump = American sovereignty and Hillary Clinton = Globalism (new world order)... Anyone voting for Clinton seriously needs their heads examined.. Trump is the real deal and is not a Puppet to the Globalists. That's why the Zionist mass media, both political parties and the entire Globalist establishment are attacking Trump in every direction possible... The Globalists are losing control every step of the way and the desperation is extremely obvious.
8 | Emily P. Justingham | 10154714008481336_10154714639891336 | As long as they talk issues- and not media-created hit pieces on Trump- Trump is the winner. Trump obliterated Hillary in debate No. 3. He crushed her- talking about her corruption- and defended the bogus scandals against him, well.
9 | Sandy Vanamburgh | 10154714008481336_10154714792371336 | I think she made a big fool of herself  when she said she was in the situation room monitoring the shooting of Binladen when Trump was on TV  but she was secretary of state Trump was a private citizen when would you expect him to do. That had to be one of the dumbest thing she said.
10 | Shira Song | 10154714008481336_10154714854926336 | Watergate was child's play compared to the illegal corrupt cheating done by Hillary's campaign. These people are evil to the absolute core and obviously either never learned right from wrong or if they did, have totally rejected right and purposely chosen to lie cheat and steal to get what they want. Power over other people. They are self serving selfish deviants.
11 | Dan Burnzinsky | 10154714008481336_10154714708851336 | If people want 4 more years of the same government corruption , LIES , debt , no jobs, people shooting at cops, cities burned down , healthcare going up till you can NOT afford it , then vote for Hillary ! But don`t cry when we are attacked , illegals are stealing you`re jobs and getting better care then you . Illegals pouring into this country . Crime , murders and rape by ILLEGALS . Its what you Hillary voters want . There will NEVER be a change in our life time .
12 | Mary M Odum | 10154714008481336_10154714818341336 | How can Trump or anyone respect the Government when they let someone that they know is a crooked liar run for President??? All that the Clinton's and now they are saying Obama maybe involved and knowing what was going on people are saying did terrible things at the Rally's even. She is playing the people with her promises and lies... VOTE TRUMP/PENCE
13 | Jerry Richmond | 10154714008481336_10154714679871336 | Why has Fox News not explored Hillary's use of anti-psychotics? It's really obvious from her behavior and physical issues like the head rolling, collapsing, and fear of releasing your medical records... not to mention that horrid rage of hers.
14 | Neda von Radoic-Knowles | 10154714008481336_10154714988791336 | Two DNC staffers were fired upon O'Keefe tapes showing they rigged the election.  Trump was condemned for saying "election is rigged"....Hypocrisy in large volume...never mentioned by anybody on Hillary's side.
15 | Colin Sherman | 10154714008481336_10154714824686336 | One measures a person by what he/she gives, not by what they take. We have a man in Mr Trump, who funded his own primary election campaign and part of his presidential campaign, so he could give his services to the country he loves and which gave him so much. If elected, he has refused to accept a presidential salary. He donates millions of dollars each year insisting on not being identified. He has helped hundreds of people in need anonymously- thats the man he is. His plane has flown many mercy missions to disaster areas around the world carrying much needed medical and food supplies which he paid for - and without anyone needing to ask.
16 | Talmadge Beau Garrison | 10154714008481336_10154714886596336 | Why are yall not reporting about hillary ripping babies from the womb instead of this nonsense that every canidates waits to see if election was rigged ...just ask al gore about the hanging tags in florida
17 | Arthur Netteler | 10154714008481336_10154714564706336 | Fox News... Fox & Friends First... Mr. Trump WON!.. The moment I saw that same LIGHT shinning from INSIDE of Hillary Clinton's Podium, as we saw on the First Debate. And my Wife counted 113 Times that Hillary Clinton looked DOWN at her Podium (and that was just when we could see Hillary on Camera)! Compared to 19 Times Mr. Trump looked down at his Podium. And there was NO LIGHT shinning from inside of Mr. Trump's Podium.
18 | Connie Poe | 10154714008481336_10154715033861336 | Connie Poe shared Rita Rosser Baker's post.13 hrs · Rita Rosser Baker16 hrs · Borrowed from a wise friend:You hate Hillary? READ it. You hate Trump? READ it. You think there's no choice? READ it. And, read it with your grown-up hat on. READ THIS. Read every single word. It'll take you about three minutes. Be sure to read to the end (take a few minutes and read all of it!)I consider myself a conservative and do truly believe our country is at a political/economic/moral/social crossroads. I need to let you know I could/would never vote for Hillary Clinton to lead this country. To me, she represents everything that is wrong with our current political structure. On the flip side, I look and listen to Donald Trump and I cringe at every rude, insulting comment he makes. If you find yourself in a similar state of mind, please read the following article: A Message For Christians About Donald Trump. Here's a famous joke about God and how he talks to us."A deeply faithful Christian man is stuck on roof at home with massive flooding up to the 2nd floor. Rowboat comes. He says "No, I'm waiting for God. I prayed and I know he's coming." 2nd Rowboat. "No, I'm waiting for God." 3rd Rowboat. "No, I'm waiting for God."Water rises. The man drowns. Now he's meeting God in heaven. The religious man says, "Where were you God? I prayed. I was faithful. I asked you to save me. Why would you abandon me?"God says, "Hey, I sent you 3 rowboats." Did you ever consider Trump is our rowboat?Maybe God is trying to tell us something important--that now is not the time for a "nice Christian guy" or a "gentleman" or a typical Republican powder puff. Maybe now is the time for a natural born killer, a ruthless fighter, a warrior. Because right about now we need a miracle, or America is finished. Maybe the rules of gentlemen don't apply here. Maybe a gentleman and "all-around nice Christian" would lead us to slaughter.Or do you want another Mitt Romney, Bob Dole, John McCain, Gerald Ford or Paul Ryan? Did any of them win? Did they lead the GOP to "the promised land?" Did they change the direction of America? No, because if you don't win, you have no say.Paul Ryan couldn't even deliver his own state, Wisconsin! And as leader of the House, Paul Ryan rolls over to Obama like my dog rolls over for a scrap of food, or a steak bone. Nice, but obedient. I mean Paul Ryan...not my dog. My dog is actually a pretty good defender and loyal.Maybe God is knocking on your door loudly, but you're not listening. Maybe God understands we need a "war leader" at this moment in time. Maybe God understands if we don't win this election, America is dead. It's over. The greatest nation in world history will be gone. Finished. Kaput. Adios.And with one last breath, maybe what we need to save us at the last second, is someone different. Someone you haven't ever experienced before-- because you weren't raised in rough and tumble New York where nothing good gets accomplished unless you're combative, aggressive, outrageous, on offense at all times, and maybe just a tad arrogant too.Someone with a personality you've never seen on stage at your church. Maybe, just maybe, being a nice gentlemanly Christian would not beat Hillary and her billion dollars, and her best friends in the media who will unleash the dogs of hell upon the GOP nominee.I guess you think God is only nice and gentlemanly. Really? Then you've missed the whole point of the Bible. When necessary, God is pretty tough. When necessary, God strikes with pain, death and destruction. When necessary, God inflicts vengeance.Maybe you think God couldn't possibly be associated with someone like Trump. Trump is too vicious, rude and crude. When we won WWII, was God "nice?" Were we gentlemanly when defeating Hitler? Were we gentlemanly when firebombing Germany?Were we gentlemanly when dropping atomic bombs on Japan? Is God ever "nice" on the battlefield? Or does he send us vicious SOB's like General George S. Patton so the good guys can defeat evil? It's pretty clear to me God sends unique people to be "war leaders." That's a different role than a pastor or church leader. God understands that.And maybe it's time to re-define "nice." Maybe Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan aren't nice at all--because they led us to defeat. And losing again would mean the end of America. And God can't allow that. Maybe Romney and Ryan mean well, but the road to hell is paved with good intentions. Or maybe they're just jealous they had their chance and blew it. Maybe they'd rather help elect Hillary than allow a Trump victory that would make them look weak, feckless and incompetent."Even the youths shall faint and be weary, And the young men shall utterly fall, But those who wait on the Lord shall renew their strength; They shall mount up with wings like eagles, They shall run and not be weary, They shall walk and not faint." (Isiah 40:30-31)God is about miracles. We don't need a "nice guy" or a "gentleman" right now. It's the 4th quarter and we're losing 14-0. We need a miracle. So let me repeat my message to Christians: "YOU'RE MISSING THE BOAT."I believe Trump is our miracle. I believe Trump is our rowboat. Except he's more like a battleship! No one is saying Trump is perfect. No one is saying Trump is a perfect conservative. But he is a patriot. He is a warrior. He is a capitalist. He is the right man, at the right time. Yes, he's a bit rude and crude and offensive. But that may make him the perfect warrior to save America, American exceptionalism, capitalism and Judeo-Christian values. The choice should be easy for Christians. It's Trump...or it's the end of the American dream.

20 | Robert Kerecz | 10154714008481336_10154714597801336 | Your analyst calling Clinton' s 2A answer reasonable? Really? On line sales and gun show loophole? Do any of you people have any idea what you are talking about?
21 | Etop Inyang | 10154714008481336_10154714696331336 | The founding fathers of America must have meant well on the institutionalisation of democracy. Those principles have been ambushed by American present leadership. A ruling political party, paying thugs to disrupt the campaign rally of of its rival political party? In United States of America? Strange.
22 | Jeanine McAfee | 10154714008481336_10154714990421336 | It's not just about what damage Hillary Clinton can do in 4 years people! She will appoint supreme court justices... Far far left supreme court ... the constitution will be made irrelavent! That's why we need everyone to vote.. it's never been more important. If you have adult children that aren't registered go to the library, pick up the form. Have them fill it out in front of you... and Mail it for them. Drive them to the polls and have a nice ‘We Voted as a family to save our nation’ Dinner.

25 | Thomas Franks | 10154714008481336_10154714744606336 | Glad to know Hillary did so well. Now it is time to wrap up this election and put it to bed. I have been following Hillary since her primary race against Obama. If you recall, Clinton got more popular votes than Obama. She has always been a serious contender and fighter. This gave her more experience. The election of President Obama was a good thing. Now it is time for the baton to be handed over to Hillary Clinton. It is time for all to come together and give Hillary trhe respect and the Presidency she deserves. I ask that we give her a resounding victory by giving her the house and the senate. So many people in our country and in our world have so much to gain in her Presidency. She is the symbol of compassion, love and hope. Let us all join her.

1 | Keri Ellison | 10154714137801336_10154714459581336 | As an OB/Labor and Delivery nurse I am sorry (actually no I'm not) BUT something that really pissed me off is when Hillary said it is okay to have a late term abortion to protect the mother's life. Ummm NO Hillary, that is called having an emergency cesarean section NOT an abortion of a baby AKA MURDER!!! What normal compassionate human being thinks that way????
2 | Todd Harrington | 10154714137801336_10154714395276336 | Keep this in mind : Donald Trump did not steal your money. Donald Trump did not raise your taxes. Donald Trump did not quadruple the price of food. Trump is not stirring a race war. Trump did not leave any US soldiers in Benghazi to be slaughtered and desecrated by Muslims. Trump did not send the US Navy to fight for Syrian Al-Qaeda. Trump did not arm ISIS and systematically exterminate Christians throughout the Middle East. Trump did not betray Israel. Trump did not provide financing and technology to Iran's nuclear weapons program. Trump did not give our military secrets to China. Trump did not remove our nuclear missile shield in Poland at the behest of Russia. Trump did not shrivel our military, and betray our veterans. Trump did not cripple our economy. Trump did not increase our debt to 20 trillion dollars. Trump did not ruin our credit, twice. Trump did not double African American unemployment. Trump did not increase welfare to a record level for eight years. Trump did not sign a law making it legal to execute, and imprison Americans. Trump did not set free all of terrorists in Guantanamo bay. Trump did not steal your rights, violate US Constitutional law, or commit treason, hundreds of times. Yet Trump is being ripped apart in the news, non stop. Barrack Hussein Obama, Hillary Clinton and the criminals occupying our government, are not. The media is the Democratic Party. Save our culture. Stop listening to them..!! Please copy and Paste
3 | Andy Williams | 10154714137801336_10154714396061336 | She's ok with a baby being aborted on its dues date. That is murder in my opinion. Save The babies Vote Donald J. Trump
4 | Paull Randy | 10154714137801336_10154714395971336 | A President who wants to see late abortions has simply gone mad. Since when has late abortions EVER been a suitable task to endorse?
5 | David Burgin | 10154714137801336_10154714409676336 | POINTS TO PONDER BEFORE ELECTION DAY :copied If you are Gay, why are you voting for Hillary? She wants to bring in hundreds of thousands of refugees that believe all Gays should be executed.If you are Black, why are you voting for Hillary? She admires Margaret Sanger and defends Planned Parenthood. They want to abort as many black babies as possible. "Exterminate the Black Race because they are like weeds." Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.If you are a Christian, why are you voting for Hillary Clinton? She wrote her Senior Thesis on Saul Alinsky. He dedicated his book "Rules for Radicals" to Lucifer, The Devil? She says he was and still is her mentor.If you are a Veteran, in the military, or closely related to a military member, why are you voting for Hillary? She left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again. They called for help but the help was told to stand down.If you have factory job, why are you voting for Hillary? She supported TPP. Factory workers are being laid off because jobs are going overseas. Don't forget the deals she made with China. She also welcomes open borders and for illegals to get benefits with YOUR tax money.If you are poor, why are you voting for Hillary? She is supporting Wall street and all the big banks. Big banks keep the poor, poor by destroying the poor man's credit by allowing medical bills and collections to affect your credit scores so you can pay higher interest rates than the rich. - Taking as much of the little money you earn.If you are a woman, how can you vote for Hillary? She has buried all of Bill's rape victims under the rug. Remember the little girl that was raped? She defended the rapist and laughed about it later.If you carry a gun, and believe in the Constitution, how can you vote for Hillary? She wants to eliminate the NRA, take your guns, and abolish the second amendment.If you breathe, why would you vote for Hillary? She has left a trail of dead people that did not agree with her or knew too much!
6 | Lorraine Montantes | 10154714137801336_10154714435676336 | Can somebody tell me why the media is in such a up roar because Trump wouldn't commit to excepting the election results when Hillary Clinton didn't commit either. Chris Wallace didn't ask her. He just let her rant on about Trumps answer then just moved on to the next question.
7 | Diane Mullette | 10154714137801336_10154714406206336 | This issue alone should be enough to defeat her. How anyone can support killing a baby up until the day of birth is no different than Mengele.
8 | Carolyn Coppola | 10154714137801336_10154714590781336 | What medical issue in late term pregnancy warrants an abortion versus delivery of a baby????   Oh you just found out your child has a birth defect? Isn't that a form of genocide, kill anyone who is handicapped???
9 | Mikal Ceegee | 10154714137801336_10154714415726336 | She stood on the stage and LAUGHED when the mass murder of gays and women by her donors was mentioned. She finds murdering gays funny? She finds murdering women humorous? It was bad enough for her to flat out REFUSE to return donations from countries who murder gays and women, but then she had to LAUGH at what they do?
10 | Dina Sawyer Wambolt | 10154714137801336_10154714459336336 | She hate guns but she love and support unborn baby to rip out in the women womb...to kill them.. sick and she evil.. hope God punish her....Trump 2016

12 | Stephanie Pitt | 10154714137801336_10154714438391336 | I bet if Donald Trump were of a PC accepted culture or religion - who just happened to be against Abortion no one would say a thing. And plus, I understand that women have full rights over their bodies but what about the rights of the unborn child? Do they not possess any rights at all? Just my opinion.
13 | Kathy Justice | 10154714137801336_10154714557636336 | HRC says that the government has no right to tell a woman what she can and can not do with her body. That's fine, Ms Clinton, but I want to know why MY TAX DOLLARS are goiing to fund abortions? Our tax money should not be used to fund abortions.....like you said MS Clinton, get the government out of it.
14 | Shirley Ann Griffith | 10154714137801336_10154714589226336 | No way in hell would I agree to an abortion in ones 7,8, or 9th month. The baby is fully developed, the last month is when lungs develop. Can not support this!!
15 | Socorro Waugh | 10154714137801336_10154714668601336 | I'm okay if someone doesn't like Trump. But, keep in mind... If you vote for Hillary, you will be part of the genocide against babies. Don't come with the hypocrisy saying that you don't believe in abortion when you are voting for her. No one should change God's plans. And a baby is part of God's plan. Trump 2016!
16 | Tedi Bennethum | 10154714137801336_10154714655891336 | Spoken by someone who, like in so many executive positions, have no clue of the reality. Anyone who has had the experience of first hand seeing how even a 20week old fetus struggles for its life could never deny her words clearly approve of "convenient" murder. But then again, she doesn't have any issues with murder, does she?
17 | Dawn Marie Demet | 10154714137801336_10154714534496336 | As a believer, those calling themselves one, we better think long and hard about this. Much of the demise of our country started with our allowing the murder of our unborn. God is the author of life and death. It's very clear life begins at conception. We cannot overlook this. Far to many believers turn their heads from this. To vote someone in to office that is going to think it's ok to murder our babies right up until birth, well I truly doubt you have a relationship with God. We need to stand firm in what we know is his commands. Period. No excuses.
18 | Dee Vickers Caprio | 10154714137801336_10154714472186336 | She makes me sick! Maybe she defended late term abortions because she had a few herself or bullied Bills "Girls" into having Abortions? Just a thought.
19 | Dax Kennedy | 10154714137801336_10154714458426336 | She is for children? Give me a break! Third trimester babies have good chances to survive outside the womb. Now it would probably be different if the doctor shot the baby. Gotta grab the guns because a disarmed public is easier to control. She is seriously distorted
20 | Tammy Wisner | 10154714137801336_10154714603841336 | I wish that Donald Trump would have spoken to the fact that Planned Parenthood was selling off fetus body parts for gain as well as injecting babies who survived abortions with drugs to kill them so that they can sell them off piece by piece. Disgusting human beings! When do babies/children begin to count as humans to Hilary?? When mom decides to keep them?  Women and children's rights my foot!!
21 | Carol Hepburn Yozzo | 10154714137801336_10154714665306336 | She kept saying she met mothers, who had their own reasons for late term abortion. What they did meet her in Shoprite. It's totally different story if a mothers life is in danger, she talked like it was a daily routine. She such a liar. Omg such a liar
22 | Cecilia Rodriguez | 10154714137801336_10154714640056336 | It is not ok to have a late term abortion it's murder. The only way abortion should be legal if it is rape. It shouldn't be legal just because it was unplanned.  Please don't vote for Hillary
23 | Teresa Veal | 10154714137801336_10154714400386336 | Christians the country over must rally behind our pro life candidate. Mr Trump.
24 | Barbara Lindsey | 10154714137801336_10154714777311336 | GOV Mike Huckabee I have to Thank Donald Trump for standing up for saving Lives and any person that would want to kill babies at any point should be prosecuted to the fullest extent.
25 | Robert Hasis | 10154714137801336_10154714438011336 | More women will be endeared to Trump on this issue, as opposed to the screwed-up hags (supporting Hill), who profess liking and loving killing - murdering - their own helpless, defenseless babies.

--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Shelly Kay Rowland | 10154714118721336_10154714318746336 | She wants to protect toddlers from guns but she's ok with killing babies...
2 | Rod Sklar | 10154714118721336_10154714319761336 | Lets vote for obama and Hillary Clinton so we can import millions of Muslims, and take away guns from Americans, the liberals will never wake up and see the truth. Vote for trump, to make America great again !
3 | Christina Lynn | 10154714118721336_10154714324026336 | Hillary said, "I am for full term abortions" (murdering full term babies) & "I think we need to have more gun control to help protect toddlers." Seriously, you can't make this stuff up.
4 | Ben Alexander | 10154714118721336_10154714325376336 | The fact that Hillary is not wearing an American flag pin says it all. She is not for America. She is only for herself. If she wins, we all lose. She is a liar, criminal and a con artist. We need real change!
5 | Timothy Maxsween | 10154714118721336_10154714328006336 | Hillary has bad Judgment. she told the whole world during the debate the time and protocol of launching a nuke. pretty sure the rest of the world did not need to know it takes x minutes to launch after the Pres hands down the order. pretty sure she just leaked Classified Info there.
6 | Joe Tucker | 10154714118721336_10154714449826336 | Yeah, as a general rule, innocent people don't smash devices with hammers and plead the fifth 20 to 30 times in as many questions. Just an observation.

Section 2071.For those of us who do not have United States Code committed to memory, here's what it says:“(a) Whoever willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys, or attempts to do so, or, with intent to do so takes and carries away any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both. (b) Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States. As used in this subsection, the term “office” does not include the office held by any person as a retired officer of the Armed Forces of the United States.”Yes, it explicitly states "shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States.Shouldn't voters know that? The media won't tell them. So it's up to us.
8 | Tagbo Chigozie Frank | 10154714118721336_10154714322161336 | Hillary is as bad as rotten egg.I wish Americans will look at the future and see how bright it is with Trump. #makeAmericagreatagain
9 | Allen DuPree | 10154714118721336_10154714376746336 | And she will amend the 1st to greatly limit what you can say publicly or on social media about people like her, with criminal penalties and prosecutions.
10 | Jeff Lindsay | 10154714118721336_10154714531636336 | Hillary wants open boarders... Wanting open boarders should scare the hell out of ya. Just alone. Can you just imagine what harm could come in and then leave. and you could do nothing about it.
11 | Trent DeLisle | 10154714118721336_10154714321496336 | How is better regulations hating the 2nd amendment. That's like saying Trump hates the first amendment because he doesn't like protesters at his rallies.
12 | Mary Ellen McGrath Watts | 10154714118721336_10154714767551336 | Clinton makes hand signals during this and past debates. She must have an earpiece to give her lines. Watch her stroke her face with her finger periodically, just prior to giving her answer....there's something sneaky going on folks!!
13 | William Santo Ramos | 10154714118721336_10154714459016336 | Hillary after years if being married to bill clinton she changed over the years. At one time she was a defense lawyer and was going the right way but now she is at the deep end. Trump should be president. I think he being a genious at money will have us even make more money. He used to have conventions on how to do that. Imagine if he is president
14 | Russell Kuykendall | 10154714118721336_10154714343731336 | You guys are blowing things way out of proportion. She never said she was for full term abortion. Doctors wouldn't do that anyway. What she did say is it should be a womans right to decide if she is ready to have a baby. A woman can make that  decision early in a pregnancy. She never said she wanted to take guns away from law abiding American citizens. Just Terrorists on the no fly list. Do you guys want to sell guns to Terrorists? It surely sounds that way. Quit being immature and mellow-dramatic. Your talking like 5 year old Children, my god. Grow up!!!
15 | David Burgin | 10154714118721336_10154714404176336 | POINTS TO PONDER BEFORE ELECTION DAY :copied If you are Gay, why are you voting for Hillary? She wants to bring in hundreds of thousands of refugees that believe all Gays should be executed.If you are Black, why are you voting for Hillary? She admires Margaret Sanger and defends Planned Parenthood. They want to abort as many black babies as possible. "Exterminate the Black Race because they are like weeds." Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.If you are a Christian, why are you voting for Hillary Clinton? She wrote her Senior Thesis on Saul Alinsky. He dedicated his book "Rules for Radicals" to Lucifer, The Devil? She says he was and still is her mentor.If you are a Veteran, in the military, or closely related to a military member, why are you voting for Hillary? She left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again. They called for help but the help was told to stand down.If you have factory job, why are you voting for Hillary? She supported TPP. Factory workers are being laid off because jobs are going overseas. Don't forget the deals she made with China. She also welcomes open borders and for illegals to get benefits with YOUR tax money.If you are poor, why are you voting for Hillary? She is supporting Wall street and all the big banks. Big banks keep the poor, poor by destroying the poor man's credit by allowing medical bills and collections to affect your credit scores so you can pay higher interest rates than the rich. - Taking as much of the little money you earn.If you are a woman, how can you vote for Hillary? She has buried all of Bill's rape victims under the rug. Remember the little girl that was raped? She defended the rapist and laughed about it later.If you carry a gun, and believe in the Constitution, how can you vote for Hillary? She wants to eliminate the NRA, take your guns, and abolish the second amendment.If you breathe, why would you vote for Hillary? She has left a trail of dead people that did not agree with her or knew too much!
16 | Greta Accurso Yaeger | 10154714118721336_10154714863451336 | Oh the hypocrisy of it all! Political speech at its best. Her smile is so creepy. Protect life in one sentence kill a life in another.  Just shows you the flip flopping politics as usual.  Sadly she'll get in and 4 more years of no change. Sad.
17 | Mark Smith | 10154714118721336_10154714406566336 | If a pregnant woman is killed it's considered two murders but an aborted baby isn't really alive. What kind of logic is that?
18 | Russell Kuykendall | 10154714118721336_10154714328236336 | Hillary Clinton is only trying to keep guns out of the hand's of Terrorists that's it. It's as if Republicans want to hand guns to members of ISIS to kill Americans.
19 | Richard Watson | 10154714118721336_10154714580671336 | If she hated the 2nd amendment she would say so. And she dosent she wants things 2 be put into place 2 help control assault rifles and who can buy guns. I've hunted my entire life and I most certainly don't need a 30 round ar15 to hunt with.
20 | Misti Good | 10154714118721336_10154714355881336 | And for the record this is a lie!!!Hillary supports the second amendment but we also support protecting children and innocent peoples lives Isis supports your gun laws and calls you dumb as fk and we agree!!!! #GUNREFORMNOW!!#NOASSAULTRIFFLES!!#STRICKBACKGROUNDCHECKS!!#ONAWATCHLISTNOGUNS!!#MENTALLYILLNOGUNS!!!#PTSDNOGUNS!!!
21 | Katherine Vroman | 10154714118721336_10154714830131336 | She is being allowed to plea the fifth on national security issues..she needs to be held accountable. The fifth is not proof of innocence The fifth is used to freely to cover up and hid. More of a guilty plea in my opinion.
22 | Amber Graves | 10154714118721336_10154714991276336 | So let's think for a moment. You are expecting your first child. Everything is going great, but then you find out at 20 weeks which is 5 months. Your baby is missing part of her brain. She is missing part of her heart, her face is missing pieces. What do you do!!! You see every doctor you can afford. There all tell you the same. Your baby won't make it due to medical issues. Your baby is dying inside you. What do you do!! A father a mother. What do you do. I don't believe in abortions but I can't tell someone else that you must carry their baby knowing she is dying.. Who are we to judge! Why punish a woman because she needs that abortion. Most of y'all know nothing about this!
23 | Linda Stillwell Ray | 10154714118721336_10154714540751336 | Once they start taking away just one right, what will be the next? Our right to vote,  right to free speech, right to be free or right to privacy . Once the politicians are allowed to take away just 1 right, it will be easier.
24 | Julia Wright Norcott | 10154714118721336_10154714993066336 | Also she feels that regular Americans in the states not as smart as Supreme Court of 12 people. She feels so superior to other Americans. As hillery thinks we r deplorablesThinks only federal govern is smart enough that states can't make proper decisions
25 | Bobby Ray James | 10154714118721336_10154714962021336 | A few takeaways from tonight's debate:1. Toddlers are using guns to kill people in Washington. - Hillary2. Hillary reveals our nuclear  response times to the world. 3. Hillary has no problem killing babies at full term.... ripping from womb or sucking brains out. 4. Hillary's campaign caused riots at Trumps campaign events. 5. Trump will not accept defeat until he sees how corrupt elections are and how much voter fraud is committed by Democrats. 6. Hillary's State Department lost $6 Billion of our money...vanished.7. Trump used Steel from China to build a hotel. 8. Hillary accepted $25 Million from countries that kill gays and women. 9. Hillary wants to bring in 50,000 Islamic refugees many who are loyal to ISIS. 10. Open borders to Hillary means allowing electricity to flow back and forth. 11. The Clinton Foundation is pure as a virgin walking through the wind driven snow. 12. Trump wants to build a wall and it's OK with me if he uses Chinese steel to do it. 13. Trump to get rid of ObamaCare ...Hillary to keep it. 14. Hillary has committed crimes that she has not been punished for which would've disqualified her from running for president. 15. Trump feels strongly his TV show should've won 3rd Emmy. 16. Chris Wallace was tougher on Trump than Clinton. 18. Hillary loves wearing dictator-style tunics. No American Flag pin. 19. Trump had American Flag on lapel. 20. Clinton wants to help all Americans by taking from those that have and giving to those who have not... if you can believe her. Is that her public or private position? Hmmm21. Trump wants to beef up our military, take care of own before caring for illegals and terrorists, secure our borders, bring jobs back, and make America great again. 22. My baby endured all 3 debates by my side! ❤️

Watch the final presidential debate in 60 seconds. Who do you think won – Donald J. Trump or Hillary Clinton? #Debates2016 #FoxNews2016
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Martin Meyer | 10154714201496336_10154714206496336 | I'm from Scandinavia (Hillary's favorite Socialist region), and I think Trump won by far. She's a corrupt liar and shouldn't even be allowed to run. She should be in jail for high treason and murder, but lucky for her, liberal media have her back (just like here)
2 | Don Croker | 10154714201496336_10154714209921336 | Trump won. She was the worst tonight. That goofy grin while he was talking about partial birth abortion, which she has no problem with. Never Hillary!
3 | Nass Morg | 10154714201496336_10154714229176336 | You just heard Hillary Clinton on live TV, into a mic she knew was on, explicitly defend, and say point blank that late term / partial birth abortions are ok and that she will appoint Supreme Court justices to ensure that they remain legal. That means that up until the babies due date, the baby is half delivered, kicking and screaming, and its spine is cut or brain punctured and its life is ended. If you're ok with that, you are dead inside.
4 | Marilu Lemos | 10154714201496336_10154714223691336 | Hillary had a better way with words but she isnt being honest. Trump struggles with words but appears to be more sincere. if we had to choose according to the choice of words they both used, Hillary won but if we choose with what our hearts tell us to choose, i think Trump won. They both have their disadvantages but only one is in it for the honesty of making America better. Hope the one who has their heart right is the one who takes all....
5 | Johnny Renzulli | 10154714201496336_10154714217406336 | Though harsh at times everything that came out of Trump's mouth was 100% truth that needed to be said and heard! It's everything the mainstream media tries to hide!
6 | Cindy Koshinsky | 10154714201496336_10154714233946336 | Let me see.. Hillary: deleted emails, Benghazi, pay to play, paying people to riot at Trump rallys, having access to questions before debates... all proven to be true. And it's only the tip of her illegal mountain.  or .. Trump: .. supposedly touched women over 30 years ago, but not proven in a court yet, and said the word pussy... hmmm.. hard choice...  I think I will choose the one NOT committing illegal crimes. Trump 2016!
7 | Joshua Willett | 10154714201496336_10154714206356336 | Trump obviously won! Hillary about had a coronary when he mentioned Russia and Putin haha#captainofthedeplorables
8 | Mohamed Salman | 10154714201496336_10154714241576336 | I am egyptian hilary is continue for america goes down after destroying others...egyptian people except muslim brotherhood ( 5 percent only) prefer trump...about 85 millions of egyptians prefer trump..we hate clinton we hate obama..
9 | Scott Mattern | 10154714201496336_10154714213856336 | He is 100% right for that answer. As much corruption as the Hillary campaign has been associated with. Who can believe it will be an honest election.
10 | Annette Pickrell | 10154714201496336_10154714228956336 | She thinks we live in a world of peace due to her accomplishments and just gave them the our nuclear response time... WTH.. and why would she keep talking about the fact that Russia hacked those emails when she's been insisting there's no way her emails could have been hacked for the last couple years?  She's in a lala land all her own....
11 | Heather Edenfield | 10154714201496336_10154714259741336 | Apparently, the FBI forgot to visit the Cornell Law Library. Word for word from the Cornell Law Library Former United States Attorney General Michael Mukasey tells MSNBC that not only is Hillary Clinton's private email server illegal, it "disqualifies" her from holding any federal office. Very specifically points to one federal law, Title 18. Section 2071.For those of us who do not have United States Code committed to memory, here's what it says:“(a) Whoever willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys, or attempts to do so, or, with intent to do so takes and carries away any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both. (b) Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States. As used in this subsection, the term “office” does not include the office held by any person as a retired officer of the Armed Forces of the United States.”Yes, it explicitly states "shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States.Shouldn't voters know that? The media won't tell them. So it's up to us.
12 | Carrie House Tucker | 10154714201496336_10154714222446336 | I missed the debate because I had to go work . I Pray for our nation that Trump wins. We will be left for dead with Hillary . She only cares about herself, she stole furniture from our White House , left broke ,,you tell me Im for Females for TRUMP
13 | John Thomas | 10154714201496336_10154714248336336 | Hillary Clinton is a polished career politician. She's like a robot reading from her notes. She is all talk no action like most politicians. As usual she seemed angry and almost put out that she has to even be there. Trump seemed sincere and honest. He made some very good points tonight. The bottom line is if you are happy with the direction of the country vote Hillary Clinton. If not and you want real change vote Trump. Me personally I think Trump actually cares about the people of this country. Hillary not so much.
14 | Jackie Pirie | 10154714201496336_1098229486958849 | I'm from Australia and can't understand how she can run considering the level of corruption . Why aren't you all as Americans doing anything about it trump needs to win .
15 | Teri Paulsen | 10154714201496336_10154714243181336 | Wait a second ... so many are appalled that Trump said he may or may not accept the results of the election. Wasn't it Bill Clinton who told Al Gore to challenge the results of the election thus giving us the saga of the hanging chad?Huh.
16 | Darijo Blazevic | 10154714201496336_10154714206881336 | Trump just lost the election with his remarks tonight. He's making Pence, Kellyanne, & his surrogates run circles & flip flop right & left on National TV to give the appearance of even being "unified" in keeping up with Trump's loose mouth. It's already front page news on every newspaper around the country. What's bizarre is that if Rubio or Bush had run, Clinton would be 9 points behind and not Trump. 🤔
17 | Daniel Reid | 10154714201496336_10154714266606336 | Love him or hate him, Donald Trump has shown the entire nation irrefutably, explicitly, and beyond any shadow of a doubt that the U.S. government and their media propagandists are corrupt to the core and not worth garbage.
18 | Melinda Benner | 10154714201496336_1098227893625675 | I have several things to say but first wt%^* was she smiling about ?! I didn't hear anything that was even remotely funny for her to have that fake nasty smile/grin on her face ..She's so fake it's a shame people can't see it !!
19 | Roderick Zijp | 10154714201496336_10154714242516336 | Hillary Rodham Clinton smiled when Donald Trump talked about how Hillary's biggest donor, Saudi Arabia, trows gays of buildings and stones innocent woman to death.
20 | Melinda Benner | 10154714201496336_1098238643624600 | 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 I vote Donald Trump not entirely for the man he was or maybe still is but for the future of The United States !!Donald I believe will make America great and safe again !! Hillary will nose dive our country even further into destruction and despair !!
21 | Justin Heppner | 10154714201496336_1098229203625544 | I'm going to vote for him for sure. I wouldn't vote for a lady that would let my brothers die in combat and delete the evidence and then run for our presidency.
22 | Vicky Arterburn | 10154714201496336_10154714218761336 | I don't give a crap if it was the Pope that released Hillary Clinton's emails it still doesn't change the FACT that they are her emails and that's it!
23 | Ryan Michael | 10154714201496336_10154714211071336 | No one won, but Trump clearly lost. Who in their right mind would vote for someone caught on tape admitting to molesting women?
24 | Sherri Ann | 10154714201496336_10154714225466336 | Fox this was not even a fair 60 seconds. You didn't even catch a quarter of his strong points, like prolife,  immigration n economics. I never saw you of all people to put this out. You made it like CNN n snipped things to make it look bad... This isn't how you normally operate. I saw this n was thinking you had been hacked..... Trump won this. She couldn't even answer several questions.
25 | Joey Leonard | 10154714201496336_10154714238351336 | I worked at a company that built rail cars, lots of spanish guys work there then and still do, the guys that worked closest to me told me they were here illegally using their family members name and social, (not came out and told me, i overheard them talking so i put 2 & 2 together) how i caught on to this is not 1 time did i let them know i speak a little spanish so when folks heard them call each other by their nick name they were actually calling each other by their real name. At lunch or any other time when the team leader called them by the name on their uniform, check and paper work, it would end with a big laugh by the mexicans saying "stupid fckn gringos, thats not my name you dumb fcks, these Americans think they are so smart" stuff to that nature. Now, these guys were in GA and their family here "legally" worked in California....so just so folks understand, we might have a slight problem with illegals here.....just sayin...oh yeah, Trump won. #TRUMP2016

"By fighting Assad, who turned out to be a lot tougher than she thought – now she's going to say, 'oh, he loves Assad' – he's just much tougher, and much smarter than her and Obama." 

Donald J. Trump slammed Hillary Clinton and President Obama's foreign policy in Syria, calling Aleppo a "disaster" and a "humanitarian nightmare."
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Carter Casper | 10154713660601336_10154714109716336 | It was laid out pretty clear, Donald J. Trump is the answer to keep our American values. It's time for the U.S. citizens to unite, understand how principal the Supreme Court is going to be as a major factor to those values, and get out November to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain. #Trump2016
2 | Barb Tanner Sterry | 10154713660601336_10154714113991336 | Hillary Clinton is known to many, that she is Mentally unbalanced! Hillary is Two Face! We all know she is a habitual liar, she is untrustworthy, but what is not revealed to the General Public is she Freaken Nuts! Drink with the need for Power and Money! Curses ,Screams, throw things, insult workers, threaten them with their jobs, pulls her own hair out when she goes into her rage! Example: A Secret Service Agent Good morning Mrs. Clinton, her response, "F**k Off!". Called Disable children, "F**ken Retards"! Hillary Clinton is freaken corrupt  from the inside out, and her corrupt tentacles have reach into our DOJ and FBI Hillary is  Satan daughter!
3 | Donna Niebling | 10154713660601336_10154714114026336 | It's true, it is a disaster over there!. Yet, it came apart on Hillarys watch didn't it! The whole Middle East was on her watch! Now look at the nightmare over there! Lots of blood on her hands! Lots!!
4 | Thomas Beck | 10154713660601336_10154714114191336 | This debate above all others proof that Hillary Clinton is not mentally fit for the presidency of the United States. If Trump can break her down like this just imagine what the rest of the leaders of the Free World and communist do to her
5 | April Le | 10154713660601336_10154714137321336 | I love that Obama says "Trump quit whining about election being unfair" Then Hillary says "Trump is making a mockery of of our democracy" Then tonight She whines about Russia fixing/messing with the election!! HYPOCRITICAL Liar and manipulator
6 | Andy Birr | 10154713660601336_10154714154106336 | Did anyone else pick up on the fact that Clinton revealed some VERY classified information on live T.V. In regards to our nuclear weapons response times? Or was that just me? And she says Trump would be dangerous with classified information and nuclear codes? Haha!! #VoteTrump#NeverHillary
7 | Dale Papes | 10154713660601336_10154714147321336 | Did anyone else hear Hillary Clinton's answer about "pay to play"? Yeah, because she never answered the question. Did anyone hear Hillary Clinton's answer about having knowledge of the people involved with her campaign instigating violence at Trump rallies? Oh yeah, she weaseled out of answering that one too. Yet everyone is worried about Trump expecting voter fraud! Unbelievable.
8 | Jean Combs | 10154713660601336_10154714116181336 | She talked over everyone so much tonight.... on purpose I am sure so he didn't get to say nearly as much as he could or should have! What he did get to say though had great impact!!
9 | William Goldstein | 10154713660601336_10154714110996336 | hillary she make statement or not we can not trust her because she bad peoples a round her and did not change them so we now that she up to something bad for country.
10 | Tina Morrison | 10154713660601336_10154714155601336 | Chris Wallace did a spectacular job moderating the final debate. He was fair, and stuck to the issues. Journalist integrity is not dead after all. Kudos to Chris Wallace!
11 | Gina RM | 10154713660601336_10154714115861336 | This election is the. most corrupt biased and disgusting propaganda. I lost respect for Anderson Cooper . They went on a witch hunt on Trump
12 | Rose Adkins | 10154713660601336_10154714135416336 | Omg two beauty queens caught something the rest of us missed!!!Hillary Clinton actually told the world our to the minute response time for missle launches nuclear launches!!
13 | Deanna Folk Mattice | 10154713660601336_10154714112606336 | It's time to re-Claim our property American;s on Pennsylvanian Ave W.D C from the Corrupt occupants !!! No way will we the People allow H ROTTEN C the Slithering Serpent 100% to occupy our house ever again !! Stand Up American's for the eviction of Corruption !
14 | Damian Moss | 10154713660601336_10154714129846336 | He had a mom of one of the benghazi victims in the audience and should have crucified hillary to her face on it....over all he did well...but wish he hit her harder than he did..
15 | Jennifer Begley | 10154713660601336_10154714184911336 | I don't understand how anyone can vote for her when she believes in killing a child hours before it is born. I don't know of any mother who would agree to abort her baby late in the pregnancy no matter what the circumstances are. Anytime after 26 weeks the child has a chance of surviving and any mother I have ever talked to tells everyone THE BABY COMES FIRST. A ninth month abortion is murder and if she doesn't understand that then she is not for our children at all.
16 | Haylea Freeman | 10154713660601336_10154714141011336 | I keep seeing comments about Trump calling Hillary a "nasty woman". Well she is a NASTY WOMAN!!! She's a corrupt politician that hasn't done squat her whole career! What do people thinks she's gonna do if elected?! First off she'll take every single right away that we have because we all know if you give a politician an inch they'll take a mile. This really scares me. I'm praying that it's not her but I don't know. I think she has some tricks up her deceiving sleeves.
17 | Mona Somora | 10154713660601336_10154714114671336 | Hillary was the one candidate that the GOP could defeat. All they needed was a halfway decent candidate to face her. Instead, they let the uneducated 36.4% nominate Trump. He had a very slim chance to beat her, and shot himself in the foot over and over. He chased voters away that wanted to vote for the least evil. He made himself the most evil. He performed poorly at all 3 debates because he couldn't curb his mouth. Now he says he won't accept the results when he loses. We can NEVER nominate a candidate of his low caliber, ever again.
18 | Jacqueline Blocker | 10154713660601336_10154714147326336 | 🇺🇸You better vote for who you truly think can fix our National Security, because if we don't fix it soon it isn't going to matter who disrespected women, or committed adultery, etc. the terrorist are going to take over our country, and this great freedom we love will be no more❤️🇺🇸💙
19 | Randy Vaughan | 10154713660601336_10154714203571336 | Hillary says Assad must go even if it means war with Russia. This evil witch is going to get a lot of people killed just as she and Obama did in Libya. Americas threat is not Assad or Syria or even Russia. Americas threat is Iran. Strange everyone must go in the middle east Mubarack in Egypt, Qadafi in Libya, and now Assad in Syria. No mention of the Aytollahs in Iran.
20 | Blaine Matthew Roberts | 10154713660601336_10154714132831336 | It's pretty ironic that a right wing fox news journalist would be the one too utterly and disqualify trump from the presidency asking twice if he would agree too the election results lol haha fox news
21 | Kristin Fogle Kudrave | 10154713660601336_10154714132526336 | Get rid of Meghan Kelly!! She is doing to Fox News what HRC is doing to this country!! I will NEVER watch her show again and I will encourage all of my friends to never watch her either!
22 | Daniel Reid | 10154713660601336_10154714194676336 | Love him or hate him, Donald Trump has shown the entire nation irrefutably, explicitly, and beyond any shadow of a doubt that the U.S. government and their media propagandists are corrupt to the core and not worth garbage.
23 | Tracee Foster | 10154713660601336_10154714171881336 | ****The bottom line is Hillary just gave the whole world, Americas response time with nucular weapons****Hillary said:"The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must be followed. There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so."
24 | Paul Lettieri | 10154713660601336_10154714727746336 | This is where he should have brought up benghazi because it was assad who went in to rescue our men not the american millitary but Asad she left our men there to die her and obama was never going to go rescue them because dead men tell no tales and now since they survived her and obama are pissed
25 | George Inashvili | 10154713660601336_10154714124326336 | Garry Kasparov47 mins · The commentators are missing the point that the two most outrageous moments of tonight's debate are directly connected. Trump's unprecedented declaration that he may not accept the results of the election and his absolute refusal to put the blame on Putin's Russia for hacking or anything else are both scandalous, but they not separate positions at all.The goal of Putin's propaganda and cyberattacks are to discredit American democracy, to make Americans fear and hate each other and to distrust the very system that makes the United States such a powerful force in the world. This also serves Putin well domestically, where Russian news, all state controlled, is full of announcements about the US election being rigged, despite a total lack of evidence to the contrary. If even America's elections are fake, goes their argument, how can anyone complain about Russia's sham elections?Tonight Trump announced himself loud and clear to be an agent of Putin's goals to destabilize the United States and its democratic process. He constantly repeats Russian propaganda that America is weak and corrupt. Then Trump demonstrated that he is fiercely loyal to Putin, beyond any possible political advantage. These two positions go together. Trump is Putin's stooge and he just confessed to it on stage in Las Vegas.

2 | Wayne R Johnson | 10154713987721336_10154714058471336 | Voter Cheating is not acceptable!If you know how to negotiate, why would you except the idea that if the other side cheats you're OK with it? Why would you answer that question in such a way as to tell the other side yes, I will accept it if you cheat? To me that's not being a very good negotiator. And we have already seen some evidence of cheating . So; Trump is correct!Answering that question is as stupid as telling your enemy when and where you're going to attack them a month before hand.I look forward to him negotiating for our country!
3 | Bill Garrison | 10154713987721336_10154714075436336 | NOT SO FAST...Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said during the third presidential debate, “We at the Clinton Foundation spend ninety percent — ninety percent — of all the money that is donated on behalf of programs of people around the world and in our own country.” Fact-Check: FALSEIndeed, Clinton’s “ninety percent” claim is false according to her troubled charity’s own tax filings...Peter Schweizer, president of the Government Accountability Institute, Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large, and author of Clinton Cash said the Clinton Foundation has spent as little as SIX PERCENT of its total income on actual charitable endeavors.“If you actually look at the numbers of their filings and 990s, that’s what it indicates,” Schweizer said last month in an interview with SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Breitbart News Daily. “The Clinton Foundation will say, ‘We assisted or facilitated in 100,000 kids getting immunizations.’ Well, okay, what does that mean? And they don’t really tell you. They don’t really explain to you how it works.”“So the number is absolutely correct, that six percent goes to other charities,” Schweizer continued. “The other 94 percent is in this stew of marketing, and management, and travel expenses, and sort of all these obscure things, that it’s really hard to dissect what is the end result of that 94 percent being spent.”What’s more? Political analyst Sean Davis, the co-founder of The Federalist and a former adviser to Sen. Tom Coburn and Gov. Rick Perry, examined the Clinton Foundation’s 2013 tax filings and found that “Hillary Clinton’s non-profit spent more on office supplies and rent than it did on charitable grants.” “The Clinton Foundation spent nearly $8.5 million–10 percent of all 2013 expenditures–on travel,” Davis contends. “Nearly $4.8 million–5.6 percent of all expenditures–was spent on office supplies.”

Use class warfare to attack informed voters and make them out to be evil, privileged, uncaring Rich Capitalists Pigs. Heavily tax those who will never support you to buy the votes of those who don't know better.6) Gradually take away the personal freedoms of the people and say its in the interest of protecting minorities and the down trodden from the Common Enemy.7) Use Political Correctness as a weapon to Police speech and the ideas of the Common Enemy and attack them as evil and intolerant e.g. Racist, bigot, homophobic etc8) Control CNN, ensure journalists loyalty is to the Democrat Party, ensure the media rewrite history (e.g. the fact that the KKK was founded by and a division of the Democrat Party) and dismiss news (e.g. Clinton Cash / The Clinton Foundation / Hillary's America / Woman Raped by Bill Clinton / Foreign Governments buying Hillary / Hillary's Russian Uranium Deal / $400,000,000.00 Ransom Deal with Iran / Hillary Providing Weapons to ISIS / Benghazi Cover up / Seth Rich / Obama's White House Staff Deleting Video footage of Lies y during a Press Conference etc) that could hurt the Democrat Party, control the propaganda feed to the public and use the media as an army of Attack Dogs against the Common Enemy.9) Control the education system to teach the children how to think, what to think and brainwash them to hate and mistrust the evil and intolerant Common Enemy.10) Paint resistance to left wing Democrat policies by the Common Enemy as evil and intolerance.11) Promote Multiculturalism and Diversity to divide the people and dilute the American Culture, but attack diversity of thought, speech and opinion as racist, bigotry, intolerance, hate speech etc.12) Gain Power and Control of all levels of society by hand picking loyal Radical Leftists and put them in key positions in local/state/federal bureaucracies, unions, healthcare, education, media, entertainment and the courts system..Did you know Hitler was a progressive Socialist???Hitler used these very same ruthless, manipulative strategies and propaganda tactics to gain power and maintain control over the people!!! Hitler's Nazi Party was named (National Socialist German Workers Party)The Democrat Party and their army of protectors / attack dogs in the Marxist Mainstream Media use these ruthless strategies to manipulate the people, gain power, protect their rigged self serving system and shut down all opposition.Anyone who dares speaks out against these Radical leftists are to be attacked and have their credibility destroyed by the Democrat Party and their army of Attack Dogs in the Marxist Mainstream Media.The Democrat Party Mission Statement:- Don't let the truth, honesty, integrity, ethics or even the law (Murdered Democrat Staffer Seth Rich) stand in the way of complete power and control!!!In short… Divide the Community, so we (The Democrat Party) can Conquer!

I worry about it daily, it upsets my stomach, gives me headaches (I suffer from migraines, and they have increased 10 fold because of election crap), and I am having trouble sleeping at night. I am afraid of a lying, cheating, scamming, POS like Hillary getting into office and screwing up America even worse than it already is.

7 | David Burgin | 10154713987721336_10154714101531336 | POINTS TO PONDER BEFORE ELECTION DAY :copied If you are Gay, why are you voting for Hillary? She wants to bring in hundreds of thousands of refugees that believe all Gays should be executed.If you are Black, why are you voting for Hillary? She admires Margaret Sanger and defends Planned Parenthood. They want to abort as many black babies as possible. "Exterminate the Black Race because they are like weeds." Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.If you are a Christian, why are you voting for Hillary Clinton? She wrote her Senior Thesis on Saul Alinsky. He dedicated his book "Rules for Radicals" to Lucifer, The Devil? She says he was and still is her mentor.If you are a Veteran, in the military, or closely related to a military member, why are you voting for Hillary? She left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again. They called for help but the help was told to stand down.If you have factory job, why are you voting for Hillary? She supported TPP. Factory workers are being laid off because jobs are going overseas. Don't forget the deals she made with China. She also welcomes open borders and for illegals to get benefits with YOUR tax money.If you are poor, why are you voting for Hillary? She is supporting Wall street and all the big banks. Big banks keep the poor, poor by destroying the poor man's credit by allowing medical bills and collections to affect your credit scores so you can pay higher interest rates than the rich. - Taking as much of the little money you earn.If you are a woman, how can you vote for Hillary? She has buried all of Bill's rape victims under the rug. Remember the little girl that was raped? She defended the rapist and laughed about it later.If you carry a gun, and believe in the Constitution, how can you vote for Hillary? She wants to eliminate the NRA, take your guns, and abolish the second amendment.If you breathe, why would you vote for Hillary? She has left a trail of dead people that did not agree with her or knew too much!
8 | Marie Florence Archer Hitchins | 10154713987721336_10154714059101336 | Trump is a political carpetbagger. Unconcerned about his effect on the Republican party brand; he will monetize the hate and fury he has whipped up and create Trump TV. With Roger Ayles at his side. The GOP has been taken for a ride and willingly participated. What a coup!
9 | Gayle-Marie Evans | 10154713987721336_10154714097876336 | Get this! Hilary is now on her private jet heading home after the debate and she takes a few questions from the reporters on the plane. A reporter asked her IF she would support Trump if he won. Hilary didn't ANSWER the question instead she pivoted to saying, "Wasn't that ridiculous that he didn't answer that question blah blah blah and turned it on Trump and wouldn't answer the question herself! But you can rest assure that will NOT be reported in the media! Nope.......................only that Trump said he wouldn't respond to that YET....be never said he WOULDN'T...but his statement by the media has now been turned into headline already on MSN news that TRUMP will NOT support Hilary if she wins! We knew it was coming! Now they should repeat the tape of Hilary not answering the question either when a reporter asked her the exact same question!

11 | Adrian Phillips | 10154713987721336_10154714087221336 | I am disgusted. Trump endorsing Russian intelligence activities on Americans. Trump sexist boasts and then victims coming out. Trump denying the American democratic tradition of conceding defeat. Trump is destroying the Republican party.
12 | Brent Stinnett | 10154713987721336_10154714100926336 | What I saw on the debate stage tonight and in most of his rallies was a man who is frustrated. Not a polished, poll tested politician with years of political experience. I saw a man again who feels like a lot of Americans feel. Frustrated. Those of us who get up every single day and go to work. We do that to make things better for ourselves and our children/grandchildren. Every day Americans. Normal people. What I saw and have seen is a man who is frustrated with the way things are going and have been going. I get it. I get it. When you are frustrated and or pissed off about the way things are going you may not say things the exact right way. You might step on your tongue. You might not sound like a politician. I get it. You're not a politician. You're not polished. I get it. You feel like I feel. Why?  Personally I am about to turn 50. Even at my age I can attest to the changes I have seen in my country. Changes for the worse. Changes made by career politicians. Politicians who have no real world experience. Politicians who have spent their lives doing what they do. Good for you? No. good for themselves. Period. I think it is time we do what is best for our country. Not this group or that group. The Country as a whole. So I think it is time to give someone from outside a shot. I would like to see America be great again for everyone. At this point what do we have to lose?
13 | Paula A Adams | 10154713987721336_10154714184801336 | I'm going to say it again...Just want to point out that Clinton JUST TOLD THE WORLD OUR NUCLEAR RESPONSE TIME. Yeah. She'd keep us real safe. She really is bad at holding classified information. (Copied)
14 | Emily DuBien | 10154713987721336_10154714114291336 | All you Hillary supporters are so niave! Everything she says is rehearsed and lies! She tells you what you want to hear and you fall for it! Please take time to see the movie Hillary's America and study up on her many criminal endeavers! Trump is far from the perfect candidate but with what's going on in our country today, he is what we need right now! This election is very important and will affect your children and grandchildren!! Don't take this election lightly! All our lives depend on it! God Bless America!
15 | Teri Paulsen | 10154713987721336_10154714243926336 | Wait a second ... so many are appalled that Trump said he may or may not accept the results of the election. Wasn't it Bill Clinton who told Al Gore to challenge the results of the election thus giving us the saga of the hanging chad?Huh.
16 | Chris Jones | 10154713987721336_10154714080921336 | I bet Assange is wondering why Americans arn't at Washingtons gate yet? I mean we revolted over a tax on tea, and now we see proof of curruption on the left and idiots are actually still voting for it. At this point I wish Russia would nuke us on principle. We deserve it for being too dumb check our government, when our founders built a fail safe to do so.
17 | Shandy Elliott | 10154713987721336_10154714078966336 | I wish I could sit down with these people who will not acknowledge any of the questionable events and behaviors from Hillary. I watch the news all day long and from multiple networks, so I know what they are all saying (and more importantly what some are not saying). I think many Hillary supporters only support her because their friends do (and that nonsensical chain goes down the line). Many people online apparently have not read past the headlines or listened past a soundbite before they make up their mind. In many cases, it's socially acceptable to support Hillary for no other reason than being a woman or that she supposedly supports gay rights. No, she doesn't - only on the surface and only recently once she realized the nation was a lilttle more gay friendly. It's just sad that many of the comments on these threads are from Hillary supporters of whom apparently can only copy/paste what others have said, and when questioned by their comment, they don't know what else to say.If these Wikileak emails and recent undercover videos don't open your eyes to Hillary, then like Donald Jr. said....
18 | Danette Jett | 10154713987721336_10154714081576336 | Does Hillary actually think that the American voters are going to buy into her promise of free college tuition? We know that the bipartisan Congress will shoot it down. They want approve it. Needless to say if the did...The tax payers will be paying for it. Along with the infiltration of refugees and illegal immigrants. What about homeless vets, SS, the middle class struggling to pay their bills and Obamacare, vets?
19 | Edwin Helen | 10154713987721336_10154714133966336 | It is hard to believe why American people can't understand how corrupt the Clinton's are. The evidences are clear as crystal ball and still people can't see with their naked eyes. Do we need a giant microscope? Hillary Clinton campaign tactic is misleading the people and full of lies after lies, lies, and on & on. People still believe on them, what's wrong? It is hard to understand what"s going on to the American people. Wake up ....

21 | David Burgin | 10154713987721336_625438547635548 | This is for the Black Voters only.First i am Republican and as simple as I can I will explain how is see you guys.Joe's car breaks down and needs a ride to work. Joe ask Bill for a ride and Bill says sure and when I get there I will help you fix your car, Joe says thank you. Monday Joe calls Bill, you still picking me up, Bill says yes and I'm bringing tools to help fix your car.  Bill forgets and goes to work and didn't even think or remember Joe. This goes on for months with Joe calling Bill and never being picked up or helped. You see Joe is the Black vote and Bill is the guy  that makes promises  (democrat) and never delivers. Joe is still calling Bill for a ride (dah) and Bill never keeps his promises. Joe when are you going to get it, Bill is never going to pick you up. You see Joe the Democrat black voter believes Bill is going to come bur he never does. Each day represents an election and Bill keeps promising and Joe keeps believing, it's time for Joe to ask someone else because Bill the Democrat will never help you.
22 | Gene Oliver | 10154713987721336_10154714112221336 | I disagree the Republican party has done this to its own self we voted them in where  we control the house and Senate they were absolutely gutless instead of standing up for their voters and doing their will they Cowered down to the other party on every point sometimes i couldn't tell the difference between partys!
23 | James Ivester | 10154713987721336_10154714062416336 | It's discussing how this government has grown into a corrupt group of good ole boys.Lies to cover lies, avoiding issues and hoping they go away...It's a shame how the media helps cover these up

4 | Wayne R Johnson | 10154713938241336_10154713997671336 | What kind of genius?Lies to parents of Benghazi victims?Lies about servers?Lies about emails?Lies about devices?Calls millions of voters deplorable?Calls Bernie voting Millennial's basement dwellers?...WHAT KIND OF GENIUS VOTES FOR SUCH A PERSON?
5 | Chesley Horace Foster Jr. | 10154713938241336_10154714018681336 | Trump won the debate. The media is blowing up over saying the would not answer right now to accept the result of the election. All BS. He is talking about voter fraud which Obama and Clinton is totally involved in.
6 | Sherry Shaffer Colyer | 10154713938241336_10154714025801336 | Brazille has graduated from the Hillary Clinton school of lying!  Think she should get extra credit for throwing in she is a Christian woman like that saves you from the next lie you tell.
7 | Bob Grant | 10154713938241336_10154714010141336 | So we should believe her (when the evidence is in writing) but NOT believe Trump ? I wish Megyn Kelly had asked her that.

10 | Sandy Grace von Nolting | 10154713938241336_10154714013721336 | Trump has his faults...but the Bible is full of stories of God using deeply flawed people for His purpose. Hillary and the Democrats are just so diametrically opposed to Biblical principles on major issues, I honestly don't see how anyone could support her in good conscious. I will concede that she is the candidate of choice for atheists, agnostics, Wiccans, Scientologists and Satanists. Hands down. Anyone else...you've lost your ever loving mind if you're "With Her." I'm honestly just sick of the "Trump said this" or the "Hillary has no energy" stuff...it's all clutter. I hate the clutter and the inconsequential garbage perpetuated by the media. They distract people and it's giving us bad leaders who, in turn, give us bad policies. Even on Fox News...first thing that's the "take away" from the talking heads is that ohhhhhh Trump won't accept the election outcome. Huh? That's about number 325 on my take aways from the debate...I didn't even give it a second thought. Honestly, why are they acting like that was something just never heard of in American politics. The Dems fought tooth and nail in 2000 in the courts after Bush was declared president. Silly. And with all of the voter fraud evidence out there...anyone with a brain would question the validity of the system as it is...esp since the Dems think it's "disenfranchising" to show an actual photo ID to vote...gee, I wonder why. I think we all know why. Anyway, Hillary is ahead in the polls right now...and as sad as that is, I've always said that after 2012 I will never again underestimate the stupidity of the American voters. But the race is close...it comes down to those "battleground" states...and whether the silent majority shows up for Trump in numbers great enough to counter all of the dead and/or illegal voters that show up for Hillary.

If we are going to have a woman president please let it be a woman who truly loves the next generation.   One who honors and values life.
12 | Calixto Jensen | 10154713938241336_10154714017861336 | What I think is AMAZING and not being discussed about the debate is the fact (based on Hillary's own words) that she would cut a 9 month old baby out of a mother's womb without thinking about it twice...WOW!!! She would cut a baby out of the mother 1 day before it was due to be delivered...that's the same baby a mother is going to tenderly embrace and fall in love with 1 day later...   That my friends is shocking!!!  Hillary says she care so much about the children and has spent a lifetime protecting them...unless she's giving the green light to cut them out of their mother's womb 1 day before they're ready to be born....that is Earth shattering!!!
13 | Brandon Ballard | 10154713938241336_547794512083254 | It's no longer about Republican vs. Democrat.It's all of us Americans vs the Politicians, the media, special interests, lobbyists, foreign countries, Wall Street, the drug companies, hollywood, and the Washington elitist.Never again will we have a chance to take our country back from the globalist agenda they're cramming down our throats, It's now, or never.
14 | Lance Hanners | 10154713938241336_10154714018046336 | Omg, Kelly is literally holding the evidence in her hand while Brazile continues to lie about it. Are democrats born with criminal minds or do they have to practice to the point that lying comes naturally?
15 | Rita Longworth | 10154713938241336_10154714002941336 | She was squirming.  I even felt bad for her, but that is what lying and corruption does to people.
16 | Mel Mcbroome | 10154713938241336_10154714018566336 | Hillary needs to be put in a jump suit color orange! She is not just s liar but is a criminal America. Wake up! Especially you my Latino friends. Viva la Trump!!
17 | Ronda Holcomb | 10154713938241336_10154714031206336 | That was the funniest interview I've seen in a while. The look on Donna Brazile's face was priceless. To see her caught in a lie and just keep it up and keep it up even though inside her heart must have been beating 100 miles per minute knowing she had been caught.. Tripping over her excuses. Hahaha!!  She obviously learned how to lie from the best...
18 | Shelly Breedlove | 10154713938241336_10154714027941336 | Oh, lets just blame everyone else. It's the Russians. Its been fabricated. Its Bush's fault. Lol... We all watched in 04 when all Bush could do was twittle his thumbs and the dems made the laws that flushed the toilet for the 08 election. The dems made the stimulus and the bailout for the banks and cars and wall street and borrowed money from China and now we are sitting on 20 trillion in debt. The dems was steering the sinking ship now for 12 years.
19 | Joe-Elaine DaCosta | 10154713938241336_10154714023186336 | another woman liar in the democratic party - seems they do not know the truth even when they are faced with it in capital letters - she was stuttering and trying to dig herself out of a lying hole
20 | Debbie Ford Montgomery | 10154713938241336_10154714019576336 | More of #crookedhillary lying puppets! All she said was "my emails were stolen from me!" However when a diamond ring is stolen its still a Diamond Ring! So truth is you said it in an email, stolen or not you said you "got the questions in advance!"
21 | Mirasol Presley | 10154713938241336_1235522193136650 | Donna Brazil's you are all corrupt and thank goodness to Wikileaks. Mr. Donald J. Trump the next President Of America with the landslide. Hillary lie so much , That  she didn't have a leg to stand. Go to sleep.
22 | Shandy Elliott | 10154713938241336_10154714027841336 | I absolutely loved this exchange. Brazile dug herself such a deep hole that she could not get out of. Just in terms of psychological behavior, this woman was expressing deceit, veiled anger, and quite a bit of condescension. Her lack of answering any question and the way she kept pivoting is a sure sign of dishonesty. She went so far as to claim the emails were fake and although she didn't outright deny the email was not hers, she danced around the entire interview. This was cringe worthy, and all this "I respect you, but" crap is old. So much egg on such a lying face.
23 | Darren Neal | 10154713938241336_10154714020026336 | Notice she kept saying I didn't take any question "from CNN".  She got that question (and maybe more) from someone, not "CNN".  Avoidance.  Dishonest.  Audacity in light of the facts; obviously she, as is now known to be characteristic of many DEMs, has no qualms about playing dirty.
24 | Sheri Knox Hartley | 10154713938241336_10154714036516336 | I used to love Magen Kelly but she has jumped the fence and I will no longer watch her. She's become biased like the mainstream liberal network hosts. Goodbye Ms Kelly.
25 | LeighAnn Cariker | 10154713938241336_547792772083428 | Donna Brazile didn't even know Megyn's name apparently, she kept referring to her as Kelly...aside from that she was clearly lying. I will give a little credit for Megyn who tried to call her out on it.

"With the mainstream media, I don't think the election's fair, and I think you do see voter fraud out there." 

Eric Trump reacted to his father's comment that with regards to accepting the election results, Donald J. Trump said he "will look at it at the time."
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Chelsea Smith | 10154713775471336_10154713953556336 | Why didn't Hillary even address her party making trouble at Trump rallies? She didn't even address it. And the media of course is not mentioning that she glossed over it but if Trump had done the same it would be broadcasted till the election.
2 | Connie Davenport Leagon | 10154713775471336_10154713953486336 | He did not say he would not accept them! He said he would wait and see. Considering all the voter fraud I have been reading about recently not to mention Democrat operatives on tape talking about is illegal activity going back fifty years, that is probably not a bad idea.
3 | Karen Murphy | 10154713775471336_10154713955456336 | Hillary said she wanted more gun control right and regulations to protect toddlers and then a few minutes later condoned butchering a full-term baby in the mother's womb. She is evil to the core.
4 | Joseph J Martin | 10154713775471336_10154713951601336 | She avoided a lot of the questions by answering with something that sounds smart but doesn't actually answer the question.  30 years of experience and some people still buy her bs. She could cook a live puppy in boiling water and some people would still come back with "oh, well Donald Trump is racist etc.
5 | Ashlie Friis | 10154713775471336_10154713959761336 | I PRAY that Trump doesn't accept a rigged or stolen election!IF Hillary is able to win fairly (which is doubtful) then so be it, but I personally want to KNOW this election is FAIR!NO MORE GOVERNMENT SPONSORED CORRUPTION ACCEPTABLE!!!
6 | Donnie Edmonds | 10154713775471336_10154713953096336 | Just a couple or points. The media is trying to make hay out of Trumps refusal to say whether or not he would except the results of the election, and how big the hill is that Trump has to climb to win this election. Where were they when Al Gore contested the results of the 2000 election. Secondly I would t trust the poles. The Brexit vote was down by 10 points against on the day of the vote. We all know how that turned out. The 1948 election had Republican nominee Dewey ahead and projected as winning the election. Truman ended up being the president. So much for the pollsMy point. Pay no attention to the media, and Get out and vote. It ain't over till it's over.
7 | James G. Fulks | 10154713775471336_10154713956411336 | True definition of "THE FIX IS IN" or voter tampering: News media or other group acting in concert to obfuscate the truth to bring about a controlled condition so as to be able to manipulate the end result.
8 | Rodney Liptak | 10154713775471336_10154713957376336 | Yes even Fox News is getting on my nerves! Kelly is in the tank for Hillary, she can't stop talking about Trump and these women accusers.
9 | Diane Edge | 10154713775471336_10154713956736336 | Leave it to the media to pick up on one of the insignificant answers tonight to ignore the ones HRC didn't bother to answer … or to question the irony of her answers.
10 | Anthony Johnston | 10154713775471336_10154713974686336 | The Democrats are all freaking out over Trump saying that he will not accept the results of a rigged and corrupt election system. The people should question it when there is proof coming out everyday over voter fraud. They are acting like this is the first time in history that this has ever happened. Where was their outrage during the Gore vs Bush election? Gore would not concede for weeks. It's completely a double standard.
11 | Daniel Zanderman | 10154713775471336_10154713967041336 | Donald Trump is a whiny baby. The election is not rigged and has been proven not to be. I guess if you were to win, not going to happen, but then it wasn't rigged. Go away and take your family with you
12 | Debbie Hayes Mooney | 10154713775471336_10154713962816336 | Trump Won hands down. ...Why should he say he accepts the out come of the election when 16 Republican Candidates took the pledge and to honor the last man standing but there was plenty that wouldn't honor that so I think he has the right to be on the look out for more back stabbing from both sides
13 | Frank Linford | 10154713775471336_10154713988976336 | You know people,,,we are all very flawed. Sometime we act and talk in such a way that dishonors who we are...But we can all change and make a difference to people. I believe with all my heart and flaws that the Lord has given us Donald Trump.. I believe that he will fight every single day for us. You know last election 25 million Christians did not vote for one reason or another....Obama won by 3.7 million....Lets not let this happen again. All of us go vote, take car loads of Trump supporters to vote...We can do this, lets show the media who is going all out to keep us home, thatWe the People will vote, period.
14 | Jack Howell | 10154713775471336_10154713966881336 | Christians think about this. Moses was raised in the house of Pharoah. Pharoah was the enemy of God's people. Moses was like a billionaire of his time. He was not raised in the laws or teachings of God. The people of God would not have chosen him to be the one to free them from bondage. Yet God chose him. Even though he did not know God. Even though he was guilty of many sins including murder. God used this man to lead his people from corruption and slavery. So maybe we should not be so quick to judge. God knows what is best. This TRUMPet may be being used by God to awaken his people to the attack of the devil. I myself am much more alarmed about what has been proven that Hillary has done than I am about what has been alleged that Trump has done. Before you believe the media that seems to be obviously trying to influence you, Pray to God alone and search your heart and ask God to show you the Truth. Knock and the door shall be opened, seek and you shall find. Moses lead God's people through the Red Sea to escape slavery from a corrupt government 6,000 years ago. Now a Red Sea of voters will elect Trump to free God's people once again from a corrupt government.🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸Wear red on 11/8/2016 VOTE Donald J. Trump
15 | Chesley Horace Foster Jr. | 10154713775471336_10154713982646336 | Trump won the debate. The media is blowing up over saying the would not answer right now to accept the result of the election. All BS. He is talking about voter fraud which Obama and Clinton is totally involved in.
16 | Tim Langley | 10154713775471336_10154713971306336 | Donald? You should have looked over at a Hillary and said, it's Halloween. Those 250,000 dead souls in the cemetery that are voting in the election, want their name back so they can Rest In Peace!!!
17 | Tad T Mekonnen | 10154713775471336_10154713959091336 | She is too smart to go against a man with 0 intelligence. I feel so bad that she has to play in the same ballpark as him and people are actually following him. I'm with her.
18 | Twyla Collins Hughes | 10154713775471336_10154713964091336 | People are outraged for her not wearing a pin, we should be outraged that she wants gun control to save the toddlers, but wants late term abortions to kill the babies. what is wrong with the country
19 | Doreen Carlson-Doyle | 10154713775471336_10154713980161336 | Trump was forced to sign a document to support the primary winner, but how many Republicans broke their promise to Trump??  He is the only one with the intestinal fortitude to stand up to the crooked political establishment!
20 | Deby Ramsey | 10154713775471336_10154713975496336 | Hillary said she's for partial birth abortions when the life/health of the mother is at stake (SOB, sob so many heartbreaking stories) however in cases like this, doctors induce labor to save the life of both mother and baby. The crock of lies just got bigger
21 | Rachael Cabrales | 10154713775471336_1866969850188499 | Mandatory voter I.d. system where you have to not only show legal I.d. to vote but you have to put your finger print on a scanner that shows in the computer records if you have voted yet or not. No Voter I.d. and finger print - no voting. That would prevent voter fraud.
22 | Eusebio Perez Jr | 10154713775471336_10154713975581336 | Best preformance of the night was Meygan Kelly's, a few good men... you cant handle the truth, moment. When she called out Donna Brazile on wiki leaks. OMG that was classic!!!!
23 | Mark Bain | 10154713775471336_10154713975021336 | We see over 100% voter participation in some democratic counties yet there's never an investigation. Dead people voting  DNC campaign buses shipping people around to different voting  sites. Yep no voting fraud here
24 | Richard Colacino | 10154713775471336_10154713977531336 | That was a bad answer by Trump....he has no choice but to accept the results even if this is rigged. There is no remedy to what is about to happen. The fix is clearly in and unless he has activated 10 million voters who never vote, we know how this will play out. Is there a wave or not...
25 | Debbie A. DeGarmo | 10154713775471336_10154714042791336 | I have friends in several states who attended Trump rallies and can attest to the people who tried to intimidate, start issues, they weren't Trump supporters, they were people trying to encite issues, violence, I believe 100% this election is rigged

"When I started this campaign, I started it very strongly. It's called 'Make America Great Again.' We're going to make America great. We have a depleted military, it has to be helped ... we have the greatest people on earth in our military." 

Donald J. Trump gave a final statement to the American people in the last presidential debate. http://bit.ly/2e2Nygi
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Christopher Larocque | 10154713725651336_10154713871161336 | Hillary was asked about Bill Clinton's prior allegations of rape and sexual misconduct about him and completely deflected, avoided the question and utilized the time to bash Trump for the allegations against him. A little sad that she has to use the allegations against Trump in an effort to win votes, yet she can't speak about the one's against her own husband and how she treated those women who spoke out against him. But she's all for the fair and equal treatment of women, right?
2 | Chad Myrick | 10154713725651336_10154713872736336 | Trump has his faults...but the Bible is full of stories of God using deeply flawed people for His purpose. Hillary and the Democrats are just so diametrically opposed to Biblical principles on major issues, I honestly don't see how anyone could support her in good conscious. I will concede that she is the candidate of choice for atheists, agnostics, Wiccans, Scientologists and Satanists. Hands down. Anyone else...you've lost your ever loving mind if you're "With Her." I'm honestly just sick of the "Trump said this" or the "Hillary has no energy" stuff...it's all clutter. I hate the clutter and the inconsequential garbage perpetuated by the media. They distract people and it's giving us bad leaders who, in turn, give us bad policies. Even on Fox News...first thing that's the "take away" from the talking heads is that ohhhhhh Trump won't accept the election outcome. Huh? That's about number 325 on my take aways from the debate...I didn't even give it a second thought. Honestly, why are they acting like that was something just never heard of in American politics. The Dems fought tooth and nail in 2000 in the courts after Bush was declared president. Silly. And with all of the voter fraud evidence out there...anyone with a brain would question the validity of the system as it is...esp since the Dems think it's "disenfranchising" to show an actual photo ID to vote...gee, I wonder why. I think we all know why. Anyway, Hillary is ahead in the polls right now...and as sad as that is, I've always said that after 2012 I will never again underestimate the stupidity of the American voters. But the race is close...it comes down to those "battleground" states...and whether the silent majority shows up for Trump in numbers great enough to counter all of the dead and/or illegal voters that show up for Hillary.
3 | Bob Jack Christiansen | 10154713725651336_10154713874496336 | This Christian is voting for TRUMP, I live in California and all my neighbors and friends are voting for TRUMP...We are tired of the lies and corruption of career politicians!!!!
4 | Vitor Oliveira | 10154713725651336_10154713875311336 | Hillary wants no children to be hurt like that poor little one out there in Syria, that's the reason she wants all of them killed before birth!#KillaryForJail2016!
5 | Joyce Cody | 10154713725651336_10154713878306336 | Why is Fox News being so biased toward Mr. Trump? You know what a liar Hillary Clinton is, and you're sitting there defending her!
6 | Sharon Theobald Hess | 10154713725651336_10154713878181336 | Why do you suppose Trump said he wouldn't accept the vote if he lost? There have been many that have had recounts because they felt the count was wrong. Now there have been rumors that there was a whole town without a republican vote in previous years. I am one that admires Trump for telling the truth because he may ask for a recount and then everyone/media would say he lied so might as well tell his true feelings. I think this is very minor compared to all our problems.
7 | Barbara Bain | 10154713725651336_10154713881576336 | I liked Trumps final statement and with the people he chooses for his cabinet ... I believe he can make America Great once again . If not I really fear for my children and grandchildren .
8 | Vickie Colyer | 10154713725651336_10154713877886336 | There are many voters refusing to admit they are voting Trump, not because they are ashamed but because they refuse to take polls and refuse to give main stream media any information LOL
9 | Aaron Ahrens | 10154713725651336_10154713884791336 | Trump has done more to expose Hillary and the Dems than any Republican in recent memory. Yet, Fox is no better than the other news outlets about bashing him. Seems to me that they are want the country to burn just like the rest of them. I'm pretty disappointed in your "fair and balanced" philosophy. Its pretty disgraceful really.
10 | Cindy Koshinsky | 10154713725651336_10154713887716336 | Hillary was asked what she has done in the last 30 years of government office.. I heard her talking and saw her mouth moving, but she said NOTHING at all with substance. The answers were vague, and had no substance. She seemed to just talk and talk, but never really answered the question. It is based on this that I won't vote for her. She has done NOTHING for us as Americans.. and will continue to do absolutely nothing.
11 | Jeremy Yost | 10154713725651336_10154713882596336 | Hillary said Illegal Aliens pay more in income tax then Trump. Which in those cases mean they are using someone elses SSN, which now means the Illegal has committed 2 crimes.
12 | Mary J Thompson | 10154713725651336_10154713891866336 | As for making a final statement which was supposed to be not known... Hilliary was totally memorized, at one point lost her place, and then started again......Hilliary was playing on my last nerve... She vomits words and says nothing but dribble and lies..........DONALD TRUMP 2016
13 | James Dotson | 10154713725651336_10154713885891336 | Trump did great but; now Megan Kelly bashing him and sounding like CNN . Hillary was over prepared and had all her little talking point;'s all lined up.You could actually see her looking down at her note's as she talked.I am so sick of the media.
14 | Clara Espinoza | 10154713725651336_10154713883326336 | She said she wanted gun control to protect a little baby toddler for their life and then another breath she says that abortion should be done up to nine months till the baby is born I don't understand her she makes me sick to my stomach when she liar liar your pants suit from China on fire
15 | Tania Kicak Lafave | 10154713725651336_10154713911356336 | One thing I have to say, I'm so angry with the reporters right now on Fox news!!!!!!!! You idiots! You are hooked on him saying that he would think about accepting the outcome of the election????? REALLY? Get over it! Who the heck cares? Donald Trump did a great job! I as a voter am more concern about the state of our nation than I am about him not accepting the outcome or even questioning it! Way to go fox reporters! Are you all voting for Clinton? You sure sound like it! You are sounding like the liberal media! If I was him I would question it too! There has been so much corruption in this election it's frightening and yet you all are saying he's basically doomed because of him refusing to accept the outcome! You reporters have no idea what you are talking about! I'm frightened about Hillary becoming president!
16 | Mikensue Kellerman | 10154713725651336_10154713906736336 | How striking the contrast is! Hillary is the smooth polished political criminal. She's so rehearsed and vaguely obscure in her answers and retorts. Trump was succinct and plain spoken. A non- lawyer and non-political insider could listen to and relate to the thought process and response from Trump. He was believable she was evasive and cryptic.
17 | Tiffany Lynn | 10154713725651336_10154713912836336 | For the record...many many Americans feel that the presidential election is rigged....the reality is we need change and Hilary is unable to provide that. Trump is not "polished" but he is a change!
18 | Dorothy House | 10154713725651336_10154713893361336 | Does anyone remember, when her husband was president, he practically dismantled the military, she's far worse, she ( Clinton) has no respect for the military, she's scary
19 | Patricia Carey Bergelin | 10154713725651336_10154713881761336 | And you were made to hold your hand up & take a pledge..was criticized for it..and yet the others did not honor it..and now they want you to agree to accept outcome...media is corrupt..don't believe polls...they are running scared that the people want Trump
20 | Frank Linford | 10154713725651336_10154713912491336 | You know people,,,we are all very flawed. Sometime we act and talk in such a way that dishonors who we are...But we can all change and make a difference to people. I believe with all my heart and flaws that the Lord has given us Donald Trump.. I believe that he will fight every single day for us. You know last election 25 million Christians did not vote for one reason or another....Obama won by 3.7 million....Lets not let this happen again. All of us go vote, take car loads of Trump supporters to vote...We can do this, lets show the media who is going all out to keep us home, that We the People will vote, period.
21 | Brenda Kenfield | 10154713725651336_1146673092093162 | Don't forget that Hillary has a public and a private position. She was in public tonight. She just said what she wanted us to hear, not what she really believes. And she IS a puppet of George Soros!
22 | Patrick Perry | 10154713725651336_10154713885581336 | If it wasn't t Trump not promising to honor the election results, the liberal media would find another negative about Trump to put on the headlines! People aren t falling for it anymore and a good majority of people think there in mass voter fraud!
23 | Peggy Slagle | 10154713725651336_10154713881791336 | Trump answer to "accepting results" is not a debate win or lose factor, and Fox anchors and contributors have blown this out of proportion trying to say Trump stepped in it with his answer.
24 | Josh Pate | 10154713725651336_10154713887271336 | Hillary said it takes 4 minutes between the Presidents order and nukes flying.... Isn't that treason? She told the world a war secret that only the President should know
25 | Samuel Henshey | 10154713725651336_10154713889141336 | Yes..Donald's reticence to accept unequivocally the election results of the election as an honest election....was an honest assessment of the current state of the manipulation of the media campaign against the Republican conservatives.... This shows intellectual maturity...

--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Otto Wulff | 10154713809701336_10154713817376336 | Have you noticed when anything is brought up to Hillary that she can't lie her way out of it she laughs waits a few seconds and changes subject.
2 | John Mckinley | 10154713809701336_10154713812831336 | Trump wins! People around the world are waking up and revolting to the global agenda and radical Muslim invasion. Clinton is the most corrupt presidential candidate in living memory. Not to mention she bullied and insulted her husband's alleged rape and sexual assault victims. Obamacare is set to implode in 2017. So if you're a complete idiot then go and vote for Clinton and your godless agenda. You can put Clinton and Kaine in their own basket of deplorable's. 90% of DEMOCRATS, are burning flags, shooting cops, sitting down during the national anthem, rioting, and blocking traffic, not to mention the architects of the affordable care act that is due to implode in 2017, adding 10 trillion to the deficit, lest we forget giving the Iranians 1.3 billion dollars in cash in one of the worst deals in recorded history....But Republicans are the problem. All the media wants to cover is that Trump made some locker room banter 11 years ago. GO FIGURE!Trump
3 | Tina Guerriero | 10154713809701336_10154713816601336 | at one point I thought killary was going to have a stroke trying to yell above trump when she clearly went over her time again trying to run the debate. chris did a better job than the last 2 commentators.
4 | Cheryl Panik Kerr | 10154713809701336_10154713820061336 | Trump definately won this debate!  Meghan Kelly should go work for CNN though. She just tries her hardest to bring Trump down. Many Fox watchers turn the channel now when she is on.
5 | Justin Tuttle | 10154713809701336_10154713816186336 | Donald Trump absolutely won the debate, he wasn't as aggressive as last debate & should have pushed Clinton on more issues. He was still cool & calm & right on many issues he did mention.
6 | Rhonda Andrews | 10154713809701336_10154713820011336 | Trump definitely won. Wish Megan Kelly would move to CNN. She keeps pushing the issues with women and how Mr. Trump does not have women's votes. I am a female and I am definitely voting for Mr. Trump!!!
7 | Mary Pabiona Evans | 10154713809701336_10154713814586336 | Hillary cannot fool the American people, no matter how much she memorized her line, in fact it is obvious that she is making thing up, unless you do not know the fact, she could have fooled me, but I know the truth. She try to confused the American people with who hack the DNC website and blaming Russia, but people could careless who hack them, what is important is thee content and it shows this people are a bunch of crooks, that this election is rigged, that Hillary's campaign is corrupt and did some illegal voting activities and they got caught. Hillary will NOT lead this country, she do not deserve good American votes.
8 | Janell Hemsley | 10154713809701336_10154713835681336 | I don't know if he won, however, he showed she supports killing fetus who are live and living beings. As an NICU nurse I cared for babies at 23 weeks. These are people. She supports killing babies.I was undecided until tonight. Hillary will NOT get my vote!
9 | Aine-Annie Hodkinson | 10154713809701336_10154713817831336 | Donald Trump is for equal rights for all women;born and unborn... Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness whereas Hillary Clinton has said that partial birth abortion is ok and that the unborn do not have constitutional rights because they are not persons. The human heart begins beating at 28 days prenatal and does not stop until the day we die.
10 | Wanda McLamb Collins | 10154713809701336_10154713822181336 | Would be watching FOX News but Megan Kelley does NOT belong on your channel.... she is obviously biased and is an angry woman. It's showing.
11 | Richard Holcomb | 10154713809701336_10154713816181336 | Megyn Kelly go back to your motel room in Vegas pull the covers up and put two pillows over your head the world will be a better place
12 | Andrea Pilgrim Whittington | 10154713809701336_10154713832171336 | What's wrong with Megyn Kelly???? She really hates Trump. All she wants to do is bring up the women and his comment on if he'll accept the election results. Hannity did his show about the voter fraud last night. Dead people are registered to vote!!!
13 | Santigie Lawrence Sesay | 10154713809701336_10154713815511336 | The candidate representing the 'moral' party just called his opponent  "a nasty woman". Make America 'rude' again. And he ' RESPECTS' woman.
14 | Don Didio | 10154713809701336_10154713823596336 | When will Fox send Megyn Kelly over to MSNBC where she belongs? Her constant badgering on Trump to validate her claims that he's a sexist is Very old. I love FoxNews but I refuse to watch when that woman is on.
15 | Dori Griffith Blades | 10154713809701336_10154713821476336 | Well, she was cheating again!  If you go back and watch when the camera panned over, you could see the TelePrompter on her podium lit up!  Also, she was using signals across her chin and cheek again!So once again, she cheated and got help again!!I will not change my mind!  I'm angry!
16 | Jim Dunn | 10154713809701336_10154713820511336 | Finally A fair moderator which equals a Trump win. He would have won by a larger margin if Crooked Hillary would have actually answered the questions asked to her.
17 | Dave Presutti | 10154713809701336_10154713836506336 | Fox News has the worse post debate analysis I've ever seen. Megyn Kelly is horrible! Brit Hume is negative. Dana Perino is her usual insufferable self. Bret Baier is a wuss! Juan Williams is a dope. Had to turn it off.
18 | Andrew James Sanchez | 10154713809701336_10154713825636336 | Don't know what they were getting at when Trump was asked about accepting results of election. I remember Gore not accepting the results, and Kerry not accepting the results when they lost. So...I guess what goes around comes around! However, Trump will win so big it is not going to be close, unless Soros programs his voting machines for Clinton!
19 | Tony Sarrio | 10154713809701336_10154713840226336 | We were laughing so hard when Bret and Megyn were reading headlines from all of the mainstream media . Of course they are going to find anything possible to bash Trump. I got news for you two shills. The American people do not see things your way. We know what you are doing.99.9% of the comments are against you. Your reporting lies has no merit. People are not buying it.
20 | Ziaul Hashem | 10154713809701336_10154713817051336 | I haven't heard anything new from Mr. Trump which can change my decision. I was going round and round with same statements we have hard 100times...some of them were totally made up anyway...and facts checked before. Trump was boring!
21 | Rose Elizabeth-Leigh Williams | 10154713809701336_10154713838146336 | Megyn Kelly is the all-round biggest Pinhead on Fox News. Trump gave the right answer about the election results. Are you kidding me? On the day that all this video is reviewed after several days of this coming into the light about voter fraud. They say they've been doing this for 50 years? And he supposed to just smile and say oh yeah sure no problem? This is why he's going to win because nobody forces him to be politically correct and smile for the cameras and not Rock the Boat. He's going to win by a landslide so it isn't going to be a problem for him to accept because so many Americans are going to offset the scheming voter fraud it isn't going to matter. Get over yourself Megyn Kelly. You are no Barbara Walters.
22 | Joe McMullins | 10154713809701336_10154713847251336 | Eric tell you Dad to remind the people in his rally's about Hillary's early years.                                                                                            I just saw this post, I encourage people to read.                                                How quickly we forget! If you’re over 35, take a walk with me down memory lane—you won’t believe what you have forgotten. If you’re under 35, read on—I promise you that you will be amazed at what you missed! (By the way, sadly, this isn’t a joke. I wish it was.)REMEMBER WHEN BILL CLINTON WAS PRESIDENT?(January 20, 1993 to January 20, 2001—two terms)When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over an attempt to reform health care. Her proposed plan was so bad that many Democrats came up with competing plans of their own in protest, and in spite of threats and intimidation, on September 26, 1994, the “Hillarycare” bill was declared dead.This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million for studies, promotion, and other efforts.Then, President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general. Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood—both were forced to withdraw their names from consideration. Next, she chose Janet Reno, which husband Bill described as "my worst mistake." (Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.)Husband Bill also allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission—Lani Guanier was her selection. After considerable backlash from prominent Democratic senators concerning Ms. Guanier's radical views, Bill Clinton withdrew her name from nomination, stating that she did not represents the civil rights views that he had championed during his campaign.However, apparently a slow learner, husband Bill continued to allow Hillary to make more recommendations. She chose former law partners, Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department. Her selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kennedy was forced to resign. (Is anyone wondering yet what her Supreme Court Justice appointments would be like?)Many younger voters will have no knowledge of "Travelgate," the first major ethics controversy during Bill’s presidency.Hillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend, Harry Thompson—but the White House Travel Office refused to comply. She trumped up allegations of financial mismanagement and reported seven long-time White House employees to the FBI. This ruined their reputations, got them fired, and caused a thirty-six month investigation. Eventually, most of the employees were reinstated and Clinton associates were forced out of the travel office. Only one White House employee, Billy Dale, was charged with a crime—the enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds; a jury acquitted him in less than two hours.Still not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House Security. When Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies (Filegate) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff, suddenly Hillary and the President denied even knowing Livingstone, and of course, denied knowledge of drug use in the White House.Following this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents.Next, when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by Bill Clinton, Hillary was put in charge of the "bimbo eruption" and scandal defense. Let’s look at some of her more notable decisions in this regard . . . She urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation, they settled with Ms. Jones. She refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor. After $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr's investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs. Hillary's devious game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for 'lying under oath' to a grand jury, followed by his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives. Hillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, "I do not recall," "I have no recollection," and "I don't know" a total of 56 times while under oath. (Sound familiar?) After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had "mistakenly thought was hers."So you see, the email scandal and all of her malfeasance regarding the handling of Top Secret information, not to mention the "pay to play" schemes of the Clinton Foundation, are nothing new. Hillary’s entire political career has been nothing but a web of lies, corruption and destruction in her quest for power.
23 | Michelle Owens Stokes | 10154713809701336_601323583401272 | I have always had more respect for Fox News over any other news channel until lately. Starting with Kelly. Kelly has always been so open minded and treated the Republican Party with respect when others only told lies. Now she and other on Fox have fallen to the lies of Hillary fans. I couldn't agree with Eric more - BUT the way the media is against Donald Trump makes it really hard to call this a fair election!!!
24 | Marquitte Shannon | 10154713809701336_10154713832576336 | My God, wtf is up with your commentators!? They want to focus on Trump not stating if he will be happy with the outcome and accept it more than they want to focus on anything Hillary said. It will be a media outcry not because the public cares, but because it covers for the fact Hillary wouldn't address any of her crimes. I swear it feels like I'm watching CNN.
25 | Gisella Mortelliti | 10154713809701336_10154713856411336 | I think Trump is a real fighter. He hates to lose! What's wrong with that? Don't we want someone like that to lead us and want to actually win? And he is right in defending himself against the liberal media. It is our media that now elects our presidents, not the people.

"I'm reaching out to all Americans: Democrats, Republicans and independents, because we need everybody to help make our country what it should be." 

Hillary Clinton made a statement at the end of the final debate, adding she "knows the awesome responsibility of protecting our country."
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Ken Boonie | 10154713753771336_10154713779986336 | Hillary said Trump's buildings were constructed with steel from China. He should have asked her where her pantsuit came from.
2 | Jason Edge | 10154713753771336_10154713777531336 | Did anyone else catch Hillary's statement about what Trump said. She said "first when I hear Donald talk like that and know that his slogan is make America great again I wonder when he thought America was great". So basically I take it as she is saying America is not great nor ever was.
3 | Peri Nope | 10154713753771336_10154713778276336 | Meghan Kelly should go work for Hillary since she loves her so much....
4 | Skull Tierra | 10154713753771336_10154713779251336 | Why did she just tell the entire world how long it takes for us to launch a nuke?? Shouldn't that be "top secret classified???" She just proved herself to the nation, that she gives classified material.
5 | Kathy Dierking | 10154713753771336_10154713779811336 | Listening to Megyn and Brett. Megyn needs to quit going after Trump and the women. She can't get past it and talk about policies! She has a major problem!
6 | Kiersten B Coats | 10154713753771336_10154713782181336 | Reaching out to all Americans??? So that's why she insulted Trump supporters calling us Deplorables, irredeemable? Oh please lady! First she insults us, lies to us then expects us to believe she's reaching out to all of us?? The only thing she knows about protecting our country is silence!! She blames everyone else but herself. What a load of horse crap!
7 | Beverly Gerard | 10154713753771336_10154713781101336 | where was that protection for the four men murdered in Banghazi and lied about it to the faces of their loved ones ... ????
8 | John Taylor | 10154713753771336_10154713777016336 | Hillary said "I'm appalled" ....ironc coming from the criminal.
9 | Robert Brown | 10154713753771336_10154713779781336 | I give Wallace a 4 out of 10. He ask Trump about the lying Women but never ask Hillary about her Raping Husband. just say No to Say NO to Hillary Clinton for president and YES to Donald Trump For President Great job on the Debate Mr. Trump you knocked it out of the ball park.
10 | Mary Ann Chandler | 10154713753771336_1163901157035797 | I used to hate Hillary but I listened, researched, and read about her work and policies but you know what after over 30 years of studying all that she has done!  I still hate Hillary Clinton.
11 | Sam Morifi | 10154713753771336_10154713777476336 | It's NASTY that Hillary Clinton ignored the cries for help from Ambassador Steven before he and several other Americans got slaughtered by savage Muslims in Benghazi. It's NASTY how she exploited the people of Haiti. It's NASTY that Hillary Clinton defended a rapist and laughed about it. It's NASTY that she had 6 billion dollars unaccounted for as Secretary of State. It's NASTY how she claims to support women's rights but still accept donor money from countries that oppress women. It's NASTY that she purposely deleted evidence that could have put her in jail. It's NASTY how the mainstream media is eating right out of her hand. So yes I agree with Trump's so-called controversial statement. She is a NASTY woman!- sincerely, an angry deplorable from Africa
12 | Luci Brown Stefek | 10154713753771336_10154713782866336 | Why aren't you asking Hillary why she DID NOT answer the question given to her about how she treated All those many women her husband had sex with and raped!!!She Never answered at all!!!!!Why aren't you reporters asking questions about this???????

14 | Berni Wilson | 10154713753771336_10154713791426336 | What a lie! She called half Americans deplorable, her campaign and her don't respect Catholics and evangelicals and pander to food grouped people! Btw Fox News - with Megan kelly and Brit Hume I swear we are watching CNN! Disgusting!

16 | David Dalley | 10154713753771336_10154713793281336 | Tell Kelly on Fox News to stop talking about the stupid women complaints . This has nothing to do with running the country. If it really happened they would have filed charges the week it happens yrs ago. Not during a election. For fame and $$.
17 | Justin Layle | 10154713753771336_10154713788726336 | Megan Kelly should work for CNN, Hillary Clinton knows nothing about protecting America when asked to send support for Bengahzi she ignored the requests and cost 4 Americans their lives she is " Such a NASTY woman".
18 | Susan Sue | 10154713753771336_1449191988443733 | Someone asked me today how I stand up for Trump, a misogynist, a racist and a bigot. Here is my answer: Because I use my head to research and find out what candidates really are, not what the media wants me to think.Because DT has more women in executive and managerial positions than any comparable company, which tells me he is not a misogynist. ...Because he pays these women the same or more than their male counterparts, which tells me looks for capacity and skills in people, not color, gender or race.Because he fought the West Palm Beach City to be able to open his newly purchased club, so he could include blacks and Jews as members, who had been banned until then. This tells me he is not a racist.            Because he has raised wonderful children that have turned out to be outstanding, hard working and compassionate adults. He must be doing something right.    Because his economic plans makes sense, are conservative in nature, and I vote based on what is best for my family, my friends and my country.Because everybody, the left and the right are afraid of him, the media is trying to destroy his image, and even foreign governments are voicing their opinion, so he must be doing something right. Clean house maybe?    Because I want a SCOTUS that will uphold the Constitution, not behave as minions of the administration. I have had enough with judges that are more like political activists than law enforcers. I do not want the same fate for the SCOTUS.Because I fear for my family's safety if the current trend of not confronting blatant terrorism continues, which is a threat to our way of life.            Because I am fed up with the rampant corruption of this administration. Accountability in government is paramount and, as this administration has demonstrated, it is a foreign concept to them.Because I am fed up with the political correctness gone wild, and because he is not afraid to say what everybody thinks but does not dare to say. A thug is a thug, regardless of color, and that's it.          Because it is about time someone puts America's interests ahead of other countries.  Because I know he recognizes and embraces America's exceptionalism, and will not tour the World apologizing for who we are. That tells me he is a patriot.  Because, unlike HRC, he has actually held a job, worked hard and achieved success.And last, but not least,Because I am more offended by what Hillary does than by what Trump says. I could have gone on and on, but I think you get the picture.
19 | Jamie Lynn Johnson | 10154713753771336_10154713798376336 | Hmmm she had to resign as Secretary of State, she failed miserably at the lower office so now let's put her in charge in the highest office. Liberal logic is absurd. God help us all! Vote Trump and let's put Hillary where she belongs BEHIND BARS!
20 | Kristy Townsend | 10154713753771336_10154713782456336 | She had the opportunity to protect and serve the American public. She failed us miserably. She is responsible for the death of 4 American's. Not to mention the corruption that seems to surround her!
21 | Cathy Giancola | 10154713753771336_10154713785196336 | OMG Megan Kelly.....what the hell is wrong with you.  "Look at her"...it's an entire person.....Look at you.....you should be on MSNBC because you're so misunderstood.Sounds the same to me.  LOOK at her as a person - I got that, but you are part of the bias hungry media and don't get it.
22 | Jill Kelly Keefer | 10154713753771336_1790953004481250 | Hey Fox News.......I agree with Donald Trump.......Hillary is a nasty woman!!!!  Who gets rich while they are in "public" service?She should be in prison......such a lying person!! Oh btw......I am a college educated woman and I totally support Trump!!Oh....please get rid of Megan Kelly!!!!😤
23 | Homer Mullins | 10154713753771336_10154713781821336 | She "knows the awesome responsibility of protecting our country"........... but couldn't send help to protect our men in Benghazi.
24 | Bonnie Kilpatrick | 10154713753771336_1449191465110452 | Hillary Clinton made a statement at the end of the final debate..."knows the awesome responsibility of protecting our country.".... funny.. she doesn't care about protecting the innocent unborn, she didn't care about our Ambaasador in Libya or the other Americans in Benghazi.. get the picture.. Hildabeast only CARES ABOUT HERSELF and her family and their fortune and power grab.. 😈😈😈
25 | Richard Pasiut | 10154713753771336_10154713785486336 | She's done a good job of memorizing her lines and canned phrases... academy award material.. But Trump is hitting on the real problems of our Country.

Donald J. Trump disagreed with Hillary Clinton's characterization of him as being "cavalier" and "casual" about the use of nuclear weapons. http://fxn.ws/2eTjiXF
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | David Johnston | 10154713519921336_10154713725401336 | The reason Donald Trump did not agree to accept the outcome of the election. It's because all the theifth the Democrats have done. Plus he flat out won the debate. So many questions she didn't want to answer.
2 | Jay Jones | 10154713519921336_10154713722421336 | Hillary is guilty of treason and she knows it.........Hillary will finish destroying this Nation and can only "win" this election through fraud and cheating
3 | Dan Belle | 10154713519921336_10154713728586336 | Omg!!!! Fox news stop saying he refused to accept the results of the election!!!!!! That is NOT what he said stop trying to make up our minds,,  he said he would let you know when it happens, he like hundreds of millions of people are suspect of what is going on, and you talking about it proves it.  Shut your opinionated one sided pie holes!!!! Its been 15 minutes now and you haven't even mention killarys name
4 | Josie Milone | 10154713519921336_10154713726191336 | How in the heck do we get the Bush cheer leader, Megyn Kelly, Juan Williams discussing the debate with us??? Fox what the heck are you thinking???
5 | Karen Fiorentino-Christensen | 10154713519921336_10154713722091336 | Because I can't trust Hillary, you have my vote Donald Trump.
6 | Kathleen Griffin | 10154713519921336_10154713728416336 | Trump won the Debate. Wallace did a great job. That was a tough one. Sometimes people who are guilty are full of words and people who are full of action few words. TRUMP spoke the TRUTH!
7 | Marie Sweeney Foxx | 10154713519921336_10154713725056336 | OK, I am not for either of these idiots!!! But here are a couple things to think about. Perhaps the russians are hacking the dnc because Hillary got caught sending top secret info and they can't get that info anymore? Because Trump didn't pay taxes he is a bad guy? Let me ask you this, if you had the chance to take advantage of the loopholes to pay less taxes or no taxes, would you do it? Of course you would. What Hillary did was illegal. What Trump did with taxes was LEGAL. Again, I am not for either candidate.
8 | Sherry Chowka | 10154713519921336_10154713737646336 | " I hear that train a comin’It’s rollin’ round the bend.Gonna pick up Mrs. ClintonAnd take her to the pen.They’ll have her coronationMake her cell block queenHillary for prisontwo thousand and sixteenThey’ve got an orange pants suitHangin’ on the wallAnd a cell for Bubba WillieJust a little down the hall.We’ll put ‘em in the big houseLock them up inside.Unless a whole lot of witnessesCommit suicide.Remember James McDougalAnd 20 or 30 moreAbout to testify, they found ‘em dead upon the floor.Now they’re pilin’ up the bodiesLike they did back thenThey want back in the White HouseHere we go again.Glue the china to the tableNail the table to the floorLock up all the silver‘fore they haul it out the doorWhite trash in the White HouseBeats all I’ve ever seen.Hillary for prisontwo thousand and sixteen
9 | Anthony Johnston | 10154713519921336_10154713735046336 | Trump knocked it out of the park. He was detailed on his policy. He stuck by the Constitution. And, he was the only one who brought up the Veterans. That is the Leadership that our Great Country deserves. Congratulations Mr. Trump...Very Presidential!
10 | Rory Mambo | 10154713519921336_10154713735861336 | I agree with Donald J. Trump for the life of me, I can't accept having a criminal, liar, who doesn't believe in Catholics, calls people who are deplorables, basement dwellers, disprespects Police..law and order, let people die and lie to their families, who takes money from Countries who treat women horribly, and kill gays and lesbians, who wants to go to war with Russia.... as a President for our Country..So I can't say I would accept more years of her. So VOTE TRUMP not to accept her
11 | Charles Kimmel | 10154713519921336_10154713740666336 | Blow hard Megyn goes back to her regular smears preferring not to discuss the debate, but to smear Trump based on the gold-digger Gloria Ared clients' fradulent claims and accusations.   You are nothing but a Hillary Clinton troll Megyn!
12 | Joseph Brasington | 10154713519921336_10154713741001336 | With all the corruption that is clearly seen in the Government from the President, Attorney General, FBI Director, the Media, Hillary Clinton and her campaign that is readily staging mass voter fraud across the country;  can we blame Trump for answering the question like he did about accepting the out come of the votes on election day?
13 | Marcia Boon Green | 10154713519921336_10154713733026336 | Let's be straight fox....Trump said "we'll see" he did NOT say he wouldn't accept the nomination..... He's HONEST.... unlike Hillary.... proven...Remember, proof now that the DNC has went after Trump and pushed for violence....they also have the media in their pocket! You are making me sick....
14 | John Rillaerts | 10154713519921336_10154713728636336 | That Hillary is a number, a number that people who like to be slaves and dependent of the government will follow blindly. It takes a lot of will power and effort to become independent from the government machine. brainwashed Liberals are comfortable in their role as slaves. Time for a president that sets things right. Time for TRUMP
15 | Joey Diaz | 10154713519921336_10154713725421336 | That is not anything new Hillary is a plain liar nothing knew! We need to rally Republicans and Democrats and Independents alike, in order to show the American People that actions matter much more than words!
16 | Patricia Leighton | 10154713519921336_10154713745201336 | People are already misquoting Trump & it will be the headlines tomorrow. Trump did not say he would not accept the results of the election, just said he will look at it!!!
17 | Tamera Marten | 10154713519921336_10154713736606336 | Why was Hillary continually looking down through out her responses?  Why was she provided a lighted podium and Donald Trump wasn't?  Was there a thorough examination of the podiums before they walked out on stage to ensure there was no cheating?  Because of her special treatment....there is no room for anything but examination of the details before the debate.
18 | Tim Flynn | 10154713519921336_10154713739551336 | Man Megan Kelly is still a bitter woman! There's no redeemable qualities on either candidate but she has to keep piling on Trump.Get over it all ready and shame on Fox for letting her drone on every night.Hillary should be in Jail and Donald should be on the Apprentice.
19 | Virginia Roberts | 10154713519921336_10154713756801336 | I hate listening to Megyn Kelly.. all she does is put Trump down.. I am so sick of that woman.. can't you get Hannity for once? No, because you want Trump to lose!!!
20 | Alma Spicer Beal | 10154713519921336_636487559859364 | I use to really like Megan Kelly but have lost all respect for her after this election coverage. She continued to attack Mr. Trump like she is the voice for all women. Well not this one I 100% support Trump over Hillary. I find it odd that all these women are coming forward all of a sudden that never spoke out before. Get over yourself Ms. Kelly we are sick of here you.
21 | Michele Arocha | 10154713519921336_1308849769134289 | I thought the debate was good.  Chris Wallace did a great job.  However, you have to get rid of Megyn Kelly.  She is always pushing the negative female things against Donald Trump.  Get on issue...
22 | Lynda Keller | 10154713519921336_636484399859680 | Megan Kelly is not a good face of Fox news she is antagonistic toward Mr. Trump as she has been from the first.  Do not treat the Americans like they do not read the news. Lay off the woman thing we are so tired of that! Clinton of all people should shut it about women.  Enough Megan !
23 | Michelle Foust | 10154713519921336_1308849902467609 | I'm really tired of Megyn's personal dislike clouding her coverage. She needs to get it together. This accepting the election results thing is being way overblown. He was putting the DNC on notice regarding voter fraud.
24 | MaryJo Wilkes Holly | 10154713519921336_636485516526235 | With friends like Fox News, Mr. Trump doesn't need enemies! Especially Megan Kelly! She's obviously still holding a big grudge against him from that primary debate!
25 | Marge Dovichak Burkell | 10154713519921336_636485966526190 | Donald J. Trump is NOT alienating women voters Megyn Kelly..... YOU are!!!  Get off the stupid locker room crap and focus on the issues!  We are now turning YOU OFF rather than listen to your harping. There's nothing worse than a harping woman.

Donald J. Trump to Hillary Clinton: “The problem is you talk but you don’t get anything done.” #Debates2016 #FoxNews2016
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Kate Marie | 10154713533946336_10154713670471336 | She wants to be the president for ALL Americans yet those aborted aren't important enough. Maybe because they can't vote. She is a disgrace. No flag pin, murdered Americans in bangazi, deleted emails, lying to the American people over and over. She needs to be elected for a inmate position in JAIL!!
2 | Skull Tierra | 10154713533946336_10154713671381336 | Why did she just tell the entire world how long it takes for us to launch a nuke?? Shouldn't that be "top secret classified???"
3 | Cinde Keep Smith | 10154713533946336_10154713676446336 | She verified 2 strong things. She going to change our Constitution and  make tax payers foot the bill for abortions including babies of 9 months gestation. Disgusting
4 | Wayne R Johnson | 10154713533946336_10154713670661336 | Hillary's political record is built from greed, stained with blood and covered with a whitewash of lies and conveniently fake excuses of stupidity whenever; the lies begin to weaken in a rain of truth. Where is her admission or her apology?It's not hate, it's not discrimination, it's love and responsibility to do our part as Americans and Christians.On a plane you are told "In case of an emergency oxygen mask will drop from the console above, put the mask on YOURSELF FIRST then help children or others." We are given these instructions before a flight.Why? So that we maintain consciousness to help others. Jesus tells us "FIRST take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye.” (his story regards judging but the principle applies)The only way America can continue to help the world is to make sure we keep America strong.Some don't realize the extent of danger they are in when the mask falls, they try to put the mask on others first. In doing so they lose consciousness and become oblivious to their surroundings.America is in an emergency. The mask has dropped and we cannot afford to become oblivious to your surroundings.We must fix ourselves so we can continue to be the nation of hope and freedom. Trump understands this analogy, He wants to protect America first and fix the issues toMake America Great Again.One nation under God
5 | Keith Duncan | 10154713533946336_10154713678826336 | I cannot take credit for this, as I'm not the original author, but thought it is too important not to share.ALL Of A Sudden....Seven Short Years Have Passed!Before Obama, There was virtually no outlandish presence of Islam in America.• All of a sudden, Islam is taught in schools. Christianity and the bible are banned in schools.• All of a sudden we must allow prayer rugs everywhere and allow for Islamic prayer in schools, airports, and businesses.• All of a sudden we must stop serving pork in prisons.• All of a sudden we are inundated with law suits by Muslims who are offended by American culture.• All of a sudden we must allow burkas to be worn everywhere even though you have no idea who or what is covered up under them.• All of a sudden Muslims are suing employers and refusing to do their jobs if they personally deem it conflicts with Sharia Law.• All of a sudden the Attorney General of the United States vows to prosecute anyone who engages in 'anti-Muslim speech'.• All of a sudden, Jihadists who engage in terrorism and openly admit they acted in the name of Islam and ISIS are emphatically declared they are NOT Islamic by our leaders and/or their actions are determined NOT to be terrorism, but other nebulous terms like 'workplace violence."• All of a sudden, it becomes Policy that Secular Middle East dictators that were benign or friendly to the West, must be replaced by Islamists and the Muslim Brotherhood.• All of a sudden our troops are withdrawn from Iraq and the middle east, giving rise to ISIS.• All of a sudden, America has reduced its nuclear stockpiles to 1950 levels, as Obama's stated goal of a nuke-free America by the time he leaves office continues uninterrupted.• All of a sudden, a deal with Iran must be made at any cost, with a pathway to nuclear weapons and HUNDREDS of BILLIONS of dollars handed over to fund their programs.• All of a sudden America APOLOGIZES to Muslim states and sponsors of terror worldwide for acts of aggression, war, and sabotage THEY perpetrate against our soldiers.• All of a sudden, the American Navy is diminished to 1917 Pre-World War I levels Of only 300 ships. The Army is at pre-1940 levels. The Air Force scraps 500 planes and planned to retire the use of the A-10 Thunderbolt close air support fighter. A further draw down of another 40,000 military personnel is in progress.• All of a sudden half of our aircraft carriers are recalled for maintenance by Obama rendering the Atlantic unguarded, NONE are in the Middle East .• All of a sudden Obama has to empty Guantanamo Bay of captured Jihadists and let them loose in Jihad-friendly Islamic states. He demands to close the facility.• All of a sudden America will negotiate with terrorists and trade FIVE Taliban commanders for a deserter and Jihad sympathizer.• All of a sudden there is no money for American poor, disabled veterans, jobless Americans, hungry Americans, or displaced Americans but there is endless money for Obama's "Syrian refugee" resettlement Programs.• All of sudden there is an ammunition shortage in the USA.• All of a sudden, the most important thing for Obama to do after a mass shooting by two Jihadists, is disarm American citizens.• All of a sudden, the President of the United States cannot attend the Christian funerals of a Supreme Court Justice and a former First Lady because of previous (seemingly unimportant) commitments. **************************************************************************************************************All of a sudden, I’m sick to my stomach. I’m not sure the majority of Americans recognize the seriousness of the situation and how much “progress” has been made by Islam these last 7 years, a very brief time compared to a 75 year lifetime!🇺🇸 Yes, this IS Obama's legacy.
6 | Irene La | 10154713533946336_10154713672761336 | Why is Chris giving more time to Hillary and keeps cutting off Donald? I thought he was going to be fair. Or is he scare of the backlash from the leftish media?
7 | Rob Dedo | 10154713533946336_10154713676431336 | Killery just don't get it. Trump can lower taxes because there will be more businesses coming in and more people working so in reality there would be more people paying taxes and less people needing handouts so in reality it would be much better Trump's way. Also Trumps ways he would be closing the loopholes so the wealthy will also be paying.
8 | Darlene Grove | 10154713533946336_10154713691586336 | I am so sick of Hillary saying that she has spent her entire life 'working for women and children' - the only women and children that she has worked for is HILLary herself and the children is Chelsea. You do not spent your entire life working for others and become a Millionaire. She spews more BS than any woman and liar than I have ever seen.
9 | Brian Laskoski | 10154713533946336_10154713673331336 | Just wait in the coming weeks she will be throwing Obama under the bus after this beatdown and using his failures as a Hail Mary to the endzone with 2 seconds on the clock.
10 | Honey Wales | 10154713533946336_10154713679926336 | Stand up for children?? But, she supports late term abortions??? Hypocrite. He speaks from the HEART. She lies thru her teeth. DT is not making up the Corruption of the Clintons, most of this infor. has been out there for years - not thru the Main stream News Mafia, but thru other REPUTABLE sources.
11 | Tara Swope Saksek | 10154713533946336_10154713672806336 | Yes... Why would we actually negotiate with the countries who owe us the money. On second thought lets get the wealthy and middle and poor in America pay for everything by increasing our taxes!?!!? No thanks!
12 | Gina Gillespie-Marshall | 10154713533946336_10154713693681336 | As an undecided in Ohio. I was leaning towards Hillary but am now swayed by Mr Trump.  I didn't like that she avoided answering questions of integrity e.g. the Clinton Foundation or her stances and plans.  It seems like she spends most of her time cleaning up the problems she's created.  Glad I watched tonight
13 | Miguel Duhamel | 10154713533946336_10154713691221336 | She said it takes four minutes to launch nuclear missiles from the president why did he not come back with, it took U more than 13 hours to answer a phone call for Benghazi
14 | Rachel Morris Allgood | 10154713533946336_1874624882760871 | She talked about that poor little boy with blood all over his head, but abortion is OK ! She really think that the DEPLORABLES are STUPID ! Stop looking down your nose !
15 | Peggy Bucklin | 10154713533946336_10154713700296336 | Right off the bat Fox starts talking negative about Donald J. Trump because be did not say he would accept the results of the election. So fed up with all the news media.
16 | Isaac King | 10154713533946336_10154713681296336 | This election is all about issues:1. Supreme Court: We need conservative Judges otherwise this country will be a abortion country, lesbian country, Islamic country, and poor country (18 T debt), more spending than earning country, more taxing country in the world. I do not want my teenage daughter will go to a restroom where a grown man is. God cannot bless America if we do not have justice through right judges who follow the biblical values.Mr. Trump committed to appoint Judges who support biblical and our constitutional values. He already named 20 most conservative judges for Supreme Courts and other courts.Hillary promised to appoint Judges that support abortion, same sex, Islamazition. Obama named Muslim judges for courts and suggested Sharia laws, and Hillary will continue Obama’s polices.2. Protection: Government is all about protection. As a country we cannot allow other countries to dump their criminals, addict ones into USA to harm us, destroy us, and kill us. Mr. Trump committed to protect American citizens with number one priority whatever necessary such as wall, strong military, tough diplomacy, peace through strength, small government for small business.Hillary will open borders, open access to Muslims, cut military funding as Obama did, give Nukes to our enemies as Bill did to N. Korea, Obama open the door for Iran, big government, more spending with high taxes on every paycheck. 3. Job creation: Taxing the companies in the highest way will force them to leave USA. Bill did it that causes China to become rich and powerful. We will lose more jobs and there will be no such a thing "Made in USA." Clintons already made almost everything here "Made in China."Mr. Trump committed to cut taxes for all Americans, but will get money from foreign trades to run a small government.Hillary will raise taxes to everyone, every company, every paycheck; even she will tax to the churches as Obama passed already executive order. 4. Education: We need parents' choice school education system, not government forced one. Mr. Trump committed to vanish common core, Federal and state running school system. He will bring it to local, and give it to parents “We, the people”.Hillary will continue common core, more federal regulation and a federal education system with advisors who are Muslims and atheists. 5. Religious Freedom: We want government will not politically correct us through laws and punishment through any forms and titles. Mr. Trump committed to stop completely all political correctness where every Americans can enjoy religious freedom everywhere in the Land. Hillary will forced political correctness everywhere by laws and punishments. Pastors will be stopped by law and punishment to preach the biblical sermon, no sermon on the mountain. So do not vote your feelings, skin, sex, but use your brain for the good and bright future for you and your children as our forefathers did when they founded our nation. Make America Great Again by casting your vote for Mr. Trump. Thank you. God bless you. God bless America.-Prepared by Dr. King
17 | Matt Ernst | 10154713533946336_10154713700896336 | Chris Wallace has left her off the hook on answering two questions he posed which were never answered. 1. To explain her role in discrediting the victims of her husband (never even broached) & 2. Would she shoot down a Russian plane in her hypothetical no fly zone in Syria.
18 | Andrew Pate | 10154713533946336_10154713670961336 | Hillary Clinton, as a person, as a secretary of state. Folks, I'm here to tell you, there was no way this woman ought to be anywhere near the Oval Office. She ought not be anywhere near the White House. I don't care what Donald Trump's faults are, I don't care what people think of Donald Trump. This kind of corruption has got to be stoped. Trumps right the system is rigged @the Highest level
19 | Sharron Gibson Boling | 10154713533946336_10154713692451336 | Oh i love him!! Lets get a real american in the whitehouse! He blew her away!! Nice to hear someone stand up for us true Americans! Feeling happy!! Thank you Donald! My hero!!😊
20 | Oscar Bautista | 10154713533946336_1205963099478106 | Yes where the hell is the 6 billion dollars that's missing in the state department according to the Inspector General. Hillary should go to jail just for this single issue, never mind the hosts of issues we now know with written evidence about her crimes. Lock her up already.
21 | Mark Ferraro | 10154713533946336_10154713687401336 | Yea Killery from our pockets right to yours. And you got the nerve to Lie again and say "You'll stand up for us Americans " yea.. bull like you stood up for the American citizens you allowed to be brutality tortured and murdered in Benghazi. You are such a evil liar.
22 | Tee Fogo | 10154713533946336_1874624516094241 | Oh the media is stunned Trump is hesitant at saying he will accept the outcome of the election without question. Why should he ? We have illegals and dead people voting for Clinton. George Soros owned a company that supplies the voting machines. The FBI and doj conspired to keepHillary out of trouble. What's the worry?
23 | Dawna Ballard Rickord | 10154713533946336_10154713702786336 | Fox News is wrong. He can't accept the decision because the media is biased and tapes released today show Clinton campaign has tampered with the campaign. Media pushed this.
24 | Grisel Ortega | 10154713533946336_10154713704271336 | LET ME REPOST THIS AGAIN......I do not care if Donald Trump called a woman fat. I do not care if he likes "beautiful" women. What I do care about is that he assisted in sending a plane to pick up 200 Marines who were stranded after desert storm. I care that he supports our police officers and first responders. I care that he supports positive gun ownership and standing behind our military. I care that he supports the death penalty and is AGAINST abortion. I care that he supports enforcing immigration laws. I care that he wants to destroy radical Islamic groups. I care that he supports COAL. These are things I care about. Him talking in a private setting about a woman does not bother me. Were the things he said 11 years ago mean words? Yes. Were the words spoken in PRIVATE? Yes. Does he understand what he said in a PRIVATE conversation 11 years ago was wrong? Yes. Have you talked to your friends about the opposite sex in a private setting? Women, how about you? I'm positive all of you have. But, News Flash!! Women have been sexualized for centuries!! Jay-Z, Lil' Jon, Lil' Wayne, Eminem and every single other rapper helped establish that platform, but people are ok with music blasted all over the radio degrading women. Have you watched Victoria's Secret fashion show? Have you heard of Tilted Kilt? Hooters? People are ok with those as well. You want to make a change? Start there. Until all of these things are different, women will be viewed this way. Your precious Obama couldn't change that and Hillary can't either. Are these two the best candidates for the next President of the United States? Maybe not. Regardless, they are who we have, and I'm telling you, I want a President who is going to have the backs of those fighting for YOUR freedom and for YOUR protection. I'm not voting for a President based on their character. I'm voting for a President based on what they will do for OUR country. Donald Trump is that candidate.#trump2k16#trumpforpresident#votetrump
25 | Cassandra Rizer | 10154713533946336_10154713696476336 | Megan Kelly is Pathetic - Cannot stand her - She has been waiting for over a year to gloat === She is not a republican and She doesn't speak for Women. She is a Political Corporate Clinton Pusher. Americans are SICK of the BIAS in the media and she has been fighting against TRUMP since the first debate in the primaries. She should go work for CNN or DNC

Debate question: Will Donald Trump accept the results of the election?

Donald J. Trump: “I will tell you at the time. I’ll keep you in suspense.”

Hillary Clinton: “That’s horrifying.”

1 | Sheikh Musa | 10154713599241336_10154713630031336 | I used to hate Hillary but from 8 years i am searching and reading about her work and policies but you know what afrer all these 8 years i still hate hillary Clinton
2 | Tracy L Heyden | 10154713599241336_10154713630021336 | body language in psychology if you have taken that course.. tells you all ya need to know about killery
3 | Stacey N LeeAnne Ellertson | 10154713599241336_10154713631851336 | Nothing is more horrifying than a crooked, corrupt, lying, evil person like Hillary Clinton.
4 | Rick Stewart | 10154713599241336_10154713633896336 | Watching the debate, I'm not sure what's more striking: The smug, pompous arrogance of the disgusting, repulsive, hideous Hildabeast - or her ability to lie about her lies thinking nobody cares or notices !
5 | Adria Marshall Denzinger | 10154713599241336_10154713635496336 | Horrifying?  No, what is horrifying is you ignoring the pleas for help from four Americans, for 13 hours, while they were tortured, raped, and murdered, you evil witch.
6 | Kathy Ledet Relan | 10154713599241336_10154713632171336 | Why didn't he ask Hillary if she would accept the results of the election?
7 | John Spencer | 10154713599241336_10154713638041336 | Someone asked me today how I stand up for Trump, a misogynist, a racist and a bigot. Here is my answer: Because I use my head to research and find out what candidates really are, not what the media wants me to think.Because DT has more women in executive and managerial positions than any comparable company, which tells me he is not a misogynist. ...Because he pays these women the same or more than their male counterparts, which tells me looks for capacity and skills in people, not color, gender or race.Because he fought the West Palm Beach City to be able to open his newly purchased club, so he could include blacks and Jews as members, who had been banned until then. This tells me he is not a racist.            Because he has raised wonderful children that have turned out to be outstanding, hard working and compassionate adults. He must be doing something right.    Because his economic plans makes sense, are conservative in nature, and I vote based on what is best for my family, my friends and my country.Because everybody, the left and the right are afraid of him, the media is trying to destroy his image, and even foreign governments are voicing their opinion, so he must be doing something right. Clean house maybe?    Because I want a SCOTUS that will uphold the Constitution, not behave as minions of the administration. I have had enough with judges that are more like political activists than law enforcers. I do not want the same fate for the SCOTUS.Because I fear for my family's safety if the current trend of not confronting blatant terrorism continues, which is a threat to our way of life.            Because I am fed up with the rampant corruption of this administration. Accountability in government is paramount and, as this administration has demonstrated, it is a foreign concept to them.Because I am fed up with the political correctness gone wild, and because he is not afraid to say what everybody thinks but does not dare to say. A thug is a thug, regardless of color, and that's it.          Because it is about time someone puts America's interests ahead of other countries.  Because I know he recognizes and embraces America's exceptionalism, and will not tour the World apologizing for who we are. That tells me he is a patriot.  Because, unlike HRC, he has actually held a job, worked hard and achieved success.And last, but not least,Because I am more offended by what Hillary does than by what Trump says. I could have gone on and on, but I think you get the picture.
8 | Harriet Albright | 10154713599241336_10154713641081336 | Michelle Obama said if Donald Trump is elected: "We're telling our sons it's okay to humiliate women. We're telling our daughters this is how they deserve to be treated.".... that's funny. So does that mean that if Hillary Clinton is elected, we are teaching our sons & daughters that it's ok to murder, lie, cover up, be corrupt, demean women, use racial slurs, and stay with a spouse that openly rapes women & cheats on you?
9 | Melody Fitzwater Johns | 10154713599241336_10154713637756336 | She is disgraceful.  Couldn't even look directly at the camera when she talked about how she and Bill have "supported Haiti for years and years."  Yeah you lying cheat go home!
10 | Sally Hansen Pattok | 10154713599241336_10154713634501336 | Gore the loser didn't concede to Bush the winner.Gore sued. Repeatedly. And he & his supporters never accepted the results.
11 | James Sanders | 10154713599241336_10154713636011336 | What's horrifying are the OKeefe videos that the major media are trying to keep under wraps. Pretty much proves the DNC is capable of anything, including voter fraud.
12 | Megan Glisson | 10154713599241336_10154713639066336 | Why should he accept it? It's been proven she will cheat to get the nomination and she will stop at nothing, she will say anything to get in the White House. Even Obama says she will do and say anything she needs to say to get in the White House. If you are so sure you will legitimately win, allow voter ID to make sure people who aren't supposed to vote or are dead, don't vote. If you're so sure.
13 | Gerry Rickard | 10154713599241336_1256422221069559 | I learned something new during this debate. I learned where the mute button is on a Directv remote, I've used it every time Hitlery has answered a question. This has been the most enjoyable debate I've watched so far
14 | Linda Cracraft Albos | 10154713599241336_10154713636091336 | I wish Chris had better control of the debate. .he is letting mainly Hillary run over him. .they need to have a shock button. .you get out of hand you get zapped. .
15 | Darlene Howe | 10154713599241336_10154713641201336 | Trump is knocking it out of the park! She belongs in jail, why is she allowed to run at all? Because she must have a little black book on most of the big wigs in Washington.......... they're all afraid of her and we should be too.
16 | Linda Cracraft Albos | 10154713599241336_1755119774747990 | I agree the picture of the little 4 year old boy with blood on his face sitting in the ambulance is horrifying. .however so is the fact that she says an unborn child up to hours before birth has not rights. .or that a young 12 year old girl, that was raped by a older man, wanted the affection (and this is just my wording. .hers was worse) of the older man and then chuckle on video about getting the man off
17 | Natalie Thomason Golly | 10154713599241336_10154713651006336 | With all the found Hillary general election ballots, 10s of thousands in a warehouse in Ohio last month, All the dead democratic registered voters and no voter ID laws... he's correct not to just accept the initial outcome.
18 | Dave Tee | 10154713599241336_1755125291414105 | These past eight years have taught me to do something I'm ashamed of. I've actually hated  people. I try to fight it but this whole government and media has me pissed off to the point of hate for what they're doing and have done to this nation and its people. I'm disgusted by this woman.
19 | Diane Dunn Beck | 10154713599241336_1256419737736474 | What is horrifying is that Hillary Clinton has not been formally charged and is able to even run in the presidential election!
20 | Laura Smith | 10154713599241336_1256420901069691 | I love Chris Wallace, I trust him. I'm disappointed he's allowed HC to go on and on slandering Trump, she's had more time than he to spread her lies , bla, bla, bla. Her specialty in government is deception and yet she gets the most time. Where is the questions about emails, FBI, Benghazi , Wikileaks?
21 | Thomas Patterson | 10154713599241336_10154713644341336 | When Gore challenged his election results and took it to the supreme court the left had no issue with that. If it looks like fraud and corruption changed the result Trump should challenge, if not he should concede, won't know until nov 8th
22 | Elena M Siniscalchi | 10154713599241336_1256419897736458 | Well I won't accept the outcome if it is Killary because it will be a win from voter fraud!!!! So no, we Americans should not accept it and Trump shouldnt.. we fight back and revolt!!!!
23 | L Jason Queen | 10154713599241336_1755121618081139 | I will not accept nor recognize (George Soros) I mean Hillary Clinton as president of the U.S. "Doesn't matter what the press says. Doesn't matter what the politicians or the mobs say. Doesn't matter if the whole country decides that something wrong is something right. This nation was founded on one principle above all else: The requirement that we stand up for what we believe, no matter the odds or the consequences. When the mob and the press and the whole world tell you to move, your job is to plant yourself like a tree beside the river of truth, and tell the whole world -- "No, YOU move.” ~ Cap
24 | Jakie Hearn | 10154713599241336_1256420401069741 | Why didn't Chris ask her about all of Bill's women like he said he was....he ask Trump about all the women accusing him of different things but never went back to her about Bill.  Also, why didn't he ask her if she would accept the election outcome.
25 | Patty Meade Buzzelli | 10154713599241336_10154713648386336 | We all have seen- if you looked beyond the Lib media, that the democrats and obama administration have been signing up all kinds of people to vote that normally would not be able to vote..... muslim immigrants, illegal aliens, felons and dead people are on the voter rolls

Hillary Clinton hit at Donald J. Trump's economic record during the final debate, saying "he's given jobs to Chinese steelworkers, not American steelworkers." http://fxn.ws/2eTjiXF (Photo: AP/John Locher)
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Shane Todd | 10154713575301336_10154713589156336 | Only one person on that stage who created jobs. That's trump
2 | Brad Brower | 10154713575301336_10154713588036336 | There's also one candidate that has American bloods on her hands.
3 | Kayla Van Boven | 10154713575301336_10154713588871336 | While she puts rail road workers, and coal miners in America out of work.
4 | Jeffery Flatt | 10154713575301336_10154713600651336 | Actually Hillary, when your husband signed NAFTA he gave China steelworkers jobs,Trump had to buy the steel since thats where our steel comes from...this is all on you and Bill!
5 | Andrew Nemeth | 10154713575301336_10154713588996336 | Clinton says she did not know the ``C'' mark meant classified information and did not ``pay attention to different classification levels.'' Yet she had signed a binding classified information nondisclosure agreement.
6 | Cristi Chirtes | 10154713575301336_10154713590161336 | Hillary you are the worst and the worst criminal ever this country see the hole 245 years...that is a SHAME for ALL American people
7 | Linda Sullivan Creamons | 10154713575301336_10154713588486336 | and there is only one of you on stage who is responsible for deaths in Benghazi!!!!!!!
8 | Rockwell Torrey | 10154713575301336_10154713587671336 | You could lay the bodies left in the Clinton's wake on the steps of Congress, or deliver indictments for her every crime to the Supreme Court, and it would mean nothing to anyone except for the millions of Americans willing to say no more. We will stand together until Hillary Clinton is defeated. She may have the Media. We have the votes. We will save this Nation.
9 | Cindy Bryant | 10154713575301336_10154713594566336 | Fox News like I said, Chris Wallace is a registered Democrat. Can you count how many times biased Chris Wallace has cut off Donald J. Trump? Countless!!! Meanwhile, Wallace has allowed Hillary to run with her lies!!!! How much time did each candidate get? Donald J. Trump got 35:41 and Hillary Clinton got 41:46 as reported by CNN Politics. There you have it folks, Wallace sold out!! #TrumpPence16 #MAGA #BigLeagueTruth
10 | Lisa Land Coles | 10154713575301336_10154713589526336 | Hillary hasn't shipped any jobs to Mexico because she's never created any.
11 | GatesandCarole Conner | 10154713575301336_1467346489948298 | My father was a steelworker for 37 years, a coal miner for 10 years, and spent 4 years in WWII. He would never have backed Hillary Clinton. She does not represent anything he stood for or fought for. She is a catastrophe waiting to happen.
12 | Terri Nukem | 10154713575301336_10154713590556336 | If miss Cunton was THAT concerned about the laws that millionaires/billionaires take advantage of, then she would've changed it in those 30 years....but she uses them herself and that folks, is why she hasn't changed them. She benefits too. #DrainTheSwamp
13 | Bren Vieweg | 10154713575301336_10154713610751336 | After William Jefferson Clinton signed NAFTA there was no way US steel mills could compete against foreign steel mills anymore that's why Trump had to use Chinese steel.
14 | Cordell Smith | 10154713575301336_10154713605896336 | He buys the steel from China because Clinton and Obama cut out the coal that produces the steel in America!!!
15 | Gail VandeSande | 10154713575301336_10154713617151336 | I will no longer watch Chris Wallace and perhaps Fox news. So disappointed in the questioning and time given to Trump. Interupting Me. Trump nearly every time and allowing Mrs. Clinton to rant
16 | Linda Falke | 10154713575301336_10154713615631336 | There's only one person on the stage who's guilty of stealing the nomination ... and that's you, Hillary Clinton: professional liar and thief.
17 | Steve Sunderlin | 10154713575301336_10154713611036336 | Well -- True.  He is a businessman and the business environment created by Hillary's husband made it advantageous for Mr. Trump to do just that.  It would be foolish to buy American or keep your global company in US simply out of patriotism if you are at a business disadvantage against your global competition.  Donald wants to make the US a business advantage.  He wants to make companies want to come here, to stay here and to employ American workers.  If we make labor more expensive ($15 Min Wage) and if she wants to penalize corporations with higher taxes, they are going to leave because they have other choices.
18 | Holly Benschoter Copado | 10154713575301336_10154713598766336 | Seriously, Fox? Why isn't she asked point blank if she lied to the FBI? Ask if she deleted 33k emails after they were supoenaed?
19 | Daniel Royal | 10154713575301336_10154713591956336 | Just Let This Set In 15 dollars hour minimum wage that would make everything go up a 300-400 grocery bill will turn into 600-700 grocery bill collage buying a car or house clothes etc If you let people into this country you will not have job increase because they will get our jobs or create jobs we knows this Middle Class will become the ones barely making it
20 | Bob Cilino | 10154713575301336_10154713610371336 | I am not a Trump fan, but at least he has created real jobs. The only jobs Hilliary has created are for defense attorneys,  computer scrubbers, and paid protesters. Oh yeah and Debbie whats her name Schultz
21 | William Phillip Broadus | 10154713575301336_10154713617311336 | She never created a job or ran a business in her life. What has she actually accomplished in 30+ years of living off my tax money.
22 | Melissa Freelove | 10154713575301336_10154713593241336 | Because our government Jacks our taxes ! I would too  after all before he started running for the president of the United States or was he not a businessman do businessmen not try to make it the most money they can? But once he lowers taxes he can bring em back ! Thank you Hillary but you can go now !
23 | Jon Childrey | 10154713575301336_10154713592941336 | Did she forget about her husband's nafta deal to which she whole heartedly supported. Isnt that the kettle calling the pot black
24 | Eligio Bonelli | 10154713575301336_1793127307635919 | Dissapointed in Chris Wallace, not nearly enough questions on Wikileaks, and the few he did ask about weren't even answered by Clinton and he never pushed her into answering.  Yet he brought up the sexual allegations  about Trump again! !!!!
25 | Paulla Warren Johnson | 10154713575301336_10154713613811336 | Chris let her slip by from answering the question he asked her about Attacking bills women. That was a big error he has let her go off topic allot for extended periods of time

Say whatever you want but whoever is President major changes are on the way and I at least want to know I did my part urging people to get out and vote Trump!
3 | Tara Coker | 10154713540066336_10154713559606336 | What about the part of the question directed to her in reference to her defending Bill and his behavior?? She did a great job dodging that bullet...
4 | Sandra E Loggia | 10154713540066336_10154713559961336 | Chris Wallace gave Clinton a pass. She didn't answer her question about what she did to the women her husband raped and assaulted!!
5 | George Pattron | 10154713540066336_10154713557516336 | He's got that scag flustered and on the run!! Get her Donald!! Expose that liar for what she is: Just another Democrat who hates America!!
6 | Karen Nettleton | 10154713540066336_10154713560881336 | Hillary trashed the women Bill porked!And she's degrading Trump for allegations by women who have had DECADES to sue or charge Trump with a crime?!  😕F U, you lying piece of 💩!Go Trump!!! 🗽👍
7 | Sandra Herron | 10154713540066336_10154713553721336 | Clinton Foundation? Hillary says they spent 90%- and she is so proud of it.  How stupid does she think we are? Haiti hates the Clintons....Believeable right? Alright!
8 | Samantha Snyder | 10154713540066336_10154713558611336 | Trump brought his A game tonight. I cannot wait for the day when her sorry behind gets booted from Washington D.C. #IAmaDeplorable
9 | Juan Villacis | 10154713540066336_10154713552261336 | As American hispanics, we are tired of how all of these coward racist liberals that hate America like Obama, Clinton, and their supporters are trying to turn this great country into a 3rd world one. Unfortunately, one of the biggest problems we have right now is the media and entertainment that are always trying to tell us how to think. They have created enough imbeciles that would re-elect a failure like Obama. Even more, we're supposed to bow down to anti-American Obama, love liberal policies no matter how destructive they are, love bigger enslaving government, and be in favor of illegal immigration because of the color of our skin... disgusting. That's why we support Donald Trump. Show everyone your support for Trump by buying the fantastic Trump Strong t-shirt at: www.teespring.com/trumpstrong .And let's Make America Great Again! Thank you.
10 | Stacey Toole | 10154713540066336_10154713570786336 | Trump just hit a Home Run. It's about time somebody asked Hillary if she would return the money she got from Saudi Arabia, where they throw gays she champions from roofs and women can't do much......
11 | Tammy Ortega | 10154713540066336_10154713564716336 | Everyone should vote for Trump , he will make a good president for America, people are so  tired of being over worked and over Tax and under payed and unappreciated .Trump&Pence can and will fix this , and Clinton can't My Voice My Vote and I'm Voting for Trump&Pence.
12 | Steve Brown | 10154713540066336_10154713564411336 | Clinton is really bothered by "Russians" releasing all the info of her corruption to wiki leaks....she hates that all that info has been getting out, she changes the subject and goes into her robot fake politician training
13 | Debbie Mathes | 10154713540066336_806991076105234 | I was asked tonight how I could ever support Trump after the comments he made over 11 years ago about women and if I would still support him if he made those comments to my daughter? My response was this....If he had put our nations security at risk, I would not vote for him. If his organization received large donations from countries that killed women and gays, I would not vote for him. If he boasted 30 Years of government experience, but still could not discern if an email was classified or not, without someone letting him know if it was or not, I would not vote for him. If he boasted about how he has defended children his entire life, but is for abortion, (even late term, when the child can feel pain) I would not vote for him. If he wanted my 3 year old Granddaughter to go to restrooms with men dressed as women, I would not vote for him. I have taught my daughter and will teach my granddaughter to disregard sexist remarks and move on, especially when they were made so many years ago and, also to forgive those who say they are sorry. If he caused lives to be destroyed in Benghazi and then lied to the faces of the parents as they stood at their child's casket, I would not vote for him. If people who came against him mysteriously turned up dead, I would not vote for him. If he suddenly developed a southern accent when he was in the South, campaigning, I would not vote for him. If he continually broke the law and that was ignored, I would not vote for him, but right now, the only person who does all these things is Hillary. Right now, the fact that Donald made these remarks over 12 years ago, does not move me. I'm bigger than those remarks and we all have said stupid things throughout our lives. To me, the fact that Hillary lies continuously, is a much bigger problem. We can see the effects of her lies by the state of our poor country right now... Rant over... Still voting for Trump. (Copy and paste) WOW INTERESTING THOUGHTS ......
14 | Rick Stewart | 10154713540066336_10154713570776336 | Watching the debate, I'm not sure what's more striking: The smug, pompous arrogance of the disgusting, repulsive, hideous Hildabeast - or her ability to lie about her lies thinking nobody cares !
15 | Joe Mills | 10154713540066336_10154713609351336 | I'm so sick of her shaking her head. She does nothing but lie, she has no room to judge anyone. I do whole heartedly believe the groping accusations came from the Clinton camp. It's proved in wiki leaks that they have paid people to protest at Trump rallys. The Clinton camp have proven time and time again if you have read these documents that they will stop at nothing to get where they want to go.If she's is elected I hope all you sheep that voted for her gets everything thing you most certainly deserve and then some, and hope I can get thru it unscathed. I see no way for that to happen though.
16 | Callie Calhoun | 10154713540066336_10154713586936336 | Mike would be so disappointed in his son that he let Hillary slip on the Bill Clinton question as well as the Wikileaks email (that she wrote it), and that he also let her pivot on the question he asked her about Secretary of State and the Clinton Foundation! You, Chris are a disappointing disgrace! Way to let her pivot and give her little memorized speeches! You are part of the problem! Thanks for nothing but more bs from her mouth without answering!
17 | Rene Desrosiers | 10154713540066336_10154713586946336 | Chris just asked the same type of question as Brett And Megan asked the first debate with will you sign a pledge to support the nominee, tonight it is will you accept the results of the election?  Chris is losing it and showing us how much of a registered democrat.
18 | Patty Knight | 10154713540066336_10154713592476336 | Go Donald Trump! She's a liar and she does not need to run for president for a the emails she lied about and no women should be running for president any way! I vote for Donald Trump all the way!!
19 | Bryan Stamey | 10154713540066336_10154713593571336 | She is a Lying witch, George Soros has her and Obama in his pocket, he spends big money on them, he owns voting machines in 16 key states in 307 counties and Soros has said she is a done deal, I do believe this election is rigged.
20 | Liz Carragher Westerfer | 10154713540066336_10154713603711336 | Please people get out and vote trump.If Clinton does win this thing all of you morons who voted for her have noooooooo reason to complain about your taxes going up; or all these illegals taking your jobs and all the new random terror attacks. God help us all.
21 | Linda Held | 10154713540066336_10154713599836336 | Once again, like the first debate, she has a lighted screen in her podium that she's reading from. Trumps podium is completely dark when cameras view them both from behind!
22 | Carolyn Bieker | 10154713540066336_10154713573886336 | I turned it off when the food fight started...why talk about lies..wasted time..the women are lying...Wallace won't stay on topic and seems to give Hillary more time to talk...interrupts trump and stops in from talking...
23 | Sam Womble | 10154713540066336_10154713600566336 | Trump is telling the truth. Hilary did start these rumors. You can tell be the way NBC held the audio until debate time and then cooper anderson asking him the way he did. It was all set up
24 | Paula Ann Nix Poe | 10154713540066336_10154713592861336 | And who knows what else she has done and hasn't gotten caught ! It is rigged! Dead people vote,  non citizens vote, ,,,ballots are lost ,,not counted, ,,and some folks are so special that they can vote multiple times!
25 | Bob Jack Christiansen | 10154713540066336_10154713578021336 | This Christian is voting for TRUMP, I live in California and all my neighbors and friends are voting for TRUMP...We are tired of the lies and corruption of career politicians!!!!

And the media says Trump supporters are the ones trying to incite violence. I have screen shots of this comment and individual and have passed this info on to the FBI and various media outlets.
2 | Christy Chatman | 10154713483721336_10154713535621336 | Thank you, Mr. Trump, for wearing the stars and stripes!
3 | Dee Gardner Kramer | 10154713483721336_10154713538841336 | Clinton reminds me so much of her husband.... "I did not have sexual relations with that woman." She is lying to America, straight to our faces, just as he did! Lying & very good at it!

5 | Kiersten B Coats | 10154713483721336_10154713547876336 | if she wants to talk about Trump admitting to things??? How about she admit to lying about Benghazi and leaving those soldiers to die!! How about she admit to deleting 33,000 emails, bashing phones, lying under oath, leaking the 11 year old Trump comments, condoning violent protests, allowing her staff to interfere with voting.......Her list is way longer and more crucial to her competency at president!! Those are the important questions!!
6 | Andrew Lefebvre | 10154713483721336_10154713537781336 | Actually, she admitted to the truthfulness of wikileaks when hrc said "if you read the rest of that sentence" in reference to Chris Wallace's question about "Hillary giving a speech in a leaked email in wikileaks given to a Brazilian bank for a fee of $225000."
7 | George Pattron | 10154713483721336_10154713540896336 | He's got that scag flustered and on the run!! Get her Donald!! Expose that liar for what she is: Just another Democrat who hates America!!
8 | Lori Hinson Netherton | 10154713483721336_10154713542886336 | I can't stand watching this lying woman. she talks about how bad trump treats woman as Bill and her had to pay a woman over eight hundred K for raping her.
9 | Andrew Nemeth | 10154713483721336_10154713536696336 | Clinton says she did not know the ``C'' mark meant classified information and did not ``pay attention to different classification levels.'' Yet she had signed a binding classified information nondisclosure agreement.
10 | Bob Jack Christiansen | 10154713483721336_10154713561751336 | This Christian is voting for TRUMP, I live in California and all my neighbors and friends are voting for TRUMP...We are tired of the lies and corruption of career politicians!!!!
11 | Yvette du Beau | 10154713483721336_10154713550416336 | She's been DEFLECTING and LYING for years.  She's a pro at it by now. As soon as Chris brought up Wikileaks she brings up Russia so she doesn't have to actually respond to the question!  Chris never made her go back and actually answer the question.
12 | Liz Johnson | 10154713483721336_10154713574316336 | Shut up Hillary D.T. doesn't have to release his tax returns! And if he didn't pay a penny on his federal tax is because we had a tax break and all business did! And it was legal!  Hillary Clinton you disgust me!
13 | Sharon Menser Hoyt | 10154713483721336_10154713544016336 | I hope the American people see the corruption in Hillary , and shut her down . We have had enough of their lies and dragging this country through the dirt .
14 | Wayne R Johnson | 10154713483721336_10154713535861336 | Allegations against Donald Trump in these final weeks should be obvious. Yet the email leaks are actual proof about Hillary. Nobody bothered with any allegations until just a few weeks before the election. Think about it people!Dear Common Sense, We know you've been having fun being elusive, hiding from so many to see how they would act and what they would do without you, but please! We beg of you! Please come back! your presence is greatly needed. Needed by so many who are simply lost without you, some ignoring all the deceit, lies and corruption before their eyes and threatening to vote for Hillary Cinton anyway!Common Sense, All of America needs you to effect there minds once again before it's too late to "Just Say No" to more greed and corruption.
15 | Orlando Ramos | 10154713483721336_10154713545446336 | Alright I thought they did not know the the questions yet it looks to that Hillary keeps glancing down and appears to be reading her answers... just saying!
16 | Stephen Elsberry | 10154713483721336_10154713573021336 | " I hear that train a comin’It’s rollin’ round the bend.Gonna pick up Mrs. ClintonAnd take her to the pen.They’ll have her coronationMake her cell block queenHillary for prisontwo thousand and sixteenThey’ve got an orange pants suitHangin’ on the wallAnd a cell for Bubba WillieJust a little down the hall.We’ll put ‘em in the big houseLock them up inside.Unless a whole lot of witnessesCommit suicide.Remember James McDougalAnd 20 or 30 moreAbout to testify, they found ‘em dead upon the floor.Now they’re pilin’ up the bodiesLike they did back thenThey want back in the White HouseHere we go again.Glue the china to the tableNail the table to the floorLock up all the silverfore they haul it out the doorWhite trash in the White HouseBeats all I’ve ever seen.Hillary for prisontwo thousand and sixteen

18 | Carolyn Cantwell | 10154713483721336_10154713537931336 | oops, she is lying again. It is well documented she said she wanted open borders. Were those signs to the moderator again--all the swiping across her face--or just signs she is failing.
19 | Rick Stewart | 10154713483721336_10154713567896336 | Watching the debate, I'm not sure what's more striking: The smug, pompous arrogance of the disgusting, repulsive, hideous Hildabeast - or her ability to lie about her lies thinking nobody cares !
20 | Ivy Beltran | 10154713483721336_10154713594441336 | Hillary is not answering all the questions directly at all. She likes to stir around. Questions about the open borders & she answered about energy? Whaaattt?
21 | Deborah Williams | 10154713483721336_10154713545681336 | Obama blamed Bush for everything even hurricane Katrina, now Hillary blames the Russians... I have found it amusing, even weak when someone is guilty and refuses to take responsibility but instead casts a shadow on someone else to get out of the heat. Wonder what a Hillary presidency would look like.
22 | Sara Sangster Blas | 10154713483721336_10154713576546336 | Chris Wallace neeeds to back up and make Clinton answer the question about her support of the disgusting actions her husband was proven to have done as they had Trump have to answer his part of the question - what a crock!
23 | Donna Brown | 10154713483721336_10154713544701336 | If Republicans don't win this race this will likely be end of the two party system, and then that's the end of America and our constitution. Say whatever you want but whoever is President major changes are on the way and I at least want to know I did my part urging people to get out and vote Trump!
24 | Ella Andersen | 10154713483721336_1627821954183727 | Mike Wallace your really fair and balanced!!! NOT!! Hillary makes me sick!!! What a lying, evil woman. Look all she has lied about and is going to get away with it all!! She should never be able to run for this country!
25 | Ana Maria Barroso | 10154713483721336_10154713595866336 | Liberal women are so outraged because Trump likes pu#%ies, however, they don`t feel so offended about Hillary's supporting of people who subject women and little girls to FGM (Female Genital Mutilation), child marriage, covering women/girls with hijabs and burkas, honor killings, having acid thrown at their faces and bodies, being treated worse than animals (like property!), lack of rights, not allowed to drive cars, be educated or leaving the house without an escort!!! #VoteTrump2016

4 | Jerry Quinn | 10154713479741336_10154713502776336 | I'm scared for our country and for the people that love it. Our faith in Jesus should remain stronger than ever. Trump is not a perfect man, nor does he claim to be. He regrets things he has said, just as we all have at times in our lives. He owned it and moved on. That's what men do.  Did he deny it? Did he try to cover it up? Did he throw money at it to make it go away? No he didn't. He was a man and accepted responsibility. Unlike his opponent. She hasn't accepted blame for anything. As for Hillary I firmly believe Hillary is a liar, has blood on her hands, and covers the truth up.  She is God, in her mind. Her side covers it up and thinks she is above the law. She doesn't accept her transgressions or asks for forgiveness. Asking for forgiveness is a sign of weakness to her.I happen to find strength in forgiveness. My faith in Jesus is the very thought of forgiveness. Donald Trump in my eyes is a changed man.  People change, people's hearts change. His heart has changed and I feel with complete certainty he wants to help people that love this country and the greatness this country offers the world.Ladies and Gentlemen, if Hillary is president, there will be a domestic uprising in our present day, of historic measure. History will be made and unfold like never before, right before your eyes. Our country will be torn apart again, as it once was 150 years ago. Why, you say? Not because of race, not because of slavery, not because of states rights.  It will happen because of being a Christian and loving Jesus. Jesus is under attack in this country like never before. Is Our faith not valuable enough to fight for it? Should we lay down and not fight for our Savior? Should Christians go quietly into the night?A man's heart has changed, A man's heart has asked for forgiveness in front of the world for words spoken 11 years ago. What he said was wrong, no doubt, but I'm not letting those words minimize the actions of Hillary and what she wants this country to become. I choose to support Trump even with his flaws, they make him real, it makes him a person that can relate with most of us that want to be better. To be better than what you are today you have to look in the mirror. He may not like what he sees, but I my opinion, he is changing for the better. I will support anyone who looks in the mirror, recognize his issues, and makes true changes to better themselves. Hillary would never admit these things. She is perfect compared to anyone in her mind.
5 | Deborah Thibodeaux Guidry | 10154713479741336_10154713496556336 | All I had to hear her say was that she wanted to uphold Roe v Wade- that in and of itself is enough reason for me not to vote for her - not that I was even thinking about it
6 | Russ Balkema | 10154713479741336_10154713494261336 | This witch is going to start a war with Russia if elected.
7 | Juan Villacis | 10154713479741336_10154713491516336 | As American hispanics, we are tired of how all of these coward racist liberals that hate America like Obama, Clinton, and their supporters are trying to turn this great country into a 3rd world one. Unfortunately, one of the biggest problems we have right now is the media and entertainment that are always trying to tell us how to think. They have created enough imbeciles that would re-elect a failure like Obama. Even more, we're supposed to bow down to anti-American Obama, love liberal policies no matter how destructive they are, love bigger enslaving government, and be in favor of illegal immigration because of the color of our skin... disgusting. That's why we support Donald Trump. Show everyone your support for Trump by buying the fantastic Trump Strong t-shirt at: www.teespring.com/trumpstrong .And let's Make America Great Again! Thank you.
8 | Roberta Arnold | 10154713479741336_10154713504511336 | Blame the Russians. We are supposed to ignore the content of the e-mails. Of course, there are undercover videos too. Just ignore the woman behind the screen pulling the levers.
9 | Zach Kerman | 10154713479741336_10154713491206336 | Trump should offer to help pardon Julian Assange right now and recognize him for the brave hero that he is.

13 | Joyce Taylor | 10154713479741336_10154713675246336 | Democrats have not helped anyone in over 50 years.

14 | Wayne R Johnson | 10154713479741336_10154713502831336 | When you have No Resemblance of Ethics, Morals or Truth you get Hillary Clinton. Vote TRUMP/PENCE By Voting for Hillary you share in the assurance that unborn babies will continue to be killed. You share in her choice of Judges. You share in their decisions on the bench. When our streets are full of terrorist after the floodgates of immigration are opened you have yourself to thank, When your daughters are sharing locker rooms and bathrooms with cross gender boys or men you will have your vote to thank. When you're told you're breaking the law to stand with Gods word because someone believes it discriminates, you are responsible. When your weapons of defense are outlawed you can look in the mirror and know it was by your vote.
15 | Jose Sorto Salmerón | 10154713479741336_10154713629566336 | The undocumented people who work hard here in United States. They pay federal taxes helping the government system.

20 | Geri Ramsier | 10154713479741336_982607328518335 | Commentator did not let Trump finish anything, rudely interrupted Trump over and over. Hilliary read script and commentator few times softly gave appearance of trying to stop her, but let Hillary go on and on and on. Worst of debates for commentator unfairness and do believe unfair and I am not Trump fan. I think Fox being republican leaning went out of way to appear not Trump favoring to end up unfair to Trump. Media bias or just sexual bias?
21 | Don Marshall | 10154713479741336_10154713543431336 | Chris Wallace is letting her control the debate. Rattling on and on. Lost all respect for this man so far. His dad would be ashamed so ashamed
22 | David Burgin | 10154713479741336_564947690357133 | This is for the Black Voters only.First i am Republican and as simple as I can I will explain how is see you guys.Joe's car breaks down and needs a ride to work. Joe ask Bill for a ride and Bill says sure and when I get there I will help you fix your car, Joe says thank you. Monday Joe calls Bill, you still picking me up, Bill says yes and I'm bringing tools to help fix your car.  Bill forgets and goes to work and didn't even think or remember Joe. This goes on for months with Joe calling Bill and never being picked up or helped. You see Joe is the Black vote and Bill is the guy  that makes promises  (democrat) and never delivers. Joe is still calling Bill for a ride (dah) and Bill never keeps his promises. Joe when are you going to get it, Bill is never going to pick you up. You see Joe the Democrat black voter believes Bill is going to come bur he never does. Each day represents an election and Bill keeps promising and Joe keeps believing, it's time for Joe to ask someone else because Bill the Democrat will never help you.
23 | Mark Deda | 10154713479741336_10154713492291336 | Is Hillary's yellow teeth distracting to anybody else out there?

4 | Trenton Cassibry | 10154713468186336_10154713476286336 | The gun show loophole is a myth. For a FFL dealer to make a gun sale, they are required by law to run a background check regardless of where the sale takes place.

19 | Samantha Krier | 10154713468186336_10154713507871336 | Another terrible Clinton idea. Her higher minimum wage will kill small businesses. Free education. Given me a break. Nothing is free in our world. Someone is paying for it. Obama promised same thing. 8 years later nothing. She is gonna raise taxes. She isn't going to lower them.
20 | Kathy Brown | 10154713468186336_10154713490011336 | I agree Steph it is so Obvious she knows the Questions she is looking down reading and to well rehearsed like always .Liar crooked corrupt Hillary!!

22 | Margaret Blaylock | 10154713468186336_10154713507936336 | Doesn't take long listening to Hillary to understand that under her "leadership" we will slide further and further down socialism's slippery slope.
23 | George Gerbig | 10154713468186336_10154713482346336 | She also said she didn't know the emails were classified despite the C in the top corner. I tend to believe the opposite of whatever verbal vomit she spews.
24 | Michael S. Marchesano | 10154713468186336_10154713479631336 | She lies so much forget the Russians wiki leaks is doing what the media should be doing. She keeps blaming the Russians Trump needs to stay on point. Call her on the issues wiki leaks emails
25 | Shelley Carr McKeon | 10154713468186336_1597988400511027 | Hilary Clinton is a piece of garbage! Every time she opens her mouth lies just fall out. She is a disgrace and a disgusting human being.  As far as Megan Kelly, I have no respect for her, she is clearly showing us all where her  vote lies.

3 | Rodney B Wooten | 10154713063331336_10154713185691336 | Duh..he has done it for years..the only reason Hillary is with him is for her political career..what "strong" woman would put herself through this guys litany of sexual encounters unless there was an agenda..
4 | Barry Verrico | 10154713063331336_10154713188496336 | Turn FOXNews on for minute Megan's talking about sexual allegations against trump change the channel go back 10 minutes later she still freaking talking about sexual allegations against trump please FOXNews get rid of this woman unless you're paying her to say it is that possible
5 | Sallie Raymond-Mullinger | 10154713063331336_10154713200441336 | Someone needs to let Murdoch know that Megyn Kelly is not who we, the viewers, want to see on FOX. Is she a shill working for the Dems?Could not believe her just now arguing with Mike Pence about one of the bimbo allegations aimed at Trump. She actually interrupted him twice!I never see her arguing with a Dem pundit with that kind of vehemence.We wont watch her show in our home and its getting to the point where we wont watch anything else with her on it.I hate that shes involved in the debate tonight. She is anything but fair and balanced when it comes to Trump.
6 | Jay Wagner | 10154713063331336_10154713187066336 | So ? What's gonna happen to Bill, ? Nothing at all...now if it was Trump.. Whoa!!! Now that would be non stop, wall to wall trashing Trump.. And Fox is as bad as the rest of them.. U can't get fair straight just the news in this country ..
7 | Amy Woodmansee | 10154713063331336_10154713188341336 | Democrats on Bill Clinton: "That was years ago, she must be lying." Democrats on Trump: "Nope, it's true. Doesn't matter how long ago it was."
8 | Shane Dawson | 10154713063331336_10154713182426336 | If Trump wins,everyone will pay a fair and honest price for some tacos. If Hillary wins she will give away free tacos to all who vote for her & then charge all us tax payers $10 dollars a taco! It's true. I saw this in one of her deleted emails that they found on a blown up computer in Benghazi!  It's all on video!
9 | SD Buckland | 10154713063331336_10154713183841336 | So the liberal argument will be "it's a lie because she waited so long to come forward" while at the same time saying "it doesn't matter how long she waited, Trump assaulted her"
10 | George Pattron | 10154713063331336_10154713180516336 | I believe it would be easier to count the women Bill Clinton DIDN'T sexually assault.
11 | Mark Jones | 10154713063331336_10154713176561336 | Looking forward to tonight's final debate. This is what America is all about folks. Anyone with enough drive, and ambition, like Trump, can become President of the United States of America. Against every conceivable odds against him, the corrupt Obama administration, the corrupt Soros funded Clinton machine, the CORRUPT MEDIA, and even the corrupted establishment GOP, Trump will be our next POTUS because real Americans are sick and tired of democrats trying to run the show and failing on nearly every account the last 8 years. History will remember 2016 as the year Trump turned our once balanced system that was created by our founding fathers back to order once again for all. Go Trump/Pence 2016! 🇺🇸
12 | William Paddison | 10154713063331336_10154713208791336 | A former Arkansas TV reporter claimed for the first time Wednesday that former President Bill Clinton sexually assaulted her in 1980.Leslie Millwee, formerly a local news reporter at KLMN-TV, alleges that on three separate occasions, the then-Arkansas governor touched her inappropriately in a secluded editing room at the TV station.Bill Clinton is such a pig!!!!
13 | Pam McFarlen | 10154713063331336_1139450432802623 | It's obvious! Those who accuse Trump are victims and on a path to sainthood. Those who accuse Bill Clinton took advantage of him, seduced him, and according to Joy Behar are "tramps". The media also plays the double standard. I don't believe any of these women would have waited until this few days before election to speak of these assaults. Why not filing lawsuits, charges years before now?
14 | Shane Howell | 10154713063331336_10154713239231336 | I honestly walked into the middle of this report on Fox News and thought "oh crap, this one for some reason sounds and looks legit" like she is telling the truth...thinking it was another one coming out against Trump...
15 | Tim McKnight | 10154713063331336_10154713179231336 | We all know what happened to everyone else back then when they has something to say about the Clintons.... They all commited suicide.
16 | Brenen Oakley Dukeman | 10154713063331336_10154713227106336 | Of course another one was going to come forward and that assinine Meygan Kelly just keeps saying it over and over...but when Pence or aneyone else starts saying something about Trump she cuts them off.  Is she going to be running her mouth through the whole debate?  Could she llike go to her room?
17 | Betty Galloway | 10154713063331336_1623199017982118 | You know what? I'm so tired of women suddenly coming forward about something that happened to them years ago. There ought to be a statute of limitations on how long after a crime is committed that it can be reported. You know, if you are to weak or stupid to claim it when it happens you really shouldn't be whining about it 10,20,30 years later.
18 | Amy Walker Gore | 10154713063331336_1139595256121474 | when I was growing up and Bill Clinton was my governor, these rumors were very common. It was well known that he hit on women and ran around. There are tons of stories out there from former state troopers that were assigned to guard him that said he did it all the time.
19 | Lilly Stanga Rose | 10154713063331336_10154713240371336 | Please Fox News you are becoming a disappointment. Show the facts I'm intelligent enough to figure it out my self. Good Lord you're becoming a bias network . I left CNN, ABC, MSNBC, NBC for the fair and balanced network. You're opinions need to be kept to yourself
20 | Betty Sizemore | 10154713063331336_10154713206376336 | I'm shocked to the core to thank bill Clinton would do this I don't know if I can get over this but I will try to get my self together mean while Trump all the way president 2016 🇱🇷🇱🇷🎉
21 | Shandy Elliott | 10154713063331336_1623201881315165 | I see that Juan Williams is on the panel again. I don't understand what you people see in him. Is it a demographic thing? He is THE most argumentative and unreasonable person on your panels, and he is almost enough for me to turn the channel when I see him.
22 | Gwendle Burks | 10154713063331336_10154713248636336 | I'm a total Trump person, but I have to say this. AllThese women need to stop. They make the victims of sexual assault look bad. If this woman would of come forward when he was governor then ok. Now coming out of the woodwork is little off the wall. I feel the same of the ones that came after Trump. This needs to stop!
23 | Tricia Parten Richardson | 10154713063331336_10154713280976336 | Wow. Why is this such a trend now? If I ever get sexually assaulted I'm definitely going to wait 25 or 30 years before I tell anyone. You know, just in case he decides to run for president.
24 | Roger Dodson | 10154713063331336_10154713246601336 | Why  can't everyone get this through their HEADS. Bill Clinton is NOT running for President period. This lady if there is any TRUTH to her claims, has NOTHING to do with Hillary Clinton running for President. And of all days to come forth on this lie, the very day of this last debate!!
25 | Brian Mesias | 10154713063331336_1139453469468986 | She's accusing Bill Clinton!!! Liar!! Can't be true!!! The clintons would never do anything like this!!! It's only a matter of time before Hilary comes out and destroys her life now!
