Donald Trump has specifically raised concerns about people fraudulently voting using the names of dead people and cited research showing 1.8 million deceased people are still listed on state voter rolls.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Eugene Zielinski | 10154698782648675_10154698794803675 | Just because they are on the rolls doesn't mean they're going to vote. Wouldn't 1.8 million hearses pulling up to the polls look suspicious? The bigger threat is voter suppression.
2 | Stephanie Anne Sorensen-Segel | 10154698782648675_10154698801843675 | Voter fraud (individuals voting for dead relatives, double votes, etc) definitely happens, but I doubt it's enough even nationwide to make a one percent difference.Now ELECTION fraud...thousands dropped off voter rolls in NYC and other locations, closing of polling places creating hours of waiting in lines in many states, racist voter ID laws, the Nevada Democratic Convention that was a complete debacle, voting machines that switch votes and leave NO paper trail....that's the stuff that scares me.
3 | Allen Sauner | 10154698782648675_10154698823053675 | My name was removed during one election year. They claimed I'd not voted and therefore wasn't registered. That was during the first Obama election here in Montgomery County, Ohio. I voted every election prior to and had to register, unlike one other time I went to vote and was told I wasn't registered then. Then there's the dead pets and people that vote. Just sayin'
4 | Vic Glassco | 10154698782648675_10154698800073675 | How do you explain people that have been dead for 50+ years registering to vote? They weren't on previous voter registrations, they were new registrations. Yeah, that would be evidence of voter fraud.
5 | Ull Elv | 10154698782648675_10154698839358675 | My previous home owner is still registered, I told them has passed away and to take her off the list and my address for 14 yrs ,we don't get junk mail in her name but every time I go to vote there she is on the list with my address
6 | Shane Alg | 10154698782648675_10154698804178675 | If birth and death certificates were linked to a national voter registrar, his argument would be silenced. Especially with a long history of some states disenfranchising minority voters, this would be helpful to Democracy
7 | Jamie Wallhauser | 10154698782648675_10154698801803675 | Dead people? Democrats don't need 'em, we'll win anyway
8 | Patricia Maguire Murphy | 10154698782648675_10154698850228675 | My brother died last year and is one of those dead people who will be voting Nov. 8.  I sure wish I could talk to him about it.
9 | Larry St. John | 10154698782648675_10154698790573675 | I had a dream that America was covered with ashes. As I was walking our streets the ashes we're so deep that they were covering my mouth and nose and trying to cover my eyes.The most important thing about this election.The same ashes  of the concentration camps and ovens of the 1940s are falling upon the United States every single day.  Half of this beloved country is blinded by these demonic ashes and are in denial of what is going on in their cities and in our country.  Planned Parenthood, though your required contribution, provides the murder of a could be beautiful person every 97 seconds. 1 out of 8 women who walk into a Planned Parenthood "Clinic"  today will end the life of a  beautiful person.   Every 97 seconds a beating heart is stopped and a girl, or a boy, a could be artist, doctor,  musician,  teacher or someone else wonderful is murdered in one of these Federally funded  clinics that you are forced to be paying for.  Sadly this is just an example of only 34% of the abortions Nationwide today. Last year we gave 540 million dollars to Planned Parenthood and you had no say in the matter. In the 1930s the world had Hitler saying that the Jews were not true people and he was voted into power. 150 years ago in the United States we had the Democrats in  the USA saying that the black man was not a true human and could be used in slavery.  And today by law you are required to help pay for such a evil as this. This is truly why this debate is so controversial and so ugly.  It is the same evil demonic energy of the1860s and of the 1940s.  Today in 2016 as yesterday we have half of our country in deep delusional denial.  Some deceived leaders like Obama and Hillary tickle our ears, and try to numb out our conscience by telling us that "abortion is just a sad choice that women sometimes have to make".  This evil can go as far as selling the body parts of the babies that have been murdered.This is why it is so important to stop Hillary now. A vote for Hillary and her party is truly a vote for the most horrible demonic evil in the world today. Democrats clean the ashes out of your eyes, you have been blinded to the truth and you are under the influence of an evil demonic power. Those not blinded,  wipe the ashes from your mouths, pray and do not remain silent.   Dante said "the darkest places in Hell are reserved for those who remain neutral during times of moral crisis."   The lives of tens of millions and the very soul of United States of America is truly at stake. If not stopped NOW this evil of calling another human not human will spread over us in a 100 different ways.  Today Prideful Democrats scream  at Pro Life people and call us uneducated,  religious zealots,  control freaks and stupid fools, showing that they believe they are more and others are less.  Hillary yells that we are “Deplorable!” much like Hitler did to those who disagreed with him in the 1930s.   History shows that in the near future this demonic energy of pride will pull us into World War 3 just as it did into the Civil War and World Wars; where some believed and treated other human beings less then they.
10 | Rey Flores | 10154698782648675_10154698791108675 | Leave it to the pro-#CrookedHillary sycophants at PBS to re-invent what "voter fraud" means.You might as well say... "Just because there's smoke doesn't mean there's a fire."
11 | Bob Millar | 10154698782648675_10154698787503675 | No real fraud exists in the USA. Just a pathetic attempt by Republicans to take away the right to vote of Democrats. :(
12 | Amy James | 10154698782648675_10154698786343675 | The left..continually wanting to bury their head in the sand.."keep them dumb and dependent" should be Hillary's motto..
13 | Judith Herbst | 10154698782648675_10154698805163675 | You have to show an ID to vote why would anyone do this and there has been no real proof that it should be a concern.
14 | Tim Fisher | 10154698782648675_10154698855953675 | Right, because when Grandpa dies, the FIRST thing on people's minds is "I have to make sure he's removed from the voting roll."
15 | Rick Steinhausen | 10154698782648675_10154698787163675 | Hillary Deducted $1,042,000 in Charitable Contributions From Her Taxes.$1,000,000 of Those Contributions Went To the Clinton Foundation.She Cut Her Tax Bill By $1 Million By Donating To Herself. Remember That Next Time You Pay Your Taxes. Well she lost 6 billion dollars of tax payer’s money she really looks out for her money but not are money and she never will.
16 | Sonny Chapman | 10154698782648675_10154698831473675 | Typical Demagogue lie. Typical Republican hysteria of a nonexistent Boogeyman
17 | Rick Moreno | 10154698782648675_10154698811983675 | My mom passed away on September 18, 2016. I'm pretty sure she will still be on the voter rolls.
18 | Samuel Collier | 10154698782648675_10154698866263675 | He's making progress, recognizing numbers now. Soon he'll put all together and have big word's and big number's
19 | Cheryl Kreiser | 10154698782648675_10154698814723675 | After Hillary Clinton wins the election, my dream is that the press takes the high road and completely ignores trump.
20 | Richard Kiely | 10154698782648675_10154698831948675 | Just one more thing Donald doesn't know about government.
21 | Ben TI | 10154698782648675_10154698801303675 | Yeah it only equate when Democrat are behind in the polls. Biased media.
22 | Tim Brooks | 10154698782648675_10154698833158675 | If it is not fraud then why do they always vote Democrats?
23 | Lu EG | 10154698782648675_10154698868138675 | The so called "republican leaders" are a bunch of spineless cowards who are getting exactly what they deserve. The Republican Party made that orange buffoon. Now, the lunatic is destroying the party. Yes, they're a bunch of losers who have abandoned "their principles" when they supported this piece of trash. He is ripping the Republican Party apart and I would be lying if I said I am not enjoying this. The lunatic is not going to go quietly, and he is going to take every single member of the party down with him as he nosedives towards complete destruction. He is willing to take them all down and they deserve everything he can throw at them. And it would be a beautiful thing to watch, those cowards deserve it!! Your decades worth of strategy have brought your party to this, the culmination of your efforts courting the votes of racists, bigots, "Christian" fundamentalists, and other elements of the extreme right. That sexual predator is your Southern Strategy on steroids. That disgusting pig is a product of your party's decades of hate mongering, fear-mongering, and anti intellectualism. On top of all that you have spent the past eight years cultivating the narcissistic pathological liar's current base of support and that pandering to, and embrace of extremists & all that obstruction is now paying dividends you don’t want or need, but fully deserve. You fed the monster for far too long. Now he’s devouring you inside out. Your embrace of extremism delivered exactly what your base wants, now attempting to distance yourselves from your own creation is inciting a rebellion against your party. I hope that narcissistic sociopath's candidacy will have one beneficial effect on American politics, it will serve to purge the GOP of its extremist elements, that's of course assuming there are enough true conservatives out there. Although that is highly unlikely, one can hope the #NeverTrump conservatives who maintain that their decision to never vote for the racist, bigoted, misogynistic, sexual predator is guided by their principles will be strong enough to purge the GOP of its extremist and form a true Conservative party. America should have more than two major political parties, I hope this election cycle will deliver that. One thing is for sure, the Republican Party can NEVER ever again say they place this country over their party, they can never claim the moral high ground, or personal responsibility. After decades of Republicans claiming to be patriotic and wrapping themselves in the flag, now they are wrapping themselves in Putin's Puppet. If these so called "leaders" can't stand up to this weak, ignorant, useless coward, they will never have the strength to take on ISIS or any other enemy of this great country. The Party of Lincoln died the day the republicans let this dangerous demagogue take over their party. My fellow democrats/progressives, it is time to send a loud and clear message to republicans and the world. Let's go out and vote blue up and down the ballot in record numbers to make congress work again. To stop the crazy gridlock and dysfunction on Capitol Hill. We can do it, we have the power. Let's keep the White House. Let's prove Ryan correct and take back the Senate & hand Senator Bernie Sanders a key role in congress. Let's NOT stop there, let's take away the spineless coward Speaker Ryan’s gavel and take the House back as well. I know House’s electoral map been deeply gerrymandered but I believe we can make it happen. Get your friends, families and neighbors to vote. Come on, we got this!! Just like president Obama, I am fired up and ready to go. Are you?And Please, please do not be intimidated to vote.  If there is a problem, report it immediately!! And please don't let all these negativity discourage you from getting out to vote!
24 | Kia Thomas | 10154698782648675_10154698784558675 | I voted today--TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT, AGAIN!. I'm black and proud, I'll say it real loud--I'M NOT WITH HER.
25 | Richard Esslinger | 10154698782648675_10154698790838675 | one women voted for her dead husband for 10 years but thats just one that got caught

Overall, Clinton leads Trump among young likely voters 60 percent to 19 percent, with 12 percent supporting Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson and 6 percent behind the Green Party’s Jill Stein.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Jessica Chronister | 10154698705303675_10154698810278675 | We need a none of the above option everywhere, not just Nevada. I know that many people can't truly support Gary Johnson or Jill Stein. I do understand trying to get money and name recognition for other parties though. The dual system we have now is a nightmare.
2 | Jeffrey Lowe | 10154698705303675_10154698803093675 | My generation is so obsessed with trivial "PC" topics and emotionally driven to vote. The majority will fall for any politician that verbally condemns "big corporations", "wall street", or "the man". For the most connected, educated, and involved generation in American history, the ignorance of most is disappointing.
3 | John Koskela | 10154698705303675_10154698798658675 | Most Killary detractors are under educated and under experienced. They do not try very hard to develop what they could offer. They take everything she has to say as lies without verifying any factual information, readily at hand.
4 | John Schroeder | 10154698705303675_10154698782568675 | Most killary supporters are over educated and under experienced. Expect too much for what they have to offer. They take everything she has to say as solid truth without verifying her credibility.
5 | Betsy Kline | 10154698705303675_10154698826848675 | Don't believe the polls. One of the latest Podesta emails, released by WikiLeaks, lays out in explicit detail, exactly how to “manufacture” the desired results from a given poll.  P.s. I am not a Trump supporter or Russian lol,  I'm just sharing to help get the truth out there since corporate media isn't willing.wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/26551

14 | Virginia Perez | 10154698705303675_10154698712703675 | If you're like me, the sight and sound of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump make you want to vomit. There is a solution, it's called working the electoral college against them both. It's going to take guts. Here is how, if you live in a state that does not require write in registration (Vermont, Wyoming, Oregon, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Iowa, Delaware, and Alabama) you write in Bernie. This will remove those states from the electoral map which makes it easier for a third party candidate to win enough electoral votes with the other states. Everyone else, if your state is mostly blue, vote Jill Stein. If your state is mostly red, vote Gary Johnson. This should swing the majority vote to the third party candidate in most cases. Neither Jill Stein or Gary Johnson are perfect candidates, but Clinton and Trump sure as heck aren't either. But Stein and Johnson are less likely to kill us or get us killed. Bernie would get a total of 49 electoral votes, if people did this it would kick it right over to the House who would choose from the top three. Trump and Clinton would not be president. Trump and Clinton are political poison to US House Reps who are up for election every two years. Beyond that, there is no guarantee Trump and Clinton will both be in the top three if people follow through with this, could be Bernie, Stein and Johnson. Like I said it's going to take guts but if we don't try we're weak and we will end up with Trump or Clinton anyway. The Founding Fathers gave us an out for a reason and this is it.
15 | Roy Kizzia | 10154698705303675_10154698810643675 | Unless you are an uneducated white man working in a non-union job, Trump should not even pop up on your radar.
16 | Richard Gougeon | 10154698705303675_10154698722673675 | Hillary Clinton attempted to smear Trump for lewd “locker room talk” despite the Clintons’ own sorry history when it comes to her own husband Bill Clinton.Gennifer Flowers, who has claimed that she and former President Bill Clinton carried on a 12 year affair, spoke about the locker room talk Bill Clinton engaged in with her and others. Flowers said “So, you know sometimes we had phone sex,” and “We were engaged in a lot of locker room talk. And he did with his friends and his associates like Roger Perry”. And now, that same woman is telling the world how she is so offended by Trump behavior but, on the other hands, she endured her own husband doing the same thing for years. Isn’t it strange the way Hillary Clinton thinks! Is it really someone who can be trusted to run this country?Why are all those women not denounced the same behavior from Hillary Clinton' husband? Bill Clinton who did it for years while Hillary Clinton endured it without saying a word.

3 | Sj Lag | 10154698597398675_10154698686523675 | InI think the polls are probably heavily weighed for Hillary over sampling democrats, which is sad because that maneuver hurts democracy . Once again I can not trust the facts as given unless I do my own analysis of the sampling formula????? Is there any Truth Telling left?  Just put out an honest poll equal participation between all the parties running including all third parties. I've probably lost my mind at this point wanting anything Honest in an election year but please if you quote a poll give the sampling make-up. So we can gauge its accuracy.

Hundreds of women dressed as 'Catrina' participated in an annual parade in Mexico City over the weekend. Catrina was created as a criticism of women who pretended to be of a higher class, even if it meant starving. #DayoftheDead #DiaDeMuertos
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Annette Espinoza | 10154698525918675_10154698621253675 | Halloween to me has always been dark and scary. Dia de los Muertos is a celebration of the lives we knew and loved. I've embraced the latter.
2 | Patricia Robinson | 10154698525918675_10154698595203675 | No! We need to celebrate the Day of the Dead too. The origins of these wonderful holidays, however, are getting lost in commercialism just like Christmas.
3 | Mitzi Linn | 10154698525918675_10154698624043675 | In Oaxaca they celebrate the Day of the Dead and incorporate comparsas of disguised people the days before Muertos....The Day of the Dead is NOV 1 and 2 after Halloween...Oaxaca is indigenous and in the pueblos it is a holiday that celebrates the ancestors, recent and remote, and the harvests....It is spreading to the US...We have celebrations here in Oregon...
4 | Roger Komula | 10154698525918675_10154698612838675 | Those WHITE faces are terrifying. Does an ORANGE face lead them? They should build a wall to keep them out and make Orangeface pay for it.

8 | Traci Ramirez | 10154698525918675_10154698635133675 | I would rather adopt this and celebrate and remember my lost relatives than a meaningless holiday to collect candy

10 | William Schinsky | 10154698525918675_10154698682438675 | Amazing how this day has grown.  Coming from a Los Angeles founding Mexican family, we never celebrated the day.  It is now a Mexican tradition used by Americans as another excuse to party and make some easy money.

Life is about to change in one of these cities, where fans have waited decades for a baseball championship.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Thomas Gorman | 10154696952043675_10154698723193675 | Both teams play with so much heart and have such stories, I think it will be epic. I'm rooting for the Cubs, but either way I expect it to be a great series. Happy that the Cubs are playing such a storied franchise too-- it would take some of the sting out of defeat if the Cubs lost. But for now, GO CUBS! :D
2 | Karen Paradiso | 10154696952043675_10154698510738675 | I remember when it was us (Red Sox) fans getting this excited after 86 years of waiting for the next World Series win!
3 | Jodi Houle | 10154696952043675_10154698496108675 | Decades...cute. We've been waiting over a full century. Go Cubs Go!
4 | Robert L West | 10154696952043675_10154698443933675 | Prepare now for your cities to be destroyed by fans; whether they win or lose.
5 | Rick Moreno | 10154696952043675_10154698403083675 | The baseball playoffs were rigged.
6 | Jared Mathew | 10154696952043675_10154698430273675 | Roll Tribe, roll!

Had enough of debates, ads, speeches? A new book argues that “the crisis in our politics is a crisis of political language.”
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | William H Boley | 10154696950463675_10154698111113675 | It's not a question of language, but of a lack of a sense of the common good and values and a civility when there are disagreements. We are so polarized, and personalize every discussion, almost immediately resorting to blaming and name-calling, as in a bad relationship where communication has broken down.
2 | Adam Tarver | 10154696950463675_10154698210048675 | I am fine with debates, ads and speeches.. What annoys me is far partisan leaning propaganda pages that people like to run to while they complain about the "MSM"
3 | Bryan Evans | 10154696950463675_10154698597578675 | This election has more in common with professional wrestling than politics.  If you really haven't figured that out you kind of suck at journalism.
4 | Bruce Terry | 10154696950463675_10154698099663675 | A BBC radio program on the origins of "gaslighting" - manipulating someone into questioning the truth to the point of their losing a sense of reality.  Trump has been accused of it frequently. http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04cqgcd
5 | Ric Brown | 10154696950463675_10154698126108675 | This kind of explains why Drumpf does so well among mouth breathers.
6 | Jeannie Marshall | 10154696950463675_10154698454883675 | Remember we were promised lower and better healthcare? http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-10-24/obama-administration-confirms-obamacare-premiums-will-surge-25-2017
7 | Max M. Haiflich | 10154696950463675_10154698289688675 | The problem with the language is 50 years of Republicans redefining words to hide their agenda.
8 | Jimmy Hustead | 10154696950463675_10154698126908675 | November 8th can't come soon enough... Make it blue, straight down ticket! 🇺🇸
9 | Darshan Dhesi | 10154696950463675_10154698424478675 | Nothing wrong with debates but media like CNN truly sound like the Clinton Network News
10 | Peter Hobbs Di Grazia | 10154696950463675_10154698588043675 | No candidate who wanted to win would be trying so hard to lose. http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/cover_story/2016/07/donald_trump_is_unfit_to_be_president_here_are_141_reasons_why.html
11 | Michelle Erwin | 10154696950463675_10154698277763675 | What did you expect from these two major candidates with so many muddy scandals. Mud slinging is all they can do.
12 | Jay Smith | 10154696950463675_10154698218358675 | 
13 | Susan Home | 10154696950463675_10154698110948675 | Leader, official, authority, lawmaker.  Or public servant, paid employee, hired hand.  Funny how the public has become the order followers instead of the order givers, completely forgetting that all this charade is, is hiring someone to do a job.  For if we remembered that we are the bosses, we might actually discipline our employees for breaking the law and committing war crimes, instead of coronating them and worshipping them on bended knee.  And funding slaughter for pipelines.
14 | George F Franks III | 10154696950463675_10154698090008675 | How can he have time to write a book?

16 | Sarah Merrie Perrigo Adams | 10154696950463675_10154698618153675 | was gonna vote for hillary but i really cant do that
17 | Lynn Kennedy | 10154696950463675_10154698457298675 | I feel sad that people are not inspired by great speechs.  I want my leaders to show intelligence, poise, and manners.  Trump's poor grammar and low grade level of speech drove me crazy.  If our leaders cant speak, and people like that, what is wrong with our education system?  And what is wrong with people that trust wikileaks over long time, historically respected news sources?

20 | Patricia N Anthony Rye | 10154696950463675_10154698381363675 | So according to the POLLS the election is all sewn up...Tell us, were the poll numbers added up the same way as before?. The ones where NBC, ABC, CBS, FOX, AND CNN, ADMITTEDLY LEFT OUT 5 DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS??..Their excuse then was that ..quote" INDEPENDENTS, ACTIVE MILITARY, BLACKS, HISPANICS, AND 18 TO 45 YR OLD DON'T VOTE!!" ...REALLY??..SMH.... PEOPLE, WE ARE NOT STUCK WITH JUST 2 CHOICES NO MATTER WHAT THE POLLS SAY.. NO MATTER IF YOU LIVE IN A SUPPOSED SWING STATE OR NOT....NOV 8TH VOTE YOUR CONSCIENCE!!! ...WHY?.... Here it is in a nut shell people... Each party, THE LIBERTARIAN, GREEN, D AND R, have to elect a set number of delegates PER STATE THAT THAT STATE REQUIRES.. NOW come election day, what ever the popular vote is in each state, ONLY THE WINNING PARTIES DELEGATES ARE ALLOWED TO VOTE.. {though we all know how interchangeable those D and R delegates are.. cheeky little fellows that they are} ... Those other electoral delegates all go home and they no longer get a say... SO IF YOU'RE UNDECIDED OR ARE SICK AND TIRED OF THE D AND R BS, AND THE LIES OF THE MSM, LOOK AT GARY JOHNSON... 2 TERM GOVERNOR, SELF MADE MILLIONAIRE FISCALLY CONSERVATIVE, SOCIALLY INCLUSIVE...NOT NOW NOR EVER BEEN INVESTIGATED FOR WRONG DOING!!.... https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost/videos/10154299291402293/
21 | Dennis Stokes | 10154696950463675_10154698136203675 | 1998 - President Clinton had an illicit relationship with Monica Lewinsky, whose friend, Linda Trip, convinced her to keep a stained dress as protection to keep her from being added to the Clinton body count list, a collection of names circulating the Internet of deceased former Clinton associates.Attempting to cover up the affair, Clinton was impeached for perjury and obstruction of justice.  Cover ups and I don’t recall are the Clinton way. 2009 - President Obama's Attorney General Eric Holder was held in Contempt of Congress after refusing to release documents regarding a Fast and Furious operation which provided guns to Mexican drug gangs. 2012 - Prior to re-election, President Obama announced the war on terror was over. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton met with the 57 leaders of the OIC (Organization of Islamic Cooperation) promising support of a U.N. Resolution prohibiting speech insulting Islam. But insulting American Christians for Hillary and this administration is OK. On Septembr 11, an attack occurred on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya. Six hours into the attack, the President spoke via telephone with Secretary Clinton but no rescue was attempted. The next morning, Secretary Clinton's State Department sent memos to YouTube and Google recommending they censor speech insulting Islam. We know this was a cover up.When it was discovered that the U.S. Ambassador in Benghazi had been denied repeated requests for increased security by the State Department and that the attacks were planned and not a result of a video, Secretary Clinton responded "What difference does it make." Reports and emails surfaced that U.S. arms covertly used to oust Libya's President Gaddafi were being moved through Benghazi, similar to the "Fast and Furious" scandal, to arm fundamentalist Muslims to oust Syria's President Assad. When Russia came to Assad's defense, the Muslims armed by the U.S. attacked into Syria and Iraq, calling themselves ISIS. 2013 - after the President had met 157 times with the head of the IRS, Lois Lerner, she pleaded the 5th Amendment when asked by Congress about whether the agency targeted conservative political groups prior to the President's re-election.  We now know Lerner did do this and nothing was ever done.
22 | Rd Dan | 10154696950463675_10154698099153675 | MILLIONS OF MUSLIMS ARE COMING - OBAMA HILLARY CLINTONTheft is punishable by amputation of the right hand (above).• Criticizing or denying any part of the Quran is punishable by death.• Criticizing Muhammad or denying that he is a prophet is punishable by death.• Criticizing or denying Allah, the god of Islam is punishable by death.• A Muslim who becomes a non-Muslim is punishable by death.• A non-Muslim who leads a Muslim away from Islam is punishable by death.• A non-Muslim man who marries a Muslim woman is punishable by death.• A man can marry an infant girl and consummate the marriage when she is 9 years old.• Girls' clitoris should be cut (Muhammad's words, Book 41, Kitab Al-Adab, Hadith 5251).• A woman can have 1 husband, who can have up to 4 wives; Muhammad can have more.• A man can beat his wife for insubordination.• A man can unilaterally divorce his wife; a woman needs her husband's consent to divorce.• A divorced wife loses custody of all children over 6 years of age or when they exceed it.• Testimonies of four male witnesses are required to prove rape against a woman.• A woman who has been raped cannot testify in court against her rapist(s).• A woman's testimony in court, allowed in property cases, carries ½ the weight of a man's.• A female heir inherits half of what a male heir inherits.• A woman cannot drive a car, as it leads to fitnah (upheaval).• A woman cannot speak alone to a man who is not her husband or relative.• Meat to eat must come from animals that have been sacrificed to Allah - i.e., be "Halal".• Muslims should engage in Taqiyya and lie to non-Muslims to advance Islam.

2 | Trev Youngstrom | 10154696941278675_10154698591938675 | For the trillions the war has cost America could likely import the entire population of Syria and build them a house. Somehow I get the feeling it's not about the money.

The pipeline is currently about 60 percent built. What will be the fate of the Standing Rock protests?
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Lisa Richards Sovde | 10154696938383675_10154698087188675 | The oil companies will end up killing us one way or another. Either by polluting our water sources or earthquake. In reality the Native Americans are standing up for all of us.
2 | Ransom Lee O'Shields | 10154696938383675_10154697391033675 | Nothing will happen, the pipeline isn't going to stop, it will be built. The tribe and people that are protesting will complain and resort to eco-terrorism. The pipeline will be fixed and the combined usage and companies accessing the site or sites will hire security. This will happen again and again over the country. Unfortunately, no judgment is going to be handed down, because billions of dollars are spent to ensure crude will reach its destination. This is the world we live in. Resources over the cost of anything else, it has been that way since the US was founded, since we first expanded across this nation. People protest, Natives die, but the machine marches forward.
3 | Rob Denholm | 10154696938383675_10154697582613675 | Cash grab by protesters, pure and simple. They'll continue until they are paid or it gets too cold to protest. Then they'll drive their gas burning vehicles back to their homes, heated by the energy that the pipelines carry, just like all Eco-Clowns.
4 | Ray Cottengaim | 10154696938383675_10154698285698675 | I am just waiting for this thing to pop a leak and discharge thousands of gallons of toxic crude. That will be the end of the pipeline.
5 | Sj Lag | 10154696938383675_10154698606718675 | Hopefully the pipeline will be moved to a less sensitive ecological place like Bismarck where it was originally planned to go but the White Politicians sent the line to run beside the Standing Rock Reservation. All the White People can't figure what all the fuss is about....
6 | Jacob Jarzabek | 10154696938383675_10154698526713675 | Go back to work...or rather, go back to half-assing looking for work so as to maintain minimum standards for unemployment benefits.
7 | Johnny Popp | 10154696938383675_10154697361143675 | It is my fondest wish and hope that the Native Americans succeed in stopping this and all the other oil pipelines from crossing anywhere in America!
8 | Brian C Laverenz | 10154696938383675_10154697394763675 | NOTHING.... When -40 Degrees with -65 Degree WIND CHILL arrives....These Native Indians are going to run for their houses....!!!.... END OF STORY....

13 | Daryl Jones | 10154696938383675_10154697558293675 | With most of the pipeline construction completed and in short amount of time the only part that needed to complete the pipeline is this section, it will become fait accompli.

"The undocumented community that can’t vote are the ones that have been leading these efforts and saying that, even though I can’t vote, you can be my voice and you can be my vote."
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Renzo Palma | 10154696874463675_10154697353823675 | Donald Trump started his campaign with a racist serenade that enchanted an already xenophobic base. He exploited a white biased american exceptionalism nurtured by decades of demonizing propaganda. Trump seeks to profit from the criminalization of the undocumented. Should he become this country's first tyrant, he’ll stiff the government with the bill of this absurd wall of his and the construction and maintenance of more privatized prisons and detention/deportation centers. He wants to enforce a minimum of two or more years of incarceration of “illegalized” individuals, before ultimately deporting them. He’s banking on the surge of privatization, and once again, will profit at the expense of the tax payer. He is a ruthless opportunist and a vengeful, racist, despot. Trump is an abuser that would have no qualms of violating a woman; no qualms of violating business contracts; no qualms of violating human rights. And now even dares to violate our democracy. We must all be conscious of our severe civic ignorance. And anyone supporting such a menace is simply dangerously naive and morally dysfunctional.
2 | Brian Griffin | 10154696874463675_10154697478898675 | Ilegal have only one agenda and that is exploiting the American political system for their benefit. They have corrupted American politics.
3 | Larry St. John | 10154696874463675_10154697582558675 | I had a dream that America was covered with ashes. As I was walking our streets the ashes we're so deep that they were covering my mouth and nose and trying to cover my eyes.The most important thing about this election.The same ashes  of the concentration camps and ovens of the 1940s are falling upon the United States every single day.  Half of this beloved country is blinded by these demonic ashes and are in denial of what is going on in their cities and in our country.  Planned Parenthood, though your required contribution, provides the murder of a could be beautiful person every 97 seconds. 1 out of 8 women who walk into a Planned Parenthood "Clinic"  today will end the life of a  beautiful person.   Every 97 seconds a beating heart is stopped and a girl, or a boy, a could be artist, doctor,  musician,  teacher or someone else wonderful is murdered in one of these Federally funded  clinics that you are forced to be paying for.  Sadly this is just an example of only 34% of the abortions Nationwide today. Last year we gave 540 million dollars to Planned Parenthood and you had no say in the matter. In the 1930s the world had Hitler saying that the Jews were not true people and he was voted into power. 150 years ago in the United States we had the Democrats in  the USA saying that the black man was not a true human and could be used in slavery.  And today by law you are required to help pay for such a evil as this. This is truly why this debate is so controversial and so ugly.  It is the same evil demonic energy of the1860s and of the 1940s.  Today in 2016 as yesterday we have half of our country in deep delusional denial.  Some deceived leaders like Obama and Hillary tickle our ears, and try to numb out our conscience by telling us that "abortion is just a sad choice that women sometimes have to make".  This evil can go as far as selling the body parts of the babies that have been murdered.This is why it is so important to stop Hillary now. A vote for Hillary and her party is truly a vote for the most horrible demonic evil in the world today. Democrats clean the ashes out of your eyes you have been blinded to the truth and you are under the influence of an evil demonic power. Those not blinded,  wipe the ashes from your mouths, pray and do not remain silent.   Dante said "the darkest places in Hell are reserved for those who remain neutral during times of moral crisis."   The lives of tens of millions and the very soul of United States of America is truly at stake. If not stopped NOW this evil of calling another human not human will spread over us in a 100 different ways.  Today Democrats scream at Pro Life people and call us uneducated,  religious zealots,  control freaks and stupid fools, showing that they believe they are more and others are less.  Hillary yells that we are “Deplorable!” much like Hitler did to those who disagreed with him in the 1930s.   History shows that in the near future this demonic energy will pull us into World War 3 just as it did into the Civil War and World Wars; where some believed and treated other human beings less then they.

I have to do what I can to keep Mr. Trump from public office because we must keep the supeme court progressive, he has a plan to dismantle free speech, he denounced NATO, and he has a lot of fans.
2 | Lynn Hughes | 10154696855833675_10154697217848675 | Don't get played.http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-10-23/new-podesta-email-exposes-dem-playbook-rigging-polls-through-oversamples"The email even includes a handy, 37-page guide with the following poll-rigging recommendations. In Arizona, over sampling of Hispanics and Native Americans is highly recommended:Research, microtargeting & polling projects- Over-sample Hispanics- Use Spanish language interviewing. (Monolingual Spanish-speaking voters are among the lowest turnout Democratic targets)- Over-sample the Native American populationFor Florida, the report recommends "consistently monitoring" samples to makes sure they're "not too old" and "has enough African American and Hispanic voters." Meanwhile, "independent" voters in Tampa and Orlando are apparently more dem friendly so the report suggests filling up independent quotas in those cities first.- Consistently monitor the sample to ensure it is not too old, and that it has enough African American and Hispanic voters to reflect the state.- On Independents: Tampa and Orlando are better persuasion targets than north or south Florida (check your polls before concluding this). If there are budget questions or oversamples, make sure that Tampa and Orlando are included first.Meanwhile, it's suggested that national polls over sample "key districts / regions" and "ethnic" groups "as needed."- General election benchmark, 800 sample, with potential over samples in key districts/regions- Benchmark polling in targeted races, with ethnic over samples as needed- Targeting tracking polls in key races, with ethnic over samples as needed."
3 | Robert Rankin | 10154696855833675_10154696994603675 | James O'Keefe, found out that Hillary Clinton, herself, wanted people to dress up like ducks to incite violence at Trump rallies. Hillary Clinton is a weird and twisted person. A vote for her is a clear vote for corruption.

6 | Tamara Weaver | 10154696855833675_10154698488948675 | David Leonhart wrote this: "You are a Republican.You believe President Obama has been a disappointment if not a failure. You think Hillary Clinton is wrong on most issues, and you worry about her judgment.You are agonizing about what to do this year, and I understand why. Donald Trump is clearly distasteful. Yet he at least seems likely to appoint conservative judges and sign Republican bills. So what are you supposed to do?Allow me to tell you about my grandparents.They grew up as middle-class children of the Depression in Philadelphia. My grandmother was a star athlete who went on to raise a tightly knit family filled with laughter. My outgoing grandfather first sold pens door to door and later sold ads for The Saturday Evening Post and Business Week.My grandparents believed in American business, and they were small-c conservative. They voted Republican, year after year.Until 1964.That year, Barry Goldwater won the nomination from the far right. Most alarming to many people, he mused about using nuclear weapons in the Cold War.Befitting their generation’s reserve, my grandparents didn’t talk much politics. They simply said they had considered Goldwater beyond the pale. But years ago, I stumbled on a four-minute television ad that Lyndon Johnson’s campaign had run against Goldwater, and I felt as if I were listening to my grandparents.Called “Confessions of a Republican,” the ad shows a man wearing a suit and glasses (who eventually lights a cigarette) in a chair. He is a Republican, he says, like his father and grandfather. “But when we come to Senator Goldwater, now it seems to me we’re up against a very different kind of a man,” says the actor, himself an anti-Goldwater Republican. “This man scares me.”For Republicans today, Trump is scarier than Goldwater. He is scarier because he resembles a double agent dreamed up by liberal screenwriters. He embodies almost every left-wing caricature of Republicans that Republicans despise.He is a racist and a sexist — having refused to rent apartments to African-Americans, retweeted neo-Nazis, besmirched Muslims and Latinos and boastfully molested women. For years, Republicans have been frustrated by liberal sensitivity on race and gender. Comes now Trump, spewing bigotry.He is also an unrepentant denier of reality. Do you remember that Al Franken wrote a jeremiad against conservatives called “Lies: And the Lying Liars Who Tell Them”? I imagine the book’s title offends you. Yet it now feels like a preview of a candidate who almost every day makes immediately disprovable claims.Trump likewise plays into the liberal narrative that the radical right verges on being anti-American. He has suggested our democracy is illegitimate and advocated jail for his opponent.Finally, Trump displays a proud meanspiritedness about others’ struggles — a meanspiritedness that Democrats have long tried to link to Republican economic policy. He mocks parents who have lost a child, people with disabilities and prisoners of war. He relishes firing people.Trump is so distinct that he has made this election unavoidably about him. If you vote for him, you can’t pass it off as voting for Supreme Court nominees. You will be voting for Donald Trump. You will be embracing those parodies of conservatism.You do not need to do that.It’s true that you have no great options, which is why polls still show many undecided voters. Gary Johnson, initially intriguing, has proved unqualified. You could stay home or write in a vote, but those protests often feel weak.The best path is the hardest one. Only an unambiguous rejection of Trump will banish Trumpism for 2020 and beyond. Only a lopsided loss, with millions of Republicans so repelled by him that they vote for someone they never imagined they would, sends the message that bigotry, lying and authoritarianism violate Republican values — your values.I don’t take lightly how hard it is for you to consider a vote for Hillary Clinton. I’m sure that George H.W. Bush, who’s signaled he is voting for her, will do so out of duty, not joy. The same applies to many Republican military figures and conservative newspapers. Any other choice, as the former Reagan aide Ken Adelman says, is at least “a half vote for Trump.”At the end of the 1964 ad, the man says: “I’ve thought about just not voting in this election, just staying home. But you can’t do that, because that’s saying you don’t care who wins, and I do care.”That same year, my grandparents endured rare arguments with some close friends. Their friends viewed it as a betrayal to vote for a Democrat. My grandparents viewed it as a betrayal to take lightly a man unfit for the Oval Office. And they never again voted for a Democrat for president. They were Republicans.This year, the most important statement that any Republican can make is clear: I am not Trump.You can join me on Twitter (@DLeonhardt) and Facebook. I am also writing a daily email newsletter until the election and invite you to subscribe.Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTOpinion)."

Today Democrats scream at Pro Life people and call us uneducated,  religious zealots,  control freaks and stupid fools, showing that they believe they are more and others are less.  Hillary yells that we are “Deplorable!” much like Hitler did to those who disagreed with him in the 1930s.   History shows that in the near future this demonic energy will pull us into World War 3 just as it did into the Civil War and World Wars; where some believed and treated other human beings less then they.

A friend of mine went to vote at the Galleria Mall and the machine automatically changed all of her votes from Trump to Clinton and Republican to Democrat. She asked a worker to void it and to start over so she's not sure if her vote went through or not. She called Channel 13 news station to report this and they told her this has been happening all over Las Vegas to where the voting machines are flipping the Republican votes to Democrat votes!  Dirty crap !
14 | Steven Wiley | 10154696855833675_10154697078748675 | As U.S. senator for New York and secretary of state, Hillary Rodham Clinton has reliably promoted the Council of Foreign Relations agenda: the UN’s Small Arms Treaty, the UN’s Convention on the Rights of the Child, the UN’s Law of the Sea Treaty, the UN’s population control and sexual perversion agenda, the World Trade Organization, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, and much more. She has also pushed many of these same (and related) programs through the Bill and Hillary Clinton Foundation, while also enriching herself under the guise of philanthropy. What is the Council of Foreign Relations? Basically they are the propagandist for globalism. Admiral Ward, a former judge advocate general of the U.S. Navy described them and their process writing in 1977 on the powerful control the private and secretive CFR exercises over official U.S. policy, he noted:; Once the ruling members of CFR have decided that the U.S. Government should adopt a particular policy, the very substantial research facilities of CFR are put to work to develop arguments, intellectual and emotional, to support the new policy, and to confound and discredit, intellectually and politically, any opposition. The most articulate theoreticians and ideologists prepare related articles, aided by the research, to sell the new policy and to make it appear inevitable and irresistible. By following the evolution of this propaganda in the most prestigious scholarly journal in the world, Foreign Affairs, anyone can determine years in advance what the future defence and foreign policies of the United States will be. If a certain proposition is repeated often enough in that journal, then the U.S. Administration in power — be it Republican or Democratic — begins to act as if that proposition or assumption were an established fact. According to Ward, the goal of the CFR is the “submergence of U.S. sovereignty and national independence into an all-powerful one-world government.” He charged that “this lust to surrender the sovereignty and independence of the United States is pervasive throughout most of the membership.” The CFR elite and their allied globalists in the RIIA, the Trilateral Commission, the Bilderberg Group, the Brookings Institution , the Aspen Institute, the Ford Foundation, and other internationalist centres, have for decades referred to their world government plans as the New World Order. The roadblock of national sovereignty, and specifically the U.S. Constitution with its structural checks and balances, is standing in the way of this grand scheme. This is why, Admiral Ward noted, “In the entire CFR lexicon, there is no term of revulsion carrying a meaning so deep as ‘America First.’”

21 | Dan Woods | 10154696855833675_10154697454318675 | Donald Trump deserves to be in prison, not the White House. He's definitely the most corrupt, crooked, and crazy presidential candidate we've seen in decades, if not centuries. I wonder if Trump will ask Hillary Clinton for a pardon, once she is elected President of the United States? Let’s review Trump's top twelve offenses in his criminal record:First, Trump has admitted on tape to committing sexual assault against women by groping and kissing them without their consent. Indeed, at least eleven different women have formally accused him of sexual assault in the past few weeks. These accusations are very credible, and several of Trump's accusers have witnesses corroborating their stories.This should come as no surprise, given the fact that Trump was accused of rape by his former wife (Ivana Trump) years ago, and has also been accused of sexual harassment by numerous former employees and beauty queens. He’s also scheduled to be in court this coming December for the alleged rape of a 13-year old child.Second, Trump is currently the defendant in a major federal lawsuit alleging massive fraud at Trump University. He is accused of bilking students out of $40 billion. In some cases, he has has allegedly stolen the entire life savings of elderly students.Third, Trump is being sued for his fraudulent real-estate seminar program, known as Trump Institute. That same institute clearly used plagiarized textbooks and materials.Fourth, the Trump Foundation has been fined thousands of dollars by the IRS for making an illegal contribution of $25,000 to the Florida Attorney General’s campaign. That same Attorney General decided not to prosecute Trump University for fraud soon after receiving this illegal contribution; thus raising the specter of a political bribe.Fifth, Trump was sued by the Department of Justice for race-based housing discrimination at 39 sites around New York City. Trump engaged in tenant intimidation designed to force minority families from their apartments in New York City, so that he could develop the property for his own financial gain. Trump was also fined $200,000 for race discrimination occurring at Trump Plaza.Sixth, Trump hired hundreds of undocumented Polish construction workers to build Trump Tower, and was cited by federal officials for this offense. A federal judge later found Trump and other defendants guilty of conspiring to avoid paying union pensions and welfare contributions for the workers.Seventh, Trump has been repeatedly fined for violating laws and regulations related to the operation of his casinos. He has accumulated hundreds of thousands of dollars in such fines. Trump also defrauded the people of Atlantic City regarding promises made about his failed casino.Eighth, the Federal Trade Commission fined Trump $750,000 for violating anti-trust laws (he failed to disclose his stock purchases in the two different companies, which exceeded the minimum levels of disclosure).Ninth, Trump has been sued in court numerous times due to the fact that he often refuses to pay his contractors, dishwashers, plumbers, servers, housekeepers, etc., who have worked on his projects. Put simply, Trump steals from his own employees to enrich himself.Tenth, Trump has refused to release any of his tax returns and is allegedly hiding something illegal or unethical. His tax returns have been repeatedly audited, possibly due to his long-standing, documented ties to the mob in his business dealings in New York, as well as ties to dictators and criminals around the world.Eleventh, Trump's company reportedly violated U.S. law by doing business in Cuba during the boycott. Trump's company spent over $68,000 on a trip to Cuba in the late 1990s, but did not obtain the necessary US treasury license to spend money in Cuba. Twelfth, Trump has directly encouraged the Russian government to commit cyber-espionage (hacking of government and party email accounts) in the United States. Trump has abetted the Russian government in their illegal attempt to influence the U.S. presidential election. Such foreign intervention in the American political process is worse than Watergate. It is very important that we inform the American people about the real Donald Trump - a man who has already been found guilty of numerous crimes and also stands accused of countless other crimes. Trump is not only a violent sexual predator, but also a scam artist, con man, and greedy white-collar criminal of the worse kind. We need to spread the word about Trump before Election Day, for the sake of our country and the world.

“What I worry about is, when problems are not addressed and the people do not know who is responsible … some one person will come forward and say, ‘Give me total power and I will solve this problem,’” Justice Souter said in 2012.

1 | Michele A Wilcox | 10154696712668675_10154696917813675 | I use to wonder how a whole country allowed Hitler come to power. Then I see Trump supporters and it makes sense.
2 | Tyson France | 10154696712668675_10154696943153675 | Thing is, it's easy to find out who's responsible. We live in an age where information is available at our fingertips instantaneously, but people are either gullible, lazy, or both and they end up believing whatever Breitbart article their sister-in-law forwarded to them.
3 | Tamara Weaver | 10154696712668675_10154697061013675 | What an amazing time we would be in if the Republicans, in charge, would have said - we are going to work with this Democratic President to do what we say we want to do - like repair bridges and highways.
4 | Karen Kerr | 10154696712668675_10154697060543675 | Cult leaders have preached and tv evangelists have appealed for followers in much the same degree, dictators and fascist leaders have that common d(e)nominator
5 | Dennis G. McAuliffe | 10154696712668675_10154697011918675 | studies of psychological profiles of individual voters characterized by a desire for order and a fear of outsiders,  people who score high in authoritarianism, when they feel threatened, look for strong leaders who promise to take whatever action necessary to protect them from outsiders and prevent the changes they fear.A polling of a large sample of likely voters, looking for correlations between support for Trump and views that align with authoritarianism found that not onlyauthoritarianism correlated, but it predict support for Trump more reliably than virtually any other indicator.Authoritarians are thought to express much deeper fears than the rest of the electorate, to seek the imposition of order where they perceive dangerous change, and to desire a strong leader who will defeat those fears with force. They would thus seek a candidate who promised these things. And the extreme nature of authoritarians' fears, and of their desire to challenge threats with force, would lead them toward a candidate whose temperament was totally unlike anything we usually see in American politics — and whose policies went far beyond the acceptable norms.

7 | Deborah L. Lewis | 10154696712668675_10154697038323675 | That may be the most prophetic passage from that event...But it's wasn't the most crucial take-away...

8 | Chris Martens | 10154696712668675_10154697214288675 | I don't follow the logic. Trump is not asking for total power. Why is electing Trump the death of democracy? Makes as much sense as Michael Moore calling everyone who votes for Trump a terrorist. The far left is unhinged.
9 | Harry Childers | 10154696712668675_10154698425078675 | Identifying real problems that can be worked on is the hard part. Then a feasible, attainable solution has to be found. For each one.And at the same time, the people who are taking advantage of the situation must somehow be dealt with.
10 | Cindy Adams | 10154696712668675_10154697450058675 | The right-wing conservatives trying to throw themselves at Putin's feet is the most shocking! He is exactly like Duterte, and Kim Jong...
11 | Elaine Moore Clary | 10154696712668675_10154698514313675 | When Freedom of the Press is bought ( by 5 major Tycoons) or suppressed ( by corporations Dakota Access Pipeline- Amy Goodman) we no longer are free. Nor do the We The People have a say.So slowly have our rights and freedoms been eroding to the point we will have to work diligently to right these wrongs, or we will be lost as a democracy, if we're not already too late.
12 | Julie Hampton | 10154696712668675_10154698404158675 | Hillary... REALLY fits this.  America, always the last to figure out the WORST candidate . These candidates ALWAYS believe eugenics & genocide is a great way to  rid a country of 'undesirables / deplorables'. Hell , it's a law so you can't make it any easier. Deny one persons rights, their existence -  over anothers. Fly under the radar, so to speak - because in your supporters & the medias eyes - YOU can do no wrong. Even tho your criminal acts have been dually reported, they get overlooked.You don't have to worry about immigration - life is stopped before it begins.While some idiot like Trump blathers on, a deceiving, conniving psycho wraps their lies around the mindless - who buy into it. Hillary ,if elected, the worst to befall America since ...Nothing could be worse ( except Trump - both qualify for infamy)

18 | Leigh Ann Stumblingbear | 10154696712668675_10154697006433675 | Exactly. When you have someone like Trump who is trying to change the rules talking about Police Actions, building Walls, disbanding or demanding money from NATO to alienate us from the world, to discriminate against the masses. Indicates this will turn from a presidency to a Dictatorship. This is a man who is unpredictable and mean. Who chooses retaliation to negotiation. This is not who we are. This is who we were. America has always been Great. Because We care and We try and We don't give up. We love and We grieve and We rejoice. We err and We learn. 👊👌✌✊👍💜💜

2 | Tammy Cocagne | 10154696676663675_10154698819148675 | Kings and kingdoms will all pass away by the way of moth and rust..... Gods Word will never pass away! We need to be about His business spreading the Good Word of The Gospel of Christ by helping the less fortunate and the homeless!!! Not restoring an old pair of shoes! This is a classic example of the fact that we are living in the last days! To just waste $ on such foolishness!!!
3 | Sj Lag | 10154696676663675_10154697158798675 | PBS You've Chosen to cover this story for days online and now you carved space on your broadcast also??? The story on the Dakota Pipeline Protest was terribly done without a foundation or reference work done at all. The reporter was dismissive and bored with his assignment. Perhaps more time and effort could be spared on real Americans in Harms way. And less on the Smithsonians misguided fundraiser.
4 | Tammy Cocagne | 10154696676663675_10154696995463675 | I love the shoes and the nostalgia but lets be reasonable and use some Godly wisdom. 300,000,00 What are we doin?

9 | Deborah Prust Adams | 10154696676663675_10154698012783675 | The real story seems to me to be: why does this cost 300k?!
10 | Margaret Canepa | 10154696676663675_10154698368428675 | How much money for repairing a pair of shoes? My first thought was how many people that money could help.
11 | Garry W Campbell | 10154696676663675_10154696868878675 | The sign above these shoes reads that the original shoes were stolen. These are Dollar Store fakes.

15 | Linda Anderson | 10154696676663675_10154696896578675 | Whew!  That money could have been put to good use.  How about funding the Standing Rock camp?  Or cleaning up Flint's drinking water?

"We're well-past the issue of debating and arguing about transgender. We are now into execution, to make sure the program is carried out with diligence, dignity, respect," said the U.S. Army's chief of staff.

Treat everybody with dignity and respect. Period. Flat out. Full stop.”That's what I remember from my time in the military:"Does it say "US ARMY" over their heart on their uniform?  That's all you need to know.  If it says US ARMY you treat them like any other soldier."
2 | Jada Witmer | 10154696399618675_10154697489798675 | I truly do not care how someone wants to live life. It doesn't affect me, just as my life doesn't effect anyone else. So, you be you. In the military, every man and woman that volunteers has duties to perform. As long as those duties are performed honorably, what's the big deal? I'm just really hoping that they don't make a big deal about pronouns. He/his/him/her/she...mister...ma'am...for officers, sir. Those are excellent pronouns. I have heard these other pronouns...and they sound so unrealistic and completely made up. But, hey, you be you and live your life. Just don't expect everybody to use certain pronouns to make you happy.

This warning from former Supreme Court Justice David Souter has found new life in the 2016 election http://to.pbs.org/2dQqiTI
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Maureen Taylor | 10154696525323675_10154696941263675 | Rachel Maddow showed this speech by Souter he made 4 yrs ago,last week its chilling, I am glad it is making the rounds, share it. And for the Country sake vote blue....I think this race is very close, he has lied his way this far, a flagrant narcissistic, he could pull this off, forget the polls...VOTE...
2 | Wynn Wilson | 10154696525323675_10154696943828675 | This started in 1947 when the decision was made by conservatives to brand all Democrats as Socialist Commie Athiest and we ended up with Richard Nixon as VP and hatred of commies was the battle cry of all politicians. 60000 young Americans died because of these politicians. When Russia collapsed in the 90s' because it was using too much of its resources fightng wars around the world we no longer had the commies to hate. Then we had 911 and a whole new group of people to hate in the Muslims. We are our own worst enemies because of political fighting that weakens America and we may experience what Russia experienced in the 90s' We have squandered trillions of dollars in the middle east and have let America stagnate while we fight these useless religious wars.
3 | Robert Pental | 10154696525323675_10154696768488675 | Democracy, hahaha in a two party entrenched and self-severing system. Democracy dies when it implodes and refuses to expand and grow it options and awareness.
4 | Will Baker | 10154696525323675_10154696837483675 | VOTE!  VOTE!  VOTE!!!  While many are not pleased with the candidates staying away from the poles is not an option.  Listen to the words, look at the platform, and VOTE!
5 | Denise Atherton | 10154696525323675_10154698431613675 | "...excerpts of a public conversation I held four years ago with retired Supreme Court Justice David Souter in Concord, New Hampshire, have been circulating on the internet.We spoke on September 14, 2012, the 225th anniversary of the Constitution, on a subject dear to Souter’s heart: the meaning of the Constitution today, and the importance of educating young people on how their government works." How prophetic!!!!! Scary!!!!
6 | Kevin Kessing | 10154696525323675_10154696912693675 | The thing about it is that our government already has complete control. They didnt even have to ask for it. Yall volunteered it.
7 | Francesca LaPlante-Sosnowsky | 10154696525323675_10154696919913675 | Powerful and freightening, but oh so very true.  We best heed Justice Souter's words, or we will rue the day we did not heed the warning.
8 | Rod Jones | 10154696525323675_10154697004708675 | Wow...saying it as it is...a government that does not act on its responsibilities will die with people demanding someone take the reins of power and fix what isn't being done. So clearly stated.
9 | Rebecca Meiers-De Pastino | 10154696525323675_10154696825523675 | This is the kind of analysis our media should have been doing and parallels that it should have been drawing since day one.  Just posting a video taped long ago is too little too late.
10 | Laura Roberts | 10154696525323675_10154697088568675 | We know who the underperforming, obstructionist politicians are who signed the Pledge and I hope we vote them out.
11 | Otohiko Okugawa | 10154696525323675_10154696955453675 | It's so ironic that what he discussed here 4 years ago is so clearly superimposed in Trump's series of "I can fix it" statements.
12 | Steve Pecchio | 10154696525323675_10154696947478675 | Sounds like your describing the Obama Presidency> We have never endured more "Executive Override (Overreach !!!) This "Democracy" is starting to resemble a "Totalitarian State"!!!
13 | Mary Heinrichs | 10154696525323675_10154698071248675 | The melt down of Wall Street Banks was caused by our government regulations. There were people in the financial industry and government that were warning of the crisis. So the government took it upon itself after to make more regulations so it didn't happen again and give even more power to the large banks. Looks to me like these words which are true, can be twisted for either party. The corruption of our government with Hillary in power will be more of what is good for the few in charge and we the people will find ourselves,  over regulated with less freedoms. Since the press doesn't seem to cover the email drops showing the misuse of the law, press and government I'll give you one I found rather enlightening. " Hillary needs her base to remain uninformed and compliant" sounds like brown shirts to me:(
14 | Debbie Connolly | 10154696525323675_10154696784518675 | NO ONE Is innocent- we are all part of the problem.
15 | Mike N Toby Berke | 10154696525323675_10154696802148675 | Sounds sort of like what happened in 1980 with Mr. Reagan. Middle class hasn't recovered yet!Oh, yes, in case you forgot about it...
16 | William H Boley | 10154696525323675_10154696766293675 | And, remember, it was G. H. W. Bush who appointed the wise Justice Souter.
17 | J Matson Heininger | 10154696525323675_10154698651448675 | With the election of Hillary a candidate who did her best to rig the outcomes we will be far along this path. The path where people give up.
18 | F Xavier Ponce | 10154696525323675_10154698832043675 | Or maybe that is the way Democracy is saved from the Established politicians from both sides who are dragging us down the wrong path! Sometimes you just have to clean house!! The Romans went the other way and destroyed themselves with corruption and greed from within!
19 | David Clink | 10154696525323675_10154698387393675 | If you think there's really that much difference between Republicans and Democrats these days, you have no clue what the fundamental problem is.
20 | Steve Tellar | 10154696525323675_10154698500073675 | Democracy dies a little every time, when religion is added to the mix, the falseness and ignorance of religion will always destroy a society.
21 | David Weaver | 10154696525323675_10154696760963675 | By his own doing Trump has fractured the AMERICA never mind all the damage he has done to the GOPVote for HopeVote for Sec Hillary Clinton We give a hand up not hand outsWe love our brothers and sisters we are not haters, tyrants or misogynistVote the obstructionist outGet clueI am America so much so you have the right to your beliefs Religious freedom you speak of yet the most dangerous man in the world has called for hate, condemnation of freedom of religion and has been nothing more than a tyrantThe only person worse than him is putin I pray my God shows you the truth behind his actionsNever in the history of this nation has anyone wanting to be president called on the communist tyrants to help him win a political raceThis is the monster you are backing Freedom for the free world is what we pray forLook deep into your hearts and souls you will find the truthRacism misogyny and liesNow, they want to close down inner city school in a move to dumb down minorities and those who need a hand upPresident Obama has opened the door to all Americans seeking higher education and Trump wants to close the path to educationShame on Trump and those who back themWhat about the steel industry he claims he supports this nations laborers yet he has bought steel from china to build his building he buys his furniture from china and many other productsHe lies to the nines because that's what they doJust ask Putin how often the communist lies and has commited murder to get his wayDon't trust this man he's not the right manYou should have kicked him out of your party when you had the chance At least Jeb. Bush you know where his heart truly comes fromSad sad sadTrump has 4 Federal investigation! 1) alleged rape of 13 year old girl. 2) Tax investigation. And refusal to release tax records even though pissed and moan for Romney to release his !! 3) operating a Fake university !! 4) Fake Foundation!!Haters don't love anythingHillary is only one voiceThe voice of those who seek hopeJust as Trump is to those left in the GOPYour choice has already done so much damage and he's not in office Says so much for TrumpThen he asked the leader murder and thief of the Russian nation to commit espionage against our republicHe's a communist sympathizerNow, Trump is attacking the 1st amendment saying we need to take away this freedomBefore this recent attack on the constitution he and his cronies attacked the 19th amendmentHe will stop at nothing

"We aspire to a race-blind justice system – why not actually make decisions blind?" (from The Conversation US)
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Matthew Dancz | 10154696420568675_10154696757113675 | This actually makes a lot of sense. Simply present the evidence to the Jury of a nameless and faceless suspect, and if their is enough to convict with that info, then bias couldn't have been a factor.
2 | JT Zak | 10154696420568675_10154696899568675 | While blacks are dispraportionaly prosecuted with harsh sentences..this is not only a racial matter but a class matter...what the studies faul to include are the disproportionate numbers of poor whites over middle class and upper middle class whites..I would speculate those numbers are close to the same per capita as blacks.
3 | Frank Allen | 10154696420568675_10154696844793675 | How about only allowing live fire ammunition for senior staff? If you are a rookie, you ONLY get a billy club, a tazer, a stun gun, pepper spray and your training? Later. When you older, wiser, maybe, we give you a gun?
4 | Bruce Mccoy | 10154696420568675_10154697079143675 | I agree, police training isn't nearly enough, and 'blinding' may help, but a prosecutor can deduce a lot from police reports, so it's not the panacea.
5 | Cate Callahan | 10154696420568675_10154696774068675 | Also, the criminal element need some reform as well.  All three of them need to clean up their act. ...criminals, police, prosecutors. Still say BLM could do such a lot of good working in troubled neighborhoods (black and white, if they wish) with each family, helping them to know the importance of supporting their kids' education, etc.
6 | Duke Marryshow | 10154696420568675_10154696734378675 | That is not an excuse for failing to properly train police. There are many problems and they need to be fixed. One at a time.
7 | Hal Briggs | 10154696420568675_10154696751693675 | Did Jill Stein say something about this in that deleted interview portion?
8 | Terry Carpenter | 10154696420568675_10154696737383675 | Racial bias starts in the home, in school, in church and ends up growing in the heart.
9 | Nick Anderson | 10154696420568675_10154696729673675 | The system doesn't need to be reformed, it needs to be destroyed.
10 | Albert Smith | 10154696420568675_10154697456643675 | it would help it bigots weren't hired as police officers to begin with
11 | Fred Mcateer | 10154696420568675_10154696805713675 | What we need first and foremost is review of the use of deadly force.
12 | Peter Hobbs Di Grazia | 10154696420568675_10154698403903675 | "What’s wrong with our police?” Remarkably, one of the most compelling but unexplored explanations may rest with a FBI warning of October 2006, which reported that “White supremacist infiltration of law enforcement” represented a significant national threat.Several key events preceded the report. A federal court found that members of a Los Angeles sheriffs department formed a Neo Nazi gang and habitually terrorized the black community. Later, the Chicago police department fired Jon Burge, a detective with reputed ties to the Ku Klux Klan, after discovering he tortured over 100 black male suspects. Thereafter, the Mayor of Cleveland discovered that many of the city police locker rooms were infested with “White Power” graffiti. Years later, a Texas sheriff department discovered that two of its deputies were recruiters for the Klan.http://thegrio.com/2015/05/12/fbi-white-supremacists-law-enforcement/

Moreover, about 1 in 5 consumers will only have plans from a single insurer to pick from, after several major national carriers scaled back their roles.

1 | Janet Jones | 10154696522023675_10154696569443675 | perhaps if we win the congress we can have a single payer program...real universal health care like grown up countries give to their citizens! most of us consider the ACA as a stop gap measure until the real thing can finally happen!
2 | Mike Simmons | 10154696522023675_10154696561918675 | I wonder what ACA would be without the insurance companies?!  Everybody complains about government-run healthcare. What makes you think that insurance companies have anything but their own bottom-line as a primary concern?
3 | Jeff Plassmeyer | 10154696522023675_10154696611133675 | Yaaa that's what happens when Republican governors refuse obamacare. It's only cheap when cost is shared like group insurance. Fine! Republicans thought obamacare was socialism, now we're going to straight socialism single payer! LOL oh yeah
4 | George F Franks III | 10154696522023675_10154696567218675 | Mine has gone up 30% but it beats not having any health care. If you're a former corporate employee, you're screwed in the healthcare market. Self-employed.
5 | Denny Lama | 10154696522023675_10154696579373675 | Hope the insurance companies keep it up and Hillary will be forced to join the rest of the civilized world and implement Universal Health care.Of course if Trump wins millions will end up without health care all together
6 | Malinda Mindy Murphy Brannan | 10154696522023675_10154696707653675 | Everytime I read something about the ACA I get mad, the companies blame the ACA but yet give the top people millions of dollars in bonuses and not pass it on the people they insure. I agree with Mike Simmons, we need to look at the companies and profits and bonuses. Think the people are being used. Maybe the election is over those companies should be investigated
7 | Jeff Olsen | 10154696522023675_10154696642168675 | When corporations are allowed to put profit ahead of health care for working Americans, its criminal. Thanks again to Mitch McConnell's corrupt congress.
8 | Erika J Pozo | 10154696522023675_10154696611138675 | It's a shame. These insurance carriers were losing money because some people enrolled were already sick with so many medical issues. Imagine not seeing a doctor for years and neglecting your health? America's healthcare is beyond this! We need reform!
9 | Jeff Jenicek | 10154696522023675_10154696623703675 | Three years before the ACA took effect, health insurance premiums were increasing by 10 percent to 12 percent each year, and the rate of the uninsured was growingSource: https://www.healthinsurance.org/blog/2016/07/29/health-premiums-after-obamacare-theyre-lower/So it is increasing about the same as it was before Obamacare? Or am I reading something wrong? Another good article: http://kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/analysis-of-2017-premium-changes-and-insurer-participation-in-the-affordable-care-acts-health-insurance-marketplaces/
10 | Rose-Marie Audette Schirmer | 10154696522023675_10154696722193675 | After Hillary wins, she plans, with Bernie's help to fine tune ACA, but she needs majority in Congress to get it done! Vote blue!
11 | Michael Bludworth | 10154696522023675_10154696545133675 | ...and this after a year of record profits and CEO bonuses for the industry.
12 | Mark S. Hogan | 10154696522023675_10154696791603675 | We need to quickly change the name of this program once Hillary is elected so Congress can then be mature enough to start working to address our health care system's many faults.
13 | Jeanne Dobbs | 10154696522023675_10154696722868675 | Good. To hell with them. Bring on single payer. Insurance companies are the rapists of our nation. Always have been always will be. Good riddance.
14 | Matt Neely | 10154696522023675_10154696630658675 | Great.  Moving toward the goal:  we pay every month and then seek no care because we are afraid of the ensuing bankruptcy caused by hidden costs and copays.The insurance companies are making a killing (literally).
15 | Robert Crawford | 10154696522023675_10154697365718675 | The problems began when the SC overuled the mandate that forced all the states to create exchanges and to expand Medicaid to 135% of the poverty level. The competition and the increased revenues from having more providers involved was a key part of bending the cost curve. The ACA was really just a stop gap in the money bleeding that was taking place before it was introduced, far from perfect even in it's proposed form. Republicans wanted to kill it outright. But in the long run, crippling it by not creating the state exchanges and refusing to take the Medicaid expansion in those states was almost as good for them as repealing it. Now they can say it didn't work and no government run health care system will either. Meanwhile,  20-30 million more people could have had some form of health insurance who currently don't have any,  and by their obstruction they put in jeopardy the 20 million people who now have insurance for the first time of losing what they got.
16 | Don MacLean | 10154696522023675_10154696652518675 | Stunning. The government caused massive increases in healthcare costs (as many of us predicted), and the Left's 'solution' is to call for more government intervention. You couldn't make it up!
17 | Bev Putnam | 10154696522023675_10154698105213675 | Thank you lobbyists, greedy insurance companies, drug companies, advancement in medical technology, bad habits (i.e. Smoking), and ignorant consumers who don't actual price of the services they use.
18 | Mark Simchock | 10154696522023675_10154696584468675 | Everyone wants lower healthcare costs but no one wants to be the first to take at least some responsibility for their own diet and lifestyle. "Rights" without responsibilities? What could go wrong? #WelcomeToTheMatrix #AMatrixca
19 | Carrie Walker Ruano | 10154696522023675_10154696681803675 | Hillary will fix it, the pharmaceuticals have jacked up the prices so high, maybe Affordable Care should order medications from Canada!
20 | Sandy Cox | 10154696522023675_10154696560488675 | so many people brought this concern up when obama care was first passed, and that the initial subsidies were temporary. Democrats said they didnt care and hadnt even read the plan but passed it anyway. Republicans objected strongly to obama care but never put forth any other plan for over 8 years. Health care in US needed reform, but cant we possibly have a bipartisan plan or reform that actually helps with the real issues?
21 | Stephen Tonnies | 10154696522023675_10154697856753675 | The U.S. needs to follow the example of most western countries including NZ and Australia into a government run health care program with the option of private insurance for those of means. It ensures EVERYONE has health care.
22 | Janice Wong | 10154696522023675_10154697261223675 | Not sure why every other developed country can make national healthcare work but America. Oh wait, for the love of money, yes, I do know: 1) A selfish society of the haves and 2) Shareholder profits.
23 | Shirley Bateman | 10154696522023675_10154696775233675 | It isn't just Obamacare  I have medicare B & a supplement every year my supplement went  up medicare B went up this year waiting to see if it goes up next year. Its the high premiums the insurance carriers keep hiking as well as pharmaceutical companys. The Govt. needs to step on them!!
24 | Cheryl Kreiser | 10154696522023675_10154696945293675 | If the republicans had cooperated to fine tune the ACA...we WOULD NOT HAVE THIS PROBLEM! They should be brought up on charges for not doing the job they were hired to do. They are guilty.
25 | Anthony L. Swain | 10154696522023675_10154696786478675 | They also announced equally high increases in the rebatesthe problems will persist until insurance companies are eliminated

While the tension between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump has made headlines, clashes between police and protesters against the Dakota Access Pipeline got more intense recently.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Danny Hill | 10154696431623675_10154696800268675 | So armed white dudes can take over a National Wildlife Refuge but unarmed Native people protecting sacred land and they call in riot cops, WTF!
2 | Lillie Kite | 10154696431623675_10154696695958675 | Sounds like you took your information more one sided in your viewpoint.  The day the arrest took place that you are referring to:  the protectors were telling the police officers they loved them.  The police officers cut through the fence separating them advanced and finally used pepper spray.  Threw people to the ground.  The only violence was by the hands of law enforcement.  The other one you speak of was a prayer meeting place near the destroyed burial grounds.  After the ceremony, police moved in as people were trying to leave.  This was when Shalene Woodley was singled out and arrested.  The truth will come out sooner or later that the Sheriffs office is using the pretense of violence by protectors to get more armed reinforcements.  Who is paying the taxes on all the lies that the pipeline workers and sheriffs office is stirring up?  This is. Dangerous position he has put the peaceful people into.  Sheriffs office will be brought to justice if anyone is killed by law enforcement.
3 | Sarah Kenniff | 10154696431623675_10154696619718675 | Shame on you PBS as you've been as guilty as the networks and cable channels. Yes! There are other things that are newsworthy..😐
4 | LenDawg LaCasse | 10154696431623675_10154696496198675 | I've been up to date, I have Native American Friends... not looking real good... why do ya think they have fema camps in the South West?.... I do believe this is what the whole jade helm 15 conspiracy is/was about... hmm..
5 | Charlotte Downey | 10154696431623675_10154696715938675 | PBS: thanks for the mention, tiny as it was. What seems completely off, was that you failed to bring a Tribal leader to speak about this. The confiscation of Native resource and violation of Sacred Land continues the genocide. Please reconsider your choice of guest to speak on this matter.Hopefully, you will continue to give air time to the issue and police violence done to unarmed, peaceful Water Protectors. Native people are subjected to police brutality, but it's totally overlooked in the media.
6 | Molly Walts | 10154696431623675_10154696845163675 | Law enforcement used as Private Police. I watch posted videos and see who is creating these "clashes". We should all be apalled at the lack of legal permitting for this pipeline but the most appalling of all is the militerized police being used to further the poluting of our water.
7 | Julie Won | 10154696431623675_10154696864388675 | I think it's tragedy that government is still doing same crap to native Americans they used to do.  Just respect their wishes and keep promises!!  This money is king culture needs to stop!!
8 | Justin Louvier | 10154696431623675_10154696694183675 | Whose fault is it? I say it is the money driven media that is at fault. If the media were really reporters and could afford to be the above mentioned stories would be in the news.
9 | Lori Crites | 10154696431623675_10154698726233675 | As a sovereign nation, the tribes declared eminent domain yesterday and took back their land. President Obama is supposed to be meeting with tribe council today. Maybe you can find an unbiased reporter to cover that.
10 | William H Boley | 10154696431623675_10154696480018675 | The important pipeline protests have been overshadowed by the political news, but I hope this gets more of the coverage it deserves.

12 | Tom Harder | 10154696431623675_10154696535288675 | Someone at these incessant rallies needs to ask the candidates what they think of this DAPL fiasco.
13 | Anne Shay | 10154696431623675_10154697698878675 | 2 years of election coverage the media was creating a reality soap drama!!  A bad one too! Drowned out the real injustice that is happening
14 | Richard Parker | 10154696431623675_10154698165718675 | William Shakespeare is more important than tensions increasing between the USA and Russia? NPR, you arent reporting on problems, you are part of the problem..

17 | Maria Guillory | 10154696431623675_10154696511803675 | The national guard should be called in to protect Native Americans in this situation!!!
18 | Tina Edmond | 10154696431623675_10154696602453675 | Interesting the pipeline was completed on both ends up to this point.  I am sharing this and asking my FB friends to do likewise.
19 | Karen Hendricks | 10154696431623675_10154696577743675 | Boy I would sure hate to see this turn into a Ruby Ridge. Its time for the government to listen so that another path can be taken.
20 | Erika J Pozo | 10154696431623675_10154696568368675 | It isn't enough that administration after administration took and denied Native Americans so much!
21 | Pat Ford | 10154696431623675_10154696609888675 | It is not the candidates who are not covering this news story! It shines a poor light on American news media!
22 | Helen Teevan | 10154696431623675_10154696884348675 | This was an under covered story long before the politics got so crazy.
23 | Peter McAteer | 10154696431623675_10154696524683675 | The Americans are lucky. Canadian natives during the Oka standoff had assault rifles. The real kind,not the Walmart kind.
24 | Eva Wojcik | 10154696431623675_10154696721253675 | Hey, PBS, there are people in Iowa also standing against the DAPL. FYI, they're called "Protectors" not protesters. There's a world of meaning in each word. For in depth, comprehensive coverage http://www.democracynow.org/topics/dakota_access
25 | Virginia Perez | 10154696431623675_10154696482858675 | If you're like me, the sight and sound of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump make you want to vomit. There is a solution, it's called working the electoral college against them both. It's going to take guts. Here is how, if you live in a state that does not require write in registration (Vermont, Wyoming, Oregon, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Iowa, Delaware, and Alabama) you write in Bernie. This will remove those states from the electoral map which makes it easier for a third party candidate to win enough electoral votes with the other states. Everyone else, if your state is mostly blue, vote Jill Stein. If your state is mostly red, vote Gary Johnson. This should swing the majority vote to the third party candidate in most cases. Neither Jill Stein or Gary Johnson are perfect candidates, but Clinton and Trump sure as heck aren't either. But Stein and Johnson are less likely to kill us or get us killed. Bernie would get a total of 49 electoral votes, if people did this it would kick it right over to the House who would choose from the top three. Trump and Clinton would not be president. Trump and Clinton are political poison to US House Reps who are up for election every two years. Beyond that, there is no guarantee Trump and Clinton will both be in the top three if people follow through with this, could be Bernie, Stein and Johnson. Like I said it's going to take guts but if we don't try we're weak and we will end up with Trump or Clinton anyway. The Founding Fathers gave us an out for a reason and this is it.

Deceivers often recall how small acts of dishonesty snowballed over time into large crimes. A new study explain why that happens. (from Scientific American magazine)
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Russell Akred | 10154696258198675_10154696423008675 | Does that mean start believing Trump lies means you believe more Trump lies?
2 | Rick Martinez | 10154696258198675_10154696532378675 | "DARVO refers to a reaction that perpetrators of wrong doing, particularly sexual offenders, may display in response to being held accountable for their behavior. The perpetrator or offender may Deny the behavior, Attack the individual doing the confronting, and Reverse the roles of Victim and Offender such that the perpetrator assumes the victim role and turns the true victim into an alleged offender. This occurs, for instance, when an actually guilty perpetrator assumes the role of “falsely accused” and attacks the accuser’s credibility or even blames the accuser of being the perpetrator of a false accusation.” Donald Trump is Dangerous
3 | T.m. Daldry | 10154696258198675_10154696534193675 | Wow, didn't take long for Trump Trolls to post here....lol...why am I not surprised?I wonder if they get paid by the character?
4 | Maria Cristina Friday | 10154696258198675_10154696746858675 | I know someone who makes up stuff as she gets a kick out of people's response, which is generally to believe and give her good feedback no matter how incongruous her claims. Nobody challenges her, and she doesn't bother to say she's just kidding, so the lies stand. I called her on it once and she tried to shift the blame to me, saying I'd upset her so she lied.  I've decided she can't help herself as lying is her source of entertainment in an otherwise barren life.
5 | Larry St. John | 10154696258198675_10154696721403675 | I had a dream that America was covered with ashes. As I was walking our streets the ashes we're so deep that they were covering my mouth and nose and trying to cover my eyes.The most important thing about this election.The same ashes  of the concentration camps and ovens of the 1940s are falling upon the United States every single day.  Half of this beloved country is blinded by these demonic ashes and are in denial of what is going on in their cities and in our country.  Planned Parenthood, though your required contribution, provides the murder of a could be beautiful person every 97 seconds. 1 out of 8 women who walk into a Planned Parenthood "Clinic"  today will end the life of a  beautiful person.   Every 97 seconds a beating heart is stopped and a girl, or a boy, a could be artist, doctor,  musician,  teacher or someone else wonderful is murdered in one of these Federally funded  clinics that you are forced to be paying for.  Sadly this is just an example of only 34% of the abortions Nationwide today. Last year we gave 540 million dollars to Planned Parenthood and you had no say in the matter. In the 1930s the world had Hitler saying that the Jews were not true people and he was voted into power. 150 years ago in the United States we had the Democrats in  the USA saying that the black man was not a true human and could be used in slavery.  And today by law you are required to help pay for such a evil as this. This is truly why this debate is so controversial and so ugly.  It is the same evil demonic energy of the1860s and of the 1940s.  Today in 2016 as yesterday we have half of our country in deep delusional denial.  Some deceived leaders like Obama and Hillary tickle our ears, and try to numb out our conscience by telling us that "abortion is just a sad choice that women sometimes have to make".  This evil can go as far as selling the body parts of the babies that have been murdered.This is why it is so important to stop Hillary now. A vote for Hillary and her party is truly a vote for the most horrible demonic evil in the world today. Democrats clean the ashes out of your eyes you have been blinded to the truth and you are under the influence of an evil demonic power. Those not blinded,  wipe the ashes from your mouths, pray and do not remain silent.   Dante said "the darkest places in Hell are reserved for those who remain neutral during times of moral crisis."   The lives of tens of millions and the very soul of United States of America is truly at stake. If not stopped NOW this evil of calling another human not human will spread over us in a 100 different ways.  Today Democrats scream at Pro Life people and call us uneducated,  religious zealots,  control freaks and stupid fools, showing that they believe they are more and others are less.  Hillary yells that we are “Deplorable!” much like Hitler did to those who disagreed with him in the 1930s.   History shows that in the near future this demonic energy will pull us into World War 3 just as it did into the Civil War and World Wars; where some believed and treated other human beings less then they.

2 | Pat Cunningham | 10154696255243675_10154696315218675 | What a ridiculous question; have you spent time in libraries...especially when there are children present? Librarians can be an invaluable resource for the community. Libraries are not only places to find answers, they are a place of discovery.
3 | Brian Speer | 10154696255243675_10154697113743675 | There's simply been a shift in how information is accessed at libraries. Librarians help people find information, and they're now trained in internet searches as well as with books.
4 | RM Thompson | 10154696255243675_10154696368668675 | sure if you don't want any substantiated information, sure, use Google or whatever is on the internet. and the two can work very well with each other...but you're going to need a librarian either way if you want the good stuff, ie...substantiated information.and that just about the use of resources...there's also the community needs meet by a library. even without a physical collection ( the wave of the future for libraries) the spaces themselves can be utilized.libraries are like churches....people often mistaken it's the building that makes it a church or library, but they're wrong, it's the people.
5 | Debra Henk | 10154696255243675_10154696599783675 | I work for University of Missouri Extension, and we hear that too.  When you visit an Extension Office, you can be sure the info you get is researched and reviewed by experts in their fields.
6 | Ralph Olynyk | 10154696255243675_10154697946988675 | YES!!! because strolling down aisles of books, without a specific book in mind, is an awesome way to discover knowledge one didnt even know they wanted...prob with internet 'searches' is that you need to know what your looking for to find it. I discovered some artists in libraries that i never heard of before, the book jumped out at me, and i sat mesmerized for hours leafing thru the book..cant do that online...
7 | Molly Nixon | 10154696255243675_10154697611433675 | Oh my goodness yes! Our librarian not onlly is a wealth of knowledge, but she organizes our summer reading program and was instramental in raising money for our city to build a new library! The role may have changed, but our librarians are not replaceable!
8 | Jëff Earthman Cosgrove-Cook | 10154696255243675_10154698581263675 | Judging from the quality of sources that much of my newsfeed is congested with, I would say we are in desperate need of Librarians to assist with sorting through the dross.
9 | Diana Galbraith | 10154696255243675_10154697883238675 | Absolutely, we need libraries. It is a place where people actually have connection with the real thing...real people, real story tellers, and above all, real books. You can't hack real books.
10 | Ty Johnson | 10154696255243675_10154697429693675 | For many, the Library is the only " live " thing outside the home.... Wi-fi, music and movies. Information on how to negotiate life and someone to guide you to a starting point.....
11 | John ONeill | 10154696255243675_10154696601153675 | yep..and all librians should be trained on "how" to teach people to do research not only in hard copy...but also on the internet...that would make them REAL value added..
12 | Kathryn Hardesty | 10154696255243675_10154696305173675 | More than ever! too much information to sort through...lots of instruction to use technology, find good books, support literacy, help immigrants learn English.....
13 | Bettylou M. Smith | 10154696255243675_10154696747553675 | Never get rid of the written word, technology is great when it works, but what happens in a calamity and what to do, "read a book" comes to mind.
14 | Elly Moloney | 10154696255243675_10154696480303675 | I like having a book in my hand, but until we find a more efficient way to make paper (duh hemp), digital is the best way for the planet.
15 | Tisha Huebsch | 10154696255243675_10154698775918675 | I'm still upset about the Dewey Decimal system. I am not a fan of that change. I also prefer to read paper books as opposed to those on tablets. I try to instill this in my children as well.
16 | Leigh Ann Stumblingbear | 10154696255243675_10154697016008675 | Oh yes! We may have books., but the librarian helps us learn to explore by suggesting. They are the human element. They are the extension of all knowledge that a computer or internet can't achieve. Also the poor and less advantaged come to these places to have access to copiers, books and Internet services. We need the Library and its staff.

22 | Rose Pribula | 10154696255243675_10154696473198675 | Info on the internet isn't comprehensive let alone accurate. Librarians guide you to the resources and recommend authors.

24 | Terry Carpenter | 10154696255243675_10154696325033675 | Not everyone has the internet or wants the internet. Power failure oops no internet. Massive satellite failure, oops no TV, no internet, no iPhones.
25 | Robert Hassler | 10154696255243675_10154696291473675 | Of course.we do.  Never heard of a library getting hacked now have you.  Libraries educate, while the internet continues the dumbing down started by television.

Immigrants must use a legal process to advance their concerns.

Donations from more than 5,300 supporters from 41 countries helped the Smithsonian raise more than $300,000 to preserve Dorothy's ruby slippers from "The Wizard of Oz."
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Peg O'Donnell | 10154695472303675_10154695478563675 | We (the world included) have people living on the streets including veterans, children living in cars, elderly w/lack of food yet a movie item gets all this interest & money...something wrong w/this picture!
2 | Maureen Strain | 10154695472303675_10154695482708675 | Oh good grief. I wish this money were instead being used to help the overwhelming number of global refugees and displaced persons.  What a waste.
3 | Tracy Henjum Newman | 10154695472303675_10154695690613675 | I am all for protecting art and culture but really. I was stocked when I heard this on NPR. Outrageous. Lets raise that for needy children. Slap some glue on shoes and call them done.
4 | Miri Elaine | 10154695472303675_10154695538703675 | I mean..that's all well and good, but there are much more important things to fund than keeping up a pair of shoes no one's gonna wear.
5 | John Poynton | 10154695472303675_10154695584598675 | All the while people are living on the streets, our infrastructure is falling apart, people can't afford their medications and we are worried about a stupid pair of shoes?
6 | Mark Christ | 10154695472303675_10154697238893675 | Ok, so, in an age where "Make America Great" is a slogan, a great American institution is doing what it was set up to do, to ensure evidence of American greatness isn't ravaged by the effects of time, and people are outraged. Hmmm. Let's not forget that the Smithsonian is FREE for everyone, offering educational experiences like none other, and they house so many vital American artifacts. If these donors saw importance in these slippers (and they are a massive cultural artifact), then let them spend their money. Don't be upset at the Smithsonian Inst. They are a national treasure.
7 | Gretchen DeKok | 10154695472303675_10154696004593675 | I saw a pair of the ruby slippers when the Smithsonian did a travelling exhibit, years ago. It was in San Jose, about two hours from me, and I knew I'd kick myself if I didn't go. I was SO glad that I did!
8 | J.A. Murphy | 10154695472303675_10154695542613675 | Yes, well...so much more valid than kids starving, hurricanes in Haiti or bag-ladies living on the street.  Definitely a major issue!!
9 | Doug Sawyer | 10154695472303675_10154695513158675 | I remember one time here when a fund was set up for a family who lost everything in a house fire and a vet care fund for a cat that had been wounded in accident , the cat fund got 4X the money as the family.
10 | Bill Van Dyk | 10154695472303675_10154695983383675 | At this point I'm quite ready to live with someone going down the street to a shoe store and buying replacements for $100 or so and putting a cute little sign in front of them:  "The only thing amazing about the original ruby slippers is the amount of money foolish people were willing to spend on restoring them."
11 | Lillian Maxie | 10154695472303675_10154697980718675 | I'm sorry, that's a ridiculous use of that kind of money. People can't manage to donate large sums to charities that feed and house people, yet they will donate to something like this in a minute? Something's wrong.
12 | Sj Lag | 10154695472303675_10154695591488675 | Absolutely wrong give them back... Donate the money to art outreach in a poor community. Cut the funding by $300,000.00 fire the administration of the Smithsonian. We have Americans in dire poverty and they just raised $300,000.00 for the repair of glitter shoes? Outrageous and out of touch.
13 | Amy Hoppock | 10154695472303675_10154695709263675 | I have Ruby slippers..look very similar.. they were $40.00 on Amazon. Shame on you for spending  this kind of money on shoes..when so many Americans need food!
14 | Martha Coit Tyler | 10154695472303675_10154696256043675 | One of the most ridiculous things I've heard all year. One in five children are hungry in this country! Your priorities are upside down!
15 | Lily Vadakin | 10154695472303675_10154695988408675 | I'm happy to see that there are people who truly appreciate the treasures housed at the Smithsonian, which is free to the public and attracts visitors from all over the world. It's a worthy investment!
16 | Mark Christ | 10154695472303675_10154697271403675 | The Smithsonian is a NON-PROFIT organization. Meaning most of their collections rely on donor funding. This has been how they have always operated. Chill out, folks.
17 | Jeanette Collins | 10154695472303675_10154696593783675 | Maybe they can be used on tour to get funding for the needy.  I understand some people enjoy seeing them but that restoration fee could not possibly be reasonable.
18 | Bob Podstawski | 10154695472303675_10154696128083675 | This is quite disgusting in these days of war and famine in the world. Smithsonian...you should be ashamed..besides,$300,000 to restore shoes?? WTF!!
19 | Kelly Schlotterbeck | 10154695472303675_10154697413288675 | So...people will give for this, but not to help those in need? It's not a piece of Renaissance art, it's a shoe from a movie- a wonderful movie, but it's a shoe.
20 | Wynne Cook | 10154695472303675_10154696047843675 | What could possibly cost that much???.. It's ridiculous and wasteful to believe it couldn't be very perfectly done for 1/10 that cost.
21 | Doug Sawyer | 10154695472303675_10154695506133675 | Has the world gone completely mad? Why on earth it would cost $300K for an old pair of make believe shoes?
22 | Kate McGurl | 10154695472303675_10154696600158675 | What should we donate money for.....starving refugees? Americans without clean water?  Haiti? ....nah... let's donate a bunch of money to restore a pair of shoes, worn in a movie!
23 | Dorinda Mayhue | 10154695472303675_10154695846048675 | Well you know  the right shoes can change your life. I've heard that when the ruby slippers travel they have their own seat purchased for them.
24 | Dave Schmidt | 10154695472303675_10154695495973675 | What a waste!! Time to tune onto the world and disengage fm la-la land.

1 | Gary Johnson | 10154695294078675_10154695475263675 | It's this sort of article that makes me love the internet. Where else can I read about lichens without getting my hands on a scientific journal. Haha. Kudos to this guy and the reporter who kept me reading.
2 | George Stengren | 10154695294078675_10154695365453675 | The article's hook is a bit misleading. There is a substantial difference between being 'wrong' with regard to a scientific theory and having a theory that is incomplete. That aside, the implications of the triple symbiosis are fascinating.

It's sadly all too rare that someone with that much potential born into that kind of situation is able to escape, thrive and even make a meaningful contribution to the world.
4 | Meera Sharnoff | 10154695294078675_10154696342058675 | I can't help but plug my parents fantastic book here, to those interested in lichens in a more causal way.

Very cool interesting topic....love checking out all the stuff I growing in my yard.
6 | Melissa Merritt Morgan | 10154695294078675_10154696816688675 | Are we all missing that the discovery of three was not done alone. "That’s a theme that resonates throughout the history of symbiosis research—it takes an alliance of researchers to uncover nature’s most intimate partnerships."
7 | Mark Sather | 10154695294078675_10154695531368675 | No, they were not wrong, but 2/3rd's correct. It still is a symbiotic relationship. Hyperbole, hyperbole. Not to mention this is only a study on one type of lichen, it is a little early to announce that it is the same with all lichens, until research is done with those lichens also.

9 | Craig Olsson | 10154695294078675_10154695517123675 | Interesting article. The headline should be more faithful to the scientist's roots and state "How a Guy From a Montana Woman's Womb Overturned 150 Years of Biology".  For afterall, it wasn't the trailer park that produced the scientist, it was the womb. Right?
10 | Frances Alida Akridge | 10154695294078675_10154698736223675 | Scott Akridge, when we hike, we notice the patterns on rocks and twigs....it's great to know that a) a man who loves to learn was accepted to a college in Germany regardless of lack of transcripts, and b) that his research illuminates the mystery to more mystery!  “It makes lichens all the more remarkable,” adds Nick Talbot from the University of Exeter. “We now see that they require two different kinds of fungi and an algal species. If the right combination meet together on a rock or twig, then a lichen will form, and this will result in the large and complex plant-like organisms that we see on trees and rocks very commonly.  The mechanism by which this symbiotic association occurs is completely unknown and remains a real mystery.”
11 | Jim Eagleman | 10154695294078675_10154696858993675 | Just the 1 specie?  Maybe need more research into this interesting discovery; then it's back to school to retake that mycology class I slept thru!  Sorry Dr. O'Flaherty!
12 | Tom Kaun | 10154695294078675_10154695660993675 | They wrote the article as though there was some kind of conspiracy by scientists and textbook authors to confuse or mislead the unwitting public. What nonsense. Just click bait.
13 | Katie Bretsch | 10154695294078675_10154697908323675 | The handheld digital microscope will bring a new round of microscopy revolution. For example, some of the major diseases of aging, including Alzheimer's, are caused by a parasitic mite. Get someone to dna barcode (species screen) those Alzheimer's plaques.
14 | Kathleen Pepi Southern | 10154695294078675_10154695951753675 | Fascinating article; intended to just scan it  but ended up reading the whole thing word for word. Would say the word "overturned" is a bit extreme (clickbait-ish?)--I think more a case of supplemented and expanded the original symbiosis theory
15 | Brienne Colton | 10154695294078675_10154697449893675 | I found the anecdote, regarding the use of the term "symbiosis", fascinating! I then had to research it and learned that it had only been previously used in regards to people living together in a community!
16 | Donna Herbold | 10154695294078675_10154696695198675 | Whatever, I'm just jazzed with countries who offer higher education to those who don't always have that piece of paper or can't always meet rigid entrance requirements, I.e., $$$$
17 | Linda Pelon | 10154695294078675_10154695384198675 | Brought me back to reading "The Signature of all Things " by Elizabeth Gilbert
18 | Judith Fernandez | 10154695294078675_10154695608183675 | Fascinating. Also reveals that a strict religious upbringing in countryside and homeschooled cannot succeed in obliterating scientific curiosity!
19 | David Watson | 10154695294078675_10154695801423675 | That Montana Trailer Park headline is so tempting.  How could Montana Men let something like this get on the internet. Tip of the iceberg, good thing sheep can't read.
20 | Thomas Moriarty | 10154695294078675_10154698686798675 | It is very likely that something similar is happening with soil bacteria and is the reason why it has been so difficult to grow cultures of soil bacteria in the lab.
21 | Brian Boru | 10154695294078675_10154695399333675 | BTW speaking of microscopy, today is Antonie van Leeuwenhoek's 384 birthday.
22 | Kathleen Pepi Southern | 10154695294078675_10154695647428675 | Susan, was so disappointed yesterday that my venture into the heart if dreaded nature produced no fungi/lichen sightings to send to you
23 | Lisa Manting | 10154695294078675_10154695459463675 | So it's not just Freddy Fungus and Alice Algae that "lichen" each other, like I was taught back in the day? heheh
24 | Ruth Ann Moyer Varnell | 10154695294078675_10154696317308675 | We're going to need a new version of "Freddy Fungus and Alice Algae took a lichen to each other"
25 | Eric J. Francis | 10154695294078675_10154698458508675 | "Guy from a trailer park." Not "Bilingual, German-educated American researcher." Noted.
