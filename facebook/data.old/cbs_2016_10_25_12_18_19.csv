People are so influenced by corporate TV that we dont have to leak anything The good news is that terrorists think we are "greedy." Its the greed of corporations not American people. Jill Stein For PresidentWe do not need to build a wall we need to stop exploiting other countries in trade--that causes the outsourcing of U.S. jobs and illegal immigration. We don't profit off that. People have different interests than corporations.  They need to gradually increase wages; lowering wages and regulations here is not the answer. Peace, Planet, and People over Profit Jill Stein For President and down-ticket "Berniecrats"Higher wages and higher buying power for everyone will indeed produce more sales and profit for big-business. The interest of big-business do not have to conflict with workers' rights and environmental protection. Vote For Jill Stein For President and down-ticket Berniecrats

2 | Gerald Broadwater | 10154012275880950_10154012371385950 | If Beyoncé can run around almost naked and showing her big disgusting ass, she can expect to have people make jest of it..

Premiums will go up sharply next year under Obama’s health care law, and many consumers will be down to just one insurer, the administration has confirmed.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Elizabeth Hu | 10154012223660950_10154012256750950 | That moment when you hate a program that gives people who are working and are in poverty insurance. That moment when you hate a program that gives people with diseases you don't suffer with a way to not be turned down by insurers because of greed. Yes, the affordable care act needs work, but it is working.  Now if only we could get our congress to work to make it better.  That's going to happen next year under Hillary Clinton.
2 | Linda Bothern | 10154012223660950_10154012243440950 | Oh the people went crazy over Obama and voted for him twice and now look he scammed them into voting for him just like Hillary doing with Obama help....... Lazy Obama costed millions of American to pay out...
3 | Daniel Wornica | 10154012223660950_10154012240275950 | Yep this is working out great. Got to sign it to find out what is in it. If you like your doctor you can keep your doctor. Also that 1200 dollars in yearly savings. The solution you ask? Well more Govt of course.

6 | Rose Miceli Burke | 10154012223660950_10154012330905950 | Ha ha ha. CBS News must have choked at putting this story out. Can you please put in a link to Nancy Pelosi saying; Affordable, affordable, affordable, affordable and you will find out what's in Obamacare AFTER we enact it. Get ready for a single payer system because this one is tanking. It's what they talked about before shoving this down the throat of the American people. One of the biggest SCAMS perpetrated on the American people.
7 | Steve Lynn | 10154012223660950_10154012262700950 | I remember when the company you worked for provided health insurance at no cost to their employees. Now they are to cheap to pay for a group plan even Trumps employees are forced to take Obamacare because Trump is to cheap to provide insurance for his employees!
8 | Layla Chapman | 10154012223660950_10154012260205950 | Too bad that things are only getting harder and worse for middle class can't get medicaid can't afford the overbearing price of the AFFORDABLE health care none of these presidents have to wry about any of this or a finial strain it's disgusting and if anyone thinks that either of our new candidates r gonna help dig us out you are sorely mistaken I feel bad everyday that my children have to suffer and struggle the elderly ect all suffer the homeless pop has gone wayyyy up yet Obama did excalty WHAT for us lol yep EXACTLY NOTHING I'd LOVE run away if  i could any ideas hahahaha

11 | Bonnie Fontenot | 10154012223660950_10154012409920950 | Looking into it I find it's up to state legislatures and governors who are responsible for rate hikes. Insurance companies have to request it. Isn't it curious this should happen so close to election? And it's not "Obamacare" - it's the Affordable Care Act. Some parties refuse to use the correct name.
12 | Monica La Fuente Ramirez | 10154012223660950_10154012266105950 | not like Hillary cares, she is getting free healthcare because she was First Lady and a Senator, the American people should vote on what kind of free healthcare they get. Like stick her and Bill on medicare or Tricare oh wait wouldn't matter any way they are rich so healthy really isn't a issue they can relate to same for Trump.

13 | John Yaws | 10154012223660950_10154012276780950 | If your voting for Clinton ,please reconsider and look at other candidates, Hillary wants to keep obamacare and it will only get worse

For anyone not registered to vote, please do so.... your opinion will not count if you don't vote. We, as a nation, are at a crossroads. Do we continue to travel down the path the tyrants have taken us? Or do we chart a new course and get our country back again. Trump has to win by a landslide. A "stay at home" vote, a third party vote or, worst of all, a vote for Hillary, is sending America into the abyss. FOREVER..Trump might be loud, obnoxious and offensive, but I believe he has risen, by God, to give us one last chance..This IS OUR REVOLUTION! .. Please, let your voice be heard. For our children and grandchildren......

People don't care, they don't want change, they just want female power not equality. They have bought into the we can't handle the words Trump said but are okay with killing babies, poor school performance, and letting special interest run the country.The things people put as important issues required to run a country.
18 | Rose Helisek Hitchman | 10154012223660950_10154012334435950 | That moment when you are in between and now your have to pay twice as much for your health insurance than your mortgage.   That moment when you worked 70 hours a week for 40+ years and the government comes in and takes your money.   That moment when you cannot afford to help your own children because you have to pay for everyone else's children, the ones who come across the border from other countries.   That moment when you want the democrats, who alone voted this in, to completely pay for it.   That is the moment I am pissed about.
19 | Brenda Moore Stickney | 10154012223660950_10154012421630950 | The stakes this year are very, very high. The socialist machine has been gearing up for a takeover of America for the past fifty years. They’ve bought all the TV news organizations, all of the daily and weekly newspapers and magazines across the country. They’ve positioned liberal professors in all of the colleges, and left wing teachers in the high schools. Now we find that George Soros, the Socialist billionaire and Clinton supporter, even “owns” the voting machines! A patriotic man like Donald Trump, even with all of his money, can’t compete with this massive corruption. It’s been too long in the making. He can’t compete unless the truth be told. The internet may be our last hope, and the Fox Business cable news channel (for now).Hillary was promised she would win before this election began. Isn’t it strange that she is not  trying very hard to campaign? And, that no one is showing up to her events? Why there are few Hillary yard signs? She was promised the Presidency and they will deliver it, never mind what the “sheeple" want. If you’ve been watching the mainstream news or not following the news at all, you are their puppet. Frightening things are happening out there that you don’t even know about. Leaked emails have been surfacing, that are unbelievably incriminating, and yet the mainstream media pooh-poohs or ignores them. Very, very scary. She has repeatedly violated many federal codes and laws, yet nothing is done, it is covered up. Right wing conspiracy, they say, lies. But now, angry FBI agents are leaking incriminating emails, in protest of their boss ignoring her serious misdeeds. It is not Russia. It is frustrated people with information, who see the disgusting lies being told, who care deeply about America and the fraud being perpetrated on the American people. It is truly sickening that no one listens. If an “ordinary civilian Clinton” can do whatever she wants and nothing happens, wait until she is President! Very scary. It is then called a dictatorship. Obama has already begun some of the tactics. “Executive Orders” are signed every time Congress won’t “cooperate” with what he thinks should be done. The courts have stricken down his “orders” yet he continues to sign them. It’s an expensive and dangerous game the taxpayers are funding.Imagine that sort of disregard for our checks and balances, our Constitution, continuing for four more years. I can’t imagine what America will look like…. it is truly heartbreaking. The goal is to change the country from a free Republic, completely transforming America by changing its core, its people. Obama promised it, and you voted for it. Much of the rest of the world is understandably jealous of the greatness of the USA, the newcomer to the world, and they plan to have it for themselves, eventually. We are on that war path, though it may be neatly accomplished this time without firing a shot, a job from within. Vote for her and you will advance it along quite nicely.I implore you…. to seek the truth, make an informed decision. Educate yourself with anything and everything you can find out about your candidate. Knowing all that I know, it seems impossible for anyone to vote for such a corrupt and dangerous person. Remember, you don’t know what you don’t know. Please, inform yourself. Know. Don’t be their puppet.

Donald Trump did not raise your taxes. Donald Trump did not quadruple the price of food. Trump is not stirring a race war. Trump did not leave any US soldiers in Benghazi to be slaughtered and desecrated by Muslims. Trump did not send the US Navy to fight for Syrian Al-Qaeda. Trump did not arm ISIS and systematically exterminate Christians throughout the Middle East. Trump did not betray Israel. Trump did not provide financing and technology to Iran's nuclear weapons program. Trump did not give our military secrets to China. Trump did not remove our nuclear missile shield in Poland at the behest of Russia. Trump did not shrivel our military, and betray our veterans. Trump did not cripple our economy. Trump did not increase our debt to 20 trillion dollars. Trump did not ruin our credit, twice. Trump did not double African American unemployment. Trump did not increase welfare to a record level for eight years. Trump did not sign a law making it legal to execute, and imprison Americans. Trump did not set free all of terrorists in Guantanamo bay. Trump did not steal your rights, violate US Constitutional law, or commit treason, hundreds of times.

16 | Sherry Barbour Bell | 10154012184440950_10154012253020950 | Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's team actually planned as far back as February to "swift boat" Donald Trump. (AP Photo/Mary Altaffer)Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's team actually planned as far back as February to "swift boat" Donald Trump. Despite claiming her campaign would "go high" in response to personal attacks from GOP nominee Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton's team actually planned as far back as February to go low when the time came.In one of the illegally obtained emails from WikiLeaks, Joel Johnson, managing director of a political consulting firm, asked Clinton's communications director about creating a "Trump swift boat project" to begin attacking the GOP candidate after the primaries."I know you can't look past Bernie and March primaries — but who is in charge of the Trump swift boat project?" Johnson asked Clinton Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri. "Needs to be ready, funded and unleashed when we decide – but not a half assed scramble."To "swift boat" someone means to target them with personal attacks that may be unfair or untrue. The term originated in 2004, after a group calling themselves "Swift Boat Veterans for Truth" began telling stories that contradicted then presidential candidate John Kerry's claims about his time in the military.Palmieri responded to Johnson sarcastically."Gee. Thanks, Joel. We thought we could half-ass it," she said. "Let's discuss."Johnson fired back several hours later: "Sorry. I've been behind too many curtains in my day …"During the second presidential debate, Clinton quoted Michelle Obama as saying "When they go low, you go high." There's that, and then there's the real world ...

While reluctant at first to draw too much attention to her gender, Hillary Clinton has now made women's issues a key part of her campaign.

1 | Appiah Julius Kechkare | 10154012079850950_10154012086530950 | I'm not an American but I'd like to say American media houses are real shit. All they do is to fight Trump. Why can't you give everyone a fair ground. I'm tired of this. Lemme unlike the pages. 👎👎👎
2 | Thelma Bertie | 10154012079850950_10154012081030950 | LMAO, We no longer have real democracy or media sources in America, this election has brought to light so much, Hillary has been shown to have lied to the FBI 39 times and crickets, she's been caught on tape selling out Americans to Wall Street and crickets. You obviously don't realize what you've done, Hillary, people take voting seriously and you basically mocked them, showing them it doesn't matter while continuing to expect them to pay income taxes and report for jury duty. We need to take our country back. Our jobs are being taken away. Our healthcare is too expensive. Mine is $600/month now (AND RISING!). My car insurance is still $25 per month (from Insurance Panda), but who knows when our increasingly socialist government will come in and muddle that up? Things are getting more and more expensive as it is. Can we really afford to support the world’s homeless (refugees)?People aren't stupid, you really think anyone's going to believe Hillary legitimately can win or allow her to be president? Good luck with that come November 9th\
3 | Steve Yack | 10154012079850950_10154012103775950 | By taking millions of campaign contributions from countries that treat women like dogs. Yeah what a woman's rights advocate.
4 | Jaffery Sayye | 10154012079850950_10154012085785950 | Just Saying...,remember To vote!!!!  In defense of Donald Trump : Try to keep this in mind, Donald Trump did not steal your money. Donald Trump did not raise your taxes. Donald Trump did not quadruple the price of food. Trump is not stirring a race war. Trump did not leave any US soldiers in Benghazi to be slaughtered and desecrated by Muslims. Trump did not send the US Navy to fight for Syrian Al-Qaeda. Trump did not arm ISIS and systematically exterminate Christians throughout the Middle East. Trump did not betray Israel. Trump did not provide financing and technology to Iran's nuclear weapons program. Trump did not give our military secrets to China. Trump did not remove our nuclear missile shield in Poland at the behest of Russia. Trump did not shrivel our military, and betray our veterans. Trump did not cripple our economy. Trump did not increase our debt to 20 trillion dollars. Trump did not ruin our credit, twice. Trump did not double African American unemployment. Trump did not increase welfare to a record level for eight years. Trump did not sign a law making it legal to execute, and imprison Americans. Trump did not set free all of terrorists in Guantanamo bay. Trump did not steal your rights, violate US Constitutional law, or commit treason, hundreds of times. Yet Trump is being ripped apart in the news, non stop. Barrack Hussein Obama, Hillary Clinton and the criminals occupying our government, are not. The media is the Democratic Party. Save our culture. Save our country, don't put that woman in office, VOTE DONALD TRUMP!!!!
5 | Jarrod Fry | 10154012079850950_10154012128115950 | She doesn't care about women or black folks or white folks or asians or Mexicans or anyone else for that matter. She cares about money, power and stature. That's why she'll say ANYTHING to one person while talking out the side of her mouth to another. She's evil.
6 | William J Adkins | 10154012079850950_10154012276045950 | Wikileaks just admitted their source was Democrat whistleblowers who couldnt stand by and allow clintons corruption to continue. It wasn't the foreign hacker/trump works with russia conspiracy hilary has been pushing at all. Why no story on that??
7 | Jerry Henry | 10154012079850950_10154012106355950 | Hillary Clinton:Had a fake Indian at her campaign rally yesterdayIn favor of late term abortionsHad bill's lovers tormented and attackedDefended a guy who raped a 12 year old girl and laughed about itHillary has no business even talking about women's issues
8 | Betty Shuler Benton | 10154012079850950_10154012239960950 | Powerful men have fought against her for over 30 years because they knew she was smarter than most of them and had a work ethic that would leave them in her dust.  She has withstood the most scrutiny and has the most experience of anyone that has ever run for president.  Many men, especially older men, do not like the idea of a female president...but, she has worked hard and deserves the opportunity to show America that she is up to the challenge.  Glad to have cast my early vote for Hillary Clinton
9 | Donna Peterson | 10154012079850950_10154012195195950 | If you are Gay, Why are you voting for Hillary when she wants to bring in thousands of refugees that believe all Gays should be executed?👁⚠If you are Black, Why are you voting for Hillary when she admires Margaret Sanger and defends Planned Parenthood who want to abort as many black babies as possible? Exterminate the black race because they are like "weeds". (Margaret Sanger quote) Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.👁⚠If you are a Christian, Why are you voting for Hillary Clinton when she wrote her Senior thesis on Saul Alinsky who dedicated his book 'Rules for Radicals' to Lucifer (the Devil)? She says he was, and still is her mentor.👁⚠If you are a Veteran, in the Military, or closely related to a Military member, Why are you voting for Hillary when she left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again? They called for help but the help was told to stand down.👁⚠If you have a factory job, Why are you voting for Hillary when she supported TPP? Factory workers are being laid off because jobs are going over seas. Don't forget the deals she's made with china. She also welcomes open borders and illegals to get benefits to be paid with Your tax money.👁⚠If you are poor, Why are you voting for Hillary, when she is supporting Wall street and all the big banks? Big banks keep poor people poor by destroying the poor man's credit by allowing medical bills and collections to affect your credit scores so you can pay higher interest rates than the rich; Taking much of the little money you earn.👁⚠If you are a Woman, how can you vote for Hillary when she has buried all of Bills rape victims under the rug, including that little girl that was raped? Lawyer Hillary defended the rapist, and then she laughed about it later, knowing that he was guilty.If you carry a gun, or believe in the Constitution; How can you vote for Hillary when she wants to eliminate the NRA, Take your guns, and abolish the second Amendment?👁⚠If you breathe, Why would you vote for Hillary when she and the Clinton crime family have left a trail of dead people that did not agree with her, or they knew too much?Who is left? 👁
10 | Jim Latham | 10154012079850950_10154012447255950 | In Hillary Clinton's America the Catholic Religion is "bastardized", Latinos are "needy", Blacks are "underachievers and never-do-wells", Trump supporters are "Deplorable", and Bernie Sanders supporters are "basement dwellers. Her own words; not mine. But hey, you just go right ahead and vote for her sunshine. Validate her hate and division and say it's "simply politics". Simply politics? Right. Whatever it takes for you to sleep well at night.
11 | Mark A. Ballard | 10154012079850950_10154012428785950 | CBS news, I grew up watching CBS along with my Great-grandparents, grandparents, and parents. I always knew that I could depend on you. It would seem now no longer, you have become like the rest. You skew the truth about the election to show what you want to.  You overlook the habitual lying of Hillary Clinton and her cronys. Keep showing nothing but disdain for Donald Trump. I once looked to you as reporting true and accurate news and information.I realize that I was in error. You are biased and promote your own agenda. I am starting a boycott against you and your affiliate stations. Who knows, it may actually prove to do some good. You can be replaced.
12 | Stephie Belle | 10154012079850950_10154012127350950 | There's women but then again there's REAL WOMEN. Us real women don't expect a hand out, we don't need Hillary to tell us we are worth something. We don't listen to her lies.
13 | Larry Gatten | 10154012079850950_10154012124645950 | I could be wrong when I make this assessment, but I will make a prediction. There is going to be a shot heard around the world on November 9th morning. It will not be gunfire. It will be a collective groan from the national media and the Liberals in this country who thought Hillary was a likeable person. We shall see.
14 | Karen L North | 10154012079850950_10154012086040950 | get the war-mongers off the dam stage! killary clinton for prison 2016!
15 | Jada Witmer | 10154012079850950_10154012149440950 | I see. So women voters are just suppose to forget that Hillary bullied any woman who spoke about Bill Clintons indiscretions. Women voters are suppose to forget that there is an audio tape of HRC talking about a case of rape that she got the rapists conviction down to a light a sentence and then she laughed about a polygraph test. Sure, HRC is for women. I don't think so. HRCs "woman card" should be revoked and denied because of how she treats other women. I will never vote for her.
16 | Sean Labbe | 10154012079850950_10154012168580950 | Who are you kidding? Hillary has been playing the woman card since the day she announced. Hillary has had 30 years to accomplish her goals and she has done very little. Her no-fly zone in Syria will lead us to a war with Russia and the Media will have played a huge role by herding the American people towards their candidate of choice.
17 | Chris Dessources | 10154012079850950_10154012113780950 | Keep in mind that those voting for Trump are not good people. These are people who would deny refugees a safe harbor; who would refuse a group the right to marry; who see illegal immigrants as nothing more than Mexico's worst, not Mexico's desperate; who would side with the president of an enemy nation rather than their country's president; who believe that facts are nothing more than distractions; who will believe nothing the media says, unless it uplifts their candidate. I keep looking for reasons to vote for Trump instead of Hillary, but his supporters are not a group any moral, patriotic American would want to find themselves a part of. So I'll vote for blue in order to humble these servants of ignorance and immorality. I suggest you do as well.
18 | Tamra Blitch | 10154012079850950_10154012497290950 | Because she knows women will buy her bs, because they honestly think she wants to help them when in reality she is using them to make history and further Obamas agenda.They aren't even putting the safety and education of their children first, they just want a woman in power.Sad!!!
19 | Debbie Lynch | 10154012079850950_10154012269675950 | All she has done her whole campaign is use the women card. Doesn't address the real issues like the economy or homelessness issues people really want to hear about.
20 | Darrin Richards | 10154012079850950_10154012197830950 | Lie..! Hillary from day one has been pandering for votes solely on her gender which is no different than pandering for votes based on your race or nationality and Trump is the bigot racist..? Get the FU€K outta here!!!
21 | Greg Egan | 10154012079850950_10154012459205950 | The Trump supporters I have met and the ones who commented below all aren't voting on the strength of Trumps abilities, but just against Clinton. Moreover, the reasons they cite are exaggerations at best. The problem with America are these looney birds.
22 | Mark Evans | 10154012079850950_10154012171265950 | Where's nprs reporting of Terry McCullough donations to the fbi agent's wife of over 600000 dollars and the fbi decided not to press charges? Where's the report about the undercover-video democrats admitted to bussing around voters in NY? And  flooding them with absentee voting ballets? Where's the report about the unaffordable Care Act that Hillary supports and 60 plus insurancecompany's are pulling out of. And premiums going up 25 to over 100%

25 | William Siders | 10154012079850950_10154012107660950 | wtf... her entire campaign has been crafted around put a vagina in the white house.  Her campaign has done exactly like the news did for Obama, any question of her makes you a sexist pig.

A malfunction on a man-made river caused two people to be ejected from their raft, while two others were caught inside the ride.

1 | Jessica Millikin-Newcomb | 10154012053815950_10154012060210950 | I would assume uneven weight distribution and inexperienced ride operators, along with possibility of lax maintenance checks were in some part to blame.
2 | Joe Bennett | 10154012053815950_10154012076045950 | All I know is that part of the ride is not fast at all. It's the ramp to ascend. Somehow the raft flipped. The ramp is a conveyer belt. Looks like the poor people got stuck between belt under water. Very horrific accident.

People have different interests than corporations.

1 | Laurel Sheridan | 10154012013285950_10154012419410950 | So tragic; thoughts are with the survivors and the families of all the victims. The absence of braking makes me wonder if the driver had a cell phone nearby.......
2 | Karen Justison Rhodes | 10154012013285950_10154012162010950 | The truck shouldn't have been going that slow! We're there warning lights and flaggers out? Don't blame the dead bus driver seems like he was going a normal speed limit unlike the truck going 5 mph!!!

That is a FACT so stop trying to DENY, DERAIL and LIE your way out of this!They are also LYING by saying that these BOMBSHELL videos coming from Project Veritas Action exposing the absolute criminal activity from the crooked Clinton campaign, the DNC and their gang thugs are somehow magically "edited" and should not be taken as credible and truth....which is also just a big steaming pile of BULLSHIT!The bottom line is....these crooks have been caught red handed and it's a criminal act of treason what they are doing to our Country!WikiLeaks Updates Project Veritas Actionhttps://www.facebook.com/consumeitall/videos/634005273421716/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kypl1MYuKDY

This "disgruntled employee" poured cleaner used for windows and bathrooms into the coffee machine, police say.

1 | Lucey Martinez | 10154011970550950_10154012285275950 | Should be charged with attempted murderer,I don't think anyone who continuously dose that is intending for Someone to get sick. They are trying to poison.This woman tired killing several people
2 | Greg Nisall | 10154011970550950_10154011973230950 | This is why you should always be nice to the cleaning lady!
3 | Bruce Augustine | 10154011970550950_10154012043355950 | A few years ago, I caught a convenient store clerk, adding sugar to the coffee, he was ready to brew.... many of his customers were diabetic.
4 | Gerald Broadwater | 10154011970550950_10154012395150950 | This is what you get for hiring illegal immigrants before actual Americans... The company should be held accountable for all injuries.
5 | Joe Grasso | 10154011970550950_10154012451250950 | The article refers to a "coffee machine", but gives no detail. If it were a large electric perk, then it would be quite plausible that this was a terrible, unintentional accident.  Obviously, this would not be the safest method to clean a coffee urn, but if done carefully and washed well, it could be very efficient.   I hope they follow-up on this story, because it seems more like an unintentional mistake being overly sensationalized.
6 | Gary Doan | 10154011970550950_10154012287645950 | I have given Democrats far too much credit in the past. Everyone should realize the press is biased, but most Democrats deny it. I has assumed that some people were either naive or brainwashed, but now I'm starting to believe they appreciate and support our biased corrupt media. There no way bias is not noticeable at this point in time and I'm an deeply ashamed of all Democrats. An Ex-Democrat.
7 | Dante Gelato Ramirez | 10154011970550950_10154012001880950 | Was it maliciously or did she really mean to clean the coffe maker using cleaning agents?Vinegar would have worked without killing anyone.
8 | Monica Carballo | 10154011970550950_10154012126185950 | She was probably born here you bunch of racists . Just because she looks hispanic doesn't mean she is illegal .   RACISM AT ITS GREATEST
9 | Joy Juaneza | 10154011970550950_10154011998470950 | Verify her immigration status. If she's found guilty and is here illegally, deport her after she's served her sentence.
10 | Paul Stama | 10154011970550950_10154012085535950 | So we can add her to the list of illegals that are criminals participating in criminal acts hurting law abiding American citizens.

14 | Marquan Jones | 10154011970550950_10154011996140950 | I always assume people do stuff like that anyways so I would never drink from a community coffee pot

1 | Paul Laino | 10154011942880950_10154011947360950 | I don't know the whole story but I'm so glad the children survived. I can't imagine the horror the kids went through. :-(
2 | Kimberly May | 10154011942880950_10154011967180950 | If u want to take ur life that's one thing. But for u to try to take ur babies along with u that's a POS. The kids didn't ask to be here nor did they ask for ur stupid ass to try to take their life's. Thank u God for saving these babies.
3 | Kerry Stallmer | 10154011942880950_10154011961835950 | Angels watching over those beautiful children. They will do great things, they are our future.❤️heal young ones. You have a lifetime to make memories.
4 | Benjamin Smith | 10154011942880950_10154011955095950 | Kids lived he died seems like justice has been served! People really need to STOP taking the cowards way out! Life is a bitch but death is not the only option! We are all masters of our own fate! If they would just put  in as much effort making changes all will work out in the end!
5 | Samantha Knight | 10154011942880950_10154012054420950 | I find it interesting that the vast majority of self proclaimed Christians on this thread are condemning the father and calling him horrible names rather than wondering why he did what he did. Did the medical system fail him? Did he have a history of mental illness yet was still permitted to be alone with his children? Did he reach out for help and was denied? Did the mother know he was suicidal and not reach out for help or take her children and herself out of the equation?  Etc etc etc. Too many unanswered questions to pass judgment. Obviously what he did was horrific and I'm grateful the children survived. That being said, those children would be much better off growing up with a mentally healthy father than living with this devastation.
6 | Natasha Reid | 10154011942880950_10154012124810950 | That is really crazy, and a miracle at the same time. I cannot judge the father because I have never walked in his shoes. Father God this whole world needs healing. Every day it's a catastrophe somewhere. Please stay prayed up people.
7 | Elaine Shona | 10154011942880950_10154012010215950 | Selfish man! It's not uncommon for men too do that. Regardless of what's going on in the relationship between the parents the children have nothing too do with it! But I've often said in the past the only way my ex could of hurt me was hurting our children. God Forgive any man who takes the children away from their mum too punish her cause they are no longer together. Thankfully in this case the children survived....
8 | Jenny Stanley | 10154011942880950_10154012340665950 | I'm glad the children survived. And as awful as it sounds, it's better he is dead. I say that only because this guy would have wreaked havoc with their lives for many years, maybe even succeeded, eventually, in ending all their lives. Now they don't have to spend their lives looking over their shoulder. Get some play therapy for these children please.
9 | Shawn Pandolfi | 10154011942880950_10154012390615950 | Check your story. I doubt the two children were taking to St. Joseph's Wayne Hospital, which is a small community hospital and does not have the capability to handle trauma patients. I am willing or bet they were transported to a trauma center such as St. Joseph's Regional Medical Center in Paterson which is a trauma center.
10 | Lasonya R Wilson | 10154011942880950_10154011984245950 | I'm so glad those kids are safe. If you're going to kill yourself then do it ,but don't  try to kill anyone else especially your children. Their innocent. I bet they were terrified.
11 | Peggy Elliott Poenisch | 10154011942880950_10154012228230950 | Thank God the children survived.  I also have no problem feeling good that the father is dead.  If he was willing to take his childrens lives, then he wasn't a decent human in the first place.
12 | Samantha Lee Jenkins | 10154011942880950_10154012172940950 | Awesome job killing himself and the innocent boys surviving. Makes me sick with these grown ass ppl wanting to take their lives and these kids along with them, when their not just killing them period.
13 | Ginny Aybar-Flores | 10154011942880950_10154012523175950 | No matter how bad your life is you never should take your life and try to take others with you. Thank God the cildren are alive but am sure this will haunt the older one forever.
14 | Erin Saucida | 10154011942880950_10154011954065950 | I'm not religious but I think those babies definitely had their guardian angels by them. The dad was a coward. 😡😡
15 | Kathryn Dunn | 10154011942880950_10154012210380950 | The boys are young, maybe they won't remember all this clearly and they can go on with their lives peacefully with their mommy.
16 | Harley Featherstone | 10154011942880950_10154012030350950 | What could have been so bad Everyday we don't wake up happy it's called life.Be thankful of what you have .Always somebody is worse off.

Thank God for Donald Trump his landslide victory November 8 Will begin to cleaning out of the evil corrupt system.
4 | Deborah Barber | 10154011909900950_10154011959860950 | Obamacare is rising, NO LIE!!! And if you did not get any insurance 2nd year on income tax your penalty will be much larger and next year even larger. Yeah go ahead vote for Hillary,...that's another 4 years of Communist Obama. My son has no insurance and has not had to go to the doctor at all this year. Why would he pay $300.00 a month for something he doesn't use.

The problem is there have been complaints of headaches; of course there could be several reasons for that side effect.
11 | Christal Elerick-Miller | 10154011909900950_10154012179490950 | Seriously over Obama. His Obamacare sucks. He is disgraceful. He plays gold while our American families fight floods. He isn't a leader. He has bowed to every nation and continued to watch the inner cities decline and let jobs walk across the border while letting others walk in and receive better care for free here. One illegal special needs child cost the state over $3,000 a month and he has done nothing to prevent this or correct the problem
12 | John Maguire | 10154011909900950_10154012107980950 | Here we go again, the worst President since James Buchanan acting like he did something special!!

He went to Iran to see his mother who has Alzheimers. Iran won't recognize his dual citizenship and won't allow him access to help from the consulate. He was convicted by Iran as a spy, because he had FB posts that supported a protest against an Iranian election.

10 | Marc Langsam | 10154011856140950_10154012238510950 | Donald Trump did not steal your money. Donald Trump did not raise your taxes. Donald Trump did not quadruple the price of food. Trump is not stirring a race war. Trump did not leave any US soldiers in Benghazi to be slaughtered and desecrated by Muslims. Trump did not send the US Navy to fight for Syrian Al-Qaeda. Trump did not arm ISIS and systematically exterminate Christians throughout the Middle East. Trump did not betray Israel. Trump did not provide financing and technology to Iran's nuclear weapons program. Trump did not give our military secrets to China. Trump did not remove our nuclear missile shield in Poland at the behest of Russia. Trump did not shrivel our military, and betray our veterans. Trump did not cripple our economy. Trump did not increase our debt to 20 trillion dollars. Trump did not ruin our credit, twice. Trump did not double African American unemployment. Trump did not increase welfare to a record level for eight years. Trump did not sign a law making it legal to execute, and imprison Americans. Trump did not set free all of terrorists in Guantanamo bay. Trump did not grant amnesty to millions of people living here illegally and then offer them your social security retirement funds, Trump did not betray veterans or reduce their promised benefits, Trump did not steal your rights, violate US Constitutional law, or commit treason, hundreds of times.

2 | Jimmie Ortego | 10154011822385950_10154011842825950 | What about the wiki leaks story? Why is there almost no mention of it on this network? Do your job journalists
3 | Jim Gavin | 10154011822385950_10154011823610950 | I don't care if you are a republican, democrat, or independent....the CORRUPTION in The Clinton Camp AND within OBAMA's government should make you LIVID, ANGRY & PISSED OFF!!! They have broken laws, rigged elections, bought out the media & have taken over our government & made it more of a communist, dictatorship!!! I am heartbroken that so many people would rather stay ignorant to the truth and blindly follow Hilary and not read ONE DAMN EMAIL that was leaked!!! How can you love America & continue to support a woman who has sold our country out?!? HOW?!?
4 | Christopher Swaim | 10154011822385950_10154011860905950 | If you vote for Hillary than you are an accessory to mass murder.Once the first shots are fired between U.S and Russian forces (something Clinton is aching for) I hope you hold your families close and pray, because you and all those you love will be close to death. And for you blacks who love Hillary Clinton and happen to live in urban areas...guess what...you'll be among the first to perish. If you're too ignorant to see that she's exploiting your skin color and plight for votes, at least recognize that her ascent to the Presidency will probably mean a nuclear war with Russia.
5 | James Ray | 10154011822385950_10154011851845950 | Souls to polls for the Black community? Really? The implication that Independents, Republicans, Whites, Asians, Latinos and every other skin color/race besides Black doesn't have a soul?!? Only someone as evil as a Clinton would swing that stick and call it a new strategy. LOL.More proof just how evil the Clinton-pushers are... inside and out.No surprise there are ZERO pro-Clinton signs in front of any homes in this area and no Pro-Clinton bumper stickers on cars either. Seen a few anti-Clinton bumper stickers and several pro-Sanders and pro-Trump signs and bumper stickers though.
6 | David Lawler | 10154011822385950_10154011858260950 | Obama hasn't done $hit for ANY of us, except weaken this country! I had "hope" his "change" would be a good one. I'm so sorry to everyone for voting for him the first time.

Come on 'History of the Democratic party' by Dinesh D'souza. A must see! The Democratic party went from a party of slavery to the party of enslavement, same outcome different approach. They did LBJ proud. Look it up.

Before pressing the cast ballot button, I scanned to make sure all I had voted for appeared in the final list. All did EXCEPT my choice for President. I called the helper and she was puzzled. The judge came and she was also puzzled. I had to go back to page 1, indicate straight party ticket and then scroll down to my Presidential candidate and click on that name. After that, the final ballot appeared as I wanted and then I cast my ballot.My advice: Double check your ballot before you press the final cast ballot button."Came from a voter in the Houston area...No dems are complaining...pay attention people...voter fraud is out en force!We are getting record numbers of voters this year...Texas is a red state so most are repubs!

9 | Darrin Richards | 10154011822385950_10154011995115950 | Trump will deliver on his promises Hillary is pandering the blacks for votes with a total false narrative of racism which only further divides our community. It's a financial fact the poorest black communities have been run for decades by Democratic mayors and governors yet for some reason black voters fall for the same democratic PANDERING that keeps them POOR year after year after year. Break the voting cycle of doom and poverty. Trump will not forget the black voter but you can bet Clinton will have amnesia
10 | Charles R. Jones | 10154011822385950_10154011927745950 | Can we all just respect each other, we do not have to vote for the same person. this race has made a lot of so called good friends fight an not be friends any more. god loves us all no matter who we are voting for,. we do not have to agree , but we are all in this together weather you like it or not. i myself will be voting for mr. trump. just please get out an vote. do not wast your vote by not voting. god bless us all.

These same conditions, or most of them, at least, can also be caused by underlying fungal complications, for instance.)This includes...1) The ALS/PD/AD complex outbreak at Kii.2) The ALS/PD/AD complex outbreak at Guam.3) The ALS epidemic afflicting Gulf War Veterans. 4) The HD epidemic of Lake Maracaibo5) The MS outbreak of Faroe Islands6) The MS outbreak of Key West (Florida).7) The MS outbreak of El Paso (Texas).8) The MS outbreak of Rochester (New York).9) The MS outbreak of Galion (Ohio).10) The MS outbreak of DePue (Illinois).11) The CJD outbreak of Slovakia.#NoJoke#SpreadTruth

They let the democrats through the unions take over education. For 12 to 16 years kids spend more time in school then with parents learning liberal bullshit. In 1995 54 percent of high school graduates identified as democrats. I think Newt Gingrich said over 80 percent today do so...holy crap...wait until the next election. Now we are are turning medical over to the government. They want to put a chip in you they will be able to force you to..and doubt sit back and say like gun owners you will have to pry the gun from my hands...bullshit..you can't even stand up and fight in this election you pussies. You will lay down and surrender. Get off your ass and get our schools back...get off ass and march on Washington..get off your ass and boycott the liberal media...oh, but I must watch the View...by if consrvatives boycotted the liberal media, say CNN for just one month they would change damn fast or go out of busness.

Nearly 3 million youth players participate in tackle football programs across the United States.

1 | Kevin Jackson | 10154011522625950_10154011528695950 | I watched one news cast from cbs and my brain was negatively impacted! Try reporting the news! Keep your far left opinions to yourselves!
2 | Jeff Olsen | 10154011522625950_10154012368955950 | And so can one fall off a skateboard, bicycle, scooter, swing set, snow board etc etc etc. Or god forbid an accident while driving with mom or dad when they are texting, talking, eating or scolding. Walking out the front door is a risk. Live your life, don't fear it... 👍
3 | Timothy Ellison | 10154011522625950_10154012324450950 | Yep that's good reporting. thanks for letting us know that there is a risk involved in playing tackle football. Just like people that skydive. There's a chance you might crash into something or your shoot won't open and you could die. I just covered that story for them they don't have to do that one. LOL. Oh and there's a chance you might bleed if you are a MMA a fighter.
4 | Zippy Bippy | 10154011522625950_10154011686390950 | More likely weed and texting cause worse brain damage in their generation....

7 | Gloria Schmitz | 10154011522625950_10154012041255950 | well parents who believe all this crap,, just ask your son if he'd rather play football or be a ballerina?
8 | Marc Langsam | 10154011522625950_10154012240885950 | And of course stop COLINizing sports with nothing but KRAPernick

10 | Adam Chapman | 10154011522625950_10154012064875950 | Ban everything!  Hell the game already has been ruined by these targeting and can't breath on the quarterback rules.  Ban walking out your front door, as there is a chance you just may get hit with flying debris from outer space.

5 | Roy Mattson | 10154011413095950_10154011598520950 | Proof Hillary and DNC rigs the election...Sanders charged the DNC with this..it came out Hillary was also involved...he gets paid off and he sells out...Trump says the same thing and all the media says he in unpatriotic. Abc, NBC, CBS, MSNBC, never says anything, anything good about trump...never in the history of president elections has that happened. Media feed Hillary questions, works with her on articles, quotes...this is RIGGING...companies spend billion on advertising knowing if you tell enough people long enough something many will believe it if it is true or not. When you get all the liberal media pounding one message...it is all but unbeatable. And suing those women are important..in a lawsuit it will come out who put them up to this, or he is guilty.

But there is an easy way to prevent it.

No matter how smart these phones are, it still vulnerable to hacks, plus these providers are making a killing off insurance and deductibles,  the consumers lose out more while the phone companies cash in! Because those lost/stolen phones still need a network for it to work! And people still need a cell phone for everyday use...  its a huge catch 22 and the biggest con of the century!
2 | Emius George | 10154011309315950_10154011316625950 | You Late!! It's sad people are now finding this out now CBS. Turn up the heat with that so called journalism. Born 1976 with what Cell phone?!

6 | Kimberly Rodriguez | 10154011309315950_10154011516280950 | This isn't newly discovered and it isn't a glitch.  It's intentional.  It allows YOU to use Siri without unlocking your phone first.  I thought everyone already knew about this.  You have been able to do this for years.  They TOLD us about it.  You can ask Siri what she does and she will tell you she does this.  Or...you know...fear mongering is fun too.

It's been 108 years without a title, but some fans believe the Cubs and history are perfectly aligned.

1 | Justin McCowan | 10154011226280950_10154011697240950 | I've got a plaque I bought from an antique shop a few years ago that featured the Cubs. Had to buy it, but forgot I had it in a closet! Might need to pull it out and hang it up! On the other hand, Cleveland had a minor league team associated with them here, called the Kinston Indians, but they left town 5 years ago, but we've now got the Texas Rangers working with our city to bring a minor league team back. Last time the Cleveland Indians won, that was the year before they built our Grainger Stadium in 1949!
2 | Scott Brown | 10154011226280950_10154012492710950 | Cubs fans don't deserve a world series championship for what they did to Steve Bartman that night and afterwards with all the death threats

1 | Terri Hemker | 10154011139050950_10154011231740950 | I get really sick of people who whine because, every now and then, you post something that is uplifting and heartwarming even if not earth-shattering news. If they don't like it, they don't have to read it and they can always go to a different page. They just want to have something to bitch about or to yak about politics 24/7. Some of us actually have a real life.
2 | Steve Brown | 10154011139050950_10154011142065950 | Aw that's nice! Now that he's ok you should post more on Hillary's corruption and the emails leaking showing how corrupt she is!!!!! Btw. DON'T LET MAINSTREAM MEDIA FOOL YOU WITH THE POLLS.   Here are the 3 Daily Tracking Polls that have been almost perfectly in sync almost every day. IBD was most accurate in 2012. These are the most recent:IBD/TIPP Daily Tracking PollSundayTrump 43%Clinton 41%LA Times Daily Tracking Poll…SundayTrump 44.4%Clinton 44.1%Rasmussen Daily Tracking PollFridayTrump 42%Clinton 40%Average– Trump +1.43Once again, Trump was proven right about the biased media and the rigged polls. We have long known that the media was in the tank for the Democrats, but the many revelations in the WikiLeaks email releases have confirmed it.

The Iraqi military had liberated Hamdaniya, which used to be a Christian town of 50,000 people. Now, it is shattered and deserted.

1 | Chris McCoy | 10154011025615950_10154011216740950 | Thanks to Hillary and Obama Christians have been decimated in a land where it all started. They meant to do it. Remember that! Obama is by definition the Anti Christ
2 | Ronald Mallow | 10154011025615950_10154011157730950 | Yeah, when the president tells them a week ahead of time that we're coming...they just might have time to prepare hmmmm. Oh yeah, and get all of their leaders out

4 | Roy Mattson | 10154011025615950_10154011030180950 | Proof Hillary and DNC rigs the election...Sanders charged the DNC with this..it came out Hillary was also involved...he gets paid off and he sells out...Trump says the same thing and all the media says he in unpatriotic. Abc, NBC, CBS, MSNBC, never says anything, anything good about trump...never in the history of president elections has that happened. Media feed Hillary questions, works with her on articles, quotes...this is RIGGING...companies spend billion on advertising knowing if you tell enough people long enough something many will believe it if it is true or not. When you get all the liberal media pounding one message...it is all but unbeatable. And suing those women are important..in a lawsuit it will come out who put them up to this, or he is guilty. By he way..Wikileaks shows DNC pays a staff to post good things about Hillary on FB.
