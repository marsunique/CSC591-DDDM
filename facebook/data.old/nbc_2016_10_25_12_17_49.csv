Their children died tragically on the field. Now they're fighting to make sure other parents don't have to experience the same loss.

1 | Where there is love there is life | 1546207672065924_1546218058731552 | Don't define her by the way she looks or the clothes she wears. Her beauty is far greater than     what meets the eye. Look at her heart and the river of love that flows from within her. Adore her for being the goddess she is. Fall in love with her soul and she will guide you to understand the sacred ways of your heart.

Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey still won't answer the Trump question.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Linda Clark | 1546180038735354_1546185608734797 | there is a reason why curtains are on the ballot booths....our votes are done in secrecy ...and should not be a basis on how any one should vote for a candidate....he has the right to not tell anyone who he will or will not vote for..
2 | Tim Stangl | 1546180038735354_1546192598734098 | Donald Trump Facebook has over 11 million likes Hillary Clinton Facebook has just over 7 million likes. By this logic Trump should win easy. But then you have to account for it being hard for all the dead voters that were dead before facebook was around so it could be a close election.
3 | Susan Theresa Ray | 1546180038735354_1546181098735248 | This guy is a weenie, like most Republicans who are seeking reelection. Why won't they just do the right thing? They just can't. Slugs, all!
4 | Pam S Rogers | 1546180038735354_1546207718732586 | Well...Trump never answers questions either...he just mumbles and stumbles around them and repeats the same words over and over never really answering , but in his feeble mind he thinks he is.
5 | Leslie Sloss | 1546180038735354_1546216742065017 | Trump will do what Trump does. He has divided and conquered the GOP. Trump has promoted sexual assault on women with his lewd comments to Billy Bush. Trump has mocked the disabled. Trump has insulted race after race. Trump has consulted with HIMSELF on military issues and watched shows for foreign polilcy advice. Trump has accused Hillary of being crooked and YET there are accusations of him doing some of the same things he has accused her of doing. Everything Trump is accused of, he is a master of spinning it onto Hillary. Just do a little serious research on all of this. I'm not posting this to argue and I won't argue. These are just some of the truths about Trump and his run for presidency. He is tiresome, boring and will fade into the night eventually. I am an independent voter, by the way, who quickly turned my back when Trump mocked that disabled reporter. That in itself was enough for me. It's right on video. All of his messes are either on audio or video and he STILL denies these things. The wikileaks, promoted by a hack from Russia, has shown no smoking guns. It was reported that Trump was informed that Russia was behind the leaks and Trump still denied it. He doesn't question that a foreign entity hacked into our system. In fact, he asks them to find more of Hillary's emails. That didn't surprise me because Trump and Pence both praise Putin. That is not patriotic to me. Then the Associated Press posted a story, 11/22/14 about the GOP, republican run house, at the time, had found no wrongdoing in the Obama Administration in Benghazi, during their investigation. And after 11 hours of grueling testimony from Hillary last year, still, no criminal charges. After all this is said and done, like I said, Trump mocking that disabled reporter was all it took for me to realize where Trump's heart was. After praising Putin, I realized, for myself, where I feel his allegiance lies. He has tried to divide this country by saying he will only accept the election results if he "wins". Again, that is not patriotic. In fact, it sounds like a bully tactic to get my vote. No thanks. I think, in fact I know, my vote will go to Hillary. I know she is not perfect. For me, better, by far, than the alternative.
6 | Philip Booth | 1546180038735354_1546199182066773 | Important announcement: Because of the high voter turnout expected, Obama has set aside a special Democrats-only voting day. Dems, don't forget to vote on Nov. 9. Thanks, Obama.
7 | Rick Buck | 1546180038735354_1546202638733094 | We need these artful dodgers in Congress OUT.Trump has one thing right with a type of term limit to clean up the muke (though I am.sure it is not HIS idea).But must make sense so they will be forved to vote for it.....serve 2 terms,must sit one out then allow again.Get rid of the bought and paid for folks and put in fresh minds to work for US.
8 | John Mathew | 1546180038735354_1546186802068011 | NBC, can we talk about real issues Americans facing??? Talk about Obama health care premium increase, Talk about our social security fund destroyed by distributing the wealth around to illegal immigrantts and isis infiltrated syrian refugees, talk about our borders, talk about our national debt reached 20 trillion, talk about how Clinton going to take away my hard earned property after my death with 65% death tax. Please let us have another debate here.
9 | Sharon Myers | 1546180038735354_1546182448735113 | McGinty still won't answer the DEP question which, as a citizen of PA, I think is more important than who her opponent plans to support as president.
10 | M Hilal Arfeen | 1546180038735354_1546182288735129 | No one want to answer mental trump who's politics based on mocking everyone and also racism.Donald trump knew that he will be lose election after badly exposed in front of nation.Mental trump should go to mental hospital after humiliation in the politics
11 | Cheryl Brown Drabek | 1546180038735354_1546200872066604 | Well, given that 53% of the voters in Penn are women and the other 47% have mothers, sisters, wives, daughters, Pat Toomey has doomed his own election with his silence for the 100% of people living in Pennsylvania.
12 | Gary Doan | 1546180038735354_1546180308735327 | I have given Democrats far too much credit in the past. Everyone should realize the press is biased, but most Democrats deny it. I had assumed that some people were either naive or brainwashed, but now I'm starting to believe they appreciate and support our biased corrupt media. There no way bias is not noticeable at this point in time and I'm an deeply ashamed of all Democrats. - An Ex-Democrat.
13 | Bob Magee | 1546180038735354_1546213988731959 | They should have kept asking Toomey "Will you repudiate Trump...yes or no"? and keep repeating the question until he answered.
14 | Ali Tarrat | 1546180038735354_1546215702065121 | NBC News is behaving like #NastyHillary. Who the heck is this Toomey guy, and who cares? Honestly, Republican Senators or Congressmen running for election are going to be smart about endorsing Trump.... Why do you want them to make mistakes? lol. Seems a bit biased. If Trump wins, all is good, if Trump loses, they will probably lose, too.... The rigged question is - Why is a Presidential Election happening at the same time? That should be changed. That way politicians can be real...... I know, right - how terrible.
15 | Catherine Schoch | 1546180038735354_1546207568732601 | I live in Pa. Just remember Toomey voted against our military to give them raises,during the Bush years he went against the middle class and voted to help himself (Did you know he owned a bank) he stated woman and doctors need to be punished if they make the decision to have an abortion. We need to vote him out
16 | Courtney Lynn | 1546180038735354_1546180765401948 | As a Pa resident, all I have to say to Toomey is, "Bye, Felicia."
17 | Mark Mun | 1546180038735354_1546182472068444 | Tim Kaine just had a rally in florida, and only 30 people showed up!!!But hey! Trump said mean things.
18 | Allan Tatatoapik | 1546180038735354_1546206378732720 | I would ignore trump in all shapes and forms too Toomey! lmao
19 | Johnny Grigsby | 1546180038735354_1546182308735127 | If he hasn't got the spine to do the right thing he has no business being in the senate.
20 | Mike Arienti | 1546180038735354_1546192508734107 | Hillary still won't answer the Benghazi question or the email question.
21 | Jeff Mcmahan | 1546180038735354_1546182412068450 | Donald Trump is in the middle of destroying the Republican Party. Everyone should just step back and enjoy the show. These Republicans cannot defend the indefensible. But it sure is fun watching them try! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
22 | Joseph Stampone | 1546180038735354_1546200525399972 | Wake-up you moron ; are you that stupid to support Trump rather than say nothing about a liar,,murderer,,thief,,pay for play -et. etc. etc. ; How dumb can you be !!!
23 | JoLynn Groft Cottle | 1546180038735354_1546201042066587 | He got booed so bad in the last debate. He has no chance
24 | Patrick Edgington | 1546180038735354_1546218498731508 | Wikileaks just proved that Obama knew about Hillary Clinton's private email server cover up
25 | Mike Jarrett | 1546180038735354_1546184412068250 | I have been a Republican for 50 years but no more . It seems like they want to give this election away . They do not listen to us and do what they  want . Going independent from now on .

The woman known only as "Jackie" who's at the center of a discredited Rolling Stone article said in a taped deposition that she told the truth about being gang raped at the University of Virginia — as she believed it at the time.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Tim Krahmer | 1546162522070439_1546216975398327 | As she believed it, at the time? So, facts, truth, and reality mean nothing? Wth? How did we get to a point where someone can believe something happened that didn't, and other people enable it?
2 | Deb Walker | 1546162522070439_1546175168735841 | That's why you DON'T believe! You gather and confirm FACTS. Remember facts, kids? Those are the things that are TRUE, until and unless, if and only if,  better information comes along. Which, admittedly, sometimes it does. But honestly, belief just means, "I accept this because I literally do not know any better, and do not intend to know any better, even though I easily could." NO, KIDS. That's BAD. Stop doing it!
3 | David Williams | 1546162522070439_1546168845403140 | NBC here's a story you must of missed.

Donald J. Trump has declared poll numbers showing him trailing Hillary Clinton are "rigged" against him, but we noticed a pattern.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Sean Jamison | 1546083982078293_1546087748744583 | Donald Trump began his political career lying about Barack Obama's birth certificate and since he got away with that for 5 years he realized his supporters are dumb enough to believe anything. His supporters have no problem with him confessing to sexual assault and that had no effect on his base. These are not sane, rationale people.
2 | Austin Mace | 1546083982078293_1546084912078200 | NBC news is a joke and we're all aware of this at this point.
3 | Robert Moore | 1546083982078293_1546091715410853 | You ppl crack me up. Watching your news this morning and not ONE mention of the under cover tapes showing the Democrats engaging in unlawful conduct at Trump rallies. It is true what he says that the system is corrupt and the newscasters do this to save there jobs.
4 | Julie Bursic | 1546083982078293_1546086485411376 | When does NBC plan on hiring a journalist to their staff. Right now you are borrowing HRC campaign people. Post on Monster that you are hiring REAL JOURNALISTS ...must report all sides, be fair and let the viewers decide.
5 | Timothy Harden | 1546083982078293_1546084758744882 | Sore losers start complaining about a rigged game when they know they are going to lose.
6 | David Kauffman | 1546083982078293_1546096538743704 | Bad news for NBC/WSJ poll: IBD/TIPP, who has consistently been more accurate than NBC/WSJ, shows Trump leading Clinton by 2.4 points. Nice try, though, NBC, on influencing the election results.
7 | Bryan Cook | 1546083982078293_1546110262075665 | This article only proves trump right, it appears to all,that almost all media such as NBC  are against  Mr TRUMP, and remember how many years the voter turn out was considered low, I think more people are going to vote this election than any other,but keep in mind ,these people haven't been 'polled',,, I'm a registered democrat, but I will be voteing TRUMP! !
8 | Giancarlo Navarro | 1546083982078293_1546089715411053 | The only thing he's winning is what he was after all along, the world's attention to expand his businesses worldwide. Trump tv is next!Too bad his fanatics are dumb enough to believe that at his age he actually wants the most important job in the world
9 | Deena Lawson | 1546083982078293_1546113815408643 | Of course it's rigged.... don't you know the whole world is out to get him? It can't POSSIBLY be anything he's said or done.  I've never, ever witnessed a human being more full of himself than this clown.
10 | Susan Nelson | 1546083982078293_1546086465411378 | "This is some one else's post! Thought I would share it! "VOTERS BEWARE: I voted a straight party ticket this morning. Before pressing the cast ballot button, I scanned to make sure all I had voted for appeared in the final list. All did EXCEPT my choice for President. I called the helper and she was puzzled. The judge came and she was also puzzled. I had to go back to page 1, indicate straight party ticket and then scroll down to my Presidential candidate and click on that name. After that, the final ballot appeared as I wanted and then I cast my ballot.My advice: Double check your ballot before you press the final cast ballot button."Came from a voter in the Houston area...No dems are complaining...pay attention people...voter fraud is out en force!We are getting record numbers of voters this year...Texas is a red state so most are repubs! "Please share this everywhere!!!!!
11 | Daniel West | 1546083982078293_1546126788740679 | Rigged biased news lol NBC should have thought this through before backing a political party and therefore losing its credibility as an actual news source...real journalism is dead
12 | Sasha Bens | 1546083982078293_1546091485410876 | Yes, yes Donald...we know...the world is out to get you and the election is only rigged when you're losing, and polls only count when you're winning. Put your big boy pants on and act like a grown up!You're losing because you run your mouth and use your political platform to attack everyone who doesn't agree with you, and start calling them name. You're losing because, despite the fact that you had a political gift wrapped up in a golden bow, call Wikileaks, you made the focus of your campaign bashing Bill Clinton, Obama, and trash talking women who claim you sexually assaulted them...therefore, keeping it in the media spotlight. People want to hear your policy's...they aren't interested in childish vindictiveness.
13 | Gloria Vargas | 1546083982078293_1546095928743765 | I can't wait to get over with the "rigged against him " he will not understand not everyone think his genius get over!! their is Hillary more prepare shows in all debates why she's going ahead 👌
14 | Don Bit | 1546083982078293_1546125272074164 | If they are not rigged then why are voters reporting that their votes are being changed to democrat when they vote republican??? ABC tell us what is being done about this? No matter who you vote for the votes should be accurate.
15 | Charliestud Hollywood | 1546083982078293_1546106438742714 | Let's be honest trump is just behind with women ,arabs, muslims, blacks, latinos ,Asians j,ews, catholics, Christians ,and well educated white people ,but he is ahead with people who think like him the people who thinks that other people is to blame because they are losers. With the people who sees everything negative with the people who hate minorities with the people who always is blaming somebody else for their failures in that group trump is ahead in the polls
16 | Lynn Dusatko | 1546083982078293_602998559879738 | It's obviously rigged by very rich cocksuckers that own the MSM,  luckily people are figuring this out and stopped believing NBC, CNN, CBS, ABC years ago🤓.  How did Hillary become a millionaire being Secretary of State?
17 | Lukas Chase | 1546083982078293_1546129535407071 | NBC you are just as much of a Crook as Hillery. That's why Noone believes in your news coverage. I don't know how any of your reporters and news crew look as your selfs in the mirror........ great job guys.
18 | Steve Sullivan Jr | 1546083982078293_1546090665410958 | The ABC News poll showed Clinton with 50 percent and Trump with 38 percent. There was one major problem with the poll, though — Democrats were oversampled by 9 percent
19 | Leslie Sloss | 1546083982078293_1546122932074398 | Trump will do what Trump does. He has divided and conquered the GOP. Trump has promoted sexual assault on women with his lewd comments to Billy Bush. Trump has mocked the disabled. Trump has insulted race after race. Trump has consulted with HIMSELF on military issues and watched shows for foreign polilcy advice. Trump has accused Hillary of being crooked and YET there are accusations of him doing some of the same things he has accused her of doing. Everything Trump is accused of, he is a master of spinning it onto Hillary. Just do a little serious research on all of this. I'm not posting this to argue and I won't argue. These are just some of the truths about Trump and his run for presidency. He is tiresome, boring and will fade into the night eventually. I am an independent voter, by the way, who quickly turned my back when Trump mocked that disabled reporter. That in itself was enough for me. It's right on video. All of his messes are either on audio or video and he STILL denies these things. The wikileaks, promoted by a hack from Russia, has shown no smoking guns. It was reported that Trump was informed that Russia was behind the leaks and Trump still denied it. He doesn't question that a foreign entity hacked into our system. In fact, he asks them to find more of Hillary's emails. That didn't surprise me because Trump and Pence both praise Putin. That is not patriotic to me. Then the Associated Press posted a story, 11/22/14 about the GOP, republican run house, at the time, had found no wrongdoing in the Obama Administration in Benghazi, during their investigation. And after 11 hours of grueling testimony from Hillary last year, still, no criminal charges. After all this is said and done, like I said, Trump mocking that disabled reporter was all it took for me to realize where Trump's heart was. After praising Putin, I realized, for myself, where I feel his allegiance lies. He has tried to divide this country by saying he will only accept the election results if he "wins". Again, that is not patriotic. In fact, it sounds like a bully tactic to get my vote. No thanks. I think, in fact I know, my vote will go to Hillary. I know she is not perfect. For me, better, by far, than the alternative.
20 | Allen Oscar Araya | 1546083982078293_1546087945411230 | Trump is a buffoon we all know that but if Hillary won the general election by a landslide that could be the biggest fraud in the history of United States in front of our eyes by the help of the so-called "liberal" media, which for decades bashed Fox News and Republicans but is uncapable to challenge or question their queen.
21 | Denise Hildenbrand | 1546083982078293_1130906683625897 | Everyone I know has never once took a poll so I have no idea where NBC News is getting their information from unless you are only polling Democrats!!
22 | Lelia Davisson Phillips | 1546083982078293_602998689879725 | One thing is certain, and that is NBC, CBS, ABC and CNN has lost all creditability. I will prob never watch any of them again. Luckily for me I don't like reality tv anyway.
23 | Steve Kirk | 1546083982078293_1546108995409125 | When you in the media stop oversampling Democrats and undersampling Republicans then people will believe your polls that are 180 degrees out from what rallies and individual donations say.
24 | Barb Higgins | 1546083982078293_1546127348740623 | I personally do not believe any of the polls especially when thousands of people show up to see Trump and less than 600 for Clinton... Ridiculous for NBC to keep posting these false polls
25 | Charie Miller | 1546083982078293_1370803592952662 | Blah, blah, blah NBC your really good at bull💩. If this election has taught me anything it's to never ever ever trust the #MSM again. The news used to have real journalist. Now I just change the channel every time it comes on. I'm glad to be awake now.

Louisville Slugger has been making bats for the World Series every year since 1903, and they'll continue the streak tonight when the Chicago Cubs face the Cleveland Indians in Game 1.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Bill Karim | 1545711615448863_1546069062079785 | At the start of the playoffs MLB Network had a very cool promotional video for the playoffs (It was called "The Journey" or "The Quest" or something like that) where they highlighted the making of the World Series Trophy (which is made by Tiffany's). I can't find the video anywhere anymore, I just thought it was super cool. It looks like such a robust and manly process, kind of like making the Louisville bats, but with so much precision and so many different parts.

3 | John Zilvetiz | 1545711615448863_1546078372078854 | Keep this in mind : Donald Trump did not steal your money. Donald Trump did not raise your taxes. Donald Trump did not quadruple the price of food. Trump is not stirring a race war. Trump did not leave any US soldiers in Benghazi to be slaughtered and desecrated by Muslims. Trump did not send the US Navy to fight for Syrian Al-Qaeda. Trump did not arm ISIS and systematically exterminate Christians throughout the Middle East. Trump did not betray Israel. Trump did not provide financing and technology to Iran's nuclear weapons program. Trump did not give our military secrets to China. Trump did not remove our nuclear missile shield in Poland at the behest of Russia. Trump did not shrivel our military, and betray our veterans. Trump did not cripple our economy. Trump did not increase our debt to 20 trillion dollars. Trump did not ruin our credit, twice. Trump did not double African American unemployment. Trump did not increase welfare to a record level for eight years. Trump did not sign a law making it legal to execute, and imprison Americans. Trump did not set free all of terrorists in Guantanamo bay. Trump did not steal your rights, violate US Constitutional law, or commit treason, hundreds of times. Yet Trump is being ripped apart in the news, non stop. Barrack Hussein Obama, Hillary Clinton and the criminals occupying our government, are not. The media is the Democratic Party. Save our culture. Stop listening to them..!! Please copy and Paste

His delusions of grandeur are very obvious, and he may have a genuine mental health issue. Endorsements that never happened, denying things that he did ON VIDEO, "we're winning in all the polls!"....
2 | Mark Smith | 1546002842086407_1546006425419382 | Don't believe nbc or the media.they don't think people can think for themselves. .read all the WIKI LEAKS news..HILLARY AND THE DNC ARE CORRUPT
3 | Judi Adams Leavitt | 1546002842086407_1546007558752602 | tell that to Hillary stopping by voting places while people were voting in NC,,,and being within so many feet of an individual voter,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,that's against the law too
4 | Trina Floyd | 1546002842086407_1546010505418974 | We get it. Trump. Is. A. Joke. Seriously, just collect all of his stories for the week and post them on Saturday. Anything he does no longer amuses, angers, or surprises me. And at this point, I'm numb. 2 weeks until the election and I couldn't be happier.
5 | Jim Coleman | 1546002842086407_1546011218752236 | Trump has been endorsed by 13 women. They included multiple claims of sexual abuse. I guess that ties in with the rape of a 13 year old child. The groper really was vile and vulgar.
6 | Carol A. Heuring | 1546002842086407_1546017008751657 | He has mentioned a few times that ICE endorses him.  The agency itself can't endorse him, but I am sure there are some ICE agents that do endorse him.  But it's a big difference, federal agencies don't, and can't, endorse candidates.
7 | Gary Johnson | 1546002842086407_1546026508750707 | I am a REPUBLICAN and i am not voting for trump.He is a professional liar. This guy could lie to the extent that he forgot he lied publicly. And he will say anything to win. #factcheck
8 | Kellie Neal Salazar | 1546002842086407_1546012695418755 | No, they do endorse him through the National Border Patrol Council. Read below...http://www.bpunion.org/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/1824-national-border-patrol-council-endorses-donald-trump-for-president
9 | Rob Nilsen | 1546002842086407_1546018452084846 | It was a Union of ICE Employees. It's still pro ICE. The media is so biased they don't even cover the other campaign fairly anymore. Did NBC even cover his 100 DAYS if he were to get into office?
10 | John Skirtich | 1546002842086407_1546036088749749 | NBC ... really ? We all know Hillary is disqualified from holding public office. Did you see what happened to Pa's Kathleen Kane ? That should also be happening to Hillary. Only much worse has Hillary done. Try to report actual news for once. I know its difficult for you with your strong connections to Hillary and democrats.
11 | Jerry Reil | 1546002842086407_1546012358752122 | NBC, among the worst to patronize citizens and striving to manipulate them as cattle to be herded and driven rather than as human beings.You're involved in crime and corruption and are soon going to be brought to justice
12 | Nina Perez | 1546002842086407_1546013825418642 | My Union supports Hillary I don't ! My Union supports De Blasio I share as hell don't, ppl in the military can vote or support anyone they wa t they just can't " endorse " them officially, I know many ppl & family in the military & state goverment employees supporting trump
13 | Mary Heberger | 1546002842086407_1757541511164398 | So you Libs really think wikileaks is fake and Hillary Clinton really did delete 33,000 emails that were her boring yoga schedules??? Destroyed phones with hammers because they contained no important information??
14 | Tracey Brandon Wilson | 1546002842086407_1757545081164041 | Jesus Christ can't you all just once write a story on crooked hillery? Like the guy that was on Hannity last night that was called "the fixer" he would fix negative stories about the Clintons. SMDH I have lost all respect for most of the media. So crooked
15 | Debbie Olson | 1546002842086407_710616095758596 | If federal agencies are not allowed to endorse a candidate, why is the president of the US allowed to campaign for one on tax payers tab?  Also, the agencies themselves did not endorse Trump, but the unions and many of the individuals working for those agencies have endorsed him. NBC, I think you are trying to make his statements sound like lies by being overly technical with his exact wording, but when Hillary says similar things, you flat out ignore and don't even report on them and other issues of hers that are much more detrimental to our country than Trumps inaccurate wording of who is endorsing him.
16 | Danielle Muscato | 1546002842086407_710618159091723 | To call Trump a liar is to miss the point.Trump goes beyond lying. He doesn't say things he knows to be false, with intent to deceive—generally, when people lie, they are deeply concerned with plausibility and consistency.Trump, rather, seems to have no idea what is actually true or false, or even COULD be true or false, and simply says whatever he thinks will make him sound good in the moment. He is a bullshitter, with absolutely no regard for plausibility or consistency.
17 | Steve Revis | 1546002842086407_919968598134356 | It was an endorsement by the UNION which represents ICE, not ICE itself.  And that endorsement was very real. With all the genuine and far more concerning reasons to dislike Trump, it's pathetic that the media would resort to writing a hit piece based on such an irrelevant technicality.
18 | Jon Barnby | 1546002842086407_1757582467826969 | You're resorting to playing semantics to try creating yet another Trump bashing article. You know full well what he means when he says he was endorsed by the Border Patrol. Go back to school and learn how to be a journalist rather than a Clinton puppet.
19 | Tracy Hartford | 1546002842086407_1546017355418289 | HilLIARy brags about it too and much worse!! The corrupt media reports its biased twisted version once again
20 | John Pellouso | 1546002842086407_1790012487939406 | The source says it all. I wouldn't believe anything from NBC or any of there affiliates. They are just liberal sheep. I think most people know it is the unions from these organizations  that want Trump not the organizations themselves. The heads of these organizations are in it for the money so they want Hillary. Follow the money and you will always find a Clinton. Corrupt.
21 | Barbara Nielsen | 1546002842086407_1790020961271892 | That's all you got NBC?  IF that is even true, it pales in comparison to the lies and scandals of the Clinton's.  Both candidates are far from perfect but I'm going with the one who doesn't support the butchering of full-term babies, who doesn't support millions of immigrants being granted citizenship, who is in favor of term limits and ending special interest groups in DC, who will create jobs through trade reform rather than the government creating yet another program and who will reform the health care system and end Obamacare, which, in case you haven't checked, your policy is going up by 25% next year, who supports our military and vets and our police officers and supports the NRA and my second amendment rights and the list goes on and on.  If the truth were ever told by the media, this would be no contest.
22 | David Bowen | 1546002842086407_1757551921163357 | It's amazing all the butt hurt sheep that lie and try to rationalize their love for the Democratic party. The Democrats (Hilliary) are the kings and queens of lies and corruption. Hilliary has been caught in lie after lie after lie. She has stole artifacts and furniture from both the White House and now we are finding out from the State Dept. as well. She has been on record stating that "they were broke when they left the White House". Let me ask the sheep on here. How can you go from broke to being worth over 32 million in 16 years in public service? She does not own a business, she has not manufactured anything, she does have a foundation that is suppose to be for charity! How does this happen? How many of you that support her have 3 homes worth a million a piece? How many of you have made millions in the last 16 years doing nothing or charity work? She and her family do not care about anything but lining their pockets. They don't care about you other than for your vote. She is the most corrupt, unethical, racist, and lying piece of white trash there has ever been in politics. But the sheep will continue to follow this POS to the slaughter. Have fun recognizing this country again if she is elected. I pray for your children and your grandchildren, (as well as mine) because they will be witness to the destruction of this country. If you don't believe me, take a look at Germany and France to see what progressive liberalism/socialism looks like.
23 | Chuck Stone Ranger | 1546002842086407_1546032172083474 | While an "agency" may not officially endorse, it shouldn't take a brain surgeon to realize "law and order" type professionals stand behind a guy that is "law and order"
24 | Diane Boysen | 1546002842086407_1546023145417710 | The only thing exciting about this election that I could think of is if we scrapped the entire thing and found better candidates...I am so sick of politics and the mud slinging and lies this time around.  It's beyond dangerous and childish all at the same time.
25 | Justin Weis | 1546002842086407_1790061824601139 | I wish NBC NEWS would report on just a fraction of the crimes crooked hillary has committed. I have lost all respect for most of the major news channels due to their refusal to tell the Ruth or even report anything bad from a woman who does nothing but lie and cheat.

2 | Frank Idornigie | 1545986075421417_1546168512069840 | From my perspective, the ability to connect 'non-ip address' home devices in order to facilitate various forms of manipulations has been in existence for over a decade and half or much more. Although, not limited to home devices, there's a sort of network connectivity that facilitates communication with home devices that are constantly, electrically connected to a main source. Probably, it's the integration with home devices with IP address and its subsequent sophistication, we should be concerned about by 2020, that's if It's not already in effect. Public Traffic lights, washing machine and its likes are already an easy target to such network connectivity. From my perspective, the western extreme right groups/the Nazis/the KKK/the bad Atheists, are behind it all.
3 | Nakia Rah Jackson | 1545986075421417_1546003125419712 | Why are so many people negative Nelly's ? Progress is a wonderful thing. This is the reason we as a society have advanced so rapidly.

8 | Gary Doan | 1545986075421417_1546119552074736 | I have given Democrats far too much credit in the past. Everyone should realize the press is biased, but most Democrats deny it. I has assumed that some people were either naive or brainwashed, but now I'm starting to believe they appreciate and support our biased corrupt media. There no way bias is not noticeable at this point in time and I'm an deeply ashamed of all Democrats. An Ex-Democrat.

Here's why the U.S. election won't be the next Brexit.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Sandy Brakeman Zinninger | 1545934612093230_1545944625425562 | NBC stop telling the truth you're upsetting the Deplorables who really should be on the "unbiased" sites like FOX and Breitbart so they can have 2 more weeks of pretending Trump isn't a big loser.
2 | James Polivka | 1545934612093230_1545949778758380 | I'm not going to say "oh well looks like I'll just stay home" because NBC asked Trump to concede 3 weeks before election day and NBC  declared Florida for Hillary on the first day of early voting.
3 | Rob Maynard | 1545934612093230_1545939865426038 | NBC you've been a crapfest this entire election process. Thats why your number of follows severely dipped compared to other unbiased news sites.
4 | Brian Little | 1545934612093230_1545973218756036 | 20,000 attended a Trump Rally in Tampa yesterday Vs 30 attendees at a Tim Kaine rally in West Palm. I'm not sure who the left NBC, MSNBC, or whomever have been polling, but it hasn't been the American People.
5 | Eric Barrone | 1545934612093230_1545954615424563 | I kinda in a way wouldnt mind seein Hillary win. Just so when everytime they have news about troops being killed overseas or civilians being killed in public areas like past nightclub shootings etc. Or anything that generally is bad like that. I just know that instead of it being addressed in all gloom n doom like past Presidents that at least Hillary will keep it light by laughing n laughing n laughing about it while addressing the nation making me wanna laugh from her contagious laughing making my day better in a dark time..lol
6 | Charles R. Jones | 1545934612093230_1545950015425023 | Can we all just respect each other, we do not have to vote for the same person. this race has made a lot of so called good friends fight an not be friends any more. god loves us all no matter who we are voting for,. we do not have to agree , but we are all in this together weather you like it or not. i myself will be voting for mr. trump. just please get out an vote. do not wast your vote by not voting. god bless us all.
7 | Dave DiBiase | 1545934612093230_1545965052090186 | I've had 5 pollsters contact me this election cycle, 1 of them from when I lived in Seattle and 2 from when I was in Chicago based on the questions for the congressional races.  I now live in New York.  How can the polls be anywhere near accurate if the lists that are being used are that far out if date?  I am also aware of several folks that are so pissed at HRC's policies they are voting this cycle for Trump after not voting for several years.  The polling data is all over the place.  With a turnout that is going to be staggering because of Trump, I think all bets are off on this one till it's over.
8 | Ralph Bailey | 1545934612093230_1546024085417616 | "Dear Republicans, - Author -Meira WainsteinYou remember how this started, right? You got in bed with the ‘I’m mad as hell and I’m not gonna take it anymore’ Tea Party. You saw the Harvard Law Review Editor who just happened to be black and you lost your minds. You called him a Socialist. You said he never read the Constitution. You said he was a Muslim as if that were some slight when Muslims have fought and died for this country right beside citizens of every other religion. It was never enough. You never seemed to run out of the venom you spewed.You played to the fears of white, male America. “He’s coming for your guns!” How many did the Great Gun Grabber actually get? You stared at twenty children slaughtered in Sandy Hook and turned up your palms and said, “This isn’t the time to talk about gun control.”You listened and half-believed the conspiracy theorists who talked about the great conspiracy of Sandy Hook and too many of you accused the parents of being actors. The best of you, who used to care about your country first and your party second, kept silent and eventually began to participate in the madness.You sold your souls because you saw after Romney lost that you weren’t going to be sitting your man in the White House anytime soon. Reince Priebus presented his autopsy of that election. To even be competitive, you have to carry 40% of the Latino vote and 45% of the women’s vote. Let’s not even consider the black vote which Romney lost by more than 90 points! Romney only got 27% of the Latino vote.DID YOU LEARN FROM IT?You certainly swelled your ranks with a fresh infusion of “populist” infantry who had the audacity to say Obama was going to invade Texas in Operation Jade Helm. You said that he was born in Kenya and a secret agent of the Muslim Brotherhood. You were more angry at Hillary than at the murderers at Benghazi. You stood there, silent and complicit as every maniac with a mouthpiece or radio show lied and incited their listeners to hatred and worse.  When your cries of wolf fell on deaf ears, you turned up the volume.The night Obama won, the establishment met in secret and promised to do everything to make him a one term president even if it meant hurting the country. That’s what your partisanship wrought and what did you achieve? You wasted millions in taxpayer money to flog the Benghazi horse and you voted to repeal Obamacare sixty times. While you strained to do anything to make the President look bad, you shut down the government and cost the economy $24 billion. While you played brinksmanship with the full faith and credit of our government, what you really achieved was to convince the vast majority of Americans that you are incapable of governing.This time you went to the natural end of your rope and jumped the shark with Trump costing you stalwart republicans like George Will, Charles Krauthammer, Bill Kristol and any steward of the Nation’s security. You nominated a man for his success in business even as many of his businesses were going bankrupt and are under investigation for fraud. You apparently learned not a thing from the political train wreck that was George W. Bush.But this time is different and you know it now. There is no hiding the fact that white supremacists and the full complement of other racists and xenophobes have embraced your nominee publicly and loudly.  The last Univision poll Jorge Ramos reported had Trump with an 83% disapproval rating among Latino voters. The party that claims to be the defender of “family values” sent dreamers back across the border or deported their parents  so they have to visit them across a fence. Not only have you proven that you care nothing for their lives but your nominee intends to deport eleven million of them."You built this, own it.
9 | Carla Jo Durbin Ferguson | 1545934612093230_1546012115418813 | "If you are Gay, Why are you voting for Hillary when she wants to bring in thousands of refugees that believe all Gays should be executed?If you are Black, Why are you voting for Hillary when she admires Margaret Sanger and defends Planned Parenthood who want to abort as many black babies as possible? Exterminate the black race because they are like "weeds". (Margaret Sanger quote) Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.If you are a Christian, Why are you voting for Hillary Clinton when she wrote her Senior thesis on Saul Alinsky who dedicated his book 'Rules for Radicals' to Lucifer (the Devil)? She says he was, and still is her mentor.If you are a Veteran, in the Military, or closely related to a Military member, Why are you voting for Hillary when she left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again? They called for help but the help was told to stand down.If you have a factory job, Why are you voting for Hillary when she supported TPP? Factory workers are being laid off because jobs are going over seas. Don't forget the deals she's made with china. She also welcomes open borders and illegals to get benefits to be paid with Your tax money.If you are poor, Why are you voting for Hillary, when she is supporting Wall street and all the big banks? Big banks keep poor people poor by destroying the poor man's credit by allowing medical bills and collections to affect your credit scores so you can pay higher interest rates than the rich; Taking much of the little money you earn.If you are a Woman, how can you vote for Hillary when she has buried all of Bills rape victims under the rug, including that little girl that was raped? Lawyer Hillary defended the rapist, and then she laughed about it later, knowing that he was guilty.If you carry a gun, or believe in the Constitution; How can you vote for Hillary when she wants to eliminate the NRA, Take your guns, and abolish the second Amendment?If you breathe, Why would you vote for Hillary when she and the Clinton crime family have left a trail of dead people that did not agree with her, or they knew too much?Who is left?"
10 | John Cahalane | 1545934612093230_1546032552083436 | On the Brexit question a majority of those who voted exit are repenting now in fact most of those Brexitiers as their called who lied,and made up stories like Nigel Farrage of UKIP resigned and jumped on board the Trump-turniptruck ....this happens not very often and we will know the truth November 9th anyway....

12 | Karras Atherton | 1545934612093230_1546063128747045 | The thing is, brexit was a referendum which is all about the popular vote and nothing else. I gather your electoral college system allows for a candidate to lose the popular vote but still win by a considerable margin. So no, I don't suppose it is all that much like brexit at all.
13 | Matt Norcross | 1545934612093230_1545978915422133 | The experts know uneducated people voted for Brexit because of xenophobia and racism. Thankfully, it will never happen here because blacks and hispanics are increasing. We don't need anymore racism.
14 | Crystal Russ Horace | 1545934612093230_1545970122089679 | They all want to compare rally numbers to votes. It doesn't work that way😂While we're at work y'all have the time to be at rally's. Don't worry though, we'll be at the polls where it counts. Polls stay open after business hours💅🏾
15 | Alvin Harrison | 1545934612093230_1545999912086700 | Don't worry.... We are planning the largest rally in U.S. history on Nov. 9th for the first woman president! Feel free to join us all 😃🍾🗽🎈🇺🇸
16 | Peter Cronig | 1545934612093230_1545961478757210 | Pretend HIllary is behind. So then get out there and VOTE BLUE In all Local, State and Federal Elections on Tuesday, November 8th and beyond!!!
17 | Iggi Gershon | 1545934612093230_1545969852089706 | Humpty Trumpty is the star of a political reality show of his own making, a deeply disturbing parody of a real political contest! Lies ... Insults ... Slander ... Threats ... these are the tools of the feeble minded and delusional coke head! This is why the Republican Party needs to be smacked down hard for unleashing vile Humpty Trumpty and the Undertaker Pence on the USA and the world!
18 | Morgan Spears | 1545934612093230_1545947232091968 | What? Real numbers don't lie? Be careful! All of those 'people' that compare rally's in certain areas of certain states against objective statistical analysis might get angry and firebomb their own headquarters.
19 | Connie Davenport Leagon | 1545934612093230_1546158395404185 | They are already reporting that voting machines in Texas & Illinois are changing the votes from republican to democratic. They are warning people to watch for it before they submit their votes. Pretty sad when the only way you can win is to cheat. NBC NEWS won't report on that because it's already been proven they are being paid off by the Clinton campaign.
20 | Stephanie Todd Feltner | 1545934612093230_1546009738752384 | Sorry NBC, but after the attempts at sabotage Trump has experienced from his own party by people like Jeb and Paul Ryan, you'll excuse me if I roll my eyes at your polls.🙄I didn't even vote for Trump in the primaries, but anyone with eyes to see can determine the intense efforts against him by BOTH parties' establishment politicians, as well as MSM.
21 | Kristy Smith | 1545934612093230_1546004122086279 | Yeah it polls this way when you only ask 26% GOP, and about the same Independents.... The polls are complete crap and so are the mainstream media. You might as well be TMZ, or the National Inquirer. No wait, even they are better than you these days. NBC is a joke. So shameful.
22 | Michael Okwuchukwu Jeromes | 1545934612093230_1545956842091007 | The Brit exits trump is saying simple means surprise because Cameron and his group never believed that they will lost the election so it took them by surprise . Means trump will take Hillary by surprise after he will be declared as the winner that is Brit exit for democrat .
23 | Joe Jenkins | 1545934612093230_1546010102085681 | Brexit wasn't even the last polling mess-up. If you actually look at the polls RIGHT BEFORE THE VOTE the two sides were in a dead heat and the end results were inside the margin of error for said polls. People need to stop renewing this myth...
24 | Bill Roudabush | 1545934612093230_1546205118732846 | VOTE VOTE VOTE do not let the media and bogus poll's discourage you from voting that's what they want. This is going to be the biggest upset in the history of president elections. Trump has 10x as many people showing up for his rallies than Clinton. #MakeAmericaSrongAgain #MakeAmericaSafeAgainAgain #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016
25 | Roxane McDonald | 1545934612093230_1546011035418921 | It's happening!!! Voting machines are already changing Trump votes to Clinton votes!! Shut those polling sites down!! Impound those machines as evidence!! Replace all voting devices and staff before reopening!! It's going to be a slow election!!

3 | Natalie Sundramah | 1545923642094327_1545936102093081 | Trump, his campaign, and followers are completely delusional with their "drain the swamp" hashtags and insistence that they're winning. NEWS FLASH: Your candidate is such an embarrassment that people residing in Trump Place have signed a petition to have his name removed from the building. Not only is he losing this election "bigly" (😂) but its also affecting his brand.
4 | David Kenneth | 1545923642094327_1545928715427153 | I'm so impressed with the poor grammar and spelling of most of the "Hate Hillary" trolls. If only your handlers would give you some validity maybe people would buy into the propaganda you're trying to pander. Based on actual polls, yes the ones that were fairly accurate 4 years ago and all you crazy conservatives fought up until the election, HRC will get between 350-400 electoral votes this year. It could get worse for Trump in the next 2 weeks if he continues to implode, which is always quite likely.
5 | Andie N Brad Byers | 1545923642094327_1545931005426924 | 1. I think ALL the media is a load of hogwash!2. Is this how Mrs. Clinton will "rig" the election? No matter what the votes are, as long as the media reports she won, she won? Do you think if you tell us enough times and long enough, we'll eventually believe you?!
6 | Dorinda Chris Wells | 1545923642094327_1545933922093299 | On the news this morning Trump claims he is "winning"......how can that be? He says the system is rigged....so by his own words if it's riggeed that means he's losing not winning.......can't have it both ways Trump  smh
7 | Iggi Gershon | 1545923642094327_1545965198756838 | Humpty Trumpty is a boastful, self-centered egomaniac who lacks a record of public service or familiarity with the issues.

8 | Sherry Mellott | 1545923642094327_1545985732088118 | This is why Trump is not the right for president. He sows discord...his followers go around repeating things, they are rude...rude in a weird scary way. People I know are not acting like their normal selves. He ruined the republican party instead of healing it.
9 | Joan Høj Jacobsen | 1545923642094327_1545991962087495 | Ohhhh, we can hope. Please let it be so. Please let this mean fifty years of uninterrupted Democratic presidencies, to allow the Republicans to join the 21st century. Although in fairness, they have to get out of the 19th first, so they've got a lot of catching up to do.
10 | David Fuller | 1545923642094327_1546001135419911 | "This is some one else's post! Thought I would share it! "VOTERS BEWARE: I voted a straight party ticket this morning. Before pressing the cast ballot button, I scanned to make sure all I had voted for appeared in the final list. All did EXCEPT my choice for President. I called the helper and she was puzzled. The judge came and she was also puzzled. I had to go back to page 1, indicate straight party ticket and then scroll down to my Presidential candidate and click on that name. After that, the final ballot appeared as I wanted and then I cast my ballot.My advice: Double check your ballot before you press the final cast ballot button."Came from a voter in the Houston area...No dems are complaining...pay attention people...voter fraud is out en force!We are getting record numbers of voters this year...Texas is a red state so most are repubs! "Please share this everywhere!!!!!
11 | Tom Degand | 1545923642094327_1546023352084356 | Kristina, this is exactly what I was talking about earlier. And what Johnson was predicting about the Republican party splitting.Now if Trump negatively affects the Republican candidates for Congress, then Hillary will have it easy.
12 | John McAuliffe | 1545923642094327_1545924165427608 | Her team did a great job with that manual on manufacturing poll leads (released by Wikileaks, though you probably didn't hear about it)
13 | Jeremiah Dow | 1545923642094327_1546093088744049 | There is no Republican Party. They are just a bunch of whiny cry babies who cannot defend freedom and the markets from government precisely because they HAVE NO PRINCIPLES by which to judge.
14 | Karen Stoll | 1545923642094327_1546071435412881 | the republican party is divided because they cant support ther on nominee - he won the primaries so the people spoke now it is time for all of them to shut up and help the party win in Nov  - it is the old timers that are dividing the party  they wont accept changing ways - soon it will be to late
15 | Memory Tyson | 1545923642094327_1546034972083194 | Sooooo Trump is winning??? But I thought the election was rigged?? (His words) This man is not Presidential material..... He is a business man who sends work to other countries...He makes a mockery out of people...He's beyond disrespectful and narsactic.... You people want him to run our country?? He doesn't even wanna run this country..he just wanted to show the Republican party that he could ....Funny how people don't remember the statement he made in 1998... This man has not even been a Republican long LMAO!!!! If he wins and he wont.... but if he does and he runs America like he runs is businesses.....We are doomed.... But this is JUST MY OPINION.....MY OPINION.......
16 | Byrd Ardoin | 1545923642094327_1545929532093738 | and NBC News is part of that problem.. you won't deal with the Sauds over #Yemen or actually talk to Syrians like RT does or share like China Xinhua News or Press TV even DW News knows what to do.. but we are stuck with a corporate media who is pushing that agenda and we are going to find the facts where they are and not in the usa's #MSM
17 | Carol Whisman Cyrus | 1545923642094327_1546124878740870 | It's the result of all the harm committed by the tea party & Republican Party in obstructing and attempting to shut down the United States government. We've been through extremely serious times folks. Some of you don't comprehend it.
18 | Dirk Schipper | 1545923642094327_1546206762066015 | Being fractured is actually a good thing here as the current Rep. Party let Obama run all over them with his unethical and Unamerican policys and agenda! How about this...all you crooked panzi assed Repubs go side with the crooked and criminal Demos because we don't need you anymore!!
19 | Larry Jackson | 1545923642094327_1545946078758750 | The polls were accurate when he was up. Kelly Ann says he's behind. His surrogates says he behind. This guy has tapped into all the hate that still exists in this country. Trump's liar!!!
20 | Robert Hanks | 1545923642094327_1546054782081213 | The Constitution and being fiscally conservative is enough of a common bond to hold the Republican party together. It's a big tent we entertain many other ideas.
21 | Jo Ann Payne Harris | 1545923642094327_1545974048755953 | I have yet to be polled NBC. I think they only call democrats for their polls, or maybe they just  don't call anyone from Indiana.
22 | Shivaun Hogan | 1545923642094327_1546091155410909 | How on earth did they let him get this far? I know some die hard Republicans who were so for him, now they're saying,( because he's losing) Oh he doesn't represent the Republican Party, Seriously, I am relishing the destruction of this party, it's what they get for allowing a lunatic to be their nominee.
23 | Lynn Buddies | 1545923642094327_1546074412079250 | A fractured Republican Party? Too bad, so sad. They did it to themselves and got what they deserved. Anyone who thinks Trump is winning is either stupid or .  . . . stupid..
24 | Patrick Isbell | 1545923642094327_1545929582093733 | Came here to see the Trumpets denying and calling the elections rigged. Was not disappointed. The disconnect from reality is real with these people.
25 | Toni Seiple Wilson | 1545923642094327_1546160038737354 | It's not really fractured....she had the republicans interests at heart too....their money and special interest groups. They will be fine with her as president.

2 | Mitchell King | 1545829248770433_1545833695436655 | Wasn't it JUST a few years ago that everyone was acting like Miley was the worst person in the world for wearing what was basically a bathing suit on the VMAs? But yeah, no, now that she's stumping for Clinton she's a media darling. Got it.
3 | Kevin McHugh | 1545829248770433_1545869955433029 | Two of the most vapid, self-absorbed, vacuous people on the planet, telling people how to vote?  What's the matter, Kanye and Kim busy?  Seriously, if you give any thought to what celebrities think about the election, do the country a favor and stay away from the polls. And NBC?  Whoever the "reporter" is that "reported" on this ought to have their press credentials pulled and sent to work in the want ads department. But then, that's true of NBC as a whole.
4 | Brad Parks | 1545829248770433_1545921505427874 | Lol. A woman who degrades herself and a man who raps about degrading women, telling people to vote democrat. That's funny stuff.
5 | Pam Evans Cate | 1545829248770433_1545844868768871 | Why I'm voting for #Trump2016#1. He actually loves his country.Reducing regulations on companies/creating jobs/saving jobsCutting taxes/saving the middle classRepealing replacing Obamacare Energy independence/clean coal/pipeline Strengthening border/building wall/is a country without boundaries still a country?Deporting CRIMINAL illegal aliensUphold, honor and respect police officers and military/rebuilding military Renovating inner cities and improvinginfrastructureTaking care of vetsExtreme vetting of refugeesSaving 2nd amendmentNaming the enemy..."radical Islam" and eradicating themNaming Supreme Court Justices who will uphold constitution/no partial birth abortionEducation guidelines back to the states/no Common CoreSchool Choice Program for all studentsProposal of term limits on ALL politiciansBolster social security and give seniors a substantial raiseAnd lastly, Trump has professed his Christian faith and is a changed man according to many Christian leaders and pastors.Did I miss anything?
6 | Willis M Parker | 1545829248770433_1545957112090980 | Miley showing off her boobs to get voters to vote Clinton. She is so ignorant. If some on dressed like that and campaigned for Trump NBC would be reporting how disgraceful it was.
7 | Brian Kennedy | 1545829248770433_1546022645417760 | So lets get this straight... NBC condemns Trump for his private comments, but props up Jay-Z who is rich and famous for misogynistic and violent lyrics.Brian Williams News is beyond parody.
8 | Patrick Williamson | 1545829248770433_1545841328769225 | It's not even the celebrities I'm worried about. One quick glance at the comments and replies and it's a bit more concerning. All the crazy nutjobs are out in full force! And even worse, they walk among us!
9 | Thomas Bryan | 1545829248770433_1545899918763366 | What fine examples to represent the democrats.  The sad part is that a lot (maybe most) people on the left actually do decide things based on fads, popularity, and whatever their fav celeb says.
10 | Amanda Espenscheid | 1545829248770433_1545979268755431 | NBC news you can't find better headlines? This won't stear my vote one bit. Jay z and Miley Cyrus are not role model material
11 | Mira Arakanchi | 1545829248770433_1546006702086021 | When did Americans become so stupid that they can't think for themselves and who they will be voting for and basing their decision on which candidate is better for our country. Oh wait, they didn't!! But for some reason these KILLARY supporters think they can swing votes for KILLARY just because they are famous and supporting her.

After that, the final ballot appeared as I wanted and then I cast my ballot.My advice: Double check your ballot before you press the final cast ballot button."Came from a voter in the Houston area...No dems are complaining...pay attention people...voter fraud is out en force!We are getting record numbers of voters this year...Texas is a red state so most are repubs! "Please share this everywhere!!!!!

Big deal... it's no different than when Obama and Michelle held invited music entertainers into the White House. Didn't help him any either ...good luck with that one. 😂😂
20 | Gina Coppolino Baribault | 1545829248770433_1546046608748697 | If that's what the media is proud of to vote for Hillary..Not in this life time..She is a disrespted punk..Don't care if she has made lots of money..only because her father is famous
21 | Andrew Lavin | 1545829248770433_1545910482095643 | A crack dealer, and someone who is mentally retarded from smoking K2. They must be liberals. Only the worst reporting journalists like NBC would post something so stupid.
22 | Joseph Chandler | 1545829248770433_1545832632103428 | God who the cares about these millionaires Americans need to think for themselves. They need to look at themselves and vote with their gut and use their brain and vote with their conscience in mind. I am tired of these rich elitists running their fing mouths when they have never struggled a day in their life.
23 | Nancy Edwards Jenkins | 1545829248770433_1546083442078347 | We need TRUMP more than ever now by the way miley and Jay z is wanting Hillary. ..the rapper who degrades women in songs for millions of kids to listen to..and miley who degrades herself on stage by rubbing her twat all over a man, married man at that who caused a divorce...should show the hypocrisy of Hillary Clinton.

1 | Christy Markel Potts | 1545744155445609_1545778432108848 | I wonder if the cops thought he would amBUSH someone...
2 | Aaron Race | 1545744155445609_1545778625442162 | Lol cops walk in circle around him thinking where to put the cuffs.
3 | Jf Kennedy | 1545744155445609_1545818805438144 | I tree there point. something was very bushy about this guys he didn't have a leaf to stand on when the cops came they chopped him down to size. sorry for the sappy jokes.
4 | Steve Lewis | 1545744155445609_1545925595427465 | I bet the charges will be dropped. Heck, little old ladies and men walk that slow crossing the street sometimes. Are the cops going to start busting them as well? :/
5 | Bob Maston Jr. | 1545744155445609_1545780962108595 | They should've just warned him to stay out of the street and left him alone.
6 | Sylvia North | 1545744155445609_1545976682089023 | Now that is absolutely ridiculous to get arrested for something like this.... seriously ? I see people dressed worse than that and they are allowed to walk around like that..... I think it's funny....
7 | Denise Hildreth Doggett | 1545744155445609_1546008075419217 | Oh I got what he was doing, checking the differences between people, and of course lets arrest him... life today is scary as it is, soon going to be afraid to walk outside and wave at the neighbor...
8 | Jen Sweet | 1545744155445609_1545996492087042 | come on cops should not be arresting people for this...this is what wrong with policing policies....always looking to fine, ticket or arrest....police rule need to change..
9 | Tj Bay | 1545744155445609_1546069765413048 | Ot ButWould you buy an Ivanka Trump dress from Macy's or Nordstrom's? Tell them.She is standing firm with her groper dad.Her line is made in China.Please pass this on. Let's  make These stores  take her cloths off the floor. They are  toxic.She should sell Trump repellant.Fyi  Trump hotels had a name change  due to big slow down. Now called Scion.  DON'T  be fooledGood news: Trump Tower residence are asking for his name to be removed from the building.They say it is very embarrassed to say where they live.Let's kill this brand.
10 | Branden Michalek | 1545744155445609_1546129605407064 | Dont you have murders to catch??? FuckmatterwithyerselfWhen WeThePeople Dissolve Government, policy enforcement will be able to focus on real issues.
11 | Elizabeth Simmons | 1545744155445609_1545996205420404 | Problem with mental health in America... everyone thinks it's funny, and this guy is another whack job roaming loose in society, annoying people and endangering himself with nonsense that only makes sense to him. Lock him up.
12 | TichPh Tran | 1545744155445609_1546147752071916 | The cop who stopped him wearing like an movable tree was necessary in his duty. Who knows if it was a terrorist?
13 | Barb Wagner Guay Bartley | 1545744155445609_1546219715398053 | Hmmm..I think most people would agree that it is unusual and should have been investigated as this person who is covered up could be concealing a threat to the surrounding area. You cannot identify the person! ..the same as burqas do! And the same as thief's ski masks do!
14 | Juan De Chile | 1545744155445609_1545780915441933 | First Clowns and now Trees. What next? Mad cups of coffee and piles of puke walking around?
15 | Shane Todd | 1545744155445609_1546078795412145 | So where is the tolerance? I mean he probably self identifies as a tree. Shouldn't the police be more respectful? I mean how insensitive. Self identified tree lives matter! He needs his own bathroom or better yet, does he self identify as a male or female tree? We need to make sure this tree is allowed into whichever bathroom it self identifies with. Omg, I said "it". How insensitive of me. I mean they. Is they gender neutral? I hope I didn't violate his feelings. Can we make a safe space for it. OH I DID IT AGAIN! I mean For "them" to go to. Maybe somewhere outside like a garden. They would like that being a tree and all. Wait, wait I'm stereotyping them. How insensitive of me. I need therapy to be more sensitive. Pray for me. OMG how insensitive of me, you might be atheist and I just asked you to pray for me. Im out
16 | George Polyak | 1545744155445609_1546135965406428 | So 1 person dressed as a tree gets arrested for walking slowly across a road, but it's OK for hundreds of people to block a highway for hours. Makes total sense to me
17 | James Chinadle | 1545744155445609_1545958298757528 | Obamaladen is as pathetic as the piece of garbage he endorses. I wonder how he feels about Hillary calling Muslims "Sand N*ggers"? To Hillary Mexicans are "Taco Bowls". Then the "Deplorables" and "Basement Dwellers". And of course, black people are "Super Predators" Maybe that's why Trump's rallies are massive and hers are pathetic.
18 | Gabriel Gonzalez | 1545744155445609_1545780175442007 | But if it was a black person screaming black lives matter the cops would just be standing there like IDIOTS!
19 | Richard Rogers | 1545744155445609_1545797042106987 | I advise Mr. Obama to get back to work. His job's not done yet. I'm tired of him wasting taxpayer money! They are doing the best they can to rig this election. That's not whining, that's common sense. It's still not working! Hillary Clinton has had her silence purchased by the Middle East. These countries have even purchased a 550% increase in the number of refugees that will be brought to America from her. Countries that marry 10 year old little girls off to men 4 times their age to be one of 4 or 5 wife's, these countries allow their women to be raped nightly by their husbands with no recourse, they throw gays off buildings, they burn witches, they drown people of different faiths, we are talking about countries that are still in the 13th century as far as human/civil rights are concerned. In addition to these atrocities, Hillary Clinton has also been the most controversial political figure of all time. She has sold the government. She has no product, she has no service, she sells the government. It has also been proven through released emails that she and her party are biased against Christians, Jews, Mexicans, African Americans, Patriots, or anyone that doesn't agree with her. She has been caught up in as many sexual scandals as anybody else I know. She helped to destroy those women's lives when they accused Bill of his transgressions. In short, get out of the political influence business. You too Family Guy or at least deal in an even-handed fashion. #familyguy #trump2016 #nobama
20 | Donald Tolbert | 1545744155445609_1545782942108397 | Dear Hillary Supporter, Did you miss the part where she lied to congress? You know that’s called perjury…. Did you miss hearing about her being fired from the Watergate staff for being dishonest and unethical?How about those 33,000 emails she deleted and then had the computer wiped clean by professionals? Did you miss that? How about deleting emails after she was subpoenaed to hand them over to the Fed? You realize that’s Obstruction of Justice, right? Oh, and how about getting the rapist of a teenage girl off on rape charges then laughing about it? Did you miss that too?How about when she lied to the American people about Benghazi? You realize that story about the video was a lie, and she knew it was a lie, right?Did you miss her lying to the American people about her emails? How about when she lied about being under sniper fire?Well, then there was those times she lied about lying to the American people. Miss those too?What about that ‘pay for play’ with the Clinton Cash Foundation? That’s kind of hard to miss, huh?Did you miss all those other scandals she was in? You know… TravelGate, FileGate, WhiteWater, Rose law Firm, Vince Foster… she has a long list of scandals, you know... Did you miss her belittling her husband's sexual harassment ( and rape ) accusers? Oh – but the Paula Jones case was settled for $850,000 and Bill was impeached… for lying…You know she was labeled "Extremely careless" about national security by the FBI, right? Have you caught her latest lies about not knowing what the (C) meant on the classified documents? Or, that she can’t remember any briefings on how to handle classified material? Did you know that during her interview with the FBI she said she couldn’t remember 39 times? Did you know that during the Star Investigation she used that same defense of ‘I don’t recall’ 56 times? Did you hear her say she will raise taxes on the middle class? Did you know she had to return stolen items from the White House the last time they left? Have you seen the movies and several documentaries made about her questionable ethics? Don’t you wonder why she made congress and others spend millions and millions of tax dollars having hearings and investigating her numerous times, finding that she lied, that would not have been spent if she would have simply told the truth in the first place ! Facts - all facts ! But you are going to vote for her because.... you don't like Donald Trump ? Now, That is insane !❤️🇺🇸❤️💯🚂💯‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️
21 | Mary Ann Arlotta | 1545744155445609_1545873515432673 | "...natural choreography"?, I think he means "reaction" . I'd be more interested in how dogs would have reacted to him.
22 | Dianna Baublit | 1545744155445609_1545804318772926 | Black lives matter has been blocking highways. Why aren't they arrested?
23 | Debby Haeussler | 1545744155445609_1545991112087580 | He should have won a black lives matter t-shirt over his costume he would have beaten the ticket
24 | John David Horman | 1545744155445609_1546021985417826 | What they were afraid of was his possible accomplices---he obviously eventually planned to "branch out".
25 | Norman Soper | 1545744155445609_1545946408758717 | Sooo, BLM can block highways and not get arrested but this guy by himself was? Lol. We are sooooo screwed as a society

The first LGBTQ superhero in Marvel's history, Northstar, was also part of the X-Men, and while his sexual orientation was hinted at in the early 1980s, it was not until 1992 that the character finally came out.

2 | Jeff Price | 1545764662110225_1545815988771759 | Iceman is not gay. I thought Deadpool would have been, but not iceman. Those confused about my comment, buy a NES and play mega man. Iceman was all for the ladies.

Kathleen Kane was convicted of illegally disclosing details from a grand jury investigation and lying about it under oath.

--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Don Warnick | 1545677968785561_1545679972118694 | ...if her last name was "Clinton" she would still be PA's Attorney General...
2 | Tonya England Linares | 1545677968785561_1545694502117241 | So tell me again why Hillary Clinton isn't in jail for lying under oath and destroying evidence??????????
3 | Dan Lawler | 1545677968785561_1545687935451231 | She should run for president! She's done much less that's illegal than Hillary!
4 | James S Vining | 1545677968785561_1545687178784640 | I hope she enjoys her jail time and suffers everyday... she should've thought about her children before she became hell bent on destroying her peers lives and careers.
5 | Derfla Erfnom | 1545677968785561_1545702938783064 | IMO:If you take time to read the article you will find what a huge corrupted ego can do to an entire state. She is possibly the most corrupt atty general any state has ever had. Should have thought about the kids before her crimes were committed. Here is the real KICKER- when you read the article you will think your reading a biography of Trump. They both have identical sick qualities and it shows the danger Trump would be to our nation. Her jail  term is way to short. Please be careful folks, Trump can ruin our nation quicker than she did her office and Pa. He is capable of even more brutality than she was.
6 | Raymond Popi Ruiz | 1545677968785561_1545753905444634 | This has nothing to do with thee presidential candidates it has to do with a corrupt attorney general  who's ego was her worst enemy let her suffer in prison wondering if her kids are OK
7 | Jennie Sinclair-Teegarden | 1545677968785561_1545697095450315 | Democrats really do not think the laws and rules apply to them, do they?!?!?  I am glad she is going to jail....there are a lot more of her party that need to join her!!!
8 | Hakim Muhammad | 1545677968785561_1545710192115672 | People make me laugh because they know both candidates are liars but if it's the one they support, they turn a blind eye to the truth. Fact Killary has done more to America at war with lies. Trump reveal America racism and brought it back to the surface, by removing the fig leaf and the tree they been hiding behind, and yes he a womanizer scum bag as well, stealing tax payers money to fund his projects while not paying any taxes himself, oh yeah this system is rigged Mr. Trump and Mrs.Clinton for the rich and prostitutes for corporate greed. Every vote should count and do away with electoral votes that effective cancel out the people's vote.
9 | Bill Katz | 1545677968785561_1545995065420518 | Reckon she thought Hillary would come to her defense..."birds of a feather". Well if she gets elected Kathleen Kane will no doubt receive White House amnesty...maybe even a cabinet postion.
10 | Jay Dobbs | 1545677968785561_1545700835449941 | How stupid can one be knowing that if caught everything hang's in the balance for her family over a stupid grudge and will more than likely lose her license to practice law .
11 | Crystal Draheim | 1545677968785561_1545888232097868 | It's bullcrap that she isn't in jail and got bail if it was a normal everyday person we wouldn't be given bail to be able to appeal we would have to appeal from inside the jail that's so not right that she gets special treatment
12 | Tony Lewis | 1545677968785561_1545715542115137 | How ironic... I wonder if she was willing to extend the leniency that she asked for to people she prosecuted? Lady, you made the wine, you drink a cup. I feel very sorry for her sons and her estranged husband. She ripped them off. :/
13 | Joyce Kinnie Lockhart | 1545677968785561_1545973202089371 | what is wrong with this Picture??!!!!  Hillary Clinton can destroy evidence and lie to Congress and the FBI and she is running for President of the United States!!  Come on our suppose to be Great government do your job and stop this corruption!!!  The only reason I can find for not doing your job is that you are in on it all!!
14 | Rickey Varner | 1545677968785561_1545720955447929 | Same justice being applied here should also be happen to Hillary clinton.I can not believe what I am seeing these days and times how someone like her can get away with much much much worse crimes and a lot also lying about it under oath nothing happens but this woman here is getting jail time.Trump is right about the system it needs a serious overhaul and repair job and he is the man to get the job done.Trump 2016!!!
15 | Jason Hand | 1545677968785561_1545716168781741 | Hillary Clinton lied under oath, why is it that she is not in Jail? I get it, we the people have to obey laws and when Queen Hillary and rapist Bill Clinton moves into the white house laws will not apply to them. If Hillary Clinton becomes our next president we are going to war. No Justice No Peace! if Hillary Clinton becomes our next president there is a very good chance that she will give the command to launch our Nuclear weapons towards Russia and she is crazy enough to do it.
16 | Mindy Musco | 1545677968785561_1545920978761260 | Gee, didn't HRC obstruct justice and lie and now is running for POTUS? I guess the law doesn't apply if your last name is Clinton.
17 | Ale Mehmedi | 1545677968785561_1545964752090216 | Neither has Trump so stop trying to make his comments about sexual assault a big deal! Bill Clinton did the acts of sexual assault yet no one cares and Hillary insulted the woman but never apologized where's the outrage your daughters future depends upon this right!!!

In that case, we should also diminish (or overlook completly) a Democrat office holder's crime because a Republican candidate is alleged to have done the same -- or worse. Is this where we are now?

25 | Roy Hein | 1545677968785561_1545822835437741 | Hillary Clinton is the personification of the establishment and status quo. She voted for the war in Iraq and supported the Iran nuclear deal, two of the worst, and most-dangerous mistakes in American foreign policy during my lifetime.Everywhere in the world America’s position is far worse now thanks in large measure to her actions as secretary of state. The whole saga of her private unsecure emails and server and the appearance of massive pay-for-play at the Clinton Foundation are also profoundly troubling. Wikileaks releases combined with the latest videos only add proof to the dishonest and corupt methods the Dems will go to in order to control Americans, hold power and enrich their pockets.Her domestic record is as bad as her international one. When Mrs. Clinton was elected to the Senate, she promised to create 200,000 new jobs in upstate New York. When she left office in January 2009, the region had a net loss of 8,000 jobs. Now she promises to create 10 million new jobs in the nation. Why should we believe that she will do that, based on her failed record in New York state?Hillary deducted $1,042,000.00 in charitable contributions from her taxes, $1,000,000.00 of those contributions went to The Clinton Foundation. She cut her tax bill by $1,000,000.00 by donating to herself.

18 | Brian Carter | 1545643022122389_1545715058781852 | BREAKING: UK Ambassador Comes Forward to EXPOSE Hillary’s Sick Debate Lie, Trump Was RIGHT!!!!The strategy of the Clinton campaign and the Progressive Left to discredit the incredibly damaging information coming out of WikiLeaks is to say that it is a Russian hack meant to influence the elections in the United States. This is a false narrative spin and we now have indisputable truth to prove it.In a posting on his website that is being picked up by social media, former UK Ambassador and human rights activist Craig Murray, who has established a rapport with WikiLeaks’ Julian Assange, states in no uncertain terms that the information about Clinton and her team coming from WikiLeaks is not coming from Russia. Further, he explains why the information isn’t a product of a computer hack. His statement destroys Hillary Clinton’s pathetic defense of her criminal activities.The DNC & Podesta material didn't come from any Russian sources - Craig Murray Fmr UK Ambassador https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2016/10/really-really-upset-foreign-office-security-services/ …#PodestaEmails13 10:25 AM - 20 Oct 2016With just 18 days left until the 2016 General Election, the information coming out of WikiLeaks, if properly covered in the media – mainstream, new and social – and explained to the voting population, will devastate Clinton’s campaign. It is information that proves crimes, collusion and corruption in and throughout the Clinton team and the Democrat Party.‘I left Julian after midnight,’ Murray said in a statement. ‘I can tell you with 100 percent certainty that it is not any Russian state actor or proxy that gave the Democrat National Committee and Podesta material to WikiLeaks. The claim is nonsense. Journalists are also publishing that these were obtained by ‘hacking’ with no evidence that this was the method used to obtain them.’This is bombshell information that proves both the legitimacy of the WikiLeaks emails and that the Russians had absolutely nothing to do with the exposure of the information. Murray’s statement demolishes the spin of the Clinton campaign used to deflect from the fact they have engaged in unethical and criminal activity.Murray called the manipulation of and collusion with the Democrat Party machinery by the Clinton team to be ‘a matter of great public interest.’ He characterized the coordinated efforts against the Sanders campaign as ‘deliberate’ and ‘unfair,’ declaring that they were meant – exclusively – to ensure Clinton’s victory over.Addressing the attempts to scapegoat the Russians for a ‘hack,’ Murray said that from the mainstream media on up to the Oval Office, attempts to ‘divert attention’ from the unethical and criminal acts executed by the Clinton campaign and the Democrat Party, repeated ad nauseum without any investigation, is a disgrace.Calling the notion that we must automatically ‘pretend Hillary Clinton is a saint’ emetic – defined as causing someone to vomit, Murry said WikiLeaks has done a ‘great service’ by making plain the collusive and unethical relationship between the Clintons and the huge-money political influencers of Wall Street.But Murray wasn’t done opening the eyes of the public to the deceptive practices of both the Clintons and the mainstream media. He explained that the information WikiLeaks has published doesn’t emanate from a ‘hack,’ as has been contended.‘The key point is that WikiLeaks is a publisher. It is a vehicle for publishingleaks, and is much more of a vehicle for whistleblowers than for hackers,’ Murray explained. ‘It does not originate the material.’This means that the information WikiLeaks is publishing is coming frominside the Democrat/Clinton apparatus! The emails being provided to WikiLeaks about the Clintons, the Democrat National Committee and the Obama Administration are coming from a leak inside the Clinton machine!I have no doubt that the mainstream media will continue to tout the false narrative being shopped by the Clintons and their sycophant operatives that this information is courtesy of a Russian hack. But if enough of us make an effort to get this information to the public, their deflections will fail and Hillary Clinton’s campaign will be fatally wounded.What do you think about Murray’s exposing the WikiLeaks information is from a Clinton insider, not a Russian hack?

1 | Eddy Delgado | 1545594935460531_1545600318793326 | Why any gay person supports Hillary is a mystery to me. She's bought and paid for by Muslim countries who kill gays, and she wants to bring in millions of Muslims into our country. I just don't get it.

I will vote Trump this election. Used to be a democrat, but done with them after Obama ruined this country. Time for a real change by having an outsider who will shake up Washington and make this country safe and great again. TRUMP will be the next POTUS. It will be a landslide, bet you.
3 | Taylor Seitz | 1545594935460531_1545614972125194 | I've never understood the existence of the Log Cabin Republicans, but at least they had the sense to dump this loser. It's true that Trump himself is a lot more open to LGBT equality than most Republicans (likely because he only halfheartedly pretends to be religious), but Pence is one of the most homophobic politicians in the country, and the 2016 Republican Party Platform is full of a nauseating stream of atrocities, from reversing constitutional rights to openly endorsing child abuse. Given that Trump/Pence is also anti-equality on almost every other issue, I'm glad to see LGBT citizens kicking their ticket to the curb.
4 | Terry Barton | 1545594935460531_1545660465453978 | Gay people are sick of being used as pawns in this election by Trump and his Deplorables.Most Americans have already made up their minds and I'm not interested in changing anyone's mind but as a gay American who won't be supporting Trump for all kinds of reasons!I find his running mate is as much insidious as the "Pussy Grabber"himself.The likes of Mike Pence and his rabid anti gay rightwinger Christian followers are actually similar to the Muslim extremists except for throwing us off of buildings although many have called for the execution of gay people and have gone to countries like Uganda to influence insidious anti-gay laws..If any community in this country has shown itself to be anti-gay, it is conservative Christians and their decades of peddling hatred for gay people, comparing homosexuality to pedophilia and bestiality, claiming AIDS is divine punishment, pushing “cures” for homosexuality, and blocking laws that prevent gays not just from marrying but from being discriminated against. A Christian pastor, who has enjoyed the company of Bobby Jindal, Mike Huckabee, and Ted Cruz, recently said that, according to the Bible, homosexuals “deserve the death penalty.” Now the very same people who recently were comparing trans people to predators who would use the wrong bathroom to hunt for child victims are suddenly  lining up to defend gays from the horrible Muslims.Deplorables seem to think that I'm too stupid to know that ISIS throws gay people off of buildings and only Trump can protect gay people in the U.S and that he has the best interest of the LGBT community at heart by choosing one of the most radicalized rabidly anti-gay rightwinger Christian politicians in the country who has quite a long history of oppression of the LGBT community.I realize that Hillary has not always supported gay marriage but most Americans had to warm up to the idea as well.I would rather support a candidate who really does have my best interest at heart than a con man who thinks he is telling gay people what we wan't to hear,all the while promising to appoint anti-gay rightwinger Christian SCOTUS judges like his running mate.The republican platform is clearly anti-gay which includes "pray away the gay" therapy as well as supporting "religious freedom laws" which basically gives anti-gay rightwinger Christians the freedom legally and openly discriminate,harass and oppress the LGBT community.I have already heard the automatic reply from deplorables that Hillary accepts money from Muslims countries that persecute gay people.I find it to be politically disingenuous that all of a sudden rightwingers especially rightwinger Christians who are the number one  enemy to the gay community here in the U.S all of a sudden are pretending to care about the gay community.I will also remind the Deplorables that Trump praises Putin and has ties with Russia where gay people are also persecuted.
5 | Josh Neiman | 1545594935460531_1545657178787640 | The fact that anyone part of the LGBT community can be apart of a party that is extremely hateful and bigoted towards them is just mind boggling. It's self hate is what it is. Why be apart of a party that wants to take away your rights and wants to discriminate against you? Trump really doesn't have your back when he wants to appoint conservative judges to the Supreme Court which means reversing marriage equality and making laws that discriminate against the LGBT community like being able to legally deny housing or being fired just for being gay. You know I think the Republican Party has some of the right ideas. But not the way they think with social issues. Their mindset on everything from a women's right to choose to marriage equality is outdated and needs to go the way of the dodo.
6 | Paige Collins-Richardson | 1545594935460531_1545600702126621 | This is why the election is rigged. Trump was right, is right. Soros has been planning this for 65+ years. It's an agenda Folks. #GetAClueBeforeItsTooLateRecall that Hillary Clinton did her college thesis on his writings and Barack Hussein Obama writes about him in his books.How to create a social state by Saul Alinsky:There are 8 levels of control that must be obtained before you are able to create a social state.The first is the most important.1) Healthcare — Control healthcare and you control the people.2) Poverty — Increase the Poverty level as high as possible, poor people are easier to control and will not fight back if you are providing everything for them to live.3) Debt — Increase the debt to an unsustainable level. That way you are able to increase taxes, and this will produce more poverty.4) Gun Control — Remove the ability to defend themselves from the Government. That way you are able to create a police state.5) Welfare — Take control of every aspect of their lives (Food, Housing, and Income).6) Education — Take control of what people read and listen to — take control of what children learn in school.7) Religion — Remove the belief in the God from the Government and schools.8) Class Warfare — Divide the people into the wealthy and the poor. This will cause more discontent and it will be easier to take (Tax) the wealthy with the support of the poor.Now, think...Does any of this sound like what is happening to the United States?

7 | Charles White | 1545594935460531_1545636765456348 | 1981 New Jersey governors race. Republicans had cardboard signs warning minority voters they would be subject to arrest were they to falsely vote. There were literally armed poll watchers--- off duty police, which aided and abetted in attempting to suppress the Black vote. Democrats sued and the Republicans--- RNC, was placed under a consent decree forbidding such voter suppression tactics through to December 2017. Were Donald Trump--- members of his supporters or goon squadron to attempt another 1981 bigoted stunt, Republicans consent decree would be extended through to 2025. Now a more perilous response to Donald Trump's pleas for his supporters to interfere with members of these urban communities might too be met with confrontation?

12 | Terry Barton | 1545594935460531_1545712375448787 | All of a sudden rightwingers and rightwinger Christians wan't to protect the LGBT community.Hahahahaha!!!  It's not like gay men haven't been aware that evangelical conservative Christian Republicanism is a threat to our health and safety. We've known that for what seems like forever. If it were up to us Pence would never have been Governor of anything.Pence has a long history of oppression of the LGBT community.Its not the Muslims who we are worried about.

14 | Theresa Salisbury | 1545594935460531_1545672298786128 | 1). Mrs. Clinton, when you were Secretary of State, why did you solicit contributions from foreign governments, (Muslim princes donated multi-millions and got favors in return) for the Clinton Foundation after you promised President Obama you would not?(2). Mrs. Clinton, "When you left the White House after your husband’s last term as president, why did you steal $200,000.00 worth of furniture, china, and artwork? And why did you tell the public that you ‘returned it’ when you only brought back $27,000 of it? (3). Mrs. Clinton, why do you and your husband claim to contribute millions of dollars to charity for a tax write off when it goes directly into your Clinton Foundation which only gives out 10% of the funds to charitable purposes and you pocket the balance to support yourself tax free? What does your daughter Chelsea do there for her 3 million dollar yearly salary? (4). Mrs. Clinton, why are you unable to account for 6 billion dollars of State department funds that seem to have disappeared while you were Secretary of State?(5). Mrs. Clinton why did you say you were broke when you left the White House, but purchased a 5 million dollar home, built an addition for the secret service, and charge the tax payers of the United States $15,000.00 a month for their rent, an amount that pays your the entire mortgage?(6). Mrs. Clinton why did you lie to the American people about the terrorist attack in Benghazi, but managed to tell the truth to your daughter that same night it happened?(7). Mrs. Clinton, why did you say, “I do not recall,” “I have no recollection,” and “I don’t know” 56 times while testifying under oath during the Starr investigations?(8). Mrs. Clinton, what really happened to Ron Brown when he was about to testify against you and your husband?(9). Mrs. Clinton what really happened to law partner Vince Foster? There is no way he committed suicide in Fort Marcy Park. The gun was found in his right hand, Vince Foster was left handed?VOTE Donald J. Trump For President!!!

What He says will happen, will indeed happen. You are worried about gay rights and complaining about equality for the same but I must ask why you do not use that same passion for those who are in uniform...right now the ones who reenlisted for the war are being told by the Pentagon the 15k re enlistment money needs to be returned....use your passion for that.....use your passion to demand Congress find the 6 billion Hillary lost as SOS and if it can not be found then make her repay but not those who are willng to give all.

20 | Jacob W. Smith | 1545594935460531_1545612712125420 | A good friend of mine that happens to also be black. Sent me this today and said this is the reason no one anywhere will ever convince him to vote for anyone in the democratic party. He will always vote republican. Because as he said.... "he will not be owned by democratic slave masters like his ancestors.""The Democratic Party was formed in 1792, when supporters of Thomas Jefferson began using the name Republicans, or Jeffersonian Republicans, to emphasize its anti-aristocratic policies. It adopted its present name during the Presidency of Andrew Jackson in the 1830s. In the 1840s and '50s, the party was in conflict over extending slavery to the Western territories. Southern Democrats insisted on protecting slavery in all the territories while many Northern Democrats resisted. The party split over the slavery issue in 1860 at its Presidential convention in Charleston, South Carolina.Northern Democrats nominated Stephen Douglas as their candidate, and Southern Democrats adopted a pro-slavery platform and nominated John C. Breckinridge in an election campaign that would be won by Abraham Lincoln and the newly formed Republican Party. After the Civil War, most white Southerners opposed Radical Reconstruction and the Republican Party's support of black civil and political rights.	JacksonThe Democratic Party identified itself as the "white man's party" and demonized the Republican Party as being "Negro dominated," even though whites were in control."

Trump poses no threat to gays and he has better plans for this country. Hillary just panders to you just like the other minorities. Deep down she hates you. Hell as exposed by wikileaks, she hates pretty much everyone.

25 | Brian Thomas | 1545594935460531_1545759378777420 | Hopefully once Trump wins he vows never to do any interviews with NBC, ABC, CNN, and every other mainstream media that has lied thru this election process. Make Fox News the sole interviewer for him.

Americans are opening their eyes and seeing how corrupt their party is. And those who can't see the light are too stupid and gullible to vote In their best interest.

I only hope that trump gets in and he will have to eat his words...sick of his lies

8 | Virgil Vovot Pineda | 1545567878796570_1545653515454673 | Why i voted for trump... because i wanted these policies!!!1. Middle Class Tax Relief And Simplification Act. An economic plan designed to grow the economy 4% per year and create at least 25 million new jobs through massive tax reduction and simplification, in combination with trade reform, regulatory relief, and lifting the restrictions on American energy. The largest tax reductions are for the middle class. A middle-class family with 2 children will get a 35% tax cut. The current number of brackets will be reduced from 7 to 3, and tax forms will likewise be greatly simplified. The business rate will be lowered from 35 to 15 percent, and the trillions of dollars of American corporate money overseas can now be brought back at a 10 percent rate.2. End The Offshoring Act Establishes tariffs to discourage companies from laying off their workers in order to relocate in other countries and ship their products back to the U.S. tax-free.3. American Energy & Infrastructure Act. Leverages public-private partnerships, and private investments through tax incentives, to spur $1 trillion in infrastructure investment over 10 years. It is revenue neutral.4. School Choice And Education Opportunity Act. Redirects education dollars to gives parents the right to send their kid to the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school of their choice. Ends common core, brings education supervision to local communities. It expands vocational and technical education, and make 2 and 4-year college more affordable.5. Repeal and Replace Obamacare Act. Fully repeals Obamacare and replaces it with Health Savings Accounts, the ability to purchase health insurance across state lines, and lets states manage Medicaid funds. Reforms will also include cutting the red tape at the FDA: there are over 4,000 drugs awaiting approval, and we especially want to speed the approval of life-saving medications.6. Affordable Childcare and Eldercare Act. Allows Americans to deduct childcare and elder care from their taxes, incentivizes employers to provide on-site childcare services, and creates tax-free Dependent Care Savings Accounts for both young and elderly dependents, with matching contributions for low-income families.7. End Illegal Immigration Act Fully-funds the construction of a wall on our southern border with the full understanding that the country Mexico will be reimbursing the United States for the full cost of such wall; establishes a 2-year mandatory minimum federal prison sentence for illegally re-entering the U.S. after a previous deportation, and a 5-year mandatory minimum for illegally re-entering for those with felony convictions, multiple misdemeanor convictions or two or more prior deportations; also reforms visa rules to enhance penalties for overstaying and to ensure open jobs are offered to American workers first.8. Restoring Community Safety Act. Reduces surging crime, drugs and violence by creating a Task Force On Violent Crime and increasing funding for programs that train and assist local police; increases resources for federal law enforcement agencies and federal prosecutors to dismantle criminal gangs and put violent offenders behind bars.9. Restoring National Security Act. Rebuilds our military by eliminating the defense sequester and expanding military investment; provides Veterans with the ability to receive public VA treatment or attend the private doctor of their choice; protects our vital infrastructure from cyber-attack; establishes new screening procedures for immigration to ensure those who are admitted to our country support our people and our values

It's an agenda Folks. #GetAClueBeforeItsTooLateRecall that Hillary Clinton did her college thesis on his writings and Barack Hussein Obama writes about him in his books.How to create a social state by Saul Alinsky:There are 8 levels of control that must be obtained before you are able to create a social state.The first is the most important.1) Healthcare — Control healthcare and you control the people.2) Poverty — Increase the Poverty level as high as possible, poor people are easier to control and will not fight back if you are providing everything for them to live.3) Debt — Increase the debt to an unsustainable level. That way you are able to increase taxes, and this will produce more poverty.4) Gun Control — Remove the ability to defend themselves from the Government. That way you are able to create a police state.5) Welfare — Take control of every aspect of their lives (Food, Housing, and Income).6) Education — Take control of what people read and listen to — take control of what children learn in school.7) Religion — Remove the belief in the God from the Government and schools.8) Class Warfare — Divide the people into the wealthy and the poor. This will cause more discontent and it will be easier to take (Tax) the wealthy with the support of the poor.Now, think...Does any of this sound like what is happening to the United States?

We're telling our daughters this is how they deserve to be treated.".... that's funny.

The higher likelihood for college-aged people to engage in reckless behavior heightens the danger of guns on campus, researchers at Johns Hopkins University said.

1 | Jeff Bowerman | 1545525348800823_1545528095467215 | it won't make anyone safer. Eventually, and more than once, some drunk frat boy, some jealous idiot or someone who's pissed about a low grade will take a bunch of people out.
2 | Gregg C Jones | 1545525348800823_1545527128800645 | NBC (national biscuit company) research....? Well they are not all that safe when the students are disarmed. There is a lot of rape on campus (NBC tells us so) and the girls aren't packing... How is that for research?
3 | Robert Smith | 1545525348800823_1545542822132409 | what research? Did some college already have a lot of guns on campus the last year or so to do research on? Or did they just guess at what might happen and then have a liberal college professor put a  stamp on it?
4 | Aaron Michael | 1545525348800823_1545535478799810 | Looks like these 'researchers' ignored the facts involving those who possess concealed weapon permits.   Not only are many required to receive training to get licensed but concealed carriers as a whole commit fewer crimes on average than police.
5 | Taylor Seitz | 1545525348800823_1545603555459669 | Just goes to show, the vast majority of anti-gun-control people are basing their arguments on primal emotion, not on substantive logic and evidence. Fear can indeed be a powerful motivator, but I'd much rather have my legislative and executive policies based on hard science, thank you very much.
6 | Paul R. Laska | 1545525348800823_1545530232133668 | So fear 19'year olds with guns, yet no one questions them with guns, tanks, bombs, and the uniforms of the US military. Perhaps it isn't the firearms, perhaps it is attendance at college that is the endangerment.
7 | Robert Eric Oberlies | 1545525348800823_1545614388791919 | 1) It's sad that a segment of the population lives in piss-pants fear, and needs to project that on the rest of us - when the majority of the people of the world think you're irrational nutters. 2) As I have experience with the weapon shown in the picture, I'll ask - What's with the backwards magazine? I've never seen that before (though I've been a civilian for 25 years now).
8 | Gregg C Jones | 1545525348800823_1545571745462850 | National Biscuit Comp.... Dummy! The girls are not armed. The rapist is not armed. Why would any rapist need a gun? It is a gun free zone. The girls are not armed. Even with trained police. This has been going on since the 1960 when guns were banned. Now if the girls are armed they could have an option to defend themselves.
9 | Steve Edgeller | 1545525348800823_1545526728800685 | Haha, if we'd had guns on campus, I'd have no fingers left at the very least.  Probably no friends left either.  It was bad enough with fireworks!
10 | Clarence Garrett | 1545525348800823_1545568952129796 | Really the gun argument on campus is wrong. When students have to walk on and off campuses, is when they need protection. Usually surrounding areas of campuses is where crime usually takes place. Students become targets because of electronics they have.
11 | Nosreb Kram | 1545525348800823_1545777718775586 | I'm shocked...To think, a bunch of folks walking around with the ability to play hero with the ability to kill at a moments notice somehow... Somehow, the people with this mindset walking around doesn't actually make people safer... Hmmm.... Imagine that...I wonder how we can get to a different place or line of thinking...
12 | Gabriel Sierra | 1545525348800823_1545536382133053 | Lawful carry wouldn't apply to most students on campus even if passed. For traditional students, only those that are seniors would be able to legally obtain a CCW permit. For those that would choose to get one, that demographic isn't the one that causes problems. And, those that are inclined to cause problems don't care what's lawful or not--those inclined to murder others don't care how many laws beyond "murder one" they break--it's just fluff charges after that.
13 | Dave El | 1545525348800823_1545852838768074 | Researchers from a university ie: liberal tuned snowflake kiddies.I ran a bar for 11 years and it was well known we all had protection. In that 11 years we were never robbed, but the 3 other local establishments were multiple times. That's research!
14 | Tesean Bond | 1545525348800823_1545764452110246 | OK First of all, what is college-aged? Well, the average age of today's college student is 25 years old. So lets not act like there will be a bunch of partying teens running around toting guns and being reckless.
15 | Sarah Trevor Popp | 1545525348800823_1545647895455235 | Honestly ask yourself  this question "Do you feel safer if you had a gun just in case someone else decided to use it to kill people that way you know you might be able to save not only your own life but someone else's?"
16 | Robert Bears | 1545525348800823_1545531932133498 | Only criminals need guns says NBC and Clinton...They also say the best way to be safe and not slaughtered is to stand behind the "no guns allowed" sign...what a load of sh!t
17 | Alan Brown | 1545525348800823_1545780592108632 | "But many believe that having more firearms around makes gun crime more likely." And many other delusional democrats believe Chicago's gun laws are a model for the world to follow. More Guns, Less Crime is a book by John Lott and he lays out a sound scientific & historical facts to back up his reasoning. Libtards, offer their opinions which cannot be backed up by history or science
18 | Dwayne Leggett | 1545525348800823_1546122955407729 | Only a American needs a gun to survive every day of their life. He needs a gun to watch his wife and threaten to kill her if she goes away. Point a gun at the doctor if a family member is dying. Go too school with books in one hand and the gun in the other hand. With not one law to protect the people who fear the gun owners. Teacher may have to eat a gun if she give out a F to the wrong student.
19 | Stevi Ragland | 1545525348800823_1545532665466758 | Well, yeah. You are giving sleep deprived, stressed out, and sometimes drugged/liqored up kids permission to carry highly dangerous weapons. I wouldn't trust them with guns.
20 | Joe Franklin | 1545525348800823_1545581592128532 | "More guns" isn't the problem. The problem is more guns in the hands of insecure manbabies (and a few womanbabies as well) brainwashed by thirty years of propaganda that's in and of itself the logical equivalent of the joke sign above the bar that reads "free beer tomorrow".
21 | Ryan M. Stuart | 1545525348800823_1545774042109287 | I will say this much, I hate going to classes knowing that I cannot defend myself if necessary like I can when I walk into practically any other place.
22 | Anthony Mckinnis | 1545525348800823_1545564455463579 | What really b they are saying they need guns on campus to protect the white future leaders no matter if they rape white women or black women the silent code of white America power
23 | Simon John Rimmer | 1545525348800823_1545533382133353 | Getting rid of Guns won't make a difference to America's culture of violence, When you have people like Biden say that they want to take Trump behind the school Gym and give him bashing, it says a lot about the culture of a country, where the need to settle minor tiffs with violence is prevelent, take away the guns and people will use knives, there will always be 101 ways to kill without a gun. America needs a reintroduction to what being Civilised means.
24 | Jc Hess | 1545525348800823_1545537998799558 | Obama celebrates dancing to“Hotline Bling”, while Veterans suffer. It takes a really sick person to tap dance on the heads of Veterans who answered the call of duty in Afghanistan and Iraq, only to be financially ruined by the government that sent them there. At least Hitler honored his troops, Obama dances while his administration tortures American Veterans by requiring them to repay signing bonuses 10 years later.
25 | Chris Galaxy | 1545525348800823_1546085585411466 | People are asking the wrong question. AR's have been available since the early 60's. The question should be; what has happened in present day society where people feel the need to commit mass murder?

10 | Sylvia Walker | 1545503015469723_1545536812133010 | Its obvious that she met a man. And he apparently has abducted her. Why would she be at a BRIDAL STORE??? Her phone was found there. Women need to stop being so anxious for men. This is common for women who guys are obessed with. You have to be careful these days. #PoorGirl
11 | Matt Bevacqua | 1545503015469723_1545508922135799 | Pretty sure she's known by something other than Buyonce's backup dancer. But, really, what's poor Buyonce gonna do without Backup dancer?
12 | Terrance Danley | 1545503015469723_1545575065462518 | She's going to move up with Satan with a ritual to get more fame and power...!!! She's busy becoming a witch like Beyoncé....!!! She'll be found alive and well...!!!
13 | Jackie Allen | 1545503015469723_1545511395468885 | Sounds like she was taking off to get married and wanted a sub for while she was gone
14 | Ariel Facey | 1545503015469723_1545519015468123 | Found her phone at a bridal shop? Deeply religious? I bet she got knocked up and had to get married quick but now is embarrassed and doesn't want to tell anybody. Sounds like she eloped either way.
15 | Tina Smith | 1545503015469723_1545507508802607 | Wtf is WRONG with the Trump Trolls on here???I am literally crying of laughter!
16 | Cara Craig-Tavenner | 1545503015469723_1545529938800364 | If she was a backup dancer for Beyoncé:hope Beyonce shows some concern / compassion, would hope "B" offers help in the efforts to find her or donates money towards a PI to find her alive & well. Prayers. Scary world we live in, people of all ages are being abducted and sold into sex trafficking! Prayers to her family🙏💙🙏
17 | Fabiana Spinelli | 1545503015469723_1545668012119890 | You know what everyone stop making accusations! She is a considered missing person, her family has no idea where she is - please be respectful! btw I met her when she lived in LA and she is a sweetheart with a Heart of gold!
18 | Jennifer Perez | 1545503015469723_1545779062108785 | I just solved the case. She was last at a bridal store. Then she says she will need someone to sub in for her. I would not be surprised or regret saying that I bet she is eloping somewhere and doesn't want anyone to know. That is my best guess. Hopefully, she is safe and that's really what has happened here.
19 | Stephannie Austin | 1545503015469723_1545535045466520 | Hope she is found safe. I don't understand the politics on here. We all have children.. It could be any of ours tomorrow. Time and a place for everything.
20 | Margaret Colbert | 1545503015469723_1545585195461505 | Her disappearance is shaking the dance community especially since they found the last missing dancers body in Hollywood Hills. I pray for her and family.
21 | Eva Laurio | 1545503015469723_1545520472134644 | Euphoric and acting odd. Mental breakdown? I hope all ends well.
22 | Lisa Ferro Friskey | 1545503015469723_1545965835423441 | Are you all really making comments about stretched wedding dresses? These are the strangest comments to ever hear regarding a missing woman. Like buying off the rack is shameful, oh how the dresses stretch...really? You women are nut jobs!
23 | Darlene Garner | 1545503015469723_1545767118776646 | When the landlord said she "did not seem well", what exactly did that mean? Are we talking mania/psychotic break/mental health disorder, suicide, kidnapping - what? This article should have been titled " How to be as vague as possible". I hope she is found soon & safe.
24 | Kimberly Aguilar | 1545503015469723_1546169742069717 | If she knew something was going to happen she obviously was willing to go,  and maybe her family didnt approve of what ever choices she was making, doesnt mean she was taken against her will. Hopefully she sees this announcement and what worry she caused and let someone know she is ok
25 | Stacy May | 1545503015469723_1545567778796580 | What does the friend who she left the message to say about it? They have to know something if she asked them to sub for her.. phone was found at a bridal store? Im thinking quick wedding cuz her family didnt agree with her choice? Either way I hope shes found safe!!

In just 10 minutes, Donald J. Trump went from citing a new "front page" report from the Wall Street Journal to attack Hillary Clinton to calling the press "thieves and crooks."
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Devin J Anderson | 1545480265471998_1545485748804783 | It's all the truth though. NBC come on, we are not that stupid! Some might be, but the majority of us do our research now. Clinton is a terrible person and we refuse to vote for her. So quit trying to stuff this in our face!
2 | Brian Alfano | 1545480265471998_1545482285471796 | He's crazy.Here goes Trump again! The system is rigged and broken! I guess when you know your gonna loose you need to start making excuses. I mean I'm sure a lot of people in power didn't want Obama to win but the people voted and he won. #crybabytrump
3 | Sharonda Y. Braxton | 1545480265471998_1545485575471467 | OMG, someone stick a pacifier in his mouth already! Jeezus cripes, I don't think I've heard that much crying from a hungry newborn! Suck it up Trumble butt! You brought all the bad press on yourself with your juvenile antics. Now you're paying the consequences. Stop playing the blame game already and grow up!!! I mean honestly, what SANE Presidential nominee goes on a three AM Twitter tirade?!?!
4 | Serafina Calise | 1545480265471998_1545487012137990 | He is broken, a broken record. Trump is in manic mode...this is the same system that made him a presidential nominee....or since its rigged did they buy / pay/bribe to get him republican nominee....did the republicans rig the votes.
5 | Monica Es | 1545480265471998_1545485155471509 | He's behind by 4 points!!! Not bad for a guy with ZERO political experience!!! Hills been doing this her whole life AND CANT LOCK IT UP! LOL
6 | M Hilal Arfeen | 1545480265471998_1545484508804907 | Donald trump supporters are intolerant and violent same as like their leader.Trump made them violent and give them a authority to abuse everyone if they against me and my party.Donald trump politics based on hate and divide communities in the US but he will be lose election and so no chance to get presidency.Trump is a loser
7 | Chris Scott | 1545480265471998_1545481555471869 | He has a point, the press are all crooks.  Every head of every network is linked to someone in the Democratic party.
8 | Dana Moren | 1545480265471998_1545483932138298 | Hillary and Michelle Obama say when Trump goes low they go high. If going high means rigging the primaries against Bernie and inciting violence at Trump rallies, I'd hate to see them go low
9 | Julius Bon-Griego | 1545480265471998_1545482535471771 | The temper tantrum of spiraling out of control Lmao oh man, the next two weeks are going to be so long for Trump Supporters. Come on guys, don't be shy, where are your hashtags!
10 | Mathew Faircloth | 1545480265471998_1545495558803802 | No offense to all you Clinton supporters, but is he wrong? Every piece of hearsay against him is blown up in the media, yet all the hard, factual evidence is ignored for Hillary? Hard evidence has come out today both that trump paid 40m in taxes in 2013 plus about 10% that went to charity, and that's not covered. This piece by NBC is covering trumps reaction to factual evidence that a FELONY has been committed and it's being pushed aside. But it's all over the news that 10 women say he did something to them, and 1 of them was even factually tied to have been paid by the Clinton campaign, and that's not covered. Love him or hate him, you can't deny that.
11 | Steve Moriarty | 1545480265471998_1545484255471599 | I could have made a fortune if I invested in blinders for his followers and crying towels for what is to happen in the next two weeks.
12 | Steven Rinde | 1545480265471998_1545513105468714 | Trump is right. Hillary, some of the top democrats, and not a few members of the media belong in prison. Hillary Clinton is a criminal and a liar and hardly any reporting has been done on her crimes. She could be outed as the Antichrist (possible) and some of you here would still praise her.
13 | Tammy Turner | 1545480265471998_1545487165471308 | Because the media is in fact corrupt! Stop focusing all the negative attention on Trump and start reporting on Clintons astounding illegal activities past and present during her 30 year career! She is as corrupt as the media!
14 | Jill Whitehead Stokes | 1545480265471998_1545487745471250 | You are thieves and crooks. You've destroyed true journalism. No matter who you vote for the people of the United States of America have lost all respect for you.
15 | Matthew Howell | 1545480265471998_1545491138804244 | He talks about reports from outside sources, such as wikileaks and project veritas...Not the constant NBC and CNN pro-Hillary news feed. Just look at your comments section. Everyone knows the DNC owns you.
16 | Chris Fagan | 1545480265471998_1545488462137845 | There are plenty of lunatics like Trump in the country and they typically only have a voice on right-wing nutjob websites and obscure blogs in the crazy corners of the internet. We seriously need to stop giving national coverage to this radical buffoon.
17 | Shelia Grigsby Irby | 1545480265471998_607271182793748 | It is unfortunate that Trump has needed to point out the bias in the media. The facts are: Nixon was forced to resign rather than face impeachment over a 20 minute "missing" tape; Hillary deleted, bleached 35,000 emails and took hammers to blackberries; Hillary has paid agitators to stir up violence at Trump rallies. These are not crude words. These are crimes. Has the media put any pressure on her? Matt Lauer did. It has been leaked that she was going to make sure he never had another job. Where is the outrage? Hillary is so corrupt that the whites of her eyes look like mud. Why shouldn't Trump tell the truth about the media?
18 | Gary D Laws | 1545480265471998_1545485508804807 | Even the most objective among us see how you write the headlines, interpret information and leave out important information in your reporting. No regard for the truth.
19 | Taylor Seitz | 1545480265471998_1545492118804146 | Proof that Trump's latest conspiracy is completely intellectually bankrupt. You can't attack every media source you disagree with as "rigged," yet every source that conveniently agrees with you is automatically true despite a lack of credible evidence. It's just like Trump screamed "Look at the polls!" when he was winning the primaries, but as soon as he's losing, suddenly all the polls are "phony." Ya can't have it both ways, Donald, and the American people are getting real tired of your lies and scams.
20 | Benjamin Hunt | 1545480265471998_1545517445468280 | I find it funny that Democrats are usually the ones who have no job and are living off government assistance. If you have no job and are getting paid by the government, why do Hillary campaigns have less people than a 7-Eleven parking lot?
21 | Tj Bay | 1545480265471998_1545487955471229 | Ot ButWould you buy an Ivanka Trump dress from Macy's or Nordstrom's? Tell them.She is standing firm with her groper dad.Her line is made in China.Please pass this on. Let's  make These stores  take her cloths off the floor. They are  toxic.She should sell Trump repellant.Fyi  Trump hotels had a name change  due to big slow down. Now called Scion.  DON'T  be fooledGood news: Trump Tower residence are asking for his name to be removed from the building.They say it is very embarrassed to say where they live.Let's kill this brand.
22 | Paula Drew | 1545480265471998_1545498745470150 | In June of last year, Trump entered the race for president. In just a little over a year, Trump has single handedly defeated the Republican party. He did so thoroughly. In fact, he did so in such a resounding way that the Republican Party now suffers from an identity crisis. He literally dismantled the party. Trump even dismantled and dismissed the brand and value of the Bush family.Trump has Obama petrified that Trump will dismiss programs that weren’t properly installed using proper law.Trump has single handedly debunked and disemboweled any value of news media as we knew it—news now suffering from an all-time level of distrust and disrespect.Trump has leaders from all over the world talking about him, whether good or bad. Trust me, powerful men who have been president before weren’t liked by the global community. I doubt Mikhail Gorbachev liked Reagan when Reagan said, "Tear down that wall."Trump has expressly disclosed the fraud perpetrated on the American public by Hillary Clinton. He has, quite literally, brought Hillary to her knees—if you believe that nervous tension and disorders offer physical side effects and damage.Trump has unified the silent majority in a way that should be patently frightening to “liberals.”As the press accuses Trump of being a house of cards, Trump has proven the press is the real house of cards. He has whipped up the entire establishment into pure panic. Trump has exposed them for who they are and worse, what they are. George Clooney was right when he said Trump draws live news coverage of his podium that he’s not yet approached. Thanks, George, you were perfectly correct.What we see as headline news today are actually the last bubbles from the ship that is now sunk—meaning the standard news media, as a propaganda machine, has been exposed. They have no more value.In the same way Trump asked the African-American community this question, I asked my friend, ”At this point, what do you have to lose?” We have mass cop shootings, riots in our streets, ambushed cops, double digit inflation, bombs blowing up in our cities, targeted police, #BLM, a skyrocketing jobless rate, no economic growth, privately owned land being seized by the federal government, the worst racial tension in my lifetime, no God in schools, more abortions than ever, illegal aliens pouring into our country, sick veterans receiving no care, and a debt that doubled in seven years to $19 trillion. Are you really happy with the condition of the current system?One man has done all of this in one year—TRUMP -- one guy, and on his own dime! And with everything I’ve written above, you believe Trump hasn't done anything? People claim that are are afraid of Donald Trump? No wonder we’re in trouble. They can say that Trump is a lousy presidential candidate. That’s their right. They can't ever say he’s not effective.That Megan Kelly, FOX News, CNN, MSNBC, Washington Post, Rachel Maddow, the Huffington Post, the New York Times, Raleigh’s News and Observer, the AP, Don Lemon, Jake Tapper, and many more, failed to implement their collectively orchestrated lie on the American people against Trump, is actually a massive testament to Trump. The press colluded pure propaganda to accomplish his demise … and they have collectively failed and miserably.Here's just one example of how badly America is injured right now. There are high school football players on their knees during the national anthem simply because the press used as propaganda to program those kids to do that very thing. But, these kids are mimicking NFL stars the same way the same kids chooses which brand of football shoe to purchase—they're overtly brain-washed to do that very thing.Now, we have a generation of children who hate America.America’s problem isn’t that little children are on their knee in collective disrespect of America. Our problem is that America is on her knee from collective disrespect by Americans.You can disrespect America all you want. But, it’s high-time you respect the silent majority. Because they’re not simply the “silent majority” as you’ve been trained to believe when Hillary calls them “deplorables.” The fact is, they are simply the majority. And now they're no longer silent either. Donald Trump changed all of that, single-handedly and within one year.

Among the states, there are 31 Republicans, 18 Democrats, and 1 independent that hold the office of governor."  As states are in charge of their own states elections, and the majority of states are governed by a republican, then Trump is saying that all of these governors are fixing the election to favor Hillary.
24 | Uchenna Oguekwe | 1545480265471998_1855543227999013 | That's Trump logic for you. Him and his supporters say that the media doesn't report on anything negative about Hillary Clinton, but when asked how they know about them, they tell you the news. WTF is wrong with them?!
25 | Danny Babcock | 1545480265471998_607274432793423 | I've watched five (CBS) “Live”, full telecasts of Trump rallies, and what I saw was a Lunatic in action! Wow! Trump is absolutely insane.... get the net! Wow... he's come unglued! Add to that, Trump's starting his Excuses Phase right now. He knows he's in trouble, so it's the Media, it’s the Clintons, it’s the Establishment, his shorts are too tight, those lying women and it’s the rigged and corrupt system that's doing it to Trump. If elections could be rigged, the GOP sure as hell wouldn’t have Trump as their nominee right now. If the Democrats could rig elections why are the House and Senate in Republican control?  LOL! What an Absolute fool... he is listening to the voices coming to him on the aluminum foil receiver in his red hat.

At the time of the incident, traffic in the area had slowed because of utility work ahead, officials said.

I guess they will stop with the foolishness when one of their family members die in a horrific accident as described in this story. Please have a heart people. All of these people belonged to someone.
2 | Alicia Wise Ratliff | 1545464475473577_1545485708804787 | Traffic laws need to include that if you are going below the minimum speed on a highway, usually 40, then you turn on your hazard lights. Some truckers do this as do I.
3 | Nick Greathart | 1545464475473577_1545621665457858 | Did anyone notice that all of the people on the bus were hispanic and had falsified identification?  I wonder who paid for the charter? Sorry for the loss of lives?
4 | Jc Hess | 1545464475473577_1545538852132806 | Obama celebrates dancing to“Hotline Bling”, while Veterans suffer. It takes a really sick person to tap dance on the heads of Veterans who answered the call of duty in Afghanistan and Iraq, only to be financially ruined by the government that sent them there. At least Hitler honored his troops, Obama dances while his administration tortures American Veterans by requiring them to repay signing bonuses 10 years later.
