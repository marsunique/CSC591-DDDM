Searches for the word spiked 120,000% over the hourly average after Donald J. Trump used the phrase "bad hombres" during the debate.

2 | Shannon Humphrey | 10153995750055950_10153995757395950 | Excellent job Chris Wallace. Nice to see a fair moderator for once and not some CNN liberal jackass.
3 | Sue Crockford-Peters | 10153995750055950_10153995772180950 | And I'm one of them. Not being a speaker of Spanish, I wanted to know what the actual definition is. Apparently, it means "man," with no pejorative or positive connotation.
4 | Brett Scott | 10153995750055950_10153995763885950 | Racist Americans searching for an hombre so they can make a meme making fun of Trump while using a latino to do it...seems right.
5 | Alice Gerard | 10153995750055950_10153995770060950 | It seems that Trump actually said "hambre," which means "hungry."
6 | Anthony Trotto | 10153995750055950_10153995751945950 | Trump will do nothing! Please take ur head out of stupid ass! Thank you....... From we the Blue people of America.. Oh and polls show he lost...
7 | Aaron Thiel | 10153995750055950_10153995758680950 | Hillary turned into a stuttering mess that couldn't control the volume of her voice. Could you imagine her negotiating with a hostile Putin with WWIII hanging in the balance? Hillary is in over her head and she knows it. This isn't the peaceful world her husband seen during his presidency and it scares the crap out of her.

4 | Joseph J Martin | 10153995690185950_10153995699660950 | She avoided a lot of the questions by answering with something that sounds smart but doesn't actually answer the question.  30 years of experience and some people still buy her bs. She could cook a live puppy in boiling water and some people would still come back with "oh, well Donald Trump is racist etc.
5 | Gregory Audette | 10153995690185950_10153995712225950 | The level of collusion, corruption and illegal coordination between the Obama Whitehouse, DOJ , Hillary Clinton and the DNC is staggering !!!  Couple that with the extreme liberal bias of the media flooding the airways with negative accusations about Trump while giving Hillary a pass on criminal violations is disgusting !!  America is in moral decline !!

19 | Sergey Malovatov | 10153995690185950_10153995693970950 | The Sad True Story of Hillary ClintonThis is the sad but true story of Hillary Clinton: Hillary Clinton and her husband got very used to their luxurious life style while Bill was the President.However, after his presidency had ended, Bill Clinton having being disbarred for perjury, the Clintons could not continue in their luxurious habits. They could not practice law any longer, so Bill and Hillary Clinton decided to use their political connections to make real big money. They started lobbying the interests of the big banks and corporations!That is why Bill Clinton became the proponent of the notorious financial deregulation movement that eventually destroyed US economy. Bill and Hillary Clinton helped the largest banks have US financial industry essentially deregulated, which resulted in the 2008 financial crisis. The bankers were happy and the Clintons could enjoy the privileges of the upper class. From then on, Hillary Clinton dedicated her life to representing the interests of the big banks and corporations in exchange for money that initially was given to her and Bill in the form of payments for their speeches (hundreds of thousands of dollars per speech). When bigger money became involved, they created their family Clinton Foundation and the money started pouring into it in the form of donations. Her criminal interactions had to be covered up, though. So, HRC was using her private email servers for that purpose while she was serving as secretary of state. That is why later, after the beginning of the Congressional investigation of their activities, the Clintons deleted all those emails, many of which contained government classified information, as they were directly incriminating Hillary Clinton in many shady dealings including selling access to the US Government to their rich foreign donors through the Clinton Foundation. Now, her corrupt friends from among the bankers and certain corporations are trying to use the mainstream news media to make her president, as Hillary Clinton has promised to continue to further consolidate the economic interests of certain private corporations with the political interests of the US Government. The corporate interest groups and the media are trying to make her look good and sound experienced. But in reality Hillary Clinton is not good and she has never been good at anything. Hillary Clinton is very corrupt. She has been corrupt all along. That was the only way she and her disbarred husband could have made such big money to support their lavish life style that they so got used to. However, Hillary and Bill Clinton have gone too far.She sold government contracts and political influence to the highest bidder, which of course were the biggest banks and largest corporations that ravaged the country and caused the financial and economic crisis in the US and the world over! Her corruption threatens to destroy US economy and the very existence of the union. Incompetent as a state official and immensely corrupt as a career politician, HRC is not fit to be president by any measure! She is too dishonest, too corrupt, and too selfish and irresponsible to occupy the most demanding position in the world. HRC is simply a conduit for pouring more corporate money into the US government to make it responsible only to the biggest corporations and the biggest banks in the US and abroad. If Hillary Clinton was to be elected president of the United States, the American people and the nation as such would be completely neglected and left to ruin!
20 | Terry Ridley | 10153995690185950_10153995697755950 | TOP SECRET EMAILS ..GOES UP TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER ..
21 | Rebecca Laskey | 10153995690185950_10153995707585950 | HARVARD HAS BROKEN A 128-YEAR OF VOTING REPUBLICAN, BECAUSE OF TRUMP!Dear Members and Alumni,In every presidential election since 1888, the members and Executive Board of the Harvard Republican Club have gathered to discuss, debate, and eventually endorse the standard-bearer of our party. But for the first time in 128 years, we, the oldest College Republicans chapter in the nation, will not be endorsing the Republican nominee.Donald Trump holds views that are antithetical to our values not only as Republicans, but as Americans. The rhetoric he espouses ‚Äìfrom racist slander to misogynistic taunts‚Äì is not consistent with our conservative principles, and his repeated mocking of the disabled and belittling of the sacrifices made by prisoners of war, Gold Star families, and Purple Heart recipients is not only bad politics, but absurdly cruel.If enacted, Donald Trump‚Äôs platform would endanger our security both at home and abroad. Domestically, his protectionist trade policies and draconian immigration restrictions would enlarge our federal deficit, raise prices for consumers, and throw our economy back into recession. Trump‚Äôs global outlook, steeped in isolationism, is considerably out-of-step with the traditional Republican stance as well. The flippancy with which he is willing to abdicate the United States‚Äô responsibility to lead is alarming. Calling for the US‚Äô withdrawal from NATO and actively endorsing nuclear proliferation, Donald Trump‚Äôs foreign policy would wreak havoc on the established world order which has held aggressive foreign powers in check since World War II.Perhaps most importantly, however, Donald Trump simply does not possess the temperament and character necessary to lead the United States through an increasingly perilous world. The last week should have made obvious to all what has been obvious to most for more than a year. In response to any slight ‚Äìperceived or real‚Äì Donald Trump lashes out viciously and irresponsibly. In Trump‚Äôs eyes, disagreement with his actions or his policies warrants incessant name calling and derision: stupid, lying, fat, ugly, weak, failing, idiot ‚Äìand that‚Äôs just his ‚Äúfellow‚Äù Republicans.He isn‚Äôt eschewing political correctness. He is eschewing basic human decency.Donald Trump, despite spending more than a year on the campaign trail, has either refused or been unable to educate himself on issues that matter most to Americans like us. He speaks only in platitudes, about greatness, success, and winning. Time and time again, Trump has demonstrated his complete lack of knowledge on critical matters, meandering from position to position over the course of the election. When confronted about these frequent reversals, Trump lies in a manner more brazen and shameless than anything politics has ever seen.Millions of people across the country are feeling despondent. Their hours have been cut, wages slashed, jobs even shipped overseas. But Donald Trump doesn‚Äôt have a plan to fix that. He has a plan to exploit that.Donald Trump is a threat to the survival of the Republic. His authoritarian tendencies and flirtations with fascism are unparalleled in the history of our democracy. He hopes to divide us by race, by class, and by religion, instilling enough fear and anxiety to propel himself to the White House. He is looking to to pit neighbor against neighbor, friend against friend, American against American. We will not stand for this vitriolic rhetoric that is poisoning our country and our children. President Reagan called on us to maintain this, our shining city on a hill. He called on us to maintain freedom abroad by keeping a strong presence in the world. He called on us to maintain liberty at home by upholding the democratic process and respecting our opponents. He called on us to maintain decency in our hearts by loving our neighbor.He would be ashamed of Donald Trump. We are too. This fall, we will instead focus our efforts on reclaiming the Republican Party from those who have done it considerable harm, campaigning for candidates who will uphold the conservative principles that have defined the Republican Party for generations. We will work to ensure both chambers of Congress remain in Republican hands, continuing to protect against executive overreach regardless of who wins the election this November.We call on our party‚Äôs elected leaders to renounce their support of Donald Trump, and urge our fellow College Republicans to join us in condemning and withholding their endorsement from this dangerous man. The conservative movement in America should not and will not go quietly into the night.A longtime student of American democracy, Alexis de Tocqueville once said, ‚ÄúAmerica is great because she is good. If America ceases to be good, America will cease to be great.‚Äù De Tocqueville believed in the United States. Americans are a decent people. We work hard, protect our own, and look out for one another in times of need, regardless of the color of our skin, the God we worship, or our party registration. Donald Trump may not believe in that America, but we do. And that America will never cease to be great.HILLARY CLINTON CANNOT TAKE AWAY SECOND AMENDMENT GUN RIGHTS WITHOUT APPROVAL OF CONGRESS.  HILLARY DOES NOT WANT TO ABOLISH YOUR 2ND AMENDMENT.  ANOTHER TRUMP LIE.AMERICA IS ALREADY GOOD AND WE ARE BETTER THAN DONALD TRUMP!REGISTER AND VOTE BLUE UP AND DOWN THE BALLOT.1st DEBATE ~ EPIC FAILURE ON DONALD TRUMP‚ÄôS PART!  AND THIS GUY WANTS TO BE PRESIDENT???  I DON‚ÄôT THINK SO!  HILLARY CLEARLY WON THE DEBATE, HANDS DOWN!!!#NeverTrumPutin#NoTaxesNoVote#NeverTrumpPence

The last presidential candidate to not release his tax returns was Gerald Ford, in 1976. More fact-checking from tonight's debate:
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Nicole Blasi Field | 10153995529790950_10153995537375950 | And fact check- she's the only one running for president who couldn't pass a criminal background check.
2 | Nicole Blasi Field | 10153995529790950_10153995535370950 | Fact check on emails? Bengazhi?  Ohh the basis media.
3 | Anna Larson | 10153995529790950_10153995550230950 | The questions you are asking right now to the focus group on the debate is unfair and unbiased they are all Democrats. This is nothing but dictatorship to American citizens.
4 | Kim Hargrove Adams | 10153995529790950_10153995617370950 | I just want to say that after watching them for years, I have lost all respect for CBS News. They have don't nothing but turn this presidential campaign into a Trash Trump Campaign. I haven't watched the debates, but the way CBS is putting it out there you would think Hillary Clinton is flawless!!! They have absolutely nothing bad to say about her and yet they have picked up on every little thing that Trump may have said that may have been meant toward something that may been...... Get real!!
5 | Sher Stahl | 10153995529790950_10153995583660950 | It is legal to make millions and not pay taxes. It's called write offs. Business owners, entrepreneurs, farmers, automotive industries and dealerships do it...money used to grow your business, or money donated to legal non-profit organizations, etc., it is 100% legal and helps us grow. If she doesn't like it, she should have fought to change it. Of course that will cost her supporters millions, so that will never happen. Instead, she will go after the middle class to create an even wider divide. CBS- why do you point out the fact that Donald did not agree to support her should he lose the election? Did you miss the part where she never agreed either? It sure would be nice to have a news source that reports facts instead of one-sided bs. I feel for those who rely on the media to make their decisions. More importantly, I feel for the rest of us who have to live with those decisions.
6 | Jay Duch | 10153995529790950_10153995566610950 | Forget who did whatever in the past or who you are rooting for. I just don't think were unified as a country if the presidential candidates can't even shake each other's hand. What doe's that show to kids who should learn respect and manners no matter what. Plus you should always congratulate the winner. If our future President can't show respect to one another then I don't know what to say when people say this generation  has lost respect! these candidates are much older and I didn't see respect for one another from the beginning to the end. It's not hard to shake a persons hand to show good gesture.
7 | Kyle J. Heuerman | 10153995529790950_10153995574990950 | You could have a hay day fact checking the liar Hillary. But wait your network is clearly bias. HILLARY should be in prison. PERIOD!!!!!!
8 | Floresa Williams | 10153995529790950_10153995643765950 | Ford was appointed not elected. And it WAS 40 years ago that he was a candidate; he lost the election to Jimmy Carter in 1976. You have to fact check the fact checkers now a days. LOL
9 | Jim Moon | 10153995529790950_10153995715290950 | I honestly used to love cbs news. Now I only see you as one among so many other corrupt news agencies. Try telling the truth rather than the opinion of your president. You are reporters. Act like it,
10 | KevinKelly GladysSmith | 10153995529790950_10153995657995950 | While others fact check, Trump Fat checks.....just a few weeks ago up all not tweeting that Miss Universe is Fat, as if that is an issue facing poor and middle income America.  Keep on Fat checking Mr Trump, we don't care who is a 4 or a 6 or a 10 or which woman you say is a fat pig. We are concerned about real issues.  While CBS fact checks, Trump Fat checks.
11 | Don Poyas | 10153995529790950_10153995665370950 | Chris Wallace didn't ask about ObamaCare, law and order, the inner cities, school vouchers, FBI quid pro quo, sanctuary cities, Benghazi. Stop dithering over whether Trump wants to support Clinton. Al Gore sued when he lost! Trump wins our vote.
12 | Robin Trent Anderson | 10153995529790950_10153995587380950 | Again just another easy way out for Killary not answering for her lies!!!  It was so easy for her to get by without answering the question about Bill's treatment of women too!!!
13 | Ben Swinson | 10153995529790950_10153995554480950 | Obama is the first President in history to not have one year with GDP averaging 3% and that's after Trillions printed .. Fact ..
14 | Jenn Hoffman | 10153995529790950_10153995656660950 | Did Hillary seriously give out CLASSIFIED information AGAIN? This time to the WORLD! It takes roughly 4 minutes to launch a nuclear attack once the button is pushed?? Seriously?!?! She can't keep classified information and people want her as POTUS? Wow!
15 | Ronnie Miller | 10153995529790950_10153995655925950 | Most shocking statement of the third debate: National debt is 70% of GDP. The only way to bring that down is by growing the gross domestic product(GDP). When Regan was president it was 4%. GDP is the monetary value of all the finished goods and services created in the United States. Without jobs our nation is doomed and I'm not a gloom and doomer. I've only been alarmed once before when I read the book "Conquer the Crash" in early 2000s. He said the banks would collapse and they did.We need to stop exporting jobs out of the country. I use to support all free trade treaties. I was wrong. I Love cheep stuff from China and Mexico but it it's sort of like fast food. Taste great but it clogs the arteries.

She's on record that a baby is not alive even at 32 weeks, so its ok to kill them...My wife and i are expecting and she scares rhe Hell out of us!Major Robert Jonas,Ph.d
19 | Jamie Mc | 10153995529790950_10153995627075950 | Does anyone seriously think that a business man will win in a debate against a career politician, lawyer, and debater? Trump held his own just fine.....
20 | Robin Barron | 10153995529790950_10153995656015950 | Hillary Really hit a Nerve with me when she was pushing back on Trump about abortions late term for health of mother. Late term would be C section for health of mother and child. Father God, save America from Hillary Clinton. #TrumpPence

Here is a list of those things:Taxes, Personal Income pay forHealthcare; National Defense; Job and Family Security; Net Interest; Veteran's Benefits; Education and Job Training; Immigration, Law Enforcement, and Administration of Justice; International Affairs; Natural Resources, Energy, and Environment; Science, Space, and Technology Programs; Agriculture; Community, Area, and Regional Development; Response to Natural Disasters; Additional Government Programs

Hillary Clinton slams Donald J. Trump for constantly calling systems "rigged." "There was even a time when he didn't get an Emmy for his TV program 3 years in a row, and he started tweeting that the Emmys were rigged against him..." "I should've gotten it," Trump interrupts: http://cbsn.ws/2dryztQ

11 | Rob Swart | 10153995483420950_10153995621470950 | Trump must be defeated by such a large margin that his supporters get the clear message that his hedge on insurrection if he loses would be suicidal!!!!! Stand up for our Democracy. Trump is the only person who refuses to accept the verdict of the people. Just suggesting this should bring charges of treason. God save America.
12 | Angel Christopher | 10153995483420950_10153995551705950 | Hillary is a liar and straight shit she has rigged it but not just her bill and Obama  go back and listen to the debate between her and Obama he says the same thing 8 years ago that trump is saying now think about it the ones against her then is her biggest supporters it's all about keeping Obama in the White House we have to stop this just saying

15 | Gregory Audette | 10153995483420950_10153995705510950 | The level of collusion, corruption and illegal coordination between the Obama Whitehouse, DOJ , Hillary Clinton and the DNC is staggering !!!  Couple that with the extreme liberal bias of the media flooding the airways with negative accusations about Trump while giving Hillary a pass on criminal violations is disgusting !!  America is in moral decline !!
16 | Nancy Wickline | 10153995483420950_10153995584415950 | A of cbs reporting Is for Hillary  and frys Trump. It's proves his point of a bias media. You are rigging the results. Told from your bosses what to say. I watch FOX they have people from both sides. Chris Wallace is proof of that. If you think Hillary does jhave a person on her side on FOX Just ask Juan
17 | Shelley Brown | 10153995483420950_10153995587135950 | This debate system was rigged from day one even before 9 women crawled out of the darkness Hilary created and watching the videos of her campaign people about violence and voter fraud who would believe in our voting system , let's face it people looking at all Hilary's scandals and corruptness what are you thinking why would you vote Hilary !!???!?!
18 | Yecenia Lahoz | 10153995483420950_10153995568220950 | I feel that I need to vote for this election but a bit undecided. Would like to hear from people's opinion on who they prefer without disparaging either candidates. Please no profanity. Thanks.

20 | Christina Golightly | 10153995483420950_10153995689485950 | I don't think trump should be running anything. ..he talks bad about my race and women in general ...a woman can do just as much as a man can and more. ..he is trying to,clean up his act bout the stuff he said but he can't...goo Clinton u got my vote
21 | Betty Klemovitch | 10153995483420950_10153995597795950 | There's truth to voter fraud/rigging. It's been a common complaint and proven that their has been voter fraud for a very long time. And you know that's true. I remember news broadcasts questioning how dead people voted. And to blindly accept what the media says now that this is untrue, would be gullible or naive on your part.
22 | Jack Shayle | 10153995483420950_10153995769735950 | I was very happy that Mr. Trump brought up concerns about the voting process. If a company doesn't regularly look at it's process to ensure it's healthy, it gets sick. Some are saying it's sacrilegious to question and doubt the voting process when there is strong evidence there is a problem. Questioning the process of democracy is democracy!!!
23 | Angie Gregory | 10153995483420950_10153995568350950 | amazing, our country our fellow citizens suffering under this administration, noone is better off than 8 yrs ago, a criminal running for office, and all we come out with after this final debate is this idiotic question, amazing. Guess the media got there marching orders again.
24 | Ashley Crow | 10153995483420950_10153995566630950 | They are rigged they want America to think their votes count when in reality they dont. Media is bias. Fabricating stories twisting people's words
25 | David Rovka | 10153995483420950_10153995572955950 | The fact that the media and current administration don't want to do anything about the voter fraud and bias in the process is upsetting. The last thing they should be doing is attacking someone for complaining about the flaws in the system.

2 | Alex Hovland | 10153995463525950_10153995467450950 | If anyone actually thinks Hillary is honest, then they're mentally enslaved...
3 | Cynthia Meyer Coughlin | 10153995463525950_10153995624740950 | We have seen what Hillary can do-all talk, no action. Why not give Trump a chance? People said Reagan would make a horrible president- they didn't know ahead of time~ And he surprised everyone- a real class actThe blatant corruption in the Clinton campaign is enough for me to vote Trump and give him a chance.I can't handle another 4 years of higher taxes and unaffordable healthcare!

5 | Scott Barry | 10153995463525950_10153995515395950 | Wow. You told her. Such Presidential material. I hope he keeps one--just one--of his promises (I know that's hoping for a lot). He said after he loses he will disappear and we won't see him again. Pleeeease!
6 | KevinKelly GladysSmith | 10153995463525950_10153995670430950 | This debate at best was a draw and Hillary retains her 9 point lead. More important is GOP Ryan and Rubio blasting Russia and telling Americans NOT to listen to Russia Wikileaks. Both President Bush's very close to Reagan saying they DO NOT support Trump is also huge.
7 | Lisa O'Brien Adams | 10153995463525950_10153995526295950 | "I know you are but what am I" - yes the dumb and dumber guide to be president (that seems to be his defense for everything)
8 | Chris Woolaston | 10153995463525950_10153995547365950 | Hillary's sabre-rattling with regard to Russia is very worrying indeed. She stated tonight that she intended to impose a "no-fly zone" over Aleppo in Syria, with the implication being that USAF pilots would be ordered to shoot down Russian jets, thus precipitating a Russo-American conflict. I know Hillary voted for the removal of Saddam when she was a Senator and that she toppled Gaddafi when she was the Secretary of State, but Russia is not some powerless, failed third world state with no military. As the Green party candidate Jill Stein said: Hillary is a dangerous warmonger who could well start World War III if elected on November 8th.
9 | Glenn Nakamura | 10153995463525950_10153995697425950 | It's extremely crucial to inform those whose only news sources are via the mainstream news media and from television, which a majority supports the Clinton machine and the DNC,and the few that are afraid of them.Therefore If you Like it, please Share it!Our children's children and generations to come are relying on us to do the right and Godly thing.Our president will appoint a Supreme Court Justice, which there're 8, 4 Consecutives and 4 Liberals, with one vacancy.You do the math and see why this election is extremely crucial.If you Like it, please Share it!http://www.projectveritasaction.com/video/rigging-election-video-ii-mass-voter-fraud

He may not stand for everything we want and may not go about getting his point across in the best manner but at least he is fed up with the last eight years like the rest of us (should be) and wants something better for this United States.
11 | Judith Ellen Moody | 10153995463525950_10153995754805950 | It was so refreshing to hear Chris Wallace be a fair monitor. As soon as the debate was over, however, your newscasters immediately began ranking on Trump over and over again. Why didn't they call Hillary to task regarding her emails?
12 | Marky Fisher | 10153995463525950_10153995596745950 | This final debate is watching a child who can't get his way. Such a childish drumpf. Like always interrupting Hillary. Melania go get your 5 yr child husband. He doesn't know when is his turn.
13 | Jess Lanning | 10153995463525950_10153995507810950 | But I thought she was the shadow empress, ruling us for the last 30 years. Now she's a puppet? Can he for once keep his rambling nonsense consistent, even in his loony reality?
14 | Tabitha Czarnowsky-Goulding | 10153995463525950_10153995574885950 | You people make me sick!! You want to slam Trump but not Hillary?? She has way more baggage than he does!! We are fed you with you
15 | Matt Stricker | 10153995463525950_10153995608625950 | Syria was a great country. Assad was brutal to his political opponents but his people love him. Assad was not sponsoring terrorism anywhere. Damascus was a beautiful city that was there 1000 years before Christ. Tourism flourished. Christians communities were allowed to prosper. along comes Clinton and Obama and with the encouragement from Saudi Arabia start air dropping weapons to a group of rebels. these rebels start fighting Assad but a group of them decide they can't beat Assad so they branch off and and take parts of Syria and Iraq. US continue to air drop weapons that wind up in the hands of what now is called ISIS. all this death and destruction are an exact result of Clinton and Obama's incompetence.
16 | Jimmy Wang | 10153995463525950_10153995668575950 | The IHRC is estimated to have collected $5.3 billion over two years and $9.9 billion over three years, without reconstructing much of anything. This represents more than five times the money that the Clintons have collected by other mechanisms like the Clinton Foundation or Laureate Education. Bill Clinton has claimed at various times that he only received 10 percent of the funds that had been pledged to the IHRC, but even if this were true, a vast sum of money would still have disappeared. By July 2011, Haiti‚Äôs Ministry of Public Works, Transportation and Communication (MPTC) had approved $3.2 billion of IHRC projects, but only $0.084 billion (2.6 percent) worth of projects had been completed.

20 | Zachary Provstgaard | 10153995463525950_10153995515590950 | Many of us do not share Donald Trump's past values, but we do love our country. In my opinion, it is not about him. It is about:1. Who will preserve and a protect the constitution?2. Who will protect the second amendment?3. Who will not send your son or daughter into harms way unless there is a good reason.4. Who does not support partial-birth abortion?5. Who wants to fix our inner cities and our infrastructure?6. Who will improve our economy and bring jobs back to the USA?7. Who is a nationalist and not a globalist?8. Who will protect our vets from dying in the streets and on park benches and get them help when they need it?9. Who supports our police, firemen, military men and women?10. Who will protect our borders from criminal elements and terrorist? 11. Who will not leave Americans to die in foreign countries under the hands of terrorist?12. Who is now a professed Christian and changed man according to many Christian leaders and pastors?These are just a few reasons I am voting for Donald Trump.
21 | Ginger Taylor | 10153995463525950_10153995515520950 | Wow Hillary Choose to wear the President Snow Dictator outfit from Hunger Games. That is pretty funny. She is so bad she is now subliminally telling everyone she is a dictator.
22 | Jim Bannon | 10153995463525950_10153995561555950 | The guy doing the poll after the debate couldn't wear something professional looking. SNEAKERS this is that important I guess.

24 | Craig Russell | 10153995463525950_10153995663360950 | Did anyone else catch Hillary's statement about what Trump said. She said "first when I hear Donald talk like that and know that his slogan is make America great again I wonder when he thought America was great". So basically I take it as she is saying America is not great nor ever was.
25 | Deborah Dotson | 10153995463525950_10153995674555950 | this election will be our last if clinton wins-she , obama , the bush family are All pushing for NWO-the united states of america will cease to exist just like france , germany , sweden ,or we will be fighting for our very lives-is that the future you want for Your children ?

1 | Ashley Nicole Elkins | 10153995450755950_10153995455825950 | I won't take his 'it's all lies' thing at face value. He's kind of a creep. And as House used to say 'Everybody lies'. So how about he works on showing actual PROOF that they're lying rather than simply flapping his gums?
2 | Marco Antonio Rosales | 10153995450755950_10153995455680950 | Donald looks and sounds defeated, Hillary looks and sounds presidential.Clinton is bending Trump over.

3 | Diane Thompson | 10153995450755950_10153995461505950 | Why would he think he could get away with saying that "nobody" has more respect for women than he does? First of all, has he spoken to every person on the planet about it? Secondly, his own words tell a very different story.
4 | Shereen Chowdhury | 10153995450755950_10153995546185950 | Omg how does he respect women? ,when Clinton talks he is saying thi nasty word ,she has name but he is saying 'this person', 'your husband',and many many things .
5 | Karen Husted | 10153995450755950_10153995483300950 | Yes, we all believe you Donnie, because you're not a pathological liar; or a racist creep, or a bigot, or a sexist pig, or a neo-fascist. We all trust the heck out of you, yeah.
6 | David Hauck | 10153995450755950_10153995546725950 | Donald respectively grabs women by the p#%ssy, he respectively kisses women against their will (that's what the tic tacos are for), he respectively walks backstage to 'inspect' teenage beauty pageant contestants as they are changing clothes. Even when he calls Rosie O'Donnell a "fat pig" or says that FOX News anchor is "bleeding out of wherever", it's always with the upmost respect. No one has more respect than Donald Trump, he even wants to respectively take away their right to vote...
7 | Ric Winthrop | 10153995450755950_10153995583835950 | Yeah, that's why you call women pigs, slobs, eating machines, and on and on.  Just like you lied and said you never made fun of the handicapped man, when we have you on tape doing it.  Liar and a loser all tied into one.

13 | M Brendan Diven | 10153995450755950_10153995455005950 | Notice how this question about how Donald treated women and also the redirect to Clinton for her husband's behavior not ONE WORD has been said about her defense of Bill's behavior in raping and abusing women. She dflects and deflects and even a Fox News guy let her get away with it.WTF?!?!?!. #Debate
14 | Gene James | 10153995450755950_10153995548015950 | More than Hillary for sure look at what she allowed her husband do to woman !!! and the list is long from rape to groping to marital affairs even has a son from a prostitute whom while Govenor sent $700 a month to take care of his name is Danny Williams Clinton !
15 | Linda Catanzaro | 10153995450755950_10153995538025950 | He had to get that disclaimer in lol. Which btw had nothing to do with the topic at the time. He disrespected a woman for 90 minutes...hmm
16 | Deborah Harris | 10153995450755950_10153995744055950 | i read alot of your comments and if any of yous think you can do better as president then you run for office if not then shut the fck up! hillary has done alot of illegal things and should be in prison but because she is going for president the are basically letting her off thats bs she is just another average American like us. as for trump he toop 1 mill and built a empire so maybe he can help our country its not our place to judge thats GODS PLACE we are to vote for the better of the two my guess would be try trump we already had a clinton once
17 | Andy Stacy Tucker Kittams | 10153995450755950_10153995496990950 | More women hold the top executive positions in his company than men do. Actions speak louder than rhetoric. This obviously shows his respect for women's contributions!
18 | Jj Hoffer | 10153995450755950_10153995483265950 | Her husband doest treat women well  either.omg people.he was the president and having an affair in the whitehouse and tried to lie abouf it.if you dont want the responsibility of setting a good example then dont.i dont want bill clinton in the whitehouse again.
19 | Gracie Rodriguez | 10153995450755950_10153995518730950 | F U Trump saying that you are the only one that respects women, my father, brothers, male cousins and male friends respect all women too .....piece of shit trump!!!
20 | Sean Mulligan | 10153995450755950_10153995456690950 | Clearly he does not understand the meaning of the respect
21 | Ginger Taylor | 10153995450755950_10153995516830950 | Wow Hillary Choose to wear the President Snow Dictator outfit from Hunger Games. That is pretty funny. She is so bad she is now subliminally telling everyone she is a dictator.

1 | Ioana Daniela Halsted Vijoi | 10153995438915950_10153995443915950 | He really needs to quit saying nobody respects women more than he does, that's a straight up lie proven such again and again, that's just insulting to people's intelligence?üòë
2 | Delmer Rodriguez | 10153995438915950_10153995444235950 | Trump is deflecting and denying left and right, changing the topics at hand whenever he feels the pressure. How this man has gone this far in the election cycle is beyond me
3 | Tisha Nugent | 10153995438915950_10153995457425950 | I love how Hilary is about women's rights but yet she supports her husband who has had multiple affairs and puts down those women and what about the rapist she got off where was her rights that she is fighting so hard for?? Pro life here!! #Trumpforpresident

5 | Jj Hoffer | 10153995438915950_10153995461185950 | 30 years?why is this country in such trouble and more divided than ever.whose watch did this happen on, not trump.also does anyone realize that hillary refused years ago to release their tax returns as well!
6 | Bill Eastham | 10153995438915950_10153995651880950 | Anyone else Notice Hillary didn't denie she hired violent protesters to cause fights At Trump rallies this is how Democrats work and noticed the News won't say anything about it
7 | Blite Graham | 10153995438915950_10153995460880950 | Trump foundation was just delisted he paid his bribe to prosecutor Bond out of it, the prosecutor who was investigating the numerous charges of fraud against Trump University
8 | Lori Reynolds | 10153995438915950_10153995525695950 | Im so glad my children are grown and do not have to watch this "man" so totally disrespect everyone in the room and in the TV audience. He cannot shut up. I cannot imagine him talking to another world leader. He would embarrass the hell out of all Americans.
9 | Donna Lewis Hinnant | 10153995438915950_10153995560265950 | Hillary is a criminal a liar and a crook that should never have been allowed to run for potus. The FBI mess this up royally and they know what they did. She should be in an orange jump suit right now not in a pure whit pants suit.
10 | Nathan Shartzer | 10153995438915950_10153995618030950 | 30 years of trash politics or 30 years of building a successful business two completely different things just so u know she plays of the fact that most of u are to stupid to see the difference and all u do is hear exactly what she wants...
11 | Tamra Blitch | 10153995438915950_10153995568325950 | Our kids failing in math and reading, more people on foodstamps than ever, what middle class, and the only ones who won't get hurt by her second amendment is the illegal gun owners who's stray bullets are killing our kids. That is her thirty years experience and he hasn't been in government so of course he hasn't a government record, yet. She is a thirty year veteran who can talk a good game. I was always told talk is cheap. Those federal taxes you said illegals are paying ask if they are getting their tax money at tax time. I bet those illegal immigrants cutting your grass and cleaning your house is in the same boat as those working for Trump.She is a seasoned veteran with top notch speech writers.
12 | Lynnsey Mostad | 10153995438915950_10153995669490950 | silly, I know, but when he protests ever so loudly that he doesn't know the guy(Putin) well his daughter Ivanka, one of his main campaigners, was on a two week vacation with Putin's girlfriend, close to being fiance not that long ago, like maybe 3 months ago while the campaign was in full swing,not in Russia but a former Soviet country, can't remember which. check it out. Guess she needed a little vacation from it and the new baby. Pretty cozy girlfriends at the wrong time I guess.
13 | Laura Coleman | 10153995438915950_10153995749805950 | What has she done in her 30 years. she claims to have fought for the children. By wanting to cut their spinals cores in their final month?  More interested in Planned parenthood donations and profits than saving a baby! What did she do as Secretary of State, Benghazi?  How well did her Russian re-set go. How about her baby libya?  where she wanted to convince the libyan government they could trust us , and her gun running?  So all those people died, for Clinton's baby there! Syrian, here and Obama created the refuges problems there. No game plan fro what happened after the fact. just like Iraq, boots back on the ground!  Flying thousand of miles collecting Clinton cash for favors, is not an accomplishment!
14 | Roger Price | 10153995438915950_10153995695545950 | 30 years experience and she still screwed up her job as Secretary  of State and accomplished very little as a senator and did nothing but run the bimbo eruption squad as the First Lady and she obviously has little business sense that doesn't include some pay to play quid pro quo. Nice resume but little substance.
15 | Damone Shannon Buxton | 10153995438915950_10153995462320950 | I think he has had his nose done too many times and the Coke he snorts makes it worse!!!  #canyabreatheasshole
16 | Sandra Kay Durrant | 10153995438915950_10153995469610950 | Her talking about it not being rigged, in  Indiana they have gone into multiple counties showing voter fraud, California showed voter fraud of where dead people have voted all you have to do is Google it yahoo it or bink it and you find that in some states there is fraud going on.
17 | Deborah Conner | 10153995438915950_10153995771925950 | Rosie O'Donald and Donald have been insulting each other for a long time. Taken out of context, his name calling n insults sound bad. Now, Rosie O'Donald is also a rude mouthy woman who, by comparison, makes Hillary look good. Do you remember Rodney Daingerfield?  He's another comedian who thought insulting people was funny. Just a little history lesson. Hillary I am going to leave you out of this. You've learned your lesson by living it, I just don't think you've changed. Oops.
18 | Garry Peterson | 10153995438915950_10153995694325950 | 30 years of experience at screwing the American people, with no accomplishments other than dodging non existent sniper fire and getting a child rapist off.
19 | David Anderson | 10153995438915950_10153995672785950 | but she didn't mention when she got the child rapist off  or Benghazi, or 50 other crimes she has done ... Oh I guess she is not as proud of those .
20 | Garry Peterson | 10153995438915950_10153995697840950 | This country needs a business man to turn this country around, not another 4 years similar to the last 8 that has hurt jobs and increased terrorism.
21 | Paul Stama | 10153995438915950_10153995470310950 | The difference between the election back then and the elections now is it's been proven that it's rigged. that it's fixed the Democrats are one evil cult.

3 | Marcia Berg | 10153995423900950_10153995438315950 | Anyone remember about a year ago when Trump was saying how well he knew Putin, and was talking about the time they spent together in a green room when they were both on a CBS news show? Which of course turned out to be a lie.

He is shouting from the mountain tops what they were only allowed to whisper in dark corners.

1 | Matthew D. Gayler | 10153995413995950_10153995511860950 | He did not encourage espionage- he said IF it was done, find the missing emails and give them to the press.  And do you really think Russia wasn't already trying to spy unless it was blessed by "The Donald"???  LOL
2 | Gina Lanape | 10153995413995950_10153995421575950 | Look at this idiot lmao!!!

3 | Tamra Blitch | 10153995413995950_10153995635900950 | Got her hair done, took time off to get all refreshed.Her people worked overtime on her outfit and speech writers whispering in her ear.That makes her the candidate alright.Record, what record, she don't need a good record as long as she is dressed nice and speaks good.People will buy that!!!
4 | Nick Sifers | 10153995413995950_10153995667160950 | And good for the NRA money well spent. No she isn't going to get rid of the second amendment. She will do what ever it takes to regulate and tax the gun industry to death.
5 | Ginger Taylor | 10153995413995950_10153995526585950 | So this proves what?  How much has wallstreet bankers provided to her to keep their lucrative tax breaks in place at the expense of the little man.
6 | Becky Papp-Corralejo | 10153995413995950_10153995419770950 | Try a real fact check please...seriously, you choose this?
7 | Antonio Castillo | 10153995413995950_10153995426900950 | Good. They should have. Screw her and her gun control. With open borders, how will she stop illegal weapons already here and from crossing the border

10 | Woods Sylvain | 10153995413995950_10153995419755950 | Trump has already lost if people go and vote. He has no plan and has lost his 3rd debate in a row. Only racist and sexist like him. #FDT #ImWithHer
11 | Hector Barrios | 10153995413995950_10153995708495950 | A LIE NAMED HILLARY...by Xavier KeoughI don‚Äôt detest Hillary Clinton because she is a woman. I oppose her because she cannot tell the truth to save her life. Any public servant who has the gall to issue a list of terms the press cannot utter, as if disposing the corpse of free will, is helplessly deluded and a petulant child. Sorry, Hillary, but no one owes you anything; especially the nation you proclaim to serve with nothing but the benevolence of blind ambition.If your candidacy cannot survive without the aid of deception, division, and the fabricated catcalls of ‚Äúsexism‚Äù to demonize your critics, then please tell us why America needs you? Better yet, please explain how you‚Äôre even worthy of a job? A leader doesn‚Äôt need pollsters, a panel of advisers, two news conferences and a room full of media drones just to announce whether or not she used an unauthorized server to conduct official government business and therefore deleted emails in an attempt to avoid prosecution. A leader would never break the law in the first place. And a leader doesn‚Äôt shout ‚Äúwhat does it matter‚Äù when four American lives are lost in Benghazi amidst the wake of her unmitigated failure. Any self-respecting adult with an ounce of integrity would simply admit the truth. Excuse me, any self-aware child who knows the difference between right and wrong, life and death.If I‚Äôm hiring someone to run my business, placing my future in foreign hands, I don‚Äôt care whether you‚Äôre a Democrat or Republican, a man or woman, white or black. I want the most qualified candidate whose character speaks for itself and whose ideals can stand on the merits of their own wisdom. That‚Äôs common sense.Are you going to have the audacity to tell me what I can and can‚Äôt ask; what verbiage is acceptable? If your resume and vision are truly best for the entire nation, not just one party, gender or race, either should be able to withstand the most blistering questions and exhaustive scrutiny. In fact, you should welcome any and all discourse to discredit your detractors and display your competence. A leader unites, empowers and inspires by example, not by excuses or endless blame.Tell me the national debt is a record 19.5 trillion and that Barack Obama has raised it more than the first 42 presidents combined.Admit that 94 million Americans are out of the workforce, nearly 50 million are on public assistance, and that the economic recovery is a sham.Admonish Iran as a destabilizing force of Islamic radicalism that must never be mentioned in the same sentence as ‚Äúnuclear power‚Äù.Recognize the reality that every civilized nation has immigration laws and that American sovereignty, the safety and security of her people, supersedes any political ploy to stuff the ballot box beneath the hollow cries of racism.Convince me that you, a self-proclaimed feminist and so-called egalitarian of equality, never dismissed, degraded, or threatened the victims of your husband‚Äôs numerous sexual indiscretions. And please...Explain how any worthy presidential candidate, let alone a considerable human being, uses the guise of 13 ‚Äúcharitable‚Äù foundations to collect over 100 million dollars in donations ‚Äì including foreign contributions solicited from America‚Äôs sworn enemies of Communist China, Iran and the Muslim Brotherhood ‚Äì only to defraud the actual victims of global disasters by keeping 85% of those misappropriated funds for her personal, political ambitions? Tell me anything that suggests you even remotely care!Yes, just like generations of legal immigrants before your candidacy know, respect is given when trust is earned.If you are incapable of acknowledging simple, documented facts ‚Äì solely because it‚Äôs easier to hide behind a propaganda platform that cajoles and incites an expendable public ‚Äì you‚Äôre not interested in solving anything, let alone serving the American people or any notion of truth.You‚Äôre the cancer killing the country I love. You‚Äôre the lie my forefathers never told.
12 | Henrik Ahlm | 10153995413995950_10153995422300950 | As I have said for weeks  - there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that Trump will not be elected as the next President of The United States of America! First of all ‚Äì the vast majority of people in America are sane, clever and smart people. Secondly, Melania Trump just openly admitted, that Trump was ‚Äúegged on‚Äù by Billy Bush to ‚Äúsay dirty and bad stuff.‚Äù Who on Earth would vote for a man, who is so easily provoked?  Not a sane normal functioning American citizen! Imagine such a miswired, incoherent babblehead as Trump being Chief in Command and President of the greatest nation on Earth?  Trump is also the candidate, who started using name calling, lies and disrespectful language in the presidential debate ‚Äì and that immediately told me ‚Äì that this guy is totally unfit to rule and he should be stopped!Thrump's actions has resulted in the current deplorable and unworthy presidential campaign. Trump will make America a much more unsafe and much poorer place to live with no community cohesion, whatsoever!Remember on voting day, November 8th, 2016 to vote for Hillary. Let me tell you this, Trump -  The end is near and now you face the final curtain - of that you can be very certain!

22 | Travis King | 10153995413995950_10153995679865950 | REMEMBER WHEN BILL CLINTON WAS PRESIDENT?(January 20, 1993 to January 20, 2001‚Äîtwo terms)When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over an attempt to reform health care. Her proposed plan was so bad that many Democrats came up with competing plans of their own in protest, and in spite of threats and intimidation, on September 26, 1994, the ‚ÄúHillarycare‚Äù bill was declared dead.This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million for studies, promotion, and other efforts.Then, President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general. Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood‚Äîboth were forced to withdraw their names from consideration. Next, she chose Janet Reno, which husband Bill described as "my worst mistake." (Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.)Husband Bill also allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission‚ÄîLani Guanier was her selection. After considerable backlash from prominent Democratic senators concerning Ms. Guanier's radical views, Bill Clinton withdrew her name from nomination, stating that she did not represents the civil rights views that he had championed during his campaign.However, apparently a slow learner, husband Bill continued to allow Hillary to make more recommendations. She chose former law partners, Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department. Her selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kennedy was forced to resign. (Is anyone wondering yet what her Supreme Court Justice appointments would be like?)Many younger voters will have no knowledge of "Travelgate," the first major ethics controversy during Bill‚Äôs presidency.Hillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend, Harry Thompson‚Äîbut the White House Travel Office refused to comply. She trumped up allegations of financial mismanagement and reported seven long-time White House employees to the FBI. This ruined their reputations, got them fired, and caused a thirty-six month investigation. Eventually, most of the employees were reinstated and Clinton associates were forced out of the travel office. Only one White House employee, Billy Dale, was charged with a crime‚Äîthe enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds; a jury acquitted him in less than two hours.Still not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House Security. When Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies (Filegate) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff, suddenly Hillary and the President denied even knowing Livingstone, and of course, denied knowledge of drug use in the White House.Following this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents.Next, when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by Bill Clinton, Hillary was put in charge of the "bimbo eruption" and scandal defense. Let‚Äôs look at some of her more notable decisions in this regard . . . She urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation, they settled with Ms. Jones. She refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor. After $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr's investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs. Hillary's devious game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for 'lying under oath' to a grand jury, followed by his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives. Hillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, "I do not recall," "I have no recollection," and "I don't know" a total of 56 times while under oath. (Sound familiar?) After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had "mistakenly thought was hers."So you see, the email scandal and all of her malfeasance regarding the handling of Top Secret information, not to mention the "pay to play" schemes of the Clinton Foundation, are nothing new. Hillary‚Äôs entire political career has been nothing but a web of lies, corruption and destruction in her quest for power.Is anyone else ready to say, ‚ÄúEnough is enough!‚Äù?But unfortunately, I‚Äôm sure her loyal fans will say, "What difference does it make?"

3 | Shannon Courtney | 10153995405815950_10153995424680950 | So how far are we willing to let them go? When will we finally get pissed that they can get into whatever they want. When they've hacked into the military and used the information against our soldiers?When they've shut down the power grids? When they've launched our missiles? Stop looking at this one issue and see the bigger picture and the bigger threat.
4 | Roger Ross | 10153995405815950_10153995539565950 | What about the espionage that you're doing Hillary Clinton? All the emails that you have deleted putting people at risk, Americans at risk. Are you embarrassed Hillary Clinton that someone has found your emails instead of the FBI? How arrogant can you be? People have been put in prison for doing less than you have done and you're running for president? How ducking pathetic can you be Hillary Clinton?

If this is true who failed us here? The Russians? I think not. But here is another option to wonder about .. what if it wasnt the Russians .. which I doubt. But what if it was the deepest circles within our own govt .. what if they are not in agreement with what Hillary just got away with .. and they dont want her to be elected .. BUT don't want to expose themselves...
9 | Marvelle Wilson Sivard | 10153995405815950_10153995422065950 | So....all the more reason not to have classified info on a private server.  Right? Even SHE can't be stupid enough to believe they wouldn't try. Dumbest or most complicit Sec of State ever. Which is it?
10 | Rob Utzig | 10153995405815950_10153995584325950 | Funny that the conservatives think it is liberals who spy on Americans.  Obama used a law Bush pushed and many liberals were blackmailed into supporting.  If Romney or McCain were president and got busted- it would be all about how it is necessary. . . As a republican who is educated - I find ignorant hypocrisy like that ridiculous!
11 | Lola Paluca | 10153995405815950_10153995584875950 | When Hillary travels around the world with her unsecured hand device, I wonder how many other countries she's visited have had access to our countries sensitive information. #Russia is just the obvious choice
12 | Rob Utzig | 10153995405815950_10153995495325950 | it is about the Russian Government tampering in the american election system - with blatant bias!  Wiki is working for our enemies and promoting ideas that would actually undermine national security!
13 | Garry Peterson | 10153995405815950_10153995688775950 | At least they let the American people know of all the lies, incompetence and corruption coming from Hillary, when the main stream news media, including CBS tries to cover up and not report any of it, in their attempt to control the election.

20 | Welsh Jhoulys | 10153995405815950_10153995577025950 | How would our Government know that? They couldn't even recover all of Hillary's illegally destroyed emails. They couldn't even prosecute her for obviously intentionally subjecting classified materials to hackers. Apparently, they didn't even know the Secretary of State had a personal server that she conducted both personal and Government Business from. How would they know anything if they didn't know that?
21 | Shelley Brown | 10153995405815950_10153995600130950 | Well if this is true and she wins mark your calendars as to when Hilary will be prosecuting them for their crimes ! When will this happen Hilary???
22 | Hall Bauer S B | 10153995405815950_10153995487295950 | Espionage? Because Assange publishes what Hillary refuses to disclose under court order, or FOI request?

23 | Flicia Norris | 10153995405815950_10153995446095950 | Shut down the internet. Go back when it wasn't a site period. At least most of our info will be better protected. And not only that it will bring more jobs back.
24 | Jimmy Torrez | 10153995405815950_10153995427475950 | Read the FBI report then read the actual law and then keep telling yourself you are not voting for a crook. Title 18. Section 2071.‚Äú(a) Whoever willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys, or attempts to do so, or, with intent to do so takes and carries away any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both. (b) Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States. As used in this subsection, the term ‚Äúoffice‚Äù does not include the office held by any person as a retired officer of the Armed Forces of the United States.‚ÄùYes, it explicitly states "shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States. You don't have to vote for the lesser of two evils, it's still evil. McMillan is in 4 points ahead in Utah with 6 electoral votes. Gary Johnson can win a state and more importantly can keep Clinton from reaching 270 electoral votes in other states. That would likely mean someone other than Trump of Clinton win the Presidency.

6 | Liz Damron | 10153995394295950_10153995490160950 | Our country is not a democracy. If it was the presidency would be decided by the people not by ELECTORS AND ELECTORAL VOTES. Bill Clinton for example, did not win the popular vote but won the presidency by electoral votes. Same with old man Bush. The presidency should be decided by popular vote, by the people, not by the electors that are voting for the "interest of the people". Everyone that does not know how the president is actually elected should look up how it is actually run.
7 | Marco Antonio Rosales | 10153995394295950_10153995402805950 | Donald looks and sounds defeated, Hillary looks and sounds presidential.Clinton is bending Trump over. She's getting Trump to defend Putin in front of all of America.
8 | Tamra Blitch | 10153995394295950_10153995599955950 | Am I the only one who thinks the laws of our land should be enforced and those who come here legally and have stood in line and did it the law abiding way should be first in line.I'm sorry but if you allow people to break the laws of our nation and give them citizenship for breaking our laws,what kind of nation will we have.When you are more concerned with everyone else in other countries and their feelings,but the country you are running for president you don't care.You see a bloody four year old from another country, but not that bloody four year old shot by a stay bullet here, or that two year old that is hungry because a job her mother or father could have had is given to an illegal immigrant,the children in other countries are your first priority. You need to fix the people issues in your own country before giving and helping other countries. You have homeless and hungry here but want to let others come here to be the same way.

After the earthquake people were temporaly moved into shelters of small tents, while waiting to build new homes from the money donated. Today, that shelter is now a town. People still live in those tents. People in haiti are crying because no one even knows what the Clintons did with the money. She has a good connection with the government of haiti, and has helped her  brother to own a mine company in haiti. Shame! Go on YouTube and see how Haitians hate and cry over the Clinton's conduct. She was unable to properly answer the question on Haiti.

4 | Beto Orozco | 10153995390225950_10153995732800950 | Donald Trump answers the question: What is 2+2?"I have to say a lot of people have been asking this question. No, really. A lot of people come up to me and they ask me. They say, "What's 2+2"? And I tell them look, we know what 2+2 is. We've had almost eight years of the worst kind of math you can imagine. Oh my god, I can't believe it. Addition and subtraction of the 1s the 2s and the 3s. Its terrible. Its just terrible. Look, if you want to know what 2+2 is, do you want to know what 2+2 is? I'll tell you.First of all the number 2, by the way I love the number 2. It's probably my favorite number, no it is my favorite number. You know what, it's probably more like the number two but with a lot of zeros behind it. A lot. If I'm being honest, I mean, if I'm being honest. I like a lot of zeros. Except for Marco Rubio, now he's a zero that I don't like. Though, I probably shouldn't say that. He's a nice guy but he's like, "10101000101", on and on, like that. He's like a computer! You know what I mean? He's like a computer. I don't know. I mean, you know. So, we have all these numbers and we can add them and subtract them and add them. TIMES them even. Did you know that? We can times them OR divide them, they don't tell you that, and I'll tell you, no one is better at the order of operations than me. You wouldn't believe it. That I can tell you. So, we're gonna be the best on 2+2, believe me. OK? Alright. Thank you."üôÑüòè

If we have billions to put intersection cameras up all across America we can at least do the same along our borders.. Make the video feed public so we US citizens could report crossings...How about we bring our troops home to guard this country for a change?   Lastly:  If Trump had no chance of winning the media would not be working so hard to attack him... So the media is controlled by democrats.. now consider this: 1) Democrats attacked Trump Supporters in San Jose CA 2) Democrats blocked roads to Trump rallies 3) Democrats broke store window in Texas because they had Trump signs in the windows.. 4)Now firebombs... Democrats have imported the violence and politically instability of Mexico and the middle east into America.. They have desensitized American youth to where they don't see the hypocrisy of committing violence on people they accuse of violence.. We Republicans use words free speech and the law.. Democrats have descended into mob rule and terrorism... The new America?

2 | Amanda Beachum | 10153995380900950_10153995390310950 | Such nonsense. Where are these 9-month pregnant women deciding, eh, I've changed my mind? Where are all the doctors performing these elective abortions? You know insurance won't pay for them. What a load of hooey.
3 | Linda L Cain | 10153995380900950_10153995396170950 | No she said it's the mother and families choice if something is wrong with the fetus !! Damn people I'm deaf in one ear and I could understand what she was meaning and read between the lines! And that's all I'm going to say on this matter so if your a Dirty Donald w supporters I will not respond so don't waste your damn time replying!!

5 | Will Wallace | 10153995380900950_10153995385060950 | Hillary just threw the first punch when she mentioned that Trump choked in Mexico when he did not bring up the wall. Here we go.
6 | Brande Mechelle Stabler | 10153995380900950_10153995394405950 | She has no respect for life or women. She is fine with abortion, and doesn't care that a 12 yr old girl was raped by a 40+ yr old man and she got him off .
7 | Crystal Gardner Cheaves | 10153995380900950_10153995442970950 | Anyone who could say he has more skeletons than Hillary Clinton has clearly not followed politics at all.

11 | Carol Kulbacki Heller | 10153995380900950_10153995596610950 | According to Hillary a baby has no constitutional right until they're out of the womb and YES she does support abortion at 36 weeks--a baby at 36 weeks is capable of surviving---if a pregnant woman is murdered the person is charged with a double homicide--just like the Peterson case in California--let's worry about toddlers with guns but murder a baby at full term--
12 | Liz Malone Gerron | 10153995380900950_10153995631030950 | From Slate:  "Trump, meanwhile, seemed to confuse partial-birth abortions with Cesarean sections. ‚ÄúYou can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby. Now, you can say that that is OK, and Hillary can say that that is OK, but it‚Äôs not OK with me,‚Äù he said. This is not how any abortion procedure works. Trump‚Äôs frightening explanation highlights why it makes more sense for women to make medical decisions with their doctors, rather than bloviating sadists who aren‚Äôt sure how babies exit the human body."
13 | Cathy Zanchelli | 10153995380900950_10153995563210950 | What is wrong with people? She's broke the law! She's a liar! Sadly it doesn't matter. She keeps bringing up the Muslim parents ...what about the parents of the Benghazi men? That's disrespectful. I'm disgusted. The media stinks, Trump stated honestly that he was not sure he would accept it.that was the truth! Now if he came out and said he would, then the media would be saying he flipped flopped on the results.
14 | Stephanie Thompson Holt | 10153995380900950_10153995553890950 | late term abortions are not legal in a number of states except in certain medical situations. The time frame referred to as late term is often based on when a baby is considered ‚Äúviable‚Äù (able to survive outside the womb). However, the point of ‚Äúviability‚Äù is a grey area in many medical communities. Most medical communities establish 24 weeks gestation, the later part of the second trimester, as the earliest time of viability. Therefore, the availability of any procedure used in the third trimester is based on the laws of that state.
15 | Derrick Dones | 10153995380900950_10153995398040950 | America our hope and trust should and must be in GOD. Most have been caught up into this political cycle and distracted by all that is happening until we have forgotten GOD but beware of what we ask for no matter what side of the isle you choose. We must choose GOD again as a nation and around this world. (Pay attention to what the king will do after the rejection of GOD)As it is written:‚Ä≠‚Ä≠I Samuel‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠8:6-18‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠NKJV‚ÄúBut the thing displeased Samuel when they said, ‚ÄúGive us a king to judge us.‚Äù So Samuel prayed to the LORD. And the LORD said to Samuel, ‚ÄúHeed the voice of the people in all that they say to you; for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected Me, that I should not reign over them. According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt, even to this day‚Äîwith which they have forsaken Me and served other gods‚Äîso they are doing to you also. Now therefore, heed their voice. However, you shall solemnly forewarn them, and show them the behavior of the king who will reign over them.‚Äù So Samuel told all the words of the LORD to the people who asked him for a king. And he said, ‚ÄúThis will be the behavior of the king who will reign over you: He will take your sons and appoint them for his own chariots and to be his horsemen, and some will run before his chariots. He will appoint captains over his thousands and captains over his fifties, will set some to plow his ground and reap his harvest, and some to make his weapons of war and equipment for his chariots. He will take your daughters to be perfumers, cooks, and bakers. And he will take the best of your fields, your vineyards, and your olive groves, and give them to his servants. He will take a tenth of your grain and your vintage, and give it to his officers and servants. And he will take your male servants, your female servants, your finest young men, and your donkeys, and put them to his work. He will take a tenth of your sheep. And you will be his servants. And you will cry out in that day because of your king whom you have chosen for yourselves, and the LORD will not hear you in that day.‚Äù‚Äù

"I respect the tradition of gun ownership," but we must have "reasonable regulation," Hillary Clinton says.

2 | Dale Waller | 10153995370570950_10153995381050950 | Close the online loophole??? What the hell, she has NO clue. If someone orders a firearm online say from Bud's, it has to be shipped to a FFL in the buyer's state and they do the background check at the dealer.
3 | Maggie Lw | 10153995370570950_10153995381215950 | She also said that a video caused the death of 4 Americans in Benghazi.She dumps human waste on the streets of our cities.Though I can see where she might like limited access to guns, how else could people who oppose her commit "suicide"?
4 | Ed Bailey | 10153995370570950_10153995461190950 | What, super high taxes on ammo? Taxes on your guns? I think this woman is full of sh** !!!! I do not trust ANY democrap when it comes to guns. They talk about gun control too much and don't do anything about all the shootings in these big cities which have some of the toughest gun laws in the country. The Constitution gives me the right to have my guns.  Get over it democraps, go live in some socialist country if you don't like America.
5 | Michael Friday | 10153995370570950_10153995377095950 | NO. She wants limitations on our Rights. Here is a bit of information for both Clinton and her supporters: our Rights are not given to us by our government. We are born with them and the government can not and will not regulate them.
6 | Scott Elam | 10153995370570950_10153995657905950 | Who decides what is reasonable? Hillary you can't trust her is that her public opinion or her private opinion? She has told us she tells us one thing but behind closed doors she said something else
7 | Caravan Lulubelle | 10153995370570950_10153995633065950 | You people are under the broad and uninformed impression that gun laws are the same in all states. They aren't the same in all states and can be vastly different. For example, not all states require background checks for gun sales at gun shows.

6 | Jerry Ray Johannesen | 10153995363850950_10153995369215950 | Hillary Clinton has been involved in scandals before. Here are some notable ones you may have forgotten. Chinagate - The Clinton-Gore campaign in 1996 allegedly took bribes from Chinese banks and their government to help their dwindling poll numbers. The Chinese embassy in D.C. helped siphon funds into the DNC. Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown (who was killed in a plane crash), and at Hillary‚Äôs instruction reportedly sold seats on department trade missions to China. Joint congressional hearings were canceled after Democrats threatened to bring up Republican campaign issues and then Monica Lewinsky actually saved this scandal from media attention. Travelgate Scandal - Catherine Cornelius, a 25-year-old cousin of Bill's was allegedly promised the position of director of the travel office. Hillary Clinton then (indirectly) fired seven employees from the United States travel office and replaced them with associates from Arkansas. Records were either nowhere to be found or incorrectly filed. And, there's a reported attempt to give a White House airline contract to friend. Hillary had the FBI investigate Billy Dale, the head of the travel office, ruining his career who was found to do nothing wrong, but was then audited by the IRS for three years after."Billy Dale and his family went through hell thanks to the Clintons, Attorney General Janet Reno, the FBI and the IRS," Irvine wrote. "Hillary's greatest crime was not perjury, it was trying to send an innocent man to prison to justify having fired him and his staff without cause."‚ÄúA memorandum by a former Presidential aide depicts Hillary Rodham Clinton as the central figure in the 1993 travel office dismissals, a politically damaging episode that the aide said had resulted from a climate of fear in which officials did not dare question Mrs. Clinton's wishes," wrote the NYT in 1996.Whitewater Scandal - Hillary and her husband were partners in a shady real estate development firm called Whitewater Development Corp in Arkansas. Accusations of impropriety against the Clintons and others soon surfaced, regarding improper campaign contributions, political and financial favors, and tax benefits. Clinton‚Äôs friends and majority owners,  James and Susan McDougal were jailed for fraud, Clinton's successor, Governor Jim Tucker, was jailed for fraud along with municipal judges David Hale and Eugene Fitzhugh who worked with James McDougal. The Clintons walked away unscathed, having apparently done nothing wrong.See Whitewater Timeline.Vince Foster Jr. Mystery - Questions cloud the suicide of Vince Foster, former colleague, friend, and White House aid  of Hillary‚Äôs who had connections to Travelgate, and the Whitewater scandals. Read the link above entitled "The Man Who Knew too Much. . ." Filegate Scandal - Craig Livingstone, director of the White House's Office of Personnel Security "improperly" accessed FBI files on several hundred individuals.Mrs. Clinton called it a, "completely honest bureaucratic snafu."Many of these files were on people from previous Republican administrations. Hillary Clinton hired Livingston and is alleged to have looked at the files and requested this move. She was accused by Republicans of  violating privacy rights of individuals she viewed as political adversaries.Cattle-Futures Miracle - Hillary‚Äôs first commodity trade was in cattle futures where she ordered 10 futures contracts which normally cost $12,000 dollars with only $1,000 dollars in her account. This turned into $6,300 dollars by the next morning and after 10 months totaled $100,000, with trading help from James B. Blair.‚ÄúBlair, who at the time was outside counsel to Tyson Foods Inc., Arkansas' largest employer, says he was advising Clinton out of friendship, not to seek political gain. . ."  reports The WashingtonPost. Robert L. "Red" Bone ran the Springdale, AK financial services company REFCO allowed the trades and later, after investigation, had to pay the largest fine at the time in the exchanges history and was suspended for three years. Hillary Clinton said she was able to make the successful trading because she read the Wall Street Journal for research. Lootergate - Bill and especially Hillary started to ship White House furniture to their personal home in Chappaqua, N.Y.. The Clintons claimed they were donated, but at only some were proven to be donated and meant to stay in the White House after contacting the manufacturers. The Clintons returned some of the furniture after pressure was put on them to do so.‚ÄúGOP lawmakers and others criticized Hillary Rodham Clinton in particular for accepting many presents just before she joined the Senate and became covered by strict ethics rules that prohibit accepting gifts worth more than $50.‚Äù Drug Dealer Donor Scandal - Convicted drug trafficker Jorge Cabrera apparently made such a big donation to the Clinton‚Äôs campaign that he was invited to the White house without Secret Service present. Ponzi Scheme and Political Favor Scandal - Norman Yung Yuen Hsu was a convicted pyramid investment promoter, and major Democratic donor. He contributed an undisclosed amount to Hillary Clinton‚Äôs 2008 campaign. ‚ÄúHe was sentenced to more than 24 years in prison in 2009 by a judge who accused him of funding his fraud by manipulating the political process in a way that 'strikes at the very core of our democracy.‚Äù Benghazi - Just watch this Here is an article posted in the New York Times in 1996 entitled ‚ÄúBlizzard of Lies‚Äù about Hillary Clinton.The mega Clinton Foundation is also rife with cronyism and political favors.For a larger list of scandals associated with the Clintons, check out The Clinton Crime Library.
7 | Carol Kulbacki Heller | 10153995363850950_10153995697980950 | Hillary's already proven her poor choices--she had all of the intelligence for a vote on a war--she voted for it--Donald trump had no power to vote---she never denied her campaigns involvement in inciting riots at the Trump rallies through the O'keefe undercover videos--she never denied the wikileaks and all the horrible things they've been doing--maybe you all need to get your head outta the MSM's ass and learn the facts
8 | Brooklynn Bowersock | 10153995363850950_10153995401865950 | And Hilary's whole demeanor changed as soon as Wikileaks was mentioned? I did bitch was on the defensive and throwing wild allegations out at trump? She's guilty and shouldn't be on the stage let alone a candidate.
9 | Launa Christine Sallai | 10153995363850950_10153995423240950 | Total Federal Government Debt in 2016. At the end of FY 2016 the gross US federal government debt is estimated to be $19.4 trillion, according to the FY17 Federal Budget.
10 | Launa Christine Sallai | 10153995363850950_10153995419925950 | National Debt has gone up $4.939 trillion since President Obama took office.

It was $10.626 trillion on President Bush's last day in office, which coincided with President Obama's first day.Mar 19, 2012. This will continue to go up with Clinton.

As the candidates face off in the final debate, the CBS News Politics  team will be fact-checking Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump tonight.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Susan Venters | 10153995305755950_10153995322610950 | I would like to see them actually debate the real issues this country is facing. Job loss, health insurance skyrocketing, instead of mud slinging. I have always voted Democrat, but not this year.
2 | Jerry Ray Johannesen | 10153995305755950_10153995318990950 | Hillary Clinton has been involved in scandals before. Here are some notable ones you may have forgotten. Chinagate - The Clinton-Gore campaign in 1996 allegedly took bribes from Chinese banks and their government to help their dwindling poll numbers. The Chinese embassy in D.C. helped siphon funds into the DNC. Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown (who was killed in a plane crash), and at Hillary‚Äôs instruction reportedly sold seats on department trade missions to China. Joint congressional hearings were canceled after Democrats threatened to bring up Republican campaign issues and then Monica Lewinsky actually saved this scandal from media attention. Travelgate Scandal - Catherine Cornelius, a 25-year-old cousin of Bill's was allegedly promised the position of director of the travel office. Hillary Clinton then (indirectly) fired seven employees from the United States travel office and replaced them with associates from Arkansas. Records were either nowhere to be found or incorrectly filed. And, there's a reported attempt to give a White House airline contract to friend. Hillary had the FBI investigate Billy Dale, the head of the travel office, ruining his career who was found to do nothing wrong, but was then audited by the IRS for three years after."Billy Dale and his family went through hell thanks to the Clintons, Attorney General Janet Reno, the FBI and the IRS," Irvine wrote. "Hillary's greatest crime was not perjury, it was trying to send an innocent man to prison to justify having fired him and his staff without cause."‚ÄúA memorandum by a former Presidential aide depicts Hillary Rodham Clinton as the central figure in the 1993 travel office dismissals, a politically damaging episode that the aide said had resulted from a climate of fear in which officials did not dare question Mrs. Clinton's wishes," wrote the NYT in 1996.Whitewater Scandal - Hillary and her husband were partners in a shady real estate development firm called Whitewater Development Corp in Arkansas. Accusations of impropriety against the Clintons and others soon surfaced, regarding improper campaign contributions, political and financial favors, and tax benefits. Clinton‚Äôs friends and majority owners,  James and Susan McDougal were jailed for fraud, Clinton's successor, Governor Jim Tucker, was jailed for fraud along with municipal judges David Hale and Eugene Fitzhugh who worked with James McDougal. The Clintons walked away unscathed, having apparently done nothing wrong.See Whitewater Timeline.Vince Foster Jr. Mystery - Questions cloud the suicide of Vince Foster, former colleague, friend, and White House aid  of Hillary‚Äôs who had connections to Travelgate, and the Whitewater scandals. Read the link above entitled "The Man Who Knew too Much. . ." Filegate Scandal - Craig Livingstone, director of the White House's Office of Personnel Security "improperly" accessed FBI files on several hundred individuals.Mrs. Clinton called it a, "completely honest bureaucratic snafu."Many of these files were on people from previous Republican administrations. Hillary Clinton hired Livingston and is alleged to have looked at the files and requested this move. She was accused by Republicans of  violating privacy rights of individuals she viewed as political adversaries.Cattle-Futures Miracle - Hillary‚Äôs first commodity trade was in cattle futures where she ordered 10 futures contracts which normally cost $12,000 dollars with only $1,000 dollars in her account. This turned into $6,300 dollars by the next morning and after 10 months totaled $100,000, with trading help from James B. Blair.‚ÄúBlair, who at the time was outside counsel to Tyson Foods Inc., Arkansas' largest employer, says he was advising Clinton out of friendship, not to seek political gain. . ."  reports The WashingtonPost. Robert L. "Red" Bone ran the Springdale, AK financial services company REFCO allowed the trades and later, after investigation, had to pay the largest fine at the time in the exchanges history and was suspended for three years. Hillary Clinton said she was able to make the successful trading because she read the Wall Street Journal for research. Lootergate - Bill and especially Hillary started to ship White House furniture to their personal home in Chappaqua, N.Y.. The Clintons claimed they were donated, but at only some were proven to be donated and meant to stay in the White House after contacting the manufacturers. The Clintons returned some of the furniture after pressure was put on them to do so.‚ÄúGOP lawmakers and others criticized Hillary Rodham Clinton in particular for accepting many presents just before she joined the Senate and became covered by strict ethics rules that prohibit accepting gifts worth more than $50.‚Äù Drug Dealer Donor Scandal - Convicted drug trafficker Jorge Cabrera apparently made such a big donation to the Clinton‚Äôs campaign that he was invited to the White house without Secret Service present. Ponzi Scheme and Political Favor Scandal - Norman Yung Yuen Hsu was a convicted pyramid investment promoter, and major Democratic donor. He contributed an undisclosed amount to Hillary Clinton‚Äôs 2008 campaign. ‚ÄúHe was sentenced to more than 24 years in prison in 2009 by a judge who accused him of funding his fraud by manipulating the political process in a way that 'strikes at the very core of our democracy.‚Äù Benghazi - Just watch this Here is an article posted in the New York Times in 1996 entitled ‚ÄúBlizzard of Lies‚Äù about Hillary Clinton.The mega Clinton Foundation is also rife with cronyism and political favors.For a larger list of scandals associated with the Clintons, check out The Clinton Crime Library.
3 | Terry R Bingham | 10153995305755950_10153995320130950 | Here's a fact: Trump is bringing Sarah Palin to the debate!! Hahahaha   What in the hell does he think that will do for him??? #imwithher
4 | Roy R Norman | 10153995305755950_10153995317165950 | Roy R Norman CBS Evening News with Scott Pelley Question just seen a thing in another paper on the west coast that said someone just filed papers on Hillary Clinton for campaine finance laws by The complaint was filed by J. Christian Adams, the President and General Counsel of the Public Interest Legal Foundation, which is a nonprofit organization ‚Äúdedicated to protect the right to vote, preserve the constitutional framework of American elections, and educate the public on the issue of election integrityFoundation, which is a nonprofit organization ‚Äúdedicated to protect the right to vote, preserve the constitutional framework of American elections, and educate the public on the issue of election integrity .So what does CBS know about this ? it was fild and Hillary Clinton Knows about it suposeably just found out not more then 2 hours ago ,so what does CBS know ?
5 | Rockwell Torrey | 10153995305755950_10153995314630950 | We all know that the Media is in that big Progressive bed with Hillary. You are fooling no one. That is what Trump is talking about. Without the media Hillary would have likely dropped out. He is one against all of you. But you did not count on us. We are going to destroy Hillary on election day. Figuratively.
6 | Kiki Hemphill | 10153995305755950_10153995316885950 | Anytime Trump is involved, the fact checkers will be working overtime. Not a big Hillary fan, but sometimes Trump makes me think as if he's handing Hillary the election with a pretty little bow wrapped around it.........an early Christmas gift.
7 | Donna Maldonado | 10153995305755950_10153995568250950 | I have read many of the Wikileaks it is true she was behind starting fights at rallies its there I read it Do yourself a favor you want the truth go to the source Wikileaks has everything She should be in prison
8 | Michael McGan | 10153995305755950_10153995318920950 | That's hysterical. CBS team will fact check. The media sucks and is no longer a resource for Americans to get real facts let alone the truth.
9 | Paul R Cole | 10153995305755950_10153995686995950 | Donald Trump won Hands Down, Clinton was lost on so many issues, she was dumbfounded , And to all women Of America Do you Really think God Is happy with you Killing something so Precious as a Little baby ? What if your Mom Had Done that to you?
10 | Katy Brandt Roberts | 10153995305755950_10153995328310950 | Watching online. What happened to fair & balanced in journalism?!?!? I'm undecided & you aren't swaying me toward Clinton. VERY frustrating!!!
11 | Morgan Orlins | 10153995305755950_10153995309000950 | If Hillary Clinton is elected, it will be the first time in American history that a know CRIMINAL was elected by the American people to be president.--She transmitted secret and TOP secret information via her blackberry and private server, which is an actionable crime.--Then Hillary proceeded to DELETE 33,000 e-mails that were on her devices and private server via "Bleachbit", which is obstructing justice, because those e-mails were under EXPLICIT Congressional subpoena. The only person who does this is a CRIMINAL, covering her tracks.--Then she wasn't charged by the DOJ, which met privately with Bill Clinton on an airplane before FBI Director James Comey gave his "findings."--And now we've discovered that the State Department (Undersecretary of State Patrick Kennedy) was was trying to cut a deal with the FBI to reclassify some of Hillary's e-mails, in order to make their transmission less criminal. I wonder how many times the FBI did cooperate? The FBI agreed to destroy some of the Clinton team's personal devices and personal computers, which is collusion.--Hillary violated national security laws and protocol, obstructed justice, and then colluded with the Dept. of Justice and FBI to destroy evidence.If a CRIMINAL president is alright by you, you have your candidate-- Hillary Clinton.
12 | Patrick Thibodeaux | 10153995305755950_10153995311765950 | If CBS is fact checking I'm sure everything Hilary says is true and Trump is a liar
13 | Crystal Gardner Cheaves | 10153995305755950_10153995575615950 | Hillary is good at a couple of things: she is good at brainwashing, being caught in a multitude of lies, promotes the KILLING of babies that have gone full term. This is the leader that you want? Rather than a man that may be a little rough around the edges but definitely has Americas best interest up front and for most first in his agenda. I call his loud nature his passion for this Country!!!!  If the FBI would do their job she would be in jail!!! Legally she should not be allowed to run. Trump #2016
14 | Eli Pax | 10153995305755950_10153995333350950 | Should be easy.. CBS is only willing to fact check Trump.
15 | Mary Asbill | 10153995305755950_10153995312295950 | Media fact checking fairly on both candidates? That will be a first.
16 | Paul John Gavagan | 10153995305755950_10153995327670950 | HILLARY:‚ÄúMy accomplishments as Secretary of State? Well, I‚Äôm glad you asked! My proudest accomplishment in which I take the most pride, mostly because of the opposition it faced early on, you know, the remnants of prior situations and mind-sets that were too narrowly focused in a manner whereby they may have overlooked the bigger picture, and we didn‚Äôt do that, and I‚Äôm proud of that. Very proud. I would say that‚Äôs a major accomplishment.‚Äù Hillary Clinton 11 March 2014 Could someone please tell me what she just said? And she is running for President!???
17 | Maria Rodriguez | 10153995305755950_10153995315935950 | If the orange pig is elected everyone kiss your @$$ goodbye. We will have WW3 before Christmas.
18 | Stephen Redding | 10153995305755950_10153995323935950 | What they mean is everything Trump says is a lie. Everything Hillary says is gospel.The media is so dam biased its really pathetic.
19 | Brooklynn Bowersock | 10153995305755950_10153995352925950 | Hopefully not using the Hilary fact checker, because we all know that's a sham.
20 | Mark Anthony Ramirez | 10153995305755950_10153995347485950 | CBS "news" fact-checking the debate is like a 5th grader grading his own homework.
21 | Cheryl Howard | 10153995305755950_10153995316775950 | Here's a preview of CBS fact checking, Trump is wrong and Hillary walks on water

23 | Jayson Kinnison | 10153995305755950_10153995319320950 | CBS wouldn't call bull shit on Hillary even if she said the earth was flat!

2 | Michael Friday | 10153995266330950_10153995278235950 | Here is the only foreign policy we need: Non-intervention. Our government has been interfering with other countries and ignoring our own issues for decades. It is time to stop getting us involved in wars that have nothing to do with our security. It is also time for us to close more than half of our foreign military bases. They are not necessary to our security. Our military has been reduced to an offensive weapon and not for our defense.

4 | Ashur DeKelaita | 10153995266330950_10153995310140950 | I would like to ask Trump, if you were made president, what would your response be to address the great bias the mass media has stood against you throughout the elections and with regard to terrorism in Syria? Is it possible to print up enough pink-slips to cleanse our country of all your lies and reestablish a FREE press.
5 | Steven Tucker | 10153995266330950_10153995293385950 | This is what the liberal Democratic party has become. Look, you may be a lifelong Democratic, but they are not who they once were and do you really want to be a part of what they have become? Democrats no longer care about people, that is evident by the lack of respect they continue to display for the American people. Watch this video, if you really care, to see exactly what devices they use to hurt the American people. You will not see the liberal mainstream media talk about it because they are a part of it. https://youtu.be/hDc8PVCvfKs

7 | Henrik Ahlm | 10153995266330950_10153995368670950 | As I have said for weeks  - there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that Trump will not be elected as the next President of The United States of America! First of all ‚Äì the vast majority of people in America are sane, clever and smart people. Secondly, Melania Trump just openly admitted, that Trump was ‚Äúegged on‚Äù by Billy Bush to ‚Äúsay dirty and bad stuff.‚Äù Who on Earth would vote for a man, who is so easily provoked?  Not a sane normal functioning American citizen! Imagine such a miswired, incoherent babblehead as Trump being Chief in Command and President of the greatest nation on Earth?  Trump is also the candidate, who started using name calling, lies and disrespectful language in the presidential debate ‚Äì and that immediately told me ‚Äì that this guy is totally unfit to rule and he should be stopped!Thrump's actions has resulted in the current deplorable and unworthy presidential campaign. Trump will make America a much more unsafe and much poorer place to live with no community cohesion, whatsoever!Remember on voting day, November 8th, 2016 to vote for Hillary. Let me tell you this, Trump -  The end is near and now you face the final curtain - of that you can be very certain!

Both Donald J. Trump  and Hillary Clinton's campaigns have released details about their guest lists for tonight's debate.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Michelle Cardenas | 10153995209705950_10153995217630950 | Claims he will be the candidate to institute extreme vetting for immigrants as President. Cannot even do enough homework to know that he's inviting a supporter of terrorists to be his special guest. Obama is estranged from his half-brother because Malik is a supporter of the terrorist group Hamas. Hahahaha. What a moron. What an amateur.
2 | Stephen Zeber | 10153995209705950_10153995224550950 | once again we will see TRUMP the manchild be a rude , racist , sexist low IQ , low life moron that he is as he did in the other two debates ! because of t the two debates ... II voted for HILLARY !!!
3 | Casey Grenier | 10153995209705950_10153995256420950 | Interesting that the Trump campaign has chosen to invite people from the Clintons' past (and Obama's, for some reason), while the Clinton campaign has invited people who represent the human faces of the policies and positions she stands for, as well as people who can vouch for her leadership.
4 | Vic Fitzsimmons | 10153995209705950_10153995238290950 | No parent of the dozens killed during several embassy attacks during the Bush administration ever came forward to personally blame an American government official.
5 | William Isenberg | 10153995209705950_10153995219515950 | There is no way h/c won the majority of votes in the DNC primaries when Sanders rallies had 100 thousand while h/c rallies barely a few hundred. You would take more time and spend more effort to go to a rally as opposed to voting. It flies in the face of common sense that you would get less votes than you had number of people at your rallies when attending a rally would take more effort than voting.
6 | Abie Ohayon | 10153995209705950_10153995230285950 | Trump 2016!!!!! His supporters are right behind like my status if you a royal supporter who will be voting for him on November 8 to defeat Hillary Clinton.
7 | Ricardo Anthony Cruz-Ramirez Jr. | 10153995209705950_10153995218230950 | as much as i loathe trump, the monster that created him is the PC far left that tells regular, ordinary, hard working white americans, who follow the law, and pay their taxes, and mind their own business, that they are somehow privileged, and racist!!!!!!
8 | Crystal Gardner Cheaves | 10153995209705950_10153995282585950 | Looking forward to the debate and hoping that ALL Americans will wake up from the brain washing distributed by Hillary Clinton. With all the videos and audio to see for yourself - from the flip flopping on her views depending on what year it is to telling the truth even when caught red handed, to the videos of Democrats from her camp explaining how they are bussing people in to vote because there is no way they will get caught! Wake up America, care about the future of your children, parents, spouses vote Donald Trump 2016 üá∫üá∏ make America strong again
9 | Konstantin Jagoulis | 10153995209705950_10153995303910950 | federal law, Title 18. Section 2071.For those of us who do not have United States Code committed to memory, here's what it says:‚Äú(a) Whoever willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys, or attempts to do so, or, with intent to do so takes and carries away any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both. (b) Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States. As used in this subsection, the term ‚Äúoffice‚Äù does not include the office held by any person as a retired officer of the Armed Forces of the United States.‚ÄùYes, it explicitly states "shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States.
10 | Crystal Morris | 10153995209705950_10153995248715950 | Thousands of black people anti-Hillary. You won't see this on mainstream media. Only on Facebook page @mmblackout. See thousands of black people marching the streets shouting Hillary kills black people, don't vote for her
11 | Jerry Ray Johannesen | 10153995209705950_10153995319555950 | Hillary Clinton has been involved in scandals before. Here are some notable ones you may have forgotten. Chinagate - The Clinton-Gore campaign in 1996 allegedly took bribes from Chinese banks and their government to help their dwindling poll numbers. The Chinese embassy in D.C. helped siphon funds into the DNC. Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown (who was killed in a plane crash), and at Hillary‚Äôs instruction reportedly sold seats on department trade missions to China. Joint congressional hearings were canceled after Democrats threatened to bring up Republican campaign issues and then Monica Lewinsky actually saved this scandal from media attention. Travelgate Scandal - Catherine Cornelius, a 25-year-old cousin of Bill's was allegedly promised the position of director of the travel office. Hillary Clinton then (indirectly) fired seven employees from the United States travel office and replaced them with associates from Arkansas. Records were either nowhere to be found or incorrectly filed. And, there's a reported attempt to give a White House airline contract to friend. Hillary had the FBI investigate Billy Dale, the head of the travel office, ruining his career who was found to do nothing wrong, but was then audited by the IRS for three years after."Billy Dale and his family went through hell thanks to the Clintons, Attorney General Janet Reno, the FBI and the IRS," Irvine wrote. "Hillary's greatest crime was not perjury, it was trying to send an innocent man to prison to justify having fired him and his staff without cause."‚ÄúA memorandum by a former Presidential aide depicts Hillary Rodham Clinton as the central figure in the 1993 travel office dismissals, a politically damaging episode that the aide said had resulted from a climate of fear in which officials did not dare question Mrs. Clinton's wishes," wrote the NYT in 1996.Whitewater Scandal - Hillary and her husband were partners in a shady real estate development firm called Whitewater Development Corp in Arkansas. Accusations of impropriety against the Clintons and others soon surfaced, regarding improper campaign contributions, political and financial favors, and tax benefits. Clinton‚Äôs friends and majority owners,  James and Susan McDougal were jailed for fraud, Clinton's successor, Governor Jim Tucker, was jailed for fraud along with municipal judges David Hale and Eugene Fitzhugh who worked with James McDougal. The Clintons walked away unscathed, having apparently done nothing wrong.See Whitewater Timeline.Vince Foster Jr. Mystery - Questions cloud the suicide of Vince Foster, former colleague, friend, and White House aid  of Hillary‚Äôs who had connections to Travelgate, and the Whitewater scandals. Read the link above entitled "The Man Who Knew too Much. . ." Filegate Scandal - Craig Livingstone, director of the White House's Office of Personnel Security "improperly" accessed FBI files on several hundred individuals.Mrs. Clinton called it a, "completely honest bureaucratic snafu."Many of these files were on people from previous Republican administrations. Hillary Clinton hired Livingston and is alleged to have looked at the files and requested this move. She was accused by Republicans of  violating privacy rights of individuals she viewed as political adversaries.Cattle-Futures Miracle - Hillary‚Äôs first commodity trade was in cattle futures where she ordered 10 futures contracts which normally cost $12,000 dollars with only $1,000 dollars in her account. This turned into $6,300 dollars by the next morning and after 10 months totaled $100,000, with trading help from James B. Blair.‚ÄúBlair, who at the time was outside counsel to Tyson Foods Inc., Arkansas' largest employer, says he was advising Clinton out of friendship, not to seek political gain. . ."  reports The WashingtonPost. Robert L.

17 | Anna Riggi | 10153995209705950_10153995213795950 | From the Wikileaks emails:An April 2015 email from Podesta to Palmieri on campaign rhetoric portraying Clinton as caring about American citizens has Podesta writing, ‚ÄúI know she has begun to hate everyday Americans, but I think we should use it once the first time she says I'm running for president because you and everyday Americans need a champion.
18 | Grace Olstenger | 10153995209705950_10153995222145950 | I'm sure it's tough for hillary to decide.  I mean, all the media has been so good to her, how would she ever pick which "journalist" to reward with a front seat at the debate?
19 | Wayne Haynes | 10153995209705950_10153995219450950 | Clinton should invite all of Trumps sexual assault victims, but then there wouldn't be room for anyone else.

22 | Wahaz Ahmed | 10153995209705950_10153995211310950 | Clinton should bring Alec Baldwin dressed up as Trump
23 | Lise Melin | 10153995209705950_10153995225165950 | If Trump thinks he has to resort to this kind of crass gimmickry to sway voters, the race is truly over. Alleluia!
24 | Janice Fairchild-Gindel | 10153995209705950_10153995228530950 | Hillary has more class in her pinkie than he has in his whole body!!!

The Clintons returned some of the furniture after pressure was put on them to do so.‚ÄúGOP lawmakers and others criticized Hillary Rodham Clinton in particular for accepting many presents just before she joined the Senate and became covered by strict ethics rules that prohibit accepting gifts worth more than $50.‚ÄùDrug Dealer Donor Scandal - Convicted drug trafficker Jorge Cabrera apparently made such a big donation to the Clinton‚Äôs campaign that he was invited to the White house without Secret Service present.Ponzi Scheme and Political Favor Scandal - Norman Yung Yuen Hsu was a convicted pyramid investment promoter, and major Democratic donor. He contributed an undisclosed amount to Hillary Clinton‚Äôs 2008 campaign. ‚ÄúHe was sentenced to more than 24 years in prison in 2009 by a judge who accused him of funding his fraud by manipulating the political process in a way that 'strikes at the very core of our democracy.‚ÄùBenghazi - Just watch thisHere is an article posted in the New York Times in 1996 entitled ‚ÄúBlizzard of Lies‚Äù about Hillary Clinton.The mega Clinton Foundation is also rife with cronyism and political favors.For a larger list of scandals associated with the Clintons, check out The Clinton Crime Library as this doesn't cover it all!

Putting our National security at risk is second hand news to CBS. I have watched this station for 53 years but no more. RIP Walter Cronkite you were a true journalist..

3 | Terri Brooks | 10153994874255950_10153994880245950 | Possible reasons why Trump is bringing Malik Obama, the President's half-brother, to tonight's debate:1. Malik Obama and Tiffany Trump can share their experiences in blended families.2. Malik, who supports the anti-Semitic terrorist group Hamas, can exchange views on Israel with Ivanka's Jewish husband Jared Kushner.3. Malik can share his admiration for and friendship with Mummar Ghadaffi, deceased dictator of Libya, with Trump's other guest, Pat Smith, mother of Sean Smith, who died in the Embassy attack in Benghazi in 2012.

They have broken laws, rigged elections, bought out the media & have taken over our government & made it more of a communist, dictatorship!!! I am heartbroken that so many people would rather stay ignorant to the truth and blindly follow Hilary and not read ONE DAMN EMAIL that was leaked!!! How can you love America & continue to support a woman who has sold our country out?!? HOW?!? This election has uncovered a lot of truth & so have these LEAKED EMAILS:: TRUTH that Hilary broke the law by having a server & having TOP SECRET, CLASSIFIED Information on her server; that Hilary will LIE TO YOUR FACE while you bury your child that she helped kill in Benghazi; Hilary hates Catholics, Gays, Arabs, Bernie Supporters & blacks (those super predators); Obama made sure the FBI didn't indite Hilary & emailed her knowing she had a private email account-(proving he also broke the law); the State department tried to BRIBE the FBI to Declassify some of Hilary's emails; the DNC rigged the system & stole the election from Bernie; tried to ruin Trump with sexual allegations that couldn't be denounced and proven false in time before the election- KNOWING that such allegations would be harmful even though they were NOT TRUE; the democrat party has set up people to fight at Trump rallies and to incite violence & have PAID THEM TO DO SO; Dead Democrats are voting; Hilary & Bill have sold out our country for MILLIONS of dollars to Countries that SHE KNEW WERE FUNDING ISIS!!!! How in the hell can you support the continued corruption in our government?!? If Hilary wins there will be NOTHING nor No branch of government to stop her!!! She has already proven that!!! Please take off your Republican & Democrat hat & start thinking like an American!!! This country is on her knees, with her head bent down and Hilary is holding the killing sword!!!! For the love of God----WAKE UP!!!!

10 | William Perry | 10153994874255950_10153994979120950 | During the primaries Mr Trump pointed to the polls as proof he was winning. Now, as he is losing, the polls and election are "rigged". I think Donald has a problem with losing. I agree with marco Rubio and John Kasich - your father is a loser, in every sense of the word.Look, here is the thing - Trump is highly unlikely to secure all the Electoral College votes he needs to win the November election, giving Hillary Clinton a current 95% chance of doing so, a new poll shows.The latest Electoral College predictions from the Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project, released on 15 October, show if the election was held now, the odds of Clinton gaining the required number of EC votes to win would be 95%, with a margin of 118 EC votes. As recent as this morning, The NY Times gave Mrs Clinton a 92% chance of winning.Some of us predicted similar results months ago. For example, my highest prediction was that Mrs Clinton would top 88%. Thanks to Mr Trump, I will apparently not win our local coffee shop election pool, however, I will get my Republican party released from the restraints of Donald Trump's mouth so it may rebuild itself in time for the 2024 election - perhaps Michelle Obama can run for the Democrats. I assure you that not all of us Republicans agree with or support Mr Trump. The Republican party (which I have been a member of for over 50 years) was headed for this situation it now finds itself in because of it's choices over many decades. Trump is merely the end result - like holding up a mirror reflecting back all that is gone wrong within the party. We may take solace, however - we have the next 8 years to sort ourselves out. I'm voting in the advanced polls on October 24th. I am voting for Mrs Clinton. Why? Because I love my country before my party.I believe that most Americans see the danger of this selective use of morality, as some cherry pick the elements that work for their campaigns. In addition, by allowing the immoral man which is Donald Trump to represent values for personal gain, we have further watered down what being a decent human-being is all about. Like country, our faith and morality must be above politics. Donald Trump has no defence for his behaviour and actions and represents the worse of our degraded fabric. I am ashamed of my party for enabling this man, giving him a voice. Let's see how much Trump brags and/or dismisses his behaviour come December's court date of his rape case of a 13-year-old girl.As one Republican I apologize. Although I never supported Mr Trump's candidacy I am ashamed that my party gave him a voice.

This debate has been turned to chaos, the lack of Integrity the Media has given it it's totally disgusting.The news should be reporting NEWS with FACTS, seems like they want to make TRUMP look so bad and deny the fact how this election is rigged. News/Media has done a great job at rigging this election. No wonder other Countries laugh at us, No wonder we are always under attack..There is no respect given by the media, yeah we all have a price and the media shows only bad things about Trump. We have all seen it and you can't deny that. I also know that I have my own mind and nothing the media does will change my mind. MY vote will ALWAYS be TRUMP.  if you think I get off by your junk posts, and think I'm one of followers that enjoys how you conduct yourself. You are so mistaken! Women coming forward now at the time of election claiming they were raped and stupid people believing it. Those are your followers News/Media. People hating the way Trump speaks. those people are your followers as well News/Media obviously people that  hate the way Trump speaks they don't like hearing the truth. So yeah keep them too.I don't feed on junk I feed on Facts! Tonight Debate does not matter to me, I have heard enough and seen enough. TRUMP 2016 ALL THE WAY

The Democratic National Committee has apologized after one of its campaign buses was spotted dumping raw sewage along a road.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Ryan Neil | 10153994751970950_10153994769070950 | That is a physical manifestation of the metaphorical dumping of shit they did at the convention by jamming a horrible candidate down our throats. Shame for that town but hilariously embarrassing for the DNC.
2 | Joseph Richard | 10153994751970950_10153994760750950 | Yep, because that's what Hillary's camp truly thinks of the American People. Shitting all over them every chance they get.
3 | Lora Grigonis | 10153994751970950_10153994785075950 | The DNC took responsibility, apologized, is taking steps to make sure it never happens again and is going to get the cleanup done.If this were the GOP, they would have hid the incident, denied it happened and blame the sewage on Hillary. If they got caught, they would just call it "boys will be boys."
4 | Helen M. Holdun | 10153994751970950_10153994801905950 | NOT A POLITICAL STATEMENT OF SUPPORT FOR ANYONE!Seriously! An "honest mistake"?  Is the personally toddlers, not to know human waste is a health risk!Because it's HRC supporters people will say ah, shucks it's alright and move on! If it were DT supporters, HRC supporters would add it to his growing list of s&&t storm. :)

6 | Michael Langdon | 10153994751970950_10153994835905950 | Just think, it is better than the no apology we got from Republicans for the thousands of dead soldiers and trillions of dollars spent going after Rumsfeld's WMD in Iraq.
7 | Francesca Sisto Di Emidio | 10153994751970950_10153994901640950 | These are regular everyday people driving and going around. Hillary can't be held responsible for everything someone does or says just because their democrats.
8 | Brigetta Jarnot | 10153994751970950_10153994908415950 | What good is a stinking apology coming from hillary?They knew it was wrong when they did it. They're on the self entitlement train (or bus as it is) . Did they reimburse the city for it? I highly doubt it. Man if that was Trump the media would be all over it non stop for the next several months. Media needs to get some balls and defy hillary and obama.
9 | Alex Beauliere | 10153994751970950_10153995418555950 | Yes.Thank you.That's the way it works.You do things that you know you shouldn't do, then you apologize like it was some kind of game.I'm imagining the same time done by a Trump bus tour.It would have been a national (even international) scandal.Mmhhhhhhhhhhh....
10 | Jared McManus | 10153994751970950_10153994806720950 | This is a horrible incident and I expect the media to cover this and bring it up as long as the election is still going on. I mean it's only fair. Apologies don't make things go away.
11 | Susan Strong | 10153994751970950_10153994820975950 | This was a decision by the bus driver. I suspect he was too lazy to get it handled as it should have been. To lay this at the feet of anyone else is nuts.
12 | Karen Beard | 10153994751970950_10153994930355950 | I am not happy with either major candidate. However, this episode is appalling. What is the education or common sense level of people who would do such a thing?
13 | Sarah E Wiggins | 10153994751970950_10153994920870950 | Yea she's a real class act. Let's go Forward Together Sewage And All. If this was Trump they including you would never stop focusing on it!
14 | Mark Stockman | 10153994751970950_10153995038120950 | I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and say they're city folks; the big/old cities still have combined storm and sanitary sewers (leftovers from horse-and-wagon days.)  In those cities, dumping sewage down a storm drain is no big deal, relatively speaking.
15 | Joe Furco | 10153994751970950_10153994812185950 | Wtf!I I had done this the local fine is $50KThe federal is $175KAnd EPA another $25K plus I get to pay the clean up costs Saying sorry don't get it Only a clinton is above the law#lockherup
16 | Randy Dees | 10153994751970950_10153994827710950 | She's morally UNFIT and legally INELIGIBLE. Fact check THAT! You LYING HACKS!!

17 | Bart Johnson | 10153994751970950_10153994902445950 | They was trying to flush Hillary but it got stopped up!!! But this bus shows you how the DNC has been running this country and will keep running if Hillary gets in!! It's what they think of the people in this country they don't care
18 | Terrance Smops | 10153994751970950_10153995072405950 | It was the bus company and its employee. It would not be different if your trash service picked up your trash. Then dumped it in a ditch someplace. The authorities will go to it and find mail they will assign responsibilities to you and then you would have to sue your trash company.
19 | Paul Wilkerson | 10153994751970950_10153995298360950 | I bet she Didn't get charged with anything Again! Any other fool who did this kind of crap would've gotten EPA violations and charges out the Ying yang,......
20 | Dustin McDonald | 10153994751970950_10153995097825950 | They are just following Clinton standard operational procedure. Do illegal things and say you didn't know any better while claiming it only happened once and really wasn't that bad.
21 | Robb Allen | 10153994751970950_10153994874615950 | Liberals only apologized after they've been caught and then they say it was an accident. They never admit that it was willful and that they shouldn't have done it
22 | Amanda Miller | 10153994751970950_10153994844970950 | If anyone else would have done this it would be a huge fine dumping hazardous waste but nope not good ole Hillary sure seems she's above the law
23 | L Ann Myers Lovelady | 10153994751970950_10153995117240950 | If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin and heal their land. 2 Chronicles 7:14
24 | Johnny Seely | 10153994751970950_10153994849930950 | They going to pay for the clean up. And why did it happen in the first place. Aren't the Democrats supposed to be the green party environmentalists all that bull shit.
25 | Dan Wehr | 10153994751970950_10153994802825950 | That's not fair, every time Trump walks off the bus, the RNC bus is dumping its shit. Where's the apology?

1 | Ryan Myers | 10153994705085950_10153994712850950 | If you don't like it, don't work there, its that simple. Perhaps if low skilled workers weren't flooding our country desperate to find a job and willing to work for pennies on the dollar, we wouldn't be having this issue.
2 | Tammi Fleming Hauhuth | 10153994705085950_10153994709150950 | Hey CBS news....why don't you report on Hillary Clinton's crimes once in AWHILE?
3 | Mason Hager | 10153994705085950_10153994748560950 | If trump doesn't listen to you honey just quit it's a job you don't get what you want. Plus it's a bit hard to understand you. Another thing this shows is the media reporting these useless things that they put out just before a debate to slam trump without actually saying it.
4 | P Terry Tah | 10153994705085950_10153994770720950 | Trump supporters are very stupid, did you know people with broken English  are smarter than you because they can speak more than one language. Plus all you white trashers, you all are pilgrims, remember that shit, you dumb fucksüñïüñïüñïüñï
5 | Bill Hughes | 10153994705085950_10153994740340950 | Unions suck :PEspecially in the Hotel environment. I worked for the Hilton Americas in Houston Texas and the only thing that the union cared about was the union.
6 | Kelly Ann | 10153994705085950_10153994783525950 | Ratings...That's all this BS is about. Wonder how well your ratings will be if we boycott you. Especially since this channel is all about trump. Haven't seen Hillary !!Shows and speaks Volumes ....
7 | Andrei Scutea | 10153994705085950_10153994731190950 | Don't worry if you want to work for "Corruption" like Hillary. Good! Now let's prosecute Hillary corrupt Clinton who wants open borders for druglords, human traffickers, Fast and Furious deals.....etc.üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°Almost 20 years past since Columbine and Hillary corrupt Clinton did nothing to secure schools both Nationally and Internationally. Still no security! Meanwhile Obamascam with his new normal lies campaigns for Corrupt Hillary, spending taxpayers money for 8 years of campaigning.
8 | Robin Craig | 10153994705085950_10153994721070950 | The efforts to stop them from forming a union are not unique to trump. So please don't report this like he is the first or only rich person to try and keep their employees poor.
9 | Desi Fasone | 10153994705085950_10153994905830950 | This is what trump is saying the systems are rigged!! Bullshit news! Give me a break, speaking like that where else you going to get work, be greatful you have a job! Hope he fires your ass!!!!
10 | Alexandria Hill-Weikart | 10153994705085950_10153994808165950 | So trumps a bad guy for not liking unions???!!! Look at unions, like Detroit... Oh wait Detroit turned into a third world country that's been govern by democrats for centuries...... Hmmmm.... I think I'll side with trump.... FYI I worked for a union, and I had to pay dues and they couldn't represent me bc I was under 18, their way to collect money and not to have to do shit, that's what unions are....
11 | Gary Eckman | 10153994705085950_10153994754155950 | Trump is a Racist FOOL. But at least he is a rapist too. So hes more than just a bigot, hes a russian loving fat pig also. Many people are telling me he is going to lose, because they hate rapists. I think he will lose because people tell me he is a Failure. SAD.
12 | Omar Jackson | 10153994705085950_10153994924640950 | Sections of America would rather go broke n sell it's country to Russia for pennies on the dollar than to allow blacks an equal opportunity.. this country spend billions on tax dollars annually to make way to keep African American down.. example some cops rather make his/her city pay millions to victim's family to beat/kill one to experience the 60s for kicks.. that's why ain't many jobs.. your city gotta make way to afford to pay the lawsuits.. so tell ur racist buddies to quit the bs..
13 | Barbara Ebright Luciani | 10153994705085950_10153995145195950 | She is lucky to have that job, she cannot even speak english.  We all paid our dues.  You take what you can and work your way up.  I made 60 cents an hour in 1970.  Worked my way up to corporate level, by going to school and learning.  Yes, I cleaned toilets.  At the end of my career I made $65,000 a year.
14 | Angela Watson | 10153994705085950_10153995218900950 | Well, she's fired. Another woman will surely feel blessed to take over her job.This Summer I had the pleasure staying at the Trump Towers in Chicago. A lot of workers that work there love their jobs and when a couple of them told me roughly how much they got paid, they get paid very well with great benefits. There was a house keeper there whom was Ukrainian, she told me a story about her 2nd child that had cancer and how Mr. Trump heard about this dishearting story, Mr. Trump helped the family out with paying medical bills and made sure they had everything. So, yes Mr. Trump takes care of his employees.
15 | Chris Barker Sr. | 10153994705085950_10153995082115950 | Way to go CBS!! Another example of your liberal reporting. Are you gonna report about Hillary's dumping of human shit from her campaign bus in the streets of a US town. To which they replied, " we didn't know that wasn't legal". Haha. I bet not. Fuck you CBS. Another main stream media outlet blocked by thousands.  Keep up the less than mediocre work
16 | Tim de Voe | 10153994705085950_10153994718875950 | Theres tons of businesses and corporations that dont want unions. Why dont you ever do a report on them? Ive seen at least 20 protests around in my area in the last 2 years over companies and businesses hiring non-union construction companies over unionised ones. But that doesn't fit your cause so its of no purpose to you guys.
17 | Vincent Teets | 10153994705085950_10153995591165950 | She seems very smart, she should start her own business and run it how she wants. Why work for someone else hey I think Primarica is looking for self starting go getters!
18 | Donnie Conley | 10153994705085950_10153995151040950 | Who runs the US? Apparently George Soros.The liberal billionaire funder, who has been tied to a globalist elite pushing the Muslim migrant crisis and multiculturalism onto Western societies, comes up a lot in private discussions between top Hillary Clinton campaign officials.A search by American Lookout showed Soros has been mentioned at least 56 times throughout the 11 batches of emails put out by Wikileaks which show collusion between elites, the mainstream media and the Hillary campaign.Likewise, Soros was directly mentioned in multiple subject headlines on emails, often times requesting a meeting with top Clinton official, John Podesta.
19 | John Wilson | 10153994705085950_10153994874330950 | The Enquirer writes:‚ÄúI arranged a meeting for Hillary and a woman in an exclusive Beverly Hills hotel,‚Äù the man, who was hired by the Clintons, via a Hollywood executive, to cover up their scandals, told The ENQUIRER.‚ÄúShe had come to the studio to see the filming of a movie in 1994.‚Äù‚ÄúWhile I was there, I helped her slip out of a back exit for a one-on-one session with the other woman. It was made to look casual, leaving quietly [rather] that being caught up in the melee ‚Ä¶ but really it was for something presumably more sordid.‚ÄùWhat‚Äôs more, it wasn‚Äôt just Hillary‚Äôs flings with women that the shadowy Mr. Fix It helped to orchestrate!Hillary‚Äôs former bagman finally confessed to The ENQUIRER just how he helped her to cover up her affair with married lover Vince Foster, too!
20 | Arlene Haberly | 10153994705085950_10153994893830950 | Donald Trump is the only hope that America has that lying criminal Hillary will destroy America or she will sell us out to the highest bidder
21 | Evelyn Hacker | 10153994705085950_10153994886025950 | I had to watch it 3 times to understand, what she said. Usa, the land of opportunity, even for those, who don't even speak basic English.
22 | Tanya Rivera | 10153994705085950_10153995424575950 | So what....Unions are all employers nightmare...employers do try to fight it...Trump isn't the first and certainly will not be the last.
23 | Deborah Adams | 10153994705085950_10153995135540950 | He's a business man- of course he's going to go against a union.  However his buildings have been built using a union work force.
24 | Shane Caudill | 10153994705085950_10153994941710950 | If you don't like it , don't work there. But remember, it has to do with you trying to push unions in his company and not about your ethnicity
25 | William Perry | 10153994705085950_10153994860125950 | During the primaries Mr Trump pointed to the polls as proof he was winning. Now, as he is losing, the polls and election are "rigged". I think Donald has a problem with losing.Look, here is the thing - Trump is highly unlikely to secure all the Electoral College votes he needs to win the November election, giving Hillary Clinton a current 95% chance of doing so, a new poll shows.The latest Electoral College predictions from the Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project, released on 15 October, show if the election was held now, the odds of Clinton gaining the required number of EC votes to win would be 95%, with a margin of 118 EC votes. As recent as this morning, The NY Times gave Mrs Clinton a 92% chance of winning.Some of us predicted similar results months ago. For example, my highest prediction was that Mrs Clinton would top 88%. Thanks to Mr Trump, I will apparently not win our local coffee shop election pool, however, I will get my Republican party released from the restraints of Donald Trump's mouth so it may rebuild itself in time for the 2024 election - perhaps Michelle Obama can run for the Democrats. I assure you that not all of us Republicans agree with or support Mr Trump. The Republican party (which I have been a member of for over 50 years) was headed for this situation it now finds itself in because of it's choices over many decades. Trump is merely the end result - like holding up a mirror reflecting back all that is gone wrong within the party. We may take solace, however - we have the next 8 years to sort ourselves out. I'm voting in the advanced polls on October 24th. I am voting for Mrs Clinton. Why? Because I love my country before my party.I believe that most Americans see the danger of this selective use of morality, as some cherry pick the elements that work for their campaigns. In addition, by allowing the immoral man which is Donald Trump to represent values for personal gain, we have further watered down what being a decent human-being is all about. Like country, our faith and morality must be above politics. Donald Trump has no defence for his behaviour and actions and represents the worse of our degraded fabric. I am ashamed of my party for enabling this man, giving him a voice. Let's see how much Trump brags and/or dismisses his behaviour come December's court date of his rape case of a 13-year-old girl.As one Republican I apologize. Although I never supported Mr Trump's candidacy I am ashamed that my party gave him a voice.
