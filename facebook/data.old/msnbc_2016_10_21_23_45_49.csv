1 | Meghan Brown | 1328060340623548_1328085487287700 | Bernie supporters need to understand that Bernie can still have a major impact in our government...if we flip Congress, Bernie gets a very important promotion.
2 | Barbara Jean Kilpatrick DeZan | 1328060340623548_1328090233953892 | They both have always wanted the same things.  Here's the difference.....Bernie waved his hands and pointed his fingers and said "we gotta do this" and "we gotta do that" and "i'm gonna do this and that".......without a plan or an idea how or an agenda.  Hillary says it, with a full thought out plan on the how, the when the where, the cost and how to pay for it.  It's why she beat him....and why she will be president.
3 | Troy Pressley | 1328060340623548_1328093460620236 | This crappy page has 1.6 million followers. Seems like a lot, until you see that the Fox page has 13.5 million followers. Hillary will only win a rigged election, just like she won the democratic nomination. The proof is in the number of followers. Look at the two pages. The numbers don't lie.
4 | Rudy Gadrey | 1328060340623548_1328083790621203 | Moore has to believe Hillary is magically accepting what he wants.or else he would have to admit his beliefs are simply unrealistic, which is exactly how Bernie got rejected in the first place. progressives are admirable, except when they become completely full of themselves, just like arrogant conservatives. Hillary doesn't need Bernbots; Trump killed himself.
5 | Jennifer Yager Carbaugh | 1328060340623548_1328105750619007 | And now if you didn't know how desperate the dem party is, here you go. Moore has been saying even though a democrat that Trump will win. He brought up how Michigan was a Bernie state amongst others and he would have won against her. He is for the liar and is taking a final chance to voice for her. She is done and the government needs cleaned out.
6 | Lynda Hilburn | 1328060340623548_1328096977286551 | I'm really sick of still hearing people (like MM) say that Sanders was the second coming and HRC is "flawed." Nothing Sanders did impressed me -- not as a senator or a presidential candidate -- and he did so much harm to Hillary by using GOP talking points against her that he's as responsible as Trump for all the stupid things voters repeat about her. She had to run against two bullying, cult-leader men, after being attacked constantly for decades, and I completely admire her. Save your "she moved closer to Sanders and now she's almost tolerable" BS. She was amazing. She is amazing. She will be amazing. HRC 2016.
7 | Gim Sue | 1328060340623548_1328093200620262 | As a Independent I dont understand  How anyone is supporting either,, they both lie they both racist, they both have done nothing but run smear campaigns.. Does anyone actually search things out for them selves  or do you just continue to take the word of corporate media?  just curious ..
8 | Greg Rice | 1328060340623548_1328091910620391 | Just watched Lawrence O'Donnels final thoughts. He is the most despicable biased political hack I've ever seen! No wonder your ratings are the lowest in the business!
9 | Jonathan Epstein | 1328060340623548_1328103913952524 | Hillary's going to be far more adept than Obama at implementing progressive programs and causes. The Bernie folks, weened on propaganda, are going to be quite surprised.
10 | Mike Franklin | 1328060340623548_1328106643952251 | Chill out folks, Hillary can't break 50 with Obama, Michelle, Biden, the media, and Bernie all campaigning for her, her lead is not natural/organic, you will see a massive shift the final week, what goes up always comes down. I've been a professional WS trader for 20 years.. The election process, polls, odds, bookmaking are the same as the financial markets..Hillary is overbought right now, think of her as a stock going into a bad earnings,  that crashes and burns, enjoy the irrational exuberance right now..based on the current graphs,  I would much rather place money on Trump..
11 | Pamela Ruhnow Nagel | 1328060340623548_1328103290619253 | If the majority of the country thinks we are going in the wrong direction why has no one figured out why they think that?  What are the things people think would lead us in the right direction?
12 | Adolfo Aiello | 1328060340623548_1328116050617977 | If you vote for Hillary then you are voting for Globalism which means open borders and removes tariffs on imports. This makes it attractive for corporations to invest on cheap capital and cheap labor overseas. This sends the jobs that people depend on right out of this country. Not to mention the open borders for foreign companies to compete in our domestic market driving small businesses out of business. Corporations love Globalism and Regional Trade Agreements because it makes their profits sky rocket. Hillary supports Globalism and the corporations love her for it. Don't vote for Hillary if you are in favor of Protectionism and against more globalism.
13 | Margaret Reddy | 1328060340623548_1328093363953579 | And she will continue to bring people together when she is in the White House if we can get rid of the hate!
14 | Christopher Hughey | 1328060340623548_1328096173953298 | That's funny, Mikey. Just a few months ago you were spreading defeatist propaganda because, being the #whinylittlebitch you are, you threw a tainty because your guy (I should say "our" since I voted for him, too) didn't win the nomination. Now what was that piece you wrote again? Can't remember exactly....something like "Why Trump Will Definitely Win"....? Something to that effect. But here you are cashing in on "evil" Hillary. You are truly repulsive.
15 | Brant Houston | 1328060340623548_1328098710619711 | When you keep taxing the rich and corporations, where will the jobs come from ?? Do you think they will stay here and be taxed into poverty ?? No, they will take their money and run.
16 | Nikki Myles | 1328060340623548_1328087797287469 | For all Bernie people that are still mad about the primary. GET OVER IT, Bernie has, this is bigger than him.
17 | Bob Staffa | 1328060340623548_1328092057287043 | Michael is an American treasure. If you piss off the right wingers that much, you're doing everything right.
18 | Eric Lewis | 1328060340623548_1328085020621080 | NBC Nothing But Clinton network working overtime in desperation mode.
19 | Pete McGuire | 1328060340623548_1328088647287384 | When two lovers meet there is fireworks KISS him don't hold back lol Trump 2016
20 | Carol Bradle | 1328060340623548_1328087930620789 | I am a basement dweller and I could never Trust the Clinton's .Voting Trump.
21 | Michael David McLinn | 1328060340623548_1328086827287566 | Good seeing Michael again. Looking forward to seeing the movie.
22 | Elaine Kelly Randle | 1328060340623548_1328088147287434 | My gosh, does ANYBODY at MSNBC care about fairness...its horrible, even if you're not a Trump supporter...
23 | Elyse Ferragamo | 1328060340623548_1328088067287442 | Lawrence, your really trying, but it's not working.  The Day After. Lol no Oscar for you tonight.
24 | Paula Lambert Quinn | 1328060340623548_1328096303953285 | I appreciate Bernie Sanders but, this is HILLARY'S Time.This has definitely been the most bizarre presidential elections ever.#NEVERTRUMP#VOTEBLUE
25 | Billy Thomas | 1328060340623548_1328103377285911 | Michael moore should kill himself. Then we can move forward as a country.

1 | Pj Cates | 717543998410628_717568158408212 | Ohh brother, you can not take Hillary Clinton serious on anything but corruption, MSNBC after this election you will be lucky to have a 100 people watching you can not be trusted as honest coverage
2 | Gisela Rodriguez | 717543998410628_717555925076102 | What make even bad about Trump and his supporters; that he starting and brought to forth front. All the sexist and Racists in America that existed out of the Shadows. To your next door neighbor and coworkers to the guy walking next to you...and all  you folks think this is acceptable...he pretty much  destroy the GOP, obliterated Christianity and send democracy to the gutter..He is down  right just simply ...a stupid man.
3 | Meghan Brown | 717543998410628_717552218409806 | She's right...Chump supporters please remember that the Hitler "touched" his followers as well...WAKE UP CONS before you continue going down the same path as the Nazi's did.
4 | Mimi Cherie | 717543998410628_717550878409940 | Attention Visitors: The Trumpanzees are currently in the midst of one of their frequent poo flinging fests. For your own well-being please do not attempt to engage, inform or feed the animals as they process their grief, but feel free to scroll through and observe their antics as they rage among themselves.Management greatly appreciates your patience and self-discipline.
5 | Gary Doan | 717543998410628_717551511743210 | All voters should take a look at all Democrat politicians, judging by the video that exposes Democrat goon squads in every major city that incite violence. "Want something dirty done, yeah, I got a guy for that". Their goal is to intimidate the opposition supporters and impact races at all levels, using the media. They paid for violence, only to blame on the opposition. Is that acceptable in America?
6 | Anthony Greenlees | 717543998410628_717556368409391 | The name Hillary Clinton leaves such a negative connotation in conversation. Invokes words such as failure, hypocrite, terrorist, knucklehead, pseudo-intellect, loser, etc. So reassuring after viewing these e-mails that Hillary is exactly who we thought she was.
7 | Debbie French-Luna | 717543998410628_717559808409047 | You don't have to like Clinton to vote for her you only need to like being lied to ,care nothing about 3rd term babies being murdered, OPEN BORDER HEMISPHERE, Clinton calling people of the usa deplorable, non redeemable, trolls, basement dwellers, anyone who doesn't vote for her gets called names, has her campaign hire people to cause problems at rally, has our military killed because she can't be bothered to answer a 3 o'clock phone call then left them there to die.,has had scandals on her her whole career, Haiti now wants Clinton foundation audited because charities of about 8 percent went to charities so I guess you don't have to like Clinton to vote for her but if you like America you don't need to vote for her.
8 | Stoney Williamson | 717543998410628_717553621742999 | Indeed there is something new in the air! The lies and criminal acts of Hillary and her associates is coming to the public compliments of Wikileaks. There is no need for the "mainstream media" anymore. You people attempt to silence the proof of Hillary and her cohorts, you divert any questions in reference to the revelations that has been revealed to the public! When confronted with what has been done at her direction or on her behalf she blames Russia. She does not deny the emails, she blames someone else for informing the world of her criminal activity.
9 | John Meshna | 717543998410628_717559735075721 | Obama made a lot of great speeches and still is a great orator who, if you weren't paying attention to what he actually does and has done in comparison to what he's said or is saying, you would be moved as well.  Unfortunately good debate prep and soaring oratory haven't translated into  good government for and by the people for a long time.
10 | Andrew Kotis | 717543998410628_717563878408640 | Very good....I like to thank the gentleman on your right Hillary for covering the ladies cleavage with his head because I couldn't focus?you should be careful Hillary who's behind you ,people loose focus!
11 | Sandra Armour | 717543998410628_717593891738972 | Trump causes violence at his rally's by saying Get um outta here, punch him the face. His supporters hit people, get arrested, hit a 70 year old woman. He tells his mugs, he'll pay for their lawyer. ( yeah don't count on it the way he pays his help or a contractor) Talks nasty about everything. oh byw, number ten woman came out today. Said trump groped her at the U.S. open. All these women saying trump sexually did something is not lies. Better in numbers.

14 | Tim Murrell | 717543998410628_717568831741478 | the lives she touches are lives left very short,[around 9 months] you should hope and everyone stupid enough to vote for you should hope the good Lord doesnt judge you on the "lives you touched"SMh.

17 | Jack Morris | 717543998410628_717565935075101 | I guess she is right. Bill Clintons touched a lot of lives that we know for fact. I suppose as long as we give a tender touch, that's far more important than creating jobs. ( to a liberal that is)
18 | Kathryn McNair | 717543998410628_717570148408013 | You've touched a lot of lives this summer when you cheated Bernie out of the nomination. You are a liar, cheater, and very greedy person for power.
19 | Debbie French-Luna | 717543998410628_717574485074246 | Clinton/George Soros your next president so enjoy those open borders you so want Isis will be visiting you soon.

23 | John Daniels | 717543998410628_717563208408707 | Catholics strongly oppose abortion.  So Hillary, you are not on the same level as a Catholic.  Also, Catholics don't have a teaching on climate change.
24 | Tony Johnson | 717543998410628_717564531741908 | 😂😂 @PeepingDon👀 seem to have lost most of his toughness. He's being spanked by a woman and beginning to whine like a child who's starting to cry!
25 | Jeanne Brooks-Miller | 717543998410628_717596748405353 | The Pope's Message To Catholics :However, last night made it abundantly clear that Donald Trump is a pro-life candidate and Hillary Clinton is not. And I’ll leave you with Fr. Michael Orsi:"We are in a battle for the soul of America…Somehow, [Christians] have come to buy the story that you cannot be political in church. Let me tell you right now, oh yes, you can, and oh, yes, you better be. Because you might not have a church to go to if you don’t vote the right way in November.”

1 | Liberty Pierce | 1130637720353995_1130647850352982 | I have talked with several Republicans this week (family & friends) who were swayed to the HRC camp. They just weren't convinced by Trump! He couldn't keep it together well enough, they were holding out hope.
2 | Piero Morse | 1130637720353995_1130639637020470 | Donald Trump is visiting a elementary school and he visits one of the classes.They are in the middle of a discussion related to words and their meanings. The teacher asks Mr Trump if he would like to lead the discussion of the word "tragedy." So he asks the class for an example of a tragedy. One little boy stands up and offers: "If my best friend who lives on a farm, is playing in the field and a runaway tractor comes along and knocks him dead, that would be a tragedy." "No," says Mr Trump, "that would be an accident." A little girl raises her hand: "If a school bus carrying 50 children drove over a cliff, killing everyone inside, that would be a tragedy." "I'm afraid not," explains the fraud businessman. "That's what we would call a great loss." The room goes silent. No other children volunteer. Donald searches the room. "Isn't there someone here who can give me an example of a tragedy?" Finally at the back of the room, little Johnny raises his hand. In a quiet voice he says: "If a private jet carrying you was struck by a missile and blown to smithereens, that would be a tragedy." "Fantastic!" exclaims trump, "That's right. And can you tell me why that would be a tragedy?" "Well," says the boy, "because it sure as hell wouldn't be a great loss and it probably wouldn't be an accident either."
3 | Donna Brockway | 1130637720353995_1130684603682640 | You got that right Chris, it's the women vote now, it's our time and we are going to put the first woman President in office and screw Donald Mr Wackadoodle! You predator, that had no business running, thanks to the GOP, thanks for nothing! You idiots!
4 | Beatrice Florina Florescu-Boomhower | 1130637720353995_1130656590352108 | Unfortunately for him he lost every single debate and even managed to get booed and heckled at the dinner, so as the panic sets in, more insults and attacks are coming. Yes, there is something new in the air: the smell of defeat, the smell of fear for not being able to deliver on the promises made... many people are saying this is very disappointing, I don't know but many people are saying... believe me!
5 | Deanna Burkart | 1130637720353995_1130664033684697 | Keep trying to paint that picture liberals. I am seeing more and more people that are commenting on how obvious it is that the media is trying to mislead the public. It's working, so keep it up!
6 | Peter Rivera | 1130637720353995_1130671690350598 | More media garbage, now there worried they will lose that why there hyping how bad thing are with Trump, they are going hyping in hopes that Hillary will win they know she is a dead horse in this race no i know likes Hillary, but realy don't like her...
7 | Anthony Greenlees | 1130637720353995_1130645907019843 | Sunshine? Seriously? You arrogant twit. Hillary Clinton is a domestic terrorist. She should not be in this race for the White House. She is not trustworthy. The most unpatriotic candidate to ever run. She put lives in danger and put this countries National Security in jeopardy. And yet she is still free to walk and campaign. Are you fkn kidding me?! She wins this election then she and she alone will incite a Civil War.

11 | Randy Viosca | 1130637720353995_1130672163683884 | I think that Hillary and Donald have come to an agreement of sorts. He's not going to bring up the new sexual harrassment allegations against Bill (Leslie Millwee, 1980 Ark), and she's not going to bring up his pending rape trial of a 13 yr old girl at Epstein's house. You'll notice he didn't bring up Millwee despite inviting her to the debate. I think this must have been a last minute agreement saving us all from mutually assured destruction debate.
12 | David King | 1130637720353995_1130686803682420 | I can't believe you people are willing to ignore that she did indeed put our national security at risk. She takes money from countries that treat women horribly, kills gay people, and pretty much anyone else that doesn't agree with them. I can't believe this doesn't matter to you people. #neverhillary #wakeup
13 | Ben Henderson | 1130637720353995_1130660460351721 | Because of your Propaganda MSNBC ... Because of the justice department and the Obama administration rigging our system and having one set of laws for them and HILIERY and another for 4 Star Generals... Because the DNC paid to have Americans attacked which is criminal... I wouldn't concede either

18 | Jim Tracey Hildreth | 1130637720353995_1130649117019522 | Wallace gave Hillary a 1:30 on 1 of her questions uninterrupted and then went to Trump for 10 seconds and interrupted him twice! You asked her about the Clinton Foundation for Haiti she deflected the answer to shots for children for AIDS and never talked about Haiti because they never helped the people of Haiti!Wallace said she was in favor of open boarders and she turned it into power grids and trade and that isn't what is asked her.Over and Over and questions she didn't want to answer honestly she steered it in a different direction. Hillary took one question and steered it to Trump and Putin, have to give her credit a lier thinks quick on their feet and her supporters don't even catch it!

She is just too corrupt and could not convince them that she will be any different a couple weeks from now. Even the CNN poll after debates showed the same thing.
20 | Joe Moser | 1130637720353995_1130663757018058 | The system has been rigged for over 200 years it's a fact, it was set up that way so an outsider could not become President, that's why they set up the party system. It explains it in the civics books from the mid 1980s and older, you will never find it on Google because Google is part of the system, they only let you see what they want.

New polling shows Donald J. Trump holding on to narrow leads in traditionally red states, while Hillary Clinton is opening up a sizeable lead in key battleground states.

2 | Stefan HG | 1130604097024024_1130605257023908 | Democrats have always opposed common sense Voter Fraud preventative measures vigorously! And in light of the corrupt Democratic primary in which Bernie was sidelined, it's reasonable to conclude that this election is being rigged in favor of Corrupt Hillary!
3 | Margaret Graham | 1130604097024024_1130660277018406 | Wow a whole 385 people, while millions are on trumps page haha what a joke you people are going down . Such a dumb move in ur behalf of only covering her because you may have had more ratings - MOONBATS
4 | Mary McCarson | 1130604097024024_1130625810355186 | Our big government stinks with corruption.  Don’t believe “the polls.”  The media is lying to us, or at least ignoring the truth.  The media is no longer credible. Corruption has very long tentacles reaching out to all branches of government; even the once respected Federal Bureau of Investigation is under suspicion and causes us to ask: “Where can we go now to uncover the truth?”  Have they too been bought-off?The historically racist democrats celebrate publicly the little crumbs they give the African-Americans exaggerating the benefits to keep the black vote.  President Johnson, who promised “The Great Society” was heard to say, “I’ll have those n*ggers voting Democratic for the next 200 years.”President Dwight D. Eisenhower, Republican, Championed the Civil Rights Act of 1957 and was supported unanimously by “Republicans.”  Can you guess who opposed?  That’s right—Democrats in the Senate who filibustered it.  President Harry Truman (D) – Unabashed Racist:  “I think one man is just as good an another so long as he’s not a n*gger or a Chinaman. The first Republican President set the tone for the Party when he penned the Emancipation Proclamation, freeing the slaves—Abraham Lincoln.From the KU KLUX KLAN to Hillary Clinton the Democrats have been the racist party, but they want us to believe it’s the Republicans.  The real history the Democrats don’t want you to know is well covered in the documentary film “Hillary's America” The secret history of the Democratic Party.  It is now available on DVD.  Every true American wants the truth—it’s all there. See it for yourself.  Please don’t bury your head in the sand; you’d look ridiculous.The Democrats push their shame on their opposition—the Republican Party which has always obstructed their way to complete dictatorial power.
5 | Ginger Spelts | 1130604097024024_1130638403687260 | Well about everybody I know is voting for Trump. Only 1 or 2 might be voting for her, Good luck! Think you counting your chickens before they hatch.  I truly believe a lot of people is coming out for Trump on Nov. 8th. A group I meet with decided not to mail in votes unless we really had to, Mail -in votes might get tainted.. Just got to make sure we get to the polls on Nov. 8th, even if we are dying. We have pledged that nothing will stop us! #OnlyTrump2016
6 | Andrew Poisell | 1130604097024024_1130708767013557 | I think the media and liberal base are highly underestimating what kind of voter turnout trump will have. Or maybe they do and that's why you can't turn on the news without seeing him somewhere every few minutes. They have thrown 100s of millions of dollars and the entire kitchen at him. Even with that being said I don't believe he wins. Even if he gets the popular vote. I am voting for him. Guess we will see.
7 | Chris Ellis | 1130604097024024_1130698227014611 | You're voting for hillary!! you should apologize to America and explain your self!!! quote, #JillStein: "Hillary's laughter at the lynching of an African ruler was frankly disturbing. She left Libya in bloody chaos. "
8 | Cindy Dahlgren Spangler | 1130604097024024_1130629293688171 | Chris Hayes just did a spot on what other Presidents were doing 18 days before the election...and that last clip showing George Wallace getting a rally shut down by protestors was a fabulous piece of work. I was 8 years old in 1968, barely remember seeing similar protests on TV during that time. And I remember knowing that a man named George Wallace was a "bad man". Which means my parents raised us kids right. And why seeing Trump reprise the role of "the bad man" is so sickening.

2 | Larry West | 1542363559117002_1542419885778036 | Not cool, Biden, not cool.You can't decry someone wanting violence and then do it yourself. I sincerely hope he apologizes. Trump is terrible in so many ways, do we really want to lower ourselves to his level?
3 | John Wendt | 1542363559117002_1542403909112967 | Just another part of the #AmeriKanNightmare: Even Biden believes in lynch mob mentality and beatings behind the bikeshed ... for f...k's sake what is AmeriKa coming to when even the leaders suggest violence is the answer to everything. That is the Chicago gangsta mentality taking over all walks of life.
4 | Gary Brookshire | 1542363559117002_1542418742444817 | Here's proof that Trump's good enough. Just look at Biden making threats. Typical, Billy Bob and his little lady deny and attack Billy Bob's victims. Never heard Joe Bob here threatening him. Instead, the hypocrite pounds his chest over Trump. What a moron...
5 | Jed Wagner | 1542363559117002_1542496309103727 | The media double standard..  It's Gone beyond humorous to anyone who listens to this one sided cr*p needs to have their head examined... If it's Not OK for a republican to threaten violence.. It's not ok for a democrat
6 | Frankie Ladwig | 1542363559117002_1542454229107935 | No different than Trump saying he would like to punch him in the throat. But, hey its Biden, it's ok for him to be violent. You hypocrites!
7 | Patsy Wolfe | 1542363559117002_1542527915767233 | Hush Joe Biden.. Your a fine one to talk about Trump.. When I've seen you all over women to talk to.. what's on your mine when you do this openly on national television.. please..!
8 | Joanne Magee | 1542363559117002_1542471795772845 | Bringing jobs back to America ?? Maybe he means all the attorneys and administrators needed for his business failures , and certainly he's responsible for the employment explosion in fact checkers.

13 | Char Koontz Creel Stevens | 1542363559117002_1542419155778109 | I totally get it now. It just occurred to me that all of the negativity toward Trump is because they WANT him to win the election! It's reverse psychology. If they continue to give him negative press and say he's down in the polls, it will make people want to get out and vote for him. We can't let everybody down, so get out and vote for Trump!
14 | Cindy Dahlgren Spangler | 1542363559117002_1542470095773015 | Joe fantasizing about taking Trump behind the gym has me imagine him being everybody's big brother and knock out the school bully that's been picking on all the smaller kids for years.

16 | Chris Peckham | 1542363559117002_1542399195780105 | What has America come to, where nearly half her citizens are willing to vote for the presidential candidate that is willing to kill babies in the ninth month of pregnancy.  Hillary admitted this in the 3rd debate and will appoint Supreme Court justices that agree with her. And of these voters the ones that say they're Christians, how can you sit in Gods house, and say you're Christian, and think killing babies in the ninth month of pregnancy is OK. You should be ashamed of yourself.
17 | Constance A Marshall | 1542363559117002_1542507525769272 | Say it ain't so Joe, don't give an apology as I want to be with you when we take Trump behind the gym! Aren't we supposed to stand up to bullies?

You people make me sick all that violence came from the Democratic Party and blaming Trump supporters. I'm jumping ship to Trump I had enough from all y'all lies and deceit!!!!
19 | Stan Samaland | 1542363559117002_1542405592446132 | Lol, creepy Joe who's been know to get a little too personal with women is talking about violence as the answer.  Good to see that hypocrisy isn't exclusive to the right.
20 | Duke Slade | 1542363559117002_1542397872446904 | This is your moment. This is your time to take a stand. When your grandchildren speak of you they will recount that you stood for America. You did not surrender. You did not run away. You held strong for freedom and the Constitution. You defeated Hillary Clinton. You voted Trump. You ensured that America survived.
21 | Wash Syl | 1542363559117002_1542432155776809 | I completely understand howyou-all feel. This election feelslike it has been going on forever.No matter who you vote for, pplare just so tired.Lord what is waiting for us ?
22 | Desiree Seal | 1542363559117002_1542568202429871 | My final thoughts on Hillary's America and I will try not to use caps.First, I've always prided myself on the illusion that I'm quite familiar with our history, shamefully I was quite wrong. I've always been one to fight for the underdog, probably because I am one. This movie shocked me in terms of how little I knew about my own selection of a government party - Democrats. For, you see, I'm a registered Democrat.I always prided myself on the illusion that they are all about helping and I couldn't be further from the truth. In reality, the Democrats are a spawn of evil that was birthed by, none other than, our government.It started with Jackson and stretched its ugly arms from there. Jackson fought to maintain slaverly and was an obscene man who beat and raped his slaves without hiding the fact of it. That mentality continued throughout the youth of the Democratic party. They fought freeing the slaves with 100% of the Democratic vote to maintain this horrible lifestyle. Today it is a different type of plantation but slavery is still here.In the movie a very disturbing part of it brought me to tears, forced sterilization. When blacks were freed and even held offices in our government the Democrats panicked. They decided that Abortion must be brought about to control the 'black' population. So, a very prominent wife of a KKK leader began a crusade. She stated something that chills me now. If there is a defect in your family, you must kill it. She was referring to black america. So she and other women decided to fight the rise in black America in a different way - offer abortions of unwanted children legally. When they did this and it became legal, they not only gave those abortions but sterilized the women having them. Countless women were sterilized. Some were mentally slow, mentally challenged, and sadly - if you were black.While watching this portion my heart sank to my toes because now I understand why Hillary Clinton is pushing for full term abortions. What race of people has the highest abortion rate? That's right, blacks. My heart burst in this sickening realization - Hillary Clinton believes that blacks are still growing at too high a rate so this is her preverted method of control.I can't allow myself to remain on that topic no more than the movie did, they couldn't deal with the reality of it either - it quickly went to another topic right after showing Hillary clinton preaching about women's rights concerning abortion.To say the very least, this movie has given me more than just food for thought, it has opened my eyes to the horrors of the Democratic Party. They were started with blood on their hands and that has never changed. I will re-register Janurary 1st to begin my new year right. I'm a completely converted Democrat and will never, ever vote another one into office. My heart goes out to my black brothers and sisters of these United States of America, you have had one hell of a hard walk in life in this nation. I just wish that more of you would come to understand that the Democrats are not on your side and never were.

25 | Donna Butler | 1542363559117002_1542467155773309 | WOW, and the Democrats talk about temperament.  Then they have the V.P. Biden wanting to BEAT someone up...What a BULLY! Perhaps Michelle Obama needs to scold him on abuse. ...Such HYPOCRITES !!

1 | Cathe Brice Cabrera | 1327901323972783_1327925823970333 | I don't understand how this bill works, does everyone who lives in NC have to carry around their birth certificate all the time and are there bathroom monitors at every bathroom entrance to check everyone's birth certificate? This is the stupidest law I have heard of!! So glad I live in a civilized state that respects everyone's civil rights, yay CA!!
2 | Donald January Jr. | 1327901323972783_1327930480636534 | I'm an inclusive and level-headed person, but how is it controversial to use the restroom of the gender that you were born?  Why doesn't the government seek to pass a law for mandatory unisex bathrooms for transgender people? Serious question... Why is this such a big deal?
3 | Rodney Moss Sr. | 1327901323972783_1327940440635538 | When indoor plumbing was invented all bathrooms and toilet rooms were coed.....most places didn't have the money to purchase multiple toilets and showers.....If you are going to quote something quote it right
4 | Beatrice Florina Florescu-Boomhower | 1327901323972783_1327923307303918 | The bigger issue here is that they are losing money left and right because of this law with events cancelled... they need to change the law, so... vote. Everyone should vote regardless who you vote for, but vote.
5 | Denise A Spencer | 1327901323972783_1327930773969838 | Poor little republican bigots. Trans people are not child molesters like republicans are and use a bathroom appropriate to their real gender. Dennis Hastert is the face of republican child molesting..... Republicans need to pass a law to stop republicans from going into bathrooms with children..... the real threat.
6 | William J Smith Jr. | 1327901323972783_1327923240637258 | OMG, weak jobs, terrorism, mass killings in the middle east, infrastructure in a mess, corruption in Washington and these people are worried about Freaking Bathroom bill? And people around the world looking at us as if to say,,, ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING?
7 | Jackie Weaver Farmer | 1327901323972783_1327927330636849 | Totally stupid! I'm a female and if you look like a male, you need to visit the male bathroom. Just sayin
8 | Christine Statham | 1327901323972783_1328064603956455 | call me granny........I was in the mens room today a one seater with my grandsons.   It is just a room, just a toilet fixture and just a sink.  Do not piss on the floor!
9 | Ravan Hara Kara | 1327901323972783_1327912820638300 | “I mean, let’s remember here: The people we are fighting today we funded 20 years ago, and we did it because we were locked in this struggle with the Soviet Union, They invaded Afghanistan, and we did not want to see them control central Asia, and we went to work, and it was President Reagan, in partnership with the Congress, led by Democrats, who said, “You know what? Sounds like a pretty good idea! Let’s deal with the ISI and the Pakistani military, and let’s go recruit these Mujahedin! That’s great! Let’s get some to come from Saudi Arabia and other places, importing their Wahhabi brand of Islam, so that we can go beat the Soviet Union!” And guess what? They retreated, they lost billions of dollars, and it led to the collapse of the Soviet Union. So there’s a very strong argument, which is: It wasn’t a bad investment to end the Soviet Union, but let’s be careful what we sow, because we will harvest.” - Hillary Clinton
10 | Peter Sullivan | 1327901323972783_1327914600638122 | So a bald bearded tatted  guy who was cisgender female at birth and has been on T for 20 years will have to use the lady's room?
11 | Rubea Ross | 1327901323972783_1327963127299936 | See how the corrupt media does this...instead of saying that this is not a decision for the government, they get people fighting and dividing into groups to argue. What in the hell did we do for 240 years without the government intruding into every aspect of our lives.
12 | Joan Stewart Kerr | 1327901323972783_1327941173968798 | oh my, all over the world bathrooms are both male and female , you just use it , in hospitals most bathrooms are one , if a man comes out I as a female use it. America needs to grow up , enough of religious nonsence
13 | Trena Jarnagin-Blackburn | 1327901323972783_1327949500634632 | By: Daniel GreenfieldHillary Clinton, of all people, summed up this debate and this election best."What kind of country are we going to be?"The Evita of Arkansas is a compulsive liar who has never told the truth in her life. But this time around she was right. This election does not come down to the personalities. It comes down to the kind of country we are going to have. And in the third debate, the one that took a break from the petty haranguing of media lackeys like Lester Holt and Martha Raddatz, the issues took center stage.The core issue came into focus with the very first question asked by Chris Wallace. Wallace asked Hillary and Trump if their vision for the Supreme Court was based on the Constitution or not. Hillary launched into a spiel about a Supreme Court that would stand for class warfare and gay rights. The only time she mentioned the Constitution was when she insisted that the Senate was constitutionally obligated to confirm Obama's nominee. That is her vision of the Constitution; a document that grants her power to reshape the country without regard to the Founders or any previously existing rights or freedoms.It fell to Trump to speak of justices who would "interpret the Constitution the way the founders wanted it interpreted". And that is the core issue. Personalities and politicians come and go. Today's trending topic has been forgotten a day later. Outrages explode like fireworks and then fizzle out.The weapons of mass distraction have been deployed and detonated. They keep going off in blasts of media gunpowder to divert our attention from whether we will live under the Constitution or under the Hillary. Will we have the rights and freedom bound into the Constitution or corruption justified with cant about the need to defend the oppressed by giving unlimited power to the oppressors.The final debate finally focused on the issues. Instead of leading with the scandals, it asked about gun control, amnesty and open borders. It asked what kind of country are we going to be?And, are we going to be a country at all or an open border weeping undocumented migrants destroying what's left of the middle class as the masterminds rob the country blind while preaching piously to us about all the poor Syrians, Mexicans and LGBT youth they want to protect?Americans have had a preview of the country that Hillary Clinton would create under Obama. They received yet another preview of it at a final debate in which Hillary echoed Obama's Orwellian language in which endless spending was dubbed "investing" and in which government would save the middle class by regulating and taxing it out of existence for the greater good of the officially oppressed.Hillary Clinton promised free college and cradle to grave education that would be debt free. Americans would be the ones plummeting deeper and deeper into debt to pay for degrees in gender studies. She promised viewers pie in the sky to be paid for by higher taxes on the rich. But as Trump pointed out, that's the class that her donors come from. Did Warren Buffett and George Soros invest all that money into her victory just to pay higher taxes? Did they do it right after they bought the Brooklyn Bridge?Or will Americans buy the bridge believing Hillary's promise that she "will not add a penny to the debt"?The only way Hillary can hope to do that is to appoint Bernie Madoff to be her Treasury Secretary.When Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump wrangled over tax hikes or tax cuts, the debate is whether crooks like the Clintons should have a massive pot of taxpayer money to "invest" into their donors.But beneath it is the same big question; do we live under the Constitution or under the Hillary?In Hillary Country, just like in Obama Country, there are always more "investments" to make and you had better pay your "fair share". There are always special identity group interests that need money. There are always more regulations, taxes, fines and fees. And it's all for the children.The ones that Hillary will grimace at when the cameras are on her and nudge away with the point of her shoe when the little red light turns off.But there is no lie that Hillary Clinton will not tell and no lie that her pet media fact checkers will not back her up on. Obama doubled the national debt and yet Hillary insists that, "We're actually on the path to eliminating the national debt". That might be true only insofar as we're approaching the point that no one will lend us any money. We're headed toward a $20 trillion national debt.And Hillary's plans won't add a penny to the national debt. They'll add hundreds of trillions of pennies.Hillary talked of bringing "our country together" and not "pitting of people one against the other" and instead "we celebrate our diversity". If she does half as good a job as Obama, these celebrations of diversity will climax with race riots across America. How exactly does Hillary plan to unite with the "deplorables" of the country? How has Hillary united anyone in the country except in disdain?Hillary Clinton's entire campaign pitch is based on demonizing Trump and his supporters. She believes that if she convinces enough voters that Trump is the devil, they may hold their noses and accept the return of the corrupt Clinton dynasty and everything that it represents. That gamble is what we are seeing on the news. It is what we heard at the debate. Hillary cannot win on her own merits.She warned at the final debate of the "dark, unaccountable money to come into our electoral system". It's hard to imagine a bigger source of dark, accountable money than a foundation being used as an international slush fund that has been beyond unaccountable.But it's Hillary's vision of government that is dark and unaccountable. From the beginning of the debate, she made it clear that she does not wish to be accountable to the Constitution. Her email cover up made it painfully clear that she does not want to be accountable to the American people. Instead Hillary would like everyone in the country to be accountable to her. A mass of regulations and enforcers will force everyone to be accountable to the dark and unaccountable force in the White House."It really does come down to what kind of country we are going to have," Hillary repeated.It does indeed. Americans have had a preview of the kind of country that Hillary would bring into being.
14 | George Ramey | 1327901323972783_1327936473969268 | How about and mobilizing for the help to stop the death of millions of unborn children in our country.  Please read this article and all you Christians and Catholic should ask yourself what have we become. ‘So What if Abortion Ends Life?’: Pro-Choice Writer Says Some Babies Are ‘Worth Sacrificing’Jan. 24, 2013 2:12pm Billy Hallowell                                                    Abortion continues to be a highly-contentious issue, even as this week marks the 40th anniversary since the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court verdict was handed down. It’s a never-ending battle, typically colored by raw emotion. While one polar side traditionally argues that life begins at the moment of conception, the other tends to shy away from any recognition that the unborn qualify as human lives.This pro-life versus pro-choice dynamic often leads to intense clashes in the public sphere, with both sides accusing the other of restricting rights and advocating damaging policies. In a new piece that was published this week, Salon’s Mary Elizabeth Williams, a pro-choice adherent, decides not to steer clear of the “life” issue and asks: “So what if abortion ends life?”The question, itself, is enough to send anti-abortion advocates into a tizzy. Williams, who identifies herself as pro-choice, takes a divergent route from others on the left who have staunch views about abortion rights. Rather than denying the fact that fetuses are human lives, she, like pro-lifers, fully embraces this ideal. However, Williams differentiates between the rights that the unborn have from those that belong to women.“Yet I know that throughout my own pregnancies, I never wavered for a moment in the belief that I was carrying a human life inside of me. I believe that’s what a fetus is: a human life,” Williams wrote. “And that doesn’t make me one iota less solidly pro-choice.”She went on to decry the “semantic power” that is inherent within the modern-day debate, taking particular aim at those who oppose abortion by using the word “life” to win the debate. But rather than cowering to what the writer says are the “sneaky, dirty tricks of the anti-choice lobby,” Williams proposes that pro-choice advocates should not cower when the word “life” is brought into the discussion. Instead, she believes that pro-choicers should double down and explain why women should have more rights than fetuses.“Here’s the complicated reality in which we live: All life is not equal,” she wrote. “That’s a difficult thing for liberals like me to talk about, lest we wind up looking like death-panel-loving, kill-your-grandma-and-your-precious-baby storm troopers.”Salons Mary Elizabeth Williams Asks: So What if Abortion Ends Life?See, Williams believes that a fetus, while it is a human life, does not need to be afforded the same rights as the woman who it resides in. She goes on to say that the woman is the “boss” and that it is her right to decide whether having that baby fits in with her life circumstances and health. In the end, Williams argues that this personal decision — predicated upon a woman’s individual situation — should always take precedent over the fetus that is inside of the female.As for the semantics surrounding abortion, Williams calls for pro-choice advocates to be less squeamish, especially when it comes to avoiding whether or not an unborn baby should be considered a “life.”“When we try to act like a pregnancy doesn’t involve human life, we wind up drawing stupid semantic lines in the sand: first trimester abortion vs. second trimester vs. late term, dancing around the issue trying to decide if there’s a single magic moment when a fetus becomes a person,” she continued. “Are you human only when you’re born? Only when you’re viable outside of the womb? Are you less of a human life when you look like a tadpole than when you can suck on your thumb?”At the end of the piece, Williams notes that she believes that women’s lives can be saved in certain circumstances and that the life of a mother should always be put before a fetus. In these complicated scenarios, she said the unborn life being aborted is, “A life worth sacrificing.”
15 | Iris Osborne Lewars | 1327901323972783_1327944543968461 | The BIG secret is that this bill has a A LOT more in it than who pees where - it has made it legal to discriminate against anyone who is not in the protected class of gender, race and religion.So IF I see your bumper sticker and decide that I don't want to serve anyone who has that sticker - it's LEGAL.
16 | Darryl Scifres | 1327901323972783_1327960743966841 | Didn't a judge just hand down a ruling against Obama on that same issue. Oh the outrage, finally someone with some sense...

23 | Robin Belden | 1327901323972783_1327940307302218 | Please  help GUARD the voting stations !!!The Hillary ship is SINKING . . plank by plank Wikileaks keeps enlarging the hole . . so much corruption exposed about the Disgraced DNC, Crooked Hillary's pathetic team and even the BIAS media. There is not enough Flex Seal to keep the Hillary ship afloat . . better head to shore and find another boatThe tentacles of the Clintons have clearly shown:They will cheat the voting for HillaryThey will pay protestors to get violent for HillaryThey will forward the debate questions to HillaryThey will conspire for HillaryThey will distort for HillaryThey will cover up for HillaryThey will lie for HillaryThey will even take a dive for HillaryThey will bribe for HillaryThey will Threaten for HillaryThey will destroy other people for HillaryThey will KILL for HillaryThe smear campaign about character has back fired, with the complete lack of character from both Clintons. They try to paint Trump as a sexual deviant while Slick Willy flies high on Epstein"s (Bill's best friend) Lolita Express to a private Island of Underage Sex Slaves. Slick Willy can always just assault the women unlucky enough to be near him, not to worry, Hillary will simply SHAME them into silenceOf course the only REAL chance the Clinton machine has is to attempt painting Donald Trump as a Racist etc. So they keep this fire burning of course, anything to distract from the TRUTHS being exposed by Wikileaks and other sources. Kinda funny when Donna Basil and the rest of them try to claim the videos and leaked documents are fake, they quiver and cringe trying so hard to look sincere, how can they sleep at night ?Even Republican Politicians are useless to help Trump with several actively trying to stop the WILL of THE PEOPLE, while they SWELL in corrupt donations. We all know they work with the corruption and will not oppose it, that would be like shooting themselves in the footDonald Trump's Train just keeps rolling along the HIGH rail while the Clinton POOP DUMPING buses take the LOW road. When Hillary says 'When they go low, you go high . . with the paradoxical being . . 'If they go high, you MUST to go low'. Quite obvious which is true . . GO TRUMP !!!

Harold Thomas Martin III was accused by the Department of Justice on two counts – theft of government property and unauthorized removal of classified documents. He faces up to 11 years in jail.this guy is in court right now. Under the espionage act faces federal jail time for just having the documents at home, there does not have to be intent. Also keep in mind this man didn't lie to the FBI unlike Hillary. How is what he done anyway different then what was inalienably proven against Hillary?Also let's not forget about the four star general that mishandled just two emails and is facing federal jail timeReport that no not MSNBC

4 | Nicole Rossbach | 10153804076876916_10153804356641916 | I just read an article on Yahoo news about McCains recent statements that the House or Senate will not approve ANY Supreme Court nominees that Hillary sends for approval.  He said the only way to correct this is to make sure that the house & senate are the same side as the WH, I'm not kidding that's what I read.  We need to make sure that actually happens otherwise there will be no Supreme Court!  Remember the WH may change but if the current congress stays the same we have the same outcome stagnant do nothing inept over paid group of suits.  Send the message this year we will not stand for another 4-8 years of NOTHING in the Congress. Vote Democrat down ballot !

Trump says only the super rich can create jobs excluding the work of small business and government that provides more jobs than big corporations do. Trickle down policy has never worked it just helps the oligarchs export more of our jobs over seas to slave labor..... and now that oligarchs have hidden their slave profits overseas Trump and republicans push a 400 billion tax repatriation scam for the criminal oligarch to bring back their slave profits so they can fund republican campaigns for a few pennies of their criminal wealth..... and send more of our jobs overseas.

The lies and criminal acts of Hillary and her associates is coming to the public compliments of Wikileaks. There is no need for the "mainstream media" anymore. You people attempt to silence the proof of Hillary and her cohorts, you divert any questions in reference to the revelations that has been revealed to the public! When confronted with what has been done at her direction or on her behalf she blames Russia. She does not deny the emails, she blames someone else for informing the world of her criminal activity.
12 | Richard Gougeon | 10153804076876916_10153804221861916 | Here is a survey not coming from the mainstream media supporting Hillary Clinton which reflect the real voter intents .The Rasmussen survey showed Trump at 43 percent support while Clinton was at 40 percent.

Hillary admitted this in the 3rd debate and will appoint Supreme Court justices that agree with her. And of these voters the ones that say they're Christians, how can you sit in Gods house, and say you're Christian, and think killing babies in the ninth month of pregnancy is OK. You should be ashamed of yourself.

2 | Naomi Gargano | 1542276355792389_1542291595790865 | We lived in Chicago for four years ...fell in love...became huge Chicago Cubs fans, Wrigley Field turned out to be our favorite experiences...we were honored every time we were there whenever Bill Murray sang take me out to the ball game!
3 | Denise A Spencer | 1542276355792389_1542277429125615 | Race relations have gotten worse becasue republicans are racists that push hate to cover for a fascist agenda for an oligarch their policy created. Obama reached out, they said he wasn't born here.
4 | Colin Sherman | 1542276355792389_1542315662455125 | Seven hundred and seventy million dollars. That’s right, Barack Obama, John Kerry, and Hillary Clinton conspired together to send nearly $1 billion to the Middle East to renovate mosques.
5 | Patrice Randall | 1542276355792389_1542520499101308 | Geez people, this post is about Bill Murray and the Cubs. Nothing political. Go somewhere else and post your rants and let the rest of us enjoy the post.

Hillary is for full term abortions and tax dollars to go to PPH Trump is pro life, Hillary is for open trade and TPP Donald is for us to renegotiate our trade deals. Hillary is anti gun, Trump is pro gun and second amendment. Hillary is for 500+ per cent more refugees coming to America, Donald is for halting this and helping the refugees in their own land with assistance of neighboring countries, Hillary is for pay to play. Donald is for we the people, Hillary is for Obamacare, Donald if for appealing Obamacare and opening insurance up where they are not tied to certain states and health savings plans, Hillary if for increased taxes, Donald is for decreased taxes, Hillary is for increase in death tax to 65% Donald if for doing away with the death tax, Hillary is for government control of our educations system Donald if for turning it back to each state. Hillary is opposing allowing minorities to go to charter schools, Donald if for them to go to charter schools, Hillary supports BLM, Donald supports our police departments and is for law and order, Choose your president wisely as the supreme court needs to have conservatives on it to keep our second amendment, first amendment and on and on and on.

High profile surrogates like Michelle Obama have made recent appearances in the Grand Canyon State as the Hillary Clinton campaign looks to capture Arizona in November.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Sean Sederstrom | 1327808020648780_1327810753981840 | As an Arizona voter, I can proudly say "I'm with her".
2 | Yolanda Bassett | 1327808020648780_1327816497314599 | I swear if she wins a state that is traditionally republican I don't know if I will be able to contain myself. I just might have to go outside and scream or honk my horn or something. AZ, IN, MO, GA?
3 | Muhammad Umar Chaudhry | 1327808020648780_1327808500648732 | Ladies and Gentlemen Please.....Don't even mention the word Melania & First Lady in one sentence. They're worlds apart. Have we really all gone mad ? Is this a nation of Morons now? Donald , Melania and all the Trump's rotten brats in this Nation White House ? Melanoma is an ex-hooker, can barely speak English and came to this country illegally. She would be the most embarrassing First Lady ever! Come on..
4 | Aaron Stark | 1327808020648780_1327840203978895 | I'm with her! Trump is a racist mysoginist bigot, and will be beaten badly. There will be a landslide. Then you deplorables can crawl back into your breitbart cave while the rest of us mock, ridicule, and ostracize you idiots. Have fun being marginalized.
5 | Jason Counter | 1327808020648780_1327840443978871 | I'm honestly really looking forward to seeing the election results on November 8th. It's definitely going to be interesting. We need to remember that this isn't a normal election between a democrat and a republican. Donald Trump isn't a normal candidate (not in a good way either). Arizona isn't the only traditional red state that has turned into a battleground. Georgia, South Carolina, Missouri, Utah, Mississippi, and even Texas have been shown to be at play at least once during this election cycle. It will definitely be interesting to see if Hillary Clinton could actually win a red state (especially based on the current polling data). Even if she wins by only a small margin in at least one of these states, it would still be a huge deal to see a red state turn blue.
6 | Alice Blair | 1327808020648780_1327848447311404 | 1. Trump wants an isolationist United States.2. Trump doesn’t speak out against Assad in Syria, who Putin is helping.3. Trump wants to walk away from NATO, leaving Europe to Putin as far as influence goes.4. Trump owes millions to Russia in loans. Russia is heavily invested in Trump Enterprises.5. Paul Manafort, Trumps campaign manager worked as consultant to ex Ukranian President Viktor Yanukovych.6. Yanukovych was granted asylum from Putin after being driven from power in Ukraine.7. Manafort was hired to clean up Yanukovych’s image in Russia, just like he’s attempting to do with Trump.8. Trump’s tax returns would likely show his connections to and dependence on Russia and Putin.9. Trump refuses to produce his tax returns because “It will hurt my campaign”.10. And he illegally broke the Cuban embargo.11. His foundation was shut down for lack of certification and lack of audits. 12. There are charges pending on his Trump university scam. 13. There are  pending a trial in NY for charges of raping a 13 year old.
7 | Matthew Quirk | 1327808020648780_1327826073980308 | It's amazing how many red states are up for grabs. The big race is over, obviously, but now even the House is in play. That's how bad it is for the GOP this time. I think they are fighting for the existence of the party at this point.
8 | Mary McCarson | 1327808020648780_1327833247312924 | It's sad that nearly everything we suspected about the broken Democratic Party has turned out to be true. After the Wikileaks release and the release of the Project Veritas recordings we can now confirm that:- The Democrats have embraced violence as a campaign tactic and they have no problem with people being seriously hurt as long as their political goals are met. Free speech means nothing to the Democrats and they will use violence to suppress speech they disagree with. - The Democrats have embraced voter fraud by "bussing people in" and have done so for decades. The integrity of elections are a big joke to the Democrats.- The Democrats will sell access to power for donations to either their campaigns, or their foundations. Power to the people is a big joke to them, power to those willing to pay them off is what really matters to them. You disagree with this? Please, go ahead and read the Wikileaks emails and watch the recordings yourself. The evidence is damning if your mind is open. Copied & Reposted:
9 | Joan Bristol | 1327808020648780_1327839520645630 | Absolutely she will and if anyone still contemplating of who's the most qualify, let me reassure you, it's Hillary Clinton. Don't stay at home, go out and vote for her
10 | Ned Spain | 1327808020648780_1327965910632991 | Arizona wants safety from drug cartels and gangs. Hillary will help the state become part of Mexico. Yay America there's your defender.
11 | Steven Erickson | 1327808020648780_1327815537314695 | She's gonna lose in a huge way...people are fed up with corrupt politicians,who do nothing but line their pockets with our tax dollars
12 | Michael Kelley | 1327808020648780_1327841500645432 | OPEN BORDER HILLARY 2016! What America needs is millions of people flowing in from south of our border that would rather be homeless here then being in the corrupt nation they came from. Don't worry that will not further hold down wages. Just one more bump on the road to that great utopia that left dreams of. We need to believe Hillary when she tells us the "People" and not what she says in private $250k speeches.
13 | Mark Welker | 1327808020648780_1327871647309084 | Hillary is keeping low and out of the way of questions from the press.... letting the Obama's, Democrat surrogates, the liberal press, and dark operative dirty tricks do the work. She figures the polls have her winning and hopes to coast over the finish line. Her handlers rightly calculate that "less Hillary is more."
14 | Margaret London | 1327808020648780_1328116220617960 | If it is said that Trump never molested any of the ladies who accused him of sexually assaulting them, could Donald be so kind as to list some of the names of the ladies he grabbed by their body parts?
15 | Julane Quick | 1327808020648780_1327863213976594 | If the smart decent people of AZ gets out the vote you will have help make history. We will celebrate with Madam President  at the 100th anniversary of womens right to vote in 3 years.
16 | Ryan Moon | 1327808020648780_1327817927314456 | Democrats Hillary has won this thing hands down. It would be a waste of your time even to bother to vote stay home hang out on Election Day you have won already
17 | Maggie Creamer | 1327808020648780_1327810177315231 | Trump is worse than our Enemy's... a vote for Trump is a vote for them. ;-)
18 | Keith Johnson | 1327808020648780_1327914333971482 | Someone said “ Do you ever notice that democrats never chant USA at a Hillary rally, do not wear USA flag pins, or do not display our flag, isn't that weird?”The answer is because they are NOT proud to be Americans. That is why they do not want borders; that way the US will just disappear.
19 | MD Watts | 1327808020648780_1327843300645252 | All over the hatred for President Obama..the Rep. Party has eaten their own!!..Everything has backfired...POTUS never lost his cool..slow n steady wins the race!!
20 | Marco Matteucci | 1327808020648780_1327826280646954 | Clinton&C.: -100% life on Earth Americans say NO to the Clinton's thermonuclear-puppetmasters, otherwise the Entire World will know the nuclear extinction
21 | Carol Rinker Petersen | 1327808020648780_1327857560643826 | The Left likes to say "it's because he's black, isn't it."  NO - it's because of crap like THIS! http://thefederalistpapers.org/us/breaking-epa-going-rogue-again-this-is-nuts"The EPA, in its insatiable appetite for control via new regulatory powers, has come up with another term for furrows: “mini mountain ranges.' You read correctly. This entirely absurd distinction is extremely important because, like wetlands, guess who has control over the nation’s mountain ranges? The feds. This ridiculous name –mini mountain ranges– could be enough for the federal government to seize control over private land use decisions by U.S. farmers."--http://thefederalistpapers.org/us/breaking-epa-going-rogue-again-this-is-nutsIf Hilary wins, it'll be "it's because she's a woman, isn't it".
22 | Paul Michel | 1327808020648780_1327895330640049 | Arizona will fall and another surprising state.  Perhaps Georgia or perhaps Arkansas.  Probably Georgia, but I'm certain Hillary's still popular in Arkansas.
23 | Robert Chiste | 1327808020648780_1327857070643875 | Not buying it when MCcain is up by 11 points on the next democrat..im in AZ and haven't met one single person voting for her yet.
24 | Kris Zig | 1327808020648780_1327935337302715 | LIES LIES LIES. They are RIGGING the polls. The Media and the Lying Hillary supporters want the American People to think that Hillary is ahead. SO we think she's going to win so why bother. NO NO NO don't think that come out and VOTE FOR TRUMP LESS BEAT THE RIG.
25 | Lynda Magary | 1327808020648780_1327882057308043 | I don't know Michelle has cost the America people a bundle of money and has she really done anything much for America.

Great America PAC published the credit card numbers and card expiration dates of nearly 50 donors.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Susan Hitchcock | 1327770377319211_1327784540651128 | Pro Trump Super PAC? Thought he wasn't going to take donations so he wouldn't be beholden. Oh yeah but that was when he wanted us to believe he was tremendously wealthy!
2 | Christopher H Eagan | 1327770377319211_1327779323984983 | Not such a big deal in and of itself, but this campaign and pretty much everyone involved is doing a terrible job. It's a disaster. If they can't campaign, why would you trust them to govern?
3 | Bill Allemon | 1327770377319211_1327778897318359 | Oh, that'll be handy. We can now cross-reference the accounts with racist comments on Facebook. 💳💩
4 | Michael Rios | 1327770377319211_1327802713982644 | Haha. I'm sure he'll be blaming Hillary for it soon. Hillary and Obama published them to make him look bad. They teamed up with J'ina to post the numbers.
5 | Raymond Brown | 1327770377319211_1327840680645514 | These rubes will finally understand when Trump has them broke, destitute, and raked over the coals by the Russians. What is it going to take for them to see they are being conned??? Man, they should board the Trump cruise liner to Guyana, and drink the kool-aid Trump Jim Jones gives them. Stunningly idiotic.
6 | Chris Pritchett | 1327770377319211_1327805867315662 | So not going to ever talk about the staffer who was apart of Wikileaks that ousted the dnc screwing Bernie over. Remember, Seth rich, one who was shot in the back, corruption is apart of the media with clintons. Scary
7 | Kimberly Rockwell | 1327770377319211_1327773503985565 | That's just super duper interesting and all, but maybe you might want to mention that HALF THE INTERNET HAS BEEN TAKEN DOWN BY HACKERS. Isn't that just a tiny bit newswothy?
8 | Denise A Spencer | 1327770377319211_1327773097318939 | Poverty is a reflection of the political economy.Poverty is a reflection of institutions and society.Poverty is a reflection of the racial divisions and institutional stereotypes of society.Conservative republican policy creates poverty, insecurity among the working class, and perpetuates racists stereotypes.Democrats try to understand the problems to move those in poverty out. Like social security, medicare, medicaid, Food Assistance, and education.
9 | Vince Kauffman | 1327770377319211_1327845677311681 | 40- some donors and they raised 14 million? There's a couple of whales in the water. Wouldn't it be something if they all gave a few hundred thousand to Planned Parenthood and Voto Latino? Just sayin'.
10 | Steven Skees | 1327770377319211_1327797053983210 | Given the educational attainment of his supporters, I can't imagine they have great credit anyway... I mean what are the limits on their cards, maybe $500?
11 | Dan Covell | 1327770377319211_1327801183982797 | These organizations are run my Trump supporters.  I guess he should have tried a little harder to appeal to the college educated.
12 | John Zerdy | 1327770377319211_1327800110649571 | Trump is one tough hombre. He is out there campaigning. He is up against Hill the Pill, Billy, Biden, Caine, Gore,Obama, Mischelle, and the media. You go Donald!
13 | Matthew Kaye | 1327770377319211_1327802443982671 | Hillary has helped us to tenderly hold the Muslim Brotherhood next to our hearts , and to look to Political Islam for guidance and wisdom . Love Islam , and vote for Hillary Clinton . America needs the Muslim Brotherhood more now then ever . America will be Wahhabi by the time Hillary Clinton leaves the White House . Prepare .
14 | Vince Kauffman | 1327770377319211_1327846953978220 | The Trumpettes have deflected in 20 different directions so that the utter carelessness of his Super PAC is ignored. Release credit card numbers to the public-BWAHAHAHA.
15 | Dennis Ray Brooks | 1327770377319211_1327771883985727 | Charles Gardner.. trump is a child molesting pedophile who sexually assaulted women, who should be in prison getting to know bubba!
16 | Jason Davidovics | 1327770377319211_1327811450648437 | Notice the short clips of ddos attacks this morning and nothing on either this facebook page or cnn's? Could it be because their encouragement of espionage emboldened this?
17 | Anne Brontë | 1327770377319211_1327788650650717 | When Hillary #Clinton says open borders, does that mean I can go to Mexico and apply for social services and vote in their elections? I highly doubt that is the case. Its ok for illegals and refugees to break our laws? A one way street to HADES for all Americans.
18 | Mike A Dickerson | 1327770377319211_1327831327313116 | Its funny how folks believe anything said about trump but refuse to see or hear actual facts about clintons dirty deeds. I dont suppot either candidate but I definitely understand the term "sheeple" the "gaslighting" is real. I feel sorry for our country. Pray for our troops.
19 | Desiree Seal | 1327770377319211_1327963703966545 | My final thoughts on Hillary's America and I will try not to use caps.First, I've always prided myself on the illusion that I'm quite familiar with our history, shamefully I was quite wrong. I've always been one to fight for the underdog, probably because I am one. This movie shocked me in terms of how little I knew about my own selection of a government party - Democrats. For, you see, I'm a registered Democrat.I always prided myself on the illusion that they are all about helping and I couldn't be further from the truth. In reality, the Democrats are a spawn of evil that was birthed by, none other than, our government.It started with Jackson and stretched its ugly arms from there. Jackson fought to maintain slaverly and was an obscene man who beat and raped his slaves without hiding the fact of it. That mentality continued throughout the youth of the Democratic party. They fought freeing the slaves with 100% of the Democratic vote to maintain this horrible lifestyle. Today it is a different type of plantation but slavery is still here.In the movie a very disturbing part of it brought me to tears, forced sterilization. When blacks were freed and even held offices in our government the Democrats panicked. They decided that Abortion must be brought about to control the 'black' population. So, a very prominent wife of a KKK leader began a crusade. She stated something that chills me now. If there is a defect in your family, you must kill it. She was referring to black america. So she and other women decided to fight the rise in black America in a different way - offer abortions of unwanted children legally. When they did this and it became legal, they not only gave those abortions but sterilized the women having them. Countless women were sterilized. Some were mentally slow, mentally challenged, and sadly - if you were black.While watching this portion my heart sank to my toes because now I understand why Hillary Clinton is pushing for full term abortions. What race of people has the highest abortion rate? That's right, blacks. My heart burst in this sickening realization - Hillary Clinton believes that blacks are still growing at too high a rate so this is her preverted method of control.I can't allow myself to remain on that topic no more than the movie did, they couldn't deal with the reality of it either - it quickly went to another topic right after showing Hillary clinton preaching about women's rights concerning abortion.To say the very least, this movie has given me more than just food for thought, it has opened my eyes to the horrors of the Democratic Party. They were started with blood on their hands and that has never changed. I will re-register Janurary 1st to begin my new year right. I'm a completely converted Democrat and will never, ever vote another one into office. My heart goes out to my black brothers and sisters of these United States of America, you have had one hell of a hard walk in life in this nation. I just wish that more of you would come to understand that the Democrats are not on your side and never were.

The lies and criminal acts of Hillary and her associates is coming to the public compliments of Wikileaks. There is no need for the "mainstream media" anymore. You people attempt to silence the proof of Hillary and her cohorts, you divert any questions in reference to the revelations that has been revealed to the public! When confronted with what has been done at her direction or on her behalf she blames Russia. She does not deny the emails, she blames someone else for informing the world of her criminal activity.

So far, early votes in Ohio are outpacing where they were at this time in 2012.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Pat Kennedy | 1327736897322559_1327748093988106 | PLEASE Ohio. Trump just cannot be president. Our first lady cannot be a pin-up girl. You may not like career politicians, but this man is not the one to save us.
2 | Donna Brockway | 1327736897322559_1327747127321536 | We WOMEN are coming out and voting for Hillary and send that predator back to his sewer Trump Tower!!!!
3 | Aces Brand | 1327736897322559_1327740947322154 | Donald Trump's voter fraud claim is just another one of his scams to try to stop people from going out and voting for Hilary. This guy conned his way through the Republican party to get in the race in the first place. Don't fall for his crap go out and vote
4 | Georgette Carriere | 1327736897322559_1327762790653303 | People in Ohio go vote for Hillary vote The Blue Routeget rid of the obstructioists republicans and keep your great country greater, vote for the only sane and qualified candidate, she will work for everyone vote 50 States of Blue vote True Blue Progressives
5 | JC Torres | 1327736897322559_1327742120655370 | Trump can have Ohio, and even Florida, and he still would lose the elections. If he has to worry about Arizona turning blue, that's aweful for this clown!!! Oh but he is not a "typical politician." Pathetic!!!
6 | Jamie Borkowski | 1327736897322559_1327748307321418 | Trump should take ohio! Blue collar workers! War on coal! All in his favor. His basket of deplorables live there and the rednecks, catholics, evangelicals, needy latinos, and of course bernies basement dwellers!  Trump 2016!
7 | Jason Counter | 1327736897322559_1327761000653482 | Even if Ohio does vote for Trump, it doesn't mean anything. That state isn't playing a very important role in this election like it has in previous times. He could win Ohio and Florida, but still lose the election. Especially since Hillary Clinton has pretty much locked Virginia and Pennsylvania in her favor.Winning Ohio should be the last thing on Donald Trump's mind anyway. He can't even win red states like Arizona, Georgia, Utah, or Texas without being practically tied with Hillary Clinton. That says a lot about how awful he is as a candidate when even the reddest state in our nation (Texas) is a battleground.
8 | Sharon Tigner | 1327736897322559_1327886737307575 | come on Ohio we got this! lets pull the votes in for Hillary! and show the rest of the country we won't stand for a lying cheating racist bigot draft dodging makes fun of disable people one who steals from our vets tax evader child molester trump is all of the above and more! the right one for the white house is Hillary so go Ohio vote blue all the way
9 | Artis Williams | 1327736897322559_1328032417293007 | Hillary does'nt need Ohio, although, it would be great to have it. However... I just don't believe the polls in Ohio. I honestly think she's leading big there. I've been saying, since the conventions, she is going to win in a blowout. We have to vote... but we also need to remember to vote Democrat up and down the ticket... Our trump supporters will thank us later... Kind of like giving a kid medicine, they hate you when you give it to them when their sick, but love you later when they are feeling better. We're electing Hillary for the love of country...
10 | Michael Kelley | 1327736897322559_1327842947311954 | OPEN BORDER HILLARY 2016! What America needs is millions of people flowing in from south of our border that would rather be homeless here then being in the corrupt nation they came from. Don't worry that will not further hold down wages. Just one more bump on the road to that great utopia that left dreams of. We need to believe Hillary when she tells us the "People" and not what she says in private $250k speeches. Don't any of you worry. Mass immigration will turn this nation, even Ohio, into a give me nation and you all will get that utopia you dream of.
11 | Sharon J Sherwood | 1327736897322559_1327765213986394 | Do you not listen to any news about Hillary's world every thing he has said is true watch hidden camera interviews, included is media bias. Voting Trump, for America, Your comments on here about the Republican Party just proves you don't watch the news, the party didn't support him the American People who live there freedoms elected him Do your research, he use to be a Democrat
12 | Michael Kling | 1327736897322559_1327801137316135 | We all know the vast majority of early voters are older retirees who overwhelmingly vote conservative. Those results seem very encouraging to the Clinton camp. The liberal large cities won't show results until election night.
13 | Robert Davis | 1327736897322559_1327771013985814 | North Carolina voters roll shows that the Tar Heel State has 2,214 voters that are 110-years-old. Most of these voters are democrats and most seem to live in four democrat-controlled counties. Some of these aged voters have already voted absentee.
14 | Colin Sherman | 1327736897322559_1327877497308499 | Seven hundred and seventy million dollars. That’s right, Barack Obama, John Kerry, and Hillary Clinton conspired together to send nearly $1 billion to the Middle East to renovate mosques.
15 | Darryl Damo | 1327736897322559_1327773403985575 | Voter fraud. Trump supporter gonna vote twice becus they no he's losing. That's why he's pushing rigged so people look towards Hilary while his supporters sneak behind you 👎🏻👎🏻😝😜
16 | Rose Marie | 1327736897322559_1327829390646643 | Ohio needs to get BLUE!!!!!   Let's turn all states BLUE!!!! Can you imagine all of the great things HRC could accomplish for this great Country?? The sky is the limit!! Can we please have eight years of policies and laws that help the American people without a GOP to shoot them down??
17 | Pamela Antilla | 1327736897322559_1327807763982139 | We need to get rid of corrup Hillary Clinton....and boycott the corrupt media who cant tell the truth about anything and then they want us to believe their poll results they post?
18 | Grit Sadler | 1327736897322559_1328004947295754 | I grew up in a small town in Ohio.  I knew from the time I was in 7th grade that this was not where I was going to spend my adulthood.  Nice people, really, just...Trump supporters, even then.

21 | Raymond Bass | 1327736897322559_1327863077309941 | 1. I cannot believe that Trump has gotten as much as 10% of the vote anywhere, in any poll. 2. Ignorance, stupidity, bigotry, racism, sexism, and/or gullibility are the only causes that I can fathom that explain this. 3. I used the word "causes" rather than "reasons" because I honestly do not believe that any man or woman who uses reason could possibly cast a vote for Donald Trump.I am not trying to insult anyone. I am just so disappointed at those who are too blind to see the danger that Trump represents for our democracy; those who are unwilling to admit that he represents the worst in America; that at heart he is someone who builds walls around problems (not just the one he plans for Mexico) rather than facing them. 4. Donald Trump is a Coward. I can only ask his supporters if they are as well.
22 | Johnny Layne | 1327736897322559_1327740700655512 | Of course this is the stuff that the media does not want to talk about regarding Trump.Subject: Re: A FEW THINGS WE NEED TO KNOW. ABOUT..DONALD TRUMP A FEW THINGS WE NEED TO KNOW. ABOUT..DONALD TRUMP>>                 Trump Does The Unthinkable -Liz Crokin ....>                                 Entertainment columnist for the "Red Eye Edition of the Chicago Tribune" and as a freelancer for "Us Weekly".>>                       In 1986, Trump prevented the foreclosure of Annabell Hill's family farm after her husband committed suicide. Trump personally phoned down to the auction to stop the sale of her home and offered the widow money. Trump decided to take action after he saw Hill's pleas for help in news reports.>>>>                       In 1988, a commercial airline refused to fly Andrew Ten, a sick child with a rare illness, across the country to get medical care because he had to travel with an elaborate life-support system. His grief stricken parents contacted Trump for help and he didn't hesitate to send HIS own plane to take the child from Los Angeles to New York so he could get his treatment.>>>                       In 1991, 200 Marines who served in Operation Desert Storm spent time at Camp Lejeunein,  North Carolina before they were scheduled to return home to their families. However, the Marines were told that a mistake had been made and an aircraft would not be able to take them home on their scheduled departure date. When Trump got wind of this, he sent HIS plane to make two trips from North Carolina to Miami to safely return the Gulf War Marines to their loved  ones.>>>                       In 1995, a motorist stopped to help Trump after the limo he was traveling in got a flat tire. Trump asked the Good Samaritan how he could repay him for his help. All the man asked for was a bouquet of flowers for his wife. A few weeks later Trump sent the flowers with a note that read: "We've paid off your mortgage.">>>                       In 2000, Maury Povich featured a little girl named Megan who struggled with Brittle Bone Disease on his show and Trump happened to be watching. Trump said the little girl's story and positive attitude touched his heart. So he contacted Maury and gifted the little girl and her family with a very generous check..>>>                       In 2008,after Jennifer Hudson's family members were tragically murdered in Chicago, Trump put the Oscar-winning actress and her family up at his Windy City hotel for free. In addition to that, Trump's security took extra measures to ensure Hudson and her family members were safe during such a difficult time.>>>                       In 2013, New York bus driver Darnell Barton spotted a woman close to the edge of a bridge staring at traffic below as he drove by. He stopped the bus, got out and put his arm around the woman and saved her life by convincing her to not jump. When Trump heard about this story, he sent the hero bus driver a check simply because he believed his good deed deserved to be rewarded.>>>                       In 2014,Trump gave $25,000 to Sgt. Andrew Tahmooressi after he spent seven months in a Mexican jail for accidentally crossing the US-Mexico border. President Barack Obama couldn't even be bothered to make one phone call to assist with the United States Marine's release; however, Trump opened his pocketbook to help this serviceman get back on his feet.>>>                       In 2016, Melissa Consin Young attended a Trump rally and tear fully thanked Trump for changing her life. She said she proudly stood on stage with Trump as Miss Wisconsin USA in 2005. However, years later she found herself struggling with an incurable illness and during her darkest days she explained that she received a handwritten letter from Trump telling her she's the "bravest woman, I know." She said the opportunities that she got from Trump and his organizations ultimately provided her Mexican-American son with a full-ride to college.>>>                       Lynne Patton, a black female executive for the Trump Organization, released a statement in 2016 defending her boss against accusations that he's a racist and a bigot. She tearfully revealed how she's struggled with substance abuse and addiction for years. Instead of kicking her to the curb, she said the Trump Organization and his entire family loyally stood by her through "immensely difficult times.">>>                       Trump's kindness knows no bounds and his generosity has and continues to touch the lives of people from every sex, race and religion. When Trump sees someone in need, he wants to help.>>>                       Two decades ago, Oprah asked Trump in a TV interview if he'd run for president. He said: "If it got so bad, I would never want to rule it out totally, because I really am tired of seeing what's happening with this country." That day has come. Trump sees that America is in need and he wants to help- how unthinkable!>                                 Donald Trump is a racist, bigot, sexist, xenophobe and Islamophobe --did I miss anything? The left and the media launch these hideous kinds of attacks at Trump everyday; yet, nothing could be further from the truth about the real estate mogul. As an entertainment journalist, I've had the opportunity to cover Trump for over a decade, and in all my years covering him I've never heard anything negative about the man until he announced he was running for president. Keep in mind, I got paid a lot of money to dig up dirt on celebrities like Trump for a living so a scandalous story on the famous billionaire could've potentially sold a lot of magazines and would've been a "huge" feather in my cap. Instead, I found that he doesn't drink alcohol or do drugs, he's a hard working businessman and totally devoted to his beloved wife and children. On top of that, he's one of the most generous celebrities in the world with a heart filled with more gold than his $100 million New York penthouse.>>                       "EVIL SUCCEEDS WHEN GOOD PEOPLE STAND BY AND DO NOTHING!">>                       "Silence makes cowards out of the best of men."--Abraham Lincoln.>>                       SILENCE IS CONSENT...... So share this with those you know.>

There is not enough Flex Seal to keep the Hillary ship afloat . . better head to shore and find another boatThe tentacles of the Clintons have clearly shown:They will cheat the voting for HillaryThey will pay protestors to get violent for HillaryThey will forward the debate questions to HillaryThey will conspire for HillaryThey will distort for HillaryThey will cover up for HillaryThey will lie for HillaryThey will even take a dive for HillaryThey will bribe for HillaryThey will Threaten for HillaryThey will destroy other people for HillaryThey will KILL for HillaryThe smear campaign about character has back fired, with the complete lack of character from both Clintons. They try to paint Trump as a sexual deviant while Slick Willy flies high on Epstein"s (Bill's best friend) Lolita Express to a private Island of Underage Sex Slaves. Slick Willy can always just assault the women unlucky enough to be near him, not to worry, Hillary will simply SHAME them into silenceOf course the only REAL chance the Clinton machine has is to attempt painting Donald Trump as a Racist etc. So they keep this fire burning of course, anything to distract from the TRUTHS being exposed by Wikileaks and other sources. Kinda funny when Donna Basil and the rest of them try to claim the videos and leaked documents are fake, they quiver and cringe trying so hard to look sincere, how can they sleep at night ?Even Republican Politicians are useless to help Trump with several actively trying to stop the WILL of THE PEOPLE, while they SWELL in corrupt donations. We all know they work with the corruption and will not oppose it, that would be like shooting themselves in the footDonald Trump's Train just keeps rolling along the HIGH rail while the Clinton POOP DUMPING buses take the LOW road. When Hillary says 'When they go low, you go high . . with the paradoxical being . . 'If they go high, you MUST to go low'. Quite obvious which is true . . GO TRUMP !!!

1 | Bob Boren | 1327692927326956_1327696603993255 | Michelle doesn't seem to mind letting creepy sexist rap singers and trashy nearly naked singers like Beyonce into the White House. Why the phony outrage, Michelle?
2 | Andrea Daines | 1327692927326956_1327694040660178 | Trump is TRULY a representative leader of the people who support him. Disgusting, isn't it? And if you think this doesn't affect you, take a look around at how some of these sloths and miscreants behave in your workplace, at your grocery store, and in your churches. Especially if you're a woman.
3 | Lee Czerny | 1327692927326956_1327700083992907 | The latest Rasmussen Reports national telephone and online survey of Likely U.S. Voters finds Trump with a 43% to 41% lead over his Democratic rival. Five percent (5%) favor Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson,
4 | Cheryl Woods | 1327692927326956_1327723633990552 | Michelle, I am a 66 year old woman and I have absolutely NO RESPECT for women like you and Hillary! That includes most liberal progressive women!
5 | Lorraine Savic | 1327692927326956_1327706900658892 | Gee Bob, they are not running for president. They are entertainers, he thinks he should be the most powerful man in the world. If you don't understand the difference, you must be a trump guy.
6 | Sandy Licano | 1327692927326956_1327722257324023 | Michelle and her husband need to move on we don't hear much from you for 8 yrs as you all are always on vacation now you want to come out and trash talk Trump just hurry up and be gone.
7 | Kevin Brase | 1327692927326956_1327722567323992 | Trump only wants women that he can control....Michelle O is WAY too intelligent and has WAY too much class for Drump. He hates it because he'll never be able to handle Hillary....or Elizabeth....or Michelle....or Miss Universe for that matter.
8 | Roger O'Neal | 1327692927326956_1327791407317108 | I'm a registered Republican. PoliticalParties are not the marking of a persons heart. The Obamas are of the highest quality of Americans. Their example of high morals and family love serves as an example for all of us. This year I am proud to vote Hillary to continue their positive example of true patriotism. Thank You All for giving me a real choice for President .
9 | Rose Marie | 1327692927326956_1327705397325709 | Let's turn all states BLUE!!!! Can you imagine all of the great things HRC could accomplish for this great Country?? The sky is the limit!! Can we please have eight years of policies and laws that help the American people without a GOP to shoot them down??
10 | Rusty Webb | 1327692927326956_1327711237325125 | The Obamas hate the Clinton's... but the ones to pay the future speaking fees are telling them you will bring more selling influence if we have the Clinton's in.the WH... Michelle Obama hates Hillary Clinton... everyone knows that.
11 | Nolan Schuler | 1327692927326956_1327716727324576 | I find it disrespectful when a leader or leaders wife has to call names at some, part or all of the people they serve. The Obama's have lost significant respect for them selves, the office of the President and the United States by calling them names, apologized for the past and requesting we give up the traditions and faith that is the core of this country. While up holding those that do not want to be part of the country. So it is disgraceful and unbecoming.
12 | Patricia Hensley | 1327692927326956_1327706263992289 | I would be more worried about the fact that while you trash Trump Obama signed another executive order to send troops anywhere in the world for however long he wants them to be there so if you democrats who have husbands wives and children fighting over in another countries you can probably forget about everything seeing them again unless in a bodybag coming home
13 | William Mullin | 1327692927326956_1327713500658232 | The women who accused trump. Put women at a altime low. They lied to discrete trump and to cause women not to vote Trump. Trump again rised above such smear campaign. Sorry hillary foundation. Hillary will setwomen back a hundred years if she is elected. Who do you think her biggest donners are middle eastern countrys, where women have no rights. She is in favior of Shiera law. Muslims are gainning power througj Obama now, and Hillary will give the same power to islomics and make america a islomic state. America as we know it will be gone. Our freedom to gun under the 2nd amendment will be gone.
14 | Gary Anderson Martin | 1327692927326956_1327724650657117 | Hillary campaign chair John Podesta probably isn’t sleeping well.WikiLeaks has done a number on him these past couple of weeks.We’re just now finding out that Podesta’s daughter received his “75,000 common shares” in a Vladimir Putin-linked energy company
15 | Machieavelli Habsburgs | 1327692927326956_1327791843983731 | Insulted by The White House being built by slaves but has no problem with continuing to live in it. Campaigns to improve (worsen) school lunches then pigs out on ribs in Florida. GTFOH
16 | Nora Strunk | 1327692927326956_1327823580647224 | We have a terrible speaking person running for president. We also have a person who thinks it's her right to be president. He's not a politician, she'd be in jail if the current administration wasn't pulling strings. They are both seriously flawed, deal with it
17 | Colin Sherman | 1327692927326956_1327877600641822 | Seven hundred and seventy million dollars. That’s right, Barack Obama, John Kerry, and Hillary Clinton conspired together to send nearly $1 billion to the Middle East to renovate mosques.
18 | Jennifer Yager Carbaugh | 1327692927326956_1328115340618048 | Your husband is supposed to be running OUR country and he owes us tax payers $$$$ for negating his job and campaigning for a candidate, campaigning while president for any party is wrong. But campaigning as OUR president for someone who isn't for us all, bashed anyone against her and called over half of the USA deplorable, xenophobic, homophobic etc is even more disgusting and #NASTY. She by law shouldn't be even able to run💯 and according to you and you're husband... "She will say anything and do nothing."   "If she can't run her own house(because she was referencing Bills affairs) how can she run the White House?"
19 | Jodie Gordon | 1327692927326956_1327932657302983 | They should be televising what Pence said about Michelle. He called her vulgar because she would discuss bathroom talk. That is how he phrase it. Bathroom talk. He wants women to go back to the 1800's. How dare he call her vulgar, the woman/Gay hating creep.
20 | Joe Mac | 1327692927326956_1327703733992542 | If she is so worried about women why is she backing Killery? She accepts money from Saudi and Arab countries and everyone knows how they treat Women Children Gays. Hypocrite!
21 | George Marshall | 1327692927326956_1327727130656869 | He demeans and humiliate everyone not just women. Ask Cruz, Bush and Rubio. Then again Hillary is a criminal. They both suck, but to pretend he just attacks women is gender baiting. Just vote your values because both candidates are disgusting and to claim moral high ground on either aide is stupid. Its about abortion, immigration, trade and issues like that.
22 | Gary Anderson Martin | 1327692927326956_1328080073954908 | It was their plan all along...They are willing to jeopardize the lives of us citizens for their own political power.ISIS has already infiltrated the refugee population... They are now in all 50 states...That's Obama's Legacy!
23 | Jim Collier | 1327692927326956_1327916483971267 | Trump says that the Obamas do nothing but campaign. Well, they are about finished in the white house. Why shouldn't they use their skills to urge democrats to vote ?  Trump wishes that he had someone to talk for him but many republicans aren't interested.
24 | Mark Welker | 1327692927326956_1327872267309022 | Hillary is keeping low and out of the way of questions from the press.... letting the Obama's, Democrat surrogates, the liberal press, and dark operative dirty tricks do the work. She figures the polls have her winning and hopes to coast over the finish line. Her handlers rightly calculate that "less Hillary is more."

Trump personally phoned down to the auction to stop the sale of her home and offered the widow money. Trump decided to take action after he saw Hill's pleas for help in news reports.>>>>                       In 1988, a commercial airline refused to fly Andrew Ten, a sick child with a rare illness, across the country to get medical care because he had to travel with an elaborate life-support system. His grief stricken parents contacted Trump for help and he didn't hesitate to send HIS own plane to take the child from Los Angeles to New York so he could get his treatment.>>>                       In 1991, 200 Marines who served in Operation Desert Storm spent time at Camp Lejeunein,  North Carolina before they were scheduled to return home to their families. However, the Marines were told that a mistake had been made and an aircraft would not be able to take them home on their scheduled departure date. When Trump got wind of this, he sent HIS plane to make two trips from North Carolina to Miami to safely return the Gulf War Marines to their loved  ones.>>>                       In 1995, a motorist stopped to help Trump after the limo he was traveling in got a flat tire. Trump asked the Good Samaritan how he could repay him for his help. All the man asked for was a bouquet of flowers for his wife. A few weeks later Trump sent the flowers with a note that read: "We've paid off your mortgage.">>>                       In 2000, Maury Povich featured a little girl named Megan who struggled with Brittle Bone Disease on his show and Trump happened to be watching. Trump said the little girl's story and positive attitude touched his heart. So he contacted Maury and gifted the little girl and her family with a very generous check..>>>                       In 2008,after Jennifer Hudson's family members were tragically murdered in Chicago, Trump put the Oscar-winning actress and her family up at his Windy City hotel for free. In addition to that, Trump's security took extra measures to ensure Hudson and her family members were safe during such a difficult time.>>>                       In 2013, New York bus driver Darnell Barton spotted a woman close to the edge of a bridge staring at traffic below as he drove by. He stopped the bus, got out and put his arm around the woman and saved her life by convincing her to not jump. When Trump heard about this story, he sent the hero bus driver a check simply because he believed his good deed deserved to be rewarded.>>>                       In 2014,Trump gave $25,000 to Sgt. Andrew Tahmooressi after he spent seven months in a Mexican jail for accidentally crossing the US-Mexico border. President Barack Obama couldn't even be bothered to make one phone call to assist with the United States Marine's release; however, Trump opened his pocketbook to help this serviceman get back on his feet.>>>                       In 2016, Melissa Consin Young attended a Trump rally and tear fully thanked Trump for changing her life. She said she proudly stood on stage with Trump as Miss Wisconsin USA in 2005. However, years later she found herself struggling with an incurable illness and during her darkest days she explained that she received a handwritten letter from Trump telling her she's the "bravest woman, I know." She said the opportunities that she got from Trump and his organizations ultimately provided her Mexican-American son with a full-ride to college.>>>                       Lynne Patton, a black female executive for the Trump Organization, released a statement in 2016 defending her boss against accusations that he's a racist and a bigot. She tearfully revealed how she's struggled with substance abuse and addiction for years. Instead of kicking her to the curb, she said the Trump Organization and his entire family loyally stood by her through "immensely difficult times.">>>                       Trump's kindness knows no bounds and his generosity has and continues to touch the lives of people from every sex, race and religion. When Trump sees someone in need, he wants to help.>>>                       Two decades ago, Oprah asked Trump in a TV interview if he'd run for president. He said: "If it got so bad, I would never want to rule it out totally, because I really am tired of seeing what's happening with this country." That day has come. Trump sees that America is in need and he wants to help- how unthinkable!>                                 Donald Trump is a racist, bigot, sexist, xenophobe and Islamophobe --did I miss anything? The left and the media launch these hideous kinds of attacks at Trump everyday; yet, nothing could be further from the truth about the real estate mogul. As an entertainment journalist, I've had the opportunity to cover Trump for over a decade, and in all my years covering him I've never heard anything negative about the man until he announced he was running for president. Keep in mind, I got paid a lot of money to dig up dirt on celebrities like Trump for a living so a scandalous story on the famous billionaire could've potentially sold a lot of magazines and would've been a "huge" feather in my cap. Instead, I found that he doesn't drink alcohol or do drugs, he's a hard working businessman and totally devoted to his beloved wife and children. On top of that, he's one of the most generous celebrities in the world with a heart filled with more gold than his $100 million New York penthouse.>>                       "EVIL SUCCEEDS WHEN GOOD PEOPLE STAND BY AND DO NOTHING!">>                       "Silence makes cowards out of the best of men."--Abraham Lincoln.>>                       SILENCE IS CONSENT......

Despite being home to less than 5% of earth’s population, the U.S. houses nearly 25% of the world’s prison population, making it the world’s leading jailer.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Eddie Kulczyk | 1327670867329162_1327673853995530 | So let's have a lawless country where people just run amok and break whatever laws they want without fear of consequence.  See how that goes.
2 | Charlotte Stewart | 1327670867329162_1327695003993415 | What this article fails to mention is that in many other countries, forms of punishment include cutting off an ear, cutting off a finger tip, public whipping, and other Antiquated punishments. If those persons were instead institutionalized, we would have a smaller prison population per capita than they.
3 | Theresa Collins | 1327670867329162_1327674503995465 | Stop putting people in prison and throwing away the key. Families are being destroyed. Generation by generation. Drug and behavioural therapy, occupational and parental skill building is what we need instead of punishment for many offenders
4 | Angela Gene | 1327670867329162_1327675237328725 | Remember when the left jailed Dinesh D'Souza for giving too much money to a campaign? Jailing him was a waste of money and didn't protect anyone from violence. Way to go morons. Never Hillary!
5 | Don Guy | 1327670867329162_1327688453994070 | I think that in a lot of cases fines would work just as well. Being locked up is pretty extreme and only makes the private prison owners richer. Hotels don't make money with empty rooms.
6 | Jon Persons | 1327670867329162_1327673150662267 | Yeah, we do house a lot of people in jails. Places like Russia, China, and most of the countries in the Middle East just execute people for things. Would you rather that we be like them?
7 | Angela Gene | 1327670867329162_1327673760662206 | If we defended our borders better, we'd have a much smaller prison population. Trump was right about a lot of violent crime from illegals. Never Hillary!
8 | Tracy Joslyn | 1327670867329162_1327723173990598 | So we should just release criminals to go out and commit more crimes? Like one of the ones Obama had released who murdered his ex-girlfriend and her two small children.  Criminals are in prison for a reason ,blame them for their family suffering
9 | David Stupp | 1327670867329162_1327691183993797 | Don't do the crime if you can't do the time.. Liberals, always worried about a criminals rights while a victim is not even thought about. These are your college educated! They need a class on common sense! No, No! Don't put your hand behind there while your drilling a hole..
10 | Malachi Wright | 1327670867329162_1327685337327715 | The reason to this is because there is a lot of private prisons. In the 90s there was a meeting with prisons owners and owners of music industries; especially rap music. The was to promote songs with criminals influence; hence that's why there is numbers of black men in prisons. Hilary want to take away the prisons from the private owners this will help to reduce the numbers of persons in prisons.
11 | Quintin Outland | 1327670867329162_1327683207327928 | Well. We do keep making laws...and then those same lawmakers turn around and complain about the incarceration levels to win office.
12 | Lonnie Clark | 1327670867329162_1327948407301408 | Ya eddie kulczyk that's funny, whites break laws but the jails are filled with blacks and others about 85% of that 25% is minorities what an unfair and corrupt system.
13 | Ernest William Payton III | 1327670867329162_1328106780618904 | The problem is our prison system is living in the 19th century. We should have rehabilitation programs for certain offenders.
14 | C Marie Burke | 1327670867329162_1328002280629354 | Black teenagers are charged with a crime for high school fights far more often than white students. White student fights are much more violent.These high school fights should be handled in school and not by law enforcement. These students rarely recover from having this on their record.Racism in America.
15 | Zabi Habash | 1327670867329162_1327684127327836 | It's because we have militarized policing and privatized prison system in this country. We live in a monetary system where money controls everything.
16 | Angela Gene | 1327670867329162_1327676610661921 | You know what doesn't help shrink our prison population? Importing hundreds of thousands of 3rd world misogynists who hate The USA. Never Hillary!
17 | Lee Czerny | 1327670867329162_1327700177326231 | The latest Rasmussen Reports national telephone and online survey of Likely U.S. Voters finds Trump with a 43% to 41% lead over his Democratic rival. Five percent (5%) favor Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson,
18 | Don Warnick | 1327670867329162_1327684037327845 | ...Muslim Countries they cut off the right hand of thieves, behead druggies and dealers...Asian Countries thieves are beaten in public, druggies and dealers are beaten sometimes to death..in American thieves and druggies are given, 3 Hot Meals a day, Central Heat/AC, Cable TV, Free Educations and released early for "good behavior"...LoL..LoL..
19 | Sarah Wilder | 1327670867329162_1328112427285006 | Don't worry, people. Hillary and her globalist pals are cooking up a little global tragedy that's guaranteed to thin the herd by a good margin. Your first concern will be to survive that.
20 | Jay Smith | 1327670867329162_1327734893989426 | Well since we Hiltons for prisons, and half of these people live better behind bars. Free food, health care, cable TV, gyms, and law libraries. We need to make prison so terrible that the reoffend rate plummets. We need prisons like Russia.
21 | Paul J. Cropper | 1327670867329162_1327685230661059 | The reason so many people are in jail is because they are stupid enough to keep doing the same crimes over and over and never getting it right.  The reason more blacks are there is because the democrats have kept them in poverty and squaler and somehow convince their victims that it's all good and the victims believe it .... but victims ... your victim cards expire at the end of the year ... what you gonna do then ?
22 | John Lukis Stofko | 1327670867329162_1327707410658841 | There Are People In Jail That Should Not Be There #NonViolentDrugOffenders
23 | Matthew Thomas Metivier | 1327670867329162_1327679580661624 | and maybe if we didn't have for-profit prisons the people going to jail could actually get help.
24 | Jon Erdmann | 1327670867329162_1327682773994638 | Get rid of bogus laws, such as marijuana laws. That will help reduce the prison population so that we can start putting politicians and bankers in them.
25 | Ted Kisselovich | 1327670867329162_1327695593993356 | Start teaching children to be self-reliant instead of teaching them they are victims and are doomed to a life of crime and poverty.

Social media giant Twitter has nearly 4,000 employees ...

2 | Suz Grusing | 1327648123998103_1327674873995428 | Or the Saudi Prince who was major stock holder in Fox for years...should open Twitter up to his Country of Saudi Arabia .Last I read he owned about 35 million shares....Prince Alwaleed binTalal has been major player in US and World Media for years
3 | Kevin Kuhn | 1327648123998103_1327654873997428 | Trump's next business venture when he finishes ripping off the white trash rubes with his white trash tv channel. We all know the Donald can't function without the ability to tweet.

5 | Jeff Bowerman | 1327648123998103_1327654050664177 | I don't get the appeal of twitter at all, it's boring. Nothing ever happens, it's hard to navigate and find anything, they push certain people on you, that you don't care about.
6 | Sherry Lang Brock | 1327648123998103_1327716747324574 | Just start charging Trump for his tweets....you'll make a fortune overnight.
7 | Stevie Ray Kwon | 1327648123998103_1327667070662875 | Twitter is a cancer on our society. I will be more than happy to see it go.
8 | Aamonn R. Elwell | 1327648123998103_1327842737311975 | Maybe if twitter supported free speech they would still have some blood in thier veins
9 | Sarah Wilder | 1327648123998103_1328113227284926 | Well, they're scum anyway. I'm pretty sure we'll be fine when Twitter is dead and gone. Maybe Facebook will be next.
10 | Martha Hoffer | 1327648123998103_1328087097287539 | Trump using Twitter so much has put a bad taste to the Twitter experience won't use it anymore!
11 | Winona Billings | 1327648123998103_1327671523995763 | 4000 whole jobs. Wow!! a big employer about to lay off.People this is a perfect example of the times. Technology kills jobs and enriches a few.
12 | Xiaofei Zhao | 1327648123998103_1327665167329732 | Good, the sooner this left-wing company goes under, the better!
13 | Mark Primavera | 1327648123998103_1327760670653515 | Outsourcing to mexico...why not. Every company in the u s. Is going there.
14 | Joyce Samuel | 1327648123998103_1327783830651199 | Mr orange blob baby hands money pants might start using his baby hands in women's pants if there's no twitter. What else can he do at 3:00am. Obviously wasn't smart enough to put sexual favors after delivering heir in pre-nup.
15 | R Jeffrey Coates | 1327648123998103_1327775407318708 | Laid off because the Clinton campaign no longer needs them?

Donald J. Trump may already be calling for a recount of votes in what he claims will be a rigged election — but he may also want to recount the empty rooms at his hotels.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Eric Martinez | 1327591370670445_1327594130670169 | Trumps brand will be permanently damaged by his circus sideshow of hate and fear, it will never recover. What will Trump do as he loses his most loved and valued possession...money?
2 | Audrey Dellas | 1327591370670445_1327593800670202 | I'm recounting the days until this election is over and Trump crawls into his golden hole to cry.By the way, genuine question to Trump supporters, do you expect trump to go into politics after he loses? I mean, he really wants to make America great again and only he can fix it, surely he will run for mayor or senate or congress to prove it, right?
3 | Chad Hall | 1327591370670445_1327593724003543 | The people that support Trump, can't afford to stay in his Hotels lol
4 | Adele Marie | 1327591370670445_1327612710668311 | I am originally from Ocean City, NJ (the next island down from Atlantic City). I watched Trump yell at my girl scout friends, I watched him bankrupt businesses when he didn't pay. I have been boycotting Trump for over 20 years. Keep it going!
5 | Erika Harbin | 1327591370670445_1327595280670054 | Good.  People are realizing that all they are doing is funding a tax cheating scumbag bully-child by supporting his brand.  And he deserves it, too.
6 | Lyla Diaz | 1327591370670445_1327608357335413 | His name is toxic! People do know that he doesn't own all those hotels, that they have simply paid to license his name, don't they? I expect a rebranding. Who wants to book an expensive hotel and write home that they're staying at a Trump hotel? Maybe his followers would be proud to stay at a Trump motel, but that's about it.
7 | John Slate | 1327591370670445_1327618944001021 | Ok just remember his new hotels will be called scion - never go or stay there - let's send this bloviating moron to another bankruptcy so he has to movie to Russia and make money by giving putin bjs.
8 | Blaine McClellan | 1327591370670445_1327601674002748 | Then that is why you ask yourself... Why would someone take the chance in losing everything in order to be elected into political office? Sounds pretty unselfish to me. Must be that he sees this sacrifice as truely needed because he truely believes in the need for political reform in this country for our people. He sees this country falling apart and is willing to risk it all to try and save it
9 | Victor Tyrone Curry | 1327591370670445_1327656053997310 | Blaine did you honestly say that with a straight face 😐? I know as soon as you sent it you started cracking up 😂😂😂I love you Trump supporters, a joke a minute. Thanks for the laugh. 😂😂
10 | Steve Bishop | 1327591370670445_1327595354003380 | The election is rigged. Anyone who pays attention understands this. Your network and your "journalists" have already been exposed working with the DNC. Seriously, what more evidence do you need? Just ask Sanders.
11 | Bryan Bissell | 1327591370670445_1327596490669933 | It IS rigged. Election day isn't the only way to rig an election. The media has been helping rig it since the start. How much is the DNC, Hillarys Super-PACs, and the Clinton campaign paying the media?
12 | James Reighenald | 1327591370670445_1327637473999168 | Commentary over his North Carolina speech... MSNBC We can't express enough how you suck. I'll be watching your stock closely when Donald Trump becomes president. You should be planning your future in media after the elections, your losing viewers by the tens of thousands..
13 | Thomas Findley | 1327591370670445_1327647223998193 | Ok MSNBC, CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN WHY AREN'T YOU ALL COVERING TRUMP'S SPEECH NOW?  I suppose because everything he is bringing up about Donna Brazil, the campaign Clinton foundation, all these wiki leaks and more you all do not want the truth to be told on your network.
14 | Gloria Little | 1327591370670445_1327664503996465 | You post about his hotels but yet you support a woman who continually violates the law places America at risk dodges responsibility of Benghazi leaked emails how her husbands affairs and sexual assaults are not as damaging as one would believe oh and how she advocates for children but supports 9th month abortions. So please continue your "unbiased fact based non judgmental fair for both sides reporting" but we all know both parties know that MSNBC has no agenda in this election because we can scroll through all your posts regarding this election and see for ourselves you are oh so fair and unbiased and not trying to make a joke of America to all of the Nation. You value and do nothing more than try to prove to all that America is strong and united.  Keep up the great journalism.
15 | Mary Bernhard | 1327591370670445_1327809367315312 | We stayed at Trump Chicago for our 25 wedding anniversary. Never again. The design of the rooms by his wife are "disgusting". The bathrooms in the room have glass doors and walls exposing the user to anyone else in the room. What were they thinking? Maybe Trump likes to watch his wife pee. My hubby had to go use the public men's room for the "morning constitutional" cause he just couldn't stand to do it in the room.
16 | David Mcvicker | 1327591370670445_1327696950659887 | Y'all need to get off Hillary's dick and quit bashing trump, all Hillary's evil deeds and you say nothing about her. It must be nice having you campaign funded by the people who own the mainstream media 😄😄  start telling the truth instead of lying to the people that  pay your bills by believing your bs
17 | Nina Marie | 1327591370670445_622043527974477 | I recently saw a pair of Ivanka Trump shoes that I liked...but just couldn't bring myself to buy them. I have nothing against her. I was just really surprised at how negatively I feel inside, whenever I see anything with the name Trump on it.  I won't knowingly put a penny of mine towards anything Trump. And thankfully, there are plenty of other shoe brands out there that I really like! 👠👡👢👟
18 | Wanda Phillips Manning | 1327591370670445_1327604630669119 | Msnbc has its agenda. Fine. We all know whose side they are on. It is so obvious. But what i remember from rhe last elections were interviews with people who were paid by acorn to sign people up to vote and several people braggi g about geting people to sign up over and over, one man particularly sayi g that he signed 17 times, a woman sayinv she went to vote and finding out that he dead husband had voted that day... and the city that had a greater turnout of votes than they had on their voter list??? To me, then add to this administration demanding states not to have IDs as a requirement for voting, saying it isnt fair, but to take something back to walmart, you have to have an ID, or to take out a loan, gotta have an ID, to get married, you must have ID... to buy a car, house, get a credit card. Open a bank account... just makes people wonder why?
19 | Blair D. Scott Sr. | 1327591370670445_1327599217336327 | This the beginning of his end. His pride has destroyed him and his family. I won't be surprised, if Melania, ask for a divorce. This "Narcissist", has done himself in. "Pride Comes Before Destruction". His "Evil, Mean, Hateful, Racist", mouth and heart, is his enemy. Trump, your name and brand will mean nothing very soon. You will lose so much money. That Hotel in DC, will be sold and the name changed.
20 | Daniel Timothy Price | 1327591370670445_1327621067334142 | Even though this probably won't happen after the election I never ever want to see so much a tiny headline at the bottom of the TV about Trump ever again.
21 | Jesse Murrah | 1327591370670445_1327616114001304 | He is so dumb as a businessman that he did not calculate the negative IMPACT that his raunchy campaign would have on his BRAND nationwide. Not only will he lose miserably Nov 8, but he will SURELY file bancruptcy again against the govt. The same one he says has Failed miserably. America IS GREAT, ISNT IT!!!!
22 | Greg Grooms | 1327591370670445_1327637177332531 | ""I had my reasons," is all Gonzalez would say about the lodging choices, but at least one newspaper linked the choice to Trump's anti-Mexican campaign statements."  --duh!  Really?  No kidding?
23 | Diron Robinson | 1327591370670445_1327634903999425 | I don't care for the dude personally but stop all the drama on every topic!!! Jeez!!! Heck our country is falling faster than the one individual that's what we need to talk about
24 | Esther Caulcrick | 1327591370670445_1327691393993776 | As a businessman, when you cheat, say and do mean things to people, it comes back to bite you in the pocketbook! These incurred losses, will teach Trump how to be humble and respectful of women, contractors, and minorities. I hope this turns out to make a better person out of this American icon. I also hope Hillary and the Democrats hand Trump the greatest loss of all on November 8th, Election Day! #ImWithHer #VoteBlue
25 | Patty Baldwin | 1327591370670445_1327612064001709 | I would imagine once his contracts in respect to his name brand (no building, just franchised his name) are over they will not be renewed. He's hated all over the world.

One report recapped the dinner this way: "At charity roast, Donald J. Trump delivered what might as well be a campaign eulogy."
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Philip E. McDaniel | 1327565004006415_1327635407332708 | I watched the "Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner" speeches last night and they were pretty much what one would expect, Hillary may not have been the greatest stand-up comic and Trump failed to grasp the concept of self-deprecating humor.   One observation that perhaps may only be my perspective but I do consider worthy of mentioning.  Trump's "joke" (at which I admittedly laughed at the time) was the line about Melania's Convention speech.  However, after a period of consideration and thinking of her expression, I believe that after all that Trump has put her through during this campaign, to now make her the butt of a joke and then have her stand up and accept the laughter, seemed just one more example of Trump's lack of respect for women.  At such a time, one's spouse should only be highlighted with praise, never with ridicule.
2 | Steve Ridling | 1327565004006415_1327586644004251 | I think they put Dolan next to trump in case he had to perform an exorcism on him, he barely kept him in line with holy water...
3 | Theresa Timberlake Miller | 1327565004006415_1327652243997691 | No Andy Charles you sound ignorant the way to destroy America is to elect a sexual predator sociopath narcissistic racist rapist lair who tell lies on the lies he already told (who does that) Donald Trump is not ready for the highest office in the land he a Vladimir Putin lover, he told Russia to hack America DNC,and private citizens emails, he needs to be lock up ,he don't pay taxes file bankruptcy 6times, many people who work for him did not get paid took his foundation money which was donate to buy himself a statue of himself. Enough said #NOTRUMP #NOTFIT
4 | Andy Charles | 1327565004006415_1327566644006251 | This country needs Hillary Clinton to win. We need open borders and millions of undocumented immigrants. We need to be racially divided. The police need to be regulated by citizens. We need to raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour. We need to raise taxes on businesses and the wealthy. We need to be hacked. We need classified information to become public. Children need to be taught that blacks lives matter more and that the police are evil. We need to ban guns. We need to have government run healthcare. We need to continue to pay for other nations. We need to support Iran. We need to let North Korea get away with everything. We need our youth to understand that straight white conservatives are evil and ignorant. We need to allow full term abortion. We need to focus on weakening our military. We need to collapse. The only way we can recover is to start over from ground zero. The way we collapse is to elect Hillary Clinton.
5 | Rose Murray | 1327565004006415_1327583017337947 | Trump's viciousness was actually stomach-turning. How did he happen to America?Republicans 30-yrs of hate-mongering and the greedy television media for adverting profits.
6 | Othomile Maruping | 1327565004006415_1327575700672012 | Didn't he try that at a church when that brave lady who still has her senses intact emmediately stopped him? He keeps Trumping down himself
7 | Peggy Lorge | 1327565004006415_1327717743991141 | The scary part is Pence is his running mate. If Trump decides this isn't fun any more or he keals over Pence is in charge. He was listed as the worst governor in the US and had 0% support. Can't lead 1 state how will he lead 50?
8 | Matt Jones | 1327565004006415_1327575404005375 | Funny, this election perfectly justifies my reasoning for cutting the cable cords.I used to say I'd keep it to stay up on the news, but that ship has sailed, huh?  You're all Gossip networks now.
9 | Jill Richardson Berry | 1327565004006415_1327593244003591 | He's a billionaire...maybe...but seemed out of place among this NYC group. He mentioned attending when he was a young man with his dad but nothing recently.
10 | Donna Lussier Barone | 1327565004006415_1327604400669142 | He could have handled this dinner and his humorous comments with class and dignity, but apparently those are 2 words that aren't in his vocabulary of 'very good words'. Showing once again his true colors and unfit temperament to even do a 5 -minute prepared statement without reverting back to the real trump.
11 | Aurelio Carbone | 1327565004006415_1327578064005109 | Liberals and Progressives are mocking Trump for not blindly endorsing “My establishment, right or wrong.” Why should Americans circle the wagons, even after criminal voter fraud, just because you and the rest of the threatened old order want to? We have been lied to about Benghazi, about systemic attacks on blacks by police, about Obamacare, about the rot in Washington and the collusion of the press. With your focus on salacious gutter stories, you miss the bigger message -- that this election is not about Trump, but rather about the honest concerns of American citizens who have been mocked and lied to for far too long. Yes, and that includes justified concerns about election rigging. We have been told Islamic jihad attacks have nothing to do with Islam, when we see they do. We’ve been called racists, bigots, homophobes, misogynists when we’re not. We have been lied to about Obamacare and the honesty of our elected officials. Trump is the ONLY one with the courage to open these taboo subjects and many others. All the media spins are transparent, even to “non-educated deplorables”; their daily sniping attacks only fuel the righteous anger of Americans. The Advocacy Media does not grasp this and will be left scratching their collective heads when reporting Trump’s landslide victory in November."  Author: Dr. Adrian Bryttan

14 | Mary McCarson | 1327565004006415_1327671013995814 | She has some nerve even being there after what she said about Catholics! How does a supporter of abortion and defender of a child rapist consider herself a champion of children??? Not in the eyes of God Hillary!!
15 | Agnes Coffey | 1327565004006415_1327659820663600 | I've watched this dinner for several years now and never saw anyone get booed or embarrass himself so much as Trump who apparently doesn't know how to make fun of himself and prefers to use negative attacks disguised as jokes.

23 | Angela Vernon | 1327565004006415_1327713953991520 | Hillary Clinton is a class act she did a great job with her jokes at the Al charity dinner but Donald as usual was horrible. His first two jokes were fine then he wasn't funny anymore but just his true nasty self. No one has ever ever been booed the very first one was in 1945 only Donald could possibly fail at telling funny jokes and have it turn nasty and not funny. After all the Mean Nasty Disgusting name calling he has done through out this election you would think he would of taken the high road and finally poked more fun of himself but no he stooped as low as possible, as usual. He is a disgrace to the United States.
24 | Lee Czerny | 1327565004006415_1327701657326083 | The latest Rasmussen Reports national telephone and online survey of Likely U.S. Voters finds Trump with a 43% to 41% lead over his Democratic rival. Five percent (5%) favor Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson,

45% of Republicans said they might not accept election results following Donald J. Trump's warning.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Tresor Joseph | 1327544040675178_1327561464006769 | 45% of those republicans should get over themselves.... while the rest of the country will be moving forward, they are welcome to stay where they are and cry.. nobody will be listening
2 | Thomas Baine | 1327544040675178_1327548344008081 | Trump clearly won the last 2 debates. Hillary is such liar. She came there with a memorized story and had no human approach.
3 | Mary K. Edwards | 1327544040675178_1327611300668452 | Of course she did, why would anyone think else wise . She is poised strong, smart, worldly, clearly answered the questions put before her maybe didn't agree with all the answers clearly miles ahead of Donald Trump in all areas. He can not represent our country because he doesn't respect our country. He doesn't even respect himself when he flys off the handle with his inappropriate answers.
4 | Sharon Wendt | 1327544040675178_1327582987337950 | They haven't accepted election results for 8 yrs. Anytime a democrat is elected president. They are so used to the gerrymandered results in their own states they can't believe the majority of votes in the country, almost alway go, to the Democrat.
5 | Jesse Shilling | 1327544040675178_1327557810673801 | Trump supporters aren't the only ones calling foul this election cycle.  Let’s be honest and acknowledge what we are talking about. We are talking about a rapid movement in this country toward a political system in which a handful of very wealthy people and special interests will determine who gets elected or who does not get elected. That is not what this country is supposed to be about. That was not Abraham Lincoln’s vision of a government of the people, by the people, and for the people. Bernie Sanders.
6 | Christa Freightmon | 1327544040675178_1327597427336506 | Poll after poll shows CLINTON winning by large margins, but republicans won't accept it when she wins on Election Day??  Exactly what does that mean, won't accept election results?
7 | Domenic Andy DiStefano | 1327544040675178_1327550117341237 | When you have people involved with the Democratic national committee admitting to voter fraud why is this so hard to understand? Hillary said it's a conspiracy theory no it's fact presented that show your party has fix elections even their own.
8 | Suzanne Cich Rush | 1327544040675178_1327581940671388 | I'm curious, what does that mean? They are going to pretend Hillary is not president? I don't understand how that's going to change anything? How can people scream about their patriotism while proclaiming their contempt for our democratic system?
9 | Antonio Martin Mcinnis | 1327544040675178_1327566514006264 | Long live the Divided States of America after November 8th.Trump and his idiotics followers are playing right into Putin's hands.That is how te old Soviét Union fell apart.They auto destroyed themselves,with naturally the CIA help.Is payback time,and Trump is the perfect fool to give the Russians that pleasure.
10 | Jonathan A. Washington | 1327544040675178_1327562830673299 | I hope that goes for the House, Senate, and all other local races. If the Presidential race is affected, I can't trust the other races to be on the up and up. By the way, since Trump brought it up. How do we know that the 2010 and 2014 races were not rigged in favor of the Republican party? If Trump can raise questions with the election I don't see why others including myself can't
11 | Tresor Joseph | 1327544040675178_1327562910673291 | Funny republicans have so much to say but why aren't they talking about republican governors making harder for minorities to vote? The same bunch of white people who never had to fight for any rights in this country, are now crying for a rigged system... guess it wasn't rigged when women couldn't vote, or when black couldn't vote!! Shut up already.. bet they won't mind if we go back to those days
12 | Kim Deerinwater Simmons | 1327544040675178_1327599497336299 | If your candidate was up in the polls then this wouldn't even be an issue BUT HE'S NOT!!My question is..If the Republicans want change why don't you change? What your party is doing is not working. The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.
13 | Ouiser Hunt Boudreaux | 1327544040675178_1327579094005006 | Do I think there is too much influence by the rich in Washington, yes!  Do I think citizens united was a very bad thing, yes!  Do I believe we should have term limits, yes. Do I think there is election/voter fraud, no.  Do I think 45% of republicans are completely ignorant of the history of the history of this Country and of the law and how elections work, yes.  Are 45% of Republicans being duped by a very skilled con man, absolutely!!
14 | Sharon Diane | 1327544040675178_1327581270671455 | Like it or not, Hillary is going to be our next president. The peaceful transition of power is the basis of our government. The same people who scream at the top their lungs about the second amendment in the Constitution need to remember that!
15 | Ashley Neumann | 1327544040675178_1327709553991960 | Trump has made a mockery of our system. The mere fact that he even made it as a candidate with absolutely no experience or credentials relating to government is just how much this country has lost its standards and responsibility to the people. It disgusts me that just anyone can run for president.
16 | James Carol Dodson | 1327544040675178_1327612907334958 | This electoral college thing is what causes the problems with presidential elections. They need to do away with it so a politician would have to work to get EVERY vote and not try to do good in just certain states.
17 | George Frankfurter | 1327544040675178_1327637357332513 | The stupidest thing ever invented "Who won the debate?" The supporters of the one who supposedly won the debate get a jolt of reinforcement to easy their "buyers' remorse." The supporters of the one who lost the debate they are convinced that it is the bias of the liberal media and their candidate won. Don't believe it? Read Ed Rogers' analysis of the third debate in the Washington Post, and who won it. Compared to "Who won the debate"? judging gymnastics in the Olympics is done by a scientifically designed, perfectly calibrated, ultra accurate, mechanical instrument.
18 | Robin Wolfe | 1327544040675178_1327778143985101 | Who cares what these so called 'republicans' feel.....or what they will 'accept.' They, like Trump, refuse to take responsibility for their own lives. If you are unhappy with your choices, do something about it!  These people are myopic and so lazy......that rather than get a degree.....they call all education elitist.  Well......look around buddy.....that trailer home better be to your liking......because it is your present.....and your future.  Go buy another pit bull with your food stamps why don't you.......
19 | Daffodil Cee | 1327544040675178_1327730777323171 | These are the same people who the Donald conned into believing that President Obama was not born in the US and, therefore, not a legitimate POTUS. Nothing surprises me anymore at the absurdity of how these people think. Hey, it's a free country. Everyone has a choice to remain as dumb as a rock, or to learn something to expand their way of thinking beyond the hate and resentment filled dark tunnel that they are living in.
20 | Larry Burgan | 1327544040675178_1328105193952396 | Does it matter if 45% or 1 person who does't accept the results, because when all ballots are counted a winner will emerge...The 1 that wins will be the next President...If some group wants a protest or recount that doesn't fall within the Election Rules, I say fine as long as THEY pay for it and not 1 dime of taxpayer money is spent...If some whiney people who's choice didn't win and want to protest the results, let them...In January the new President ( winner of the election ) will be sworn into office...Period.
21 | Janice Owens | 1327544040675178_1327595064003409 | This post is such fake....Trump won hands down on the last 2 debates....he brought it to her..she on the other hand had hers memorized for knowing the ?? beforehand....she was guilty as sin...she hardly ever looked up and she acted like she was stoned...
22 | Salisu Isah | 1327544040675178_1327604640669118 | Trump failure to publicly admit whatever the outcomes, is a great risk to US unity and a serious threats to their peaceful coextistance, which may result into a full blown civil unrest or war, if he's not called to endorsed the outcomes of Nov elections unconditionally. The danger is questioning the credibility system, before they even conducted the elections. All the concern citizens and agencies should view this threats with utmost cautions.
23 | Jeremy Kelly | 1327544040675178_1327574530672129 | If you believe this poll you are easily manipulated by fear and the media. After the election if Clinton wins it will be the way it has been after almost every other election. Vote for whoever you want and don't be swayed by the media BS.
24 | Joyce Hudson Bell | 1327544040675178_1327594784003437 | Talking about a revolution and killing people is not the democratic way. It only get you a trip to jail while the party you hate are going about their business and enjoying life. If you really want change   , do it the legal way, start now.  Start a movement, get a platform . Groom your candidate now not 3 and a half years from now.
25 | Lyla Diaz | 1327544040675178_1327597440669838 | I just pray that the damage Trump has done to our precious electoral process will not be permanent. If it is, blame it on the very disgusting Republicans who brought this upon us!

Donald J. Trump turned to Hillary Clinton and said, "You are one tough and talented woman," said New York Archbishop Cardinal Timothy Dolan, who was seated between the two candidates at the Al Smith Dinner.

I still can't believe anyone with any intelligence & self respect would vote for him...his campaign has shown how much hate & ignorance there is in this country. btw...I'm not a Hillary fan...but I know danger when I see it
2 | Beverly A. Class | 1327495024013413_1327499574012958 | Trump has no true leadership qualities, he lacks intellectual horsepower, curiosity, a sense of right or wrong and empathy.
3 | Buscando La Verdad | 1327495024013413_1327503967345852 | Is incredible how the corruption of politicians and money worshippers are trying to survive by creating a bad image of Trump . So people don't vote for him and that way . The illuminati wins . 😟
4 | Temora Gray | 1327495024013413_1327505584012357 | I enjoyed them both. I wished the audience had not booed and that they had laughed more at Hillary's jokes. I believe there are people in Trump's camp that secretly don't support him and want him to fail. Why would they have written the second half of his jokes, knowing the purpose of that dinner? There are thousands of different ways he could have landed those ideas without being so graphic. And why bring Giuliani?  But I am delighted that my Nasty girl won!!!  We Nasty girls always wins!
5 | Carol Corpus | 1327495024013413_1327522800677302 | Hillary got a "smack-down" by the Cardinal at last night's Al Smith dinner -- twice he said we need to sanctify life from womb to natural death -- she's for partial-birth abortion -- killing a baby within minutes of its being born and VITAL. WOW -- there's a special place.... .  Click on the pictures below to see what this baby is thinking as it feels the outside air on its tiny, viable body...HORRIFIC!
6 | Billy Brown | 1327495024013413_1327512360678346 | The public persona and the private persona of most politicians are often much different from reality. I have been involved in politics most of my adult life. People who hate each other in the political arena are often good friends in the real world. You can have differences of opinion politically and still be friends. I am fairly left wing politically and have friends from all political stripes. We may disagree with each other but we don't hate each other.
7 | Delia Hinojos | 1327495024013413_1327736770655905 | Happy that in private after the Dinner both Hillary and Trump were matured adults and professional towards one another. ***Per the dais at the Al Smith Dinner, "there were some very touching moments" in private, Dolan said, describing one right after he asked both of them to pray with him.“After the little prayer, Mr. Trump turned to Secretary Clinton and said, ‘You are one tough and talented woman,’” Dolan said. "He said, 'This has been a good experience, this whole campaign, as tough as it’s been.'"Clinton then returned the compliment.“She said to him, ‘Donald, whatever happens, we need to work together afterward,’” Dolan said."
8 | Charles Cole | 1327495024013413_1327512394011676 | Trump Supporters are a threat along with himself, to Democracy, and an Embrassement to this Great Country that we Live in! What Stupidity would allow these Party Loyalist, Policy Illiriate Narrow minded People to be so Evil!!!HRC For President!!
9 | Theresa D'Angelo | 1327495024013413_1327501477346101 | I have never understood this dinner. Raise the money without the " comedy ". It's not about " civility " anymore, if it ever was.
10 | Tom Supernovich | 1327495024013413_1327497950679787 | I think that it's absolutely hilarious that so many of you are still falling for this giant charade.
11 | Shaun Riggs | 1327495024013413_1327657483997167 | If that's true it's too bad he can't act like less of a lunatic when running for the highest office in the land. He has his cult like followers chanting lock her up and some of them openly talking about assassinating her. He sees this whole country's election as a game where he can say or do whatever he wants and he's rich so he will never have to deal with the consequences.
12 | Jeff Arata | 1327495024013413_1327542397342009 | Someone in my household was watching the news this morning (not sure which channel) and their segment was called "Trump's Rough Week". I'm sorry, what? We have video evidence of Hillary's klan inciting violence at rallies, they're vandalizing GOP offices and more wikileaks releases incriminating Hillary, yet somehow it's Trump's rough week? I just laughed and turned off the TV, the media has no credibility anymore.
13 | Jayne Duncan Stites | 1327495024013413_1327504337345815 | We have to change the discourse of our conversation. We must stop the one upmanship, that is so prevalent in our discussions. First and foremost, we are AMERICANS! We are WE THE PEOPLE  the rest of the world aspires to be. We must return to being that shining light, a beacon of hope for others who would die to be here, to be in our shoes. We must stop taking each other for granted. Because, at the end of the day, it is as true today as it ever has been; United We Stand and Divided We Fall!
14 | George Marshall | 1327495024013413_1327733690656213 | They both suck and have been in power so long they have lost their humanity. Stop trying to pretend either has the moral high ground, neither have morals. Just vote the issue (trade, immigration, abortion, etc...). The Supreme Court is at  stake.
15 | Jahseyne Eccleston | 1327495024013413_1328057190623863 | I'm trying to be neutral here, but I actually thought Donald was funny in the beginning. He took it too far, though. Started calling Sec. Clinton corrupt and all that. That was too much. He almost had a half-presidential moment.
16 | Tammy Andersen | 1327495024013413_1327576414005274 | Trump and Clinton are longtime friends, this could all be an act to get Clinton elected as president. Just like the WWE has wrestlers act like they are really mad just to gather ratings!
17 | Hope TR | 1327495024013413_1327652857330963 | The manipulation, lies and corruption of Hillary's campaign and the Dems is what is atrocious, and can not be tolerated in American politics. The crooked media is supporting these lies and promoting stupidity to cover up Hillary's 30 yrs of crimes, 4 Americans she killed in Benghazi, millions she has stolen from fraudulent Clinton Foundation and the emails with government top secrets she "erased" to protect her corrupt deals. Journalism is dead in America , Washington political investigating commissions , and the FBI have to be investigated for corruption, and all need to be tried in a REAL hearing , by a REAL prosecutor who will apply REAL democracy , not the sold out corruption now governing DC. TRUMP 2016 !
18 | Daffodil Cee | 1327495024013413_1327755867320662 | He was clueless as to what the night was all about. He managed  to get laughs with one joke at the expense of his wife. He snarled at his wife to get up like she was his domestic help. He was booed pretty much most of his speech.
19 | Patrice Culbreath Henry | 1327495024013413_1327792750650307 | I watched the entire dinner program. It was not intended to be a "roast."In my opinion, they both behaved as expected. VOTE EARLY! YOUR VOTE = YOUR VOICEBlessed be! 🌞
20 | Lee Czerny | 1327495024013413_1327701810659401 | The latest Rasmussen Reports national telephone and online survey of Likely U.S. Voters finds Trump with a 43% to 41% lead over his Democratic rival. Five percent (5%) favor Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson,

22 | Pat Kennedy | 1327495024013413_1327568420672740 | He scares me. But- I watched the highlights where he actually made a little fun of himself- and he seemed more human. Not presidential material- but maybe not a Hitler after all.
23 | Steve Smith | 1327495024013413_1327537290675853 | These comments show to me the futility of discussion of politics at this cycle of our country. Hate, fear, jealousy, hypocrisy, and envy are peaking. It is a repeating cycle too, we have had such anger and hate many times before. It is just more apparent now because of the immediacy of communication the digital age has brought. These two leaders know the nature of conflict and humanity. They were once friends. Though I laud the efforts of Catholics in bringing them together to understand their commonality, I worry when matter and anti-matter get near each other.
24 | Anne P. Day | 1327495024013413_1327509517345297 | Nice to hear the civility between the two...one will be prez...It was nice to see Donald reach to shake hands and Hillsry did....that could have been awkward.Both had cheers and jeers and went a bit dark but overall good night for both. 😊
25 | Lynn Nash Hino | 1327495024013413_1327593030670279 | How forgiving of the Catholic community ... her campaign made derogatory statements and plans to basically get rid of them and  yet they break bread and will continue to accept their money.... sad everything can be bought :-(

In his first comments since the debate, Donald J. Trump  said Thursday that he would accept the general election results — "if I win."
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Don Baker | 1327453197350929_1327485657347683 | The results were not final until after the Supreme Court made a ruling about how Florida's votes should be counted, a ruling that effectively handed Florida's electoral votes and thus the presidency to Bush. Gore then graciously accepted the outcome even though he had received more popular votes than Bush had. He didn't whine. He didn't call his armed fanatics into insurrection. He conceded and quietly returned to private life. Can you really imagine Trump doing the same?
2 | Jon Ralph | 1327453197350929_1327471457349103 | Florida law requires a recount when the spread is less than 1%; and all ballots are examined closely. The details of the examination ended up in the Supreme Court; after the biased, FL Secretary of State put her thumb on the scale.
3 | Julie Rose | 1327453197350929_1327473620682220 | Never Mind This: Let's just stampede on every word Trump says..#Benghazi in case some of you are wondering...Ambassador Stevens was sent to Benghazi in order to retrieve US made Stinger missiles supplied to Ansar al Sharia without Congressional oversight or permission. Hillary brokered the deal through Stevens and a private arms dealer named Marc Turi. Remember that name... Then some of the shoulder fired missiles ended up in Afghanistan used against our own military. It was July 25th, 2012 when a Chinook helicopter was taken down by one of our own Stingers, but the idiot Taliban didn't arm the missile and the Chinook didn't explode, but had to land anyway. An ordnance team recovered the serial number off the missile which led back to a cache of Stingers being kept in Qatar by the CIA. Obama and Hillary were now in full panic mode and Stevens was sent in to retrieve the rest of the Stingers. This was a "do-or-die" mission, which explains the stand down orders given to multiple commando teams. It was the State Dept, not the CIA that supplied them to our sworn enemies, because Petraeus wouldn't supply these deadly weapons due to their potential use on commercial aircraft. Then, Obama threw Gen. Petraeus under the bus after he refused to testify that he OK'd the BS talking points about a spontaneous uprising due to a Youtube video. Obama and Hillary committed treason...and THIS is what the investigation is all about, why she had a private server, (in order to delete the digital evidence), and why Obama, two weeks after the attack, told the UN that the attack was because of a Youtube video, even though everyone knew it was not. The Taliban knew that this administration aided and abetted the enemy without Congressional approval when Boehner created the Select Committee, and the Taliban began pushing the Obama Administration for the release of 5 Taliban Generals. Bowe Bergdahl was just a pawn...everyone KNEW he was a traitor. So we have a traitor as POTUS that is not only corrupt, but compromised...and a woman that is a serial liar, perjured herself multiple times at the Hearing whom is running for POTUS. Only the Dems, with their hands out, palms up, will support her. This is why no military aircraft was called in...because the administration knew our enemies had Stingers supplied to the enemy by Obama and Hillary and they'd be caught had it hit the fan. Sound about right Hillary? #Benghazi #AmbassadorStevens
4 | Kristin L Oppold | 1327453197350929_1327453600684222 | MSNBC News please please please find your way back to journalistic integrity. A very large population of people are missing some big pictures in this election. I can tell you that if you did you would have a very large group of grateful followers.
5 | Michael Howard | 1327453197350929_1327523110677271 | Trump's mouth and his behavior is what changing the outcome of the election and Fox News Network, the Russians, Republican politicians, some fellow Republicans, conspirator experts and his base can't save him. Although, they're trying very hard to turn this landslide around. By, attacking any and everyone who is speaking or writing against Trump. The Trump surrogates and his base are blaming the media for the landslide, but every time Trump open his mouth, he adds to the slide. I can't blame Trump for his behavior or actions, because that's who he is. I blame all of those people that hopped on the band wagon and was egging him on to failure. Trump's new war cry is "Rigged Election".
6 | James Carol Dodson | 1327453197350929_1327514507344798 | The trouble with that is if Trump wins most of the people in the Country are going to have trouble accepting that outcome. If he wins our voting process is woefully flawed.He doesn't meet even the lowest standard for being qualified to be our President.
7 | Constance A Marshall | 1327453197350929_1327534970676085 | Well Trump I guess you're not going to accept results & the suspense will be how does one argue against America's overwhelming majority of votes for Madam President
8 | Charles Gustafson | 1327453197350929_1327703783992537 | Trump and his supporters believe alike. I fairly (maybe), beat 16 more qualified people. I therefore should be anointed President as was done in 2000. End of story.
9 | Aubrey Herring | 1327453197350929_1327940120635570 | Looking long term, post defeat of the weasel in this election. I have serious concerns about the role of the narcissistic weasel, he is not the type to just go away. Indications are he and his family along with his enablers like Steve Banning and BRIETBART  are developing some sort of media / communication / television initiative. Considerong the 40 percent of glass eaters and koolaid drinkers who blindly follow and accept his every action without thought or consideration as to legitimacy or impact, they will need an outlet.I suspect that is what the weasel is positioning himself post election to be that outlet.As the leader of a neo fascist media conglomerate spewing the kinds of vile vitriolic hate filled rhetoric that he has exposed us to during the last year, creating division and distrust has the potential to cripple governance and further the division that he has exploited during his campaign.Phase one appears to prepping the battle zone by sewing seeds of doubt regarding the election and our democratic process. Phase two might be the rejection of the election results regardless of circumstances or ballots counted.Then what, and therein lies my concern. History is not favorable to these kinds of events and historically has lead to difficult times.I truly hope I'm misreading this story but watch this space!!!
10 | Darrell Davidodetchenstein | 1327453197350929_1327470340682548 | His own party is trying to shut him up with this because there's a bit of truth in what he's saying. Election is rigged, in favor of republicans, due to their blatant voter suppression of entire areas of people because they most likely would not vote for them. They don't want the masses to further awaken to their fascist agenda. Trump is the republican party and they are him!
11 | Jenny Torpey Gray | 1327453197350929_1327474604015455 | Omg, what women was just badgering Mr. Cortes the Hispanic liason? She infered that the media doesn't manipulate popular view. What a lier she is. Great to defend what a personal REPORTER infered her personal opinion! Reporters are suppose to report, not give their own personal opinion. It appears that reporters are becoming more and more like a National Star reporter.
12 | M E MBeth Elliott | 1327453197350929_1327479537348295 | Many States require automatic recounts in close elections. Trump as usual knows nothing, but doesn't let that stop him from making an A++ of himself.
13 | Scott Mcpherson | 1327453197350929_1327463900683192 | Yes, there was not photographic evidence that the Republicans were paying operatives to commit voter fraud back then. There was not evidence that there was illegal and unethical behavior by the winner in the primary like we have seen this year. Totally different!
14 | Sandy R. Killgo | 1327453197350929_1327633550666227 | Trump casts himself as Luke Skywalker fighting the inhumane system. He says he wants to destroy it and replace it with whatever he alone envisions — again and again he says, in effect, “I Am The Man.” His supporters and followers get it. They project the hero image in their own psyche onto Trump.But does this make Trump a hero? Hardly. There is nothing he has said or done that suggests he wants to use the system for human purposes.He meets obstacles on the way, but prevails. Donald Trump — always a winner. To accomplish this, he has sacrificed — as he sees it, a sacrifice as great as losing a son in war. His sacrifice has been to make billions from building a business. So what if his successful father staked him in the beginning with capital to help make his journey easier and more comfortable? The elder’s sacrifice doesn’t count in the Trump version of his narrative, as it does in Star Wars.Now Trump says he wants serve a higher purpose, to give his life to something bigger than himself — to the country, to history — by winning the presidency. If he prevails, he will show his country how to be great again by also winning. The message he brings back to his people: Everyone in Washington is stupid or corrupt. America should be like me, like Donald Trump. Trump. No doubt many of Trump’s followers hate the system he’s fighting, one in which technology and trade have beaten them down, have made them losers. In their eyes Trump is a winner. He presents his own successes as a gift that others could enjoy if they elect him: his third wife, the fairest of them all — a virtual mannequin on which to hang his manhood; his children, who appear to be constructed by highly paid artists to make them seem perfect and who are following in their father’s own perfect footsteps, starting at the top; and, finally, his buildings all over the world — the most gilded (if not always the tallest), and bearing his name in capital letters.But the truth is there is no hero there. Trump is the very personification of the system that enabled him to win — a white, wealthy, powerful male who dominates everything in his orbit, the white supremacist writ large who would make America over in his own violent image.So the question arises: Is Trump, then, Darth Vader? It’s tempting to answer yes. Campbell said that “when the mask of Darth Vader is removed, you see an unformed man, one who has not developed as a human individual. What you see is a strange and pitiful sort of undifferentiated face.” When we look at Trump, we have to ask: Where is the humanity?But Donald Trump is not Darth Vader. He may actually be worse. Darth Vader knows better than to want to destroy the system and set out instead to harness it to his purpose. Trump is on no hero’s journey. His is a journey of self-destruction, hate and cruelty. Unlike the hero who serves humanity, Trump is simultaneously serving his own self-destructive “dark side” while calling forth America’s dark side — bullies obsessed with money, power and materialistic success, absorbed with their own hubris and empire. Instead of trying to improve the system and make it better for all, he is trying to blow it up. The alternative he offers would be chaos.Despite all of its flaws and failings, our democratic system has produced some of the best expressions of positive human effort and ideals so far in history. Most Americans want our government to work and we want to make it work better — but not by destroying it. We want to win over the dysfunctions of the system. We want to get our country back in order to get it going again — in the right direction, serving most of the people, most of the time. If only “the elites” — Republicans and Democrats and independents — would hear what the majority of Americans on all sides are saying, Trump would suddenly be irrelevant, exposed as Darth Vader was in the final scenes of Star Wars — a puny and pathetic farce.
15 | Asim Ansari | 1327453197350929_1327614914001424 | Trump It will be a. Old day in hell before you even come close to WHI think instead of wasting ur time just hang it up accept defeat and continue living in ur reality world I would like to see u r defeated in all 50 states
16 | Brenda Bren Trask | 1327453197350929_1327469744015941 | I agree with Kristin L Oppold which to me includes getting rid of a very tiresome and hateful Andrea Mitchell! Yeah we all get you hate Hillary and at every opportunity you have to try to be insulting and just unprofessional!
17 | Maureen Andros | 1327453197350929_1327718143991101 | This is another attempt for Trump to stay in the news. It's worked for him since Day 1. He makes ridiculous comments and the media runs with it. He's had more media coverage than the assassination of JFK!
18 | Chris Nighman | 1327453197350929_1327833860646196 | No: Gore never claimed the election was "fixed", either before or afterwards. Trump's threat that he might refuse to accept the legitimacy of the election if he loses is completely different.
19 | Xiaofei Zhao | 1327453197350929_1327653730664209 | Of course, it is always okay for Democrats to falsely claim fraud and contest elections, but Republicans must quietly slink away after elections are stolen from them.
20 | Ken Myers | 1327453197350929_1327468734016042 | 2000 was so different, no one said rigged even though there were plenty of reasons. Most of all the only issue would be upon finding the Florida issue again, not months before. Saying if it is close and there is a reason to do the Florida thing they will, okay. But to say it is all unfair is below even Donnie.
21 | Judith Wijsheid | 1327453197350929_1327631297333119 | MSNBC, please highlight the point that if Trump will only accept the outcome of the election if he wins... it follows that NONE of us can accept the outcome of the election if we don't like the outcome. It means that Hillary Clinton CANNOT accept the outcome of the election, either. If Trump wins, there MUST be an investigation to the legitimacy of his win. In essence, he has shot himself in the foot. If both (or all) parties do not agree to accept the outcome of the election, than NEITHER may do so!
22 | Brett Brown | 1327453197350929_1327988390630743 | I love how the media was all over the Al Smith charity dinner re enforcing Trump and Hillery despise each other! Relax folks it's all part of the show. Honesty first! Civilly and dignity second. For one is the byproduct of the other and not the reverse.-45
23 | Mae Swope | 1327453197350929_1327822763980639 | I sincerely hate u people in Florida thinking it was normal to have illegal citizens be allowed to have rights to vote. All this does people is help w/recount every election year.  How many electoral votes did they get w/including illegal citizens. Not many and they decide President of the USA by special hand delivery. Not u popular voters...It's all a waste of money...oh well Florida people have fun!!!!! Here's the facts of website....   electoralcollege.info
24 | Mark Rush | 1327453197350929_1327464737349775 | This was Donald " The Crook " Trump's biggest fault on display, his inability to take a simple question and not turn it into a major controversy.  All he had to say was of course I will accept the outcome of the election, but if there are questions I will reserve the right to challenge the results, but I don't see that happening, America has the greatest democracy in the world, no controversy, he never fails an opportunity to dig a hole for himself, you have to wonder if he really wants to be President of The United States or is playing at some other game,
25 | Mike McNeil | 1327453197350929_1327478454015070 | I am not sure how anyone is not at least a little skeptical of the validity of elections when we see political parties use any media or political manipulation available , and that their elitist and industrial supporters will spend any amount of money to buy influence.  That the only possible thing that prevents rigged elections would be that their propaganda is so effective that there is no need,or fear of discovery.  Certaintly not that there are no wolves at democrcys door.

The filmmaker, James O'Keefe, released two videos this week in an attempt to harm the Hillary Clinton campaign. Donald J. Trump didn't disclose his association.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Eric Borim | 1327409607355288_1327430294019886 | BWA-HA-HA-HA!!!!! The combined efforts of James O'Keefe, Kenneth Starr, David Bossie, Maureen Dowd, Julian Assange, Trey Gowdy, Bernie-or-bust, Jill-not-Hill and Steve Bannon have resulted in one thing....19 days until President Clinton 2.0!!!
2 | Maria Rodriguez Klimka | 1327409607355288_1327416924021223 | I'm not surprised that all those videos could also be just a set up to harm Hillary... what it's surprising is that Trump actually paid someone back...😳
3 | Michelle Poage-Oldroyd | 1327409607355288_1327428687353380 | Not surprised just sad that his followers believe this alleged sexual assault, crazy, lying embarrassment to the USA Presidential Candidate. All they say is emails, Benghazi. Really emails vs this hideous man. He belongs in a far away place. VOTE BLUE up and down the ticket.
4 | Ed Levine | 1327409607355288_1327455490684033 | Trump truly represents the current GOP. He always cheats, but whines about the other side cheating. He always lies but accuses the other side of lying. He sends all of his manufacturing jobs to Asia and Mexico, then tells voters that his opponent, not he, supports sending jobs overseas. He has stated that American workers, including minimum wage workers make too much money, suggesting that they should earn something closer to what workers in Vietnam earn, then blames his opponent for low wages when she wants the minimum wage to be more than doubled. I agree with the GOP voting public. He is the face of your party. I hope that someday, you will see that it is the face of a coward, a con, an elitist who cares nothing about you, except when it comes to getting your vote.
5 | Beatrice Rohde | 1327409607355288_1327450380684544 | So, James O'Keefe, a political peeping Tom has been paid to film and edit the poop out of a film to blame the Clinton's campaign for violence. Really? $10,000 is a lot of money for Tramp to spend on the criminal. Project Veritas is a fake, criminal package birthed by Steve Bannon and David Bossie. Two of the biggest dirt bags ever. They will do anything and say anything.
6 | Travis Twomey | 1327409607355288_1327417377354511 | Joseph O'Connell Not quite. Your statement "CNN is therefore biased and untrustworthy" is a judgement or interpretation derived from fact, thus at best it is an informed opinion and at worst a biased and untrustworthy opinion. You have a right to your opinions and an obligation to NOT call them facts.
7 | Nyesiga Bryan N | 1327409607355288_1327416830687899 | Msnbc you have consistently attacked mr trump with your biased and corrupt reporting, does Clinton foundation pay for all the lies you've told?
8 | Debra Palmer | 1327409607355288_1327554697340779 | This is why Trump is so paranoid that someone is rigging the election because it's what he's been doing all along. He is responsible for the Russia hack I certainly hope the Justice Dept doesn't let him get away with that. Hope a therall investigation is done!
9 | Dawn Freeman | 1327409607355288_1327481034014812 | So, I looked at the list of charities, and on there is the Caring for Military Families donation. I have been a military  wife for over 30 years and I had never heard of this "charity" so i google,,, what comes up is The Elizabeth Dole Foundation, but no Caring for Families, would really like to know it EDF actually received the funds or if it went to another "charity"?
10 | Deron Angel | 1327409607355288_1327457167350532 | I would like to see is the media outlets showing both sides of the stories more evenly. It is a fact that most if the MSM is spending the overwhelming majority of their time spreading negative information about one candidate and very little time on any of the others. People need to be able to make informed decisions. There seems to be a great deal of info about corruption out there that isn't being reported through MSM. Is it really so much to ask that the issues from all sides be reported somewhat equally so we all can figure it out without media bias?
11 | Jeff Arata | 1327409607355288_1327542890675293 | Someone in my household was watching the news this morning (not sure which channel) and their segment was called "Trump's Rough Week". I'm sorry, what? We have video evidence of Hillary's klan inciting violence at rallies, they're vandalizing GOP offices and more wikileaks releases incriminating Hillary, yet somehow it's Trump's rough week? I just laughed and turned off the TV, the media has no credibility anymore.
12 | Laura Reynolds | 1327409607355288_1327676463995269 | LOL another story full of BS because a 3rd party found this data from the Foundation and NBC's staff couldn't find it. Give me a break I researched for this data and it does not exist. Please learn to do your jobs properly as a news media.
13 | Candy Hall Hester | 1327409607355288_1327541104008805 | Does he really believe anyone other than his followers are going to believe this crap? It's Trump's MO. Do something, say something disgusting, then blame it someone else. In this case it's Hillary
14 | Aldo Mancini | 1327409607355288_1327963727299876 | It would be very difficult to find a more underhanded, despicable, deplorable person than Trump. Actually paying someone to make a video falsely accusing someone of doing something wrong. He is a victim of his own creation. 😡😡😡f
15 | C.a. Maskew | 1327409607355288_1327439227352326 | Wait wait wait. Let me get this straight. They say trump pays okeefe to do this undercover investigation which shows hillarys cronies committing fraud and acts of violence and voter intimidation and you guys say trump and okeefe should be the ones in prison. Wow. Unfreaken believable. This reaffirms my beliefs what the democrats are truly what's wrong with our country.
16 | Constance A Marshall | 1327409607355288_1327543214008594 | In my Gomer Pyle voice, surprise surprise surprise as if any sane person didn't know this the minute OKeefe's name was mentioned! Trump is clearly using a page out of NYC Yankees playbook thinking he can buy anything including an election! Sorry Yankees we all know the truth just used y'all as an analogy! Fit Trump supporters that mean an example 😂😂😂
17 | Terry Ellison | 1327409607355288_1327418630687719 | The bottom-line, it's true concerning Trump supporters (The Uneducated what percentage is unknown, but the way it looks it's HIGH).............I take what they say with a grain of salt..........
18 | Bj Skiffington | 1327409607355288_1327819887314260 | Nice try at deflecting the content of the videos is what the real issue is. Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt criminal ever to run for public office. She's guilty of Espionage and Perjury she's unqualified to be POTUS
19 | Loretta AdaMary Denslow Gee | 1327409607355288_1327756740653908 | The mission of Project Veritas is to 'investigate and expose corruption, dishonesty, self-dealing, waste, fraud', meanwhile the democrats promote corruption, dishonesty, self-dealing, waste, and fraud! That's the difference!
20 | Chad Anthony Gibson | 1327409607355288_1327424790687103 | America needs to stand up for every one of our rights, it's really disgusting that most of us are sheep and ignorant about politics, if you want your children or your grandchildren to enjoy the freedoms that you are currently taking advantage of then stand up listen to the facts and prosecute those who lie directly to the American public like Hillary Clinton! It's very obvious that her surrogates are out there manipulating the election process and yet no one is doing anything , this is ridiculous! God will judge us for allowing others to take this country Straight to Hell!
21 | Jude Birch | 1327409607355288_1327423360687246 | This morning's Joe acting as if everyone else has lost their mind over Trump - surely he's forgotten umpteen fits of his own over these last months; sounding sanctimonious over his own calm at the moment? Too much.
22 | Esther Caulcrick | 1327409607355288_1327898240639758 | Trump used his advertising dollars to pay people to dig up crap 💩 to harm Hillary, but in the end it has backfired on him. He has sold his soul to the devil. Hillary will win, because "love trumps hate." #ImWithHer
23 | John Williamson | 1327409607355288_1327468904016025 | The sad part, good or bad he is doing your job better than you are MSNBC. I would be embarrassed to even mention that someone is doing my job better than me.
24 | Carol Rinker Petersen | 1327409607355288_1327671593995756 | The exhibit of "accounts payable" makes the one put out by "Chris from Massachusetts" (that lists A.C.O.R.N. as a payee - who has been defunct for over 5 years) look almost legit!  (I wonder if this one was created by MS Paint also).  And BTW, if Veritas only got $10,000 for all their work, they were robbed!
25 | Virginia Buonanno | 1327409607355288_1327460827350166 | BREAKING NEWS: President and Billionaire Businessman Thurston Howell III was informed early this morning by top Government Officials that A Russian Nuclear Submarine had been spotted off the coast of Long Island. Presidents Howell immediately reacted and ordered that the ship be escort  into the harbor and searched to see if they was any Caviar on board! He further ordered his aide to send a Russian Interpreter to the ship and find out if the crew was saying nice things about him. You might remember that President Howell and his wife Lovey  took an afternoon cruise on the SS Minnow several years ago when they countered a storm and were shipwrecked and stranded on a remote and deserted island in the Pacific with several other passengers and the crew of the Minnow.  At the time of their rescue two other passengers of the SS MINOW  (who only identified themselves as Ginger and Maryann) claimed that during their time on the island President Howell grouped them when they were alone with him. Presidents Howell has denied those claims saying only that they were ugly and fat. The President's  Wife Lovey  said she didn't recall seeing any other women on the island and dismissed any possibility of such behavior by her husband.  She said she  knew from personal experience that her husband was not capable of committing such an act because this fingers were too short. She ended by saying she knew both of the woman well and they were both fat ugly liars.

Both candidates traded light-hearted jokes but also sharp barbs at the white-tie dinner and fundraiser for Catholic charities in New York City.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Zulfiqar Ahmed | 1327367300692852_1327368734026042 | Trump and his deplorables are done. This debate is a third victory for Hillary. One candidate is prepared to be presdent, the other candidate is already making excuses. Pathetic.
2 | Patty McGowan Baumeister | 1327367300692852_1327373950692187 | Just like at the debates, Trump started out strong and failed at the end. The crowd started to boo him. Hillary was prepared.
3 | Robert J Zeleniak | 1327367300692852_1327400027356246 | No,there was no equivalencry between the two candidates comments. Trump clearly crossed a line and was booed and heckled by the obviously shocked crowd. The man is a boor and you should report this accurately.
4 | Bob Schwartz | 1327367300692852_1327398190689763 | According to tradition, the speakers are to be self deprecating" and sharp. Trump was caustic, got booed and never depricated himself, but threw his wife under the bus (it was his best joke of the night). He's simply not funny or fun and only laughs when it's at someone else's expense. So not presidential, appropriate or even nice.
5 | Gloria Del Carmelo Johnson | 1327367300692852_1327373410692241 | DemoRats are just plain stupid and hypocrites, but they think that they are the selected ones and that they are smart. Prepare yourselves for the surprise of your life. Unless the election is rigged, Donald Trump will win in a landslide.#TrumpPence2016 🕇👍❤
6 | James Kilroy | 1327367300692852_1327403890689193 | Trump is thinking that it's rigged because the Leftwing liberal media is in the pocket of the ruling party like a communist country! by not report the dirt on their Party here's just one example Where was Bill last night? He could of confessed to the Cardinal ~  http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2016/10/17/new_okeefe_video_clinton_campaign_dnc_coordinated_with_organizations_to_beat_up_trump_supporters.html
7 | Linda Hanner | 1327367300692852_1327406490688933 | I think we've been played...The reverse psychology game about the voting or how to buy them...he opens the door to it, gets Clinton & all the media up in arms & absolutely refutes possibility of buying electoral votes so isn't this kinda like Deja Vu with G.W.B??? Spun it the opposite way in his favor😱Distraction well played I'll give him that but C'mon people it's not too late to address it & put that fire out!
8 | Adrian Constantyn | 1327367300692852_1327428267353422 | Here's the thing about jokes: if you make one about a person, event, or anything you have made serious statements about previously, then it's already not funny and we know you're not kidding. If after each "joke" you add the phrase "Seriously" or "It's true", then that completely negates the joke and we are no longer laughing with you, if we even were in the first place.
9 | Jim Bachmann | 1327367300692852_1327822373980678 | Humorous is being kind.  It was awkward at best, mean spirtited and petty at worst, on Trump's part.  The man has no sense of humor, except for when he's being mean to someone.
10 | Mary Linderberg | 1327367300692852_1327400604022855 | Best line of the night at the Al Smith charity dinner by Trump:  "Coming into the dinner Hillary accidentally bumped into me and said; Pardon Me!"   LOL!!!!Even Hillary was seen laughing and mouthing "Good one" - very witty.
11 | Janet Luby Kenney | 1327367300692852_1327406910688891 | Just saw the clips on the news this morning, and I'm surprised one irony was missed when Hillary was making her speech. I'm paraphrasing, but she was explaining if Trump wins, that when he gets sworn in, all the living presidents will be there, including Bill. However, she said as clear as day, Barack won't be able to be there due to Trump's Muslim ban. Now, think about what she said and implied, because last I checked and had shoved down my throat, Obama isn't Muslim.
12 | Kristin L Oppold | 1327367300692852_1327453920684190 | MSNBC News please please please find your way back to journalistic integrity. A very large population of people are missing some big pictures in this election. I can tell you that if you did you would have a very large group of grateful followers.
13 | Earl Hand | 1327367300692852_1327466007349648 | I am still voting for Trump! [Please note, this was said by Angie Hoffman and it has over  25,000 shares so far.]  Angie Hoffman said it best.....I was asked tonight how I could ever support Trump after the comments he made over 11 years ago about women and if I would still support him if he made those comments to my daughter? My response was this....If he had put our nations security at risk, I would not vote for him. If his organization received large donations from countries that killed women and gays, I would not vote for him. If he boasted 30 Years of government experience, but still could not discern if an email was classified or not, without someone letting him know if it was or not, I would not vote for him. If he boasted about how he has defended children his entire life, but is for abortion, (even late term, when the child can feel pain) I would not vote for him. If he wanted my 3 year old Granddaughter to go to restrooms with men dressed as women, I would not vote for him. I have taught my daughter and will teach my granddaughter to disregard sexist remarks and move on, especially when they were made so many years ago and, also to forgive those who say they are sorry. If he caused lives to be destroyed in Benghazi and then lied to the faces of the parents as they stood at their child's casket, I would not vote for him. If people who came against him mysteriously turned up dead, I would not vote for him. If he suddenly developed a southern accent when he was in the South, campaigning, I would not vote for him. If he continually broke the law and that was ignored, I would not vote for him, but right now, the only person who does all these things is Hillary. Right now, the fact that Donald made these remarks over 11 years ago, does not move me. I'm bigger than those remarks and we all have said stupid things throughout our lives. To me, the fact that Hillary lies continuously, is a much bigger problem. We can see the effects of her lies by the state of our poor country right now... ... Rant over... Still voting for Trump.  Please share if you agree
14 | Chuck Foster | 1327367300692852_1327426374020278 | I just think it's very important for people to know the true history behind the Democratic Party, like the fact they started the KKK the same year Abraham Lincoln ended slavery, and the first 7 congressmen were elected into the republican congress in 1884, the democrats didn't elect a black congressmen until the mid 1930's. The fact is, there was no change in sides after the democrats lost control of their KKK members as they want you to believe, that's just a lie, so what the democrats did was launch what they called The Big Deal, which was welfare system to get basically but the black votes, and cause during this time a lot of blacks were struggling economically and needed the money to feed their families and keep a roof over their heads, and they want to keep the black community dependent on welfare to keep their votes. Look at Chicago as an example, democrats been in control of Chicago for the last 50 years, and purposely keep the blacks suppressed to insure they vote for them, and keep them dependent on government assistance, only for their votes! The Rebel Flag, was a racist flag that was created by democrats in the mid 1800's! Truth is the Republicans have been trying to help the black community since before Abraham Lincoln was elected! Another historic fact is the first legal slave owner in America, was actually a black man named Anthony Johnson, who won the rights to keep his white slave in the courts indefinitely, after he ran away and was caught by a neighbor. Bottom line is if blacks wanna help save the poverty stricken inner cities, the best way to do this is by voting for Trump, and getting people back in the work force. Do yourself a favor and research Frederick Douglas, a true hero before his time, and a very famous republican black man!I mean no disrespect at all, but the power of the Internet is knowledge, and we can all come together and honestly make America great again for EVERYONE!
15 | Lindsay White | 1327367300692852_1327469600682622 | WAKE UP:Putin is bombing hospitals, women, children and Humanities stations, what is Christian about that?? Trump may Love Putin! Trump Supports Putin!! Trump Praises Putin and rejects any of Putin's wrongdoings. Russia/Putin don't believe in the Holy Bible or Judaism! Why are Republican Christians voting for Trump/Putin? Do the Republican Christians know where Trump goes to Church, how much of the Bible has he read? You all know better than to pull the lever for this LYING, RACIST, HATEFUL MAN!
16 | Becky Rice | 1327367300692852_1327474007348848 | What is the purpose of this dinner or even a roast. Here we are struggling to teach our children to respect others and to not bully yet our leaders continue to take center stage.
17 | Dave Papazoni | 1327367300692852_1327378457358403 | There she is, her husband failed to kill Bin Laden, he was to focused on Monica. Bill Clinton admits he failed, but he leis like Hillary about Monica. The Clintons need tobe railroaded out of our country.
18 | Laurie Lee | 1327367300692852_1327376144025301 | Trump was a bust. Hillary won this one too.
19 | Eldorna Johnson-Flatts | 1327367300692852_1327879650641617 | Trump approaches everything with too much arrogance, bravado and a know it all attitude. Humble thyself Trump, humble thyself.
20 | Ray T. Frazier | 1327367300692852_1327441807352068 | No matter what you planned to do this weekend. Nothing will be more important than watching the documentary " Hillary's America". It's on Netflix or you can buy it at Walmart or other major retailers.
21 | Ruth Honey Villanova Ameiorsano | 1327367300692852_1327381157358133 | JUST AS A SIDE DISH (NO PUN INTENTED) WHAT WAS THE MENU?? AND COST
22 | Doreen Zanni | 1327367300692852_1327381010691481 | Trump stood up for Catholics last night. Hillary still owes Cardinal Dolan and all Catholics an apology for disgusting Podesta e-mails. If this was said against Muslims or Jews there would be an outcry by Hillary, her campaign and her liberal suck up media.
23 | Joyce McCowan Herrell | 1327367300692852_1327472960682286 | TRUMP has made enemies of    GOP, DEMS, OUR ALLIES, WOMEN, CATHOLICS, HISPANICS, ASIAN AMERICANS, BLACKS, JEWS........That leaves RACISTS...and they  will vote for him...AND if PUTIN and KIM JONG-UN could vote, TRUMP would get their vote...
24 | Maria Cabral-Felix | 1327367300692852_1327402327356016 | There was nothing lighthearted about what trump said.
25 | Marion Hatcher | 1327367300692852_1327399910689591 | MSNBC , when will you tell your viewers , about whats in the wiki leaks emails ? the emails proves who the real deplorables are , HILLARY CLINTON , and the dnc . people if you want to see the real truth ., GO TO FOX NEWS , they are the ONLY ones telling what these emails contain , learn , the clinton foundation, has ripped the poor Haitians off for millions, and left them in tents , and so much more

Politicians of all stripes love to blame the media. But Trump has taken anti-media attacks to a new level.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Robert Neff | 1327323827363866_1327339960695586 | Sorry Donsy! Maybe politics just isn't your thing along with Trump University, Trump Steak, Trump Vodka, Trump Airlines, Trump Magazine and failed Casinos along with 4 Bankruptcies and 3 marriages. I'm sure someday you'll find your niche in life but happiness you'll never find.
2 | David Fowler | 1327323827363866_1327346590694923 | The fact is I would just like to listen to the news....like facts....Instead on all networks to one degree or another you have to listen to the reporters or anchors take on it or their opinion. I expect that from shows that are designed for that. However there is no place for this kind of commentary on the Nightly News Formats.
3 | Lauren Starr | 1327323827363866_1327403267355922 | History repeats itself....First order of a dictator is to control what they read and hear.....can't understand why people who wants less government in their lives would be so easily duped into following blindly that they won't educate themselves by reading all news....wanton laziness on part of the voters who need someone to tell them what to do and how to think.....shame on Trump for using fear and scare tactics on his followers.
4 | Robin Jones | 1327323827363866_1327330174029898 | He loved them during the primaries.They gave him millions of dollars in free publicity covering every stupid comment that came out of his mouth. Wouldn't even show the democratic side. Now his words are catching up with him and he hates them for playing them back.
5 | Michael Cooper | 1327323827363866_1327495180680064 | That's what all of you MEDIA gets. You ran behind this guy, and gave him a billion dollars worth of free advertising,  then he turned on you. Now look at you.. lol.. this clown makes a living out of stiffing people. You was not exempted..lol
6 | Donna Kasa | 1327323827363866_1327387137357535 | That is what a narcissist does when he has been ridiculed.  He has gotten too many free passes on his behavior, and now he is a bigger problem.  He threatens the democracy of our great Nation.
7 | Elliot Ono | 1327323827363866_1327400344022881 | This really shows how gullible and stupid,majority of Trump's supporters are.Trump was right,when he said most of his supporters have low education.During the primaries,it was okay when the press enabled Trump,allowed him to get away with his lies and bombastic behavior. Now he's complaining about the press?
8 | Manny Manolo Mondesir | 1327323827363866_1327327994030116 | You've owned your car for four years. You named it Brad. You loved Brad and then you totaled him. You two had been through everything together. Two boyfriends, three jobs, you're like, nothing can replace Brad. Then Liberty Mutual calls and you break into your happy dance.
9 | Cristan Jonas | 1327323827363866_1327582287338020 | There needs to be a frank national discussion about propaganda and its influence in our elections. At one time, the FCC would not have allowed a news network like Fox to call themselves news. Editorials are one thing, and outright lies are another
10 | David Rosales | 1327323827363866_1327948600634722 | The media should just acknowledge its culpability in the rise and legitimacy of Trump's political adventure. Now, the media can fully justify his political demise without remorse. Trump is simply bad for American politics. The media must acknowledge the Trump political saga was about the headlines because the Trump story clearly showed him an inept candidate.
11 | Robert Annan | 1327323827363866_1327448960684686 | At least you guys admit you have been doing him favors for a while. Most media only started looking into him and calling out his bs last month. Before that you covered him like he was God's gift because he was good for ratings. And that's all your corporate backers care about. It's disgusting!
12 | Teasha Marino | 1327323827363866_1327561870673395 | The media does suck in this country. Lie, spin, cut people off pretending to lose feed, brainwash the people who still think the media reports responsibly, keep important stories OUT of sight, keep reporting on the same person over and over to divert the attention of dirty deeds REALLY going on. All theatrics now. Pretty sickening.
13 | David Brod | 1327323827363866_1327541744008741 | The media completely deserves his disdain.  It's been outrageous how blatantly biased the media has been during this campaign.  The entire media complex deserves punishment.  I believe they will get it as millions ands millions of Americans turn away from disgusting liars like MSNBC, NBC, NYT, CBS, CNN , and Washington post.
14 | Marion Wright | 1327323827363866_1327333854029530 | Did you see where one of hillarys staff showed Andrea Mitchell a question to ask hillary right in the middle of a interview on her campaign plane. When the media did 500 minutes on trumps video and 14 minutes on hillarys emails. It's funny how you Bernie liberals were bashing the media before he took his bribe from hillary. I would watch Bernie surporters bash CNN for their bias reporting.
15 | Domanick Smith | 1327323827363866_1327453200684262 | I know that there are people that will deflect and try to push the emails and the video about the violence and fraud under the rug. But I would like to ask if your take away politics and emotions are these things a problem because I see a breach of ethics if everything is true.
16 | Michele Newby | 1327323827363866_1327585194004396 | I remember when it was a free ride and a positive one on Trump. Then he said something nasty about the press/media and they turned on him. They should have been against him in the beginning.
17 | Anna Savage Michael | 1327323827363866_1327345504028365 | Maybe if the media actually reported the news...honestly....and not their tainted opinions of it, he wouldn't be saying what he is.
18 | Bill Craddock | 1327323827363866_1327503107345938 | The American media is a bunch of liars and thieves. One group  of people is outraged by the actions of the media, the other is snickering because they can't imagine the deceitful media will affect them.
19 | Nick Hughes | 1327323827363866_1327564127339836 | Well just look at the non stop trump bashing and lies msnbc cnn and the rest of the corrupt Democrat owned main stream media. How many stories has msnbc run on all of the proof on hillarys corruption and the corrupt Democrat party
20 | Darrin Coomer | 1327323827363866_1327366044026311 | It's a shame that the American people can't rely on a fair and balanced News media for accurate accounts of what's really going on.. Fox News is the only News network worth watching
21 | James Kilroy | 1327323827363866_1327405530689029 | What's Trump got to lose?   Trump is thinking that it's rigged because the Leftwing liberal media is in the pocket of the ruling party like a communist country! by not report the dirt on their Party here's just one example Where was Bill last night? He could of confessed to the Cardinal ~  http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2016/10/17/new_okeefe_video_clinton_campaign_dnc_coordinated_with_organizations_to_beat_up_trump_supporters.html
22 | John Zerdy | 1327323827363866_1327740813988834 | Trump is one tough hombre. He is out there campaigning. He is up against Hill the Pill, Billy, Biden, Caine, Gore,Obama, Mischelle, and the media. You go Donald!
23 | Jose Daniel Vargas Torres | 1327323827363866_1327338857362363 | Trump should have watch his big mouth. Trump's big mouth has gotten him into trouble everytime. Trump is so pathetic that his wife has to get involved. Trump can't do anything for himself
24 | Jack Kybird | 1327323827363866_1327381957358053 | How sad. no matter who wins we all lose. How much depends on who wins. i think in terms of WW3 illerry is more dangerous. all the media, elite and celebrities hate him. Makes him the perfect anti-establishment vote
25 | JW Spiker | 1327323827363866_1327379144025001 | I can honestly say that over the last year and a half I've gone from indifferent to his existence to a burning hatered of a man I've never even seen in person this idiot offends me on every level at almost fifty year's old that's never happend before I can believe so many people are voting for him

Watch all the best lines from Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton at the Al Smith Dinner in New York. Read more: http://nbcnews.to/2dtRF2o
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Colleen Carroll | 1541628142523877_1541659019187456 | The Al Smith Dinner is a fundraiser for Catholic charities that benefit needy children.  It has a long tradition of political humor, where rivals make good-natured jibes at each other and themselves-- they're NOT supposed to use the occasion to attack or take cheap shots.  It's tactless and just bad manners.Trump blew it by not being able to act like a human being for more than 5 minutes, before going off on one of his lying, angry rants.  Total fail, and a total embarrassment.
2 | Krystal Perez | 1541628142523877_1541655035854521 | What a hypocrite. What a sore loser. What an embarrassment and disappointment    [to the country], too.We cannot let a sexist, racist, unknowledgeable, trash-talking, pathetic, inhumane Republican be the face and voice of our country.
3 | Tricia Sturgeon | 1541628142523877_1541643389189019 | Amazing job by Donald Trump's makeup artist. He looked just like Alec Baldwin from SNL! ;)
4 | Christopher Michael | 1541628142523877_1541659779187380 | Man they took out the big ramble by Trump at the end, they were yelling "tell a joke" -- he was just giving a speech, and I thought he was really funny up until that point. The line about Hillary hating the catholics, ugh.
5 | Karry Ann Mykonos | 1541628142523877_1541691889184169 | I am hoping when Mrs Hilary Clinton wins the election she waves to every one and she is wearing the colour purple it is the requiem colour for the dead. The whole run up to the Presidency will be well and truly put to rest and about time too and the right person will be in office. The President And First Lady Mrs Hilary Clinton.
6 | Jose Daniel Vargas Torres | 1541628142523877_1541661012520590 | Trump has always been a disappointment since the day he opened his mouth
7 | Janice Sheehan Maradeo | 1541628142523877_1541730205847004 | That was sad....it usually is such a good time,great fun and humor.But Trump went right into the dumpster... and sad Melania clearly didnt always understand the jokes.IM even more solidly convinces that not only shoud he never see the WH but he should not even be a united states citizen !!!!!!
8 | Carol Corpus | 1541628142523877_1541851099168248 | Hillary got a "smack-down" by the Cardinal at last night's Al Smith dinner -- twice he said we need to sanctify life from womb to natural death -- she's for partial-birth abortion -- killing a baby within minutes of its being born and VITAL.  WOW -- there's a special place.... .
9 | Ranika Prasad | 1541628142523877_1542582165761808 | I have to say Donald trump telling the story about Michelle  Obama's And Melania Trump's same speech. That was funny but true .I think Michelle is who she is and that what people want :)
10 | Kimberley Leung | 1541628142523877_1542447629108595 | Trump is so low, he didn't deserve to speak at the Al Smith Dinner but well he's a candidate of Republican Party for our presidential election. What a joke still
11 | Alejandro Padilla Jasso | 1541628142523877_1541853102501381 | #thiselectionisafarce Fíjense bien America... el 1% reunidos, los "ultra rich" juntos, como una familia feliz. Despierta America. Estos dos estan coludididos con los que en verdad tienen el poder. Se están riendo de nosotros. Se están riendo del Pueblo de los USA. Todo es una farsa!!
12 | Nighat Hassan | 1541628142523877_1541663769186981 | The first two statements out of this mouth were actually complete sentences with project structure including nouns, adjectives, verbs, pronouns, adverbs, etc, and in decent form with a jiggle.  That did not last long.  With little self-effacing we were off sliding down the rabbit hole much quicker that the posted spped limit! They might even cancel the dinner next time!
13 | Adam Modelski | 1541628142523877_1541972269156131 | The best joke was about Melania's speech and I liked how she laughed and stood up to be recognized and Trump said it wasn't her fault.  That's the most class I ever saw Trump show and it elevated his wife in my eyes.
14 | Richard S. Simon | 1541628142523877_1541826659170692 | The only time the pig-man was self deprecating was when he tried to joke about his wife and Michelle's speech. He could not even bring himself to make a joke about himself, even though the sight of him is a joke to the American people.
15 | Armando Muñoz | 1541628142523877_1541647459188612 | He was cringe worthy and he was completely uncomfortable to watch.
16 | Mana Olana | 1541628142523877_1541675779185780 | One thousand millionaires in attendance, and only $6 million collected. Is that because the attendees know the corruption of the institution sponsoring the event?
17 | Janice Lyerla-Goodger | 1541628142523877_1541833509170007 | Hillary was trying to make the point that the party and America has grown away from that kind of discrimination!  And we should all learn lessons from the past.  Both parties have evolved from those times.
18 | Marylee D. Gilchrist | 1541628142523877_1541869265833098 | Donald has some funnies at the beginning, not about himself, though, good laugh at his wife's expense. Then he went off the deep end. Seems to have a max of 20 minutes of sanity.
19 | Shirley Heath | 1541628142523877_1542021875817837 | Just a side note....who is that woman, sitting behind Hillary, and showing off her enormous boobs and loving every minute of it😟?  Do you suppose she signed autographs afterward😝
20 | Hal Miller | 1541628142523877_1542557749097583 | I will give Trump a few points for telling the story about Michelle  Obama's and Melania Trump's "exact same speech." That was classic, gutty, and funny!
21 | Shane VerPlanck | 1541628142523877_1541969892489702 | The jokes are supposed to be mostly self-deprecating but Trump is totally incapable of that and the only good joke he told was on his wife!  Typical of that twit!
22 | Bill Upshur | 1541628142523877_1541816719171686 | I I find it odd-- Trump can make the transition from the primaries to the general election. The man is still holding   ( pep rallies) at a charity dinner- 18 days out from voting-- pitiful & pathetic!
23 | Betsy Loth | 1541628142523877_1542515402435151 | Trump's best joke, about Melania plagiarizing Michelle's speech, was plagiarized from a cartoon that was published after the Republican convention.
24 | Peter M. Sommer | 1541628142523877_1541782312508460 | Donald Trump was "Boo'd" at a Catholic Charity Event where No One "Boo's". Trump was Nasty and for the most part, Not Funny. His Only Good Line was at his Wife's expense... Well of course it was...
25 | Bridget Moran McCready | 1541628142523877_1541818812504810 | Who thought this was a good Idea to have Trump speak. WRONG WRONG WRONG even the priest and the Cardinals were sweating it out :(

Here is that amazing clip of former Supreme Court Justice David Souter being frighteningly prescient about the decline of civic knowledge in America and the effect of that decline on the state of our democracy.

Watch the full segment that contained the clip: http://on.msnbc.com/2dEJrrz
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | John Adams | 10154018020054067_10154018093484067 | This man is describing what happened in Germany in the 1930s, when Hitler came to power. He is also describing what's happening today, in 2016, with the Republican party and Donald Trump.
2 | Marissa N. Ibáñez | 10154018020054067_10154018227829067 | As an immigrant I'm required to pass a civics exam to prove I'm worthy of citizenship that most native born Americans would fail. This is why Trump thinks that as senator HRC alone could pass a bill.
3 | Sabine de Weijer | 10154018020054067_10154018421454067 | He is talking abut about the ignorant masses who will believe anybody that promises them they" will fix " ," make America great again " , make them believe their misery is the fault of this group or that group. That worked with Hitler, Mao, Pol Pot , Stalin and look , it works with Trump. He has NO plan, clearly cannot even manage a successful business, uses vulnerable people for his own gain and yet He is running for president. The level of ignorance and willingness of people to blindly believe those promises is baffling.
4 | Candice Wagner | 10154018020054067_10154018084659067 | Agree CIVICs is not taught much in school anymore. And new voters are quite ignorant of the way the government is supposed to work. If they understood they wouldn't be so apathetic and might apply themselves in the process. Frankly they are spoiled rotton brats with delusions of entitlement!
5 | Shannon Page Champion | 10154018020054067_10154018138389067 | Scarily prescient! Beyond Civics classes in school, how do we stop the rampant spread of conspiracy theories? It's so much easier to blame some "black" forces than to actually read, study, discuss, and respect other opinions.
6 | Michael Sexton | 10154018020054067_10154018142739067 | If you expect someone at a school to teach your children everything then your thinking is outdated and you should be ashamed of yourself.
7 | Sherri Everhart Hedrick | 10154018020054067_10154018423479067 | You are talking about a large percentage of Hillary supporters and she counts on this lack of knowledge to get her elected.
8 | Andrew Riley | 10154018020054067_10154018266254067 | Who he is talking about is Barack Obama. See that's reality. The average trump supporter will hear that, not that they would or will hear it, and say it's already happened. A black, muslim, Kenyan has already wrested(they'd say tooken) control of America and now's the time to fight back. Reflective and sober thought has all but disappeared and not just from Republicans but from all peoples in the civic square. Mostly because dialogue has been replaced with filibuster as the chief method of communication not just in politics but everywhere.
9 | Cueto Jon | 10154018020054067_10154018868364067 | Trump supporters celebrate this ignorance as if its a good thing, they celebrate it as if its means being an "outsider", they celebrate it as if it means they are rebelling against a system...when in actuality they are simply doing the job of a foreign invader...destroying our democracy from within...but make no mistake, there are plenty of us who are intelligent enough to realize just how stupid and dangerous the idea of Trump being president really is and we, the people, will preserve our democracy on 11/8.
10 | Ann Walker | 10154018020054067_10154018954744067 | We need to bring back teaching Civics and Citizenship classes.  I'm so glad I had to take them way back when because it taught me to think critically and look at issues critically before making a decision on how to vote.  Yes, Justice Souter is describing Hitler and Nazi Germany.  So beware!!
11 | Marilyn Gabbard | 10154018020054067_10154018257479067 | One thing I haven't actually heard the candidates say much about is how the supreme court is supposed to be a seperate entity.....according to our constitution.  It has been politicized and that bothers me......don't know how to change that but I wish the Senate would allow the confirmation process to start now... That would be the consitutional thing to do.
12 | Mana Olana | 10154018020054067_10154018693244067 | The Dems have been running education in large cities for at least a half century. Do you really think they want the truth about the DNC taught? Only the liberal agenda and mindset allowed these days.
13 | Doug Pauly | 10154018020054067_10154018122659067 | It's an abomination that a hack and flack like Maddow would whine about this. THIS is the desired result from HER DemoNuts,. THEY have been pecking away at the education system in this country for decades now. Stupidity and ignorance serves their agenda, and they openly brag about that. We now have way too many bonafide idiots (ahem) 'teaching' at all levels of education, and that alone ensures that idiots will be the result. Revisionist history, 'safe spaces', the open assault on anyone who dares to not share the leftist dogma, what else could anyone possibly EXPECT to be the end product of all that? Throw in the refusal to allow mostly black children in the poorest of neighborhoods to have a shot at a quality education via vouchers and this will remain the norm going forward. And as I said, it was all planned.
14 | Cheryl Evans | 10154018020054067_10154019130809067 | Yesterday I found myself in the company of two trump supporters. Both educated men, the first had no talking points to support his stance. All he could say is that he wanted "change". He stumbled when I explained what some of those changes would likely look like in a trump presidency. The other, older man admitted he has no knowledge of Trumps history but thought he was a successful businessman. Neither had bothered to study the issues, read the candidates positions nor watch the debates.
15 | Nivea Wiltz-jenkins | 10154018020054067_10154018189804067 | The Republicans needs to do their jobs and at least take a vote on the justice recommended by the President, as has been done for years! When they were elected to office, there was no contingency basis. They have jobs to do. Not just jobs in their favor! If others in America don't do their jobs, they're fired!!! I say that we put a stop to the obstructionism! There is no clause that says you can do your jobs if!!!  #votethemout. #votestraightblueticket
16 | Mindy Moore | 10154018020054067_10154019235969067 | Justice Souter showed himself to be remarkably accurate about the possible danger to our democracy. Everyone should be required to watch this video and think about what he said. Could there be a better description of someone like Trump? He was spot on! A man who says he can fix it all if only we will give him the power! Just like Hitler in 1930's Germany! Trump fits Souter's description perfectly! The worst part is that so many Americans believe this dangerous man! Shame on the Trump supporters! Blind fools who want easy answers and lies from someone who would be dictator!
17 | William Lane | 10154018020054067_10154019205964067 | Justice Souter couldn't be more correct about the chance for the decline of our republic. This is what Trump and his supporters preach. A strong man will make all your problems go away. This is what every dictator promises which is a preclude to the death of freedom and the ruin of a nation.
18 | Pat M. Germelman | 10154018020054067_10154018728084067 | Saw this last night and I'm awestruck by this man. Oh to turn back the clock...would the GOP do anything differently? Given the cast of characters we've had in place since these prophetic words were spoken, probably not. And that's the saddest thing of all. The tone deafness of the GOP has been a slow build, brick by brick. We're dumbfounded that Trump can do and say literally anything and his followers remain. It's kind of the same for the GOP in reverse. Trump can say and do anything, and I suspect when this debacle if over they'll go right back to business as usual. I'm going to quote Donald here: "SAD!"
19 | Rob Haas | 10154018020054067_10154018414659067 | Simply amazing thought of the future of politics in this country. Watch now how the republicans and Trump supporters try somehow to spin this into some kind of democratic ploy to hurt Trump. It's a simple statement about democracy and if we're not careful who we allow to spin hate and fear we can lose what this country truly stands for.
20 | William Hamma | 10154018020054067_10154018750629067 | Souter limits his remarks to civic ignorance because he probably can't allow  himself to fully comprehend the extent of the reverse evolution that is taking place  It is to frighting..It is not an accident that so many Americans are stupid, and have the critical thinking power of a brain damaged chimpanzee. This is by design of the corporations to reduce peoples thinking ability in order to exploit them.  Most TV sitcoms are about people doing nothing but jumping around and insulting each other, with a lot of canned laughter. A popular TV show is about staged accidents people falling off roofs and getting hit in there groins by various objects. Another show where the idea is to see who was the father among several candidates. This show features shots of the audience which is really scary. I don't think anyone on this show are modern humans or even Neanderthals, but some sub human species not yet named.  Then there is the cult of celebrity worship about the endless parade of human garbage who's claim to fame is getting out of rehab, fathering or getting impregnated by another worthless piece of trash or being on some reality show.  Pop music seems to me to be pounding drums with someone shouting about one thing or another.  All this leads to people buying any crap that is put in front of them because they are unable to think, and believe most anything put in front of them.
21 | Mitch Feintuch | 10154018020054067_10154018566289067 | Ignorance is definitely the danger that Justice Souter justifiably fears. Hence the propaganda and selective narrative that those like MSNBC impose is a great danger that only furthers that ignorance.
22 | Bob Greene | 10154018020054067_10154018416214067 | Trump is the reincarnation of Ceasar Augustus. Those that support him are what I call lazy citizens. Let Trump have all the power and take care of my problems. That's not how a Democratic Republic operates. We must as citizens always be vigilant and be part of the solution. Stay strong and work our problems out as we should.
23 | Michael Sexton | 10154018020054067_10154018137599067 | Computer= access to information. Local and national news from countries all over the world. Law and examples. Watchdogs. Public access to criminal records. Senate and House website access. Facebook and Twitter comments. In the information age ignorance is a choice. Education of the basics can be taught at home with tutorials free of judgment and repeated as many times as necessary. Master chef, architect and scientist offering information for the cost of internet. Free internet at most public libraries. Want to learn how to build something? Watch a YouTube video. Watch the video 100 times. Want to learn an instrument? Want to learn basics of psychology? Is your math class moving along to slow and boring you? Prison of perception is the only excuse. Parents unaware of the vast amount of information or unwilling to plug their children into it.
24 | Eddie Girardi | 10154018020054067_10154018613334067 | Hiliary is about to get total power and it scares the crap out of me. She already is above the law, when she picks the law makers and controls the Senate we no longer have checks and balances
25 | Sergio Lorenz | 10154018020054067_714817565338298 | What is more important, a conservative Supreme Court or a United State for Americans? Are you willing to trade one for the other? It appears that politicians like those republicans are. For in the end, The People are more important!
