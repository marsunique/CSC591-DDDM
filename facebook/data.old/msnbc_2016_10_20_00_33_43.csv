The third and final presidential debate lived up to its billing. Both candidates fielded an array of personal and policy questions and answered them...with varying degrees of accuracy.

We fact-checked the claims made during Wednesday's debate. Here is what we found.

--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Cathy Siler | 1325859114177004_1325863887509860 | Donald Trump knows there is more coming out on the rigged election through Wiki Leaks this week; that is why he said he will not accept result of the election. Donald’s always one step ahead of the media. Just wait you will see.
2 | Connie Plaisance Sarvis | 1325859114177004_1325867164176199 | So glad he didn't concede,He blew them away!!! Its gonna be headlines, knows how to shake the media <3Wikileaks is proof of corruption and voter fraud on video shows the DNC has been cheating for no telling how many years. (probably 8) dead people are voting, so until something is done... I don't blame him one bit! He's brilliant for the warning if it continues #WOMENFORTRUMP
3 | Sherri Gardner Crandall | 1325859114177004_1325875467508702 | It's So disturbing to watch the news media cbs, abc, CNN  who are supposedly unbiased, to be so one sided!! I'm not a trump or Clinton supporter and undecided at this point but it's blatantly obvious they are democratic supporters! I don't believe that the American people can possibly be given an unbiased point of view from any news organization at this point
4 | Inge Mueller Morse | 1325859114177004_1325878820841700 | Did anyone notice after the debate Melania came up to him but there were no hugs or kisses exchanged. He shook the boys hands and did air kisses, and kissed Tiffany. I didn't see Ivanka kiss him either. As he was leaving the stage, he took Melania's hand they walked maybe 2 steps and the hand holding was over. Looks like trouble in Trumpland. Look out world.. Mrs Trump 4 is not far away.
5 | Constance A Marshall | 1325859114177004_1325865997509649 | C'mon MSNBC I'm sure it would be much easier fact check if you have an option that says, Trump lied, dodged, and made up his own facts"
6 | Tammy Shelton Eskola | 1325859114177004_1325870340842548 | Hillary told multiple lies MSNBC.....why are you not a balanced news organization? No integrity.I feel like we're in a communist country where we are only fed what the elites want us to see. Wake up America.
7 | Jean A Chaffee | 1325859114177004_1325875744175341 | Donald trump won debate take your shitten polls to the street cafes shopping malls where people are and ask them that should be the poll I never got contacted for one of your polls who do you call ..take your pool to the street be fair and unbias and do it right. we the people are running to the trump train by groves..
8 | Angie Bellows | 1325859114177004_1325860594176856 | Americans are either taken for FOOLS or are actually FOOLS if they don't wake up against this CORRUPT SYSTEM! We have to take our country back from those who lie and profit – while all the hard-working Americans suffer! NO MORE! A vote for Trump is a vote for hope again!  It’s now or never.This election is about whether you prefer globalism or Americanism!  I say AMERICA FIRST!
9 | Carol Koziol | 1325859114177004_1325878190841763 | Hey, MSNBC...can you fact check when Killery will have "the big one" on stage? So hoping she has a major grand mal seizure in front of the world. The earth may turn a bit on its access from so many people stomping and cheering!!!
10 | Danny Smoot | 1325859114177004_1325862830843299 | Hillary thinks it should be legal to abort a child because it has brown eyes or is Mulatto in the 9th month. She is a MONSTER. #NEVERHILLARY
11 | Joyce Mancini | 1325859114177004_1325863814176534 | HA F'ers the election didn'f happen yet so unless you know it's fixed stop telling people HILLARY IS president so It must be fixed and you are confirming it
12 | Lana Mary | 1325859114177004_1325872100842372 | That's crazy trump lied about everything AGAIN ( heavy sarcasm)
13 | Ryan Stahl | 1325859114177004_1325875540842028 | How bout her claim the 6 billion missing from the state department had been debunked!? False it has never been solved!!!
14 | Patrick Simmons | 1325859114177004_1325862770843305 | Gonna do any fact checking on the other candidate? Or is Clinton immune to that too?
15 | Scott Rodriguez | 1325859114177004_1325878510841731 | Trump has successfully shattered the cozy connection between liberal media and the DNC.
16 | Rex Blake | 1325859114177004_1325878487508400 | Brian williams proved his inability to report the truth to the american people when he proclaimed he was on a helicopter with our militarily men in the line of duty and was kicked off nightly news.
17 | Nick Kokotovich | 1325859114177004_1325869730842609 | What about fact checking Hillary campaign paying to start riots a Trump rallies?
18 | Ryan Stallins | 1325859114177004_1325867094176206 | The system/ government has failed americans. Its time for the military to take control of the white house. We need a complete change.
19 | Laboy Efrain | 1325859114177004_1325876607508588 | The Bully has spoken! Poor substance! Weak Leader! Sore loser! Should of resigned and let Pence take over!
20 | Brett Losey | 1325859114177004_1325870844175831 | Trump wins! People around the world are waking up and revolting to the global agenda and radical Muslim invasion. Clinton is the most corrupt presidential candidate in living memory. Not to mention she bullied and insulted her husband's alleged rape and sexual assault victims. Obamacare is set to implode in 2017. So if you're a complete idiot then go and vote for Clinton and your godless agenda. You can put Clinton and Kaine in their own basket of deplorable's. 90% of DEMOCRATS, are burning flags, shooting cops, sitting down during the national anthem, rioting, and blocking traffic, not to mention the architects of the affordable care act that is due to implode in 2017, adding 10 trillion to the deficit, lest we forget giving the Iranians 1.3 billion dollars in cash in one of the worst deals in recorded history....But Republicans are the problem. All the media wants to cover is that Trump made some locker room banter 11 years ago. GO FIGURE!Trump
21 | Rajan Rajiv | 1325859114177004_1325872264175689 | CNN having the plagiarist and Muslim Fareed Zachariah on the forefront in guiding the election program will never accept the defeat of Hillary. Worldwide opinion, including Indian viewers, is that Trump has won. He called Hillary, ' a nasty woman, and refused to accept the imaginary election result of his enemies, thereby giving the hint he will win. , 52% CNN staff would have voted for Hillary, but 80% of independent viewers have voted for Trump.
22 | Riley Litchfield | 1325859114177004_1325871320842450 | Why do I only see you fact checking Trump? Maybe I'm missing it, but I don't see Hillary's face any of these pictures.
23 | Cesar Chavez | 1325859114177004_1325875010842081 | Turning to MSNBC after the debate is like watching The View whilst chunking feed at group of hens.
24 | Kirk Powers | 1325859114177004_1325868050842777 | #HillaryClinton : We must protect the toddlers from being killed with guns and even killing others with guns.#HillaryClinton: I am pro murdering babies in the womb. They have no right to live.
25 | Mike Middleton | 1325859114177004_1325863810843201 | and here come the trump morons

--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Aaron Thiel | 1325857497510499_1325859387510310 | Hillary turned into a stuttering mess that couldn't control the volume of her voice. Could you imagine her negotiating with a hostile Putin with WWIII hanging in the balance? Hillary is in over her head and she knows it. This isn't the peaceful world her husband seen during his presidency and it scares the crap out of her.
2 | Angie Bellows | 1325857497510499_1325860800843502 | Americans are either taken for FOOLS or are actually FOOLS if they don't wake up against this CORRUPT SYSTEM!

3 | Dianna Marie | 1325857497510499_1325857944177121 | BOOM! Trump was excellent, confident & won the debate from the minute he spoke. best debate preformance he's had
4 | Gary Gersin Jr. | 1325857497510499_1325858110843771 | best moment of the night..its not just hillary its all democrat candidates https://youtu.be/2AMZkDM2SpY
5 | Regal Muyende Kennedy-Nicholous Mutyaba | 1325857497510499_1325874410842141 | You guys sound so biased. Where is media independency in these elections
6 | Doyes Peterson | 1325857497510499_1325875350842047 | Here is a video that sarted 100's of years ago about certain groups of prople like the democrats and more that have been plotting for century's to Globalize and to create a New World Order .The Muslim Brotherhood drew up a huge plan almost 30 years ago that has been documented to take over the US in 30 years . This video whether fact or fiction fits what the big picture seems to be heading in real life . It's long but Watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HL6v8nzFiUk
7 | Mick Dobie | 1325857497510499_1325872130842369 | Media's ability to swing an election will be judged in this election, God knows they tried
8 | Hayley Johnson | 1325857497510499_1325870280842554 | The media and political establishment is rigged against him. If you can’t see that you are blind and out of touch. If no one wants him to be President then why was their a RECORD turnout in the Republican primaries? He made history with +14 million votes, the most votes a Republican candidate has received in history. 31 million people turned out to vote in the Republican Primaries, and 30 million turned out to vote in the Democrat Primaries. 12,210,217 MORE people voted in the Republican Primary, and that’s because of Donald Trump. And 5,323,809 LESS people voted in the Democrat Primary. Hillary won 27 states in the Democrat Primary and Donald Trump won 36 in the Republican Primary. This election has become more than Democrat vs Republican. This election is about US (the people) vs the Government/Political Establishment of Washington D.C. Hillary Clinton is part of the establishment and think about it. Ronald Reagan famously said “Government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem.” So why is it Republicans and Democrats can barely agree on policy but suddenly they can all agree that Donald Trump can't be the next President? Simple. They don't want to loose their power. Look at what is happening to the Republican Party. IT'S CHANGING! Donald Trump is challenging them and if he's elected that's what he will do to Washington. This election is the most important election in our nation's history and let me tell you why. Our Government has become corrupt, our politicians DO NOT have our best interest as their priority and we are on the path towards Socialism. Not only that but over the last 8 years Barack Obama has completely and utterly DESTROYED our place on the national stage. We are on the verge of a WWIII and its time we as a nation stand up and say to Washington "We are done with this nonsense. We are done with politicians that only care about power. We don't care what the media says and will not let them fear monger us into NOT voting for Trump.
9 | Hayley Johnson | 1325857497510499_1325870170842565 | The Clinton administration is one of the main reasons we face the problems we have today and also during the Bush administration because of their policies in the 90s the disrupted the Regan/Bush policies in the 80s. All of her international endorsements are from Socialists! She talks about women's rights "blah blah blah" but she takes money and supports Government's like Saudi Arabia and Syria that kill and demean women! I go around the world and fight for women's rights. That women sits on her butt and watches her own people die and then continues to this day to lie about it and cover it up! Clinton was a Republican before she met Bill. But yet she attacks Donald Trump for previously being a Democrat? The woman was against gay marriage and is all of a sudden now for it. She voted for the Iraq War and said that voting for it was "a vote that says to Suddam Hussein, disarm or be disarmed". And now she says Iraq was a mistake and all Bush's fault, and he's a war criminal. Bill Clinton and Al Gore were the ones who started the whole WMD's thing in the 90s! But somehow the media and Clinton campaign say Trump is not trustworthy and inconsistent and flip-flops? lol I think it goes to show how the Government is scared that someone who is NOT a politician may very well be in the Oval Office on January 20th. And people are stupid if they don't see that. The last time we had a President who was NOT a politician was Eisenhower in the 50s.
10 | Barbara Andrae | 1325857497510499_1325868790842703 | No shortage of idiot trolls. No education, foxbots, lots of sports team logos, no books, trump fans, girly pictures, and idiocy.
11 | Selena Hancock | 1325857497510499_1325870984175817 | Why is it about Trump and not Hillary? Trump was right about the media. Your corrupt.
12 | Danny Smoot | 1325857497510499_1325864340843148 | Hillary started nodding like crazy. Think the Parkinson's showed it's ugly head.
13 | Laboy Efrain | 1325857497510499_1325871467509102 | The Bully has spoken! Poor substance! Weak Leader! Sore loser! Should of resigned and let Pence take over!
14 | Brett Losey | 1325857497510499_1325871040842478 | Trump wins! People around the world are waking up and revolting to the global agenda and radical Muslim invasion.

Donald J. Trump refused to say if he will accept the results of the presidential election. Trump surrogates Rudy Giuliani and Kellyanne Conway stood by Trump's "bizarre" debate comment in the Spin room.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Michael L Friend | 1325850677511181_1325851424177773 | Poor Donald, he's having to face the real possibility of losing to a woman on Nov. 8 (a Clinton, no less) and having to admit he has lost something major, for the first time probably in his life, and can't get up the words (or the testicular fortitude) to say he can't concede should he lose election night. He and his family and lackeys keep trotting out that "rigged election" garbage, hoping it will stick.
2 | Nathan Iveland | 1325850677511181_1325851327511116 | "Fascism did not rise in the thirties because it was strong, but because democracy was weak." Our sworn inheritance of a democratic system, which is guaranteed by our elections, is under attack by Donald Trump and his fascistic, empty and insupportable rhetoric of "rigged" elections. Every republican politician supporting snifflegrabapuss should be ashamed of themselves and disqualified as an elected representative of the people.
3 | Sean Lintner | 1325850677511181_1325859070843675 | I would just like to put my opinion in. I find it disrespectful that he wants to say just because things aren't working in his favor that the election is rigged. I live in Fort Myers Florida. I chose to be a poll worker this year for the first time I'm 45 years old. I worked in the primary election. And I was asked to come back for the general election. We knew this was going to be a contentious fight. But I can assure you that everything that I was trained on in Lee County it is not rigged. And I find it appalling did he could take it the easy way out to accuse people good hard-working people of that it's disrespectful to the American public who volunteer their time not to mention Every County in the  United States.
4 | Constance A Marshall | 1325850677511181_1325857797510469 | This is a travesty and anyone, I do mean anyone, still supporting this unhinged man for POTUS is too toxic for American values! A must have for election success, its called "Trump Speaks & Tweets", the gift that keeps on giving!
5 | Krystal J. Miranda | 1325850677511181_1325856860843896 | Recall that Hillary Clinton did her college thesis on his writings and Barack Hussein Obama writes about him in his books.How to create a social state by Saul Alinsky:There are 8 levels of control that must be obtained before you are able to create a social state.The first is the most important.1) Healthcare — Control healthcare and you control the people2) Poverty — Increase the Poverty level as high as possible, poor people are easier to control and will not fight back if you are providing everything for them to live.3) Debt — Increase the debt to an unsustainable level. That way you are able to increase taxes, and this will produce more poverty.4) Gun Control — Remove the ability to defend themselves from the Government. That way you are able to create a police state.5) Welfare — Take control of every aspect of their lives (Food, Housing, and Income).6) Education — Take control of what people read and listen to — take control of what children learn in school.7) Religion — Remove the belief in the God from the Government and schools.8) Class Warfare — Divide the people into the wealthy and the poor. This will cause more discontent and it will be easier to take (Tax) the wealthy with the support of the poor.Now, think ...Does any of this sound like what is happening to the United States? The difference is Trump Loves America and Hillary let men die, Voters Remember Benghazi Never Hillary
6 | Jessica Madrid-Bautista | 1325850677511181_1325859430843639 | Kelly Anne looks like she's been hit by a truck.  Your knee is bleeding, your hair is a wreck, & you look like your under the influence of something.  You're delusional, sweetie.
7 | Charla Ellis | 1325850677511181_1325866004176315 | MEDIA! Do not be intimidated by Trump's statement that YOU guys are biased and Pence saying he was sure the MEDIA would be more fair from now on to the end of the election????!!!!  If there was any rigging,it was the fact that TRUMP was covered  constantly through "free" media interviews which clearly helped him become the candidate.... You guys could even remind him of that. Keep in the open his outrageous refusal and his calling people to be vigilant.
8 | Mark Guetzka | 1325850677511181_1325858660843716 | MSNBCs post debate discussion on whether Trump will accept losing the  election sounds like a bunch of sniveling kids. Is that the best you can come up with? Just proves what Trump claims is true. The media is biased.
9 | Deborah Heckbert Lima | 1325850677511181_1325862034176712 | About The Rigged election , hats off to Marco Rubio. But is it a little too late.More Republicans have to come out and say this election is not rigged. Every single time this man gets put down every single time he acts like a child and says childish things. He then comes out and blames everything on everybody else. Including his victims. You don't need to be a rocket scientist to realize what this man is doing. This is going to be a landslide for the Democrats I have predicted this since day one and it will go down ballot this man is done at least for this election. I could see changes that we need but it needs to be somebody else this man is off the charts it's not normal and no matter how they try and make it seem normal it is not normal, it's only a diversion off of issues like his taxes and sexual assaults
10 | Aaron Davison | 1325850677511181_1325872214175694 | You people are brain dead ! The DNC has been caught twice this year with voter interference. Why would anyone believe they are done being bad actors ? They are falling into the same corrupt ways as the Clinton's and you all lap up this crap media outlook. Something has to be changed to prevent either parties from doing the things the DNC has done during the Clinton campaign.
11 | Christie Rowland Fowler | 1325850677511181_1325858580843724 | Are his supporters are being duped....is he's crashing and burning on purpose? Seems he's doesn't care one way or another, it's about attention to his name, in the end he will profit. Maybe that's the real rigging. He himself is rigging it to lose.
12 | Cathy Siler | 1325850677511181_1325863317509917 | Donald Trump knows there is more coming out on the rigged election through Wiki Leaks this week; that is why he said he will not accept result of the election. Donald’s always one step ahead of the media. Just wait you will see.
13 | Krystal J. Miranda | 1325850677511181_1325855477510701 | I love the Donald J. Trump did not lie to the American people , yes or no you dummies , hello , it would be real easy for Hillary to lie but obviously trump declined to answer likely becuz in the moment he could honestly say yes or no . I'm sorry but you spinners are why we all are laughing at you
14 | Gisela Rodriguez | 1325850677511181_1325857720843810 | I almost feel sorry them..an Kellyane should be ashamed of her selves. The only thing rigged is Donald in pathetic mind. Trump and his camp all They believe they won the debate.
15 | Barry Rucker | 1325850677511181_1325877600841822 | I guess I am a bad democrat. I heald the same job for 34 years, I have 20 years of military service, I have 2 college degrees, and I think for myself. My job of 34 years is now in Mexico thanks to Bill Clinton and  NAFTA.
16 | Krystal J. Miranda | 1325850677511181_1325856577510591 | Wow Donald trump did not lie and bypass this questions , omg shoot him he didn't lie to the American people , it would have helped him to lie but he didn't . I love this
17 | Kathi Harrington- Hoops | 1325850677511181_1325857934177122 | Conway better run she looks 30 years older  then she did when she started  working for him. She flip flops about as much as he does .
18 | Joe Cowart | 1325850677511181_1325867654176150 | This was a great night for Trump. You people that support the most dishonest and corrupt person in the history of politics are going to be very disappointed come November 8th
19 | Jacob S. Moore | 1325850677511181_1325871227509126 | Why is everyone bashing Trump for his refusal to acknowledge or accept the results of he loses. Y'all didn't have a problem with Al Gore contesting the outcome in 2000?
20 | Ann Chryssikos McBroom | 1325850677511181_1325855080844074 | shouldn't someone explain to Trump ( and his campaign) that it is not Media Bias when they have heard you 'muse' and you sound like an idiot...a moron......IT WAS MEDIA bias a YEAR ago when you rode down that escalator and the MEDIA gave YOU TWO BILLION dollars worth of FREE advertising during the Republican Primary season...what the HELL did you HAVE on those 16 Republicans?
21 | Donna Tolbert | 1325850677511181_1325866304176285 | Hillary is a career politician... bought and paid for! Trump loves America, no one can buy him! He is bringing all the corruption to light!  If he doesn't become president that's ok he gave it is all .He woke up America to the corruption going on. Now It's all out in the open now we can all make do with whatever we want with it. He has my vote.
22 | Carol Andersen | 1325850677511181_1325877960841786 | Once again, Trump demonstrates he runs  his campaign as a reality show. When I think he can't be anymore outrageous, he opens his mouth and once again.... he shocks me!
23 | Steve Burch | 1325850677511181_1325872657508983 | Why don't Democrats talk about the 4 dead Americans, everything is in black and white ,emails tapes Hillary  is nothing but corruption, So can any good Dem tell me why anyone would support bringing Muslims to this great country to rape and plunder .Asm this question for months no answers

5 | Jake Flowers | 1325850367511212_1325851344177781 | Trump claims he doesn't know Putin yet his daughter vacations with Putin's girlfriend regularly. Riiiiight, Donald...
6 | Doug Burris | 1325850367511212_1325854277510821 | When you are bought and paid for by Wall Street banks and foreign governments, you are likely the puppet.

8 | Dianna Marie | 1325850367511212_1325858294177086 | BOOM! Trump was excellent, confident & won the debate from the minute he spoke. best debate preformance he's had
9 | Joe Cowart | 1325850367511212_1325868240842758 | Hillary Clinton is the puppet and Wall Street pulls the strings
10 | Jeannette Boe | 1325850367511212_1325878254175090 | Trump once again defended Putin when it came to hacking. I do believe Trump owes the Russian oligarchs money. I believe he is indent to them.
11 | Joanne Matthew | 1325850367511212_1325871704175745 | Why does the media let Trump get away with saying he doesn't know Putin, when it's on tape that he does?
12 | J Thomas Gaffney | 1325850367511212_1325862577509991 | Hillary is a puppet of the Neocon think tanks, the war armaments industry and Wall Street.
13 | Liliana Gonzales | 1325850367511212_1325860134176902 | Donald Trump would not say during the debate that he would accept the election results. This refusal by Trump to agree to accept the outcome of the election is a direct attack on our democracy. His refusal is treason. He is not in any way qualified to be President of our United States. He is a loser and he is a slap in the face to the American people and to our democracy and should be treated as such. Every GOP leader who ENABLES him, every COMMENTATOR who paves the way for him, every VOTER who votes for him is complicit in damaging AMERICA. His insistence that he does "not know" Russias Vladmir Putin only makes me believe he has conspired with Russians who have engaged in ESPIONAGE! ☠️😡👎🏼💩 #NeverTrumpShitStorm

OR... TRUMP
15 | Top Dollar Investment Group | 1325850367511212_1325851697511079 | Now we are discussing dead people voting in the election. According to Republican Surrogates dead people vote democratic which is a reason the election is rigged and why Trump won't accept the election outcome. Maybe the dead republicans met Jesus which according to my Republican friends is a liberal and all decided to vote democratic.  Now! If you see any dead people at the polls please inform me because I won't ne there....
16 | Ssenabulya Dan | 1325850367511212_1325857844177131 | We all know it would be Trump. That's why Putin and Wikileaks ate working hard to help him win. Won't happen!

"I will look at it at the time. I'm not looking at anything now," Donald J. Trump  said during the final presidential debate.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Lisa Borrelli Regal | 1325845924178323_1325847054178210 | A presidential nominee for the United States of America that Openly supports Putin and says he will Not accept the democratic process of the elections... Let that sink in
2 | Jamie Lawenda | 1325845924178323_1325847610844821 | that is just unacceptable.the premise of democracy is that it is the will of the people who is elected president -itsnot up to donald trump to decide if he accepts that. Its the way our government  works.
3 | Brian Carter | 1325845924178323_1325855494177366 | Only a disgraceful candidate like Trump can interrupt his opponent to call her a "nasty woman" and have that be the SECOND most insane thing he said at the debate! He's a complete embarrassment to this country and the republican leadership should not only disavow him tomorrow but apologize for nominating a egotistical, insecure, rascist, sexual predator!
4 | Deb Gee | 1325845924178323_1325848757511373 | He looked like Satan tonight. Tired, mean, bitter. In comparison to Hillary, oh dear the split screen really magnified the difference between the souls of these two.
5 | Thomas Fraley | 1325845924178323_1325851197511129 | Remember Al Gore??Took his loss to Bush all the way to the Supreme Court before he accepted defeat. ..but it's ok for a liberal to do it i guess...Gore conceded then took it back and fought all the way to the Supreme Court...but Trumps a bad guy for saying "we'll see on November 8th??...
6 | Krystal J. Miranda | 1325845924178323_1325859234176992 | Recall that Hillary Clinton did her college thesis on his writings and Barack Hussein Obama writes about him in his books.How to create a social state by Saul Alinsky:There are 8 levels of control that must be obtained before you are able to create a social state.The first is the most important.1) Healthcare — Control healthcare and you control the people2) Poverty — Increase the Poverty level as high as possible, poor people are easier to control and will not fight back if you are providing everything for them to live.3) Debt — Increase the debt to an unsustainable level. That way you are able to increase taxes, and this will produce more poverty.4) Gun Control — Remove the ability to defend themselves from the Government. That way you are able to create a police state.5) Welfare — Take control of every aspect of their lives (Food, Housing, and Income).6) Education — Take control of what people read and listen to — take control of what children learn in school.7) Religion — Remove the belief in the God from the Government and schools.8) Class Warfare — Divide the people into the wealthy and the poor. This will cause more discontent and it will be easier to take (Tax) the wealthy with the support of the poor.Now, think ...Does any of this sound like what is happening to the United States? The difference is Trump Loves America and Hillary let men die, Voters Remember Benghazi Never Hillary
7 | Stacy Metzger | 1325845924178323_1325851800844402 | He's basically flipping off the democratic process. Is he considering a coup attempt if he loses? Sadly, I don't think I'd put that past him. His behavior and what he has said indicates he wants a dictator not the president.
8 | Daniel Guyewski | 1325845924178323_1325874037508845 | Dead people have already been found on voter rolls im different states, democrat operatives have been caught on tape admitting that they bus people around the country to illegally vote! Election fraud is already happening so wake up people!
9 | Kathleen Tebbetts Lewis | 1325845924178323_1325848987511350 | I could not care less whether or not he concedes, as long as he is not the winner!  And I never have to listen to his idiocies ever again.
10 | Brandon Adams | 1325845924178323_1325849397511309 | Hey MSNBC why don't you actually prove you aren't bought and paid for and actually say something about Hillary. I've watched your broadcast for an hour and it has been nothing but bashing Trump. God forbid we bring up the many points that Hillary has proved she is a fraud and shouldn't by law be able to run for president
11 | Curtis Cunningham | 1325845924178323_1325863590843223 | The last debate he said he would except. Nobody in the media wants to show that. Fact checking is what she wants. Plz go check. Google, you tube, news paper archives, and listen to Obama talk about her accomplishments in the last election when she ran against him. Plz people plz do her fact checking. You could be amazed at who she really is.
12 | Arletha Alexander | 1325845924178323_1325863214176594 | If the system is rigged then they need to go back and look at everyone that's incarcerated and make sure they were not jailed fraudulently!
13 | Jeff Bartulla | 1325845924178323_1325848184178097 | Has he should, the media has become a problem along with the DNC making it a propaganda machine. We as Americans need to take a hard look at what we are allowing to happen and demand the media and a Hillary tell the truth.
14 | Robert Young | 1325845924178323_1325875594175356 | Are we just gonna ignore the sustains of the wiki leaks documents where Hilary said she has a public policy and a private one. Every time it's brought up we discuss where the leaks came from and not the fact of what the leaks do to our so called democracy
15 | Ian Pickett | 1325845924178323_1325861064176809 | So. What. If Trump won't accept the results of the election. Trumps a total moron but that whole "tradition" is stupid. IF an election were to be rigged than of course it should be exposed and if a person is a sore loser after a fair and square loss ....who cares?Or did Democrats forget about their hanging chad protest that went on forever? The fact is that any American who truly thinks the system at large including the elections isn't "rigged" not only isn't paying attention but also must not really understand how disenfranchising the electoral college system itself is.Our elections are a joke, just ask all the dead people registered to vote, the countless ballots left uncounted or people like George Soros owning voting machines.
16 | Krystal J. Miranda | 1325845924178323_1325858724177043 | Any other politician would have say yes and moved on shows character to no say anything since he obviously didn't feel like he could honestly say yes or no ,
17 | Roy Robinson | 1325845924178323_1325863990843183 | The GOP rigged the voter right to keep Obama from winning The second term. North Carolina got over turn. Trump didn't say anything back than. About rigging.
18 | Steve Burch | 1325845924178323_1325851740844408 | Sorry ,Democrats we will let you know latter,He is not obligated to.make a pledge right now ,So cry for me muslim lovers
19 | Mike Deitz | 1325845924178323_1325858084177107 | Why would anyone accept it.she is a crook and he said so tonight she should not be in the race.Alexander Hamilton said it correctly when he discussed A democracy(which we are not) -thier character is tyranny.
20 | Hayley Johnson | 1325845924178323_1325875427508706 | Lol, of course he will accept the results. He's going to win! You "The Media" are just upset because Hillary had a bad night. #Trump2016
21 | Ivy Carter | 1325845924178323_1325860650843517 | So who cares if he do or don't?   Bye Trump!  But now if the Republicans want to set this as a trend, Democrats will call foul too when they win elections!  So if this is the way it's gonna be Democrats are ready!
22 | Ted Acuna | 1325845924178323_1325848767511372 | He might want to count the # of dead, convicted criminals, and illegal votes that are cast before accepting!
23 | Pat Feind | 1325845924178323_1325854580844124 | Sounds like the school yard bully fighting against everyone pushing him OFF the school yard. Just can't, and won't, except the fact that others don't like, don't want this on their playground.
24 | Adin Ducker | 1325845924178323_1325850084177907 | Hillary and Donald bombed this debate. I have no winner here . This election has been an absolute disaster. The writing is on the wall. I not happy one of these two pieces of filth is going to be our president. Just to sum this up. Screw all the national media outlets. Screw fox, screw NBC news, screw CNN. They are the main reason for this crapstorm of an election we have right now. All the media cared about was ratings. They wanted fireworks and they were willing to lose all their credibility in their journalistic integrity to make it happen. We should have had better candidates that no matter what political platform they represent show some class and respect american citizens. Trump and Hillary have no honor and no courage and no respect for anybody. The media unfortunately  brainwashed people into supporting them. The writing is on the wall. They both are bad. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure that out. Can you imagine the disgust of our past great presidents like Washington, Lincoln, FDR if they were alive today??? They are rolling and throwing up in their graves about the state of politics right now. Its lost class. Shame on the media. Shame on trump and hillary. And finally shame on the people that justify all of the selfish and repugnant acts these candidates have done. Im still going to vote. Just not for these two
25 | Belinda Bounds Carver | 1325845924178323_1325870600842522 | MSNBC, get over it.  If your so concerned about Trump accepting the results, then stop being so biased in your reporting.  Yes, it's cheating what you're doing and Americans have had enough.

MSNBC is the place for politics. For the most-up-to-date news from the 2016 trail, check out our elections hub page at decision2016.nbcnews.com.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Maria Panek O'Rourke | 1133503483412569_1133623850067199 | MSNBC is not the place for politics. It is the place for giving free campaign advertising to Clinton and Trump. Sanders should be a part of your "town hall" on Monday night. Otherwise, call it what it is, which is "free campaign commercial for Clinton, our favorite candidate"
2 | David Dingman | 1133503483412569_1133506790078905 | Trump will be our next President. Trump will bring fear to countries like Iran and North Korea because he is that unpredictable right now. That is the kind of President we need in the face of these out-law countries threating humanity..
3 | David Campbell | 1133503483412569_1135771106519140 | I am very disappointed in the biased coverage of Trump. Everyone of your hosts and reporters condemn Trump for the violence at his rally's. You people have not explored why the protesters show up with the goal to shut Trump down. I don't blame the violence on Trump. You have angry people who are crashing Trump events. How about some balanced reporting (Halley Jackson) instead to finding everyone you can to spout anti-Trump BS.  I don't like Trump, I voted for Bernie! However MSNBC is the organization that is feeding the Anti-Trump rhetoric. If you are truly interested in reporting the truth, stop drawing to conclusions and start looking for the systemic reason for the violence coming to Trump rallys.
4 | Jeff Hepola | 1133503483412569_1135592083203709 | The way you folks have handled this election season is atrocious.  You effectively made Trump the leading candidate by giving him non-stop free coverage.  If Gov. Kasich, who is the best qualified of the GOP candidates, had gotten one quarter of that free coverage, this could be a very different race.  Instead you feed people news on Trump who is catering to the angry, and Sanders who caters to the naive.  Reporters on the ground are doing great work, but back in the studios you are a major disappointment.
5 | Randee Breckenridge | 1133503483412569_1133529706743280 | Why in God's name isn't Bernie Sanders going to be in your town hall? Gotcha running scared huh...you people are ridiculous. Its ok...we don't need you...OBVIOUSLY! Viva la revolution!!!
6 | Robin Friedman | 1133503483412569_1184286111667639 | I watch Andrea Mitchell on her interview with Bernie Sanders today and think she is a total disgrace. She kept whining to him that he didn't he think he was interfering with her being able to go after Trump and he said over and over there are three people running for president and then she would ask another question about Hillary Clinton. If she was interviewing Bernie Sanders why didn't she let Bernie Sanders discuss Bernie Sanders viewpoints. Half of the interview was trying to get him to say he's keeping Clinton from doing a full-out blast on trump. I think she is way past your Prime doesn't ask good questions anymore and it's really boring. And when she comes on MSNBC I turn to CNN. But I'm afraid you've done that to me with a few others by getting rid of the good people on MSNBC.
7 | Sharon Walker | 1133503483412569_1282844978478418 | Where is Joy Reid? She's the only reason I watch MSNBC now. She doesn't pander and I loved how she has her facts and knowledge together. Wow when she actually was able to get Jesse Jackson on air unplanned to answer questions.
8 | James Parker | 1133503483412569_1133521413410776 | lol MSNBC trying to distance itself from their real slogan "Lean Forward" which everyone knows is just another term for Bend Over.
9 | David Bourque | 1133503483412569_1156828804413370 | James Carville (spelling) should wake up to the fact that many lifelong Democratic voters are fed up with corrupt politicians of both parties and consider themselves independents. Hillary has been bought and  paid for by greedy corporate America just like the vast majority of the party hierarchy. How can he be so stupid?
10 | Mike Shea | 1133503483412569_1164709813625269 | Why do you (specifically Morning Joe) continue to hammer Hillary on her release of transcripts from her speeches.  What are you thinking?  Why should she?  There is going to be a general election and she will be the candidtate.  Can you imagine how the Republicans will pick her speech apart word by word and take things out of context to use against her? Are you serious???  Why would she put ammo in the Republican guns? Give me a break.  Let the Repub candidates release their speeches and then she will release her speeches. Just imagine what the MEDIA would do with her transcripts!  What a dumb thing to expect her to do.
11 | Kat Brumitt | 1133503483412569_1174508122645438 | I have been an avid supporter of ALL of your programing, believing that everyone should have a voice. NO MORE! I disliked the obvious preference shown to "Dumf" by " Morning Joe" and co-host, and the brewha that resulted from it. But accepted that your programming was leading toward preferential treatment of candidates such as both Clinton and "Dumf". Your treatment of obviously slighting of Sanders angered me, but still I watched hoping you would retun to your previous way of unbiased reporting! You did not! Now I have just watched " Morning Joe"s positively disgusting pandering of "Dumf" and his feeble attempt to distract "Dumf" from continuing that vile misogynistic, rant! I will no longer "like" any of your programing and no longer watch my favorite news shows! I also will be encouraging all friends to do the same!
12 | Rob Hendrickson | 1133503483412569_1152809714815279 | I simply can not believe how the hosts of Morning Joe have deteriorated into a cheerleading squad for one of the most reprehensible candidates ever to run for the presidency. Joe, Mika, you have let your viewers down so profoundly, it actually makes me sad. Mika, in particular...you have reached the level of the average Fox News personality. This is going to go very badly for this show when Trump's candidacy implodes, as it inevitably will.
13 | Karen Gerardi | 1133503483412569_1153175751440251 | Watching the after debate show on msnbc is like watching the View. Everyone talking over each other, journalists calling statements insane. Journalists are supposed to bring facts to the forefront without intersecting their personal beliefs. Is msnbc in Hillary's pocket?
14 | John Chapman | 1133503483412569_1243495502413366 | Touching speech last night from Bill Clinton (Democrat National Convention) as he reminisces about his "life long walk with Hillary."I am sure it was unintentional, but Bill forgot a few key issues as they walked together down this "path of love."* As a young woman when Hillary worked for one of Arkansas' largest and most prestigious law firms she was terminated due to "unethical practices," which I guess Bill had forgotten.* Along this "love walk" was an never ending string of adulterous affairs perpetrated by Bill, several of whom brought law-suites stretching from his time in Arkansas, Washington DC and New York. His lovely wife Hillary attempted to cover them up, then humiliated and diminished the abused women.* No mention of the numerous (never ending) scandals that faced both Hillary and Bill during his Presidency, including Travel Gate (illegal firing of staff and false statements to investigators), Vince Forster death (illegal removal of documents from his White House office), White Water (illegal accounting practices, costing tax payers $73 million), Craig Livingstone (illegal FBI file leaks), Charlie Trie, John Huang and Johnny Chung (all convicted of finance violations or illegal contributions for the Clinton's), Rose law firm scandal (interference of a Federal investigation), The renting of he White House Lincoln bedroom (for personal gain of financial contributions), Pardon-gate (release of a convicted tax evader who was a major Clinton contributor), The removal of White House furnishings (which embarrassingly the Clinton's were forced to return), upon their departure from the White House, just to name a few.* Monica Lewinsky affair; a 23 year old girl giving our illustrious President oral sex under under his desk in the oval office. Lie's and cover ups abounded.* Impeachment, as a result (I never had sexual relations with that woman) of lying to Federal investigators. Hillary, as usual, downgraded, diminished and humiliated Monica Lewinsky, driving her to thoughts of suicide.* Hillary openly lied about being under sniper fire (with her daughter) at Bosnia airport.* Benghazi; our Ambassador and 3 other Americans were killed due to Secretary Hillary Clinton's negligence and disregard of pleas for help.* E-mail scandal; The FBI concluded that there was neglect on Hillary's part with the use of a private (unauthorized and illegal) e-mail server and with the removal of 30,000 sensitive and/or classified e-mails.* Attorney General Loretta Lynch; meets Bill Clinton on a private plane directly before the FBI comes to an indictment decision on the e-mail scandal.* Speaking fee's reaching into hundreds of thousands of dollars per speech, to groups and governments whereby Hillary would owe favors.* The Clinton Foundation; where did this money come from and what is it used for and how did Bill and Hillary accumulate well over $100 million in personal wealth by being public servants for a lifetime?* More e-mail controversy at the Democrat National Convention regarding "special treatment and favoritism" forcing the DNH head to step down, whereby Hillary immediately hires her for the Clinton campaign.I am certain that Bill just overlooked some of these minor life events as he strolled through his love and admiration for his wife Hillary. After all, these minor details weren't worth mentioning. I lived through each of these episodes and I remember clearly the far reaching consequences of each breach. Is this who America wants to lead the free world? Not me!
15 | Sean D. Huntington | 1133503483412569_1282880605141522 | "We should have taken the oil." After invading a sovereign nation, deposing their leader, dismantling their military and killing countless citizens, our biggest mistake according to Donald Trump was having left without having stolen all of the oil in Iraq, necessitating the occupation of all of the oil fields, with the requirement that they are protected against Iraqi and terrorist attack, which would require establishing permanent bases and a military presence in country, in effect setting up a situation where the US military would never leave. "It used to be to the victor go the spoils" -- and so the Trump foreign policy boils down to invading sovereign nations, stealing their wealth and natural resources and establishing permanent occupying forces to protect the private-sector war profiteers. Make America Great Again! You know, like when America used the military to steal the land, wealth and natural resources of Native Americans.
16 | David Tucker | 1133503483412569_1282929788469937 | Matt Lauer was an amateur in tonight's forum. Maybe you would not have to tell Sec. Clinton to hurry with her answer about ISIS, had you stuck to the topic and not spend ten minutes about emails. And could you go any softer on Trump? NBC and MSNBC are becoming jokes! You know you have little credibility left when liberals like me can barely stomach you these days.
17 | Maria Setterwall Barth | 1133503483412569_1764613497111342 | Are you kidding. The selling of Hillary with very select coverage to favor Establishment. What about Climate Change, clean water crisis. protest in North Dakota, gun discussion, prison reform, trade policies, sales of billion of dollars worth of weapons to Middle East, Veterans' Hospitals, Veterans on the street.etc.
18 | Carrie Walker Ruano | 1133503483412569_1282869018476014 | Matt Lauer was a jerk, he is a Trump supporter, gave Trump the easy question, he could talk as long as he wanted. He rushed Hillary threw every question. Next time get someone who is unbiased!
19 | Don Mackenzie | 1133503483412569_1187531758009741 | Why doesn't MSNBC cover the news on the weekends ?  Every time I turn it on on the weekend they are showing reruns of Caught on Camera or Lockup - is MSNBC a 7 day news channel or are this the firdt sign they are going under ?  It's hard to believe in an election year they can't provide 7 days of news coverage.
20 | Kevin Longworth | 1133503483412569_1767775906795101 | I can't believe the commentary from MSNBC. You are ignoring the most important points made by Sen. Kaine. Trump who is the self described "king of debt" is in debt to China and Russian oligarchs. Kaine put the question out there, would Trump be a president who has American interests first, or his own financial interests?Trump refuses to release his tax returns, hiding this indebtedness information from voters.The other important point Kaine made was that Trump and Pense both called Putin a stronger leader than Obama, but they don't know the difference between a dictator and a leader. In my opinion, these are the key points that disqualify Trump/Pense.
21 | Jon Rosell | 1133503483412569_1174069109356006 | Less repetition.  More in depth, investigative, impartial journalism.  More international and local news, rather than spending 15 different shows endlessly repeating the same top 3 stories to fill a 24 hour news cycle.    Instead, utilize the resources and platform at your disposal in a more responsible manner with a consciously redesigned approach with the sole goal of informing your audience.  Replace the echo chamber with the many crucial stories that get missed or thrown out with the trash on a daily/weekly basis.You already appeal to an educated, more liberal leaning, mind.  Your viewers are seeking understanding of the bigger picture.  They'll stay tuned longer if the same stories weren't repeated every hour; you'll also attract new viewers with stories that they won't be hearing on other networks.  Stick to this model through any initial reflexive opposition and you can build a reputation as the news source for a broader understanding of the issues and one that is binge-worthy rather than cyclical and repetitive. I recommend studying models of journalistic institutions like BBC, NPR, PBS and VICE for examples of how to approach news with the intent to seek wisdom, share knowledge and inform our electorate, rather than chase trends on Twitter.  Our republic's very foundation is damaged and it's future threatened by a lack of an informed and engaged electorate, which in turn depends on diligent, uncensored and impartial journalism.I implore you to apply a public-spirited, chivalrous and long term lens upon your role in our ongoing experiment with democracy; as part of an honest self-evaluation of your current capitalist and reactionary network model, followed by reflection upon the role you wish to play in future history; where boldness is rewarded.  If you are foresighted enough to rearrange the network's priorities; replacing profit with broad, nuanced journalism; you can reintroduce the concept of integrity to cable news, help preserve democracy and decrease political polarization while simultaneously attracting a larger more diverse audience and increasing your revenue and brand prestige in the process.
22 | Gordon James | 1133503483412569_1282859335143649 | I am flabbergasted at the lack of insight and absolutely no comments in respect to Trump's comments regarding Putin. What is going on with the analysts and producers? Matt confronted Trump regarding Putin's policies regarding Russian invasion of Crimea, the Ukrainian quagmire, a potential conflict of enormous proportions, and Russian support of Assad. Trump emphatically defended Putin and repudiated Obama. Lawrence O'Donnel just gave it lip service as I watch this journalistic tragedy of omission. I have never been more disappointed in the analysis of MSNBC-two hours and absolutely no mention of the major disturbing comment of the entire forum. I am moving to CNN< MSNBC is simply not listening> What the hell is going on with you people. If morning Joe does not address this Putin-Trump relationship count me out. Good-bye MSNBC-you have been infiltrated by the right.
23 | Carin Simmons | 1133503483412569_1282887225140860 | Is anyone on this bloody asinine channel going to bring up the rape of female soldiers? "What did they expect?"  W. T. F.???  You just let those Generals say Trump did a good job and he said NOTHING and thought rape is expected!?
24 | Jo Liggett | 1133503483412569_1175437505885833 | Okay, now seems just the opposite.....Bernie's wife has been on Rachel show 2 times recently, yesterday being latest for her, and now tonight on With All Due Respect, she is on again today.  Haven't seen Hillary, Bill or their daughter on.......MSNBC showing a Bernie bias?  Just the opposite of above comment.
25 | ReGina Diaz-Hunter | 1133503483412569_1282925951803654 | What makes Matt Lauer qualified to do  this Commander in Chief town hall? He chased 2 qualified women out of jobs, Anne and supposedly slept with Natalie  Morales.  The beat goes on and on.. He's a loser!

1 | Shay Goldberg | 1540123256007699_1540126716007353 | Donald Trump started off rambling with the very first question about the Constitution and continued his incoherent and disconnected responses often going off topic . . . while losing control.On the other hand, Hillary Clinton remains calm, poised and informed giving well-thought out intelligent answers.
2 | Mark van Kranenburg | 1540123256007699_1540127262673965 | "If she wins, I will absolutely support her." - Trump, 1st debatePoor Donnie is getting afraid he's losing to her in three weeks.

4 | Ric Winthrop | 1540123256007699_1540131892673502 | Has Trump actually answered any of the questions that Wallace directly asked him....No.   He just asked him about Social Security and Medicare but Trump completely avoided answering the question.  Loser!
5 | Marchelle Crawford Marshall | 1540123256007699_1540151442671547 | TRUMP and the name calling .. "Such a Nasty Woman!  I am So blessed that the men in my life for 52 years (my husband of 32 years) has never spoken to me the way Donald J. Trump speak of women.  I wonder what happens when he and his wife disagree!
6 | Dean Henry | 1540123256007699_1540131536006871 | If what Trump says is true, Hillary would be the first candidate to try and steal an election from the candidate who is losing.
7 | Charlene McMillan | 1540123256007699_1540128899340468 | Trump does not want to be a loser and not to a woman. Someone give him a crying towel cause he will need it. Trump is a LOSER!!!
8 | Lae Ivey | 1540123256007699_1540134656006559 | We're going to make Hillary the next POTUS! He's only whining about the election being rigged cause he's losing... I can't wait for November 8th.. You will be taking the walk of shame!!!!!
9 | CJ Mehus | 1540123256007699_1540135179339840 | Donald doesn't want to be president, he's doing everything he can to lose, he's insulting and embarrassing you! You were ridiculous enough to go along with him and he wants out- back to his jet, golf courses and club houses where he'll never see any of you again.
10 | Beulah Marie | 1540123256007699_1540132226006802 | Hillary is actually the Puppet Master and her strings run throughout Washington. Trump will cut those strings and return control to the American people!!! 🇺🇸👌🏻👍🏻
11 | Matt Ernst | 1540123256007699_1540159582670733 | Chris Wallace has left her off the hook on answering two questions he posed which were never answered. 1. To explain her role in discrediting the victims of her husband (never even broached) & 2. Would she shoot down a Russian plane in her hypothetical no fly zone in Syria.
12 | Frank Malfettone | 1540123256007699_1540142472672444 | You know why people don't trust the election process? Because of the biased media working overtime to fill voters with propoganda. 24x7x365 home cooking for the Democratic voters and #wikileaks is confirming what we have been saying. See you Nov 8.
13 | Gregg Allen Robison Sr. | 1540123256007699_1540160009337357 | So, why is it that the news anchors are so BIAS, that all they can do at the end of the debate is try to slam Trump? Also, he didn't say he wouldn't accept the results of the election, he said, "Let's wait and see".
14 | Pat Frasier | 1540123256007699_1540169376003087 | Msnbc is Bias, talk show on Trump and what he said. Msnbc are word flip flopers. There are O'Keefe videos undercover of DNC Campaign rigging and voter fraud. Msnbc is bought and is not for the people. If you know of no rigging or voter fraud, then you all need to quit, this shows you are the worst news chanel if your haven't heard the news or tell it. Haters...
15 | Rebecca Baker | 1540123256007699_1540164876003537 | Gore the loser didn't concede to Bush the winner.Gore sued. Repeatedly. And he & his supporters never accepted the results.
16 | Greg Solomon | 1540123256007699_1540172299336128 | Screw all of u - every media outlet trashes trump - are u all blind she's just a politician she's going to talk and nothing gets done - Trump Trump Trump!!!!!!!!!
17 | Kathy Lou | 1540123256007699_1540159312670760 | Steve Schmidt just got in the best post debate line...that Trump looked like an old man in the park feeding the squirrels and arguing with himself!   No more calls folks, we have a winner!
18 | Kathleen Winkler | 1540123256007699_1540170179336340 | Thank you Steve Schmidt for clearly explaining how serious it is for our country's peaceful transition of power to be maintained. It is such a relief to hear a rational, sane person after that display of complete Trump insanity.
19 | Dar Win | 1540123256007699_1540127802673911 | For some reason when I hear or see Hillary Clinton, I think of the woman who told Winston Churchill, “If I were your wife I’d put poison in your tea!” in which I feel Churchill's sentiments in his reply, “If I were your husband I’d drink it.”
20 | Gene Jones | 1540123256007699_1540209999332358 | Ladies & Gents that's how you tell lies to the American voters, so they can vote for you! Empty promises just like Obama did it with his free health care! Everyone was fooled about it and now Obamacare is a disaster!HC is another big gov. puppet! She doesn't care about the middle class! She will tax us the most!!!Don't be fooled by another Democrat like Obama did...
21 | Karen Eubanks | 1540123256007699_1809221476026028 | Thanks for the moment of clarity after the bucket of crazy Trump's campaign manager unleashed on us. Rachel is a voice of reason and outstanding news reporting. 👍🏻 The only thing Trump won tonight was "most likely to harbor delusional plans to become a dictator"
22 | Emmanuel Prikas | 1540123256007699_1540186099334748 | I cannot believe that one of the most impressive pieces of writing in history, the US constitution & vehicle to peacefully settling the violent appointment of Thomas Jefferson, was just s**t all over by that orange grub. Not accepting defeat is proof that no laws could ever stop this fascist maniac
23 | Isabel Cruz | 1540123256007699_1540168599336498 | Another Donald crafted response to maintain our attention, hold us in suspense, prolong his hold on us like an emotionally burden child not wanting to be "abandoned" by others! The only outcome out of this debate is "ooooh, he will not accept the election results"! He is playing us like a fine fiddle.
24 | Berta Alexie | 1540123256007699_1540186539334704 | So annoying. My 10 year old daughter said his face looks so mad! Jus looks like no real questions were answered by trump. He is good at putting his opponent down that's all I see from him. Maybe I'll jus write in a another name for president.
25 | Marilyn Stutto | 1540123256007699_1809232306024945 | He's dead in the water after tonite   He spit on the American way of life. He thinks he is special he won't except the results of the election. He is going too lose by millions   What is he really certifiable. I think so.   He's done for sure.  Thank god. He's. Nuts

3 | Sandi Mossa | 1540082496011775_1540099076010117 | He is the bad person here. He just spreads hate and ugliness every time he opens his mouth, unless he is talking a about Russia and Putin! He does love Russian and Putin. No we should not trust him with anything. He is evil.

5 | Aubrey Jackson | 1540082496011775_1540117736008251 | Trump is not suppose to know as much as Hillary, she should have been winning these debates by a land-side, but she has performed horribly.  She can hardly look the camera in the eye.He's hammering her.  Those grins and chuckles come nervously.Lying year after year.  She has to look down to best think of her lie.

10 | Missy Thorpe-Getz | 1540082496011775_1540133069340051 | Hillary should know all about respecting woman...her husband is the poster child of respecting woman..bahahaha!! And her response is to stand by and say nothing!! Boy that helps woman rights. She is worse then her husband! It's sick!

13 | Dale Lange | 1540082496011775_1540103059343052 | We have American ground troops fighting in Iraq again. In the past, Obama claimed we had to pull our troops out because they weren't protected by a status of forces agreement. How can he now send troops in without the protection that caused the withdrawal?
14 | Joh VH | 1540082496011775_1540222712664420 | The media is so childish, biased and one-sided for Hillary Clinton whereas everything Trump says is true. And to all EUROPEANS who support Hillary Clinton: You should be ashamed of yourselves! If Hillary will be elected, she will start a WAR with Russia which will mean that Europe will be the piggy in the middle.

17 | Steven Wollam | 1540082496011775_1540112529342105 | Trump not only hasn't said anything new but he's also making the same old erroneous accusations by using the same old simple minded generalized language and words.
18 | Evita R. Roque | 1540082496011775_1540189752667716 | "We have some bad, bad people that has to go out of this country" Yes! And you should be the first one to go out stupid! Racist! Depraved!😝Besides a nasty guy calls a woman nasty???🙈 He just had no arguments left and he was clearly so frustrated, lol!😜 Sáquese cochino!😀😀😀😀😀😜😜😜😜😜😜
19 | Al Snook | 1540082496011775_1540224392664252 | Ridiculous , since the first time Dangerous Donald mentioned the Wall, no one has bothered to ask him HOW he was going to build it.He just says he's going to build it and everyone leaves it at that.DD complains constantly about how Hillary gets nothing done. However he never talks about How he'll actually do anything. Strange that.
20 | Ray Smith | 1540082496011775_1540122486007776 | It's like Mike Wallace is interviewing Hillary Clinton and there's a heckler standing on the stage with her! Thank god he cant hold his composure for more than a few minutes, he might have been able to BS his way through this.
21 | OmaryJulieta Elorza | 1540082496011775_1540120266007998 | One of these candidates knows the facts, the stakes and the plans. The other is your uninformed, drunk relative who never, ever shuts up.
22 | Karen Myers Jorgenson | 1540082496011775_1540127086007316 | I think if you look closely you can see that Trump is wearing a breathe-right strip that's covered up with make up. It's the only smooth place on his face. That has to be why he's sniffing less tonight.
23 | Bethleigh Flanagan | 1540082496011775_1540129292673762 | weakest moderator, letting Trump talk over everyone and letting Trump break in and talk over him and disrespect him. LOSER! I give him points for trying tho but then completely backing down and letting Trump talk over him. and pushing on the questions.
24 | Rosebud Cordier | 1540082496011775_1540236842663007 | HILLARYWONTHEDEBATE!!  Bigly too!! Lmao. Now poor Melania and little Ivanka have to hear Trump WHINE all night!  Then he'll start tweeting and crying around until daylight!!  😂😂😂😭😭
25 | Sally Fleming | 1540082496011775_1540266855993339 | Heroin and the horrible things it has done in this country means you need to discuss the awful truth. 1 percent growth will not pay the bills run up by the dems.This election cannot be supposed as being run fairly until it has actually happened

4 | Kimmeth Powell | 1325733330856249_1325747644188151 | he still cant just say he condemns Putin's hacking? No instead its more praise and promises of how close we will be with them - go ahead and look at whats going on with Russia and Syria - Russia isn't doing that much to combat ISIS, they are exploiting the situation to set them selves up, not us. They won't do us any favors.
5 | Aubrey Jackson | 1325733330856249_1325750574187858 | Only a bald face liar, like Hillary, can't consistently look into the camera.My grandmother used to say if you lie, you will still.  If you still you will kill.She's been lying all of her life.  She's been stilling since she's been in office.  She was responsible for the killing of the four Americans that died in the 2012 Benghazi attack: Ambassador Chris Stevens, Information Officer Sean Smith, and two CIA operatives, Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods, both former Navy SEALs. Stevens is the first U.S. ambassador killed in an attack since Adolph Dubs was killed in 1979.
6 | Donna Gates-Stuber | 1325733330856249_1325755734187342 | She's so desperate going after nothing of importance.  She is so lucky to have the liberal media behind her to cover her corruption and criminal acts. Hopefully the American people are smarter than that.
7 | Shanika Ricketts | 1325733330856249_1325754027520846 | Didn't is Wife said that he apologize to her when the tapes were release! Didn't he just said him didn't even apologize to his wife because it's not true #fact play the Meliana tapes 😀😃😄
8 | Top Dollar Investment Group | 1325733330856249_1325741414188774 | I can not believe Donald Trump is making statements on national news that Russia is expanding their nuclear capability and America is doing nothing. Why would a presidential candidate make such as serious acquisition our nuclear ambitions.... that would be "Top Secret" and should not be discussed..... Unbelievable!
9 | Craig Halbert | 1325733330856249_1325778154185100 | Hillary is sweating buckets blaming the Russians for her woes centered on the #Wikleaks emails. Clinton is complaining about hacking didn't she store classified documents on her private email sever located in her basement?Clinton is blaming Trump for the violence at his rallies but the people formulating the violence are on the Democratic Party payroll.
10 | Katie Johnson | 1325733330856249_1325756090853973 | OMG! Trump on the Access Hollywood tape, that he didn't even apologize to his wife because he didn't do anything to apologize for. Melania said to Anderson HE VERY MUCH APOLIGIZED! So is she lying or is he lying? Also Ivanka said he apologized to her as well. HMMMM lying runs deep in that Trump family!
11 | Pat Cunningham | 1325733330856249_1325761014186814 | Why does Donald Trump continue to bring up the issue of whether or not Hilary is fit enough to be President. If you look at the split screen she's more poised and articulate. Donald T. is the only one moving around, drinking water, and adjusting his microphone. I am so glad to see this Hilary tonight. She's baiting Donald & he's becoming unhinged all over again.
12 | Dar Win | 1325733330856249_1325781314184784 | For some reason when I hear or see Hillary Clinton, I think of the woman who told Winston Churchill, “If I were your wife I’d put poison in your tea!” in which I feel Churchill's sentiments in his reply, “If I were your husband I’d drink it.”
13 | Kathy Burns | 1325733330856249_1325752740854308 | Hillary already has been proven to use double talk.. she tells her sheep what they want to hear all the while planning their demise in private... Keep sleeping you Hi-LIAR-y sheep
14 | Carol Newberg | 1325733330856249_1325778990851683 | That is not a plan tremendous jobs it is very sad! People that are political hacks. We don't use those people we use political hacks! Very much smarter! Make a lot of money! What the hell did Trump just say, word salad!
15 | Ross Mc | 1325733330856249_1325741770855405 | Bad loans caused the recession. Freddy mac fanny mae.. Who created these banks? DING DING Yes the democrats. Check your sheriff sales. It's still killing the economy.
16 | Menard Alex | 1325733330856249_1325753344187581 | She laughting at donald when he tells the truth because she doesnt care about americans and she cant look at the camera when she talks because shes lying!!!!!!
17 | Shawn McGinty | 1325733330856249_1325743897521859 | Why does no one care about the content on wiki leaks? Russians hacked her accounts, that's wrong, but Look at the content.  She's not saying any of that stuff is untrue.  Deflect.  Someone call her out.  The stuff being released is damning and it needs to be considered
18 | Lance Agee | 1325733330856249_1325743520855230 | Why is Hillary Clinton using prepared notes?Remember when Hillary Clinton gave that reset button to the Russians? Remember when the Clintons sold 150 million in uranium to the Russians? Sounds like she is a puppet.
19 | Carol Newberg | 1325733330856249_1325755420854040 | What kind of country do we want in? Not to live in Trump Land that is for sure! Trump will turn this planet into a black crisp!
20 | Rodney Goff | 1325733330856249_1325747557521493 | It just crossed my mind she's talking about global warming How does the United States get by with shredding tires sending them to China to burn in their power plants with the Coal
21 | Ray Smith | 1325733330856249_1325744587521790 | HaHaHa! He didn't make it to the 30 minute mark b4 he cracked! "WRONG!!!!" YAY!! I win the company pool!! I had 29 minutes!!
22 | Tristen Schoppaul | 1325733330856249_1325741114188804 | Now that's funny. It's also false but nobody will care on the left. Clinton as president and it's a guarantee to war with Russia.
23 | Karen Walters Arndt | 1325733330856249_1325739557522293 | Yes, she plans to raise taxes on Trump and his tax bracket and that is the true reason his tax bracket hates her.
24 | H Jake Broomes | 1325733330856249_1325775714185344 | I wonder what Trump really knows about nuclear treaties and nuclear missiles. There is a reason that the Russians appear to have more missiles than the US. It is a sneaky little concept from back in the day called MIRVing. I am sure the Russians do it now also, which is why Reagan introduced SDI. However, certain non US entities did not want this. I am against war but I know something about spy planes and nuclear treaties. You can't win an election by claiming that everything and everybody is wrong and that you are the only one that is right. It just sounds stupid. Only one other entity in the universe attempted such.
25 | Desiree Seal | 1325733330856249_1325771634185752 | I was looking for the live feed and the only one who is fox they play clips out of context and they make him look bad I have been watching all stations to get as much info to make the right choice based on what I feel we need. I know that someone whom has been proven a liar and a criminal. I right now he is getting her showing you but they wouldn't show you that.

1 | Linda Tomasello | 1325722844190631_1325726470856935 | She said he choked. And when she did that, you could see his blood pressure rise. Keep poking the bear, Hillary. 28 min in. and about another 10 min, we'll see unhinged Trump.....
2 | Christyne A Cisterna | 1325722844190631_1325729897523259 | I want to know why when Trump speaks of "illegal aliens" why is it ALWAYS Mexicans? Why are we NOT talking about the Russians, Canadians, Middle Easterners?
3 | Marcus Thomas | 1325722844190631_1325727074190208 | The last time a Republican was president we were losing 790,000 jobs a month. Under President Obama strong leadership we are adding 280,000 jobs a month. Lets keep moving in the right direction. #VoteBlue I'm Donald Trump and I approve this comment.
4 | Rita Spinelli | 1325722844190631_1325731080856474 | They will legislate women back to coat hanger days. Women under trump will be set back a century...all through carefully crafted legislation
5 | Donna Marconi | 1325722844190631_1325733960856186 | He's just not very polished or articulate. He can't beat her at debating. Everybody knows who they're voting for already this is just theatre
6 | Naisun Mckoy | 1325722844190631_1325735917522657 | The majority of illegal immigrants come into this country legally on visas. They just never go back. They are flying here not walking over the border. Building a wall is asinine. We need reform. Deport illegals with criminal records and create a path the citizenship for law abiding illegal immigrants so they pay taxes and contribute.
7 | Tommy DeVaughn | 1325722844190631_1325829414179974 | I wish she would call him on his lack of knowledge of The Constitution. The Constitution is more than four words of the 2nd amendment; right to bear arms. That is all he knows about The Constitution, and he proves it with the plethora of assertions he has made during his campaign. I also wished she would have called him out on his decisions to avoid answering questions when he knows he lacks the knowledge base. Then he redirects to attack her personally. As if to say, let’s not talk about me. Let’s talk about her, her husband, or Obama instead of what I know about governing. Republicans should be offended by his campaign because he has fraudulently represented the GOP. I am highly offended he plays the victim and at every angle he paints our country, its ideals, our people, and our democracy in such a dark and gloomy outlook. Lindsey Graham is correct. If he loses, he will lose because he failed as a candidate.
8 | Tom Gertenhäuer | 1325722844190631_1325737860855796 | Where is your proof that Russia is behind the hack attack? without proof of any kind for sure, that's solid, but its interesting when the RNC was being hack attacked, there was no accusations against russia for doing it, and no upset feelings about it either, but i guess its different when its your dirty secrets being made public isn't it? before hacked info was totally legitimate, but now it isn't legitimate because "russia" is doing the hack attack and could be manipulating the emails, lol
9 | Rodney Goff | 1325722844190631_1325735790856003 | You can't raise minimum wage things will Skyrocket stock will drop retirement will be lost and what about people that went to school to further their education i just make a little  above  minimum wage does that mean since I have an education If they raise minimum wage I'll get a raise too
10 | Diana Patton Price | 1325722844190631_1325856514177264 | I used to be Pro-Life until I shared a hospital room with someone getting an abortion.  I was there for surgery to help get pregnant and I was mad at her.  Then  after our procedures she was crying so hard...she told me her story.  I promised myself I would never judge anyone like that again.  Republicans don't realize the problems that occur in pregnancies.  I remember years ago watching a program about the American companies that moved to Mexico.  One was polluting so bad that both towns, one in Texas and the other one in Mexico were having babies born without brains.  Republicans would made a woman carry a baby to full term knowing that it is going to NOT survive.  Medical decisions belong in the hands of the family and the doctor...no one else.  Republicans will make a woman have the child but they don't want to help her take care of it with Healthcare or if she needs help financially.  Years ago Newt G. wanted to put children from poor families in group institutions and he also wanted everyone to have a computer.  Replace the baby with a laptop....they are also against Birth Control, but they aren't as vocal anymore as they used to be.
11 | James Wairimu | 1325722844190631_1325736770855905 | Wait until Chris ask him about why he take the blue pill away from home. Mr groper will sweat, he dnt like black women? That's why he keep saying they should go to Africa. He always have an eye  for immigrants to Mary n white women to grope.
12 | Hannah Kronenberger | 1325722844190631_1325731617523087 | I would love if they would shut up, stop bashing each other and talk about the issues. We should be talking about immigration and we've moved onto nuclear weapons. WHAT THE HELL PEOPLE GET YOURSELVES TOGETHER. I'm so absolutely disappointed right now and this debate just started.
13 | Elsa Wertman-Bush | 1325722844190631_1325797864183129 | How did she get to sidestep the question on how her husband treats women and how she has treated those same women. That is one we should have seen her have to answer. God I hope she loses. Lying lying and then she lies some more.
14 | Cathy McIntosh | 1325722844190631_1325728754190040 | she will fall tonight....with all the leaked emails showing what a cow she is...I cannot stand to even listen to her voice!
15 | Billy Thomas | 1325722844190631_1325732680856314 | Five minutes ago Hillary's biggest concern was protecting toddlers from guns and now she is trying to justify late term, partial birth abortions~ GATSBY
16 | Sherry Johnson Balch | 1325722844190631_1325739717522277 | He claims he wants to cut taxes for EVERYONE, especially the rich, BUT at the same time ramp up spending. Anyone see a problem with that? LOL
17 | Sherry Johnson Balch | 1325722844190631_1325741267522122 | Whenever he brings up how we are losing jobs, why doesn't anyone call out his and his family's manufacturing jobs not in the US?
18 | Dottie Zydek | 1325722844190631_1325797080849874 | The thought of someone like Trump basically telling women what they can or cannot do regarding their lives and bodies is terrifying .
19 | Eric Forrest | 1325722844190631_1325807504182165 | She put him down tonight next week he should be cleaning out his locker no more locker room talk he was the same guy conspiracy lies rude can't take a lost look no taxes we said cool but he cant accept the lost thats lack of leadership there champion loose with pride and congrats the winner he can't lead this country with no plans still
20 | Pat Edelman | 1325722844190631_1325752314187684 | You popped him with that one!  He even had to gather himself together...for once he stood speechless and wasn't interrupting!  YES!
21 | Luke Brown | 1325722844190631_1325731330856449 | Actually Putin said on a YouTube available video that we USA outsmarted him and he doesn't know what we are doing

23 | Top Dollar Investment Group | 1325722844190631_1325741794188736 | I can not believe Donald Trump is making statements on national news that Russia is expanding their nuclear capability and America is doing nothing.

24 | Carla Simon | 1325722844190631_1325740750855507 | Trump says he will bring back jobs to Amercia, does that mean he will bring his companies back to Amercia? So many of his products are made over seas.
25 | June J McMullen | 1325722844190631_1325726950856887 | And when he says, "Believe me", he is lying -more than usual

1 | Mary Ann Hood McCann | 1325720834190832_1325723287523920 | I really wanted Chris Wallace to address the fact that Trump has not always been pro-life. He used to be pro-choice. Can you say "flip flop"?
2 | Brian Cochran | 1325720834190832_1325723894190526 | Birth rates have declined dramatically as a result of birth control access. Want no abortions? Give universal access to birth control. Abstinence does not work.
3 | Fiona McArthur | 1325720834190832_1325723177523931 | How many women at 9 months do that to there child...he is a liar...late term is the most traumatic for the mother and hey don't do it lightly
4 | Tabitha Hoffler | 1325720834190832_1325725887523660 | Trump gets away with not really saying anything of substance. He blames everyone for everything. He is never responsible for anything.
5 | Regina Dear | 1325720834190832_1325728840856698 | He has been giving her death stares! We do not need a President who rules with intimidation or domination. Never, EVER Trump!!!
6 | Shirley Westfall | 1325720834190832_1325723497523899 | Because women are so stupid we cannot make our own choices. Even though he wanted Marla to abort Tiffany.

8 | Jerry Toupal | 1325720834190832_1325726014190314 | Trump said just last week that ICE endorsed him . But he has been saying this since before September. So which is it? Neither because they are a government entity.
9 | Jill Narstrom | 1325720834190832_1325725087523740 | If Republicans don't win this race this will likely be end of the two party system, and then that's the end of America and our constitution. Say whatever you want but whoever is President major changes are on the way and I at least want to know I did my part urging people to get out and vote Trump!
10 | Teresa Lucas Doherty | 1325720834190832_1325727204190195 | If a pregnant mother is murdered the perp is charged with two counts of murder. One for the mother and one for the unborn fetus. Why the double standard..It is murder either way.
11 | Brenda Brickner | 1325720834190832_1325738107522438 | Didn't he want Marla to abort his daughter Tiffany and she wouldn't? I have no facts just seems to me i read that somewhere...

2 | Geoff Gentel | 1325718480857734_1325720900857492 | I think it's safe to say that if Trump was hoping for a turnaround for his disaster of a campaign it ain't going to happen tonight!
3 | Marcus Thomas | 1325718480857734_1325720254190890 | Republicans are pro-life and yet support the death penalty. Hypocrisy? Yes! Do as I say, not as I do, the Republican way of life.
4 | Tom Gertenhäuer | 1325718480857734_1325721917524057 | intereting how with all the covereage of the crazy stuff trump said about women, funny how no one brought up a former chef of hillary clinton, that said he heard her call black people the N word
5 | Diane Wadsworth | 1325718480857734_1325812640848318 | Once again Trump starts off focused and then goes off the rails. He praised Russia and Putin again, knows NOTHING about Mosul or Aleppo,  and just wandered around the Middle East questions with fluff and zero substance. He is NOT presidential.
6 | Top Dollar Investment Group | 1325718480857734_1325743070855275 | I can not believe Donald Trump is making statements on national news that Russia is expanding their nuclear capability and America is doing nothing.

18 | Tomas Davis | 1325718480857734_1325719447524304 | Clinton is losing terribly in the debate. WikiLeaks just dropped emails with Clinton calling Blacks the "N" word.

In the meantime Trump is going to blame everyone from the media to a 10-year-old girl riding her bike in the neighborhood. We just have to sit back and watch the full meltdown of Trump over the next few weeks until Hillary gets elected.

8 | Kirstien Demuth | 1325716067524642_1325718164191099 | Hillary won the debate hands down. Get your head out of your a$$ if you think otherwise.
9 | Jennifer Yu | 1325716067524642_1325746520854930 | Trump is so laughably ignorant. India and China are developing countries, of course their growth is higher. And ehT a hypocrite!

11 | Franklin Strum | 1325716067524642_1325720960857486 | To be short on guns Hillary will ban open carry, reverse Heller decision and have gun manufacturers sued for criminals actions.

12 | Barbara Healey | 1325716067524642_1325718714191044 | So nice that she supports Roe Vs Wade, but what about protecting a viable baby/fetus?? Doesn't a baby older than 4 months old get a chance to live?? The health of the mother should always be considered, but if the mother is healthy why kill the baby??

20 | Diana Patton Price | 1325716067524642_1325872577508991 | After 45 years of conservative rulings, here’s what a liberal Supreme Court would do"...In 1973, the Supreme Court reversed a lower-court order that had compelled Texas to fund its school districts — the poor Hispanic and African American districts and the richer, mostly white districts — equally. The vote in San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez was 5 to 4 . A year later, the same Republican-appointed majority stopped the courts from extending school desegregation into mostly white suburbs. In both cases, the rulings emphasized the value of local control of schools. As a result, public schools are more segregated today than they were in 1970, and there are serious questions about the quality of the education provided in poorer districts...."https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/after-45-years-of-conservative-rulings-heres-what-a-liberal-supreme-court-would-do/2016/02/19/efa63ad4-d589-11e5-b195-2e29a4e13425_story.html?utm_term=.1199b551f884

--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Karen White | 1325693407526908_1325695027526746 | Get rid of Andrea Mitchell She is bias against Hillary. She repeated that Hillary was doping like it was true. She is irresponsible and should be fired. Send her to fox. She is lousy at her job
2 | Ritz Ritzy | 1325693407526908_1325693824193533 | ok Hillary good luck girl! just keep blocking and talking about the issues. You're almost there! #Hillary2016
3 | Al Shannon | 1325693407526908_1325739634188952 | Wallace is an embarrassment to real journalist. He will never nor his network be asked to get near a national debate stage. He has fed Trump the questions and has been attacking only Hillary. So far, Hillary is still wining.
4 | Deb Brodigan | 1325693407526908_1325723817523867 | Sniffing, sniffing, sniffing, scare talk, not really answer the question. Mexico has said they will move to take back New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, part of California, and part of Colorado if NAFTA is stopped.
5 | Kathy Pazienza | 1325693407526908_1325705294192386 | I really dislike TV host Chris Matthew's! He constantly interrupts his guests , asks them a question, then interrupts and talks over them. It is getting to the point that if he is on, we turn the channel. Rachel Maddow,Chris Hayes, and Joy are much better !!
6 | Belinda Cullen Black | 1325693407526908_1325699570859625 | Wouldn't it be wonderful if they both were given a test in Civics as part of the debate?  Hillary's been in government all her life  and is on a completely different playing field than Trump.  He would crash and burn.
7 | Cammie Stevens-Washburn | 1325693407526908_1325718740857708 | I have watched all the debates and it is very rare that Trump Ever Ever Ever answer a question........He deflects to Hillary. Hillary has the answers or an ideas....Deflect Deflect Deflect never Ever does he answer a question. He can't even answer a question!!!! God Help Us if Trump becomes President!!! Trump you are not God!!!
8 | Silver Cloud | 1325693407526908_1325705447525704 | Sorry Donald Trump is way ahead and we do have a rigged Election...everybody knows it just like Hillary has been getting away with Murder... No surprise.
9 | Cammie Stevens-Washburn | 1325693407526908_1325760630853519 | It's time the American People do whats best for America!!! GO HILLARY!!!   Trump it takes more than one person to pass a law!!! Trump you are creating riots....No Trump you should never have been aloud to run!!!
10 | Al Shannon | 1325693407526908_1325717047524544 | I told you so. Already it is evident that Trump has been fed questions by Wallace. Trump knows nothing about particular cases of gun control unless he has been fed the questions.
11 | Patricia Williams-Schlitz | 1325693407526908_1325701704192745 | So , Brian Williams, if the elections aren't rigged, how do you account for the recently released videos EXPLAINING how they've been "doing  it for the past 50 years" !!! Report ALL the news, PLEASE!😡😡😡
12 | Richard Kiely | 1325693407526908_1325698567526392 | Pence is not an American. He so obviously hates Americans and states that there is widespread voter fraud. At the base of this is an undermining of how democracy works. The Republican Party is fanning the flames of treasonous acts. Americans will not stand for this. Americans will stand up to the non-American extreme right wing believers and they shall be chucked, jolly to the sea.
13 | Lee B Brian | 1325693407526908_1325711517525097 | It hasn't started but Trump & his supporters will declare him the overwhelming winner!! Which is okay with me. Seeing as Hillary will win the election by a landslide!!!
14 | Carlos DeCarvalho | 1325693407526908_1325697934193122 | Liberals need to get your heads out of the sand, drive with your window open, see the people around you, stop turning away from the reality, facing poverty head on and do something about it? When was the last time you walked up to a poor person and hand them a $20 bill and said god bless you, knowing that you are far better off then they are! Liberals are self interest individuals who only see themselves and no one else! It sickens me!
15 | Kalar Walters | 1325693407526908_1325697450859837 | Love Steve Schmidt!!!  P.S. Why isn't the difference discussed between voter fraud and voter registration fraud?  The latter does not result in voter fraud, but it sounds bad.  Please explain that to people!
16 | Mark Idzik | 1325693407526908_1325698634193052 | Hey Steve Schmitt instead of helping the left and NBC why don't you get a real job instead of criticizing Republicans the foundation is there but people like you make us look bad just by saying what you do as opposed to telling the truth it's not Trump's fault that it's crumbling a part of a commission to look into voter fraud then you'll find the real answers do the research my friend
17 | Sue Rolfe | 1325693407526908_1325700804192835 | Did Brian Williams just vow to brings "facts back" after this is all over?? How about you bring facts back now? He's so painful to listen to. Poor Rachel Maddow. You should team her up with Chris Hayes.
18 | Steven Tucker | 1325693407526908_1325695954193320 | This is what the liberal Democratic party has become. Look, you may be a lifelong Democratic, but they are not who they once were and do you really want to be a part of what they have become? Democrats no longer care about people, that is evident by the lack of respect they continue to display for the American people. Watch this video, if you really care, to see exactly what devices they use to hurt the American people. You will not see the liberal mainstream media talk about it because they are a part of it. https://youtu.be/hDc8PVCvfKs
19 | Buster Pleton | 1325693407526908_1325734167522832 | it's sad that just debating get's him so mad. He CANNOT be president, no way. He did try to be cool, but Hillary got him to show how he still is..........DANGEROUS.
20 | Cheryl Hall | 1325693407526908_1325698517526397 | We should all be talking about those emails, the collusion between the HRC camp and the State Department, the FBI, her lies to us the American people, her public stand and her private one only for the Wall Street big shots, selling the office of Secretary of State to the highest bidder. There is so much to distrust about her that I get such a sick feeling whenever I see or hear her name. Her corruption is revolting.
21 | Ken Cindy Tedesco | 1325693407526908_1325700404192875 | Please all Trump supporters . Pray for Donald Trump to expose Hillary for what she is ,a traitor to our country and that she refused to help Americans being murdered in Benghazi and their bodies dragged in the streets
22 | Buster Pleton | 1325693407526908_1325725467523702 | Uh oh, spoke to soon, he's becoming unraveled, and interrupted twice now. Though his tone is still good. No hollering.....yet.

The self-proclaimed "Trump troll extraordinaire" says Donald J. Trump  keeps talking about a "rigged election," because campaign CEO Steve Bannon wants to boost his business.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Kevin Lynch | 1325677634195152_1325680294194886 | Ok MSNBC, you have had every Trump camp manager include Pence on pre debate show now. I cannot take these bafoons. Trump wanted to make the last debate a Jerry Springer show so he brought everything on as he is throwing stones while living in a glass house.
2 | Cynthia Huhs | 1325677634195152_1325680897528159 | This isn't a DICTATORSHIP trump. As much as you'd like it to be. People's voices have a right to be heard, and so far, the smart ones can see right through a con-artist like YOU!!!
3 | Sergio Lorenz | 1325677634195152_1325680210861561 | The only thing that’s ‘rigged’ is a system that lets a billionaire pay zero taxes like this tramp Mr trump.
4 | Top Dollar Investment Group | 1325677634195152_1325681494194766 | Rudy Giuliani is wrong. Emails marked confidential is "not classified material" such as "Secret" or "Top Secret" because confidential email means just that: Intended for only certain people to see but it is not secret of top secret email. I'm tired of Republicans and all the Hillary haters trying to mislead the American public by insinuating that Hillary Clinton mishandled secret and top secret; aka: classified information. By saying she mishandled classified material is misleading to the general public. It's not a state of emergency or a national security issue.

6 | Cynthia Huhs | 1325677634195152_1325679904194925 | Funny how the media, and the system is rigged when it doesn't go Trump's way. Waaaahhhhhh!!!! What a LOSER!!!!
7 | Carlos DeCarvalho | 1325677634195152_1325683430861239 | Is it just me! Or Is it that most liberals are wired differently then most Americans? You intellectual Hillary supporters live in a bubble! Much like the DOME show. You don't get out beyond your neighborhood and friends. So, you only see what tv offers. Get out and touch real people, those who have been ravaged by Obamacare, the poor who are still living in limbo awaiting the promises the DNC gave 20 years ago and still haven't delivered! So, when I read the narrow mind intellectual liberals spew what they heard on tv. I feel for you, I understand, you are lost in your own little world of wealth and extravagance.
8 | Mark Deda | 1325677634195152_1325678000861782 | Ops wrong page 😜" I hear that train a comin’It’s rollin’ round the bend.Gonna pick up Mrs. ClintonAnd take her to the pen.They’ll have her coronationMake her cell block queenHillary for prisontwo thousand and sixteenThey’ve got an orange pants suitHangin’ on the wallAnd a cell for Bubba WillieJust a little down the hall.We’ll put ‘em in the big houseLock them up inside.Unless a whole lot of witnessesCommit suicide.Remember James McDougalAnd 20 or 30 moreAbout to testify, they found ‘em dead upon the floor.Now they’re pilin’ up the bodiesLike they did back thenThey want back in the White HouseHere we go again.Glue the china to the tableNail the table to the floorLock up all the silver‘fore they haul it out the doorWhite trash in the White HouseBeats all I’ve ever seen.Hillary for prisontwo thousand and sixteen
9 | Betsy Kardos | 1325677634195152_1325698124193103 | And Trump campaign is running a FB Live event plugging new network/online venture even as I type. How pathetically ignorant do viewers have to be for Fox "News" to not be biased and inaccurate enough?!
10 | Rebekah Jackson | 1325677634195152_1325681290861453 | Thank you Mark Cuban. Trump's run has been all about making money. Hey, all I'm seeing is Mike Pence- msnbc has waa-aaay too many trump surrogates. Hey, where's Tim Kaine, why don't you talk to him instead of the gas bag Pence.
11 | Glenn Boone | 1325677634195152_1325690927527156 | They need to asked Ben Ginsburg that when Pence said in his state their investigating 1000s of voter registration fraud. Then these voters are not on the registration rolls to vote because they are under investigation so how could their be voter fraud?
12 | Linda Heflin | 1325677634195152_1325692620860320 | Trump trolls go away, go away, go away. come again another day, not really, just go away. it is ops the wrong page and you will never get that song to catch on here with anyone but chris matthews. I am sure when the debate is over matthews will embarass himself and the network by announcing one more time that don the con won again.
13 | Carlos DeCarvalho | 1325677634195152_1325698097526439 | Liberals need to get your heads out of the sand, drive with your window open, see the people around you, stop turning away from the reality, facing poverty head on and do something about it? When was the last time you walked up to a poor person and hand them a $20 bill and said god bless you, knowing that you are far better off then they are! Liberals are self interest individuals who only see themselves and no one else! It sickens me!
14 | Julie Leonard Fleury | 1325677634195152_1325689354193980 | its funny they never report on hillarys wrongdoing there is so much to report but this brainwashed hillary Chanel report everyday on donald let me tell you donald has not done half what bill and hillary clinton did focus on these criminals
15 | Mary Linderberg | 1325677634195152_1325713814191534 | Nice try, but It amazes me that CBS, can do a five minute piece on voter fraud and dead people voting in Colorado but denounce Trumps claims of voter fraud as rhetoric...think about that a minute (or more).
16 | Lise Melin | 1325677634195152_1325682884194627 | Not by much. Bannon, a longtime conservative media executive, was the chairman of the far-right Breitbart News (source of many conspiracy theories), and now CEO of Trump's campaign.
17 | Kevin N Mary Stocker | 1325677634195152_1325683567527892 | Nevermind those videos of Democrat consultants that boasted how they rigged the elections or those DNC emails outlining the strategy how they rigged the election in Hillary's favor.
18 | Jobie Lyne Christy | 1325677634195152_1325710844191831 | Trump's own manager acknowledged Wednesday morning during an interview on MSNBC, that she doesn’t believe the election is rigged.“No, I do not believe" that there will be widespread voter fraud in the election, she said. “So absent overwhelming evidence that there is, it would not be for me to say that there is.”
19 | Luz Mark | 1325677634195152_1325696637526585 | They might as well had gotten Jerry Springer to moderate the last debate if Trump is bringing up garbage.. so adult and mature.. not👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽
20 | Mark Idzik | 1325677634195152_1325699360859646 | But Brian Williams was there he knows it all oh my God give me a break this guy's like he's even got a job but the reason they need him is because people listen to his crap even though its ratings are way down
21 | Brandon Horan | 1325677634195152_1325678327528416 | Well, Mark Cuban is no wrong. I'd choose a potato over Trump to run the office.
22 | Joe Mac | 1325677634195152_1325681097528139 | Trolls out in force! Hey trolls! If Trump is losing  why are they're so many over paid uninformed Lying trolls on every page? Why all the bashing? Why all the Lies? Why all the nonstop posting of the corrupt polls? Why??? Because you and your Saudi owned media are scared!
23 | Barry Lanehart | 1325677634195152_1325693154193600 | GOA said & NRA said that Hillary said she wants to take our Guns away...Amazing the US Supreme Court already ruled that no one, no lower governing authorities can deny ownership. They said no one can take away any gun.They called it a Constitutional Right even a 2nd Amendment Right. We don't need a Democratic Socialist Progressive dictator. Violating our Constitutional Rights.
24 | Cheryl Hall | 1325677634195152_1325698684193047 | We should all be talking about those emails, the collusion between the HRC camp and the State Department, the FBI, her lies to us the American people, her public stand and her private one only for the Wall Street big shots, selling the office of Secretary of State to the highest bidder. There is so much to distrust about her that I get such a sick feeling whenever I see or hear her name. Her corruption is revolting.
25 | Robert Cosenza | 1325677634195152_1325697400859842 | hillary lied and americans in bengazi died.th lying bengazi murderer ignored 600 requests for better security in bengazi and did what the lying bengazi murderer usually does ignored it,and americans in bengazi died.why not invite the 3 bengazi heros who fought there,who our kris tanto paronto and mark oz geist,also john tig tiegen,and invite the lying bengazi murderer,and have a live tv debate with hitlery and the 3 bengazi heros,and lets ask them if what hillary said is true,and continued to lie for weeks about it with susan rice,was it like hitlery said about a video,or was it like the 3 bengazi heros say a terrorists attack.which hitlery told her daughter that night,that it was a terrorists attack,but told the american people it was caused by a video,the clintons loot the white house,hillary asst huma abedin is along with her father and brother part of the muslum brotherhood terrorists,hillary laughs about defending child rapist.hillary lied about being under sniper fire.hillarys missing law firm billing records.33000 unaccounted emails,and many bleached bit,which means hillary didn,t want anyone to read them.hillary says shes for womens rights,but takes millions from saudia arabia and other like countries who have sharia and treat women horrible.the clinton foundation which keeps giving ,unfortuenately keeps giving to the clintons,only give 7% of there foundation money away,the rest they say goes for other things.hillarys radical pal saul alinsky.covering bills dirty deeds.vince fosters 1993 death.hillary cashes in,the iranian fundraiser.white water.emailgate pardongate chinagate travelgate.debate moderators allied with hillary.middle east with hillary a mess.isis formed and now is in over 30 countries.bill clintons criminal/mena connection,from when bill was governor of arkasaw and had the drug planes fly into mena airport and bring drugs,and drug money to be laundered,juanita broddrick who was raped by bill clinton,and hillary threatened juanita,kathleen willey gennifer flowers,carolyn moffet.paula jones.lencola sullivan.go trump everyone we know is voting for you.and trump is kiling hillary in the polls big time

1 | Crystal Morris | 1325666860862896_1325671190862463 | See thousands of black people marching the streets shouting Hillary kills black people, don't vote for her on Facebook page @mmblackout. You won't see this on mainstream media anywhere
2 | Tracy Curry Beam | 1325666860862896_1325671610862421 | Hillary can call women who were abused by her husband all sorts of horrible names. She has called people super predators, taco bowls, nurses as over paid babysitters and maids, basement dwellers, deplorables, retards, and so many other names. She also put our national security at risk, had her people destroy government property (server, communication devices, etc), lied to the American people so many times, lied to the FBI, gave uranium to Putin, wants open borders without vetting, and on on on on. So, will someone PLEASE explain to me why she should be POTUS? OH!! and she also stated to put a wall between USA and Mexico, but some seem to totally forget this.
3 | Mitchell Lawson | 1325666860862896_1325678400861742 | Don't know where MSNBC and CNN get thier Polls from . I don't keep up with TV media. I get mine from short wave radio from around the world. Their Polls say Trump will win by a landslide. Polls  took from 132 million people just 2 days ago.
4 | Jill White | 1325666860862896_1325677060861876 | Trump is attempting to completely bypass the media & bring his message directly to you, We The People. Please share this all over & tune in for the debate & post debate coverage. This is EXCLUSIVE coverage by RSBN & this will be covered via Trump's page, as well. Instead of listening to the media, tune in here.They are coordinating this special event with the Trump campaign.http://rsbn.tv/rsbn-live-exclusive-trump-campaign-holds-special-debate-pregamepostgame-shows/

6 | Top Dollar Investment Group | 1325666860862896_1325681864194729 | Rudy Giuliani is wrong. Emails marked confidential is "not classified material" such as "Secret" or "Top Secret" because confidential email means just that: Intended for only certain people to see but it is not secret of top secret email. I'm tired of Republicans and all the Hillary haters trying to mislead the American public by insinuating that Hillary Clinton mishandled secret and top secret; aka: classified information. By saying she mishandled classified material is misleading to the general public. It's not a state of emergency or a national security issue.

7 | Ken Cindy Tedesco | 1325666860862896_1325700520859530 | Please all Trump supporters . Pray for Donald Trump to expose Hillary for what she is ,a traitor to our country and that she refused to help Americans being murdered in Benghazi and their bodies dragged in the streets
8 | Ken Cindy Tedesco | 1325666860862896_1325692560860326 | Yes pray that the election is not rigged . Do you believe George Soros owns the voting booths ,they all should be pulled and not be able to use in this election or any election . This is why you see Hillary laughing at all us Americans . She knows no matter what Just like Bernie . Soros has guaranteed her no matter what ,he will get her to win . But as Pharo found out,he's about to know who is the great IAM. We all will be freed from Obama and Hillary and her cronies and enter into the promise land. God has been in control of this whole election and has used Americans and social media to expose Obama ,Hillary , George Soros and all her cronies.and the lying news media too. What Hillary and her cronies never realized for the first time Americans had to say who would be elected , not the cronies that are hoping on rigging the election. Way to go Americans . We finally stood up for each other and showed all Hillarie's Cronies. Don't mess with the USA . God is on our side and God bless America . Evg. Kenneth Tedesco. Romans 8-28

10 | Jim Tillman | 1325666860862896_1325679827528266 | C SPAN so we do not hear MSNBC crap. Tonight at 9 PM is too valuable to be wasted on MSNBC.
11 | Sue McClendon Noyes | 1325666860862896_1325677857528463 | Well you can tell who the people are that are trolling this page. Ugh. Just deplorable....
12 | Gaylon Nettles | 1325666860862896_1325670424195873 | THE LEFT WING MEDIA AND THEIR MODERATOR MOUTHPIECES....have made this a joke....
13 | Patricia Slice | 1325666860862896_1325679360861646 | So on TV they are interviewing the 2nd duck on the Republican ticket trying to salvage Donald. Talking out of both sides of his face. Jerk. Stop interviewing these losers.
14 | Thomas Paine | 1325666860862896_1325674974195418 | She's a bold-faced liar. And she is contemptuous of "everyday Americans." Today we find out Hillary deleted emails with Bryan Pagliano, the IT technician who managed her email server. Clinton had said she did not recall having any communication with Pagliano about maintaining her private email account
15 | Susan Borland | 1325666860862896_1325678367528412 | Wow that man was really a surprise eh? think he was a set up, starting right away with Trump

17 | Jane Rohan | 1325666860862896_1325680204194895 | Mike Pence is spewing lies about rigged elections. He is finished in national politics.

19 | Ken Cindy Tedesco | 1325666860862896_1325675164195399 | Thanks Hillary. Thanks Obama . There is no doubt. Obama is a Muslim plant . Who the Bush failed Presidency made it possible to fall for Obama's campaign line it's time for change .And all American new because of Bush took it bait line and sinker and believed Obama . The first people after Obama was sworn in went to talk to was the Muslims , who he told their plan had worked and they now had a Muslim in the White House and the plan to destroy America had begun and now their trying to elect Hillary to finish us off. Please don't let their plan work. Please vote for Trump if you like to keep your head on your shoulders.
20 | Ken Cindy Tedesco | 1325666860862896_1325670840862498 | Hey Hillary . Did I get this right ? James Comey's brother in law is Hillarie's  CPA . See everyone was involved in someway getting millions from the Clinton foundation . So all who are involved are covering it up, because Hillary cronies are saying if she goes down , we all go down . Yes the FBI and the Justice department where all quilts too.Thats why Loretta Lynch met with Bill Clinton on a private Jet . Not to discus their grandchildren , but how everyone was to cover thief butts, forgive me if I should not say butts . Conclusion. The whole DNC is guilty of corruption and that is why Hillary bleached her emails and smashed her I-phones with a hammer and changed her campaign song to if I had a hammer lol.What's crazy ,their are still people after she got rid of the evidence still want to vote for her. Go figure. Wow that's my scoop on it anyway.God bless

Smith spoke at the RNC, saying that she "personally" holds Hillary Clinton accountable for the death of her son, Sean, and blames her for "murdering" him.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Melinda Kreissler Boeh | 1325628107533438_1325631404199775 | And what about the thousands that died under Bush? That's always conveniently forgotten.
2 | Alan Moore | 1325628107533438_1325633984199517 | And yet after 6 Republican witch hunts on Benghazi, Clinton was found to have done no personal wrongdoing with this over politicized tragedy! Why not blame Republicans who cut funding for embassy security?
3 | Maryam Ensan | 1325628107533438_1325635314199384 | It is very sad how this lady has been exploited as a political pawn in all of this. I have watched her and really wish instead of being propped in spotlight she gets the mental health and grief support that she needs to heal.
4 | Betsy Kardos | 1325628107533438_1325636170865965 | Kids, this is what happens when someone never gets beyond the anger stage of grief. I feel sorry for her, but she's stuck in a very dark place.
5 | Connie Quigley | 1325628107533438_1325633387532910 | Trump is so focused on his surprise guests for the 'show' tonight, he couldn't care less about election issues....lets see how little he actually knows.
6 | Nancy Medley | 1325628107533438_1325636117532637 | I understand this woman grieves the loss of her son, but blaming Hillary for his death is just not warranted. She was not responsible for the decisions that led to the attack and deaths of the 4 Americans that night. She has apologized and taken responsibility over and over and over. There have been hours and hours of inquiries with no proof of wrongdoing on her part.  Many more incidents like Benghazi happened during the 2nd Bush administration and NO ONE blamed Bush. I can guarantee that Hillary will do everything she can to ensure that it doesn't happen again. Those responsible for the death of Patricia Smith's son is the terrorists that killed him. Period.
7 | Glen Nemeroff | 1325628107533438_1325631480866434 | Ambassador Stevens needlessly put the lives of 3 others in danger when he decided to travel without adequate security. No one will say this, but it is the fact.
8 | Susan Bayer | 1325628107533438_1325637634199152 | I am sorry for your loss But Hilary Clinton did not kill your son Puleeeze Even Ambassador Stevens mother does not blame her and does not want to be a political pawn The Republicans failed to fund the embassies Please get a gripYou are Wrong!
9 | Charlene McMillan | 1325628107533438_1325634844199431 | So stupid Hillary is too much of a lady to bring out all those women that Trump molested. I just want someone to make sure that trump blows his nose tonight and can someone put Ruby in a home he is lost his mind too.
10 | Wendy Docter | 1325628107533438_1325633747532874 | I am very sorry this lady lost her son,but she has to look at the whole picture, there were more people that have to share this blame, not just Hillary...look deep, and start with the people that voted not to give money to the cause.
11 | Fran Marquez | 1325628107533438_1325636147532634 | I really hate to say this but this lady needs to deal with her grief out of the public eye. If Trump is paying her for her appearances, she is profiting from her son's death. I truly hope not.
12 | Martha Knittel | 1325628107533438_1325635054199410 | She's a heart broken mom but Hillary is not blame. President bush cut the security at Benghazi not Clinton.  We had over 60 Americans die at embassy's under Bush...none blame anybody? Why? , it's all politicalized against Hillary and her presidential run..
13 | Geoff Krickhan | 1325628107533438_1325633724199543 | Stupid woman dishonors her son's memory by allowing herself to be used like a pawn by the GOP... the ones who CUT the funding for  Embassy defense!
14 | Crystal Leatherman | 1325628107533438_1325636774199238 | Ali Nayyef I'm so disgusted with him exploiting this woman's pain. She hold HRC accountable but there is never any mention of how the GOP congress failed on the vote to add more embassy security.
15 | Beth Kamphaus Knotts | 1325628107533438_1325638484199067 | She's a mourning mother and needs to blame someone.  More than 23 million dollars spent on congressional and senate investigations and hearings to no avail. The Trump campaign is using her grief.
16 | Joanne D McKay | 1325628107533438_1325634650866117 | Is there no depths lower than pondscum to which Trump will travel to, to go so low as to use this woman's pain and grief for mere political purposes. It's so sad.
17 | Dennis Bryon | 1325628107533438_1325638667532382 | “As Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens’s mother, I am writing to object to any mention of his name and death in Benghazi, Libya, by Donald Trump’s campaign and the Republican Party,” Mary Commanday said in a letter-to-the-editor published in the New York Times on Saturday.“I know for certain that Chris would not have wanted his name or memory used in that connection. I hope that there will be an immediate and permanent stop to this opportunistic and cynical use by the campaign.”Republicans have repeatedly criticized presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton for the way she handled the Benghazi attack as then-Secretary of State.Commanday’s request echoes the sentiments of Stevens’ sister, Anne Stevens, who said she doesn’t blame Clinton for her brother’s death and doesn’t “see any usefulness in continuing to criticize her.”“I do not blame Hillary Clinton or [Former Secretary of Defense] Leon Panetta,” she said in an interview with the New Yorker last month. “They were balancing security efforts at embassies and missions around the world. And their staffs were doing their best to provide what they could with the resources they had.”
18 | Deatra S Cragg | 1325628107533438_1325638910865691 | The woman is so filled with hate it is just sad. I recently looked at a Benghazi timeline of events.....it's time Republicans dealt with the truth ..... I'm not sure they are capable of it, tho...Thirty years of lies and hate. I think it's baked in! They've been lying for so long they think it is the truth and they continue to try and make Hillary pay!
19 | Suiyoobi Allen | 1325628107533438_1325648417531407 | Clinton and Obama asked the REPUBLICANS for more money for Benghazi security. As they did with  everything Obama asked for, the REPUBLICANS instead, drastically CUT funding for Benghazi security. Poor confused lady. The shoulder she cries on is attached to the arm that holds the smoking gun. The GOP.
20 | Jose Daniel Vargas Torres | 1325628107533438_1325636594199256 | That is really pathetic, blaming someone, that doesn't have anything to do with her son death. If he die then it was his time, God took your son stop blaming others like Trump does everyday
21 | Jim Dorin | 1325628107533438_1325645320865050 | This lady should ask the Republicans why they cut funding for security at the embassies. Also she should be asking why Republicans will cut veterans benefits in a second, but won't tax a billionaire a nickel more!
22 | Oscar Northington | 1325628107533438_1325639500865632 | More discussing and unconscionably deplorable tactics by Donald J Trump's Campaign.  Go Hillary Clinton!  She's the only candidate who is totally prepared and ready to assume the presidency.  Don't waste your vote by  voting for a third party candidate whose chances are razor thin.  Vote blue up and down the ballot from courthouse to White House.  Vote the divisive, obstructionist, do-nothing GOP out!

24 | Bill Adams | 1325628107533438_1325669990862583 | Well, this woman has a right to embrace her pain in any way she'd like. I think hundreds of hours done to try to pin this on Secretary Clinton show a partisan goal that is unreasonable.
25 | Candy Cole Dylla | 1325628107533438_1325656440863938 | Apparently those 4500+ American troops DICK CHENEY murdered and used their blood shed as a 39.5 BILLION DOLLAR War profiteer doesn't matter to her or Chumps cult.  Besides the other family members of the 3 others blame who is actually responsible - repubs/Tparty majority controlled House of Reps who wouldn't pass a EMBASSY SECURITY SECURITY bill in 2011.

Nevada’s Culinary Union is building what it calls a “wall of taco trucks,” outside Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas. #tacotrucksoneverycorner

1 | Malo Azizi | 1325590790870503_1325596904203225 | Great that's Orange face Wall. 🐖 🐖 Trump is disgrace to America.💩Clueless, No dignity or morals= Trump campaign. 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻Bigot,Lyin,Desperate, we have all heard Trump narcissist, misogyny, white suptremist, thin skinned reactions to bully anyone in his way. A slew of law suits for fraud at Trump Universaty, many bankruptcies ( just take the money & run) , draft dodger, failed marriages & draft dodger. No experience, no plan. Just "believe me", I know more than the military Generals. Trump products all made out of the USA. Don't forget the conspiracy behind everything. Can't wait till this fool disappears into the hole he crawled out of.#NEVERTRUMP
2 | Johnathan Shaw | 1325590790870503_1325603990869183 | Yessssssss but not only around Donald Hitler Trump Sr places but on every corner in the United States of America!! That would be awesome and when the teatarts and Retarded Republican Party ppls don't feel like cooking breakfast in the mornings,  well Taco Trucks would be handy!
3 | Susan Earp Daulton | 1325590790870503_1325619070867675 | Trump is a sleaz bag no wonder the high society turned their backs on him.. Trump doesn't have an ounce of class about him nor his sleazy porn wife.. Worse than trailer trash
4 | Tim Farnan | 1325590790870503_1325621327534116 | When is MSNBC going to retire or fire Chris Mathews? Every single time Joy Reed spoke, he loudly talked over her. He is nonsense, out of touch, ridiculous, and probably one of the worst "journalists" on TV.
5 | Don Brewer | 1325590790870503_1325618670867715 | Nice. Trump got his wall (although not as high as he wanted). It was paid for and constructed by Mexicans (which he promised), He can see the wall out his window, when he stays there, thus saving money by being his own ICE Security. And, today only, he can eat all the free taco bowls he wants.
6 | Tina Marie Sulphur | 1325590790870503_1325591490870433 | Native American & I love it! We all know Mexicans were here first too!
7 | Leslie Cuffe Deeds | 1325590790870503_1325652437531005 | And I  don't mind if  the Debate doesn't start out with a handshake (that would be proof that they are hypocrites ) so go ahead Hilary make my day and walk up and grab him where his brain is
8 | Gregory Lamberson | 1325590790870503_1325618740867708 | QUESTION: Why does Chris Matthews even bother to have Joy Reid on Hardball with Chris Matthews when all he daoes is talk over her and talk down to her whenever she's making a strong point?
9 | Gary Vandiver | 1325590790870503_1325603750869207 | He can't win! He has insulted to many people and a child molester besides that? Hell no! Vote for a human being.. #Clinton2016
10 | Mary Mowry | 1325590790870503_1325696717526577 | Never knew this site and CNN were blatant political arms of the Crooked Hillary campaign.  I never see the picture of her campaign bus dumping excrement on the side of the road in Georgia,, Never see the new allegation of sexual assault by Bill Clinton, Never see that Obama's own brother is voting for Trump. Where are the negative Crooked Hillary stories!!!
11 | Mary Linderberg | 1325590790870503_1325603607535888 | Regardless how you feel about Trump. We are in a fight for America!  I don't like some of his characteristics, but I cannot abide open boarders, a woman who openly lies and supports the Muslim Brotherhood, a stacked supreme court that will definitely cancel out the 2nd amendment, and expanded government control over all aspects of our lives!
12 | Lisaiam Estrada | 1325590790870503_1325706444192271 | Such a shameful way to express your opinion on this issue ,by the way if Hillary wins you can kiss America goodbye because they are planning to hand it all over to the united Nations and we'll continue with the dictatorship in presidency until were all working for them and their pointless war's
13 | Tracy Curry Beam | 1325590790870503_1325592944203621 | Hillary can call women who were abused by her husband all sorts of horrible names. She has called people super predators, taco bowls, nurses as over paid babysitters and maids, basement dwellers, deplorables, retards, and so many other names. She also put our national security at risk, had her people destroy government property (server, communication devices, etc), lied to the American people so many times, lied to the FBI, gave uranium to Putin, wants open borders without vetting, and on on on on. So, will someone PLEASE explain to me why she should be POTUS? OH!! She also had stated that there should be a wall between USA and Mexico, but how quickly some forget this.
14 | Anthony J. Achée | 1325590790870503_1325638857532363 | This isn't a protest. This is a marketing ploy to help build their businesses. They don't really care what trump had to say. It's really a good marketing strategy. Kudos guys.
15 | Carlos DeCarvalho | 1325590790870503_1325698204193095 | Liberals need to get your heads out of the sand, drive with your window open, see the people around you, stop turning away from the reality, facing poverty head on and do something about it? When was the last time you walked up to a poor person and hand them a $20 bill and said god bless you, knowing that you are far better off then they are! Liberals are self interest individuals who only see themselves and no one else! It sickens me!
16 | Carlos DeCarvalho | 1325590790870503_1325683654194550 | Is it just me! Or Is it that most liberals are wired differently then most Americans? You intellectual Hillary supporters live in a bubble! Much like the DOME show. You don't get out beyond your neighborhood and friends. So, you only see what tv offers. Get out and touch real people, those who have been ravaged by Obamacare, the poor who are still living in limbo awaiting the promises the DNC gave 20 years ago and still haven't delivered! So, when I read the narrow mind intellectual liberals spew what they heard on tv. I feel for you, I understand, you are lost in your own little world of wealth and extravagance.
17 | Carlos DeCarvalho | 1325590790870503_1325637817532467 | Americans have lost the purpose of a democracy! It's not about the party! It's about how hard our future president will work, contribute for the future of our country, the direction we want our democracy to continue with honesty, integrity and morality. We have lost it all. Trump out works Hillary 5-1 he's has a great work ethic, and has created prosperity for his family.  Hillary has made her life at using our political system for her personal gain, using political office for personal gain while being paid by the citizens of this country. Her track record has not been glorious or spectacular.  I'm voting for Trump because I work hard for little I have, and respect those who work just as hard!
18 | Sharon Lee | 1325590790870503_1325602664202649 | The KKK Newspapers just supported trump. When I first moved from Detroit to Tennessee. That was the first time I actually saw them in outfits and all taking up a collection in West Tennessee. My mother-in-law was driving and stoped and gave on the  two lane road . I was like shocked. They did come on time after the riots to our house in Detroit and dressed in suites wanting him to join their cause.
19 | Tom Blackwell | 1325590790870503_1325837477512501 | Now - Go have a taco. The trucks have lined up. It's across from the mall & entrance to Nordstroms. (You won't find a casino in this Las Vegas hotel.)
20 | Katie Johnson | 1325590790870503_1325755427520706 | OMG! Trump on the Access Hollywood tape, that he didn't even apologize to his wife because he didn't do anything to apologize for. Melania said to Anderson HE VERY MUCH APOLIGIZED! So is she lying or is he lying? Also Ivanka said he apologized to her as well. HMMMM lying runs deep in that Trump family!
21 | Sharon Lee | 1325590790870503_1325645914198324 | I have all kinds of people on my facebook page. Muslims to Just about every nationality. Very respective and nice people. We are made up of a lot of nationalities and people from all different races. What Trump deep down hates. But flip flopping to do anything for a vote. He is what they use to call a con a good snake oil salesman.
22 | Sharon Lee | 1325590790870503_1325637234199192 | Her father, a larger-than-life personality who reminds her childhood friends of Donald Trump, belonged to the Communist Party, an exclusive club whose members sometimes joined because of career ambitions as much as ideology. http://www.staradvertiser.com/2016/07/19/nyt/melania-trump-from-small-town-slovenia-to-doorstep-of-white-house/   (Usually what you are taught by your parents is what you deep down believe in. )
23 | Monica Maquiling | 1325590790870503_1325646757531573 | Should also place them all around New Yorks voting places where trump and fily will be voting. A little solidarity for his hotel workers.
24 | Chuck Anthony Brulet | 1325590790870503_1325665904196325 | I love the ignorance of sheeple fed by the Media, Proof that Clinton is Corrupt, yet they want to harp on Trump over Hear Say, not proof, Hear Say does not hold up in court, Stupid people led by Propaganda.
25 | Mitchell Lawson | 1325590790870503_1325606167535632 | You Hilary Supporters are being deceived daily. A vote for Hilary is a vote for Bill Clinton, Bill has been impeached from the White House, by law he should not be able to return to the Hill as First lady or First man, he sourly is not a Gentleman. Just another way for Bill to sneak through the back door with 30 more years of Hell in the Unites of America.

U.S. officials concluded Assange is a willing participant in a Russian intelligence operation to undermine the U.S. presidential election by leaking private emails from members of the Hillary Clinton campaign.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Sally Perkins Johnson | 1325576464205269_1325585140871068 | Assange is like an unwanted house guest who refuses to leave. After the novelty wore off, I'll bet   Ecuadorean officials were probably tired of him taking up embassy space and sponging off them for years. They probably were looking for a way to gently nudge him along.
2 | Jimbo Kowal | 1325576464205269_1325583440871238 | This actually makes me proud.  What should a government do in a case where a nut keeps breaking US law by stealing electronic documents and then further breaking the law by interfering with an election?
3 | Armando Muñoz | 1325576464205269_1325587414204174 | I think at one point in the beginning he was doing good exposing governments for their misdeeds however I believe the power has gone go his head and is now manipulating if not downright manufacturing evidence for his own agenda. Absolute power corrupts absolutely.
4 | Ryan Alexander Menne | 1325576464205269_1325598220869760 | So Assange puts Republicans on blast = he's a hero.He puts the dems on blast = he's a villainous Russian agent who has gone too far.How convenient for you small minded sheeple.
5 | Devvon Mayherrun | 1325576464205269_1325581414204774 | The new red scare, Hillaryism. Undermine the election? More like exposing it for the sham that it is. #PodestaEmails #DNCLeaks
6 | Cecilia Naulls-Hamilton | 1325576464205269_1325588687537380 | Its about time someone forced someone to handle him... he's nothing more than a oily egg-head terrorist, trying to hijack the world for his personal vanity... at this point, I dont believe anything his leakage puts out... everyone knows how to white wash emails... if goofy Trump knows how to do it, anyone can do it...
7 | Keyonna Goines Watson | 1325576464205269_1325596147536634 | LMBO If anyone believe this they have completely lost their minds! I have never in my life seen something so corrupt..Jesus we all going to die... The American people is officially Brainwashed! Smh
8 | Harold Monkres | 1325576464205269_1325587450870837 | The Trumpsters are talking civil war ,when Clinton wins. They better send out the National Guard and arrest Trump for promoting sedition , if his people go over the line! I am tired of this crap!
9 | Billy Maggiore | 1325576464205269_1325592874203628 | But-aren't they just emails about yoga routines-and wedding plans? Hillary said she turned over all work related emails-right?..she wouldn't lie-would she?...(I did not have sex with that woman,ms Lewinsky)
10 | Paul Altum | 1325576464205269_1325602170869365 | Ahhhhh i love the smell of hypocrisy in the morning! This guy was your hero when he was slinginh truth against bush but now that he is exposing your gal he is a villian that is releasing falsehoods rights? Lol drooling stupid people.
11 | Stephen Suba | 1325576464205269_1325605987535650 | Keep brainwashing people. When Assange/Wiki leaks were exposing Bush's war emails then Assange/Wiki leaks were Heros but now when he is exposing Clintons and governments top level corruption now he is Russian spy...
12 | Keith Fulton | 1325576464205269_1325587484204167 | Ecuador did this on their own Assange has worn out his welcome & got his wifi yanked They want to be friendly to the next Admin because their oil profits are in the tank & they have an election next year
13 | Christian Justice | 1325576464205269_1325641294198786 | Assange is a threat to every American, he steals and hacks governments information that could potentially lead to a parasite like Putin to develop technologies & strategies to attack us and know our flaws in the systems.. Overall, Assange is a danger to every citizen who has no idea what our enemies want to do against us. Putin is playing the strings and is NOT for us.
14 | David Middleton | 1325576464205269_1325594234203492 | So embarrassed for our country and how ignorant people are. If you care about who was responsible rather than what is in the emails you're an idiot. Even the Republican establishment is like "don't hold it against Hillary because we might be next". Washington is corrupt!  Quit being enablers and supporting the corruption. Sheep!
15 | Veto Villanova | 1325576464205269_1325605677535681 | Why wasn't he going after Trumpf's emails as well? There's an obvious plot to try to discredit one candidate and not the other. I'm sure dirt can be found on most politicians but Assange has a vendetta against the Clintons and it hadn't really turned up much to begin with.
16 | Nancy Bohannon | 1325576464205269_1325652460864336 | So do tell NBC. I see you've noted a motive for this alleged alliance. Is the conjecture on your part or did Assange and Russia give you the intel to figure this out? Motive without any profit seems empty and unproductive. Always steering public opinion. There are a ton os suckers who buy your bs.
17 | Mitchell Bonga | 1325576464205269_1325644600865122 | Why do people condemn WikiLeaks, but not the information they are revealing? No matter who obtained the information, it should enrage folks that the Democrats are using us as pawns? Clinton says politicians should have a public and private view, environmental activists should get a life, and so on. This ignorance to the truth is what compelled me to leave the party and join the Green Party. Now is the time to build a third party alternative in this nation free from corporate influence.
18 | David Dowler | 1325576464205269_1325622947533954 | So hidden videos exposing things is usually ok except when it exposes the democratic party doing illegal things. Then we have a guy who gets ahold of supposedly deleted emails, exposes all sorts of corruption and we go after the whistleblower? I imagine he will be dead of apparent suicide in a few weeks......this is all a power move to avoid any more damaging info gets released on Hillary. He should have just released it all, hopefully he has a backup plan that he sent on twitter as ebcrypted keysm...
19 | Tracy Moser Quebral | 1325576464205269_1325612860868296 | You and your "reporters" are pathetic. You should be ashamed, but you are too full of your bloated establishment egos. Stephanie Ruhle was horrible to Kellyanne Conway. You are not a news organization. You are a hit job organization working for a government mafia! Honestly, did you watch it back? Can you honestly say that you and Mrs. Ruhle are not biased in this election? Thing is, you don't even care anymore. You're not even pretending. What do you stand to gain from Killary winning this election? Is she threatening you? You should be ashamed, but you have no morality, so I'm sure you're not. Disgusting! More and more, our own (Buffalo's own) Tim Russert must be rolling over in his grave. He would never stand for what you do now!
20 | Nathan Westergreen | 1325576464205269_1325674504195465 | The US Government, corrupt media and Democrats are trying to rig this election by silencing opposition to their open border globalists agenda... This is starting to look a lot like a Dictatorship these days... Pathetic and disgraceful... Wearing RED and voting TRUMP on 11/8...
21 | Bart Perry | 1325576464205269_1325663450863237 | In Guvspeak, another federal agency pressured Ecuador "While our concerns about WikiLeaks are longstanding, any suggestion that Secretary (John) Kerry or the State Department were involved in shutting down WikiLeaks is false," State Department spokesman John Kirby said in a statement.
22 | Chloe Gates | 1325576464205269_557561754437784 | He's staying in the Ecuador embassy in Great Britain thing is there are elections going on in Ecuador right now and he will probably will be kicked out if the currant President loses. The people are so upset about their country protecting Assange who is wanted for espionage and rape and the fact he is trying to impact the results of the election in America. The Ecuador people want him kick out and for him to face the laws of the land.
23 | Eva Zseller-Karlsen | 1325576464205269_1325633917532857 | Stop the lies MSNBC. Klinton's Magia set this all up with a CA company owned by Soros. Get off your high horse. Assange is doing the world a favor for revealing the truth. Something you forgot to do long ago ! How was the dinner at the Podestas?
24 | Jeff Governale | 1325576464205269_1325610767535172 | Democrats don't like it when their dirt gets exposed to the world LoL. Quit playing like your holier than thou, your party is as dirty as they come.
25 | Becca Dady | 1325576464205269_557586641101962 | I find it interesting that Assange has been accused of rape at least twice that I am aware of. It would seem he supports Don the Con. I guess douchebags have to stick together.

Hillary Clinton has opened up a sizable lead in the key battleground state, which happens to be hosting tonight's presidential debate.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Gregg Shaw | 1325563497539899_1325564707539778 | So Trump is planning on bringing President Obama's estranged half-brother Malik Obama to tonight's debate; an anti-gay polygamist who's affiliated with Hamas and is admittedly jealous of Obama's success. I'm struggling to understand the strategy here, but...ok?
2 | Adam Minnix | 1325563497539899_1325570254205890 | Trump 2016! The bias of MSNBC is insane. It's basically a hate network with no true journalism. It's a pro Hillary anti-Trump station that has no equality. Whoever watches this network consistently and believes its content has a few screws loose.
3 | Tracy Moser Quebral | 1325563497539899_1325614377534811 | You and your "reporters" are pathetic. You should be ashamed, but you are too full of your bloated establishment egos.

4 | Beatrice Rohde | 1325563497539899_1325599664202949 | Has anyone noticed that before (past 16 years), in person voter fraud was 31 out of 1 billion. Since Tramp stated fog horning to his supporters multiple instances of voter fraud have showed up. Dead people voting in Colorado, some kind of name or date difference investigation in Indiana and the NC GOP office that had stored boxes of already filled out mail ballots. No political office should have mail in ballots. They are mailed back to the central office by the recipients. It was revealed by GOP by accident after the fire damage done to that office. It's a felony to have those ballots in your possession. All of a sudden with Tramp deciding he could only lose if things are rigged things begin to happen. The republicans seem to be the ones doing the rigging. Oh yah, republicans are in charge of the voting machinery in at least 31 states. Curiouser and curiouser.
5 | Alissa Foerster | 1325563497539899_1325571750872407 | Too bad we can't trust your news or polling! It will be interesting if this bites you all in the butt!

9 | CJ Reid | 1325563497539899_1325609347535314 | The juvenile antics never end--the planned 'stunts' for tonite's debate are more proof that a certain male candidate for president would have to jump up real high just to scratch the belly of a rattlesnake!
10 | Juancarlos Danger | 1325563497539899_1325563860873196 | Arizona’s Obamacare marketplace rates are set to skyrocket as the state’s two remaining insurers in the marketplace raise their rates 50-75 percent.Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona will sell marketplace plans in every county but Maricopa, hiking rates up to 51 percent while Centene Corp. will sell “Ambetter” plans in every county in the state with rate increases of up to 74.5 percent, according to the Arizona Republic.
11 | Rebecca Anne Inkster | 1325563497539899_1325585330871049 | It's less than 3 weeks until the election, we CAN'T get complacent now. There is STILL a VERY real chance that Trump could actually win. I know that the polls look like he has no chance, but so did Brexit, we HAVE to assume that he can win and that we MUST maintain a sense of urgency that each of us vote. Get out there, get friends and family to the polls and VOTE! Talk to people, express how important this is. We can't afford to get too comfortable that we don't get out there, Dems have a habit of not voting when it matters. It happened when the GOP took Congress, it absolutely can happen now. Don't assume the polling numbers will insure a victory, don't let your guard down now. We are a mere 20 days out from the end, anything can happen. PLEASE, take this DEADLY seriously, everything is riding on this, including the future of our nation. Get out and VOTE!!!!VOTE OR LOSE EVERYTHING YOU HOLD DEAR! And did I mention...VOTE??!!!!Share the hell out of this.And VOTE!
12 | Marti Salvato | 1325563497539899_1325642377532011 | boy howdy but there are sure a lot people (or bots, hard to tell) who apparently hate it here telling the rest of us how much they hate here. NEWSFLASH: very easy to leave.
13 | Titanium Pierre | 1325563497539899_1325606657535583 | Yeah trump was so stupid to teach people how to pronounce the name of their own State 😜! He is a disaster and thinks he knows more than anyone else!
14 | Bryan Bonser | 1325563497539899_1325638854199030 | Why I'm voting for TrumpSix key policy differences inform my decision.First, and most important, the Supreme Court. For anyone concerned about the Bill of Rights — free speech, religious liberty, the Second Amendment — the Court hangs in the balance. We are only one justice away from losing our most basic rights, and the next president will appoint as many as four new justices. We know, without a doubt, that every Clinton appointee would be a left-wing ideologue. Trump, in contrast will appoint justices “in the mold of Scalia.”Trump has a very strong list of potential Supreme Court nominees — including Sen. Mike Lee, who would make an extraordinary justice — and making an explicit commitment to nominate only from that list. This commitment matters, and it provides a serious reason for voters to choose to support Trump.Second, Obamacare. The failed healthcare law is hurting millions of Americans. If Republicans hold Congress, leadership has committed to passing legislation repealing Obamacare. Clinton, we know beyond a shadow of doubt, would veto that legislation. Trump has will sign it.Third, energy. Clinton would continue the Obama administration’s war on coal and relentless efforts to crush the oil and gas industry. Trump will reduce regulations and allow the blossoming American energy renaissance to create millions of new high-paying jobs.Fourth, immigration. Clinton will continue and even expand Obama’s lawless executive amnesty. Trump will revoke those illegal executive orders.Fifth, national security. Clinton will continue the Obama administration’s willful blindness to radical Islamic terrorism. She will continue importing Middle Eastern refugees whom the FBI cannot vet to make sure they are not terrorists. Trump has will stop the deluge of unvetted refugees and secure our borders.Sixth, Internet freedom. Clinton supports Obama’s plan to hand over control of the Internet to an international community of stakeholders, including Russia, China, and Iran. Just this week, Trump came out strongly against that plan, and in support of free speech online.These are six vital issues where the candidates’ positions present a clear choice for the American people.
15 | Denise Russo Carter | 1325563497539899_1325745740855008 | Go Hillary, kick his butt!! He keeps saying the same thing over and over again, because that is all he knows!!
16 | Catherine Boylan | 1325563497539899_1325773974185518 | OMG...Trump Is telling Wallace he's wrong...and Aleppo is destroyed because of Hillary Clinton...He should have laid off the coke tonight....He's all over gthe place....

What Hillary Clinton won by 12 points? The Media is so full of crap.. With all that Hillary has lied about, the emails, etc do y'all not see that she does not need to be our President..
18 | Cheryl Hall | 1325563497539899_1325653397530909 | We should all be talking about those emails, the collusion between the HRC camp and the State Department, the FBI, her lies to us the American people, her public stand and her private one only for the Wall Street big shots, selling the office of Secretary of State to the highest bidder. There is so much to distrust about her that I get such a sick feeling whenever I see or hear her name. Her corruption is revolting.

24 | Kevin D. Johnson | 1325563497539899_1325569377539311 | The trump train wreck continues. Hillary wins in a landslide. Democrats retake the senate and quite possibly the house. Who knew this is what he meant by making America great again?  LOL!

Taco trucks on every corner? Almost. 

A "wall" of taco trucks has lined up outside of the Trump International Las Vegas hotel to protest against Donald J. Trump ahead of tonight's presidential debate.

1 | Tonio Birbiglia | 1539819662704725_1539835079369850 | Well Trump said he would do it and he did it. He got the Mexicans to build a wall. So what if it's in Las Vegas and made of taco trucks!
2 | Brian Hosier | 1539819662704725_1539840489369309 | As a Las Vegan I'm very proud of this show of solidarity. Trump is an egotistical bigot that cares about no one but Trump. He always blames others for his own short comings (and there are many). Can't wait until to see him go down in flames!
3 | Carol Ross | 1539819662704725_1539821419371216 | Outstanding!!!!  Maybe it'll also let him reconsider that he hires mostly all illegal immigrants for his hotels & to maintain his golf courses, plus pays them dirt wages w/ no benefits!!!
4 | Kao Lee-Hinds | 1539819662704725_1539825269370831 | Lol! I'm sure all those people who wants to kick out all the immigrants are gonna line up for tacos! Cuz you know what? Tacos are pretty much an american staple!
5 | Steve Bishop | 1539819662704725_1539820929371265 | People are not voting for Trump the established politician, they are voting for Trump the American who wants jobs and a secure border. This message or candidate does not need to be delivered the tradition political polished manner. Watch and learn.
6 | Pat Cincotta | 1539819662704725_1539855102701181 | Trump has built his empire on taking advantage of people, whether they were investors or employees or students at his ridiculous "university." I salute the wall of taco trucks protesting Trump's refusal to allow his employees to vote on organizing. Solidarity!
7 | Shane Harness | 1539819662704725_1539828442703847 | If this isn't more of a reason to vote for Trump I don't know what is. What are they protesting less secure borders and easier ways to bring drugs over. Unless you're an illegal immigrant you have nothing to worry about
8 | Diana Fisher | 1539819662704725_1539824256037599 | WAY TO GO...now lets not BOOK ANY HOTELS OR ROOMS WITH TRUMPS NAME ON THEM!
9 | Anna Ray | 1539819662704725_1539860052700686 | Okay. To the dim bulbs who didn't read or listen to this story, workers at tRump hotel in Las Vegas voted in 2015 to unionize. Trump won't negotiate with the union. That's what the taco trucks are protesting.
10 | Liliana Gonzales | 1539819662704725_1539828332703858 | When you're accustomed to privelage equality feels like oppression. Trump is a mentally unstable degenerate who is clearly unqualified to be president of the united states. #HillYes. #VoteBlue!!! 🇺🇸👸🎓🙏😀🌮
11 | Patrick Kerr | 1539819662704725_1539849512701740 | He wants illegal aliens deported, yet he hires them to work on his buildings.  He bemoans the fact that all of our jobs seem to be going over seas, yet he has his ties made in China.  He says the rich guys need to pay their fair share of taxes, but yet he is a billionaire and pays ZERO.  Such a hypocrite this guy.
12 | Pia Halmen | 1539819662704725_1539913269362031 | I wish we had taco trucks here in Toronto!  And also, why would u stay at the Tangerine Grifters hotel in Vegas?  He's so shady even Sin City wants nothing to do with him so they denied him gambling license!
13 | Cherrie Diaz | 1539819662704725_1539884926031532 | OMG I LOVE it!! Wonder if Trump ever got a casino at that hotel? When we were visiting there, they were building the hotel & a manager where we were staying next door laughed, saying the state of Nev. refused to give him a gaming license!!!
14 | Dale Whiting | 1539819662704725_1539854419367916 | Oh what I would give to have a few tacos! You don't suppose TheDonald would consider franchising his name to tacos do you? "South of the border tacos by Donald Trump". He could build a bridge over his fence and charge extra to import them into the US!
15 | James Radford | 1539819662704725_1539907679362590 | Wow really dumb people. How many illegals are down town now. Wise up people we can't afford anymore illegals or immigrants period. Trump all day. Hilary is a liar
16 | Jason Alvarez | 1539819662704725_1539861052700586 | I saw four trucks there not protesting there selling tacos hello!!! Why not capitalize.  That's the American way for now. Vote TRUMP or kiss these opportunities goodbye!
17 | Janet Mabey | 1539819662704725_1539828472703844 | this is why we need a wall they are just making it easier for Americans to vote for Trump why can they not act like they are happy to be here in The USA and be apart of us instead of this stupid act of civil disobedience which does not help them and only brings attention to them
18 | Modesta Tenay | 1539819662704725_1539842672702424 | Wonder how much they cost... guess not too much to last a day. Do you wonder how much it cost you and me if the people who paid you are in office. It will last our lifetime and more because of future generations. Vote right now and it will be a better one because not only you will be legalized but you will enjoy the dream you have come and stayed here for. No other law will be over your head except the Constitution you have known who guarantees the rights we enjoy.
19 | Holly Hart | 1539819662704725_1539891142697577 | What was ironic about the comment that started this whole thing is that Republicans emphasize the importance of capitalism and entrepreneurship in the U.S., so for a Hispanic GOPer to warn about HIS dominant culture imposing on the U.S. with taco trucks -- small businesses --  actually just shows how compatible Hispanic immigrants are with existing U.S. culture.
20 | Stephanie Phillips | 1539819662704725_902555499888896 | I am telling you, two words "shimmer lights." It could save you & good tacos. That's it, so hard to part with,  ut you vould have mines. Peace!
21 | Carole Mayo | 1539819662704725_902568033220976 | I cannot stand the man, but now that they have rounded themselves up, this is a perfect opportunity to load them up in their own taco truck and escort the straight to the border and across the bridge, never allowed to return since coming here illegally was the first law they broke here.
22 | Eric Relph | 1539819662704725_593471797519553 | If we sheeple have not figured it out, there is only one party - a Liberal party. A party that wants the Utopia by taking it out of people's pockets without their permission and a few at the top in control of everything including the press. That is Liberal Progressive Socialist speak for Communism.
23 | Mindy Lou Simms | 1539819662704725_902550093222770 | Good for them....they have been pandered to so well by the left they  don't realize that the election is rigged...Hillary wins, they wasted their time and fuel to do this???? lol...have fun with your one party rule..with the dems in control....see California....now the rest of the country will look like that with out the great weather.
24 | Mary Mowry | 1539819662704725_902557753222004 | CNN and MSNBC are blatant political arms of the Crooked Hillary campaign.  I never see the picture of her campaign bus dumping excrement on the side of the road in Georgia,, Never see the new allegation of sexual assault by Bill Clinton, Never see that Obama's own brother is voting for Trump. Where are the negative Crooked Hillary stories!!!
25 | Amy Barlow Michaels | 1539819662704725_902512653226514 | They should be there for Hillary. Remember she refers to Latino voters as "Taco Bowl Outreach". In the 90's Clinton campaign ran on deportation of all illegal aliens and build a barrier(aka wall), also said they are landscapers and construction workers!! Imo she is way more racist than Trump!

"He had the worst performance of any presidential candidate ever in the history of televised debates. He'll have to have the greatest, by some order of magnitude, to reverse the trend line."

- Steve Schmidt, senior campaign strategist and advisor to the 2008 presidential campaign of John McCain
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Gaynor Bishop Gauthier | 1325497934213122_1325510224211893 | Even if he gave an Oscar winning "performance" tonight, how is that going to make any difference now... after a lifetime of greed, aggression, failure, debauchery, chaos and misery? Why would any informed person change their mind and vote for him, based upon one shining, choreographed, "miraculous" moment in a disgusting 70 years prowling this earth? How stupid.
2 | Karen Windsor Bush | 1325497934213122_1325503937545855 | I thought they'd have to get a restraining order out for him before that debate was over. Or, send him to the 'quiet corner' to stop the pacing....he looked like he had WAY more important things to do than be there...pacing, pacing...
3 | Christopher Hugh Varney | 1325497934213122_1325505104212405 | Trump is incapable of the self-control and maturity that Schmidt is describing. For her part, all Hillary needs to do tonight is hold her own and avoid any huge blunders.
4 | Kim Fischer Einig | 1325497934213122_1325504884212427 | Trump only knows the gutter...He has made a mockery of our system....I for one can't wait to find him in the gutter on Nov. 9th
5 | Stephen Warren Goff | 1325497934213122_1325506640878918 | Trump has exposed the intellectual rot of the Republican National Party. Poor Melania is married to a 70 year old sex fiend.I can't wait until his humiliating defeat and he exiles himself from decent Americans.
6 | Suzanne Brown | 1325497934213122_1325508997545349 | Just saw an article that said Andrea Mitchell actually asked a Hillary campaign spokesperson if Hillary was on drugs. This woman needs to go. I no longer watch her show, she is boring and should retire. She owes Hillary an apology the only person suggesting that there is a problem is Donald and his locos.
7 | Danny Joe | 1325497934213122_1325505700879012 | These Hillary lap dog networks are desperate now when they know Trump has won every debate mopping the floor with Hillary and putting out their rigged polls when Donald Trump is going to win the Presidency in a landslide being predicted by 80% to win .
8 | Ma Dukes | 1325497934213122_1325526160876966 | Trump Stomps All Over Mike Pence's Efforts To Clean Up 'Rigged Election' CommentsBaby Trump is on a perpetual temper tantrum and I'm tired of it. I'm also not giving an ounce of attention to Wikileaks emails, and Clinton's folks should not read or address them. Putin can jump in the lake, and we need to shut him down by enasculating his effort. Clinton should not answer anything re the email except to say she has not read them, is busy, will not read them, does not know their authenticity, and is moving on with her campaign. Trumptin is a traitor to this country, and should be barred from intelligence briefings. Trump is nasty and has been nasty. Not because he cheats on his wife. But because his mother never taught him to keep his hands off girls, and not to peek under girls' dresses. She should have washed out his mouth out with soap, told him "no" more often, and spanked him when he needed it. He is a spoiled, self centered, brat. People, teach your kids, whip them sometimes , and don't make excuses for them. Trump was not parented and that is his problem. My thoughts. Pence is a used car salesman.
9 | Ma Dukes | 1325497934213122_1325510427545206 | Let's watch Trump manipulate CNN and the rest of the press.  He's going to be a nut in the debate, but creating a side show so that after its over the press wont discuss his performance.  Discussing, instead, the sideshow.  It has nothing to do with him trying to intimidate or distract Hilary.  He knows better.
10 | Kathleen Voss | 1325497934213122_1325558044207111 | Steve Schmidt is one of the few Republican voices out there realistically assessing Trump and the debacle that he has caused.  Joe Scarborough has basically said Trump won both debates (or they were at least a tie).  Maybe Steve Schmidt should replace Reince Preibus as the next RNC chair.
11 | Revita Page | 1325497934213122_1325510004211915 | I love Steve Schmidt..he is so honest. We all know it will be another waste of time because he knows nothing about Politics. There will be one candidate trying to express her view and one being a complete a$$hole taking every topic into Mars.
12 | Louis Callard | 1325497934213122_1325530674209848 | Wow. The Republicans keep saying, Hillary is Obama's third term, big mistake because he was voted in twice. If those people come out and vote, he is screwed.
13 | Richard T. Ayers | 1325497934213122_1325706010858981 | As a  loyal & long-time Democrat, the two most honest and sensible Republicans currently working in our Cable news, and campaign environments, are: Steve Schmidt and Michael Steele (former head of the RNC). Both of these Republicans, are loyal to their party and their Conservative values. But, they both will not shy-away from calling-out members of their party, and others, when they say or behave in a nonsensical manner.
14 | Nivea Wiltz-jenkins | 1325497934213122_1325544744208441 | People, Hilary already won two debates! She's winning most of the States!! She doesn't have to say much to win this debate, with the mess trump is already making of it. He's losing and he's desperate. Bill Clinton and President Obama are not running for president, they already won!!! Twice each!!! What kind of debate allows him to bring in people that he wakes up and picks out of his crazy mind!?!? Hilary bring a psychiatrist!!!
15 | Stella Blue | 1325497934213122_1325586270870955 | Hey MSNBC, if you can't find Trump surrogates to be guests on your shows, and demand that they refrain from constantly interrupting, and talking over other people incessantly, then I can't watch your programs. Sorry... not a threat, just a fact. It's out of hand!
16 | Bette Fritz | 1325497934213122_1325838457512403 | If he loses, he has only himself to blame. I agree with some oh his ideas, but couldn't trust him to represent us around the world. He doesn't have an ounce of class, self control or self control or awareness. In some ways it's sad.
17 | Jack Morris | 1325497934213122_1325548507541398 | Another sorry excuse for journalism. MSNBC's credibility is worthless. Do people actually watch this network for credible news?? Or tabloid humor?
18 | Jonathan Shields | 1325497934213122_1325537864209129 | He is going to go down in flames. He finds himself (ironically) in the same position he claims black people are in, nothing to lose. I can't wait to see him sniffing away and making more of a fool of himself like most desperate people do.
19 | Eiotown Art | 1325497934213122_1325602667535982 | For those who are undecided to VOTE or not: Clinton has her numbers and Trump has his numbers. They are fighting to get yours to win!Don't let your anger and silence let Trump win.Yours and our future is on your hands.Go and vote and stop pointing fingers just go and vote. (Senders and independents)
20 | Neal D Harris | 1325497934213122_1325521327544116 | I have seen the worst in a president!!  OBAMA and I've seen this man endorse the death of children and affirm the anti behavior of many. Yet what's worse is that he calls himself Christian yet affirms behavior contrary to what the Bible says!I can't imagine God or Jesus changing their minds on wickedness! I believe both candidates tonight are both going to be ready !  My hope is for trump to win the election!
21 | Ellen Eberly | 1325497934213122_1325653250864257 | I have great respect for Mr. Schmidt -- his politics are contrary to mine, but his analyses and loyalty to this country are unquestionable. He is one of the most effective and honest commentators around.
22 | James Kilroy | 1325497934213122_1325553497540899 | It was cool with Trump stolen taxes Y'all play it on a loop,   Wikileaks emails are real How was your dinner with Hillary's top staff Chucky?   Was Lester there or did he a dinner of his own?
23 | Bruce Ellerstein | 1325497934213122_1325510377545211 | He will do something extremely outlandish either before or during the debate to throw her off balance. Given the rigged narrative he and his campaign have been floating - it could be as something as simple as claiming President Obama told his estranged half brother that the '08 election was rigged or he could amplify disproved Benghazi claims. There will be nothing civil about it - he will do whatever it takes to get HRC to lose her cool. He may even bring the latest accuser.
24 | CJ Mehus | 1325497934213122_1325518964211019 | ....he would rather perform in the circus, bringing "guests", demanding drug tests (which frankly he should be taking) etc. I'm tired of his three rings- time for policies and resolutions. The fact that anything other than that is allowed or tolerated from any nominee is insulting to the citizens of our country.
25 | Barbara Poxon-Spencer | 1325497934213122_1325541850875397 | He dominated the second debate, and that was with a biased lefty moderator. With all the new emails being released, tonight should be a bloodbath. TRUMP!

Kellyanne Conway discussed Donald J. Trump's new debate strategy, which includes inviting President Obama's half-brother to the debate.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Kristine Kubitz Fossmeyer | 1325462787549970_1325463510883231 | Does Trump realize that Obama isn't running in this election?
2 | Jobie Lyne Christy | 1325462787549970_1325466350882947 | Trump is bringing President Obama’s half brother Malik, lol. Brother he didn't grow up with. Brother, who is anti gay. Brother who blamed Obama after he lost the Governor's election in Kenya. Brother of someone NOT running for president. Brother who is a Hamas supporter, & anti-Israel. Brother who is a polygamist. Brother who had a close relationship with Gadaffi. Another brilliant move (NOT), by the whiny, baby cheeto!
3 | Natorrie Lee | 1325462787549970_1325465554216360 | This man is so crazy all this fool had   to do was talk about the issues But hell he can't even do that #VoteBlue all down that ticket #StrongerTogether #ImWithHer
4 | Carlton Fleming | 1325462787549970_1325471447549104 | You people always saying something negative about Hillary and Obama and other dems...just name one positive thing that the. republicans have done for america in the last 16 years...just name one!...you guys talk a lot of smack but don't do anything but try to stop everything the democrats put on the table
5 | Avril Mckoy | 1325462787549970_1325468127549436 | What the President Obama half brother got to do with this Election what is his point of having him there could it get any more dumber than this for crying out loud
6 | M E MBeth Elliott | 1325462787549970_1325467650882817 | Speaking, and working on behalf of children, the disabled, poor, healthcare that makes her very successful in my eyes. Much more so than a money grubber who has had 6 bankruptcies.
7 | Clay Acorn | 1325462787549970_1325468280882754 | Obama not only isn't running but he won't even be there, maybe Trump can take him to the White House on his private jet afterwards, of course Trump isn't invited, we just need him for his plane that was built by people he never paid.
8 | Joyce Rosse Reed | 1325462787549970_1325468620882720 | I saw that interview and was very upset with commentator on that they never calls her down.  They ask her a question and kellyanne always turns it around and starts pointing her finger at Hillary they never stop her or call her down on her lies about Hillary.
9 | Amy Yavelak-Czyz | 1325462787549970_1325474057548843 | Conservatives are completely disrespectful of Hillary's accomplishments. No, of course she is imperfect she is human. However she has a resume of decades not as a politician, but as a public advocate. Her children's health care initiative is still a fundamental critical support today. Her work as First Lady, a young attorney, working for civil rights, equality, the poor, first responders, these commitments and efforts are praise worthy, regardless of party. I'm sick and tired of the GOP vilifying their opponent to the point of delusional hatred, and the worst part is that 40% of our nation was dumb enough to buy the smear campaign conducted with our tax dollars in the halls of our congress. It's disgusting. Hillary Clinton is not this country's fall guy, responsible for the way politics and government have worked for decades. She has to play the game as it exists, she doesn't make the rules. I'd like to see the emails of every government employee including the GOP senate and republicans and how they abused their committee power to tarnish Clinton with politically motivated witch hunts. I'd like to see how much the NRA and others contribute to their campaigns then push legislation at federal and state levels, the real pay to play affecting our everyday lives and holding us back from equality, justice and opportunity. Blaming Clinton for the ills of politics is an absurd fallacy too many have fallen for. Especially given the little we know about the GOP nominee and the work of congressional republicans to obstruct and destroy the presidency, the democratic candidate, workers, unions, the poor, the real people of our nation, just to hoard political power and hijack the executive and judicial branches. Life is more than politics, the republicans need to start putting this nation ahead of their party.
10 | Cheryl Brantley | 1325462787549970_1325470570882525 | If Trump is going to use the Wikileaks emails content in any way against HRC, then the Trump campaign needs to hand over ALL of Kelly Anne Conway's emails first. I bet those would make for some interesting reading... especially the ones from Bannon...  Siding with the Russians using hacked private information is despicable.
11 | Pakalu Papito | 1325462787549970_1325464367549812 | Im naturally funny because my life is a joke
12 | Munther Queisi | 1325462787549970_1325466537549595 | it's so funny how he tries to play those dirty games coz he can't beat her himself... such an idiot Hani Akasheh
13 | Susan Olk Casella | 1325462787549970_1325470624215853 | 1-nobody cares about Obama's half brother 2-Obama isn't running (unfortunately) 3-Trump invited someone as his guest that has suspected ties to Hamas. In other words, Trump failed yet again.
14 | Patricia Marie | 1325462787549970_1325475604215355 | Wonder if trump knows the difference between Hamas and Hezbollah yet? Hamas has been designated as a terrorist organization by the the US, the EU, and Britain. So Obama's estranged 1/2 brother is a supporter of a terrorist group and trump invites him to the debate as his guest? What does that say about trumps foreign policy? Or the lack of his knowledge regarding foreign policy?
15 | Armando Muñoz | 1325462787549970_1325471767549072 | Because he wanted someone who hates Israel and supports a terrorist group like Hamas to be on his side. Just when you think that Republicans couldn't get any lower they dig their way to a new low.
16 | Brenda Alexander | 1325462787549970_1325471847549064 | KellyAnne - yours isn't a success story either now is it?  Look who you hitched your wagon to.  He's an unstable, moronic buffoon.  And he's going to lose BIGLY on November 8th.
17 | Gwyndlon Faye Dobbs | 1325462787549970_1325474730882109 | Kellyann and the rest of Trump's barn Animals aren't very intelligent. Hillary is ready for anything they have. I bet Trump still can't answer the questions. He's too unintelligent. He even was suppose to have practiced. Practiced being a bully a hole.
18 | Timothy Perkins | 1325462787549970_1325493684213547 | An American success story is certainly not one that fails at everything he touches. Doesn't pay his bills. Doesn't pay his taxes. Stiffs his contractors. Stiffs the hotels he holds rallies at. I could go on but you get my point. Look up the word failure in Websters Dictionary and you'll find Trumps picture.
19 | Abe Gonzalez | 1325462787549970_1325470064215909 | Trump is inviting a janitor, Wilbur McPecker, to the debate. As reported this morning in Breitbart, Wilbur alleges that Bill Clinton did not flush after using the restroom at The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, thus causing spillage on the floor. Wilbur had to clean it up. He claims that Hillary blamed the incident on the janitors. Trump promises to use the incident during the debate since everything else he talks about is also crap.
20 | Kim Ritter | 1325462787549970_1325470367549212 | She isn't? Former FL, US Senator, Secretary of State, best-selling author, multimillionaire, most admired woman in the world 20 times, first woman in line to become a US President?What a failure! Her parents would be so ashamed!!
21 | Carrie McNally | 1325462787549970_1325484000881182 | When I hear policy discussions relating to this election, I wonder why??  It's not about policy, it's not a normal election...it's about keeping psycho Mr. Pumpkinhead out of the White House.
22 | Cherie Heast | 1325462787549970_1325473584215557 | LOL, Trump invites Obama's half brother for the purpose of??? Did he Vet him, isn't he a Muslim, doesn't he come from a country that has had terrorists running around?  Oohhhh, I bet President Obama is really upset, Not! Trump's only purpose in doing this is to keep his lie going that the President is not an American, he's doing it to please Bannon!
23 | Yvonne Johnson | 1325462787549970_1325485484214367 | I think Trump is losing it! It's bad enough that he still thinks he's a as his child wife said a boy! When it comes to a woman his age he can't compete! He for gets he's an old man! A dirty OLD man ! So when he talks about the woman he sexually assaulted back then they were young and now their his age! So his wife was 22 and the women were closer to his age. Trump is now a old man. He forgets.
24 | Leslie Glaze | 1325462787549970_1325494097546839 | Kellyanne Conway is a hater. Hillary has done more than she ever will. That's why her hair is starting to look like trumps. I can't wait until she goes away....and nobody cares about Obamas brother, Trump is using him only to fit his agenda just as he did with Bill Clinton accusers. Get some rest Kellyanne, the only time you will be in the White House is as a visitor.
25 | Linda Kenley | 1325462787549970_1325497030879879 | Invited the half brother who is voting for Trump because Obama assassinated Gaddafi, the half brothers friend. His friend??? And because Obama wouldn't loan him money for his own campaign but later admitted "politics is not for him". Plus being anti LGBT. Ooh, more fodder for SNL. What a joke. Watch the Cubs game or a good movie!! #voteblue

"Our system works very well. We make it easy to vote and hard to cheat in Ohio and across the country, and people should have confidence in it."
- Jon Husted, Ohio's secretary of state
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Alec Drake | 1325426880886894_1325429304219985 | Trump hasn't got the memo. He is still whining about a rigged election because he is losing. If you are complaining before the game is over, then that means you know you're not doing well.
2 | Joseph James Mohn | 1325426880886894_1325431734219742 | I think when Trump speaks of the election being rigged he's highlighting the irrefutable fact that the media establishment is in bed with the Democratic party; Literally and figuratively. So it gives him an unfair playing field.
3 | Missy Anne Thrope | 1325426880886894_1325430617553187 | Ohio has been rigged since 2000. There is documented proof to support this but naysayers just listen to mainstream media and don't bother to actually do any real research on the subject. BTW, it's not just Ohio that's rigged.
4 | Brandon Horan | 1325426880886894_1325428264220089 | This is a pattern for Trump. Remember when "The Apprentice" didn't win any Emmy Awards? he repeatedly insisted that they were rigged. When you are a narcissist, nothing negative is ever your fault.
5 | Shirley Clark | 1325426880886894_1325427574220158 | If Donald Trump says that Ohio is rigged, then we are supposed to believe that Ohio is rigged because the politicians were paid off. At least that's what I think I heard from the Republican nominee.
6 | Rino Sciaini | 1325426880886894_1325435517552697 | Of course it's rigged. The FBI did not prosecute Hillary because it's rigged. She should not even be running for president. Eric Holder, Lois Learner,Janet napolitano, Gina Mccarthy,John Kerry and Susan Rice were not prosecuted , because it's rigged. Everything is rigged they play you liberals like a game of pokemon go. They think you are pitiful little fools with the intellect of Miley Cyrus after shooting up a eight ball.
7 | Dale Lange | 1325426880886894_1325485564214359 | The rigged system is the one where Sanders gets excluded from the Democrat nomination process and the head of the DNC is fired. The rigged system is the one where the media and the Justice Department collude to allow Hillary to commit a felony and not be charged. The rigged system is the one where those individuals who steal others' identities may not get caught exercising a right that they are not entitled to. The rigged system is the one where Democratic operatives pay individuals to riot and commit violence at Trump rallies.You'll find more rigging in our election system than you'll find on the USS Constitution.
8 | Syringa Vulgaris | 1325426880886894_1325678040861778 | In ohio you can vote early Or by mail with no special reason. In Kentucky the poles are open from 6am to 6pm election day period. If you want to get an absentee ballot you need to "qualify". And you have to have a photo I.D.
9 | Elaine Marcz | 1325426880886894_1325480324214883 | blah... this whole election is being rigged by all of the media including Fox who hates Donald J. Trump...from start to finish it ahs been rigged...check out the voters who are dead or regested twice...that is rigged becasue the majority are dems.
10 | Diane O'Connor | 1325426880886894_1325450067551242 | "If I were someone willing and able to rig the upcoming election in Hillary's favor, the most effective way to do so would be to set it up so that her opponent was a sputtering buffoon who finds a way to alienate large sections of the American public and inspire divisiveness and chaos in his own party."
11 | Mollijean Frazier | 1325426880886894_1325487324214183 | But, the person Husted has said he will vote for is the one complaining and "egging" his supporters to use their POOR judgement in  keeping "close watch" over the polling places--in certain towns!!!  When will Republicans take responsibility for what they have created?
12 | Thomas Edward Newton Jr. | 1325426880886894_1325562627539986 | Thank you John Husted. We may be from different parties but I am glad you're taking a stand against him and making sure that people know that these elections are true.I go for my Election Poll Worker training on this Friday.
13 | Carlos DeCarvalho | 1325426880886894_1325638590865723 | Americans have lost the purpose of a democracy! It's not about the party! It's about how hard our future president will work, contribute for the future of our country, the direction we want our democracy to continue with honesty, integrity and morality. We have lost it all. Trump out works Hillary 5-1 he's has a great work ethic, and has created prosperity for his family.  Hillary has made her life at using our political system for her personal gain, using political office for personal gain while being paid by the citizens of this country. Her track record has not been glorious or spectacular.  I'm voting for Trump because I work hard for little I have, and respect those who work just as hard!
14 | John Parramore | 1325426880886894_1325445437551705 | God almighty could descend again to proclaim this fact, but the brain-dead Trump zombies would still be unconvinced. The funniest, but also most tragic, thing is to watch a Trump zombie try and logically explain the facts that support their beliefs. 20 years of suckling from nothing but the Fox News teat will do that...
15 | Steve Yum | 1325426880886894_1325693174193598 | "It's rigged folks, EVERYbody knows it...". No, everybody does NOT know it and Trump has never and will never provide a shred of evidence to support his claim because it doesn't exist.
16 | Jim Collier | 1325426880886894_1325525734210342 | All of the responsible people have stated that our system is not rigged. All democrats and many republicans have said that Trump is wrong. If we have no faith in our elections, what hope do we have ?
17 | Taja Waldon-Billops | 1325426880886894_1325484290881153 | Yea, the fact you keep trying to push it down our throats, you wont do it. Makes me think the opposite. And, the fact you are Republican doesnt help me trust you.
18 | Beverly A. Class | 1325426880886894_1325575037538745 | Meanwhile....@AriBerman says 1M voters were purged from rolls in Ohio. It was reported that approximately 12 democratic House seats were lost to gerrymandering in 2012. The GOP is surgically making it more difficult for democratic leaning voters to vote.
19 | Dennis G. McAuliffe | 1325426880886894_1325446540884928 | If the election is really rigged, 33 states are rigged by RepublicansOnly 17 states and the District of Columbia have Democratic-controlled electoral systems.
20 | Marion Rohling | 1325426880886894_1325548460874736 | Well, isn't this refreshing! Thanx...not that this will make a dent in trumps rhetoric, or calm the anger of those who follow him. Their candidate is deflecting & putting up this smoke screen, since there's plenty of scandals that are still hanging over his head.
21 | Alice Gines | 1325426880886894_1325467807549468 | Does he have his head up his butt along with all the others that doesn't believe "our system is not rigged"? If everyone would have to show ID it would help some but you still can't control the voting machines being rigged or the polling people that have been bought and paid for, wake up people. Hillary is tied to the one company that has the power to sway this entire election.http://truthfeed.com/breaking-the-fix-is-in-16-states-will-use-voting-systems-run-by-soros-board-member/29891/4 Million Dead People & Ineligible Voters Are Registered To Vote, Obama administration isn’t doing anything about ithttp://dennismichaellynch.com/video-4-million-dead-people-ineligible-voters-registered-vote/Rigging the Election - Video I: Clinton Campaign and DNC Incite Violence at Trump Rallieshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IuJGHuIkzYRigging the Election - Video II: Mass Voter Fraudhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDc8PVCvfKsVoting machine revealed frightening results.http://dennismichaellynch.com/really-happening-votes/

A slew of law suits for fraud at Trump Universaty, many bankruptcies ( just take the money & run) ,  draft dodger, failed marriages , draft dodger. No experience, no plan. Just "believe me", I know more than the military Generals. Trump products all made out of the USA. Don't forget the conspiracy behind everything. Can't wait till this fool disappears into the hole he crawled out of.#NEVERTRUMP
25 | Cheryl Hall | 1325426880886894_1325470664215849 | We should all be talking about those emails, the collusion between the HRC camp and the State Department, the FBI, her lies to us the American people, her public stand and her private one only for the Wall Street big shots, selling the office of Secretary of State to the highest bidder. There is so much to distrust about her that I get such a sick feeling whenever I see or hear her name. Her corruption is revolting.

Donald J. Trump claimed there are 1.8 million deceased individuals listed as voters, and he said: "I have a feeling they're not gonna vote for me."
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Scheris Lloyd | 1325373714225544_1325375527558696 | I will be so glad when this election is over, Donald Trump is making us look like stupid Americans
2 | Stephen Warren Goff | 1325373714225544_1325382624224653 | What a whiny 70 year old. Trump has exposed the the intellectual rot of the National Republican party. I can't wait until his humiliating defeat forces him into exile. His brand is ruined.
3 | Mary Frank | 1325373714225544_1325388164224099 | Well Donald. My husband died in July of 2016. I am and he was a registered voter in our state. Just received my mail in ballot. He didn't get one. So your full of BS! And a whole lot more!
4 | Judi Garabo Hayes | 1325373714225544_1325379694224946 | So let's talk about that. When you die, cancelling your voter registration is probably not the foremost priority for your survivors. Does it matter? No. If dead people are actually voting, then yes, that's a problem. Trump needs to stop slobbering over this issue. And others.
5 | Suzette Santiago Puga | 1325373714225544_1325413777554871 | Oh Trump, if the system could be rigged do you really think the Republicans would have let Obama in for 2 terms??? My live vote will be for Hillary.
6 | Ralph Edwin Pope Jr. | 1325373714225544_1325383567557892 | Isn't the morally, brain dead enough for this man. The party of Gerrymandering and oppressing votes complains about cheating. LOL VOTE ALL REPUBLICANS OUT AND GET AMERICA MOVING AGAIN.
7 | Ellen Massie | 1325373714225544_1325384180891164 | I believe Dirty Don should track down each and every single voter and speak to them...dead or alive. He'll have a lot of time on his hands after the election and could handle that small task of tracking every dead voters vote then on to the live ones.
8 | Carol Rinker Petersen | 1325373714225544_1325385920890990 | Democrats, it appears... cheat.Democrats are committing voter fraud, they’re admitting it on camera. Scott Foval brags about skirting laws and not getting caught.

From the EPA to the FBI to Hillary.  In a Banana Republic, the law only applies those of us that aren't "connected".
9 | James Osborne | 1325373714225544_1325418740887708 | This guy is so out of control first it was illegals crossing the border to vote Clinton and now it's the dead when is his line of BS gonna stop holly hell
10 | Robert G. Knechtel | 1325373714225544_1325420687554180 | For years, Trump and right-wing extremists insisted that the Obama presidency is illegitimate through birtherism, Etc., a belief that continues to resonate among the zealots. It's crucial to them that the concept of an illegitimate president be kept alive. That case will be based upon the charges of election rigging and voter fraud that we're seeing now.
11 | Dale Whiting | 1325373714225544_1325399460889636 | Wow, Donald! How did you figure that out? If  registered voter dies, Social Security gets notified. But in my state where all voters coming to the poll must show an acceptable state or federal picture, not many dead people vote. Wise up stupid! You are running for POTUS and according to you, he was born in Kenya. Never mind that a foreign born person who has one US citizen is also a citizen. Ask Ted Cruz!
12 | Geoff Gentel | 1325373714225544_1325394887556760 | I just love how Trump loved bragging about polls when he was doing well during the primaries and when he had the upper hand on Hillary but now that he is WAYYY behind he thinks they are fake. LOL
13 | Belinda Bounds Carver | 1325373714225544_1325386934224222 | I guess those 68,000 dead people already found on the voter rolls in one state aren't a big deal right?  Gov uses the excuse that they haven't had time to purge they're voter rolls, but that wont fly because most have been dead for over 10 yrs
14 | Justin Markell | 1325373714225544_1325507130878869 | Dead voters won't tip the scale of the presidential election because George Soros has paid political operatives like Scott Foval to bring in people from out of State and commit voter fraud that way.  So yeah... I agree dead people won't be the difference in this election.
15 | Jessica Emerson | 1325373714225544_1325377627558486 | Wikileaks has proven, the rich are colluding with Hillary, Hillary colluded wi the FBI, Hillary planned a smear campaign a long time ago painting the Donald as a sexual predator....George Soros owns the voting machines in 16 states...computers always have a backdoor...dead people vote?
16 | Jennifer Birdsong | 1325373714225544_1325409840888598 | This is Why Everyone should Volunteer with Their Party during each election every 2 Years or 4 and all High Schools just Teach Political Science. Voters don't come off the list unless when making Calls the Phone number is still correct and someone is told that person has passed. Between elections Yes people pass way.
17 | Dee Tee | 1325373714225544_1325414237554825 | Now if dead folks have enough sense not to vote for this nutt the choice should be simple enough for the living amongst us.  #VoteBlue
18 | Justin Bowler | 1325373714225544_1325420920887490 | I really can't believe people call trump supporters intellectual rot. Hillary has sold us out and there is proof. And we are the problem? You people are throwing away the American life for socialism. The end is coming and it's called Hillary. We will either be in a race war under hillary, wwiii, or just an all out civil uprising to take our country back from the big banks that own the Democrats. Either way get your money out of the bank.
19 | Charlie Gray | 1325373714225544_1325515204211395 | Whats sad is that this headline is justifying any dead voters.  Whether it will tip the election or not, dead people are dead!!!  Why is there voter fraud allowing dead people's identity to be used to vote should be a better topic of discussion!!!
20 | Connie Belk | 1325373714225544_1325399687556280 | I'm sure that when people die the family doesn't necessarily cancel their voter registration! Just because they r registered doesn't mean their voting! He really should have some real evidence before making such accusations!
21 | Michel Metford-Platt | 1325373714225544_1325435774219338 | Both my parents are registered in FL but passed in 2013/15. I doubt they are voting, and I can't think of anyone who would cross the state, wear old people makeup, and walk with a cane then pretend they were them. Yes there are deceased voters on the roll. But they don't actually vote.
22 | Sharon Larson | 1325373714225544_1325430477553201 | In Washington state you are removed from voter rolls when you die. I assume the division that issues death certificates coordinates with the voter rolls people. I also assume, Donald, that people of both parties die in roughly the same proportion. I heard you telling those who are close to death to stay alive and vote for you before dying. So I guess you didn't think others would use their ballot and vote illegal for you. That denies you think voter fraud would be committed.
23 | Billy Dunn | 1325373714225544_1325405497555699 | I would like to thank 0bama for the 0.3% raise in my Soc Sec starting next year, that extra $4.00 will make such a big difference in my life, think about it, thats like 40 dimes! I hope you get the 18% raise you've requested in your retirement when you leave, we wouldn't want an ex-president going hungry now would we, again, thanks 0bama for looking out for the little guy!
24 | Les Slaten | 1325373714225544_1325399224222993 | My grandpa voted in 2012 and he's been dead since 1972... J/K but they say 600000 voted absentee ballot in 2012 and there were county's in Penn where Obama got ALL the votes, now that's party unity...
25 | Donna Paakkonen | 1325373714225544_1325478374215078 | I'm sure they are among the first to know when someone dies...my husband died in August...I did not contact the voter registration people.  His name was gone from the voter list at the next election...give it up Trump!
