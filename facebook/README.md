#Facebook post scrape
* Using facebook graph api. https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api
* Fetch posts data from several facebook media page (e.g. FoxNews, CNN).
* So far it is limited. It could only fetch last 25 posts from one page and 25 comments from facebook users under each post.
* Not implement any filter while fetching data through Graph api.
* Implement a filter while loading data from raw data into the database. Excluded irrelevant posts and comments.
