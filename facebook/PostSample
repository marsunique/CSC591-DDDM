Byrd's (her \"mentor\") KKK roots;\n\n*Saul Alinksy's life-destroying politics-of-personal-destruction;\n\n*Saul Alinsky's (another quoted \"mentor\"?!) work dedication to Satan;\n\n*The plight of inner city youths who get shot in the streets by gangs;\n\n*The plight of inner city youths stuck in failing schools with government-prohibited opportunity for competitive education venues;\n\n*Iran growing its dangerous nuclear program even after vowing to destroy Israel, thanks to her participation in the most dangerous deal America finds herself in;\n\n*Corrupt pay-to-play crony deals to enrich herself with deals like handing 20\u0025 of America's valuable uranium supply to Russia; \n\n.... and goodness, there are more. \n\nAll this, yet it's a political opponent's past verbiage she deems \"horrific\". \n\n- Sarah Palin",

The Media just doesn't get it....they can't believe that people are so angry that they can no longer be manipulated!\n\nMillions of trump supporters feel this way about Donald J. Trump.....\n\n\"We don't care if the guy swears... or how many times he's been married...or who he voted for, or what his income tax return shows. We want the problems fixed. Yes he's an egomaniac, but we don't care. We know he's not a racist, or bad to women, or all the other things the liberal media is trying to label him with. We know he's raised a good family, and that says a lot about him.\n\nThe country is a mess because politicians suck, the Republican Party is two faced & gutless, and illegals are everywhere and Muslims are openly trying to hurt this country and make the civilized world adjust to them. We want it all fixed!\n\nWe don't care that Trump is crude, we don't care that he has changed positions, we don't care that he fights with Megan Kelly, Rosie O'Donnell, and so many of the elected establishment. We don't care that Rubio, Ryan, the Bush's, and so many other top old and new Republicans refuse to endorse him for their own selfish reasons, and we know what they are. We don't care that he doesn't know the name of some Muslim terrorists, we don't care that he tried some businesses that didn't work out.\n\nThis country is weak, bankrupt, our enemies are making fun of us, we are being invaded by illegals, we are becoming a nation of victims, where every Tom, Ricardo and Hasid is a special group with special rights to a point where we don't even recognize the country we were born and raised in, AND WE JUST WANT IT FIXED. And TRUMP is the only guy who seems to understand what the people want.\n\nWe're sick of politicians, sick of the Democratic and Republican Party. We're angry about the Iran deal, the budget, treatment of Israel, military weakness, lobbyists, special interests, overpaid politicians with their self serving bills and back room deals, trade deals, loss of jobs, manipulated economic numbers, businesses fleeing, and even the phoney pay for play Clinton Foundation.\n\nAmericans are no longer going to be fooled, and the movement is out to change the direction we're taking. Trump may not be a saint, but he doesn't have lobbyist money holding him, he doesn't have political correctness restraining him, and all you know is that he has been very successful, a good negotiator, he has built a lot of things, he's flexible, and he's also not a politician. And he says he'll fix it. And we believe him because he is too much of an egotist to be proven wrong or looked at and called a liar.\n\nPublic service has become elected greed. This may be our only chance to have a non-politician, despite his flaws, try and correct the mess, at least for 4 years. We must take the shot, because the consequences of putting Hillary Clinton in office are frightening. There is a tidal wave happening, and its going to overcome much of what's happened to this country.\"",

After being left stranded by his party, and found guilty ONLY after taking the case to several judges who refused to take the case, the fix was in and he was found guilty. THAT made the headlines.

It's about real issues on what has she done in 30 yrs. Why is she all of a sudden going to do something. If we mishandled trillions of dollars wouldn't we be fired from our positions? Why would you broadcast your war strategies so that your enemies know what you are doing? Also, is allowing illegal immigrants to vote fair to people who haven't been able to? Really? Frustration is what I and millions of others feel... Clean out the corruption in our government and the media. This debate was a knockout win and a great come back for Donalds campaign. In 30 yrs No one has ever put the Clinton's in their place from any Republican party. Powerful Donald Trump has and so needed to show that leadership is not about political correctness, but to be strong and respond in truth for its people, which evidently the media, the government nor hollywood has no interest in doing. They all rake it in to persuade you. and distract you from what is real. Kudos to the truth!",

She wants to take our rights away along with our guns so their precious Isis can come & take whatever they want & kill whoever they want & sharia law would be in affect, Obamacare is a disaster... you can't afford it & you get penalized for not being able to afford it! Her & obama is not doing anything for our vets... clearly America is not first when obama & Hillary are in charge. \nTrump facts: he's a businessman, he has said \"mean\" things & I don't care about his taxes! Best part, he's not a politician! He wants to put up a wall, kill our enemies & he's for America! Americans will actually come first, vets will come first. Choice is clear!

Why would you broadcast your war strategies so that your enemies know what you are doing? Also, is allowing illegal immigrants to vote fair to people who haven't been able to? Really? Frustration is what I and millions of others feel... Clean out the corruption in our government and the media. This debate was a knockout win and a great come back for Donalds campaign. In 30 yrs No one has ever put the Clinton's in their place from any Republican party. Powerful Donald Trump has and so needed to show that leadership is not about political correctness, but to be strong and respond in truth for its people, which evidently the media, the government nor hollywood has no interest in doing. They all rake it in to persuade you. and distract you from what is real. Kudos to the truth!",

Oh my god, I can't believe it. Addition and subtraction of the 1s the 2s and the 3s. Its terrible. Its just terrible. Look, if you want to know what 2+2 is, do you want to know what 2+2 is? I'll tell you.\nFirst of all the number 2, by the way I love the number 2. It's probably my favorite number, no it is my favorite number. You know what, it's probably more like the number two but with a lot of zeros behind it. A lot. If I'm being honest, I mean, if I'm being honest. I like a lot of zeros. Except for Marco Rubio, now he's a zero that I don't like. Though, I probably shouldn't say that. He's a nice guy but he's like, \"10101000101\", on and on, like that. He's like a computer! You know what I mean? He's like a computer. I don't know. I mean, you know. \nSo, we have all these numbers and we can add them and subtract them and add them. TIMES them even. Did you know that? We can times them OR divide them, they don't tell you that, and I'll tell you, no one is better at the order of operations than me. You wouldn't believe it. That I can tell you. So, we're gonna be the best on 2+2, believe me. OK? Alright. Thank you.\"",

He has on 3 recorded occasions expressed sexual interest in his own daughter, his current and 3rd wife can be seen naked on the internet by anyone with a browser, and he thinks Mexico is going to pay for a border wall between our two countries. Oh, and New York Justice Court has decided that there is enough evidence to move forward to a hearing on charges of JUVENILE RAPE, so he'll be facing those charges too.

Ever.\nNever mind that Clinton orchestrated intimidation and character assassination against her husband's victims of sexual assault.\nNope. Trump has a potty mouth, and had a bad attitude toward women, and that matters more than national and economic security, more than religious liberty, and more than the right to life itself.

So, in order to lock down the nomination for 2016, Hillary would've had to put Schultz in charge of the DNC to manipulate the party from within. In order for this corruption scheme to work, the Clintons would have needed first to, not only get the current DNC chair at the time to step down, but also get them to recommend Schultz for the position. A big request. And the Clintons would have likely needed to promise a powerful favor to that DNC chair, something more prestigious than being head of the Democratic party. So who was that person and what did they get in return? The previous chair of the DNC prior to Debbie Wasserman Schultz was...Tim Kaine.\nLet that sink in.",

If you\u2019re under 35, read on\u2014I promise you that you will be amazed at what you missed! (By the way, sadly, this isn\u2019t a joke. I wish it was.)\n\nREMEMBER WHEN BILL CLINTON WAS PRESIDENT?\n(January 20, 1993 to January 20, 2001\u2014two terms)\n\nWhen Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over an attempt to reform health care.\n\nHer proposed plan was so bad that many Democrats came up with competing plans of their own in protest, and in spite of threats and intimidation, on September 26, 1994, the \u201cHillarycare\u201d bill was declared dead.\n\nThis fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million for studies, promotion, and other efforts.\n\nThen, President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general. Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood\u2014both were forced to withdraw their names from consideration.\n\nNext, she chose Janet Reno, which husband Bill described as \"my worst mistake.\"\n\n(Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.)\n\nHusband Bill also allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission\u2014Lani Guanier was her selection.\n\nAfter considerable backlash from prominent Democratic senators concerning Ms. Guanier's radical views, Bill Clinton withdrew her name from nomination, stating that she did not represents the civil rights views that he had championed during his campaign.\n\nHowever, apparently a slow learner, husband Bill continued to allow Hillary to make more recommendations.\n\nShe chose former law partners, Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department.\n\nHer selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kennedy was forced to resign.\n\n(Is anyone wondering yet what her Supreme Court Justice appointments would be like?)\n\nMany younger voters will have no knowledge of \"Travelgate,\" the first major ethics controversy during Bill\u2019s presidency.\n\nHillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend, Harry Thompson\u2014but the White House Travel Office refused to comply.\n\nShe trumped up allegations of financial mismanagement and reported seven long-time White House employees to the FBI. This ruined their reputations, got them fired, and caused a thirty-six month investigation.\n\nEventually, most of the employees were reinstated and Clinton associates were forced out of the travel office. Only one White House employee, Billy Dale, was charged with a crime\u2014the enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds; a jury acquitted him in less than two hours.\n\nStill not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House Security.\n\nWhen Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies (Filegate) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff, suddenly Hillary and the President denied even knowing Livingstone, and of course, denied knowledge of drug use in the White House.\n\nFollowing this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents.\n\nNext, when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by Bill Clinton, Hillary was put in charge of the \"bimbo eruption\" and scandal defense.\n\nLet\u2019s look at some of her more notable decisions in this regard . . .\n\nShe urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation, they settled with Ms. Jones.\n\nShe refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor.\n\nAfter $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr's investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs.\n\nHillary's devious game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for 'lying under oath' to a grand jury, followed by his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives.\n\nHillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, \"I do not recall,\" \"I have no recollection,\" and \"I don't know\" a total of 56 times while under oath. (Sound familiar?)\n\nAfter leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had \"mistakenly thought was hers.\"\n\nSo you see, the email scandal and all of her malfeasance regarding the handling of Top Secret information, not to mention the \"pay to play\" schemes of the Clinton Foundation, are nothing new.\n\nHillary\u2019s entire political career has been nothing but a web of lies, corruption and destruction in her quest for power.\n\nIs anyone else ready to say, \u201cEnough is enough!\u201d?\n\nBut unfortunately, I\u2019m sure her loyal fans will say, \"What difference does it make?\"\n\nCredit: Donna Bauer\nhttps://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154832456506564&set=a.10153052941601564.1073741826.652821563&type=3&theater",

Cognitive dissonance is alive and well with Trump supporters. Also, if Trump's going to put Hillary in jail, perhaps he should have taken up Mr Khan's offer of the US Constitution. Article 2 does not give the President the power to jail people and the 5th, 6th and 7th Amendments cover one's rights. Mr Trump cannot suspend these, any more than Mrs Clinton can repeal the 2nd Amendment, as he so often claims. Due process evidently means nothing to the mendacious misogynist Trump.",

In my opinion, it is not that he said these things so much that is offensive to me, but that someone, somewhere, out there, in an act of desperation, decided to USE this private discussion, in order to attempt to derail a candidate that We, the People, in our hearts, believe is the answer to and perhaps an end to, the corruption which permeates the Government of America. You and all Republicans, are fully aware of the corruption at the highest level our country is being subjected to. I, personally think you are a fine young, man, Mr. Chaffetz, but I am disappointed that you are not wise to \"dirty trick\" politics, that played such a huge part of this entire, sordid attack on Mr. Trump.

The Media just doesn't get it....they can't believe that people are so angry that they can no longer be manipulated!\n\nMillions of trump supporters feel this way about Donald J. Trump.....\n\n\"We don't care if the guy swears... or how many times he's been married...or who he voted for, or what his income tax return shows. We want the problems fixed. Yes he's an egomaniac, but we don't care. We know he might talk  rude to women, or all the other things the liberal media is trying to label him with. We know he's raised a good family, and that says a lot about him.\n\nThe country is a mess because politicians , the Republican Party is two faced & gutless, and illegals are everywhere and Muslims are openly trying to hurt this country and make the civilized world adjust to them. We want it all fixed!\n\nWe don't care that Trump is crude, we don't care that he has changed positions, we don't care that he fights with Megan Kelly, Rosie O'Donnell, and so many of the elected establishment. We don't care that Rubio, Ryan, the Bush's, and so many other top old and new Republicans refuse to endorse him for their own selfish reasons, and we know what they are. We don't care that he doesn't know the name of some Muslim terrorists, we don't care that he tried some businesses that didn't work out.\n\nThis country is Weak, Bankrupt, our Enemies are making fun of us, we are being invaded by illegals, we are becoming a nation of victims, where every Tom, Ricardo and Hasid is a special group with special rights to a point where we don't even recognize the country we were born and raised in, AND WE JUST WANT IT FIXED. And TRUMP is the only guy who seems to understand what the people want.\n\nWe're sick of politicians, sick of the Democratic and Republican Party. We're angry about the Iran deal, the budget, treatment of Israel, military weakness, lobbyists, special interests, overpaid politicians with their self serving bills and back room deals, trade deals, loss of jobs, manipulated economic numbers, businesses fleeing, and even the phoney pay for play Clinton Foundation.\n\nAmericans are no longer going to be fooled, and the movement is out to change the direction we're taking. Trump may not be a saint, but he doesn't have lobbyist money holding him, he doesn't have political correctness restraining him, and all you know is that he has been very successful, a good negotiator, he has built a lot of things, he's flexible, and he's also not a politician. And he says he'll fix it. And we believe him because he is too much of an egotist to be proven wrong or looked at and called a liar.\n\nPublic service has become elected greed. This may be our only chance to have a non-politician, despite his flaws, try and correct the mess, at least for 4 years. We must take the shot, because the consequences of putting Hillary Clinton in office are frightening. There is a tidal wave happening, and its going to overcome much of what's happened to this country.\"GOD help America if hillary gets in.",

A President who heard all the things the Director of the FBI told us about Hillary Clinton, that she was extremely careless and reckless with our Nation's classified materials, who did not immediately come to the microphone and speak to America about this.  A President, who sought not to assure a nation, but remained silent as there were no prosecutions, when all Americans knew that anyone else in similar circumstances would certainly have stringent consequences, the very least of which would be to forever lose the privilege of being privy to America's secrets.  A President, who learned that his Attorney General held a private meeting with the FBI target's husband (a former President) and potential witness only hours before a decision was to be made in these investigations. A President who is aware that sensitive materials belonging to the United States Government, were destroyed following a Congressional Subpoena to produce them, and remains silent.  A President who has lied to us about the OBVIOUS ransom payment made to a country we know will spend every cent of what we provided to them in efforts to HURT AMERICA and her citizens.  I find it absolutely reprehensible that our President, who is supposed to be a voice for WE THE PEOPLE, clears his calendar of duties he is being paid to do, in order to further smear a candidate running for president, because it may affect his own, pitiful legacy, in favor of Hillary Clinton, who could not pass a security clearance test to operate a laundromat, but wants to put this person in the White House as his replacement, only because he wants to preserve his own legacy.  This, folks, is what INSECURITY is all about.",

I am an American, not a white one, not a black one. or a hispanic one, or a native american one, or any others that make up our great nation. Donald Trump is really not a republican he is a Nationalist. He believes in America! He's not a politician! He's a rich guy that could have continued to make money like the other leaches in the political system, but he decided this country means something! He's fighting the republican party elites that don't like him and the media who has never found a democrat that they didn't love or worship! Just look back at all those Kennedy family scandals what great examples of morality they are. If we make the right decision this time we will be on the road to a Republic once again! The founding fathers said we have established a Republic are we smart enough to keep it!  George Washington said political parties will be the death of us. How true that is today! If you elect Donald Trump maybe this time, just maybe, people like Joe the Plummer and others might have a chance to lead this great nation. I don\u2019t think the founding fathers believe in the good old boys network running the country. They were smarter than the politicians of today! So when you go out to vote remember that our country is at stake! I pray you all make the right choice. God help us all!",

If you\u2019re over 35, take a walk with me down memory lane\u2014you won\u2019t believe what you have forgotten.  If you\u2019re under 35, read on\u2014I promise you that you will be amazed at what you missed!   (By the way, sadly, this isn\u2019t a joke.   I wish it was.)\n\nREMEMBER WHEN BILL CLINTON WAS PRESIDENT?\n(January 20, 1993 to January 20, 2001\u2014two terms)\n\nWhen Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over an attempt to reform health care. \n\nHer proposed plan was so bad that many Democrats came up with competing plans of their own in protest, and in spite of threats and intimidation, on September 26, 1994, the \u201cHillarycare\u201d bill was declared dead.\n\nThis fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million for studies, promotion, and other efforts.\n\nThen, President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general.  Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood\u2014both were forced to withdraw their names from consideration.  \n\nNext, she chose Janet Reno, which husband Bill described as \"my worst mistake.\"  \n\n(Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.)\n\nHusband Bill also allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission\u2014Lani Guanier was her selection. \n\nAfter considerable backlash from prominent Democratic senators concerning Ms. Guanier's radical views, Bill Clinton withdrew her name from nomination, stating that she did not represents the civil rights views that he had championed during his campaign.\n\nHowever, apparently a slow learner, husband Bill continued to allow Hillary to make more recommendations. \n\nShe chose former law partners, Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department. \n\nHer selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kennedy was forced to resign.  \n\n(Is anyone wondering yet what her Supreme Court Justice appointments would be like?)\n\nMany younger voters will have no knowledge of \"Travelgate,\" the first major ethics controversy during Bill\u2019s presidency.\n\nHillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend, Harry Thompson\u2014but the White House Travel Office refused to comply. \n\nShe trumped up allegations of financial mismanagement and reported seven long-time White House employees to the FBI.  This ruined their reputations, got them fired, and caused a thirty-six month investigation. \n\nEventually, most of the employees were reinstated and Clinton associates were forced out of the travel office. Only one White House employee, Billy Dale, was charged with a crime\u2014the enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds;  a jury acquitted him in less than two hours.\n\nStill not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House Security.  \n\nWhen Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies (Filegate) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff, suddenly Hillary and the President denied even knowing Livingstone, and of course, denied knowledge of drug use in the White House.\n\nFollowing this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents.\n\nNext, when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by Bill Clinton, Hillary was put in charge of the \"bimbo eruption\" and scandal defense. \n\nLet\u2019s look at some of her more notable decisions in this regard . . . \n\nShe urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation, they settled with Ms. Jones.  \n\nShe refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor.  \n\nAfter $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr's investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs.  \n\nHillary's devious game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for 'lying under oath' to a grand jury, followed by his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives.  \n\nHillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, \"I do not recall,\" \"I have no recollection,\" and \"I don't know\" a total of 56 times while under oath.   (Sound familiar?)  \n\nAfter leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had \"mistakenly thought was hers.\"\n\nSo you see, the email scandal and all of her malfeasance regarding the handling of Top Secret information, not to mention the \"pay to play\" schemes of the Clinton Foundation, are nothing new.  \n\nHillary\u2019s entire political career has been nothing but a web of lies, corruption and destruction in her quest for power.\n\nIs anyone else ready to say, \u201cEnough is enough!\u201d?\n\nBut unfortunately, I\u2019m sure her loyal fans will say, \"What difference does it make?\"",

Copied from another site..\n\nThis came from the Advocate (our local paper) and I am sharing it because it is exactly how most of us feel about Trump. The Media just doesn't get it....they can't believe that people are so angry that they can no longer be manipulated!\n\nMillions of trump supporters feel this way about Donald J. Trump.....\n\n\"We don't care if the guy swears... or how many times he's been married...or who he voted for, or what his income tax return shows. We want the problems fixed. Yes he's an egomaniac, but we don't care. We know he's not a racist, or bad to women, or all the other things the liberal media is trying to label him with. We know he's raised a good family, and that says a lot about him.\n\nThe country is a mess because politicians suck, the Republican Party is two faced & gutless, and illegals are everywhere and Muslims are openly trying to hurt this country and make the civilized world adjust to them. We want it all fixed!\n\nWe don't care that Trump is crude, we don't care that he has changed positions, we don't care that he fights with Megan Kelly, Rosie O'Donnell, and so many of the elected establishment. We don't care that Rubio, Ryan, the Bush's, and so many other top old and new Republicans refuse to endorse him for their own selfish reasons, and we know what they are. We don't care that he doesn't know the name of some Muslim terrorists, we don't care that he tried some businesses that didn't work out.\n\nThis country is weak, bankrupt, our enemies are making fun of us, we are being invaded by illegals, we are becoming a nation of victims, where every Tom, Ricardo and Hasid is a special group with special rights to a point where we don't even recognize the country we were born and raised in, AND WE JUST WANT IT FIXED. And TRUMP is the only guy who seems to understand what the people want.\n\nWe're sick of politicians, sick of the Democratic and Republican Party. We're angry about the Iran deal, the budget, treatment of Israel, military weakness, lobbyists, special interests, overpaid politicians with their self serving bills and back room deals, trade deals, loss of jobs, manipulated economic numbers, businesses fleeing, and even the phoney pay for play Clinton Foundation.\n\nAmericans are no longer going to be fooled, and the movement is out to change the direction we're taking. Trump may not be a saint, but he doesn't have lobbyist money holding him, he doesn't have political correctness restraining him, and all you know is that he has been very successful, a good negotiator, he has built a lot of things, he's flexible, and he's also not a politician. And he says he'll fix it. And we believe him because he is too much of an egotist to be proven wrong or looked at and called a liar.\n\nPublic service has become elected greed. This may be our only chance to have a non-politician, despite his flaws, try and correct the mess, at least for 4 years. We must take the shot, because the consequences of putting Hillary Clinton in office are frightening. There is a tidal wave happening, and its going to overcome much of what's happened to this country.\"\n\nDONALD TRUMP has my vote. NOTHING he ever said even slightly compares to the immoral, vile, corrupt ACTIONS of Bill and Hillary Clinton. Trump said some lewd WORDS, while Bill CLinton has actually RAPED, SEXUALLY ASSAULTED, and EXPOSED him self to women multiple times! Look it up, there are actual police reports. Hillary Clinton has defended a child rapist who Brutally raped a 12 year old girl (kathy shelton) put her in a coma, and Hillary got him off FREE, she admitted she knew he was guilty, and laughed about it!\nLOOK AT ALL YOU 'MORALLY SUPERIOR' FOLKS CASTING STONES. TRUMP is BY FAR the BETTER CHOICE.",

The one I loved was that, \u201cTrump is arrogant.\u201d My friend questioned if one man could make \u201cthat much difference in the world today.\u201d To my friend's credit, she was respectful enough to let me respond when she asked, \u201cReally, what has Trump done?\u201d\nI said, \u201cIn June of last year, Trump entered the race for president. In just a little over a year, Trump has single handedly defeated the Republican party. He did so thoroughly. In fact, he did so in such a resounding way that the Republican Party now suffers from an identity crisis. He literally dismantled the party. Trump even dismantled and dismissed the brand and value of the Bush family.\n Trump has Obama petrified that Trump will dismiss programs that weren\u2019t properly installed using proper law.\n Trump has single handedly debunked and disemboweled any value of news media as we knew it\u2014news now suffering from an all-time level of distrust and disrespect.\n Trump has leaders from all over the world talking about him, whether good or bad. Trust me, powerful men who have been president before weren\u2019t liked by the global community. I doubt Mikhail Gorbachev liked Reagan when Reagan said, \"Tear down that wall.\"\n Trump has expressly disclosed the fraud perpetrated on the American public by Hillary Clinton. He has, quite literally, brought Hillary to her knees\u2014if you believe that nervous tension and disorders offer physical side effects and damage.\n Trump has unified the silent majority in a way that should be patently frightening to \u201cliberals.\u201d\nAs the press accuses Trump of being a house of cards, Trump has proven the press is the real house of cards. He has whipped up the entire establishment into pure panic. Trump has exposed them for who they are and worse, what they are. George Clooney was right when he said Trump draws live news coverage of his podium that he\u2019s not yet approached. Thanks, George, you were perfectly correct.\n What we see as headline news today are actually the last bubbles from the ship that is now sunk\u2014meaning the standard news media, as a propaganda machine, has been exposed. They have no more value.\n In the same way Trump asked the African-American community this question, I asked my friend, \u201dAt this point, what do you have to lose?\u201d We have mass cop shootings, riots in our streets, ambushed cops, double digit inflation, bombs blowing up in our cities, targeted police, #BLM, a skyrocketing jobless rate, no economic growth, privately owned land being seized by the federal government, the worst racial tension in my lifetime, no God in schools, more abortions than ever, illegal aliens pouring into our country, sick veterans receiving no care, and a debt that doubled in seven years to $19 trillion. Are you really happy with the condition of the current system?\n One man has done all of this in one year\u2014one guy, and on his own dime. And with everything I\u2019ve written above, you believe Trump hasn't done anything? You claim that you are afraid of Donald Trump? No wonder we\u2019re in trouble. You can say that Trump is a lousy presidential candidate. That\u2019s your right. Just don\u2019t ever say he\u2019s not effective.\n That Megan Kelly, FOX News, CNN, MSNBC, Washington Post, Rachel Maddow, the Huffington Post, the New York Times, Raleigh\u2019s News and Observer, the AP, Don Lemon, Jake Tapper, and many more, failed to implement their collectively orchestrated lie on the American people against Trump, is actually a massive testament to Trump. The press colluded pure propaganda to accomplish his demise \u2026 and they have collectively failed and miserably.\n Here's just one example of how badly America is injured right now. There are high school football players on their knees during the national anthem simply because the press used as propaganda to program those kids to do that very thing. But, these kids are mimicking NFL stars the same way the same kids chooses which brand of football shoe to purchase\u2014they're overtly brain-washed to do that very thing.\n Now, we have a generation of children who hate America.\n America\u2019s problem isn\u2019t that little children are on their knee in collective disrespect of America. Our problem is that America is on her knee from collective disrespect by Americans.\n You can disrespect America all you want. But, it\u2019s high-time you respect the silent majority. Because they\u2019re not simply the \u201csilent majority\u201d as you\u2019ve been trained to believe when Hillary calls them \u201cdeplorables.\u201d The fact is, they are simply the majority. And now they're no longer silent either. Donald Trump changed all of that, single-handedly and within one year.\" From Be Forbes.\"\n Bebe Coe Bertino\n 9/29/2016 , this is a copy and paste, and needs to be read and spread!!",

Do you understand? Everything you do.\u201d\nIn the early 1990s, Bill Clinton invited a young female staffer to his hotel room at the Excelsior Hotel in Little Rock, dropped his pants and said, \u201cKiss it\u201d.

She may have volunteered for the sex at that young age but Monica Lewinsky didn\u2019t volunteer to be slandered!\nHillary Clinton deployed her aides and journalist friends, like Sidney Blumenthal, to spread rumors that Monica was a stalker, trying to blackmail the president and destroyed her life.\nHillary Clinton's recorded remark about the situation: she called Lewinsky \u201ca narcissistic loony tune\u201d.\nBill Clinton declared that he \u201chad not had sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky\u201d, ... which proved to be another lie.\nThe affair and its repercussions, which included Bill Clinton's impeachment, became known as the Lewinsky scandal.\nWhen an attractive woman desperately in need of a job came to Bill's office in 1993, instead of helping, he lunged at her, kissed her on the mouth, grabbed her breast and put her hand on his genitals. He later told a mistress that the claim was absurd because the woman, Kathleen Willey, had such small breasts.\nHillary Clinton went on 60 Minutes to slime nightclub singer Gennifer Flowers, knowing full well she was telling the truth about having an affair with Bill Clinton.

So when you say things about Donald Trump because he keeps bringing up the last 30 years with Hillary.... I'm afraid it's not as easy as saying she could have voted different. There's a very big picture here. And when you're still learning to ride a two-wheeler or playing with Barbie dolls or Hotwheels you don't realize this is what was going on in our country with Ms Hillary. Again, I can forgive things that Donald Trump may have said but these are things that Hillary Clinton has done.\n\nHow quickly we forget! If you\u2019re over 35, take a walk with me down memory lane\u2014you won\u2019t believe what you have forgotten. If you\u2019re under 35, read on\u2014I promise you that you will be amazed at what you missed! (By the way, sadly, this isn\u2019t a joke. I wish it was.)\n\nREMEMBER WHEN BILL CLINTON WAS PRESIDENT?\n(January 20, 1993 to January 20, 2001\u2014two terms)\n\nWhen Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over an attempt to reform health care. \n\nHer proposed plan was so bad that many Democrats came up with competing plans of their own in protest, and in spite of threats and intimidation, on September 26, 1994, the \u201cHillarycare\u201d bill was declared dead.\n\nThis fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million for studies, promotion, and other efforts.\n\nThen, President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general. Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood\u2014both were forced to withdraw their names from consideration.  \n\nNext, she chose Janet Reno, which husband Bill described as \"my worst mistake.\"  \n\n(Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.)\n\nHusband Bill also allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission\u2014Lani Guanier was her selection. \n\nAfter considerable backlash from prominent Democratic senators concerning Ms. Guanier's radical views, Bill Clinton withdrew her name from nomination, stating that she did not represents the civil rights views that he had championed during his campaign.\n\nHowever, apparently a slow learner, husband Bill continued to allow Hillary to make more recommendations. \n\nShe chose former law partners, Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department.\n\nHer selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kennedy was forced to resign.  \n\n(Is anyone wondering yet what her Supreme Court Justice appointments would be like?)\n\nMany younger voters will have no knowledge of \"Travelgate,\" the first major ethics controversy during Bill\u2019s presidency.\n\nHillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend, Harry Thompson\u2014but the White House Travel Office refused to comply. \n\nShe trumped up allegations of financial mismanagement and reported seven long-time White House employees to the FBI. This ruined their reputations, got them fired, and caused a thirty-six month investigation. \n\nEventually, most of the employees were reinstated and Clinton associates were forced out of the travel office. Only one White House employee, Billy Dale, was charged with a crime\u2014the enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds; a jury acquitted him in less than two hours.\n\nStill not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House Security.  \n\nWhen Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies (Filegate) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff, suddenly Hillary and the President denied even knowing Livingstone, and of course, denied knowledge of drug use in the White House.\n\nFollowing this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents.\n\nNext, when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by Bill Clinton, Hillary was put in charge of the \"bimbo eruption\" and scandal defense. \n\nLet\u2019s look at some of her more notable decisions in this regard . . . \n\nShe urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation, they settled with Ms. Jones.  \n\nShe refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor. \n\nAfter $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr's investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs.  \n\nHillary's devious game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for 'lying under oath' to a grand jury, followed by his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives.  \n\nHillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, \"I do not recall,\" \"I have no recollection,\" and \"I don't know\" a total of 56 times while under oath. (Sound familiar?)  \n\nAfter leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had \"mistakenly thought was hers.\"\n\nSo you see, the email scandal and all of her malfeasance regarding the handling of Top Secret information, not to mention the \"pay to play\" schemes of the Clinton Foundation, are nothing new.  \n\nHillary\u2019s entire political career has been nothing but a web of lies, corruption and destruction in her quest for power.\n\nanyone else ready to say, \u201cEnough is enough!\u201d?\n\nBut unfortunately, I\u2019m sure her loyal fans will say, \"What difference does it make?\"",

I'll tell you.\nFirst of all the number 2, by the way I love the number 2. It's probably my favorite number, no it is my favorite number. You know what, it's probably more like the number two but with a lot of zeros behind it. A lot. If I'm being honest, I mean, if I'm being honest. I like a lot of zeros. Except for Marco Rubio, now he's a zero that I don't like. Though, I probably shouldn't say that. He's a nice guy but he's like, \"10101000101\", on and on, like that. He's like a computer!

You know what, it's probably more like the number two but with a lot of zeros behind it. A lot. If I'm being honest, I mean, if I'm being honest. I like a lot of zeros. Except for Bernie Sanders, now he's a zero that I don't like. Though, I probably shouldn't say that. He's a nice guy but he's like, \"10101000101\", on and on, like that. He's like a computer! You know what I mean? He's like a computer. I don't know. I mean, you know.\nSo, we have all these numbers and we can add them and subtract them and add them. TIMES them even. Did you know that? We can times them OR divide them, they don't tell you that, and I'll tell you, no one is better at the order of operations than me. You wouldn't believe it. That I can tell you.

                  "message": "\"Last night a friend claimed that Donald Trump wouldn\u2019t make a good president; he is brash, he is racist, he is a loudmouth; you know the normal things people learn to recite after being programmed by television news. The one I loved was that, \u201cTrump is arrogant.\u201d My friend questioned if one man could make \u201cthat much difference in the world today.\u201d To my friend's credit, she was respectful enough to let me respond when she asked, \u201cReally, what has Trump done?\u201d\n\nI said, \u201cIn June of last year, Trump entered the race for president. In just a little over a year, Trump has single handedly defeated the Republican party. He did so thoroughly. In fact, he did so in such a resounding way that the Republican Party now suffers from an identity crisis. He literally dismantled the party. Trump even dismantled and dismissed the brand and value of the Bush family.\n\nTrump has Obama petrified that Trump will dismiss programs that weren\u2019t properly installed using proper law.\n\nTrump has single handedly debunked and disemboweled any value of news media as we knew it\u2014news now suffering from an all-time level of distrust and disrespect. \n\nTrump has leaders from all over the world talking about him, whether good or bad. Trust me, powerful men who have been president before weren\u2019t liked by the global community. I doubt Mikhail Gorbachev liked Reagan when Reagan said, \"Tear down that wall.\"\n\nTrump has expressly disclosed the fraud perpetrated on the American public by Hillary Clinton. He has, quite literally, brought Hillary to her knees\u2014if you believe that nervous tension and disorders offer physical side effects and damage. \n\nTrump has unified the silent majority in a way that should be patently frightening to \u201cliberals.\u201d \n\nAs the press accuses Trump of being a house of cards, Trump has proven the press is the real house of cards. He has whipped up the entire establishment into pure panic. Trump has exposed them for who they are and worse, what they are. George Clooney was right when he said Trump draws live news coverage of his podium that he\u2019s not yet approached. Thanks, George, you were perfectly correct. \n\nWhat we see as headline news today are actually the last bubbles from the ship that is now sunk\u2014meaning the standard news media, as a propaganda machine, has been exposed. They have no more value. \n\nIn the same way Trump asked the African-American community this question, I asked my friend, \u201dAt this point, what do you have to lose?\u201d We have mass cop shootings, riots in our streets, ambushed cops, double digit inflation, bombs blowing up in our cities, targeted police, #BLM, a skyrocketing jobless rate, no economic growth, privately owned land being seized by the federal government, the worst racial tension in my lifetime, no God in schools, more abortions than ever, illegal aliens pouring into our country, sick veterans receiving no care, and a debt that doubled in seven years to $19 trillion. Are you really happy with the condition of the current system? \n\nOne man has done all of this in one year\u2014one guy, and on his own dime. And with everything I\u2019ve written above, you believe Trump hasn't done anything? You claim that you are afraid of Donald Trump? No wonder we\u2019re in trouble. You can say that Trump is a lousy presidential candidate. That\u2019s your right. Just don\u2019t ever say he\u2019s not effective. \n\nThat Megan Kelly, FOX News, CNN, MSNBC, Washington Post, Rachel Maddow, the Huffington Post, the New York Times, Raleigh\u2019s News and Observer, the AP, Don Lemon, Jake Tapper, and many more, failed to implement their collectively orchestrated lie on the American people against Trump, is actually a massive testament to Trump. The press colluded pure propaganda to accomplish his demise \u2026 and they have collectively failed and miserably. \n\nHere's just one example of how badly America is injured right now. There are high school football players on their knees during the national anthem simply because the press used as propaganda to program those kids to do that very thing. But, these kids are mimicking NFL stars the same way the same kids chooses which brand of football shoe to purchase\u2014they're overtly brain-washed to do that very thing. \n\nNow, we have a generation of children who hate America.\n\nAmerica\u2019s problem isn\u2019t that little children are on their knee in collective disrespect of America. Our problem is that America is on her knee from collective disrespect by Americans. \n\nYou can disrespect America all you want. But, it\u2019s high-time you respect the silent majority. Because they\u2019re not simply the \u201csilent majority\u201d as you\u2019ve been trained to believe when Hillary calls them \u201cdeplorables.\u201d The fact is, they are simply the majority. And now they're no longer silent either. Donald Trump changed all of that, single-handedly and within one year.' \n-- by Be Forbes",

Corroborated by five contemporaneous witnesses\n\nKnowing full well about Bill Clinton\u2019s proclivity to sexually assault women, about three weeks after that rape, Hillary Clinton cornered Broaddrick at a party and said, pointedly, \u201cI just want you to know how much Bill and I appreciate the things you do for him. Do you understand? Everything you do.\u201d\n\nIn the early 1990s, Bill Clinton invited a young female staffer to his hotel room at the Excelsior Hotel in Little Rock, dropped his pants and said, \u201cKiss it\u201d. This was Paula Jones and she received a $ 850.000.00 settlement....Clinton rather settled than go further.\n\nIn 1995 Bill Clinton had a young female intern just perform oral sex on him while he made business calls right in the Oval Office. That girl\u2019s name was Monica Lewinsky. She may have volunteered for the sex at that young age but Monica Lewinsky didn\u2019t volunteer to be slandered! \n\nHillary Clinton deployed her aides and journalist friends, like Sidney Blumenthal, to spread rumors that Monica was a stalker, trying to blackmail the president and destroyed her life.\n\nHillary Clinton's recorded remark about the situation: she called Lewinsky \u201ca narcissistic loony tune\u201d.\n\nBill Clinton declared that he \u201chad not had sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky\u201d, ... which proved to be another lie. \n\nThe affair and its repercussions, which included Bill Clinton's impeachment, became known as the Lewinsky scandal.\n\nWhen an attractive woman desperately in need of a job came to Bill's office in 1993, instead of helping, he lunged at her, kissed her on the mouth, grabbed her breast and put her hand on his genitals. He later told a mistress that the claim was absurd because the woman, Kathleen Willey, had such small breasts.\n\nHillary Clinton went on 60 Minutes to slime nightclub singer Gennifer Flowers, knowing full well she was telling the truth about having an affair with Bill Clinton. Hillary Clinton implied Genniger Flowers belonged in a loony bin, telling millions of viewers \u201cevery time she called, distraught\u2026 she said sort of wacky things.\u201d\n\nAfter denying it first, in his presidential deposition in January 1998, Bill Clinton admitted that he had a sexual encounter with Flowers. \n\nThe Clintons are evil and Hillary has destroyed many women's lives knowing fully well that they did not lie about their sexual encounters with her pervert husband Bill Clinton. \n\nHillary is NOT FOR WOMEN! \n\nBill Clinton visited Orgy Island (young girls as young as 12 years old) 26 times with his good friend, registered sex offender and billionaire Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein\u2019s Boeing 727 is so notorious that it earned the nickname the \u201cLolita Express.\u201d And flight logs now reveal that former President Bill Clinton took 26 trips on his jet \n\nPlz copy and share so younger voters can learn who the Clintons are...",

Do you understand? Everything you do.\u201d\n\nIn the early 1990s, Bill Clinton invited a young female staffer to his hotel room at the Excelsior Hotel in Little Rock, dropped his pants and said, \u201cKiss it\u201d. This was Paula Jones and she received a $ 850.000.00 settlement....Clinton rather settled than go further.\n\nIn 1995 Bill Clinton had a young female intern just perform oral sex on him while he made business calls right in the Oval Office. That girl\u2019s name was Monica Lewinsky. She may have volunteered for the sex at that young age but Monica Lewinsky didn\u2019t volunteer to be slandered! \n\nHillary Clinton deployed her aides and journalist friends, like Sidney Blumenthal, to spread rumors that Monica was a stalker, trying to blackmail the president and destroyed her life.\n\nHillary Clinton's recorded remark about the situation: she called Lewinsky \u201ca narcissistic loony tune\u201d.\n\nBill Clinton declared that he \u201chad not had sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky\u201d, ... which proved to be another lie. \n\nThe affair and its repercussions, which included Bill Clinton's impeachment, became known as the Lewinsky scandal.\n\nWhen an attractive woman desperately in need of a job came to Bill's office in 1993, instead of helping, he lunged at her, kissed her on the mouth, grabbed her breast and put her hand on his genitals. He later told a mistress that the claim was absurd because the woman, Kathleen Willey, had such small breasts.\n\nHillary Clinton went on 60 Minutes to slime nightclub singer Gennifer Flowers, knowing full well she was telling the truth about having an affair with Bill Clinton. Hillary Clinton implied Genniger Flowers belonged in a loony bin, telling millions of viewers \u201cevery time she called, distraught\u2026 she said sort of wacky things.\u201d\n\nAfter denying it first, in his presidential deposition in January 1998, Bill Clinton admitted that he had a sexual encounter with Flowers. \n\nThe Clintons are evil and Hillary has destroyed many women's lives knowing fully well that they did not lie about their sexual encounters with her pervert husband Bill Clinton. \n\nHillary is NOT FOR WOMEN! \n\nBill Clinton visited Orgy Island (young girls as young as 12 years old) 26 times with his good friend, registered sex offender and billionaire Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein\u2019s Boeing 727 is so notorious that it earned the nickname the \u201cLolita Express.\u201d And flight logs now reveal that former President Bill Clinton took 26 trips on his jet \n\nPlz copy and share so younger voters can learn who the Clintons are...",

If you\u2019re over 35, take a walk with me down memory lane\u2014you won\u2019t believe what you have forgotten.  If you\u2019re under 35, read on\u2014I promise you that you will be amazed at what you missed!   (By the way, sadly, this isn\u2019t a joke.   I wish it was.)\n\nREMEMBER WHEN BILL CLINTON WAS PRESIDENT?\n(January 20, 1993 to January 20, 2001\u2014two terms)\n\nWhen Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over an attempt to reform health care. \n\nHer proposed plan was so bad that many Democrats came up with competing plans of their own in protest, and in spite of threats and intimidation, on September 26, 1994, the \u201cHillarycare\u201d bill was declared dead.\n\nThis fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million for studies, promotion, and other efforts.\n\nThen, President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general.  Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood\u2014both were forced to withdraw their names from consideration.  \n\nNext, she chose Janet Reno, which husband Bill described as \"my worst mistake.\"  \n\n(Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.)\n\nHusband Bill also allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission\u2014Lani Guanier was her selection. \n\nAfter considerable backlash from prominent Democratic senators concerning Ms. Guanier's radical views, Bill Clinton withdrew her name from nomination, stating that she did not represents the civil rights views that he had championed during his campaign.\n\nHowever, apparently a slow learner, husband Bill continued to allow Hillary to make more recommendations. \n\nShe chose former law partners, Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department. \n\nHer selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kennedy was forced to resign.  \n\n(Is anyone wondering yet what her Supreme Court Justice appointments would be like?)\n\nMany younger voters will have no knowledge of \"Travelgate,\" the first major ethics controversy during Bill\u2019s presidency.\n\nHillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend, Harry Thompson\u2014but the White House Travel Office refused to comply. \n\nShe trumped up allegations of financial mismanagement and reported seven long-time White House employees to the FBI.  This ruined their reputations, got them fired, and caused a thirty-six month investigation. \n\nEventually, most of the employees were reinstated and Clinton associates were forced out of the travel office. Only one White House employee, Billy Dale, was charged with a crime\u2014the enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds;  a jury acquitted him in less than two hours.\n\nStill not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House Security.  \n\nWhen Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies (Filegate) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff, suddenly Hillary and the President denied even knowing Livingstone, and of course, denied knowledge of drug use in the White House.\n\nFollowing this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents.\n\nNext, when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by Bill Clinton, Hillary was put in charge of the \"bimbo eruption\" and scandal defense. \n\nLet\u2019s look at some of her more notable decisions in this regard . . . \n\nShe urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation, they settled with Ms. Jones.  \n\nShe refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor.  \n\nAfter $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr's investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs.  \n\nHillary's devious game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for 'lying under oath' to a grand jury, followed by his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives.  \n\nHillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, \"I do not recall,\" \"I have no recollection,\" and \"I don't know\" a total of 56 times while under oath.   (Sound familiar?)  \n\nAfter leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had \"mistakenly thought was hers.\"\n\nSo you see, the email scandal and all of her malfeasance regarding the handling of Top Secret information, not to mention the \"pay to play\" schemes of the Clinton Foundation, are nothing new.  \n\nHillary\u2019s entire political career has been nothing but a web of lies, corruption and destruction in her quest for power.\n\nIs anyone else ready to say, \u201cEnough is enough!\u201d?\n\nBut unfortunately, I\u2019m sure her loyal fans will say, \"What difference does it make?\"",

As a veteran I think of my comrades my peers I had in the military who are still there...so I ask\nWhat can you as President of the United States do to get this war in the middle east over and especially that old long going war in Afghanistan? Our troops have been deployment after deployment. What is the end game for that war in each of your proposals? \nAre you prepared to be engaged to actively win that war, or just half sort of win in afghanistan? If we are there another 4 or 8 years during your tenor as president are you just going to handle that situation in afghanistan at a leisurely pace and pass the buck to the next commander in chief or can we actually have some good results and end deployment there? Either commit to the war in afghanistan and a better strategy to bring it to a satisfying end and peace or bring our soldiers home. Troops are still engaged over there, losing there lives, and for what a little piece of ground that comes and goes with the wind. Its like the media has forgotten to ask what is end result for that war because all eyes are on Syria which is just as important, but I wish we could finish what we deployed to Afghanistan for in the first place.",

You know what, it's probably more like the number two but with a lot of zeros behind it. A lot. If I'm being honest, I mean, if I'm being honest. I like a lot of zeros. Except for Marco Rubio, now he's a zero that I don't like. Though, I probably shouldn't say that. He's a nice guy but he's like, \"10101000101\", on and on, like that. He's like a computer! You know what I mean? He's like a computer. I don't know. I mean, you know. \n So, we have all these numbers and we can add them and subtract them and add them. TIMES them even. Did you know that? We can times them OR divide them, they don't tell you that, and I'll tell you, no one is better at the order of operations than me. You wouldn't believe it. That I can tell you.

But let's not fool each other here, I've been out with with the guys in my 53 years, and some of the things that I've heard them say about women this doesn't come as a surprise and all you men that read this know exactly what I'm talking about. On that note I've also been out and overheard women talking and heard just as bad if not worse. I've held a security clearance for 30 years. I have a spotless record. If I had done what Hillary Clinton has done I would be terminated from my federal position. Unable to hold another Federal position ever again. Unable to hold and qualify for a security clearance. And would be subject and more than likely be prosecuted for violation of a number of United States codes that I swore an oath to uphold . I really I'm trying to figure out why this country is so jacked up. So I guess it's  more important what somebody said about a woman than the way somebody handled critical National Security. Ponder this for a minute if Hillary Clinton gets in office she will be taking Bill Clinton with her he will be sleeping in the White House does everybody forget what he did. Does everybody forget what he did with his cigars. The man was impeached and he's going to end up back in the white house again. I guess everybody forgets about the cigars. Hillary didn't seem to have a problem with it and neither do her supporters.",
