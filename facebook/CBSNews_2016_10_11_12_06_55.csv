The hiker was walking alone on a trail when an adult bear stood on its hind legs. As they eyed each other, the second bear came out of nowhere and attacked.

1 | Hap Brindle | The FCC should revoke CBS's license over the shameless 1-1/2 hour Trump bashing, Hillary infomercial they did on CBS This Morning. Chucky and the Witches, along with the entire production staff and management at CBS should be immediately fired!

The "Apprentice" executive producer says they can't legally release the footage from the reality show.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Luisa Inez Newton | In other words, since Trump owns part of the show, MGM is afraid of a lawsuit, but if MGM really loves the USA, they should go ahead and release the garbage from the Apprentice and damn the consequences
2 | Patricia Ann Mangan-Aguiar | Private comments should stay private.How about we look up the Clintons private comments.Like the time Hillary, while Senator, ripped her chauffeur and security a trail of nasty words. While drinking Booze in the backseat.
3 | Jeff Autrey | As if any more is necessary for intelligent thinking individuals to assess the incompetence of Donald J Trump to be president of this country. The man calls his own daughter a piece of ass.
4 | Don Malbuco | When confronted with these tapes Trump will reply, I will defeat ISIS. Lol
5 | David H Craig | Hey, Hillary Clinton continues to insulted Americans! She called Donald Trump's supporters "a basket of deplorables" Bernie Sanders supporters "basement dwellers" Millennials "a bucket of losers" Blacks "super-predators" and now Black and Muslims "professional never-do-wells"She insulted about 75% of all Americans.Special thanks for the emails WikiLeaks!If you agree with Hillary Clinton then vote for her!
6 | Elizabeth ParentiSchmehl | Look, look, look --- report it the right way......CNN asked someone this morning would you have preferred Trump to have talked about issues at the debate instead of talking about Bill Clinton's past indiscretions and inviting those four women to sit in the audience.A:  Let's keep in mind what really happened at that last debate.B: Our infamous Hillary Clinton stated "Loud and Clear" that she was saving her comments concerning Donald's vulgar words on that 11 year old tape for the night of the debate.TRANSLATION -- Hillary was planning an ambush to assassinate his character the night of the debate.  All he did was prepare himself for her wicked ways.C:  And prepare himself he did.D:  Let's clarify something -- Donald Trump is more than willing and more than capable of taking about issues facing America.  I watch most of his speeches on the campaign trail and he does it all the time.E: However, not only was he prepared and willing to talk about issues, he also came prepared to defeat Hillary in her attempt to assassinate his character, and defeat her he did.Bravo Donald Trump --- mission accomplished.
7 | Kenny Chasteen | Boy y'all are something else...crush your company just make a liar look good killary owns y'all ass nobody believes the media anymore y'all are a bunch of liars and hypocrites
8 | Douglas J Fitch | Footage not needed...we know The Don is a piece of shit. If he gets elected...folks like me (the Jimmy Fallon type) will have a lot of material to use. Four years of humor that will never get old.
9 | Welsh Jhoulys | I would suggest that both candidates remove themselves. It doesn't make any sense for just Trump to drop out when Hillary Clinton conspired to destroy Bill Clinton's sexual abuse victims. This is a far more heinous offense than Trump's ugly comments. If Hillary drops out, Trump will drop out! Both parties can refer to their charter to determine the replacement candidates.
10 | Hap Brindle | The FCC should revoke CBS's license over the shameless 1-1/2 hour Trump bashing, Hillary infomercial they did on CBS This Morning. Chucky and the Witches, along with the entire production staff and management at CBS should be immediately fired!

Trump introduced crowds to his biggest, or smallest, look-alike fan at a rally yesterday.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Lois Grubb | That is just to cute!!!!  Too bad these hating trolls can't find the cuteness in just the picture and instead of spewing their hate just because it's not the candidate they want.  Real adult people real adult.
2 | Laura Beth | No way does that toddler look like that man! He probably whispered in the little guys ear "don't cry, I'll give you candy". Poor childüòû
3 | Benjamin Smith | These comments are funny! The shit you people say is down right disgusting yet you hate Trump for the same thing? Is it only ok if it's directed at the people you dislike? You are far more deplorable than we will ever be!
4 | PW Covington | STOP normalizing this Fascist!NOTHING about this person entitles him to sympathetic treatment by media. His very existence is a clear and present threat to everything our nation represents and stands for.
5 | Jim Gavin | GO TRUMP. We need you now more then ever. People are starting to see that just because the haters say and call you the names they do, that none of it is true. They say it but have yet to provide any facts to the hateful names they spew about you.
6 | ShaShauna Lynette Staton | Donald Trump is a douche we all know that, but this video is cute and the little boy is cute. Let's recap, trump douche, kid video cute! Not everything has to be hateful
7 | Ken McWilliams | Christian missionaries have preached for centuries "Bring them young." They know that if you brainwash a person while they are impressionable children they are less likely to question you later. That boy's parents learned the lesson well.
8 | Hap Brindle | The FCC should revoke CBS's license over the shameless 1-1/2 hour Trump bashing, Hillary infomercial they did on CBS This Morning. Chucky and the Witches, along with the entire production staff and management at CBS should be immediately fired!
9 | Tim Bain | yes it was a great scene.. but .. there was another in Pennsylvania.. WOW.. did you see the crowd of over 10,000 Trump supporters in Pennsylvania shouting "CNN sucks .. CNN sucks" now that was a great sight... ummmmmmm could CBS be next...:)

11 | Alex Mogo | When The Trump Campaign sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're sending red necks. They're sending white trash. They're sending low life POS. There sending the KKK , They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems to us. They're bringing hate. They're bringing fear. They're deplorable and some, I assume are good people!!!???https://www.usa.gov/register-to-vote Register To Vote Before Its to late
12 | Kathy Harvey | I am voting for closed borders and the supreme court...I dont intend on dating either one of the president nominees or their spouses
13 | Ganesh K. Nathan | Trump has already lost the election,he is only going to be a nuisance & an eyesore until Election Day!
14 | Butch Ored | What ALL people need to realize is that Love Trump or Hate Trump,he is our LAST BEST chance to dismantle the Washington Political machine - The Establishment, that has been the ROOT cause for most of the problems in the United States for the last 30 years or more.The Political Machine is exempt from most of the Laws they create, they are exempt from ODumboCare,they are extremely overpaid, they enjoy benefits that we, the people, pay for. And they have LUCRATIVE LIFETIME salaries that we pay for. Doesn't anyone out there notice that when someone enters this Political Machine, they end up VERY RICH in a very short time ? They become entrenched in the Machine.The DemonRATS hate him, The RepubliCANTS hate him, Wall Street hates him, Islam Hates him.Yet he is endorsed by Police Unions, the Border Patrol, The Fireman's Unions, Religious entities, Atheists, and most everyone else that would like to see established Politicians get FIRED.He is not paid by special interests including foreign interests. He is beholding to No-One. It will be a very long time that another SELF-ENABLED candidate is put before us. The Political Machine will NOT let this happen again.
15 | Monty Black | They promised that kid a happy meal to hang out with the creepy orange guy with funny hair
16 | Bridgette Polk | I disagree no child is as ugly as Donald Trump. The kid was handsome Donald Trump not so much
17 | Aerin Freno | What an adorable moment for Trump!! Too cute!!!  What a lovely child <3
18 | Zeeshan Mahmud | At least he didn't say, "But the Donald is much too good-looking."
19 | Vela Flaca | The parents should be so proud! Maybe this kiddo can grab *pu##6 to.
20 | Rafael Perez | Oh God! Please continue to help us deal with Trump and his zombies. Amen.
21 | Lee Russ | If a kid was handed to killary it would burst into flames....she's blame America.
22 | Parry Young | Look at all the hating trolls. But yet they think they are better than the Trump supporters. Hypocrisy is running a muck.
23 | Beverly Crawford | The young boy is a cutie.....but he doesn't look anything at all like Trump  !!!
24 | Elena Lauren | Oh look!! Someone that can speak to trump in two word sentences. Lol

1 | Betsy Salguero | How lovely -_- I've had my "safe" note 7 for 2 weeks with no issues what so ever. If I am forced to replace it I refuse to go to Apple. Guess my next phone could possibly be the V20 or the Asus phone zenfone 3 deluxe.
2 | Hap Brindle | The FCC should revoke CBS's license over the shameless 1-1/2 hour Trump bashing, Hillary infomercial they did on CBS This Morning. Chucky and the Witches, along with the entire production staff and management at CBS should be immediately fired!
3 | Drew Gurski | Can Samsung stop Donald Trump for the sake of consumer safety as well?
4 | Russell Place | I phones are blowing up too. It's just that apple don't care.

‚ÄúMy only advice to Republican leaders is simple. In the end, you either help defeat Hillary Clinton or you help elect Hillary Clinton,‚Äù said Newt Gingrich.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Charles Stroker | As a disabled veteran and a Republican, Trump has hurt my feelings, and sentiments of millions of people all over the world. I think I'll be voting for Hillary Clinton.
2 | Luisa Inez Newton | What else would expect from an adulterer like Newt who was cheating on his own wife while excoriating Bill Clinton for the same thing back in the 1990s?  Newt is a hypocrite with the same lack of a moral compass as Trump, and Newt has a "woman problem" just like the entire GOP has a "woman problem."
3 | Tony Russell | People who use the word Killary and Libtard aren't capable of holding an intelligent conversation. And who cares what Newt Gingrich thinks anyways?
4 | Patricia Resetar | So basically what you're saying is that America is screwed either way, Newt!  Well, I guess I'll vote for HRC then.  I trust her far more than the Cheeto.
5 | Heidi McCann | Winning is always important. But, is it so important that they rather put someone like Trump in the white house, knowing how dangerous he is, just so they don't lose? If so, then they are only thinking of themselves and not for the security of our country.
6 | Carol Burns | Republicans want to stack the Supreme Court with justices that will revoke Roe vs Wade, Obama care and the right for gays to marry. Read page 10 of their platform. They need a Republican President and congress to do it.
7 | JoAnn Pavlick | Really...CLINTON has more of a reason to work with the current congress to move things forward...if the Republicans want crazy gridlock and insanity....Trumps is their man.....He has no reasonable plan for this country....and contrary to Trumps beliefs....it takes more than the president to get things done....it would be four years of The Apprentice.
8 | Kanokwan Nok | Trying to be loyal to your party and vote for your devil choice equals betrayal your own nation and supporting dictatorship under Trump's deplorable empire.
9 | Rory Nicole | Dear Newt Gingrich you either elect the woman who will safely lead us into the future or the man who will hit "the button" in the middle of the night in a tweet storm. Easy choice America.
10 | Louis Morningstar | What I'm hearing is, you stand with a slimy thuggish moron or you stand against a slimy thuggish moron!They hate Dems so much that they would allow that orange piece of filth to represent their party!
11 | Bill Osborn | Or viewed another way, you either elect Trump or you defeat Trump. Trump has no real affiliation with the Republican Party and he carries few of their core values. He is Republican by label alone and only switched parties in hopes of running for president. He is just searching for ways to get more power.
12 | Hedwig Yankowy | GOP needs to clean up its own party or they are stuck with garbage for candidates just like or worse than Trump!  The party of "family values" has rejected the old fashioned values for those of alley cats.
13 | Andy Thornburgh | Look, the man who left a wife while she was on the deathbead so he could shack up with someone else said Trump is ok!  He's fine people, totally fine!
14 | Selina Kelley | That's what it boils down to. I would just like to know if anybody, I mean anybody has asked him why he talks like this?, acts like this? Was it a bad childhood?, he's just a bully?, he thinks everything should go his way?, he doesn't like other opinions? he doesn't know when to shut up?. Is everybody scared of him? I would do it in a heartbeat. I don't want any more apologies. Put him in touch with me and I'll ask him. I'll do the same for Hilary, also. There's alot of questions for her, too. I'll be fair to both. The questions will be equally as tough for one as it is for the other. Bring it on!
15 | Vicky Hamm | Or you vote for your country a,sane leader and possibly salvage the house and senate....remember a lot of Trumps spokemen in Trumps words "i buy politicians or find a way to make them beholden to me"....beholden aka blackmail.....
16 | Christine Baronak | I am voting to help America in it crisis of need, and the only one that can help is Trump. I do not care what he said about women has nothing to do with it. hilLIARy on the other hand lied, killed, cheated, and did nothing for the American people while she was in the NY Senate, Secretary of State or the first lady.
17 | Bennie Humphries | My advice to Newt Gingrich is, you are either looking out for the best interests of the country, or the best interests of your party. I think we know what he is doing! I've NEVER been a fan of his. He only looks out for himself and the GOP, somewhere in between he forgot about our country.....a long time ago! Republican leaders should not be taking advice from a partisan GOP member. If they want the GOP to survive, they best take Trump out of the equation!
18 | Borly Green | I wonder would he be to advise the same thing to a democrat if the roles were reversed. Nope, he would have been the first to light up the torch. This is exactly what's wrong with Republicans do whatever it takes as long as Democrat gets beat even at the cost of the people.
19 | Stephen Edens | Let's be clear about this... We expect the Republican Party to fully endorse and support their nominee. This hyprocracy about sex talk years ago is nothing compared to the risk of a Clinton Presidency. We totally need Republican control in all aspects of government and to move forward to Make America Great Again.
20 | Steve Talley | Hillary is far more favorable to big money republicans than Trump. They don't want anyone messing with the way thing are now. Of course they're trying to defeat him. She's more "republican" on economic issues than just about any declared republican.
21 | Michael C. McGregor | Newt you are another one who does not care about the mean nasty and dirty things that comes out of his mouth about women and others. Birds of a Feather!!  Republicans ~ Blind Deaf and Dumb... anything goes evidently!!
22 | Corey Scott | As Americans can we agree on one thing! They all cheated on their wives,  just like so many other Presidents, and they should be answering to their wives! Bill, Donald, JFK, the whole lot of them, doesn't make it right! If these women stay with them, sorry it's between married people!
23 | Marvin DeJaynes | They want business as usual. They also know now that this will end if Trump is elected. Go ahead and bail on YOUR nominee, then watch your party end................. LOSER REPUBLICANS.
24 | Alfred Torres III | There is also that whole "moral high ground" and "Christ-like compassion" thing the GOP used to stand for, but I guess that can take a backseat as long as you defeat Hillary. Cool story bro.
25 | Jeremy Black | And if you're blindly pushing for a guy you hate and don't support just because of an R or D next to their name you're an idiot who's everything wrong with this country right now.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no excuse to talk that way about women, to women, to other people,‚Äù Detroit Lions wide receiver Golden Tate said.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Lance Eric | You dam well know they talk like that in a locker room, jus as much as women do in their own social setting.. I call bullshit cuz everyone wants to take a cheap shot when they can. F**kin bullshit and you know it!!
2 | Catherine Schmidt French | I bet he has the London Bridge to sell in the Arizona desert also.  He sure has NOT been in every locker.  He seems to forgot the other investigations into sports people and harassments against women.
3 | Michael Bullock | On his Twitter, it says he follows Wiz Khalifa:  Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, if you suck and swallowSmell that marijuana, they gon' followThrowin' money on her like she won the lottoPussy must be serious, hol' upScared of heights come face your fears, hol' up hol' upDo it just like Nicki gon' and bend it overBullspit Golden Tate, you're a liar.
4 | Kevin Farmer | I am used to really stupid stuff coming out of the mouths of the people on the news desks but this morning CBS had an article on "locker room talk". This lady went to some professional athletes and asked them about the talk in the locker rooms. "Locker room talk" is a phrase and these athletes are not going to tell the truth on national TV or to a beautiful woman for that matter. What he said was inappropriate however it was meant to be said in private and never meant to be acted out.
5 | Lynn Seele | I have been in many women`s locker room in my life and I can attest we will give any men`s locker room a good run for their money in most any off colour topic especially sexual.Pro athletes are maybe more sensitive than the rest of us.
6 | Jonathon Fryman | These guys are not world leaders, they play sports for a living and have too much influence on what other people do. That being said, as a Lions fan, I believe what he says. They may not always win their games, but the Detroit Lions do have a high character team
7 | Janet JayCee Cheshier | And Bill Clinton is what??? OH YEAH.. its ok that he got his knob slobbed under the RESOLUTE DESK ... then bent the bitch over on TOP of it and screwed the HELL out of her... or should I say THEM ... I forget... You are SO RIGHT!
8 | Joe Alfonso | I'm staying away from whatever locker rooms Trump goes to. üôÑ for real. I never heard anything like that in a locker room, and if I did I would keep that dude away from my daughter.
9 | Sara A. Charves | Oh shut already.....stop beating a dead horse........I've heard worse....hell I've seen worse....Go to a Miley Cyrus concert.......lol .....using a decade old audio of a private conversation is pathetic.....if who ever released it was that concerned..why now? A month from elections? Other than to try and hand Hillary the election? Still voting Trump.....never wavered....and as for saying that's not locker room talk...a decade ago before the PC police it sure as hell was..how much are these "men" being paid to lie?
10 | Donnie James Shores | Sure. Ask the black guy. Because you know, the media says Trump is racist. Of course the black guy isn't going to side with him. I care as much about a fucking athletes opinion as I do about the opinion of pompous ass Deniro. The guy who has planned some of the most evil, twisted characters ever on screen, as long as he got paid for it then it's ok. I wish these overpaid twats would just shut the fuck up.
11 | Romulus Johnson | Trump is stuck in the tos mentally. Locker rooms are a reflection of the ppl in them. Just line it was wrong for older generals to assume young soldiers were the raging homophobes they were and would oppose serving with out colleagues its wrong of Trump and others to assume today's athletes are the kind of sexist pig Trump is.
12 | Annette Hilbert | CBS is fool of crap now we shouldn't let kids watch the debate an no one should  forget what bill did to woman he acted on his impulses over an over an if CBS thinks it is OK an thinks what trump did was worse then we really have to sit back and wonder why CBS is bound an determined to have hillary win the election an why is Gail king even on tv who did she sleep with oh yeah oprah....white woman aren't Madd about what he said heck most would have a smile that a man of his caliber would notice they were alive so don't start another race war an drag white woman in it
13 | Ogechi Onwubu | There's a difference between talking/bragging about sex (regardless of how lewd it may be) and bragging about sexual assault PLUS sharing tips on how to sexually assault a woman without consequences. It's disturbing (and very telling) that some people can't distinguish the difference between the two. üôÑ
14 | Briana Maureen Pennington | Oh my gosh. Just about every man has said something like that about women. They just weren't on camera. Oh well. Why is this such a big deal. Trump might had said this but his opponents husband  did it. And Hillary made the women sound like trash and called them liars. Every man talks that way. Other things need to be on the news. This is stupid.
15 | Jared McManus | Anybody ever say "I'd hit that", or "nice ass", or "damn those abs", watched Porn, read a soft Porn novel, ect ect ect has done the same thing trump did. Get over yourselves and focus on the actual issues.
16 | Duncan McQuarrie | So funny coming from a black guy who listens to rap music about abusing woman to get up before the game. I hope he Supports Black Lives Matter who think its OK to kill cops.
17 | Joe Goodman | More and more Trumpetts are now following Alex Jones.....quoting and then post his words.You know the Republican Party is off the rails when Alex Jones is one of your main sources of information.
18 | Robert Poindexter | I don't support trump or Hillary but does the media honestly think these players are telling the truth...#americathemoronic
19 | Joseph Hicks | Anyone who's deflecting this by pointing a locker rooms and saying that what Trump did isn't a big deal is missing the point. It's a bullshit excuse. I wouldn't want anyone describing my wife, daughter, or mother that way, regardless of what they do, and especially not if they're going to be President of the United States. Plus, if you take him at his word (and Trump supporters love to say that Donald means what he says), then Trump is guilty of sexually assaulting women.  He's completely repugnant. And while I have my own doubts about Hillary Clinton, I'm glad Trump is going to get creamed in four weeks. Maybe he'll learn some humility, but I doubt it.
20 | Gregory Kitchens | They are lying. I guess they forget that many, many Americans have spent time in locker rooms. From the army to high school athletics, what he said was mild compared to the usual locker room talk. Besides, it was 11 years ago, it was a private conversation, and he apologized. Better than anything Hillary has ever done. And finally, probably 85% of today's popular music is worse than what he said. So the fact that it bothers anyone generally proves that most of the people it does bother are hypocritical liars. Kind of makes sense now why Clinton has voters.
21 | Cameron Franklin | I agree with what many athletes are saying about Donald Trump's now notorious sexist comments that were unearthed over the weekend through a highly controversial hot mic tape where he, along with "Today" co-host Billy Bush, can be heard making extremely sexist comments and ESPECIALLY dissing "Entertainment Tonight" co-host Nancy O'Dell, to which she IS INDEED the woman that Donald himself dissed in the video when Billy was a host on "Access Hollywood" just over a decade ago.  And therefore, despite Donald's desperate attempts to stay relevant at the moment, it looks like it's a done deal for Mr. Trump.
22 | Rock Fortune | Trump is NOT dropping in the polls. Hillary doesn't have an 11 point lead. These polls are fake, news reports you hear on the radio are all false. Trump is not losing support, actually his support has been increasing everyday that passes by as it gets closer to the ELECTION.I know this isn't anything new. My reason for saying this is because there are people out there who are still on the fence and might get confused by what they hear. We can't let that happen! Strong and United...Pay attention to details...all details!! Make sure you wear RED on ELECTION DAY and pay attention at your voting locations...take pictures and take note of anything suspicious. We've been taken advantage of for far too long! It's America's time now. America FIRST! Also they are having women file false Rape Allegations against Trump this week. ALL are false accusations...DO NOT FALL IN THEIR TRAP!
23 | Sherwood Montoya | Really, CBS? You will always get what you want with the people you interview. Of course men talk that way. Just not in front of other women. Plus, you should be reporting on something far more important. Russia threatening us, DAPL vs WATER (Indigenous People), Native water right vs EPA, or Hillary evading treason charges. If not, we see the biasness the CBS and other media outlets have.
24 | Mark Moore | Locker room talk or 3rd person talk lives on every day you don't gotta be famous or a sports player to know locker room talk...if you slept with more then one person in your life then you love the dirty nasty talk!!!!
25 | Rosemary Niswonger-Muse | If you are Gay, why are you voting for H¬≠illary when she wants to bring in millio¬≠ns of refugees that believe gays should ¬≠be executed?If you are Black, why are you voting for¬≠ Hillary when she defends Planned Parent¬≠hood and admires Margaret Sanger, who wa¬≠nted to abort as many black babies as po¬≠ssible and exterminate the black race be¬≠cause they are like "weeds." Most of tho¬≠se clinics are in Black neighborhoods.If you are a Woman, how can you vote for¬≠ Hillary when she has buried all of Bill¬≠'s rape victims under the rug. As an att¬≠orney, Hillary also defended the rapist ¬≠of a 12-year old girl and laughed about ¬≠it later. She plays the woman-card and a¬≠cts entitled; implying that she deserve¬≠s your vote merely because of her sex. H¬≠ow is that gender neutral?If you have are a Miner, Steelworker or ¬≠have a Factory job, why are you voting f¬≠or Hillary when she supported NAFTA and ¬≠TPP, and workers are being laid off beca¬≠use jobs are going overseas? She also we¬≠lcomes open borders and illegals to get ¬≠benefits with your tax money and compet¬≠e for our jobs. Hillary boasts that unde¬≠r her administration miners and steelwor¬≠kers will lose their jobs.If you are a Law abiding citizen, how ca¬≠n you vote for Hillary when she is clear¬≠ly above the law? Hillary deleted thousa¬≠nds of secret e-mails *after* they had b¬≠een subpoenaed by the courts (illegal). ¬≠Hillary kept thousands of classified and¬≠ top secret e-mails on her private serv¬≠er; servers that had less security that ¬≠g-mail and Hotmail. You can be sure Russ¬≠ia, Iran, and China have those now. The ¬≠DNC clearly broke the rules by heavy-han¬≠dedly favoring Hillary over Sanders whil¬≠e they were still competing for the nom¬≠ination.If you are a Veteran, in the military, o¬≠r closely related to a military member, ¬≠why are you voting for Hillary when she ¬≠left those men to die in Benghazi and ha¬≠d the nerve to lie about it over and ove¬≠r again? They called for help, but the h¬≠elp was told to stand down. Furthermore¬≠, Hillary wants to eliminate the NRA, ta¬≠ke away your guns, and abolish the secon¬≠d amendment?Who is left?¬≠ Please share¬≠!!

In the wake of Hurricane Matthew rescuers expect to remove roughly 1,000 people in this North Carolina town ‚Äì many of them elderly or physically unable to leave on their own.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Borly Green | Does it matter if it's truly like Katrina. I must imagine for those there yes. They lost everything. For us in our dry home we can see clear. Don't belittle what they are going through.
2 | Justin McCowan | The plant where I work at Kinston still ran to start with one assembly line with an one hour delay, but many people couldn't make it in. The plant went ahead and sent us home because they were shutting down all the main highways into the south part of town, as the Neuse river was rising and flooding the roads. What they are projecting, this will be similar to Floyd in 1999, and the Neuse here is scheduled to crest about Friday.
3 | Ed Batista | This reveals much, what happens in this and many other cities, there are a huge urban growth, without attention to the laws of nature !!
4 | Brad Anderson | I hardly think so. Katrina killed 1800 people. Mathew does not compare to Katrina at least in the U.S. Is it bad, yes...but no where near the destruction and conditions of Katrina.
5 | Jay Snow | Don't read this, you won't like it...Hillary and Bill Clinton scared into shutting me down, now I'm back after being banned for 7 days and 2 hours for posting the truth about Hillary Clinton so I couldn't interfere with the debate where Trump had three against him. Anybody go's with that have to be very sick people, I've seen that very thing happen in school yards, you know what I'm talking about, bullies ganging up on one person. In other words, the news media and Hillary Clinton are bullies, plus criminals!Hillary say's that everything she's done was in the past... So why are they going after trump's comments as they were in the past? I swear everyone complaining are hypocrites.The debate, three on one, Hillary and her two minions against Trump. All American people should stand up and demand the next debate against Trump and Hillary, Trump should have two on his side and he should not debate Hillary on less he is allowed to have Michael Savage and Joe Pags or Chris Plante on with him to make it fair and balanced.And this go for John McCain and these Republicans that will not vote for Trump, they are really "Democratic infiltrators" of the Republican Party. These lying scum bags will do anything to try and destroy the Republican Party as it is there mission to do so. These infiltrators are NOT really Republicans as they are going against Trump and who are voting for Hillary Clinton of the Democratic Party. These Democratic-Republicans need to be weeded out and destroyed personally one by one. No true Republican would ever go against one of their own and then vote for the other Party on less they were really Democrats who want to bring America to it's knees. They are back stabbers to the Party they claim to be of and to the American people... How shameful and disgusting they are, truly un-American. This is how I see it....Matthew 10:22"You will be hated by all because of My name, but it is the one who has endured to the end who will be saved".Hillary Rodham Clinton, as you can see, she is the most hated person in the world. Look at how many people she has caused to killed around the world, look at how many Policemen and white people that have been killed in America because of Hillary and Obama and their followers, they are the Anti-Christ. This included you too Nancy Pelosi, you are a follower!
6 | Martha O'Brien | Very sad...so many lives & homes lost...God bless the workers in there helping rescue people & clean up
7 | Leslie E. Heath | I'm so sick of every single storm being compared to Katrina. The flooding we have is nothing like that awful devastation that killed so many.
8 | Johnny Seely | A little exaggerated don't you think. But then deceiving is what these clowns do for a living now
9 | Linda Newcomb | The good news is now they don't have to worry about where to pee
10 | Lori Wrobel | This is more like Floyd-rain forecasted south but went north.
11 | Sherri J Shipley James | Hopefully our Gov steps up with help for all involved, unlike Katrina where many of the areas look the same today.
12 | Dionne Noriega | So about the Matthew catastrophe in Haiti. Hundreds dead. Pretty much the entire country has suffered damages. Without power food water and shelter. Red Cross has failed them (yet again)
13 | Denise Spencer | but there a republican state..... they don't believe in climate change.......
14 | Mike Wagner | Here Are the North Carolina Republicans Who Voted 'No' on Hurricane Sandy Relief Funds‚Ä¢Virginia Foxx (R-NC)‚Ä¢George Holding (R-NC)‚Ä¢Richard Hudson (R-NC)‚Ä¢Mark Meadows (R-NC)
15 | John Prekop | Do You Want A President That Has SAID Things That Are Very Wrong And Disgusting Over The Last Twenty Years And Has Apologized For Them?Or Would You Rather Have A President Who DONE The Following; Defended A Rapist Of A Twelve Year Old Girl Laughs About Getting Him Off With Two Months Served, Sold Russia Are Uranium For Millions Of Dollars To The Clinton Foundation, Four Dead In Benghazi, Bad Iran Nuke Deal Giving Them 1.7 Trillion Dollars In Cash, Getting Out Of Iraq Leaving A Vacuum Were ISIS Was Formed, Wants Open Boarders, Sanctuary Cities, 550% More Refuges Over The 110,000 That Obama Wants To Bring In, Has Destroyed Many Women‚Äôs Lives Trying To Cover Up Her Husband‚Äôs Rapes And Affairs In The Oval Office That Finally Got Him Impeached.So I Guess The $64,000. Question America Is Would You Rather Have A President?Who Has SAID Things That Are Very Wrong And Disgusting Over The Past Twenty Years And Apologies For Them.Or Who Has DONE Many Things That Are Very Wrong And Disgusting Over The Past Twenty Six Years And Hasn't Apologies For NONE Of Them.I Don‚Äôt Know About You I‚Äôm Going To Vote For The Person Who Will Secure Our Boarders, Deport Violent Criminal Aliens, Extreme Venting Of Refuges, End Sanctuary Cities, Reduce Regulations On Our Businesses, Lower Tax‚Äôs Across The Board Especially Business Tax‚Äôs That Will Create Millions Of New Jobs And Businesses, Support Or Law Enforcement To Make Our Cities And Streets Safer, Do Away With Common Core To Make Our Schools Better For Our Children, Support Or Veterns And Rebuild Our Depleted Military. Trump/Pence Nov.8th Lets MAGA. Please Get Out The Vote The Future Of Our Country & Our Freedoms Are At Stake!

23 | Kristell Le Garrec | D√©noncer comme nos organismes sont touch√©s et auxquels on porte atteinte sans cesse, dont on se demande quand finira l'outrage, nos dos sans cesse pi√©g√©s, sur des manipulations que se disputent pour le pi√©ger, les diff√©rentes nations, jouant la paix du monde.D√©noncer comme les d√©nonciations de l'organisme global sont transform√©es en ordre d'ex√©cution globale par les gouvernements qui n'attendent m√™me pas la nuit pour diss√©quer et abattre.D√©noncer le nombre d'idiots qui s'acharnent sur l'organisme global parce qu'ils ont peur d'√™tre abattus comme ils ont servis des guerres pour pouvoir faire des petits T shirts pour leur cul, √ßa va, y en a assez ? D√©noncer les femmes musulmanes et les autres peuples, pauvres qui ne peuvent plus s'habiller que difficilement quand l'Europe d√©gueule de magasins √† fringues, d'une vie futile et terrible √† l'humanit√©. D√©noncer' les memecs qui disent vouloir faire de nouveaux organismes globaux et saccager l'ancien parce qu'ils ont peur des massacres qu'ils ont servi et de resservir le risque global ainsi, en joujouant avec leurs enfants √† qui est plus responsable que Marianne en for√ßant Marianne √† ne pas se laver, √† ne pas se changer, en la for√ßant √† √™tre mutil√©e. d√©noncer l'idiotie flagrante du monde, qui le m√®ne √† sa perte.D√©noncer comme ces idiots exigeant des petits t shirts pour les enfants, font rev√™tir leurs enfants de la peau des enfants d'ailleurs ainsi, qu'ils font acheminer actuellement en dizaines de millions de migrants, disant se conforter dans des populations d'enfants avec un mode de fonctionnement dynamique qui ne tient pas, et qui a d√©j√† √©t√© utilis√© depuis la pr√©histoire et n'a donn√© que des guerres. On appelle √† r√©soudre par des professionnels comp√©tents la guerre. D√©noncer le risque global qu'ils d√©clenchent ainsi sans cesse et le bricolage √©hont√© des gouvernants qui encore d√©clenchent la catastrophe nationale, servie par une sportive que vient faire son petit besoin pour la patrie. d√©noncer que devant les √©talages de l'Europe, ce sont les droits des autres peuples qui sont √† la vente. Et que les dizaines de millions de migrants enfants viennent vers leurs droits pour survivre, avec des risques de d√©solidarisation des populations et riches vers qui elles vont et pauvres d'o√π ils partent, avec des risques pour eux-m√™mes terribles. D√©noncer cette logique de voler les droits et de ramener une partie de la population, mais on a vol√© combien pour qu'il y ait autant de migrants ? Plut√¥t que de consolider les populations de mani√®re raisonnable. Et de revoir les dettes de l'Europe qui doit s'assagir et cesser d'agir de mani√®re odieuse et terrible aux peuples.
24 | Kristell Le Garrec | Condamner l'attitude des dits 'pr√©sidents' qui diss√®quent Marianne, donc l'organisme global, et mettent en p√©ril la s√©curit√© mondiale, l'arm√©e qui les assiste, pour ramener des morceaux diss√©qu√©s donc de l'ensemble des corps des citoyens du monde pour faire un blindage autour de lui, et s'√©tonner d'√™tre livr√© √† mettre la s√©curit√© de l'Elys√©e en p√©ril aussi.Rappeler la conduite de Manuel Valls qui nous a vendu comme un veau √† d√©pecer, et c'est ainsi qu'on est atteint √† ce point dans nos droits et nos vies. On rappelle en lien que vendre quelqu'un c'est ill√©gal, c'est le d√©faire de ses droits, c'est le traiter en animal ou pis, le livrer au meurtre, livrer le massacre des peuples.Consid√©rer l'ensemble des personnes qui sont amen√©es √† donner leur avis sur la politique mondiale en votes ill√©gaux forc√©s, dangereux, pay√©s sur massacres √† venir, des personnes trop et mal inform√©es √† la fois qui sont √† livrer l'homme de mani√®re terrible, relivrant la menace globale sans cesse.Rappeler que ce n'est pas parce qu'un 'pr√©sident' essaie d'√©viter la prison qu'il doit faire peser la menace globale et la menace sur les droits.Rappeler que le planplan du gouvernement pour parler de politique mondiale consiste √† d√©pecer l'ensemble des populations sur risque global, de mani√®re structurelle, qu'ils y vont comme des cons, et qu'on est tr√®s en danger, ils mentent beaucoup, sans cesse. On exige que les professionnels puissent agir en justice contre les plans pr√©sidentiels qui nous mettent tous en p√©ril.Rappeler l'organisation mondiale de la population mondiale tenue sur deux corps de Ga√Øas qui sont des vraies personnes qui portent sur leur personne, leur vie, les droits humains et que vouloir les d√©faire, ces deux Mariannes Lili, de leur pouvoir, de leurs droits, de leur corps, de leur vie, c'est d√©faire l'homme tout en entier, et c'est ce qu'il se passe actuellement.D√©noncer les ventes d'armes qui sont contract√©es derni√®rement comme signe de malgestion mondiale. On exige que des professionnels comp√©tents soient √† l'oeuvre pour r√©soudre le probl√®me mondial et √©tablir une paix mondiale. D√©noncer la niaiserie qui consiste √† faire acheter des armes plut√¥t que de faire la guerre. Redouter le futur.
25 | Kristell Le Garrec | Depuis la pr√©histoire, l'homme doit pouvoir jouir de droits complets, et cela a √©t√© d√©fait par des emprunts de guerre pour tenir dans l'adversit√©, ces droits contraints, ce code de guerre qui maintient actuellement, malgr√© qu'il soit forc√© souvent en falsifications, en votes fauss√©s augment√©s de mani√®re ill√©gale, les peuples dans des droits qu'on nomme syst√®me occidentalis, africanus, asiaticus, et les autres, contraints sur les droits de base, les droits int√©graux de l'humanit√© qui sont dus de par le simple fait d'√™tre n√©, d'√™tre vivant, d'√™tre un √™tre humain.Signaler que maintenir les autres peuples en tyrannie par pr√©l√®vement de leurs droits, dire qu'on paie alors qu'on les vole, de mani√®re manifeste, grossi√®re aussi, ind√©cente, terrible, ceci doit √™tre sanctionn√© et l'ensemble du peuple mondial doit vivre uniform√©ment libre, heureux et prot√©g√©.Les √©conomies de corps ayant entra√Æn√© des risques sur les populations, dont beaucoup sur les enfants, comme on peut voir par le chiffre alarmant des dizaines de millions d'enfants r√©fugi√©s en migration difficile, en d√©tresse, ces dizaines de millions de vies dont on doit assumer que les mettre en danger ainsi doit √™tre jug√© et sanctionn√© afin que cessent ces menaces sur les vies. Les programmes chers pour g√©rer les enfants et les bas √¢ges et les autres √¢ges doivent √™tre examin√©s afin que tous soient heureux dans une gestion optimale, √©conomique des corps, mais non tyrannique. Les budgets √©normes et les vies qui de contrainte mondiale sont le prix √† verser pour le maintien de ces syst√®me particuliers o√π ils essaient de pr√©server les enfants, ces risques terribles qui nous inqui√®tent, qui p√®sent sur les populations mondiales, on les pr√©juge et on veut les faire juger afin qu'une solution adapt√©e √† l'ensemble des populations humaines soit mise en oeuvre, on exige bien mieux et plus pragmatique que ce qui est actuellement r√©alis√©.Un changement de constitution ne saurait pas bien juguler le probl√®me, en r√©alit√©, on pr√©juge que les massacres et autres fl√©aux d'humanit√© persisteraient et en seraient le co√ªt; la solution Marianne qui a tout fait de l'homme, tout construit, dans la lutte clandestine, tout gagn√© des progr√®s de l'homme, est la solution la mieux adapt√©e au monde, √† juguler les risques et √©tablir un r√®gne heureux de l'humain, elle est la plus souple et solide √† mettre en place, elle est la base de tout de l'humain, et elle sait depuis longtemps r√©aliser l'homme, et on exige que la civilisation parfaite avec l'homme tout √©galement heureux soit r√©alis√© par le syst√®me Marianne qui a construit tout des civilisations et du t√©l√©guidage moderne.

Fox News personality Geraldo Rivera says he has uncovered more "embarrassing" statements that Trump has made in past interviews.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Steve Watkins | And right on cue, here comes Geraldo like a dirty rat trying to cash in and get his piece of the pie. Ugh.
2 | Cathy Dunbar Rosselli | Trump is an ignorant dirty old man. If he didn't have billions everyone would be creeped out by him but money makes him attractive to the gullible.
3 | Shannon E. Lego | I know geraldo isn't gonna go there? He's a notorious womanizer and pig!!!!
4 | Jo-Ann Esposito Meehan | In his 1992 biography, among the revelations Fox News Channel host Geraldo Rivera disclosed was that he had slept with 1,000 women at a young age. Among his conquests was actress Bette Midler. Asked about her sexual adventure with Rivera, Midler said that the experience was ‚Äúnothing to write home about.‚ÄùIn 1992, Midler tore into Rivera after she read how she was depicted in his autobiography, calling the journalist ‚Äúgrotesque‚Äù and a ‚Äúslime ball.‚Äù Asked about the affair on CNN in 2011, Midler said simply, ‚Äúew.‚Äù
5 | Elise Yany-Fleishman | Trump can talk as dirty as he likes in PRIVATE as long as he secures our borders, turns the economy around, fixes healthcare and appoints SCOTUS that will protect the 2nd Amendment.
6 | Warren Curtis | GOOD FOR YOU GERALDO...YOU MUST HAVE SOME ON HILLARY TO ....SHARE THOSE WITH US...
7 | Beth Barrett Dachs | Borrowed: "I'm going to push this until the Nov election on every post I can. If you don't want the truth about Hillary don't read it. A Lie Named Hillary .. I oppose her because she cannot tell the truth to save her life. Any public servant who has the gall to issue a list of terms the press cannot utter, as if disposing the corpse of free will, is helplessly deluded and a petulant child. Sorry, Hillary, but no one owes you anything; especially the nation you proclaim to serve with nothing but the benevolence of blind ambition. If your candidacy cannot survive without the aid of deception, division, and the fabricated catcalls of ‚Äúsexism‚Äù to demonize your critics, then please tell us why America needs you? Better yet, please explain how you‚Äôre even worthy of the job? A leader doesn‚Äôt need pollsters, a panel of advisers, two news conferences and a room full of media drones just to announce whether or not she used an unauthorized server to conduct official government business and therefore deleted emails in an attempt to avoid prosecution. A leader would never break the law in the first place. And a leader doesn't shout, "At this point, what difference does it make" when four lives are lost in the wake of her unmitigated failure. Any self-respecting adult with an ounce of integrity would simply admit the truth. Excuse me, any self-aware child who knows the difference between right and wrong, life and death. She was thrown off the Congressional Watergate panel for lying and she hasn't stopped lying since !!!!!. And some people want her as our President - she can't & won't even tell the Truth as Secretary of State - and remember all she has done there to pad her financial pockets and political career - That should never have begun.If I‚Äôm hiring someone to run my business, placing my future in foreign hands, I don't care whether you're a Democrat or Republican, a man or woman, white or black. I want the most qualified candidate whose character speaks for itself and whose ideals can stand on the merits of their own wisdom. That‚Äôs common sense. Are you going to have the audacity to tell me what I can and can‚Äôt ask; what verbiage is acceptable? If your resume and vision are truly best for the entire nation, not just one party, gender or race, either should be able to withstand the most blistering questions and exhaustive scrutiny. In fact, you should welcome any and all discourse to discredit your detractors and display your competence. A leader unites, empowers and inspires by example, not by excuses or endless blame. Tell me the national debt is a record 19 Trillion and that Barack Obama has raised it more than the first 43 presidents combined. Admit that an estimated 94 million Americans are out of the workforce, nearly 50 million are on public assistance, and that the economic recovery is a sham. Admonish Iran as a destabilizing force of Islamic radicalism that must never be mentioned in the same sentence as ‚Äúnuclear power". Recognize the reality every civilized nation has immigration laws and that American sovereignty, the safety and security of her people, supersedes any political ploy to stuff the ballot box beneath the hollow cries of racism.Yes, just like generations of legal immigrants before your candidacy, respect is given when trust is earned. If you are incapable of acknowledging simple, documented facts - solely because it‚Äôs easier to hide behind a propaganda platform that cajoles and incites an expendable public - you're not interested in solving anything, let alone serving the American people or any notion of truth. You and the likes of you are the cancer killing the country I love. You‚Äôre the lie my forefathers warned us about. Hillary Clinton has a long and inglorious history of alleged document tampering and questionable legal maneuverings. AMERICAN VOTERS WE NEED TO KEEP HER OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE.. SHE BELONGS IN JAIL - PLEASE - PLEASE SHARE THIS WITH EVERYONE !!!"
8 | Stuart Cardwell | I have stopped watching CBS - your biased and one-sided comments do not reflect the news unless it is derogatory against anyone who does not favor the democrats - CBS at one time presented the facts.  Their reports were not distorted or twisted to suit the government that owns them and they were fair and balanced - that has become a thing of the past - If Trump does not win, Charlie Rose will go insane withouth being able to bash him (nine out of ten mornings the first words out of his mouth are 'Donald Trump....etc.etc.etc.)  and that goes for the rest of you as well - You have allowed the obama's and the clintons, and anyone else who is intent on destroying our country by whatever means they can avail, to control your every move - and yes, every other main stream media station is getting this same response - you all should be tried for treason.....
9 | Rob Teinert | still cant imagine any one so mentally challenged that they think words from 11 years ago is more harmful than 30 years of out right TREASON!, corruption! and lies!, hilLIARy belongs in GITMO!, period!, or considering treason during a war is a capitol offense, the TREASONOUS bitch needs to be strapped to a table and lethal injected!
10 | Barbara Zamojski | I have an idea - why don't we go back through Geraldo's life, I'm sure we can uncover some very unsavory things in his past.
11 | Edgardo Obregon | Hey, if you're alive and kicking, vote Blue all the way to continue to make America great! I had enough of the orange moron. Bill Clinton is not running for President. The accusations are public knowledge and there was never a conviction. Trump has to take responsibility for his own actions and absorb the consequences. Trump's pattern of behavior over this campaign and pretty much his entire adult life is not only irresponsible and reprehensible but it is 100% non-presidential. He needs to go back to ripping off the IRS, the public and his business partners. Or better yet, go directly to jail and forfeit his remaining $200. And while this happens, FOX News needs to file for bankrumptcy, as this garbage of network has poisoned way to many folks and the country has been permanently damaged. #RepublicansforHillary 2016!!!
12 | Lisa Ashley Williams | Just shut up already! Everyone is trying so hard to find something negative about him. They are trying to deflect from all of Hillary's dirty deeds! I'm still voting for #trump!  #trumptrain #isupporttrump #trumpforpresident
13 | Ron Fisher | And what exactly does this have to do with anything?... hey CBS... show some of the shit Hillary has done to this country... Trump wasnt in politics and what he did or said had no bearing on the American people ... Hillary on the other hand... ya.. 30 years of corruption
14 | Val Trainor | Geraldo went on to say "I will host a hour long special where the vault containing these embarrassing tapes will be revealed in a dramatic culmination in the last five minutes of the program"
15 | Andy Ramos | I'm not racist first of all I'm a Puerto Rican bought into this life by my mother who was a housewife and a dad who was a hard worker! My dad bailed out on us when I was a child which I didn't care because he used to abuse my mother physically! Anyways I'm a liberal n i was forced to take care of my family at a very young age. Of course I did anything I had to do to feed my younger brother so I committed crimes! Went to jail so forth! My problem is this why do they treat illegals better than than felons I feel they have more rights than me and I'm American so therefore I just wish people give Americans a second chance instead of catering to illegals I'm so tied of looking for jobs that pay under the table because most of those jobs are taken by a illegal so go Trump! That's my opinion!
16 | RyanRebecca English | If Trump knew years ago he was going to run for president someday, perhaps his actions would have been different in his PAST.  Clinton, however, has known her whole life she wanted to be president.  Just curious, why hasn't her actions been reflective of that goal?
17 | Cecilia Clemmons | Not helping your credibility much with Geraldo as your source. And more video of things Trump SAID?  If only there was video of the things we all say. None of us are perfect. And some of us are way farther from perfect.
18 | Britta Mcpherson-Snow | Can we plz get you to report on fixing this country and not Donald saying a bad word. We are all adults here. The dirty truth is killary is a murderer and crook. This is the proven facts. Why do you not find fault in her ACTIONS?!?!?!
19 | Rhonda Taylor | That's some funny crap right there!!! I am being serious here! I can't quit laughing!! who on God's green Earth gives a crap about what Geraldo Rivera says?!?!?! he is a proven liar on more than one occasion üòÇ he needs to go away üòÇ
20 | Yvette Helton | It will never cease to amaze me the dirt they can dig up when they want to but can't and won't prosecute Hillary for all the illegal, deplorable acts she has committed. I can't wait to see what the actual votes are reported as instead of "among likely voters" as you say in your so called polls.  So many of us arent included in those polls.
21 | Diana S. Giannoutsos | Clinton is the key to opening America to Sharia Law, open borders and the demise of our country.
22 | James Minnema | Hey CBS news. Why you are all trying to kiss Hillary's backside you are just pushing us more towards Donald. I have had enough about his locker room talk and you trying to say it doesn't happen. You are liars. and i am getting sick of it.
23 | Linda Shelley | Geraldo, you are no saint we are working on digging up all your dirt  and there looks like plenty to share. I know your not running for president, but I bet there is things you don't want people to know. Stop acting like a saint after what I read your no saint saved a lot to share.
24 | James Meh Marchand | Who gives a shit. We're all guilty of saying fucked up shit at one time or another.  All of you mother fucken haters out there, have all said sum bullshit in life before. If u say I didn't, your a fucken liar. As for u Geraldo, grow the fuck up. Your just looking to make a buck. Go lay by your dish like the little bitch you are.
25 | Bredemeier Jim | he musta lost his lunch money at recess and had his lucky underwear ran up the flag pole a lot in grade school to be this insecure.  he's been complaining about all the negative campaigning that has focused on things from the past but only when it was against Hillary's past.

1 | Justin McCowan | I'll never forget when Floyd hit here in Kinston back in 1999. Some of the neighborhoods in the south east portion, such as Lincoln City are only the streets where they bulldozed the homes, because the Neuse River got so high. This morning, they were shutting down the major highways into the south side of the city, but at the time I left work after they shut the plant down, Highway 70 was still open.

In Ohio, where layoffs in the steel industry have hit hard over the last two decades, Clinton seized on the opening.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Caryn Polson | What a LOAD OF CRAP!! LOL. It was all over the news not two weeks ago that she's pulled out of Ohio and had stopped campaigning there. No ground game whatsoever. And ALL the polls showed trump taking that state. Now all of a sudden she's taking Ohio?? Me thinks you're full of sh*t.
2 | Gavin Hanley | Trump is leading in Ohio the state that decides the Election,Trump wants to save the coal and steel industry,unlike criminal Hilary.
3 | Diana S. Giannoutsos | They can find a audio recording of two men in 2005, but can't find Hillary's 33,000 deleted e-mails?? This was a private conversation 11 years ago that didn't result in the loss of life , people died waiting for Hillary to do her job ...We're not voting for a saint, we're voting for someone tough enough to lead the free world....
4 | Lori Bond | This is a HUGE load of crap! I live in Ohio. I literally have seen 3 yard signs for Hillary ..3 .. Trump has them EVERYWHERE ... I've yet to see so much as 1 bumper sticker for Hillary.. loads for Trump though ..nearly all the people I know are voting Trump or 3rd party.. the youth of America can't stand this lady.. So yeah..this is crap. Nice try though ..
5 | Ed Cline | The last 2 decades? Weren't the Democrats in the White House 12 of those 20 years? Yet they want to put Hillary in there? One definition of insanity is to repeat something over and over and expect a different outcome.
6 | Prince Phillips | It's the Kasich factor. You have the sitting Republican Governor of the State that despises Trump and the most popular citizen in Ohio LeBron James endorsing Hillary those are your two factors this is indeed why the polls have changed. Think about it!!!!
7 | Amanda Aymond | Trump is winning Ohio easy. In their primary 2,043,042 people voted republican. Only 1,202,163 people voted democrat. Who you voted for in the primaries is who you're voting for in November. Trump has ohio
8 | Craig Moffett | It's not leaving Trump. This us just liberal MSM spin. CBS has reached new lows.
9 | Sandy Phillips | Don't give a rat's butt what Hillary says she'll do for ohio, that dingbat hasn't done squat & neither has the current POS (POTUS) for us yet: and NEVER WILL as long as they are intending on unleading this country in their continued corruptness!! Bye Hillary, I don't support you & the fact that you don't have good intentions for Ohio or the rest of the nation has shown me notta!!!
10 | Marianne Ashton | She doesn't have Ohio you manipulative dolts!. Drive thru all of Ohio and I challenge you to count the myriad of Trump signs....HC can barely be found unless it says "hillary for jail" Attend a rally in Ohio of both candidates...HC can't fill a gym, Trump is filling stadiums.
11 | Michael J Barry | Answer just this ..What has she accomplished in 30 years???? Ready go.....that's what I thought!! Ill give a man who sits as a executive on 515 successful and employees 22,000 a shot for 4 years rather than having the same crap we have had for 8 years!!!! You people can vote for the lying,psychotic, murdering witch and her sex offender husband!!! #Trump2016
12 | Ardy Esh | ...it's really difficult for die-hard tRump supporters to face up to the bitter truth that their candidate's chances is now slowly slipping away from his already tenuous grasp this close to the election...
13 | Steve Zakszewski | Team Sniffles is in full panic mode now.  The fact that he said he'd bring jobs home but didn't bring his home wasn't enough to dissuade supporters but now that everyone knows thousands of steelworkers lost their jobs because he bought hundreds of millions of dollars of Chinese steel, people are realizing he's a greedy liar and a cheat who only wants their vote.
14 | Jason Burns | Why would they be leaving Trump for Hillary in Ohio? Hillary is part of the gang that has sent their jobs overseas and openly advocates for an open exchange with China which makes Ohio steel worthless. Trump has pointed this out and promises to fix it. This looks more like evidence that she is scared and has her media lapdogs running ridiculous stories like this one.
15 | Dar Win | People have to realize that CBS News is right there in there with Hillary. Their bias is obvious. I'm not sure why a news agency would want to support someone so corrupt. You hear little, if nothing about Whitewater to Benghazi, but they will spend valuable news time interviewing athletes from 2016 about "locker talk" from years ago. They will talk about tax returns from 1995 but will not dare point point out who was president in 1995 that was leading the economy and these losses.
16 | Erin Harkleroad | I'm in Ohio and I am for Trump as well as majority of the cities that surround me! All I see is Trump signs and "huge" ones at that! I have yet to see one Hillary sign!!!!! So this is ridiculous, they are saying this so the election doesn't look to rigged! They will have to do a "recount" somewhere just like with Bush and Gore! Mark my words!!!!
17 | Dee Turner | You people are nuts if you vote for someone who is going to fill our country with refugees and illegals of all kinds ! IF she wins don't cry later when they take everything that belongs to you !
18 | Sandra Kay Durrant | All the news media are doing is trying to use psychological tricks, if they show Hillary ahead they feel that we will vote for her because it looks as though Trump has no way of winning, well it's not working for this Trump supporter neither are your lies and constant biased opinions.
19 | Katina Williams | well that's great Ohio.. and when your jobs are shipped overseas guess you all will be crying ehhhhhh....Clinton has ONE TALK she give to us.. and another plan--- when she's behind closed doors.. but with all your preoccupation with SEX.. you all probably didn't notice the Wiki LEAKS on the DNC...the DNC waxes on about a Russian PLOT..yeah suuuuureit was....... but tell me DNC...was any of it LIES??!!... i didn't think so...!!!Jill Stein 2016.. because MANY OF US.. actually give a damn what happens to this country.
20 | Jane Pettitt | Don't believe this most of the people in Ohio an Pennsylvania have been crippled in the last eight years and I don't think anybody wants four more years of struggling.  You next question did you take schooling my husband did he is a welder and he dies a little each day there are no jobs. To people you are telling this to.
21 | Terry Case | LMAO they aren't leaving Trump for Clinton. Nice try liberal media.
22 | Tom Davis | To WHIO quit your damn lying Ohio is not dumping Trump just because you say they are the lame stream media can't tell the truth if their life depended on it . Nothing but lie's from democrat's and their paied for station's . Trump in Ohio in 2016 . You want people to think this so the poll's can be rigged .
23 | Chris B. Bacon | It's interesting, just who has been in charge for the last 8 years allowing all the alleged "Chinese Steel Dumping"! Penna. and Ohio people are not that stupid! It's time to dump Obama and Clinton!
24 | Maldo Bustamante | Trump losing horribly in Ohio.. Trump and his companies have proudly purchased large amounts of steel from overseas for his buildings.  Almost all of his trades are done overseas to evade paying taxes.
25 | Stephen Mckiernan | It enabled her husband to molest, rape interns and other women. If she can't keep track of her husband how can she run a country? As first lady she outsourced her duties to Monica Lewinsky.......

Teachers were prepared to walk off the job for second time in four years.

1 | Tobbie Ricks | $66000 for working 75% of the year is excellent. That equates to a true annual salary of $88000 a year. You would expect better performance.
2 | Cheryl Howard | The average salary of Chicago teacher is $66,000 and with a graduation rate of 66%, nothing to be proud of
3 | Holly Ann | Meanwhile our politicians have lifetime paychecks they barely work for.
4 | Mark Sheets | Let them all walk off! Apparently the all suck at what they do!  Look at the literacy rate in Chicago and the people being killed! Warning: white people don't teach in Chicago! You will be killed, threatened and be a victim of racism! If all goes good and you are lucky you will just be called a racist because you are white and have to make a public apology after losing your job!
5 | Earl Vanover | If that is a teacher, she needs to cut back on the donuts.

--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Emily Roberts | It is terrifying that there are still people who support a racist, sexist, incompetent, immoral, idiot and believe this man is fit to be our next President. He is a loose canon unable to control his immature outburts. He geared his campaign toward the less educated since thats the only group of people that would consider supporting his irrational, idiotic ideas.If you are uneducated, racist, sexist, low income and would like to stay that way, he's your guy. If you want to destroy all relationships with our allies and alienate ourselves, he's your man. He's a reflection of everything that is wrong with America yet his supporters don't have the intellectual capacity to see that!
2 | John Spoa | . I guess someone should report on the bad things that the clintons do. CBS sure never will , you can bet your life on that.
3 | Missy Smith | Today, I'm sharing about hypocrisy. You know when they say," If you want to know what a narcissist is up to, just see what they accuse you of?"  The GOP prey on (I won't even say dumb) "busy" America's political amnesia. I don't forget, and I cannot stand the hypocrisy of the GOP. 1) "Bill Clinton is a serial cheater and liar," cries Newt Gingrich surrounded by Republicans on the Capitol building steps as he's been carrying on an affair on his own wife while she's going through chemo the ENTIRE time. 2) "Hillary Clinton's State Department and the CIA let 4 innocent men die in Benghazi" says the GOP, who had 13 Benghazi situations at US Embassies around the world, 9/11, and the war based on non-existent weapons of mass destruction resulting in thousands of innocent lost lives on their watch 3) "Hillary defended a rapist 40 years ago when she was working in criminal defense!" (duh..really? A criminal?) says the people who don't want their candidate judged by his behavior 11 years ago. 4) "Hillary used a private server and lost (gasp!) 33,000 emails! How suspicious!!" says the party who lost over 11 million in communications between their President and the RNC in his private server/email through them.  5)"Hillary HAD to have something to do with the DNC favoring her over Bernie Sanders in the election....how crooked!" says the party who's last winning candidate lost the popular vote and only won by ONE state's suspicious election electoral votes with "hanging chads" that his brother ironically became governor of... 6) Hillary voted for the Iraq War!!" says the party that voted 99% along with the 80% of Democrats who voted yes as well. I could keep going forever here. In my divorce, I learned about something called the "law of clean hands." You don't haul your ex into court for something when you're pulling trash, too. It kind of voids your complaint and gets the wrath of the judge.  It has the same effect for me. Trump can shut up because he alone, and his party supporting him, have done far worse and labeled it "acceptable and normal." Excuse me while I wipe the vomit off my desk....
4 | Kanokwan Nok | He is the most hypocrite, most disgraceful and most ignorant person in the US history who runs for the highest office! If he ever became the President, America would be a real  joke to the world!
5 | Crystal Syer | This is so mature. Wake up America!All he has is slogans and catch phrases. No real plans, just says what you want to hear.
6 | Ashley Thorn | CBS you make me SICK!!! You used to be my #1 news show,but now I don't think I'll every watch your trump trashing show again!!!!!! Nobody cares about what trump said in a private conversation, we want to hear about all the NEW emails being released. Your show sure does cover up for the Clinton's. Are you all scared for your life too,has she threatened you guys too,like she does anybody that get in her way?
7 | David Gordon | Great  BUT If you‚Äôre over 35, take a walk with me down memory lane‚Äîyou won‚Äôt believe what you have forgotten.  If you‚Äôre under 35, read on‚ÄîI promise you that you will be amazed at what you missed!   (By the way, sadly, this isn‚Äôt a joke.   I wish it was.)REMEMBER WHEN BILL CLINTON WAS PRESIDENT?(January 20, 1993 to January 20, 2001‚Äîtwo terms)When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over an attempt to reform health care. Her proposed plan was so bad that many Democrats came up with competing plans of their own in protest, and in spite of threats and intimidation, on September 26, 1994, the ‚ÄúHillarycare‚Äù bill was declared dead.This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million for studies, promotion, and other efforts.Then, President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general.  Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood‚Äîboth were forced to withdraw their names from consideration.  Next, she chose Janet Reno, which husband Bill described as "my worst mistake."  (Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.)Husband Bill also allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission‚ÄîLani Guanier was her selection. After considerable backlash from prominent Democratic senators concerning Ms. Guanier's radical views, Bill Clinton withdrew her name from nomination, stating that she did not represents the civil rights views that he had championed during his campaign.However, apparently a slow learner, husband Bill continued to allow Hillary to make more recommendations. She chose former law partners, Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department. Her selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kennedy was forced to resign.  (Is anyone wondering yet what her Supreme Court Justice appointments would be like?)Many younger voters will have no knowledge of "Travelgate," the first major ethics controversy during Bill‚Äôs presidency.Hillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend, Harry Thompson‚Äîbut the White House Travel Office refused to comply. She trumped up allegations of financial mismanagement and reported seven long-time White House employees to the FBI.  This ruined their reputations, got them fired, and caused a thirty-six month investigation. Eventually, most of the employees were reinstated and Clinton associates were forced out of the travel office. Only one White House employee, Billy Dale, was charged with a crime‚Äîthe enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds;  a jury acquitted him in less than two hours.Still not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House Security.  When Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies (Filegate) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff, suddenly Hillary and the President denied even knowing Livingstone, and of course, denied knowledge of drug use in the White House.Following this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents.Next, when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by Bill Clinton, Hillary was put in charge of the "bimbo eruption" and scandal defense. Let‚Äôs look at some of her more notable decisions in this regard . . . She urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation, they settled with Ms. Jones.  She refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor.  After $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr's investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs.  Hillary's devious game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for 'lying under oath' to a grand jury, followed by his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives.  Hillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, "I do not recall," "I have no recollection," and "I don't know" a total of 56 times while under oath.   (Sound familiar?)  After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had "mistakenly thought was hers."So you see, the email scandal and all of her malfeasance regarding the handling of Top Secret information, not to mention the "pay to play" schemes of the Clinton Foundation, are nothing new.  Hillary‚Äôs entire political career has been nothing but a web of lies, corruption and destruction in her quest for power.Is anyone else ready to say, ‚ÄúEnough is enough!‚Äù?But unfortunately, I‚Äôm sure her loyal fans will say, "What difference does it make?"
8 | Diana S. Giannoutsos | They can find a audio recording of two men in 2005, but can't find Hillary's 33,000 deleted e-mails?? This was a private conversation 11 years ago that didn't result in the loss of life , people died waiting for Hillary to do her job ...We're not voting for a saint, we're voting for someone tough enough to lead the free world....
9 | Nicki Weller | The millions of dollars this goon would have wasted by the time he loses this election! Its understandable why Romney or Ryan didn't run again even though they would have made better candidates than Trump.Elections are expensive.
10 | Forrest E. Kennedy | The current presidential election is the most important one in decades, and it has little to do with Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump.It‚Äôs about the rule of law. And if Clinton wins, liberals will forever change the law of the land.The Supreme Court, which began its 2016 term on Monday, has had a conservative majority since Richard Nixon landed in the Oval Office in 1968. During Nixon‚Äôs presidency, he appointed four conservative justices. Since that election, there has been no other president that has had the opportunity to completely alter the American legal landscape for decades.Until now!
11 | Christina Thompson Rankin | Even as stupid as he is, he knows it's over. Like any petulant child, he's decided he's going to take the whole party down with him & the GOP have no one to blame but themselves. Maybe they will learn from this & stop supporting these immature blockheads who have never lived in the real world but I doubt it.
12 | Lisa Gee | I think the bigger issue is the media is bent on destroying Trump and covering up for the Clintons. Bottom line that's not the media's job. it's as simple as that. so we have to decide how gullible are we. If something is offensive it's offensive regardless who did it or does it. I am much more offended by someone raping me or exposing himself to me than someone speaking disrespectfully in private about me. Clinton ...Bill and Hillary, they are predators they are out to destroy and conquer. I don't want to have anything to do with them they are pure evil!Trump Pence 2016
13 | Donald Allan | Translation: "If you want to keep pointing out what a scumbag I am, I'm gonna have to keep being a scumbag in retaliation".
14 | Shawna Mcintire Gilliam | Why isn't the media interested in the issues facing our country? Ask those questions!! Stop bringing up their past, all the time. It's getting old. Yes they both have many faults, but this is who's running and we have to vote for one. I'm ashamed of the way this election is going from both sides. It seems like the media has turned into Jerry Springer show, and not a news station. This is who we have to vote for so ask real questions, that we want and need to know. We are being laughed at by the world!! Smh
15 | Alejandro Fuentes | Attacking the Clintons is the only thing this crazy orangutan knows, he said before that he didn't want to learn politics unless he's been elected,he is a disgrace to America and human waste himself,only retarded coin laundry washers will vote for him.
16 | Eddie Shepherd | If everyone and plus the media is pushing Hillary Clinton past under the rug for what she has done and said. Well shouldn't they do the same for Donald Trump for what he has said? He didn't say he grab a woman lady parts, he said when you're famous you can do just about anything and judging what I've seen that's about right?
17 | Eddie Shepherd | You think when they go to a locker room and ask a player what they say in there are going to say actually what's being said Hell No but you can sure watch when they come out and see what they do. Hell even got Elvis Presley saying things, so if anyone says that they don't talk like that are a liar!!
18 | Marlene George | Hilly said it isn't true anything about her and billy. Well folks it's a proven fact she should have been convicted for a severe crime and billy did have sex with Monica and others so who is lieing. She will take a shit on all middle class people the second she takes office
19 | Jeanette Alcorn Harris | This old immature senior citizen does not have an agenda like what are his plans for this country he is obsessed with the Clintons this is all he talks about
20 | Beth Barrett Dachs | Borrowed: "I'm going to push this until the Nov election on every post I can. If you don't want the truth about Hillary don't read it. A Lie Named Hillary .. I oppose her because she cannot tell the truth to save her life. Any public servant who has the gall to issue a list of terms the press cannot utter, as if disposing the corpse of free will, is helplessly deluded and a petulant child. Sorry, Hillary, but no one owes you anything; especially the nation you proclaim to serve with nothing but the benevolence of blind ambition. If your candidacy cannot survive without the aid of deception, division, and the fabricated catcalls of ‚Äúsexism‚Äù to demonize your critics, then please tell us why America needs you? Better yet, please explain how you‚Äôre even worthy of the job? A leader doesn‚Äôt need pollsters, a panel of advisers, two news conferences and a room full of media drones just to announce whether or not she used an unauthorized server to conduct official government business and therefore deleted emails in an attempt to avoid prosecution. A leader would never break the law in the first place. And a leader doesn't shout, "At this point, what difference does it make" when four lives are lost in the wake of her unmitigated failure. Any self-respecting adult with an ounce of integrity would simply admit the truth. Excuse me, any self-aware child who knows the difference between right and wrong, life and death. She was thrown off the Congressional Watergate panel for lying and she hasn't stopped lying since !!!!!. And some people want her as our President - she can't & won't even tell the Truth as Secretary of State - and remember all she has done there to pad her financial pockets and political career - That should never have begun.If I‚Äôm hiring someone to run my business, placing my future in foreign hands, I don't care whether you're a Democrat or Republican, a man or woman, white or black. I want the most qualified candidate whose character speaks for itself and whose ideals can stand on the merits of their own wisdom. That‚Äôs common sense. Are you going to have the audacity to tell me what I can and can‚Äôt ask; what verbiage is acceptable? If your resume and vision are truly best for the entire nation, not just one party, gender or race, either should be able to withstand the most blistering questions and exhaustive scrutiny. In fact, you should welcome any and all discourse to discredit your detractors and display your competence. A leader unites, empowers and inspires by example, not by excuses or endless blame. Tell me the national debt is a record 19 Trillion and that Barack Obama has raised it more than the first 43 presidents combined. Admit that an estimated 94 million Americans are out of the workforce, nearly 50 million are on public assistance, and that the economic recovery is a sham. Admonish Iran as a destabilizing force of Islamic radicalism that must never be mentioned in the same sentence as ‚Äúnuclear power". Recognize the reality every civilized nation has immigration laws and that American sovereignty, the safety and security of her people, supersedes any political ploy to stuff the ballot box beneath the hollow cries of racism.Yes, just like generations of legal immigrants before your candidacy, respect is given when trust is earned. If you are incapable of acknowledging simple, documented facts - solely because it‚Äôs easier to hide behind a propaganda platform that cajoles and incites an expendable public - you're not interested in solving anything, let alone serving the American people or any notion of truth. You and the likes of you are the cancer killing the country I love. You‚Äôre the lie my forefathers warned us about. Hillary Clinton has a long and inglorious history of alleged document tampering and questionable legal maneuverings. AMERICAN VOTERS WE NEED TO KEEP HER OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE.. SHE BELONGS IN JAIL - PLEASE - PLEASE SHARE THIS WITH EVERYONE !!!"
21 | De Sturm | Months ago when others started discussing Trump's mental fitness overall, not just to be commander in chief, I discounted it as party politics, sour grapes. But the more I watch this man, hear the things he says, I am starting to believe it. He has no moral compass. Is truly a bully. But what scares me the most is he can do whatever he wants and if you don't like it, he's coming after you. And for the same things he's done!
22 | Ian Wright | He's going to ride that republican bitch chump train right into the fires of political oblivion.... ryan knows it....all senior republicans can see it, its going to take decades to become relivant again though i suspect the GOP will never be the same again.....only winner is the rise of the multiparty system but that too will be a long way off....the uneducated masses who follow blindly have alot to be ashamed of..
23 | Sara Watson | Yep he's 5 years old! I knew he must have died and had some doctor try and bring him back with a new brain lmao. Or maybe he has that thing where you get younger instead of older. Because yep he's 5!!
24 | Niall Martellus | So trump, in a private conversation, referenced grabbing by the pussy, the gold digging type of women, that are only around him for one reason, which is to get a little capital out of getting their pussies grabbed???...STOP THE PRESSES!!!
25 | Vickie Cordell Meshaw | I do not believe he will stay in office even if he wins. He will come up with some excuse to bow out and then we will have Pence for president. I believe this has been his plan, from the beginning!

3 | Anne Flynn | Dow Chemical is a client of Teneo Holdings, a powerful consulting firm founded by former Bill Clinton ‚Äúbody man‚Äù Doug Band and ex-Hillary Clinton envoy Declan Kelly and staffed heavily with former Clinton Foundation employees. Dow signed with Teneo for $2.8 million shortly after the consultancy set up shop in 2011, the same year that Sadara was founded. In June 2012, Hillary Clinton‚Äôs top confidante, her deputy chief of staff Huma Abedin, quietly arranged to begin work as a ‚Äúspecial government employee,‚Äù going part-time at Foggy Bottom in order to work simultaneously at Teneo, Dow‚Äôs consulting firm. No announcement was made, and State Department officials played along with media outlets still referring to her as Clinton‚Äôs deputy chief of staff. The New York Times finally broke the story in May 2013, three months after Abedin had left the consulting firm. (Abedin‚Äôs time at Teneo is now under investigation by the State Department, and Iowa Republican senator Chuck Grassley has asked that the department provide all e-mails related to her employment there.) Around the same time in 2012 that Abedin ‚Äî who grew up in Saudi Arabia ‚Äî joined Teneo, Dow‚Äôs Saudi subsidiary Sadara began lobbying the U.S. Export-Import Bank for a taxpayer-subsidized loan. Fred Hochberg, the chairman of the Ex-Im Bank, is a close associate of the Clintons. A long-time friend of the family, he was a political appointee during President Clinton‚Äôs tenure and a campaign bundler during Hillary Clinton‚Äôs 2008 run, and he‚Äôs been a long-time private donor to both Clintons‚Äô political campaigns and the Clinton Foundation. He‚Äôs also frequently shared the stage and panel tables with Dow‚Äôs Liveris at Clinton Global Initiative conferences. The Ex-Im Board voted to approve Sadara‚Äôs request for a loan on August 22, 2012. By September 27, they had decided on an amount ‚Äî $4.975 billion, the largest loan in the Ex-Im Bank‚Äôs history. Heritage Foundation scholar and Ex-Im Bank expert Diane Katz is surprised by the loan‚Äôs size, particularly considering the beneficiaries. ‚ÄúDow Chemical hardly needs to benefit from subsidies,‚Äù she says, ‚Äúand I suspect that the House of Saud really doesn‚Äôt need U.S. taxpayer subsidies.‚Äù The Ex-Im Bank describes itself as a ‚Äúlender of last resort,‚Äù providing financing only to companies that cannot fund themselves or earn private financial banking.http://www.nationalreview.com/article/421081/hillary-clinton-ex-im-5-billion-loan-saudis-dow-chemical

1 | Kevin Miller | The bible came into being from translations from copies of translated translations from oral traditions. Its all folklore fairy tales from a primitive, backwards, ignorant, misogynistic culture.
2 | Charles Marean | The article is wrong. In Leviticus, God didn't tell them anything. A Babylonian military leader, an enemy of Egypt, claiming to be God said those things. He was very bad. The Jews were still slaves after crossing the Red Sea. They were the slaves of the Babylonians who rustled them from Pharaoh. Their Lord, as he called himself, wanted them to fight in his army because he wanted to take over Palestine, then called Canaan. He made the watch animals be killed to toughen, as a part of a religion he made up for them. People who think the Bible is a book of wise saying obviously haven't read it, or are pulling your leg.

1 | Chris Pietrowski Quinn | Then they are lying because if a guy is in a locker room and don't talk about girls then there is something wrong js I'm in high school and have been in college and professionally locker rooms and we talk about girls all the time they are lying to look good
2 | Peter Santi | Bull shit... I (as an athlete) have also been in many a locker room... yea those conversations happen... just like those onversations also take place at "ladies night out"... believe me... they don't just sit around and talk about the latest knitting styles.
3 | Glenn Ralph | They must be athletes who are supporting Hillary which is why they are saying this isn't locker room talk. I've been in plenty of locker rooms and trust me Trump was just engaging in locker room talk. No biggie.
4 | Kaja Wooten-Bowman | You mean the professional athletes that are accused if rape, assault and murder? The ones that will not stand for the Anthem? Hypocrites and liars.
5 | Diane M. George | Guys "talk" to each other about girls all the time ... Who cares what he said ... It is what Bill and Hillary actually DID ... Bill raped ... Hillary attacked the female victims ... She also has nothing to do with Bill's African-American son ... Other than they gave him some Christmas presents ... Hillary is a lying criminal and belongs in jail ... Trump apologized ... Move on ...

8 | Christine Ward | TRUMP SUPPORTERS: make the video below go viral. Because we know the mainstream media won't cover anything negative about Hillary or things that really matter when choosing a president!!CBS- quit being biased and childish! Why don't you report on what really matters! This country has real problems (security, terrorism, illegal immigration, the economy, and that we are on the brink of a war), but you choose to focus on words that were said 11 years ago?! You are losing viewers by the groves! I use to respect your journalism. You are no longer journalists. Instead, you are more like a tabloid! Real journalists report truth about both sides of a story. They don't let their own opinions sneak into their journalism! And they certainly do not use their position to sway voters in an election! America is supposed to be a Democracy!!! Why don't you report on things that really matter to the voters? Such as the video I'm posting below!!!! http://endingthefed.com/hillarys-camp-freaking-out-as-this-video-goes-viral-no-way-to-stop-it-now.html
9 | Joy Watson | The whole problem is that Killary is trying to do anything to find dirt on Trump, and they had to go 10 years back to find something~anything!  When Killary has done so many things within those 10 years that have have destroyed peoples lives in Benghazi, all her corruption, taking money from our Enemy's Abroad! The list goes on and on and yet people close there eyes and ears to her Evil Deeds and try and toss Trump under bus for what? Actually Nothing!   People need to get their head OUT of their A@@ and finally say NO Killary!  #Vote Trump/Pence 2017 YES!
10 | Tiffany Marie Begneaud | Copied :Anyone offended by what Mr. Trump said needs to read this:The real Hillary.... Her actual words:1) "Where is the God damn flag? I want the God damn fucking flag up every morning at fucking sunrise". Hillary to staff at the Arkansas Governor's mansion on Labor Day 1991. From the book "Inside the White House" by Ronald Kessler, p. 244 (2) "Fuck off! It's enough I have to see you shit-kickers every day! I'm not going to talk to you, too! Just do your Goddamn job and keep your mouth shut." Hillary to her State Trooper bodyguards after one of them greeted her with "Good Morning." From the book "America Evita" by Christopher Anderson, p.90 (3) "If you want to remain on this detail, get your fucking ass over here and grab those bags!" Hillary to a Secret Service Agent who was reluctant to carry her luggage because he wanted to keep his hands free in case of an incident. From the book "The First Partner" p. 25 (4) "Stay the fuck back, stay the fuck back away from me! Don't come within ten yards of me, or else! Just fucking do as I say, Okay!!?" Hillary screaming at her Secret Service detail. From the book "Unlimited Access" by Clinton 's FBI Agent-in-Charge, Gary Aldridge, p.139 (5) "Where's the miserable cock sucker?" (otherwise known as "Bill Clinton") Hillary shouting at a Secret Service officer. From the book "The Truth about Hillary" by Edward Klein, p. 5(6) "You fucking idiot" Hillary to a State Trooper who was driving her to an event. From the book "Crossfire" ~pg. 84(7) "Put this on the ground! I left my sunglasses in the limo. I need those fucking sunglasses! We need to go back!√¢‚Ç¨ Hillary to Marine One helicopter pilot to turn back while in route to Air Force One. From the book " Dereliction of Duty" p. 71-72(8) "Come on Bill, put your dick up! You can't fuck her here!!" Hillary to Gov. Bill Clinton when she spots him talking with an attractive female. From the book "Inside the White House" by Ronald Kessler, p. 243There it is ........book, chapter and page.......the real Hillary Rotten Clinton!Additionally, when she walked around the White House, NO ONE was permitted to look her in the eye, they all had to lower their heads with their eyes towards the ground whenever she walked by. Clearly she is a class act! NOT!This ill-tempered, violent, loud-mouth, hateful and abusive woman wants to be your next President, and have total control as Commander-in-Chief of our Military, the very Military for which she has shown incredible disdain throughout her public life.Remember her most vile comment about Benghazi: "What difference at this point does it make?"Now it will be clear why the crew of "Marine One" helicopter nicknamed the craft, "Broomstick ONE!"

13 | Albert Dikkes | If you are Gay, why are you voting for H¬≠illary when she wants to bring in millio¬≠ns of refugees that believe gays should ¬≠be executed?If you are Black, why are you voting for¬≠ Hillary when she defends Planned Parent¬≠hood and admires Margaret Sanger, who wa¬≠nted to abort as many black babies as po¬≠ssible and exterminate the black race be¬≠cause they are like "weeds." Most of tho¬≠se clinics are in Black neighborhoods.If you are a Woman, how can you vote for¬≠ Hillary when she has buried all of Bill¬≠'s rape victims under the rug. As an att¬≠orney, Hillary also defended the rapist ¬≠of a 12-year old girl and laughed about ¬≠it later. She plays the woman-card and a¬≠cts entitled; implying that she deserve¬≠s your vote merely because of her sex. H¬≠ow is that gender neutral?If you have are a Miner, Steelworker or ¬≠have a Factory job, why are you voting f¬≠or Hillary when she supported NAFTA and ¬≠TPP, and workers are being laid off beca¬≠use jobs are going overseas? She also we¬≠lcomes open borders and illegals to get ¬≠benefits with your tax money and compet¬≠e for our jobs. Hillary boasts that unde¬≠r her administration miners and steelwor¬≠kers will lose their jobs.If you are a Law abiding citizen, how ca¬≠n you vote for Hillary when she is clear¬≠ly above the law? Hillary deleted thousa¬≠nds of secret e-mails *after* they had b¬≠een subpoenaed by the courts (illegal). ¬≠Hillary kept thousands of classified and¬≠ top secret e-mails on her private serv¬≠er; servers that had less security that ¬≠g-mail and Hotmail. You can be sure Russ¬≠ia, Iran, and China have those now. The ¬≠DNC clearly broke the rules by heavy-han¬≠dedly favoring Hillary over Sanders whil¬≠e they were still competing for the nom¬≠ination.If you are a Veteran, in the military, o¬≠r closely related to a military member, ¬≠why are you voting for Hillary when she ¬≠left those men to die in Benghazi and ha¬≠d the nerve to lie about it over and ove¬≠r again? They called for help, but the h¬≠elp was told to stand down. Furthermore¬≠, Hillary wants to eliminate the NRA, ta¬≠ke away your guns, and abolish the secon¬≠d amendment?Who is left?¬≠ Please share¬≠!!

17 | Timothy Paul Carroll | The shock of the "Trump video" has  worn off. It's still very disappointing, but I'm not voting for a new pastor in November. The debate was the most extremely caustic debate I have ever seen, and at times I enjoyed it immensely. A lot of those insults were the truth. The media never reports them accurately, if it reports them at all, so I thoroughly approved of the long unreported facts coming to light in a live setting. At the end of the day I'm not going to get the candidate I'd hoped for, but I'll take ending the ACA (Obamacare) and more pro life Supreme Court Justices. It's better than four more years of record debt, pseudo socialism, political correctness and economic woe.#trump2016
18 | Christine Ward | Hey CBS NEWS...., why don't you report how Hillary and the Democrat establishment has been lying about Trump not paying any Federal Taxes for 20 years?!Seems like to me he paid 40 million in Federal Taxes in 2013!!! Just another biased lie you are spewing to sway voters to vote for Hillary! You are a disgrace to journalism world wide!!!https://www.facebook.com/gpereiradecampos/posts/10209814010481036
19 | Sherrie Flowers | I do not condone eithers words or actions. An article is merely an opinion. We all have them and it is our privilege to vote as we see fit. As far as "what locker room has he been hanging out in"?, probably the same ones as those writing the article. To say that men or women for that fact, do not talk like that in a "locker room" or any other room for that matter, is absurd. Sex has been around how long?! Talk is cheap. Actions speak louder than words. To our knowledge, no one has died via Donald Trump. However the Clintons have blood on their hands. Praying God will show our country Mercy once more. But then again, why should He?! We've tried taking Him out of everything and have managed to take Him out of alot of things, because we cater to the few instead of the majority. Shame on us, so called Christians (which means to be "Christ" like), for sitting down instead of standing up for our beliefs. As always, I include myself. We'd better be praying instead of complaining and arguing. A house divided will not stand! Our country is divided!!Even so Lord, come quickly!
20 | David Potter | Are people really this ignorant, that they don't understand what he meant by "locker room" talk? Ive heard and engaged in this type of talk both in and out of locker rooms.  It was a private conversation by two men.  I don't defend it, but really??  Gee, if only we got to hear ALL of the private conversations had by EVERYONE.  I wonder what we might learn?
21 | Angela Schuermann | I have just ONE question: So what you're saying is,  YOU have NEVER had one single conversation about a woman or women in a sexual manner, locker room or not? LIARS. Would also like to know why so many of you professional athletes have RAPE charges against them?
22 | Craig T Wanderer | As an athlete I heard plenty. Working as a cook allowed me to hear waitress conversation unhinged, and lemme tell ya they make men blush. As a bartender I heard it all. People talk, that is all the vast majority of the time. Those that act are the ones you need to watch out for.
23 | Glenn Knarr Jr. | Wow why are so many athletes lock up for rape and assault on women? Now this takes the cake what a bunch of liars they all talk about their booty calls and multiple partners, ect. Women go too clubs and places and say pretty much the same things sorry! Media your all dicks and Pussies for even making an issue out of this, is the media scared also that they only pick and choose what makes the news!
24 | Wayne Phillips | CBS.. I find it more and more difficult to believe anything you people report anymore. You guys just keep reporting falsehoods with ever increasing speed. He's lieing. It happens ALOT. It always happened when I was in school. And it happened during gym and scholastic sports.
25 | Tiffany Ewing-Goddard | Cbs you are hanging yourself with your bias station!!  I call BS on this!  Most men talk this way inside a locker room, outside a locker room, in bars, during coffee, when men get together they talk about women unless they are gay. even then they gossip about a women's look!

This is why you have riots. People are just pissed off and will jump on anything to show how mad they are, justified or not.
2 | Bob Owen | You could have a justified shooting, caught on body cams, with witnesses and there would still be riots because the media brainwashes the people into believing cops are killing people on purpose. If that was true they would just stop patrolling and let them kill each other.

8 | Faizal Hussin | US airspace was guarded by American soldiers with a highly sophisticated defense system. You can not enter US airspace without permission. Jets and a sophisticated radar system will constantly monitor the air space. If you entering US airspace without permission, only a few seconds, American jets will warned that you must surrender. If you refused, they would shoot you. This is a fact which everyone knows. How can they claim that terrorists violate the WTC and the Pentagon with a plane ? hahaha funny ! Do you know about Pentagon ? hahaha This is the most funniest films in the world directed by George W Bush. hahaha The sequence of these events, Iraq has been destroyed. This heartbreaking events to people around the world. We are so easily duped by George W Bush and his ally saw very horrible destruction against Iraq. Until today the American people are still fooled by fraud committed by George W Bush. George W Bush has killed Americans. I hope the American people wake up from dreams and demands justice.

First, they race-bait - The headline always includes the race of both the Officer's and the suspect, regardless of whether race is even relevant to the story.  Secondly, they inflate the story to generate more clicks/viewers, before knowing all the facts of the case.  Instead of waiting for a statement or investigation on whether it was justified, they jump on the story, utilizing unreliable witnesses  (example - He had a book... His hands were up).  They will also include witness video that has not been vetted  for tampering.  The rush to get the story out there, takes precedence over facts.  Once the facts are clear, the damage is already done... To the community, the Officer's career and public confidence.  It is irresponsible and reckless.
15 | Jack Dee | Media still trying to get the ratings I see but don't care when a cop is killed.... FUCK the media. Not one of them know how to be a journalist these days

1 | Terri Rodriguez | I  am Latina!!! not Hispanic and  I'M WITH HER.. HILLARY FOR PRESIDENT. .. you say HISPANICS ARE TIRED, talk for yourself not for All. It seems to me you want to make a buck with these uneducated trump Supporters
2 | Bob Adams | Breaking: DNC Chief Donna Brazile Leaked Sanders Info to Clinton CampaignThe media thinks you can‚Äôt be trusted to think for yourself. Propaganda: information, especially of a biased or misleading nature, used to promote or publicize a particular political cause or point of view.
3 | Kathy Harvey | I am voting for closed borders and the supreme court...I dont intend on dating either one of the presidents or their spouces
4 | Jim Gavin | how about an article on the clinton foundation or the 30 thousand + emails Hiliary deleted? Or how about her calling millions of Americans Racist bigots? Or how she used an unsecured email and unsecured email server to send and receive top secret emails? Or how about how she donated her own money to her own foundation for a tax write off? Or how she took large donations from foreign countries for special access to her and her decisions as secretary of state? Or how she left four hero marines in the middle of a battle defenseless to die in Benghazi? She can spew anything she wants about being stronger together, about caring for children and the black and Hispanic communities about fair pay for women, about people and businesses paying their fair share...Hiliary you have had 30 + years to do all this, It your actions during those years of being a sneaky corrupt shameless liar that speaks the truth about you.
5 | Shanti Keyz | Doesn't matter who you vote for. It's an opinion in case you all forgot the first round with president not elected Bush jr. The electorials already know who won. The rest is a horse and pony show for all of you. Enjoy the entertainment while the powers that really be put who they want in power.
6 | Tobbie Ricks | You call Trump supporters uneducated. That proves how little you possess. I personally have an earned advanced degree. I am smart enough to understand that Hillary's love of Margaret Sanger and Robert Byrd shows her support for their views on all that were not white. That includes you Terri Rodriguez. Yet you support her. Just how uneducated does that make you and all the others?
7 | Jim Gavin | Hiliary has had 30 + years to do all the empty promises she is spewing, her actions during those years of being a sneaky corrupt shameless liar speak the truth about her.
8 | Fred Macia | Here is a fact: a Frank Luntz focus group of undecided voters went from leaning 9-8 for Trump before the debate to 18-4 afterwards. Even Luntz had to admit that he might have been too quick in writing off Trump‚Äôs chances. Why has CBS NEWS NOT INVITED LUNTZ BACK ON THE SHOW!!????
9 | Johnathon Wayne | The electoral college is nothing more than a backdoor for the elitist to cheat the elections in a last ditch effort and it needs to be done away with.
10 | Richard Dent | Thats why the lying liberal media is now fabricating that HILLIARIOUS is winning Ohio.  The George Soros smear campaign of Trump is on full overdrive by his puppet media. Here is a little hint, media folks, NO ONE WITH A BRAIN BELIEVES ANYTHING YOU SAY!!!!!!!!  GTH.#TRUMP2016 and you know it and you FEAR IT! #GetOverIt already!
11 | Paul B Viisola | Trump/Pence 2016. There's a party in Mike Pence and you're invited!
12 | Beverly A. Class | per Kurt Eichenwald‚Äè, Twitter tonight "Russian govt put out propaganda w/ bogus email. It ends up in Trumps hands hours later, where he reads it to crowd."
13 | Jerry Allsman | I remember when Missouri Republican Todd Akin spoke about abortion and rape, and said he was concerned that women who were not legitimately raped would attempt to make up that excuse just to get an abortion, and also said that he preferred criminalizing the rapist rather than the baby!!The media went absolutely ballistic on Todd Akin, and ram-rodded him out of office.Now we have a Democrat woman who is married to an accused rapist. She attacked her husband's rape victim as illegitimate. She defended another rapist in court, and attacked that rapist's little 12-year-old victim as illegitimate . . .and the entire mainstream media is actively campaigning for her and trying to get her elected President of the United States.
14 | Rudy Gadrey | look at any electoral map analysis; Hillary does not need Ohio. Trump is finished.
15 | Stephanie Cherry Wright | If you're looking for news not owned by the establishment, check out Drudge Report, Breitbart, and Infowars.
16 | Cindy Lee | Trumps Trade policies are based on higher taxes on American citizens, devaluing the US dollar and high inflation.Trumps  trade wars will hurt many US businesses and Farmers that export. Tariffs will raise prices creating inflation hurting the buying power of the consumer and US Businesses. Just remember Tariffs are a tax on American Citizens. A 30% tax added to goods put on top of sales taxes will hurt a lot of people and businesses. When tariffs were implemented in 1930 other Countries retaliated, which ended up destroying world trade by 75%. It's believed that the Great Depression was caused by US tariff taxes.The world economy is very complex. When US consumers pay higher prices they purchase less things, that in itself hurts businesses. When other Countries retaliate by stopping trade or put tariff taxes on our exports it hurts our businesses.We need to look at history to be reminded of the consequences of putting Socialist controls and Tariff Taxes on Capitalism.My case in point;Consequences of the Smoot-Hawley Tariffhttp://americanhistory.about.com/.../f/smoot_hawley.htmFree trade agreements eliminate barriers to allow competition. It opens up 95% of the world market for US exports. Many of those agreements eliminate tariff taxes on US exports and allows American goods and Produce to be shipped to other countries. It has kept prices down on many items giving Americans more buying power. Eliminating competition will only drive up prices and deteriorate the quality of products. Trade wars will drive America into another depression like the Tariff Taxes did in 1930, when other Countries retaliated, which destroyed world trade by 75% putting millions out of work. The Great Depression is defined by the high unemployment rates that was caused by US Tariff Taxes.The stock market crash was at the end of 1929. It was the start of the Great Depression, but what defined the Great Depression was the high unemployment rate. The Tariff Taxes rose the costs of goods so people bought less products hurting businesses. Other Countries retaliated by stopping trade or putting Tariff Taxes on American products, which decreased world Trade by 75%. Many Factories shut down creating high unemployment, which compounded the problem and by 1932 the Great Depression was at it's peak. The economy is very delicate and could crash and burn if not handled correctly. People want proven leadership and sound ideas. Uncertainty is the enemy of US markets and world trade. That uncertainty will impact the stock market.
17 | Chepo Team | As American hispanics, we are tired of how all of these coward racist liberals that hate America like Obama, Clinton, and their supporters are trying to turn this great country into a 3rd world one. Unfortunately, one of the biggest problems we have right now is the media and entertainment that are always trying to tell us how to think. They have created enough imbeciles that would re-elect a failure like Obama. Even more, we're supposed to bow down to anti-American Obama, love liberal policies no matter how destructive they are, love bigger enslaving government, and be in favor of illegal immigration because of the color of our skin... disgusting. That's why we support Donald Trump. Show everyone your support for Trump by buying the fantastic Trump Strong t-shirt at: www.teespring.com/trumpstrong .And let's Make America Great Again! Thank you.
18 | Cindy Lee | The facts expose Trump's INSANE proposals. If 3,000 illegal's were deported a day every day for 10 years it would not add up to 11 Million deported. That would be a Tremendous costs to the Taxpayers and create at least 25,000 vacant houses a month every month for 10 years. The housing market would crash and burn.Deporting 11 Million people will create millions of vacant houses destroying the housing market. Home prices would fall. Realtors, loan officers, appraisers, contractors, building material suppliers, truck drivers and many people in the housing market would be put out of work.Riots would break out in the streets destroying tourism, crushing many cities in Florida, Texas, California and more. Insurance costs would skyrocket.Hotels, motels and restaurants would close due to lack of tourism, lack of workers and high labor costs.Livestock would die, Crops would rot in the fields creating shortages and driving up food prices.The National debt would skyrocket taking away much needed money for new roads, infrastructure and our military.
19 | Cindy Lee | A Newsweek investigation has found that in at least two of Trump‚Äôs last three construction projects, Trump opted to purchase his steel and aluminum from Chinese manufacturers rather than United States corporations based in states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin. In other instances, he abandoned steel altogether, instead choosing the far-less-expensive option of buying concrete from various companies, including some linked to the Luchese and Genovese crime families. Trump has never been accused of engaging in any wrongdoing for his business dealings with those companies, but it‚Äôs true that the Mafia has long controlled much of the concrete industry in New York.

11 | Moler M Sandra | The Clintons. Be forewarned!!! The most corrupt family ever to be in DC.And uninformed people are going to vote for her.Charles Krauthammer:   ‚ÄúON THE CLINTON'S‚Äù The Clinton Foundation is "organized crime" at it's finest, and we are financing it!  Here is a good, concise summary of how the Clinton Foundation works as a tax free international money laundering scheme.  It may eventually prove to be the largest political criminal enterprise in U.S. history and their undoing.  This is a textbook case on how to hide foreign money sent to you and re-package it, to be used for your own purposes. All tax free.   Here's how it works: 1. You create a separate foreign "charity."  In their case one in Canada. 2. Foreign oligarch's & governments, then donate to this Canadian charity.  In this case, over 1,000 contributed mega millions.  I am sure they did this out of the goodness of their hearts, and expected nothing in return.  (Imagine Putin's buddies waking up one morning and just deciding to send un-told millions to a Canadian charity). 3.The Canadian charity then bundles these separate unidentified individual donations & makes a massive donations to the Clinton Foundation.  4. The Clinton Foundation, and the cooperating Canadian charity claim Canadian law prohibits, the identification of individual donors. 5. The Clinton Foundation, then "spends" some of this money, for legitimate good works programs.  Un-fortunately, experts believe this is on the order of a mere 10%.  Much of the balance goes to enrich the Clinton's,  pay "salaries?" to un-told numbers of hangers on, & fund lavish travel, etc.  Again virtually all tax free, which means you & I are subsidizing it. 6. The Clinton Foundation with access to the world's best accountants, somehow fails to report much of this on their tax filings.  They discover these "clerical errors" and begin the process of re-filing 5 years of tax returns. 7. Net result: foreign money, much of it from other countries, goes into the Clinton's pockets tax free & untraceable back to the original donor. This is the textbook definition of money laundering.  Oh, by the way, the Canadian "charity" includes, as a principal one Frank Giustra.  Google him.  He is the guy who was central to the formation of Uranium One, the Canadian company that somehow acquired massive U.S. uranium interests and then sold them to an organization controlled by Russia.  This transaction required U.S. State Department approval.  Guess who was Secretary of State, when the approval, was granted?  As an aside, imagine how former, Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell feels.  That poor schlep, is in jail because he and his wife took $165,000 in gifts and loans for doing minor favors for a guy promoting a vitamin company. Not legal, but it didn't exactly put U.S. security at risk.  Sarcasm aside, if you are still not persuaded, this was cleverly structured in order to get unidentified foreign money to the Clinton's.   Ask yourself this: Why did these foreign interests, funnel money, through a Canadian charity?  Why not donate directly to the Clinton Foundation? Better yet, why not donate money directly to the people, organizations & countries in need?  This is the essence of money laundering and influence peddling.   Now you know why Hillary's destruction of 30,000 e-mails was a risk she was willing to take.  Bill and Hillary are devious, unprincipled, dishonest, and criminal.  They are Slick!  Warning : They could be back in the White House, in January 2017.  Do not let it happen.   Remember, most people are not well informed.  Be inform and educated!   Charles KrauthammerGod Bless America

More than a week after the storm, power is still out, while water and food are scarce.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Raj Binder | The Clinton Foundation sure screwed Haiti the last time a disaster struck. They should fork over the billions they owe to Haitians.
2 | Ellen Boatwright Horn | Doesn't Trump have a foundation?  OH, I forgot.  He hasn't supported it since 2008 and took money out to pay debts and purchase a portrait of himself.  Guess he doesn't have anything left to actually help anyone - except, of course, himself.
3 | James Shirey | That country needs help! We take things like running water and electricity for granted, and those people are living outside, with no shelter, and nothing to eat...! I wonder how long they'll be waiting for help to arrive THIS time! We all know how long it took after the earthquake, or have we forgotten?! God help those in need!
4 | Todd Wilson | Of course it's Clintons fault the hurricane happened. Just shows the stupidity of Trump supporters. Idiots will vote Trump no matter what. Even raping a 13 year old but Trump supporters will say it was locker room shenanigans. How do you sleep at night supporting a piece of shit?
5 | Richard Drayton | Raj, they did it all over Africa. Every dime should be returned, but who will pay for their jets, houses etc.? Remarkable that people cannot see the Trojan Horse she is serving up again! She obviously knows nothing about business (the golden goose that allows for all this other non-sense) or she would have asked Goldman Sacks for a million dollars not $200m. They would gladly have paid. That is about a weeks lunch money for the group she spoke too. She is also tremendously angry deep down, but it is actually pretty obvious. This is not a happy woman and she comes armed with a Progressive agenda. You can't open the eyes of the uneducated except with their pocket books. I guess we will have to go through it and it will be ugly. Heck even the Chinese are reducing their regulations on foreign investments. They are smart and understand business. They will eat Hillary for lunch as will Iran and Russia. She is not going to change and admit how wrong the Progressives are much less that she lied and will again. Progressives have a pretty bad history, but you will not hear it because they could never get elected. Not going to hear it from our trusted media either. Heck, the main stream media would have made Gobbels proud over the last year.
6 | Joseph Harris | Makes me wish I had the money to own and operate something like a C-130. Airdrop a few dozen crates of supplies and fly off. Of course, knowing my luck, the Haitian government would scramble jets and shoot me down...
