2 | Jo Clarke | 22 | 10155571083651509_10155571086116509 | I love coming here to read the comments. Some people (like myself at times) are obsessed with reading comments. For example, we find you reading this comment right now, which does not contain any useful information, only curiosity, that drives you to waste your time. Have a good day. And God Bless America.

Exterminate the black race because they are like "weeds". (Margaret Sanger quote) Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.üëÅ‚ö†If you are a Christian, Why are you voting for Hillary Clinton when she wrote her Senior thesis on Saul Alinsky who dedicated his book 'Rules for Radicals' to Lucifer (the Devil)? She says he was, and still is her mentor.üëÅ‚ö†If you are a Veteran, in the Military, or closely related to a Military member, Why are you voting for Hillary when she left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again? They called for help but the help was told to stand down.üëÅ‚ö†If you have a factory job, Why are you voting for Hillary when she supported TPP? Factory workers are being laid off because jobs are going over seas. Don't forget the deals she's made with china. She also welcomes open borders and illegals to get benefits to be paid with Your tax money.üëÅ‚ö†If you are poor, Why are you voting for Hillary, when she is supporting Wall street and all the big banks? Big banks keep poor people poor by destroying the poor man's credit by allowing medical bills and collections to affect your credit scores so you can pay higher interest rates than the rich; Taking much of the little money you earn.üëÅ‚ö†If you are a Woman, how can you vote for Hillary when she has buried all of Bills rape victims under the rug, including that little girl that was raped? Lawyer Hillary defended the rapist, and then she laughed about it later, knowing that he was guilty.If you carry a gun, or believe in the Constitution; How can you vote for Hillary when she wants to eliminate the NRA, Take your guns, and abolish the second Amendment?üëÅ‚ö†If you breathe, Why would you vote for Hillary when she and the Clinton crime family have left a trail of dead people that did not agree with her, or they knew too much?Who is left? üëÅ VOTE TRUMP!!!

Even Obama said how corrupt she is. But hey vote for Hillary for more of the same, that has destroyed this country or vote Trump who brings change and will do what it takes to stop corruption. Yes Trump says things that are wrong but at least he's not afraid to speak his mind. His words do not compare to Hillary's actions
4 | William Wroldsen | 68 | 10155570893436509_10155570910626509 | No the only horrible thing the Americans need to escape from is crooked Hillary becoming president she will turn us into a third world country and then destroy us. Mr. Trump will save America
5 | Kellie Defelice | 51 | 10155570893436509_10155570935076509 | CNN we get it. You hate Trump and you will move to Canada if he wins. Your bias is blinding. This is your second article about this. It's old now. üôÑüôÑ
6 | Willie Christina Ford | 48 | 10155570893436509_10155570927721509 | Remember that the once famous CNN is a disgrace to American journalism. They want us to vote for a murderous liar that can buy her way out of any trouble. Remember when you vote tomorrow how Hillary will bring the end of this great country. But wait Mr. President Donald Trump will win and will make us greater. He will rescue the American people.

8 | Jimmy Haley | 23 | 10155570893436509_10155570922441509 | I'm Canadian. Just wondering why the media is trying to make Trump look so much worse than Hillary ? If he's so bad why are the American people and media worried he will get into office ? This would make me suspicious if I were America.
9 | M Hilal Arfeen | 27 | 10155570893436509_10155570896476509 | Donald trump only win election in dreams now,he is losing grip and popularity in every state after badly exposed his character in front of nation and on other side hillary is gaining popularity in every state and very near to win the election,donald trump crap politics going to end soon and he will join comedy circus to entertain public after say good bye to politics forever.
10 | Ronnie T Hamernik | 22 | 10155570893436509_10155570900376509 | When you vote,remember,Hillary Clinton supports Abortion at any stage!!..Thats murder!!..Keep that in mind, those that claim they are Christian or of any other faith!!..A Fetus is a human being,a gift from God!!..To end its life is murder!!..
11 | Melissa Vance Cornelius | 7 | 10155570893436509_10155570993241509 | Why is CNN constantly bashing Trump?? He's not my favorite but he's actually got some good points and the main one is stopping illegals from getting all these freebies that our tax dollars pay for! I'm all for people coming to America legally but illegally and reaping tons of benefits is seriously just wrong... This is such common sense!! We've recently adopted 2 kids from foster care and their are so many children that need help! That are already living here! Drugs are a serious problem and causing children to be severely neglected! If securing our borders helps less drugs coming in the better off our children are!! Seriously think of this when you Vote tomorrow! ü§ó
12 | Amy Ruth McIntosh | 7 | 10155570893436509_10155570969861509 | I can't picture a world WITH secure borders and properly vetted immigrants. I think I'll try waltzing into Canada with no ID, instead of using the app.I can't imagine having term limits on congress.It terrifies me to think of an end to unethical lobbying or pay for play. I'm mortified to imagine having a government that wouldn't rob my family of our healthcare then force me to pay a fine because I can't afford their forced plan. I don't see how building our military and taking care of our veterans could be The right thing to do. Just a few of the things that terrify me of a Trump Presidency. Unfathomable horror!!!
13 | Roderick Brost | 8 | 10155570893436509_10155570975551509 | My country and citizenship are not for sale! As a Canadian I'm offended at the very fact liberals in America would think we'd somehow go for this. It's corrupt and it's validation that overall the dems influence peddle
14 | Diana Santopietro | 6 | 10155570893436509_10155570977731509 | CNN, stop with your BS reporting.  We all saw the emails between you and the Hillary campaign. I hope you get sued right out of business for all your lies.
15 | Pam Gaber Goodman | 3 | 10155570893436509_1811819175697464 | Michelle Obama said if Donald Trump is elected: "We're telling our sons it's okay to humiliate women. We're telling our daughters this is how they deserve to be treated.".... that's funny. So does that mean that if Hillary Clinton is elected, we are teaching our sons & daughters that it's ok to murder, lie, cover up, be corrupt, demean women, use racial slurs, and stay with a spouse that openly rapes women & cheats on you?
16 | Zach Kerman | 27 | 10155570893436509_10155570894176509 | Well‚Ä¶ the first female president should be someone to be proud of, not a felon who cheated and lied. She will be more remembered for her scandals than for being the first female president. Is Trump perfect? no, he isn't, but clinton is who will make your life a real hell. Think about it. Thank you - #TrumpPence #MAGA
17 | Willie Christina Ford | 3 | 10155570893436509_10155571033601509 | Trump has already won the American vote. If she wins there will be a war among us because we are fed up with corrupt politics and bought media. Americans want a leader who cares about us and mark my words. There will be a war within if she fraudulently wins.

I will definitely win the election.‚ÄùHillary says to Donald: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the typical dishonesty you have displayed throughout your entire life, trickery and deceit.

5 | Wing Cheung | 20 | 10155570808951509_10155570856841509 | Trump has to be the most crooked & dishonest businessman I have ever study. Orange Messiah lacks intelligence & integrity. He's more qualified as used car salesman than US president. Don't make the mistakes like his University student, paying thousands for empty promises
6 | Francisco Fernandez Jr. | 22 | 10155570808951509_10155570811411509 | Bill Clinton cheats on his wife. Impeach him. Trump proudly brags about sexual assault (and has cheated on his wives). Elect him. Hillary oversaw the department of state while 4 people died in an embassy attack. Put her in jail. 2 Republicans were in office while over 200 people died in embassy attacks. No problem. Immigrants don't pay taxes. Round them up and kick them out. Trump doesn't pay taxes. He's a business genius. Hillary's foundation only spent 87% of their donations helping people. She's a crook. Trumps foundation paid off his debts, bought sculptures of him, and made political donations to avoid investigations while using less than 5% of funds for charity (and he got shut down by NY State). So savvy... Put him in the white house. Trump made 4 billion dollars in 40 years, when an index fund started at the same time with the same "small loans" he received would be worth $12 billion today... without a trail of bankruptcies, thousands of lawsuits and burned small business owners. He's a real business whiz. Hillary took a loss of $700k. She's a criminal. Trump is the first candidate in the modern era not to release his tax returns, and took a billion dollar loss in 1 year. Genius. Hillary takes responsibility for private email servers and apologizes. Not credible. Trump denies saying things (on the record) he actually said (on the record), he's just telling it like it is.Your arguments are thin. Your ignorance of reality is shocking. Your double-standards are offensive, and your willingness to blindly support him and recycle the rhetoric is absurd. Your opinion is not fact. Your memes are not news articles. And your hypocrisy is not a platform.

19 | Bobby Chance | 0 | 10155570808951509_10155570843991509 | I'm an Indiana citizen and I'll be first to tell you that this was happening in the primaries too. I received a text message from the Bernie Sanders campaign telling me my closest voting location was 24 miles away when I had one that was less than one mile away. I informed the campaign that they were giving me the wrong information; however, within my county, you can vote at any polling station in the county. The whole county is done electronically and they can pull the information from any precinct so I could have gone to the one 24 miles away. The only ones this is really hurting is the Democratic Party of Indiana. But it does make me wonder though that if they had the problem in the primaries and they're having the issue now, maybe they do need to check that their systems are correct more often.

Exterminate the black race because they are like "weeds".

They called for help but the help was told to stand down.üëÅ‚ö†If you have a factory job, Why are you voting for Hillary when she supported TPP?

Women's suffragist Susan B. Anthony never got the chance to vote, so people are leaving "I voted" stickers on her grave http://cnn.it/2faMHMl
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Fabian Omar Verdugo | 46 | 10155570711291509_10155570728756509 | Republican Ann Coulter doesn't think women should have the right to vote LOL so when women vote Republican It's A Hard Punch to their own face
2 | Zach Schaefer | 29 | 10155570711291509_10155570811731509 | Susan b. Anthony didnt leave Americans to die. Susan b. Anthony didnt lie to the fbi and the American people. Susan b. Anthony didnt buy her way out of trouble. Susan b. Anthony, would in fact, roll in her grave to see Americans blindly follow a woman who would see this once great nation fall into a state of lies, deceit, murder, corruption and political correctness .....she already went through that once.
3 | Christian John | 16 | 10155570711291509_10155570746146509 | Wonder if Susan B would approve of or appreciate siding with and staying married to a known rapist. I also wonder if she would like it if any woman would fight for psychotic pedophile maniacs?
4 | Steph Heller Chepin | 18 | 10155570711291509_10155570724946509 | Don't vote for hatred =Trump or this will happen. .Trump would almost certainly face a global crisis even before he took office, as allies abroad are alarmed by his "America First" rhetoric and stated disregard for the international institutions the United States has led since World War II.
5 | Ken Kaplan | 17 | 10155570711291509_10155570735766509 | Susan B. Anthony probably did vote in this election, more than once.
6 | Jenuz Fteja Bajraktari | 7 | 10155570711291509_10155570796436509 | I love coming here to read the comments. Some people (like myself at times) are obsessed with reading comments. For example, we find you reading this comment right now, which does not contain any useful information, only curiosity, that drives you to waste your time. Have a good day.
7 | Tricia Anne Marie | 5 | 10155570711291509_10155570736146509 | Given Susan B. Anthony's racist, appalling statements about Black folk (I'm one) and that being a major driver for the suffragist movement, I think I'll pass on this on sticking anything on her grave.
8 | David Bourne | 4 | 10155570711291509_10155570776081509 | Defacing the grave, instead of leaving a sticker that will have to be either scraped off or falls of leaving a mess and residue on the stone they could have done something else.
9 | Kim Williams | 25 | 10155570711291509_10155570719726509 | So let's get this straight, the wife of a sexting pedophile works as the right hand person of the wife of a rapist. Both wives have a long history of standing behind their mans actions. One wife actually defended a pedophile rapist and set a guilty man free, destroyed the victims of her husband‚Äôs sexual assaults, And her campaign cries for women's rights? You got to be joking...
10 | Mahdi Hasan Anik | 3 | 10155570711291509_10155570747536509 | Tomorrow you will be the first woman president of the powerful nation on earth!!! Congratulating Madam President. Tomorrow is gonna be your victory day ever before because of your high moral values, kind heart, resilience in the face of adversity, and your message of love and togetherness in this world. There is simply nothing to keep you from the White House at all!!!
11 | Valdicer Ribeiro So√£res | 2 | 10155570711291509_10155570838441509 | Whom ever you chose to vote for as a responsible citizen of our country let's remember we all must live together and embrace one another because when it is all said and we are nation that is tolerant and fortunate to be who we are as Americans. The path to carve out our very direction by people we elect is an awesome power of responsibility.God bless our nation and our people citizens and immigrants!!!
12 | Ryan Hosein | 0 | 10155570711291509_10155570976836509 | Are we fired up and ready to go?!!? Let's elect the first female president who we know has stood her whole life for making change for the better. Let's vote blue down the ticket! Get your friends and family out to vote! Elect Hillary Clinton!!
13 | Ralph Duell | 1 | 10155570711291509_10155570894081509 | So let's deface her grave with stickers morons I'm all for giving her the respect she deserves but let's place a respectable lawn sign near her grave and place your stickers on that rather then vandalize her grave some people just don't think
14 | Chriz Ayomide Whiteman | 2 | 10155570711291509_10155570795696509 | Report just reaching us has it that donald j trump is leading with a landslide in the following cities; moscowseoulharare in zimbabwe and beijing chinaseems he forgot there votes doesnt count#hillaryAlltheway
15 | Eric L Gallardo | 3 | 10155570711291509_10155570759041509 | You shallow people. All Trump did was expose (bring to the surface) the dirty media, Crooked politicians and divisive hatred that poor democratic policy has created.
16 | Catherine Hawkins | 1 | 10155570711291509_10155570825316509 | This video should really be taken down and the promotion of the damaging of historic headstones needs to be stopped. I understand and appreciate the sentiment, but if you respect her don't damage her headstone.
17 | Marwana Suleiman | 4 | 10155570711291509_10155570720376509 | Thanks to the Republicans who fight for women's right to vote. Don't argue with me. I got it from watching the movie 'Hillary's America' üëç
18 | Landon McClelland | 1 | 10155570711291509_10155570871351509 | I would trust Peewee Herman sitting behind me in a movie theater while on a date with OJ Simpson, drinking at Bill Cosby's bar with Flint Michigan ice cubes after taking an elevator ride with Ray Rice all while Casey Anthony babysat for me before I would ever vote for the corrupt, liar Hillary Clinton! #draintheswamp #trump2016
19 | Elizabeth Lewis | 1 | 10155570711291509_10155570743496509 | Standing in front of a U.N. conference and declaring that ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs rights are human rights‚Äù was more controversial than it sounds today. Many within the U.S. government didn‚Äôt want Hillary to go to Beijing. Others wanted her to pick a less polarizing topic (you say polarizing, we say half the population). But Hillary was determined to speak out about human rights abuses, and her message became a rallying cry for a generation
20 | David Schryver | 0 | 10155570711291509_10155570793366509 | 10 QUESTIONS for HILLARY:(1). "When you left the White House after your husband‚Äôs last term as president, why did you steal $200,000.00 worth of furniture, china, and artwork? And why did you tell the public that you ‚Äòreturned it‚Äô when you only brought back $27,000 of it? (2). Mrs. Clinton, when you were Secretary of State, why did you solicit contributions from foreign governments, (muslim princes donated multi-millions and got favors in return) for the Clinton Foundation after you promised President Obama you would not? (3). Mrs. Clinton, why do you and your husband claim to contribute millions of dollars to charity for a tax write off when it goes directly into your Clinton Foundation which only gives out 10% of the funds to charitable purposes and you pocket the balance to support yourself tax free? What does your daughter Chelsea do there for her 3 million dollar yearly salary? (4). Mrs. Clinton, why are you unable to account for 6 billion dollars of State department funds that seem to have disappeared while you were Secretary of State? (5). Mrs. Clinton why did you say you were broke when you left the White House, but purchased a 5 million home, built an addition for the secret service, and charge the tax payers of the United States $15,000.00 a month for their rent, an amount that pays your the entire mortgage? (6). Mrs. Clinton why did you lie to the American people about the terrorist attack in Benghazi, but managed to tell the truth to your daughter that same night it happened? (7). Mrs Clinton were you and your husband disbarred from practicing law? Answer: In 1996, Landmark Legal Foundation filed a complaint asking the court to disbar Hillary Clinton for violating the Arkansas code of conduct, (which requires lawyers to act with honesty and integrity) for her actions in the Whitewater scandal cover up. Hillary‚Äôs law license was suspended in 2002 for failing to complete her continuing legal education requirements. Bill Clinton was convicted by a grand jury for perjury and obstruction of justice to which he was impeached by the House of Representatives and disbarred from practicing as an attorney. He has been accused by a dozens of women for rape, sexual assault and sexual harassment. He settled out of court for $850.000 in one case. Hillary has him out on her campaign trail championing for her theme of feminism and "women's rights". What a blasphemy. Neither one has enough integrity to hold onto a law license. (8). Mrs Clinton, why did you say, ‚ÄúI do not recall,‚Äù ‚ÄúI have no recollection,‚Äù and ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù 56 times while testifying under oath during the Starr investigations.(9). Mrs Clinton, what Really happened to Ron Brown when he was about to testify against you and your husband? (10). Mrs. Clinton what really happened to law partner Vince Foster? No way he committed suicide.

22 | Pam Dreading Sylvester | 0 | 10155570711291509_10155570849301509 | I feel sure she didn't want anyone, especially women, to vote for the most corrupt, vile, evil candidate to ever run for an elected office!
23 | Kristen Copeland | 0 | 10155570711291509_10155570918186509 | There is a movie Iron Jawed Angels that show what women went through to get the right to vote. Every woman should watch it and believe me you will always vote after that.
24 | Tony N Buffy Cline | 0 | 10155570711291509_10155570737026509 | Yea cast her vote illegally just like some of the illegal immigrants will becasting theirs for Clinton!! üò°
25 | Michael Wirz | 0 | 10155570711291509_10155570797016509 | Oh in that case forget voting just give her the presidency, have four years of more garbage, then we can all feel better about ourselves. Only after that should we get a president for the people.

2 | Todd K McCollum | 281 | 10155570623186509_10155570631721509 | IF Hillary was really leading like you say she is...... She wouldn't be campaigning in Person anywhere, her surrogates would be. She wouldn't need big name celebrities to draw crowds to her events. She would be able to do that on her own, but she can't & do you know why?? She's losing & losing BIG, nobody want to listen to her speak.

13 | Carla Mcclure Lehman | 5 | 10155570623186509_1811787459045298 | I read today where CNN  asked the Democratic National Committee  for questions to give Wolf Blitzer for an interview he was doing with Donald Trump. I mean, really? What has happened to journalism? I remember growing up watching the News, you didn't have this kind of bias that I'm seeing on tv today. Its truly disheartening, that this Political election has by far, been one of the most unfair/corrupt elections I've ever witnessed.

Not trying to sound as a hypocrite, because what man does'nt have weaknesses seeing a woman in her sexuality, but I see it for what it is and I don't want The Most High to view me as a pervert. The world is overrun with those...

She is evil, and she hates people like you and me.

This IKEA transports its customers to the dismal reality of a Syrian home
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Jose Alarcon | 82 | 10155570464986509_10155570491641509 | Here comes the trump base to complain about ikea conspiracy to sway the election, and wars are good, and screw Syria, and deport refugees, and make bombs, and Hillary death squads and Benghazi, !!!...while blaming CNN for been bias, too factual and not reporting that Obama smells like the devil and don't touch my guns and God knows what!! üòÇüòÇ
2 | Brian Powers | 81 | 10155570464986509_10155570481741509 | Clinton will take us to WW3 with nuclear Russia. Her no fly zone is reckless and dangerous. Putin is not going to just cease air ops and pack up and go home...don't be fooled by the media. A Clinton vote is a vote for world war.
3 | Sheri Faye Sherman | 29 | 10155570464986509_10155570566831509 | To all the people here complaining about US first etc remember that IKEA is not an American company and the Syrian crisis is a global concern. We are all part of that global community and compassion, no matter where it comes from, is a good thing for all of us.
4 | Candice Quinn | 5 | 10155570464986509_10155570539326509 | Finally, someone spoke the truth - this morning - Dan Rather interview - said that trump is where he is because the mainstream media did not call him out, at the very beginning of his rants, for his lying, flip-flopping, bigotry, misogyny, etc etc, and continually point out that as much as one may endorse someone saying what is on their minds,  trump's mind has been revealed as chaotic, delusional, narcissisistic, and likely Asperger's syndrome is one of his afflictions -the media did not do its job of due diligence, and investigative reporting - so we have had to endure the embarrassment,and the danger of this lunatic
5 | Jeno Anthony Horvath | 3 | 10155570464986509_10155570788166509 | Really? And tell me how I should feel. It's not like I will pay for another Syrian family to be here. I feel bad for them that they are living in a war zone. But come on IKEA, tell me what you want us to do.
6 | David Buckingham | 14 | 10155570464986509_10155570473926509 | What's the point in this? Many Americans just don't care. They're desensitized to this type of horror. Many actually believe it's deserved. They may not laugh at their plights, but they will laugh before they will cry.
7 | Fred LC | 7 | 10155570464986509_10155570471881509 | All the more reason to go to war with Syria and Russia to save those poor people! That is Hillary's plan and it sounds so amazing and historic. #ImWithHer #DraftOurDaughters
8 | Austin Reid | 11 | 10155570464986509_10155570470396509 | Under a president Clinton or Trump, they wouldn't have this issue. Hell, after the drones hit they won't have anything left to worry about. #JohnsonWeld2016
9 | Susan Parks Boutilier | 0 | 10155570464986509_10155570747381509 | Did Ikea ever do what some kids home`s look like in your southern states ,from what I seen on History and PBS documentary `s this looks quite livable compared to their`s.
10 | Harold Hull | 0 | 10155570464986509_10155570922386509 | Bill Clinton cheats on his wife. Impeach him. Trump proudly brags about sexual assault (and has cheated on his wives). Elect him. Hillary oversaw the department of state while 4 people died in an embassy attack. Put her in jail. 2 Republicans were in office while over 200 people died in embassy attacks. No problem. Immigrants don't pay taxes. Round them up and kick them out. Trump doesn't pay taxes. He's a business genius. Hillary's foundation only spent 87% of their donations helping people. She's a crook. Trumps foundation paid off his debts, bought sculptures of him, and made political donations to avoid investigations while using less than 5% of funds for charity (and he got shut down by NY State). So savvy... Put him in the white house. Trump made 4 billion dollars in 40 years, when an index fund started at the same time with the same "small loans" he received would be worth $12 billion today... without a trail of bankruptcies, thousands of lawsuits and burned small business owners. He's a real business whiz. Hillary took a loss of $700k. She's a criminal. Trump is the first candidate in the modern era not to release his tax returns, and took a billion dollar loss in 1 year. Genius. Hillary takes responsibility for private email servers and apologizes. Not credible. Trump denies saying things (on the record) he actually said (on the record), he's just telling it like it is.Your arguments are thin. Your ignorance of reality is shocking. Your double-standards are offensive, and your willingness to blindly support him and recycle the rhetoric is absurd. Your opinion is not fact. Your memes are not news articles. And your hypocrisy is not a platform.

15 | Andrew Keen | 3 | 10155570464986509_10155570525781509 | Under Obama, more people in poverty, more people on food stamps, lowest labor force participation rate since 1972, household median income is down, a GDP growth under 2%, ISIS was able to flourish, NOT one country can be identified to have better relations under Obama, the National Debt has DOUBLED under Obama, race relations are at an all-time low etc. etc. O, wait, Obama does hold the record for most reality show appearances by a sitting President!

Flint still has a  water crisis. You just don't hear about it on the news anymore. And there are probably 500 other communities one broken pipe away from the same thing. But sure, lets send billions to Syria....
20 | Shel Marie | 0 | 10155570464986509_10155570491856509 | #StopFukishima #CleantheOcean #JillStein for PresidentThe ocean's acidification levels are rising exponentially. The WWF just released their report for 2016 that scientists predict if we continue on the path of developing fossil fuels - sea life and wildlife will decline rapidly by the year 2020. Coastal communities will no longer be able to sustain themselves or depend on sea life for food. The Kuskokwim river in Alaska was suspended from commercial fishing this summer because no one is buying fish. Reports of sea life having boils and other deformities are affecting those who depend on it for subsistence. Schools need to recruit students and focus their efforts on stopping Fukishima from spilling more radiation in the ocean. It's evident Japan will not or cannot contain it alone. As long as radiation levels increase in the oceans, it will be pulled up in the clouds - rain on our mountains that lead to our rivers and streams; rain on our livestock and crops making food from the inland unsuitable to eat; and it will devastate the global landscape by killing trees we need for oxygen.Mankind cannot ignore the effects of Fukishima any longer. This will become of major national interest before most people know or are prepared.
21 | Margaret Aikens | 1 | 10155570464986509_10155570612326509 | Ikea is a million dollar international giant of a company. They have the resources to build numerous houses for these people. Why don't they? Oprahs done things like that... wealthy individuals do it all the time. Greta Susteren built a school and homes! Come on Ikea. You can do more than talk...

24 | Jeff Hanson | 2 | 10155570464986509_10155570513236509 | Only the  ignorant can support this Pathological LIAR and  corrupt woman! She Belongs in Federal Prison already!!The 25 things that are truly important about Hillary instead of this left wing fluff:1. When did she know her husband was a serial abuser, and does she feel guilty for destroying his accusers?2. Explain precisely the trades made in the Cattle Futures scandal where $1,000 was turned into $99,000 in a matter of weeks?3. Why didn't she do anything to protect the Americans in Benghazi?4. Who is Saul Alinsky and why was he her mentor?5. When she was working on Watergate, why did her boss Zeifman, a lifelong Democrat, call Hillary a ‚Äúliar‚Äù and ‚Äúan unethical, dishonest lawyer‚Äù and have her fired?6. What really happened with Travelgate?7. What really happened with the Rose Law Firm?8. What really happened with WhiteWater?9. What gave Hillary the right to see private FBI files of her political enemies in FileGate?10. Why won't she turn over her illegal server with state department e-mails to congress?11. Why does your foundation accept money from avowed terror states?12. What is her take on the Vince Foster "Suicide"?13. Why did she think she was entitled to steal the White House furniture when she left?14. Why do you lie even about things that mean nothing: lying about being under sniper fire in Bosnia, lying about being named after Sir Edmund Hillary, or lying that your grandparents were immigrants.15. Should America be concerned that in ChinaGate, the 22 people that were convicted of fraud or for funneling Asian funds into the DNC were associates of Bill Clinton?16. Did selling stays at the Lincoln Bedroom to political donors make you feel like a wh)o(re?17. Does Hillary think Juanita Broadrick lied when she said on national news that Bill Clinton raped her?18. Is she still okay that Bill goes to pedophile island with Jeff Epstein?19. Why are there so many murdered and suicided people in the Clinton's immediate circle?20. Doesn't the fact that the Clinton Foundation has to amend 5 years of its tax returns for improper reporting imply that you were involved in an illegal RICO enterprise?21. Doesn't approving the Russian-owned Uranium One deal as secretary of state--because of illegal contributions to your foundation--in fact make you a traitor to this country?22. Was it wise to have at least four Clinton Foundation board of directors that have either been convicted or charged of the financial crimes of bribery and fraud?23. Why, Hillary, did you pay your female senate staffers 72% of what you paid your male staffers?24. When you represented an accused pedophile rapist, why did you laugh when you got him off even though you believed him to be guilty?25. She said she had one e-mail address, it came out that she had two; She said she had one device, it came out that she had two: She said none of her e-mails on her private server was classified, but when the State Dept handed over 300 e-mails the FBI redacted large sections of one, proving again she was wrong. Thus, Ms. Clinton, are you incompetent or just a congenital liar?Everyone should go on you tube and watch The Clinton Chronicles -- it will amaze you what a couple of psychopaths the Clintons really are!

5 | Humberto Sanchez | 24 | 10155570340566509_10155570361836509 | These Disgusting Individuals that tried to shift the race,,,Totally against the law.... all this when : Trump has been linked to the mafia many times over the years, with varying degrees of closeness. The Department of Justice sued Trump and his father Fred in 1973 for housing discrimination at 39 sites around New York. ‚ÄúThe government contended that Trump Management had refused to rent or negotiate rentals ‚Äòbecause of race and color...The Boston Globe‚Äôs Matt Viser reports on the mess of the American Dream pageant in 1992.....2005 video in which he boasted about sexually assaulting women‚Äî‚ÄúGrab them by the pussy. You can do anything,‚Äù he said, as well as ‚ÄúI just start kissing them. It‚Äôs like a magnet.......n 1981, Trump scooped up a building on Central Park South, reasoning that the existing structure was a dump, but the land it was on would be a great place for luxury condos. Trump‚Äôs problem was that the existing tenants were‚Äîunderstandably and predictably‚Äîunwilling to let go of their rent-controlled apartments on Central Park. Trump used every trick in the book to get them out. He tried to reverse exceptions the previous landlord had given to knock down walls, threatening eviction. ...Four times in his career, Trump‚Äôs companies have entered bankruptcy.....In the late 1980s, after insisting that his major qualification to build a new casino in Atlantic City was that he wouldn‚Äôt need to use junk bonds, Trump used junk bonds to build Trump Taj Mahal....A year later, another of Trump‚Äôs Atlantic City casinos, the Trump Plaza, went bust after losing more than $550 million.....Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts was $1.8 billion in debt. The company filed for bankruptcy and emerged as Trump Entertainment Resorts.....Trump Entertainment Resorts once again went bankrupt. Trump resigned from the board, but the company retained his name...hired 200 undocumented Polish workers to tear it down, paying them substandard wages for backbreaking work‚Äî$5 per hour, when they were paid at all......

7 | Stan Wilson | 16 | 10155570340566509_10155570476421509 | Imagine it is November 9, 2016 in America and we wake up knowing who our new President will be. If it is Hillary, think of the groups of people that will celebrate. Illegal Immigrants, criminals and future criminals who will be supported for pulling a gun on a police officer, planned parenthood, the media, and the list goes on and on that represent everything that is wrong with America. If you're still "with her," look around at who you'll be celebrating with.Now imagine waking up knowing that Trump is our new President. You may or may not like him, or really know what kind of president he will be. But here are some things you will know for sure:‚Ä¢ The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.‚Ä¢ The media has been neutered forever.‚Ä¢ Career politicians will have lost all job security.‚Ä¢ The guns in your home will safely stay there.‚Ä¢ Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.‚Ä¢ Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally‚Ä¢ Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.‚Ä¢ No more apologies to the world for being great!‚Ä¢ Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.‚Ä¢ Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.‚Ä¢ There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.‚Ä¢ The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.‚Ä¢ The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.Copy and paste this as your status if you support and will vote Donald Trump for president 2016.

Exterminate the black race because they are like "weeds". (Margaret Sanger quote) Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.üëÅ‚ö†If you are a Christian, Why are you voting for Hillary Clinton when she wrote her Senior thesis on Saul Alinsky who dedicated his book 'Rules for Radicals' to Lucifer (the Devil)? She says he was, and still is her mentor.üëÅ‚ö†If you are a Veteran, in the Military, or closely related to a Military member, Why are you voting for Hillary when she left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again? They called for help but the help was told to stand down.üëÅ‚ö†If you have a factory job, Why are you voting for Hillary when she supported TPP? Factory workers are being laid off because jobs are going over seas. Don't forget the deals she's made with china. She also welcomes open borders and illegals to get benefits to be paid with Your tax money.üëÅ‚ö†If you are poor, Why are you voting for Hillary, when she is supporting Wall street and all the big banks? Big banks keep poor people poor by destroying the poor man's credit by allowing medical bills and collections to affect your credit scores so you can pay higher interest rates than the rich; Taking much of the little money you earn.üëÅ‚ö†If you are a Woman, how can you vote for Hillary when she has buried all of Bills rape victims under the rug, including that little girl that was raped? Lawyer Hillary defended the rapist, and then she laughed about it later, knowing that he was guilty.If you carry a gun, or believe in the Constitution; How can you vote for Hillary when she wants to eliminate the NRA, Take your guns, and abolish the second Amendment?üëÅ‚ö†If you breathe, Why would you vote for Hillary when she and the Clinton crime family have left a trail of dead people that did not agree with her, or they knew too much?Who is left? üëÅ VOTE TRUMP!!!

21 | Sean Ryan Culligan | 1 | 10155570340566509_10155570664191509 | This will be my one and only major statement about this current 2016 election that I hope everyone will at least read. I'm not Pro-Trump or Pro Hilary. I voted for Bernie Sanders because I believed in what he stood for even though his views on socialism aren't exactly what I was hoping for. You can defriend me if need be, but this needs to shared and this needs to be said.But the point I'm want to make here is this: I hope everyone who's going to vote really understands what is at stake here. No matter who wins with maybe the exception of Johnson or Stein.... the country is screwed.Trump is a sexist, misogynistic, hate filled racist who does not have a filter on his puke spewing mouth of his. He has little to no real business sense with the exception of knowing how to skit the tax laws with his multiple bankruptcies, not paying taxes for over a decade and quite frankly being out of touch with how the system works. His only saving grace is that he's not or has been in multiple federal investigations (that 13 year old girl who accused him of rape retracted her statement and it was found to be untruthful)Hilary Clinton is the epitome of evil and corruption. She and Bill have been getting away with crimes for well over thirty years and thankfully we have Wikileaks here to expose them for us. It does not matter where this information is coming from; Wikileaks could be getting their information from Russia, Santa, Aliens, my cat... anyone! As long as it's all true and vetted to be true, why does it matter WTF the info is coming from! The fact that people in the DNC have resigned over this and that NONE of this information is being denounced or proven to be false is another thing.Clinton has four... count them... four ONGOING investigations right now, this doesn't count the one that they just re-opened the current one (which hasn't been officially closed by the FBI mind you, so it can still be re-re-opened if need be)If Clinton becomes President elect or even President, there will be continuing and ongoing scandals that she is currently in and they are as follows:1) Impeachment from the Republicans due to her lying under oath from the Benghazi hearings proven by Wikileaks and her own emails - this is Perjury. 2) Dallas IRS investigation over the Clinton Foundation wither or not it was ran as a charity or not. HUGE Legal issues with the IRS here over the tax status of Bill and his daughter3) FBI investigation ongoing Clinton Foundation about five countries hacking into her servers4)Clinton broke Super PAC laws of coordinating with John Podesta to work hand in hand with the PACS to collect money for her campaign. You can not DIRECTLY or any why work with your own Super PAC. It is illegal.Once again. I'm not Pro-Trump nor Clinton. But can't any of you see the problems we might in the foreseeable future. This has nothing to do with her being a female, so please all of you feminazis and feminists can back off. This simply comes down to her scandals outweighs the non scandal riddled Trump. She might not even be our President if ANY of these investigations happen to stick to her. The FBI is in her pocket because she has broken Freedom of Information laws and yes, she did break the Espionage Act.America.... please don't elect a criminal to be the President. That server that was hacked will be moving in with her and we all know how well that worked out.
22 | Erin McCarthy Freiberger | 0 | 10155570340566509_10155570721786509 | If Trump wins tomorrow, which he may, Hillary can divide the blame evenly between the flagrantly biased press coverage she paid for and her idiot campaign manager who told her it was a good idea for a Clinton to wage an integrity war against someone.
23 | Michael Odion Enabulele | 0 | 10155570340566509_10155570833946509 | Bill Clinton cheats on his wife. Impeach him. Trump proudly brags about sexual assault (and has cheated on his wives). Elect him. Hillary oversaw the department of state while 4 people died in an embassy attack. Put her in jail. 2 Republicans were in office while over 200 people died in embassy attacks. No problem. Immigrants don't pay taxes. Round them up and kick them out. Trump doesn't pay taxes. He's a business genius. Hillary's foundation only spent 87% of their donations helping people. She's a crook. Trumps foundation paid off his debts, bought sculptures of him, and made political donations to avoid investigations while using less than 5% of funds for charity (and he got shut down by NY State). So savvy... Put him in the white house. Trump made 4 billion dollars in 40 years, when an index fund started at the same time with the same "small loans" he received would be worth $12 billion today... without a trail of bankruptcies, thousands of lawsuits and burned small business owners. He's a real business whiz. Hillary took a loss of $700k. She's a criminal. Trump is the first candidate in the modern era not to release his tax returns, and took a billion dollar loss in 1 year. Genius. Hillary takes responsibility for private email servers and apologizes. Not credible. Trump denies saying things (on the record) he actually said (on the record), he's just telling it like it is. Your arguments are thin. Your ignorance of reality is shocking. Your double-standards are offensive, and your willingness to blindly support him and recycle the rhetoric is absurd. Your opinion is not fact. Your memes are not news articles. And your hypocrisy is not a platform.

"I cast my vote against Donald J. Trump. I did it without joy or enthusiasm. I did it out of civic duty and love for our country," writes lifelong Republican Ana Navarro for CNN Opinion

1 | Douglas Vogt | 4970 | 10155570241116509_10155570262896509 | Anna is one of my favorite CNN commentators. Sorry you didn't have a worthy Republican to vote for, but thanks for putting party aside and doing what is best for your country.
2 | Ernso T√®rogene | 2495 | 10155570241116509_10155570243566509 | I love coming here to read the comments. Some people (like myself at times) are obsessed with reading comments. For example, we find you reading this comment right now, which does not contain any useful information, only curiosity, that drives you to waste your time. Have a good day.
3 | Mike Sadicario | 2417 | 10155570241116509_10155570251621509 | you love our country so much that your voting for a candidate that is backed by the people that fund ISIS ... And is hands down the most corrupt person to EVER run for the highest office.. LAUGHABLE
4 | Jenny Mora | 1411 | 10155570241116509_10155570248756509 | The Trump trolls will be throwing temper tantrums tomorrow when Trump is OUT üòÇ trying so hard üò≠ Poor things.üíôüíôüíô we are not fake votes, WE ARE REAL and we are voting. I'm with her.
5 | A.J. Pinto | 2103 | 10155570241116509_10155570242546509 | Don't believe the media...Hillary's poll numbers are falling faster than Bill Clinton's pants in an Arkansas trailer park...üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
6 | Quentin L Hayes | 716 | 10155570241116509_10155570259481509 | Finally a Republican with morals and values who saw through his B.S.. I would vote for you Ana because you are one of the few in your party who remains to have common sense still.
7 | Johnathan Hardcastle | 595 | 10155570241116509_10155570254251509 | Ana Navarro has been speaking out against Trump in a BIG way this entire election... I would argue that she is NOT a lifelong Republican. That's hilarious
8 | We stand with Israel | 687 | 10155570241116509_10155570259091509 | Here in Israel we support TRUMP! Obama was truly one of the worst presidents the United States ever had, Clinton will be the same.
9 | Bob Beaudreault | 299 | 10155570241116509_10155570253251509 | There is no spot on the ballot to cast a vote "against" anyone.......... YOU VOTED DEMOCRAT! Plain and simple...... live with it!
10 | David Day | 178 | 10155570241116509_10155570256366509 | Well my lifelong democrat wife voted for the Donald. Last CBS poll which had Hillary up by 2% had 8% dems voting Trump to 6% of Rep voting for Clinton.
11 | Lek Boonmo | 133 | 10155570241116509_10155570265346509 | Thank you Anna and all Hispanic voters for building a beautiful wall together to keep Trump out of the White House.
12 | Johnnie Lee Maynard | 89 | 10155570241116509_10155570247631509 | Clinton News Network, what the heck are you going to do come wednesday? I see a lot of people losing their jobs there as it seems all they do is look for someone to agree with you.
13 | Mike Smith | 41 | 10155570241116509_10155570251381509 | I'm voting for Gary Johnson! Screw this corrupt two party system! We need more options then two decades-long friends who just happen to be "against" each other.
14 | Carolyn Peterson | 58 | 10155570241116509_10155570274861509 | I hardly ever agree with Ana Navarro on policy matters but I have come to really respect her during this election cycle. She put our country ahead of party and it takes integrity and strength to do that in our polarized country.
15 | Susan Serota | 48 | 10155570241116509_10155570259476509 | There's a place for you on our side, Ana. I love you on CNN. You are one Republican I still respect and admire. Stay in the public eye after the election! You have many fans! Best,
16 | Crystal Jimenez | 48 | 10155570241116509_10155570270876509 | Fact: The Republican Party was founded primarily to oppose slavery, and Republicans eventually abolished slavery. The Democratic Party fought them and tried to maintain and expand slavery. The 13th Amendment, abolishing slavery, passed in 1865 with 100% Republican support but only 23% Democrat support in congress

18 | Zach Kerman | 60 | 10155570241116509_10155570245136509 | Hillary Clinton does not care about you or anyone else. She only answers to Corporate America and Wall Street. She is not your "champion". That being said, neither is Donald Trump. It's time to end the Two Party system that our fore fathers warned us about. They said it would be one of the worst things to happen to this great nation. Vote to audit the Federal Reserve, limit the powers of the CIA, and to bring the control of the government back to the people and not big business. United we stand, Divided we fall.
19 | Desiree Northend | 36 | 10155570241116509_10155570272546509 | I know that was difficult for you, but Thank you Ana Navarro for putting country above party. I've enjoyed your perspective this election season.
20 | Scott Battice | 30 | 10155570241116509_1148342811939774 | She may be a Republican but she is not a conservative. I will never vote for anybody that supports the dismembering and killing of unborn babies. Conservatives oppose abortion.
21 | Jose Alarcon | 45 | 10155570241116509_599553153589171 | My respect to Ana, I used to be a republican and eight years ago I became an independent and have voted democrat in the last two elections, the Republican Party abandoned me as a Hispanic, as a father, as an immigrant, as a Christian, and as an American. Fear, racism, bigotry and hate will not be the banners that I will subscribe to, no matter the party.
22 | Danilo Figueira Chaves | 36 | 10155570241116509_1178940518859679 | That woman is decent! And she can see the disaster of electing Mr. small Hands Trump, she is a republican like many other that knows the difference of racist, hateful and a bigot who want to divide this country in half and bring another war to the world! Good for You Ana Navarro! Thank u for not disappoint us and be a decent human being! Every other woman who is voting for Trump has no self respect! That's all!
23 | Lynn Molina | 36 | 10155570241116509_1590349991274780 | one thing this wack job election did was help me grow respect for republicans who had the spine to stand up for country over party. Ana's spine is rock solid and she is brilliant when up against the sheer stupidity of Trump's bimbo-bot talking bobble heads
24 | Derrick Burke | 33 | 10155570241116509_10155570251486509 | I will not cast a vote this election. I do not believe either candidate will significantly shape my life/well-being in the next four years. I know that is a selfish thing to say but I cannot in good conscience vote for Trump or Clinton. Maybe I will just vote third party....
25 | Elizabeth Ann | 43 | 10155570241116509_10155570275446509 | She's my hero. #CountryOverParty Speaker Paul Ryan and a host of other Republicans can take lessons on what it means to have courage and conviction.

"Was it talking or singing?" Donald J. Trump mocked hip-hop as he criticized the performance JAY Z and Beyonc√© delivered at a rally for Hillary Clinton
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | MiVoz MiEstilo MiFlow | 3609 | 10155570133316509_10155570138036509 | Trump is the WORST thing to ever happen to America. He has made people HATE again. He has divided a nation that will take forever to heal and he has done it through his racism, hate, and bigotry. He is a con a crook and sexual pervert that belongs behind bars.
2 | Stephen Sims | 1113 | 10155570133316509_10155570135521509 | Hillary Clinton does not care about you or anyone else. She only answers to Corporate America and Wall Street.

Vote to audit the Federal Reserve, limit the powers of the CIA, and to bring the control of the government back to the people and not big business. United we stand, Divided we fall. There's a reason they're diving us.(This is not an endorsement of Donald Trump. It's a refusal to endorse either candidate.)
3 | Brianna O'Brien | 845 | 10155570133316509_10155570145696509 | You realize everyone likes Jay Z and Beyonc√©, right? Like the MAJORITY of people like them as musicians and celebrities. That's why they're famous. So, here's a tip; when everyone else in the world disagrees with you, you're probably wrong.
4 | Cristina Vira Rio | 815 | 10155570133316509_10155570147581509 | He's such a racist fool... if Jay Z ran for President, he'd beat Donald in a heartbeat and Jay's companies are way more successful...just saying
5 | Shevanie Chin Townsend | 540 | 10155570133316509_10155570143701509 | Why is a wannabe president going after a rapper? Have some respect for yourself and cool your hot temper. He's just mad he don't have any celebrity supporting him. He's too angry without self control to be president.
6 | Zach Kerman | 231 | 10155570133316509_10155570134296509 | It will be over when Trump wins North Carolina. Just wait until you see the large influx of Trump supporters tomorrow who were too afraid to speak up this entire time in fear of being assaulted by 'tolerant Liberals'. I know the Globalist Liberals are going to hate hearing this, but starting tomorrow, its going to be #AMERICAFIRST
7 | Mark Senatore | 148 | 10155570133316509_10155570154691509 | Hillary and Michelle Obama were so shaken by Donald Trump's language but apparently have no problem with Jay Z and his filthy lyrics. Throw in Obama and you have the 3 biggest hypocrites in the world.
8 | Brandy Alderson | 126 | 10155570133316509_10155570153241509 | In his own words! Trump just made a "BIGLEY" mistake. Jay-Z & Beyonce are highly respected artists that are supported by a vast majority of American people from all walks of life!
9 | Liz Jensen | 57 | 10155570133316509_10155570156021509 | And this is news? 90% of people over the age of 40 feel the same way. Not going to offend me-different generations. Come on people lets care about stuff that actually matters! #Trump2016
10 | Juan Ramirez | 139 | 10155570133316509_10155570141456509 | Donald Trump all the way!!! Deport BLM supporters back to Africa and deport illegals back to Mexico and bring our jobs back!!!

12 | Brian Matthews | 54 | 10155570133316509_819281571547274 | Clintons paid 62 million to Jay Z and Beyonc√© to campaign for her . Trump pays no one and still has more of a turn out .
13 | L.S. Larsson | 34 | 10155570133316509_10155570148931509 | Brags about selling crack , tells you blacks are oppressed  but made millions from mostly white supporters, influences  segregation & I should vote for who he says to vote for ? Haaa
14 | Mara McMullen | 32 | 10155570133316509_819278124880952 | Why is everyone up in arms about Jay Z and Beyonc√© performing for Hillary Clinton? Who cares who gives their opinion on who to vote for. Ultimately, you have your own mind and can vote for who YOU want. Done.
15 | Shawn Paquette | 27 | 10155570133316509_10155570189431509 | I hate Trump but he's right about that bahahaha. Rap and hip hop = garbage. Nothing to do with racism. It takes no talent or skill. Oh, you can rhyme? Grats. Play an instrument.
16 | Emerson Williams | 17 | 10155570133316509_1768877946695914 | No he didn‚Äôt. He said they were singing or talking or something. He obviously don't listen to rap, the man is in his 70s. Stop believing every spin CNN puts out. By the way I am 30. I know about hip hop.
17 | Alex Daniels | 19 | 10155570133316509_623138624535436 | Believe it or not there are a lot of blacks that support Trump lol I know a good bit who's voting for him. This might be the one election where a bunch of minority's vote for someone "Trump" but lie to ppl who ask them if they voted for him or not. Its real easy to say to someone that you're voting for Clinton then change it once getting to that booth. Hillary will never have my vote George Bush care more about minority's than Hillary Clinton does. And she's crooked I'm gonna write in my vote this year just to exercise that right.
18 | Svetlana Borowka | 28 | 10155570133316509_10155570151231509 | In Europe today the newspaper are full about the consequence we have to face when Trump wins. Everybody agrees that it would be the biggest catastrophe for the USA since Vietnam. But sadly this Madman will drag the rest of the world as well in the pit. The USA lost all credibility during this election and the half of the country became a Hollywoodfarce. We all pity the rational Amercians who face the reign of Dagobert Duck on Viagra.
19 | John Plunk | 16 | 10155570133316509_10155570164151509 | I have to question the intelligence of anyone who bases decisions concerning politics, morals or life goals on the advice of a rapper. Rapper is the native american term for a person who can't sing or play an instrument.
20 | Brandon-Tonya Kerr | 15 | 10155570133316509_819281924880572 | I saw the speech live and he didn't "mock" anything or anybody!  CNN has been so biased in its coverage!  Here Hillary calls half of the electorate "a basket of deplorables" and Trump said he didn't know of if JayZ or Beyonce were "singing or talking" and CNN runs this coverage of Donald J. Trump?  It's no wonder "CNN Sucks!" has become a chant at his rallies.
21 | Kevin Robert | 22 | 10155570133316509_1225978300794456 | I actually watched the entire speech and not once did he "mock" anyone. He brought up the fact that Hillary needed celebrity endorsement to get people to her rallies but he absolutely did not mock hiphop you diluted, brainwashing, propaganda- filled news organization.
22 | Justin Cox | 7 | 10155570133316509_1225975310794755 | Never forget, Trump had Lil Jon on the Apprentice one season and the ONLY reason he got fired was because he "did not pass an interview" when the other two people in the competition were white! Of course he hates rap, and hates rappers!
23 | Betty Donovan | 16 | 10155570133316509_819277368214361 | He's such a MORON! I can't wait to see how he's going to deal with the fact that Hillary Clinton will be voted in as our next PRESIDENT. He should be thinking of that, more than being jealous, and slamming JAY Z, and Beyonce'. He's a real LUNATIC!!!!!!!
24 | Elvin Escobar | 5 | 10155570133316509_1226005937458359 | Most modern hip hop is talking with attitude. It's not rap so it doesn't even have to rhyme. With the exception of a chorus here and there there's no actual singing involved.
25 | Ebony Williams | 8 | 10155570133316509_819278691547562 | Mocking hip hip music is as close as he can get to saying the N word without actually saying it, and I also wonder if he'd say the same about Eminem or Vanilla Ice.Trump has turned from orange to a sour green jelly belly.

7 | Kirk Delson | 16 | 10155570011226509_10155570225871509 | As far as campaigning goes, Trump has outperformed Clinton as far as budgeting and stamina. Clinton has blown ridiculous amounts of lobbyists money and refuses to contribute her own cash towards the campaign. It's a joke. That's just a taste of how she's going to be running the country, spending and spending like Obama is doing now. Obama is blowing hundreds of thousands of tax payer dollars to campaign with Hilary instead of doing his job.
8 | Shawn Arkebauer | 35 | 10155570011226509_10155570041836509 | Americans and legal immigrants and veterans and border patrol and police and working people for Trump. Celebrity millionaires and millionaire Wall Street cronies and deadbeats and foreign donors for Clinton. Sorry, I do not have time to reply back to people that do not see this.
9 | Matthew Tanner Moore | 11 | 10155570011226509_10155570276981509 | If you think Hillary is a good choice or even a good person for that matter you have been watching to much CNN and not paying attention to the actual emails, transcripts and other documents that have been coming out. Also lets not forget she is still under investigation as part of the FBI investigations into the Clinton Foundation which includes a lot of the worse offenses including play to pay during her state department tenure and excepting "donations" from countries that support terrorism. Yes they have returned some of this money but that was only once it came out what's to keep her from doing this again as president.
10 | Arthur Todd Orey | 31 | 10155570011226509_10155570014931509 | Hillary and the establishment want totalitarianism, which is a political system in which the state recognizes no limits to its authority and strives to regulate every aspect of public and private life wherever feasible.Totalitarian regimes stay in political power through an all-encompassing propaganda campaign that is disseminated through the state-controlled mass media, a single party that is often marked by political repression, personality cultism, control over the economy, regulation and restriction of speech, mass surveillance, and widespread use of terror. A distinctive feature of totalitarian governments is an "elaborate ideology, a set of ideas that gives meaning and direction to the whole society.
11 | Dimas Jose Mou | 8 | 10155570011226509_10155570130181509 | Madam libya will never win this election legitimately.basket of irredeemable deplorables,super predators,and basement dwellers will not cast their votes for her.however,the whole democrats are out in numbers desperately campaigning for her to convince americans to vote for her.even Mr obama is campaigning tirelessly like he's the one vying to be a president.Americans,i'm behind you to take back your country from establishment.if you can overcome the Establishment and FEC in this election,then your votes will count for real. #voteoutcorruption.
12 | Connor Hartzog | 1 | 10155570011226509_1824971891080785 | Look, I would be happy if Trump won, but sometimes you just have to face the truth. The truth is that Hillary Clinton is our next president. Not all of us like it, but it's reality. Not everything can always go your way. Sometimes you just have to suck it up and move on.
13 | Richard Adebola-davids | 10 | 10155570011226509_10155570286066509 | Folks, make your votes count for America ... This is a battle for America, and despite his shortcomings, Trump is the one, who is aligned with the American people, very much unlike Hillary, who is all out there for no one, but herself and her crime partners/criminal accomplices! America will rise again with your support for Trump!! Now, it's a make or mar!!! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
14 | Tashi Delek | 4 | 10155570011226509_10155570228131509 | Time for outside monitors and foreign monitors to make sure no bus load of illegal voters come in after hours to vote. Keep watching those voting places until those ballots goes to the city hall or we have to call in the FBI
15 | Eileen McGovern | 5 | 10155570011226509_10155570048671509 | If the stocks went back up to 18,600 she would probably be a shoe in but with stocks still being down from its highest point it doesn't look good for her and the Obama Administration.
16 | Kimber Ly Watts | 2 | 10155570011226509_1824976774413630 | I think people are not thnking about how bad the RNC has messed up NC. We lost a lot of businesses to the RNC politics and bathroom laws.  I think the state will turn blue as companies are fleeing left and right.  I know that there were a lot of people in voting lines when Hillary and Obama were there, so I would not count out her yet.  The state must turn blue or the entire enonomy will collapse because companies refuse to come there or do business there.  People are feeling the pain of the job losses.
17 | Thomas Vescelius | 4 | 10155570011226509_10155570136521509 | What would be interesting is, if for nothing else than to give the DNC something to think about, that Connecticut might go Red. After five or more years of budgetary problems, a catastrophic plan called "Fast Trak" its time for a change. Therefore, I ask voters to vote Republican in Connecticut on Tuesday.  Take the gamble, what do we really have to lose? ;)
18 | Drew Weise | 0 | 10155570011226509_10155570234801509 | Fiscally liberal agendas will lead to a welfare state. Socially conservative agendas will lead to divisions among people and hate between different groups. I'm sticking with the party that is fiscally conservative and socially tolerant. Hopefully after the election, the millions of Republicans who disavow the party but still wants some fiscal responsibility and at the same time can handle having neighbors with different social values will join the libertarians
19 | Sean Ryan Culligan | 1 | 10155570011226509_559852397554380 | This will be my one and only major statement about this current 2016 election that I hope everyone will at least read. I'm not Pro-Trump or Pro Hilary. I voted for Bernie Sanders because I believed in what he stood for even though his views on socialism aren't exactly what I was hoping for. You can defriend me if need be, but this needs to shared and this needs to be said.But the point I'm want to make here is this: I hope everyone who's going to vote really understands what is at stake here. No matter who wins with maybe the exception of Johnson or Stein.... the country is screwed.Trump is a sexist, misogynistic, hate filled racist who does not have a filter on his puke spewing mouth of his. He has little to no real business sense with the exception of knowing how to skit the tax laws with his multiple bankruptcies, not paying taxes for over a decade and quite frankly being out of touch with how the system works. His only saving grace is that he's not or has been in multiple federal investigations (that 13 year old girl who accused him of rape retracted her statement and it was found to be untruthful)Hilary Clinton is the epitome of evil and corruption. She and Bill have been getting away with crimes for well over thirty years and thankfully we have Wikileaks here to expose them for us. It does not matter where this information is coming from; Wikileaks could be getting their information from Russia, Santa, Aliens, my cat... anyone! As long as it's all true and vetted to be true, why does it matter WTF the info is coming from! The fact that people in the DNC have resigned over this and that NONE of this information is being denounced or proven to be false is another thing.Clinton has four... count them... four ONGOING investigations right now, this doesn't count the one that they just re-opened the current one (which hasn't been officially closed by the FBI mind you, so it can still be re-re-opened if need be)If Clinton becomes President elect or even President, there will be continuing and ongoing scandals that she is currently in and they are as follows:1) Impeachment from the Republicans due to her lying under oath from the Benghazi hearings proven by Wikileaks and her own emails - this is Perjury. 2) Dallas IRS investigation over the Clinton Foundation wither or not it was ran as a charity or not. HUGE Legal issues with the IRS here over the tax status of Bill and her daughter3) FBI investigation ongoing Clinton Foundation about five countries hacking into her servers4)Clinton broke Super PAC laws of coordinating with John Podesta to work hand in hand with the PACS to collect money for her campaign. You can not DIRECTLY or any why work with your own Super PAC. It is illegal.Once again. I'm not Pro-Trump nor Clinton. But can't any of you see the problems we might in the foreseeable future. This has nothing to do with her being a female, so please all of you feminazis and feminists can back off. This simply comes down to her scandals outweighs the non scandal riddled Trump. She might not even be our President if ANY of these investigations happen to stick to her. The FBI is in her pocket because she has broken Freedom of Information laws and yes, she did break the Espionage Act.America.... please don't elect a criminal to be the President. That server that was hacked will be moving in with her and we all know how well that worked out.
20 | Michael Odion Enabulele | 1 | 10155570011226509_559870337552586 | Bill Clinton cheats on his wife. Impeach him. Trump proudly brags about sexual assault (and has cheated on his wives). Elect him. Hillary oversaw the department of state while 4 people died in an embassy attack. Put her in jail. 2 Republicans were in office while over 200 people died in embassy attacks. No problem. Immigrants don't pay taxes. Round them up and kick them out. Trump doesn't pay taxes. He's a business genius. Hillary's foundation only spent 87% of their donations helping people. She's a crook. Trumps foundation paid off his debts, bought sculptures of him, and made political donations to avoid investigations while using less than 5% of funds for charity (and he got shut down by NY State). So savvy... Put him in the white house. Trump made 4 billion dollars in 40 years, when an index fund started at the same time with the same "small loans" he received would be worth $12 billion today... without a trail of bankruptcies, thousands of lawsuits and burned small business owners. He's a real business whiz. Hillary took a loss of $700k. She's a criminal. Trump is the first candidate in the modern era not to release his tax returns, and took a billion dollar loss in 1 year. Genius. Hillary takes responsibility for private email servers and apologizes. Not credible. Trump denies saying things (on the record) he actually said (on the record), he's just telling it like it is. Your arguments are thin. Your ignorance of reality is shocking. Your double-standards are offensive, and your willingness to blindly support him and recycle the rhetoric is absurd. Your opinion is not fact. Your memes are not news articles. And your hypocrisy is not a platform.
21 | Ebele Ozomma Nwaokobia | 5 | 10155570011226509_10155570095056509 | Stop comparing Obama and Hillary. ..She can never match the kind of support Obama got!!Mitt Romney isn't as devious and a master manipulator like Trump..so yeah he will outperform him.
22 | Larry Denenberg | 9 | 10155570011226509_10155570100186509 | Don't understand anyone over 65 voting Trump. He will totally bankrupt social security, and leave us hanging while he sits on his golden toilet throne.
23 | Lastavius Darby | 3 | 10155570011226509_10155570053556509 | A political party should not try to do the job of the Holy Spirit. Period! If God doesn't force himself on people... then a party shouldn't try to force God on people. If you don't like gay marriage ... then don't get gay married. If you don't like abortion... then don't have one. If you hate green eggs and ham... then don't eat it. We have to learn to respect others with whom we disagree. My wife had an ectopic pregnancy and because we live in republican controlled  Alabama... we had to jump through hoops just to have the unviable pregnancy removed because it is considered abortion. There was no way the baby (cells... at this point) would live and my wife was in horrendous amounts of pain. We were given the run around but thankfully we finally found a doctor  willing to help. We were told she was mere hours from death. Republicans don't consider the circumstances like rape, incest, or the health of the mother. They want all kids here but  when they are... Republicans try to cut social programs like food stamps and Medicaid that help families to stay afloat. Vote Democratic up and down the ticket because our families depend on it!
24 | Terrance Talley | 9 | 10155570011226509_10155570102501509 | She has lagged in African american votes but Latinos (whom Trump has insulted for 14 months) are SKY HIGH in voting......report it all CNN.
25 | Brenda Swan | 0 | 10155570011226509_1824993167745324 | Gee. It only took how many voter suppression techniques to give Trump a little push.

Exterminate the black race because they are like "weeds". (Margaret Sanger quote) Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.üëÅ‚ö†If you are a Christian, Why are you voting for Hillary Clinton when she wrote her Senior thesis on Saul Alinsky who dedicated his book 'Rules for Radicals' to Lucifer (the Devil)? She says he was, and still is her mentor.üëÅ‚ö†If you are a Veteran, in the Military, or closely related to a Military member, Why are you voting for Hillary when she left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again? They called for help but the help was told to stand down.üëÅ‚ö†If you have a factory job, Why are you voting for Hillary when she supported TPP? Factory workers are being laid off because jobs are going over seas. Don't forget the deals she's made with china.

5 | Thasin Sardar | 25 | 10155569872786509_10155569925946509 | Nice work Arwa ! Unlike the 2003 invasion's embedded reporters doing their bidding for the US Mil, in this case you thrust yourself on to the front lines. Mad respect for your fearless journalism.
6 | Joseph Joey Velez | 20 | 10155569872786509_556348807893988 | You guys need to understand. There will be always war, no matter which president is elected. Only difference will be how they can handle such situation.
7 | Gloria Rodriguez | 21 | 10155569872786509_10155569933501509 | Bush should have never got us involved in this war. The Bush administration caused all this mess, that has left this horrible circumstances. Prayers to all who are suffering from this.

2 | Luke Thompson | 423 | 10155569799011509_10155569820046509 | When I hear news reporters anymore all I hear is, "Hi, I'm a news reporter for CNN and my pathetic occupation requires me to be biased and brain dead. My profession is nothing more than a mouthpiece for the corporation I work for and the declining party I represent." (It's not only CNN but all of journalism)
3 | Zach Kerman | 145 | 10155569799011509_10155569802176509 | Michelle Obama said if Donald Trump is elected: "We're telling our sons it's okay to humiliate women. We're telling our daughters this is how they deserve to be treated.".... that's funny. So does that mean that if Hillary Clinton is elected, we are teaching our sons & daughters that it's ok to murder, lie, cover up, be corrupt, demean women, use racial slurs, and stay with a spouse that openly rapes women & cheats on you?
4 | Wanda Jewel Taylor | 62 | 10155569799011509_10155569816846509 | And cnn thinks this is newsworthy. How ridiculous can you get? But as usual, they make a non story into a big deal. What is wrong with these little people.
5 | Mel JV | 45 | 10155569799011509_10155569820951509 | Yes I copied it and pasted this from the NY Times because it's amazing. I simply cannot wrap my head around how others with level heads and sound minds can even consider Trump for president of this country and leader of the free world. The logic simply escapes me. I try to view it through the lens of economic anxiety, diminished economic mobility and global pressure. It all seems understandable, but then I‚Äôm reminded of Donald Trump, a billionaire whose businesses have on more than one occasion gone bankrupt, who stiffed contractors, who outsources the making of many of his products and who brags about not paying federal income taxes. All of which brings me back to: Are you kidding me? I try to view it through a purely ideological lens in which people simply tend to vote for the party nominee. It makes sense, but then I‚Äôm reminded of Donald Trump, a man who isn‚Äôt really an ideologue but a demagogue interested only in self-aggrandizement. And again I return to: You‚Äôre kidding, right? Donald Trump, who is dragging traditional conservative paternalism into the muck of perversion, who brags about sexually assaulting women, who makes fun of the disabled, who savors a lust for vengeance, who says he has never needed to seek forgiveness, even from God. Again, are you kidding? I try to think of it from a strict constitutionalist‚Äôs perspective, to understand how strongly they want the vacancy on the Supreme Court to be filled by a constitutional purist. But then I think of Trump, whose Muslim ban would fly in the face of the Constitution, whose threats to the press strike me as constitutionally hostile, whose advancement of torture would seem to me constitutionally questionable (to say nothing of its legality in the face of international norms and treaties). Are you kidding, America? I try to think of it in terms of weariness with Washington and with D.C. insiders, the Clintons in particular, and dynastic democracy in general. I try to think of the intense Clinton distrust and even hatred that exists in some quarters, sentiments only exacerbated by things like this never-ending email saga. But then I hit Donald Trump, a real estate scion who has been sued nearly 1,500 times and is currently being sued for Trump University deceptions and the rape of a 13-year-old girl. You have got to be kidding. There is no way to make this make sense. Believe me, I‚Äôve tried. Donald Trump is a bigot. Donald Trump is a demagogue. Donald Trump is a sexist, misogynist, chauvinist pig. Donald Trump is a bully. Donald Trump is a cheat. Donald Trump is a pathological liar. Donald Trump is a nativist. Donald Trump‚Äôs campaign has proved too attractive to anti-Semites, Nazis and white nationalists, and on some level the campaign seems to be tacitly courting that constituency. Donald Trump ‚Äî judging by his own words on that disgusting tape and if you believe the dozen-plus women who have come forward to accuse him of some form of sexual assault or unwanted sexual advance ‚Äî is an unrepentant predator. To put it more succinctly, Donald Trump is a lowlife degenerate with the temperament of a 10-year-old and the moral compass of a severely wayward teen. There is no way to make a vote for him feel like an act of principle or responsibility. You can‚Äôt make it right. You can‚Äôt say yes to Trump and yes to common decency. Those two things do not together abide. If you are voting for Trump, you are voting for coarseness, corruption and moral corrosion. Period. And if you are not actively voting against him, you are abetting his attempt to hijack American greatness and sink it with his egotism. On Election Day, America faces a choice, and it‚Äôs not a tough one, but a stark one. It is the difference between tolerance and intolerance. It is the difference between respect and disrespect. It is the difference between a politician with some flaws and a flaw threatening our politics. Donald Trump is America‚Äôs existential threat. On Tuesday, America has an opportunity to defend itself.
6 | Douglas Cervantes | 33 | 10155569799011509_10155569904431509 | So it turns out Trump contributed 56 million to his own election.  The heavy majority of those funds were used to pay various Trump companies for inflated costs of services they provided.  So Trump is profiting on his own donation that he gets to deduct.  This pretty much sums up how Trump screws America and why he is a loser.
7 | Jackie Headlee | 13 | 10155569799011509_10155569886591509 | Donald Trump has to win electoral votes in Florida we know you can do it we can't survive another 4 years of Obama Clinton administration Obama care bankrupt our companies jobs moving to other countries economic safety our military is so weak the United States is so in debt to China they own us we could never pay them all we have borrowed and other countries we have borrowed from. We can not make smart intelligent business change in America without Trump for president you have to win electoral votes the people have to vote for you or we are screwed good luck God Bless you I pray üôè‚úùÔ∏è you win this election Hillary has sent bus loads of Black African Americans into Florida to vote she uses White women Latinos Black disabled she lies you have always hired all to build and work in your companies she can not run this country will be a 4 year disaster I strongly among others think the American people if you don't win will over throw the government because the Clintons are multi million Aires such liars so corrupt like mafia pay buy their way their votes criminals we will have a mess if she with illegal votes wins this election we can only pray that you will win electoral votes majority votes Election Day News Media states you have to win Florida or it is over I pray not among many Americans you are the only one that can make America strong and great again

That's really funny. Tune-In to Fox News Channel if you want to hear right-wing conspiracies and lies. On CNN they report REAL NEWS.
9 | Stephen Lewis | 13 | 10155569799011509_10155569876991509 | With all the last-minute campaigning that Mr. Trump is doing, all you potzers can think of to cover is 21 seconds of nonsense? You people are guilty of professional dereliction.
10 | David Harrington | 37 | 10155569799011509_10155569803221509 | WikiLeaks: DNC and CNN colluded on questions for Trump, Cruz
11 | Rebecca Gervasi | 5 | 10155569799011509_1598687213761356 | Watch the video Juliann Assange put out from Ecuador yesterday. He is the founder of WikiLinks. He talks about the fact that Donald Trump is a common person and does not come from old money. The people in the United states are divided about who should be president. Under the last president we lost 40,000 factories of each factory had thousands of employees, all these people lost their job and left millions of Americans out of work. Our country has been putting regulations on people who own businesses to the point where the business cannot make any money trying to produce a product here in the United States, as a result, many American businesses moved away to places like China or Thailand, and moved their technical support services to India or Pakistan. Americans are left with no jobs or a way to support themselves so they wanted a change. They were hoping that Donald Trump would be that change. He could do better in business negotiations with foreign countries, maybe he could help bring some factories back to the millions of people in America who lost their jobs. The wall is a symbol of trying to keep out the drug cartel . Violence in America has gotten really bad, Americans are tired of the murders. There is a gang in the nearby town, Santa Maria, the drug cartel murder people in that town every month. The wall will slow down the drug trafficking between Mexico and the United States. The drug issue here is the worst I have ever seen it and we are watching as our children over dose on Heroin that is brought in through Mexico. The drug cartel needs to stop killing our children through violence and drugs. That is what the wall is about. Social media will continue to make fun of both candidates. That's what they do, the election will be close, the elite ruling class (Clinton) or the hard working American who made his way through the American dream that hard work pays off (Donald Trump). We will see. This election is very close, like watching a football gameIf you want a free market, vote Republican.
12 | Nikhil Saha | 9 | 10155569799011509_10155569877686509 | Mr. Trump should buy about an hour prime time on national TV and address for the nation on today, 11/07/2016, this is a one life time opportunity for him and America. He will have a landslide like Reagan.
13 | Debbie Reed Ramey | 8 | 10155569799011509_10155569853091509 | A few moments ago a live broadcast was done by CNN where a reporter was in the room where paper ballots were being counted. The state of Ga had a press conference this morning & plainly said the certified people counting paper ballots are in a room, no cell phone or communication with the outside world. Why then is a reporter for CNN  in a room with ballots. She had no business there. People wonder why Trump made the comment he did at the last debate about accepting the results for a reason.
14 | Jennifer Lenell Small | 2 | 10155569799011509_10155570036501509 | Gosh... look at what they are reporting for network ratings!! üòÇüòÇüòÇCNN did not have plenty to be thankful for last month, having plunged 44 percent in prime time vs. November '98.CNN wasn't the only cable news network to experience that sense of weightlessness November-to-November, but its decline was by far the steepest.
15 | Felissah Waller-redfearn | 4 | 10155569799011509_10155569971666509 | Watch the board here people,When Trump get offended he fight back with defensive derogatory remarks,When Hillary get offended she handle things with grace and poise.Trump is a menace his a self absorbed man and it would be a BIG mistake if we put him in the White House
16 | Mike Cambier | 4 | 10155569799011509_10155569942481509 | That's the kind of guy America needs , nothing gets him down , not even the threat of a so called assassination attempt , did you see how cool he was when he was taken away by the security? This man is made to be President of the USA , Hillary is nothing but a liar and a traitor........
17 | Lynda Quinton | 1 | 10155569799011509_10155570037121509 | I think this is the person in the world should be President. Just look at a the small business people his has screwed, and small business in the states are a huge part the economy. Donald J. Trump is a joke and certainly would have the business if it wasn't for his daddy. He keeps saying he's winning but he isn't and he doesn't. If you think things are bad now can't imagine how bad it would be if that idiot got elected, and I'm not even American.
18 | Cynthia Tarin | 0 | 10155569799011509_730409083778702 | Donald J Trump is going to be the next President according to biblical prophesies. In Nebuchanezzars dream Daniel prophesied that he saw 7 world empires, 6 have gone down and the 7th will topple. America is the last and final world empire and it will definatley fall, DJT is in cohoots with Putin, and that will be his downfall. According to the prophesies, America will prosper, yep DJT will bring about jobs and the people will become complacient, they will become like the people of Noahs day. In Noahs day he warned the people of the coming deluge,they laughed and mocked him, actually in the time of Noah people had never actually seen rain, what happened it did rain and they all lost their lives. So today too in our modern era, we have many people out there warning about the coming tribulation, some scoff, laugh, even cruely shun those who let them know that it has been written in the Holy Bible, they fail to understand that these modern day evangelists have thoroughly studied their bibles and are able to speak about the coming disaster. The second part of the scriptures speaks about the King of the North, now we are not able to predict if the King of the North is Russia or China, but DJT is sure praising Putin more than any other leader in the world has ever done...."food for thought'! However whenever the King of the North makes his move toward America, thats when sudden disaster will happen, the last and final empire WILL FALL...bible prophesies, God Never Lies. When this does happen it maybe too late, so stop and think who will make us happy under His reign, no one else but our Creator, he made us, and we pray everyday for His Kingdom To Come...remember we pray everyday for Gods Kingdom to come..just remember I didn't write the bible!!
19 | Franco Lemont | 2 | 10155569799011509_10155569974546509 | The sheep honestly deserve what they get.

Hopefully refugees run the country into the ground and reduce the standard of living even more...  I mean that's what your going to be getting so once again. Enjoy.
20 | Sam T. Abraham | 2 | 10155569799011509_10155569964886509 | Everyone seems to focus on how he's worth so much money and is supposedly such a great businessman...but ignore the multiple times he's gone bankrupt. Maybe he thinks if he puts the US into bankruptcy, it will wipe the slate clean like in a bank/business situation?
21 | Dan Durham | 2 | 10155569799011509_10155569960966509 | This is as good as it gets for Trumptard these days... admiring his own mask!  :-(     You're done Donald... hang up the mask, get rid of that squirrel on your head and lose the orange makeup.
22 | Dick Clark | 6 | 10155569799011509_10155569867036509 | This is also how I feel. It's almost over for me. Dear Mr. Trump,It‚Äôs taken me a while to realize this and to admit it, but I‚Äôm grateful to you.For the past few months I‚Äôve spent a good deal of time lamenting your campaign and the poison it has so effortlessly generated. I‚Äôve watched our country imploding, our public discourse become polluted, our political climate grows ever more corrosive, and wrongly assumed you were to blame.It‚Äôs only lately I‚Äôve come to understand that you haven‚Äôt manufactured our current national ugliness‚Äîyou‚Äôve simply revealed it.By saying the irresponsible, mean-spirited, ignorant things you say so freely and so frequently, you‚Äôve given other like-minded people license to do the same. You‚Äôve opened up the floodgates for our corporate sewage to flow fully. People no longer conceal their vile mess, they now revel in it, they broadcast it and retweet it.You‚Äôve made bigotry and racism socially acceptable again and that has been a kind of twisted gift because it‚Äôs allowed me to really see people; not as they pretend to be on the surface‚Äîbut in the very depths of their wounded, weaponized hearts.Over and over as your campaign has persisted, your supporters would tell me that they like you because you ‚Äúspeak your mind‚Äù. It wasn‚Äôt until recently that I‚Äôve realized that you speak their minds. You‚Äôve given credence to their prejudices and made those prejudices go mainstream.Thanks to the terrible ground you‚Äôve broken, politicians, pastors, friends, and strangers, both in person and on social media now regularly out themselves as hateful, intolerant, and malicious‚Äîand they remind me just how close they are to me, just how deep the sickness in us runs, and just how far we have to go together.You‚Äôve emboldened people to be open about things they used to conceal for the sake of decorum, and though it turns my stomach, I know that this is the only way we can move forward; to have that cancerous stuff exposed fully so that it can be dealt with. Our progress as a nation is predicated on authentic dialogue, no matter how brutal and disheartening that dialogue is.In other words, you‚Äôve let us know what we‚Äôre really dealing with here and while it‚Äôs been rightly disturbing, it‚Äôs also been revelatory. That‚Äôs the thing about that kind of harsh light: you‚Äôre forced to see everything. Beauty and monstrosity equally illuminated.Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, I think you‚Äôre the least qualified, least knowledgeable Presidential candidate we may ever have had participate this far into the process, and if you somehow were elected I‚Äôd fear gravely for the world my children would inherit‚Äîshould it survive your Presidency at all. I believe you‚Äôre reckless, bitter, and completely reprehensible; the very worst kind of bully.But whether you win or lose, you‚Äôve already allowed me the blessing of Truth; about me, about you, about other candidates, about our nation.And in the process you‚Äôve also shown me that I am not alone in resisting you and this ugly thing you‚Äôve revealed about us.You‚Äôve generated an equally loud, equally passionate response to it and this is where I find my hope these days.I find it in those for whom equality isn‚Äôt just a cheap buzzword, it‚Äôs the most precious of hills to die on.I find it in those people who refuse to be silent in the face of our impending shared regression.I find it in those willing to be bolder in defending the inherent value of all people.I find it in the growing army of those who will not tolerate hatred as a core American value.I find it in those who reject violence as our default response to dissension.I find it in the ever rising voice of people who will not let malice and bitterness represent them in the world.Today I find my hope in those who, like me, will not be complicit in allowing bigotry and intolerance to become a source of national pride, because we‚Äôve seen where that leads.Yes, Mr Trump, you‚Äôve unearthed our hidden sickness and you‚Äôve allowed it to go viral.You brought every awful thing about us out into the open.You will NEVER Get My Vote!

When he was young, his mother told him he was worthless and abandoned him at a hospital. He grew up in an orphanage and was bullied for his looks but he always tried to stay positive. He told himself that he would always believe in himself and achieve his dreams, no matter what others said. When he got older, I completely made this story up and you've wasted your time reading this..

Beg Him for mercy on behalf of our country. God is merciful and He is faithful. And no matter who wins tomorrow, He is ALWAYS in control.

2 | Gloria Lee | 8 | 10155569714186509_10155569785591509 | Hillary Clinton is the only one that can be President , Trump will bankrupt the United States and put people into a depression era that will make the 1920's look like people were rolling in money. Do not be taken in by someone that thinks and loves Hitler, Stalin, and all dictators and does not like anyone that is not in his walk of life. If you think he is for the people you are crazy he is for TRUMP only.
3 | Kysha Tarell | 2 | 10155569714186509_10155569876946509 | A vote 4 trump is a vote to restore AMerica to its great glory. We need to be feared and respected, not belittled and a constant pushover. Our population can not support additional citizens, illegal or future dependents. This is why SOcial Security will collapse by 2030, and minimum wage will decrease. We would have to set up birth limits, increase taxes, and close borders if we continue down this path. Democrats no longer care about blue collar workers; they only support elitism and white collar professions. Notice that Hollywood flocks to support Democrat politicians. Our manufacturing jobs need to stay here. Otherwise our children will not be able to work and turn to crime to support themselves.

6 | Tina Kumley Barnes | 0 | 10155569651376509_10155569747521509 | First we all need to get educated. We need to find out who HIllary really is. We are all minions to HIllary and she is not a fan of anyone but herself. Julian Assange was asked last week why all the stuff on Hillary, where is the stuff on Trump. His answer was there is no stuff on Trump.. Trump is a good man who loves his country, is a billionaire, was part of the elites and has turned on them to help the minions. Hilary is a Satanic cult worshipper, who likes sex with 12 year old girls, has abused women and forced them into silence whether it was over rape or over having a black child of Bill's. The Secret Service said she was a mean one. And she lied to Congress, lied to the American people, will say anything including smearing and cheating in her competition ask Sanders, ask Trump and has no respect for anything but money. Her unfinished business is code for getting Syria to fall so she can get her oil line put from middle east through Turkey and then through Syria into Europe. The problem is that Russia Syria's ally so she cannot get that done without WW3 so a vote for HIllary is a vote for WW3 while a vote for Trump is to get rid of Obamacare. Hillary may say What difference does it make but I say "See the difference?" http://dennismichaellynch.com/jaw-dropping-segmenthillary-clinton-email-hearing/

I do not know where they money for "free education" will come from-my guess is taxes-but anyone with a child should start realizing that, unless that child get a scholarship to Harvard, Yale, Duke, Stanford, or other such prestigious schools with prestigious alumni contributing to massive endowment for the school, your child will be much better off going to the state universities

Crazy right? I am sure ‚Äúit is just a coincidence‚Äù! I mean what else could it be? Shame on the dems, shame on them for using the name ‚Äúdemocratic‚Äù. I know a man who is a bit more democratic than them, he is the president of North Korea, maybe you know him too. He has some similar methods of silencing people, but a bit more subtle than the democrats in America.VIA BeforeitsnewsInvestigators believe FBI agent, Michael Brown, 45, shot and killed his 33-year-old wife, Susan Brown, late Friday night before setting the couple‚Äôs home on fire and then turning the gun on himself. Brown was a 12 year veteran of the Washington D.C. Metropolitan Police Department before spending the last six years in the FBI.Neighbors saw smoke coming from the Brown residence and called 9-1-1 at approximately 11:50 p.m. By the time fire crews arrived on scene minutes later, the entire house was engulfed in flames.‚ÄúMrs. Brown‚Äôs death was caused by a gunshot wound prior to the house fire,‚Äù Walkerville Police Chief Pat Frederick said, ‚Äúwhile Mr. Brown‚Äôs single-bullet head wound appears to have been self-inflicted.‚Äù‚ÄúThe totality of the evidence leads us to believe this is a murder-suicide. We believe he killed her, set the house on fire and then took his own life,‚Äù Frederick said.The findings support conclusions by investigators Saturday that the couple perished in a murder-suicide during which the 4,000-square foot house was intentionally set on fire. Authorities outlined a likely scenario based on interviews with neighbors and comments posted on Mr. Brown‚Äôs Facebook page.Brown is believed to have started the gasoline-fueled fire but spared the life of his beloved beagle, Dixie. ‚ÄúPrior to the fire, he dropped off the dog at a neighbor‚Äôs house,‚Äù Frederick said. ‚ÄúHe put the dog in a neighbor‚Äôs backyard.‚ÄùA neighbor told WHAG that Brown appeared ‚Äúpanicked‚Äù though it is unclear whether his wife was dead before or after the dog was removed from their home.The motive behind the killing is still being investigated, but police say Brown was a highly respected agent with the FBI and very well liked in the community. ‚ÄúWhat leads someone to this level of anger and violence with your wife, your loved one, who knows,‚Äù said an FBI official who knew the Brown family.Conspiracy theories are running rampant throughout many alt. right media outlets, leading many to believe this was another ‚Äúhit job‚Äù by the Clintons in retaliation for the FBI email leaks so close to the presidential election. Media outlets like Alex Jones‚Äô Infowars and WND are running with the theory that globalist assassins, working for the Clintons, had the Brown family murdered and their home burned to destroy any possible evidence.FBI Director James Comey refused to comment at this time but asked for privacy and prayer as the bureau comes to terms with losing ‚Äútwo very close friends.‚ÄùSearch for: SEARCH ‚Ä¶CATEGORIESCategoriesCopyright ¬© 2016 | MH Magazine WordPress Theme by MH Themes

If Comey didn't have credible and significant evidence last Friday, why did he write that letter? If it only took ‚ÄúONE WEEK‚Äù to review more than 600,000 emails, when it took them over a year to go through 33,000 of them before..., why didn't he do it before he wrote the letter? Then two days before Election Day she's mysteriously innocent, so the headlines can say she's not guilty the next two days. The FBI, the DOJ, everything is in her pocket‚Ä¶In the meantime, Obama is doing full-time rallies for Hillary at the expense of taxpayers, instead of thinking to do that for which he is paid... he's just a vacuum cleaner salesman, not the POTUS, he is shameful..

For that I am thankful.As a veteran, I watched your comments at the Democratic National Convention with a mixture of sadness, and anger. The United States has a military comprised of volunteers. Every single member has made the conscious choice to join the military and serve. There is not a single service member who has been forced into service. It is important for all service members (and apparently, their families) to understand that service to this great nation does not imbue one with special privileges or rights. I found your comments troubling when you said: ‚ÄúHave you ever been to Arlington cemetery? Go look at the graves of brave patriots who died defending the United States of America. You will see all faiths, genders and ethnicities. You have sacrificed nothing and no one.‚ÄùDoes it matter whether Mr. Trump has sacrificed ‚Äú‚Ä¶nothing and no one?‚Äù‚Ä¶has Ms. Clinton ‚Äú..sacrificed‚Äù for this nation? How about Mr. Obama? Your comment stating that Mr. Trump ‚Äú‚Ä¶has sacrifice no one‚Äù is alarming. Are you intimating that YOU sacrificed? Sir, your son willingly sacrificed himself. As a father I cannot imagine the pain you must feel but his sacrifice is his own. He was not forced to serve.I am troubled that you would allow a party that has little more than contempt for the US Service Member to parade you into the DNC to denounce Donald Trump. Did you watch when protesters at the DNC booed and heckled Medal of Honor recipient Capt. Florent Groberg? Did you notice your party interrupting the moment of silence for slain police officers? Your own hypocrisy in not denouncing these acts and instead using the DNC as a platform to make a political point is disgraceful. The simple fact is that whether one served or sacrificed does not give greater power to their statements. One vote is as valuable as another. That sir, is why our Country is great. Your condemnation of one person for a statement while standing idly as your party disparages veterans and police officers is the height of hypocrisy.To conflate the need to prevent potential terrorists from entering our country with the belief that ‚Äòall Muslims‚Äô should be banned is simply wrong and disingenuous. As a reminder, Mr. Trump said: ‚Äù ‚ÄúUntil we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in Jihad, and have no sense of reason or respect for human life,‚Äù The irony of your son‚Äôs own death at the hands of these very people in Iraq should not be ignored. I have little doubt that your son would have recognized the need to protect our country from these very people. In fact, he held is own troops back so that he could check on a suspicious car. Your son understood sacrifice and how to protect ‚Äúhis people‚Äù‚Ä¶‚Äôhis soldiers‚Äô‚Ä¶.‚Äôhis fellow Americans‚Äô‚Ä¶As you continue to make the media circuit and bask in the glow of affection cast upon you by a party that has little regard for your son‚Äôs own sacrifice, and veterans in general, I would ask you to consider your comments and your position more closely.Respectfully,Chris MarkUS Marine and Navy Veteran.

The lie can be maintained only for such time as the State can shield the people from the political, economic and/or military consequences of the lie. It thus becomes vitally important for the State to use all of its powers to repress dissent, for the truth is the mortal enemy of the lie, and thus by extension, the truth is the greatest enemy of the state." - Reich Master of Nazi Propaganda Joseph Goebbels
23 | Suprg Newport | 18 | 10155568454221509_10155568508831509 | Trump has stated on a video (amongst other things) that Global warming was made up by the Chinese to steal American jobs. Any idiot who dares to defend Trump saying the media is biased obviously hasn't been following all the absurd things he's been saying. Don't blame the media for showing what an idiot Trump is.
