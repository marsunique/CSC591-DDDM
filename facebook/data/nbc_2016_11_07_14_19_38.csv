2 | Gladys Franklin | 3 | 1560912037262154_1560913807261977 | Most people would associate Mississippi with rampant, blatant racism but it's actually Louisiana. They've had the most restrictive racist laws and practices in the entire country!

1 | Debbie Mckillop | 12 | 1560904230596268_1560906347262723 | My only problem with immigration is the ILLEGAL part of it! I truly don't understand how you can support not building a wall and not encouraging legal immigration?
2 | Gordo Botaitis | 4 | 1560904230596268_1560915457261812 | Today is Nov 7 2016. After much research I have come to the conclusion that Hillary Clinton is the greatest threat to global security since the guy with the little moustache. Therefore I am hoping (on that basis alone) that The Donald wins tomorrow. #TrumpWins #ClintonCrooks
3 | Mera Molano Andrea Esthefania | 9 | 1560904230596268_1560906113929413 | The dirty old big fat boys club will do anything to keep a woman from being POTUS. Just like they couldn't fathom having a black president, they can't handle having a woman at the top. No more Republican smearing after Nov 8th! Can't wait for the despicable deplorables to go back into their baskets!!!
4 | Naim Nazha | 2 | 1560904230596268_1560907357262622 | When we control the borders then people who are eligible to immigrate can come earlier and do not have to wit 3 to 5 years in limbo, only someone like Trump can pass immigration reform,
5 | Ron Earwood | 0 | 1560904230596268_1560924327260925 | If the fact that you are voting for someone based on gender or race. (As if being the president is a novelty prize. ) Is your only concern then I hope you get what you deserve. I would insult you but I don't think it would help, you are a product of common core, reality TV, and social media. And to make matters worse ,you vote. Get educated on the facts and not the propaganda that is being fed to you. Thank you.

If the Republican party keeps control of the House, the prospect of Donald J. Trump wining the presidency could come with major implications.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | PC Arndt | 53 | 1560856343934390_1560874320599259 | I was asked how I could ever support Trump after the comments he made over 11 years ago about women and if I would still support him if he made those comments to my daughter? My response was this....If he had put our nations security at risk, I would not vote for him. If his organization received large donations from countries that killed women and gays, I would not vote for him. If he boasted 30 Years of government experience, but still could not discern if an email was classified or not, without someone letting him know if it was or not, I would not vote for him. If he boasted about how he has defended children his entire life, but is for abortion, (even late term, when the child can feel pain) I would not vote for him. If he caused lives to be destroyed in Benghazi and then lied to the faces of the parents as they stood at their child's casket, I would not vote for him. If people who came against him mysteriously turned up dead, I would not vote for him. If he suddenly developed a southern accent when he was in the South, campaigning, I would not vote for him. If he continually broke the law and that was ignored, I would not vote for him, but right now, the ONLY person who does ALL these things is Hillary. Right now, the fact that Donald made these remarks over 12 years ago, does not move me. I'm bigger than those remarks and we all have said stupid things throughout our lives. To me, the fact that Hillary lies continuously, is a much bigger problem. We can see the effects of her lies by the state of our poor country right now... Rant over... Still voting for Trump. Copy/Paste from a fellow deplorable Trumpian.
2 | Edith Lilly Rose | 23 | 1560856343934390_1560866560600035 | Tbh I don't think enough people do their research when voting on anything other than the president. It truly doesn't make sense that people would vote democratic for executive but republican for legislative like they did in '12.

5 | Rosalynd Chante Elaine Doyle | 7 | 1560856343934390_1560887017264656 | Criminal investigations of Hillary Clinton with no evidence of Hillary Clinton committing a crime. So Republicans believe that Hillary Clinton committed a crime even though the FBI says she did not. Yet these are the same people who are screaming blue lives matter and think cops are above the law and support them breaking the law and committing murder. But you're mad over Hillary's emails. And I get it it's Shady!!! But how do you say somebody who has been proven not to be a criminal time and time again if somehow worse than somebody who has committed numerous crimes and has robbed numerous people of their hard-earned money. And has found loopholes to not pay taxes and boast about it. Not to mention an admission to sexually assaulting women he's raped his own wife. He's on trial for fraud he committed fraud. He's filed how many bankruptcies? And my feelings that bankruptcy is in his corporations dissolving and taxpayers eating the cost of that he stayed a billionaire. How do you expect him to actually be concerned about you. He's going to Washington to look out for his own pocketbook in the pockets of his friends who are super rich. And that is it he doesn't care about the people and his plans to bring jobs in to America is to bring back factory works such as car manufacturers but make it so where you dissolve unions so that they can pay you $7.25 an hour for a job that is that hard that physically demanding. But that's what you want you want to be paid minimum wage for a job that requires you to work to the Bone and then that way Donald Trump and his CEO friends can stay super rich and you can say Super poor and then America continues the gap between the rich and the poor, and the American dream becomes even harder to achieve. Because the top one percent of the United States will still own 90% of the wealth. And that is literally what he is telling you and his arguments is that he wants to keep the top 1% owning 90% of the wealth while 90%of the nation tries to divide 10% of the welt between 90% of the population. Which will eventually lead to another great depression! I don't like Hillary I didn't vote for her but it's it's her or him I'll have to suck it up
6 | Robert Hansen | 12 | 1560856343934390_1560876623932362 | The system is rigged? This same system that elected Trump as the Republican nominee for President, this same rigged system that elected Republicans to the majority in the House, this same rigged system that elected Republicans the majority in the Senate, this same rigged system that has elected 31 Republican governors nationally? This same rigged system that shows so much voter fraud and irregularities that Trump says runs throughout the country at the state and national level? Hysterical accusations, disinformation, propaganda and outright lies to produce lynch mob mentality proves absolutely nothing, and never will.😂

Hillary Clinton is corrupted along with president Obama . These people don't have good judgement. America is suffering because of these kind of people. These  people are Career politicians. That's all they know how to do. They have been in politics all their lives. They don't know what you need for your family and your family's future and the future of America.They don't know what you need to be happy and the happiness of your family. They love to be in power. Hillary got rich by being in politics. I believe these people never had a real job. My fellow Americans don't vote for this kind of people.

The media would no longer receive huge pay offs and news would be unbiased again.The veterans would no longer ignored and receive the medical treatment they NEED.We would no longer have a president who thinks it is ok to start a war with Russia and China.We would no longer give billions to illegal immigrants well citizens sleep in the street. We would no longer have trade deals that cost us billions and push all forms of manufacturing over seas.The middle class would no longer be taxed to the point of poverty.Planned Parenthood would no longer get away selling dead babyparts for profit.Religious freedom would be restored.Free speech would be restored Separation of church and state would be restored.WE THE PEOPLE WOULD WIN.

Establishment: We the People are done with us working folks living under one set of laws and you committing egregious crimes and never paying any price whatsoever.

1 | Geoff Gentel | 308 | 1560748370611854_1560750473944977 | It makes sense why he was trying to help Trump. Sexual Predators always look out for each other.
2 | Christine Marie | 123 | 1560748370611854_1560758983944126 | Julian Assange is not a sexual predator. Like Edward Snowden and Manning he has uncovered corruption. The man is being set up in retaliation for showing the American people they are pawns for a corrupt system. I stand with Julian Assange he deserves a metal.
3 | Jonie Miller | 51 | 1560748370611854_1560755567277801 | This is a deflection on his wikileaks drop tomorrow.. hence -HRC campaign stating don't believe any of the next Wikileaks.. and since they dropped more emails last night when their twitter was shutdown.. he is a patriot!!🇺🇸🙏🏼Maga!!
4 | David Camm | 12 | 1560748370611854_1560797480606943 | Here is another self important jerk that deserves his come uppance. He has no right to influence an election so close to the day. I don't want people like him deciding who will be President..He was hine until he started using his power from stolen info to suit himself and his choosing who will win the election.
5 | Baraka Dimson | 20 | 1560748370611854_1560781263941898 | If he and his people were equally leaking all type of things about Trump and the RNC and hacking into their emails then we can say their sole objective is to uncover the truth BUT they have clearly demonstrated that they are working with and for Russia to help the head of the deplorable movement.....Trump rig our election and undermine our democracy! Not going to happen dirt bag! HILLARY2016 all the way!
6 | Mike Rashid | 37 | 1560748370611854_1560750737278284 | I get a chuckle out of the libtards thinking that the Hildebeast will win because the FBI closed one of the two cases they have her on. Trump voters outnumber the brain dead by millions. We got this! #spiritcooking #lolitaexpress #wikileaks #projectveritas #draintheswamp
7 | Alex Frost | 17 | 1560748370611854_1560752653944759 | The same Sweden that gave a free pass to Refugees who gang raped a wheelchair-bound woman because she didn't protest enough.
8 | Tarus Morgan | 9 | 1560748370611854_1560785283941496 | This scum should face his own crimes before criticizing others...!!  I don't care what's in people's emails that's around Hillary.. There's nothing worse than rape!!
9 | Digna Regina Peguero Diaz | 4 | 1560748370611854_1560782793941745 | It's about time this person is asked about it! Ecuador will have to have the last word about for how long will they keep him in their embassy. It's not enough that they cut his internet service while he's there,sooner than later they'll have to take matters about it,because this man has envolved this country,involuntary,in the things he's accountable of.
10 | Elke Hassell | 5 | 1560748370611854_1560778823942142 | Interesting to bring up the "Rape" case again. It was DROPPED the only reason he is there cause they would make him go to Sweden and then will be extradited to the States where he will face very similar things as Mannings - Torture
11 | Erick Córtez | 22 | 1560748370611854_1560761320610559 | What's ridiculously funny about this guy is: he can steal information across the world from everyone, find everyone's dark dirty secrets BUT he can't find one single piece of information to clear his own name from the rape charge he faces.
12 | Jennifer Adcock Hollahan | 4 | 1560748370611854_1560791660607525 | NBC your sick. Trying to sway people not to believe Wikileaks on the corrupt, lying and soulless wench Hillary is. I willl never watch your BS channel again.
13 | Dee Smith Wesson | 2 | 1560748370611854_1560822430604448 | I see trumps supporters say that trump and the dude are "innocent until proven guilty" lmao wow so only white men are innocent until proven guilty but women (hillary) are guilty in your eyes, and when a black man is killed while unarmed y'all say he's guilty. Smh
14 | Henry Garcia | 0 | 1560748370611854_1560906367262721 | Donald Trump The “great shameless, audacious bawler”. In any other election this might seem super wacky but it seems par for the course this time around."Eussouis" is obviously the name of Trump's next imported wife. The false message about the rigged election, to run through the city stopping the broken pact; voices bought, chapel stained with blood, the empire contracted to another one. Rigged election? Broken pact? By the shaven head a very bad choice will come to be made, Overburdened he will not pass the gate: He will speak with such great fury and rage, That to fire and blood he will consign the entire sex. WikiLeaks Editor Julian Assange Compares Him To White Trash. He's mad, he's bad, and he's on track to be the Republican U.S. President in the 2016 general election—to the horror of everyone not already supporting him, including his own party. The false trumpet concealing madness will cause Byzantium to change its laws. From there will go forth a man who wants the edict withdrawn, changing money and standards. Donald Trump ("the false trumpet") is concealing his own madness. As U.S. President, he will cause Byzantium, a key entry point into the west for refugees! — to change its laws and will "want the edict withdrawn," presumably because if the displaced millions are not going north, they're going south. Trump, here, is enraged: someone or something has betrayed him. In the name of religion, he talks blood and he ends up swimming in it. He makes a big show of friendship and eating dirt for his efforts. Trump has described his intention of being a 'neutral broker' between Israel and Palestine—the sort of hubris that could make things much worse when he learns everyone is smarter than he expected and not giving an inch. What options would Trump then have, given a $700 billion military budget and a desperate, narcissistic need to solve whatever problem is making a fool of him? Trump being unable to get America (the republic) to go on some expensive military adventure. So he tells Britain to do the work. As it begins America realizes it needs to do its part. Trump looks like a fool and must repent. This could be some kind of risky humanitarian thing that reeks of more immigrants, perhaps -- evacuating Tripoli from an ISIS siege would be ultra. The U.S. Senate makes a show of supporting Trump, but stabs him in the back: he's impeached or ditched after four years. But then "at the sound of the trump his adherents will be there", selling their possessions and expelling enemies. The final apotheosis of Trumpism: the personality cult of a one-term loser.
15 | Keith Alan Gordon | 0 | 1560748370611854_1560815593938465 | This is not proper procedure. The Swedes should be doing the questioning. It is also being done on the grounds of the Ecuadorian Embassy. Only the laws of Ecuador will be enforce. This is another shame.
16 | Davenport Barbara | 1 | 1560748370611854_1560830673936957 | soooooo, embassies are really like "reverse jails" in that the "prisoner/criminal" is serving a self imposed sentence so he doesn't have to serve time in a real jail.  WOW, does he have to pay rent or does he live there for free?  Suprised embassies aren't overflowing this shitbags like this.
17 | Michael Reed | 4 | 1560748370611854_1560763260610365 | Funny how the two biggest anti-Clinton folks to appear on the 2016 Election Stage BOTH have been accused of rape. What's even more frightening for me is the folks on the left that have followed Julian's words as if they were gospel. (You know who you are)
18 | Prakash Bom | 0 | 1560748370611854_1560794530607238 | Rapists are messing up with the established societies around the world. This guy must be put behind the bar for his rape crime committed in Sweden.
19 | Dave Sweatman | 0 | 1560748370611854_1560923137261044 | I don't know anything about this case, but knowing what we know now about what the Democrats will do to discredit somebody and steal an election, it wouldn't surprise me if somebody was using this to silence him
20 | Betty Lamp | 0 | 1560748370611854_1560906603929364 | The woman who was at the center of the rape case has already come out and said he didn't do it, that it was a set up. That doesnt matter????
21 | Eric David | 0 | 1560748370611854_1560809280605763 | People have no clue what this election means to true Americans we need America back we need to get the corruption out of office we need good trade deals no more big companies owning us we need God back in our hearts and think about our kids and grandkids future vote trump he will not disappoint us he loves America he loves us these politicians are in it for them selves and to sell America to the highest bidder save us from corruption you will thank yourself I promise that vote trump please
22 | David Foote | 1 | 1560748370611854_1560802020606489 | Your story is such a hit Job and void of facts!! People should just know the world powers are at stake! They will do anything to keep their work secret! Exposing human trafficking and pedophilia is just not something they want you to know right now!!!
23 | Tracy Stover | 0 | 1560748370611854_1560808743939150 | Imagine it is November 9, 2016 in America and we wake up knowing who our new President will be. If it is Hillary, think of the groups of people that will celebrate. Illegal Immigrants, criminals and future criminals who will be supported for pulling a gun on a police officer, planned parenthood, the media, and the list goes on and on that represent everything that is wrong with America. If you're still "with her," look around at who you'll be celebrating with. Now imagine waking up knowing that Trump is our new President. You may or may not like him, or really know what kind of president he will be. But here are some things you will know for sure:• The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.• The media has been neutered forever.• Career politicians will have lost all job security.• The guns in your home will safely stay there.• Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.• Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally• Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.• No more apologies to the world for being great!• Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.• Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.• There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.• The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.• The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.Copy and paste this as your status if you support and will vote Donald Trump for president 2016. #trump2016.🇺🇸❤️✝️🇺🇸❤️✝️🇺🇸❤️✝️
24 | Debbie Parker | 0 | 1560748370611854_1560810247272333 | Hillary's real accomplishments:•let's all get honest Hillary Clinton was the one who exposed her emails to the Russians , if anyone is guilty of promoting espionage it is Hillary •she lied about her server setup•she lied about using several devises•she lied about sending classified and top secret documents over her unsecured illegal server•she lied about having permission to set it up•she lied about turning over all work related emails•she lied about sharing top secret and classified documents with people who had no security clearance•she directed her staff to remove classified and top secret markings from documents and send them unsecured (this is against the law)•she destroyed and then lied about destroying government documents that belong to the American people (which by the way is against the law)•she had her attorneys and the man who set up her server handling classified information and top secret information who did not have the security clearance (for which this too is illegal)•she committed perjury when testifying at the Benghazi hearing•"Clinton Cash" tells the story of their corruption •the corruption in the DNC working with her and rigging the system while working with Hillary's attorneys•selling access to Obama and herself at the DNC •the hacking of her email now, first she told us the 33,000 emails were personal and now they are calling them a threat to national security, if they were a national security risk than she lied about them being personal and that means she criminally destroyed federal documents and someone has top secret and classified information on our country "WHICH MEANS AS PRESIDENT SHE COULD BE BLACKMAILED INTO DOING SOMETHING DANGEROUS TO AMERICAN LIVES!"•Hatti, Africa, Columbia, the Congo and Nigeria•sold 20% of America's uranium to Russia •taken money from the Persian countries that rape women and children, burn Christians alive, drown people alive, behead people, drive trucks over innocent people, hang gays and lesbians and bomb indiscriminately •Iraqi, Libya and Syria are in total disarray because of her so called accomplishments•and let's not forget her mentor who was a card carrying KKK member well known for saying "I will never serve with a black man by my side." She did her thesis on this guy and to this day still praises this man•no American flags at her convention until the press pressured them to•audience was told "no American flags waving in the audience because it might offend someone," yet I personally saw Russian, North Korean, Palestinian and Mexican flags•Wants to increase the refugee to America 550% knowing the FBI said we can expect more attacks like Paris, Istanbul and Germany in the USA. "Rapes and human trafficking are already happening in Germany and yes America" but the mainstream media isn't telling you that.•we have rioting in our streets and have become an "us against them" more than we have ever been in years•we have hate groups being praised by the president and by Hillary and the DNC that are calling for death to police and whites•we now know that Hillary has used the Secretary of State position to her donors in pay to play, this is highly illegal and she is being investigated for itGreat job democrats!     Vote Trump 🇺🇸
25 | Alan Elnick | 1 | 1560748370611854_1560753410611350 | States of PlayWashington State may be among the more interesting watches tomorrow evening as the election results come in. Bernie Sanders won the Democratic Primary with over 70% of the vote Trump won the Republican Primary with over 75% of the vote. Two Democratic electors have announced they will not give Hillary Clinton their electoral vote should she win the state, this despite a $1,000. fine for not voting the popular will. Of course in Seattle, Everett to be more precise, is Boeing, the largest private employer in the state. Boeing's chief competition is Airbus in Europe. Subsidies to Airbus in Europe, particularly nearly interest free loans, and payback terms timed to actual delivery of product (if payback is even required), has put Boeing at a competitive disadvantage. Despite efforts to file for an even playing field at the World Trade Organization, effectively, no response has been obtained. Boeing, while a proponent of International Trade, wants Fair Trade, sound familiar? If the Democratic firewall is broken in Seattle, the state is Republican.Minnesota, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin are all in play. The great fallacy of all the pundits' arguments we keep hearing on all stations, is that the Democratic turnout will be high. They tend to record that in Hillary's pocket. In these states particularly, If Democrats vote in numbers, not much greater than 70% will vote for Hillary Clinton. The rest will either simply vote down ticket or for Trump. These are the Blue Dog states. Republicans will vote in excess of 90% for the Republican nominee. African American turnout will likely be much less than 2012, and the best Hillary can count on from African Americans is 70%, they are very lukewarm towards her.Tomorrow night should be more interesting from what we have not been told, than from the pablum the MSM has been feeding us.

A 5.0-magnitude earthquake centered near one of the world's key oil hubs in Oklahoma brought down building facades and shattered windows. Residents were evacuated as emergency workers assessed the earthquake damage. Read more: http://nbcnews.to/2eFmTHA
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Michael Kline | 268 | 1560656207287737_1560668403953184 | Oklahoma is heading for a big series of quakes. Wonder if they will finally figure out Oil Corporations and Republicans dont have the interests of their kids and grandkids in mind.
2 | Randy Fritter | 169 | 1560656207287737_1560687213951303 | But, fracking does not cause this huh? Don't believe the hype.This is a direct result from fracking and the oil companies don't care about you, your children, your life all they care about is profit
3 | Jennifer Myers | 241 | 1560656207287737_1560683600618331 | Fracking earthquakes y'all! It's dirty and nasty. Let alone not normal. We're ruining the earth and will contaminate our water.
4 | Jo B Welborn | 100 | 1560656207287737_1560690797284278 | There were hardly any earthquakes in Oklahoma when I was growing up. This is all in the last 10 years due to fracking. But it's fine. It's allllll fiiiiiiiine.
5 | Angela Barnett-Shelton | 42 | 1560656207287737_1560700433949981 | This must stop! Make the companies responsible for this pay for all the damages. If you do not start holding corporations responsible we are all doomed. Claiming it wasn't caused by fracking is worse than calling global warming a hoax. This is all about greed (the love of the mighty dollar) which puts everyone at risk.
6 | Ken Reed | 36 | 1560656207287737_1560723750614316 | Keep fracking and denying it's effects, Oklahoma. When you have no standing homes and no clean water, maybe you'll start listening to the environmental groups that have been telling you to STOP FRACKING for years.
7 | Gail Dotson | 17 | 1560656207287737_1560720307281327 | I believe if you have a large flood or ,you take enough oil out of the ground ,this will cause Earthquakes ,The water erodes the rocks or dirt holding layers under us ,and causes shifting ,just as it does to remove too much oil ,and fracking is the reason Oklahoma is shaking .If we the public can understand this ,why are the experts so blind ,or they know but do not give a D%^&$
8 | Matt Muyres | 14 | 1560656207287737_1560740277279330 | Oklahoma. Means red man. Snow ball throwing James inhofe, the worlds angriest climate denying senator, must be shitting in his pants, knowing this earthquake was caused by his millions of fracking wells. #nodapl #waterislife
9 | Timothy Ahern | 15 | 1560656207287737_1560722790614412 | never had bad quakes before fracking in Oklahoma, Texas .. hows that working out for ya ... history is going to show fracking was BIG mistake... how many quakes ya had this year anyways
10 | Brandy Maitland | 9 | 1560656207287737_1560722043947820 | They won't stop fracking there and the quakes keep coming that state is being run by idiots.... who will run to Washington for money when a really big one happens and we all can pay for it.
11 | Laurie Michelle Johns | 8 | 1560656207287737_1560753203944704 | It astounds me that no one seems to care about those who have lost their homes. The Cimarron towers which is for the elderly and disabled was evacuated last night. Gas leaks and the theater which is right a across from the towers had the roof cave in. All you seem single minded and are only focused on what you believe causes earthquakes instead of showing concern over those who were affected and that's just sad.
12 | Fred Norton | 6 | 1560656207287737_1560752547278103 | Remember those nutcases we see every once in a while saying "repent for the end is near" At some point these nutjobs will be correct. This election, the earthquakes in Italy, the hole in the earth's magnetic field, in my opinion are signs that the end may actually be coming
13 | Ronald Goff | 10 | 1560656207287737_1560744480612243 | Does everyone understand when the oil industry talks about using waste water for fracking ... the waste water ... they are talking about is ... sewage?They're mixing together a secret mixture of chemicals and acids, with sewage water and injecting it under extreme pressure deep underground to fracture shale seams to release oil and gas deposits.What else could go wrong besides earthquakes?
14 | Pamela Britton | 3 | 1560656207287737_1560867890599902 | We need to stop the Koch bros before they completely destroy our lands. Fracking does this and since fracking started in Oklahoma there has been an increase in earth quakes and not just in Oklahoma.
15 | Bonnie Mendoza | 2 | 1560656207287737_1560796063940418 | I agree, I don't know if this one was caused by fracking, but it has been shown that where fracking occurs earthquakes follow..Still no fracking in New York,,hope we manage to keep it out!
16 | Jack Morris | 3 | 1560656207287737_1560804210606270 | Ten reasons to vote Democrat #10. I vote Democrat because I love the fact that I can now marry whatever I want. I've decided to marry my German Shepherd.#9. I vote Democrat because I believe oil companies' profits of 4% on a gallon of gas are obscene, but the government taxing the same gallon at 15% isn't.#8. I vote Democrat because I believe the government will do a better job of spending the money I earn than I would.#7. I vote Democrat because Freedom of Speech is fine as long as nobody is offended by it.#6. I vote Democrat because I'm way too irresponsible to own a gun, and I know that my local police are all I need to protect me from murderers and thieves. I am also thankful that we have a 911 service that gets police to your home in order to identify your body after a home invasion. It will take the police an average of about 15 minutes to get to your house; 00 buckshot travels at about 1200 ft/sec.#5. I vote Democrat because I'm not concerned about millions of babies being aborted so long as we keep all death row inmates alive and comfy.#4. I vote Democrat because I think illegal aliens have a right to free health care, education, and Social Security benefits, and we should take away Social Security from those who paid into it.#3. I vote Democrat because I believe that businesses should not be allowed to make profits for themselves. They need to break even and give the rest away to the government for redistribution as the Democrat Party sees fit.#2. I vote Democrat because I believe liberal judges need to rewrite the Constitution every few days to suit fringe kooks who would never get their agendas past the voters.And, the #1 reason I vote Democrat is because I think it's better to pay $billions$ for oil to people who hate us, but not drill our own because it might upset some endangered beetle, gopher, or fish here in America. We don't care about the beetles, gophers, or fish in those other countries
17 | Chris Weglein | 0 | 1560656207287737_1560789840607707 | I still remember that east coast earthquake a few years ago in VA.  I could feel it in PA, but didn't realize it was an actual quake until social media was all over it.I have family in Norman, or OKC... whichever they claim nowadays
18 | Tonya Trytten | 1 | 1560656207287737_1560834143936610 | How long will people look the other way??  It's become a political  issue and it shouldn't be. It's a common sense issue, but this is what happens when corporations own our government.
19 | Gayle Cashion | 2 | 1560656207287737_1560757673944257 | Very few support investing in solar, (Hillary is hoping to be able to do that, but emails might keep it from happening). This country desperately needs to find alternative energy instead of dependence on fracking, or big money oil companies owning politicians.
20 | Roshni Slowski | 2 | 1560656207287737_1560838223936202 | Yup...Oklahoma, they will get worse. They will get bigger, and your infrastructure can't handle it. Trust me as a Californian when I say it's not fun. Stop fracking! These companies should be made to pay for damages!
21 | Ginny Lucky | 1 | 1560656207287737_1560751250611566 | They can thank the oil industry for ruining Oklahoma.  Get a clue you guys and put a stop to the greed of the oil companies.
22 | Pat Murphy | 3 | 1560656207287737_1560664253953599 | Going to count the number of douchebags who associate this with fracking even though its really wastewater injection wells.
23 | Gina Remke-Hart | 1 | 1560656207287737_1560807137272644 | They are ruining our homes here as well and charging us more for insurance and not paying to repair our homes for the damage caused. It is a travesty. Complete insurance fraud.
24 | Liz Lesniak-Dutton | 0 | 1560656207287737_1560833840603307 | Pff it's a red state if they want to ruin their state and water let them BUT the feds should provide NO help whatsoever! They chose to do this for the money, over public safety, they deserve to feel the consequences! When insurance Co get tired of paying for what the oil & gas companies cause they will cut off the $ & help then the residents might open their eyes.
25 | Jenni Hackney | 0 | 1560656207287737_1560790203941004 | Why do so many rush to justify oil and petrol and all its various uses, rather then up open their narrow view to other options. There are plenty of replacements for oil but people are slow to get on board! My heart goes out too these people effected it really does, now they and everyone else need to stand up against big oil and find better alternative, and there are plenty other alternatives out there.

Chuck Todd has NBC's final battleground map
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Michael Sabota | 216 | 1560645893955435_1560649600621731 | And NBC can be trusted giving truth? Last couple years, even elections they have shown how biased and corrupt the really are. I think I will wait until the vote is counted than take NBC's word for it.................
2 | Adrian Connor Evans | 210 | 1560645893955435_1560647680621923 | It's a sad day in America when someone runs for president, such as Hillary Clinton, and she has so many covert, deceptive activities that we have to rely on leaked information from an ousted journalist to see exactly how dishonest she is, and half the country blindly supports her
3 | Karl Edward | 129 | 1560645893955435_1560649500621741 | Not going to happen.  You liberal imbeciles and pretend journalists and all the sheep who blindly follow you are in for a BIG negative surprise tomorrow night.  Hillary Clinton is a pathological liar, criminal, unhinged liberal, shrill demagogue and will NEVER be elected! !
4 | Scott Partridge | 70 | 1560645893955435_1560652520621439 | .... as a Independent Voter this is the way I see it. After 30+ years in politics Hillary has a handful of celebrities backing her and the FBI looking into her affairs & foundation. Trump has the United States Military backing him along with the American Law Enforcement... Independent for Trump.! ( my healthcare cost doubles in 2017 also)
5 | Scott Hornal | 76 | 1560645893955435_1560656300621061 | NBC you better hope the polls shake out as you projected. Because if it's a landslide for Trump and an obvious lie you've been perpetrating, I don't see too much public sympathy against a movement to break up your large media concerns. Think it can't happen? Remember Ma Bell?
6 | Lisa Flores Gendron | 68 | 1560645893955435_1560653300621361 | She wasn't even smart enough to answer debate questions without cheating- CNN sent her all the questions ahead of time and no new emails show the DNC wrote questions for Ted Cruz, Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump. It is all rotten to the core ....the powerful elite run everything and they pull all the strings.They have her the questions.she knew she was cheating....but she kept her mouth shut.That tells you a lot
7 | Neomi Meir | 50 | 1560645893955435_1560652840621407 | The choice is simple. If you are an american and you love this country and you care fir the future of this country for your children, vote trump. If you are ilegal, or if you like the chaos and lawlessness, vote clinton.

8 | Matt White | 71 | 1560580357295322_1560591190627572 | 😂😂😂No! Trump can't and won't win this election. He even knows it that's why he keeps talking about it being rigged. His only hope was the FBI finding something on Hillary and clearly they cannot. It is going to be so much fun making fun of all you inbred Trump supporters the next four years.

19 | Jhon Garson | 17 | 1560580357295322_1560614867291871 | "Dear Republicans, - Author -Meira WainsteinYou remember how this started, right? You got in bed with the ‘I’m mad as hell and I’m not gonna take it anymore’ Tea Party. You saw the Harvard Law Review Editor who just happened to be black and you lost your minds. You called him a Socialist. You said he never read the Constitution. You said he was a Muslim as if that were some slight when Muslims have fought and died for this country right beside citizens of every other religion. It was never enough. You never seemed to run out of the venom you spewed.You played to the fears of white, male America. “He’s coming for your guns!” How many did the Great Gun Grabber actually get? You stared at twenty children slaughtered in Sandy Hook and turned up your palms and said, “This isn’t the time to talk about gun control.”You listened and half-believed the conspiracy theorists who talked about the great conspiracy of Sandy Hook and too many of you accused the parents of being actors. The best of you, who used to care about your country first and your party second, kept silent and eventually began to participate in the madness.You sold your souls because you saw after Romney lost that you weren’t going to be sitting your man in the White House anytime soon. Reince Priebus presented his autopsy of that election. To even be competitive, you have to carry 40% of the Latino vote and 45% of the women’s vote. Let’s not even consider the black vote which Romney lost by more than 90 points! Romney only got 27% of the Latino vote.DID YOU LEARN FROM IT?You certainly swelled your ranks with a fresh infusion of “populist” infantry who had the audacity to say Obama was going to invade Texas in Operation Jade Helm. You said that he was born in Kenya and a secret agent of the Muslim Brotherhood. You were more angry at Hillary than at the murderers at Benghazi. You stood there, silent and complicit as every maniac with a mouthpiece or radio show lied and incited their listeners to hatred and worse.  When your cries of wolf fell on deaf ears, you turned up the volume.The night Obama won, the establishment met in secret and promised to do everything to make him a one term president even if it meant hurting the country. That’s what your partisanship wrought and what did you achieve? You wasted millions in taxpayer money to flog the Benghazi horse and you voted to repeal Obamacare sixty times. While you strained to do anything to make the President look bad, you shut down the government and cost the economy $24 billion. While you played brinksmanship with the full faith and credit of our government, what you really achieved was to convince the vast majority of Americans that you are incapable of governing.This time you went to the natural end of your rope and jumped the shark with Trump costing you stalwart republicans like George Will, Charles Krauthammer, Bill Kristol and any steward of the Nation’s security. You nominated a man for his success in business even as many of his businesses were going bankrupt and are under investigation for fraud. You apparently learned not a thing from the political train wreck that was George W. Bush.But this time is different and you know it now. There is no hiding the fact that white supremacists and the full complement of other racists and xenophobes have embraced your nominee publicly and loudly.  The last Univision poll Jorge Ramos reported had Trump with an 83% disapproval rating among Latino voters. The party that claims to be the defender of “family values” sent dreamers back across the border or deported their parents  so they have to visit them across a fence. Not only have you proven that you care nothing for their lives but your nominee intends to deport eleven million of them."You built this, own it.
20 | James Reed Crawford | 3 | 1560580357295322_997208600404739 | If you didn't think a Trump presidency could be any worse, imagine Newt Gingrich having a more powerful role in government. And you deplorable lunatics talk about your guy being an "outsider". Please, he's not only an insider, he's the worst kind. The kind that puts on a big show about his supposed plans for changing things around to what you think you want. You love to watch him talk while he loves to talks to the people you already know are part of the corruption game in Washington behind your backs. He's a fake and in your heart of hearts you know it!

Just watch TV, movies, our entrrtainers...it's very sad, but family values are a joke to the people that all too often are our children's idols and role models.
24 | Keith Keybaby Lewis | 5 | 1560580357295322_1819421325001777 | And again her enemies investigated her and found nothing If the republicans have taught me anything, it's that Hillary is the most honest person to ever run for president. They have investigated her since 1992 at a taxpayer expense in the 100s of millions of dollars and found that she did nothing wrong.How many of her enemies could survive this and still run for president
25 | Sarah Spitzer | 2 | 1560580357295322_557629517774096 | Oh, sure, this election hasn't been stressfull enough! Let's seriously consider having an obnoxious, dishonest, hypocritical joke of a human as our top diplomat. Sounds fun.

Would my son have a place in your America, Khan asked Trump?

1 | Vickie Matthews Couch | 815 | 1560553447298013_1560559410630750 | Yes and the sons of the Benghazi tragedy would have a place in Trump's America if HRC hadn't been so cavalier and careless with their lives. :(
2 | Jason Coleman | 485 | 1560553447298013_1560554027297955 | Tomorrow America will go to the Polls & vote in the most volatile & heated Presidential Election in living memory.I'm a Trump supporter & nothing will sway me from that no matter what is thrown at me #Trump2016🇺🇸Clinton Supporters - I respect your views & reasons for voting Clinton & will not throw things at you because of it 👍🏻I want you all to remember - On Wednesday Brothers Will Still be Brothers, Sisters Will Still Be Sisters etc regardless of the outcome - America needs to realise that no matter who wins the only way America can ever become Great Again is by America getting behind the winner 👍🏻#TrumpPence2016 🇺🇸 #ClintonKaine2016🇺🇸 #AmericaDecides🇺🇸 #RespectfulPolitics🇺🇸
3 | Derrick Obeng Benson | 377 | 1560553447298013_1560553717297986 | Donald Trump left his billionaire lifestyle and entered the arena of politics not because he had to but because he is aware that America is on the verge of falling. He signed up to have his life dissected and torn apart. He is fighting for the American people & win or lose I will always respect him for that. I pray that he wins & shows the world that they were wrong about all the evil things they said about him. That he will make America Great Again for ALL Americans.
4 | Mark Baugh | 237 | 1560553447298013_1560577523962272 | This man disrespects the death of his own son. Accepting $25k and playing victim with a deep ulterior motive based on his law firms background he should be ashamed not honoured. His son should be for his military duty and sacrifice, something liberals don't respect much. Go help burn a flag somewhere.
5 | Belinda Gibson | 166 | 1560553447298013_1560566397296718 | LoL....oh Lord....the media will be on a frenzy today with ANTI TRUMP headlines!!!!  P A T H E T I C !!!!! THE media has turned their backs on those of us supporting Trump.....and America is suppose to be the land OF THE FREE....I don't think so. This country is not free ....it's very clear with this election.
6 | Nichelle Kaz | 123 | 1560553447298013_1560568923963132 | Idiot. Your 15 minutes is over. I respect your son and thank God for his service and his sacrifice. You are not the only person who sent their child into battle. Many of us have said that horrifying good bye.
7 | Sue Ellen Ford | 103 | 1560553447298013_1560571183962906 | What about the Americans she left to die in Benghazi ,do you think she is for the UNITED STATES ,she's not,they died so they could cover up their crimes .Corruption is in the White House .
8 | Tammy Proulx-Tupay | 57 | 1560553447298013_1560570470629644 | Sami J Ryan, I wouldn't count your chickens before they're hatched. Trump may beat the corrupt, lying, murdering POS and she & her idiot supporters will be buried by the American people on Tuesday.
9 | Shannon McCall | 53 | 1560553447298013_1560573207296037 | Thanks to Clinton and her colorful labeling of the American people, our country is further divided. I keep seeing "deplorable" being thrown around online when discussing politics. Calling 1/2 the nation deplorable has done nothing but drive the wedge deeper into this country.  And to all of you calling Kahn's son a hero, go to hell. You will call him a hero but his battle buddies deplorable. Go seek therapy and dump Clinton. Your brains are scrambled enough as it is.
10 | Debbie Twohig | 43 | 1560553447298013_1560600437293314 | Khan you are so wrong..This is our America..not yours..You've held a grudge since your son was killed over 12 yrs ago by your own people..He knew what he was getting into when he joined..Look how many of our people that have been killed by your people..It's your war that our men are fighting so all can have the freedom that we have..You should be thanking the US for all that it has done..but instead it's the hatred that is in your heart because your son was killed..
11 | Sandra Foster Sundell | 31 | 1560553447298013_1560637413956283 | I noticed 90% of the comments are pro Trump. Mr. Kahn lost his son but so did hundreds of families. But the other families weren't paid by the DNC to speak either. So sad.
12 | John G Locke | 32 | 1560553447298013_1560574487295909 | He's actually right according to the 18 page Muslim Brotherhood plan for America. They want to destroy our country from within and have stated this openly. Look what's going on right now! It's working...
13 | Jack Rougeaux | 25 | 1560553447298013_1560611337292224 | Hillary Clinton calls Trump supporters deplorables racist sexist xenophobia homophobic. Bernie Sanders supporters basement dwellers , black men super predators .Latinos taco bowl. Then she brings Khan out to campaign for her a Muslim that believes in Sharia law. Now she claims she wants to bring the country together. Hillary Clinton shows really bad judgment.
14 | Dale Meyer | 21 | 1560553447298013_1560609257292432 | This Khan is an embarrassment for our country! His sons service has been placed for a bought out political gain! He should be ashamed of himself! Lying in his sons behalf! A total looser!
15 | Andreas Eldracher | 19 | 1560553447298013_1560601860626505 | Sit Down Khan...You sacrificed your son to make yourself look good with your own agenda of terrorist insertion into America. Trump would be proud to have your son as a citizen of the US and proud that he served and sacrificed for America. Not the paid for illusion by the Clinton administration you portray as some sort of obscure vengeance ...You should be another criminal that the FBI should investigate.
16 | Nikhita Jain | 14 | 1560553447298013_1560611390625552 | Can somebody please ask this person of Pakistani origin what's the state of Hindus and Christians in his native country Pakistan...........he lectures others but he should actually put some humanity into the heads of his brothers
17 | Marlene Sommer | 16 | 1560553447298013_1560632097290148 | Interesting that Hillary and Mr Khan are pairing to get the minority vote!!! Where is the America for Chris Stevens, Sean Smith, Glen Doherty, and Tyrone Woods? #REMEMBERtheLIVESlostINbenghazi!!!!!
18 | Charles Klump | 18 | 1560553447298013_1560571880629503 | This b _ _ _ h is milking this poor family's tragedy to the hilt---if she is not example of a low life human than nothing is, including myself....
19 | Michael Bilotti | 12 | 1560553447298013_1560596663960358 | They were legally here. This argument is ridiculous. And quite frankly I'm sick of hearing it. Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt candidate this country has ever seen and the fact is that most women are voting for her because she is a women, millennials because Trump respondents what most want but don't have the heart or drive to attain so the resent him, and minority's because she promises what she can't and would never deliver. Same thing happened in 08 where we had to set a new record for the sake of setting it. Real good that did us. When is our country going to get their common sense back!
20 | Rob Maynard | 13 | 1560553447298013_1560609610625730 | Khizr Khan is a moron. Of course your son who is a legal citizen would have a place in the U.S. thats the dumbest question this guy could ask, besides what makes him so special? There are other gold star families suffering the loss of a loved one for a war Hillary voted on and of course like the Illegal email setup called it a mistake.
21 | Bob Ferenc | 10 | 1560553447298013_1560619197291438 | Mr Khan, I am sorry for your loss but what you are doing is blood money paid to you by the person that has caused the deaths of many. Trump did not kill your son and had nothing to do with it. Face facts. A word or two does not replace actions and you will say whatever the highest bidder tells you to say. So sad.
22 | Stacy Armstrong | 21 | 1560553447298013_1560569493963075 | Your people will not own this country! Vote Trump to keep out sharia law! Khan will rape your 9 year old daughter and throw your gay son off a roof to his death!
23 | Daniel Charles | 8 | 1560553447298013_1560576527295705 | If anyone thought for a second, the shadow government would let their puppet go to jail, and end their status quo, you really are STUPID. Remember the last guy who wanted to clean up DC, they ended JFK and his brother Bobby. Wake up fools.
24 | Tony Yammine | 5 | 1560553447298013_1560619320624759 | The guy had nothing to do with your son getting killed. You should have gotten mad at all the politicians you were speaking to.
25 | Celicia Longoria | 8 | 1560553447298013_1560602707293087 | Trump and Wikileaks(FBI? )  are Putin’s puppets. ...1. Trump wants an isolationist United States.2. Trump doesn’t speak out against Assad in Syria, who Putin is helping.3. Trump wants to walk away from NATO, leaving Europe to Putin as far as influence goes.4. Trump owes millions to Russia in loans. Russia is heavily invested in Trump Enterprises.5. Paul Manafort, Trumps campaign manager worked as consultant to ex Ukranian President Viktor Yanukovych.6. Yanukovych was granted asylum from Putin after being driven from power in Ukraine.7. Manafort was hired to clean up Yanukovych’s image in Russia, just like he’s attempting to do with Trump.8. Trump’s tax returns would likely show his connections to and dependence on Russia and Putin.9. Trump refuses to produce his tax returns because “It will hurt my campaign”.10. And he illegally broke the Cuban embargo.11. His foundation was shut down for lack of certification and lack of audits. 12. There are charges pending on his Trump university scam. 13. There was a pending trial in NY for charges of raping a 13 year old. * it was dropped because she had been getting death threats, and was too terrified to show up.

1 | Judith Mike Cook | 601 | 1560516733968351_1560518290634862 | Hillary is funded by Big Money, Big Corporations, and foreign governments...she sold State Dept favors for contributions to the Clinton Foundation. She has a history of 30 years of lying and corruption, she has been under investigation dozens of times...she will sell out Americans and America in the blink of an eye and never lose a night's sleep...just like Benghazi!!
2 | Justine Lee | 220 | 1560516733968351_1560520950634596 | The FBI and the media set a new presidence after yesterday's announcement... if anyone gets into trouble "plead the Hillary Clinton FBI decision of November 6th 2016...
3 | Belinda Gibson | 201 | 1560516733968351_1560531493966875 | HOW??!! THERE is NO WAY!!!! DO YOU REALLY THINK WE, the  majority of THE PEOPLE IS THAT DUMB and easily FOOLED? Give it a break. I think you are forgetting about all the social media sources available today....hint hint.....it's proving you are LYING!!!!!
4 | Scott Partridge | 137 | 1560516733968351_1560553043964720 | .... as a Independent Voter this is the way I see it. After 30+ years in politics Hillary has a handful of celebrities backing her and the FBI looking into her affairs & foundation. Trump has the United States Military backing him along with the American Law Enforcement... Independent for Trump.!
5 | Bryan Mcdaniel | 194 | 1560516733968351_1560519627301395 | They are RIGGED, unless im ahead....Lol, says The Donald.
6 | Onoja Emeka Celestine | 67 | 1560516733968351_1560522917301066 | Habaaah, this election is getting complicated. Just thinking about many things. what could be the negative effects if Clinton wins this election? How can safety be guaranteed under Hillary Clinton's administration? Are Americans safe? How can people vote for someone who has been investigated by FBI in the history of America? This election will be Rigged by Obama and co. watch out!!
7 | Angie Perry | 66 | 1560516733968351_1560520853967939 | Not wanting one to enter office is fine, loathing their ideals, practices and character cool. Dont vote for them...But vile people who wish death on another person makes you a evil putrid scumbag, whose opinion means little to anyone the moment your evil thoughts passed through your lips.
8 | Deborah Pilgrim | 55 | 1560516733968351_1560549147298443 | I don't understand how this is possible. You see the huge amount of people at Trump rallies and very few at Hillary's. It is obvious that the polls do not represent the American people.
9 | Paul Shipley | 74 | 1560516733968351_1560528813967143 | Trumps own campaign has to take his Twitter account off him because they don't trust him. Why would anybody trust him with leading the largest nation in the free world is beyond me. If you think that the most unqualified, ill tempered, con man who has ever stood for president is the man for the job you must believe in the Easter bunny as well
10 | Dave Webb | 49 | 1560516733968351_1560547117298646 | NBC News is so bent on Hillary it's pathetic. If Hillary wins (and I pray to God she doesnt) .. I'll pray daily for our country because she is going to leave it in worse shape then it is now.
11 | Sue McCabe Van Cleave | 35 | 1560516733968351_1560524260634265 | Our country is in distress..Please use an upside down American flag as your header or as your profile picture to express your feelings about our corrupt government and their decisions. ... Half of our country knows whats up...and the other half are fools.I wanted to add, if Hillary wins on Tuesday(only b/c of fraud)In January when they swear her in, Millions of Americas should show up in Washington D. C. chanting "Lock her Up, Lock her Up" to make a statement.This action would be written in our History books forever.
12 | Kurt Knopp | 19 | 1560516733968351_1560576687295689 | NBC has consistently rigged their polls with a +11 to 12 Democrat advantage, for which there is no justification this election cycle.  It's been a statistical tie at best when you do an average of polls and a lot of polls are showing a Trump lead.  I'd be so embarrassed to be NBC right now, but they have no shame. They are just as bad as the corrupt CNN.
13 | Alessio Genovese | 28 | 1560516733968351_1560523287301029 | Having the banks funding your campaign is like having some help from the Devil. People that doesn't get this, will just believe wathever television will tell them
14 | Victor Hill | 70 | 1560516733968351_1560517523968272 | The only people voting for Hillary Clinton are people who hate America and easily manipulated, stupid people!

16 | Rhonda Hart | 13 | 1560516733968351_1560525600634131 | When this election started, NBC supporters would rant rant and rant about trump supporters, now I don't see many rants at all NBC, you expect us peasants to believe your bs???

18 | Debi Skarecky-Hill | 6 | 1560516733968351_1154511307969810 | All the sad little Trump drones, mindlessly reciting exactly what their "leader" tells them to.  Use your brains...have an independent thought! It's not surprising that you were so easily conned by Trump.  Where's the outrage over him not releasing his tax returns?  My guess is he's the real criminal! Get real-it's not the Media or polls or all the women he assaulted that are lying...it's Trump!
19 | Dama Arauz | 18 | 1560516733968351_1560540323965992 | Don't be complacent and VOTE! Especially those of us in communities of color have to recognize we are the only people who can keep Trump, the predator racist out of the White House. White voters came out for Obama twice. We cant let it be said we only voted because Obama was black. We can't prove the bigots right. We cannot allow Obama's presidency to be de legitimized by the alt right who will be emboldened by a Trump win. We cannot let this epic misogynist be the example for our children.
20 | Americans Against Being A Lapdog For Israel | 13 | 1560516733968351_1560576237295734 | Hillary Clinton is a giant supporter of the government's disastrous and unconstitutional commitment to Israel. That commitment has cost the American people well over $6 trillion, thousands of American lives, puts the life of every man, woman, and child in the country at risk of terrorist attack; is a blatant violation of the Constitution's establishment clause, and constitutes the wholesale selling of the American people down the river for Israel. It's a virtual certainty that all of the aforementioned ramifications will continue unabated under Clinton and then some. Conclusion: This woman should be considered flat-right-out dangerous!
21 | Linda Eberhart | 5 | 1560516733968351_1590752304553096 | Look at the fine print at the end of the article. The survey was done by "NBC News|SurveyMonkey". Look at SurveyMonkey, where you can pay to set up your own survey and have it taken by a group of their members, who get rewards for taking the survey. You can choose "targeting options" for your repondents, which include political affiliation and voter status. Wouldn't be hard at all to rig a survey  to have the result you want. This survey is BS and there is a whole segment of the population who won't read past the headline. Talk about rigging the election with misleading headlines. Where I live there is nearly zero support for Hillary. That speaks much louder than these bogus surveys.
22 | Lyn Flynn | 8 | 1560516733968351_1560537720632919 | She's got this. Yay!!! This is exciting :) I'm such a feminist even though I always say I'm not a feminist lol. This is actually exciting and awesome :) it's gonna be cool to see :)
23 | Fern Yvette | 9 | 1560516733968351_1154551797965761 | The danger to America is not Hillary Clinton but a citizenry capable of entrusting her with the presidency. It will be easier to limit and undo the follies of another Clinton presidency than to restore the necessary common sense and good judgment to a depraved electorate willing to have such a woman linked to so much corruption and who is currently under FBI investigation for their president. The problem is much deeper and far more serious than Hillary, who is a mere symptom of what ails them. Hillary, princess of the fools, should not blind anyone to the vast confederacy of fools who wants to make her their princess. The republic can survive another Clinton who is, after all, merely a fool. It is less likely to survive a multitude of fools such as those who will make her their president.
24 | Mary Toteve | 5 | 1560516733968351_1590748304553496 | If this is true...we the people's votes are not being counted correctly or not at all. All news stations need to stop being her puppets and give us the correct information.
25 | Fern Yvette | 4 | 1560516733968351_1590778587883801 | Between extremely biased "news" and an education system that denigrates American culture and our traditional values of freedom, individual responsibility and property ownership rights, while it praises multiculturalism, ridicules traditional American values, and glorifies socialism, it is no wonder the U.S. electorate are incapable of making intelligent decisions at election time.

BREAKING: Janet Reno has died from complications of Parkinson's disease.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Sassan K. Darian | 479 | 1560486293971395_1560486487304709 | R.I.P. Janet Reno. She was the first female Attorney General. And we are less than a day away from having the first female President-elect as long as everyone goes out and votes and doesn't take the defeat of Donald Chump Trump for granted. Too bad she died a day early before the glass ceiling was shattered.Note to the right wing loons: David Koresh was responsible for the deaths at Waco including the rapes of the young girls/children that he had brainwashed along with their families. Now go bugger off somewhere else.
2 | Elvira Jefferson Clegg | 138 | 1560486293971395_1560512513968773 | Such a nice lady, my son worked under her for many years, got to meet her. I got to talk with her and one proud mom when she told me what a great job he was doing, and Attorney General Reno rest in peace.
3 | Jeff Hobbs | 113 | 1560486293971395_1560491037304254 | So... David Koresch burned all those kids, not Janet Reno. Wonder what would have happened if she had just left them alone? Another Clinton debacle. More to come...
4 | Ivan Daniel Beller | 98 | 1560486293971395_1560495267303831 | Today Janet Reno is reunited with all the women and children she rescued in Waco, Texas!And tomorrow, her old boss's wife, Hillary Clinton, will be given the green-light to rescue all the women and children in Syria!Sisters Are Doing It For Themselves!
5 | Christine Robie Kinsman | 98 | 1560486293971395_1560507310635960 | I know alot of people criticized her but she was willing to make a decision & take responsibility for it.
6 | Vicky Crump Eppenger | 74 | 1560486293971395_1560518483968176 | Odd I find it that so many people criticized the woman for being appointed by the Clinton Administration which all sitting Presidents have the right to do no matter what Party they are affilitated with. The woman had some difficult decisions to make and she made them. I guess these haters think they could have done a better job and moved the country forward instead of back 50 years!. Actually the haters probably would have not done anything because it is easier for them not to because if they had to think before they made a decision it would have been just devastating for them. RIP Janet Reno yes some of the decisions you made may not  not been approved by some at least you had the guts to do it instead of blaming others for their failings.
7 | Vernie Jefferies | 50 | 1560486293971395_1560549213965103 | My fondest memory of Janet is when she made the surprise appearance on Saturday Night Live on the Janet Reno Dance Party skit. That was a classic moment when she showed us a sense of humor at the end.
8 | Sheila Crawford Hayes | 83 | 1560486293971395_1560523970634294 | My mother, an older woman at the time, always wanted Janet Reno to get a different hair style. I would say, "Mother, she's the attorney general. I don't think she's worried about her hair!"A funny, fond memory. RIP to both ladies.
9 | David Martin | 58 | 1560486293971395_1560512973968727 | It's sad that Janet Reno passed away today, just one day before witnessing the election of the first female president of the United States of America!  Rest in Peace, Janet Reno!
10 | Rodney Foley | 14 | 1560486293971395_1560552500631441 | Well at least she didn't die in a firey inferno intrusion at the hands of the FBI and ATF directed by the Attorney General....
11 | Roslyn Ann Bauman | 9 | 1560486293971395_1560504597302898 | Sorry to hear this, I liked her alot , she actually was at a Girl Scout convention before I went because I remember  my friend Marty telling me about it. It is what got me interested in GS conventions!
12 | Dee Swain | 23 | 1560486293971395_1560537653966259 | She's just paving the way to hell for Killary. On this day we schould remember Elan Gonzolas and the trauma he was put through and all those poor babies she murdered in Waco. Yeah we know how those Democrats love children.smdh

14 | Pamela Lacombe Mullen | 11 | 1560486293971395_1560546557298702 | Janet, I wish you could have been here for the election results. Rest Janet , pray for our Country we are in for a bumpy ride.
15 | Sharon Peterson | 9 | 1560486293971395_1265390446835463 | So is voting for Hillary one of these, I'm voting for the first.....?  Never mind she has told so many lies, has had so many investigations into her dealings, should have been indicted and prosecuted for her illegal server, lying to the FBI and Congress about it, and so much more, BUT hey, I'm voting for the first woman President so it's all good!!  What a bunch of sheep!
16 | Lloyd Hart | 5 | 1560486293971395_1265404413500733 | Janet Reno is the person most responsible for all the death and destruction the US has inflicted on the world in the last 16 years with it's phony "War On Terror". As US Attorney General, she didn't lift a finger to investigate the theft of election 2000 and the subsequent suborning of the US Supreme Court by the Bush Campaign because the Clintons bribed and blackmailed her off the case. Janet Reno, coward to the grave.
17 | Jodi Meckle | 18 | 1560486293971395_1560491807304177 | Sad she didn't get to see the US have its first woman president :'(
18 | Stephanie Garcia | 9 | 1560486293971395_1560608343959190 | Hope she had a long talk with God before her last breath and asked for forgiveness for what she did in her life especially Waco!
19 | Maggie Taverner | 15 | 1560486293971395_1560491140637577 | Prayers to the Family.RIP attorney general Janet Reno.
20 | Hugh Cannon | 8 | 1560486293971395_1560615627291795 | I guess the right wing nutjobs will say Hillary killed her too because she knew the Clinton's secrets. RIP Ms Reno, you served your country well!
21 | Kathleen Newberg | 9 | 1560486293971395_1560556020631089 | Janet Reno:  "If the end brings me out right, what people said about me won't make any difference, and if the end brings me out wrong, 10 angels saying I was right won't make any difference."
22 | Jennifer McCrary Wheeler | 5 | 1560486293971395_1265402220167619 | You all sure seem confident that Hilary is going to win it. I hope you all enjoy that decision once she's in and our country goes to hell in a hurry. You might want to rethink your vote on such a dishonest person.
23 | Sam Richards | 12 | 1560486293971395_1560496010637090 | R.I.P. Janet Reno. She was the first female Attorney General.
24 | Betsy Lorena | 3 | 1560486293971395_1560553030631388 | R.I.P she was a good judge she handle my moms case and she was always ready to make decisions and follow what dhe thought it was in the best decision.
25 | Penny Rix | 7 | 1560486293971395_1560510843968940 | Thats normal. We all gunna die sooner or later. More important question is,  do you know where your going?  I know where I'm going. I'm meeting my Creator.

4 | Dama Arauz | 236 | 1560464803973544_1560489150637776 | Donald Trump, you've shown us who you are. Trump isn't stable...we don't have time to be on the edge as a nation not knowing what to expect from our president. Whether Trump will be tweeting at 3am asking the nation to see a sex tape. Donald is not a stable person...will Trump be on his best behavior today? We are electing a president not a toddler.
5 | Naomi Lockwood | 123 | 1560464803973544_1560492757304082 | The only explanation I've heard that makes sense for the way Trump supporters never question his lies is that his movement has become a cult and his followers will drink whatever cool aid he hands them. We all heard the President say "let him speak" referring to the protestor.
6 | Sherry Dunn | 122 | 1560464803973544_1560477223972302 | Why is Russia going hard for Trump? Why is it when you ask Trump a question, he deflects then brings up something Bill has done? Why does he condemn Bill for cheating and Malania was his side hoe?
7 | Brenda Reichert | 91 | 1560464803973544_1560551180631573 | So trump's crowd chanted, lock her up and trump called her obnoxious but Obama respects someone's first amendment rights points out we should respect that he was a vet and elderly and Obama takes heat from trump??? Trump isn't fit to carry Obamas sack lunch much less lead our country!!!
8 | Anita Vassar | 74 | 1560464803973544_1560466380640053 | What can anyone expect from any American that would ever support clinton. Nothing trashier in all of America than a clintonite.
9 | David Williams | 52 | 1560464803973544_1560528890633802 | Bottom line, Trump lost so much money in one year he has avoided paying taxes for over a decade, how do you get "great" business man based on that?
10 | Elizabeth Snow-Murphy | 38 | 1560464803973544_1560595447293813 | She is my hero for lasting in his cesspool of a rally long enough to make her point! Why don't you respect women, Donald? Ladies, let's grab him by the ballot on Tuesday!! 😸
11 | Betty Ash | 49 | 1560464803973544_1560475933972431 | He can't take it when his own words are thrown back to him.
12 | Matt Barton | 24 | 1560464803973544_1560538700632821 | Donald Trump left his billionaire lifestyle and entered the arena of politics not because he had to but because he is aware that this country is on the verge of falling. He signed up to have his life dissected and torn apart. He is fighting for the American people and win or lose I will always respect him for that. I already casted my vote for him and I pray that he wins and shows the world that they were wrong about all the evil things they said about him. That he will make America Great Again for ALL Americans.
13 | Brian Serwicki | 36 | 1560464803973544_1560490933970931 | "Hillary has the resilience that it takes to do this job. See, because when she gets knocked down, she doesn’t complain or cry foul. No, she gets right back up, and she comes back stronger for the people who need her the most. And here is what is also true—and I want you all to think about this: Hillary is one of the few people on this entire planet—and clearly the only person in this race—who has any idea what this job entails, who has seen it from every angle. Hear me: the staggering stakes, the brutal hours, the overwhelming stresses. And here's the thing—she still wants to take it on. See, because she believes that she has an obligation to use her talents to help as many people as possible. That is why she’s running."Now, let me tell you, that is what dedication looks like. That is what love of country looks like. So when I hear folks saying they don’t feel inspired in this election—well, let me tell you, I disagree. I am inspired. Because for eight years, I have had the privilege to see what it takes to actually do this job. And here’s what I absolutely know for sure: Right now, we have an opportunity to elect one of the most qualified people who has ever endeavored to become president. Hillary has been a lawyer, a law professor, First Lady of Arkansas, First Lady of the United States, a U.S. Senator, Secretary of State. That’s why I’m inspired by Hillary. I’m inspired by her persistence and her consistency, by her heart and her guts. And I’m inspired by her lifelong record of public service. No one in our lifetime has ever had as much experience and exposure to the presidency—not Barack; not Bill. And, yes, happens to be a woman.  "So we cannot afford to squander this opportunity, particularly given the alternative. Because here is what we know—that being president isn’t anything like reality TV. It’s not about sending insulting tweets or making fiery speeches. It’s about whether or not the candidate can handle the awesome responsibility of leading this country. So, ask yourselves: Which candidate really has the experience, the maturity, and the demeanor to handle the job I described to you? Which candidate’s words and actions speak to the future we want for our country and the values we share—values like inclusion and opportunity, service and sacrifice for others?" —First Lady Michelle Obama
14 | Christine Riebe | 13 | 1560464803973544_693166177506354 | Trump hasn't learned how NOT to lie. My fave is how he claims Obama "screamed" at a Trump supporter over the weekend. Watch the video...Obama stood up for the guy lol ....perception is everything. Can't wait until the orange one goes back under his rock....ugh!
15 | Gio Tum | 14 | 1560464803973544_1560547650631926 | Humpy dumby trumpy thought he built a Great Wall, Christie and Juliano sat next to the orange clown, than they had a HUGE fall than they went through the earth to get to the other side CHINA were they can be dictator with their friend Putin or visit North Korea which will be closer for them to travel and share their Hitler's ideas.
16 | Mary Ann Bailey | 18 | 1560464803973544_1560512753968749 | Good Lord, People stop putting each other on trial. Nobody owes anyone explanation or proof of anything. Stop being a bunch of arrogant, obnoxious bullies and respect each other's opinions . If you can't do that, just scroll and go. Truth is: none of the candidates  can be classified as perfect.
17 | Deb Talaber | 9 | 1560464803973544_1560592570627434 | If Trump becomes President...THINK HARD FOLKS!• The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.• The media has been stomped.• Career politicians will have lost all job security.• The guns in your home will safely stay there.• Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.• Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally• Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.• No more apologies to the world for being great!• Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.• Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.• There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.• The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.• The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.Copy and paste this as your status if you support and will vote Donald Trump for president 2016.
18 | Teresa Charlene Roberts Oliver | 11 | 1560464803973544_1560513140635377 | I just don't see how anyone can say this country has moved forward in the past 8 years! We have fallen back with all the racial uproar that has been going on for at least 3 years now! Until 8 years ago we as Americans had moved past color and gender division! But now we live in a time where all that is being torn apart by those who hold power! Goverment, MSM, DNC, etc has used these issues that had died along time ago and used it to rip this country apart! I'm so sick of the BS that has been started by those who want to finish off this once great country called USA! WE AS A NATION  have let those that hold power bring us to our knees and turn on each other! When was the last time you had something nice to say to someone whom doesn't share your views! When was the last time you helped your neighbors that don't see things your way!  You need to look in your mirror and ask yourself, is this the person I was 2,4,8 years ago? Did I have this much hate in my heart before all this mess started? A country can only be conquered when it's divided! And I hate to say this and never thought I would but we are so divided that we are ripe for conquering! The fall of this country will be determined come tomorrow night and I HOPE AND PRAY we are not conquered!
19 | Amber Marie | 5 | 1560464803973544_1560557530630938 | So do you remember when you yourself lied to Tue American people about health care : if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor. And health care cost will go down . you Obama did not even try to be sneaky about it you just flat out lied to the American people . so stfu about Trump . he actually wants American to be put 1st
20 | David Barnes | 10 | 1560464803973544_1560478293972195 | What neither candidate has addressed is the growing entitlement problem. Social security is growing at a rate that places a burden on our youth they may not  and should not bear. What is the answer? Each candidate must face this issue.
21 | Kandi Rehma | 18 | 1560464803973544_1815557475395657 | PASS THIS AROUND IT GIVES HEART FELT INSIGHT.Will A Kelly WROTE : Dear Mr. Trump,It’s taken me a while to realize this and to admit it, but I’m grateful to you.For the past few months, I’ve spent a good deal of time lamenting your campaign and the poison it has so effortlessly generated. I’ve watched our country imploding, our public discourse become polluted, our political climate grows ever more corrosive, and wrongly assumed you were to blame.It’s only lately I’ve come to understand that you haven’t manufactured our current national ugliness—you’ve simply revealed it.By saying the irresponsible, mean-spirited, ignorant things you say so freely and so frequently, you’ve given other like-minded people license to do the same. You’ve opened up the floodgates for our corporate sewage to flow fully. People no longer conceal their vile mess, they now revel in it, they broadcast it and retweet it.You’ve made bigotry and racism socially acceptable again and that has been a kind of twisted gift because it’s allowed me to really see people; not as they pretend to be on the surface—but in the very depths of their wounded, weaponized hearts.Over and over as your campaign has persisted, your supporters would tell me that they like you because you “speak your mind”. It wasn’t until recently that I’ve realized that you speak their minds. You’ve given credence to their prejudices and made those prejudices go mainstream.Thanks to the terrible ground you’ve broken, politicians, pastors, friends, and strangers, both in person and on social media now regularly out themselves as hateful, intolerant, and malicious—and they remind me just how close they are to me, just how deep the sickness in us runs, and just how far we have to go together.You’ve emboldened people to be open about things they used to conceal for the sake of decorum, and though it turns my stomach, I know that this is the only way we can move forward; to have that cancerous stuff exposed fully so that it can be dealt with. Our progress as a nation is predicated on authentic dialogue, no matter how brutal and disheartening that dialogue is.In other words, you’ve let us know what we’re really dealing with here and while it’s been rightly disturbing, it’s also been revelatory. That’s the thing about that kind of harsh light: you’re forced to see everything. Beauty and monstrosity equally illuminated.Now don’t get me wrong, I think you’re the least qualified, least knowledgeable Presidential candidate we may ever have had participate this far into the process, and if you somehow were elected I’d fear gravely for the world my children would inherit—should it survive your Presidency at all. I believe you’re reckless, bitter, and completely reprehensible; the very worst kind of bully.But whether you win or lose, you’ve already allowed me the blessing of Truth; about me, about you, about other candidates, about our nation.And in the process, you’ve also shown me that I am not alone in resisting you and this ugly thing you’ve revealed about us.You’ve generated an equally loud, equally passionate response to it and this is where I find my hope these days.I find it in those for whom equality isn’t just a cheap buzzword, it’s the most precious of hills to die on.I find it in those people who refuse to be silent in the face of our impending shared regression.I find it in those willing to be bolder in defending the inherent value of all people.I find it in the growing army of those who will not tolerate hatred as a core American value.I find it in those who reject violence as our default response to dissension.I find it in the ever rising voice of people who will not let malice and bitterness represent them in the world.Today I find my hope in those who, like me, will not be complicit in allowing bigotry and intolerance to become a source of national pride because we’ve seen where that leads.Yes, Mr. Trump, you’ve unearthed our hidden sickness and you’ve allowed it to go viral.You brought every awful thing about us out into the open.You will NEVER Get My Vote!MR. TRUMP

1 | Nosreb Kram | 149 | 1560371990649492_1560375220649169 | Please can we frack more? It's such a great idea...I mean, who knew we could break up the gases under the earth and use our drinking water to do so, making it unusable, and thus forcing people to by bottled water... All for fuel and energy.Man, it's almost, like... It's like we don't have any wind or direct sun light... If only we had something like that to protect with military hardware... Hmmm I wonder, ...
2 | Christopher Nau | 101 | 1560371990649492_1560373003982724 | Another reason why fracking is a terrible idea.
3 | Kerrie Harlin | 49 | 1560371990649492_1560376473982377 | Meanwhile our dear old governor sanctioned an official day of prayer for the success of the oil and gas industry. At first only Christians were to pray then she back tracked and included all faiths. This all after she was forced to admit that fracking was causing the earthquakes.
4 | Robert Rodel | 40 | 1560371990649492_1560378087315549 | Geologists have explained why fracking in the Oklahoma area causes earth quakes. We have to at some point relize these areas canot with stand the damaged fracking causes
5 | Dean Caldwell | 34 | 1560371990649492_1560404930646198 | Go ahead Oklahoma, Frack some more! Isn't Oklahoma the state whose Senator came out on the floor and had a snow ball and proclaimed there is no global warming?
6 | Crystal Dupree | 28 | 1560371990649492_1560375010649190 | Oil companies destroyed Oklahoma, we feel those Oklahoma quakes in Kansas two or three times a month.
7 | Karen Selberg Thorson | 10 | 1560371990649492_1560382250648466 | Let's get a map of FAULT lines through Oklahoma and you might see a problem. Mother Nature created those- can't say fracking did not add to it but Oklahoma is heavy in fault lines.
8 | Jodie Patterson | 8 | 1560371990649492_1560577497295608 | I can't believe republican American citizens have been brainwashed to the point they don't care if thier entire state splits into, if a huge earthquake comes and most homes fall apart oh well.  Its like it doesn't matter as long as they support what the  republican politicians want.  It's outrageous they can't remember when they were kids OK had no earthquakes, now they do and they can't seem to put 2 and 2 together that fracking is harming the earth.
9 | Marie Logston | 15 | 1560371990649492_1560413260645365 | Ive always thought earthquakes and Huge Sinkholes were caused by fracking..But mostly Republicans dont believe fracking harms anything and they don't believe in Global Warming..As their Trump says on his commercial, Its called Weather People...Boy is he smart lol...We need someone with his smarts for President lol...Hillary 11-08-2016. Blue all the way..This Do nothing Congress must Go...
10 | John Tsangaris | 12 | 1560371990649492_1560429777310380 | Keep fraking, it's harmless! 😵 Republicans don't believe the data supporting global warming either. Morons have no right to complain.
11 | Daniel Gormley | 11 | 1560371990649492_1560397040646987 | One day, probably soon, one of these increasingly large fracquakes is going to break open that giant oil storage facility. The resulting explosions will be seen from many miles away. No one in Cushing will see it though, or rather it will be the last instant they see anything. It's all right though, because the Koch brothers will keep getting paid right up till the end.
12 | James Ricker | 7 | 1560371990649492_1560394323980592 | Bribes (campaign donations) are flooding Washington and Oklahoma City as we speak to make sure nobody looks to closely at this.
13 | Lori Mahaffey | 1 | 1560371990649492_1560481337305224 | I live in OK.  I don't know what the answer is.  For those people screaming at the O&G industry -- what are you doing to eliminate your dependence on O&G?  People are wondering why our Gov (who I dislike) called for praying for oil -- because 100s of thousands of incomes are from working directly or indirectly for O&G.  WHAT is the ANSWER?? I wish someone would figure it out.   I personally think it is from the natural fault lines, drilling AND our recent drought.
14 | Molly Torres | 1 | 1560371990649492_1560687300617961 | I'm wondering what the people of Oklahoma feel about this? Are you angry about the fracking? Are you worried about the future of your state? Or are you willing to trade your safety for the profits of the oil companies?
15 | Sarah Berry | 4 | 1560371990649492_1560379993982025 | Fracking does not case earthquakes. Good god. The earths plates are thousands of miles below the surface, fracking is done about about 300-500 feet...... A U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) geophysicist debunked claims by environmentalists that hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, causes damaging earthquakes. ... The region's earthquakes aren't due to fracking,
16 | Michael Farmer | 5 | 1560371990649492_1560538447299513 | Hope they are enjoying their oil. Surely the oil companies will pay for the damage right? Nope. Oklahoma's bought off government made it illegal to sue the oil companies for the damage they do to your home.
17 | Cassie Webster | 0 | 1560371990649492_1560778917275466 | Someone really needs to do a big story on this. I live in Sallisaw, Oklahoma, farely close to Cushing. These earthquakes are getting bigger and bigger and more often. The one on November 2 I believe they said was 5.8 and felt in 7 states!!! The one last night felt in 4 states. Idk if it's fracking or what, but look into it. Just say in.
18 | Paula Burkhart | 9 | 1560371990649492_1560389030647788 | Just keep it up, big oil.  Ruin the whole frigging environment for your filthy, polluting fracking -- we're going to get this stopped.
19 | Lawrence Depenbusch | 0 | 1560371990649492_1560778473942177 | Nemaha Ridge fault, fractured by God eons ago has been moving since way before any oil was discovered in Titusville, Ohio and later in Oklahoma.
20 | Thomas Bryan | 3 | 1560371990649492_1560493133970711 | Funny to see all that rants in here against those darned ol' Republicans. Fracking has grown by 400% under obama. Hillary is on record repeatedly promoting the "harvesting" of natural gas. But hey, let's just ignore facts and keep blaming those darned Republicans.
21 | Barry Fitzman | 0 | 1560371990649492_1560779647275393 | Okies are getting what they deserved by fouling the great state they had with oil wastes....and electing climate change deniers who protect oil companies from suits for the damage they cause!

Aware that she could be declared the president-elect in about 48 hours, Clinton seemed to get a head start on the national group therapy session.

2 | Sherri Allen | 331 | 1560358420650849_1560364440650247 | There is nothing she can do to reconcile anything with me. You know that feeling, that intuition you get about people? It is not good with her and my intuition has never failed me. This woman does NOT care about us.
3 | Darrell Jordan | 193 | 1560358420650849_1560365673983457 | She won't build bridges she will sell everything that can make them more money. If you stand with her than basically your an accessory to killing off America.
4 | Robert Larrabee | 186 | 1560358420650849_1560364767316881 | I will never honor this lying murderer as President. She will be impeached before the end of her first term setting women back politically for a generation.
5 | Joe Guerra | 81 | 1560358420650849_1560369777316380 | Hillary. Blah, blah, blah. Nobody is listening. You are dishonest.Let's get the election over with so we can move ahead with more endless investigations and your imminent impeachment as President-elect.
6 | Brian C Laverenz | 78 | 1560358420650849_1560363133983711 | When America even considers electing SCUM LIKE HILLARY CLINTON.......The system is falling apart and without substantial change cannot be fixed......
7 | Sherri Allen | 56 | 1560358420650849_1560366810650010 | This country has never been more divided since the civil war. She will just bring more of the same of what our current president has done . My heart truly hurts for the shape this country is in
8 | Jerome Edward Lindgaard | 49 | 1560358420650849_1560361533983871 | Chris Matthews: If you like the way things are the way they are headed in this country. If you’d like to continue the destruction of our manufacturing base, and the jobs that went with it. If you like the uncontrollable immigration, if you like the string of stupid wars from Iraq to Libya to Syria. If you want to say yes to all of that, if you want to keep this all the way it is, fine, then vote for Hillary Clinton. If you don’t like the way things are headed you got a chance to really shake the system the system at its roots. If you wake up on Election Day and it’s the same as it is today, if its the same 4 or 5 or 8 years from now, remember you had a chance really change it up but you were to dainty to do it.
9 | Sonya Boyd Collier | 52 | 1560358420650849_1560365133983511 | You can't unify a country by making people give up their freedom to please another group of people!! You can only unify people by treating each person equal rather they have the same beliefs or not!! Those who want to take away others rights are the ones dividing this country and they want to be treated as superior not equal!!
10 | Larry DeFilippis | 33 | 1560358420650849_1560372080649483 | Even if she wins, tens of millions will never support a criminal in the Whitehouse. We the People will never allow ourselves to be governed by an illegitimate president.  Clinton will be unable to build bridges among those who believe she should be in prison instead of the Oval Office.  The first time she uses Executive privilege or violates her duty to carry out the laws of this country or her obligation under the constitution, all hell will break loose.  That glass ceiling she shatters may come showering down upon her.  Those who elect her are complicit in her treachery and patriots of this country won't soon forget!
11 | Wendy Boyer | 29 | 1560358420650849_1560367390649952 | Premature doncha think NBC? Election hasn't ended yet. Hillary will never be my president or voice. Sorry. I don't let women speak on my behalf when they support a sexual predator, rapist, or a man who commita adultery on her. Nor do i support a woman who was proud to march against the blacks movement for equality,  or who is against gay rights and proudly advocated this in several interviews over the last 30 years. I do not support a woman who risks our nations security and uses "i dont recall" as her best defense in court. I do not support a woman who lies under oath. (Watch the trial and listen to the questions asked, Comey stated on the record Hilary had lied). I do not support a woman who has been investigated by the fbi time and time again, who stole thousands of dollars in furniture from the white house (who does that? Did she think it was a divorce split of belongings?)... i do not support a woman who believes in abortion up to 36 weeks. (If a pregnant woman is murdered, its considered a double homicide so please enlighten me, how do you claim no life in the womb based on that law?). . I do not support a woman who calls women deplorable or idiots. She literally says she speaks for all women so, uh, guess integrity and respect aren't too high on her morals?The nation will crumble under her administration. You think its rough now, this is a smooth ride in comparison to what it will be.
12 | Rob Maynard | 20 | 1560358420650849_1560366537316704 | But what do you do if she's indicted for Violation of the RICO act? Clinton Foundation is still under investigation.What do you do if she's impeached? There's more than enough evidence to impeach her at this point.

15 | Andrew Buck | 13 | 1560358420650849_1560410353978989 | Hillary takes tens of millions from middle eastern countries that kill/beat women and gays by government decree, not to mention her foundation robbed Haiti of hundreds of millions after the earthquake which resulted in thousands of poor black Haitians dying! THIS DEMOCRAT will be voting for JILL STEIN.
16 | Matt Furlong | 14 | 1560358420650849_1560369200649771 | Hillary supports slave labor in foreign countries. That is why our businesses are moving out of the U.S. Companies don't want to pay 15.00 an hour when they can pay .15 an hour. So when you think Hillary is for women and children, just think about all the women and children working in slavery around the world thanks to our career politicians.
17 | Shawna Holly | 1 | 1560358420650849_1098490016939087 | It won't work. Too many people are so completely anti-Hillary that there's just no bringing them around. And too many people are so pro-Trump that there's no bringing them around either. The rift between Democrats and Republicans is just too great. The most likely way to get Washington functioning again would be to elect a neutral third party who has no vested interest in either side; someone who will bring in the best from both parties and from the moderate center.
18 | Mike L King | 30 | 1560358420650849_1560364220650269 | Women who vote for hillary Do NOT have very high moral and ethical standards about the first female presidents. I mean if a woman can cast a vote for hillary, then that woman has zero integrity.

23 | Fern Yvette | 2 | 1560358420650849_1098561676931921 | Between extremely biased "news" and an education system that denigrates American culture and our traditional values of freedom, individual responsibility and property ownership rights, while it praises multiculturalism, ridicules traditional American values, and glorifies socialism, it is no wonder the U.S. electorate are incapable of making intelligent decisions at election time.

Saturday Night Live will showcase some of its best political sketches of this election cycle in an hour-long clip show on Monday at 10 p.m. ET, but here are some of our favorites.
--------------Comments:--------------

2 | Ricky Lynch | 27 | 1560304933989531_1560305487322809 | Imagine it is November 9, 2016 in America and we wake up knowing who our new President will be. If it is Hillary, think of the groups of people that will celebrate. Illegal Immigrants, criminals and future criminals who will be supported for pulling a gun on a police officer, planned parenthood, the media, and the list goes on and on that represent everything that is wrong with America. If you're still "with her," look around at who you'll be celebrating with. Now imagine waking up knowing that Trump is our new President. You may or may not like him, or really know what kind of president he will be. But here are some things you will know for sure:• The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.• The media has been neutered forever.• Career politicians will have lost all job security.• The guns in your home will safely stay there.• Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.• Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally• Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.• No more apologies to the world for being great!• Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.• Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.• There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.• The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.• The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.Copy and paste this as your status if you support and will vote Donald Trump for president 2016. #trump2016.

4 | Smith Bright | 1 | 1560304933989531_1560505727302785 | During those days according to the bible. Great prophet Elisha was prophesying what was going on even in the house of King. That is the book of second King. Hilary Clinton you will be the winner. The true prophet of our time has already predict her winning. More grace Prophet TB Joshua. So let keep our eyes open.
5 | Tom Taylor | 1 | 1560304933989531_1560341413985883 | Regarding the investigation into Hillary's unauthorized private server, that she apparently used to avoid transparency and ANYONE looking into her emails regarding the Clinton Foundation.The controversy isn't over. It will never be over until there is justiceEver stop to think that if Hillary had just obeyed the law and rules in the first place, none of this would have been necessary?Sorry, but Hillary isn't above the law!I'm a doctor.Do you know what would happen to me in court in a malpractice case if I altered or destroyed records that were subpoenaed for that case?Yet, Hillary deleted over 30,000 emails from her server AFTER she was subpoenaed by Congress to hand it over!And you think that is perfectly OK?Sorry, but polls overwhelmingly show that most Americans believe she should have been indicted.I agree with the majority.There shouldn't be one set of lenient rules for her and another harsher set for the rest of us.That isn't justice.That is CORRUPT.😉
6 | Bjorn Vikernes | 2 | 1560304933989531_1560354167317941 | So much sorrow in the world is caused by the serpent Hillary. Just think about Iraq and Libya with millions of casualties. Then there is her foundation who receives money from terrorist sponsors. The nasty woman should go to jail.
7 | Michael Moore | 4 | 1560304933989531_1560336490653042 | There has been a coup d'é·tatWe need to face the fact, our government is now under the control of a Criminal Syndicate, we no longer have a functional government under the Constitution..... there has been a coup d'é·tat by Obama, Lynch and Hillary !!!!!!!!
8 | Klaus Reck | 0 | 1560304933989531_1560872287266129 | If you are Gay or lesbian, why would you want to vote for Hillary, when she gets millions from countries that will execute or in prison gays & lesbians?If you are Black, why are you voting for Hillary when she defends Planned Parenthood and admires Margaret Sanger, who wanted to abort as many black babies as possible and exterminate the black race, and Margaret Sanger said blacks are “morons,” “idiots,” “imbeciles,” “human weeds,” and “misfits.” Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.If you are a Woman, how can you vote for Hillary when she has buried all of Bill's rape victims under the rug. As an attorney, Hillary also defended the rapist of a 12-year old girl and laughed about it later. She plays the woman-card and acts entitled; implying that she deserves your vote merely because of her sex. How is that gender neutral?If you are a Miner, Steelworker or have a Factory job, why are you voting for Hillary when she supported NAFTA and TPP, and workers are being laid off because jobs are going overseas? She also welcomes open borders and illegals to get benefits with your tax money and compete for our jobs. Hillary boasts that under her administration miners and steelworkers will lose their jobs.If you are a Law abiding citizen, how can you vote for Hillary when she is clearly above the law? Hillary deleted thousands of secret e-mails *after* they had been subpoenaed by the courts (illegal). Hillary kept thousands of classified and top secret e-mails on her private server; servers that had less security that g-mail and Hotmail. You can be sure Russia, Iran, and China have those now. The DNC clearly broke the rules by heavy-handedly favoring Hillary over Sanders while they were still competing for the nomination.If you are a Veteran, in the military, or closely related to a military member, why are you voting for Hillary when she left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again? They called for help, but the help was told to stand down. Furthermore, Hillary wants to eliminate the NRA, take away your guns, and abolish the second amendment?Go Trump
9 | David Hughes | 0 | 1560304933989531_1560362357317122 | companies leave for low wages and lower taxes. Hillary wants to increase corp taxes, they want allow it, they will leave first. but those who believe she will don't know the Clintons like us from Arkansas do. she will not raise corp taxes , if she really was do you think so many large hedge funds would be supporting her...their in business to make money, not pay millions in additional taxes due to Hillary. it is a lie spread to the democrats because they believe anything
10 | Arthur Allen | 3 | 1560304933989531_1560307117322646 | People will be going to their polling stations in the next few hours. They will be casting their opinions, and selecting who they think best, as to who should be running this country.Whether it be democrats, or republicans. I urge everyone everywhere who decides to vote, be honest, and consider the outcome of your decision. Because your vote will impact this country for the next 30 to 50 years.I pray that God will lead the people into the right decision. We have an agenda facing the United States of America unlike we have ever known in our 240 years of existence.Please pray for whoever is elected that God's will should be done.

12 | Iggi Gershon | 0 | 1560304933989531_1560349653985059 | BRIDGATE: Humpty Trumpty’s lapdog Christie is embroiled in a crime committed by his top bureaucrats who were doing his bidding and Christie is ultimately responsible for the corruption within his circle. Like Humpty Trumpty, Christie keeps a list of enemies — a simple formula based on fear, punishment and reward. This spiteful creep is going to be responsible for picking Humpty Trumpty’s henchmen in his government! His other devotee, crazy Rudy Giuliani is now openly boasting that the Trump campaign got advance notice of disgraced FBI AND Republican Comey’s letter before it went to Congress! Putting aside these criminal activities remember a vote for the gruesome twosome ... Humpty Trumpty and the Undertaker Pence ... is a vote AGAINST Women ... Blacks ... Latinos ... Mexicans ...Muslims ... Jews ... Disabled ... War Veterans ... Decent Republicans ... LGBTQ ... etc ...  Vote BLUE for sanity and responsible government!
13 | Mega Marine Romanus | 1 | 1560304933989531_1560424417310916 | Dear God in Heaven,We know you are in control. Nothing happens except that you ok it, to put it simply. I truly believe that Mr. Trump has gotten this far because you called him to be our next Commander-in-Chief. I don't think that you have given him the wings to fly this far, just to have his wings taken away. I believe you want to take him all the way to the White House. What he has accomplished so far is nothing short of a miracle. But there is still work to be done. Lord, we implore upon you, in the name of Jesus, to help Trump fight the good fight...in any more interviews, at all of his rallies and press conferences, against, not only his earthly enemies, but also the evil in the air, the evil that can't be seen. The evil that you want to see defeated as much as we want it to be defeated. By your Holy Spirit and on the advice of others on his team, let his words and thoughts be clear and concise to help him bring his message of hope to all the citizens of this great country. He needs your help Lord and we are relying on you to guide him for the rest of this campaign and also into and throughout his presidency. Thank you Lord for hearing our cries and our prayers. In Jesus' name. 🙏 Amen
14 | Ricky Lynch | 0 | 1560304933989531_1560365863983438 | BILL CLINTON'S LOVING WIFE --- by DICK MORRISIf you happen to see the Bill Clinton five minute TV ad for Hillary in which he introduces the commercial by saying he wants to share some things we may not know about Hillary's background, beware as I was there for most of their presidency and know them better than just about anyone. I offer a few corrections:Bill says: "In law school Hillary worked on legal services for the poor."Facts are: Hillary's main extra-curricular activity in 'Law School' was helping the Black Panthers, on trial in Connecticut for torturing and killing a 'Federal Agent.' She went to Court every day as part of a Law student monitoring committee trying to spot civil rights violations and develop grounds for appeal.Bill says: "Hillary spent a year after graduation working on a Children's rights project for poor kids."Facts are: Hillary interned with Bob Truehaft, the head of the California Communist Party. She met Bob when he represented the Panthers and traveled all the way to San Francisco to take an internship with him.Bill says: "Hillary could have written her own job ticket, but she turned down all the lucrative job offers."Facts are: She flunked the D.C. bar exam, 'Yes', flunked it, it is a matter of record, and only passed the Arkansas bar. She had no job offers in Arkansas, 'None', and only got hired by the University of Arkansas Law School at Fayetteville because Bill was already teaching there. She did not join the prestigious Rose Law Firm until Bill became Arkansas Attorney General and was made a partner only after he was elected Arkansas Governor.Bill says: "President Carter appointed Hillary to the Legal Services Board of Directors and she became its Chairman."Facts are: The appointment was in exchange for Bill's support for Carter in his 1980 primary against Ted Kennedy. Hillary then became chairman in a coup in which she won a majority away from Carter's choice to be chairman.Bill says: "She served on the board of the Arkansas Children's Hospital."Facts are: Yes she did. But her main board activity, not mentioned by Bill, was to sit on the Wal-Mart Board of Directors, for a substantial fee. She was silent about their labor and health care practices.Bill says: "Hillary didn't succeed at getting health care for all Americans in 1994 but she kept working at it and helped to create the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) that provides five million children with health insurance."Facts are: Hillary had nothing to do with creating CHIP. It was included in the budget deal between Clinton and Republican Majority Leader Senator Trent Lott. I know; I helped to negotiate the deal. The money came half from the budget deal and half from the Attorney Generals' tobacco settlement. Hillary had nothing to do with either source of funds.Bill says: "Hillary was the face of America all over the World." (LOL)Facts are: Her visits were part of a program to get her out of town so that Bill would not appear weak by feeding stories that Hillary was running the White House. Her visits abroad were entirely touristic and symbolic and there was no substantive diplomacy on any of them.Bill says: "Hillary was an excellent Senator who kept fighting for Children's and Women's issues."Facts are: Other than totally meaningless legislation like changing the names on courthouses and post offices, she has passed only four substantive pieces of legislation. One set up a national park in Puerto Rico. A second provided respite care for family members helping their relatives through Alzheimer's or other conditions. And two were routine bills to aid 911 victims and responders which were sponsored by the entire N.Y. delegation. Presently she is trying to have the US memorialize Woodstock.Here is what bothers me more than anything else about Hillary Clinton. She has done everything possible to weaken the President and our Country (that's you and me) when it comes to the 'War on Terror'.1. She wants to close GITMO and move the combatants to the USA where they would have access to our legal system.2. She wants to eliminate the monitoring of suspected Al Qaeda phone calls to/from the USA.3. She wants to grant constitutional rights to enemy combatants captured on the battlefield.4. She wants to eliminate the monitoring of money transfers between suspected Al Qaeda cells and supporters in the USA.5. She wants to eliminate the type of interrogation tactics used by the Military & CIA where coercion might be used when questioning known terrorists even though such tactics might save American lives.One cannot think of a single 'Bill', Hillary has introduced or a single comment she has made that would tend to strengthen our Country in the 'War on Terror'. But, one can think of a lot of comments she has made that weaken our Country and makes it a more dangerous situation for all of us. Bottom line: She goes hand in hand with the ACLU on far too many issues where common sense is abandoned.Share this with everyone you know, ask them to prove Dick Morris wrong. Think about it - he's (Dick Morris) said all of this openly, thus if he were not truthful he'd be liable for 'Defamation of Character' !And you better believe Hillary would sue him.Her winning in 2016 means the final death knell for America! Her whole public life has been a LIE.By Dick Morris, former political advisor to President Bill ClintonTHERE ARE MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE UNAWARE OF THESE FACT.
15 | Russ Bischoff | 1 | 1560304933989531_1560330483986976 | – God bless Donald Trump for stepping up for the American People – He could be enjoying his life as a very wealthy person, but instead he's doing this. If anyone really thinks that evil-unethical-disingenuous-dishonest-power-monger Hillary Clinton is ever going to do anything to help the American People, the real American economy or the security of our country, they're sadly mistaken and delusional.Anyone with half a brain knows that we cannot trust or believe the corrupt manipulative media, who is owned and controlled by Wall Street FreeTraitors, international corporations and foreign interests that are responsible for the traitorous trade and immigration policies that have destroyed the real American economy and the economic future of the American people.Establishment puppet politicians, corrupt manipulative media pundits, Hillary trolls and their masters can put their BS in a box, gift wrap it and even put a bow on top, but most Americans can still smell what's inside.Evidently, both parties, the corrupt manipulative media and their masters just consider the American people to be collateral damage in their game of globalization and cheap wages.We obviously need new leaders who will institute trade and immigration policies that will put the best interests of our own citizens and country first and foremost, especially our veterans – And that's certainly not going to be Hillary, Kaine, Cruz, Kasich, Rubio, Kerry, Ryan, Romney or any of the other bought and paid for puppet politicians that their masters put out there for us.As it stands right now, Trump is the only real candidate out there for the American People, the real American economy and the future of our country.

Just last week when Comey announced the new investigation, he was praising the FBI and now, because there was nothing to find, it's rigged? Trump needs to grow up and stop whining and realize that no matter what he says and no matter how many lies his supporters believe, he is not now nor will he ever be fit to be the leader of the free world. I'm ready for Wednesday morning when he will be just another private citizen, although I'm sure he will cry foul play at those results as well.

That is hardly Trump’s only misdeed, but how many people realize that Donald Trump, at this moment, has 75 – SEVENTY-FIVE – legal issues hanging over his head.He’s lying 20 to 35 times a day and has his followers – and with much less excuse, the mainstream media – thoroughly distracted by the Clinton email nonstory so he can divert their attention away from his own legally questionable activities.USA TODAY reported at the end of October that “Just two weeks before Election Day, at least 75 of the 4,000-plus lawsuits involving Trump and his businesses remain open, according to an ongoing, nationwide analysis of state and federal court records by USA TODAY.”It will surprise no one, because Trump is already deadbeating on his own pollster, that “One Trump case, over non-payment of tips to caterers at Trump SoHo Hotel in New York City, is scheduled to go to trial a week before Election Day.”http://www.politicususa.com/2016/11/01/mainstream-media-ignoring-75-lawsuits-trump-focus-clinton-emails.html

12 | Shari Simpson Wilcoxon | 3 | 1560226527330705_1560267777326580 | I Just Lost All Faith In Our Deeply Corrupt Legal System And In The Rule Of Law In The United StatesPOLITICS, CRIME, CONSPIRACYby MICHAEL SNYDERThe FBI just gave Hillary Clinton the biggest gift in the history of presidential politics. Two days before the election the FBI has announced that they are ending their investigation into Hillary Clinton’s mishandling of classified information. After reviewing the emails that were found on electronic devices owned by Huma Abedin and Anthony Weiner, FBI Director James Comey sent a letter to Congress telling them that “we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton.” That means that there will be no indictment, and the path is now clear for Hillary Clinton to become the next president of the United States on Tuesday unless an election miracle happens.These days it is unusual for a news story to hit me on a deeply emotional level, but this one sure did. When the FBI originally announced that they were renewing this investigation, it gave me a glimmer of hope that there may be a little bit of integrity left in our legal system.But after today’s announcement I have lost all faith in our deeply corrupt system of justice. America has become a lawless nation, and the rule of law is completely dead in this country.Yes, it is true that those of us in the general public do not know what was contained in those emails, and Director Comey says that nothing significant was found in them…In a letter to lawmakers, Comey said the FBI is standing by its original findings, made in July, that Clinton should not be prosecuted for her handling of classified information over email as secretary of State.“The FBI investigative team has been working around the clock to process and review a large volume of emails from a device obtained in connection with an unrelated criminal investigation,” Comey said in the letter. “During that process we reviewed all of the communications that were to or from Hillary Clinton while she was secretary of State,” Comey wrote. “Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton.”But of course the truth is that the FBI already had more than enough to go after Clinton based on what they discovered the first time around.In the world of national security, if you transmit a single classified document via a channel that is unsecured, you will lose your security clearance in a heartbeat and it is quite likely that you will be prosecuted and sent to prison for mishandling classified information.In fact, two different members of the U.S. military were recently convicted for doing precisely that…Just last month, Bryan Nishimura, a California Naval reservist, was sentenced to two years’ probation and a $7,500 fine after he pleaded guilty to removing classified material and downloading it to a personal electronic device. The FBI found no evidence he planned to distribute the material.Last year, Bronze Star recipient and combat veteran Chief Petty Officer Lyle White pleaded guilty to storing classified documents on a nonsecure hard drive in Virginia. He received a suspended 60-day sentence and a suspended $10,000 fine in return for the plea. White said the information was for training purposes to study and that he had no intent to communicate with anyone.Neither of those individuals intended to mishandle classified information, and they certainly never intended to share it.But they were both convicted anyway.So what makes Hillary Clinton any different?During the initial investigation, the FBI found 113 emails that contained classified information…Clinton had repeatedly said she did not have any classified emails on her server, but the results of the FBI investigation show that claim was incorrect.Of the tens of thousands of emails investigators reviewed, 113 contained classified information, and three of those had classification markers. FBI Director James Comey has said Clinton should have known that some of the 113 were classified, but others she might have understandably missed.And I would be willing to bet that the FBI found some more classified emails that they had not seen previously among the 650,000 or so that they reviewed for this renewed investigation.But it doesn’t matter now. Hillary Clinton is free as a bird even though she mishandled 113 classified emails, and it looks like she is going to become the next president of the United States on Tuesday.As a law student and then later as an attorney working in Washington D.C., I got to see just how deeply corrupt our legal system has become.But after today, I don’t see how any American can ever have faith in the rule of law again.If the law does not apply equally to all persons at all times and in all circumstances, we might as well not even have a legal system.At this point, there is only one way that some sort of justice can be achieved in this case. And that is if the American people go to the polls on Tuesday and vote to keep her out of the White House.It won’t be perfect justice of course, but at least it would keep Hillary Clinton from getting what she wants more than anything else in life.The choice before the American people is very simple. Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt politician to ever run for the presidency, and the extremely long laundry list of Clinton scandals and crimes has been well documented over the past three decades.The voters know exactly what they are getting with her. And if they choose her anyway despite all of the things that have been revealed, that means that America is willingly choosing lawlessness.To most conservatives, this election is all about Trump, but I believe that it is far more about Hillary Clinton.I am convinced that we are at a pivotal moment in American history, and if the American people willingly choose Hillary Clinton it will be an indication that there is zero hope for the future of this nation.So let us pray for an election miracle, because right now Donald Trump is behind in most national polls and time is running out.

16 | Gigi Ballester | 10 | 1560226527330705_1560234750663216 | #NeverTrump!  The man has no moral compass. He bulliedhis brother and pushed him out of the family business, cut off medical insurance for his brother's son that was born with a  debilitating illness causing his brother's suicide. Surrounded himself with the worst people, i.e., Roy Cohn, Carl Icahn, Michael Jackson, Chris Christie. Not presidential material.
17 | Amanda Joy | 0 | 1560226527330705_1560836737269684 | What would the never Trump movement do that? If you are taking people that would vote against him and encouraging them to vote for someone other than his main opponent, isn't that giving him support.  I understand our two party system is frustrating, but this isn't the time to stand up to it with no chance of eithet 3rd party candidate winning....

If you want to say yes to all of that, if you want to keep this all the way it is, fine, then vote for Hillary Clinton. If you don’t like the way things are headed you got a chance to really shake the system the system at its roots.

He signed up to have his life dissected and torn apart. He is fighting for the American people and win or lose I will always respect him for that. I already casted my vote for him and I pray that he wins and shows the world that they were wrong about all the evil things they said about him. That he will make America Great Again for ALL Americans.

Hillary Clinton campaigned with Gold Star father Khizr Khan, who famously riled Donald J. Trump with his DNC speech questioning whether Trump had read the U.S. Constitution.

1 | Diana Stewart | 540 | 1560186897334668_1560191007334257 | Do the math! 650,000 emails and it has been 7 days since they got the search warrant. 650,000 / 7days -= 92,857 / 24 hours per day = 3,869 per hour / 60 minutes per hour = 64.5 emails per minute. SERIOUSLY, they want us to believe the professionally analyzed 64.5 emails per minute?

4 | Michael Corey Elkins | 102 | 1560186897334668_1560201607333197 | I'll correct the headline for everyone. Hillary Clinton whose campaign is unraveling in its final days is now campaigning with Saudi lawyer and Muslim Brotherhood activist Khizr Khan who's only existence known for the bravery and sacrifice of his son who was a decorated Gold Star soldier killed in action may God rest his soul and may God forgive them for using him in this way.
5 | Kate Mc Cabe | 57 | 1560186897334668_1560195940667097 | He is a muslim lawyer running a barely legal practice of giving visas to muslims and he would be out of business if Trump banned muslim immigration !  Using his sons sacrifice to further his own agenda! Disgraceful!
6 | Joe Reegz | 96 | 1560186897334668_1560190897334268 | The facts havent changed.  Hillary has recieved over $25 million dollars from Saudi Arabia.  Let's not forget that Osama Bin Laden and 15 of the 19 hijackers on 9/11 came from Saudi Arabia.  Maybe Hillary should give that money to the 9/11 victims families instead of lining her pockets. http://redcountry.com/these-4-terrorist-countries-just-donated-millions-of-dollars-to-hillarys-campaign/ #neverhillary

12 | Mario Schito Jr | 15 | 1560186897334668_1560216787331679 | Can she one time just talk about what she has done or will do for this country as president,  without bringing scorned women, family members, Jay Z, BEYONCE, beauty contestants, or any other low.lifes she can find to help distract her campaign from all the corrupt lies. And things she has done. Her whole campaign is to try to trash Trump, and only to trash Trump.Sad!
13 | April Crosby | 25 | 1560186897334668_1560210800665611 | Doesn't that man understand that Hillary is using him? She couldn't care less about his son or about veterans in general. He's a political prop for her and after the election, he'll never hear from her again.

It should be illegal for WH employees to accept donations from foreign countries!!!!!!  She is corrupt and you ARE JUST TURNING A BLIND EYE TO THAT! This alone should be enough to put her in prison! And how about that she made her maid TO PRINT OUT HER EMAILS ??! Seriously HOW CAN YOU REALLY TRUST HER? I would rather trust Trump! He is not as stupid as media portrays him! People who are voting for her are just brainwashed!
17 | Lisa Taylor | 13 | 1560186897334668_1560201173999907 | If Hillary Clinton is without guilt, then it's time to demand the FBI reverse charges on General Cartwright, Christian Saucier, and General Petraeus. It's time we DEMAND EQUALITY!
18 | Matt Furlong | 12 | 1560186897334668_1560213190665372 | Great job shaking your fist and pointing your finger. I am sure your son is proud of you for blaming a man who didn't have your sons classified info on his server letting the enemy know right where he was.
19 | Elle Dee | 11 | 1560186897334668_1560196270667064 | There was an interview with a New Yorker reporter named Malcom somebody. He pointed out that Trump had a hard on for Clinton's emails. It was a distraction ploy. Reporters did not report that Trump has a fraud charge to deal with, regarding Trump University. This reporter explained that America has a problem with sexism. Reporters failed to report Bush lost 22 million emails. It's in litigation right now. Sexism is distracting us from what is important.

A 30 year politician who has only served her own needs and carelessly disregarded the needs of the America people, our men and women in uniform and those she was sworn to protect in #Benghazi?Get out on Tuesday and vote to make America safe again, great again, and let's put a leader in the White House who will with for YOU again! #TrumpPence2016 #MAGA

2 | Robert Fleming | 963 | 1560062024013822_1560085374011487 | Nugent is as much of a loser as Trump is...maybe worse.
3 | Stacy Kay | 441 | 1560062024013822_1560094937343864 | I bet Jared from Subway, Woody Allen, Bill Cosby, the Dad from Seventh Heaven, and *Josh Duggar REALLY wanted to be there, to support Trump too. Sooooooooo TOUCHING! :/
4 | Mary Albert | 318 | 1560062024013822_1560096584010366 | LOL! That's all Trump can get? NRA gun nut Ted Nugent?  Hillary has Beyonce, Katy Perry, Bon Jovi, Bruce Springsteen, Stevie Wonder, Adele, Pharrell, Demi Lovato,  Miley Cyrus, and Lady Gaga, some of the all time greatest artists.
5 | Stephanie Lapinski Yager | 194 | 1560062024013822_1560112017342156 | Okay you are saying Ted Nugent who loves his Country and proudly  supports the second amendment. He's a rock and roll singer. Wow so let's automatically call him redneck trash. Yet Hillary has Beyoncé supporting her. Who represents Black lives matter, hate and cop killing. That's okay with liberals though. That is what's wrong with a DemocRAT though you feed them a little cheese and they will fall for any trap.
6 | Leslie Houchin | 195 | 1560062024013822_1560093854010639 | He's a moron I seen him concert and all he can talk about is hunting and killing it was a little weird I paid to hear music not him spouting off.... this was long before Trump

10 | Pam Streeter | 190 | 1560062024013822_1560085160678175 | Ted Nugent is certifiable. Bat sh*t crazy. He makes Trump look mentally balanced.
11 | Scott Swineford | 85 | 1560062024013822_863824173754397 | I'm a big fan of the Nuge. Ted is the biggest celebrity that supports the second amendment, Ted vists US Troops on regular basis, Ted has the wounded veterans at his ranches regularly,Ted Nugent camp for kids is annual event for 25 years. Ted Nugent loves his country. With some of comments I've read some stating I hope he has a hunting accident that is NOT   F/N cool. I am a hunter and I am proud to be one. To see some stupid comments like that its uncalled for. You got no clue as to how serious hunting accidents can be.
12 | Kristi Strange | 112 | 1560062024013822_1560087650677926 | We've always known Ted Nugent was a deplorable. He was just waiting for his leader.
13 | Trent Poole | 58 | 1560062024013822_863818303754984 | If you are Gay or lesbian, why would you want to vote for Hillary, when she gets millions from countries that will execute or in prison gays & lesbians?If you are Black, why are you voting for Hillary when she defends Planned Parenthood and admires Margaret Sanger, who wanted to abort as many black babies as possible and exterminate the black race, and Margaret Sanger said blacks are “morons,” “idiots,” “imbeciles,” “human weeds,” and “misfits.” Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.If you are a Woman, how can you vote for Hillary when she has buried all of Bill's rape victims under the rug. As an attorney, Hillary also defended the rapist of a 12-year old girl and laughed about it later. She plays the woman-card and acts entitled; implying that she deserves your vote merely because of her sex. How is that gender neutral?If you are a Miner, Steelworker or have a Factory job, why are you voting for Hillary when she supported NAFTA and TPP, and workers are being laid off because jobs are going overseas? She also welcomes open borders and illegals to get benefits with your tax money and compete for our jobs. Hillary boasts that under her administration miners and steelworkers will lose their jobs.If you are a Law abiding citizen, how can you vote for Hillary when she is clearly above the law? Hillary deleted thousands of secret e-mails *after* they had been subpoenaed by the courts (illegal). Hillary kept thousands of classified and top secret e-mails on her private server; servers that had less security that g-mail and Hotmail. You can be sure Russia, Iran, and China have those now. The DNC clearly broke the rules by heavy-handedly favoring Hillary over Sanders while they were still competing for the nomination.If you are a Veteran, in the military, or closely related to a military member, why are you voting for Hillary when she left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again? They called for help, but the help was told to stand down. Furthermore, Hillary wants to eliminate the NRA, take away your guns, and abolish the second amendment?Go Trump
14 | AJ Jones | 69 | 1560062024013822_1560107120675979 | Clinton just had Jay Z and Beyonce at a rally and Trump cried about it. How is this any different? A draft dodging, sexist, moronic idiot. No talent either. How embarrassing....
15 | Mike Hofer | 67 | 1560062024013822_1560105887342769 | I will vote for Trump because he is the obvious candidate over the crooked and lying Clinton.But if Ted Nugent would have run, we would have locked this thing up and Hillary would be a have been under indictment.Next time Ted. You would win by a landslide
16 | Brian Powers | 47 | 1560062024013822_863798210423660 | Yes, I'm going to cast my vote based on which candidate can get the biggest celebrities to perform at their campaigns, because you know, actual politics are pretty much a nonissue with today's populous. So Hillary has Jay-Z rapping about Niggar this and Niggar that, and Miley Cyrus flashing her body parts while calling Trump a sexist womanizer, and so on, while Trump asks the Nuge to play the National Anthem. OMG I can't decide which one would be best for our country because all these celebrities are just so overwhelming. WHO CARES WHICH CANDIDATE HAS WHICH CELEBRITY? Pay attention to the real world issues people. We're voting for the next President of the strongest nation on earth ! It's not a popularity contest. Stop proving that common sense is extinct.
17 | Dawn Cunningham Maston | 65 | 1560062024013822_1138302902926204 | All of her 'celebrities' use worse language than Trump EVER did!!! He may have said the "p" word, but Miley actually SHOWS hers on stage!!! 😂👏🏼 JayZ was dropping the f bomb and N word while Beyoncé was singing about Bills infidelity!! 😂👏🏼😂😜😂yep! Real classy! 😂😂😂evidently you aren't very old or you would see Nugent as a legend!
18 | Deborah Boatman Jackson | 40 | 1560062024013822_1342695199076577 | Ted Nugent, great job. You were not even advertised. We just saw it. Don't let these close minded people get to you. I'm sure they couldn't do what you just did. For people who claim, they want a diverse and free-thinking country they sure are mean spirited...
19 | Bj Simons | 26 | 1560062024013822_863820037088144 | Do the math everyone! 650,000 emails and it has been 7 days since they got the search warrant. 650,000 / 7days -= 92,857 / 24 hours per day = 3,869 per hour / 60 minutes per hour = 64.5 emails per minute.

20 | Glen Werline | 36 | 1560062024013822_1560107427342615 | Wonder if he could play a funeral march Wednesday morning after Trumpanzee regains consciousness, having lost the campaign?
21 | Pj Pawson | 26 | 1560062024013822_1560116364008388 | Can’t understand why anyone would want to keep the career politicians in office, they have degraded the American way of life to the point of collapse, we the people have a chance to rid our government of these power hungry elitist
22 | Brett Boring | 23 | 1560062024013822_1290821914295727 | If Trump becomes President...THINK HARD FOLKS!• The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.• The media has been neutered forever.• Career politicians will have lost all job security.• The guns in your home will safely stay there.• Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.• Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally• Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.• No more apologies to the world for being great!• Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.• Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.• There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.• The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.• The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.
23 | Renel Frazer | 35 | 1560062024013822_1342665172412913 | I thought he didn't need celebrities? He criticized Clinton for having Jay-Z and then brings out Ted Nugent. This guys is a clown
24 | Maria McConville | 20 | 1560062024013822_1138344832922011 | Woow he really does not any famous people singing with bad language!!!, he by himself fills stadiums, he, by himself has more than a half of the US people to his side.  He has all corrupt media against him, and many people who was supposed to be him, but it is ok he can making by himself!!!!
25 | Dean Mueller | 21 | 1560062024013822_1560098450676846 | Why aren't you reporting Obama encouraging illegals to vote because it's anonymous and they aren't looking for you? This is a lawless nation and you are nothing but the state media.

2 | Venita Donnellan | 148 | 1560012230685468_1560018367351521 | The vulgarity and hatred that Trump has incited and perpetuated for a year has left me questioning what kind of country we now live in. What has happened to respectful discourse ?

4 | Kay Yak | 60 | 1560012230685468_1560014800685211 | She is...a Liar,a Thief,a Murderer,a Bigotand Treasonous. She defended a child rapist and then laugh that she got him off. She has shamed all of her husbands rape victims. She has sold American favor for donations to the Clinton Foundation. She is Scum. He's an Idiot. There's no hope
5 | Ramon Cordero | 76 | 1560012230685468_1560016627351695 | So much for the so called emails scandal. Republicans were trying to find anything to see what sticks. Get over it. You got nothing on her now. She is a good person and will be your next president. Trump is a hateful, racist, arrogant, person and will never be our president. Americans want someone that represent our values. Trump does not live up to those values.
6 | Kevin George | 31 | 1560012230685468_1560019427351415 | With criminals like the Clintons running for office, who could be proud? The FBI continues to investigate the corrupt Clinton Foundation where great crimes were comimitted. Hillary will continue to be investigate for despicable crimes against humanity and our country. She only got away with email issues. They're still on her tail.
7 | Renee Michelle Dias | 21 | 1560012230685468_1560031754016849 | This election is rigged and the Liberals / Democrats such as Obama and Hillary there paying people to rig it so she can win and that is cheating and she should be disqualified for doing so . It is a huge cover up the Democrats are doing this and it is against the Law and rules they need to be punished for this wrong doing .
8 | Adam Kapps | 13 | 1560012230685468_1560039454016079 | Real Americans will feel great once it's over and the hag has lost. Then once the swamp is drained she can be charged and put in prison for the rest of her worthless life.... right next to the 0webama.
9 | Earl Lieske | 19 | 1560012230685468_1560109047342453 | I am a proud American and LOVE this country...but...BUT I cannot be proud of Trump, I cannot be proud of inaction, I cannot be proud of obstruction, I cannot be proud of blocking Supreme Court nominees, I cannot be proud of denigrating women, immigrants and gays, I cannot proud of stupidity, I cannot be proud of anything that Trump of brought to the table and what Trump has brought out of weak minded and angry Americans...I am proud of Obama and Democrats!!!  Go Dems and Hillary!!!
10 | Jessica Millikin-Newcomb | 8 | 1560012230685468_1560023760684315 | Yeah, well. We all look like a bunch of whiney babies fighting with each other over whether we should elect a sexual predator or a criminal as leader of the most powerful nation on the planet. Not much to be proud of, is it now?
11 | Alejandro Guillermo | 12 | 1560012230685468_1560017470684944 | Get over it WhAt people Americans do u just want another terror tragedy to be feeling proud Americans and til then we all Hypocrites will come together and unite!!!!Americans wake upSTOP RACISMSSTOP HATE SPREADSTOP HOMOPHOBIA STOP DISUNITY 😓😓😓🙄😨🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
12 | Shauna Dionne | 9 | 1560012230685468_1560048824015142 | Considering a large number of people in Amerikkka care more about hate than they do true issues....It's hard to be truly optimistic.I never realized how divided & different we are until this election.It's bad. Really bad.
13 | Sue Juckette Anderson | 8 | 1560012230685468_1560036244016400 | I'm proud of Hillary and ALWAYS have been. When she becomes our President you will seeMany feel the same.What she has had to endure is unbelievable! Conspiracy theories and outright lies yet she goes high when they go low!
14 | Louie Parco | 4 | 1560012230685468_1560165760670115 | How can you be proud of your country when crooked Hillary left four brave Americans to die and blamed it on a Video.Deleted thirty thousand emails and lied about it.When others were jailed for much less.
15 | Mildred Franklin | 6 | 1560012230685468_1560026107350747 | I think folks should vote go home cook a fabulous dinner, hug your kids, and pray either way it's going to be an interesting November 9th
16 | Sue Laroche | 6 | 1560012230685468_1560077667345591 | Why would we be proud.The republican party has been torn apart,The leaders have endorsed a man that is so vile ,has no morals or integrity,is racist and promotes hate and violence and still stands with him.Where did the party of Lincoln go.It started with the tea party and ended with Donald Trump.The true Republicans need to take back their party.Ryan and McConnell need to go,they put party above country.
17 | Susan L Whitesall | 3 | 1560012230685468_1560109537342404 | Yea, if your not proud of america all you have to do is read the comments on this post, YOU ARE America!!! Don't blame Washington, you voted for them, without even knowing who you voted for, especially in the mid terms. You got what you gave. And now you want to act like a bunch of fowl, angry, disrespectful citizens to each other. Throwing my hands in the air, you really just don't get it!
18 | Larry Hardee | 7 | 1560012230685468_1560033004016724 | Yes because the media has fed the hate driven by trump and the gop.How can you be proud of a party that has acted like a bunch of spoiled rich kids mad because they did not win the game.Eight years of just saying no to everything no matter how small.Traitors to the Constitution and enemies of the American people.Just my take on these ugly republicans.
19 | Jennifer Hardy | 12 | 1560012230685468_1560029894017035 | Well I will feel better if Hillary won cause it's not only time we had a female president, but also she has had the most experience and is highly qualified to improve on the economy, and get alot done as long as congress and the senate co operates. She will do great things for people with all disabilities including autism.
20 | Robert Rodel | 12 | 1560012230685468_1560014630685228 | This is just not the sentiment in America, thus is world wide. People do not want to be sheep in a globalization scheme. Leaders had better acknowledge this.
21 | Jean Bergstrom | 3 | 1560012230685468_1560061877347170 | I didn't pick him to run. He does represent a slice of America though. The evil underbelly. He gave them permission to show themselves. I'm STILL very proud of this country. Full of many great people.
22 | Chris Lapatra | 0 | 1560012230685468_1560082057345152 | Its the medias fault what ever happend to the freedom of press? The media is controlled by corporations, and the corporations control the democrats and the republicans. That's why America is so upset they thing trump and Clinton is their only choice the media doesn't mention the third party why is that? Because the third party can't be bought. They don't feed into the bribery system that the two party gang does. We need two get every single demcrat and republican out of office even though they made it almost impossible to do so the democrats put there party before country then the corporations before the people and then we might be 3rd or 4th.
23 | Christine Johnson | 1 | 1560012230685468_1160871157342794 | Trump has humiliated this country to no end, has white suprematist carrying guns and a confederate flag, threatening every class of people but his white make supporters. I assume the white suprematist bit has bitten some women because they don't seem to care he thinks is normal for men to rape women if they are around each other, talk vulgar and crude about them. Our country has a lot to be shamed about. Like to send Murdock back to Australia and send Roger Ailles and most of men at Fox News with him. They are a big part of Trump rising from their conspiracy theories
24 | Sue Berthiaume Flagg | 0 | 1560012230685468_1560120010674690 | Believe it or not, there's room in the numbers for Trump to win in Massachusetts. Clinton does not have the support of many Dems and most Independents here. If all of his MA supporters went out and voted it would overwhelm the staunch liberal vote here. Seriously. A huge reason this country has gotten to this point is voter apathy. Folks are too willing to give their vote away simply by not participating, and that goes doubly for this state. Most of MA is conservative and Independent, they're just not reliably participating in our elections because they feel it's futile in this blue state. It's not. Get out and vote!

2 | Alicia Delacruz | 247 | 1559985104021514_1559986587354699 | Can hardly wait to see the Hispanic vote statistics. I am a proud American of Hispanic decent. I truly hope the GOP learned another lesson. You can't ever win a presidential campaign based on bigotry! Just within my immediate family seven nephews and nieces will be eligible to vote in 2020. And, you can be rest assured it won't be republican...
3 | Otto Barrera | 251 | 1559985104021514_1559985630688128 | Well, have double standards at the FBI... One for Hillary and democrats and one for the rest of us. I'm thinking of changing my last name to Clinton just in case I need to get away with something in the future.
4 | M Hilal Arfeen | 185 | 1559985104021514_1559986490688042 | Monday final rally and then hillary will go to whitehouse for presidency and donald trump will go to comedy circus after bury his hatred politics forever and he will never return back,trump is a loser
5 | Afam Efuna | 142 | 1559985104021514_1559987370687954 | Breaking!!! FBI said no new contradicting emails. Now enough of those stupid email talks. Go Vote the only candidate who has the temperament and the intelligence to to be the President of this great country..Hillary Rodham Clinton 2016.
6 | Edward Ganley | 100 | 1559985104021514_1559994190687272 | WOW The Boss, and Bon Jovi, cool I would like to see that. But I would not like to hear what those dumbassses have to say about Hillary. They are good musician, but not very bright when it comes to knowing how evil Hillary is. I hopes it's like Hillary's last concert tour. The people heard the music, then got the hell out of there before Hillary started her lying speech.
7 | Karl Franzmann | 103 | 1559985104021514_1559994687353889 | Every performer with talent and a heart supports Hillary. Trump has Chachi and the duckman... People with a working brain do not vote for Trump.
8 | Caleb Price | 91 | 1559985104021514_1559993827353975 | The blind support for Hillary is mind boggling. She cares nothing about you whatsoever. Donald Trump actually employs over 35,000 people asks was one of the first to make sure women get paid the same as men in his company. Also... People actually show up to his rallies... Lol
9 | Shawn Booher | 61 | 1559985104021514_1559994750687216 | Hillary talking about one wrong moveUm like Benghazi?Or Iran?Or Syria?Or taking donations and lying about it from terrorist supporting countries ?Or accepting donations from the KKK leader in California? Or paying for your daughter's wedding with Foundation money?Or going to Orgy island 6 times?Or deleting 33k in emails illegally? Or using private server at home illegally? Or sending classified emails on unprotected server illegally?Or calling Senator Byrd one your hero's who was member of KKKOr was it calling Margaret Sanger your hero who started abortion movement in an effort to eliminate the black race?I'M CONFUSED
10 | Marc Streem | 35 | 1559985104021514_1559991980687493 | Trump is a lying deceiving manipulative Lawsuit Happy racist CONMAN who ONLY cares about Trump and can never ever be TRUSTED to be President of the United States! Comey, the FBI and CONMAN TRUMP put the BIG FIX IN! We ALL must get out and VOTE BLUE TO SAVE our great country from Trump the wannabe puppet DICTATOR!
11 | Cathy Sampson | 18 | 1559985104021514_710518782420611 | I heard Trump making fun of Hillary "needing" the help of stars like Beyoncé, JayZ, Katy Perry, Jennifer Lopez, et al. He's just jealous--all he can get is Scott Baio and Ted Nugent!!  Two washed up never-beens!
12 | Stephen Warren Goff | 30 | 1559985104021514_1559990574020967 | What a great send-off for our next President. So proud of Hillary for surviving this Repubbie nightmare of negativity. You smart and experienced. I trust you to lead!
13 | Steven Payne | 39 | 1559985104021514_1559988234021201 | Oh no!!! Now the Trumpists will say 1) He's a sell out to a criminal, 2) He was paid; 3) that she needs celebrities to help her; 4) that's he's not a great singer anyway and 5) I'll never go to his show again...did I forget anything. Trumpists are so predictable.
14 | Laura Bowser | 31 | 1559985104021514_1559989184021106 | None of them face the daily struggles most Americans do so they see nothing wrong with our system!! That's why they can back hillary....
15 | Terri Barango-Meyers | 15 | 1559985104021514_1560006604019364 | It's amazing how she needs these kind of things to pull people out. She can't do it by herself.  They said this morning,  people arent going out to see her, they are going for a free concert. They don't even stick around to listen to her.
16 | Barbara Gant | 7 | 1559985104021514_1559998307353527 | Trump supports while Hillary's last rally is going on you attend your kkk rally with David Duke and his buddy Trump dont forget to invite Putin or to bring the fuel for the cross burning!
17 | Joseph Cole III | 19 | 1559985104021514_1559989517354406 | its sad that hillary NEEDS these artist with washed up careers and actors in hollywood whos careers are fading away to help her to try n win..... Hillary for Prison 2016.
18 | Kevin Reed | 3 | 1559985104021514_710518685753954 | Let's see Bruce Springsteen,Jon bon jovi, president and Mrs. Obama with Hillary's last campaign event Trump and ted Nugent for his. Enough said.
19 | Patrick Williamson | 17 | 1559985104021514_1560018594018165 | Its pretty said rotten clinton has to throw rock concerts to attract more than 100 supporters. If you vote for this rotten criminal you are a traitor to the United States. A vote for Clinton is a vote for war.
20 | Ellen Mc Donald Mantenfel | 7 | 1559985104021514_710522985753524 | Ugh! I remember now why I don't go to see you anymore, Springsteen... Love your music, but don't go to concerts to be lectured by you about politics. Stick to the music...unless you are going into politics, I don't need schooling from the likes of you. I can make my own well-informed decisions!
21 | Terry Barton | 8 | 1559985104021514_1560001130686578 | Almost there!! I'm a little bit nervous as usual but excited and confident as Tuesday arrives.I will be delighted to see Trump and his radicalized rabidly anti-gay rightwinger Christian running mate fade away into the trash heap of failed candidates.
22 | Susan Gradick | 10 | 1559985104021514_1560007557352602 | Ramon Cordero I got a couple of words for ya - Benghazi and full term abortion. Or how did the Clinton's make all those millions? She a proven liar. She thinks she is above the law.
23 | Jon Patt | 45 | 1559985104021514_1559985604021464 | Funny how having entertainers is the only way Clinton can get people to attend her rallies.
24 | Maryann Klimas | 9 | 1559985104021514_1559996924020332 | Hey! So very glad that you are supporting Hillary and will be at Hillary's final rally, the saying goes last is the BEST thank you Bruce for your support!
25 | Esther Moore | 4 | 1559985104021514_710516992420790 | I was asked how I could ever support Trump, after the comments he made over 11 yrs ago about women and if I would still support him if he made those comments to my daughter? My response was this......If he had put our nations security at risk, I would not vote for him. If his organization received large donations from countries that killed women and gays, I would not vote for him. If he boasted 30 yrs of government experience, but still could not discern if an email was classified or not, without someone letting him know if it was or not, I would not vote for him. If he boasted about how he has defended children his entire life, but is for abortion,(even late term, when the child can feel pain) I would not vote for him. If he caused lives to be destroyed in Benghazi and then lied to the faces of the parents as they stood at their child's casket, I would not vote for him. If people who came against him mysteriously turned up dead, I would note vote for him. If he suddenly developed a southern accent when he was in the South, campaigning, I would not vote for him. If he continually broke the law and that was ignored, I would not vote for him, but right now, the ONLY person who does ALL these things is Hillary. Right now, the fact that Donald made these remarks over 11yrs ago, does not move me. I'm bigger than those remarks and we all have said stupid things throughout our lives. To me, the fact Hillary lies continuously, is a much bigger problem. We can see the effects of her lies by the State of our poor country right now...Rant over... I'm still voting for Trump. Copy/Paste from a Fellow Deplorable....

2 | Jennifer Hajdics | 82 | 1559962847357073_1559964197356938 | Imagine this:In the White House Situation Room, a huge covert military op is is progress. Lives of our servicemen are at stake, timing is critical. The military official asks President Trump what his order is......and he can't answer until someone explains what's happening because he was elected having ZERO experience and ZERO qualifications to do the job. And people end up dead. Trump is unfit in every way to lead this country. You hate Hillary Clinton? Fine. Hate her, but don't be blind to the fact that she's the only candidate who DOES have the experience and qualifications to lead this country.
3 | Carol Wiese | 31 | 1559962847357073_1559969247356433 | What I get from the article is that the 23% cited are delusional and shouldn't be allowed in public much less vote.

If people who came against him mysteriously turned up dead, I would not vote for him. If he suddenly developed a southern accent when he was in the South, campaigning, I would not vote for him. If he continually broke the law and that was ignored, I would not vote for him, but right now, the ONLY person who does ALL these things is Hillary. Right now, the fact that Donald made these remarks over 12 years ago, does not move me. I'm bigger than those remarks and we all have said stupid things throughout our lives. To me, the fact that Hillary lies continuously, is a much bigger problem. We can see the effects of her lies by the state of our poor country right now... Rant over..
6 | Michael Bergens | 6 | 1559962847357073_1559967160689975 | All this toxicity is artificial and barely exists outside media outlets and partisan bickering online. We are all Americans, we all want our country remain strong, powerful -- the "shiny house up on the hill." We all want to leave a better place for our children than we had when we grew up. We do not have that many differences to hate each other with so much twang. Notice that the people portrayed as opposite sides by the media, are friends in real life. George W. Bush and Obamas are friends, especially with Michelle. Google up all the pictures of Clintons and Trump together... It's all bunk, folks.
7 | Montzalee Wittmann | 4 | 1559962847357073_1559982764021748 | who are the delusional people that think this brought us together? really? one side calling everyone but white men names? one side trying to suppress votes of the other? one calling his opponent names and calling out supporters to create violence to his opponent? one side saying he wants to go against the law if he is president and jail the other? Really? how is this bringing the country together? how is this bringing the world together? the whole world is worried about this election!
8 | Nick Kilday | 1 | 1559962847357073_1560625820624109 | We are all doomed if that woman becomes our commander in chief. And i mean DOOMED. And as a patriot and a person who has spent his whole life volunteering to protect the country just like thousands of my brothers and sisters do, i gotta say it is disgusting to watch what this vountry has bevome over the last decade. That woman has more skeletons in her closet than most of her supporters know about. You take away the plan to increase minimum wage and give money back to the real working men and women in our country things wont be that bad. But it still makes me sick to see everyone against each other. Our nation needs a strong willed ready to fix the nation economically leader. And were electing someone that i dont trust in that seat. #makeamericagreatagain.
9 | Tony Masiero | 14 | 1559962847357073_1559969517356406 | I thought this election was for presidency. not bashing each other. people these days. you did this he did that. what about us folks who just want to work. go home have a good life. not hard. so come on.
10 | Vincent G. Brackett | 0 | 1559962847357073_1559993240687367 | This country is fractured right down the middle.. I have my doubts that it will ever recover or work together again... Congress (both House and Senate), Judicial, and Executive Branch are all broken.  None know how to govern...In addition, Media is also broken. I no longer trust or have any confidence in any of these branches. or the media..
11 | Joey Jordan | 0 | 1559962847357073_1560645837288774 | Jennifer I am not going to get deep in to that statement you said about Hillary's qualification's compared to Trump but I will say a little. One Obama had the same amount of qualification's coming in to office as President as Trump does he only was a Senator for about five years. And when it comes to Obama that is all I am going to say for now Two when it comes to Hillary's qualification's got two things to say one "Benghazi" two the law for her server that the FBI says no prosecutor would take the case is a lie prosecutors have taken cases with less evidence and put people in jail for less. And some people are still in Jail for doing it.
12 | David Sammy Jr. | 13 | 1559962847357073_1559976510689040 | Trump and his divisiveness has divided the country more than ever,Trump has brought alot of hate, fear mongering, innuendos and lies into this election his behavior is unprecedented..
13 | Mary Ryles | 2 | 1559962847357073_1560014247351933 | I think that people who think anything is going to get better no matter who wins is fooling themselves..with a few small periods of time nothing does get better..hasn't sense the two party's has gained enough power to kill any other party..throw in the vote for me because the other candidate is evil instead of vote for me because I have a plan and here it is then how could it.  I bet you in four years..you will be in the same place or worse off and repeating the same opinions the only difference will be the candidates names.
14 | Mary Ryles | 2 | 1559962847357073_1559993404020684 | The damage this election has done to an already divided population and throw in all the economic ills will put us a path not seen sense pre civil war days...I think no matter who wins they will not be able to heal anything and the next four years will determine if we are on a fixed path or not.
15 | Annetta Hurley Jutila | 3 | 1559962847357073_1559991367354221 | No it started 8 years ago when President Obama was elected the house and senate did not want him to succeed so did every thing they could to defeat him , so it starated back then when they wouldn't go up against the birthers and looked the other way, refused to fill supreme court and now saying if Hillary wins they won't let her appoint , put the blame where it deserves to be
16 | Jonathan Bautista | 2 | 1559962847357073_1559990534020971 | Hey, US politics is divided in the first place!!.. Democrats/Republicans/Independents(Some).. and we will have a divided/Branched Govt., because it is Good for Check and Balance.. we are Divided in views, political affiliation, etc.. but we are always United in case other Nation attacked Us..It's The Media that actually Dangerously divides us, for Ratings!!..
17 | Eric Douglas Jr. | 1 | 1559962847357073_1560123757340982 | Black people supported bill Clinton when he cheated on his wife. Smfh now we supporting Clinton because she needs our vote and nobody wants to vote for trump. After its clear she didn't do anything to prevent or help in Benghazi and dumped all her emails on a private server. We support criminals and that's what we've been doing.
18 | Lawrence V. Gibson | 2 | 1559962847357073_1560010410685650 | Divided is an understatement. This country will never be the same. If Killary gets elected it might go straight down the tubes. It won't happen without a fight .
19 | Tony Robles | 2 | 1559962847357073_1560000557353302 | It is not over. I understand, the GOP does not endorse Trump but still will vote Republican. I'd like to see how that's going to work out Trump in the WH...the hate and the crying will continue till he gets impeached. If you think we are the laughing matter around the world now, we will hear it loud and clear then!!
20 | Carla Bolling Williams | 0 | 1559962847357073_1560182097335148 | The rhetoric and tone of one particular campaign has really made me angry. It's uncalled for and hateful. It will take a long time for America to get over this because the mistrust of others this campaign has created is real.
21 | Nick A Partida | 1 | 1559962847357073_1559994654020559 | The country has been divided for a long time, pretty much since we first began as a country.  All that's occurred is that this election made the division apparent.  Which is great,  it's easier to fix a cut you can see.
22 | John Chmielowicz | 1 | 1559962847357073_1560009904019034 | Since Obama has been President Republicans have failed to earn their pay by not confirming many judges and other appts that need to be filled. Supreme Court needs 9 justices too.to function. No jobs bills have been passed by them either/ Vote out the rethugs who only help themselves.
23 | Gaines Liner | 0 | 1559962847357073_1559982114021813 | Divide the country into two separate countries. The liberals can have their open borders and free stuff and the conservative can have their secure borders and personal responsibility for the stuff they want. We have literally bankrupted ourselves trying to remove the consequences of the poor decisions that people make. We'd all be better off if we didn't subsidize bad personal choices, but here we are.
24 | Roy Nadeau | 2 | 1559962847357073_1559970617356296 | Hey Dummy Caps remember this simple thing, if HRC could not go through three debates against Trump without cheating how will she survive four years in the oval office?  Better yet how can we trust she isn't cheating in this election?
25 | Ron Elmore | 1 | 1559962847357073_1560028264017198 | Even if she wins , it won't be the landslide she wanted!!! I don't like her at all and this election has divided us for sure. My guess is there will be unrest and precincts will be counting for days . Just pray for the best.

Shutter | 0 | 1559937587359599_1559955200691171 | RADICAL LIBERAL DEMOCRATTACTICS, LIES, FAKE POLLS• MAINSTREAM MEDIA is involved in blatant lies regarding the polls stating Hillary Clinton is ahead of Donald Trump, by 4 Points! ……………FALSE! Donald Trump is WAY AHEAD of Hillary Clinton in the polls and he is getting a LOT more votes than she is! HAVE YOU SEEN THE TURNOUT at his RALLIES?? He is getting upwards of 45,000 to 65,000 people at his rallies and Hillary is barely batting 3,000 to 7,000! What does that tell you??• Hillary Clinton and Barrack Obama are shouting out all sorts of FAKE lies about Donald Trump, when the SAD REALITY is THEY ARE TWO OF THE MOST DESPICABLE HUMAN BEINGS ON THIS PLANET and THEY WANT TO DESTROY WHAT AMERICA IS ALL ABOUT! It’s SICKENING WHAT THEIR EVIL AGENDA IS!• Hillary Clinton has been involved in CORRUPTION and CRIMINAL ACTIVITY for 30+ YEARS IN GOVERNMENT, and NOW SHE IS ASKING FOR YOUR VOTE?? WOW! UNBELIEVABLE! CANNOT IMAGINE ANYONE in their right mind, voting for her.• Hillary Clinton PAID certain people and also BLACK LIVES MATTER to disrupt and cause VIOLENCE and PROTESTS at various Donald Trump rallies and her mentor, George Soros is certainly involved in this ILLEGAL FUNDING, that in itself is a FELONY.• Hillary Clinton is using the “first female president card” just like when OBAMA used the “first black president card” in order to try and WIN! FOLKS THAT’S A SMOKESCREEN and DOES NOT hide the facts, she is CORRUPT and EVIL as OBAMA is! A POLITICAL STRATEGY GONE WRONG!• HILLARY CLINTON and GEORGE SOROS, “paid off” certain woman to come out of the shadows and make these FALSE groping and grabbing claims at Donald Trump. The REALITY IS IT NEVER HAPPENED AND SHE SHOULD TALK! Former President Bill Clinton is a RAPIST and a SEXUAL PEDOPHILE, a REALLY SICK INDIVIDUAL, WITH A NASTY SEXUAL ADDICTION! IT’S A PROVEN FACT, BUT HILLARY WAS SUCCESSFUL IN COVERING UP OR SUPPRESSING THESE FACTS! Ask Paula Jones, Monica Lewinsky to name only a couple!• George Soros OWNED voting machines are RIGGED to SWITCH VOTES and some polling places that accept PAPER MAIL IN BALLOTS are RIPPING THEM UP and THROWING THEM AWAY if the ballots contain Donald Trump selected as PRESIDENT! THAT IS ELECTION FRAUD and BE SURE THERE WILL BE AN INVESTIGATION INTO THAT CRIME!Donald Trump loves AMERICA and he ONLY wants what’s BEST for America. Hillary Clinton just wants the MONEY and POWER. That’s ALL she cares about FOLKS! She is merely a PUPPET of the EVIL ZIONIST ILLUMINATI SECRET SOCIETY AND SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS!

"Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton," FBI Director James Comey wrote.

4 | Genie Mansy | 1003 | 1559896057363752_1559897070696984 | FBI Director James Comey just released a letter to congress that says the FBI stands by their findings back in July, that she did not do anything criminal.VOTE BLUE 💙!Stronger Together!❤️💙🇺🇸..,Never Loser trump has preached hate .. Never Loser trump is a big  Bully.. Never Loser trump is A sexual predator.. Never Loser trump Loves war.. ..!  Wants boots on the ground! Never Loser trump spread hate ..  like cancer.. Neighbours hating each other ! Never Loser trump continue to encourage violence.. Even The GOP senators also has encourage violence.. Soooo what are we to think! I not making these things up! Do your research and ! Stop GOP! Vote Blue 💙..Stop the violence.
5 | Neil Wescott | 706 | 1559896057363752_1559902534029771 | Ok I'll lay this out there for some folks..you've got a serviceman doing 6 YEARS at a fed prison for taking pics in a sub...and now we have EVIDENCE of corruption at the highest order..and we get told "move along folks nothing to see here" it's no wonder why people have such disrespect for the rule of law of the United States government when they CAN'T even follow their own law SMDH
6 | Aguila J. Rafael | 716 | 1559896057363752_1559896120697079 | Still makes me mad that Comey intervened and ruined the huge win Hillary would have had. She is still going to win but I don't think she will get the electoral college victory I wanted.
7 | Stan Giudici | 437 | 1559896057363752_690754961093613 | Seriously? It took the FBI over a year to investigate over 30,000 emails, and we are to believe that in two weeks they reviewed over 650,000 emails?!  These days, I can't believe anything that comes out of Washington. Corruption.
8 | Cameron Robertson | 330 | 1559896057363752_1350405684991827 | As an outsider (Canadian), I thought the FBI was supposed to be neutral and on the side of the law...period. Reopening a shut case 2 weeks before the election, and then shutting it again with just 2 days to go? Something's not right here. The Director, or whomever reopened the case, should have their job performance put up for review.
9 | Jill McNeely | 374 | 1559896057363752_1559904274029597 | James Comey is a coward, bought and paid for by the Clinton Foundation. I'm sure they have used their scare tactics. I hope if Donald is elected, he cleans house!

The Trump campaign is not based on any reality and this is now confirmed and any talk of a future impeachment or indictment is a total fallacy and this matter is dead!
11 | Beth Davis Lambert | 333 | 1559896057363752_1559909250695766 | It is sad that the people that love Hillary are so misinformed. They see the surface...she has been in the public eye for so long that they just believe her. Clintons are corrupt look at the facts people.

13 | Beata Ballo Jd | 155 | 1559896057363752_1867817870114972 | Imagine it is November 9, 2016 in America and we wake up knowing who our new President will be. If it is Hillary, think of the groups of people that will celebrate. Illegal Immigrants, criminals and future criminals who will be supported for pulling a gun on a police officer, planned parenthood, the media, and the list goes on and on that represent everything that is wrong with America. If you're still "with her," look around at who you'll be celebrating with. Now imagine waking up knowing that Trump is our new President. You may or may not like him, or really know what kind of president he will be. But here are some things you will know for sure:• The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.• The media has been neutered forever.• Career politicians will have lost all job security.• The guns in your home will safely stay there.• Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.• Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally• Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.• No more apologies to the world for being great!• Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.• Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.• There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.• The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.• The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.Copy and paste this as your status if you support and will vote Donald Trump for president 2016. #trump2016.REASONS TO NOT VOTE HILLARY⚠️If you are Gay, Why are you voting for Hillary when she wants to bring in thousands of refugees that believe all Gays should be executed?👁⚠️If you are Black, Why are you voting for Hillary when she admires Margaret Sanger and defends Planned Parenthood who want to abort as many black babies as possible? Exterminate the black race because they are like "weeds". (Margaret Sanger quote) Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.👁⚠️If you are a Christian, Why are you voting for Hillary Clinton when she wrote her Senior thesis on Saul Alinsky who dedicated his book 'Rules for Radicals' to Lucifer (the Devil)? She says he was, and still is her mentor.👁⚠️If you are a Veteran, in the Military, or closely related to a Military member, Why are you voting for Hillary when she left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again? They called for help but the help was told to stand down.👁⚠️If you have a factory job, Why are you voting for Hillary when she supported TPP? Factory workers are being laid off because jobs are going over seas. Don't forget the deals she's made with china. She also welcomes open borders and illegals to get benefits to be paid with Your tax money.👁⚠️If you are poor, Why are you voting for Hillary, when she is supporting Wall street and all the big banks? Big banks keep poor people poor by destroying the poor man's credit by allowing medical bills and collections to affect your credit scores so you can pay higher interest rates than the rich; Taking much of the little money you earn.👁⚠️If you are a Woman, how can you vote for Hillary when she has buried all of Bills rape victims under the rug, including that little girl that was raped? Lawyer Hillary defended the rapist, and then she laughed about it later, knowing that he was guilty.If you carry a gun, or believe in the Constitution; How can you vote for Hillary when she wants to eliminate the NRA, Take your guns, and abolish the second Amendment?👁⚠️If you breathe, Why would you vote for Hillary when she and the Clinton crime family have left a trail of dead people that did not agree with her, or they knew too much?Who is left? 👁 please cut and paste on your wall if you agree.

18 | Mark Morgan | 99 | 1559896057363752_1350512864981109 | Wow....it took months and months to go through tens of thousands of emails and find multiple violations of security protocols...but it only took 10 days to go through 650,000 emails and find NO issues.....very doubtful boys and girls!
19 | Kimberly Nicole Seier | 113 | 1559896057363752_1350403721658690 | All this proves is Comey is useless and clearly afraid to do his job properly.

20 | Jennifer Hajdics | 105 | 1559896057363752_690750057760770 | Imagine this:In the White House Situation Room, a huge covert military op is is progress. Lives of our servicemen are at stake, timing is critical. The military official asks President Trump what his order is......and he can't answer until someone explains what's happening because he was elected having ZERO experience and ZERO qualifications to do the job. And people end up dead. Trump is unfit in every way to lead this country. You hate Hillary Clinton? Fine. Hate her, but don't be blind to the fact that she's the only candidate who DOES have the experience and qualifications to lead this country.
21 | Tim Banes | 113 | 1559896057363752_1350411941657868 | I was asked how I could ever support Trump? My response was this....If he had put our nations security at risk, I would not vote for him. If his organization received large donations from countries that killed innocent men, women , I would not vote for him. If he boasted 30 Years of government experience, but still could not discern if an email was classified or not, without someone letting him know if it was or not, I would not vote for him. If he boasted about how he has defended children his entire life, but is for abortion, (even late term, when the child can feel pain) I would not vote for him. If he wanted little girls  (children)  to go to restrooms with grown adult men dressed as women, I would not vote for him. If he caused lives to be destroyed in Benghazi and then lied to the faces of the parents as they stood at their child's casket, I would not vote for him. If people who came against him mysteriously turned up dead, I would not vote for him. If he suddenly developed a southern accent when he was in the South, campaigning, I would not vote for him. If he continually broke the law and that was ignored, I would not vote for him, but right now, the only person who does all these things is Hillary. To me, the fact that Hillary lies continuously, is a much bigger problem. We can see the effects of her lies by the state of our poor country right now... Rant over... Still voting for Trump, DRAIN THE SWAMP.
22 | Dafne Brooks | 91 | 1559896057363752_690754997760276 | The FBI may not have done anything...but we the people now know what a POS liar you are and just how despicable you truly are Hillary Clinton! #neverhillary #trump2016
23 | Dawn Laughlin Cabrera | 81 | 1559896057363752_1867818826781543 | He didn't say the FBI found no criminality. He said "Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton." That's different than finding no criminality. NBC is so slanted. Plus, how did they read 650,000 emails that quickly? It took months to read 55,000 and a huge chunk of those had to first go to various agencies to determine if they contain classified information. Why is no one questioning how reading 650,000 emails and determining their content happened so fast.
24 | Debra Palumbo | 89 | 1559896057363752_690770334425409 | I thought it was going to take weeks to investigate some 650,000 emails on Huma and Anthony's computer!  WE NEED TO DRAIN THE SWAMP!!!
25 | Jose Danilo Portillo | 94 | 1559896057363752_690748241094285 | The best feeling in the world will be when all Republicans get to see another Democrat win the white house for another 4 years.

3 | Karla Matthews | 65 | 1559875764032448_1559886840698007 | Biden, you made to many trips to pedophile island on the Lolita Express. The only line you'll be crossing over is from freedom to lock up. Enjoy your stay in federal prison.

5 | Travis America | 40 | 1559875764032448_1559923620694329 | From a concerned citizen overseas:. Americans, don't be discouraged. Hillary Clinton is too big to go down alone. The elites know that. Please Take back your country and make it great again. Vote Donald Trump for president.

7 | Simmert Albert | 17 | 1559875764032448_1559888667364491 | At this point I will not vote but will say that if Hillary wins or not she should be brought up on charges and fully investigated by a neutral party.
8 | Miranda Kipp | 11 | 1559875764032448_1559964734023551 | Bill Clinton cheats on his wife. Impeach him. Trump proudly brags about sexual assault (and has cheated on his wives). Elect him. Hillary oversaw the department of state while 4 people died in an embassy attack. Put her in jail. 2 Republicans were in office while over 200 people died in embassy attacks. No problem. Immigrants don't pay taxes. Round them up and kick them out. Trump doesn't pay taxes. He's a business genius. Hillary's foundation only spent 87% of their donations helping people. She's a crook. Trumps foundation paid off his debts, bought sculptures of him, and made political donations to avoid investigations while using less than 5% of funds for charity (and he got shut down by NY State).  So savvy... Put him in the white house. Trump made 4 billion dollars in 40 years, when an index fund started at the same time with the same "small loans" he received would be worth $12 billion today... without a trail of bankruptcies, thousands of lawsuits and burned small business owners. He's a real business whiz. Hillary took a loss of $700k. She's a criminal. Trump is the first candidate in the modern era not to release his tax returns, and took a billion dollar loss in 1 year. Genius. Hillary takes responsibility for private email servers and apologizes. Not credible. Trump denies saying things (on the record) he actually said (on the record), he's just telling it like it is. Your arguments are thin. Your ignorance of reality is shocking. Your double-standards are offensive, and your willingness to blindly support him and recycle the rhetoric is absurd. Your opinion is not fact. Your memes are not news articles. And your hypocrisy is not a platform.#trumpisapieceofshit
9 | Sande Miller-Long | 13 | 1559875764032448_1559921077361250 | Trump supporters, just once back up all your condemation of Hillary with actual, real bona-fide evidence that supports your conspiracy rants. Prove something, anything or shut up.
10 | Will McGinnis | 15 | 1559875764032448_1559877900698901 | The FBI announced that their original position from July will stand... there will be no charges against Clinton regarding the new email issues

13 | Millan Sanchez | 5 | 1559875764032448_1559947787358579 | The AP is reporting Melania Trump worked in the US as an illegal. This violates immigration law making her ineligible for citizenship. Yes her citizenship will be revoked....
14 | Chris Bailiff | 3 | 1559875764032448_1559981197355238 | I would imagine Biden feels that if he doesn't stump emotionally one of those untimely clinton associate suicides might hit close to home.
15 | Genie Mansy | 7 | 1559875764032448_1559917467361611 | FBI Director James Comey just released a letter to congress that says the FBI stands by their findings back in July, that she did not do anything criminal.VOTE BLUE 💙!Stronger Together!❤️💙🇺🇸..,Never Loser trump has preached hate ..

18 | Mike Teguawaku | 0 | 1559875764032448_1560120227341335 | How is it that we spent millions on the investigation into someone who clearly broke the law, and yet they can't be convicted. Even with a handful of reps in office investigating and pushing for this, the law has yet to be upheld. If this was a common man or woman, they'd be punished in a heart beat. Yet Clinton for some reason is and always will be above the law.
19 | Elke Hassell | 0 | 1559875764032448_1560540977299260 | REMEMBER WHEN BILL CLINTON WAS PRESIDENT?(January 20, 1993 to January 20, 2001—two terms)When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over an attempt to reform health care.Her proposed plan was so bad that many Democrats came up with competing plans of their own in protest, and in spite of threats and intimidation, on September 26, 1994, the “Hillarycare” bill was declared dead.This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million for studies, promotion, and other efforts.Then, President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general. Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood—both were forced to withdraw their names from consideration.Next, she chose Janet Reno, which husband Bill described as "my worst mistake."(Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.)Husband Bill also allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission—Lani Guanier was her selection.After considerable backlash from prominent Democratic senators concerning Ms. Guanier's radical views, Bill Clinton withdrew her name from nomination, stating that she did not represents the civil rights views that he had championed during his campaign.However, apparently a slow learner, husband Bill continued to allow Hillary to make more recommendations.She chose former law partners, Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department.Her selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kennedy was forced to resign.(Is anyone wondering yet what her Supreme Court Justice appointments would be like?)Many younger voters will have no knowledge of "Travelgate," the first major ethics controversy during Bill’s presidency.Hillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend, Harry Thompson—but the White House Travel Office refused to comply.She trumped up allegations of financial mismanagement and reported seven long-time White House employees to the FBI. This ruined their reputations, got them fired, and caused a thirty-six month investigation.Eventually, most of the employees were reinstated and Clinton associates were forced out of the travel office. Only one White House employee, Billy Dale, was charged with a crime—the enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds; a jury acquitted him in less than two hours.Still not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House Security.When Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies (Filegate) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff, suddenly Hillary and the President denied even knowing Livingstone, and of course, denied knowledge of drug use in the White House.Following this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents.Next, when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by Bill Clinton, Hillary was put in charge of the "bimbo eruption" and scandal defense.Let’s look at some of her more notable decisions in this regard . . .She urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation, they settled with Ms. Jones.She refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor.After $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr's investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs.Hillary's devious game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for 'lying under oath' to a grand jury, followed by his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives.Hillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, "I do not recall," "I have no recollection," and "I don't know" a total of 56 times while under oath. (Sound familiar?)After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had "mistakenly thought was hers."So you see, the email scandal and all of her malfeasance regarding the handling of Top Secret information, not to mention the "pay to play" schemes of the Clinton Foundation, are nothing new.
20 | Roy Lamberson | 5 | 1559875764032448_1559882930698398 | Have you ever talked to a random person about who they're voting for? It's crazy how some respond. Zero research and based on male or female. Or running with  misinformation as truth. We're in trouble this time around.
21 | Renee Michelle Dias | 3 | 1559875764032448_1559993524020672 | This election is rigged and the Liberals / Democrats such as Obama and Hillary there paying people to rig it so she can win and that is cheating and she should be disqualified for doing so . It is a huge cover up the Democrats are doing this and it is against the Law and rules they need to be punished for this wrong doing .
22 | Olivia Triplett Wright | 2 | 1559875764032448_1559942780692413 | I was asked tonight how I could ever support Trump after the comments he made over 11 years ago about women and if I would still support him if he made those comments to my daughter? My response was this....If he had put our nations security at risk, I would not vote for him. If his organization received large donations from countries that killed women and gays, I would not vote for him. If he boasted 30 Years of government experience, but still could not discern if an email was classified or not, without someone letting him know if it was or not, I would not vote for him.

If he continually broke the law and that was ignored, I would not vote for him, but right now, the ONLY person who does ALL these things is Hillary. Right now, the fact that Donald made these remarks over 12 years ago, does not move me. I'm bigger than those remarks and we all have said stupid things throughout our lives. To me, the fact that Hillary lies continuously, is a much bigger problem. We can see the effects of her lies by the state of our poor country right now... Rant over..

And then you welcome hundred of thousands immigrants to US who fight for the remaining jobs. Meaning you lost job has for second time. It list you have been punished for nothing. That's absolutely nuts.
