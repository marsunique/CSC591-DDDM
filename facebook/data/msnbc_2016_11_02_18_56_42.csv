The Hardball with Chris Matthews panel discuss some new reporting on what Russia is up to. 

It's troubling stuff.

1 | Linda Tomasello | 57 | 1340085666087682_1340088589420723 | Of course they're interfering. They've hacked only into DNC emails. And even if the nectarine nightmare didn't tell the world how great a guy He thinks Putin is, he went on national television an egged them on to hack a govt officials emails!
2 | Rob Visconti | 52 | 1340085666087682_1340086179420964 | Gov Bill Weld basically just told Libertarians or protest voters to vote for Hillary Clinton rather than him and Johnson on the The Rachel Maddow Show. He acknowledged that the Libertarians cannot win and that the risk of throwing the election to what he described as a national threat if Trump were to be President was too great. He vouched for Hillary Clinton as a highly moral person and exceptional leader from his decades long relationship personally and professionally working with Hillary. He described Comey's letter as unacceptable and that there is nothing in the emails that he never even read to warrant ever insinuating there is. #VoteClintonKaine2016 #VoteDemocratUpAndDownBallot #NeverPutinTrumpPence
3 | Blake Duescher | 9 | 1340085666087682_1340095802753335 | What a joke ignore all the wiki leaks and the proven rigging by the dnc and stealing the primary from Bernie . But he dosnt care they paid him off and he's fine selling out.... Funny you don't care one bit
4 | Lisa Beckman-Roulst | 4 | 1340085666087682_1340109762751939 | I think it's an obvious YES at this point. Trump is going to have this country, the world, and all of us humans in it, in very serious trouble, far far deeper than anyone could imagine. We should all be extremely concerned with letting this monster be in control of us and our lives.
5 | Valire Davis Orr | 4 | 1340085666087682_1340100746086174 | MSNBC... why are you guys not talking about Trump's upcoming CHILD RAPE trial??NOTHING in the world is worse than a child being raped; they live with that & go through HELL for the rest of their lives. ~ Nothing Hillary has done is worse than the THOUSANDS of things that Trump has done since the 1960's.
6 | Karry Ann Mykonos | 1 | 1340085666087682_1340097932753122 | Stop the Election it is corrupt but no the powers that be will let it continue. All this moaning, whinging and whining about what each candidate has done in the past and what they are capable of if made President is a insult to people's intelligence. Never has there been such a shambles in the history of voting for an American leader. Just continue down this road to no where and the world is in big trouble. Shame on every one for allowing it to continue. A few more days to go before disaster strikes America no matter who you vote for. Give the job to Mrs Michelle Obama that way we might keep the peace on this God forsaken planet.
7 | Wise George | 1 | 1340085666087682_1340122136084035 | You people on MSNBC throw little lines out that actually say nothing. Trump and America is what is important for the next few days. Trump winning and nothing MSNBC can do to slow him and the American people down. People do not trust Main Stream bull anymore.
8 | Serrell Law | 0 | 1340085666087682_1340122316084017 | We already know they are and Comey does too but he won't say anything for fear of influencing the election. That's a joke since he had no issue releasing what he did not know about some emails and he still knows nothing.

10 | Ali Bomaye | 2 | 1340085666087682_1340089869420595 | Well according to the Republicans who run the Congress and the FBI would tell you there's nothing to see here, go check her emails. How stupid are some Democrats to buy into this. You better go & vote or you will cry to sleep when the Republicans drop the email case on Nov 9th
11 | Dennis G. McAuliffe | 1 | 1340085666087682_1340100032752912 | It's hard to understate how out of the political norm it is for a major party's presidential candidate and suppoters to embrace a foreign strongman who is a hostile aggressor toward the United States.It's especially given the atrocities Putin has unleashed upon his own country.according to YouGov’s polling, Putin’s favorability rating among Republican voters in the US — while still quite negative — has sharply improved since 2014.The change appears to have occurred almost entirely among voters who say they supported Donald Trump in the primaries. Trump primary voters give Putin a net favorability of -23, while GOP primary voters who say they supported another candidate give Putin a much worse net favorability rating of -61.In studies of psychological profiles of individual voters characterized by a desire for order and a fear of outsiders,  people who score high in authoritarianism, when they feel threatened, look for strong leaders who promise to take whatever action necessary to protect them from outsiders and prevent the changes they fear.A polling of a large sample of likely voters, looking for correlations between support for Trump and views that align with authoritarianism found that not onlyauthoritarianism correlated, but it predict support for Trump more reliably than virtually any other indicator.Authoritarians are thought to express much deeper fears than the rest of the electorate, to seek the imposition of order where they perceive dangerous change, and to desire a strong leader who will defeat those fears with force. They would thus seek a candidate who promised these things. And the extreme nature of authoritarians' fears, and of their desire to challenge threats with force, would lead them toward a candidate whose temperament was totally unlike anything we usually see in American politics — and whose policies went far beyond the acceptable norms.

15 | George Samuel | 3 | 1340085666087682_1340092116087037 | Somewhere right now there is a liberal complaining about "inequality" and "social injustice" and how can so many people be so racist? 😂😂😂

17 | Rhoda Robinson Brown | 7 | 1340085666087682_1340086989420883 | Donald Trump said that he’s never spoken to Vladimir Putin and knows nothing about him. But in 2013, he was singing a far different tune.In an interview three years ago, MSNBC’s Thomas Roberts asked him, “Do you have a relationship with Vladimir Putin? A conversational relationship or anything that you feel you have sway or influence over his government?”Trump declared, “I do have a relationship and I can tell you that he’s very interested in what we’re doing here today He’s probably very interested in what you and I am saying today, and I’m sure he’s going to be seeing it in some form.”.•Why would he lie about this when asked during the debate?Trump is the true danger to our National Security.Bet this is why he won't show his tax returns.This interview was 3 years ago while in Russia for his Miss Universe Pageant.Guess his real connections and his dealings would show in the returns.No wonder he says it's under audit without any proof except what he says.And lately what he says has been lies
18 | Eddie Kulczyk | 3 | 1340085666087682_1340096236086625 | If Russia has the ability to "mess with the US election", that really does show how weak this country has become.
19 | Gabriel James | 2 | 1340085666087682_1340096512753264 | The NY Times put out an article a few days ago saying there are no ties between Trump and Russia. http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/01/us/politics/fbi-russia-election-donald-trump.html
20 | Entivio O'Reilly | 1 | 1340085666087682_1340095539420028 | On a good note I find it ironic that the World Series will be decided at "progressive field"

23 | Douglas Flynt | 0 | 1340085666087682_1340117236084525 | If the State Run Corrupt Liberal Media rubber stamps the claims of Corrupt Democrats, you can rest assured that Russia had no hand in this. Count on it.
24 | Tom Lockyer | 2 | 1340085666087682_1340094919420090 | OMG, Hillary out of her own mouth says she will create a NO FLY ZONE over Syria. Russia is flying Syria and will continue. We all know Hillary has voted for EVERY military action while in office then always says it was a mistake. Is she trying to start a war with Russia even before taking office if she wins? Her own people says she is unstable and nuts. I see it more and more. This lady is crazy. If you have friends or family draft age you better think long and hard
25 | Tom Lockyer | 0 | 1340085666087682_1340097226086526 | It funny how the DHS and DNI said Russia did it. Both run by democrats. However, the experts like CIA, NSA, FBI, ECT said they don't know who hacked the computers. It sounds more like a distraction for what is in the emails about how Hillary is a crook, a racist, sold out American people etc.

"I think the campaign is on the right trajectory. Not too many days and weeks ago Hillary Clinton was talking about tipping Arizona and being competitive in Texas. She's no longer talking like that."

8 | Margaret Steinhoff | 4 | 1340051062757809_1340080226088226 | This is also how I feel. It's almost over for me.  Dear Mr. Trump, It’s taken me a while to realize this and to admit it, but I’m grateful to you. For the past few months I’ve spent a good deal of time lamenting your campaign and the poison it has so effortlessly generated. I’ve watched our country imploding, our public discourse become polluted, our political climate grows ever more corrosive, and wrongly assumed you were to blame. It’s only lately I’ve come to understand that you haven’t manufactured our current national ugliness—you’ve simply revealed it. By saying the irresponsible, mean-spirited, ignorant things you say so freely and so frequently, you’ve given other like-minded people license to do the same. You’ve opened up the floodgates for our corporate sewage to flow fully. People no longer conceal their vile mess, they now revel in it, they broadcast it and retweet it. You’ve made bigotry and racism socially acceptable again and that has been a kind of twisted gift because it’s allowed me to really see people; not as they pretend to be on the surface—but in the very depths of their wounded, weaponized hearts. Over and over as your campaign has persisted, your supporters would tell me that they like you because you “speak your mind”. It wasn’t until recently that I’ve realized that you speak their minds. You’ve given credence to their prejudices and made those prejudices go mainstream. Thanks to the terrible ground you’ve broken, politicians, pastors, friends, and strangers, both in person and on social media now regularly out themselves as hateful, intolerant, and malicious—and they remind me just how close they are to me, just how deep the sickness in us runs, and just how far we have to go together. You’ve emboldened people to be open about things they used to conceal for the sake of decorum, and though it turns my stomach, I know that this is the only way we can move forward; to have that cancerous stuff exposed fully so that it can be dealt with. Our progress as a nation is predicated on authentic dialogue, no matter how brutal and disheartening that dialogue is. In other words, you’ve let us know what we’re really dealing with here and while it’s been rightly disturbing, it’s also been revelatory. That’s the thing about that kind of harsh light: you’re forced to see everything. Beauty and monstrosity equally illuminated. Now don’t get me wrong, I think you’re the least qualified, least knowledgeable Presidential candidate we may ever have had participate this far into the process, and if you somehow were elected I’d fear gravely for the world my children would inherit—should it survive your Presidency at all. I believe you’re reckless, bitter, and completely reprehensible; the very worst kind of bully. But whether you win or lose, you’ve already allowed me the blessing of Truth; about me, about you, about other candidates, about our nation. And in the process you’ve also shown me that I am not alone in resisting you and this ugly thing you’ve revealed about us. You’ve generated an equally loud, equally passionate response to it and this is where I find my hope these days. I find it in those for whom equality isn’t just a cheap buzzword, it’s the most precious of hills to die on. I find it in those people who refuse to be silent in the face of our impending shared regression. I find it in those willing to be bolder in defending the inherent value of all people. I find it in the growing army of those who will not tolerate hatred as a core American value. I find it in those who reject violence as our default response to dissension. I find it in the ever rising voice of people who will not let malice and bitterness represent them in the world. Today I find my hope in those who, like me, will not be complicit in allowing bigotry and intolerance to become a source of national pride, because we’ve seen where that leads. Yes, Mr Trump, you’ve unearthed our hidden sickness and you’ve allowed it to go viral. You brought every awful thing about us out into the open. You will NEVER Get My Vote!LikeShow more reactions   Comment   Share.1 Michael Steinhoff

I heard last night that 4 million early votes have been cast in Florida and 28% are Republicans who voted for Hillary!!! There just might be a whole lot less red on the map after this election and I hope Republicans will finally hear the rest of Americans who have had enough of their do nothing governance.

Just hire me you'll see. I'm not going to tell you how I'm going to do those things but there will be things and they will be big. I'll probably tell them some things and then tell them that I didn't say those things, even though they just saw/heard the words come out of my mouth. I'll also tell them I will need some time off in November and December for some legal issues (fraud and rape) and some more time for further legal issues after that but I'm uncertain of when since there are 75 pending lawsuits against me.........when can I start? 🤔

18 | Susan Grandahl-McKenzie | 0 | 1340051062757809_1340085716087677 | Trump is great at reading someone else's words on a teleprompter....there will not be one in the White House, so we will see the old nasty guy he really is.
19 | Danielle Evans | 1 | 1340051062757809_1340074162755499 | He's on the verge of losing two red states!!! I love the media trying to spin that this is still a close election. Please keep it up cause it only serves to motivate Dems to get to the polls!!!
20 | Debbie Durham | 2 | 1340051062757809_1340060666090182 | I'm surprise Kansas isn't dark red as stupid as the folks in this state are. I'm sure it will be by next week. They didn't learn anything from Brownstain's administration.
21 | Dave Washechek | 0 | 1340051062757809_1340091302753785 | I would love to see a woman in the white house. But not this one. She lies. She has a cheating husband who she is still with. Is that the best woman for the white house? Is that who you would like to look up to?
22 | Rhonda Sheptock | 1 | 1340051062757809_1340068042756111 | Meanwhile Trump is actually going to court for Child Rape and his Fraudulent University that stole millions from hard working Americans, shipping his work off the other countries while touting he wants to make America great, sexually assaulting women for decades, building his businesses with a Chinese steel, hiring US Contractors to architect and build his hotels and then not paying them, bankrupting his businesses and putting people out of work and not providing healthcare benefits for the ones he does have working. And this is all on top of him being a racist, misogynist, hate breeding, Draft Dodger, war monger who disrespects our veterans and war heroes and makes fun of disabled people! And we can also add that he not only lost 500million on a single year beating the great business man that he is, but found a loophole to then not pay any personal federal income tax for the last 20 years. So he isn't contributing to our schools, fire/police departments, servicemen, veterans, or any other departments that he states he cares so much about!
23 | Yolanda Bassett | 0 | 1340051062757809_1340074812755434 | The real answer is, all of the ones Romney won in 2012, which will get him to 206, PLUS 64 electoral college votes worth of states Obama won in 2012. Anyway you slice it that is the battle Trump, or any republican nominee, was going to have to fight in 2016.
24 | Steve Bayt | 0 | 1340051062757809_1340104999419082 | Epilogue: I am taking a break promoting my TV show about saving cats to save people and save the world in Parma, Ohio that the nation can read about on my Parma’s Resurrection page which will hopefully get CVS to incarnate social cause TV, to make sure Donald Trump is our next president. Any media outlet may publish this article without payment, but with a byline. I am trolling this on celebrity facebook pages and youtube comments since it seems so many are speaking for Clinton without any knowledge at all.*********************************************************************************So, Hilary wants to welcome millions of Muslims who practice Sharia Law that calls for raping, torturing and killing of women who will eventually vote and be appointed to be judges and officials who have let off thousands of   Muslim rapists and pedophiles which is also mandated by Sharia Law under all that religious tolerance Michelle Obama bs’s about.Millions of women in Islamic States have their genitals mutilated, raped, tortured and killed and that will happen here (and to a small part is happening here to be a warning) if Hilary is elected. What Hillary  will create a supply and demand for is a million times worse than what soon President Trump’s locker room talked about 11 years ago, to a talk show host and a soap star as part of an entertainment show.This tolerance and anti-Americanism is so disgraceful that while Muslims walk around the Cuyahoga County Public Library Parma Snow Branch clearly identified as Muslims reading all about Sharia Law, yet not asked to leave. I was asked to leave merely because I had torn pants on. Having a patron upset with torn pants was more offensive than a Muslim reading all about what atrocities to commit on women.This is not hate talk. It’s world events of atrocities committed against women on a massive epic scale that has made its way to America and Clinton will make part of American life. An American lifestyle where women won’t even be allowed to have a gun to protect themselves. Hillary Clinton supports Muslims because her husband can by all rights be called a rapist having forced himself on so many interns, George Bush had to take out all the carpets and furniture out of the White House because it smelled of sperm. If preventing legalized rape isn’t enough, there is Whitewater, Benghazi, Emails, communistic economic philosophies etc. Who knows how many rapes, the then First Lady walked in on and just let it keep on happening as long as she stayed in the white house. Yet, she calls Trump supporters deplorable.  Then there is all the other stuff Trump is talking about. Donald Trump might talk about doing bad stuff to women. Hillary is both married to someone who does the acts and wants to make a world where what he talks about is legal and mandated.Trump supporters aren’t deplorable. The deplorable ones are the media, in particular the attractive women who don’t warn their viewers about Sharia Law. For they themselves, Megyn Kelly, Kate Snow, Savannah Guthrie, Natalie Morales, Katy Tur, Paula Zahn, Laura Spencer, and those liberals on The View etc.  will themselves be victims someday. Then the media will talk about Sharia Law, not now when Donald Trump can stop it.  They’ll blame the Muslim judge and Muslim rapist. Not themselves. Megyn Kelly thinks Trump is bad. Wait someday when she does a story in Dearborn, Michigan and is raped walking out her hotel room by a Muslim where Sharia Law is legal.  I have yet to hear a single mention other than by Cruz, Rubio, Gingrich, Oriely and of course Trump explaining Sharia Law.When people vote, look at your daughter, niece, sister, mother or aunt and ask. Do you want their world to be safe or to get raped where the Muslim gets off without prosecution? For that is what Hillary will have happen. Vote Trump and make America Safe Again. Not Clinton and support legalized rape.
25 | Gary Vandiver | 1 | 1340051062757809_1340061666090082 | She has about wrapped up thus win unless Trump wins every swing state there is! Ask Romney who lost everyone but one of them in 12

2 | Julio Garcia | 11 | 1340013119428270_1340019132761002 | If you have the right to vote, please do so as many people residing in the U.S. cannot. This man is a monster and will probably start WWIII to say the least. I know Hillary is not perfect but at least we know she has what it takes to lead this great nation. If you want to go back to the days MLK got killed then #VoteTrump, if you're a bigot #VoteTrump, if you don't care about this country #VoteTrump, if you want your children to live in a torn up country #VoteTrump, if you have no soul/values #VoteTrump, I know this country is founded on Laws but no man in this country is here 'Lawfully' with the those Laws written by Native American blood. If we follow the laws of god and have basic morals we would have no problem with our neighbors, we would embrace them instead regardless of orientation, religion, disability, race and anything that Trump does not stand for. I'm done talking about this bigot as he is wasting my time and energy. Again if you can vote go vote, but remember that your vote can either keep the world as is, or make is 100 times worse. God Bless!

I remember the 70's when it wasn't illegal and it was no big deal then, shouldn't be a big deal now.

She is nothing but a divider and a classist thug herself. She accused people of the very things that she is guilty of doing, but she never owns up to her own evil actions and turns from them, as she wants the rewards of being evil.

I'm tired of our military and our country being shamed of its past, let alone apologize for being attacked first! I'm tired of our military falling apart from old outdated equipment and not being more aggressive on new technology for the men and women who fight for us so we can have the Fakebook conversation. I'm tired of race becoming an issue when we're all Americans. I'm tired of the veterans being mistreated after fighting for we the people.

12 | Craig Gee Smith | 4 | 1339967902766125_1174700542579699 | How can any American support the Democratic party?They established the racist Jim Crow laws.They support killing trimester babies.They lied about Obama Care causing millions of people to lose their health insurance providers and primary care Doctors.They have allowed insurance rates to triple and are going to skyrocket as high as 119% next year.They keep increasing tax burdens on the middle class and businesses.They support NAFTA & TPP which sends American Jobs overseas.They spin things so the poor, the middle class, and uneducated believe they care about people but that is another lie because they benefit when people are poor and dependent. In other words, the democratic party knows that their voter base increases when people are dependent on the Government.They want open borders, which allow foreign workers to take American jobs and drive wages and salaries lower.OBAMA Crushed millions of used cars which forced used car prices to double and triple hurting the poor and middle class.Documented investigations have shown that the DNC preselected Hillary Clinton to be the presidential nominee, which screwed over Bernie Sanders supporters.The democratic party receives 100s of millions of dollars from terrorist nations and pay-to-play schemes selling out Americans.Hillary Clinton and DNC have paid people to riot and physically attack Americans for having different political views.Hillary Clinton has committed several felonious acts but she has never been prosecuted. What's amazing is the fact that the average American would have been put in jail. She is corrupt!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Wake up America!!!VOTE TRUMP 2016!Hillary is a criminal!

17 | Doug Mockler | 5 | 1339967902766125_1340012462761669 | New York Police Department detectives and prosecutors working an alleged underage sexting case against former Congressman Anthony Weiner have turned over a newly-found laptop he shared with wife Huma Abedin to the FBI with enough evidence “to put Hillary (Clinton) and her crew away for life,” NYPD sources told True Pundit.NYPD sources said Clinton’s “crew” also included several unnamed yet implicated members of Congress in addition to her aides and insiders.The NYPD seized the computer from Weiner during a search warrant and detectives discovered a trove of over 500,000 emails to and from Hillary Clinton, Abedin and other insiders during her tenure as secretary of state. The content of those emails sparked the FBI to reopen its defunct email investigation into Clinton on Friday.But new revelations on the contents of that laptop, according to law enforcement sources, implicate the Democratic presidential candidate, her subordinates, and even select elected officials in far more alleged serious crimes than mishandling classified and top secret emails, sources said. NYPD sources said these new emails include evidence linking Clinton herself and associates to:    Money laundering    Child exploitation    Sex crimes with minors (children)    Perjury    Pay to play through Clinton Foundation    Obstruction of justice    Other felony crimesNYPD detectives and a NYPD Chief, the department’s highest rank under Commissioner, said openly that if the FBI and Justice Department fail to garner timely indictments against Clinton and co- conspirators, NYPD will go public with the damaging emails now in the hands of FBI Director James Comey and many FBI field offices.“What’s in the emails is staggering and as a father, it turned my stomach,” the NYPD Chief said. “There is not going to be any Houdini-like escape from what we found. We have copies of everything. We will ship them to Wikileaks or I will personally hold my own press conference if it comes to that.”The NYPD Chief said once Comey saw the alarming contents of the emails he was forced to reopen a criminal probe against Clinton.“People are going to prison,” he said.Meanwhile, FBI sources said Abedin and Weiner were cooperating with federal agents, who have taken over the non-sexting portions the case from NYPD. The husband-and-wife Clinton insiders  are both shopping for separate immunity deals, sources said.“If they don’t cooperate they are going to see long sentences,” a federal law enforcement source said.NYPD sources said Weiner or Abedin stored all the emails in a massive Microsoft Outlook program on the laptop. The emails implicate other current and former members of Congress and one high-ranking Democratic Senator as having possibly engaged in criminal activity too, sources said.Prosecutors in the office of US Attorney Preet Bharara have issued a subpoena for Weiner’s cell phones and travel records, law enforcement sources confirmed. NYPD said it planned to order the same phone and travel records on Clinton and Abedin, however, the FBI said it was in the process of requesting the identical records. Law enforcement sources are particularly interested in cell phone activity and travel to the Bahamas, U.S. Virgin Islands and other locations that sources would not divulge.The new emails contain travel documents and itineraries indicating Hillary Clinton, President Bill Clinton, Weiner and multiple members of Congress and other government officials accompanied convicted pedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein on his Boeing 727 on multiple occasions to his private island in the U.S Virgin Islands, sources said. Epstein’s island has also been dubbed Orgy Island or Sex Slave Island where Epstein allegedly pimps out underage girls and boys to international dignitaries.Both NYPD and FBI sources confirm based on the new emails they now believe Hillary Clinton traveled as Epstein’s guest on at least six occasions, probably more when all the evidence is combed, sources said. Bill Clinton, it has been confirmed in media reports spanning recent years, that he too traveled with Epstein over 20 times to the island.

It reminds me of a combination of boiled cabbage, urine and farts. I’m guessing it’s either connected to her fall or simply the fact that she rarely bathes. Outside of encouraging her to take a shower once in a while, I don’t know what to do about this. — any suggestions....
19 | Janet Schmidt | 11 | 1339967902766125_1339979612764954 | Voting for Hillary is going so low you can't even see it on the scale. She approves of murdering babies, that's really great. She had the Benghazi guys murdered that's really low. She's used her Clinton foundation for illegal funds that's going really low.  She has thousands of emails out there for anyone to see that are Classified and dangerous to our country.  That is very, very low.  Then what could she mean that "they go high"?

Arpaio, who recently plead not guilty to contempt of court charges related to a racial profiling case, is facing his stiffest competition since being elected in 1992.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Dale Whiting | 11 | 1339946346101614_1339980759431506 | There are a few people in Maricopa County who know Arpaio well. Most have been taken in by his anti-criminal rhetoric often aimed at Hispanics. Arpaio would have his constituents believe he "upholds the law." But what he upholds is himself. Beyond a shadow of a doubt, Joe Arpaio is the original Donald Trump!
2 | TracyJonathan Harness | 22 | 1339946346101614_1339957022767213 | Sherrif Joe is an American hero. Only Liberals want illegals to kill Americans and reward them for doing so with citizenship. Sherrif Joe makes his inmates work, cleaning up roads and other public works.
3 | Arthur A. Ahr | 3 | 1339946346101614_1340037006092548 | Another left-wing hit-job. Fortunately, Arizona is not California or New York and an Arizona jury will NEVER convict Sheriff Joe, a GREAT American.
4 | Wanda Kinzeler | 1 | 1339946346101614_1339968112766104 | Relevant to probable cause and whether or not Huma Abedin or Hillary Clinton, or both, broke the law, are federal statutes such as 18 U.S. Code § 1519:Whoever knowingly alters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, covers up, falsifies, or makes a false entry in any record, document, or tangible object with the intent to impede, obstruct, or influence the investigation or proper administration of any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States or any case filed under title 11, or in relation to or contemplation of any such matter or case, shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both.
5 | Marilyn Stutto | 1 | 1339946346101614_1340015622761353 | That sheriff is from Massachusetts. He isn't a southerner at al. And he's a crook and breaks the law on a daily basis. He belongs in jail. I hope he gets beat. He shouldn't be running for sheriff. He's under. Indictment right now
6 | George Dreger | 2 | 1339946346101614_1340036349425947 | Hey Liberals! I'm posting this here for your convenience, so you can start practicing: O Canada!Our home and native land!True patriot love in all thy sons command.With glowing hearts we see thee rise,The True North strong and free!From far and wide,O Canada, we stand on guard for thee.God keep our land glorious and free!O Canada, we stand on guard for thee.O Canada, we stand on guard for thee.
7 | Mandi Hughes | 1 | 1339946346101614_1340103859419196 | So, he does what he can to keep illegals out of his State, and this is what happens. But, HE is the bad guy? This is def Obama's legacy. Prosecute people who uphold the law.
8 | Julio Garcia | 3 | 1339946346101614_1340019219427660 | If you have the right to vote, please do so as many people residing in the U.S. cannot. This man is a monster and will probably start WWIII to say the least. I know Hillary is not perfect but at least we know she has what it takes to lead this great nation. If you want to go back to the days MLK got killed then #VoteTrump, if you're a bigot #VoteTrump, if you don't care about this country #VoteTrump, if you want your children to live in a torn up country #VoteTrump, if you have no soul/values #VoteTrump, I know this country is founded on Laws but no man in this country is here 'Lawfully' with the those Laws written by Native American blood. If we follow the laws of god and have basic morals we would have no problem with our neighbors, we would embrace them instead regardless of orientation, religion, disability, race and anything that Trump does not stand for. I'm done talking about this bigot as he is wasting my time and energy. Again if you can vote go vote, but remember that your vote can either keep the world as is, or make is 100 times worse. God Bless!
9 | Geoffrey Stein | 4 | 1339946346101614_1339963986099850 | Riddle - Who fell off the turnip truck, was born yesterday, is as naive as the village idiot, can be sold the Brooklyn Bridge and buys ocean front property in Arizona? Answer, anyone who does not think Hillary is a crook, my God, use your brain apply some common sense. Hillary's emails got the same treatment Jimmy Hoffa's body did, deleted, bleached with acid, chopped up, and buried in the desertGodfather would be amazed at the illegal operations of the Clinton Foundation
10 | Linda Wolfe Zaner | 2 | 1339946346101614_1339969926099256 | when we lived in Arizona, mid 90's, Joe put the convicts in tent cities without AC!! most people thought this was fine, why do we pay for AC when many of good law abiding citizens didn't have/couldn't afford it??? I always thought that was a good idea; and BTW most of the convicts didn't have AC at home so why move them up in the ladder of must haves??
11 | Jake Roland | 3 | 1339946346101614_1339985946097654 | Arpaio has common sense which is definitely missing today.
12 | Toby Stewart | 10 | 1339946346101614_1339952052767710 | Liberal filth going after a man that enforces the law. A law that keeps free loading low IQ free loading third world from entering the country an voting. Liberals are the scum of the earth.
13 | Michael Angelo de Castro | 8 | 1339946346101614_1339946986101550 | One thing Trump has proven is that unconditional love, being nonjudgmental, and moral relativism really does not exist for the left. Of course many of us already knew this. Watching it play out bigly is comical. Enjoy!

Some tweeters threatened to boycott Starbucks in response to the cup, accusing it of spreading "liberal bias" by wading into the election.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Sebastian Malak | 628 | 1339913892771526_1339916586104590 | It's funny to me when all the conservatives say that Liberals are the ones that are always butthurt about everything.... ha ha #cupgate2016
2 | Andrea Nicole Higgins | 779 | 1339913892771526_1339916119437970 | If unity enrages you, there's much deeper problems.
3 | Dave Anthony | 270 | 1339913892771526_1339920069437575 | Yeah we certainly wouldn't want unity!  It's not like it's the Christian thing to do.  If trumpettes want to make America great again, they might do well to remember that at one time it was a badge of honor to be known as the great melting pot!
4 | Christopher Levy | 168 | 1339913892771526_1339916609437921 | PLEASE NOT THIS AGAIN! I'm not ready for people to be that passionate about cups ever AGAIN.
5 | Tiffany Nicole Badoud | 107 | 1339913892771526_1339921139437468 | As a Conservative.. this doesn't bother me. What the hell is wrong with this cup? Or the red cup last year? I haven't heard anyone complain but I'm assuming it's from crazy people. We have them on both sides. 🙃😏
6 | Adam T. Camarena | 100 | 1339913892771526_1339916989437883 | Coming from Conservative values, but defining myself as third party and soon non-partisan... Come on... It's saying we should be united. Together. Yes, we have opponents trying to manipulate how we run our society, be it through politics, religion, etc. that try to throw out what we love and believe in our society.
7 | Matthew Hardgrove | 73 | 1339913892771526_1339921206104128 | Isn't someone always offended by Starbucks cups?  Last year it was the Christians, this year Republicans.  Some people just need to complain about something I suppose.
8 | Lee Kasprzyk | 55 | 1339913892771526_1339919809437601 | There must be a conservative think tank in which people sit around and wait for new Starbucks cup designs. Thanks for the free pub, kids.
9 | Sandra Ray | 47 | 1339913892771526_1339921869437395 | Yeah! How dare they suggest that we all seek to get along and work together for the betterment of ourselves and our communities! We should be allowed to continue to separate and divide into our own imaginary corners because that's what's always made civilization great, the right to behave uncivilized...and onto making progress. Sorry, if you are still convinced racism and hatred are the answers to societies ills, the rest of us will have to leave you behind.
10 | Eric G. Skelton | 61 | 1339913892771526_1339916182771297 | Looks like a bunch of white people to me. What are the Trumper humpers mad at?
11 | Chuck Mason | 20 | 1339913892771526_1339970112765904 | So... they are not outraged by the GOP Nominee's comments but they are outraged over a coffee cup. I hope Hillary didn't email any pics of the unity coffee cup, but if she did I'm sure Vladimir will wiki leak about it.
12 | Mark Motta | 35 | 1339913892771526_1339921842770731 | To those bothered by this, I recommend a piping hot coffee enema.
13 | Letitia Johnson | 26 | 1339913892771526_1339923379437244 | Great job Starbucks! The cup symbolizes that we should be united people. The fact that some are angry about that speaks volumes. *smh*
14 | Kiesha Muhammad | 14 | 1339913892771526_1339936876102561 | Sigh it's  a cup with a positive slogan. Get mad at homelessness, illiteracy, and bullying...but a cup with a positive message? Smh
15 | Anita O'Daly | 20 | 1339913892771526_1339927099436872 | You just had to know that a cup symbolizing "unity" and "brotherhood" would be a problem for the GOP and Conservatives, lol, even before you've finished reading. I need to get to Starbucks.
16 | Leigh League | 10 | 1339913892771526_1339944989435083 | Interesting and telling that some folks instantly interpreted the message of 'unity' as not supporting their candidate. Maybe they should think about that for a bit.
17 | Kenneth Molfetta | 11 | 1339913892771526_1339924829437099 | Who cares if they boycott. How uniformed are they? Starbucks Has always had a policy of inclusion and has every right to have a liberal bias if they want to. More power to Starbucks!
18 | Aliscia Klein | 4 | 1339913892771526_1339947652768150 | So literally Starbucks just can't win for y'all one year it's a holiday RED color cup oh good lord don't ever go back there again now it's a green cup showing different people different walks of life unifying all and everybodys freaking out again maybe the issue is Starbucks customers are too dang sensitive to begin with gosh get a life it's a dang cup
19 | Michael Howard | 4 | 1339913892771526_1339950819434500 | If you don't believe in the messages that the far right conservatives, Alt-Right, Trump and other hate groups are spreading than you're a danger to their mission. Unity and compromise is not part of their vocabulary.
20 | Joan Joaquin | 6 | 1339913892771526_1339943952768520 | Why senior citizens are voting for Trump is beyond  me their is nothing he can do for them they will be lucky if they see a 1 percent raise. If he repeal Obama care their grand children will have to get their own insurance 18 yrs to 26 yrs will not be able to stay on their parents ins. The insurance is very costly check it out you will be shocked.
21 | Daniel Resto | 7 | 1339913892771526_1339936896102559 | Bet if they put out a cup showing klansmen bombing a black church, they'd be flocking there!  How telling is it that conservatives now consider the very concept of "unity" a LIBERAL idea?
22 | Shari Ball | 2 | 1339913892771526_1343265259046453 | Looks like some people need to get a life.  How about instead of whining about a cup, you feed a homeless person, volunteer your time at a nursing home or an animal rescue perhaps even a hospital ..... There are so many more things in this life than a freaking cup..... Just S.A.D.
23 | Ken Bolotin | 3 | 1339913892771526_1339975806098668 | One more controversy where there isn't one. If they want to boycott let them it sure won't hurt Starbucks.It's just one example of this ridiculous War on Christmas
24 | Natalie Jones | 10 | 1339913892771526_1339923232770592 | A coffee cup has a liberal bias now?  Maybe I need to commit to buying more coffee to stand against the "boycott" - as if I need an excuse for more gingerbread lattes....
25 | Dan Kesterke | 3 | 1339913892771526_1339995486096700 | Can't we all just drink coffee? Pretty sure Chipotle's cups don't draw this kind of scrutiny. It's a good message. Now go drink your latte.

1 | Darrick Ensey | 205 | 1339866382776277_1339869729442609 | Love Obama!!!! Remember America, this Sunday we set our clocks back one hour... And on Tuesday we move the country FORWARD! #VoteBlue
2 | Alisa Miller | 50 | 1339866382776277_1339896809439901 | Just so everyone who doesn't read the Article, but reads all the comments knows. Lindor of The Cleveland Indians Stole a base in game 1 of the World Series. So Taco Bell is giving everyone in America a free taco today. That is Why POTUS said "vote and then go get your taco"
3 | Anthony Prime | 153 | 1339866382776277_1339875642775351 | Are you kidding me  “You can vote, and then go get your taco" as a Hispanic I find this beyond offensive. Can you imagine if Trump had said "You can vote and then go get fried chicken/watermelon to black voters.
4 | Robert L. Mckenzie | 22 | 1339866382776277_1339875039442078 | What is wrong with you Trump supporters can there be a headline without you jumping in with all your stupid crap??!! 6 more days to go people 6 more days!!!
5 | Rocky Hernandez | 67 | 1339866382776277_1339870226109226 | If trump had used a taco analogy it would have been called racist. Smh hypocrisy at its finest. And shouldn't Obama be in the Whitehouse working and not using tax payer money traveling the states campaigning for Hillabeast? *edited*Felt the need to clarify I agree Obama was not being racist I was able to see his point. My point is when trump did the whole taco bowl thing he's was automatically called racist. It's the double standard that irks me. That's all continue venting lol
6 | Teresa Boswell | 9 | 1339866382776277_1339888166107432 | What is the problem with msnbc, have they all turned republican. Rachael, joy, Lawerance , Brian Williams are the only exception. Today I was watching Thomas's Roberts and he announced the upcoming interview with Trumps daughter-in law. Where is the support for Hillary Clinton. Signed pissed off in Washington State!!!
7 | Lamont Lewis | 7 | 1339866382776277_1339911266105122 | Yeah. He said if you can take the time to go to Taco Bell and get a free taco, then you can take the time to go vote next Tuesday. He was in Cleveland when he said that, tellling them in general to just vote.
8 | Entivio O'Reilly | 5 | 1339866382776277_1339902206106028 | Wait this isn't stereotypical, this isn't racist?? Are you kidding me!cause he is half black it's apparently socially acceptable to stereo type??? Any Thoughts from my liberal  friends?
9 | Lamont Lewis | 3 | 1339866382776277_1339924812770434 | Actualy Obama didnt tell Hispanics if you can get a free taco then you can take the time to vote. He was telling all Cleveland residents. Most of you are astute enough to know what he was talking about. Others...ya are just not that bright. And ignorant. And stupid...
10 | Grannykids Moore | 7 | 1339866382776277_1339902359439346 | It wasn't offensive when taco trucks was on every corner,  he was promoting there business and praising them, I love tacos it made me go to taco bell and I bet alot of the crowd went there also
11 | Petra Doll | 1 | 1339866382776277_1339926976103551 | What's even more scary than Crooked Hillary and her crimes is the people who continue to support a Kingpin who now has been proven to be every bit of corrupt we have been saying for months now. Evil supports evil. On November 8th we are going to make Hillary pay for her sins to the world and to this country and Obama & the mainstream media will follow in tow for their crimes against the American people. Donald J. Trump for Commander in Chief!

18 | Doug Mockler | 0 | 1339866382776277_1340013429428239 | New York Police Department detectives and prosecutors working an alleged underage sexting case against former Congressman Anthony Weiner have turned over a newly-found laptop he shared with wife Huma Abedin to the FBI with enough evidence “to put Hillary (Clinton) and her crew away for life,” NYPD sources told True Pundit.NYPD sources said Clinton’s “crew” also included several unnamed yet implicated members of Congress in addition to her aides and insiders.The NYPD seized the computer from Weiner during a search warrant and detectives discovered a trove of over 500,000 emails to and from Hillary Clinton, Abedin and other insiders during her tenure as secretary of state. The content of those emails sparked the FBI to reopen its defunct email investigation into Clinton on Friday.But new revelations on the contents of that laptop, according to law enforcement sources, implicate the Democratic presidential candidate, her subordinates, and even select elected officials in far more alleged serious crimes than mishandling classified and top secret emails, sources said. NYPD sources said these new emails include evidence linking Clinton herself and associates to:    Money laundering    Child exploitation    Sex crimes with minors (children)    Perjury    Pay to play through Clinton Foundation    Obstruction of justice    Other felony crimesNYPD detectives and a NYPD Chief, the department’s highest rank under Commissioner, said openly that if the FBI and Justice Department fail to garner timely indictments against Clinton and co- conspirators, NYPD will go public with the damaging emails now in the hands of FBI Director James Comey and many FBI field offices.“What’s in the emails is staggering and as a father, it turned my stomach,” the NYPD Chief said. “There is not going to be any Houdini-like escape from what we found. We have copies of everything. We will ship them to Wikileaks or I will personally hold my own press conference if it comes to that.”The NYPD Chief said once Comey saw the alarming contents of the emails he was forced to reopen a criminal probe against Clinton.“People are going to prison,” he said.Meanwhile, FBI sources said Abedin and Weiner were cooperating with federal agents, who have taken over the non-sexting portions the case from NYPD. The husband-and-wife Clinton insiders  are both shopping for separate immunity deals, sources said.“If they don’t cooperate they are going to see long sentences,” a federal law enforcement source said.NYPD sources said Weiner or Abedin stored all the emails in a massive Microsoft Outlook program on the laptop. The emails implicate other current and former members of Congress and one high-ranking Democratic Senator as having possibly engaged in criminal activity too, sources said.Prosecutors in the office of US Attorney Preet Bharara have issued a subpoena for Weiner’s cell phones and travel records, law enforcement sources confirmed. NYPD said it planned to order the same phone and travel records on Clinton and Abedin, however, the FBI said it was in the process of requesting the identical records. Law enforcement sources are particularly interested in cell phone activity and travel to the Bahamas, U.S. Virgin Islands and other locations that sources would not divulge.The new emails contain travel documents and itineraries indicating Hillary Clinton, President Bill Clinton, Weiner and multiple members of Congress and other government officials accompanied convicted pedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein on his Boeing 727 on multiple occasions to his private island in the U.S Virgin Islands, sources said. Epstein’s island has also been dubbed Orgy Island or Sex Slave Island where Epstein allegedly pimps out underage girls and boys to international dignitaries.Both NYPD and FBI sources confirm based on the new emails they now believe Hillary Clinton traveled as Epstein’s guest on at least six occasions, probably more when all the evidence is combed, sources said. Bill Clinton, it has been confirmed in media reports spanning recent years, that he too traveled with Epstein over 20 times to the island.

No excuses. Remind them of Supreme Court Justices and how we want to keep America moving forward and not allow bigotry and resistance to progress rule our country. Hillary can't accomplish anything on her own, she needs a Congress that will DO IT'S JOB. #Forward #VoteBlue

This is a man who couldn't honor his promises he made to his first two wives, who didn't honor his promises to those who were supposed to be paid for work done for him, including his current pollster firm and all those who never got paid for their work when he declared bankruptcy 6 times, who failed to keep his promises to investors in his business dealings multiple times (most recently with his Taj Mahal casino), who has not given the 100 million dollars toward his own campaign as he had  promised he would, did not give the money he publicly promised to various charities on his Apprentice show, etc etc.

9 | Paul Ruehs | 3 | 1339827012780214_1339884566107792 | Why it’s important to change the Congress this election cycle … Trump may win in November (according to him, he is winning as is reflected in “several polls” … many swing states are extremely close and could go either way) it will not benefit our form of democracy to have all three tenants of government controlled by a single party … Republicans will have the presidency, both houses of Congress, and the US Supreme Court.  Trump will have a blank check to do what so ever he wants with no checks and balances imposed to ensure all citizen’s interests are represented.  If Trump loses the election, and the GOP continues to control the Congress, it will be business as usual meaning that nothing will get done and gridlock will continue.  Over the past six years the Republicans controlled the Senate and House.  Time and again, they have proven they are incapable of moving bills and/or doing anything.  And finally, we continuously hear how people are “feed up” and dissatisfied with the direction the country is headed, this being the case, it makes no sense to constantly vote the same people (the ones who are responsible for the competency of our government) into office, i.e. Marco Rubio.  Rubio has stated on numerous occasions that he hates his job and doesn’t show up for work because it would make no difference.  Yet, Rubio has no qualms about cashing his overly generous pay check every two weeks.  And sees no hypocrisy in applying for the same job!  If you vote the status quo don’t expect anything to change.

If you want to go back to the days MLK got killed then #VoteTrump, if you're a bigot #VoteTrump, if you don't care about this country #VoteTrump, if you want your children to live in a torn up country #VoteTrump, if you have no soul/values #VoteTrump, I know this country is founded on Laws but no man in this country is here 'Lawfully' with the those Laws written by Native American blood. If we follow the laws of god and have basic morals we would have no problem with our neighbors, we would embrace them instead regardless of orientation, religion, disability, race and anything that Trump does not stand for. I'm done talking about this bigot as he is wasting my time and energy. Again if you can vote go vote, but remember that your vote can either keep the world as is, or make is 100 times worse.

Progress is fine, but not the way Clinton and her corrupt administion will do it. Talk about bigotry, the democratic party has caused most of the bogotry will have today in our country by pitting one race against another. All of us have sinned, but I rather have Trump anyday than have people who believe as the Clintons do. They are greedy and power hungry. Read the Wikileaks papers and the FBI papers that have come out on both of them. So Sad!!

Seriously?  Do any of you even know how they stand on issues? This election is a circus and much of the blame goes to the media for promoting it as such. The rest goes to all of you for falling for it. News outlets don't care who is elected as the next POTUS, but if they keep you watching it drives advertising dollars they're way.

I don't vote for a certain person because I'm told to, or because that's what my friends are doing. I research and check voting records. We need to stop putting people in office that votes with their party 95% of the time. We need to put people in office that votes based on what the people want, and vote on what's good for the country. That's why nothing is getting done now, because 99% of the politicians in office vote down party lines no matter if its what we want or not.

23 | Janay King | 0 | 1339827012780214_1340114026084846 | As we run into this final stretch in the 2016 vote, I wanted to make a post that helps to keep people on target since this is such an important election. Let’s think about the recent Brexit vote that is forcing the United Kingdom to exit the European Union, for a moment. In that vote, people made a protest vote against staying in the Union because they didn’t think that it would really happen. The Result, many Millennial Voters desperately want to take their vote back, saying that they were not being serious. In the 1980’s Carter was up by 8 points in the polls, people did not come out to vote because they thought that he had it beat. In the 2000 election, people were not thrilled about Al Gore, thinking that he was too much of a bore, and not a strong candidate. Many Liberals voted for Ralph Nader instead of Al Gore, and handed George Bush Jr. a razor thin victory that resulted in a disastrous 8 years. Listen People, I understand that it really looks like Hillary has this all sewn up. Trust me when I say that she doesn’t. It is not over until the last vote is counted.  She may not be your candidate that you are willing to stand on railroad tracks to get elected, she may not be your perfect choice for President, BUTIf history tells us anything, it is that we should never take anything for granted. This election needs to be won by Hillary Clinton. It is not enough to say that Hillary Needs to be President, but that she needs to win by such a huge margin so we never have to see Trump, or anyone like Trump, on the ballot ever again. We need to retake Congress. We need to vote blue for all Congressmen and Senators so we can retake the House and Senate. We need to put a stop to this crazy Republican right wing insanity that has gripped our government for years because of blind racism and stupidity. Get out there, Vote, get your Friends and Family to vote. Stop the insanity!!!!
24 | Doug Mockler | 0 | 1339827012780214_1340014139428168 | Laptop Also Unveiled More Classified, Top Secret BreachesAccording to other uncovered emails, Abedin and Clinton both sent and received thousands of classified and top secret documents to personal email accounts including Weiner’s unsecured campaign web site which is managed by Democratic political consultants in Washington D.C.Weiner maintained little known email accounts that the couple shared on the website anthonyweiner.com. Weiner, a former seven-term Democratic Congressman from New York, primarily used that domain to campaign for Congress and for his failed mayoral bid of New York City.At one point, FBI sources said, Abedin and Clinton’s classified and top secret State Department documents and emails were stored in Weiner’s email on a server shared with a dog grooming service and a western Canadian bicycle shop.However, Weiner and Abedin, who is Hillary Clinton’s closest personal aide, weren’t the only people with access to the Weiner’s email account. Potentially dozens of unknown individuals had access to Abedin’s sensitive State Department emails that were stored in Weiner’s email account, FBI sources confirmed.FEC records show Weiner paid more than $92,000 of congressional campaign funds to Anne Lewis Strategies LLC to manage his email and web site. According to FBI sources, the D.C.-based political consulting firm has served as the official administrator of the anthonyweiner.com domain since 2010, the same time Abedin was working at the State Department. This means technically Weiner and Abedin’s emails, including top secret State Department emails, could have been accessed, printed, discussed, leaked, or distributed by untold numbers of personnel at the Anne Lewis consulting firm because they can control where the website and it emails are pointed, FBI sources said.According to FBI sources, the bureau’s newly-minted probe into Clinton’s use and handling of emails while she served as secretary of state, has also been broadened to include investigating new email-related revelations, including:    Abedin forwarded classified and top secret State Department emails to Weiner’s email    Abedin stored emails, containing government secrets, in a special folder shared with Weiner warehousing over 500,000 archived State Department emails.    Weiner had access to these classified and top secret documents without proper security clearance to view the records    Abedin also used a personal yahoo address and her Clintonemail.com address to send/receive/store classified and top secret documents    A private consultant managed Weiner’s site for the last six years, including three years when Clinton was secretary of state, and therefore, had full access to all emails as the domain’s listed registrant and administrator via Whois email contacts.Because Weiner’s campaign website is managed by the third-party consultant and political email guru, FBI agents are burdened with the task of trying to decipher just how many people had access to Weiner’s server and emails and who were these people. Or if the server was ever compromised by hackers, or other actors.Abedin told FBI agents in an April interview that she didn’t know how to consistently print documents or emails from her secure Dept. of State system. Instead, she would forward the sensitive emails to her yahoo, Clintonemail.com and her email linked to Weiner.Abedin said, according to FBI documents, she would then access those email accounts via webmail from an unclassified computer system at the State Dept. and print the documents, many of which were classified and top secret, from the largely unprotected webmail portals.Clinton did not have a computer in her office on Mahogany Row at the State Dept. so she was not able to read timely intelligence unless it was printed out for her, Abedin said. Abedin also said Clinton could not operate the secure State Dept. fax machine installed in her Chappaqua, NY home without assistance.Perhaps more alarming, according to the FBI’s 302 Report detailing its interview with Abedin, none of the multiple FBI agents and Justice Department officials who conducted the interview pressed Abedin to further detail the email address linked to Weiner. There was never a follow up, according to the 302 report.But now, all that has changed, with the FBI’s decision to reopen the Clinton email investigation and the husband and wife seeking immunity deals to testify against Clinton and other associates about the contents of the laptop’s emails.

Trump has zero knowledge of all the info you need in foreign relations, the CIA, all, the military, all branches of govt., inclu education and healthcare. He knows nothing. If he is not reading a prepared speech, he knows nothing. A good proof of his ignorance would be to quiz him on his website proposals. He would not be able to explain them. He said months ago,looking for a VP, ghat they would be given all the executive powers. Well, that is what the POTUS does. So, if he won,we would have President Pence, the homophobe,the one who could not win reelection in his own state due to unpopularity. He never thought he would get far in the race. He wanted FREE advertising for his TRUMP brand. He is a walking LOGO. But, he doesn't want to do the work. And his gang of alt-right villians  would make us into a Russian sister-state.

15 | Mary Linderberg | 5 | 1339785446117704_1339815762781339 | By Gary Hostetler:  I asked a young  Lady at a game, how she could vote for Trump, a “misogynist, a racist and a bigot”. Here is her answer: Because I use my head to research and find out what candidates really are, not what the media wants me to think.  Because Donald Trump has more women in executive and managerial positions than any comparable company, which tells me he is not a misogynist.  Because he pays these women the same or more than their male counterparts, which tells me looks for capacity and skills in people, not color, gender or race.  Because he fought the West Palm Beach City Council to be able to open his newly purchased club, so he could include blacks and Jews as members, who had been banned until then. This tells me he is not a racist.  Because he has raised wonderful children who have turned out to be outstanding, hard-working and compassionate adults. He must be doing something right.  Because his economic plans makes sense, are conservative in nature, and I vote based of what is best for my family, my friends and my country.  Because everybody, the left and the right are afraid of him, the media is trying to destroy his image, and even foreign governments are voicing their opinions, so he must be doing something right. Clean house maybe?  Because I want a Supreme Court that will uphold the Constitution, not behave as minions of the administration.  I have had enough with judges who are more like political activists than law enforcers.    Because I fear for my family’s safety if the current trend of not confronting blatant terrorism continues – which is a threat to our way of life.  Because I am fed up with the rampant corruption of this administration.  Accountability in government is paramount, and as this administration has demonstrated, it is a foreign concept to them.  Because I am fed up with the political correctness gone wild, and because Trump is not afraid to say what everybody thinks but does not dare to say. A thug is a thug, regardless of color, and that's it.  Because it is about time someone puts America's interests ahead of other countries.  Because I know he recognizes and embraces America's exceptionalism, and will not tour the World apologizing for who we are. That tells me he is a patriot.  Because, unlike HRC, he has actually held a job, worked hard and achieved success.  And last, but not least, because I am more offended by what Hillary does than by what Trump says.

He has also given aid, comfort, and sanctuary to terrorists, including Al Qaeda members, though there is apparently no evidence of his involvement in the terrible events of September 11, 2001. It is clear, however, that if left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare, and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons. Should he succeed in that endeavor, he could alter the political and security landscape of the Middle East, which as we know all too well affects American security.” — Hillary Clinton, October 10, 2002

The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) is a United States Federal Law passed in 1970 that was designed to provide a tool for law enforcement agencies to fight organized crime. 	Racketeering may include bribery, counterfeiting, money laundering, embezzlement, illegal gambling, kidnapping, murder, drug trafficking, slavery, and a host of other nefarious business practices.  A conviction under RICO comes when the Department of Justice proves that the   has engaged in two or more examples of racketeering 	Hillary Clinton is guilty of exposing classified documents to foreign governments by placing them illegally on her server, of sending and receiving classified documents and conspiring with her staff to circumvent the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) by avoiding the use of the State Department run servers.  Some of the documents were so highly classified the the investigators on the case weren’t even able to examine the material themselves until they got their own clearances raised to the highest levels.		Tens of millions of dollars donated to the Clinton Foundation was funneled to theorganization through a Canadian shell company which has made tracing the donors nearly impossible.  Less than 10% of donations to the Foundation has actually been released to charitable organizations and $2M that has been traced back to long time Bill Clinton's friend, Julie McMahon (aka The Energizer).   When the official investigation into Hillary’s email server began, she instructed her IT professional to delete over 30,000.  The FBI has subsequently recovered the majority, if not all, of Hillary’s deleted emails and are putting together a strong case against her for attempting to cover up her illegal and illicit activities.

In a striking split from running mate Gary Johnson, Bill Weld said he was "vouching" for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Deb Hartogensis Godden | 640 | 1339687446127504_1339688632794052 | Weld is more of an "old-style" Republican . . . that is, relatively open-minded and with concern for country over party ideology.
2 | Todd Stoilov | 424 | 1339687446127504_1339690646127184 | More power to him. He knows what's at stake and that this is not time to play games. Listen to him, he is the better half on the Libertarians ticket, the one with a brain.
3 | Cheryl Brady | 128 | 1339687446127504_1339688279460754 | Weld can carry on an intelligent conversation, unlike Johnson. And his decision is a wise one.
4 | Josh Smith | 130 | 1339687446127504_1339688829460699 | AKA: I just came to senses and realized Gary is an embarrassment. Why did I run with him? We got no chance, so you know what? I'm with her, I guess..
5 | Cliff Davis | 83 | 1339687446127504_1339701079459474 | Mr. Weld will emerge after this election as one of the few true leaders in the republican party. Along with Mr. Kasich they will have a lot of rebuilding to do.
6 | Brenda Cooper | 49 | 1339687446127504_1339705312792384 | Don't know much about this guy, but was really impressed with his interview, he actually seemed to have the countries best interest in all that he said, not how he could line his own pockets or just going along with the repubs to stay in office--our country should always come first 👏👏👏
7 | Monica Andi | 66 | 1339687446127504_1339688836127365 | Without the minority vote and 91% white voters I have a better chance of winning the lotto than Trump winning The White House Plain and Simple❗️#ImWithNastyWoman
8 | Scott Herman | 40 | 1339687446127504_1339705786125670 | Yeah! As we run into this final stretch in the 2016 vote, I wanted to make a post that helps to keep people on target since this is such an important election. Let’s think about the recent Brexit vote that is forcing the United Kingdom to exit the European Union, for a moment. In that vote, people made a protest vote against staying in the Union because they didn’t think that it would really happen. The Result, many Millennial Voters desperately want to take their vote back, saying that they were not being serious. In the 1980’s Carter was up by 8 points in the polls, people did not come out to vote because they thought that he had it beat. In the 2000 election, people were not thrilled about Al Gore, thinking that he was too much of a bore, and not a strong candidate. Many Liberals voted for Ralph Nader instead of Al Gore, and handed George Bush Jr. a razor thin victory that resulted in a disastrous 8 years. Listen People, I understand that it really looks like Hillary has this all sewn up. Trust me when I say that she doesn’t. It is not over until the last vote is counted.  She may not be your candidate that you are willing to stand on railroad tracks to get elected, she may not be your perfect choice for President, BUTIf history tells us anything, it is that we should never take anything for granted. This election needs to be won by Hillary Clinton. It is not enough to say that Hillary Needs to be President, but that she needs to win by such a huge margin so we never have to see Trump, or anyone like Trump, on the ballot ever again. We need to retake Congress. We need to vote blue for all Congressmen and Senators so we can retake the House and Senate. We need to put a stop to this crazy Republican right wing insanity that has gripped our government for years because of blind racism and stupidity. Get out there, Vote, get your Friends and Family to vote. Stop the insanity!!!!Please share would like to reach as many people as I canPlease vote early if you can't
9 | Charles Baldon | 17 | 1339687446127504_1339796679449914 | Donald Trump, the King of Bankruptcy, professional conman, draft dodger, tax cheat and sexual predator is a psychotic self-absorbed narcissist. His style of hate-mongering politics makes America look like a third world country. The fact that he is even being considered for president is shameful. Vote Blue!!!!!!

11 | Douglas Lawrence | 3 | 1339687446127504_1339709406125308 | He doesn't fear for the country enough to drop out of the race and denounce Gary Johnson. To me is just as bad as the Republican Party voting for Trump.
12 | Bruce Keller | 9 | 1339687446127504_1339702696125979 | Donald Trump is 1000 percent correct by calling Hillary Clinton "crooked Hillary". The criminal activities of the Clintons is truly of a magnitude no one ever imagined. I sure do wish the main stream news networks would do their job and investigate the Clintons and report instead of protecting them.
13 | Michael T. Gaffey | 6 | 1339687446127504_1339750486121200 | If he really fears for the country, then Weld needs to talk Johnson and Stein into dropping out of the race. It's too close. The votes they are siphoning off from Hillary may be enough to put Trump in the WH.
14 | David Michael | 1 | 1339687446127504_1339740529455529 | Jordanna Banks and Christopher Brian.  I watched this guy say Hillary Clinton is a person who is honest and basically endorses her last night.  And the johnson-weld ticket is a joke and this is just another example of it
15 | Amy Taylor-Brill | 1 | 1339687446127504_1339998726096376 | As a rule, if you live in a battleground state, voting for the Green Party or the Libertarian Party will only result in the election of Donald Trump.  However in the case of Utah, voting for the independent candidate (even over a vote for Hillary) will actually work to prevent Trump from winning.  So all democrats in Utah should vote for the independent this cycle!
16 | Barbara Healey | 2 | 1339687446127504_1339723472790568 | So what?? We wanted honesty, we got honesty! Kaine and Pence say strange things and no one makes a noise. No matter what he says someone will have something negative to say. Don't worry about it and stay on track. GARY JOHNSON for President!
17 | Patricia Lowry | 2 | 1339687446127504_1339710346125214 | Then why the hell did you run with Johnson. YOU should have been backing Hillary instead of dissing her.Now you see your mistake, HOPE it is not too little ,too late.
18 | Lina Marce | 6 | 1339687446127504_1339751819454400 | I have So much Respect for this guy! It takes a true selfless act to come forward even if he will be criticized. He puts the country and the American people first.
19 | Carmen Cardona | 3 | 1339687446127504_1340016992761216 | Paul Ryan, Mc Cain, and many other in the Republican party did not have the courage to say, what they know is TRUE: They fear for the Country in Trump's hands, but they did not have guts to say it!!
20 | Christopher Johnson | 3 | 1339687446127504_1339838746112374 | I'm so anxious about this that my stomach is turning, I have headaches, I dream about it at night, and have trouble sleeping.  I'm sure I'm not alone.  But I very much fear for our country - even if he's not elected - because he's whipped to a froth the anger and worst aspects of our citizenry.
21 | Mary Lawrence | 1 | 1339687446127504_1339785089451073 | If he really does then why didn't he vocally back Hillary from the start instead of join Gary Johnson in a ridiculous campaign that peeled off some independents and democrats to the Libertarian party?  What a waste of time and energy.
22 | Diana Patton Price | 4 | 1339687446127504_1339736489455933 | Kenneth Starr, Who Tried to Bury Bill Clinton, Now Only Praises Him"An unlikely voice recently bemoaned the decline of civility in presidential politics, warned that “deep anger” was fueling an “almost radical populism” and sang the praises of former President Bill Clinton — particularly his “redemptive” years of philanthropic work since leaving the White House.The voice was that of Kenneth W. Starr, the former Whitewater independent counsel, whose Javert-like pursuit of Mr. Clinton in the 1990s helped bring a new intensity to partisan warfare and led to the impeachment of a president for only the second time in the nation’s history.The presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Donald J. Trump, increasingly seems to be trying to relitigate the scandals that Mr. Starr investigated, dredging up allegations of sexual transgressions by Mr. Clinton to accuse Hillary Clinton — the likely Democratic nominee — of having aided and enabled her husband at the expense of Mr. Clinton’s female accusers.But Mr. Starr expressed regret last week that so much of Mr. Clinton’s legacy remained viewed through the lens of what Mr. Starr demurely termed “the unpleasantness.”His remarks seemed almost to absolve Mr. Clinton, if not to exonerate him..."http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/25/us/politics/ken-starr-impeachment-bill-clinton.html?_r=0

1 | Sue Hecht | 407 | 1339639156132333_1339640582798857 | Here's a good rule of thumb, never vote for the person the KKK supports. nor a child rapist, sexual predator, someone who does not pay his workers or lawyers, and tax evader
2 | Walter C. Brown | 139 | 1339639156132333_1339644942798421 | Donald goes go to court in November for bilking hard working Americans out of their money by fraud. That's public record. And Trump does also go to court this December for child rape. That too is public record. In fact there are 76 pending court cases against Trump right now. He leaves a path of destruction wherever he goes. You know what is exceedingly telling that one person who worked with him for 2 years as a ghost writer of one of his books just pointed out in an interview? Trump has no friends. He has no grade school friends. He has no college friends. He has no business friends. More often than not people who leave his employ hate him. People who he's done other business deals with disrespect him. That's weird. That speaks volumes about his poor character. The only people willing to speak on Donald's behalf are his paid pundits, people who think they might get a White House job if he wins (i.e. Christie) and his kids (who are also on his payroll). Evidently he doesn't just say hateful things at his bambastic rallies .... he just is a HATEFUL PERSON.
3 | Claudia Beiger | 117 | 1339639156132333_1339645792798336 | I refuse to believe it will be even close. I actually have more faith in our country than to think people are actually voting for that Trump idiot.
4 | Regina Dear | 54 | 1339639156132333_1339656439463938 | He must be so proud..."Not all Donald Trump supporters are white supremacists, but all white supremacists appear to be Donald Trump supporters. The Ku Klux Klan gave their blessing, officially endorsing Donald Trump on the front page of their latest newspaper edition. You must be so proud, Republicans. Just today, Congressman Paul Ryan admitted he already voted for Donald Trump in his home state of Wisconsin. That’s a racist, misogynistic stink that won’t wear off in 2020, Congressman. Even if you can’t bear to say his name out loud. "...
5 | Rachel Anne Osborn Martin | 34 | 1339639156132333_1339653892797526 | The run away Trumpmania Train is close to running this country off the cliff. One item making it closer is increase in healthcare premiums because Republican eroded some of the measures designed to offset these. They did it to sabotage it for political gain. Now we are paying the price. They say they will repeal which will end insurance for 17.6 million people. If you think that will stop the rising cost of healthcare which is the real driver of premiums you will be disappointed. Repeal is not going to magically reduce premiums. It will mean insurance only for those who are well off.
6 | Frankie T Inzinna | 45 | 1339639156132333_1339673279462254 | The polls can tighten all they want 30 million people already voted and Hillary is doing fine and if the Florida early voting results are true and she's goin to win 28% of republicans the election is over. Trump can't win with out Florida. So they will be a Madam president elect this time next week. The polls don't mean anything any more

8 | Margaret Steinhoff | 10 | 1339639156132333_1339816769447905 | This is also how I feel. It's almost over for me.  Dear Mr. Trump, It’s taken me a while to realize this and to admit it, but I’m grateful to you. For the past few months I’ve spent a good deal of time lamenting your campaign and the poison it has so effortlessly generated. I’ve watched our country imploding, our public discourse become polluted, our political climate grows ever more corrosive, and wrongly assumed you were to blame. It’s only lately I’ve come to understand that you haven’t manufactured our current national ugliness—you’ve simply revealed it. By saying the irresponsible, mean-spirited, ignorant things you say so freely and so frequently, you’ve given other like-minded people license to do the same. You’ve opened up the floodgates for our corporate sewage to flow fully. People no longer conceal their vile mess, they now revel in it, they broadcast it and retweet it. You’ve made bigotry and racism socially acceptable again and that has been a kind of twisted gift because it’s allowed me to really see people; not as they pretend to be on the surface—but in the very depths of their wounded, weaponized hearts. Over and over as your campaign has persisted, your supporters would tell me that they like you because you “speak your mind”. It wasn’t until recently that I’ve realized that you speak their minds. You’ve given credence to their prejudices and made those prejudices go mainstream. Thanks to the terrible ground you’ve broken, politicians, pastors, friends, and strangers, both in person and on social media now regularly out themselves as hateful, intolerant, and malicious—and they remind me just how close they are to me, just how deep the sickness in us runs, and just how far we have to go together. You’ve emboldened people to be open about things they used to conceal for the sake of decorum, and though it turns my stomach, I know that this is the only way we can move forward; to have that cancerous stuff exposed fully so that it can be dealt with. Our progress as a nation is predicated on authentic dialogue, no matter how brutal and disheartening that dialogue is. In other words, you’ve let us know what we’re really dealing with here and while it’s been rightly disturbing, it’s also been revelatory. That’s the thing about that kind of harsh light: you’re forced to see everything. Beauty and monstrosity equally illuminated. Now don’t get me wrong, I think you’re the least qualified, least knowledgeable Presidential candidate we may ever have had participate this far into the process, and if you somehow were elected I’d fear gravely for the world my children would inherit—should it survive your Presidency at all. I believe you’re reckless, bitter, and completely reprehensible; the very worst kind of bully. But whether you win or lose, you’ve already allowed me the blessing of Truth; about me, about you, about other candidates, about our nation. And in the process you’ve also shown me that I am not alone in resisting you and this ugly thing you’ve revealed about us. You’ve generated an equally loud, equally passionate response to it and this is where I find my hope these days. I find it in those for whom equality isn’t just a cheap buzzword, it’s the most precious of hills to die on. I find it in those people who refuse to be silent in the face of our impending shared regression. I find it in those willing to be bolder in defending the inherent value of all people. I find it in the growing army of those who will not tolerate hatred as a core American value. I find it in those who reject violence as our default response to dissension. I find it in the ever rising voice of people who will not let malice and bitterness represent them in the world. Today I find my hope in those who, like me, will not be complicit in allowing bigotry and intolerance to become a source of national pride, because we’ve seen where that leads. Yes, Mr Trump, you’ve unearthed our hidden sickness and you’ve allowed it to go viral. You brought every awful thing about us out into the open. You will NEVER Get My Vote!

10 | David Jude Thomas | 1 | 1339639156132333_1339778979451684 | Michael Moore is very correct!!!! I've been saying this for the past year. I've also said, continually, that Trump will continue his election plans while all the other pundits dismissed him. Between his umpteen years pretended to be president on his NBC show, entering the political field by claiming that Obama was not  born in this country, he was primed for his latest "role ". Also going after the bottom feeders of society, he was set to challenge any appointment. Now with the vague letter to Congress from Comey.... he very well might wind up being the 45th president of the United States. To quote the tagline of the 1980s remake of the fly; "Be afraid be very afraid"!!!!
11 | Sascha Eisner | 5 | 1339639156132333_1339709699458612 | MISOGYNY is when the male candidate has a university fraud trial date in November, a child rape trial date in December, 73 other pending lawsuits, BUT the media focus is on emails the female candidate didn't even send.

You will never bring this country together because your existence in the political arena is a major reason we are divided in the first place. We will never get behind you. We will treat your proposals and ideas the same way you would treat an 8 month old fetus... we will rip them apart every time. You will go down in history as exactly what you truly are, nothing but a nasty disgusting excuse for a woman.

19 | Tammy Mohr Burt | 5 | 1339639156132333_1339665206129728 | I was asked tonight how I could ever support Trump after the comments he made over 11 years ago about women and if I would still support him if he made those comments to my daughter? My response was this....If he had put our nations security at risk, I would not vote for him. If his organization received large donations from countries that killed women and gays, I would not vote for him. If he boasted 30 Years of government experience, but still could not discern if an email was classified or not, without someone letting him know if it was or not, I would not vote for him. If he boasted about how he has defended children his entire life, but is for abortion, (even late term, when the child can feel pain) I would not vote for him. If he wanted my 3 year old Granddaughter to go to restrooms with men dressed as women, I would not vote for him. I have taught my daughter and will teach my granddaughter to disregard sexist remarks and move on, especially when they were made so many years ago and, also to forgive those who say they are sorry. If he caused lives to be destroyed in Benghazi and then lied to the faces of the parents as they stood at their child's casket, I would not vote for him. If people who came against him mysteriously turned up dead, I would not vote for him. If he suddenly developed a southern accent when he was in the South, campaigning, I would not vote for him. If he continually broke the law and that was ignored, I would not vote for him, but right now, the only person who does all these things is Hillary. Right now, the fact that Donald made these remarks over 12 years ago, does not move me. I'm bigger than those remarks and we all have said stupid things throughout our lives. To me, the fact that Hillary lies continuously, is a much bigger problem. We can see the effects of her lies by the state of our poor country right now...Still voting for Trump
20 | Julio Garcia | 0 | 1339639156132333_1340019486094300 | If you have the right to vote, please do so as many people residing in the U.S. cannot. This man is a monster and will probably start WWIII to say the least. I know Hillary is not perfect but at least we know she has what it takes to lead this great nation. If you want to go back to the days MLK got killed then #VoteTrump, if you're a bigot #VoteTrump, if you don't care about this country #VoteTrump, if you want your children to live in a torn up country #VoteTrump, if you have no soul/values #VoteTrump, I know this country is founded on Laws but no man in this country is here 'Lawfully' with the those Laws written by Native American blood. If we follow the laws of god and have basic morals we would have no problem with our neighbors, we would embrace them instead regardless of orientation, religion, disability, race and anything that Trump does not stand for. I'm done talking about this bigot as he is wasting my time and energy. Again if you can vote go vote, but remember that your vote can either keep the world as is, or make is 100 times worse. God Bless!

This is the same man who predicted a Romney victory in 2012! Stop using him as some kind of political expert.
22 | Lynda Magary | 0 | 1339639156132333_1339891846107064 | Trump has a chance with both the votes but really needs the electoral college.  I think Clinton campaign with President Obama and gang is going overboard pushing for more campaigning,etc.  If Clinton had in the bag.  She would be slowing down not increasing everything to max....it reminds me of her 2008 primaries....i think she running out stream and same attacks no on her issues or plans....she digging into past election campaigns for ideas.....she isn't really the first acting female president was the title goes Edith Wilson when he husband had a stroke... it only be for been elected not using a loophole in US constitution which was amended so First Lady cannot step into the role of acting president.

Donald Trump's campaign is making moves into Democratic states, but is it a strategy borne out of strength or desperation?

1 | Merv Russell | 160 | 1339602779469304_1339608689468713 | And yet Trump will NEVER have the majority  Black vote, Hispanic vote, LGBT vote, woman, Asian vote, Native American vote or educated vote!  So tell me again how it's close? That's the media's way of keeping you watching. Just vote!
2 | Storm King | 108 | 1339602779469304_1339604722802443 | Russia has Trump in it's back pocket. The polls are getting closer to even. Trump is an egomaniacal, narcissistic toddler with a bad tan. If he wins, a large number of people are going to be clinically depressed for a long time. Do not vote for the candidate supported by the KKK
3 | John Robinson | 77 | 1339602779469304_1339604489469133 | Six more days until the Great Trumpkin Meltdown of 2016. Six more days before Trump's head explodes like forgetting to put the lid on the blender when you made an orange smoothie. Six more days until we elect our FIRST female president. Six more days until this year and a half national nightmare is OVER!
4 | Javon Coleman | 34 | 1339602779469304_1339605216135727 | Definitely desperation. He still needs to win most of if not all of the current swing states or turn some blue ones red. So yea he has his work cut out for him lol.

And the media wants to be relevant so I dont believe half of the crap they say ..she is 15 points above, no she is 2 points above, now she is even with Trump no now he is ahead....wait no she is double digits ahead... And this is the crap we get..and each newspaper comes up with half a dozen different scenarios within the course of a few hours.. They have stopped reporting news a long time ago and just go for ratings by being tabloid type papers.. The headlines they post usually bear little to no resemblance to the actual story.
11 | Barbara Roney | 7 | 1339602779469304_1339650719464510 | School children across America voted in their classrooms yesterday. They voted for the next President and Hillary Clinton won.

Especially if you win Tuesday. We will never accept you as our President. You and your husband are nothing but criminals and will be treated as such. You will never bring this country together because your existence in the political arena is a major reason we are divided in the first place. We will never get behind you. We will treat your proposals and ideas the same way you would treat an 8 month old fetus... we will rip them apart every time. You will go down in history as exactly what you truly are, nothing but a nasty disgusting excuse for a woman.

17 | Blakeney Adams | 3 | 1339602779469304_1339620562800859 | You know I don't know if Trump is going to win or not and we will definitely find out very shortly. It's just the desperation that I'm seeing by the Democratic Party that makes me just want to laugh. A lot of the mainstream news media are desperately doing whatever they can to tarnish Donald Trumps reputation and throw him in the limelight and get the limelight off Hillary Clinton. Every time they do it they just look desperate and pathetic. You can't make this stuff up people. 😂😂😂.
18 | JR Campbell | 0 | 1339602779469304_1339798419449740 | The media wants an audience.. They want everyone to think its close.. It may very well be, who knows.. After Romneys defeat last election, and the media claiming it was 'close', its hard to know who to believe.. Polls are only as good as the sample, and the data set the conclusions are drawn from, the statistics used, and involves more analysis than is obvious..   One day, Trump is supposed to lose by a landslide, a few days later, he has a good chance to win.. There cant possibly that much indecision, that many that are really undecided.. Has a lot to do with demographics, turn out.. Many republicans I know are not going to vote for Trump or Hillary.. With the minority voter suppression,  college ID's  not acceptable, closing of minority voting locations, and cutting down early voting days, who knows.. The election might very well be 'rigged', but by the republicans..And Comey's and the FBI getting illegally involved in the election, Trump has a chance.. Its frightening and disturbing..
19 | Margaret Steinhoff | 0 | 1339602779469304_1339813779448204 | Margaret Steinhoff · This is also how I feel. It's almost over for me.  Dear Mr. Trump, It’s taken me a while to realize this and to admit it, but I’m grateful to you. For the past few months I’ve spent a good deal of time lamenting your campaign and the poison it has so effortlessly generated. I’ve watched our country imploding, our public discourse become polluted, our political climate grows ever more corrosive, and wrongly assumed you were to blame. It’s only lately I’ve come to understand that you haven’t manufactured our current national ugliness—you’ve simply revealed it. By saying the irresponsible, mean-spirited, ignorant things you say so freely and so frequently, you’ve given other like-minded people license to do the same. You’ve opened up the floodgates for our corporate sewage to flow fully. People no longer conceal their vile mess, they now revel in it, they broadcast it and retweet it. You’ve made bigotry and racism socially acceptable again and that has been a kind of twisted gift because it’s allowed me to really see people; not as they pretend to be on the surface—but in the very depths of their wounded, weaponized hearts. Over and over as your campaign has persisted, your supporters would tell me that they like you because you “speak your mind”. It wasn’t until recently that I’ve realized that you speak their minds. You’ve given credence to their prejudices and made those prejudices go mainstream. Thanks to the terrible ground you’ve broken, politicians, pastors, friends, and strangers, both in person and on social media now regularly out themselves as hateful, intolerant, and malicious—and they remind me just how close they are to me, just how deep the sickness in us runs, and just how far we have to go together. You’ve emboldened people to be open about things they used to conceal for the sake of decorum, and though it turns my stomach, I know that this is the only way we can move forward; to have that cancerous stuff exposed fully so that it can be dealt with. Our progress as a nation is predicated on authentic dialogue, no matter how brutal and disheartening that dialogue is. In other words, you’ve let us know what we’re really dealing with here and while it’s been rightly disturbing, it’s also been revelatory. That’s the thing about that kind of harsh light: you’re forced to see everything. Beauty and monstrosity equally illuminated. Now don’t get me wrong, I think you’re the least qualified, least knowledgeable Presidential candidate we may ever have had participate this far into the process, and if you somehow were elected I’d fear gravely for the world my children would inherit—should it survive your Presidency at all. I believe you’re reckless, bitter, and completely reprehensible; the very worst kind of bully. But whether you win or lose, you’ve already allowed me the blessing of Truth; about me, about you, about other candidates, about our nation. And in the process you’ve also shown me that I am not alone in resisting you and this ugly thing you’ve revealed about us. You’ve generated an equally loud, equally passionate response to it and this is where I find my hope these days. I find it in those for whom equality isn’t just a cheap buzzword, it’s the most precious of hills to die on. I find it in those people who refuse to be silent in the face of our impending shared regression. I find it in those willing to be bolder in defending the inherent value of all people. I find it in the growing army of those who will not tolerate hatred as a core American value. I find it in those who reject violence as our default response to dissension. I find it in the ever rising voice of people who will not let malice and bitterness represent them in the world. Today I find my hope in those who, like me, will not be complicit in allowing bigotry and intolerance to become a source of national pride, because we’ve seen where that leads. Yes, Mr Trump, you’ve unearthed our hidden sickness and you’ve allowed it to go viral. You brought every awful thing about us out into the open. You will NEVER Get My Vote!
20 | Al Snook | 0 | 1339602779469304_1339710032791912 | Neither. This move is only designed to keep the Media talking about Dangerous Donald all day, all the time.Every move he makes is aimed at keeping his face on tv.  The media dutifully follows his lead. No more reasoning behind it than that.Just think, how would he maintain his tv ego, if he were President. What idiotic things would he pull to get media attention every day.Certainly Presidential press conferences with those dreaded questions would not be in the mix. That is unless he bans all reporters.

There is room for more than just two parties
22 | Joel Natale | 2 | 1339602779469304_1339610086135240 | Obama received 67 million votes - hillary will get only around 55 million. She is 20 million short in black/Hispanic/young/gay voters. She gets about 8 million extra females --55 million total!  Romney received 62 million votes - Trump gets 1 million more blacks than Romney, 4 million more Christians ( since he's ot Mormon ) but loses 5 million women. Trump ends up with 62 million votes.... 7 million vote WIN FOR TRUMP

4 | Maria Rodriguez Klimka | 78 | 1339569309472651_1339580889471493 | The reality is that you can repeat a bunch of lies over and over again about Hillary and all that it shows is the ignorance that Trump supporters are dealing with as they repeat his ignorant leader words...
5 | Johnny Meller | 160 | 1339569309472651_1339570236139225 | The reality is she is a crook, a liar.....also a scumbag who will never get elected.....anyone who thinks she is otherwise needs to see a doctor asap.
6 | Al Gi Carrillo | 39 | 1339569309472651_1339584542804461 | So, I am reading that Hillary is really upset that the FBI is "dumping" on her right before the election.... I want to say to Mrs. Clinton, "So Hillary, how does it feel to be aborted 8 days before delivery?" Stole that comment, but it is awesome!
7 | Wes Lewis | 66 | 1339569309472651_1339573219472260 | Dear Hillary supporters have a ? for you.Dear Hillary Supporter, Did you miss the part where she lied to congress? You know that’s called perjury…. Did you miss hearing about her being fired from the Watergate staff for being dishonest and unethical?How about those 33,000 emails she deleted and then had the computer wiped clean by professionals? Did you miss that? How about deleting emails after she was subpoenaed to hand them over to the Fed? You realize that’s Obstruction of Justice, right? Oh, and how about getting the rapist of a teenage girl off on rape charges then laughing about it? Did you miss that too?How about when she lied to the American people about Benghazi? You realize that story about the video was a lie, and she knew it was a lie, right?Did you miss her lying to the American people about her emails? How about when she lied about being under sniper fire?Well, then there was those times she lied about lying to the American people. Miss those too?What about that ‘pay for play’ with the Clinton Cash Foundation? That’s kind of hard to miss, huh?Did you miss all those other scandals she was in? You know… TravelGate, FileGate, WhiteWater, Rose law Firm, Vince Foster… she has a long list of scandals, you know... Did you miss her belittling her husband's sexual harassment ( and rape ) accusers? Oh – but the Paula Jones case was settled for $850,000 and Bill was impeached… for lying…You know she was labeled "Extremely careless" about national security by the FBI, right? Have you caught her latest lies about not knowing what the (C) meant on the classified documents? Or, that she can’t remember any briefings on how to handle classified material? Did you know that during her interview with the FBI she said she couldn’t remember 39 times? Did you know that during the Star Investigation she used that same defense of ‘I don’t recall’ 56 times? Did you hear her say she will raise taxes on the middle class? Did you know she had to return stolen items from the White House the last time they left? Did you miss the fact that her and Bill Clinton stole 6 Billion Dollars that was meant to rebuild Haiti?Have you seen the movies and several documentaries made about her questionable ethics? Don’t you wonder why she made congress and others spend millions and millions of tax dollars having hearings and investigating her numerous times, finding that she lied, that would not have been spent if she would have simply told the truth in the first place ! Facts - all facts ! But you are going to vote for her because.... you don't like Donald Trump?Now, That is Insane!Hillary Clinton has a lot more to hide than Donald Trump does!I will close by saying please don't forget to vote on November 8th for Donald J. Trump and make America Great Again!
8 | John Cano | 33 | 1339569309472651_1339612676134981 | If Hillary Clinton was the criminal they described you think she would have a charge, a conviction, some kind of sanction, given some kind of fine. There's nothing, not even a traffic ticket. She even disclosed her taxes. Which included her husbands taxes. The claims made against the Clinton's just don't amount to much nor do they come close to the life time of Donald Trumps transgressions. He actually stiffs people, outright lies, refuses to disclose his taxes. Between the two candidates dealings and temperament, experience, education I'm voting for Hillary Clinton.

Obummer and Lynch has granted illegals to get driver lic.and all they have to do is check yes I am a citizen there for they can voteat least 4 million of them are doingso and not enforcing the law.they also have found 10's of thousand of dead people also voting.Even as large of a movement is this,,I find it next to impossible for Donald Trump to win. pure corruption.

15 | Carolyn Stevens | 24 | 1339569309472651_1339582669471315 | FYI: There is absolutely nothing Secretary Clinton could have done with e-mails that would convince me to vote for donald instead
16 | Richard Kelly | 9 | 1339569309472651_1339606716135577 | America may survive a Trump presidency but the era of the deplorables will leave a lasting stench on our history for the world to see.
17 | Connie Greene | 4 | 1339569309472651_902406096559909 | Looks like Hillary Clinton has always known what she is about. Those side chair analyses coming from the other side might well be better used tending to their own backyards.
18 | Jeanne Brooks-Miller | 5 | 1339569309472651_1339577322805183 | I just flipped the channel and Morning Joe is on...but I would like to know why MSNBC keeps Mika on...she does not know how to pronounce words which are not commonly used and she is just not a news anchor...at all...she is always turning to look at the camera when someone is talking and she is always looking behind her....surely MSNBC can find someone better.
19 | Tom Siskron IV | 4 | 1339569309472651_1339603439469238 | The headline of this is a SAD, SAD reflection of the state of our republic. That half of America would elect this obviously corrupt woman bent of destroying the constitution and our national sovereignty while enriching her personal coffers is diheartening for our future.

22 | John Kelly | 3 | 1339569309472651_902412346559284 | The news media is going to make this race seem much closer than it actually is. For one big reason. It's $weeps in November. In case you don't know this is when they set their advertising prices so everybody's trying to get big huge ratings during November. This election has been the best thing that ever happened to any news media outlet and they want to milk every penny out of it, to the very end. If you don't know this by now get this your heads everything is about money...... even you.
23 | Liz Homer | 1 | 1339569309472651_902338029900049 | I saw some of the interviews and reporting on this. It was disgusting, especially before we knew anything. No wonder the media is held in such low esteem.  In the meantime lots of people don't know the truth about Trump.
24 | Neale Woodbury | 2 | 1339569309472651_902444649889387 | Says the liberal news media proven to be in bed with this disgusting female. Not just MSNBC but it's parent company, also in bed with this wench, can piss off. Your channels will never appear on my TV again and I don't care what shows you have. I'll watch them on Netflix.
25 | Zaferia Cambra | 6 | 1339569309472651_902407846559734 | I can't wait for this to be over. The witch hunt has gone on too long. To endure years of accusations, that woman is made of steel (US steel!) if trump wins we will have pence, (trump will have too many law suits against him) who is far scarier than trump!

2 | Keith Christenbury | 52 | 1141709569246810_1141851615899272 | Everyone is now reporting that Hillary leads by 8 in early FL voting and that 28% of early Republican voters voted for Hillary. Trump cant win without FL. He has absolutely no path without FL.
3 | Cathy Good Welker | 36 | 1141709569246810_1141824952568605 | Just a thought...Why is no one talking about Huma Abedin's family? You know her mother who is a strong supporter of Sharia Law and her father who represents the Muslim Brotherhood. And why Hillary has accepted 25 million in donations from Saudia Arabia?  Huma as you know is Hillarys personal assistant and her blood runs deep in Saudia Arabia with her father even supporting Al Queda. And btw, where is Huma after the FBI announced their decision to do further investigations? Why hide if there's nothing to hide?? She is a Muslim married to a Jew which would have been forbidden in the Muslim faith unless it was for a greater cause..Spy? One of the releases by the FBI stated that Huma has been on the 'espionage watch' since April.

5 | John Phelan | 8 | 1141709569246810_1141889062562194 | Have any of you people who are so offended by all of Hillary's "crimes" every heard of Scooter Libbey or Dick Cheney? To refresh your memories, they're the guys who deliberately compromised a United States covert operative because they were mad at her husband, who wouldn't play ball with them as they fabricated evidence to provoke a ruinous war. They weren't merely careless with security, they deliberately compromised it with the explicit goal of endangering specific American lives. The only reason they aren't in prison is because we decided long ago that one of the pillars of American exceptionalism is that we don't have new rulers sweeping into power and immediately jailing their political opponents like some banana republic dictator. Save the phony outrage and "lock her up chants." You just sound like idiots whose grasp of history doesn't go back even 10 years, or hypocrites who don't care.

Besides taking insider questions BEFORE the Sanders debate, which is deplorable! These emails expose many things about the Clintons, including, Bill pardoning 170 people in the last few days of his presidency, including Mark Rich in the last minutes of his presidency, that everyone knows we're payoffs...more scandals and investigations, along with the $20 million in Haiti donations that didn't go to Haiti but went to her Brother to buy him a mine! Further the emails talk about her $30 million donation to her foundation from Morocco in 2 installments, (18 mil & 12mil) to close a phosphate factor in Colorado so Morocco can be the largest in the world releasing 5,000 American workers, for her personal financial gain! St Jude charity raised $23 million in donations last year and hers raised $299 million! Does something seem wrong here? Good god, open your eyes, it's endless and certainly not just about her disposing of some harmless emails after being subpoenaed, which is a FELONY! I won't mention the $20 she took for the uranium to Iran! God help us while we wait for you all to catch up...lets pray her "pay to play" days, (that gives this monster her power), are over!

The level of criminality is almost farcical at this point... I think it’s possible that you ended up with the most corrupt presidential candidate in American history because you fundamentally reject the very concept of morality. Liberalism is an ideology of relativism. On the left, everything is relative, from human life to marriage to gender to morality. There are consequences to this philosophy. When you don’t have any set moral standard, when you don’t hold yourself and your leaders to an objective ethical code, it’s inevitable that eventually you’ll end up nominating an actual mafia boss."  http://www.theblaze.com/contributions/commentary-liberals-you-cant-lecture-about-trump-when-you-helped-nominate-a-depraved-crook/

What is incredible is that THEY ARE THE SAME FACTS. That is, there is conclusive evidence of: sale of government influence of personal profit while Secretary of State, including approving sale of weapons to ISIS supporting countries in exchange for millionaire donations to her foundation; that Huma Abedin declared that Hillary did not want her Clinton Foundation dealings to be seen by the State Department officials (since they were intertwined), so she set up a private unencrypted, unsecured server through which she channeled ALL her official emails, which included those entailing her Pay-to-Play schemes; that such information was accesible to foreign nations and insurgency groups which used it against the US, including the Benghazi attack; that the day after she was subpoenaed by the Benghazi Committee to turn over her emails, she ordered them permanently wiped out; 33,000 were never recovered; that she lied to Congress under oath about all this fiasco (like Bill did years before).

The problem for Donald J. Trump is that he can't just hold the line of how the GOP did in the last election, because that was a losing campaign. In Nevada, for example, he's doing as well as Mitt Romney did at this stage of the election, but that's actually bad news for Trump.

17 | John Phelan | 0 | 10154052444519067_10154052563284067 | Hey folks. All of the news organizations decided years ago not to reveal election-day exit poll numbers that allowed them to call states for a candidate before the polls closed in that state. I just saw Brian Williams quote a survey of people who have voted early, and used it to imply that the Presidential race is "over" in Florida. How is this "survey" different from an exit poll, and how is using it this way different from the thing you all promised not to do years ago? Is your position that it's ok to call a race a week in advance, just not a few hours in advance on election day? Believe me, I'm thrilled if your conclusion is correct. I just don't think you should be discussing surveys of people who have already voted now.
18 | Jeanne Brooks-Miller | 1 | 10154052444519067_10154053444074067 | I think Rachel Maddow talks to hear herself talk ! She already reported an untruth earlier about Russia - I honestly hope all the bias networks lose their ratings and in turn lose their shows. They do not report what the people need to hear but instead what the networks want us to hear.
19 | Dennis G. McAuliffe | 5 | 10154052444519067_10154052470359067 | so tell us what is good about Donald Trump’s presidency which will “significantly” weaken the country, his tax cuts would add 9.5 Trillion to the debt,  driving the U.S. into a “lengthy recession” with nearly 3.5 million job losses and a 7 percent unemployment rate, according to a Moody’s Analytics analysis.The tax code under Mr. Trump’s plan will be much less progressive than the current tax code. More than one-third of the proposed tax cuts on personal income will go to the top 1% of income earners, with the average taxpayer in this group receiving a reduction in their tax bill of $275,000. Taxpayers in the bottom 99% of income earners will receive a tax cut of less than $2,500.Under Trump's plan, the conservative Tax Foundation expects that the bottom 80 percent of Americans will see just 0.8 percent to 1.8 percent more income after his tax cuts. Clinton's plan will only increase taxes for America's wealthiest earners.The large increase in tariffs on Chinese and Mexican imports supported by Mr. Trump further exacerbates inflation pressures. The U.S. imports nearly $500 billion in goods a year from China, and another almost $300 billion from Mexico, accounting for approximately 35% of total U.S. non-petroleum goods imports. Outside of Canada, no other country comes close as a source of imports. Slapping a 45% tariff on Chinese imports and 35% on non-petroleum Mexican imports thus increases overall goods import prices by approximately 15%.would most likely retaliate with in-kind tariffs on U.S. imports. This would be a big hit to U.S. exports, as we ship well over $100 billion in products a year to China, and almost $250 billion to Mexico.And the problem with trumps outspoken approach to Mexican immigration, his “plan” to deport 11 million undocumented immigrants would shrink the economy by about 2 percent, according to American Action Forum (AAF), a conservative and pro-business think tank. The sudden subtraction of 7 million workers would cause an immediate shock to thousands of businesses, triggering a GDP collapse ranging from $400 billion to $600 billion in productionNot to overlook Donald Trump who casts himself as a protector of workers and jobs, but a USA TODAY NETWORK investigation found hundreds of people – carpenters, dishwashers, painters, even his own lawyers – who say he didn’t pay them for their work. And uses undocumented labor along with Chinese Steel over American for his hotels and resorts !

The Clinton Foundation is an ongoing criminal enterprise engaged in money laundering and soliciting bribes in exchange for political, policy and legislative favors to individuals, corporations and even governments both foreign and domestic, violating State Department regulations to include questions about espionage, perjury and influence peddling.	The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) is a United States Federal Law passed in 1970 that was designed to provide a tool for law enforcement agencies to fight organized crime. 	Racketeering may include bribery, counterfeiting, money laundering, embezzlement, illegal gambling, kidnapping, murder, drug trafficking, slavery, and a host of other nefarious business practices.  A conviction under RICO comes when the Department of Justice proves that the Clintons have engaged in two or more examples of racketeering 	Hillary Clinton is guilty of exposing classified documents to foreign governments by placing them illegally on her server, of sending and receiving classified documents and conspiring with her staff to circumvent the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) by avoiding the use of the State Department run servers.  Some of the documents were so highly classified the the investigators on the case weren’t even able to examine the material themselves until they got their own clearances raised to the highest levels.		Tens of millions of dollars donated to the Clinton Foundation was funneled to the organization through a Canadian shell company which has made tracing the donors nearly impossible.  Less than 10% of donations to the Foundation has actually been released to charitable organizations and $2M that has been traced back to long time Bill Clinton's friend, Julie McMahon (aka The Energizer).   When the official investigation into Hillary’s email server began, she instructed her IT professional to delete over 30,000.  The FBI has subsequently recovered the majority, if not all, of Hillary’s deleted emails and are putting together a strong case against her for attempting to cover up her illegal and illicit activities.

Representative Elijah E. Cummings blasted FBI Director James Comey for disclosing the new emails belonging to a top Hillary Clinton aide while refusing to inform Congress of anything it has found regarding Donald J. Trump's foreign business dealings or his ties to Russia.

4 | Tamela Beckman | 71 | 1339264456169803_1339268779502704 | This is an internal coup of Hillary CLinton by WE THE PEOPLE...all departments FED UP WITH THE CORRUPTION are draining the swamp. Info wars.com has the info!
5 | Dennis G. McAuliffe | 46 | 1339264456169803_1339266549502927 | It is the policy of the Justice Department to avoids discussing investigations within 60 days of an election because “voters have no way to interpret FBI/DOJ activity in a neutral way. Cmey  had no business or obligation to write to Congress about supposed new emails that neither he nor anyone in the FBI has ever reviewed,And just prior to his letter Comey argued privately that it was too close to Election Day for the United States government to name Russia as meddling in the U.S. election and ultimately ensured that the FBI's name was not on the document that the U.S. government put out, a former bureau official tells CNBC.It would by all appearances seem he has Violated the Hatch Act and should be investigated!
6 | Pamela Yount Swaringim | 26 | 1339264456169803_1339281006168148 | MSNBC is a little late...the FBI said there is no evidence of Trump's involvement with Russia! That is nothing but desperate Clinton Cartel rhetoric!
7 | Dennis G. McAuliffe | 21 | 1339264456169803_1339267219502860 | Comey is “acting like he’s trying to throw the election,” says Steve Ryan, a prosecutor in Ronald Reagan's Justice Department who worked on organized crime, referring to the FBI director’s “trifecta”—comments about the Hillary Clinton email probe over the summer; his letter last week announcing new evidence related to that case; and now this out-of-the-blue FBI document dump.“It looks worse and worse each day. He’s out of his swim lane.… There’s no precedent for this. I think it’s the most troubling thing I’ve seen out of law enforcement,”A number of Republicans have criticized Comey as well, including Larry Thompson, the deputy attorney general under President George W. Bush.
8 | Joseph Hammontree | 16 | 1339264456169803_1339276069501975 | Really , it was fine when comey pointed out the laws hillary broke then refused to prosecute. But now the f.b.i is tainted. Liberals are trash.period.
9 | Gwen Johnson | 13 | 1339264456169803_1339289659500616 | Mr. Cummings, I think it's time you wake up...the ties you are mentioning about Trump and Russia, have been debunked. Apparently, you biased opinion (against Trump) has either got you not doing research on you own ability or you fail to listed to the news that is reporting it. I do see, however, this interview is done with MSNBC....that explains a great deal. I pray you are NOT re-elected when the time comes.
10 | Huns Core | 12 | 1339264456169803_1339265612836354 | Tie with Russian is great ! At least , keeping a good relationship with super nuclear powers like Russia,China is a good thing for world peace ! but tie with radical Muslim world , especially ISIS is horrible and harmful to America !
11 | Dennis G. McAuliffe | 8 | 1339264456169803_1339266879502894 | What is of great concern is thatFBI Director James Comey argued privately that it was too close to Election Day for the United States government to name Russia as meddling in the U.S. election and ultimately ensured that the FBI's name was not on the document that the U.S. government put out, a former bureau official tells CNBC.The official said some government insiders are perplexed as to why Comey would have election timing concerns with the Russian disclosure but not with the Huma Abedin email discovery disclosure he made Friday.In the end, the Department of Homeland Security and The Office of the Director of National Intelligence issued the statement on Oct. 7, saying: "The U.S. intelligence community is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of emails from U.S. persons and institutions, including from U.S. political organizations. ... These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the U.S. election process.
12 | Sylvia Okeke Emiabata | 1 | 1339264456169803_1339417006154548 | The investigation of Trump connections to Russia is not finished. It is still unfolding.

Donald Trump has a court dates in November for FRAUD and RAPE in December these are real criminal charges and the focus is on Hillary's emails which are probably the same as the ones that rendered nada! Give me a break! Shame on you Mr. Comey!!! You want to talk about emails but not Donald Trump's Russian connection!This is not a third world country! This is the United States of America,a strong and proud democracy! Vote blue up and down the ballot!!!!Get out and vote!
14 | Dianne Lehman Howell | 1 | 1339264456169803_1223812340991392 | I am also so upset over this. Just in time to influence the election, and you can't tell me it wasn't done on purpose.  But now one comes out with the Trump dealings with Russia. Heaven forbid he gets elected.
15 | Alfonso Moreno | 3 | 1339264456169803_1339287282834187 | Yes Mr. Cummings we were also very worried when our FBI said Hillary was not breaking any laws and was just careless but then proceeded to warn the rest of us how doing the exact same thing may get us put in jail . Yes I would say Americans are a tiny bit concerned about the honesty & integrity of The FBI .
16 | Dale Lange | 2 | 1339264456169803_1850395315204206 | The Democrats are doing a great job of creating voting internment camps in most large cities in the US. These camps produce poverty, despair, unemployment, poor education and for some strange reason, Democratic Party voters. Democratic Party leaders survey their urban plantations from the lofty seats of power at City Hall and in Washington DC, and beam with pride over their enslavement of minority voters. Tell the urban plantation Masters that Lincoln freed the slaves.
17 | Richard Parker | 6 | 1339264456169803_1339279252834990 | They have investigated and found no connection. What will be investigated will be how and why Hillary made a deal to sell 20% of American uranium to Russia. Be careful what you ask for. When Trump wins, America will finally see the depth of the Clintons corruption.
18 | Stoney Williamson | 10 | 1339264456169803_1339268476169401 | Clinton is a criminal and you know it! She has surrounded herself with like minded individuals who wish to enrich themselves with wealth and power. She is going down, the question is who is going with her!

20 | Jane Czeskleba Ellison | 6 | 1339264456169803_1339308812832034 | Y'all are way behind. The FBI has already announced that they were not able to show any relationship between Trump and Russia. Stay up on current events. ...Trump 2016

22 | Kathy J. McDow | 6 | 1339264456169803_1339301326166116 | America needs to reward the candidate most qualified and ready to lead on day one.  A unifier, not a divider; one who has an adult temperament; and one who will be the president of all Americans.  I'll leave you to figure out who that candidate is!
23 | Timothy Reents | 1 | 1339264456169803_1339279902834925 | The bar is so low for the cry baby loser trump who chases story's of weiners, not winners.Untrustworthy Trump. Using fake polls, fake newspapers, fake news stories, trolls from all over the world to sell your propaganda... all the while Putin is building a new, much larger, KGB force....  Well seems really really UNTRUSTWORTHY TRUMP!The number of trump campaign staff that have active criminal investigations is growing fast! Thank you trump for being the law and order guy making it so easy to bring these "fringe individuals and groups" , both foreign and domestic,  out of the darkness and into the light of law enforcement.  I however would not support an amnesty deal for you in the process.
24 | George Byers II | 1 | 1339264456169803_1850485815195156 | Oh so now you are reporting what another lying thieving Democrat has to say about the FBI. Y'ALL have got to be the dumbest group of minions in existence. Hahaha-- would be funny if it was not so pitifull
25 | Kevin Van Natta | 3 | 1339264456169803_1850305948546476 | Comey didn't cause this...Russia didn't cause this...Trump didn't cause this...Wikileaks didn't cause this...Hillary and her greed and desire for power bear full responsibility which she has accepted ZERO RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY OF IT.She merely deflects from the issue and blames others whenever possible. #HillaryForPrison

24 | Billie Bressler | 26 | 1554306471256044_1824643107781137 | Never Trump the child Molested..This rapists and racist. But he's rallies are all kkk. You never see mix people. But my vote goes to Hillary Clinton for president USA USA. We love you.

With a week to go, polls are tightening and nerves are fraying.

1 | Chiffon Lott | 71 | 1339233209506261_1339241022838813 | Don't let the Russians influence our election, if we let them get away with it this time they will forever meddle in our affairs. Vote & send a message to Putin that he is not running things over here.
2 | Robert Rich | 45 | 1339233209506261_1339234109506171 | So, if Hillary is going to HATE MONGER and pivot off the issues to avoid her criminal investigation, what can we expect from a Hillary Administration?
3 | Jolie Broadstone | 16 | 1339233209506261_1339263232836592 | Hillary's corruption is CORROSIVE to our great nation. How can any American with an ounce of common sense think that this lying politician deserves the presidency? Instead, she deserves a prison cell and James Comey knows this down deep in his gut.
4 | Belinda Sullivan | 9 | 1339233209506261_1339248969504685 | Don't let the media make you emotional. Use your brains. Study the platforms, find out as much as you can about the Presidential AND VP(they are a heartbeat away from being president) candidates and vote the direction you would like to see America go.
5 | Deirdre Coulter | 15 | 1339233209506261_1339243179505264 | There are too many polls..it's not like it used to be....we get bombarded every second with more bs and people react to it...Stop! It's like taking a pregnancy test every day or checking your kids temperature every 5 minutes...it's obsession mixed with overload. Give us a break for God's sakes.
6 | Deb Templeton | 5 | 1339233209506261_1339286796167569 | Why is mainstream media ignoring this?http://us.blastingnews.com/news/2016/10/mainstream-media-remains-silent-on-donald-trump-rape-lawsuit-of-13-year-old-girl-details-001223271.html
7 | Will McGinnis | 5 | 1339233209506261_1339603266135922 | All you folks who are bashing Clinton... need to honestly look at Trump as well... neither candidate is what we might call 'morally superior'... Trump is a mess as well.. that said... it comes down to policy... Frankly, Clinton has policies that will do more for the middle class than any other candidate... so if you can put aside all the business of sending one or the other to hell... take an honest look at their policies & vote your conscience
8 | Gail Joy Abbott | 3 | 1339233209506261_1339392462823669 | Looks like MSNBC a bit one sided for the old hag. Hopefully her followers are as lazy about voting as they are showing up to her rally's. BTW MSNBC as far as Trump's private servers, emails etc he's not holding sensitive, government classified info. What he does with his personal business has nothing to do with this countries national security and he isn't risking all of our lives.
9 | Benita Collier Evans | 5 | 1339233209506261_1339263879503194 | Man, I am so sick n tired of hearing the word "TIGHTENING"...Good Grief!!!! The National polls means NOTHING, State by State is what counts
10 | George Marshall | 2 | 1339233209506261_1339317526164496 | The enemy of my enemies is my friend. F the Republican pary. F the Democratic Party, F the Washington elites, F the media for spinning and trying to control this election and manipulate us. If the Washington elite and corrupt people in power want him to lose its because he is a threat to their power. He has my vote.
11 | Kevin Doyle | 5 | 1339233209506261_1339390056157243 | It's not about polls, it's about the electoral college. How hard is that to understand?!?I remember Romney thought he'd win because a lot of polls said he would. And he lost in a landslide.
12 | Billy Sawyer | 1 | 1339233209506261_1339404169489165 | Time to get rid of Electoral College and just do 1 person 1 vote like it should be. Everyone's vote should count no matter where you live in the USA. A system setup before mass communication, internet, phones, etc is no longer needed.
13 | April Mitchell | 9 | 1339233209506261_1339233892839526 | A former senior intelligence officer for a Western country who specialized in Russian counterintelligence provided the FBI with information he says shows the Russian government has spent years trying to influence Donald Trump. In June, the officer, who now works for a U.S. firm gathering information on Russia for corporate clients, was told to research the Republican presidential nominee's dealings in Russia, Mother Jones reported Monday night."It started off as a fairly general inquiry," the ex-spy said.As he searched, he says he found “an established exchange of information between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin of mutual benefit."Citing it as an “extraordinary situation,” the ex-intelligence officer sent a copy of his report to the FBI. In it, he charged that Russian intelligence had "compromised" Trump and could "blackmail him” and that it had a file on Hillary Clinton compiled from "bugged conversations she had on various visits to Russia and intercepted phone calls."He said FBI officials greeted his July memo with “shock and horror” but did not request additional information.The FBI then asked him for more memos in August, he added, prompting him to submit dossiers on members of Trump’s inner circle with ties to Russia.“It’s quite clear there was or is a pretty substantial inquiry going on,” he said of the FBI’s examination of Trump’s links to Moscow.“This is something of huge significance, way above party politics,” the former spy added. “I think [Trump’s] own party should be aware of this stuff as well.”Mother Jones said the ex-spy spent almost two decades on Russian intelligence matters and now works with a U.S. firm that gathers information on Russia for corporate clients.The former intelligence official began researching Trump earlier this year, it said, as part of an opposition research project funded by a Republican client critical of the billionaire.Mother Jones added that the project’s funding switched to Democratic supporters before the anonymous source discovered troubling connections between Russia and Trump.“There was an established exchange of information between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin of mutual benefit,” he said, according to Russian sources he contacted while researching Trump.Trump has repeatedly weathered criticism from Democrats and other Republicans over his sometimes warm tone toward Russian President Vladimir Putin.Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) alleged over that the FBI has “explosive information” about ties between Trump and the Russian government.Reid declined to divulge additional details about the information or to clarify how federal officials discovered it during his Oct. 30 letter to FBI Director James Comey.
14 | Wisdom Ibeagi | 0 | 1339233209506261_1339385236157725 | She belongs in Federal Prison!! Only the ignorant can support this profoundly corrupt woman! She Belongs in Federal Prison already!! The 25 things that are truly important about Hillary instead of this left wing fluff: 1. When did she know her husband was a serial abuser, and does she feel guilty for destroying his accusers? 2. Explain precisely the trades made in the Cattle Futures scandal where $1,000 was turned into $99,000 in a matter of weeks? 3. Why didn't she do anything to protect the Americans in Benghazi? 4. Who is Saul Alinsky and why was he her mentor? 5. When she was working on Watergate, why did her boss Zeifman, a lifelong Democrat, call Hillary a “liar” and “an unethical, dishonest lawyer” and have her fired? 6. What really happened with Travelgate? 7. What really happened with the Rose Law Firm? 8. What really happened with WhiteWater? 9. What gave Hillary the right to see private FBI files of her political enemies in FileGate? 10. Why won't she turn over her illegal server with state department e-mails to congress? 11. Why does your foundation accept money from avowed terror states? 12. What is her take on the Vince Foster "Suicide"? 13. Why did she think she was entitled to steal the White House furniture when she left? 14. Why do you lie even about things that mean nothing: lying about being under sniper fire in Bosnia, lying about being named after Sir Edmund Hillary, or lying that your grandparents were immigrants. 15. Should America be concerned that in ChinaGate, the 22 people that were convicted of fraud or for funneling Asian funds into the DNC were associates of Bill Clinton? 16. Did selling stays at the Lincoln Bedroom to political donors make you feel like a wh)o(re? 17. Does Hillary think Juanita Broadrick lied when she said on national news that Bill Clinton raped her? 18. Is she still okay that Bill goes to pedophile island with Jeff Epstein? 19. Why are there so many murdered and suicided people in the Clinton's immediate circle? 20. Doesn't the fact that the Clinton Foundation has to amend 5 years of its tax returns for improper reporting imply that you were involved in an illegal RICO enterprise? 21. Doesn't approving the Russian-owned Uranium One deal as secretary of state--because of illegal contributions to your foundation--in fact make you a traitor to this country? 22. Was it wise to have at least four Clinton Foundation board of directors that have either been convicted or charged of the financial crimes of bribery and fraud? 23. Why, Hillary, did you pay your female senate staffers 72% of what you paid your male staffers? 24. When you represented an accused pedophile rapist, why did you laugh when you got him off even though you believed him to be guilty? 25. She said she had one e-mail address, it came out that she had two; She said she had one device, it came out that she had two: She said none of her e-mails on her private server was classified, but when the State Dept handed over 300 e-mails the FBI redacted large sections of one, proving again she was wrong. Thus, Ms. Clinton, are you incompetent or just a congenital liar? Everyone should go on you tube and watch The Clinton Chronicles -- it will amaze you what a couple of psychopaths the Clintons really are!
15 | Luke French | 0 | 1339233209506261_1339383872824528 | Claiming that Trump is a fascist, while proposing fascist subjugation of people with dissenting opinions😂Could you be any more hypocritical and ignorant?!? Haha
16 | Pete McGuire | 0 | 1339233209506261_1339446436151605 | Do you hear it ?? Listen come here closer .. trump trump trump trump Trump Trump it's like the heartbeat of American . Now get even closer . . Here that ? It's the locking of door outside Hillarys jail cell not so nice huh .. sorry
17 | Rhonda Sheptock | 10 | 1339233209506261_1339241689505413 | Meanwhile Trump is actually going to court for Child Rape and his Fraudulent University that stole millions from hard working Americans, shipping his work off the other countries while touting he wants to make America great, sexually assaulting women for decades, building his businesses with a Chinese steel, hiring US Contractors to architect and build his hotels and then not paying them, bankrupting his businesses and putting people out of work and not providing healthcare benefits for the ones he does have working. And this is all on top of him being a racist, misogynist, hate breeding, war monger who disrespects our veterans and war heroes and makes fun of disabled people! And we can also add that he not only lost 500million on a single year beating the great business man that he is, but found a loophole to then not pay any personal federal income tax for the last 20 years. So he isn't contributing to our schools, fire/police departments, servicemen, veterans, or any other departments that he states he cares so much about!
18 | Karen Mcclure | 3 | 1339233209506261_1339241296172119 | Hillary wont even speak to the press that is on her plane, she is hiding in the back. She knows they know how corrupt she is, how she cheated Bernie out of the nomination, how she sold out this country. Even Jill Stein prefers Trump over Hillary.
19 | Marie Callahan | 1 | 1339233209506261_1339430792819836 | Sick of hearing about Clinton's emails after Trump, Bush, Rice, and Powell got a pass. Fed up with nasty man Donald Trump. Considering Comey sending his confusing letter of innuendo to Congress, perhaps Trump is right about the election being rigged--in favor of Trump, of course.
20 | Nina Rene Starrin | 0 | 1339233209506261_1339637996132449 | Is this also showing the massive voter fraud in favor of democrats ?? There's so much voter fraud in nearly every state. Shows the demoralizing state we've become . Cheating Lowlifes !
21 | Gene Gutierrez | 2 | 1339233209506261_1339356326160616 | I already voted for Hillary Clinton.  Now it's up to you.  Vote to save us from a racist lying conman demagogue sociopath lunatic like Trump. Vote blue all the way down the ballot! Hillary Clinton is the only real choice for President of the United States!
22 | Gordon Wright | 0 | 1339233209506261_1339630762799839 | According to an NYPD source, emails found on Anthony Weiner’s laptop detail trips made by Weiner, Bill and Hillary Clinton on convicted pedophile pal billionaire Jeffrey Epstein’s plane ‘Lolitta express‘ to a place known as “Sex Slave Island“.
23 | Barry Lanehart | 1 | 1339233209506261_1339237226172526 | Found this on Facebook, not my words but like thousands of Members we all agree 100% - America doesn't need Hillary...Seriously she will violate our Constitutional Rights. GOA & NRA both said that Hillary said she wants to take all guns away. Fact link below proves it. America doesn't need a Progressive Socialist dictator violating our Constitutional Rights. She can shove Gun Control up her.....☆ It's a Constitutional Right that every honest American Citizen has to defend themselves against all enemies domestic or foreign. ☆ Also the US Supreme Court already ruled that no one no lower governing authorities can deny ownership!!!Welcome to the new Democratic Republic of Progressive Socialist...☆ She just wants to violate more Constitutional Laws & Rights. There is already enough of Unconstitutional Executive Orders, we don't need anymore...Beside all throughout history there's been many Dictators/Tyrants who took their Peoples g.u.n.s away just before they did horrific acts to their people. http://worldofguns.info/2016/10/26/u-n-says-they-will-soon-occupy-america-under-hillary-going-door-to-door-taking-guns/
24 | Jen Spry | 0 | 1339233209506261_1339706096125639 | You realize Hillary is under FBI investigation. Also several people in her core group are under FBI investigations for different crimes.Now Weiner's computer shows that Bill Clinton went to the human trafficking island/mansion on a monthly basis. Oh and her money-laundering foundation is under FBI investigation too.  Come on People- this isn't because of Trump....This is because of crime!!!!
25 | Belinda Tanner | 4 | 1339233209506261_1339246839504898 | A gentleman named Bill Howell eloquently wrote the below letter.Dear Mr. Trump,It’s taken me a while to realize this and to admit it, but I’m grateful to you.For the past few months I’ve spent a good deal of time lamenting your campaign and the poison it has so effortlessly generated. I’ve watched our country imploding, our public discourse become polluted, our political climate grows ever more corrosive, and wrongly assumed you were to blame.It’s only lately I’ve come to understand that you haven’t manufactured our current national ugliness—you’ve simply revealed it.By saying the irresponsible, mean-spirited, ignorant things you say so freely and so frequently, you’ve given other like-minded people license to do the same. You’ve opened up the floodgates for our corporate sewage to flow fully. People no longer conceal their vile mess, they now revel in it, they broadcast it and retweet it.You’ve made bigotry and racism socially acceptable again and that has been a kind of twisted gift because it’s allowed me to really see people; not as they pretend to be on the surface—but in the very depths of their wounded, weaponized hearts.Over and over as your campaign has persisted, your supporters would tell me that they like you because you “speak your mind”. It wasn’t until recently that I’ve realized that you speak their minds. You’ve given credence to their prejudices and made those prejudices go mainstream.Thanks to the terrible ground you’ve broken, politicians, pastors, friends, and strangers, both in person and on social media now regularly out themselves as hateful, intolerant, and malicious—and they remind me just how close they are to me, just how deep the sickness in us runs, and just how far we have to go together.You’ve emboldened people to be open about things they used to conceal for the sake of decorum, and though it turns my stomach, I know that this is the only way we can move forward; to have that cancerous stuff exposed fully so that it can be dealt with. Our progress as a nation is predicated on authentic dialogue, no matter how brutal and disheartening that dialogue is.In other words, you’ve let us know what we’re really dealing with here and while it’s been rightly disturbing, it’s also been revelatory. That’s the thing about that kind of harsh light: you’re forced to see everything. Beauty and monstrosity equally illuminated.Now don’t get me wrong, I think you’re the least qualified, least knowledgeable Presidential candidate we may ever have had participate this far into the process, and if you somehow were elected I’d fear gravely for the world my children would inherit—should it survive your Presidency at all. I believe you’re reckless, bitter, and completely reprehensible; the very worst kind of bully.But whether you win or lose, you’ve already allowed me the blessing of Truth; about me, about you, about other candidates, about our nation.And in the process you’ve also shown me that I am not alone in resisting you and this ugly thing you’ve revealed about us.You’ve generated an equally loud, equally passionate response to it and this is where I find my hope these days.I find it in those for whom equality isn’t just a cheap buzzword, it’s the most precious of hills to die on.I find it in those people who refuse to be silent in the face of our impending shared regression.I find it in those willing to be bolder in defending the inherent value of all people.I find it in the growing army of those who will not tolerate hatred as a core American value.I find it in those who reject violence as our default response to dissension.I find it in the ever rising voice of people who will not let malice and bitterness represent them in the world.Today I find my hope in those who, like me, will not be complicit in allowing bigotry and intolerance to become a source of national pride, because we’ve seen where that leads.Yes, Mr Trump, you’ve unearthed our hidden sickness and you’ve allowed it to go viral.You brought every awful thing about us out into the open.You will NEVER Get My Vote!#VoteBlue #NeverTrump

1 | Eric Crum | 112 | 10154760765033689_10154760825128689 | I don't see Trump winning. There is no evidence Wisconsin or North Carolina will even tip towards Trump. That's all she has to win in this case. Florida is close, but it always is, but so is Georgia, which is not good for Trump.The only way Florida will tip towards Trump is if there is cheating involved. There would have to be voter suppression efforts in place for Trump to win Florida (which there partially is). Floridians do not like their governor, who is a huge supporter of Trump. He's the most unpopular governor in the nation also.The math is just easier for Clinton.
2 | Pollie Thomas | 91 | 10154760765033689_10154760822288689 | He is not going to win ,we haven't came out yet,and coming out in million we just been quite watch nov8, she going to win , watching Trump supporter make fools of themselves
3 | John Burlingame | 30 | 10154760765033689_10154760816278689 | Rosie O'Donnell needs to do an opening on one of Hillary Clinton's talks. That will open up Trump for sure and get things moving back in the right direction.
4 | Cheryl Hall | 60 | 10154760765033689_10154760810073689 | She and minions think they are above the law. The public is just sick of the lies, tricks, cheating, self enriching, power abusing, Hillary Clinton. ENOUGH!!!
5 | Dan Thompson | 30 | 10154760765033689_10154760887008689 | Remember Trump voters don't fall for that left-wing conspiracy of the media telling you the election is next Tuesday. Remember Donald Trump told you and it is true that it is November 28. Don't be fooled vote November 28 if you're voting for Trump.
6 | Warren Murray | 27 | 10154760765033689_10154760815473689 | While there has been some life changing emails revealed in these illegally hacked private email accounts, it is evident that someone is only interested in revealing one side of a two sided political parties conversations. Any wise and just person knows that there are at least two sides to every story, so until I see what both sides are saying, these emails mean nothing to me. None of the emails show any intent of Hillary trying to illegally harm our country or any person, but we don't know what the gop and trump is saying or doing. Lets see both sides so we can make equal and fair decisions on who we want to vote for. You can only fool a fool, more than once and I'm nobody's fool. Whose fool are you ?
7 | Skep Masalela | 30 | 10154760765033689_10154760808498689 | Trump is going to win by a landslide, whether you want to admit it or not.
8 | Connie Greene | 2 | 10154760765033689_10154761482458689 | Just stay plugged in to MSNBC because there was two polls on Lawrence O'Donnell's show that crashed this opinion. An economics poll that does not follow electoral votes and a Florida poll that measures daily votes that revealed 28% of Republicans that voted already crossed over to Hillary Clinton and voted Republican down ballot.
9 | John Steinbach | 11 | 10154760765033689_10154760887133689 | I don't buy his analysis that it's hurting Hillary, she will still win by a landslide!  #BlueWave2016 will be arriving soon!!!
10 | Je Deg | 4 | 10154760765033689_10154761692253689 | The GOP is DEAD ! After this election when Hillary wins ! The deplorables have nowhere else to go ! I mean seriously nowhere !
11 | Timothy Reents | 3 | 10154760765033689_10154760901313689 | The bar is so low for the cry baby loser trump who chases story's of weiners, not winners.Untrustworthy Trump. Using fake polls, fake newspapers, fake news stories, trolls from all over the world to sell your propaganda... all the while Putin is building a new, much larger, KGB force....  Well seems really really UNTRUSTWORTHY TRUMP!The number of trump campaign staff that have active criminal investigations is growing fast! Thank you trump for being the law and order guy making it so easy to bring these "fringe individuals and groups" , both foreign and domestic,  out of the darkness and into the light of law enforcement.  I however would not support an amnesty deal for you in the process.
12 | Steven D. Weber | 4 | 10154760765033689_10154760869463689 | That moment when your Hillary supporter friend, finally realizes EVERYTHING!  The emails, the WikiLeaks, Huma's gone, the Weiner's been exposed, Donna Brazile ousted, EVERYTHING is true!  & just has to give up,... they go and take a shower for 3 days. But never admit that they figured it out, they don't know how to tell you.
13 | Jim Williams | 12 | 10154760765033689_10154760846898689 | Breaking News!!!: "FBI discovers shocking revelations in Hillary's e-mails. Her e-mails reveal that Clinton cheated on three spouses and pleaded the fifth 97 times to avoid admitting she committed adultery, molested fourteen men, ripped off hundreds of workers and contractors and investors, defrauded hundreds of students, mocked a handicapped reporter, lost a billion on a casino in 1995 when the economy was booming, has actually never released any of her tax returns so we can know who she owes money to, is going to court for fraud and raping a 13 year old boy, and used the money from her foundation to line her own pockets and bribe two attorneys general, and she has a former Putin assistant as co-chair of her campaign, is receiving millions of dark money from Russian oligarchs, Russians hacking into RNC and Trump campaign e-mails," I'm sticking with Hillary.
14 | Jackson DeStefano | 1 | 10154760765033689_10154761482968689 | You're simply wrong about what states are tossups. Right now, it's Nevada, Arizona, Iowa, Ohio, Florida, and North Carolina, but even without those states, Clinton is already over 270 thanks to her firm holds on Pennsylvania and Michigan. She may be the first president since Kennedy to lose Ohio but still win the Presidency. But, there's little use in speculating. It's best just to see what happens on election day.

17 | Margie Hammer Harmon | 3 | 10154760765033689_10154760832733689 | A vote for Hillary is a vote for four years of corruption, investigation, and gridlock. It will be impossible for her to achieve anything, should she be elected, with her time and energy focused on legal survival.
18 | Janet D Bryant | 2 | 10154760765033689_10154760917518689 | Polling science is dependent on the sampling. These old models of sampling have not been adjusted to reflect the changing demographics. Hispanics are an increasing percentage of the electorate; each cycle their numbers increase. Asians are also an increasing demographic that is TOTALLY overlooked. Even we African Americans have increased. Until the models for polling are adjusted to reflect the much more diverse electorate, these polls are not really reliable.Think about it this way: in 2012, the polls had President Obama up by .06%. Yet, he won going away by 4%, a blowout.

21 | Jn Searle | 2 | 10154760765033689_10154760918243689 | I asked a young Lady at a game, how she could vote for Trump, a “misogynist, a racist and a bigot”.Here is her answer:Because I use my head to research and find out what candidates really are, not what the media wants me to think. Because Donald Trump has more women in executive and managerial positions than any comparable company, which tells me he is not a misogynist. Because he pays these women the same or more than their male counterparts, which tells me looks for capacity and skills in people, not color, gender or race. Because he fought the West Palm Beach City Council to be able to open his newly purchased club, so he could include blacks and Jews as members, who had been banned until then. This tells me he is not a racist. Because he has raised wonderful children who have turned out to be outstanding, hard-working and compassionate adults. He must be doing something right. Because his economic plans makes sense, are conservative in nature, and I vote based of what is best for my family, my friends and my country. Because everybody, the left and the right are afraid of him, the media is trying to destroy his image, and even foreign governments are voicing their opinions, so he must be doing something right. Clean house maybe? Because I want a Supreme Court that will uphold the Constitution, not behave as minions of the administration. I have had enough with judges who are more like political activists than law enforcers. Because I fear for my family’s safety if the current trend of not confronting blatant terrorism continues – which is a threat to our way of life. Because I am fed up with the rampant corruption of this administration. Accountability in government is paramount, and as this administration has demonstrated, it is a foreign concept to them. Because I am fed up with the political correctness gone wild, and because Trump is not afraid to say what everybody thinks but does not dare to say. A thug is a thug, regardless of color, and that's it. Because it is about time someone puts America's interests ahead of other countries. Because I know he recognizes and embraces America's exceptionalism, and will not tour the World apologizing for who we are. That tells me he is a patriot. Because, unlike HRC, he has actually held a job, worked hard and achieved success. And last, but not least, because I am more offended by what Hillary does than by what Trump says.

23 | Tammy Shelton Eskola | 0 | 10154760765033689_10154760886973689 | People voting for Hillary need to consider that since she was doing government business as Secretary of State on her unsecure server that China and Russia and anyone else who probabky broke into it, WILL blackmail her if she becomes President. She chose to handle "we the people's" emails in this way...which makes her incompetent to be President. Being Secretary of State is a big deal for national security and she put people at risk. I don't care how much "free stuff" she promises me...I care more about this great country and it's future.

Rachel Maddow reports on a new set of stories about the FBI investigating aspects of the Donald J. Trump campaign and ties to Russia, and FBI director James Comey's reported reluctance to reveal Russia's role in hacking for fear of influencing the election.

What They Found Will RUIN HER LIFEELECTION USA NEWS - November 1, 20160 Share Tweet Share ShareYou’ve probably heard by now that NYPD obtained Anthony Weiner and Huma Abedin’s home devices as part of an investigation into Weiner’s alleged “sexting” with underage girls… But the cops didn’t stop with them!To their complete shock, the NYPD ended up finding and raiding HILLARY’S property on those devices in the form of 650k emails connected to her personal email server…Now her private property is in the hands of the NYPD and FBI!An NYPD source just claimed that within the emails on that device, Hillary and Bill are directly implicated ins a MASSIVE child sex/trafficking ring along with their friend, and convicted pedophile, Jeffrey Epstein. (See Below)According to the source,“…It’s much more vile and serious than classified material on Weiner’s device. The emails DETAIL the trips made by Weiner, Bill and Hillary on their pedophile billionaire friend’s plane, the Lolita Express.”“We’re talking an international child enslavement and sex ring“These claims were backed up by other NYPD sources as well:

11 | Earl Franklin Clemons Jr | 9 | 1339161862846729_1339165886179660 | The 1980s are again calling to ask for their foreign policy back. But this time the roles are reversed. We're now the guys with the closed, secretive, paranoid elite desperate to prevent the truth getting out to the wider world. In the Soviet Union, the apparatchiks of the one-party state warned you not to listen to the BBC on short-wave under the bed covers at night. In America, CNN's Chris Cuomo warns you that it's "illegal" for you to read those Wikileaks emails. So just leave it to credentialed media wallahs like him to let you know if there's anything in them of any interest. Which, judging from the networks' coverage, there isn't.So, as Chris Cuomo sees it, the same FBI whose officials were leaned on not to investigate Hillary for illegally keeping classified emails on a server housed in some guy's toilet in Colorado should instead investigate you for reading emails about her illegal emails. This is what a supposedly free press has been reduced to in order to drag Hillary across the finish line.

13 | Shawn Walker | 7 | 1339161862846729_1339172652845650 | The FBI has clearly chosen a side in the presidential race, and they are using their power and influence to tip the scale!, You see they're not releasing anything about Donald Trump, and this is right after President Obama said James Cromey is not leaning one way or the other!, That's what I've been saying about Obama, he sees something right in front of him and too weak to point it out !!.. Welcome to being targeted by the law Hillary Clinton says all minorities in the US
14 | Earl Franklin Clemons Jr | 6 | 1339161862846729_1339166149512967 | It is still somewhat jaw-dropping (and not in the Monica sense) that the campaign to return the Clintons to the White House is now running on how terribly the other guy treats women. Introducing Hillary in New Hampshire today, Michelle Obama gave a speech on Trump as a sexual predator and then hailed Hillary as someone who's had "more exposure to the presidency" than any other candidate. Be that as it may, she had rather less exposure from the President than innumerable other women during the Clinton years. Paula Jones got considerably more, and without asking for it. But Mrs Clinton stands there and demands "dignity for women" - and nobody laughs.
15 | Serrell Law | 5 | 1339161862846729_1339187339510848 | Already knew this. It's not rocket science. Plus, nobody is talking about Trumps child rape case that's going to court December 16, 2016 and his other cases that are going forward after the election.

They are a independent publishing website all they do is spred emails he's Swedish hiding out in London not Russian . You watch 7 days left more bombshells on her next one will end her campaign.
21 | Kenneth Brown | 1 | 1339161862846729_1571584566192468 | Republican nominee and lawsuit magnet Donald Trump has found himself the target of yet another accusation of fraud and financial misconduct – this time in another country. A Mexican official has filed a criminal tax complaint against Trump in Tijuana, Mexico, over yet another failed business venture – the Trump Ocean Resort, which collapsed before it even began construction.But before the housing market and the rest of the global economy collapsed with the onset of the Bush Recession, Trump and his partners sold $32.5 million in future properties to unwitting customers since 2006 and leaving their investors in the lurch.In addition, Donald Trump is accused of dodging an additional $32.5 million in taxes – surprise! – but has countered that he wasn’t actually involved, but that he was just “leasing” his name on the project. The investors, however, counter that Trump’s face was on the brochure and quoted him as saying it would be “the most spectacular place in all of Mexico.”Though Trump worked out the deal with Los Angeles-based developer Irongate Wilshire and Mexican company P.B. Impulsores, the lawsuit singles out Trump by name, calling him out “against the Mexican state because beyond defrauding investors he also committed fraud by not paying taxes in Mexico for the mercantile operations he took part in.”It should come as no surprise, since Donald Trump has dodged paying American income taxes for decades and defrauded his investors his entire life. Far from being a “successful” businessman, Trump has proven time and time again he is incapable of following through with the most basic of financial transactions – the exchange of money for rendered goods and services.
22 | Frank Correia | 0 | 1339161862846729_1571287459555512 | funny, everything on Trump has been made up. Why do you think it goes away.  CNN would never let it go if it was the truth. Hillary on the other hand has lied about everything.  With the new emails, all the Dems will be in line with the fbi trying to make deals turning her in.
23 | Janice Navarijo | 1 | 1339161862846729_1339264832836432 | Why don't you investigate how much was paid by Trump and his people to get the FBI Director to go after the Clinton e-mails again?  Or maybe there were threats of some kind.  The whole action needs to be investigated.
24 | David Peterson | 0 | 1339161862846729_1339218519507730 | the only ties to russia is hillary giving them 20% of our nuke power that makes nukes in some dumb deal she made.i would say thats why bill clinton got big bucks for a speech he made in russia.a couple in the late 40's are early 50's was hanged for less.

MSNBC won't report the truth...Wikileaks has a 10 year and 100% track record on their leaks being accurate and TRUE, and  the other thing is there hasn't been a Russian near this election other than  to watch in amusement as  the Left self destructs trying to shield probably one of the largest Crime organizations since the Gambino's that's if the Gambino's could've started a Nuclear war to hise their criminality......Either MSNBC starts giving the wikileaks emails the time and consideration they deserve or they will be joining Donna Brazile in the recently unemployed line......ASK CNN if they believe the wikileaks were accurate...they havent refuted any of them and they Fired Donna because of it....NUFF SAID.

6 | Fontaine Moore | 4 | 1339132196183029_1339233629506219 | It is amazing how thoroughly dishonest Republicans and conservative can be, while accusing Democrats of the very thing they they, themselves, are guilty of. For example, most "voter fraud," including attempts to repress the vote, are almost always the handiwork of Republicans. And yet they invariably blame it on Democrats and use that as an excuse to pass more voter repression legislation!

The people need intellectual honest reporting instead of a partisan agenda shoved in their face. The poisonous perspective propagated on this channel, tragically, creates a false view of the world and culture that stokes division and anger. Sure racism exists. However everything is not racism.

23 | Gerald Ott | 4 | 1339132196183029_1339136882849227 | THE NATION: Perhaps one reason Trump has been able to get away with being so absurdly vague, vulgar, and uninformed is that he has positioned himself squarely as a culture warrior, not as a politician. The culture wars aren’t about the specifics of foreign policy or climate change or budget concerns. They are waged as performative skirmishes—symbolic, visual, and visceral. In one corner are the send-ups of campus eggheads supposedly surrendering Western civilization to the people who “don’t belong”: bleeding women with “fat faces,” unruly affirmative-action minorities, LGBTQ victimologists, job-stealing Asians, and a mushily defined remainder of soft equivocators and kale-eating “liberals.” In the other corner are the tough guys, the red-meat-eaters, real men who live in a “real world” of no rules but ruthlessness: plain-speaking, strong-jawed, put-up-or-shut-up cowboy entrepreneurs, unafraid to get their hands a little dirty in the service of building beautiful walls around the beautiful empire, the beautiful castle, and their bevy of beautiful ladies in skintight dresses. https://www.thenation.com/article/trump-doesnt-want-to-lead-the-country-he-wants-to-lead-a-culture-war/

Makes thousands of emails disappear overnight - is always leading in the polls by double digits with only 50 people at her rally (most of whom were paid to be there and bussed in). From a mere investment of $5000 made $250,000 in beef futures - Hillary is actually a magician

Top economists have said his economic plan will triple our debt. There is so much hatred (even though these are supposed to be Christians who are forgiving) that they can not see what he will do to our country. He has already increased hatred and racism among people.

This cost-benefit analysis primarily focuses on the idea that we all have the choice to proceed with our actions. Because of the punishment involved, we are deterred from committing the crime.Hillary Clinton can't deterred -she is a criminal
15 | Margaret Steinhoff | 0 | 1339047216191527_1339817139447868 | This is also how I feel. It's almost over for me.  Dear Mr. Trump, It’s taken me a while to realize this and to admit it, but I’m grateful to you. For the past few months I’ve spent a good deal of time lamenting your campaign and the poison it has so effortlessly generated. I’ve watched our country imploding, our public discourse become polluted, our political climate grows ever more corrosive, and wrongly assumed you were to blame. It’s only lately I’ve come to understand that you haven’t manufactured our current national ugliness—you’ve simply revealed it. By saying the irresponsible, mean-spirited, ignorant things you say so freely and so frequently, you’ve given other like-minded people license to do the same. You’ve opened up the floodgates for our corporate sewage to flow fully. People no longer conceal their vile mess, they now revel in it, they broadcast it and retweet it. You’ve made bigotry and racism socially acceptable again and that has been a kind of twisted gift because it’s allowed me to really see people; not as they pretend to be on the surface—but in the very depths of their wounded, weaponized hearts. Over and over as your campaign has persisted, your supporters would tell me that they like you because you “speak your mind”. It wasn’t until recently that I’ve realized that you speak their minds. You’ve given credence to their prejudices and made those prejudices go mainstream. Thanks to the terrible ground you’ve broken, politicians, pastors, friends, and strangers, both in person and on social media now regularly out themselves as hateful, intolerant, and malicious—and they remind me just how close they are to me, just how deep the sickness in us runs, and just how far we have to go together. You’ve emboldened people to be open about things they used to conceal for the sake of decorum, and though it turns my stomach, I know that this is the only way we can move forward; to have that cancerous stuff exposed fully so that it can be dealt with. Our progress as a nation is predicated on authentic dialogue, no matter how brutal and disheartening that dialogue is. In other words, you’ve let us know what we’re really dealing with here and while it’s been rightly disturbing, it’s also been revelatory. That’s the thing about that kind of harsh light: you’re forced to see everything. Beauty and monstrosity equally illuminated. Now don’t get me wrong, I think you’re the least qualified, least knowledgeable Presidential candidate we may ever have had participate this far into the process, and if you somehow were elected I’d fear gravely for the world my children would inherit—should it survive your Presidency at all. I believe you’re reckless, bitter, and completely reprehensible; the very worst kind of bully. But whether you win or lose, you’ve already allowed me the blessing of Truth; about me, about you, about other candidates, about our nation. And in the process you’ve also shown me that I am not alone in resisting you and this ugly thing you’ve revealed about us. You’ve generated an equally loud, equally passionate response to it and this is where I find my hope these days. I find it in those for whom equality isn’t just a cheap buzzword, it’s the most precious of hills to die on. I find it in those people who refuse to be silent in the face of our impending shared regression. I find it in those willing to be bolder in defending the inherent value of all people. I find it in the growing army of those who will not tolerate hatred as a core American value. I find it in those who reject violence as our default response to dissension. I find it in the ever rising voice of people who will not let malice and bitterness represent them in the world. Today I find my hope in those who, like me, will not be complicit in allowing bigotry and intolerance to become a source of national pride, because we’ve seen where that leads. Yes, Mr Trump, you’ve unearthed our hidden sickness and you’ve allowed it to go viral. You brought every awful thing about us out into the open. You will NEVER Get My Vote!
16 | Jude Birch | 0 | 1339047216191527_1339084332854482 | Chuck Todd suggests we may face hopeless gridlock if Hillary wins and the senate stays the same. I wish he would focus on first winning the senate with Hillary's Presidency and then REMEMBER Mitch McConnell declared the obstinate obstructionist view following Obama's win. He literally gave us Trump, so we should demand that obstruction be acknowledged and then shoved aside after Tuesday, never forgetting where it began. It wasn't just this election cycle, nor it's ugly path. McConnell was a very bad loser, yet remains squarely in his red state seat in Kentucky.
17 | Katharina Finger | 0 | 1339047216191527_1339162296180019 | If the media wouldn't give Trump such a big platform, it would have never come this far! Also Clinton's emails could only come that far because nobody picks one of the hundreds lies and law violations and drags it on for months! Why are emails worse than insulting, sexually harassing women, than tax fraud, than giving a crap about poor people, than encouraging racism in a country almost entirely build by immigrants. This presidential candidacy shows a clear lack of the education system in the states and the abuse of power by media.

That is not journalism.
19 | Jn Searle | 1 | 1339047216191527_1339237306172518 | I asked a young Lady at a game, how she could vote for Trump, a “misogynist, a racist and a bigot”.Here is her answer:Because I use my head to research and find out what candidates really are, not what the media wants me to think. Because Donald Trump has more women in executive and managerial positions than any comparable company, which tells me he is not a misogynist. Because he pays these women the same or more than their male counterparts, which tells me looks for capacity and skills in people, not color, gender or race. Because he fought the West Palm Beach City Council to be able to open his newly purchased club, so he could include blacks and Jews as members, who had been banned until then. This tells me he is not a racist. Because he has raised wonderful children who have turned out to be outstanding, hard-working and compassionate adults. He must be doing something right. Because his economic plans makes sense, are conservative in nature, and I vote based of what is best for my family, my friends and my country. Because everybody, the left and the right are afraid of him, the media is trying to destroy his image, and even foreign governments are voicing their opinions, so he must be doing something right. Clean house maybe? Because I want a Supreme Court that will uphold the Constitution, not behave as minions of the administration. I have had enough with judges who are more like political activists than law enforcers. Because I fear for my family’s safety if the current trend of not confronting blatant terrorism continues – which is a threat to our way of life. Because I am fed up with the rampant corruption of this administration. Accountability in government is paramount, and as this administration has demonstrated, it is a foreign concept to them. Because I am fed up with the political correctness gone wild, and because Trump is not afraid to say what everybody thinks but does not dare to say. A thug is a thug, regardless of color, and that's it. Because it is about time someone puts America's interests ahead of other countries. Because I know he recognizes and embraces America's exceptionalism, and will not tour the World apologizing for who we are. That tells me he is a patriot. Because, unlike HRC, he has actually held a job, worked hard and achieved success. And last, but not least, because I am more offended by what Hillary does than by what Trump says.

21 | Linda Smith | 2 | 1339047216191527_1339131706183078 | In today’s New York Times, former Central Intelligence Agency director Mike Morell initiated a firestorm by strongly endorsing Hillary Clinton for president. His memorable op-ed didn’t simply back the Democrat, her own grave security lapses notwithstanding. Morell went further, tearing down her Republican opponent as “not only unqualified for the job, but he may well pose a threat to our national security… he would be a poor, even dangerous, commander in chief.”Normally that would be sufficiently lethal coming from a former CIA director, but Morell kept going, castigating Donald Trump as a pawn of the Kremlin possessing overtly pro-Russian views. He minced no words: “In the intelligence business, we would say that Putin had recruited Trump as an unwitting agent of the Russian Federation.”http://observer.com/2016/08/yes-american-spies-really-think-trump-is-putins-guy/

What matters is that Hillary Clinton illegally, knowingly and intentionally used an unsecure server and exposed our national secrets to the world for hacking. When she was caught she also illegally, knowingly and intentionally deleted e-mails, destroyed e-mailing devices, and lied lied lied about having done any of it. Someone please tell me how that is not criminal activity that should be handled with an arrest. And have that be an arrest without bail due to the absolute seriousness of the crimes. And when someone commits a crime the wheels of justice do not come to a stop because that person just happens to be in a race for the presidency. In fact, if they are in a race for the presidency that arrest needs to be made as expeditiously as humanly possible. Whomever the people are in the corrupt circle of people holding off an arrest should be arrested with her!!!

Donnie doesn't need to start TrumpTV--he already has it.
