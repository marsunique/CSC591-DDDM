The most divisive and unpredictable presidential race in modern memory reached its end Tuesday.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Kingsley Wilson Smith | 3 | 10154814524159729_10154814540984729 | ‚Ä¢ Reach out to all the Clinton supporters you know and urge them to vote
2 | Joffery Stone | 1 | 10154814524159729_10154814617084729 | "How quickly we forget! If you‚Äôre over 35, take a walk with me down memory lane‚Äîyou won‚Äôt believe what you have forgotten. If you‚Äôre under 35, read on‚ÄîI promise you that you will be amazed at what you missed! (By the way, sadly, this isn‚Äôt a joke. I wish it was.)REMEMBER WHEN BILL CLINTON WAS PRESIDENT?(January 20, 1993 to January 20, 2001‚Äîtwo terms)When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over an attempt to reform health care. Her proposed plan was so bad that many Democrats came up with competing plans of their own in protest, and in spite of threats and intimidation, on September 26, 1994, the ‚ÄúHillarycare‚Äù bill was declared dead.This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million for studies, promotion, and other efforts.Then, President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general. Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood‚Äîboth were forced to withdraw their names from consideration. Next, she chose Janet Reno, which husband Bill described as "my worst mistake." (Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.)Husband Bill also allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission‚ÄîLani Guanier was her selection. After considerable backlash from prominent Democratic senators concerning Ms. Guanier's radical views, Bill Clinton withdrew her name from nomination, stating that she did not represents the civil rights views that he had championed during his campaign.However, apparently a slow learner, husband Bill continued to allow Hillary to make more recommendations. She chose former law partners, Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department. Her selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kennedy was forced to resign. (Is anyone wondering yet what her Supreme Court Justice appointments would be like?)Many younger voters will have no knowledge of "Travelgate," the first major ethics controversy during Bill‚Äôs presidency.Hillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend, Harry Thompson‚Äîbut the White House Travel Office refused to comply. She trumped up allegations of financial mismanagement and reported seven long-time White House employees to the FBI. This ruined their reputations, got them fired, and caused a thirty-six month investigation. Eventually, most of the employees were reinstated and Clinton associates were forced out of the travel office. Only one White House employee, Billy Dale, was charged with a crime‚Äîthe enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds; a jury acquitted him in less than two hours.Still not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House Security. When Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies (Filegate) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff, suddenly Hillary and the President denied even knowing Livingstone, and of course, denied knowledge of drug use in the White House.Following this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents.Next, when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by Bill Clinton, Hillary was put in charge of the "bimbo eruption" and scandal defense. Let‚Äôs look at some of her more notable decisions in this regard . . . She urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation, they settled with Ms. Jones. She refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor. After $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr's investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs. Hillary's devious game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for 'lying under oath' to a grand jury, followed by his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives. Hillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, "I do not recall," "I have no recollection," and "I don't know" a total of 56 times while under oath. (Sound familiar?) After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had "mistakenly thought was hers."So you see, the email scandal and all of her malfeasance regarding the handling of Top Secret information, not to mention the "pay to play" schemes of the Clinton Foundation, are nothing new. Hillary‚Äôs entire political career has been nothing but a web of lies, corruption and destruction in her quest for power.Is anyone else ready to say, ‚ÄúEnough is enough!‚Äù?But unfortunately, I‚Äôm sure her loyal fans will say, "What difference does it make?"

Let‚Äôs look at some of her more notable decisions in this regard . . . She urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation, they settled with Ms. Jones. She refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor. After $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr's investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs. Hillary's devious game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for 'lying under oath' to a grand jury, followed by his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives. Hillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, "I do not recall," "I have no recollection," and "I don't know" a total of 56 times while under oath. (Sound familiar?) After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had "mistakenly thought was hers."So you see, the email scandal and all of her malfeasance regarding the handling of Top Secret information, not to mention the "pay to play" schemes of the Clinton Foundation, are nothing new. Hillary‚Äôs entire political career has been nothing but a web of lies, corruption and destruction in her quest for power.Is anyone else ready to say, ‚ÄúEnough is enough!‚Äù?But unfortunately, I‚Äôm sure her loyal fans will say, "What difference does it make?"

It‚Äôs one marker of the fact that for all Mrs. Clinton‚Äôs protestations of support for the Jewish State, it would be a fool‚Äôs wager to count on her when the chips are down.Hillary‚Äôs choice of Tim Kaine reveals her intentions as president to continue the Obama policy of promoting the Muslim Brotherhood and Iran and betraying Israel. The choice of Kaine also reveals Hillary‚Äôs reckless disregard for homeland security. She has chosen a man who is willing to cozy up to well-known terror-promoters here in America in exchange for cash.The media wants us to think Donald Trump is dangerous. This is the face of danger---Clinton-Kaine: importers of jihadi terror to America.

If you‚Äôre under 35, read on‚ÄîI promise you that you will be amazed at what you missed! (By the way, sadly, this isn‚Äôt a joke. I wish it was.)REMEMBER WHEN BILL CLINTON WAS PRESIDENT?(January 20, 1993 to January 20, 2001‚Äîtwo terms)When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over an attempt to reform health care. Her proposed plan was so bad that many Democrats came up with competing plans of their own in protest, and in spite of threats and intimidation, on September 26, 1994, the ‚ÄúHillarycare‚Äù bill was declared dead.This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million for studies, promotion, and other efforts.Then, President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general. Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood‚Äîboth were forced to withdraw their names from consideration. Next, she chose Janet Reno, which husband Bill described as "my worst mistake." (Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.)Husband Bill also allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission‚ÄîLani Guanier was her selection. After considerable backlash from prominent Democratic senators concerning Ms. Guanier's radical views, Bill Clinton withdrew her name from nomination, stating that she did not represents the civil rights views that he had championed during his campaign.However, apparently a slow learner, husband Bill continued to allow Hillary to make more recommendations. She chose former law partners, Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department. Her selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kennedy was forced to resign. (Is anyone wondering yet what her Supreme Court Justice appointments would be like?)Many younger voters will have no knowledge of "Travelgate," the first major ethics controversy during Bill‚Äôs presidency.Hillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend, Harry Thompson‚Äîbut the White House Travel Office refused to comply. She trumped up allegations of financial mismanagement and reported seven long-time White House employees to the FBI. This ruined their reputations, got them fired, and caused a thirty-six month investigation. Eventually, most of the employees were reinstated and Clinton associates were forced out of the travel office. Only one White House employee, Billy Dale, was charged with a crime‚Äîthe enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds; a jury acquitted him in less than two hours.Still not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House Security.

Troy | 0 | 10154812138169729_10154814362599729 | Anyone who is in industry or knows anything about the #EPA should take note that they have now changed their policy toward Boiler Mact rules after billions have already been spent complying to those regulations. A federal court recently deferred to the EPA to make those rules tighter and to cost manufacturers millions more individually without any effect on emissions. The point is to shut down as many power boilers and thus domestic manufacturers as possible. A Clinton win today is a win for huge international manufacturers at the expense of American jobs to destroy smaller domestic competition. That's what your Democratic party stands for today. #Hillary #Clinton does not represent domestic labor.

4 | Andrea Klein | 2 | 10154812138169729_10154814171199729 | Once and for all: a Hillary Clinton victory will not be a victory for women. It will be a victory for the Democrats, for liberal elites, for the multiple foreign governments who‚Äôve hacked her emails, for Wall Street bankers, for the media, for whoever stitches together her sci-fi pantsuits, for fans of spirit cooking, for her SNL impersonator; it will be a victory for all sorts of nefarious people,all sort of criminal activities, none more so than Hillary herself, but the average American woman will lose as much from her reign as we unevolved men. But more than anything or anyone else, a Hillary Clinton victory will be a victory for corruptionand crime. The most criminal and corrupt and distrusted nominee in the history of the country will have ascended all the way to the pinnacle of power.GO JILL!

More and more accusations were heaped onto Clinton. The Justice Department blocked a fair investigation into her use of a private server . Government officials used their power to shield Hillary from the consequences of her crimes.We‚Äôve been so horrified by the scandals and misdeeds of our next potential president, that we may have been ignoring those of the current one, President Obama.

2 | Jennifer Asbury-Kalenberg | 3 | 10154812160779729_10154814101719729 | RepostMichelle Obama said if Donald Trump is elected: "We're telling our sons it's okay to humiliate women. We're telling our daughters this is how they deserve to be treated.".... that's funny. So does that mean that if Hillary Clinton is elected, we are teaching our sons & daughters that it's ok to murder, lie, cover up, be corrupt, demean women, use racial slurs, and stay with a spouse that openly rapes women & cheats on you?

Sure .... he did lots of his business outside the US and had to lay off workers but hey sure he will bring jobs back ... and now let's imitate turkey, Russia and China and threaten journalists. What the heck is mainstream media? Media that's not under his control? What is non-mainstream media? Fox News? Guys please ... it's a no-brainer
5 | John Bunch | 0 | 10154812160779729_10154814388799729 | Trump: Nationalist protectionist narcissist blowhard. Clinton: the fake socialist who shills for Wall Street and the neo-con military-industrial complex. And the party whose policies have enriched the hedge fund class whIle robbing the working class.
6 | Antilusional | 1 | 10154812160779729_10154814574439729 | Donald has his businesses to run. He has no time to be president. In a recent interview by Katy Tur, Donald said that he was wasting his time that could have been used to earn millions. So right there, he exposes his own conflict of interest! Being president is about giving. Giving to the nation, to the people. Putting in an effort.Donald is only about himself. He would be constantly running his businesses on the side, and it might well end up taking the most of his time. And he most probably would use his presidency to influence things in his favor. Talking about corruption! America can't set itself up like this. It doesn't make any sense. Hillary has worked for other people her whole life. She really does care about the issues, no matter if you don't like her. She is the one that WILL go out of her way to do what she can - and she *IS* very capable!Right now, she is absolutely the correct fit. She absolutely makes sense.

10 | Andrea Klein | 3 | 10154812160779729_10154814129119729 | Once and for all: a Hillary Clinton victory will not be a victory for women. It will be a victory for the Democrats, for liberal elites, for the multiple foreign governments who‚Äôve hacked her emails, for Wall Street bankers, for the media, for whoever stitches together her sci-fi pantsuits, for fans of spirit cooking, for her SNL impersonator; it will be a victory for all sorts of nefarious people,all sort of criminal activities, none more so than Hillary herself, but the average American woman will lose as much from her reign as we unevolved men. But more than anything or anyone else, a Hillary Clinton victory will be a victory for corruptionand crime. The most criminal and corrupt and distrusted nominee in the history of the country will have ascended all the way to the pinnacle of power.
11 | Joffery Stone | 0 | 10154812160779729_10154814619084729 | "How quickly we forget! If you‚Äôre over 35, take a walk with me down memory lane‚Äîyou won‚Äôt believe what you have forgotten. If you‚Äôre under 35, read on‚ÄîI promise you that you will be amazed at what you missed! (By the way, sadly, this isn‚Äôt a joke. I wish it was.)REMEMBER WHEN BILL CLINTON WAS PRESIDENT?(January 20, 1993 to January 20, 2001‚Äîtwo terms)When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over an attempt to reform health care. Her proposed plan was so bad that many Democrats came up with competing plans of their own in protest, and in spite of threats and intimidation, on September 26, 1994, the ‚ÄúHillarycare‚Äù bill was declared dead.This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million for studies, promotion, and other efforts.Then, President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general. Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood‚Äîboth were forced to withdraw their names from consideration. Next, she chose Janet Reno, which husband Bill described as "my worst mistake." (Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.)Husband Bill also allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission‚ÄîLani Guanier was her selection. After considerable backlash from prominent Democratic senators concerning Ms. Guanier's radical views, Bill Clinton withdrew her name from nomination, stating that she did not represents the civil rights views that he had championed during his campaign.However, apparently a slow learner, husband Bill continued to allow Hillary to make more recommendations. She chose former law partners, Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department. Her selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kennedy was forced to resign. (Is anyone wondering yet what her Supreme Court Justice appointments would be like?)Many younger voters will have no knowledge of "Travelgate," the first major ethics controversy during Bill‚Äôs presidency.Hillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend, Harry Thompson‚Äîbut the White House Travel Office refused to comply. She trumped up allegations of financial mismanagement and reported seven long-time White House employees to the FBI. This ruined their reputations, got them fired, and caused a thirty-six month investigation. Eventually, most of the employees were reinstated and Clinton associates were forced out of the travel office. Only one White House employee, Billy Dale, was charged with a crime‚Äîthe enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds; a jury acquitted him in less than two hours.Still not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House Security. When Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies (Filegate) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff, suddenly Hillary and the President denied even knowing Livingstone, and of course, denied knowledge of drug use in the White House.Following this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents.Next, when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by Bill Clinton, Hillary was put in charge of the "bimbo eruption" and scandal defense. Let‚Äôs look at some of her more notable decisions in this regard . . . She urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation, they settled with Ms. Jones. She refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor. After $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr's investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs. Hillary's devious game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for 'lying under oath' to a grand jury, followed by his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives. Hillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, "I do not recall," "I have no recollection," and "I don't know" a total of 56 times while under oath. (Sound familiar?) After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had "mistakenly thought was hers."So you see, the email scandal and all of her malfeasance regarding the handling of Top Secret information, not to mention the "pay to play" schemes of the Clinton Foundation, are nothing new. Hillary‚Äôs entire political career has been nothing but a web of lies, corruption and destruction in her quest for power.Is anyone else ready to say, ‚ÄúEnough is enough!‚Äù?But unfortunately, I‚Äôm sure her loyal fans will say, "What difference does it make?"

The poll asked about a hypothetical matchup between Romney and Hillary Clinton, and Romney led by 10 points.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Brendan McTear | 44 | 10154812215749729_10154813338779729 | Match ups between an actual candidate in the race and someone who is not in the race are always one sided because the public tends to have amnesia.  Remind them of who Romney is and they will soon be back to giving him 47% of the vote.
2 | Alex D'Souza | 14 | 10154812215749729_10154813335989729 | Not surprising. But could he have beaten Trump in the primary? There were some strong contenders that Trump pushed aside easily. Any of them would have beaten Hillary too
3 | Anthony Ces√°reo-Cohen | 6 | 10154812215749729_10154813348484729 | Nothing to see here. A candidate that has not been subjected to the scrutiny and opposition research that comes with a presidential campaign will always fare better in a matchup against an actual candidate that has been running for a year and half. That's just common sense.
4 | Nguy·ªÖn Marcus | 4 | 10154812215749729_10154813371299729 | Please be real. This is only wild conjecture. How would Romney survive under a Trump barrage of lies and personal attacks? Jesus himself would wilt and lose his temper. Romney is also thinned skin.
5 | Gregor Samza | 0 | 10154812215749729_10154813457999729 | It's cruel to torture the old man, hasn't he offered himself as candidate 3 times in this election? He clearly expected the GOP convention delegates to unanimously endorse him and a heavenly host or two to bear him to Cleveland.Mickey Mouse has been the top write-in vote candidate since 1940.
6 | David Limbaugh | 0 | 10154812215749729_10154813493184729 | Any Republican but Trump easily beats Hillary this year. Any Democrat but Hillary easily beats Trump this year - this is like Vanderbilt and Missouri meeting in the SEC Championship Football game - competitive - but any other team shows up and wins over them handily.....
7 | Joseph Tate | 1 | 10154812215749729_10154813446869729 | I would vote for Romney! I lean Democrat,but I would support Romeny to send message to the Democratic party. They did Bernie Sanders wrong by hiding his voters' votes .
8 | Lisa Conner | 4 | 10154812215749729_10154813353279729 | No doubt Mitt Romney is more respectful than the drumpf (who isn't), but millions and millions and millions of us are so excited for Hillary.

10 | Jeff Hall | 1 | 10154812215749729_10154813543589729 | Is that because he slightly resembles Bill Pullman and we really want to hear that " Today is our Independence Day" speech live?
11 | Annie Mendelsohn | 0 | 10154812215749729_10154813336124729 | Trump on stage with Ted Nugent: When Ted Nugent was 32 years old, he released the song ‚ÄúJailbait.‚Äù Here‚Äôs a taste of the lyrics (written by him):Well, I don‚Äôt care if you‚Äôre just 13You look too good to be trueI just know that you‚Äôre probably clean...Jailbait you look fine, fine, fine...It‚Äôs quite alright, I asked your mamaWait a minute, officerDon‚Äôt put those handcuffs on mePut them on her, and I‚Äôll share her with you
12 | Mary Linderberg | 1 | 10154812215749729_10154813356919729 | Hillary has the accouterments, she has the name ID and she has the big donors; Hillary Clinton has a lot of advantages, but what she doesn't have is what Trump has---"the heart of the people."
13 | Mike Morgans | 0 | 10154812215749729_10154813362099729 | Who cares?  He decided not to run and there is no evidence he would have made it out of the primary.  WaPo has run out of things to post on until tomorrow.
14 | Lizzy Alexander | 1 | 10154812215749729_10154813401649729 | Hillary is one tough lady, who learned from the best -  President Obama -.! No way could Romney have survived this race!

20 | Amos Lane | 0 | 10154812215749729_10154813433844729 | We have witnessed the largest, most elaborate political coverup in history. Obama's Department of Justice, the mass media, the DNC and Hillary Clinton have almost succeeded, by attacking Trump. Their defense, was to go on offense and they flooded the media, with claims of violence, found to be planned and instigated by paid Team Hillary loons, who even rehearsed before hand. Their offense was all staged and fake. It‚Äôs all fake. Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt, dishonest politician to ever run for office.
21 | Flora Sussely | 0 | 10154812215749729_10154813336854729 | They had to go way down in the rat-filled sewer to find someone Hillary would look good against.

Just one more political norm shattered in 2016.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Lisa McGahee | 3 | 10154812175084729_10154813290799729 | 'Twas the night before Elections and all through the country, not one issue was forgotten, not even Donald Trump's money; the ballots were  put into the computers with care, in hopes that every citizen, even immigrants and refugees would all be treated fair. The donkeys and elephants were nestled and snug in their cage, while dreaming of women being paid the same wage. Hillary in her red suit and Donald in blue, had just looked over their first 100 day plans to see how they'll do. When online on Twitter, there rose such vitriolic banter, I quickly grabbed my phone to see what was the matter; I logged onto my account in a flash, only to see a comment from the GOP front runner, to be dismissed as brash. The responses and backlash had created quite a show, the immense retweets and favorites made me say no. When what to my wandering eyes should appear, a tweet from Miss Clinton, that was seen all across the northern hemisphere. "Delete your account" she said, oh no she didn't... Only to elicit responses like "You should be in prison!" Two candidates, both lively and quick, one tempered and the other quite impolitic. Their supporters are both very devout, "a basket of deplorables" is quite the name to tout; other names to be mentioned this election season were Sean Hannity, Alicia Machado, Obama, and Putin. From building walls to opening borders, something about this whole thing seems out of order; deleted emails and sexual assault, both candidates have serious faults. So when you choose to vote this election season, please make sure you do it with reason. Whether you want to Make America Great Again or You're With Her, don't blame the election results on the a rigged system, the "liberal media," or NBC's Katy Tur. As the decision draws near and almost out of sight, happy election to all and to all a goodnight!- Author: Isaiah McGahee (myself, first time voter) 11/7/2016
2 | Renita Kruger | 6 | 10154812175084729_10154812991574729 | To me the choice is clear: someone that used a private email server and has been investigated for years with investigations rendering no proof of wrong doing or a man who had six bankruptcies, wants to give tax breaks for the rich, does not believe in global warming, denies saying things that he said on tape, makes up conspiracies, has as his campaign CEO a leader of the Alt Right movement - who has run a news site that believes the holocaust did not happen and other racist neo-nazi propaganda-, who has been endorsed by the kkk and other white supremacist groups, who bullied disabled, women, immigrants, blacks, Latinos and others, who is a compulsive liar, is ignorant by all measures, threatens anyone who opposes him, has been accused of sexual molestation by several women and has bragged on tape about being a sexual predator, has not shown his taxes because what is in there would show something he does not want people to see, who defrauded thousands of people with TrumpU and other business, wants to deregulate wall street,  shows signs of personality disorder! Hillary is smart, prepared, sane, will fight against global warming, help students, keep marriage equality, keep women rights to choose, and equal pay for equal work!
3 | Marcel Baum | 4 | 10154812175084729_10154813874824729 | It would be absolutely dishonest to not call Trump a liar. He is a proven liar, the likes of which we have never seen. The media were so high on the ratings he brought that they spread his grotesque nonsense, blatant lies and unhinged misogyny for many months without challenging him on any of it. The result is that a man who is utterly without morals - a man who is so unhinged that if were to win global markets would be plunged into free fall - could very well succeed in winning the White House. To say that the media have failed in their duty is a towering understatement.
4 | Karen Irving Frioli | 4 | 10154812175084729_10154812936584729 | AND...For the media to get on board with the lies, creating even more. My biggest pet peeve now is people who believe everything they read. Do. Your. Own. Research. Searching for the #truth is common sense.
5 | Christy Jones Carter | 4 | 10154812175084729_10154812940324729 | I don't care if you are a republican, democrat, or independent....the CORRUPTION in The Clinton Camp AND within OBAMA's government should make you LIVID, ANGRY & PISSED OFF!!! Driving out CORRUPTION in our government should be a NON PARTISAN issue!!!! They have broken laws, rigged elections, bought out the media & have taken over our government & made it more of a communist, dictatorship!!! I am heartbroken that so many people would rather stay ignorant to the truth and blindly follow Hilary and not read ONE DAMN EMAIL that was leaked!!! How can you love America & continue to support a woman who has sold our country out?!? HOW?!? This election has uncovered a lot of truth & so have these LEAKED EMAILS:: TRUTH that Hilary broke the law by having a server & having TOP SECRET, CLASSIFIED Information on her server; which she used BleachBit to wipe clean (not with a cloth!); Hilary had 13 devices (not one for convenience like she lied about) & confessed to smashing them with a hammer; she told the FBI that she didn't remember what Classified meant; that Hilary will LIE TO YOUR FACE while you bury your child that she helped kill in Benghazi; Hilary hates Catholics, Gays, Arabs, Bernie Supporters & blacks (those super predators); Obama made sure the FBI didn't indite Hilary & emailed her knowing she had a private email account-(proving he also broke the law & KNEW she was breaking the law!); had Bill Clinton secretly meet with the DOJ Loretta Lynch on the airport Tarmac which was NOT about discussing grandchildren for over 30 minutes; the State department tried to BRIBE the FBI to Declassify some of Hilary's emails; the DNC rigged the system & stole the election from Bernie; tried to ruin Trump with sexual allegations that couldn't be denounced and proven false in time before the election- KNOWING that such allegations would be harmful even though they were NOT TRUE & that she tried to destroy the women who made sexual assault allegations about her husband; the democrat party has set up people to fight at Trump rallies and to incite violence & have PAID THEM TO DO SO; Dead Democrats are voting & George Soros (who OWNS Hilary) is linked to voting machines in 16 states that have major electoral college counts; truth that Hillary can sell her position at SOS & give favors to other countries through the Clinton Foundation for millions of dollars: Hilary & Bill have sold out our country for MILLIONS of dollars to Countries that SHE KNEW WERE FUNDING ISIS!!!! AND NOW....We are seeing all over the Internet that when the NYPD obtained Anthony Weiner's laptop there were emails from Hillary & Huma stored on it, evidence of bribery, treason, & child sex trafficking!

For the love of God----WAKE UP!!!! It is TIME to clean up the CORRUPTION that has spread throughout our government like a cancer! WE are AMERICANS & WE will see JUSTICE SERVED!!!

20 | Sergey Malovatov | 0 | 10154812175084729_10154813224544729 | The Hillary Clinton Story as Narrated by One of the Clinton InsidersHere is the inside story about how Hillary Clinton came to be corrupt.Richard Samuel "Dick" Morris, an American political author and commentator who previously worked as a pollster, political campaign consultant, and general political consultant has told us a story about Hillary Clinton, how she became the tainted, corrupt politician and scandalized state official.A friend and adviser to Bill Clinton during his time as Governor of Arkansas, Morris became a political adviser to the White House after Clinton was elected president in 1992. Morris encouraged Bill Clinton to pursue third way policies of triangulation that combined traditional Republican and Democratic proposals, rhetoric, and issues to achieve maximum political gain and popularity.Here is the story, folks!Hillary Clinton hasn‚Äôt always been a totally corrupt politician that we know her to be today. In the beginning of her political career, Hillary Clinton was entangled into several scandals like Whitewater and Cattle Trade futures that were bribed from the cattle market trade. However, that was peanuts compared to what she subsequently made.The story starts with the fact that when Bill Clinton was beginning to prepare to leave the White House he got hit with some unpleasant news, which was that he was going to lose his law license in Arkansas because of his Paula Jones litigation and his perjury in it. The Clintons did not much money saved up. He was living on his perks of the presidency and his 400 000 dollars pay check. However, Hillary and Bill became addicted to the perks of luxury after ten years in Arkansas governor‚Äôs mansion and eight years in the White House.The Clintons were living in a bubble of luxury that has become essential to lives. This story is told in detail in the book Armageddon: how Trump can beat Hillary, by Dick Morris, where he describes how they became addicted to all those perks; they had an airplane, limos, staff, free everything at their disposal.When they saw that they were going to leave the White House and were not going to be able to practice law, the Clintons hit on a new career. Bribery. Hillary described herself as dead broke. Psychologically she was afraid to be dead broke. They had a huge book contract. But Bill was disbarred. So, they decided on a career of bribery.Originally, their career was about having bankers and corporations pay Bill Clinton bribes so that he would help them deregulate the financial industry. In 1999 and 2000, Bill Clinton signed a legislation deregulating the big banks. That was something Bill had always opposed before. In return, two weeks after he left Office, Bill got paid a $125, 000 speaking fee from Morgan Stanley. It did not sound much considering their subsequent winnings, but he was paid $400,000 as president. So, $125,000 was a good piece of change.Bill was off to the races at that time and bank after bank were giving him large speaking fees. Hillary was given speaking fees too, but she was limited in her abilities in the Senate. Then as speculation mounted that Hillary would run for president in 2004 and 2005, the bribes increased. The speaking fees went up and the Clintons founded the Clinton Foundation so that the veneer of charity and the pretense of charity and some good works marginally thrown around to make it look good could become a major bribery receiving vehicle.Between the speaking fees and the Clinton Foundation they put together some serious change. When Hillary lost the race for president they seemed like they were set back. However, she got the position of the SOS and they were off to the races again.Soon, the Clinton Foundation donor list became what the Wall Street Journal called "a who's who of some of the world's wealthiest people." The Clinton Foundation's donor list highlighted the multiple layers of complexity to accumulating conflicts of interests. As Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton accepted donations to her family foundation from the same countries that she openly accused of failing to marshal a serious and sustained campaign to confront terrorism. Such was the hypocrisy of Hillary and Bill Clinton.As already stated by many experts, there is a clear conflict of interest regarding Hillary Clinton‚Äôs political career in connection with the Clinton Foundation‚Äôs operations. Gregory Suchan, a 34-year State Department veteran who helped lead the agency‚Äôs oversight of arms transfers under the Bush administration, said that the overlap between the list of Clinton Foundation donors and those with whom they did business presents a troubling conflict of interest.Despite their progressive liberal agenda, the Clintons went to raise money in the Middle Eastern countries. Bill Clinton received $1 million for two appearances sponsored by the Abu Dhabi government, the United Arab Emirates, that were arranged while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State. The United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar! They kept doing it during the period between when Hillary Clinton was at the State Department and later when she was running for President. They were also criticized for raising money from those governments, including the sheikhs in Saudi Arabia, that have very questionable human rights and certainly don't have equal rights for women.Human rights issues were not the only space in the U.S. foreign policy that suffered from the Clintons‚Äô criminal, if not treasonous, activity. For example, citing big-dollar donations from three fossil fuel giants - Chevron, Conoco Philips, and Exxon - a leading climate justice group called on the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Global Initiative to stop investing in or accepting money from the industry that's driving the global climate crisis.(to be continued, see page 2)
21 | Sergey Malovatov | 0 | 10154812175084729_10154813225499729 | The Hillary Clinton Story as Narrated by One of the Clinton Insiders(continued, page 4, Conclusion!)Based on her track record and abilities, Hillary Clinton is clearly not fit to be president. The conflict of interest created by the Clinton Foundation global network makes Hillary Clinton ineligible. Everybody knows that it is true and why. However, it seems to be difficult for certain corporations to resist the temptation to put their person in the most powerful position in the world. If she had not been so corrupt, Hilary Clinton would not have been allowed to run for president in the first place! To put an end to this era of unprecedented political corruption, economic stagnation, and cultural degradation of America, American people are voting for the only candidate who can deal with the corrupt problems as a genuine political leader and as an outsider to that political establishment that had created all these problems. Mr. Trump is untainted by the corrupt practices of the tenuous political process, regarding the current corrupt establishment.As opposed to scandal-riven Hillary Clinton, who has already committed enough crimes to be impeached even before considering presidency, Donald Trump has done nothing that legally or officially could make him unable to be considered for the position of head of state. This is the fundamental difference between these two presidential candidates. Because of her corruption, scandals, pay-for-play, emails, and lack of character, Hillary Clinton is ineligible. In these circumstances, there is no better presidential candidate than Donald Trump.  If you support Donald Trump, you support the only person capable of solving problems, many of which a great number of incumbent politicians are even unable to properly identify. For all his flaws and idiosyncrasies, Donald Trump is a true fighter with exceptional leadership skills and genuine love for his country. You might personally dislike him, but to say that Donald Trump should not have been allowed to run for president is simply disingenuous. There is no other way to right the wrongs that have been done to America over the past decade than to get out on November 8 and vote for Donald Trump!
22 | Sergey Malovatov | 0 | 10154812175084729_10154813225239729 | The Hillary Clinton Story as Narrated by One of the Clinton Insiders(continued, page 3)The essential element of bribery practice is cover up. So, the Clintons decided from the very beginning that Hillary Clinton would not use official servers but would use private servers both in the Senate and as Secretary of State. They needed to erase the bribery fingerprints and footprints. They needed to be able to go back and clean up their act so they would not get caught. That was the sole reason for private server.As we know, in the process, Hillary Clinton has endangered national security and put out national most innermost secrets to the whole outer world to hack. Naturally, Hillary Clinton considered that to be a cost of their dirty business. The important point was that she could not be accused of bribery because the smoking gun would be done away with by erasing the emails. The cynicism and their outright brazenness of conduct in this sordid affair is beyond any limits!While being protected by her rich Wall Street friends, the US government corrupt officials, and the media, Hillary Clinton has become increasingly arrogant in her dealing with the matters of national security. Among other things, Mrs. Clinton has for years violated the Espionage Act through negligence thereby causing a risk to national security. However, in the mind of Mrs. Clinton it was somehow a forgivable blooper. Her errors should have disqualified Hillary Clinton from obtaining a security clearance at any level long time ago. Besides, emails scandal has exposed a more than cozy relationship between the State Department and the Clinton Foundation.There is a profound degree of arrogance and sense of entitlement on the part of Mrs. Clinton. That poorly concealed sense of entitlement was not based on her merits or honest accomplishments as senator or secretary of state. She based her aspirations solely on her reliance on corrupt practices of the White House. The same practices that she and her husband had helped install during their tenures there.Hillary Clinton never concerned herself with the problems of the ordinary Americans and she herself admitted that she did not understand the problems of the ordinary men or women. This has also been exposed in the emails that have been revealed by WikiLeaks. In her own words, Hillary Clinton had admitted the fact of her and her husband‚Äôs detachment from the ordinary people‚Äôs lives and their detachment from the struggles of the middle class. She actually enjoyed it. And she enjoyed stating the fact, too. During her speeches to her Wall Street friends, she said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm kind of far removed because the life I‚Äôve lived and the economic, you know, fortunes that my husband and I now enjoy.‚ÄùHillary and Bill Clinton enjoyed their status of an elite couple. Mrs. Clinton‚Äôs allegedly popular standing with the American women is very superfluous and utterly superficial. During her 30 years in politics, Hillary Clinton‚Äôs agenda on women has made the US stand along with Papua New Guinea as the only nation in the world that does not yet guarantee paid maternity leave‚Ä¶That‚Äôs how it happened. That‚Äôs why and how Bill and Hillary Clinton became a racketeering organization. Their marriage that began as a romance and a partnership in the nineties, later it became a RICO (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization), a true racketeering organization that operated during this last decade and a half.This story has never been covered by the media. And this story must be made viral. It must be all over the place. We need to understand the historical background of this situation. It is laid out in the book (Armageddon: how Trump can beat Hillary) written by Dick Morris about how Bill and Hillary Clinton became fundamentally corrupt.Hillary Rodham Clinton has notoriously enjoyed a career that tragically resembled a career of a mobster and a ringleader inside a large group of nameless corrupted officials. Mrs. Clinton has been trying to use her own network of corrupted politicians, state officials, as well as mainstream news media to cover up for her former misdeeds and criminal violations.Using their Clinton Foundation as cover, Hillary Clinton and her husband have created a culture of pay-for-play politics, essentially selling access to US government resources to foreign and domestic bidders. In the process, they jeopardized the national interests of their own country. Very often, they acted against the clear interests of the nation and American people and to the detriment of the wellbeing and security of millions of fellow Americans.Hillary Clinton and her family‚Äôs foundation have become inseparable in the Clinton family‚Äôs corrupt practices. The conflict of interest created because of their activities has become the greatest evil that has faced the US during the last several decades. It has become destructive to the US democracy and American society in general.The recent FBI investigation has already demonstrated that the level of corruption and cronyism propitiated by the Clinton family and the Clinton Foundation global network has penetrated so deep into the political system of the United States that it turned out to be very hard to contain or eradicate this relatively recent malignant socio-political development.The cancerous body of corrupt and ineffective politics that Hillary Clinton along with her husband made possible through the Clinton Foundation over the past twenty or thirty years has proved too dangerous and unacceptable to the wellbeing, progress, and very existence of the nation. This corrupt system of totally rigged politics continued to grow and suck life blood from the US political and economic systems during the Obama administration.We have been witnessing an unprecedented collusion of the political power of the US government, the economic power of the corporations, and the soft power of the mainstream news media in an effort to create an illusion that Hillary Clinton has more popular support than she really does.(to be continued, see page 4)
23 | Sergey Malovatov | 0 | 10154812175084729_10154813225049729 | The Hillary Clinton Story as Narrated by One of the Clinton Insiders(continued, page 2)The duplicity of the Clinton‚Äôs family activities involving the Clinton Foundation could not be unnoticed because they have affected many other countries and the global economy. The Clintons were actually helping multinational corporations to become larger and gain advantages against competitors. This is what economists call an oligopoly, and it does not have much to do with the ostensible Clinton Foundation goal of expanding economic opportunity around the globe.When Hillary Clinton was the Secretary of State, they had something more tangible to sell. It was access to the Secretary of State. So, they went global. Bill traveled all over the world meeting with foreign leaders allegedly giving speeches for fees but I fact the fees were bribes. The contributions to the Clinton Foundation were bribes, as well. Those bribes were intended as payments for favorable treatment in the State Department. When she left the State Department and became a likely candidate for president, Hillary Clinton continued to receive those bribes disguised as speaking fees and donations to their family foundation.There are also inevitable political complications following the Clinton‚Äôs family high-rolling operations. The more she rubbed shoulders with financial executives and philanthropic giants the more it underscored the tension arising between Hillary Clinton‚Äôs elite connections and the populist image that she has been trying to project in the heat of the current presidential campaign. Hillary Clinton has been expressing concern over growing economic inequality in the U.S. and she seems to be trying to make this issue a cornerstone of her campaign. However, political observers are increasingly asking whether the former Secretary of State‚Äôs focus on wealth inequality sits uncomfortably with the close relationships she and her husband have nurtured with some of the world‚Äôs richest individuals.Using their Clinton Foundation as cover, Hillary Clinton and her husband have created a culture of pay-for-play politics, essentially selling access to US government resources to foreign and domestic bidders. Very often, they did so against the clear interests of the nation and American people and to the detriment of the wellbeing and security of millions of fellow Americans.The Clinton Foundation has become the key to a practice that is essentially evil and destructive to the democracy and society in general. It has penetrated deep into the political system and therefore is hard to contain or eradicate. The cancerous body that the Clinton Foundation has become over the years of Bill and Hillary Clinton in the White House, has continued to grow and suck life blood from American political and economic systems during the Obama administration.The Clinton family and their entrenched cronies from both the Democratic and Republican parties have essentially become part of a mafia that has long criminalized the US political infrastructure and demonized any possible political opponents. They have taken over control of the mainstream media so that nobody would be able to independently investigate and report on all the numerous crimes of the thoroughly corrupt politicians and state officials and their blatant violations of the US Constitution and the laws of the land.Hillary Clinton was essentially laying ground for her future political strategy that would follow her husband's tactic of the so-called triangulation. This strategy includes currying favor with Republican and corporate interests, while staying the course of progressive and liberal reforms. Bill Clinton is said to have been famous for doing that when he passed "welfare reform" legislation and deregulated the financial industry back in the 1990s. Those policies, according to many experts and analysts, are said to have paved the way for the current economic crisis the country is suffering now. Coupled with the corrupt practices of the Clinton Foundation, that such a strategy continued by Hillary Clinton might create even bigger problems in the future.The problem is that Hillary Clinton is a well-known deeply paranoid and power hungry person. She is very treacherous and untrustworthy even among her DC fellow politicians. A closet racist and a totally corrupt and intrinsically incompetent and narrow minded politician, Hillary Clinton, during the presidential campaign, has tried to turn the tables on Mr. Donald J. Trump with most absurd allegations.The desperation and viciousness of her insane accusations largely bespeak the lack of imagination and intelligence on the part of Mrs. Clinton who has no reputable or constructive track record of her own as Senator or Secretary of State. Therefore, Hillary Clinton is forced to spew venom and regurgitate unfounded and unsubstantiated accusations of the most bizarre and irresponsible kind.While being incapable of supporting her position with her own positive and constructive achievements as State Secretary or Senator, Hillary Clinton is relying solely on her corrupt circle of friends and relatives who are desperately trying to pull strings to help their hapless Democratic nominee get elected. Alas! Hillary Clinton has been too corrupt and reckless in her dealing with situations and her private email servers.Time has come to expose Hillary Clinton‚Äôs true character and her role of a ringleader inside that notoriously dangerous criminal network that has overtaken the US political infrastructure. American people and the whole world ought to see what Hillary Clinton and her criminal friends have done destroying America from the inside while millions of American citizens were suffering from the economic depression, dilapidated public infrastructure, and national humiliation on the international arena.Soon after in January, 2013, when she was released from the hospital suffering her degenerative vascular sinus thrombosis (blood clots in the brain), Hillary Clinton began her preparations for 2016 presidential race. Ever since, the Clinton Foundation has been essentially used to fund Hillary Clinton‚Äôs presidential campaign and fill her coffers with illegal proceeds while doing things that have created conflict of interest, forced Mrs. Clinton to delete all her emails, and even cover up the murder of innocent Americans!(to be continued, see page 3)

Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton made their final pitches.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Words and Sounds News | 0 | 10154812852024729_10154813260599729 | An URGENT APPEAL to U.S. voters ...Tuesday‚Äôs presidential election will likely be the most important vote in modern history not only for the U.S., but probably also for the Western world. At a time like this, it is vital that everyone put aside blind allegiances to parties or ideologies and focus on what will truly be best for the common good and the welfare of all people.Looking at the issues dispassionately, there is only one realistic choice. It involves the pitting of The Establishment versus a candidate who has the well-being of the common people at heart. The recent imbroglio concerning emails is probably the least of the scandals surrounding Hillary Clinton and her family. One analysis pegs the number of scandals around her at 25 and counting.Some relate to her family‚Äôs foundation and the selling of access in returns for contributions. Others concern her husband‚Äôs vile treatment of women (he was impeached and paid $850,000 to one woman) and her enabling of same, Travelgate, Whitewater, high-paid speeches to Wall Street insiders, questionable cattle futures trading, her discipleship of radical activist Saul Alinsky, the Benghazi tragedy and more.But scandals aside, it is Hillary Clinton‚Äôs known policies that are of greater concern. She will continue the Barack Obama practice of running up the national debt to unsustainable levels (currently at $20 trillion with unfunded liabilities of tens of trillions more). Her support for open borders will allow more criminals and terrorists, as well as other drains on American resources, into the country. She will pursue the globalist policies that have gutted U.S. manufacturing and shuttered its factories.She will continue needlessly sabre-rattling with Russia and create a more dangerous world. She will keep taxes high or raise them yet further, when the common people are already overburdened financially.Her opponent, on the other hand, eschews Establishment politics, which is why he is getting such blowback from the usual suspects, particularly the corporate media that are in the pocket of the Big Interests. He will address the financial crisis the U.S. is embroiled in, address illegal immigration, porous borders and terrorism, bring jobs back to the U.S., lower taxes and dialogue with Vladimir Putin to create a safer world for all of us.On all fronts, personal and collective, there is only one serious choice. U.S voters have the power to take back their country from the elites and Big Interests and ensure the government represents their interests, as governments are meant to do.On Tuesday, VOTE Donald J. Trump FOR PRESIDENT.
2 | Lisa McGahee | 1 | 10154812852024729_10154813290599729 | 'Twas the night before Elections and all through the country, not one issue was forgotten, not even Donald Trump's money; the ballots were  put into the computers with care, in hopes that every citizen, even immigrants and refugees would all be treated fair. The donkeys and elephants were nestled and snug in their cage, while dreaming of women being paid the same wage. Hillary in her red suit and Donald in blue, had just looked over their first 100 day plans to see how they'll do. When online on Twitter, there rose such vitriolic banter, I quickly grabbed my phone to see what was the matter; I logged onto my account in a flash, only to see a comment from the GOP front runner, to be dismissed as brash. The responses and backlash had created quite a show, the immense retweets and favorites made me say no. When what to my wandering eyes should appear, a tweet from Miss Clinton, that was seen all across the northern hemisphere. "Delete your account" she said, oh no she didn't... Only to elicit responses like "You should be in prison!" Two candidates, both lively and quick, one tempered and the other quite impolitic. Their supporters are both very devout, "a basket of deplorables" is quite the name to tout; other names to be mentioned this election season were Sean Hannity, Alicia Machado, Obama, and Putin. From building walls to opening borders, something about this whole thing seems out of order; deleted emails and sexual assault, both candidates have serious faults. So when you choose to vote this election season, please make sure you do it with reason. Whether you want to Make America Great Again or You're With Her, don't blame the election results on the a rigged system, the "liberal media," or NBC's Katy Tur. As the decision draws near and almost out of sight, happy election to all and to all a goodnight!- Author: Isaiah McGahee (myself, first time voter) 11/7/2016

However, that was peanuts compared to what she subsequently made.The story starts with the fact that when Bill Clinton was beginning to prepare to leave the White House he got hit with some unpleasant news, which was that he was going to lose his law license in Arkansas because of his Paula Jones litigation and his perjury in it. The Clintons did not much money saved up. He was living on his perks of the presidency and his 400 000 dollars pay check. However, Hillary and Bill became addicted to the perks of luxury after ten years in Arkansas governor‚Äôs mansion and eight years in the White House.The Clintons were living in a bubble of luxury that has become essential to lives. This story is told in detail in the book Armageddon: how Trump can beat Hillary, by Dick Morris, where he describes how they became addicted to all those perks; they had an airplane, limos, staff, free everything at their disposal.When they saw that they were going to leave the White House and were not going to be able to practice law, the Clintons hit on a new career. Bribery. Hillary described herself as dead broke. Psychologically she was afraid to be dead broke. They had a huge book contract. But Bill was disbarred. So, they decided on a career of bribery.Originally, their career was about having bankers and corporations pay Bill Clinton bribes so that he would help them deregulate the financial industry. In 1999 and 2000, Bill Clinton signed a legislation deregulating the big banks. That was something Bill had always opposed before. In return, two weeks after he left Office, Bill got paid a $125, 000 speaking fee from Morgan Stanley. It did not sound much considering their subsequent winnings, but he was paid $400,000 as president. So, $125,000 was a good piece of change.Bill was off to the races at that time and bank after bank were giving him large speaking fees. Hillary was given speaking fees too, but she was limited in her abilities in the Senate. Then as speculation mounted that Hillary would run for president in 2004 and 2005, the bribes increased. The speaking fees went up and the Clintons founded the Clinton Foundation so that the veneer of charity and the pretense of charity and some good works marginally thrown around to make it look good could become a major bribery receiving vehicle.Between the speaking fees and the Clinton Foundation they put together some serious change. When Hillary lost the race for president they seemed like they were set back. However, she got the position of the SOS and they were off to the races again.Soon, the Clinton Foundation donor list became what the Wall Street Journal called "a who's who of some of the world's wealthiest people." The Clinton Foundation's donor list highlighted the multiple layers of complexity to accumulating conflicts of interests. As Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton accepted donations to her family foundation from the same countries that she openly accused of failing to marshal a serious and sustained campaign to confront terrorism. Such was the hypocrisy of Hillary and Bill Clinton.As already stated by many experts, there is a clear conflict of interest regarding Hillary Clinton‚Äôs political career in connection with the Clinton Foundation‚Äôs operations. Gregory Suchan, a 34-year State Department veteran who helped lead the agency‚Äôs oversight of arms transfers under the Bush administration, said that the overlap between the list of Clinton Foundation donors and those with whom they did business presents a troubling conflict of interest.Despite their progressive liberal agenda, the Clintons went to raise money in the Middle Eastern countries. Bill Clinton received $1 million for two appearances sponsored by the Abu Dhabi government, the United Arab Emirates, that were arranged while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State. The United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar! They kept doing it during the period between when Hillary Clinton was at the State Department and later when she was running for President. They were also criticized for raising money from those governments, including the sheikhs in Saudi Arabia, that have very questionable human rights and certainly don't have equal rights for women.Human rights issues were not the only space in the U.S. foreign policy that suffered from the Clintons‚Äô criminal, if not treasonous, activity. For example, citing big-dollar donations from three fossil fuel giants - Chevron, Conoco Philips, and Exxon - a leading climate justice group called on the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Global Initiative to stop investing in or accepting money from the industry that's driving the global climate crisis.(to be continued, see page 2)

The Clintons were actually helping multinational corporations to become larger and gain advantages against competitors. This is what economists call an oligopoly, and it does not have much to do with the ostensible Clinton Foundation goal of expanding economic opportunity around the globe.When Hillary Clinton was the Secretary of State, they had something more tangible to sell. It was access to the Secretary of State. So, they went global. Bill traveled all over the world meeting with foreign leaders allegedly giving speeches for fees but I fact the fees were bribes. The contributions to the Clinton Foundation were bribes, as well. Those bribes were intended as payments for favorable treatment in the State Department. When she left the State Department and became a likely candidate for president, Hillary Clinton continued to receive those bribes disguised as speaking fees and donations to their family foundation.There are also inevitable political complications following the Clinton‚Äôs family high-rolling operations. The more she rubbed shoulders with financial executives and philanthropic giants the more it underscored the tension arising between Hillary Clinton‚Äôs elite connections and the populist image that she has been trying to project in the heat of the current presidential campaign. Hillary Clinton has been expressing concern over growing economic inequality in the U.S. and she seems to be trying to make this issue a cornerstone of her campaign. However, political observers are increasingly asking whether the former Secretary of State‚Äôs focus on wealth inequality sits uncomfortably with the close relationships she and her husband have nurtured with some of the world‚Äôs richest individuals.Using their Clinton Foundation as cover, Hillary Clinton and her husband have created a culture of pay-for-play politics, essentially selling access to US government resources to foreign and domestic bidders. Very often, they did so against the clear interests of the nation and American people and to the detriment of the wellbeing and security of millions of fellow Americans.The Clinton Foundation has become the key to a practice that is essentially evil and destructive to the democracy and society in general. It has penetrated deep into the political system and therefore is hard to contain or eradicate. The cancerous body that the Clinton Foundation has become over the years of Bill and Hillary Clinton in the White House, has continued to grow and suck life blood from American political and economic systems during the Obama administration.The Clinton family and their entrenched cronies from both the Democratic and Republican parties have essentially become part of a mafia that has long criminalized the US political infrastructure and demonized any possible political opponents. They have taken over control of the mainstream media so that nobody would be able to independently investigate and report on all the numerous crimes of the thoroughly corrupt politicians and state officials and their blatant violations of the US Constitution and the laws of the land.Hillary Clinton was essentially laying ground for her future political strategy that would follow her husband's tactic of the so-called triangulation. This strategy includes currying favor with Republican and corporate interests, while staying the course of progressive and liberal reforms. Bill Clinton is said to have been famous for doing that when he passed "welfare reform" legislation and deregulated the financial industry back in the 1990s. Those policies, according to many experts and analysts, are said to have paved the way for the current economic crisis the country is suffering now. Coupled with the corrupt practices of the Clinton Foundation, that such a strategy continued by Hillary Clinton might create even bigger problems in the future.The problem is that Hillary Clinton is a well-known deeply paranoid and power hungry person. She is very treacherous and untrustworthy even among her DC fellow politicians. A closet racist and a totally corrupt and intrinsically incompetent and narrow minded politician, Hillary Clinton, during the presidential campaign, has tried to turn the tables on Mr. Donald J. Trump with most absurd allegations.The desperation and viciousness of her insane accusations largely bespeak the lack of imagination and intelligence on the part of Mrs. Clinton who has no reputable or constructive track record of her own as Senator or Secretary of State. Therefore, Hillary Clinton is forced to spew venom and regurgitate unfounded and unsubstantiated accusations of the most bizarre and irresponsible kind.While being incapable of supporting her position with her own positive and constructive achievements as State Secretary or Senator, Hillary Clinton is relying solely on her corrupt circle of friends and relatives who are desperately trying to pull strings to help their hapless Democratic nominee get elected. Alas! Hillary Clinton has been too corrupt and reckless in her dealing with situations and her private email servers.Time has come to expose Hillary Clinton‚Äôs true character and her role of a ringleader inside that notoriously dangerous criminal network that has overtaken the US political infrastructure. American people and the whole world ought to see what Hillary Clinton and her criminal friends have done destroying America from the inside while millions of American citizens were suffering from the economic depression, dilapidated public infrastructure, and national humiliation on the international arena.Soon after in January, 2013, when she was released from the hospital suffering her degenerative vascular sinus thrombosis (blood clots in the brain), Hillary Clinton began her preparations for 2016 presidential race. Ever since, the Clinton Foundation has been essentially used to fund Hillary Clinton‚Äôs presidential campaign and fill her coffers with illegal proceeds while doing things that have created conflict of interest, forced Mrs. Clinton to delete all her emails, and even cover up the murder of innocent Americans!(to be continued, see page 3)
7 | Sergey Malovatov | 0 | 10154812852024729_10154813225664729 | The Hillary Clinton Story as Narrated by One of the Clinton Insiders(continued, page 4, Conclusion!)Based on her track record and abilities, Hillary Clinton is clearly not fit to be president. The conflict of interest created by the Clinton Foundation global network makes Hillary Clinton ineligible. Everybody knows that it is true and why. However, it seems to be difficult for certain corporations to resist the temptation to put their person in the most powerful position in the world. If she had not been so corrupt, Hilary Clinton would not have been allowed to run for president in the first place! To put an end to this era of unprecedented political corruption, economic stagnation, and cultural degradation of America, American people are voting for the only candidate who can deal with the corrupt problems as a genuine political leader and as an outsider to that political establishment that had created all these problems. Mr. Trump is untainted by the corrupt practices of the tenuous political process, regarding the current corrupt establishment.As opposed to scandal-riven Hillary Clinton, who has already committed enough crimes to be impeached even before considering presidency, Donald Trump has done nothing that legally or officially could make him unable to be considered for the position of head of state. This is the fundamental difference between these two presidential candidates. Because of her corruption, scandals, pay-for-play, emails, and lack of character, Hillary Clinton is ineligible. In these circumstances, there is no better presidential candidate than Donald Trump.  If you support Donald Trump, you support the only person capable of solving problems, many of which a great number of incumbent politicians are even unable to properly identify. For all his flaws and idiosyncrasies, Donald Trump is a true fighter with exceptional leadership skills and genuine love for his country. You might personally dislike him, but to say that Donald Trump should not have been allowed to run for president is simply disingenuous. There is no other way to right the wrongs that have been done to America over the past decade than to get out on November 8 and vote for Donald Trump!
8 | Sergey Malovatov | 0 | 10154812852024729_10154813225989729 | The Hillary Clinton Story as Narrated by One of the Clinton Insiders(continued, page 3)The essential element of bribery practice is cover up. So, the Clintons decided from the very beginning that Hillary Clinton would not use official servers but would use private servers both in the Senate and as Secretary of State. They needed to erase the bribery fingerprints and footprints. They needed to be able to go back and clean up their act so they would not get caught. That was the sole reason for private server.As we know, in the process, Hillary Clinton has endangered national security and put out national most innermost secrets to the whole outer world to hack. Naturally, Hillary Clinton considered that to be a cost of their dirty business. The important point was that she could not be accused of bribery because the smoking gun would be done away with by erasing the emails. The cynicism and their outright brazenness of conduct in this sordid affair is beyond any limits!While being protected by her rich Wall Street friends, the US government corrupt officials, and the media, Hillary Clinton has become increasingly arrogant in her dealing with the matters of national security. Among other things, Mrs. Clinton has for years violated the Espionage Act through negligence thereby causing a risk to national security. However, in the mind of Mrs. Clinton it was somehow a forgivable blooper. Her errors should have disqualified Hillary Clinton from obtaining a security clearance at any level long time ago. Besides, emails scandal has exposed a more than cozy relationship between the State Department and the Clinton Foundation.There is a profound degree of arrogance and sense of entitlement on the part of Mrs. Clinton. That poorly concealed sense of entitlement was not based on her merits or honest accomplishments as senator or secretary of state. She based her aspirations solely on her reliance on corrupt practices of the White House. The same practices that she and her husband had helped install during their tenures there.Hillary Clinton never concerned herself with the problems of the ordinary Americans and she herself admitted that she did not understand the problems of the ordinary men or women. This has also been exposed in the emails that have been revealed by WikiLeaks. In her own words, Hillary Clinton had admitted the fact of her and her husband‚Äôs detachment from the ordinary people‚Äôs lives and their detachment from the struggles of the middle class. She actually enjoyed it. And she enjoyed stating the fact, too. During her speeches to her Wall Street friends, she said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm kind of far removed because the life I‚Äôve lived and the economic, you know, fortunes that my husband and I now enjoy.‚ÄùHillary and Bill Clinton enjoyed their status of an elite couple. Mrs. Clinton‚Äôs allegedly popular standing with the American women is very superfluous and utterly superficial. During her 30 years in politics, Hillary Clinton‚Äôs agenda on women has made the US stand along with Papua New Guinea as the only nation in the world that does not yet guarantee paid maternity leave‚Ä¶That‚Äôs how it happened. That‚Äôs why and how Bill and Hillary Clinton became a racketeering organization. Their marriage that began as a romance and a partnership in the nineties, later it became a RICO (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization), a true racketeering organization that operated during this last decade and a half.This story has never been covered by the media. And this story must be made viral. It must be all over the place. We need to understand the historical background of this situation. It is laid out in the book (Armageddon: how Trump can beat Hillary) written by Dick Morris about how Bill and Hillary Clinton became fundamentally corrupt.Hillary Rodham Clinton has notoriously enjoyed a career that tragically resembled a career of a mobster and a ringleader inside a large group of nameless corrupted officials. Mrs. Clinton has been trying to use her own network of corrupted politicians, state officials, as well as mainstream news media to cover up for her former misdeeds and criminal violations.Using their Clinton Foundation as cover, Hillary Clinton and her husband have created a culture of pay-for-play politics, essentially selling access to US government resources to foreign and domestic bidders. In the process, they jeopardized the national interests of their own country. Very often, they acted against the clear interests of the nation and American people and to the detriment of the wellbeing and security of millions of fellow Americans.Hillary Clinton and her family‚Äôs foundation have become inseparable in the Clinton family‚Äôs corrupt practices. The conflict of interest created because of their activities has become the greatest evil that has faced the US during the last several decades. It has become destructive to the US democracy and American society in general.The recent FBI investigation has already demonstrated that the level of corruption and cronyism propitiated by the Clinton family and the Clinton Foundation global network has penetrated so deep into the political system of the United States that it turned out to be very hard to contain or eradicate this relatively recent malignant socio-political development.The cancerous body of corrupt and ineffective politics that Hillary Clinton along with her husband made possible through the Clinton Foundation over the past twenty or thirty years has proved too dangerous and unacceptable to the wellbeing, progress, and very existence of the nation. This corrupt system of totally rigged politics continued to grow and suck life blood from the US political and economic systems during the Obama administration.We have been witnessing an unprecedented collusion of the political power of the US government, the economic power of the corporations, and the soft power of the mainstream news media in an effort to create an illusion that Hillary Clinton has more popular support than she really does.(to be continued, see page 4)

If you‚Äôre under 35, read on‚ÄîI promise you that you will be amazed at what you missed! (By the way, sadly, this isn‚Äôt a joke. I wish it was.)REMEMBER WHEN BILL CLINTON WAS PRESIDENT?(January 20, 1993 to January 20, 2001‚Äîtwo terms)When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over an attempt to reform health care. Her proposed plan was so bad that many Democrats came up with competing plans of their own in protest, and in spite of threats and intimidation, on September 26, 1994, the ‚ÄúHillarycare‚Äù bill was declared dead.This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million for studies, promotion, and other efforts.Then, President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general. Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood‚Äîboth were forced to withdraw their names from consideration. Next, she chose Janet Reno, which husband Bill described as "my worst mistake." (Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.)Husband Bill also allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission‚ÄîLani Guanier was her selection. After considerable backlash from prominent Democratic senators concerning Ms. Guanier's radical views, Bill Clinton withdrew her name from nomination, stating that she did not represents the civil rights views that he had championed during his campaign.However, apparently a slow learner, husband Bill continued to allow Hillary to make more recommendations. She chose former law partners, Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department. Her selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kennedy was forced to resign. (Is anyone wondering yet what her Supreme Court Justice appointments would be like?)Many younger voters will have no knowledge of "Travelgate," the first major ethics controversy during Bill‚Äôs presidency.Hillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend, Harry Thompson‚Äîbut the White House Travel Office refused to comply. She trumped up allegations of financial mismanagement and reported seven long-time White House employees to the FBI. This ruined their reputations, got them fired, and caused a thirty-six month investigation. Eventually, most of the employees were reinstated and Clinton associates were forced out of the travel office. Only one White House employee, Billy Dale, was charged with a crime‚Äîthe enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds; a jury acquitted him in less than two hours.Still not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House Security. When Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies (Filegate) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff, suddenly Hillary and the President denied even knowing Livingstone, and of course, denied knowledge of drug use in the White House.Following this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents.Next, when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by Bill Clinton, Hillary was put in charge of the "bimbo eruption" and scandal defense. Let‚Äôs look at some of her more notable decisions in this regard . . . She urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation, they settled with Ms. Jones. She refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor. After $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr's investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs. Hillary's devious game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for 'lying under oath' to a grand jury, followed by his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives. Hillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, "I do not recall," "I have no recollection," and "I don't know" a total of 56 times while under oath. (Sound familiar?) After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had "mistakenly thought was hers."So you see, the email scandal and all of her malfeasance regarding the handling of Top Secret information, not to mention the "pay to play" schemes of the Clinton Foundation, are nothing new. Hillary‚Äôs entire political career has been nothing but a web of lies, corruption and destruction in her quest for power.Is anyone else ready to say, ‚ÄúEnough is enough!‚Äù?But unfortunately, I‚Äôm sure her loyal fans will say, "What difference does it make?"

1 | Justin Schillo | 1 | 10154812653284729_10154812660209729 | That's all well and good, but why do I care if this guy carries one lone state, least of all Utah?  Utah isn't going to swing this election one way or the other.
2 | Adamo Ferrari | 1 | 10154812653284729_10154812838814729 | ‚ö†If you are Gay, Why are you voting for Hillary when she wants to bring in thousands of refugees that believe all Gays should be executed?üëÅ‚ö†If you are Black, Why are you voting for Hillary when she admires Margaret Sanger and defends Planned Parenthood who want to abort as many black babies as possible? Exterminate the black race because they are like "weeds". (Margaret Sanger quote) Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.üëÅ‚ö†If you are a Christian, Why are you voting for Hillary Clinton when she wrote her Senior thesis on Saul Alinsky who dedicated his book 'Rules for Radicals' to Lucifer (the Devil)? She says he was, and still is her mentor.üëÅ‚ö†If you are a Veteran, in the Military, or closely related to a Military member, Why are you voting for Hillary when she left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again? They called for help but the help was told to stand down.üëÅ‚ö†If you have a factory job, Why are you voting for Hillary when she supported TPP? Factory workers are being laid off because jobs are going over seas. Don't forget the deals she's made with china. She also welcomes open borders and illegals to get benefits to be paid with Your tax money.üëÅ‚ö†If you are poor, Why are you voting for Hillary, when she is supporting Wall street and all the big banks? Big banks keep poor people poor by destroying the poor man's credit by allowing medical bills and collections to affect your credit scores so you can pay higher interest rates than the rich; Taking much of the little money you earn.üëÅ‚ö†If you are a Woman, how can you vote for Hillary when she has buried all of Bills rape victims under the rug, including that little girl that was raped? Lawyer Hillary defended the rapist, and then she laughed about it later, knowing that he was guilty.If you carry a gun, or believe in the Constitution; How can you vote for Hillary when she wants to eliminate the NRA, Take your guns, and abolish the second Amendment?üëÅ‚ö†If you breathe, Why would you vote for Hillary when she and the Clinton crime family have left a trail of dead people that did not agree with her, or they knew too much?Who is left? üëÅ

11 | Kevin McGuire | 0 | 10154812653284729_10154812974839729 | For all the talk of buffoonery versus criminality, the divide, at least in November 2016, is over issues and ostensibly could not be clearer for both conservatives and liberals. On the Supreme Court, Obamacare, the debt, rebuilding the military, the Second Amendment, school choice, abortion, reforming the tax code, reexamining regulation, energy exploration and production, illegal immigration, sanctuary cities, and a host of other issues, the Republican ticket is the antithesis of Clinton/Kaine ‚Äî and is recognized as such by nearly all progressives. Unlike the Democratic prospect, the conservative message oddly still has the chance of being empowered by both Houses of Congress and eventually a Supreme Court.Victor Davis Hanson

The largest shift in vote support from 2012 is among white college graduates, a group Democrats have not won at the presidential election in any contest since at least 1980.

Take this article, for example. The lede describes Clinton as maintaining a "narrow" 4-point advantage over Trump. Barack Obama won the popular vote count by 4 percentage points in 2012 ... that wasn't described as "narrow" or "slim." Why is this lead described as such?
2 | Kathie Routman Dior | 1 | 10154812213809729_10154812472149729 | HARD CORE DEMOCRATS don't care that Hillary Clinton flip flops her views as needed to get votes. They don't care that she has lied repeatedly for years. They don't care that she helped create a health care system that is about to fail, leaving millions by the wayside. They don't care that she was instrumental in the very creation of a morphed Al Qaeda, now called ISIS. They don't care that millions of people have either died or have been displaced by her instrumentation of such. They don't care that her Clinton Foundation has taken hundreds of millions of dollars from countries that kill gays and stone women. They don't care that she has committed treasonous acts via her foundation by doing favors for enemy nations. They don't care that she and her husband have created an enterprise whereby all the mainstream media, including the New York Times, CNN, NBC, ABC, Comcast, can donate for favors, and then in return they broadcast propaganda in HER favor. They don't care that she has been so incredibly successful at wielding money and power from the world's largest companies, here and abroad, that she rules over the entire Obama administration, including President Obama, Attorney General Loretta Lynch, and FBI director James Comey. They don't care that she believes killing a baby hours before its natural birth trumps a mother's choice to have the baby slaughtered. They don't care that she has never done anything to improve the plight of Blacks or Hispanics who may be caught in a inter-generational web of dependency, poverty, and unemployment. They don't care that she has done nothing about the bad schools, drugs, and crime in the ghetto. They don't care that she called Blacks "super predators." They don't care that she approved of her husband's law that resulted in the incarceration of many thousands of minorities. They don't care that she is indifferent to the millions of immigrants who come to our shores legally, and spend large amounts of time and money in order to become U.S. citizens, while others cut in line. They don't care that she has done nothing to stop drugs from infiltrating our towns and cities. They don't care that she blatantly cheated by being given primary debate questions in advance. They don't care to think about why her answers during the debates seemed so well rehearsed, almost memorized. They don't care that her organization worked to plant violent operatives in Trump rallies. They don't care about how women were paid off to claim harassment by Trump. You know what? The problem is not that hard core democrats don't care that Hillary Clinton is a liar, a cheat, and a thief. The problem is that they are willing to support a morally bankrupt candidate.

Over the course of his entire presidential campaign, Donald Trump has been in a war with the media, often accusing news outlets of fabricating negatives stories about him to hurt his White House bid. While Trump's battle with the media is at an all-time high, there's one story that most mainstream media outlets have avoided reporting.Trump lawsuitIn the summer of 1994, a woman known only as "Jane Doe" was allegedly raped and threatened by Trump and convicted pedophile Jeffery Epstein. The woman previously filed a lawsuit in California, but the judge dismissed the case. Attempting to have her voice heard once again, "Jane Doe" made her case once again and it was strong enough to move forward in a New York court. Federal Judge Ronnie Abrams has since ordered a status conference to be held on December 16, with the legal representatives of both sides being present in the courtroom. As pointed out by the Bipartisan Report on October 23, new details have been revealed, painting a grim and dark picture about what allegedly went down over 20 years ago.The victim, known as "Jane Doe," filed the lawsuit under her assumed real name of Katie Johnson. Details in the lawsuit claim that she was the subject of, but not limited to, "acts of rape, sexual misconduct, criminal sexual acts," as well as "false imprisonment" and "threats of death." The incident apparently took place on more than one occasion, with the most emotionally scaring encounter occurring during the fourth and final time."Trump tied Plaintiff to a bed, exposed himself to Plaintiff, and then proceeded to forcibly rape Plaintiff," the lawsuit continues, describing the alleged rape as a "savage sexual attack." The plaintiff, "Jane Done" or Katie Johnson, claims she "loudly pleaded" for the former host of "The Apprentice" to stop, before he "violently" struck her face with his hand and informed the victim that he would "do whatever he wanted."In yet another bizarre twist to the alleged encounter, Epstein reportedly got into a heated exchange with Trump for taking the victim's virginity because he wanted to be the one to do so. In conclusion, both the Republican nominee and Epstein allegedly told the plaintiff that they would kill her and her family if she ever spoke about what happened.  A witness has come forward to confirm her story.Hiring Women Based on AppearancesGroping a Woman at a Manhattan NightclubGroping and Kissing a Former Apprentice ContestantKissing a Mar-a-Lago Guest at a Mother‚Äôs Day BrunchGroping a Woman Outside the 1998 U.S. Open Tennis ChampionshipSalma Hayak comes forward:  Trump planted a negative article about her after she refused to date himAn 11th person has come forward with allegations.

8 | Sergey Malovatov | 0 | 10154812213809729_10154812440354729 | Do not trust the mainstream news media networks!Any person who loves his or her nation will get out and vote for Donald Trump! The media outlets managers are controlled by the corrupt and crime-riven government and multinational corporations who do not care about America or American people.Hillary Clinton has been exposed as a seasoned criminal with multiple offences and a more horrible person than any other modern politician! Regardless of FBI‚Äôs recent announcement that the Clinton email probe is over, new pieces of evidence against scandal-riven Hillary Clinton may well appear any moment and new charges against her will be brought with renewed vigor. Hillary Clinton is too tainted to be a reliable contender for any future political role or public office. Hillary‚Äôs days are over! She is a political cadaver and a too incompetent and physically and mentally exhausted person. Hillary Clinton is being protected by the donor to the Clinton Foundation. Her past crimes and multi-million donations make Hillary Clinton even more dependent on her bosses. A new batch of WikiLeaks-revealed emails might appear at any moment and Hillary Clinton will become faced with a grim prospect being indicted for her past sins.Hillary Clinton suffers a degenerative cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) that occurs when blood clots form in the brain's venous sinuses. She was diagnosed with CVST back in 2013. CVST prevents blood from draining out of her brain. It leads to deteriorating physical and mental condition, strokes, fainting, and occasional mental shutdowns. A sudden medical event on her part might easily prevent Hillary Clinton from being used by her special interest groups as their representative. That is why this aspect of Hillary Clinton‚Äôs ability to perform the duties of president has been closely guarded by her family members, her corporate handlers, and campaign managers.They certainly will not be stopped by the fact that Hillary Clinton and her team are greedy, incompetent, disloyal, untrustworthy, pathetic losers who have no idea how to run a country... The Clintons are totally corrupt and their political machinery are but gangsters, fraudsters, and corrupt politicians backed by certain corporations and financiers. Hillary Clinton is totally incompetent and wholly dependent on her domestic and foreign donors, was to be elected president. Hillary Clinton is too unqualified to be president! Everybody knows that. But the desire to put their own person in that position is too strong for certain interest groups to resist it. That is why we have been witnessing such unprecedented collusion of the political interests and power of the US government, the economic interests and power of the corporations, and the personal and administrative interests and power of the mainstream news media managers trying to create an illusion that Hillary Clinton has more popular support than she could ever dream of, based on her personal track record and abilities.That is why we cannot trust the mainstream media's lies about Hillary Clinton and her political circle. Frail, incompetent, and increasingly vulnerable, she has surrounded herself with a team of advisers and experts that are just as corrupt, unprincipled, and incompetent as Hillary Clinton herself is. Her staff is corrupt and unreliable to an appallingly high degree. Personally, she cannot make a good informed decision with this regard! As she gets increasingly fragile physically and mentally, practically all Hillary Clinton‚Äôs picks inevitably become manipulative and untrustworthy almost from the start of their hapless careers. HRC can be best compared to a ringleader with high ambitions but rapidly diminishing capabilities. Like in a typical mob, they are picked based on their criminality, loyalty to their boss, and readiness to violate any law and regulation ‚Äì including the Constitution ‚Äì to please their criminally minded leaders.People like Hillary Clinton and her immensely corrupt and dishonest cronies cannot be highly qualified experts in anything except deception, fraud, theft, and other criminal activities. The corrupt and dishonest Clinton family along with their treasonous advisers and treacherous filthy rich donors from the Wall Street and foreign corporations can only bring terror, impoverishment, and disgrace to the nation!

So say the researchers:------------------Bullshit is a consequential aspect of the human condition. Indeed, with the rise of communication technology, people are likely encountering more bullshit in their everyday lives than ever before. ‚Ä¶ Using vagueness or ambiguity to mask a lack of meaningfulness is surely common in political rhetoric, marketing, and even academia. One of the most salient features of our culture is that there is so much bullshit. Everyone knows this. Each of us contributes his share. One benefit of gaining a better understanding of how we reject others‚Äô bullshit is that it may teach us to be more cognizant of our own bullshit.

No wrongdoing, No Charges, Case Closed.The Clinton Foundation is NOT under Investigation by the FBI.  However, the Trump Foundation is still under Investigation by the New York Attorney General for ‚ÄúPay to Play‚Äù and ‚ÄúSelf-Dealing‚Äù.There is an anti-Clinton faction in an FBI office that is suspected of releasing and leaking information in an attempt to get Donald Trump elected president.Stunning Report Finds Anti-Clinton FBI Agents Are Trying To Get Trump Elected PresidentThere is an anti-Clinton faction in an FBI office that is suspected of releasing and leaking information in an attempt to get Donald Trump elected president.Reuters reported:The new emails turned up as FBI investigators were examining electronic devices used by former Democratic Representative Anthony Weiner in connection with an alleged ‚Äúsexting‚Äù scandal. Weiner‚Äôs estranged wife, Huma Abedin, is a Clinton confidante.Two law enforcement sources familiar with the FBI‚Äôs New York Field Office, which initially discovered the emails, said a faction of investigators based in the office is known to be hostile to Hillary Clinton. A spokeswoman for the FBI‚Äôs New York office said she had no knowledge about this.Democratic Party sources said such a faction was likely responsible for a recent surge in media leaks on alleged details of an ongoing FBI investigation of the Clinton Foundation.The lasting scandal to come out of the 2016 election might be the FBI, not Hillary Clinton‚Äôs emails. It is clear that there is something amiss in the bureau. If Democrats win control of the Senate on Tuesday, it is almost certain that they will launch an investigation into the FBI‚Äôs investigation of Clinton.FBI agents could be violating the law in an attempt to use their public sector jobs to interfere in a presidential election. What the anti-Clinton faction of the FBI is engaging in is a threat to US democracy.A group of FBI agents who are hostile to Hillary Clinton are trying to undermine a presidential election. That sentence reads like the plot to a Hollywood blockbuster, but that is what appears to be happening in real life in the final days of a presidential campaign.These FBI Agents were working with Rudy Giuliani to help Trump.  Agents who are Anti-Hillary are working with the Trump Campaign, Breitbart‚Äôs Bannon and a couple of others within the Trump Campaign.  Their Campaign knew in advance, that Comey was going to issue the Email to the GOP.  The GOP got it first, then it was passed on the Democrats.  There is also talk about emails being synched into Antony Weiner‚Äôs Emails, by the FBI and a proper Warrant, was not obtained?Should Hillary Clinton win the presidency, she may end up doing so by overcoming more obstacles than any other presidential candidate in US history.Clinton Foundation:  Trump and Fox News are Saying Clinton "Likely" to be Indicted.  This is a False and Ill Informed, Inaccurate and Without Merit.  Fox News has walked back their claims.Nor, is the Anthony Weiner investigation, ‚ÄúLikely‚Äù to lead to an indictment against Hillary Clinton.Comey is being Investigated for interfering with the Election.  ‚ÄúHatch Act‚ÄùRudy Giuliani is also under investigation for leaking information to the Trump Campaign.Democrats now have all the motivation that they will ever need to get out and vote.STOP THE RIGHT-WING, ALT-RIGHT MADNESS DEMOCRATS!  REJECT AND DEFEAT TRUMP AND THE GOP.  VOTE BLUE UP AND DOWN THE BALLOT!!!IF YOU CARE, SHARE!

For those who can read and want to take the time to learn and vote intelligently, these are just some of the many sources out there. I am sure nay sayers also refute the information and evidence on all the thousands of released Wikileaks emails and will refute any findings of the FBI's two investigations.
