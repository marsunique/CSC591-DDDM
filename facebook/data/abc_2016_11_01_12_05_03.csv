When i got home,i explained to my dad what i did and he beat the crap out of me. But the next day,when my dad woke up and opened the door,outside my house was a brand new car. We all cried especially me,because the car was from the electricity company,they were there to cut off the electricity, my dad beat the crap out of me again

3 | Rudy Quanson | 4 | 10154966178308812_10154966195323812 | I firmly believe that this is a resurgence of the Holy Wars. Many religous leaders from both sides agree with me. There is also the masons involved. Why would some western elites support ISIS?? If you believe in the Masons, then u will know that their founder was Solomon a known hater of God. Maybe I am wrong...maybe not.

1 | Victoria Josey | 0 | 10154966151878812_10154966211533812 | I'm sorry but I'm so against the law that says cops can ask you to leave your car for a simple traffic violation. Stating there reason for doing so is because they don't feel safe. That's BS it's time for that law to change ASAP.  Cops are causing more problems for themselves then necessary, just give people the ticket and let them go home.

Donald J. Trump’s deputy campaign manager says "there's an enthusiasm gap" for Hillary Clinton voters, and expressed confidence that his candidate will win the election as a result of it.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Sylvia Brown Smith | 118 | 10154965992998812_10154966018253812 | Why is it so hard to believe that Trump draws larger crowds, simply because people want to SEE him in person. Crowds do not equate to votes. I'm willing to bet that a good portion of those at these rallies, aren't even registered.
2 | Jill Reynolds | 33 | 10154965992998812_10154966071443812 | Wrong!  We are very enthusiastic! Just not loud,rude and crude spewing hate and intolerance. I guess we are not good reality TV but we are amazing human beings. And we VOTE!
3 | Cass Crowley | 33 | 10154965992998812_10154966029613812 | I think this whole Hillary's-email thing is a ploy (among many) to make people think Trump has a chance to win the election. But it's not going to happen. But only time will reveal the outcome. And very soon...
4 | Cody Carter | 54 | 10154965992998812_10154966001593812 | Tim Kaine(Hillary's VP) gets 30 people at his Florida rally. Bill Clinton yesterday held a campaign speech on youtube/facebook livestream that had a total of 49 viewers. On the other hand, TRUMP held a rally yesterday that had over 15k supporters in physical attendance, and had 150k+ streaming on the internet... Which person has the enthusiasm?

6 | Karen Morris Leupold | 14 | 10154965992998812_10154966023098812 | Wow, ABC (George Stephanopolous) your bias in favor of Hillary really showed this morning! I thought real journalists were supposed to remain neutral. Can you just try to stop pushing Hillary as this country's only hope? How much is she paying you?!? Please don't think that your viewers who don't support her are ignorant. If you continue pushing this propaganda, you will lose viewers!
7 | Tamara N. Green | 7 | 10154965992998812_10154966075408812 | Drawing a crowd doesn't mean he's the favorite. People are enamored by his idiocy and they love to be entertained. That doesn't mean he'll win or that he should win.I wanted Bernie to win. 😦
8 | Vickie Sanders | 12 | 10154965992998812_10154966045868812 | It appears to me that most of Hillarys supporters are young and possess an entitlement personality. It's sad really what these young Americans are doing to themselves and they don't even understand the ramifications of their actions.
9 | Linda Kleinschmidt | 3 | 10154965992998812_10154966112183812 | I can't believe I heard the words "Hope, growth and opportunity" in his statement. Hope for what? Hatred and fear mongering? Growth for who? Big business and the wealthy? Opportunity for who? Certainly not the working class.
10 | Verdell Strong | 5 | 10154965992998812_10154966045468812 | Trump may get large audience but the Electoral Map looks pitiful for Trump right now with 6 days left to go. Hillary looks good on the electoral map, if all the Lean blue states hold up Hillary wins. All she would need is 1 swing states to win. Www.realclearpolitics.com check the map
11 | Bren Baker | 5 | 10154965992998812_10154966111923812 | I have never seen the Dem party so united and ready for a candidate. I'm not sure what he is seeing of than delusions. #Hillary2016 #imwithher #ivotedblue and could not be more proud.
12 | Jack Carrenard | 7 | 10154965992998812_10154966026603812 | Director Comey is in cahoots with House Republicans to undermine the electoral process. The real question should be What did the Director know? And when did he know it? It turns out that the FBI knew for weeks about this new batch of emails. Comey waited until now to release the news so as to inflict as much damage to the Clinton campaign as possible. When told by his subordinates about deep ties between the Russian Security Services and the Trump campaign, he refuses to publicize it for fear of hurting Trump's chances. DOUBLE STANDARD.

16 | Tony Clement | 1 | 10154965992998812_10154966105648812 | Yeah that's it Sylvia.....the fact that Trump regularly draws 20-30 thousand versus Hillarys dozens doesn't equal more votes. Ha ha ha!!!!!! Why, one would have to be crazy to think that means more energy, enthusiasm, passion, commitment, perseverance and thus more votes. Yeah, that's it - it's just to "see" Trump. Yeah, those people don't vote. Ha ha ha ha!!!!
17 | Greg Pellett | 2 | 10154965992998812_10154966141848812 | I have thought all along that Trump will win .Trump's supporters will all vote.The Blacks and Hispanics (although vocal) will not turn out to vote for  Clinton as they claim.
18 | Jessica Ibarra | 0 | 10154965992998812_10154966297663812 | Trump and his supporters are so funny already claiming victory they look clueless its almost sad 😅😅 they always blame the media when the pole numbers show Clinton ahead of him n call the media corrupt and now that the media showing trump ahead by 2 huge points 😅😅 now the media ain't that corrupt huh lmao 😂
19 | Kai Jones | 5 | 10154965992998812_10154966022668812 | I laugh at how you praise Eric Snowden for letting the public know information the Government was keeping from them yet condemn Hilary Clinton for information that could have gotten out but didn't.
20 | Debbie Dillon | 0 | 10154965992998812_10154966303338812 | I highly doubt that Trump will ever be in the White House maybe the jail house after all the corruption that has been uncovered as a result of his run for the white house! And nothing would make me happier!
21 | Franky Ramirez | 8 | 10154965992998812_10154966005858812 | I still have Hillary winning, but I don't think her supporters are enthusiastic. After recent developments they are reminded, once again, that Hillary brings baggage. And I don't think they are comfortable saying that they support a woman who is under FBI investigation. And the funny part? The top ten FBI most wanted consist of men. So yeah, Hillary might break a record: become the first woman on the FBI wanted list. 😂
22 | Lana Mary | 11 | 10154965992998812_10154966015483812 | This guy is the biggest scumbag. Rachel Maddow did a great story on who he is. He basically hates the Clintons and has been hunting them for years. !
23 | Anthony Castellano | 9 | 10154965992998812_10154966002288812 | I don't see how you can be enthusiastic about a candidate that the billionaires, banksters, Wall Street, mega corporations and elites wanted from day one.
24 | Lindsay Arnold Hadley | 3 | 10154965992998812_10154966120033812 | There are many of democrats & independents that don't like what Clinton's campaign stands for. It's got ugly and will set a bad course for the future. Trump has welcomed these voters to join him to make sure our country & citizens are represented. I will vote for him, and millions will too.
25 | Kimberly Ann | 4 | 10154965992998812_10154966125408812 | Yes because he cheated, Trump got the emails stirred up so he could win. Comey called him first before he announced it. But they won't announce an investigation in to his ties with Russia. Trump is the biggest cheater and I hope he puts US in the biggest mess they ever seen! This tyrant is not fit to run a country, let alone his businesses. He belongs in jail for rape and racketeering

Comedian Bill Cosby arrived this morning at a Pennsylvania court for a key pretrial hearing involving his criminal sexual assault case.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Cody Carter | 49 | 10154965935163812_10154965936918812 | Fast Forward 5 years and Bill Cosby will be replaced with Bill Clinton
2 | Karen Micco | 13 | 10154965935163812_10154966008978812 | I'd love to see all 13 of Trump's rapes justified especially the 13 year old! Trump was right when he said republicans are stupid! I can tell them anything and the'll believe it! Fact check what you say if you know how! Congrats you proved Trump right!
3 | Albert Leonard Jr | 20 | 10154965935163812_10154965951413812 | When are they going to bring Donald Trump up on sexual assault charges to.
4 | Amibeth Maguigan-Jean Pierre | 2 | 10154965935163812_10154966073583812 | The statue of limitations has ran out on most of the cases, and since evidence is not available since non did a rape kit or reported at the time non were able to be done. These cases are he say, she say which in a court won't be enough to convict him. I know it sounds bad but if anyone can claim rape without a single piece of evidence that would be a crime. No one person should have any power over another regardless of what. I do find it very strange that many claim that they had no ideal that a substance of any kind was being used and that non of them were OK with having a sexual relationship with him. But still there should be at least physical evidence of some kind that a crime was committed.
5 | Pete Leclair | 5 | 10154965935163812_10154966033293812 | Not so funny now Ehhh? ???He tries to get it tossed proclaiming blindness. What a joke.  This man is a rape hound and is using every excuse in the book to try and quell the issue.

How come nobody is calling these women liars and all I see people say is what a monster Cosby is, but Donald Trump is somehow a saint? Everyone talks about these two men differently and it's really grinding my gears, lmao.. but nah, go ahead and vote him in, 'Murica. He was correct in saying Republicans are easy to fool. He has you all fooled.

12 | David Leit | 1 | 10154965935163812_10154966190658812 | Trump should be standing next to him. Orange is the new black.

Katie Johnson suffered four of these encounters with Donald Trump, but the last was the most horrific. ‘Defendant Trump initiated sexual contact with Plaintiff at 4 different parties. On the 4th & final sexual encounter with Defendant Trump, Defendant Trump tied Plaintiff to a bed, exposed himself to Plaintiff, & proceeded to forcibly rape Plaintiff. During the course of this savage sexual attack, Plaintiff loudly pleaded with Defendant Trump to stop but with no effect. Defendant Trump responded to Plaintiff’s pleas by violently striking Plaintiff in the face with his open hand &  screaming that he would do whatever he wanted.’And then, Epstein had a fit after he found out that Trump “took” the aspiring model’s virginity first, & took his anger out on her. ‘Defendant Epstein had sexual contact with Plaintiff at 2 of the parties. The 2nd sexual encounter with Defendant Epstein took place after Plaintiff had been raped by Defendant Trump. Defendant Epstein forced himself upon Plaintiff & proceeded to rape her anally & vaginally despite her loud pleas to stop. Defendant Epstein then attempted to strike Plaintiff about the head with his closed fists while he angrily screamed at Plaintiff that he, Defendant Epstein, rather than Defendant Trump, should have been the one who took Plaintiff’s virginity, before Plaintiff finally managed to break away from Defendant Epstein.’Both men repeatedly threatened Katie Johnson that they’d kill or harm her and her family if she told anyone anything. https://www.scribd.com/doc/316341058/Donald-Trump-Jeffrey-Epstein-Rape-Lawsuit-and-Affidavits#fullscreen&from_embedTrump could be brought down by his 'terrific longtime friend', convicted pedophile, Jeffrey Epsteinhttp://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/06/30/the-billionaire-pedophile-who-could-bring-down-donald-trump-and-hillary-clinton.htmlTrump has been accused of rape or attempted rape on multiple occasions http://fusion.net/story/328522/donald-trump-accused-rape-sexual-assault/Trump is furious that his rape lawsuit has been re-filed with a new witnesshttp://winningdemocrats.com/just-in-lawsuit-claiming-trump-raped-a-13-year-old-girl-refiled-after-new-witness-steps-forward/Trump is scared when the Judge orders the immediate start of his child rape case in NYhttp://bipartisanreport.com/2016/10/07/breaking-judge-orders-immediate-start-to-trump-child-rape-case-details/Trump panics when the trial Judge sets a trial date (Dec 16th) for his child rape case http://bipartisanreport.com/2016/10/12/breaking-trump-panics-after-judge-sets-december-start-for-teen-rape-case-details/Trump must testify in person at his upcoming child rape case Dec. 16th http://occupydemocrats.com/2016/10/13/trump-testify-oath-upcoming-child-rape-case/REMINDER: Reminder: Trump due in court after Election Day on child rape & fraud/racketeering chargesTrump would like voters to focus on the FBI’s continuing investigation of Hillary Clinton’s email server.

An adult and two children have died after a trailer carrying trick-or-treaters crashed into another vehicle in Mississippi.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Jessica Millikin-Newcomb | 34 | 10154965872068812_10154965931008812 | This is a 2-lane country road in a rural area. Its not the 8 lane interstate most people are imagining. You don't trick or treat on foot in this area, as houses can be a good 10-20 minute walk apart. Hayrides and jeeps and tractors are common means of transport for the holiday  and the fault was that of the driver who rearended the trailer. Not that any of that matters right now.
2 | Kathleen Swinehart | 4 | 10154965872068812_10154965926773812 | Even in the rural areas it shouldn't be done my street has no parking on one side yet people stop right in the middle of the lane and let their kids out to trick or treat with traffic coming from behind and nowhere for this traffic to go because there's cars coming the other way. They just stop and think it's okay to stop there and let their kids out and wait for them right in the middle of their Lane all over a quarter piece of candy
3 | Jeff Bowerman | 6 | 10154965872068812_10154965882308812 | Whoever was driving the Jeep that was pulling the trailer, the parents of the children, and any other adult there, need to be arrested and charged. They are the ones who put those kids ate risk by letting them ride on a trailer, no seat belts, no protection.
4 | Jo Thomas | 0 | 10154965872068812_10154966277018812 | People have been having hayrides as long as I can remember and this is the first time I've ever heard of this happening. A group on a hayride came through in front of our house last night. They did,  however, have a car following with their blinkers on. That was a first for me, but very smart.
5 | Kevin Slagle | 3 | 10154965872068812_10154965888903812 | We've done this in small neighborhoods, but this looks like a real highway. Terrible tragedy but not a good place for a trailer of kids.
6 | Robert Vela | 2 | 10154965872068812_10154965904848812 | that's an f150 on that flatbed but besides the point. why is a trailer with kids on a highway? I can see down residential streets but not driving on a highway. poor decision.
7 | Richard Fink | 3 | 10154965872068812_10154965910913812 | What the hell were the parents thinking? This is a tragedy that could've been avoided.
8 | Bryan Withers | 1 | 10154965872068812_10154966012268812 | It is easy at a time like this to point fingers and assign blame. This is not the time however. I have been in public service of some kind all my adult life and at a time like this we need to pray for all involved.
9 | Joan Carlton | 3 | 10154965872068812_10154965912693812 | It's a crime to have had those poor kids on a trailer on a freeway. Awful!!!!
10 | Eyam Ova-Urazis | 2 | 10154965872068812_10154965935893812 | There's no mention of whether or not the trailer had operational lights.
11 | Bonnie Delano | 0 | 10154965872068812_10154966246363812 | No one has mentioned if the trailer lights were on, on the rear of the trailer. That would be an important factor.

1 | Sarah Lynn Fogelstrom | 4 | 10154965822533812_10154965826293812 | My morning thoughts... I woke up this morning and turned on the TV. Flipped though every single news channel including FOX and all they are talking about is whether or not Comey "broke" some kind of law because of the now continuing investigation on Weiners and Abedins computer and phones regarding the criminal Hillary. The media is so low they are going after Comey for bringing up new evidence found as he told Congress he would do? Seriously? It's about time he did his job the right way. Bill and the AG never should have met on that Arizona tarmac....any decent lawyer would tell you that. It was in truly BAD FORM and It broke the trust of American people and the DOJ(not that we trusted her anyway). Hillary made her bed with this situation when SHE decided to break the law and hide National Security info in an ILLEGAL private server hidden in her bathroom. SHE decided to use MULTIPLE devices and then lie about it. She DECIDED to ignore subpeonas, SHE decided to hide evidence and then destroy more. SHE lied to Congress and the American people and continues to do so. Comey SHOULD have at least called a Grand Jury back in July for all the laws she broke, some of which I'm sure I forgot to include here. The issue isn't Comey's timing with new evidence. The people should know BEFORE the election what is going on with this new evidence. How many people may have voted differently in the early voting had this info been out sooner?. Clinton and only Clinton should be held responsible......I wish for many things in this... most importantly her indictment....but I also wish I had Anthony Weiner's address to send him a Thank You card for being such a lowlife pig....maybe I should TEXT it to him.

Hillary Clinton’s campaign manager calls FBI Director James Comey's letter to congressional leaders regarding the emails of a top Clinton associate a "break in protocol."
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Scott Wyatt | 231 | 10154965722038812_10154965743243812 | The Clinton campaign doesn't want the voters to be informed about her corruption. It has been on display for years, but it seems like people are starting to open their eyes.
2 | Kimberly Doty-Dwyer | 145 | 10154965722038812_10154965755843812 | Oh and using a private server wasn't breaking protocol, Bill Clinton and attorney general meeting was protocol. The money donated to the Clinton Foundation for favors is protocol. The people have the right to km now the truth before throwing our votes away. That's proper protocol. I'm tired of these jerks sweeping crap under the carpet.
3 | John Krum | 92 | 10154965722038812_10154965740798812 | Don't vote for lying, corrupt, career politicians like ole Hillary Clinton. Just think vote for her, she spends the next four years in prison!
4 | Kim Marie | 90 | 10154965722038812_10154965727418812 | If you don't want the FBI involved in elections, don't nominate someone being investigated by the FBI.
5 | Ben Derrick | 90 | 10154965722038812_10154965722983812 | As a blackman, I fully support Donald Trump for President! Trump looks so professional and Presidential!!! Hillary Clinton to go away when defeated on election day! Hillary Clinton to be put to shame & jailed; never to show her face again! TRUMP 2016!!!!!! I cannot WAIT until you take office!!!!! I wish it was tomorrow. The only Endorsements Trump needs is......We The People!#MakeAmericaGreatAgain
6 | Trey O'Rourke | 46 | 10154965722038812_10154965762408812 | "FBI Director broke protocol," Clinton campaign manager. Um, no he didn't! He broke ranks. Hillary thought that she paid the FBI Director, Jim Comey, enough money to be quiet and sweep stuff under the carpet. Hillary thought that Former President Bill Clinton made enough of an impression on the Attorney General, Loretta Lynch, that Director Comey would see the light and follow through. Maybe, Comey grew a heart and soul . . . and, as a result, now he feels that Hillary should have been prosecuted from the very beginning.
7 | Ellen Paulus Hill | 22 | 10154965722038812_10154965794803812 | The most hypocritical group in history . . . it's against the LAW to delete government documents, especially after you are under subpoena!  If no documents had been deleted and HRC had been honest, NONE of this would be happening, though she would probably be in jail for having top secret and classified documents on her private server.
8 | Bill Keegan | 16 | 10154965722038812_10154965818808812 | A break in protocol is having classified info on unclass "home brew" server, deleting 33k+ emails after subpoena, "misleading" the people about the truth, having all of your staff plead the 5th, and saying "I don't recall" 100+ when questioned, for starters - that is a break in protocol for a Gov't official.
9 | Billy Mirenberg | 24 | 10154965722038812_10154965761088812 | Didn't the break in protocol occur when Hillary left 4 Americans to die in Libya and then lied about? Her list of lies is seemingly endless with each tale representing amother break in protocol.
10 | Jim Barbato | 11 | 10154965722038812_10154965869318812 | Protocol? Does Hillary even know what that word means. She absolutely broke protocol when she created a private email server and routed classified material to it. Clinton is done! #TrumpPresident
11 | Glenn Keane | 6 | 10154965722038812_10154965862703812 | Did anyone ever think that maybe, just maybe this new evidence of emails regarding Huma and Weiners laptop was actually discovered by the New York police working on the sexting scandal and not the FBI as the Dems are screaming?  And, maybe that once these were found that if the FBI/DOJ was trying to delay the release of this new information that maybe, just maybe there was a potential coup among the New York authorities that said something to the effect that if the information was not going to be announced that there would have potentially been a leak to the public, thereby causing even more issues for the FBI?  Just a thought.
12 | Calvin Anderson | 6 | 10154965722038812_10154965752403812 | You did the right thing the FBI director is investigating Donald Trump's ties to Russia if you was to talk about Hillary Clinton's investigation he should have talked about Donald Trump's also so the FBI director is trying to change the election FBI director is working with the Republican committee to change the outcome of the election
13 | Lee Distefano | 6 | 10154965722038812_10154965789843812 | FBI Director did not broke any rules, they did the right thing to inform what is reality, Clinton campaign does not want anyone to know the truth and how much corrupted she is
14 | Bart Pearston | 8 | 10154965722038812_10154965789538812 | But a Secretary of State keeping a private unsecured server with thousands of Emails on it at her home ISN'T? 113 of which contained classified information and three were marked as such.  Do these Liberal morons realize how dumb they sound? "Of the tens of thousands of emails investigators reviewed, 113 contained classified information, and three of those had classification markers. FBI Director James Comey has said Clinton should have known that some of the 113 were classified, but others she might have understandably missed." (According to politifact). http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/jul/19/politifact-sheet-hillary-clintons-email-controvers/

17 | Debra Oliva | 2 | 10154965722038812_10154965865718812 | Well, there was an October surprise from the FBI for Nixon in 1972 and he still won the election. Of course, we all know what happened afterwards.http://watergate.info/chronology/brief-timeline-of-events
18 | Chris Marchetti | 2 | 10154965722038812_10154965933058812 | is it me or does it seem ironic that all these supporters are crying foul saying he broke protocol and action should be taken against him. Are they forgetting what it is that she's under investigation for? Oh thats right breaking protocol lol.
19 | Sonia A Salazar Mendoza | 2 | 10154965722038812_10154965946983812 | She broke protocol first with all the lies and email she deleted, and the info she shared on a public server when they were supposed to be classified, so no it was about time for the FBI to do something to shake her ground, she shouldn't have run for President in the first place.
20 | Matthew Nielsen | 1 | 10154965722038812_10154965990893812 | Funny, it wasn't a breach of protocol exactly two years ago when the FBI announced a BS investigation of Mike Rounds who was running for Congress at the time.  The fact is the way these emails reared their ugly head the FBI couldn't sweep them under the rug as was done earlier this year.
21 | Jennifer Van Gorder | 3 | 10154965722038812_10154965834808812 | Hillary's rogue email was against protocol and had she not done it and had she turned over all of her emails instead of obstructing justice NONE OF THIS WOULD BE GOING ON
22 | Jimmy Torrez | 0 | 10154965722038812_10154966305113812 | There is a double standard, anyone who handled classified information so carelessly then destroyed evidence in the face of a subpoena would be in jail. You don't have to vote for the lesser of two evil, vote for someone with integrity. Vote Gary Johnson
23 | Gregory Epler | 1 | 10154965722038812_10154966110398812 | Republican congressmen have co-opted the FBI Director into being an agent to dig up 'dirt' on their opposition, this whole spectacle is obscene and stunning that the press isn't calling out the GOP on this blatant disregard for the way a modern democracy works . . .
24 | Regina Schuester | 1 | 10154965722038812_10154965870788812 | If the woman was unaware of the rules & regulations of how to manage emails as Secretary of State, how can we trust her to have enough smarts to manage the 3 second end of the world nuke button?  Geeze - she might be above the law, but come on - how much dumber can she be by creating this unnecessary mess? Not the brightest light bulb in the messy bunch!  What other stupid messes does she have in her toolbox?
25 | Leah Parrish Kilbreath | 0 | 10154965722038812_10154965951478812 | The DNC and the Clintons have broken the law, not just protocol but the law over and over again, broken the trust of the American people and are trying to destroy our voting system by causing violence, voter fraud, rigging the machines and selling out our country to Finance themselves and their campaign. So they just need to shut up and take what they got coming.

4-year-old Norah's best friend is an 82-year-old recent widower named Daniel, affectionately known as Mr. Dan, and she refuses to let him be lonely, especially on Halloween. “They hugged and they acted like they’ve known each other forever."

2 | Kristina Trivett | 98 | 10154965504743812_10154965509168812 | I read this story yesterday, this little lady has a heart of gold and hope the world and life never change that!!
3 | Beth Thompson | 44 | 10154965504743812_10154965553753812 | So sweet.  Every young, vibrant child needs a good grandparent (old &wise person) in their life....and vice versa.
4 | Christina Loveless | 38 | 10154965504743812_10154965564378812 | I'm sure their souls knew each other in another life time. So cute.
5 | Brandi Lee Moss | 23 | 10154965504743812_10154965647293812 | So cute!!!!!😍😍😍 I cried when I read the first story and I am so happy that she still sees him. God bless that little girl and her mother for helping a man in need
6 | Nickole Noble | 10 | 10154965504743812_10154965782738812 | Oh this little girl!!!!! "Hi old person today is my birfday" he was so sweet and kind to her!!! We need more Mr. Dan's in our lives!!!!
7 | Melissa Welty | 2 | 10154965504743812_10154966098143812 | The very old and the very young often get along well. For some patients in the nursing home there was no response to stimuli until you place a child in their lap, then they come alive. It seems to be an inborn response to a helpless child that people have. I've seen patients with dementia reach for the baby and go into 'mommy mode'. Men will pat the child's head and usually attempt to teach the child something. It's innate.
8 | Michael Garrone | 0 | 10154965504743812_10154966097103812 | Kids are great. Nothing but pure love and trust. Then this wicked world gets hold of them. Some day, if I'm lucky, my best friend will be a little girl like her.
9 | Joshua Workman | 0 | 10154965504743812_10154966168688812 | That young girl found a Winner there! She's thinking "now there's someone wise to learn from! Hallaween and treats or this old man who loves me?" she picks love over trick me, or treat me!

15 | Krystal Crawley | 3 | 10154965504743812_10154965761223812 | Kids are a lot wiser than we give them credit for. She felt his spirit and knew he needed something to uplift him
16 | Russell Parker | 7 | 10154965504743812_10154965519673812 | Cute story. Now something relevant. What you have to ask yourself: Why did Hillary accept the questions? Why didn't she expose the rigging? Why did she instead work hard to make her debate responses look unrehearsed? What does this say about her character? How could we possibly elect a president this unethical?
17 | Marion Nichols | 6 | 10154965504743812_10154965676958812 | Such a beautiful young lady, and what a lovely family befriending this man and helping heal. We need more like this in the world today. Xxx💕😊💕😊

NEW: While vote preferences have held essentially steady, Hillary Clinton is now a slim point behind Donald J. Trump—a first since May—in the latest ABC News/Washington Post tracking poll, as strong enthusiasm for Clinton has ebbed since the FBI – Federal Bureau of Investigation’s new review concerning her emails.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Ashlie Watkins | 2221 | 10154965457168812_10154965469393812 | Don't believe the media...Hillary's poll numbers are falling faster than Bill Clinton's pants in an Arkansas trailer park...
2 | Dan Carey | 1334 | 10154965457168812_10154965481988812 | Remember when Trump was laughed at for saying Hillary had the questions ahead of time? Remember when he said Weiner had access to Hillary's classified emails? Remember when he said Hillary cheated Bernie out of the nomination BEFORE wikileaks confirmed it. Trumps been right about everything from the start.
3 | Nelda Modawell Halford | 1502 | 10154965457168812_10154965466578812 | If Trump wins this election this country will never be the same. He will become a dictator and we'll never be able to get him out of office. People need to stop and think what a deplorable person he is...on so many fronts!
4 | Michael Munkittrick | 696 | 10154965457168812_10154965464253812 | If this country should careen off the rails and Donald Trump gets elected, we are no longer the nation of our fathers. We are the willing puppets of a man with almost zero value, both financially and morally. Let's all hope for the best and elect someone's dog. He may do nothing at all, but at least I can trust a dog to never lie to me.
5 | Scott Jaeger | 372 | 10154965457168812_10154965471868812 | President Trump in one week! It's important that everybody go out & vote. We need to get rid of career politicians. The media has to change too.
6 | Jcarlos Torres | 442 | 10154965457168812_10154965504608812 | Donald Trump, the King of Bankruptcy, professional conman, draft dodger, tax cheat and sexual predator is a psychotic self-absorbed narcissist. His style of hate-mongering politics makes America look like a third world country. The fact that he is even being considered for president is shameful.
7 | Blakeney Adams | 267 | 10154965457168812_10154965472873812 | Stop and think of this people, Hillary Clinton is just one member of the Democratic Party elite that's been caught. Makes me wonder just how deep the corruption goes in the Democratic Party.

9 | Thom H. Pean Sr | 148 | 10154965457168812_10154965485443812 | Please people do not vote for Hillary Clinton. She is a liar , a thief, and a person who is more than willing to sacrifice the lives of your children to advance her own personal agenda. She is guilty of murder, and lying to the FBI, and more importantly, to the American people.
10 | Richard Jackson | 139 | 10154965457168812_10154965471128812 | This whole email issue bullsheet is just that. I've been an admin of non classified email servers that classified email traversed, several different incidents. No big investigations done, no one ever prosecuted. That is normal, that is the standard. We have further backing of this because neither Colin Powell and Condi Rice were prosecuted for the same actions. Both sent and received classified email over private servers. Nor was there any investigation for the over 22,000,000 missing emails from the Bush White House email servers.Nothing will prove out in the Weiner emails either I'm sure. 45 years the GOP have been after Hillary and for 45 years they have cleared her themselves...and here we are with them still grasping at straws because they've never had the evidence backing up their charges.EVERElse, we'd not be here 45 years after she sat on the Nixon Impeachment committee and the GOP still has nothing, stilll grasping for straws having only words to bandy about and no evidence backing their rhetoric up...if they did have evidence their words wouldn't be rhetoric.
11 | Debbie Beer | 53 | 10154965457168812_683701738450404 | I'm flabbergasted that millions of people are willing to vote for the racist, misogynistic, small-minded, violence-inducing, terrorist Donald Trump. If you don't want Hillary, vote for anyone other than Trump. The world cannot tolerate such an inhumane leader, and he will leave a trail of chaos that will take decades to heal.
12 | Jared Taylor | 51 | 10154965457168812_10154965466953812 | Let this lead continue continue until he gets the electoral vote for this election. She needs to be behind bars. Should've been the first time but I think someone was paid off to not charge her and Bill Clinton should be looked into for his rape of those women years ago bc that happened (Trump never did)
13 | Andrew Meyer | 27 | 10154965457168812_683687395118505 | Get past the headlines, they're burying the lead here. If you read into the article about halfway down they finally get to the point that the poll shows " In blue states (with 278 electoral votes), Clinton leads 54-37 percent." Once you hit 270 it's game over.
14 | Gary Zoppo | 17 | 10154965457168812_858339110968408 | Ten reasons to vote Democrat #10. I vote Democrat because I love the fact that I can now marry whatever I want. I've decided to marry my German Shepherd. #9. I vote Democrat because I believe oil companies' profits of 4% on a gallon of gas are obscene, but the government taxing the same gallon at 15% isn't. #8. I vote Democrat because I believe the government will do a better job of spending the money I earn than I would. #7. I vote Democrat because Freedom of Speech is fine as long as nobody is offended by it. #6. I vote Democrat because I'm way too irresponsible to own a gun, and I know that my local police are all I need to protect me from murderers and thieves. I am also thankful that we have a 911 service that gets police to your home in order to identify your body after a home invasion. #5. I vote Democrat because I'm not concerned about millions of babies being aborted so long as we keep all death row inmates alive and comfy. #4. I vote Democrat because I think illegal aliens have a right to free health care, education, and Social Security benefits, and we should take away Social Security from those who paid into it. #3. I vote Democrat because I believe that businesses should not be allowed to make profits for themselves. They need to break even and give the rest away to the government for redistribution as the Democrat Party sees fit. #2. I vote Democrat because I believe liberal judges need to rewrite the Constitution every few days to suit fringe kooks who would never get their agendas past the voters. And, the #1 reason I vote Democrat is because I think it's better to pay $billions$ for oil to people who hate us, but not drill our own because it might upset some endangered beetle, gopher, or fish here in America. We don't care about the beetles, gophers, or fish in those other countries. "The difference between genius and stupidity is that genius has its limits". Albert Einstein I know you all will appreciate this definition. The best description of Obamacare so far:  Remember when Nancy Pelosi said: "We have to pass it, to find out what's in it." A physician called into a radio show and said: "That's the definition of a stool sample."
15 | Stella Collins | 26 | 10154965457168812_10154965543023812 | Look how these Trumpsters are behaving. It's like their possessed with such hate. It's almost like Trump is leading a cult. If the Orange man wins the four years he's in office this Country will be destroyed by Trump and Putin.. Mark my words. I'm not going to argue anymore with people I'm just going to sit back and watch everybody supporting this man-child eat their words.
16 | Joy Ward | 24 | 10154965457168812_10154965501908812 | For a nation that cries our elections are bought want to vote a billionaire in office..... smh.... trump is being hailed as "smart" for taking advantage of our system flaws and loopholes..... and yet the people think he's going to fix the laws that he takes advantage of!?He's lowering your taxes to buy your vote and giving bigger tax breaks to wealthy more than bush did? We all know where that got us!!!
17 | Kimberly L Dyar-Day | 12 | 10154965457168812_683684525118792 | Hillary is a joke. She's been in office for thirty years doing nothing notably wonderful. Being in another four years won't change that. Yes she is under investigation again because Trey Gowdy wants the truth unlike many other people. Getting told the truth upsets people. Trump has said all of these things nobody believed him, you just thought he was a pissed off man. Hillary isn't capable of taking a dog for a walk let alone run a country. She's a bought lady think how many favors she'll have to return if elected. Trump owes nothing to anyone except the American people.
18 | Loida Velazco | 20 | 10154965457168812_683699858450592 | Think America. Trump is bad news. His words n speeches are so hateful. Please pray that the good Lord will guide this country to choose a President who promotes unity. Do not be misled by Trump's lies n dirty tricks just to get your vote. He is not safe for this country. He is Russian inspired.
19 | Sarah Fortin | 30 | 10154965457168812_10154965475473812 | But yet trump don't have to show his taxes wtf is wrong with these racist hating fucksticks they'd rather have someone who's against women in office than keep their medical or benefits they're receiving like food or social security
20 | Maria Costello | 35 | 10154965457168812_10154965479148812 | This poll is bogus. The number keeps changing by 1 point everyday. At this rate Trump will be up by 8 on Tuesday while every other national poll has her leading
21 | Brian Logue | 8 | 10154965457168812_683732988447279 | No wander people are so scared of trump. Corrupt politicians are scared the exit of the swamp is jail. People who are riding the welfare system that are able will have to work....this country will be great again!!!!! Drain that damn swamp!!!!!!
22 | Holly Melton | 8 | 10154965457168812_858338767635109 | Lol! It is way too funny (not really) how all the Hillary supporters are calling Trump a deplorable, saying he is immoral, a sexual predator, etc., yet Hillary has defended the rapist of a young girl, had many of those who opposed her murdered, stolen from the White House, committed treason, left our soldiers to die, declared that it is perfectly fine to murder an unborn child, and so much more! Not to mention, for all you super extreme feminists who are so against Trump because of his statements toward women, Hillary practically destroyed the women that came forward and outed Bill for rape and inappropriate behavior. News Flash!! We do not need Hillary back in the White House! We, the deplorables, will not allow her back in the White House! It's time to stand up and take this country back from the government. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #TrumpPence2016 #CallingAllDeplorables #VoteUSA #HillaryForPRISON
23 | Jamie Gulin | 24 | 10154965457168812_10154965478553812 | Never understood why my grandma spoke of cash under the bed. Just in case. Now I know.
24 | Ahmed Ali | 8 | 10154965457168812_10154965541458812 | To american people when you see media , movie stars , politicians are against Trump that means he is the best choice trust me they have agenda now it is your turn american to prove them wrong and to show the world that not media or celebrities can affect on your choice
25 | John William Hanson | 8 | 10154965457168812_10154965523928812 | The only people that I know voting for Hillary Clinton either are dead or could pretty much be consider legally retarded.  I don't even like using that word but it's the truth! 3rd party is your best option!

Kansas Republican Party criticized over mailers that depict what appears to be ISIS fighters ready to do battle in the state. "Have you met the new neighbors?" the flyer declares.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Scott Nadell | 28 | 10154965438388812_10154965582383812 | Despicable, disgusting and typical toxic behavior of the Kansas Republican Party. Pandering the hate and fear message to would be voters. Dopes who are easily persuaded and manipulated to alter votes.
2 | Connie Martin | 40 | 10154965438388812_10154965454823812 | This is how the seeds of hate are sown. This will never happen. Hillary is one tough cookie and knows what's at stake. Just stop the hate already!
3 | Janet McConnell | 23 | 10154965438388812_10154965607088812 | We don't want ISIS in America! Obama and Hillary started ISIS. The facts speak for themselves. Open borders and funding the enemy! Get a clue!
4 | Anand Nair | 10 | 10154965438388812_10154965650283812 | Whats wrong with it. That's what muslims do when they become majority anywhere. What's wrong with telling the truth as it is? This ABC, CNN, and other left-wing media houses and Hillary get massive propaganda funds from Middle East to support the Islamic cause.
5 | Todd Faugno | 5 | 10154965438388812_10154965634373812 | I don't think their war against western culture is over is it?   I haven't forgotten 9/11. I see nothing wrong with protecting the American people first.  Why bring in a group that would place their religious laws over the constitution?  It's not a good fit. Never killary nor nobama for that fact. https://imprimis.hillsdale.edu/islam-facts-or-dreams/
6 | John Frame | 7 | 10154965438388812_10154965653278812 | This is what is and will happen. It won't be this  public it will be the same coward way they have been killing. If you think this spreads fear you are a coward. It spread understanding of what is to come. Europe tells the story.
7 | Brian Eubanks | 9 | 10154965438388812_10154965459008812 | All of the insults between Americans over this election.We are ready to fight each other over political propaganda. We are falling for the divide and conquer scheme hook, line and sinker. There is no more We the People. and it is sad. Such division. Such animosity and even hate. Repeat after me- if you still remember the words "I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all."
8 | Ronald Hammon | 6 | 10154965438388812_10154965654208812 | Love it, the truth hurts but that's the neighbors OBAMA, CLINTON wants Americans to have , she said I'm going to bring in 100 million Muslim refugees, trump/pence 16-24 god bless America??
9 | Elizabeth Burris-Scott | 0 | 10154965438388812_10154966041258812 | The seeds of hate are already in place , unfortunately! I think it's time to stop being so politically correct, and start using our brains. In 1991 they found documents from a terrorist Related Group stating that they will take us down by infiltrating us from the inside out and that is exactly what they are doing. It is sad, and I am sorry to those of them who are innocent in this matter, however it is my family and the family of my friends and loved ones that I'm worried about far more than hurting someone's feelings.
10 | Mary Anderson | 0 | 10154965438388812_10154966030543812 | It always amazes me when "Christians" call people names like fool or stupid. I am still shocked to see "Christians " advocate hatred of an entire group of people because some are bad. Of Jesus returned today it would be the very "Christians " that would label him a liberal fool and turn him away.
11 | Kenneth Wilson | 1 | 10154965438388812_10154965650088812 | We got nut job of a state Representative that always plays the big bad Muslim card in his campaign. Lots of older folks and cowards around and they get really frightened.
12 | Jerry L. Peck | 2 | 10154965438388812_10154965521938812 | That's what ALL the DEMO's wan. They want a goat humper living next door to everyone. Put your kids up when they move in nextdoor.
13 | Elaine Marie | 8 | 10154965438388812_10154965449108812 | "Hillary Clinton's corruption is on a scale we've never seen before," Trump said at a rally in Manchester, New Hampshire. "We must not let her take her criminal scheme into the Oval Office."

One photographer is helping six women tell their stories of love and loss in a new photo series about the babies they've lost. "You shouldn't feel ashamed to talk about it." http://abcn.ws/2eNL4En
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Susie M. Vecchio | 20 | 10154965262408812_10154965293833812 | The first comments on this post are junk. So annoying. Anyway...I think this is beautiful. Personally, I don't know why women would feel "ashamed to talk about it". Ashamed at the loss I can imagine. I've lost three in miscarriage. My fourth was a horrible trying pregnancy, but my angel was beautiful and healthy the day he came into the world. It's hard thinking about what could've been. Even now, I think about the babies I lost and could be sharing a life with. I've been ashamed because I felt like it was my fault. I felt like my body failed. Even in my fourth pregnancy, from the begging (8wks) they told me not to get my hopes up. Then at 14 wks, they thought I was miscarrying. At 23 wks, they thought I was going through premature labor. My son was born at exactly 36 wks. 8lbs 11oz, 22"... beautiful baby boy. Pregnancy was horrible. My previous three were horrible as well. They took a toll on my body and my heart. But I was never embarrassed or ashamed to talk about each loss, or what I experienced with each one. Some times this happens to us. But women are strong! We have others like us, we have each other to turn to!!
2 | Betsy Hack | 11 | 10154965262408812_10154965539078812 | I have never felt ashamed I had a beautiful baby I 3/22/98 he was stillborn I had to deliver my sweet angel asleep but when the nurse took him and brought my son to me I held my son I kissed his tiny lifeless hands as tears rolled down my face I told my sleeping angel I will always be your mother and I will love you for all eternity every year me and my daughters say a prayer on his birthday and always remember him during Christmas as my youngest daughter hangs a Christmas stocking for the brother she never met and she hangs a beautiful Christmas oranament of an Angel doves with wings and a crystal heart hanging in the month every year letting everyone know her brother's dove's is on the tree and he is here in spirit my son Terell De Andre would have been eighteen years old  but I truly take comfort knowing my son is with God in his heavenly loving kingdom
3 | Cara Sherris | 1 | 10154965262408812_10154965909248812 | Miscarriages are not taboo...they should be openly talked about...if the family chooses. Ive never understood the waiting to tell, if I tell you I care about you therefore know you care for me so will be there for me through trials and tribulations..no? I have had three miscarriages 2 late in term and life long impacts but I feel the compassion for other mothers having gone through that and can share the horrors of guilt, shame, anger, pain, sadness,emptiness and maybe just maybe they will take away some feeling of it happens for no good or a very good reason. But its okay to be upset and its ok to be ok about it and move forward as well. People being there for people...but its hard if you feel you cant express the pain because of whatever reason. Dont hold back you have nothing to apologize for, be upset and let yourself grieve...however suits you.
4 | Tiffany Sinclair | 1 | 10154965262408812_10154965910418812 | This is my first time hearing women are ashamed to talk about it.. My mom never could talk about losing her 3 daughters because of the fact it hurts so much for her. My dad talks about them.. But mom just couldn't because it's just really painful. I think this is wonderful that these ladies are doing this... I am just surprised they'd feel ashamed and anyone would make them feel ashamed... I can't imagine what women go through when they lose a child
5 | Michelle Marie | 1 | 10154965262408812_10154966007068812 | I think it's a painful subject for women to discuss,  but nobody should feel ashamed. Every year I think about my first pregnancy and how old she would be if she were here today (21 yrs. old). ♡
6 | Stephanie Wofford Bordelon | 2 | 10154965262408812_10154966012158812 | You know its sad when you start reading stories that have brought so much pain to these families, then politics are brought up, please have some kind of respect in your heart, I know its there. Also as a mother that lost her son when he was six years old, the pain is sometimes almost unbearable, he was my baby.😢....Sending Love And Prayers To All Of You!

1 | Samantha Palacio | 58 | 10154965056723812_10154965096543812 | I think this is very common but still taboo. Society still makes women feel like not wanting children is shameful but having negative feelings about your baby is horrific. So many women don't open up about it and in some cases it leads to much more damage for the mother and child. I really believe that most people don't really do their homework before having a baby.
2 | Kali Morgan | 62 | 10154965056723812_10154965076593812 | No big deal that she doesn't want more kids. That's her business. A lot of people don't want children or only want one and others want a lot.
3 | Pamela Marcenaro Negron | 25 | 10154965056723812_10154965344108812 | I commend her for speaking up about this. Many, do no realize the seriousness of post partum depression. It is a very dark and lonely place....you need all the support and love you can get.
4 | Mindi Stillings | 27 | 10154965056723812_10154965083533812 | I didn't have ppd but I still don't want more kids. One is enough for me. Everyone can choose what they feel is enough children for them.
5 | Jennifer Nall | 17 | 10154965056723812_10154965096133812 | It's her choice. If that's a good enough reason for her then you need to hush and accept it. Some people don't want to depend on meds. Some people feel like zombies on them. Have some respect.
6 | Eve Richard Johns | 2 | 10154965056723812_10154965837778812 | #Adele: Almost 18 years ago my doctor hinted all my symptoms pointed to postpartum depression and did nothing about it...I personally know that pain and fear...I have only one child because I was and I am too afraid to go through it again.
7 | Kris Taylor | 4 | 10154965056723812_10154965757778812 | I choose not to have more children, I am a single parent. My son also is severely autistic, having more kids I feel like I would have a hard time being available for all my kids since my son needs a lot of attention and assistance. Also some people who have one child who is autistic are more at chance of having another child with autism. I truthfully could not handle that. I give props to the parents who want more kids.
8 | Sachai Horton Thorson | 0 | 10154965056723812_10154965579128812 | I suffered from a mild case of PPD after our son was born. Your hormones are so crazy and you can feel overwhelmed with taking care of the baby and dealing with the chemical imbalance. It is comforting to know there are others that have had or have the same issue. You do not feel as alone.
9 | Dale Gaines | 0 | 10154965056723812_10154966214808812 | It is a very dark place to be. It is so very hard on a Mother especially if one doesn't have to help them through it. The struggle is real!
10 | Stephanie Colon | 1 | 10154965056723812_10154965767838812 | I went through it and still going thru it and i totally understand where she is coming from i dont know if i want a 2nd kid it is definitely a dark place to be in and i am on meds
11 | Jay DeSisto | 3 | 10154965056723812_10154965160098812 | Well, good thing she is a superstar and nannies most likely were more of a parent and Adele didnt drown the kid or cut its arms off or something.
12 | Eden Clarè | 0 | 10154965056723812_10154965479238812 | Yeah, his children will have no aunt, neither uncle. It could be enough for you, but is it enough for your children? I mean one child? Have a nice day.
13 | Char Martin | 2 | 10154965056723812_10154965226823812 | A lot of women go thru this.....does it mean more because it's her.....whys this news.....
14 | Cara Jene Shearouse | 5 | 10154965056723812_10154965435523812 | I wouldn't buy another CD from the Hillary supporter again.
15 | Lisa Grajeda | 1 | 10154965056723812_10154965077473812 | It's only temporary & there is meds for it! No reason to not want more children:(

17 | Diana Miller | 1 | 10154965056723812_10154965177063812 | She is tired and stressed, in addition to the pressures of performance. She would do well to follow her heart, and focus on being the good mother she so desperately wants to be. I applaud her courage in speaking out to help others who are hurting. It speaks to her character, and her passion for her beautiful child. She'll be a wonderful mom!
18 | Kimberly Marin | 0 | 10154965056723812_10154965294983812 | Quite the opposite of the Michael Phelps story ! I can't imagine feeling this way about my children . sad

Federal and state health officials investigating possible cluster of rare nervous system disorder after multiple children reported symptoms, including weakness or loss of movement in one or more limbs.

1 | Kaylee Miley | 47 | 10154964964838812_10154965559238812 | My son suffered from Guillain-Barre Syndrome 2 years ago (he had just turned 3). We stayed at Texas Children Hospital for almost 5 months. Paralyzed from the neck down. Had nothing to do with vaccinations, living environment, daycare/school, water etc it's not even contagious. It was just something his body did on it's own. Not sure why or how. BUT luckily, he fully recovered after many many therapies and is now a happy and healthy 5 year old.
2 | Butch Lee | 26 | 10154964964838812_10154965026538812 | Maybe because of the Fukishima disaster that poisoned 1/3 of the ocean with radioactive water which is seeping into the soil, wild life and food....just taking a wild guess.
3 | Beth Fern Reed | 13 | 10154964964838812_10154965560023812 | We know that flu vaccine can cause Gillian Barre, so why not other auto immune disorders.  I'm not an anti vacer, but my kids will never be exposed to an untested vaccine for flu.  And ALL flu vaccine is untested.
4 | Katie Strader | 4 | 10154964964838812_10154965491638812 | Where were these children staying? How were their living conditions? Did they attend the same school? Do they visit the same pond/lake/water source? You must find the cause, so look to the environment and ask questions. What is in the water? What is in the air? Are there old carpets present? Narrow down the results.
5 | Annette Frankos Kent | 0 | 10154964964838812_10154966238323812 | Really everybody blames vaccinations it's because people are not getting vaccinated things are getting out of control they said this could be from polio virus I've had people in my ex husband side of the family that was affected from polio they did not have the polio shot
6 | Ellen Breeden | 2 | 10154964964838812_10154965294883812 | My then 5 yr old was unable to walk last year and was diagnosed with Acute Myocitis , he lost control of his bladder and was bed ridden for 3 days . the Doctors told me it was viral and most likely a side affect from the cold virus that went through our home the week before and my son was 1 of about a dozen cases in the past month they treated and this was last year in April in Flint Michigan . btw kidneys can be affected by this
7 | Robert Rosales | 2 | 10154964964838812_10154964994953812 | Sadly , one child has died already from this and a friend's little brother is currently being treated there for those symptoms.
8 | Michaly Laufer | 3 | 10154964964838812_10154965265498812 | Amy Potvin this made me think of you! So many different cases of clusters of diseases, it must be something going on with the environment in those areas. So, so Terrible!
9 | Maria Munet | 1 | 10154964964838812_10154965517313812 | They should check out what they ate, what they drank if they were recently vaccinated, if the live in the same area. What vitamins were they taking or medications. Most of the information they need it will be in the history.
10 | John Corona | 14 | 10154964964838812_10154965004113812 | Probably from that mosquito stuff they sprayed on everyone or that's what they said it was anyways
11 | Mary Ellis | 10 | 10154964964838812_10154965024723812 | There was a paralytic disease affecting a lot of children about a year ago....but no one seemed to take it seriously. Except me...

15 | Bernadette Mae Sanchez | 11 | 10154964964838812_10154965003543812 | Could it be a bad batch in the IPV  vaccine for Polio.

19 | Nathan Deplue | 5 | 10154964964838812_10154964994083812 | President Obama needs to be impeached as a traitor for breaking his oath of office to "PRESERVE, protect, and defend the United States Constitution" (Emphasis added), in unconstitutionally expanding his presidency, via Executive Orders, into a kingship. President Obama is also guilty of treason for adhering to, aiding and abetting the enemies of this country by using taxpayer money to finance the Muslim Brotherhood's global jihad and working to replace our Constitution with a Shariah-compliant, New World Order, Socialist/Communist agenda. Also and in the alternative, President Obama is not a natural born citizen (or even native born) and, according to the United States Constitution, he is not eligible to be the president. Please do your duty as a member of Congress and impeach Mr. Obama and his Administration and restore the United States Constitution as the supreme law of the land by repealing/striking down via legislation any and all government agency regulations, Executive Orders, and laws in opposition to the United States Constitution.

24 | Randolph O'Brien | 0 | 10154964964838812_10154966114288812 | Quite a scary thing.  Glad to see for most of them it wasn't permanent.

Simone Biles on internet trolls: "Honestly like most of the time, I'm so busy, I don't even see any of it. I have no idea what people are talking about, I know it's crazy to say that. I'm on tour, I'm going to events and appearances. I don't have time to see any of that."

At least 3 people, including two children, killed when trailer carrying trick-or-treaters crashes into another vehicle in eastern Mississippi, authorities say.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Melissa A McWhirter | 127 | 10154964851598812_10154965014933812 | Please pray for this community. I live in the county where this horrible accident happened, only about 10 miles away. I know the young man who hit the back of the trailer. He is a young husband, father, son, and friend who will have to deal with this accident for the rest of his life. No, before you ask the drive was not drinking or, high. It doesn't matter who is at fault, it was a horrible accident. It toke numerous first responders, Police, sheriff departments, 4 different Helo vec, 6 ambulances from different counties to help with this accident. My 20 year old son was one of those first responders, I can't imagine what he is dealing with after helping all these people. I ask you to please just pray for these families.
2 | Carla Adams | 46 | 10154964851598812_10154964966383812 | Some of the comments on here are disgusting. Why don't you people have some compassion and sympathy for the families and friends of the deceased? This is nothing to make jokes about.
3 | Melissa KO | 40 | 10154964851598812_10154964861208812 | Trailers are not passenger vehicles. Trailers are for hauling your furniture, not your friends.
4 | Sway Hobbs | 17 | 10154964851598812_10154965005283812 | People were absolute idiots in my neighborhood tonight. Going 50-60 miles per an hour down a street filled with kids & yes, trailer hay rides. Wtf is wrong with people?!?
5 | Kimberly McNamara | 7 | 10154964851598812_10154965712968812 | I hate to say all of you are stupid. Just pray for the families and stop commenting stupid stuff it's not a joke someone's babies died and all Yall can do is make jokes about the south and Halloween. Out here we take hayrides we ride in back of trucks and we pray for ALL involved even the driver. Maybe yall should do the same instead of blaming Halloween, hayrides, or the driver. We don't know what happened we just know people need prayers families need prayers THE END
6 | Deborah Ruddick-Blais | 7 | 10154964851598812_10154965613508812 | Let me start by saying my prayers are with the families and friends of this very dear community. I have the honor of knowing many of these people and are blessed to call them my friends. It makes no difference where you live or what your political preference is. People are humans...with homes and families. Today,there are three people missing from this love tight community. May God make us aware of our own surroundings and our own lives. Prayers for Chunky.
7 | Stephanie Keister | 5 | 10154964851598812_10154965766258812 | Heartbreaking! For anyone commenting here without sympathy for the loss of innocent children on a day that's supposed to be fun for all YOU ARE A DESPICABLE HEARTLESS HUMAN BEING. If anyone was at fault it certainly wasn't the children. My heart is broken for these families. You can't do anything anymore. Tragedy after tragedy. So sad.
8 | Julie Barajas | 4 | 10154964851598812_10154965702818812 | My goodness this caption is deceiving. The trailer was rear ended, ergo another vehicle crashed in to it, it did not crash in to another vehicle. A hayride in a tiny little town on a road with a 35mph speed limit should have been relatively safe assuming the trailer had visible lighting from the rear. How someone rear ends them is beyond me. This is so sad for everyone involved.
9 | Elizabeth Juarez | 9 | 10154964851598812_10154964862243812 | Idk why people do these things!! Today a truck full of kids in the back threw itself into traffic and everyone had to react quickly enough to break and not kill about 15 children!!!
10 | Patty Jo | 2 | 10154964851598812_10154965838788812 | This is just an incredibly sad accident and nobody really has to say anything...just pray for everyone affected by it and don't judge. How's that for a start.

12 | Caree Kondas Kaufman | 2 | 10154964851598812_10154965283933812 | These poor people. This is a prime example of why vehicles and trick or treaters do not mix. Even golf carts can be dangerous with so many kids around.

2 | George Adams | 6 | 10154964842108812_10154964843858812 | STOP Election Fraud: Do NOT use Soros voting machines. Please vote to put Billery/Killery on trial for TREASON. She broke the law and belongs in jail. She risked our country and put our people in harm's way, and had Democratic whistleblowers murdered. Not only Billery is very dangerous, she will bring this country to a security collapse with cutting our military and a financial collapse by choosing a fight with Russia and ruining small businesses while sending all jobs overseas. Please don't vote for the DEVIL. This country needs to be free and strong, where people have a real chance at the American Dream. Billery should have never been the Democratic candidate to start with and stole the nomination from Bernie Sanders. She is the most corrupt candidate ever and works for the elite new world order who wants to make people obsolete with new robotic technology. She brings with her sinister powers and so do not be fooled by her fake smiles and phony consideration for the working man, or woman. Vote Donald Trump and save our nation. CNN until now has been reporting lies and gossip that was never admissible in court about Donald Trump. But tonight CNN, the yellow tabloid, must for a change act like a real news network and report the truth. Pray to God and pray hard that Donald Trump is our next President. We need to stop criminal refugees from coming here and take care first of our American veterans. We need to work on better trade deals so manufacturing will be back in America. We need to stop paying for parasites! The election is at stake with Billery's dirty tricks and it must be watched closely. Donald Trump is our only hope before Killery turns this country to a worse version of 1984 by George Orwell. I hope the next thing Trump do as our new much admired President is expose all the dirt, every affair and sexual indecency of every CNN reporter, including Anderson, Gloria, and that self righteous long brown haired woman. Then, HC must be locked up for the rest of her life. If you don't want more zombies on the streets, if you don't want to give up cash, and guns and freedom of speech, VOTE for TRUMP!!! We can't afford the status quo! We're losing our country!!! Dare, you pathetic paid patsies online of HC to call me names and I will take screen shots and sue you for libel!!! This nation is SICK of the Clinton cover ups. Stop totalitarianism! CNN=Clinton News Network. Hope Trump fires many of you when he is elected! Let us pray November 8 brings the change that we so desperately need. Long Live Trump, our savior!I am:1) A married WOMAN2) Have no kids3) Intelligent and educated4) Independent politically5) Trump Supporter, Truth Supporter, Freedom Supporter and a Proud American 6) Not a racist, respectful of ALL religions and races 7) Very worried about how globalism will annihilate our country as we know itWe all know main stream media and the system are rigged. We must never take our freedom for granted. On November 8 stand the lines as long as they are because our liberty and justice for all are at stake. Let us pray Billery/Killery will be arrested soon, AMEN. Please share and God Bless. P.S. For crying outloud, stop briefing the enemy Billery if you want to keep the U.S. safe!Hellery/Liary needs to have her clearance removed. Clean the swamp America! Huma is most likely a spy and Loretta Lynch, Justice Department director is as vicious as Killery, pleading the Fifth when Congress asked her about why so many millions of dollars "disappeared" and ended in Iran! We MUST put a stop to the traitors and tried them all for TREASON. PPS Huma=married to a pedophile. Killery=married to a rapist. That's how they respect women, ha???!!! JOKE! We ALL know LIARY is a pathological liar and an urgent danger to the sovereignty of the U.S. Please be careful about CNN too-they are ANTI AMERICAN. Who knows what more harm Killery did to our beloved country. Pray for our country and Trump. Ask yourself who is helping Hillery with the cover up and why...We want our country back!

Agents will look at the time frame when Hillary Clinton was in office, but may include some of the time after she left office, according to sources.

1 | Sandra Marv | 177 | 10154964792013812_10154964809408812 | I'd rather have a candidate for president that didn't use a properly secured email server than someone who sexually assaults women and children. This vague letter changes nothing. The GOP is on a wild goose chase to try to deflect off their sexual predator of a candidate. I trust Hillary more with emails than I do Trump with the nuclear codes.
2 | Martha Youstra | 131 | 10154964792013812_10154964802983812 | It doesn't matter if she was or wasn't in office.........she is a traitor.

5 | Linda Kaye | 24 | 10154964792013812_10154964845748812 | And why aren't you focusing on the child rape case Donald Trump has or the 75 pending lawsuits. ABC News LOVES Donald Trump and always has. That's why I stopped watching you. Biased news station.
6 | Justin Fraioli | 19 | 10154964792013812_10154964849278812 | whats next, The FBI will hold a press conference and due to substantial evidence, Hillary Clinton will be indicted and a grand jury will be assembled and selected along with a special prosecutor. it is possible to believe that Obama has been involved. anyway you slice it, this is a historic American event.
7 | Don Wright | 28 | 10154964792013812_10154964826078812 | A cadet caught cheating on a test has to go before an Honor Board where the outcome could be honor remediation or worse, including expulsion. Hillary is running for the highest position in the country, arguably, the world, and yet she knowingly received questions prior to her debates and suggestions on how she should answer. Wouldn't we reasonably expect the leader of the free world to be held to at least the same standards as a 17 year old plebe? What does it say about her that she accepted the questions and answers before the debates? Even more important, what does it say about anyone who still supports her?
8 | Debra Oliva | 8 | 10154964792013812_10154964904113812 | Well, there was an October surprise from the FBI for Nixon in 1972 and he still won the election. Of course, we all know what happened afterwards.http://watergate.info/chronology/brief-timeline-of-events

10 | John Frame | 4 | 10154964792013812_10154965190738812 | Why is the Democratic party so corrupt? Why don't Democrats care? How does it feel to be on the wrong side of History any one that's voting for Hillary should asks themselves this question. Can you really say she not corrupt and not sound foolish. The FBI reopened the case and after singing there prays the Democratic Party now calls them liars talk about two face. What else will it take starving your children because if she gets in office it's coming your way. She does not have a plain. She want to charge companies when they leave they already do this it's called taxing imports. But she wants free trade which just kills American job growth. Don't be fool by double talk.
11 | Michael Braxton | 1 | 10154964792013812_10154965449618812 | Copied from a friend's page How quickly we forget!  If you’re over 35, take a walk with me down memory lane—you won’t believe what you have forgotten.  If you’re under 35, read on—I promise you that you will be amazed at what you missed!   (By the way, sadly, this isn’t a joke.   I wish it was.)REMEMBER WHEN BILL CLINTON WAS PRESIDENT?(January 20, 1993 to January 20, 2001—two terms)When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over an attempt to reform health care. Her proposed plan was so bad that many Democrats came up with competing plans of their own in protest, and in spite of threats and intimidation, on September 26, 1994, the “Hillarycare” bill was declared dead.This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million for studies, promotion, and other efforts.Then, President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general.  Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood—both were forced to withdraw their names from consideration.  Next, she chose Janet Reno, which husband Bill described as "my worst mistake."  (Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.)Husband Bill also allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission—Lani Guanier was her selection. After considerable backlash from prominent Democratic senators concerning Ms. Guanier's radical views, Bill Clinton withdrew her name from nomination, stating that she did not represents the civil rights views that he had championed during his campaign.However, apparently a slow learner, husband Bill continued to allow Hillary to make more recommendations. She chose former law partners, Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department. Her selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kennedy was forced to resign.  (Is anyone wondering yet what her Supreme Court Justice appointments would be like?)Many younger voters will have no knowledge of "Travelgate," the first major ethics controversy during Bill’s presidency.Hillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend, Harry Thompson—but the White House Travel Office refused to comply. She trumped up allegations of financial mismanagement and reported seven long-time White House employees to the FBI.  This ruined their reputations, got them fired, and caused a thirty-six month investigation. Eventually, most of the employees were reinstated and Clinton associates were forced out of the travel office. Only one White House employee, Billy Dale, was charged with a crime—the enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds;  a jury acquitted him in less than two hours.Still not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House Security.  When Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies (Filegate) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff, suddenly Hillary and the President denied even knowing Livingstone, and of course, denied knowledge of drug use in the White House.Following this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents.Next, when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by Bill Clinton, Hillary was put in charge of the "bimbo eruption" and scandal defense. Let’s look at some of her more notable decisions in this regard . . . She urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation, they settled with Ms. Jones.  She refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor.  After $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr's investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs.  Hillary's devious game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for 'lying under oath' to a grand jury, followed by his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives.  Hillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, "I do not recall," "I have no recollection," and "I don't know" a total of 56 times while under oath.   (Sound familiar?)  After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had "mistakenly thought was hers."So you see, the email scandal and all of her malfeasance regarding the handling of Top Secret information, not to mention the "pay to play" schemes of the Clinton Foundation, are nothing new.  Hillary’s entire political career has been nothing but a web of lies, corruption and destruction in her quest for power.Is anyone else ready to say, “Enough is enough!”?But unfortunately, I’m sure her loyal fans will say, "What difference does it make?"
12 | RJ LaGrange | 14 | 10154964792013812_10154964841713812 | It's really disgusting to watch how low the Democratic Party has gone this year. Undermining Bernie Sanders campaign, the nominee being under FBI investigation,the Department of Justice handing out immunities, to the head of the DNC giving heads up to Hillary Clinton before the primary debates. To say Republicans are crazy, wasting taxpayer dollars is shocking. If Hillary didn't have anything to hide and have to use the private server we wouldn't be in this mess. Her campaign has all the answers to stop this madness! I am mind boggled at the level of blindness here.
13 | Kirk Moore | 2 | 10154964792013812_10154965249453812 | So let me get this straight, Clinton and Brazile committed fraud by cheating in not one, but two General Elections for The Presidency of The United States, with the help of people at CNN and she is still aloud to run for the office.

25 | Tammy Morgan | 0 | 10154964792013812_10154965471628812 | People are still voting for Hillary solely on the fact that she's is a woman. No other reason. They also had no idea what the implementation of shaira law and the open borders meant for the lower and middle class. And her position of late term abortion. The reasons why I can't in my right mind vote for Hillary has nothing to do with the fact that she cannot distinguish that the C stands for classified, even after being in this business for, I dunno 30+ years? It's because I am in the military, and if my team and I were left to die with support just hours away, and no help was sent. Then she lied to the families about their deaths and treated that horror as if it were no big deal. That tell me she doesn't care for the lives of Americans. Now she wants us to give up out culture and our beliefs to accommodate the very people we have been engaged in war with? No thanks.
