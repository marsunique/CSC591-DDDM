She will be more remembered for her scandals than for being the first female president. Is Trump perfect? no, he isn't, but clinton is who will make your life a real hell. Think about it. Thank you - #TrumpPence #MAGA
2 | Anthony Munoz | 2797 | 10154771897816336_10154772152791336 | This "DEPLORABLE" "TACO BOWL" is not fooled... So she has survived sniper fire in Bosnia, referred to blacks and Muslims as "Never do wells..." Funded a multi million dollar wedding for her daughter with her "Foundation." Puts the entire nation in grave danger with an unsecured server that was hacked by at least 5 nations... And people are voting to her why? Oh yeah she also committed perjury on multiple occasions...
3 | Robin Capece Field | 2587 | 10154771897816336_10154772159921336 | I AM A WOMAN, NATIVE PENNSYLVANIAN....! When I am casting my vote on November 8, I will NOT think of the "advice" of any entertainer. I WILL however remember the core values I learned being raised in a Christian home; I will remember how they taught me to honor the country of Israel and the Jews; I will remember learning how evil the KKK and segregation were; I will remember the 2nd Amendment for the right to bear arms as my father hunted for food for our table. I was asked tonight how I could support Trump. My response was this....If he had put our nation's security at risk, I would not vote for him. If his organization received large donations from countries that killed women and gays, I would not vote for him. If he boasted 30 Years of government experience, but still could not discern if an email was classified or not, without someone letting him know if it was or not, I would not vote for him. If he boasted about how he has defended children his entire life, but is for abortion, (even late term, when the child can feel pain) I would not vote for him. If he caused lives to be destroyed in Benghazi and then lied to the faces of the parents as they stood at their child's casket, I would not vote for him. If people who came against him mysteriously turned up dead, I would not vote for him. If he suddenly developed a southern accent when he was in the South, campaigning, I would not vote for him. If he continually broke the law and that was ignored, I would not vote for him, but right now, the ONLY person who does ALL these things is Hillary. Right now, the fact that Donald made some regrettable remarks over 12 years ago, does not move me. I'm bigger than those remarks and we all have said stupid things throughout our lives. To me, the fact that Hillary lies continuously, is a much bigger problem. We can see the effects of her lies by the state of our poor country right now... I WILL VOTE FOR TRUMP.
4 | Albert Smith | 1785 | 10154771897816336_10154772154651336 | Hillary has celebrities on her.side, the media, social media, the elite of this country, foreign leaders from Saudi Arabia and other.countries of that nature, and the president.... But all those campaign pushers aren't the average every day American working.class people..... Those people are voting TRUMP.... And trump is winning the people over
5 | Zach Kerman | 1421 | 10154771897816336_10154772153026336 | Michelle Obama said if Donald Trump is elected: "We're telling our sons it's okay to humiliate women. We're telling our daughters this is how they deserve to be treated.".... that's funny. So does that mean that if Hillary Clinton is elected, we are teaching our sons & daughters that it's ok to murder, lie, cover up, be corrupt, demean women, use racial slurs, and stay with a spouse that openly rapes women & cheats on you?
6 | Mabel L Santos | 974 | 10154771897816336_10154772156116336 | God the Father .I ask and pray that you protect Mr Trump and Mr Pence.. Strengthen Trump& Pence in the power of Your might, O God. Dress them in Your armor so that they can stand firm against the schemes of the devil. We know that our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places. I pray and this things in the Name of our Savior Jesus Christ Amen... Praise God the Father of all creatures.. Blessing's upon Mr Trump and Mr Pence... Amen..
7 | Mark Jones | 832 | 10154771897816336_10154772152401336 | For the love of God, our families futures, our country, and all of those hundreds of thousands of amazing, unselfish warriors who fought and died to protect our Constitution, PLEASE make sure to vote for Trump tomorrow. Millions have fled other 3rd world lawless, corrupt, and tyrannical countries to come here to have what have...freedom. We have a Constitution that puts We the people in control, not the government . Don't let Clinton make sure we become another 3rd world nation by appointing the wrong people to SCOTUS. May God continue to bless the UNITED States of America. Thank you. Sincerely.
8 | Otto A. Gruhn | 485 | 10154771897816336_10154772159261336 | Here's the truth, the ugly painful undeniable truth.Anyone who votes for someone other than Donald Trump or does not vote at all in this 2016 presidential election is by their own actions supporting the continuation of government corruption at the highest levels, ruling class elitism, crony capitalism, the abuse of power, the obfuscation of the truth and usurpation of the American people.You can try to rationalize it any way you want but you cannot escape the truth, she represents all that is wrong with Washington DC and casting a vote for anyone other than Donald Trump helps to elect her and her only.If you love America, our Freedoms, our Rights and our Sovereignty more than your political party you will join me in voting for Trump, even if you have to hold your nose (like me) while doing so.The stakes are too high too long lasting, this is not a football game where we each want our team to win, in this we should all be on the same team. The reason we are here in this situation is because we keep voting for "our team" it's time we do what is right for the Nation at this particular point in time......it's time to drain the swamp!
9 | Mark Deda | 475 | 10154771897816336_10154772157806336 | I have never been more disgusted in a presidential election in my entire life. Comey once again paid off by the Clinton campaign. He said the new emails would take months to review.... But took a week to conclude Hillary was not guilty. The system is #Rigged but not to worry the silent majority will have the FINAL say on Tuesday.
10 | Mark John Vukelich | 205 | 10154771897816336_10154772155756336 | In recent history our nation had three Pendulum shifts 1) Calvin Coolidge. 2) Ronald Reagan. 3) The Contract with America. These shifts helped to keep our Nation pointed in the correct direction, we are on the brink of shifting to the point of no return. we need a fourth Make America great again.
11 | Ann Berfield | 140 | 10154771897816336_10154772159606336 | I live in Illinois and the only county in the whole state that is blue is Cook County up by Chicago....there are 102 counties in the entire state.  Kinda sad really, that one county dictates the election results.  However, we did elect a REPUBLICAN Governor last year so there is still hope!  :)
12 | Gloria Adams | 171 | 10154771897816336_10154772159491336 | They want you to think that Hillary is winning so Republicans and Trump supporters will think, why bother voting and will not go to the polls!! DO NOT listen to the MEDIA!!
13 | Tamara McKamy | 138 | 10154771897816336_10154772178786336 | This is such bunk! TEXAS DOES NOT "LEAN GOP!" There is not a chance in Hell, Texas will turn blue for Hillary! We are straight up, born and bred, RED-blooded, Conservatives. The majority of blues are in Austin and we don't claim them!
14 | Brandy Zoeller Ferriell | 70 | 10154771897816336_10154772178386336 | I wish a vote counted as a vote. No more electoral college! Each person is equally as valuable as the next. Legal citizens that is.
15 | Pattie Goshtigian | 70 | 10154771897816336_10154772161746336 | personally hope that people will vote with a conscience. I am not voting for Trump and I'm not voting against Clinton, I am voting for the policies supported by the individual that will keep our amendments in tact and not try to sway from what the founding fathers began with to establish this great country. The Supreme Court Justice that will be placed in the position is key to who gets my vote. I respect others that don't agree with me and I expect the same courtesy with my selection. We are all in this together and while we may not agree on certain things, I think the two most important reasons I'm voting are, for the children and grandchildren. They are the future of this country and I want to make sure that they are not left with a mess from us making bad decisions and trusting the wrong people.I am voting for the candidate who will respect my Christian values and not try to change the inspired Word of God in the Bible. We can do nothing without Him. He is the moral compass that this country needs and should not be removed from everything. So that being said, my vote is going to Donald Trump.Like · Reply · 2 mins
16 | Becky E Krick | 59 | 10154771897816336_10154772163746336 | I will never forget Benghazi. How about you? Hillary doesn't deserve to be president she deserves jail. Koolaid drinkers what will you do when the US the bastion of freedom is gone? All these faux ideas of Hillary are proved wrong just like on Obamacare and we are no longer a free society? I feel so sorry for our country if Clinton is elected. And we will have so much garbage stuffed down our throats just like obamacare. We will be overrun by Islamic terrorists, gangs with ulterior motives killing cops. We are in for terrible times. We will lose the constitution and our rights. This is where I post my long list of Hillary 's past indescretions. I am imploring you to vote Trump. You may not like him and his brash ways but he has our country at heart. And don't believe all those accusations about him before he can clear them up the election will be lost because of dirty campaigning. Just think about all the good people he will have behind him to help save our country. People it's time to really think and take our country back. Hillary is selling off our country to the highest bidder who will deposit bribes to the Clinton foundation. Communist Chinese buying a port in California causing the loss of 18,000 American jobs, Saudi's buying land to grow cattle crops to send back to their country to feed their cattle using our scarce water and selling our uranium to Russia and who knows where it will wind up probably against us. All to our enemies with Reid's help. She leaves a trail of despicable acts in her wake. She has years of lying and bad decisions do we really want this morally bankrupt person for our president? The new messes Benghazi, Haiti gold gate, Russia uranium gate, email gate, bribes to the Clinton foundation etc. We all need to get out and vote Trump! Hillary has an extensive list of corruption and lies. She's not even a lawyer lied one too many times. Her resume. interesting read,someone else posted this,,memory all should know Many people who may vote in the democratic primary election and the general election in 2016 have no real knowledge of Mrs. Clinton or her accomplishments. As a public service, I thought I would provide some input regarding her triumphs for consideration.When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over a health care reform. Even after threats and intimidation, she couldn’t even get a vote in a democratic controlled congress. This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million in cost for studies, promotion, and other efforts.Then President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general. Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood – both were forced to withdraw their names from consideration. Next she chose Janet Reno – husband Bill described her selection as “my worst mistake.” Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.Husband Bill allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission. Lani Guanier was her selection. When a little probing led to the discovered of Ms. Guanier’s radical views, her name had to be withdrawn from consideration.Apparently a slow learner, husband Bill allowed Hillary to make some more recommendations. She chose former law partners Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department. Her selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kennedy was forced to resign.Many younger voters will have no knowledge of “Travelgate.” Hillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend Harry Thompson – and the White House Travel Office refused to comply. She managed to have them reported to the FBI and fired. This ruined their reputations, cost them their jobs, and caused a thirty-six month investigation. Only one employee, Billy Dale was charged with a crime, and that of the enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds. A jury acquitted him of any crime in less than two hoursStill not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House security. When Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies (Filegate) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff, suddenly Hillary and the president denied even knowing Livingstone, and of course, denied knowledge of drug use in the White House. Following this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents.Next, when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by Bill Clinton, Hillary was put in charge of the “bimbo eruption” and scandal defense. Some of her more notable decisions in the debacle were:· She urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation they settled with Ms. Jones.· She refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor. After $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr’s investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs.· Hillary’s devious game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for lying under oath to a grand jury and then his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives.· Hillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, “I do not recall,” “I have no recollection,” and “I don’t know” a total of 56 times while under oath.· After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had stolen.Now we are exposed to: the destruction of possibly incriminating emails while Hillary was Secretary of State and the “pay to play” schemes of the Clinton Foundation – we have no idea what shoe will fall next. But to her loyal fans – “what difference does it make?”
17 | Kathy Kelly-Wood | 61 | 10154771897816336_10154772161231336 | The saddest part of all of this is that those voting for Hillary are sending a crystal clear message that law and order, and the core principles of the Constitution have no place here in America.
18 | David Thorne | 31 | 10154771897816336_1109905812380572 | College electoral is lame. The presidency should not fall on certain states. Make it more fair. Make each state worth the same amount. The one with the most states wins. Then the people's voice will be heard
19 | Patty Scheg | 34 | 10154771897816336_10154772170306336 | T🇺🇸R🇺🇸U🇺🇸M🇺🇸P!!! Make America great again… Put God back in the White House… Freedom of speech, the ability to protect your home and family, Jobs back in America.. lower taxes, and reasonably priced health insurance...

21 | Kit Hoffman | 19 | 10154771897816336_10154772179081336 | I find it strange that right this very minute crooked hillary is holding a rally in Michigan. In Michigan? Why is the demon rat candidate for president holding a rally in of all places Michigan the day before the election? Michigan hasn't been won by a Republican since the days of Ronald Reagan I wanna guess. Michigan is about blue of a demon rat , pro union socialist state as any state in the country...Why would her campaign feel the need to go there? Could it be desperation? And further more...All these polls keep saying she has a 2 or 3% lead nationally; ...Ok, well if that's true; wouldn't one think that a candidate that has spent their entire career as a politician serving in the Senate and Sec of State would have a much much bigger lead over a candidate that hasn't spent one single day of his career in public service?
22 | Jim Williams | 16 | 10154771897816336_1109905825713904 | Latricia check out the top comments, again =) Meanwhile Obama is on TV right now telling people Trump is buddies with the kkk, and they're dumb enough to believe him!

24 | Stephen Zimmer | 27 | 10154771897816336_10154772155606336 | I love coming here to read the comments. Some people (like myself at times) are obsessed with reading comments. For example, we find you reading this comment right now, which does not contain any useful information, only curiosity, that drives you to waste your time. Have a good day.
25 | Edward Charlonis | 10 | 10154771897816336_1109921639045656 | Texas is " leaning GOP " ?! This is why no one believes the polls.Texas would NEVER elect a liberal especially one as horrible as this one

2 | Liz Odum | 2474 | 10154771828331336_10154771856006336 | Wait and see what happens to the real estate market if Hillary wins. We're in for an economic collapse within six months either way... however, with Trump we still have a chance for a quicker recovery. Voting for Trump/Pence tomorrow morning.
3 | Diane Bruski Michalsen Kowalewski | 960 | 10154771828331336_10154771859156336 | Wow Chelsa's 3 million dollar wedding paid for by the Clinton Foundation. Really and people are voting for her!! If she is elected I will need to use the mute button since I cant stand her screechy voice!
4 | Leo Decaj | 845 | 10154771828331336_10154771853596336 | When you go to the polls on November 8th, remember this: Donald Trump is willing to spend millions of his own dollars on a movement to make America great again, while Hillary Clinton has spent the last 30 years selling out the American people for millions of dollars from foreign governments and special interests
5 | Dan Buress Sr. | 394 | 10154771828331336_10154771858211336 | Do not be distracted! Democrats want open borders, higher taxes, more "refugees" & illegals, weakened military & police, abolish the 2nd Amendment, Leftist judges, more BLM, and more islamic influence. THAT IS NOT A CHOICE!!!!! Trump/Pence 2016!

Because they dont like what Trump said 11 yrs ago?  we dont have to look very far to see what the real problem in America is.... Its us. We the people..
8 | Mike Conway | 225 | 10154771828331336_10154771855576336 | It doesnt matter...As the USA dies in front of us, helpless to do a thing because of the iron fist of corrupted power silencing what is good, moral and right. The rule of law and the constitution. The realization that this government is more corrupt than I already knew it to be...makes me feel and realize how helpless and hopeless we all are when confronted with this level of evil, power and corruption that is this government and that corrupt evil woman.
9 | Jamey Tomasin | 157 | 10154771828331336_10154771865066336 | Dear Mr Trump....if you do not win tomorrow a little piece of me will die. I want to believe in the goodness of this country but know that may be a fairytale with all that I read. I worked all of my life to ensure that others had a fair shot at the prize.....and now we have this. Trolls...please comment elsewhere. I am at my limit for inane remarks.
10 | Nick Adams | 116 | 10154771828331336_10154771862051336 | I honestly can't believe after all this, people are still with her.  We were.. But never again. I honestly believe most her voters, drink tap water too much, that government water got you sheeped up guys!
11 | Monica Maria Martinez | 62 | 10154771828331336_10154771873561336 | Any woman voting for Crooked Hillary needs certifying..She gets large donations to her foundation from countries where women have no rights & it's legal for their husbands to rape them..
12 | Yogi Kesl | 58 | 10154771828331336_10154771867081336 | The corrupt government wants Hillary in office. They have spent so much time and money covering up for her. To me this has been the worse election. God help us all if she gets into office
13 | Joao Lucas | 65 | 10154771828331336_10154771854406336 | I love coming here to read the comments. Some people (like myself at times) are obsessed with reading comments. For example, we find you reading this comment right now, which does not contain any useful information, only curiosity, that drives you to waste your time. Have a good day.
14 | Ashley Givens | 25 | 10154771828331336_10154771872376336 | This is nothing new. We KNOW she is guilty as sin. The problem is, her supporters don't care. They will vote for her just because they hate Trump. And the people who have the authority to do something about it simply won't for either fear of their lives or fear of losing their jobs, who knows. This woman is like a bad penny. She will never go away. Let's just hope and pray we can keep her OUT of our White House.
15 | Todd Coconato | 17 | 10154771828331336_10154771880696336 | What we now know about HRC and why this is the most important election of our lifetime:1. Hillary Clinton mishandled and was extremely careless with top secret emails that she sent to, and dialogued with, POTUS, Huma Abedin, and countless others via a private server. This is illegal. 2. HRC received large donations via the Clinton foundation and also to her campaign from foreign governments that are the same governments that have been funding and arming ISIS. She has also been linked to these country's in dealing with arms sales. (The largest in US history to Saudi Arabia).3. HRC gave 20% of US uranium to Russia (through uranium one), and has been part of a foreign policy that has reduced our military to pre-world war two levels of readiness and reduced our nuclear arsenal to 30 year lows-all the while putting us into the worst relations with Russia since the Cold War period. 4. Hillary's right hand woman-Huma Abedin is associated closely with the Muslim Brotherhood. Her campaign manager Podesta has been connected with occult rituals (via Wikileaks to a "spirit dinner") and also has a picture in his office of two men eating another man! He also has been linked to countless illegal dealings via the "Podesta files" Wikileaks document dump operations. Her two mentors, senator Byrd and Saul Alinskey are deep into the occult as well-Byrd was a former "Exalted Cyclops" of the KKK and Saul Alinskey dedicated his book "rules for radicals" to Lucifer! 5. Through Wikileaks, we have learned that Clinton was involved in several significant pay-to-play schemes with foreign governments and elites. This is an act of treason and violates US law for an elected and/or government official. 6. We now know that the Clinton foundation held 90% of its donations/ charitable earnings and only gave out 10% to the appropriate charities. (I.e Haiti) 7. In the 90s the Clintons were connected to giving China "most favored nation status" which led to the biggest transfer of wealth in the history of the world from the west to the east.8. HRC was an original architect of the current health care system (Hillary care) and wants to further this process to a single payer system which would collapse our system. She is also in favor of one of the biggest tax hikes in the history of our nation. Through additional promised entitlements and benefits to illegals, each American would have around a 6% increase in income tax. 9. There are 44 people around the Clintons that have died mysteriously. 10. Hillary Clinton wants Christians to "re-learn" our beliefs (change them) to embrace her far leftist and occultist views. She will further limit and restrict freedom of speech and religion.11. HRC stands for partial birth abortion-the most radical and inhumane practice of abortion where the babies crown is stabbed and vacuumed out of a mothers womb-only weeks out for the birth cycle date. 12. HRC is for a "global government"-one without borders. Her biggest donors, such as elitist George Soros, have influenced nation states around the world through the funding of billions of dollars of dealings with opposition factions. This is used to topple governments and place puppet regimes in place so that he can use policy control to further his globalist agenda. 13. The Clintons have been to Epstein's sex orgy island (an island that houses underage victims of the sex trade industry) multiple times according to outed flight logs. HRC has personally been there 6 times and her husband 26 times. 14. She lied to the FBI on multiple occasions. A felony. 15. Got debate questions ahead of time and didn't turn them down, but used it to her advantage! 16. She was in favor of NAFTA and is in favor of the TPP-calling it the "gold standard" and has openly admired to having a public and private policy which leans toward the banking elites. NAFTA is responsible for the loss of hundreds of thousands of American jobs and the economic devastation it has caused is still being felt today. America has lost its ability to be a bustling manufacturing hub and is now reduced to a "service economy". 17. Hillary Clinton will appoint the most liberal judges to the Supreme Court which will alter the course of this nation for the next 50 plus years. 18. Under HRC, more than 20000000 illegals will flood into our country in the next few years. 19. HRC wants to increase the amount of Syrian refugees by several hundred thousand. These are unvetted people and can be a "Trojan horse" for incoming terrorists infiltrating our national borders. 20. HRC supports nations that are hostile to women and homosexuals. Sharia law actually permits killings gays and throwing them off of buildings. These are her biggest foreign donors-muslims and Muslim states such as Saudi Arabia. Woman in these nations have no rights and are a lower class in society than men. I could go on and on, but really people??? How can you vote for this woman?? If you can think of more, add them below!!!
16 | Christi Johnson | 27 | 10154771828331336_10154771881801336 | ⚠️If you are Gay, Why are you voting for Hillary when she wants to bring in thousands of refugees that believe all Gays should be executed?👁⚠️If you are Black, Why are you voting for Hillary when she admires Margaret Sanger and defends Planned Parenthood who want to abort as many black babies as possible? Exterminate the black race because they are like "weeds". (Margaret Sanger quote) Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.👁⚠️If you are a Christian, Why are you voting for Hillary Clinton when she wrote her Senior thesis on Saul Alinsky who dedicated his book 'Rules for Radicals' to Lucifer (the Devil)? She says he was, and still is her mentor.👁⚠️If you are a Veteran, in the Military, or closely related to a Military member, Why are you voting for Hillary when she left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again? They called for help but the help was told to stand down.👁⚠️If you have a factory job, Why are you voting for Hillary when she supported TPP? Factory workers are being laid off because jobs are going over seas. Don't forget the deals she's made with china. She also welcomes open borders and illegals to get benefits to be paid with Your tax money.👁⚠️If you are poor, Why are you voting for Hillary, when she is supporting Wall street and all the big banks?

17 | Ellie Lantz | 15 | 10154771828331336_10154771872136336 | The sad fact is that the Republican and Democrat Congress people and Senators that you elected to represent your best interests in this government know these facts very well but have behaved like ignorant fools throughout all the worthless hearings and revelations of wrong doing! Some may wave their finger and lash out in public as a pretence but have no intention of holding anyone n the Obama administration responsible for the corrupt criminal behavior throughout the past eight years!
18 | Melinda Hudson | 18 | 10154771828331336_10154771867346336 | How can she keep getting away with everything. Especially the emails and the Foundation. These are suppose to be smart men. Are they being paid off or what? This country has had enough of this corruption
19 | Danielle M Varela | 11 | 10154771828331336_575937609273936 | So...I just called the campaign center for Hillary Clinton..."Hillary for America" (info from my voter information pamphlet) and asked when she was going to be indicted for all of the felonies she's committed. "She will not be, but thank you for your interest." is the answer I got before being hung up on. Then it occurred to me: let's all call them. Let's all inundate them with phone calls expressing our concerns for her as president. Let's flood the phone line. Want to join me? My next phone call is going to ask what her plans are for unborn women and what does she do to support and champion for them?(646-854-1432) post your results in the comments
20 | Danielle Dupee | 9 | 10154771828331336_10154771880606336 | My mom couldn't have a phone with a camera when she worked as a contractor for the Navy due to security risks, and even then it wasn't allowed to be on for the same reasons stated in this article.  Clinton's double standard simply blows my mind.
21 | Kat Picanco | 11 | 10154771828331336_10154771868911336 | THE ROWBOAT COMES FOR YOU.....This may be the best and most honest political promotion statement you will ever read.  It decidedly does not brush objections aside.  You hate Hillary?  READ it.  You hate Trump?  READ it.  You think there's no choice?  READ it.  And, read it with your grown-up hat on.  We've all been dealt huge responsibility with this election.  The first step toward accepting responsibility is accepting it, and the first step toward accepting it is recognizing it.  READ THIS.  Read every single word.  It'll take you about three minutes.  Be sure to read to the end (take a few minutes and read all of it!)Are you sickened and despondent with the current campaign and upcoming presidential election?I consider myself a conservative and do truly believe our country is at a political/economic/moral/ social crossroads. I need to let you know I could/would never vote for Hillary Clinton to lead this country.  To me, she represents everything that is wrong with our current political structure.  On the flip side, I look and listen to Donald Trump and I cringe at every rude, insulting comment he makes.If you find yourself in a similar state of mind, please read the following article:A Message For Christians About Donald TrumpHere's a famous joke about God and how he talks to us."A deeply faithful Christian man is stuck on roof at home with massive flooding up to the 2nd floor. Rowboat comes. He says "No, I'm waiting for God. I prayed and I know he's coming."  2nd Rowboat. "No, I'm waiting for God." 3rd Rowboat. "No, I'm waiting for God."Water rises. The man drowns. Now he's meeting God in heaven. The religious man says, "Where were you God? I prayed. I was faithful. I asked you to save me. Why would you abandon me?"God says, "Hey, I sent you 3 rowboats."Did you ever consider Trump is our rowboat?Maybe God is trying to tell us something important--that now is not the time for a "nice Christian guy" or a "gentleman" or a typical Republican powder puff. Maybe now is the time for a natural born killer, a ruthless fighter, a warrior. Because right about now we need a miracle, or America is finished. Maybe the rules of gentlemen don't apply here. Maybe a gentleman and "all-around nice Christian" would lead us to slaughter.Or do you want another Mitt Romney, Bob Dole, John McCain, Gerald Ford or Paul Ryan? Did any of them win? Did they lead the GOP to "the promised land?" Did they change the direction of America ? No, because if you don't win, you have no say.Paul Ryan couldn't even deliver his own state, Wisconsin ! And as leader of the House, Paul Ryan rolls over to Obama like my dog rolls over for a scrap of food, or a steak bone.  Nice, but obedient. I mean Paul Ryan...not my dog. My dog is actually a pretty good defender and loyal.Maybe God is knocking on your door loudly, but you're not listening. Maybe God understands we need a "war leader" at this moment in time. Maybe God understands if we don't win this election, America is dead. It's over. The greatest nation in world history will be gone. Finished. Kaput. Adios.And with one last breath, maybe what we need to save us at the last second, is someone different. Someone you haven't ever experienced before-- because you weren't raised in rough and tumble New York where nothing good gets accomplished unless you're combative, aggressive, outrageous, on offense at all times, and maybe just a tad arrogant too.Someone with a personality you've never seen on stage at your church. Maybe, just maybe, being a nice gentlemanly Christian would not beat Hillary and her billion dollars, and her best friends in the media who will unleash the dogs of hell upon the GOP nominee.I guess you think God is only nice and gentlemanly. Really? Then you've missed the whole point of the Bible. When necessary, God is pretty tough. When necessary, God strikes with pain, death and destruction. When necessary, God inflicts vengeance.Maybe you think God couldn't possibly be associated with someone like Trump. Trump is too vicious, rude and crude.When we won WWII, was God "nice?" Were we gentlemanly when defeating Hitler? Were we gentlemanly when firebombing Germany? Were we gentlemanly when dropping atomic bombs on Japan ? Is God ever "nice" on the battlefield? Or does he send us vicious SOB's like General George S. Patton so the good guys can defeat evil?It's pretty clear to me God sends unique people to be "war leaders." That's a different role than a pastor or church leader. God understands that.And maybe it's time to re-define "nice." Maybe Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan aren't nice at all--because they led us to defeat. And losing again would mean the end of America . And God can't allow that. Maybe Romney and Ryan mean well, but the road to hell is paved with good intentions. Or maybe they're just jealous they had their chance and blew it. Maybe they'd rather help elect Hillary than allow a Trump victory that would make them look weak, feckless and incompetent."Even the youths shall faint and be weary, And the young men shall utterly fall, But those who wait on the Lord shall renew their strength; They shall mount up with wings like eagles, They shall run and not be weary, They shall walk and not faint." (Isiah 40:30-31)God is about miracles. We don't need a "nice guy" or a "gentleman" right now. It's the 4th quarter and we're losing 14-0. We need a miracle.So let me repeat my message to Christians: "YOU'RE MISSING THE BOAT."I believe Trump is our miracle. I believe Trump is our rowboat. Except he's more like a battleship!No one is saying Trump is perfect. No one is saying Trump is a perfect conservative. But he is a patriot. He is a warrior. He is a capitalist. He is the right man, at the right time.  Yes, he's a bit rude and crude and offensive. But that may make him the perfect warrior to save America , American exceptionalism, capitalism and Judeo-Christian values. The choice should be easy for Christians.It's Trump...or it's the end of the American dream.If anything in this article strikes a positive chord with you, please pass it on.
22 | Kathy Walsh | 8 | 10154771828331336_10154771885636336 | The FBI, I'm sure, has been 'informed" on what they are to say. Comey just didn't decide to reinvestigate, to then turn around and say nothing has changed! Cmon people,  we know who's running this show. Please get out & vote if you want America to be great again!!
23 | Joe Willis | 4 | 10154771828331336_1152723871481675 | Trump Supporters say:1-Bill Clinton cheats on his wife. Impeach him. Trump proudly brags about sexual assault (and has cheated on his wives). Elect him. 2-Hillary oversaw the department of state while 4 people died in an embassy attack. Put her in jail. Republicans were in office while over 200 people died in embassy attacks. No problem. 3-Immigrants don't pay taxes. Round them up and kick them out. Trump doesn't pay taxes. He's a business genius. 4-Hillary's foundation only spent 87% of their donations helping people. She's a crook. Trumps foundation paid off his debts, bought sculptures of him, and made political donations to avoid investigations while using less than 5% of funds for charity (and he got shut down by NY State). So savvy... Put him in the white house. 5-Trump made 4 billion dollars in 40 years, when an index fund started at the same time with the same "small loans" he received would be worth $12 billion today... without a trail of bankruptcies, thousands of lawsuits and burned small business owners. He's a real business whiz.6-Hillary took a loss of $700k. She's a criminal. Trump is the first candidate in the modern era not to release his tax returns, and took a billion dollar loss in 1 year. Genius. 7-Hillary takes responsibility for private email servers and apologizes. Not credible.Trump denies saying things (on the record) he actually said (on the record), he's just telling it like it is.8-Hillary has helped pass 287 bills that support our vets. She hates vetsTrump attacks war heroes who were POWs or the families of persons who have given there lives for their country. He supports our troops and vets.9.Trump got five draft deferments to avoid serving while other brave American went and fought. He has done great service for our country-OTHER FACTS THEY DONT WANT YOU TO KNOW-Trump Casinos………..FailedTrump Mortgage…...FailedTrump University….FailedTrump Vodka………....FailedChina connection….FailedBankruptcies…………..FourIllegal alien female escort (prostitutes to you Christians),turned into a wife,1 so far (his 3rd wife)Trump clothing & deluxe hats, made in china & AsiaTrump’s daughters clothing line, made in AsiaAnd for law and order:Child rape allegations, with legal action pending3500 lawsuits against himUpcoming trail for fraudDoesn’t pay most of his small business agreements Fails to pay employee’sMob tiesRussian sympather (wouldn’t Joe McCarthy be proud)In debt to russia and chinaWhich is making America great how?So remind me again, what makes him such a “winner”?Trump Supporters Your arguments are thin. Your ignorance of reality is shocking. Your double-standards are offensive, and your willingness to blindly support TRUMP and recycle the rhetoric is absurd. Your opinion is not fact.

1 | Grace Tuinstra | 4474 | 10154771761871336_10154771766716336 | Obama played his race card, Hillary's playing her woman card so Americans are now playing their Trump card #TrumpforPresident
2 | Amaury Francisco Guerrero | 1314 | 10154771761871336_10154771764761336 | If you want more of the same, more people on food stamps, more disorder and chaos, more division among races, If you want the education system to continue going down, more intervention in other nations, If you want poverty to continue to grow, more violence and crime, more hatred against law enforcement and a lawless nation, If you want corporation to continue to control politicians, If you want politicians to continue making decision based on the interest of corporations instead of the people, If you want a hot war with Russia and China that lead to a full world war and the death of millions of people in the US, Europe, Asia and the Middle East, and If you want the US to continue being the laughing stock of the world, then all you need to do is vote for Hillary. However, if you want jobs, you love your country, your want law and order, you want a better future for your kids, you want the US to be respected again, you want peace, high wages, less foreign interference, a safer nation, better relations with other countries, less corruption and more transparency, then you need to vote for Trump. It's up to you!
3 | Kathy Manaro Braddock | 868 | 10154771761871336_10154771775096336 | I'm all for a woman president someday, just not Hillary.  I would prefer a woman that was honest and had values that would make you proud to vote for her.
4 | Le Brown James | 469 | 10154771761871336_10154771776656336 | Am In Africa, and i know that i should be minding Africa's Business, but we are counting on you guys. As we support you with prayers please please vote red tomorrow and send evil home
5 | Jill Stoddard | 487 | 10154771761871336_10154771790181336 | Gender has nothing to do with voting for a Democratic president. It's insulting that you would think that way. And what's more insulting is voting for a creep like Donald Trump just because you're Republican! It's embarrassing as an American that we would even consider a man like trump to be in the White House and put him has the highest ranking man in the world!! Yikes. We are laughing stock around the world because we have allowed such a disgusting human as Donald Trump to have gotten this far. That's what is insulting to our intelligence!!!!
6 | Dan Buress Sr. | 330 | 10154771761871336_10154771765956336 | Do not be distracted! Democrats want open borders, higher taxes, more "refugees" & illegals, weakened military & police, abolish the 2nd Amendment, Leftist judges, more BLM, and more islamic influence. THAT IS NOT A CHOICE!!!!! Trump/Pence 2016!
7 | Christopher Cook | 131 | 10154771761871336_10154771766206336 | Any woman voting for Crooked Hillary needs certifying..She gets large donations to her foundation from countries where women have no rights & it's legal for their husbands to rape them..

9 | Chris Suggs | 66 | 10154771761871336_10154771772211336 | If Obama couldn't unite everyone, what makes them think someone hated by 60% of America will unite us? If she wins there will be a civil war and possible military coup. So vote Hillary and start the war you fear
10 | Elisabeth Morgan | 88 | 10154771761871336_10154771769726336 | The funny thing is that that is exactly why some women vote for Hillary Clinton. Some women just want a female president, they don't care what quality person they get as long as it is a female.
11 | Lynn Henderson Merker | 63 | 10154771761871336_10154771803331336 | And it is insulting to have your father-in-law speak the way he does about women, minorities, or any other person that may not agree with him! He's classless lady!
12 | Cindy Dixon Collins | 35 | 10154771761871336_10154771789371336 | Oh my goodness so glad Lanny Davis is bi-partisan, I'd hate to hear what a Democrat supporter would've said.  Looks like Fox is joining the rest of the media in trying to brainwash us.  I'm one white, educated, suburban woman who is still voting for Trump in spite of everything they're reporting.
13 | Diana Gould Burton | 25 | 10154771761871336_1019591318163071 | Voting for hillary clinton b/c she is a woman is like eating a turd b/c it looks like a tootsie roll.  clinton is an embarrassment to my gender. I think we need a woman in the WH one day, but it ain't her!!!!  I wouldn't spit on her if she were in flames.

16 | Diane Hughes | 19 | 10154771761871336_10154771804741336 | Yesterday I read an article on Facebook that explained what some democrats actually believe about Hillary. I had been wondering how anyone could even consider voting for a person who was such corrupt liar. This article went to great lengths to justify the unjustifiable…in short, democrats who support Hillary don’t believe she’s a corrupt liar! Can you imagine! Do they actually think the FBI is investigating her because they have nothing else to do? However, the article skewed and wove the information about Hillary in such a convoluted way, it made it look as though she was not guilty of any wrongdoing! I couldn’t believe intelligent people could possibly fall for such nonsense. However, it also became clear to me that some of Hillary’s supporters were not going to be convinced she was a corrupt liar; therefore, let’s forget about the fact that she used an illegal server while she was Secretary of State and jeopardized the security of the United States…and focus on the issues: Hillary is going to double-down on obamacare—and eventually probably make it a single-payer scheme where the government is in complete control of the health insurance of the American people. Hillary wants to raise our taxes and have more idiotic trade deals that favor the foreign country over the United States—causing even more of our jobs to disappear. Perhaps the absolutely more terrifying thing is that Hillary wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees to come into the United States; and have open borders. This means anyone can come into our country; and law enforcement states the increased violence will be massive. We can’t know who’s coming into our country—terrorists, criminals, drugs, etc. I can’t imagine that any American would want that.On the other hand Donald Trump will reduce our taxes and many job-killing regulations. He’ll eliminate the estate tax and reduce corporate taxes and simplify the tax code. He’ll renegotiate trade agreements that were unfavorable to the United States and bring jobs back into this country. Donald Trump will protect the Second Amendment, treat our vets right, and fix our depleted military. He will replace the dreadful obamacare and have a secure border to keep us safe. Moreover, Hillary’s own campaign manager emailed that “Hillary has begun to hate everyday Americans”. Donald Trump loves America.Surely even if you don’t accept that Hillary is a corrupt liar, you can see that Donald Trump’s plan for America is better for you and this great country than the policies of Hillary Clinton.
17 | Angie Sheffield | 30 | 10154771761871336_10154771784806336 | I am against Clinton for so many reasons but one thing I am against her is that she think it is right for women to have an abortion at 39 weeks I am so against abortions I can't even have kids and makes me mad that Clinton thinks it is right for abortions I am voting for Trump 100%
18 | Dawn Avila | 23 | 10154771761871336_10154771808856336 | I totally agree. I wouldn't mind a woman being President but I'm sorry, not her! She sets a bad example for a woman, much more a woman President! No thanks Hillary, we aren't that dumb.
19 | Rebecca K Hampton | 15 | 10154771761871336_1019568438165359 | I cannot believe there are so many stupid American women. Yes, I did say that. If you vote for someone just because their plumbing is the same as yours, your stupid.
20 | Tracy Pendleton Valenzuela | 14 | 10154771761871336_785486284922705 | Yes, she is female. And that's no reason to vote for her! HRC is not for women. Her female employees are paid less than men. She has destroyed the lives of many women. She just thinks women are more easily controlled and can't think for theirselves and therefore preys on them for votes. Trump pays his female employees higher salaries. Just look at both campaign managers.
21 | Terry Duffy | 21 | 10154771761871336_1019585008163702 | I have no problems with a woman..but for the love of god this woman cannot be it. Granted I'm voting Trump but people, wake up you don't vote for president based on color, race or gender. Clinton is way to corrupt
22 | Eric Greathouse | 16 | 10154771761871336_785480441589956 | Do you feel the ground shaking?  Perhaps the tremors?  Do you see the media squirming?  Do you see the nervous emperor?  Do you see the Washington establishment sweating? Don't be afraid it's just millions of your fellow Americans who are sick and tired of corruption in government and they are excited to vote! 🇺🇸
23 | Lisa Black | 22 | 10154771761871336_785480268256640 | It's been amazing how many of my female acquaintances have tried to shame me into voting for Hillary simply because she is a woman. I don't recall their enthusiasm for a female VP eight years ago.
24 | Sandee Boyer | 10 | 10154771761871336_1813663435571943 | Amen on that, Hillary does not represent me or any of my friends, we have dignity, respect for others, we don't lie, cheat or surround ourselves with others that do. We aren't perfect but we don't intentionally try to do wrong. I'm ashamed of her and her adulterous husband, this whole situation is an insult to Americans.
25 | Michael Watson | 12 | 10154771761871336_10154771782576336 | There is no way on earth that Hillary can be in the lead anywhere with the agenda she's spewing. Vote Hillary if you want, but don't you dare complian when this country falls into chaos.

5 | Dana Hammele | 1357 | 10154771426006336_428857853904901 | I wish you and Michelle Obama would refund the American taxpayer over $40-$50 million that you have already spent campaigning for a liar and corrupt criminal.
6 | Christian Gore | 692 | 10154771426006336_10154771583876336 | Hilary was endorsed by John Bachtell--national chair of the Communist Party USA. But you won't hear that from the Mainstream Media! Go on their party's website and see for yourself!

14 | Karen Labasan | 186 | 10154771426006336_428860717237948 | If clinton was so concerned she would put Americans FIRST and not bring in 60,000 plus Muslim refugees. Many of which practice sharia law. They treat women as possessions.
15 | Darcy Lynn | 162 | 10154771426006336_1438908872805766 | Go back to "work" and do what we are paying you to do‼️ Traitor‼️ Fraud‼️ You have divided this country more than any other leader and your criminal cohort Killary will do more of the same‼️

He said the real military, the ones not paid off or with dirty blood on their own hands, hate Hillary and know she will sell and kill off our country piece by piece. That right there should be enough for true patriotic Americans.
5 | Christopher Cook | 207 | 10154771385456336_10154771390746336 | Donald Trump will win tomorrows election in a landslide..Don't believe a word those polls paid for by biased left wing media orgainisations are saying..

8 | Kim Denton | 57 | 10154771385456336_10154771392746336 | I honestly had a dream last night and the U.S. was divided into two different "countries" ~ instead of having Parties we had Divisions. one was "We the Government" and the other was "For the People" The WEG states had high taxes, no borders, abortions as birth control, a lot of people weren't working, and it was utter chaos. The FTP side had lower taxes, booming economy, government wasn't involved with people's lives as much, and the borders were protected from everyone trying to come in. It was truly peaceful. That's how divided this country is. I'm so ashamed she is the first female nominee. Lady Justice has been stabbed with her own sword.
9 | June Carbo | 31 | 10154771385456336_10154771401651336 | EVERY DOG HAS HIS DAY!!!! Crooked Clinton will get what she has coming to her. Someone so evil and corrupt can not continue to get away with lying and cheating.

12 | Stacy Jones | 15 | 10154771385456336_10154771423001336 | Republicans need to unite behind Trump, even if they feel the need to hold their nose when they vote. This may be the best chance to win the White House and put any conservative justices on the Supreme Court for a long time. The demographics are trending towards the Democrats in national elections. It may be now or never...

14 | Barbara Brown | 22 | 10154771385456336_10154771407481336 | One of the things I like best I like best about Donald Trump I the way he communicates and cares about his supporters. He actually talks with them. Trump is aware of what happens in front of him. He stops the rally to get help for distressed participants. Trump listens and responds to his supporters. TRUMP CARES ABOUT US.
15 | Costa Lucci | 17 | 10154771385456336_10154771420771336 | God made a man made for greatness ! This man is Donald Trump . A man with morals , great strength and love for our country ! WE as Christian soldiers cannot allow the evil to take this away !
16 | Anita Lynn Salyers | 8 | 10154771385456336_10154771535446336 | i have a question after watching and hearing this man many times make such great speaches why would anyone want to vote for a clinton?? hillary is for late term abortion.hillary let those men die and could have helped but did not.hillary said she was gonna put a lot of coal miners out of a job.what is going to happen to what few jobs that are here when she has open borders?and when she brings in all the refugess she wants to allow to come in??she don't want prayer back in schools she wants to take  gun rights,it has been proven over and over she is a liar.she has a lot of medical problems,and she could not keep her husband in line .when they was in the white house before what make's anyone think a women of her age and state of mind can run a country?bill clinton was impeached when he was in the white house as president and now people want to vote her in as president well where is bill going ??right back to the white house. this is a disgrace to american people and to our children that are coming up to know that we would elect such stuff as they are doing back into the white house for a second time,,,,
17 | Nikhil Saha | 16 | 10154771385456336_10154771415526336 | Mr. Trump should buy about an hour prime time on national TV and address for the nation on today, 11/07/2016, this is a one life time opportunity for him and America. He will have a landslide like Reagan.
18 | Niki Haugen Cradick | 15 | 10154771385456336_10154771429841336 | 'Twas the night before the election, when all through the White House, everyone was scrambling to keep the Republicans out.The polls were all placed in the schools with care, in hopes that the voters soon would be there.The voters were restless all snug in their beds.While visions of the trump train danced in their heads.And I in my pjs and papa in his cap, had just settled our brains for a long nights nap.When out from the T.V. arose such a clatter, I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter. Away to the couch I flew like a flash, I sat on the seat and threw my feet up in a dash. The channel was on Fox News, my new favorite shows, I like all the anchors, but Megyn Kelly can go.When what to my wondering eyes should appear, but a miniature Reagan with eight tiny reindeer. He said he was in shock with all that was going on. We must win this race against this con. And he whistled and shouted and called the states by name!  Now Florida, Now North Carolina, now Nevada, and Iowa. On Colorado, on Wisconsin, on Pennsylvania, on Michigan! To the top of the line! To the top of the wall! Now dash away! Dash away and go vote you all! How can you vote for a liar a thief. How can you choose her for your commander-in-chief. She's corrupt as they come with a voice that's so shrill. With her disappearing emails, she should be in jail. It's time for a change, let's drain the swamp, let's make America great again. And have a Trump romp.As he was done with his speech, he gave a thumbs up and said don't forget tomorrow, to go vote for Trump. But I heard him explain as he went out of sight, God Bless America and to all a good night.
19 | Mark Cavazos | 6 | 10154771385456336_10154771477361336 | She panders for votes. What do Jay Z and Beyonce think of the economy or ACA premiums? What does Pharell think of the Russian reset? What do Miley and Katy think of her tax plan and if it will stimulate jobs? You get my point. I hope and pray that others will too.
20 | Madison Jones | 9 | 10154771385456336_10154771536841336 | Why do your reporters keep saying the majority of Trump supporters are non-college educated whites! Saying that on Fox news right now, like were all some backwoods toothless inbreeds. That is NOT ACCURATE.
21 | Darla Kelsey | 5 | 10154771385456336_10154771420106336 | If your lower middle class and have a job,, you cant get food stamps or free ins,, if your poor and no job you get it all.So middle class goes away,, with Hilary you go up to 45% taxes,, How will you buy food or put gas in the car to go to work? MIght at well sit out,, only way to cover kids ins, Trump will change Obama care and drop taxes to 15%,, we need the money in our pocket
22 | Jim Spedden | 9 | 10154771385456336_10154771398516336 | Bottom line for me:Hillary Clinton thinks half of American's are "deplorable". She will never be recognized as President by half of America. And then there is the corruption...America deserves better. Much better.Trump/Pence 2016 ⚖️🇺🇸We the People deserve a President of, by and for ALL Americans.
23 | Mary Easterly | 10 | 10154771385456336_10154771408411336 | And this is what Beyonce got in thanks from Hillary...but then why not, she paid for their appearance (wrote a check for $62 Million) to draw a crowd who left after the concert. This from Hillary's live mic that she didn't know was on:During Friday Night’s Hillary Clinton rally in Ohio, Beyonce was performing when she suddenly stopped singing. She turned towards the side of the stage where Hillary was standing and said, “You’re in my earpiece.”Clinton, looking surprised, gave a smile and started clapping. Beyonce’ continued her performance but cut it short after just two songs. She was seen storming off stage and leaving the venue in a limousine shortly thereafter.A reporter from the local Parma Gazette asked around and found out from a sound tech that Clinton’s lapel mic was hot and all of the staff were listening when she said:“I’m grateful, but do we really need to listen to this ghetto trash music? Doesn’t she have something a little less…negro?”The Clinton campaign refused calls for comment and the roadie who gave the original report is now nowhere to be found
24 | Barry Ford | 3 | 10154771385456336_731525877010013 | Commander-in-Cheat Don the Con is a sexual predator!  His deplorable followers believe he's a god but, Donnie Trump is a shameless  con artist who has built an empire by not paying taxes, bilking people with fake businesses, fake universities, fake charities and, now, a fake campaign.He didn't even write The Art of the deal!Don the Con is a total fraud and this is the short list!
25 | Artie Blaquiere | 4 | 10154771385456336_10154771520201336 | "The 2016 election has proven, once and for all, that there’s almost nothing Christian about the Republican party. When these self-proclaimed supporters of 'Christian values' had a chance to rebuke one of the most non-Christian candidates we’ve ever seen run for president, not only did they not soundly reject him — they overwhelmingly and enthusiastically embraced him." - Allen Clifton

1 | Vishnu Shal | 6740 | 10154771215046336_10154771285436336 | Being from India and watching in i cannot believe how biased the corporate run media is...even here in India and Europe the only headlines we read are the ones attacking Trump in this one sided election, never any articles about Benghazi or the trail of blood and destruction Obama and Clinton have left across Syria and the Middle East, so much for responsible informed journalism and impartiality...sickening. Trump 2016
2 | Cullyn-Casey Corley | 4057 | 10154771215046336_10154771287701336 | It's a shame that Democrat voters don't vote on issues such as jobs, the economy, and security...They vote for the candidate who has the most celebrity backing... Low info voters.
3 | Ruben M. Carreri | 2743 | 10154771215046336_10154771290446336 | Hypocrisy is complaining about sexual remarks made by Mr. Trump and then having one of the most sexually deviant individuals in modern pop culture promoting your campaign.
4 | Rebecca Suzanne Willey | 1890 | 10154771215046336_10154771298416336 | YET lady Gaga who stands strong for the LGBT crowd, will endorse a candidate who excepts $$ from countries that behead and burn gay people alive on a daily basis🤔

6 | Stuart T Bapties | 1209 | 10154771215046336_10154771286946336 | In REAL news, Janet Reno dies today.   A reminder of the last time the Clintons were in office and appointed an Attorney General who ordered a Massacre by Federal Law Enforcement Officers on American Soil in Waco.  Ultimately murdering and burning 80 men, women, and children alive. Ordered heavily armed men to Invade a private home in Florida and drag a little boy out of his family homes closet at gunpoint on national television....
7 | Kevin Burkett | 815 | 10154771215046336_10154771288266336 | yeah, another hollywood elitest who thinks their opinion matters more...i still cant believe that they think people take their ideas into consideration #GFY
8 | Shane Beals | 840 | 10154771215046336_10154771287096336 | Have you noticed that the Democrats are the biggest bullies and bigots in the world. They're absolutely corrupt they always deflect because they're the ones that are doing wrong
9 | Vishnu Shal | 483 | 10154771215046336_10154771282456336 | The only man that will stop terrorism in the United States is Donald Trump all the rest of these candidates are terrorists themselves and deserve nothing but an exit out of this country Donald Trump is the answer to America and everybody that supports Donald Trump will be safe and secure for the rest of his term So Wake up my american friends and vote for trump
10 | Jean Marie | 412 | 10154771215046336_10154771285961336 | In less than 17 months, Donald Trump has gone from never running for an office to knocking on the door of the presidency. 17 short months! Just think how he can Make America Great Again. It won't be 8 years of floundering which we have seen and lived. My prediction given his record: we will be set on a path to record job growth, stable foreign policy and economic success in less than four years and then he won't run for a second term. He will have done his job and fulfilled his promises. You can't ask for more than that! Vote wisely. Vote Trump!
11 | Scott Brown | 230 | 10154771215046336_10154771293306336 | Lady Gaga is either too stupid of just intellectually dishonest to not understand the difference between defending yourself and bullying. Trump is not a bully.

14 | Michelle Serbst | 103 | 10154771215046336_10154771293071336 | Who f....cares about Lady GAGA, I thought the WOMAN'S movement was to respect each other no matter what, oh ya I forgot only if they are LIBERALS...

"I hear that Trump train a comin’ It’s rollin’ round the bend. Gonna pick up Mrs. Clinton And take her to prison.  They’ll have her coronation Make her cell block queen Hillary for prison... two thousand and sixteen They’ve got an orange pants suit Hangin’ on the wall And a cell for Bubba Willie Just a little down the hall. We’ll put ‘em in the big house Lock them up inside. Unless a whole lot of witnesses Commit suicide. Remember James McDougal And 20 or 30 more About to testify, they found ‘em dead upon the floor. Now they’re pilin’ up the bodies Like they did back then They want back in the White House Here we go again. Glue the china to the table Nail the table to the floor Lock up all the silver‘fore they haul it out the door White trash in the White House Beats all I’ve ever seen. Hillary for prison two thousand and sixteen."Lady Gaga....move to Tunisia with all the other liberal minded fruitcakes
16 | Jon Hunt | 51 | 10154771215046336_554802218049905 | Lady Gaga is a nut case who herself just bullied Trump's wife. That is the most ignorant thing I've ever seen somebody do with my life. I'm curious to see Lady Gaga's psychology eval.
17 | Lauren Williams | 45 | 10154771215046336_1642057186093380 | Lady Gaga, the sexual deviant making that remark. Too funny. A woman that allows people to stroke her lady bits on stage. Get out of here! Lmao
18 | Giulio Braga | 105 | 10154771215046336_10154771286596336 | Obama and Hillary Clinton, in just eight years, have been able to mess up everything they only touched: this is true about the USA - think about it... Social conflicts erupted everywhere (racial, religious, sexual orientation conflicts, instrumental and childish insults to the flag and the hymn, etc.), conflicts that led to divisions even where reigned harmony and peace, conflicts which even went so far to the heart of institutions, cowardly attacking police officers, who represen the whole Country engaged in the defense of the law and protection of the weakest.The jobs and the flow of money that should feed the population end up instead in some other nation, and the national health care program has only revealed a heap of promises and lies, and the price will be paid by you own, by the people who were to be protected, but were teasing instead.Abroad, if possible, is even worse, with entire nations devastated and left in the hands of Islamic terrorism (with which these governments have had ambiguous attitude, to say the very least ), Libya, Iran, Iraq, Syria are messed up in such a way, that it will take decades to try to have a balance comparable to just eight years ago, and we have never been closer to a conflict Russia since a very long time.Think of your life as it was before the duo Obama / Clinton began their work, think how it was the whole world ... continue to keep in mind this difference when you go to vote, and remind your truth to all the people who you can tell. We don't want the world to end up permanently in the hands of those who just want to transform it in an inanimate desert filled by conflict and poverty.Think about it. Thank you - #TrumpPence #MAGA
19 | Linda Thompson | 28 | 10154771215046336_1570753426302158 | Lady Gaga is another rich hypocritical Hollywood Elitist.No class She should do her homework Hillary excepts money from Countries who oppress women, murder children,christians,and Gays!!!!Who's the Bully?
20 | Jammie Smith | 39 | 10154771215046336_554800408050086 | You mean this lady gaga who participates in satanic rituals? Nice lady, she should totally be taken seriously. http://magafeed.com/jay-z-lady-gaga-seen-with-spirit-cooking-author-maria-abramovic/
21 | Dwayne Lowe | 29 | 10154771215046336_1892257787685786 | Hey lady gaga. You wanna know who's likely a bigger bully then trump? Try the lying sea hag hillary clinton. Especially the women she intimidated/threatend because of bill fooling around with them including one Monica lewinsky.The only reason celebrities like you, katy perry and others want hillary as president is because you're too naive to see past her phony smile. She's an evil, vindictive woman. And it has nothing to do with gender it has to do with personality and she has the personality of mud.
22 | Jeff Markway | 24 | 10154771215046336_1892258571019041 | To shame Melania for wanting to start an anti-bullying campaign, when she becomes First Lady, is appalling. She's not her husband. And what I find far more hypocritical and disturbing is the fact Hillary takes campaign funds/donations, and donations to the corrupt Clinton foundation, from countries that fund/support terrorism, treat woman as second class citizens/animals, and murder gays all while pretending to fight for the rights of those same ppl...
23 | Kathleen Famiglietti | 48 | 10154771215046336_10154771290611336 | Fox News thinks this is news and posted this today before the election. Who cares what Lady Gaga says! How about today sticking to the issues?
24 | Ashley Newby Maxwell | 25 | 10154771215046336_10154771311411336 | Never had much respect for Lady Gaga or also known as "...." 😳 I really don't know her actual name and what leads me to believe I can't trust her opinion. Anyone who has to hide behind a name can not be real inside.
25 | Brian Evans | 34 | 10154771215046336_554811084715685 | So I guess by Lady Gag's logic, Huma Abedin is just as much of a worthless creepy pedophile as her husband & Hillary is just as much of a creepy rapist and sexual abuser as pervy Bill. Glad she cleared that up! 😉

1 | Ronnie Hubbs | 3659 | 10154771172291336_10154771177801336 | These polls are so funny. Hold on the landslide is coming!
2 | Mike Rashid | 2866 | 10154771172291336_10154771175706336 | I get a chuckle out of the libtards thinking that the Hildebeast will win because the FBI closed one of the two cases they have her on. Trump voters outnumber the brain dead by millions. We got this! #spiritcooking #lolitaexpress #wikileaks #projectveritas #draintheswamp
3 | Laressa Reese | 1895 | 10154771172291336_10154771180961336 | Why on earth would anyone want Hillary in office....Makes no sense. People need to do their research!!! It's a crying shame. I guess the American people like our country going down the drain :(
4 | Wayne R Johnson | 1201 | 10154771172291336_10154771175146336 | FBI Speed Reads 650,000 emails in eight days. Blatant Obvious Corruption. Treating Americans as gullible idiots. We don't have to take it!TRUMP/PENCEOur only chance to take our country back!
5 | Michael A DeGennaro | 980 | 10154771172291336_10154771183751336 | The election is tomorrow here are my thoughts if Hillary wins. If Hillary wins we will never have another Republican President. We will be known now as the United Socialist States of America, a permanent one party government. The country will have been stolen by the liberal entitlement-minded Democrats who believe that democracy means taking from everybody else. Republicans will forever be outnumbered by the entitlement crowd who do not believe in the principles that made this country the greatest and most powerful country on earth. While we working people begin filling the outstretched hands of the "gimme mines" class, Republicans may as well begin closing their doors as we begin this new road to self-destruction. They will never again overcome a block of voters that will soon constitute over 50% of the population receiving entitlements. "Socialism works great until you run out of other people's money." - Margaret Thatcher. Refugees, extremists, and illegal immigrants will poor into our once great nation forever changing it. Christians will be persecuted and the word under God will be removed. Lawlessness will take hold and Americans will be targeted in their homes and out in public. Look to Europe to see your glorious future, for you are now them. Enjoy the scenery when you've reached your destination. Patriots who love this country like Donald Trump will be the biggest losers Wednesday morning. Hillary Clinton and Obama with their socialist supporters and mentors Bill Ayers and George Soros will have achieved their greatest victory. They held out a carrot and the Democrats bought it. It will not just be a sad day, it will be a tragic day and it will be on a grand scale. On the bright side, Republicans will never again need to bother to vote. So save America and Vote Trump! God Bless Donald Trump!

The Constitution of the United States has been abused and distorted for the last eight years. Without the Constitution, America is just another lawless communist country like the ones who many flee. We must fight for our freedoms and children's future. Let's preserve everything the brave men and women of our great nation fought and still fight for, the Constitution. On November 8th, we should all vote for #TrumpPence16. Let's #MAGA and #DrainTheSwamp God Bless America! God Bless Us All! God Bless Donald J. Trump and Mike Pence, their families and team!
9 | Anthony Peter Moore | 216 | 10154771172291336_10154771181766336 | If I don't vote for Hillary, it wouldn't be because of her nature. It would because of the nature of her associates and how she deals with them. Time and time again, her name is getting caught up in the scandals and actions of unsavory types of people. If she cannot distance her name from their actions, how could she distance the nation from the actions of other unsavory entities?

11 | Carlos A Mercado | 190 | 10154771172291336_10154771183891336 | Imagine it is November 9, 2016 in America and we wake up knowing who our new President will be. If it is Hillary, think of the groups of people that will celebrate. Illegal Immigrants, criminals and future criminals who will be supported for pulling a gun on a police officer, planned parenthood, the media, and the list goes on and on that represent everything that is wrong with America. If you're still "with her," look around at who you'll be celebrating with. Now imagine waking up knowing that Trump is our new President. You may or may not like him, or really know what kind of president he will be. But here are some things you will know for sure:• The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.• The media has been neutered forever.• Career politicians will have lost all job security.• The guns in your home will safely stay there.• Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.• Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally• Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.• No more apologies to the world for being great!• Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.• Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.• There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.• The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.• The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.Copy and paste this as your status if you support and will vote Donald Trump for president 2016. #trump2016.

It has changed my view on people in general....I have to seriously question their morals and values.  I fear for this country.

However, if you want jobs, you love your country, your want law and order, you want a better future for your kids, you want the US to be respected again, you want peace, high wages, less foreign interference, a safer nation, better relations with other countries, less corruption and more transparency, then you need to vote for Trump.

At least have the decency to thank their families for their service and say a prayer! You all have done exactly what Obama and Hillary want, disrespect those who just gave their lives to defend you! To the families I'm sorry for your loss many prayers to you all. 😢
20 | Wayne Wittik | 11 | 10154770995506336_10154771020916336 | I believe that because Obama does not allow the generals to fight the war the way they want too, Obama is responsible for these deaths
21 | Judy Gulledge | 8 | 10154770995506336_10154771105321336 | But we are not at war. The president only send a few at a time so he doesn't have to get permission - but they are in war zones - fighting - and the dead are still dead. Shame on this presidnet for his callous behavior and lack of respect for our people.
22 | Aaron Pastora | 6 | 10154770995506336_10154771016431336 | this is Obama legacy what Clinton is talking about "Americans get kill and nothing happen" remember old days this was unacceptable.
23 | Barbara Connors | 11 | 10154770995506336_1147679655279460 | You can bet Obama and Hillary will not mention a word of this at their rallies, they never mention the police officers that were shot down over the weekend or last week. Trump always mentions it and Pence had a moment of silence for them. Trump-Pence leaders we can be proud of.

Janet Reno, the first woman to serve as U.S. attorney general and someone who was at the forefront of several scandals during the Clinton administration has died, her goddaughter said. Reno was 78. http://fxn.ws/2f8PYvE
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Alice Matthews | 1295 | 10154770913561336_10154770918901336 | She died with blood on her hands. Remember Waco. Sad day in American history.
2 | Bob Destefano | 1104 | 10154770913561336_10154770929146336 | Janet Reno is proof that being the first anything doesn't mean you'll be good at it. Guess she's finally taking responsibility for waco and ruby ridge, now.
3 | Dallas DeBurger | 451 | 10154770913561336_10154770972191336 | I'm old enough to remember all the Clinton scandals under Janet Reno...Waco, file gate, Julian Gonzalez, whitewater, bungling at the FBI laboratory, alleged Chinese nuclear spying, questionable campaign financing in the 1996 Clinton-Gore re-election. There's NO WAY I'd vote to put another Clinton in the White House again!
4 | Syed Hassan Rizvi | 518 | 10154770913561336_10154770916516336 | I'm completely and utterly confused... how can a candidate for president who is under 2 active FBI criminal investigations even be able to continue campaigning at this point?! Have we no decency as a nation?! She's making history alright, and not in a good way. #VoteTrump
5 | Eileen Tharp | 329 | 10154770913561336_10154770933046336 | You're out jogging one day and step in dog poo. You go home and you think that you've cleaned your shoes, but theirs still a stench to them. That's how people feel about the Clintons and all the corrupt crap that surrounds them. They are that stench. Rotten inside and out.
6 | David Benoit | 139 | 10154770913561336_10154770945191336 | Might just have been the worst attorney general in the history of The U.S. However...Lynch is threatening to take the title.
7 | Jill Smith-Werner | 157 | 10154770913561336_10154770929986336 | I hope this women was a Godly women who asked for some serious forgiveness after WACO and who knows what else she was involved in.... in the words of Pretty Little Liars.... "Two can keep a Secret if one of them is dead."
8 | Roberto Nowak | 104 | 10154770913561336_10154770931131336 | Her dim bulb will shine forever on Waco. Just another unqualified yes man appointed to clean up the Clinton Crime Syndicate's bidding.
9 | Larry Van Dyke | 67 | 10154770913561336_10154770947731336 | I'm sorry about her death but her incompetence was amazing. Waco the cult leader came into town every day for coffee he couldn't be arrested there no they had to lay siege to the compound killing females and children. The list is pretty long one of the members of the Clinton mafia. I do feel bad and my thoughts go out to her friends and family.
10 | Albert Coburn | 62 | 10154770913561336_10154770929621336 | She , on orders from the inside of the White House (Hillary), was responsible for the murders of 53 men, women and CHILDREN , so they "could go after guns",it is my hope that she came to the saving Grace of Lord Jesus Christ
11 | Randy Coleman | 86 | 10154770913561336_10154770918166336 | They are going to cheat for her and let her be president!!! Hillary supporters wanting to make history yeah they going to make history alright they going see bombs flying over there heads cuz Russia is taking out isis supporters yes Hillary is a isis supporter
12 | Helena Isabella Hawthorne | 41 | 10154770913561336_10154770949306336 | Hillary has already warned Russia about Syria, and they are already gearing up for war if Hillary wins this election. So, yeah, go on and vote for Hillary. You won't have to worry about getting a job or paying for Obama care anymore. You will be left out in the open while Hillary and the rest of the elite hide down in the underground bunkers that your tax dollars paid for. Why? Russiahas kicked out the global elite bankers so they must be punished. Remember that on election day.
13 | Shelley Powers-Tribby | 47 | 10154770913561336_10154770993191336 | Just ANOTHER Attorney General that protected a "Clinton"!!! Let that sink in!Recall, Reno in Contempt of Congress for not turning over documents in the Bill Clinton & Lewinsky Case!!!

16 | Orlando Arrom | 31 | 10154770913561336_10154770946551336 | I went outside and screamed out loud in anger on the Easter Sunday morning that she betrayed the peaceful Cuban community and sent in her goons to kidnap Elian Gonzalez and send him back to Castro.

17 | Roger Ely | 47 | 10154770913561336_10154770927521336 | One of Bill and Hillary Clinton's loyal henchmen who murdered 22 children under the age of 17 in Waco.

19 | Chris Shea | 23 | 10154770913561336_10154770989226336 | Good riddance. Another Clinton pawn with the blood of women and children on her hands GONE. Never will understand how people can forget what these MONSTERS were involved in. 😞 Apparently memory is foggy when it involves a particular party. If Reno had been a Republican, she'd have been roasted and devoured long ago.

21 | Christopher L Gilbert | 18 | 10154770913561336_10154771004201336 | That was then, this is now ...Janet Reno was Bill Clinton’s third pick for attorney general. He had promised to nominate a woman for the post, but his first two choices – corporate lawyer Zoe Baird and New York federal Judge Kimba Wood – withdrew following allegations they hired illegal immigrants as nannies.Today, not only would the candidate with an illegal maid not be hindered in her search for office, but the maid could handle classified documents, too!Today, our President could hire an illegal immigrant FOR Attorney General, and the press would attack anyone who questioned the legality of that.That truly was then, this really is now.
22 | Scott Rohde | 9 | 10154770913561336_10154771087691336 | If you are voting for Clinton for a social or single issue, if it's because she is female or because she has been in politics for her entire life. Do yourself a favor and educate yourself. Look into her track record concerning our military and veterans.Look into her track record concerning national security.Look into her track record concerning foreign policies.Look into her track record concerning women's equality.Look into her track record concerning domestic terrorism.Look into her track record concerning economics, health care and social security.Ask yourself do I love America? Ask yourself do I even care about the military members or do I just like to pay lip service.Vote for our country not your party or a single issue.
23 | David Lovely | 7 | 10154770913561336_10154771012816336 | She went to her grave knowing at least she wasn't the WORST attorney general, only the 3rd worst (behind the previous 2).She also cost Al Gore the presidency by forcing Elian Gonzalez back to Cuba just before the 2000 election and ticking off enough Cuban Exiles to hand Florida to George W. Bush.And her headstone will be covered with the blood of the children she was supposedly trying to "rescue" in Waco!
24 | Byron Sims | 6 | 10154770913561336_10154771041696336 | Jesus, you people and your minions are shameless! Seriously, how are you even legally allowed to refer to yourselves as a "news" organization? Let me fix this for you. "Janet Reno, the first woman to serve as U.S. attorney general has died, according to her Goddaughter. Ms. Reno served as Attorney General from 1993-2001. She was 78 years old."
25 | Lloyd Hart | 6 | 10154770913561336_10154770981031336 | Janet Reno is the person most responsible for all the death and destruction the US has inflicted on the world in the last 16 years with it's phony "War On Terror". As US Attorney General, she didn't lift a finger to investigate the theft of election 2000 and the subsequent suborning of the US Supreme Court by the Bush Campaign because the Clintons bribed and blackmailed her off the case. Janet Reno, coward to the grave.

2 | Randy Coleman | 539 | 10154770885901336_10154770899851336 | They are going to cheat for her and let her be president!!! Hillary supporters wanting to make history yeah they going to make history alright they going see bombs flying over there heads cuz Russia is taking out isis supporters yes Hillary is a isis supporter
3 | Dave Rynearson | 223 | 10154770885901336_10154770935921336 | Tommorrow could end up being the saddest day in American history. If corrupt Clinton is voted in it will show the world how many Americans have lost their moral compass. It will also show that the corrupt have taken over America!
4 | Debbie Hoover | 197 | 10154770885901336_10154770917246336 | Vote Trump on Tuesday, so we don't have to have someone in the White House who will lie, cheat, steal to get what she wants. You have no choice but to vote for Trump if you want a better America!!
5 | Steve Lowry | 554 | 10154770885901336_10154770897056336 | I would like to remind Donald Trump that the system is not rigged instead you will lose because you are unfit, unstable, unprepared, a bully, a tax cheat, a pervert, a racist, narcissist, shallow, a person that have no respect for women or disabled people. and even worse hes a heartless individual.
6 | Christina Carrelli | 106 | 10154770885901336_10154770902601336 | Wow love how some think this is a joke people are one of the reasons why our country is as bad as it is but I will say this if the CURRUPTION gets in I hope all the drugs and illegals that come in affect Hillary supporter homes and not mine you get what you ask for just remember that!!!!!!
7 | Cayden Wayne May | 105 | 10154770885901336_10154770900531336 | Ok so comey and his folks say they read all of the 650,000 emails in 9 days. Seeing that there are 777,600 seconds in 9 days. That's less than 1 second per email. If you divide 650,000 by 9 that's 72,222. There are 86,164 seconds in a day. So this clown is supposed to get me to believe that All of the emails were read? Really?????
8 | Jack Rougeaux | 75 | 10154770885901336_10154770949406336 | Donald Trump had a rally in Moon Township Pennsylvania last night. 15,000 supporters were inside with thousands more outside . Huge traffic jams. Per KDKA News Pittsburgh PA. Hillary Clinton was in Ohio with 500 at her rally, Tim Kaine had 30 people at his rally. An the news media claims Trump is down in the polls mmmmmmmm
9 | Christy Bogan | 73 | 10154770885901336_10154770934541336 | What i wanna know is why President Obama is out campaigning begging people to continue his legacy when the American people are getting gouged with his Obamacare. He should be on high alert with this. No one can afford these premiums!
10 | Cristy Cook Wells | 35 | 10154770885901336_10154770897096336 | I believe he is too. But I'm puzzled by the media's polls. Then again I'm surrounded by Hoosiers who support Trump. Not sure what all the buzz is in other states. Anyone out there in Florida or California that see an abundance of Trump support???
11 | Michael Perry | 34 | 10154770885901336_10154770944526336 | Tomorrow is the day we’ve been waiting so very long forTomorrow is the day we can tell the career politicians we’re tired of being ignoredTomorrow is the day we can tell the lobbyists and special interest groups we’ve had enoughTomorrow is the day we can tell the mainstream media we’ve had enough of their liesTomorrow is the day we can tell Democrats we are tired of their constant divisiveness and holier than thou opinions of themselves and the hypocrisy the feel they are immune toTomorrow is the day we can tell the GOP establishment we are tired of them not fighting for usTomorrow is the day we can tell corporate America we are tired of them shipping our jobs awayTomorrow is the day we can tell the PC police that we are tired of being handcuffed and want our freedom of speech and expression backTomorrow is the day we can tell the globalists that we want to put America first before anyone elseTomorrow is the day we can remind everyone in Washington that no one is above the law and actions have consequences.Tomorrow is the day we can Make America Great AgainThis will likely be the most important election that many of us vote in for the rest of our lives, staying home is not an option for ANYONE especially those in swing states, more is at stake than some may realize. Approach tomorrow as if no traditionally red state is safe, no traditionally blue state is unwinnable, and as if Trump is down in every swing state and can only win if we turnout tomorrow We might NEVER (and I use that in the most absolute sense of the word) get a chance like this again. Tomorrow is our Brexit moment. When you walk into that ballot box tomorrow, double check and triple check and quadruple check your ballot to be absolutely certain that Trump gets your vote and avoid electronic ballots when possible (they shouldn’t be trusted in light of all the dishonesty we’ve seen), Hillary and her supporters want to win for their obvious reasons and Never Trumpers and establishment Republicans want to say to us “We told you he couldn’t win, next time listen to us and nominate someone like Jeb” tomorrow is their last desperate chance to stop not only Trump but US as well.So fellow deplorables, irredeemables basement dwellers, superpredators, tacobowlers, needy Latinos, and any other reprehensible name we’ve been called by Hillary and her lackeys over the years, lets unite one final time tomorrow with the common cause to Make America Great Again!P.S. I hope this message goes viral because it is one I feel needs to be heard
12 | Ginger Spelts | 27 | 10154770885901336_10154770913956336 | We are going to see something amazing happen tomorrow. We are going to see huge Trump supporters standing in line tomorrow all over this country. We have been waiting so long for this. We want real change, real jobs, real healthcare, real justice, we want law & order, we want our veterans taking care of, tired of seeing politicians get richer and richer off the backs of hard working Americans. YES!! We want a leader who is going to put America and Americans first for a change! A leader who is going to secure our borders and keep us safe! Yes!! Huge crowds, millions and millions will turn out for Donald J Trump tomorrow and we will make America great again!! #TRUMP2016
13 | Paula-Lawson N Casey-Knight | 15 | 10154770885901336_10154770969201336 | Christian's, are you praying? Tomorrow is the day. God tells us that if we pray, and seek Him, and turn from our wicked ways He WILL answer us and WILL heal our land. I urge you to pray today. Pray without ceasing. Pray every time you think about it. Beg Him for mercy on behalf of our country. God is merciful and He is faithful. And no matter who wins tomorrow, He is ALWAYS in control. "If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land." 2 Chronicles 7:14

I just like to know why our tax money is being put to these planes flying around all over campaigning for Hillary Clinton
16 | Sunnie Maracle | 11 | 10154770885901336_10154770938181336 | God bless you,Sarah and ty.Clinton's are sitting on a highly explosive bomb of a sexual pedophile ring with killarys knowledge& participation.Lynch has her gag order in place.This is a movement folks whether you are Jewish,Christian,catholic,it doesn't matter.its in the book of revelations,these apostates of hell.Vote Trump,vote God& country
17 | Mary OBrien | 16 | 10154770885901336_10154770933981336 | From her lips to God's ear! Hillary Clinton is guilty. She knows it, the FBI knows it, the people know it, and now it’s up to the American people to deliver justice at the ballot box on November 8,” Trump!!!
18 | Tammy Kreitzer | 12 | 10154770885901336_10154770919206336 | This is the woman I wish would of been our first woman president. Unless you know Trump personally than you shouldn't b making comments of things you've read about or the ridiculous ads on tv that Hillary spent billions on from money she received from her crooked foundation. She has received money from foreign enemies and for some weird reason destroyed emails that may of contained secured information that has caused a national security risk. Why you would vote for her over Trump due to personality and things women have said is crazy.
19 | Christy Bogan | 9 | 10154770885901336_10154770969846336 | I just saw a news clip of President Obama encouraging an illegal alien to not be afraid to vote!!!! Now if that is not rigging what is!!! Now I believe the lady in Cali who claims that when she votes she always sees bussed in from out of the country!!! Voters!!!
20 | Kelly Kapoor | 9 | 10154770885901336_1794810270790915 | You are right Sarah ! They cannot stop him, they cannot stop the momentum because even Mr. Trump cannot stop what he started. He is our modern day Gandhi who has started revolution with Trump plane, rally and Twitter. Mr. Trump has charisma and deliberateness like Gandhi, Kennedy and Reagan. He believes in America first ! Millions of American citizens want corruption free government. USA , USA🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
21 | John Fabiano | 10 | 10154770885901336_1790685917852295 | I have never been more disgusted in a presidential election in my entire life. Comey once again paid off by the Clinton campaign. He said the new emails would take months to review.... But took a week to conclude Hillary was not guilty. The system is #Rigged but not to worry the silent majority will have the FINAL say on Tuesday.
22 | Tyler Crouse | 3 | 10154770885901336_1776756945905457 | Lmao because Fox News knows the truth. Heres the truth Fox News watchers: •Donald trump was not about to assasinated in Nevada like Fox News said, the guy was holding up a sign•Donald trump has been in an interview saying he has no clue what he'll do about isis •Donald trump cannot build a wall and make Mexico Pay, because that will require the UN to be involved•Donald trump has offered no solutions for the ideas he has•he's not a self started billionaire he's basically Jaden Smith with a comb over•If he had invested his "small loan" of a million dollars instead he'd have 14 billion instead of 2•Hillary actually has government experience and the knowledge, to know how it gets done in politics. •Fox News you are literally a laughing stock in the journalism community, no one likes you•no one is going to take your guns, despite what your precious NRA says. Go ahead and get mad, your anger shows true colors
23 | Andy Rodriguez | 8 | 10154770885901336_1790683837852503 | America is at a crossroad.......we can let Hillary name new Supreme Court Justices and ensure no conservative view ever gets a pass again in our lifetime.....or, we can elect Trump and ensure Conservative Justices control the Court for the next generation.......we can let Hillary continue with open borders allowing anyone who wants to come here cross......or, we can elect Trump and close our borders to everyone but those who come here legally......we can allow Hillary to continue restrictive policies and regulations that keep small businesses from being able to prosper.......or, we can elect Trump who will reduce regulations that stifle small business and allow them to grow and prosper and create millions of new jobs.......we can allow Hillary to continue with Obamacare and ruin our health care system......or, we can elect Trump and end Obamacare and allow citizens to purchase policies that are tailored to their individual families by crossing state line to force the 1500 Health Insurance Companies to compete for their business.......we can allow Hillary to restrict our 2nd Amendment rights........Or, we can elect Trump who will uphold our 2nd Amendment rights.......................we can allow Hillary to continue policies that force black families to be bound to the failed schools in their communities.....or, we can elect Trump who will give vouchers to allow families in areas with failing schools to go to schools that will provide a better education for their children......we can allow Hillary to continue to cut our military.....or, we can elect Trump who will rebuild our military and make us safe from foreign aggressors......we can allow Hillary to continue to weaken local law enforcement agencies.......or, we can elect Trump who will back our police departments and keep our communities safe.......we can allow Hillary to continue to allow drugs to come across our borders.......or, we can elect Trump who will ensure that drugs and criminals do not freely cross our borders..........we can allow Hillary to continue to distract us with things Trump has said............or, we can elect Trump who will end the actual corruption and criminality of the Hillary era......................we have a moral obligation to ensure that Hillary is not allowed to continue policies that are turning our country into a nation unlike third world nations......we have a moral obligation to elect Trump the next President of the United States so that America can be Made Great Again....................VOTE TRUMP........and.....you get a bonus......He will work for Term Limits for Congress...
24 | Beth Ann Layton | 4 | 10154770885901336_1803206253284155 | This is very interesting. I came across this person's post on a News article and WOW if this doesn't say a lot....For those who wonder what America looks like to others.... Vishnu Shal Being from India and watching in i cannot believe how biased the corporate run media is...even here in India and Europe the only headlines we read are the ones attacking Trump in this one sided election, never any articles about Benghazi or the trail of blood and destruction Obama and Clinton have left across Syria and the Middle East, so much for responsible informed journalism and impartiality...sickening. Trump 2016
25 | Barbara Thomason | 3 | 10154770885901336_1790693897851497 | I have watched other channels and other channels are reporting on both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump's issues my problem with Fox news in the morning they do nothing but report on Hillary Clinton's emails. My last word is God help this country no matter who gets in office.

1 | Marco Deo | 3676 | 10154769819726336_10154770706571336 | If you are voting for Hillary becuz of Trumps locker room talk ,do us a favor and stay home, you have no clue what it takes to run a nation.
2 | Lisa Fields | 1698 | 10154769819726336_10154770708681336 | Here's my take on Comey I think he is making sure we are all ticked off so we get out and VOTE Trump to get this corruption cleared up. First of all he came out in July with his hands tied by the DOJ and laid out every reason Hillary should be prosecuted and did nothing . To remind everyone he wrote the letter to the Hill saying they may have new evidence the once again nothing .How many of us are ticked now Get out and VOTE TRUMP he's right again the system is rigged. Just saying
3 | Ruth E. Brown | 1052 | 10154769819726336_10154770722991336 | So tomorrow America chooses between a successful businessman with a less than politically correct mouth or yet another corrupt lying career politician.  Remember the definition of insanity... doing the same thing over & over again & expecting a different result.
4 | Dolores Lutz | 618 | 10154769819726336_10154770717616336 | That's because they are protecting Obama because he's just as guilty as Hillary and to prosecute Hillary they would have to prosecutor Obama and justice department is owned by Obama
5 | Earl Franklin Clemons Jr | 684 | 10154769819726336_10154770712121336 | I am puzzled at the unprecedented behavior for an outgoing POTUS to be so foamed-at-the-mouth raging over one of the candidates campaigning to take his place. Barack Hussein Obama has made a fool out of himself for the past 8 years...why must he feel the urge to make himself look even more pathetic by being such a Trump basher? No POTUS in our history has ever shown this much rage...he is an embarrassment to our country both domestically and on the world stage. What are you so afraid of Obama? Would it be that should Trump be elected than We the People will finally get the untarnished truth of the crimes you committed in office?
6 | DV D Barnes | 278 | 10154769819726336_10154770714251336 | The FBI leadership is corrupt. The system is definitely rigged. If Hillary wins, all hell is going to break loose! People are going to party like its the 1770's.
7 | Bd Dilly | 192 | 10154769819726336_10154770779911336 | We have lost so much this election. I am a registered Democrat voting For Trump. But I have lost all faith in the Department of Justice, the FBI, mainstream media, and the DNC. As soon as the election is over, I am registering Republican. Go vote TRUMP!!
8 | Helena Isabella Hawthorne | 94 | 10154769819726336_10154770732541336 | I think the NYPD found enough in those emails to convict Hillary (and many others), but their powerful friends intervened. Take back America. Vote for Trump. Let's rid the planet of these vermin once and for all.
9 | Wendy Shuman | 83 | 10154769819726336_10154770730346336 | And why would you listen to one crook and vote for another...here's just a few things Obama is responsible for and HILLARY will do the same...Corey James wrote "Quit trashing Obama's accomplishments. He has done more than any other President before him. He has an impressive list of accomplishments:First President to apply for college aid as a foreign student, then deny he was a foreigner.First President to have a social security number belonging to another man, from a state he has never lived in.First President to preside over a cut to the credit-rating of the United States.First President to violate the War Powers Act.First President to be held in contempt of court for illegally obstructing oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico.First President to require all Americans to purchase a product from a third party.First President to spend a trillion dollars on "shovel-ready" jobs when there was no such thing as "shovel-ready" jobs.* * * *First President to abrogate bankruptcy law to turn over control of companies to his union supporters.First President to by-pass Congress and implement the Dream Act through executive fiat.First President to order a secret amnesty program that stopped the deportation of illegal immigrants across the U.S. including those with criminal convictions.First President to demand a company hand-over $20 billion to one of his political appointees.First President to tell a CEO of a major corporation (Chrysler) to resign.First President to terminate America’s ability to put a man in space.First President to cancel the National Day of Prayer and to say that America is no longer a Christian nation.First President to have a law signed by an auto-pen without being present.First President to arbitrarily declare an existing law unconstitutional and refuse to enforce it.First President to threaten insurance companies if they publicly spoke out on the reasons for their rate increases.First President to tell a major manufacturing company in which state it is allowed to locate a factory.First President to file lawsuits against the states he swore an oath to protect (AZ, WI, OH, IN).First President to withdraw an existing coal permit that had been properly issued years ago.First President to actively try to bankrupt an American industry (coal).First President to fire an inspector general of AmeriCorps for catching one of his friends in a corruption case.First President to appoint 45 czars to replace elected officials in his office.First President to surround himself with radical left wing anarchists.First President to golf 73 separate times in his first two and a half years in office, 102 to date.First President to hide his medical, educational and travel records.First President to win a Nobel Peace Prize for doing NOTHING to earn it.First President to go on multiple "global apology tours" and concurrent "insult our friends" tours.First President to go on 17 lavish vacations, including date nights and Wednesday evening White House parties for his friends paid for by the taxpayers.First President to have 22 personal servants (taxpayer funded) for his wife.First President to keep a dog trainer on retainer for $102,000 a year at taxpayer expense.* * * *First President to fly in a personal trainer from Chicago at least once a week at taxpayer expense.* * * *First President to repeat the Holy Quran & tell us the early morning call of the Azan (Islamic call to worship) is the most beautiful sound on earth.First President to tell the military men and women that they should pay for their own private insurance because they "volunteered to go to war and knew the consequences."Then he was the First President to tell the members of the military that THEY were UNPATRIOTIC for balking at the last suggestion.* * * *First President to side with a foreign nation over one of the American 50 states (Mexico vs. Arizona).How is Obama’s "Hope and Change" working out for you?"I believe Obama should be arrested and impeached for only a few of his "Great Accomplishments." For being best President in many of his Democratic followers eyes... I feel this Great Nation in being misled in an immorally direction away from what it was originally founded on. I pray for the safety and promising future for our children. I pray our children do not become as greedy, ungrateful, anti-christian and un-patriotic as I see our current leaders leading their lives.I commend you for reading all of this. And, I hope it has empowered you with knowledge and opened your eyes more.Thank You.Daniel S. HudsonP.S. The picture in this post is not myself. I do have the utmost respect for this Marine. God Bless Our Troops and their struggle to keep our freedom, even in hard times like these.
10 | Ed Johns | 27 | 10154769819726336_1862148910682406 | I wouldn't be too harsh on Comey. If there is no crime charges on Hillary, there is nothing for Obama to pardon. Let it ride for 2 1/2 months and let the Trump admin drain the swamp.
11 | Garry Kellogg | 46 | 10154769819726336_10154770719001336 | This is a good thing, and this is why: She's still under Investigation by the FBI for the 'Clinton Foundation' Scandal. Comey did do the right thing by not Indicting her right now, that way Obama cannot give her a Pardon before he leaves office, and when Donald J. Trump takes office he can have her arrested as well as everyone connected to the 'Clinton Foundation' and the eMail Scandal.
12 | Heidi Hansen Waterbury | 23 | 10154769819726336_10154770725236336 | What do we as Americans expect when Comey brother has ties to the Clinton Foundation. I was so sick to my stomach that our pos potus can look the other way until I realized that he was involved. The only way to get the charges to stick, yes charges...she broke 3 federal laws, is to vote in Trump. That is also the only way to save our country as we know it. If that woman gets in office we will never recover.
13 | Kathi Doyle Meyer | 34 | 10154769819726336_10154770788381336 | I have come to the conclusion that anyone who votes for Hillary does not care about their family or this country which we won't have one if she is president oh yeah and they are effing idiots!!! Sorry not sugar coating!!!
14 | Christy Vogan-Rankin | 25 | 10154769819726336_10154770760276336 | Of course the Justice Department under Obama has no interest in holding Hillary accountable... Because if they did they would find Obama in all of this too.  When we the people can't trust our highest officals to abide by the law, who can we trust??
15 | Will Mundy | 27 | 10154769819726336_1089918047791584 | When you're voting for somebody who lives under different rules than everybody else, can do whatever they want without any prosecution, then you are truly voting for a dictator and not a president. Silence in the face of evil is in itself evil.
16 | Herbie Davis | 32 | 10154769819726336_10154770747036336 | I would like to know how Obama is going to pay back his and Michelle's travel expenses on campaigning for Crooked Hillary? I can't understand how they can spend my tax money doing something I am totally against. Plus why is Obama not at the White House doing what he is being paid, his job? I guess he feels since he has not done it the last 8 years it is no need to start now. Maybe Hillary will pay for his travel like she paid for Chelsea's wedding through Clinton Foundation.
17 | Ronald Farquhar | 26 | 10154769819726336_10154770729071336 | This was all a distraction from Wikileaks. The e-mail drops were taking hold of the news cycles ,even on the Liberal networks. Now that it is hours before election nobody will hear anymore of Wikileaks. I pray the Media is brought down after this election,by we the People, no matter who win's. I still think Trump is going to win.

She is as guilty as OJ. Just because the system is compromised and she hasn't been tried and convicted doesn't mean she's not guilty as hell. It only means that the corruption and collusion is so bad, that it has caused the system to fail !
19 | Kenneth Pooran | 39 | 10154769819726336_10154770718671336 | Thing is, we're forever being told by the left and the establishment in general that Trump's a moron, the worst candidate ever, etc. but if they really believe that to be the case...why cheat? Why rig the system? They should just be confident of winning fair and square. Crooked Hillary should've never have been allowed to run in the first place!
20 | Lori Hankle | 20 | 10154769819726336_1862151367348827 | And let's not forget the Clinton foundation is STILL under FBI investigation! That's 3 investigations compared to Donald Trump saying a bad word a lot less offensive than the language coming out of lowlifes Jay Z and Beyoncé mouths this weekend. Anyone who votes for this woman needs to have their head examined!
21 | Roberta Dey | 32 | 10154769819726336_10154770718391336 | Wikileaks didn't touch the Hillary campaign because only fox gave it decent coverage.  Hillary lemmings don't watch fox because Obama keeps trashing them to discredit their reporting.
22 | Cliff English | 37 | 10154769819726336_10154770715461336 | Donald Trump - Mike Pence For America Great Again !!! Do you really want 4 years of scandals and people mysteriously committing suicide by shooting themselves twice in the back of their heads? Time to end this ! VOTE TRUMP !!!
23 | Pattie Goshtigian | 18 | 10154769819726336_10154770738111336 | The American people are not only being disrespected but our intelligence is being highly insulted!!! How dare the FBI come out saying the same thing they said back in July! How could they have reviewed all those emails in one week?? Seriously insulting to the American people!! God bless our country if Clinton gets elected!
24 | Jason E Kronenwetter | 19 | 10154769819726336_1089918187791570 | I believe the damage is already done with Comey reopening the investigation last week even though he came out yesterday and said he sticks with his earlier statement. He's going back and forth and is being coerced by the DOJ. The FBI must have felt there was something worth reopening the investigation for or else they wouldn't have said something last week.  Comey was probably threatened by the DOJ or Obama in some way or they paid him to shut up.
25 | Sterling Dossett | 19 | 10154769819726336_1089934957789893 | Our government is SO corrupt, and this election is SO rigged---poor Trump doesn't stand a chance!! Our votes won't count... Just watch and see.... Never thought I'd live to see my country unravel like this!! To all of the Obama/ Hillary supporters---you are DISGUSTING!!

"She has never come clean on this."

Congressman Jason Chaffetz vowed that "no matter who wins or loses this election," Congress is still going to look into Hillary Clinton's emails. http://bit.ly/2ff8Fvm

1 | Ashif Abdulahi | 1700 | 10154769638956336_10154770631646336 | Seriously? It took the FBI over a year to investigate over 30,000 emails, and we are to believe that in two weeks they reviewed over 650,000 emails?!  These days, I can't believe anything that comes out of Washington. Corruption.
2 | Kenny Ward | 598 | 10154769638956336_10154770628651336 | A former attorney general under Bill Clinton dies a couple days before the election, also a day after Comey announced there would still be no charges against Clinton. I wonder what Janet Reno was going to come forward with...
3 | Sandy Vincent | 304 | 10154769638956336_10154770631821336 | Give me a break they won't do anything! Obama and lynch should have been impeached years ago! Just with the IRS scandal obama should have been impeached!
4 | James Thomas Jr. | 268 | 10154769638956336_10154770628141336 | Tuesday will be a sad day in America's history if Hillary Clinton is elected!
5 | Robin Blades | 183 | 10154769638956336_10154770640146336 | Congress needs the power to convene a grand jury. That power should no reside solely with the AG, who answers directly to the POTUS. That is why this isn't going anywhere, Obama is implicated in the scandal.
6 | Joey Fox | 129 | 10154769638956336_10154770640476336 | I will not vote for my republican senator or anyone who did not actively help our national candidate. I am no longer voting straight ticket. I am no longer a Republican. I am voting out every incumbent. The gop is WORTHLESS.
7 | Dave Moon | 149 | 10154769638956336_10154770636711336 | The commentators are on now announcing that FBI director Comey has "cleared" Hillary. He did no such thing nor did he "clear" her the first time. He has no authority to clear anyone. He can choose not to go forward, but to say he cleared her is misleading and leads one to think she is innocent of all charges. She is not and to imply so is wrong.
8 | Priscilla Maynard | 121 | 10154769638956336_10154770642031336 | If you plan to vote for Hillary Clinton and have done your research, I respect your decision. However, if you have not, allow me to present five important points that will impact YOUR life should you choose to elect Hillary Clinton.You will vote for an increase in your taxes.You will vote for an increased cost of health insurance and a decrease in health care.You will vote for open borders which will mean an increase in terrorism.You will change the culture of America which will impact your religious freedom.You will be voting for a candidate with a long history of corruption.(Copy and paste)
9 | Michelle Whitten | 61 | 10154769638956336_10154770629446336 | Term limits for Congress. Trump said he's for term limits. The president doesn't have much to say  about laws but Congress does. These people have been in too long . Longer than I've been alive. Some are corrupt, some aren't. They are civil servants. They should not get special treatment. 8 years. That's all. We as a people have to demand this. If you can't do in 8 years what you promised then goodbye. Congress passed the 2 limit term for the president so he couldn't have too much power but not them? What's that tell you?
10 | Odonnell Sanders | 58 | 10154769638956336_10154770642661336 | Seriously? All Republicans had to do was pick someone to defeat Clinton in the presidential race and you picked a narcissistic clown. Blame no one but yourselves and move on!!! Let it go!!! Stop whining like babies!!!!
11 | Gary Haw | 42 | 10154769638956336_10154770642846336 | It's literally making me sick this American election :( Think back America when 7 odd years ago I did the research for you & Told you Obama was a Muslim plant !!! Again you didn't listen to Me & voted the Pig back in !!!!!!!!! Please take time out & research the demon your trying to vote back in now !!!!!!!!! Trump all the way !!!!!
12 | Barbara Roth | 34 | 10154769638956336_10154770676821336 | Michelle Obama said if Donald Trump is elected: "We're telling our sons it's okay to humiliate women. We're telling our daughters this is how they deserve to be treated.".... that's funny. So does that mean that if Hillary Clinton is elected, we are teaching our sons & daughters that it's ok to murder, lie, cover up, be corrupt, demean women, use racial slurs, and stay with a spouse that openly rapes women & cheats on you?
13 | Chasity Wrigley | 22 | 10154769638956336_10154770663226336 | Yea right that's a bunch of crap! She shouldn't even be able to run forOffice God what is wrong with this country. Oh yea we took you out of it.

15 | Daniel LeVar | 32 | 10154769638956336_10154770656726336 | I have to ask what the hell is going on - this President is encouraging Illegals to vote - so Hillary Clinton can steal the election and Jerry Brown Governor of California passed some quickie legislation so Illegals can vote - I thought we had to be a citizen of the united states to vote......HELP,
16 | Lisa Fields | 15 | 10154769638956336_10154770694606336 | Here's my take on Comey I think he is making sure we are all ticked off so we get out and VOTE Trump to get this corruption cleared up. First of all he came out in July with his hands tied by the DOJ and laid out every reason Hillary should be prosecuted and did nothing . To remind everyone he wrote the letter to the Hill saying they may have new evidence the once again nothing .How many of us are ticked now Get out and VOTE TRUMP he's right again the system is rigged. Just saying
17 | Michael A DeGennaro | 10 | 10154769638956336_1129725180416252 | The election is tomorrow here are my thoughts if Hillary wins. If Hillary wins we will never have another Republican President. We will be known now as the United Socialist States of America, a permanent one party government. The country will have been stolen by the liberal entitlement-minded Democrats who believe that democracy means taking from everybody else. Republicans will forever be outnumbered by the entitlement crowd who do not believe in the principles that made this country the greatest and most powerful country on earth. While we working people begin filling the outstretched hands of the "gimme mines" class, Republicans may as well begin closing their doors as we begin this new road to self-destruction. They will never again overcome a block of voters that will soon constitute over 50% of the population receiving entitlements. "Socialism works great until you run out of other people's money." - Margaret Thatcher. Refugees, extremists, and illegal immigrants will poor into our once great nation forever changing it. Christians will be persecuted and the word under God will be removed. Lawlessness will take hold and Americans will be targeted in their homes and out in public. Look to Europe to see your glorious future, for you are now them. Enjoy the scenery when you've reached your destination. Patriots who love this country like Donald Trump will be the biggest losers Wednesday morning. Hillary Clinton and Obama with their socialist supporters and mentors Bill Ayers and George Soros will have achieved their greatest victory. They held out a carrot and the Democrats bought it. It will not just be a sad day, it will be a tragic day and it will be on a grand scale. On the bright side, Republicans will never again need to bother to vote. So save America and Vote Trump! God Bless Donald Trump!
18 | Ed Johns | 12 | 10154769638956336_1092311567532693 | I wouldn't be too harsh on Comey. If there is no crime charges on Hillary, there is nothing for Obama to pardon. Let it ride for 2 1/2 months and let the Trump admin drain the swamp.
19 | Tracey Hail Hail | 18 | 10154769638956336_10154770647886336 | How many investigations All led by REPUBLICANS have come up with Zero!, Nada!, Zilch! The system is riiiigggeeeeddd!!= Trump, after praising the FBI all last week.
20 | Michael Gormiller | 17 | 10154769638956336_10154770675266336 | I have lost all faith and respect for The FBI DOJ. Obama and his administration. I didn't agree with policy's, now I have NO respect.. for me to disrespect someone isn't my nature. It's like getting roaches in your home, you may not have caused it, but it's  hell getting them out..
21 | Barbara Connor | 13 | 10154769638956336_10154770730431336 | Didn"t Obummer tell an illegal it was o.k. to vote? Isn't that a crimefor any public official to tell an illegal that, and this election isn't rigged. He probably had all the immigrants he brought in and had them vote. IF Hillary wins this election it is rigged. Obama owns the media also.
22 | Sharon Louise | 10 | 10154769638956336_10154770676001336 | Great, if she wins, congress will be busy doing that, so she can do MORE harm while we're all distracted with that! Would have been nice if Republicans would have done their jobs a long time ago and gotten behind Trump as soon as he won the nomination! Gish. 😩
23 | Bonnie Hix Easterwood | 12 | 10154769638956336_10154770788131336 | I'm not holding my breath, theirs so much pay to play in that swamp, theirs no way anything will happen, I say all of you corrupt politicians should lose your pay till you do your job, the whole world sees how corrupt and greedy all you rats are, drain the filthy swamp !
24 | Pat Klink | 9 | 10154769638956336_10154770655441336 | And you think you will be able to do something about it? Grow up, you let Obama run over all you republicans for eight years and caused the entire mess. To late now.shut up and watch Sharia law take effect in a few years. Obama's muslim cabinet has taken over.
25 | Timothy E J Eusini | 10 | 10154769638956336_1092309814199535 | Director Comey's statement on the Clinton email case doesn't close the investigation like the media is saying. Lawyers are meticulous wordsmiths. It's to discourage those who will vote for Trump. Who are primarily republicans and generally don't early vote, but vote on the 8th. This is when most of them do their voting. They use psychological warfare all the time just like Hitler did with his propaganda media machine. So don't fall for it and go VOTE.

1 | Faith Lynch | 900 | 10154765516416336_10154770504561336 | I AM A WHITE NATIVE RURAL ARKANSAN.   When I am casting my vote on November 8, I will NOT think of the "advice" of any entertainer.  I WILL however  remember the core values I learned being raised by my grandparents in a Christian home; I will remember how they taught me to honor the country of Israel and the Jews;   I will remember learning how evil the KKK and segregation were; I will remember the 2nd Amendment for the right to bear arms as my grandad hunted for food for our table.   I was asked tonight how I could support Trump.  My response was this....If he had put our nation's security at risk, I would not vote for him. If his organization received large donations from countries that killed women and gays, I would not vote for him. If he boasted 30 Years of government experience, but still could not discern if an email was classified or not, without someone letting him know if it was or not, I would not vote for him. If he boasted about how he has defended children his entire life, but is for abortion, (even late term, when the child can feel pain) I would not vote for him. If he caused lives to be destroyed in Benghazi and then lied to the faces of the parents as they stood at their child's casket, I would not vote for him. If people who came against him mysteriously turned up dead, I would not vote for him. If he suddenly developed a southern accent when he was in the South, campaigning, I would not vote for him. If he continually broke the law and that was ignored, I would not vote for him, but right now, the ONLY person who does ALL these things is Hillary. Right now, the fact that Donald made some regrettable remarks over 12 years ago, does not move me. I'm bigger than those remarks and we all have said stupid things throughout our lives. To me, the fact that Hillary lies continuously, is a much bigger problem. We can see the effects of her lies by the state of our poor country right now...  I WILL VOTE FOR TRUMP.   (Thanks Kent Rose for writing some of this.)

17 | Jordan Brown | 8 | 10154765516416336_10154770683556336 | Bill Clinton cheats on his wife. Impeach him. Trump proudly brags about sexual assault (and has cheated on his wives). Elect him. Hillary oversaw the department of state while 4 people died in an embassy attack. Put her in jail. 2 Republicans were in office while over 200 people died in embassy attacks. No problem. Immigrants don't pay taxes. Round them up and kick them out. Trump doesn't pay taxes. He's a business genius. Hillary's foundation only spent 87% of their donations helping people. She's a crook. Trumps foundation paid off his debts, bought sculptures of him, and made political donations to avoid investigations while using less than 5% of funds for charity (and he got shut down by NY State).  So savvy... Put him in the white house. Trump made 4 billion dollars in 40 years, when an index fund started at the same time with the same "small loans" he received would be worth $12 billion today... without a trail of bankruptcies, thousands of lawsuits and burned small business owners. He's a real business whiz. Hillary took a loss of $700k. She's a criminal. Trump is the first candidate in the modern era not to release his tax returns, and took a billion dollar loss in 1 year. Genius. Hillary takes responsibility for private email servers and apologizes. Not credible. Trump denies saying things (on the record) he actually said (on the record), he's just telling it like it is. Your arguments are thin. Your ignorance of reality is shocking. Your double-standards are offensive, and your willingness to blindly support him and recycle the rhetoric is absurd. Your opinion is not facts and your hypocrisy is not a platform.
18 | Serge Mckenzie | 8 | 10154765516416336_10154770473756336 | In this election there is a clear and present danger confronting the American People! The stark choice they have to make in this election is whether to elect a crook, Hillary Clinton, who is mired in a cesspool of corruption and US Government security breaches and is under FBI investigation; or whether they elect a viable candidate who isn't, and who promises to put an end to any and all such criminality at the top levels of the US Government.  Trump is that viable candidate.  The issue is now above party politics!  The American People in each state must give a resounding NO to Hillary Clinton by voting for Donald Trump, and that includes California! The HONOUR of every state in the US and the people who live in them is at stake here! Democrats may be opposed to Trump, but they really have NO CHOICE on this issue. They HAVE to vote for Donald Trump, because they HAVE to reject criminality at top levels of their Nation's Government. There are no ifs and buts in this matter. Otherwise, by giving Clinton a majority in their state, they will have shown that their moral compass is grossly distorted and skewed. They will be condemning their state to an image of being a gullible, pariah, wonky, immoral state with no sense of right or wrong. Do they really want that image for their state? Do they really want to be labelled a skunk state?! Democrats have only themselves to blame for the moral dilemma they have placed themselves in. They have been incompetent, negligent and corrupt in nominating Clinton. And some Democrats are saying this out loud. They must let this election go. Democrats must re-affirm categorically that they are against criminality at top government levels by voting for Donald Trump, no matter how hard it is for them to do so, and then go away and re-think their ideas.  It is best that Democrats do this for the honour of their State and for America.

24 | Mary Lou Melter Collins | 0 | 10154765516416336_1608421929459155 | Recall that Hillary Clinton did her college thesis on his writings and Barack Hussein Obama writes about him in his books.How to create a social state by Saul Alinsky:There are 8 levels of control that must be obtained before you are able to create a social state.The first is the most important.1) Healthcare — Control healthcare and you control the people2) Poverty — Increase the Poverty level as high as possible, poor people are easier to control and will not fight back if you are providing everything for them to live.3) Debt — Increase the debt to an unsustainable level. That way you are able to increase taxes, and this will produce more poverty.4) Gun Control — Remove the ability to defend themselves from the Government. That way you are able to create a police state.5) Welfare — Take control of every aspect of their lives (Food, Housing, and Income).6) Education — Take control of what people read and listen to — take control of what children learn in school.7) Religion — Remove the belief in the God from the Government and schools.8) Class Warfare — Divide the people into the wealthy and the poor. This will cause more discontent and it will be easier to take (Tax) the wealthy with the support of the poor.Now, think ...Does any of this sound like what is happening to the United States?

"If Hillary were to be, God forbid, elected president... it would be a disaster for the country and for the world."

On "FOX & Friends Weekend," Mike Huckabee talked about why if elected Hillary Clinton would be the most "distracted president ever."

1 | Lori Dannelley-VanDyne | 970 | 10154768072191336_10154770385776336 | You know who she reminds me of........Al Capone. They tried to catch him for years for his criminal acts. Finally they got him on tax evasion!!!! Wouldn't be ironic if she went down the same way? But what I am really hoping for is that the FBI is holding back charging her till after January so the presiding President can not Pardon her.
2 | Erin Marie Yager | 738 | 10154768072191336_10154770394221336 | I'm all about live and let live. But this is getting crazy! For example, I have a friend who gets about $800 a month in social security. Her spouse can't work at this time, and his monthly insurance premium is jumping from @ $230 per month to about $750 per month. If she didn't take on a part time job, that would leave them with less than $50 a month to live on. So while the wealthy celebrities are stumping for Clinton, and the people on subsidized health care are voting for Clinton, the people who have worked all of their lives, and those of us in the middle class are getting screwed. I've seen people's names changed because they bought a new social security card illegally, I've been to the richest cities in the country with people sleeping on the sidewalks, I've been called racist because I don't agree with this administration, I've seen towers fall, and I've seen my hometown county turn into the 2nd most affected by meth and heroin in NY state, (of which Clinton was a Senator). I've watched videos of Clinton saying she was against gay marriage, that she was for a border wall, called young black men "super predators" and her outright lies about a little place called Benghazi. As I've said before, I don't know if Trump is the answer, but this woman, with all of the opportunity she has had to affect change, is definitely not the answer. She walked into Washington 40 plus years ago with the sole purpose to gain the Presidency. It's been about her the entire time. Kicked off the Watergate case for taking home documents, lying under oath, and the most recent admission of accepting an unreported gift of 1 million dollars from a foreign nation (that which you need to report). They left Haiti, still in ruins. This woman can't even wear an American flag pin, as to not offend her foreign counterparts. This is not the America my ancestors came here for. Scared to speak your mind, less control over your children's upbringing, and a new database with your private healthcare information going straight to the government. All true. All evidence based in fact. When Tuesday is over, one way or another it's gonna be scary. I just hope. I don't know what I hope. But I'm gonna have a back up plan. GN, and stay safe.
3 | Angus Palo Grande | 113 | 10154768072191336_10154770394166336 | Not so mr huckleberry!! Trump would be disaster. I can't believe anyone in their right mind would vote Trump!! What's wrong w/u people?! Hilary is no saint but compare to Trump she's so much better.
4 | Linda Powell | 82 | 10154768072191336_10154770389851336 | The "disaster" depends on who you talk to.Apparently a lot of folks want a Socialist system where they can sit on the porch and collect a welfare check....come into this country illegally and obtain all kinds of benefits...kill babies up until the day they are born....and have our Government be their wetnurse.They refuse to see that the power that can give...is the same power that can take it away after they have gotten what they want.
5 | Kimberly R. Bailey | 47 | 10154768072191336_10154770408956336 | THIS TELLS YOU WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW!!!Dear DonaldTens of millions of us voters watched your debate with Hillary Clinton on Monday night. And we’re trying — really trying — to understand some of the points you made about jobs, trade, the economy and taxes.But you’ve left us confused. Some of the things you’re saying are pretty hard to follow.So could you just help us out by clarifying a few points?1. How are we are “losing all our jobs” to other countries when the private sector has generated 12 million jobs in the past five years?2. Why do you say the Federal Reserve needs to raise interest rates to stop the economy from overheating, when you also say we’re in a terrible slump? Do you think the Fed should raise rates in a slump — a sure recipe for a depression — or do you think the economy is actually doing better than you admit?3. If all our jobs are going to Mexico, why do we need a wall to stop all the Mexicans moving here for work?4. Come to think of it, why would they want to come here if we are now a “third-world country” and a “hell hole”?5. According to the statistics, median personal incomes — when adjusted for inflation — are at or near record highs and are up 5% since 2009. How exactly has President Obama been an economic disaster?6. If NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement, was one of the “worst trade deals” in history, why was it immediately followed by the longest economic expansion in modern U.S. history, the creation of nearly 3 million new jobs a year for five years, and the biggest rise in real private-sector wages since the 1960s?7. You boast that you’re “smart” to avoid taxes, because the money would have been “squandered.” But two-thirds of all federal spending goes to defense, veterans, Social Security, Medicare and debt interest. How are you defining “squandered”?8. How do you plan to pay for your massive, $6 trillion tax cut while increasing defense and veteran spending, and without cutting any of the other three?9. Today, by every reliable statistic, the rich have never had it so good. Yet you say the middle class is in terrible shape. So why do you think the answer is to make the rich even richer by cutting their taxes?10. Come to think of it, aren’t you arguing that the middle class did better in the 1990s (when, the IRS says, the top 400 taxpayers paid an average rate of 28% a year) than in the past decade (when they’ve paid just 18%)?11. You plan to cut the inheritance tax paid by super-rich heirs from 45% to 20%. How is that not self-dealing, when by your own estimates that would save your own kids about $2.5 billion?12. If China is aggressively devaluing its currency to undermine us, why has it risen 24% against the dollar in the past 10 years?13. The conservative Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget reckons your tax-and-spending plans would raise the national debt to $28 trillion by 2026. If, as you say, we are in a terrible crisis now because our (gross) national debt is nearly $20 trillion, how will we be better off when it’s 40% higher?14. Dubai, which is part of the United Arab Emirates, and Kuwait are tiny dictatorships with lots of oil and few people. Why do you think our infrastructure issues are remotely comparable to theirs?15. You’ve said it was “smart” and “normal business practice” to use bankruptcy laws to escape your creditors. Former President Harry Truman, famously, refused to do just that when his store folded. Instead he worked for 15 years to pay back every dollar he owed. Did that make him stupid? Equally, millions of middle-class Americans refused to default on their mortgages during the housing crisis, even when they could have done so. Were they stupid too?If you could just clarify those few points, we’d all be really grateful. Thanks!Yours,The Voters

7 | Shannon George | 35 | 10154768072191336_10154770426526336 | Imagine it is November 9, 2016 in America and we wake up knowing who our new President will be. If it is Hillary, think of the groups of people that will celebrate. Illegal Immigrants, criminals and future criminals who will be supported for pulling a gun on a police officer, planned parenthood, the media, and the list goes on and on that represent everything that is wrong with America. If you're still "with her," look around at who you'll be celebrating with. Now imagine waking up knowing that Trump is our new President. You may or may not like him, or really know what kind of president he will be. But here are some things you will know for sure:• The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.• The media has been neutered forever.• Career politicians will have lost all job security.• The guns in your home will safely stay there.• Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.• Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally• Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.• No more apologies to the world for being great!• Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.• Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.• There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.• The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.• The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.

We're telling our daughters this is how they deserve to be treated.".... that's funny. So does that mean that if Hillary Clinton is elected, we are teaching our sons & daughters that it's ok to murder, lie, cover up, be corrupt, demean women, use racial slurs, and stay with a spouse that openly rapes women & cheats on you?
16 | Matthew LaBelle | 5 | 10154768072191336_1063811513728039 | What is wrong with this ? If u and I did half of what Hillary has done, we would be locked up and the key thrown away !

This is so wrong !! I'm voting Trump, to make my country great again !

20 | Andrew Allan | 6 | 10154768072191336_10154770419266336 | The funny thing is, Mike Huckabee, the world is saying the polar opposite to you in regards to which of the two candidates would be a disaster for America. In fact, by branding brand America as an extension of brand Trump the likely outcome would probably follow the same direction. A boycott of brand Trump.
21 | Richard Gawel | 4 | 10154768072191336_1093800110740994 | All the doomsayers said the same thing about Obama 8 years ago and the country didn't collapse. Yeah, there are problems. But there always have been problems and there always will be problems. We still haven't crumbled. This is just fear mingering in a desperate attempt to grab attention in a crowded media climate.

23 | Barbara Connor | 8 | 10154768072191336_10154770545891336 | My sentiments exactly, Mr. Huckabee. A Country run by Hillary Clinton is indeed a scary one. I beleive she is Anti-American Anti- Chtistian. She generaly really doesn't love people, she is all about power, money and the elite.She thinks of herself as a queen and the people r peasants. This Country is doomed IF she is elected.
24 | Donna Crisante | 5 | 10154768072191336_1063786837063840 | People have their minds made up who they're voting for.....I couldn't vote for someone like Hillary who has put our country in jeopardy and is continually lying! She'll say anything to get votes and after the election things will stay the same! Trump! 2016!
25 | Serge Mckenzie | 9 | 10154768072191336_10154770392591336 | In this election there is a clear and present danger confronting the American People! The stark choice they have to make in this election is whether to elect a crook, Hillary Clinton, who is mired in a cesspool of corruption and US Government security breaches and is under FBI investigation; or whether they elect a viable candidate who isn't, and who promises to put an end to any and all such criminality at the top levels of the US Government.  Trump is that viable candidate.  The issue is now above party politics!  The American People in each state must give a resounding NO to Hillary Clinton by voting for Donald Trump, and that includes California! The HONOUR of every state in the US and the people who live in them is at stake here! Democrats may be opposed to Trump, but they really have NO CHOICE on this issue. They HAVE to vote for Donald Trump, because they HAVE to reject criminality at top levels of their Nation's Government. There are no ifs and buts in this matter. Otherwise, by giving Clinton a majority in their state, they will have shown that their moral compass is grossly distorted and skewed. They will be condemning their state to an image of being a gullible, pariah, wonky, immoral state with no sense of right or wrong. Do they really want that image for their state? Do they really want to be labelled a skunk state?! Democrats have only themselves to blame for the moral dilemma they have placed themselves in. They have been incompetent, negligent and corrupt in nominating Clinton. And some Democrats are saying this out loud. They must let this election go. Democrats must re-affirm categorically that they are against criminality at top government levels by voting for Donald Trump, no matter how hard it is for them to do so, and then go away and re-think their ideas.  It is best that Democrats do this for the honour of their State and for America.

4 | Joyce Anglin Miller | 805 | 10154770044901336_10154770320336336 | I absolutely agree. I will not stand by another female just because I'm one especially if it's Hillary Clinton. I've read how she treats her staff. It's been proven that she lies and steals. And I think it is appalling how badly she treated the families of those killed in Benghazi just to cover the truth. I want nothing to do with her.

The women who vote for Trump love America. Donald Trump is wise and he will make America Great Again!! TRUMP 2016!!
8 | Bob Janke | 214 | 10154770044901336_10154770329841336 | To all the females voters...don't vote for Clinton just because she's a female..I also would like to see the first female president but she is running for all the wrong reasons
9 | Carolyn Johnson Foltyn | 146 | 10154770044901336_10154770343866336 | Hillary panders to women, to blacks, to Hispanics, about children, to the church - Muslims or Christians - depending on her audience… And, she cares about none of them. Hillary cares about Hillary.
10 | Charlie B. Kings | 99 | 10154770044901336_10154770324706336 | “Women are highly offended that a candidate like Hillary Clinton thinks that she gets our vote simply because we are the same gender she is. It’s ridiculous, it’s insulting, and it’s offensive.” — IT IS ALSO TRUE!!!!!! LOOK AT THE POLLS 😂😂😂#imwithnoone
11 | Scott Brown | 93 | 10154770044901336_10154770331361336 | Yet their will be a lot of women doing just that. They will elect this corrupt politician simply because of gender. I'm all for a women President, just not this corrupt women.
12 | Gary Hines | 90 | 10154770044901336_10154770340476336 | Instead of telling me "women are offended by Trump" ,  get me the women that will stand in front of a camera and actually say they are offended and why. I'm so sick of opinions that are not provable. Every morally stable woman I've talked are more upset by the dishonesty in politics, namely the Democratic party. So you "News" reporters, keep your political opinions to yourself, and report the NEWS.
13 | Tina Wilson | 51 | 10154770044901336_10154770365106336 | I am a woman and I will not vote for killary! Also all these people she's getting to help her bring in the crowd the people are only there for the concert not to hear killary! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸Trump🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸2017
14 | Tanya Critelli Kerner | 52 | 10154770044901336_10154770353496336 | She has had 30 years to perfect her corrupted ways! She doesn't care about the people for anything but a vote. She is all about control, power and money. God help us all if she is elected!
15 | Heather Moore Lewis | 76 | 10154770044901336_10154770327381336 | She said exactly what I feel. It pisses me off that Hillary thinks she gets my vote. I would NEVER vote for her!!! She's an evil woman and I would like the first woman president to be someone I can be proud to say is our country's first female pres. Not someone I would be ashamed of. This woman is proudly voting for Trump! 🇺🇸
16 | Mike Boyd | 55 | 10154770044901336_10154770328556336 | Please get the vote out for Trump/Pence! We must restore the rule of law to our country! This is the last chance for our children and grandchildren to live in a free country that respects law and order for all equally!
17 | Paula Robinson McDonald | 45 | 10154770044901336_10154770395816336 | I'm so sick of the news saying white, college educated women don't support Trump!!!  That's a lie!!!  There are plenty of us white, college educated women who support Trump!!  There are lots of smart women from all walks of life that support Trump!!!
18 | Anna Thorpe | 47 | 10154770044901336_1162439917183896 | Yeah. That's an insult. I don't mind having a female president, but not this queen of corruption. If she wins, I believe it will be the first time this country has knowingly and willingly elected a crook. She is corrupt to the core. Other presidents' corruption manifested during their term(s). She would go in 100% rotten. Where do you go from there? I've studied this worm over the decades. As a Black and a woman, her tactics to win my vote have been a farce. That's what I see; it's what I know, and I'm sticking to it.
19 | Evelyn Gwynn | 57 | 10154770044901336_10154770372101336 | As a woman I am offended that other women are voting for Trump knowing he has groped some women and raped young girl! Yet to ease their conscious they always say so did Bill Clinton! But, Bill Clinton isn't running for President. That's just an excuse so they can sleep at night and still be able to look at their own young daughters. There is no comparison at all. But I say it's still a free country, cast your vote for whomever you so desire on November 8!
20 | Jeanne Kathman Herrington | 61 | 10154770044901336_10154770364951336 | I don't feel like she expects my vote at all because I'm a woman. She has my vote because she's everything Trump isn't. Eric Trump's wife is trying to find anything she can to get people to vote for her rude daddy in law.
21 | Angela Deane | 36 | 10154770044901336_10154770326566336 | I've seen approx 7 or 8 articles pass my news feed where elderly woman are so excited to vote for a woman. Some are 90 to 102. They won't be living w the repercussions of their vote. I'm a woman and there are far too many issues than to vote on gender. I'm glad they lived to see they had a choice but should vote for the right reasons. One voted for Hillary right before she passed.
22 | Linda Lehman | 34 | 10154770044901336_10154770376341336 | I'm an educated woman in Florida and all the women I know are voting for Trump! I am personally offended by Hillary's lies, corruption, and elitist attitude. She is the worst possible example for the perfect woman candidate for president, and has pushed the possibility of another woman candidate in the future back many years.
23 | Ugochukwu Emeh | 34 | 10154770044901336_10154770323291336 | America let us a say a prayer. "Lord as we go into this elections I pray that you will deliver us from the shackles of liberalism that has derided our common sense as a people and our enemies (sponsors of 9/11) are watching is in 3D hoping their sponsored candidate is elected into the oval office, but Lord we know you will put them to shame, just like as you haven't forsaken the Israelites even though theu disobeyed your orders and are now bearing the consequences till this day from their violent neighbours, Lord we know America is in your hands and you cant afford to loose it to the haters of your children. Finally Lord as we all go out enmass to vote the candidate who speaks the truth as it is hot without minding whose ox it gores, your protection will be on us and for our brothers and sisters that still wanna vote in Clinton we wont ask u Lord to consume them like Korah, Dathan and Abiram, rather we ask you to cure them from acute Zombesim", lest our nation becomes Americanistan. Amen
24 | Fontaine Pearson | 15 | 10154770044901336_10154770332061336 | It's too bad he couldn't create a strong economic plan. But it's incredibly insulting to our intelligence to insinuate that she's expecting us to vote for her because she's a woman or that we're voting for her merely because she's a woman.
25 | Tom Garrett | 24 | 10154770044901336_1005478342912547 | If you are Gay, why are you voting for Hillary when she wants to bring in millions of refugees that believe gays should be executed?If you are Black, why are you voting for Hillary when she defends Planned Parenthood and admires Margaret Sanger, who wanted to abort as many black babies as possible and exterminate the black race because they are like "weeds." Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.If you are a Woman, how can you vote for Hillary when she has buried all of Bill's rape victims under the rug. As an attorney, Hillary also defended the rapist of a 12-year old girl and laughed about it later. She plays the woman-card and acts entitled; implying that she deserves your vote merely because of her sex. How is that gender neutral?If you have are a Miner, Steelworker or have a Factory job, why are you voting for Hillary when she supported NAFTA and TPP, and workers are being laid off because jobs are going overseas? She also welcomes open borders and illegals to get benefits with your tax money and compete for our jobs. Hillary boasts that under her administration miners and steelworkers will lose their jobs.If you are a Law abiding citizen, how can you vote for Hillary when she is clearly above the law? Hillary deleted thousands of secret e-mails *after* they had been subpoenaed by the courts (illegal). Hillary kept thousands of classified and top secret e-mails on her private server; servers that had less security that g-mail and Hotmail. You can be sure Russia, Iran, and China have those now. The DNC clearly broke the rules by heavy-handedly favoring Hillary over Sanders while they were still competing for the nomination.If you are a Veteran, in the military, or closely related to a military member, why are you voting for Hillary when she left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again? They called for help, but the help was told to stand down. Furthermore, Hillary wants to eliminate the NRA, take away your guns, and abolish the second amendment?

Newt Gingrich reacted on 'Hannity' to the FBI’s decision to clear Hillary Clinton again. http://fxn.ws/2eD5T4L

What do you think?

1 | Mark Jones | 3650 | 10154770141961336_10154770182846336 | If it took 8 days to review 650,000 emails, why did it take a year to review the other 33,000 with the same technology available? Oh wait, this administration is corrupt.
2 | Zach Kerman | 3090 | 10154770141961336_10154770180181336 | Michelle Obama said if Donald Trump is elected: "We're telling our sons it's okay to humiliate women. We're telling our daughters this is how they deserve to be treated.".... that's funny. So does that mean that if Hillary Clinton is elected, we are teaching our sons & daughters that it's ok to murder, lie, cover up, be corrupt, demean women, use racial slurs, and stay with a spouse that openly rapes women & cheats on you?
3 | Pamela Pierce Gougler | 824 | 10154770141961336_10154770184131336 | He (Comey) was FORCED to say what he did today or he is CORRUPT like the rest of them in DC.  Sad day for America when FBI and DOJ are corrupt.
4 | Stacey Barna Bruno | 485 | 10154770141961336_10154770184926336 | I am scared, sick and disgusted. The corruption starts at the White House and goes down... DOJ, FBI, Hilary and her camp, past Presidents, politicians on both sides, media, polling machines, staffers ripping up republican votes, etc, the list goes on. How can this man ever win the POTUS? The people's vote don't matter to make it great again. Voting Trump here
5 | Yogi Kesl | 237 | 10154770141961336_10154770195286336 | That's so funny. Because the FBI couldn't move that fast if there butt was on fire. But all of a sudden you finish in a week. The corrupt government wants Hillary in office. They have spent so much time and money covering up for her. To me this has been the worse election. God help us all if she gets into office
6 | Deena Jones | 299 | 10154770141961336_10154770181521336 | Our Government leaders are at it again. The Justice Dept., FBI, White House, have all conspired to exonerate Hillary Clinton. Not once, but now for the second time. 650,000 e-mails all of a sudden have been reviewed and the results are in two days before election. Comey himself, presented enough evidence to charge her the first time. Either these people are totally inept or just plain criminal. Our leaders must think we are the stupidest people on earth. Welcome to Barack Obama's fundamentally transformed America.
7 | Boris Leak | 157 | 10154770141961336_10154770181156336 | Filters, scanning software. Sorry Newt it's not the 1950s anymore :) The FBI don't have to manually read each and every e-mail. Computer science is a growing and well paying field for a reason ...but you need some education.
8 | Heather Jarrett | 185 | 10154770141961336_10154770182261336 | If this isn't proof enough just how rooted Hillary is in corruption.. I don't know what is. Logically people can see how none of this adds up and yet... she's cleared AGAIN.
9 | Bob Berry | 80 | 10154770141961336_10154770218951336 | Ok let's take this back to the bare minimum and say that Hillary is not going to be charged for anything, even though normal citizens have been sent to jail for one mishandling of classified information. But with the careless way she handled the information, she should at the least have her security credentials pulled. That is enough to disqualify you from becoming POTUS.
10 | Sharon Coffill | 73 | 10154770141961336_10154770206571336 | I understand ppl's frustration regarding this but this outcome really is in the republican's and America's favor. No indictment right now means Obama can't grant her a presidential pardon. If Trump wins, they can just indict her then. If she wins, she can still be impeached. If she is pardoned by Obama, we will never get justice....
11 | Ray Bentham | 55 | 10154770141961336_1774631949469059 | Great! Now that the government admits it can process and analyze 650,000 emails at the speed of light there should be no reason why any more of our veterans die, commit suicide or become more sick waiting for their paperwork to get processed !
12 | Ray I. Smith | 68 | 10154770141961336_10154770190326336 | This statement you all are copying and pasting is actually stupid. I don't like her but ya all need to read. The only emails that they looked at were from or to her. Could have been 100 could have been 1000. 650k? Use some logic.
13 | Steve Goldberg | 26 | 10154770141961336_10154770209601336 | Republican politicians have been lying and scaring their base for years.  Each one of these is false and did not come to pass (see the link to the site for details that address each point):1. In the 1960s, Republicans wrongly claimed that passage of Medicare would be the end of capitalism.2. In 1993, when Bill Clinton raised taxes on the wealthiest 1.5%, Republicans predicted a recession, increased unemployment and a growing budget deficit.3. In 2001, when George W. Bush cut taxes for the wealthy, Republicans predicted record job growth, increased budget surplus and nationwide prosperity.4. In 1993, when the Brady Law and the Assault Weapons Ban were passed, Republicans predicted increasing rates of crime and murder.5. Republicans predicted that we would find Iraq’s Weapons of Mass Destruction even though UN weapons inspectors said that those weapons didn't exist.6. Prior to going to war in Iraq, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld optimistically predicted the Iraq war might last “six days, six weeks, I doubt six months”.7. Republicans said waterboarding and other forms of “enhanced interrogation” are not torture and are necessary in fighting Islamic extremism.8. In 2008, Republicans said that if we elect a Democratic president, we would be hit by Al Qaeda again, perhaps worse than the attack on 9/11.9. In 2009, Republicans predicted that the economic stimulus package would only make the recession worse and cause more unemployment.10. Most Republicans said that President Obama should be impeached because of the 2012 attack on the US consulate in Benghazi.11. Republicans said we must deregulate businesses so they can be more profitable and we will all enjoy the wealth created by deregulation.12. Republicans predicted that Obamacare would hurt the economy and kill jobs.13. Republicans said if President Obama is reelected, the price of gasoline would rise to $5.45 a gallon by January 2015.14. Republicans said President Obama would be terrible for the economy.15. Republicans predicted that President Obama’s tax increase on the top 1% in 2013 would kill jobs, increase the deficit and cause another recession.16. Republicans said President Obama would raise taxes sky high.17. Republicans have long promised that “trickle-down economics”, is the best way to stimulate the economy.18. In 2012, Republicans predicted that failure to approve the Keystone Pipeline would send the price of gasoline sky high and kill large numbers of jobs.19. Republicans insist that their policies create more jobs than Democrats and claim Democratic policies are “job killers”.20. Republicans claim that raising the minimum wage would kill jobs and hurt the economy.21. Republicans routinely accuse Democrats of wanting to cut defense spending to the bone and leave us defenseless against our enemies.The one they don’t have is saying that electing Obama (and now Hillary), they will take away your guns and won’t support the 2nd amendment.  That is false too.https://soapboxie.com/us-politics/21-TruthsThat-Prove-Republicans-Have-Been-Wrong-About-Everything
14 | Kenneth White | 28 | 10154770141961336_10154770190766336 | Well you do all know if comey indicted Hilary then Obama could parded her, if comey waits till Trump wins, and becomes President, well.... Hilary for Prison with no pardon.
15 | Donna Fulton | 20 | 10154770141961336_10154770202731336 | Exactly! The FBI is afraid of Obama and Hillary Clinton!  I guess they have sold out too!  Where is justice for the American people?  Is this the future of America, a dictator? Why was anyone so corrupt allow to run or even be nominated for the President of the United States of America??????
16 | Joe Driver | 34 | 10154770141961336_10154770207041336 | So according to James Comey (NOT the FBI as a whole, by the way), Hillary isn't a criminal, she's just extremely careless with sensitive information - well, I feel much better...
17 | Robertson Family Values | 49 | 10154770141961336_10154770182986336 | Newt Gingrich made an excellent point on his page earlier this evening...Hillary has violated the Emolument Clause of the Constitution with the Clinton Foundation's courting of foreign governments. Why is no one else talking about this?
18 | Christopher Westermann | 22 | 10154770141961336_1324131500942462 | How convenient was it for the FBI to have reviewed and cleared Hillary just days before the election. I think the American people can say with ease that our Government is corrupt
19 | Kamil Sada | 21 | 10154770141961336_10154770190636336 | He's right it's all rigged why would the FBI say they reopening the case without even looking at the emails if anyone just have a tiny brain can piece it together so James comey either bought or scared cause who knows Obama and doj threaten him I would believe it
20 | Christian Ross | 26 | 10154770141961336_10154770181381336 | I did the math. The FBI would spend half a second on each email if they looked at each email 24 hours a day since the investigation began last Friday
21 | Gianna M. Salande | 17 | 10154770141961336_10154770209996336 | Keep this in mind. The FBI just made the statement, That nothing will be done... -- Mr. Comey handed us a beautiful gift. If they would have left it as is: 1.) Obama could issue a pardon and kill it and 2.) If the FBI would have issued a statement with charges Obama could have issued a pardon. Now: This case is NOT closed. A pardon would have killed it! --Again: No charge gives Obama nothing to pardon, therefore Americans can reopen the case. I think this is great. He just took the card out of Obamas hands.
22 | Gina Marie Valerio Fleming | 15 | 10154770141961336_10154770219936336 | This is the very example of the corruption that has been going on far too long in our, let me repeat- OUR govt, and we sit back and allow it all to carry on by believing we can do nothing about it. Just what they want us to believe. We The People need to hold our govt accountable for their recklessness, their treason actions, over spending, etc, etc.
23 | Randall Ketcham | 14 | 10154770141961336_1323872540968358 | Especially when they had just stated that it wouldn't be finished until after the election a few days ago. Makes you wonder. At least the libtards had one thing right, Comey has to go!
24 | Roger Kinnison | 14 | 10154770141961336_10154770197271336 | You can compare the FBI checking out these E-mails to Congress passing obamacare there is no way they checked them all just like there is no way Congress knew what was in the biggest fraud ever on the American public when they passed obamacare. We knew Congress was corrupt and the FBI has followed in their footsteps.
25 | Vee Marie Liberty | 15 | 10154770141961336_1324077640947848 | Why does it matter if those emails were duplicates? The question is why were they on Anthony Weiner's and Huma's shared laptop? Does Weiner have a proper security clearance? Is it okay for him to be in possession of potentially sensitive and classified government materials regardless of whether those emails were duplicates or not?

1 | Andrew Pate | 3124 | 10154769737921336_10154770073541336 | There are 691,200 seconds in 8 days. FBI Director Comey reviewed 650,000 emails in 8 days? An email per second? It took over a year to look over a few thousand emails...there are still some Americans that aren't stupid!
2 | Rita Ruiz-Weese | 667 | 10154769737921336_10154770080406336 | Why is FBI allowing them to plead the 5th, they should be under investigation and not be in the government jobs, until the investigation is over.
3 | Jeff Hanson | 551 | 10154769737921336_10154770073726336 | Only the  ignorant can support this profoundly corrupt woman! She Belongs in Federal Prison already!!The 25 things that are truly important about Hillary instead of this left wing fluff:1. When did she know her husband was a serial abuser, and does she feel guilty for destroying his accusers?2. Explain precisely the trades made in the Cattle Futures scandal where $1,000 was turned into $99,000 in a matter of weeks?3. Why didn't she do anything to protect the Americans in Benghazi?4. Who is Saul Alinsky and why was he her mentor?5. When she was working on Watergate, why did her boss Zeifman, a lifelong Democrat, call Hillary a “liar” and “an unethical, dishonest lawyer” and have her fired?6. What really happened with Travelgate?7. What really happened with the Rose Law Firm?8. What really happened with WhiteWater?9. What gave Hillary the right to see private FBI files of her political enemies in FileGate?10. Why won't she turn over her illegal server with state department e-mails to congress?11. Why does your foundation accept money from avowed terror states?12. What is her take on the Vince Foster "Suicide"?13. Why did she think she was entitled to steal the White House furniture when she left?14. Why do you lie even about things that mean nothing: lying about being under sniper fire in Bosnia, lying about being named after Sir Edmund Hillary, or lying that your grandparents were immigrants.15. Should America be concerned that in ChinaGate, the 22 people that were convicted of fraud or for funneling Asian funds into the DNC were associates of Bill Clinton?16. Did selling stays at the Lincoln Bedroom to political donors make you feel like a wh)o(re?17. Does Hillary think Juanita Broadrick lied when she said on national news that Bill Clinton raped her?18. Is she still okay that Bill goes to pedophile island with Jeff Epstein?19. Why are there so many murdered and suicided people in the Clinton's immediate circle?20. Doesn't the fact that the Clinton Foundation has to amend 5 years of its tax returns for improper reporting imply that you were involved in an illegal RICO enterprise?21. Doesn't approving the Russian-owned Uranium One deal as secretary of state--because of illegal contributions to your foundation--in fact make you a traitor to this country?22. Was it wise to have at least four Clinton Foundation board of directors that have either been convicted or charged of the financial crimes of bribery and fraud?23. Why, Hillary, did you pay your female senate staffers 72% of what you paid your male staffers?24. When you represented an accused pedophile rapist, why did you laugh when you got him off even though you believed him to be guilty?25. She said she had one e-mail address, it came out that she had two; She said she had one device, it came out that she had two: She said none of her e-mails on her private server was classified, but when the State Dept handed over 300 e-mails the FBI redacted large sections of one, proving again she was wrong. Thus, Ms. Clinton, are you incompetent or just a congenital liar?Everyone should go on you tube and watch The Clinton Chronicles -- it will amaze you what a couple of psychopaths the Clintons really are!
4 | Jean Sagarese | 275 | 10154769737921336_10154770076046336 | beating on a computer or phone with a sledge hammer where I work would be called intent oh and that would be my Government office
5 | Eric Farmer | 141 | 10154769737921336_10154770078371336 | Exactly, people we must get out and vote for America and bringing an end to this fraud, greed, lying,  corruption and very clear felony federal law breaking. We must hold truth and justice first and foremost. No one is above the law period.
6 | Tommy Christodoulou | 139 | 10154769737921336_10154770079326336 | These are the words that should come to mind when you hear Hillary Clinton....capricious, conniving, crooked, deceitful, devious, dishonest, disloyal, dubious, fair-weather, faithless, false, fickle, fink, fly-by-night, guileful, irresponsible, questionable, shady, sharp, shifty, slippery, sneaky, treacherous, tricky, trustless, two-faced, two-timing, unassured, undependable, unreliable, unsafe, unsure, untrue, untrusty

11 | Thomas Crosson | 38 | 10154769737921336_10154770088056336 | If he loses this is who will be our next president. Close your eyes and imagine: you are a mother of 3 boys. Your oldest baby, tall, blonde headed, very kind, and whose name is Chris, makes you so proud. He graduates the University of California, later goes on to help others in the Peace Corps, teaching English in Morocco, and there develops a passion to help in the Middle East. He goes on to law school, then joins the Foreign Service so he can serve his great country as our foreign diplomat in Libya. Hillary Clinton swears him in for his post there. Things are good, then militants uprise there and want revenge on Americans for the death of Moammar Gadhafi. Your son asks for help from Clinton, who has just sworn him in there 4 months earlier, not once or twice, but 600 times. Hillary and Obama send NO AID, Marines are only 3 hrs. away. Your son and his friends are held up in the compound, which is then set afire. Your son is now dragged out onto the street ALIVE, raped, sodomized, brutalized, and murdered. Now, open your eyes, and tell me how you can even vote for Hillary Clinton!! Trump may be vulgar, he may not know how to control his mouth, but his actions hasn't killed Americans. I would rather have a Nebuchadnezzar in office than an evil Jezebel. .....Now that your eyes are opened here's the REAL story. Amb. Stevens was sent to Benghazi post haste in order to retrieve US made Stinger missiles supplied to Ansar al Sharia without Congressional oversight or permission. Hillary brokered the deal through Stevens and a private arms dealer named Marc Turi. Then some of the shoulder fired missiles ended up in Afghanistan used against our own military. It was July 25th, 2012 when a Chinook helicopter was taken down by one of our own Stingers, but the idiot Taliban didn't arm the missile and the Chinook didn't explode, but had to land anyway. An ordnance team recovered the serial number off the missile which led back to a cache of Stingers being kept in Qatar by the CIA. Obama and Hillary were now in full panic mode and Stevens was sent in to retrieve the rest of the Stingers. This was a "do-or-die" mission, which explains the stand down orders given to multiple commando teams. It was the State Dept, not the CIA that supplied them to our sworn enemies, because Petraeus wouldn't supply these deadly weapons due to their potential use on commercial aircraft. Then, Obama threw Gen. Petraeus under the bus after he refused to testify that he OK'd the BS talking points about a spontaneous uprising due to a Youtube video. Obama and Hillary committed treason...and THIS is what the investigation is all about, why she had a private server, (in order to delete the digital evidence), and why Obama, two weeks after the attack, told the UN that the attack was because of a Youtube video, even though everyone knew it was not. Further...the Taliban knew that this administration aided and abetted the enemy without Congressional approval when Boehner created the Select Cmte, and the Taliban began pushing the Obama Administration for the release of 5 Taliban Generals. Bowe Bergdahl was just a pawn...everyone KNEW he was a traitor. So we have a traitor as POTUS that is not only corrupt, but compromised...and a woman that is a serial liar, perjured herself multiple times at the Hearing whom is running for POTUS. Only the Dems, with their hands out, palms up, will support her. Perhaps this is why no military aircraft was called in...because the administration knew our enemies had Stingers.Copied and pasted...and pasted again and again and again until everyone reads this truth.... share copied..PLEASE SHARE. GO TRUMP.....

15 | Leo Rippe | 30 | 10154769737921336_10154770094771336 | Trump would be the most scrutinized president of all time. Democrats AND Republicans would be there for checks and balances. A Clinton presidency would allow her to run the country as she pleases with no checks and balances as wikileaks shows the level of corruption the democrat party has. She will flood the supreme court with athiest anti-God judges to push the liberal agenda. You are a fool if you believe attacking the church is not on their hit list. She will flood us with muslims sworn to kill us through Al-Hijra  (jihad through immigration) and your children will grow up in a literal hell having to fight those lunatics. And before you mention executive orders, remember Obama set the precedent.

A guy in the Army is in jail for far less than what Hillary has done and this guy really didnt have any evil intentions, he simply didnt know. Yet, he is in jail and Hillary is running for President. That ALONE should tell you what a fantasy land Hillary lives in and how truly messed up our government is! It should be sickening! Please tell me who you think is going to actually take her seriously after all of this!! Certainly not me and about 95% of the American population! It doesnt matter anyway, Trump is going to win by a landslide! It is not as close as the MSM claims it is. She has even had to resort to bringing celebrities to her rallies. What does that tell you? Meanwhile Trump is hitting 4 rallies or more per day in different states and they are filled with people and then he has another 50-100K watching live on facebook!!! The truth is staring you in the face and you cant even see it! You would rather believe that everything she says is 100% truth and that is just not the case!  #blind #desperate

His personal and professional relationships — all undisclosed as he announced the Bureau would not prosecute Clinton — reinforce bipartisan concerns that he may have politicized the criminal probe.These concerns focus on millions of dollars that Comey accepted from a Clinton Foundation defense contractor, Comey’s former membership on a Clinton Foundation corporate partner’s board, and his surprising financial relationship with his brother Peter Comey, who works at the law firm that does the Clinton Foundation’s taxes.Lockheed MartinI received this from my sister who is a historian/fact checker

Whether the emails had anything to do with national security or not Hilary clinton still broke the law by sending classified emails on a private server. She is supposed to be an educated lawyer who has been in and around government agencies for 30 years and should have known how to handle classified emails. Saying it was an honest mistake just goes to show she thinks she can do anything and get away with it. At the very least she mishandled classified emails and should be charged. Whether this was intentional or not, it is her responsibility to make sure they were properly handled.

Sorry to burst the liberal unicorn farts pretty patty bubble but that's reality. We got duped this time twice now, but by the will and grace of God, we will not be duped on Tuesday! EDIT** Yes computer programs looking for keywords exist but what needed to be done was thorough double checking and human oversight! To ONLY use a computer program and call that investigating is PURPOSELY DECEITFUL!!!!!!!!
2 | Sue Buzek | 668 | 10154769854031336_10154769958821336 | This has been happening for weeks. The Clintons themselves stood outside of a polling location in Florida shaking hands and trying to garner votes. When is enough going to be enough?? Someone needs to take her down a peg.

And everyone else in her inner circle has to  take the 5th. Yea, thats it liberals, you still want to vote for this. And when your kids cant go out an play because of terrorist bombs (wide open borders and more Syrian refugees) going off daily..remember who you voted for. And to ALL mothers who votes for her...NEVER EVER tell you children, to be a good person you have to always tell the truth. YOU gave up that right knowing deep down in your heart this woman is a liar and as corrupt as they come, and you were OK with that.
5 | Greg Long | 177 | 10154769854031336_10154769977051336 | We have witnessed the largest, most elaborate political coverup in history. Obama's Department of Justice, the mass media, the DNC and Hillary Clinton have almost succeeded, by attacking Trump. Their defense, was to go on offense and they flooded the media, with claims of violence, found to be planned and instigated by paid Team Hillary goons, who even rehearsed before hand. Their offense was all staged and fake. It’s all fake. Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt, dishonest politician to ever run for office.
6 | Genie Hess Burk | 85 | 10154769854031336_10154769968761336 | It's only illegal if it's pro Trump. A man was arrested for wearing a Trump t-shirt when he went to vote but this is okay? There is no justice... evil prevails... hopefully Tuesday will bring change. If not America as a democratic God loving nation is no longer.

11 | Brenda Lee Rather | 29 | 10154769854031336_10154769987661336 | If you're under 50 you really need to read this. If you’re over 50, you lived through it, so share it with those under 50. Amazing to me how much I had forgotten!When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over a health care reform. Even after threats and intimidation, she couldn’t even get a vote in a democratic controlled congress. This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million in cost for studies, promotion, and other efforts.Then President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general. Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood – both were forced to withdraw their names from consideration. Next she chose Janet Reno – husband Bill described her selection as “my worst mistake.” Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.Husband Bill allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission. Lani Guanier was her selection. When a little probing led to the discovery of Ms. Guanier’s radical views, her name had to be withdrawn from consideration.Apparently a slow learner, husband Bill allowed Hillary to make some more recommendations. She chose former law partners Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department. Her selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kennedy was forced to resign.Many younger votes will have no knowledge of “Travelgate.” Hillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend Harry Thompson – and the White House Travel Office refused to comply. She managed to have them reported to the FBI and fired. This ruined their reputations, cost them their jobs, and caused a thirty-six month investigation. Only one employee, Billy Dale was charged with a crime, and that of the enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds. A jury acquitted him of any crime in less than two hours.Still not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House security. When Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies (Filegate) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff, suddenly Hillary and the president denied even knowing Livingstone, and of course, denied knowledge of drug use in the White House.Following this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents.Next, when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by Bill Clinton, Hillary was put in charge of the scandal defense. Some of her more notable decisions in the debacle were:She urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation they settled with Ms. Jones.She refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor. After $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr's investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs.Hillary’s game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for 'lying under oath' to a grand jury and then his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives.Hillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, “I do not recall,” “I have no recollection,” and “I don’t know” a total of 56 times while under oath.After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had stolen.Now we are exposed to the destruction of possibly incriminating emails while Hillary was Secretary of State and the “pay to play” schemes of the Clinton Foundation – we have no idea what shoe will fall next. But to her loyal fans (supporters) - I guess in her own words “what difference does it make?” I guess being a female Democrat is all that matters. By the way, I'd post the same if she were a Republican. You see, she's already been in the White House, she has a record we can review.Hillary for prison 2016 would be a good start to help make America safe again. Written by Kent Larsen, a well informed man, as I lived thru this as well.
12 | Tonya Hicks Willmore | 19 | 10154769854031336_10154769973856336 | If you are Gay, Why are you voting for Hillary when she wants to bring in thousands of refugees that believe all Gays should be executed?If you are Black, Why are you voting for Hillary when she admires Margaret Sanger and defends Planned Parenthood who want to abort as many black babies as possible? Exterminate the black race because they are like "weeds". (Margaret Sanger quote) Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.If you are a Christian, Why are you voting for Hillary Clinton when she wrote her Senior thesis on Saul Alinsky who dedicated his book 'Rules for Radicals' to Lucifer (the Devil)? She says he was, and still is her mentor.If you are a Veteran, in the Military, or closely related to a Military member, Why are you voting for Hillary when she left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again? They called for help but the help was told to stand down.If you have a factory job, Why are you voting for Hillary when she supported TPP? Factory workers are being laid off because jobs are going over seas. Don't forget the deals she's made with china. She also welcomes open borders and illegals to get benefits to be paid with Your tax money.If you are poor, Why are you voting for Hillary, when she is supporting Wall street and all the big banks? Big banks keep poor people poor by destroying the poor man's credit by allowing medical bills and collections to affect your credit scores so you can pay higher interest rates than the rich; Taking much of the little money you earn.If you are a Woman, how can you vote for Hillary when she has buried all of Bills rape victims under the rug, including that little girl that was raped? Lawyer Hillary defended the rapist, and then she laughed about it later, knowing that he was guilty.If you carry a gun, or believe in the Constitution; How can you vote for Hillary when she wants to eliminate the NRA, Take your guns, and abolish the second Amendment?If you breathe, Why would you vote for Hillary when she and the Clinton crime family have left a trail of dead people that did not agree with her, or they knew too much?Who is left?
13 | Lissa Kristine | 17 | 10154769854031336_10154770031571336 | What can you expect from a government so corrupt that the President of the USA would go on live TV and encourage illegal aliens (criminals) to vote and tell them to have no fear of prosecution while doing so........it would be like me sneaking across the border into Russia and attempting to sway their elections when I am not a legal citizen of their country while Putin pats me on the head and says good job......of course that would never happen there, I'd be shot.

14 | Danielle Latona | 24 | 10154769854031336_10154769984726336 | Why would they stop doing anything illegally when their candidate has gotten away with more criminal activity than every mob family together. This is a disgrace and more than half of Americans will NEVER accept her as President IF she wins.
15 | Erin Marie Yager | 26 | 10154769854031336_1606325092996899 | I'm all about live and let live. But this is getting crazy! For example, I have a friend who gets about $800 a month in social security. Her spouse can't work at this time, and his monthly insurance premium is jumping from @ $230 per month to about $750 per month. If she didn't take on a part time job, that would leave them with less than $50 a month to live on. So while the wealthy celebrities are stumping for Clinton, and the people on subsidized health care are voting for Clinton, the people who have worked all of their lives, and those of us in the middle class are getting screwed. I've seen people's names changed because they bought a new social security card illegally, I've been to the richest cities in the country with people sleeping on the sidewalks, I've been called racist because I don't agree with this administration, I've seen towers fall, and I've seen my hometown county turn into the 2nd most affected by meth and heroin in NY state, (of which Clinton was a Senator). I've watched videos of Clinton saying she was against gay marriage, that she was for a border wall, called young black men "super predators" and her outright lies about a little place called Benghazi. As I've said before, I don't know if Trump is the answer, but this woman, with all of the opportunity she has had to affect change, is definitely not the answer. She walked into Washington 40 plus years ago with the sole purpose to gain the Presidency. It's been about her the entire time. Kicked off the Watergate case for taking home documents, lying under oath, and the most recent admission of accepting an unreported gift of 1 million dollars from a foreign nation (that which you need to report). They left Haiti, still in ruins. This woman can't even wear an American flag pin, as to not offend her foreign counterparts. This is not the America my ancestors came here for. Scared to speak your mind, less control over your children's upbringing, and a new database with your private healthcare information going straight to the government. All true. All evidence based in fact. When Tuesday is over, one way or another it's gonna be scary. I just hope. I don't know what I hope. But I'm gonna have a back up plan. GN, and stay safe.

I've said it many times ... double standard much???
21 | Joe Mulvaney Jr | 2 | 10154769854031336_10154770016401336 | Sorry to let the cat out of the bag but they already have. The Hispanic vote and Latino vote in early voting in Florida is up a hundred and 20% that is terrible news for Trump the Latinos are building a big wall to keep him out of the White House. Same pattern in other states states with early voting that have a large Hispanic population same thing well over 100% increase. Trump cannot win without carrying Florida. He also has to Cary North Carolina Day Report early at 9 o'clock they Will know  North Carolina's outcome if Trump has lost it the election is over. The truth is the Democratic Party is almost assured the presidency forever now because of the demographics. Within six years Texas will be a blue state because of the Hispanic vote.

23 | Patricia Melancon | 8 | 10154769854031336_10154769983636336 | Sure nothing was done about it just like nothing was done to the uniformed Black Panthers who stood in front of the doors of polling place in 2012 Obama election and intimidated especially elderly white voters.
24 | Shareen Means | 8 | 10154769854031336_10154769973846336 | I really believe that black people are much smarter and wiser than just voting for someone because she happens to have a rapper or a basketball player along to cater to them. Please please tell me I am right!!! Please tell me black people are sick of the status quo. There are over 94 MILLION PEOPLE OUT OF THE WORK FORCE!!!! 94 MILLION!!
25 | Jonathan Scott | 0 | 10154769854031336_1606340042995404 | Ohio and Pennsylvania anyone show a driver of Benjamin Franklin Trump super pacts vehicle a selfie with a picture of them voting for trump  the driver and passenger will give you a Benjamin Franklin. They will be outside many voting stations in Ohio and Pennsylvania. The Benin Franklin's are donated from a super pack just look for vehicles usually white vans that say Trump Benjamin Franklin super pack or reverse. This may happen in Florida just not enough volunteers yet for Florida. New York State take your selfie to TRump towers or properties or Republicans head quarters.

He said the new emails would take months to review.... But took a week to conclude Hillary was not guilty. The system is #Rigged but not to worry the silent majority will have the FINAL say on Tuesday.
5 | Tim Cooper | 129 | 10154769900236336_10154769941421336 | In the last days there will be earthquakes in diverse places. Wars and rumors of wars. Get your houses in order, for the Lord God shall return very soon.

12 | Kevin King | 18 | 10154769900236336_10154769942041336 | So tired of Megan Kelly interupting her own guests with her her biased opinions, fox if you don't dump her you will loose your viewers starting with me.
13 | Franklin M. Porter | 11 | 10154769900236336_10154769933891336 | It happened the same exact moment that Mary Fallin realized, Question 779 was going to pass in her state and she will have to start paying teachers fairly and put storm shelters in all schools. Starting with the elementary schools. BOOMER!!!
14 | Cynthia Michelle | 10 | 10154769900236336_10154769945631336 | You all need to check with OKC news stations. There was quite a bit of damage in Cushing. Windows broken and I believe a wall fell from a building. There are a lot of pics on their Facebook pages.
15 | Pam Andrews | 18 | 10154769900236336_10154769913751336 | Before you all go crazy, no, hillbillie did not pay for the earthquake to strike. LOL It was all her voters running AWAY from her! Seriously, hoping all are safe, if a bit shaken by this.
