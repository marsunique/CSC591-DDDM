--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Logan Anderson | 1 | 10154812213809729_10154812394729729 | I don't understand why news reports continue to use the words "slim," "narrow" or "small" margin between Trump and Clinton in polls. Take this article, for example. The lede describes Clinton as maintaining a "narrow" 4-point advantage over Trump. Barack Obama won the popular vote count by 4 percentage points in 2012 ... that wasn't described as "narrow" or "slim." Why is this lead described as such?
2 | Kathie Routman Dior | 1 | 10154812213809729_10154812472149729 | HARD CORE DEMOCRATS don't care that Hillary Clinton flip flops her views as needed to get votes. They don't care that she has lied repeatedly for years. They don't care that she helped create a health care system that is about to fail, leaving millions by the wayside. They don't care that she was instrumental in the very creation of a morphed Al Qaeda, now called ISIS. They don't care that millions of people have either died or have been displaced by her instrumentation of such. They don't care that her Clinton Foundation has taken hundreds of millions of dollars from countries that kill gays and stone women. They don't care that she has committed treasonous acts via her foundation by doing favors for enemy nations. They don't care that she and her husband have created an enterprise whereby all the mainstream media, including the New York Times, CNN, NBC, ABC, Comcast, can donate. They don't care that she has been so incredibly successful at wielding money and power from the world's largest companies, here and abroad, that she rules over the entire Obama administration, including President Obama, Attorney General Loretta Lynch, and FBI director James Comey. They don't care that she believes killing a baby hours before its natural birth trumps a mother's choice to have the baby slaughtered. They don't care that she has never done anything to improve the plight of Blacks or Hispanics who may be caught in a inter-generational web of dependency, poverty, and unemployment. They don't care that she has done nothing about the bad schools, drugs, and crime in the ghetto. They don't care that she is indifferent to the millions of immigrants who come to our shores legally, and spend large amounts of time and money in order to become U.S. citizens, while others cut in line. They don't care that she has done nothing to stop drugs from infiltrating our towns and cities. They don't care that she blatantly cheated by being given primary debate questions in advance. They don't care to think about why her answers during the debates seemed so well rehearsed, almost memorized. They don't care that her organization worked to plant violent operatives in Trump rallies. They don't care about how women were paid off to claim harassment by Trump. You know what? The problem is not that hard core democrats don't care that Hillary Clinton is a liar, a cheat, and a thief. The problem is that they are willing to support a morally bankrupt candidate.

Over the course of his entire presidential campaign, Donald Trump has been in a war with the media, often accusing news outlets of fabricating negatives stories about him to hurt his White House bid. While Trump's battle with the media is at an all-time high, there's one story that most mainstream media outlets have avoided reporting.Trump lawsuitIn the summer of 1994, a woman known only as "Jane Doe" was allegedly raped and threatened by Trump and convicted pedophile Jeffery Epstein. The woman previously filed a lawsuit in California, but the judge dismissed the case. Attempting to have her voice heard once again, "Jane Doe" made her case once again and it was strong enough to move forward in a New York court. Federal Judge Ronnie Abrams has since ordered a status conference to be held on December 16, with the legal representatives of both sides being present in the courtroom. As pointed out by the Bipartisan Report on October 23, new details have been revealed, painting a grim and dark picture about what allegedly went down over 20 years ago.The victim, known as "Jane Doe," filed the lawsuit under her assumed real name of Katie Johnson. Details in the lawsuit claim that she was the subject of, but not limited to, "acts of rape, sexual misconduct, criminal sexual acts," as well as "false imprisonment" and "threats of death." The incident apparently took place on more than one occasion, with the most emotionally scaring encounter occurring during the fourth and final time."Trump tied Plaintiff to a bed, exposed himself to Plaintiff, and then proceeded to forcibly rape Plaintiff," the lawsuit continues, describing the alleged rape as a "savage sexual attack." The plaintiff, "Jane Done" or Katie Johnson, claims she "loudly pleaded" for the former host of "The Apprentice" to stop, before he "violently" struck her face with his hand and informed the victim that he would "do whatever he wanted."In yet another bizarre twist to the alleged encounter, Epstein reportedly got into a heated exchange with Trump for taking the victim's virginity because he wanted to be the one to do so. In conclusion, both the Republican nominee and Epstein allegedly told the plaintiff that they would kill her and her family if she ever spoke about what happened.  A witness has come forward to confirm her story.Hiring Women Based on AppearancesGroping a Woman at a Manhattan NightclubGroping and Kissing a Former Apprentice ContestantKissing a Mar-a-Lago Guest at a Mother’s Day BrunchGroping a Woman Outside the 1998 U.S. Open Tennis ChampionshipSalma Hayak comes forward:  Trump planted a negative article about her after she refused to date himAn 11th person has come forward with allegations.

8 | Sergey Malovatov | 0 | 10154812213809729_10154812440354729 | Do not trust the mainstream news media networks!Any person who loves his or her nation will get out and vote for Donald Trump! The media outlets managers are controlled by the corrupt and crime-riven government and multinational corporations who do not care about America or American people.Hillary Clinton has been exposed as a seasoned criminal with multiple offences and a more horrible person than any other modern politician! Regardless of FBI’s recent announcement that the Clinton email probe is over, new pieces of evidence against scandal-riven Hillary Clinton may well appear any moment and new charges against her will be brought with renewed vigor. Hillary Clinton is too tainted to be a reliable contender for any future political role or public office. Hillary’s days are over! She is a political cadaver and a too incompetent and physically and mentally exhausted person. Hillary Clinton is being protected by the donor to the Clinton Foundation. Her past crimes and multi-million donations make Hillary Clinton even more dependent on her bosses. A new batch of WikiLeaks-revealed emails might appear at any moment and Hillary Clinton will become faced with a grim prospect being indicted for her past sins.Hillary Clinton suffers a degenerative cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) that occurs when blood clots form in the brain's venous sinuses. She was diagnosed with CVST back in 2013. CVST prevents blood from draining out of her brain. It leads to deteriorating physical and mental condition, strokes, fainting, and occasional mental shutdowns. A sudden medical event on her part might easily prevent Hillary Clinton from being used by her special interest groups as their representative. That is why this aspect of Hillary Clinton’s ability to perform the duties of president has been closely guarded by her family members, her corporate handlers, and campaign managers.They certainly will not be stopped by the fact that Hillary Clinton and her team are greedy, incompetent, disloyal, untrustworthy, pathetic losers who have no idea how to run a country... The Clintons are totally corrupt and their political machinery are but gangsters, fraudsters, and corrupt politicians backed by certain corporations and financiers. Hillary Clinton is totally incompetent and wholly dependent on her domestic and foreign donors, was to be elected president. Hillary Clinton is too unqualified to be president! Everybody knows that. But the desire to put their own person in that position is too strong for certain interest groups to resist it. That is why we have been witnessing such unprecedented collusion of the political interests and power of the US government, the economic interests and power of the corporations, and the personal and administrative interests and power of the mainstream news media managers trying to create an illusion that Hillary Clinton has more popular support than she could ever dream of, based on her personal track record and abilities.That is why we cannot trust the mainstream media's lies about Hillary Clinton and her political circle. Frail, incompetent, and increasingly vulnerable, she has surrounded herself with a team of advisers and experts that are just as corrupt, unprincipled, and incompetent as Hillary Clinton herself is. Her staff is corrupt and unreliable to an appallingly high degree. Personally, she cannot make a good informed decision with this regard! As she gets increasingly fragile physically and mentally, practically all Hillary Clinton’s picks inevitably become manipulative and untrustworthy almost from the start of their hapless careers. HRC can be best compared to a ringleader with high ambitions but rapidly diminishing capabilities. Like in a typical mob, they are picked based on their criminality, loyalty to their boss, and readiness to violate any law and regulation – including the Constitution – to please their criminally minded leaders.People like Hillary Clinton and her immensely corrupt and dishonest cronies cannot be highly qualified experts in anything except deception, fraud, theft, and other criminal activities. The corrupt and dishonest Clinton family along with their treasonous advisers and treacherous filthy rich donors from the Wall Street and foreign corporations can only bring terror, impoverishment, and disgrace to the nation!

11 | Rita Diane Palmer | 0 | 10154812213809729_10154812677694729 | Trump supporters believe it’s OK to close our borders to any and all Muslim immigrants and to keep close tabs on all 3 million Muslims already in the United States, and they believe that President Donald Trump would be ISIS’ worst nightmare.They believe Donald Trump’s unceasing stream of bullshit for a wide variety of reasons that, as we have seen, are unlikely to change — no matter what bullshit he says. So say the researchers:------------------Bullshit is a consequential aspect of the human condition. Indeed, with the rise of communication technology, people are likely encountering more bullshit in their everyday lives than ever before. … Using vagueness or ambiguity to mask a lack of meaningfulness is surely common in political rhetoric, marketing, and even academia. One of the most salient features of our culture is that there is so much bullshit. Everyone knows this. Each of us contributes his share. One benefit of gaining a better understanding of how we reject others’ bullshit is that it may teach us to be more cognizant of our own bullshit.

Over the course of his entire presidential campaign, Donald Trump has been in a war with the media, often accusing news outlets of fabricating negatives stories about him to hurt his White House bid. While Trump's battle with the media is at an all-time high, there's one story that most mainstream media outlets have avoided reporting.Trump lawsuitIn the summer of 1994, a woman known only as "Jane Doe" was allegedly raped and threatened by Trump and convicted pedophile Jeffery Epstein. The woman previously filed a lawsuit in California, but the judge dismissed the case. Attempting to have her voice heard once again, "Jane Doe" made her case once again and it was strong enough to move forward in a New York court. Federal Judge Ronnie Abrams has since ordered a status conference to be held on December 16, with the legal representatives of both sides being present in the courtroom. As pointed out by the Bipartisan Report on October 23, new details have been revealed, painting a grim and dark picture about what allegedly went down over 20 years ago.The victim, known as "Jane Doe," filed the lawsuit under her assumed real name of Katie Johnson. Details in the lawsuit claim that she was the subject of, but not limited to, "acts of rape, sexual misconduct, criminal sexual acts," as well as "false imprisonment" and "threats of death." The incident apparently took place on more than one occasion, with the most emotionally scaring encounter occurring during the fourth and final time."Trump tied Plaintiff to a bed, exposed himself to Plaintiff, and then proceeded to forcibly rape Plaintiff," the lawsuit continues, describing the alleged rape as a "savage sexual attack." The plaintiff, "Jane Done" or Katie Johnson, claims she "loudly pleaded" for the former host of "The Apprentice" to stop, before he "violently" struck her face with his hand and informed the victim that he would "do whatever he wanted."In yet another bizarre twist to the alleged encounter, Epstein reportedly got into a heated exchange with Trump for taking the victim's virginity because he wanted to be the one to do so. In conclusion, both the Republican nominee and Epstein allegedly told the plaintiff that they would kill her and her family if she ever spoke about what happened.  A witness has come forward to confirm her story.Hiring Women Based on AppearancesGroping a Woman at a Manhattan NightclubGroping and Kissing a Former Apprentice ContestantKissing a Mar-a-Lago Guest at a Mother’s Day BrunchGroping a Woman Outside the 1998 U.S. Open Tennis ChampionshipSalma Hayak comes forward:  Trump planted a negative article about her after she refused to date himAn 11th person has come forward with allegations.

A creature, who started its presidential campaign calling its opponent "crucket". Republicans, who are responsible for letting a retarded nutbag and low-life creature represent them now owes it to the American people to act in an intelligent way in Congress. Trump is a criminal, a facist and looks like a pig and he'll be dealt with that way! Clinton is "much more a man" than Trump. Trump is a chicken! Period! Trump - because he is stupid and ignorant - thinks 640.000 e-mails cannot be checked in 8 days.Technology today exists which in less than millisecond can check 640.000 e-mails (an advanced stage of quantum mechanics) Vote Hillary, November 8, 2016 and sanity will still prevail.Ps.

Regardless of FBI’s recent announcement that the Clinton email probe is over, new pieces of evidence against scandal-riven Hillary Clinton may well appear any moment and new charges against her will be brought with renewed vigor. Hillary Clinton is too tainted to be a reliable contender for any future political role or public office. Hillary’s days are over! She is a political cadaver and a too incompetent and physically and mentally exhausted person. Hillary Clinton is being protected by the donor to the Clinton Foundation. Her past crimes and multi-million donations make Hillary Clinton even more dependent on her bosses. A new batch of WikiLeaks-revealed emails might appear at any moment and Hillary Clinton will become faced with a grim prospect being indicted for her past sins.Hillary Clinton suffers a degenerative cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) that occurs when blood clots form in the brain's venous sinuses. She was diagnosed with CVST back in 2013. CVST prevents blood from draining out of her brain. It leads to deteriorating physical and mental condition, strokes, fainting, and occasional mental shutdowns. A sudden medical event on her part might easily prevent Hillary Clinton from being used by her special interest groups as their representative. That is why this aspect of Hillary Clinton’s ability to perform the duties of president has been closely guarded by her family members, her corporate handlers, and campaign managers.They certainly will not be stopped by the fact that Hillary Clinton and her team are greedy, incompetent, disloyal, untrustworthy, pathetic losers who have no idea how to run a country... The Clintons are totally corrupt and their political machinery are but gangsters, fraudsters, and corrupt politicians backed by certain corporations and financiers. Hillary Clinton is totally incompetent and wholly dependent on her domestic and foreign donors, was to be elected president. Hillary Clinton is too unqualified to be president! Everybody knows that. But the desire to put their own person in that position is too strong for certain interest groups to resist it. That is why we have been witnessing such unprecedented collusion of the political interests and power of the US government, the economic interests and power of the corporations, and the personal and administrative interests and power of the mainstream news media managers trying to create an illusion that Hillary Clinton has more popular support than she could ever dream of, based on her personal track record and abilities.That is why we cannot trust the mainstream media's lies about Hillary Clinton and her political circle. Frail, incompetent, and increasingly vulnerable, she has surrounded herself with a team of advisers and experts that are just as corrupt, unprincipled, and incompetent as Hillary Clinton herself is. Her staff is corrupt and unreliable to an appallingly high degree. Personally, she cannot make a good informed decision with this regard! As she gets increasingly fragile physically and mentally, practically all Hillary Clinton’s picks inevitably become manipulative and untrustworthy almost from the start of their hapless careers. HRC can be best compared to a ringleader with high ambitions but rapidly diminishing capabilities. Like in a typical mob, they are picked based on their criminality, loyalty to their boss, and readiness to violate any law and regulation – including the Constitution – to please their criminally minded leaders.People like Hillary Clinton and her immensely corrupt and dishonest cronies cannot be highly qualified experts in anything except deception, fraud, theft, and other criminal activities. The corrupt and dishonest Clinton family along with their treasonous advisers and treacherous filthy rich donors from the Wall Street and foreign corporations can only bring terror, impoverishment, and disgrace to the nation!

Weiner’s estranged wife, Huma Abedin, is a Clinton confidante.Two law enforcement sources familiar with the FBI’s New York Field Office, which initially discovered the emails, said a faction of investigators based in the office is known to be hostile to Hillary Clinton. A spokeswoman for the FBI’s New York office said she had no knowledge about this.Democratic Party sources said such a faction was likely responsible for a recent surge in media leaks on alleged details of an ongoing FBI investigation of the Clinton Foundation.The lasting scandal to come out of the 2016 election might be the FBI, not Hillary Clinton’s emails. It is clear that there is something amiss in the bureau. If Democrats win control of the Senate on Tuesday, it is almost certain that they will launch an investigation into the FBI’s investigation of Clinton.FBI agents could be violating the law in an attempt to use their public sector jobs to interfere in a presidential election. What the anti-Clinton faction of the FBI is engaging in is a threat to US democracy.A group of FBI agents who are hostile to Hillary Clinton are trying to undermine a presidential election. That sentence reads like the plot to a Hollywood blockbuster, but that is what appears to be happening in real life in the final days of a presidential campaign.These FBI Agents were working with Rudy Giuliani to help Trump.  Agents who are Anti-Hillary are working with the Trump Campaign, Breitbart’s Bannon and a couple of others within the Trump Campaign.  Their Campaign knew in advance, that Comey was going to issue the Email to the GOP.  The GOP got it first, then it was passed on the Democrats.  There is also talk about emails being synched into Antony Weiner’s Emails, by the FBI and a proper Warrant, was not obtained?Should Hillary Clinton win the presidency, she may end up doing so by overcoming more obstacles than any other presidential candidate in US history.Clinton Foundation:  Trump and Fox News are Saying Clinton "Likely" to be Indicted.  This is a False and Ill Informed, Inaccurate and Without Merit.  Fox News has walked back their claims.Nor, is the Anthony Weiner investigation, “Likely” to lead to an indictment against Hillary Clinton.Comey is being Investigated for interfering with the Election.  “Hatch Act”Rudy Giuliani is also under investigation for leaking information to the Trump Campaign.Democrats now have all the motivation that they will ever need to get out and vote.STOP THE RIGHT-WING, ALT-RIGHT MADNESS DEMOCRATS!

Over the course of his entire presidential campaign, Donald Trump has been in a war with the media, often accusing news outlets of fabricating negatives stories about him to hurt his White House bid. While Trump's battle with the media is at an all-time high, there's one story that most mainstream media outlets have avoided reporting.Trump lawsuitIn the summer of 1994, a woman known only as "Jane Doe" was allegedly raped and threatened by Trump and convicted pedophile Jeffery Epstein. The woman previously filed a lawsuit in California, but the judge dismissed the case. Attempting to have her voice heard once again, "Jane Doe" made her case once again and it was strong enough to move forward in a New York court. Federal Judge Ronnie Abrams has since ordered a status conference to be held on December 16, with the legal representatives of both sides being present in the courtroom. As pointed out by the Bipartisan Report on October 23, new details have been revealed, painting a grim and dark picture about what allegedly went down over 20 years ago.The victim, known as "Jane Doe," filed the lawsuit under her assumed real name of Katie Johnson. Details in the lawsuit claim that she was the subject of, but not limited to, "acts of rape, sexual misconduct, criminal sexual acts," as well as "false imprisonment" and "threats of death." The incident apparently took place on more than one occasion, with the most emotionally scaring encounter occurring during the fourth and final time."Trump tied Plaintiff to a bed, exposed himself to Plaintiff, and then proceeded to forcibly rape Plaintiff," the lawsuit continues, describing the alleged rape as a "savage sexual attack." The plaintiff, "Jane Done" or Katie Johnson, claims she "loudly pleaded" for the former host of "The Apprentice" to stop, before he "violently" struck her face with his hand and informed the victim that he would "do whatever he wanted."In yet another bizarre twist to the alleged encounter, Epstein reportedly got into a heated exchange with Trump for taking the victim's virginity because he wanted to be the one to do so. In conclusion, both the Republican nominee and Epstein allegedly told the plaintiff that they would kill her and her family if she ever spoke about what happened.  A witness has come forward to confirm her story.Hiring Women Based on AppearancesGroping a Woman at a Manhattan NightclubGroping and Kissing a Former Apprentice ContestantKissing a Mar-a-Lago Guest at a Mother’s Day BrunchGroping a Woman Outside the 1998 U.S. Open Tennis ChampionshipSalma Hayak comes forward:  Trump planted a negative article about her after she refused to date himAn 11th person has come forward with allegations.

He is not true to his words - all babble - no action!Trump is a nutbag, which in no way is fit for being the President and Commander in Chief of the highest public office on this planet! A creature, who started its presidential campaign calling its opponent "crucket". Republicans, who are responsible for letting a retarded nutbag and low-life creature represent them now owes it to the American people to act in an intelligent way in Congress. Trump is a criminal, a facist and looks like a pig and he'll be dealt with that way! Clinton is "much more a man" than Trump. Trump is a chicken! Period! Trump - because he is stupid and ignorant - thinks 640.000 e-mails cannot be checked in 8 days.Technology today exists which in less than millisecond can check 640.000 e-mails (an advanced stage of quantum mechanics) Vote Hillary, November 8, 2016 and sanity will still prevail.Ps. Sanity will prevail! Hillary is the winner! I know! God bless.

2 | Sergey Malovatov | 0 | 10154811772554729_10154812442099729 | Do not trust the mainstream news media networks!Any person who loves his or her nation will get out and vote for Donald Trump! The media outlets managers are controlled by the corrupt and crime-riven government and multinational corporations who do not care about America or American people.Hillary Clinton has been exposed as a seasoned criminal with multiple offences and a more horrible person than any other modern politician! Regardless of FBI’s recent announcement that the Clinton email probe is over, new pieces of evidence against scandal-riven Hillary Clinton may well appear any moment and new charges against her will be brought with renewed vigor. Hillary Clinton is too tainted to be a reliable contender for any future political role or public office. Hillary’s days are over! She is a political cadaver and a too incompetent and physically and mentally exhausted person. Hillary Clinton is being protected by the donor to the Clinton Foundation. Her past crimes and multi-million donations make Hillary Clinton even more dependent on her bosses. A new batch of WikiLeaks-revealed emails might appear at any moment and Hillary Clinton will become faced with a grim prospect being indicted for her past sins.Hillary Clinton suffers a degenerative cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) that occurs when blood clots form in the brain's venous sinuses. She was diagnosed with CVST back in 2013. CVST prevents blood from draining out of her brain. It leads to deteriorating physical and mental condition, strokes, fainting, and occasional mental shutdowns. A sudden medical event on her part might easily prevent Hillary Clinton from being used by her special interest groups as their representative. That is why this aspect of Hillary Clinton’s ability to perform the duties of president has been closely guarded by her family members, her corporate handlers, and campaign managers.They certainly will not be stopped by the fact that Hillary Clinton and her team are greedy, incompetent, disloyal, untrustworthy, pathetic losers who have no idea how to run a country... The Clintons are totally corrupt and their political machinery are but gangsters, fraudsters, and corrupt politicians backed by certain corporations and financiers. Hillary Clinton is totally incompetent and wholly dependent on her domestic and foreign donors, was to be elected president. Hillary Clinton is too unqualified to be president! Everybody knows that. But the desire to put their own person in that position is too strong for certain interest groups to resist it. That is why we have been witnessing such unprecedented collusion of the political interests and power of the US government, the economic interests and power of the corporations, and the personal and administrative interests and power of the mainstream news media managers trying to create an illusion that Hillary Clinton has more popular support than she could ever dream of, based on her personal track record and abilities.That is why we cannot trust the mainstream media's lies about Hillary Clinton and her political circle. Frail, incompetent, and increasingly vulnerable, she has surrounded herself with a team of advisers and experts that are just as corrupt, unprincipled, and incompetent as Hillary Clinton herself is. Her staff is corrupt and unreliable to an appallingly high degree. Personally, she cannot make a good informed decision with this regard! As she gets increasingly fragile physically and mentally, practically all Hillary Clinton’s picks inevitably become manipulative and untrustworthy almost from the start of their hapless careers. HRC can be best compared to a ringleader with high ambitions but rapidly diminishing capabilities. Like in a typical mob, they are picked based on their criminality, loyalty to their boss, and readiness to violate any law and regulation – including the Constitution – to please their criminally minded leaders.People like Hillary Clinton and her immensely corrupt and dishonest cronies cannot be highly qualified experts in anything except deception, fraud, theft, and other criminal activities. The corrupt and dishonest Clinton family along with their treasonous advisers and treacherous filthy rich donors from the Wall Street and foreign corporations can only bring terror, impoverishment, and disgrace to the nation!

The economy remeans weak with dismal job growth . Our national debt has grown to 20 trillion dollars.  Obama and Hillary have shown a lack of support for law enforcement and our military. The broken VA Administration remains. Our national security is threatened; illegal immigration, and Obama / Clinton failures in the Middle East with their lead from behind strategy. No, we don't need Hillary to be President to continue down this path of failure. No we don't need Hillary for president who is still under FBI investigation for corruption and racketeering at the Clinton Foundation.

Over the course of his entire presidential campaign, Donald Trump has been in a war with the media, often accusing news outlets of fabricating negatives stories about him to hurt his White House bid. While Trump's battle with the media is at an all-time high, there's one story that most mainstream media outlets have avoided reporting.Trump lawsuitIn the summer of 1994, a woman known only as "Jane Doe" was allegedly raped and threatened by Trump and convicted pedophile Jeffery Epstein. The woman previously filed a lawsuit in California, but the judge dismissed the case. Attempting to have her voice heard once again, "Jane Doe" made her case once again and it was strong enough to move forward in a New York court. Federal Judge Ronnie Abrams has since ordered a status conference to be held on December 16, with the legal representatives of both sides being present in the courtroom. As pointed out by the Bipartisan Report on October 23, new details have been revealed, painting a grim and dark picture about what allegedly went down over 20 years ago.The victim, known as "Jane Doe," filed the lawsuit under her assumed real name of Katie Johnson. Details in the lawsuit claim that she was the subject of, but not limited to, "acts of rape, sexual misconduct, criminal sexual acts," as well as "false imprisonment" and "threats of death." The incident apparently took place on more than one occasion, with the most emotionally scaring encounter occurring during the fourth and final time."Trump tied Plaintiff to a bed, exposed himself to Plaintiff, and then proceeded to forcibly rape Plaintiff," the lawsuit continues, describing the alleged rape as a "savage sexual attack." The plaintiff, "Jane Done" or Katie Johnson, claims she "loudly pleaded" for the former host of "The Apprentice" to stop, before he "violently" struck her face with his hand and informed the victim that he would "do whatever he wanted."In yet another bizarre twist to the alleged encounter, Epstein reportedly got into a heated exchange with Trump for taking the victim's virginity because he wanted to be the one to do so. In conclusion, both the Republican nominee and Epstein allegedly told the plaintiff that they would kill her and her family if she ever spoke about what happened.  A witness has come forward to confirm her story.Hiring Women Based on AppearancesGroping a Woman at a Manhattan NightclubGroping and Kissing a Former Apprentice ContestantKissing a Mar-a-Lago Guest at a Mother’s Day BrunchGroping a Woman Outside the 1998 U.S. Open Tennis ChampionshipSalma Hayak comes forward:  Trump planted a negative article about her after she refused to date himAn 11th person has come forward with allegations.

Example…Hillary Clinton is running for President Of The United States, and she is married to ex-President Bill Clinton who is a known Sexual Predator and Liar. Both Bill and Hillary are involved with the Clinton Foundation which is under investigation by the FBI for RICO Violations….. Hillary Clinton has been investigated by the FBI herself for using a private E-Mail server while in government service…A recent E-Mail hack of the DNC provided hundreds of E-Mails showing corruption and collusion among the Hillary Clinton Camp, The Media, and the Government itself…Charges will not be brought forth due to the fact that as the E-Mails have shown…Those who would indict Hillary are the ones that have been corrupted. Classic Mafia Style Corruption…Hillary has chosen Huma Abedin to be her right-hand person and confidant. Huma Abedin is under FBI Investigation…. Huma Abedin was married to ex-Congressman Anthony Weiner who is also under FBI Investigation for being a Pedophile, and Sexual Predator ….. Someone Obviously Has Been Making A Lot Of Bad Choices…. It Is Important That As An American That You Make The Right Choice When It Comes Time For You To Vote……….

13 | Frances Scott | 0 | 10154811315419729_10154811502974729 | NYPD is doing the entire nation a great service, according to Erick Prince, the founder of Blackwater and a retired Navy Seal. He is well known in military, security and law enforcement circles and has strong contacts within the New York Police Department. They are confirming some very serious and disturbing information that is leaking out about just what was on the Weiner laptop. Prince was interviewed on Breitbart radio on Friday.  According to Prince, “They found State Department emails. They found a lot of other really damning criminal information, including money laundering, including the fact that Hillary went to this sex island with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Bill Clinton went there more than 20 times. Hillary Clinton went there at least six times.”He said, “The amount of garbage that they found in emails, of criminal activity by Hillary, by her immediate circle, even by other Democrat members of Congress, was so disgusting, they then gave it to the FBI and they said, ‘We’re going to go public with this if you don’t reopen the investigation, you don’t do the right thing with timely indictments.”Prince reveals that the NYPD wanted to hold a press conference and announce the additional arrests they were making and they received huge pushback to the point of coercion from the Justice Department. He said the Justice Department went so far as to direct them to charge an unrelated individual in the Eric Garner case of almost two years before. He says, “That’s the level of pushback the Obama Justice Department is doing against actually seeking justice in these email and other related criminal matters. He says in the unfortunate instance of Hillary Clinton being “elected” president there will be a constitutional crisis unlike anything since 1860. Prince says, “NYPD was the first one to look at that laptop. Weiner and Huma Abedin, his wife, the closest adviser of Hillary Clinton of twenty years, have both flipped. They are cooperating with the government. They see potential jail time of many years for their crimes.”NYPD kept a copy of the computer and passed a copy on to the FBI, which was what forced Comey to reopen the investigation. He says, “NYPD has all the information and they will pursue justice, within their rights, if the FBI doesn’t.  And there is all kind of criminal culpability, there’s all of the emails they’ve seen, of that 650,000, including money laundering, underage sex, pay for play, and of course, plenty of proof of inappropriate handling, sending and receiving of classified information, up to SAP level special access programs. He quotes one of the NYPD Chiefs, saying, “As a parent, as a father with daughters, he could not let that level of evil continue.”Recent stories on this topic with similar sources and conclusions can be seen at the following links.

Like in a typical mob, they are picked based on their criminality, loyalty to their boss, and readiness to violate any law and regulation – including the Constitution – to please their criminally minded leaders.People like Hillary Clinton and her immensely corrupt and dishonest cronies cannot be highly qualified experts in anything except deception, fraud, theft, and other criminal activities. The corrupt and dishonest Clinton family along with their treasonous advisers and treacherous filthy rich donors from the Wall Street and foreign corporations can only bring terror, impoverishment, and disgrace to the nation!

1 | Beth Lynn Stephens | 0 | 10154811058974729_10154812286564729 | I just don't know if I want to vote for either of them.  I may sit this election out. Check out this article The Hill did awhile back on why it is O.K. to NOT vote.  August 09, 2016, 07:14 amWhy staying home on Election Day is perfectly OK:A lot of people I talk to are disgruntled at the prospect of voting for either GOP nominee Donald Trump or Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton this November. They feel locked into a choice they don't want to have to make. But as the band Rush so wisely pronounced, "If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice," and there's always the option just to stay home on Election Day. In fact, millions of people do it each and every cycle.What?! Not vote? Why, that would be an abdication of your civic duty, wouldn't it? After all, you have no right to complain if you don't vote, right? If you're one of the many people who have bought into these popular screeds on the supreme importance of the democratic process, let me ease your mind. Voting is not your duty, and the odds are that your vote will make absolutely no difference anyway.There are two pieces to this argument, involving both the economics and the ethics of democracy. Let's start with the less controversial economics part. When you cast a vote for president, you are throwing in your one opinion with those of millions of other people. But unlike in an ordinary market, where everybody's choices have a small but nevertheless real effect on prices and production, politics works by majority rule. Whichever side gets 50 percent plus one vote will win, and the other side will lose. If you voted for the losing side, your vote did absolutely no good.However, this is also true if you voted for the winning side, unless of course a single vote meant the difference between victory and defeat, which as far as I'm aware has never happened in the history of presidential politics.So when tell you that by voting for a third party, you are "wasting your vote," what they don't tell you is that voting for a major party candidate would be just as much a waste. The odds that your vote will make a difference are basically zero, so vote for who you want to, or don't vote at all.It's also important to note that voting in an informed way is a relatively costly endeavor. In order to make an educated decision between the candidates, you have to listen to them talk, and since politicians lie, you have to decide whether you believe them. You also have to have a basic understanding of a wide variety of political and economic issues. Is Trump right or wrong on free trade? Is Clinton right or wrong on the minimum wage? Finding out the answers to these questions is not trivial, as even professional policy analysts disagree. (They are both wrong though, just to be clear).A cost-benefit analysis of voting therefore makes it seem a pretty unattractive proposition. The voter must invest time and energy learning about the issues, learning about the candidates, and actually getting to the polling place, to cast a vote that will ultimately not change the outcome of the election at all. Economists use the term "rational ignorance" to describe why it makes sense not to bother with voting; the rewards simply do not justify the costs.That's all good and well, you may be thinking, but what about patriotism? What about civic duty? Isn't it our responsibility as citizens to take part in the democratic process, even if it is inconvenient and won't change anything?To answer this, let me quote Lysander Spooner, a 19th-century attorney famous for his strident opposition to government power: "A man is none the less a slave because he is allowed to choose a new master once in a term of years." The idea what we somehow forfeit our right to complain about oppression or the mismanagement of the country because we didn't choose between two people who were both unqualified for the job is akin to me offering you a choice between maggots and lichen for dinner and admonishing you that if you say "neither," you have no right to complain about the taste.None of us was alive when the system of presidential elections was set up. None of us agreed to it. None of us opted in, and it is silly to pretend that declining to participate in this istution is in any way unpatriotic, immoral or irresponsible. The whole point of democracy is to promote choice anyway, and if that is to mean anything, it must include the freedom not to choose at all.Source: The Hill/ The HillAlbright is the director of research for Free the People, an organization that promotes personal freedom and economic liberty.By Logan Albright, contributor

Word for word from the Cornell Law Library - RE: H ClintonApparently, the FBI forgot to visit the Cornell Law Library. Word for word from the Cornell Law Library Former United States Attorney General Michael Mukasey tells MSNBC that not only is Hillary Clinton's private email server illegal, it "disqualifies" her from holding any federal office. Very specifically points to one federal law, Title 18. Section 2071.For those of us who do not have United States Code committed to memory, here's what it says:"(a) Whoever willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys, or attempts to do so, or, with intent to do so takes and carries away any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.(b) Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States. As used in this subsection, the term "office" does not include the office held by any person as a retired officer of the Armed Forces of the United States."Yes, it explicitly states "shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States."

4 | Sergey Malovatov | 1 | 10154811058974729_10154811600599729 | Do not trust the mainstream news media networks!Any person who loves his or her nation will get out and vote for Donald Trump! The media outlets managers are controlled by the corrupt and crime-riven government and multinational corporations who do not care about America or American people.Hillary Clinton has been exposed as a seasoned criminal with multiple offences and a more horrible person than any other modern politician! Regardless of FBI’s recent announcement that the Clinton email probe is over, new pieces of evidence against scandal-riven Hillary Clinton may well appear any moment and new charges against her will be brought with renewed vigor. Hillary Clinton is too tainted to be a reliable contender for any future political role or public office. Hillary’s days are over! She is a political cadaver and a too incompetent and physically and mentally exhausted person. Hillary Clinton is being protected by the donor to the Clinton Foundation. Her past crimes and multi-million donations make Hillary Clinton even more dependent on her bosses. A new batch of WikiLeaks-revealed emails might appear at any moment and Hillary Clinton will become faced with a grim prospect being indicted for her past sins.Hillary Clinton suffers a degenerative cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) that occurs when blood clots form in the brain's venous sinuses. She was diagnosed with CVST back in 2013. CVST prevents blood from draining out of her brain. It leads to deteriorating physical and mental condition, strokes, fainting, and occasional mental shutdowns. A sudden medical event on her part might easily prevent Hillary Clinton from being used by her special interest groups as their representative. That is why this aspect of Hillary Clinton’s ability to perform the duties of president has been closely guarded by her family members, her corporate handlers, and campaign managers.They certainly will not be stopped by the fact that Hillary Clinton and her team are greedy, incompetent, disloyal, untrustworthy, pathetic losers who have no idea how to run a country... The Clintons are totally corrupt and their political machinery are but gangsters, fraudsters, and corrupt politicians backed by certain corporations and financiers. Hillary Clinton is totally incompetent and wholly dependent on her domestic and foreign donors, was to be elected president. Hillary Clinton is too unqualified to be president! Everybody knows that. But the desire to put their own person in that position is too strong for certain interest groups to resist it. That is why we have been witnessing such unprecedented collusion of the political interests and power of the US government, the economic interests and power of the corporations, and the personal and administrative interests and power of the mainstream news media managers trying to create an illusion that Hillary Clinton has more popular support than she could ever dream of, based on her personal track record and abilities.That is why we cannot trust the mainstream media's lies about Hillary Clinton and her political circle. Frail, incompetent, and increasingly vulnerable, she has surrounded herself with a team of advisers and experts that are just as corrupt, unprincipled, and incompetent as Hillary Clinton herself is. Her staff is corrupt and unreliable to an appallingly high degree. Personally, she cannot make a good informed decision with this regard! As she gets increasingly fragile physically and mentally, practically all Hillary Clinton’s picks inevitably become manipulative and untrustworthy almost from the start of their hapless careers. HRC can be best compared to a ringleader with high ambitions but rapidly diminishing capabilities. Like in a typical mob, they are picked based on their criminality, loyalty to their boss, and readiness to violate any law and regulation – including the Constitution – to please their criminally minded leaders.People like Hillary Clinton and her immensely corrupt and dishonest cronies cannot be highly qualified experts in anything except deception, fraud, theft, and other criminal activities.

WikiLeaks Show Washington Post Writer Asked DNC For Anti-Trump ResearchPhoto of Peter HassonPeter HassonReporter, Associate Editor11:08 PM 11/06/2016Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank appears to have asked the Democratic National Committee (DNC) to do the majority of the research for a negative column he wrote about Donald Trump in April 2016.Milbank’s column was titled, “The Ten Plagues of Trump,” and featured a list of “outrageous things” said by Trump. One of the “plagues” listed by Milbank, for example, was “Blood” and centered around a quote from Trump about Megyn Kelly: “You could see there was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever.”Internal DNC emails suggest Milbanks asked for — and then leaned heavily on — DNC opposition research on Trump for the article.A man walks past The Washington Post on August 5, 2013 in Washington, DC after it was announced that Amazon.com founder and CEO Jeff Bezos had agreed to purchase the Post for USD 250 million.

(RELATED: Hill’s Shills: Leaks Have Exposed Journalists In Clinton’s Corner)Of the 10 “plagues” listed by Milbank, eight of them matched up with suggestions from the DNC.By press time, Milbank had not yet replied to a list of questions from The Daily Caller about his article and whether or not he used DNC research in crafting it.Read more: http://dailycaller.com/2016/11/06/wikileaks-show-washington-post-writer-asked-dnc-for-anti-trump-research/#ixzz4PKnsw8ua

1 | Annabelle Collins | 3 | 10154809114359729_10154810927084729 | Clearly some in the states have confirmation bias and listen to things Trump has been proven to have lied about. Papers around the world are asking the USA not to elect Trump as anyone with half a brain knows he using the Hitler play book to get elected. Tonight he claimed to his audience in his first sentence that there were 7000 people waiting to get inside when the Australian cameraman showed less than a 1000 were there. The man is the most barefaced liar I have ever seen in politics and that is saying something. Do Trump voters think the rest of the world is stupid or has Trump convinced them that black is white and the rest of the world is wrong. Even his bankers say he keeps going bankrupt because he has zero knowledge of the most basic things of finance and economics. If he was so successful and knew he was going to be elected he would show his tax returns. I really hope someone releases them online so we can see what is in them.

Just say: For my social future RED are the better choise.... But for most americans The Democrats are the better choise.... Both just are Muppets of their Party.Frances Scott: That is the most ignorant statement I have ever heard an adult make. Hillary Clinton is for open borders, globalism and a One World Government because it means more money in her pocket and more power for her. D. Trump is for this country and for Americans. Anyone with even a very small brain knows that when this country ends, the entire world loses. This country takes care of three-fourths of the rest of the world in some manner or other. When this country is run by a dictator, Hillary, all the money will go into Hillary's pocket just as it has when she sold our uranium to Russia and just as it does in every other country's dictator's pocket. Oh, fool, did you get any of that uranium money????????? Only an idiot with a very small brain would vote for a criminal who wants more power and money instead of a successful business man who wants to make this country great again for all races. You are a very stupid individual whether you are a citizen of this country or not you are benefitting from this country some way and when it is gone, there will be no more benefits for anyone. And Hillay will bring that end, as that is her intention.Narkeeta Scott: Life long American democrats have left the democrat party, life long American Republicans have left the republican party. Now it's a new situation. Trump is no where near perfect, but he's not playing the establishment's game. Our country needs a person like that regardless of his personality, he's the only one that will really fight the establishment. The democrats have completely sold out to the devil, and there isn't any democrat that can help this country. The republicans are not perfect of course but a better choice than the completely sold out democrats. Trump has really changed the framework of the republicans. Trump is not about politics as usual. Politics as usual will be the end of the USA!  I hope that helps you to understand American politics.

12 | Frances Scott | 1 | 10154809114359729_10154811166569729 | I DON'T THINK SO HILL............Thanks to the Right Scoop) Hilary Clinton just said that Christians must deny their Faith through the enforcement of laws, by stating that the Christian belief in being pro-life, and anti-abortion, must change, and that this should be done through laws and “political will.” If Christians must change Christian teachings in regards to abortion, then what Hilary Clinton is essentially saying is that Christians must deny their Faith. Hillary Clinton, speaking at the Women in the World Summit on April 23, made the statement: Far too many women are denied access to reproductive health care and safe childbirth, and laws don’t count for much if they’re not enforced. Rights have to exist in practice — not just on paper. Laws have to be backed up with resources and political will. And deep-seated cultural codes, religious beliefs and structural biases have to be changed.

All we need is the right major crisis and the nations will accept our New World Order."When you think of the (self proclaimed) Elite, the Ruling Oligarchy , the New World Order or those who consider themselves to occupy a caste so far above the rest of humanity, that they would refer to the rest of us as cattle, to be thought of and treated as such, there are a couple of infamous individuals (but by no means a comprehensive tally) that should appear high on the list.David Rockefeller: "We are grateful to the Washington Post, the New York Times, Time Magazine,Reuters,Bloomberg,The Hill, Politico, HuffPost, CNN,NBC,MSNBC ,ABC and many,many,many other great publications whose directors have attended our meetings and respected their promises of discretion for almost forty years. It would have been quite impossible for us to develop our plan for the world if we had been subjected to the lights of publicity during those years. But, now that the world is more sophisticated, it is prepared to march towards a world government and accept the supranational sovereignty of an intellectual and financial elite, which is surely preferable to the national autodetermination practiced in past centuries…"

The media outlets managers are controlled by the corrupt and crime-riven government and multinational corporations who do not care about America or American people.Hillary Clinton has been exposed as a seasoned criminal with multiple offences and a more horrible person than any other modern politician! Regardless of FBI’s recent announcement that the Clinton email probe is over, new pieces of evidence against scandal-riven Hillary Clinton may well appear any moment and new charges against her will be brought with renewed vigor. Hillary Clinton is too tainted to be a reliable contender for any future political role or public office. Hillary’s days are over! She is a political cadaver and a too incompetent and physically and mentally exhausted person. Hillary Clinton is being protected by the donor to the Clinton Foundation. Her past crimes and multi-million donations make Hillary Clinton even more dependent on her bosses. A new batch of WikiLeaks-revealed emails might appear at any moment and Hillary Clinton will become faced with a grim prospect being indicted for her past sins.Hillary Clinton suffers a degenerative cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) that occurs when blood clots form in the brain's venous sinuses. She was diagnosed with CVST back in 2013. CVST prevents blood from draining out of her brain. It leads to deteriorating physical and mental condition, strokes, fainting, and occasional mental shutdowns. A sudden medical event on her part might easily prevent Hillary Clinton from being used by her special interest groups as their representative. That is why this aspect of Hillary Clinton’s ability to perform the duties of president has been closely guarded by her family members, her corporate handlers, and campaign managers.They certainly will not be stopped by the fact that Hillary Clinton and her team are greedy, incompetent, disloyal, untrustworthy, pathetic losers who have no idea how to run a country... The Clintons are totally corrupt and their political machinery are but gangsters, fraudsters, and corrupt politicians backed by certain corporations and financiers. Hillary Clinton is totally incompetent and wholly dependent on her domestic and foreign donors, was to be elected president. Hillary Clinton is too unqualified to be president! Everybody knows that. But the desire to put their own person in that position is too strong for certain interest groups to resist it. That is why we have been witnessing such unprecedented collusion of the political interests and power of the US government, the economic interests and power of the corporations, and the personal and administrative interests and power of the mainstream news media managers trying to create an illusion that Hillary Clinton has more popular support than she could ever dream of, based on her personal track record and abilities.That is why we cannot trust the mainstream media's lies about Hillary Clinton and her political circle. Frail, incompetent, and increasingly vulnerable, she has surrounded herself with a team of advisers and experts that are just as corrupt, unprincipled, and incompetent as Hillary Clinton herself is. Her staff is corrupt and unreliable to an appallingly high degree. Personally, she cannot make a good informed decision with this regard! As she gets increasingly fragile physically and mentally, practically all Hillary Clinton’s picks inevitably become manipulative and untrustworthy almost from the start of their hapless careers. HRC can be best compared to a ringleader with high ambitions but rapidly diminishing capabilities. Like in a typical mob, they are picked based on their criminality, loyalty to their boss, and readiness to violate any law and regulation – including the Constitution – to please their criminally minded leaders.People like Hillary Clinton and her immensely corrupt and dishonest cronies cannot be highly qualified experts in anything except deception, fraud, theft, and other criminal activities. The corrupt and dishonest Clinton family along with their treasonous advisers and treacherous filthy rich donors from the Wall Street and foreign corporations can only bring terror, impoverishment, and disgrace to the nation!

It is hard to tell how he can come on TV at CNN every night disgracing D. J. Trump when he himself committed such a disposable act! What was he showing the States teens for an example as their peer, Donald is stepping in as a Steward to the young of America. Not as this example as we see in this article:Evidence reason Bakari Sellers' DUI charge droppedLaDonna BeekerApr 8, 2013 05:16 PMCHESTER COUNTY, SC (WIS) - Evidence in a state representative's driving under the influence case allowed him to plea to a lesser charge.    State Rep. Bakari Sellers was charged with DUI on Oct. 7 when he was traveling north on Interstate 77 just after 1 a.m. from a South Carolina football game, where he admitted to deputies he was drinking alcohol. Sellers refused a breath test, resulting in an automatic six-month driver's license suspension. His license was reinstated in February by a judicial panel.However, Sellers will not see any more consequences from the DUI charge because video surveillance from the deputy's patrol car did not match the date on Sellers' ticket. Because the evidence did not flow, it could not hold up in court.Sellers was allowed to plead guilty to reckless driving and pay a $475 fine. Court documents show he signed an affidavit April 1 acknowledging his guilt to the lesser charge."I am very pleased to have been cleared of all alcohol-related charges from my traffic stop in Chester County last fall," Sellers said in a statement released Friday.He takes "full responsibility" for his actions and admitted he was too tired to drive."I apologize and will do my best to set a better example for our youth and to continue to move South Carolina forward," Sellers said." I don't think he should explain properness when he is so drunk with words against a person that stands for America! As unbelievably, there is shocking videos on the net of his DUI arrest! TRUMP 2016

Over the course of his entire presidential campaign, Donald Trump has been in a war with the media, often accusing news outlets of fabricating negatives stories about him to hurt his White House bid. While Trump's battle with the media is at an all-time high, there's one story that most mainstream media outlets have avoided reporting.Trump lawsuitIn the summer of 1994, a woman known only as "Jane Doe" was allegedly raped and threatened by Trump and convicted pedophile Jeffery Epstein. The woman previously filed a lawsuit in California, but the judge dismissed the case. Attempting to have her voice heard once again, "Jane Doe" made her case once again and it was strong enough to move forward in a New York court. Federal Judge Ronnie Abrams has since ordered a status conference to be held on December 16, with the legal representatives of both sides being present in the courtroom. As pointed out by the Bipartisan Report on October 23, new details have been revealed, painting a grim and dark picture about what allegedly went down over 20 years ago.The victim, known as "Jane Doe," filed the lawsuit under her assumed real name of Katie Johnson. Details in the lawsuit claim that she was the subject of, but not limited to, "acts of rape, sexual misconduct, criminal sexual acts," as well as "false imprisonment" and "threats of death." The incident apparently took place on more than one occasion, with the most emotionally scaring encounter occurring during the fourth and final time."Trump tied Plaintiff to a bed, exposed himself to Plaintiff, and then proceeded to forcibly rape Plaintiff," the lawsuit continues, describing the alleged rape as a "savage sexual attack." The plaintiff, "Jane Done" or Katie Johnson, claims she "loudly pleaded" for the former host of "The Apprentice" to stop, before he "violently" struck her face with his hand and informed the victim that he would "do whatever he wanted."In yet another bizarre twist to the alleged encounter, Epstein reportedly got into a heated exchange with Trump for taking the victim's virginity because he wanted to be the one to do so. In conclusion, both the Republican nominee and Epstein allegedly told the plaintiff that they would kill her and her family if she ever spoke about what happened.  A witness has come forward to confirm her story.Hiring Women Based on AppearancesGroping a Woman at a Manhattan NightclubGroping and Kissing a Former Apprentice ContestantKissing a Mar-a-Lago Guest at a Mother’s Day BrunchGroping a Woman Outside the 1998 U.S. Open Tennis ChampionshipSalma Hayak comes forward:  Trump planted a negative article about her after she refused to date himAn 11th person has come forward with allegations.
