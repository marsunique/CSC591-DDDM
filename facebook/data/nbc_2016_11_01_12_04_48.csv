2 | Michael Fusions | 3 | 1553813197972038_1553819501304741 | So sad. As a person who loves the Philippines and was in the process of trying to learn the tagalog language, its very disappointing to see the anti-americanism and destruction of a once welcoming country going down the drain after just a few short months.
3 | Claude Berry | 0 | 1553813197972038_1553827154637309 | Don't be fooled, Obama is trying to advance the Islamic State in the Philippines by protecting their illegal drug funding, and Duterte is fighting back against Obama's Christian genocide.

And then after they will create some lies and end up overthrowing the president of Philippines like it has done to the Middle East. You sell weapons to Saudi Arabia who have killed innocent yemen civilians and children but you are stopping to sell guns to Manila who are trying to fight drug dealers?

What is Día de Muertos? It's not "Mexican Halloween," for one. 
Here's what the celebration is all about: http://nbcnews.to/2f59Uju
via NBC Latino
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Erick Córtez | 6 | 1169528883131806_1169555506462477 | Día de los Muertos, is a day of remembrance of those who have left us. Bud I remember my grandfather telling us that is a day when the spirits of the dead are allowed to come and visit us.
2 | R Parker Allen Bentley | 1 | 1169528883131806_1169558303128864 | I think it is important to note that other countries, former Spanish colonies, also observe Dia de los Muertos, like the Philippines. It is not purely a Mexican holiday.
3 | Denise Sawtelle | 0 | 1169528883131806_1169564616461566 | HAPPY HALLOWEEN - HAPPY SAMHAINSamhain is celebrated as the Dia de los Muertos in Mexico (Day of the Dead--usually held on November 1) and All Saints Day (also on November 1) by the Catholic church.The Origins of Halloween (According to SUNY Albany)Introduction      Halloween or All Hallows Eve, as it is sometimes referred to, is a lot different now than it may have been celebrated many centuries ago. With October 31st coming around the corner, I thought it would be interesting to find out what the origins of Halloween were.Earliest Trace      Peter Tokofsky, an assistant professor in the department of folklore and mythology in UCLA states, "The earliest trace (of Halloween) is the Celtic festival, Samhain, which was the Celtic New Year. It was the day of the dead, and they believed the souls of the deceased would be available" (Navarro).Samhain      Samhain (pronounced sah-win or sow-in) means "summer's end" by the Celts. In old Germanic and Celtic societies, what we call equinoxes and solstices marked the middles of the season, not the beginnings." (Chamberlain) Therefore if there exist an autumnal equinox, winter solstice, spring equinox and a summer solstice, there are also the beginning of autumn, winter, spring and summer. All of these eight dates were important. Summer's end which meant the beginning of winter was an important time for people who survived on plants grown in the field and animals that were kept in pastures. (Chamberlain) "This day marked the end of summer and the harvest and the beginning of the dark, cold winter, a time of year that was often associated with human death" (The History Channel Exhibits- History of Halloween) It is most likely this reason that the Druids (Celtic pagans) believed that the spirits of those who died the preceding year roamed the earth the night of Samhain (MSN Learning & Research- Halloween)Descriptions      The Druids celebrated this holiday "with a great fire festival to encourage the dimming Sun not to vanish" and people "danced round bonfires to keep evil sprits away, but left their doors open in hopes that the kind spirits of loved ones might join them around their hearths". On this night, "divination was thought to be more effective than any other time, so methods were derived to ascertain who might marry, what great person might be born, who might rise to prominence, or who might die" (Chamberlain). Also during the celebration, the Celts "wore costumes, typically consisting of animal heads and skins, and attempted to tell each other's fortunes". Crops were burned and animals were sacrificed (The History Channel Exhibits- The History of Halloween). The spirits were believed to be either "entertained by the living", or to "find a body to possess for the incoming year". This all gives reasons as to why "dressing up like witches, ghosts and goblins, villagers could avoid being possessed." (Navarro )Roman Influence      By 43 AD, "Romans had conquered the majority of Celtic territory." For the 400 years they occupied Celtic lands, two Roman festivals: Feralia (the commemoration of the passing of the dead) and a day to honor Pomona (the Roman goddess of fruits and trees). The apple served as a symbol for Pomona and which might have been incorporated into Samhain by the practice of "bobbing for apples" (The History of Halloween).Christian Influence      When "local people converted to Christianity during the early Middle Ages, the Roman Catholic Church often incorporated modified versions of older religious traditions in order to win converts." Pope Gregory IV wanted to substitute Samhain with All Saints' Day in 835, but All Souls' Day (Nov. 2nd) which is closer in resemblance to Samhain and Halloween today, was "first instituted at a French monastery in 998 and quickly spread throughout Europe" (MSN Learning & Research- Halloween). In the 16th century, "Christian village children celebrated the vigil of All Saints' by doing the Danse Macabre. The Seven Brethren whose grizzly death is described in the seventh chapter of the deuterocanonical book of Second Macabees" is also said to have resulted in children dressing up in grizzly costumes to signify these deaths. (Thomas )Modern Halloween      Halloween came to the United States when European immigrants "brought their varied Halloween customs with them". In the second half of the nineteenth century, America was flooded with new immigrants including the Irish fleeing from the potato famine in Ireland in 1846. By combining Irish and English traditions, Americans began the "trick-or-treat" tradition. In the later 1800's the holiday became more centered on community and in the 1920's and 1930's, Halloween became "a secular, but community-centered holiday". In the 1950's leaders changed Halloween as a holiday aimed at the young to limit vandalism. This all led to what Halloween actually is like today.

They also gave $25 million to the Clinton Foundation.1. The fact that she regularly donates to her own charity for tax deductions is bad enough, but the Clinton Foundation itself actually puts less than five percent of its overall donations into play for the charities it supposedly benefits.2. We have also seen the numerous pay-to-play schemes running through the foundation that further disqualify Hillary Clinton and prove she may be the most corrupt politician not to just seek the office of the president but to hold ANY office.3. Leaked documents have proven over half of her private meetings while serving as secretary of state were with big money donors to the Clinton Foundation. What is most damning, though, is that many of these people simply had no right getting that kind of access.I am not sure what it will take for the American people to realize Hillary Clinton is a true criminal mastermind, but YOU better wake up soon or our country is doomed.

7 | Adrian Ramirez | 2 | 1169528883131806_1169547676463260 | It's honoring family and friends who passed away and also to celebrate being alive, because we are all born with an Expiration Date.

14 | True Poizon | 0 | 1169528883131806_1169540306463997 | Hey Voters, a few things to remember when voting:----There is no such thing as a wasted vote. Refusing to vote 3rd party because you think they have no chance, isnt cool. Even if you write in a candidate, thats not a wasted vote. Your vote is your vote.----Secondly, voting for Trump simply because you dont like Clinton....or Clinton simply because you dont like Trump, isnt cool either. It's very irresponsible. Only vote for someone if you truly like them. We arent voting on Class President here lol, we are voting for the leaders of our Nation here.----Third, I'll keep repeating it: You would be fired from your job (or in jail) if you did what either of these two front runners did. Do you really want to vote for special treatment of the elite, and unfairness?----Four: Lets say Clinton does win (which I predict unfortunately), what does it matter if Congress is Republican? And vice versa.  ----Finally, every 4-8 years we elect someone thinking they'll magically change the USA, and change never happens. Real change doesnt really happen in cubicles or voting booths anymore, it happens in the streets and households. Spread the word.

The public got its first glimpse of China's newest cutting-edge fighter jet, with two Chengdu J-20 warplanes roaring through the skies of an airshow.

2 | Dafnee Gabriela Dell'Acqua | 8 | 1553766941309997_1553784801308211 | I have a question....being that this is classified information or delicate information, why wouldn't the US have the best anti hacking system to avoid anyone stealing their info. Perhaps is a dump question but it just doesn't make sense to me.
3 | Ricardo Montiel | 12 | 1553766941309997_1553776904642334 | We all know who they have to thank for that... We all know when it comes to China words like "innovation, creativity, originality" are not associated with China.
4 | Mingyuan Yang | 2 | 1553766941309997_1553804227972935 | Well they all have wings and tails that's familiar...other than that, there is no single fifth generation fighter jet in the world used canard design except this one.
5 | Dallas C DAlfonso | 5 | 1553766941309997_1553785654641459 | Just means that flaws should also be familiar as well. Every thing has a weakness...the DeathStar had an exhaust port not much bigger than 2 meters, and Spaceball One had an Abort button that was out of order..
6 | Alan Atkinson | 0 | 1553766941309997_1553797194640305 | See what is its power plant. Is the jet engines good that's info I would like to know. They can take off and do a show. But Can it do the walk! Thinking aircraft is superior. Will be tested.
7 | Dan DeCost | 0 | 1553766941309997_1553830507970307 | Chinese espionage! There's a reason their tech developers are trying to assert themselves into every industry possible. Even if they have to give the tech away below cost (which for them is next to nothing) they still benefit. All their stuff has back-doors built into the code. There's a reason why I always tell my sales people I refuse to design any IT systems using Chinese equipment. There's a reason the DoD put a ban on Chinese IT equipment and encouraged US Based companies to do the same.
8 | Hector Perez | 0 | 1553766941309997_1553807957972562 | Talk about smoke and mirrors. We spend billions of dollars to create a plane that's superior to anything out there. Over night the Russians or Chinese duplicate it for pennies on the dollar. It's election time and the big issue is Hillarys emails. Come on people the problem is lifers running our government. They don't care about you or me. All they care about is the lining in their pockets. Let's get these lifers out and initiate term limits.
9 | Jeremy Nordstrom | 1 | 1553766941309997_1553801747973183 | Pull apart the paneling and you'll find the internals from a '98 Nokia "stealthily" hidden under a lattice work of iPhone cases. Not very scary stuff.
10 | Bejorn Valentine | 1 | 1553766941309997_1553786811308010 | Raymond Osgood thats why i dont trust wikileaks. They have no loyalty to anyone...they could easily be giving hacked info to our rivals as well as the countries doing it themselves
11 | Kalman Gancsos | 1 | 1553766941309997_1553802101306481 | When was the last time the Chinese came up with anything original. Much easier to steal. They pirate anything they can get their hands on and their government could care less. I'd be ashamed of such a culture
12 | André M. Gautier | 0 | 1553766941309997_1553795564640468 | well... if the US has done all the aerodynamic tests, why not copy the form ? but the important is not the outside look, but what it has in the belly....

14 | Robert Rodel | 2 | 1553766941309997_1553789817974376 | The development of these jets were published almost two years ago. The problem that China had was an engine could perform, so they turned too Russia.
15 | Brandon Balzer | 0 | 1553766941309997_1553812707972087 | We all know China stole the the F35 design. What they didn't get is a majority of electronics and engine design. So it's pretty much just the shell. Plus the radar signature is larger than our F35s simply because they couldn't duplicate Metal alloys that absorb and deflect radar.
16 | Kurt Pittman | 3 | 1553766941309997_1553784021308289 | Except that it isn't actually stealthy. They copied some of the visual design queues, but made serious mistakes when it comes to stealth. The forward canards for example increase the radar profile
17 | Joe Bourguignon | 0 | 1553766941309997_1553830267970331 | Obviously, in a dog-fight, their attempt to blend in to the opponents aircraft features will give them advantage to not be shot-down.

1 | Scott Murrell | 15 | 1553739974646027_1553744381312253 | --I wish people could forget the media and look for other ways to find information about our candidates. I know people who like Hillary but say they can't trust her so when I ask them why they can't trust her they almost always mention something they'd heard or read that more times than not isn't true. These are fans!We have videos of Trump in his own words saying things that under any sane time would be enough to send him to either Gitmo or a prison here in this country and people are willingly overlooking what they absolutely know is true about him. They have to be smart enough to understand how having him as president would hurt our country and their own children and they just don't seem to care...
2 | David Ames | 10 | 1553739974646027_1553740697979288 | You know, Trump supporters really piss me off! I understand all the hate for the Clintons and Hillary, I don't like her myself! she's just awful! a disingenuous career political opportunist that gets away with things that no common person would ever get away with and can't be trusted as far as she can be thrown. But the thing about Trump supporters is that there were very few of them before he made his comments about Mexican immigrants being drug dealers and rapists with no distinction between hard core criminals and people desperate to feed their families and even after categorizing Mexicans as rapists and even implying that most are like that by adding to his already incredibly insulting presumption that "and I suppose 'some of them' are good people" That's when he became popular on a large scale. He later said that he would build a wall and make Mexico pay for it, and that is when his popularity skyrocketed. Since then he has called for a ban on all Muslims entering our nation and incited hate for Muslims to all of his already angry and resentful fans, actually telling them and again generalizing them as one and the same, that "these people hate us and they want to kill us." This is what his cult of hate mongering worshipers are in love with! They waited a very long time for someone of prominence who they "think" is smart and a politician to say what they think and tell it the way they think it is, but these people who have grown more and more enamored and obsessed with him have ignored every negative thing about him and try and rationalize his actions and jump to his defense no matter what he does. If his incredible insensitivity towards people of other races and cultures didn't have any effect on them at all, then there's the other obvious things about him that tell any intelligent person that he is a clueless idiot who does not know what he's talking about on more than half the issues and even his seemingly good ideas are mostly infeasible pipe dreams and empty rhetoric, the man has displayed over and over and over again how he is not fit to be the leader of this great nation. He is so incredibly immature with the very worse temperament I have ever witnessed by anyone in the public eye. He has always had an incredibly big ego and quite literally has a god complex, only talking about how great he is, and his followers actually believe that he cares about anyone but himself! This is a man who once casually said on an episode of his reality show that "most people are losers." He attacks anyone who ever criticizes him in the slightest way and goes on Twitter in the wee hours of the morning to post a bunch of silly vitriol about anyone he considers an enemy or adversary and acts psychotic about the most trivial things. He is a textbook narcissist, chauvinistic misogamist who lashes out at women, rates their worth by their looks and has not only made incredibly inappropriate remarks about women like Rosie O'Donal, Megan Kelly, Carly Fiorina and Hillary Clinton, but has also been caught implying sexual assault as a hobby and has been accused by many women of sexual misconduct to rape; thats right rape! by who? by his ex wife Ivana more than twenty years ago. I can go on and on about what we all see from him every day but his supporters just don't care and that's what really makes me sick about them.

It's pretty clear that now that Obama and Lynch are backing Comey, the evidence will be enough to convict Hillary. Obama will have to distance himself to save his legacy.
4 | Eddy Bushara | 3 | 1553739974646027_1553756281311063 | This election is going to be in the US history for ever and probably would be a subject of political studies, it's a big stain on the US democracy and shows how much dirt politics carry, all over the place. Sad!!!!
5 | Mike Redmond | 2 | 1553739974646027_1553769394643085 | Personally I believe many males supporting Trump simply do not want a woman for president. They are hiding behind her email scandal, trust issues etc. They are scared to speak up and say only a man should be president because they are smart enough to know the women in their lives would make their lives hell. Trump has 0 to offer the country 0!
6 | Erick Córtez | 0 | 1553739974646027_1553811997972158 | I have a conspiracy theory to latch onto those of Donald Trump's that he has been talking about: Like Donald Trump I do believe this election is rigged but in a different way. I believe the master minds behind are this rigged election are Hilary Clinton and Donald Trump. And they are fooling everyone into believing they are at each other throats. Just think how they been talking about how Donald hasn't been paying any taxes and take advantage of the loophole the same loophole that Hilary hasn't even tried to close. So if Clinton wins Donald Trump won't lose cause she'll keep forgetting on closing those loopholes and Donald Trump will keep on used them to his benefit. Don't be surprise if at the end of this election the Clinton's and the Trump's become best friends again.

At least that is how it should be.  Though the lack of good content is why I got rid of DISH.  I loved them and rarely had trouble but m argument was with content versus cost.  They stopped showing History channel 2 for some other content that after checking out decided it was worthless.  So I decided to check out how many channels I watched vs what I paid for.  I watched about 30 channels out of the 200.  So having good content would help them so I would think they would be happy to have his if it is good.

2 | Jason Hare | 1110 | 1553681571318534_1553688424651182 | For a place that calls itself "the land of the free and the home of the brave" we sure do have a lot of cowards and fear mongers lurking around
3 | Chad Surdi | 927 | 1553681571318534_1553687681317923 | Trump's future America people! Only YOU can stop this on Nov. 8th.
4 | Tammy Boutwell | 309 | 1553681571318534_1553694964650528 | This isa hate crime. Plain and simple. This is why Trump should not hold any office because he spews hate all across the country. Somebody should build a wall around him. All the hate people are showing since his running started are we really like this in our country , is this what we are teaching our children that it's ok to pick on etc somebody different. Not me and not my USA.
5 | Rocio Cuellar | 218 | 1553681571318534_1553694511317240 | Some of the comments I'm reading are incredibly insensitive and it makes me sad that our country has lost sight of things. This man is dead....he was murdered in the most cowardly way.....my condolences to his family and I hope they find the punks responsible.
6 | Georgia Federhofer | 309 | 1553681571318534_1553683334651691 | The Trump effect. How terrible. Poor guy. R.I.P.
7 | RJ Dietrich | 57 | 1553681571318534_1553694704650554 | Why is everyone so quick to blame trump supporters for this? Why are people being called racist because this guy was killed? I dont see any description of the suspect. For all we know it could have been someone of the same nationality of this guy. Everyone has to stop being so quick to judge each other.
8 | Frank Vasquez | 52 | 1553681571318534_1553696541317037 | I think after all this is over, we should sue the TRUMP estate for social damage and defamation of the American Public. He should pick up the tab on all this rhetoric he has started. Hit Orange face in the pockets and watch that smirk on his face change real quick.
9 | Barry Broussard | 88 | 1553681571318534_1553686971317994 | Muslim immigrants are killing and raping young girls attacking Americans and this is what they want to cover wake up America while we still can call it America ... The Clintons breed hate and corruption
10 | Charles Halpin | 15 | 1553681571318534_1027300907378231 | This occurred just after bar close in downtown Menomonie. I go to school here and we're only two months into the semester....really hope they find the guy who did this and I hope it's not a fellow student.😪
11 | Judi Drayton | 19 | 1553681571318534_1553695681317123 | If this is found to be a hate crime against this young man I hope they throw the book at whoever did this...People need to stop grouping other people because of a few who do bad things. Just because he may be Muslim does not make him a bad person. Just because he is from Saudi does not make him a bad person...He was a human being who deserved to live his life and not be beaten to death while doing nothing to bring this on as far as we know. RIP young man.
12 | Sheli Jo M | 2 | 1553681571318534_401538809970395 | I'm horrified by this. I'm also afraid of the outcome of this for our community. There has been comments that have nothing to substainiate anything yet. People are assuming things. It makes me mad and shows the inconsideration for this young man and his family. We need to stop assuming and just pray for peace. PRAY AND STAND FOR PEACE MENOMONIE. Don't let the stories of unknowns circulate. We don't know the whole story, and maybe never will. We do not know that alcohol was involved since we haven't caught the perp. We do not know if this was a racial issue since we haven't caught the perp. We do not know if the perp was another Stout student. We need to STOP assuming what happened and wait for the ifnormation to present. All we know at this point is that a human has passed away due to a violent death and this is absolutely horrible. Prayers are being sent for this family and friends.
13 | Murchison Loranzo Gilmore III | 7 | 1553681571318534_1553725737980784 | The dude could have been sleeping with another dude's wife/girlfriend or husband/boyfriend, was confronted, an altercation occurred that he was on the losing end of. He could have been mugged. He could have started a fight that he wasn't able to win. There could be a dozen of possibilities as to what happened, but the "tolerant" Liberals/Progressives who always claim to rely on evidence and facts are the ones assuming that it is a hate crime committed by a Trump supporter(s).

15 | Randall Horvath | 8 | 1553681571318534_1553722674647757 | NBC, why is this national news? People get murdered every single day so what makes this significant enough to place on national news? I mean black and white people get viciously murdered daily across America and of course you don't place their picture on national news? So why this one?
16 | John Lovecraft | 34 | 1553681571318534_1553688247984533 | Way to go Trumpanzees! You are vile scum!!! I hope someone does the same thing to you or someone you care about.
17 | Angie NuMee | 7 | 1553681571318534_401535036637439 | I pray for his family...in 2016 that this is still happening shows how BC far we have to go..... they haven't said it but there is a possibility this was a hate crime.... so sad.......if this is a hate crime they find those responsible
18 | Barbara Cavitt | 11 | 1553681571318534_1553709677982390 | So sad-this is the people that supports Trump-without a doubt-that man cannot make America great with all the hatred he projects-so sad this poor guy died like this-people of intolerance should truly be ashamed of themselves-but they lack the sense to even get a clue to their ugliness-prayers for this man's family-so very sad.
19 | Mike Pareli | 83 | 1553681571318534_1553682937985064 | Let me guess by some bully Donald Trump supporters
20 | Shelby T Albert | 7 | 1553681571318534_1553723951314296 | So many racist people blaming this on a white person just automatically blaming white! In my city 3 shot dead no suspects yet and they were Hispanics so since all you racist against white people that automatically believe we are evil we hate everyone so if a minority is killed do you think whites should only be suspect it was a white person? I love the absolute hypocrisy with all you people calling white people the racist when its obvious who the nasty ignorant racist are its all of you assuming a white person did this horrible thing!
21 | Maria Mendoza | 4 | 1553681571318534_401549419969334 | Wisconsin is where the students displayed Obama with a noose around his neck. The school said it was not a hate crime, it was freedom of speech. Now this young man is dead. This the tip of the hatred iceberg Trump has unleashed. If he wins, it will only get worse.
22 | Joanne Hoppenworth Smith | 2 | 1553681571318534_1027301484044840 | Send us your children to be educated so we can kill them one at a time. If these street thugs are so anxious to fight there should be a special unit for them and then to be dropped in the middle of the war zones. Bet we would see some real heroes.
23 | Angelique Velasco | 3 | 1553681571318534_401546516636291 | How terrible we treat people, he was here studying, to do something with his life and instead ignorance sent someone to hurt him. I feel for his family. Please find and prosecute the person responsible😠
24 | Christopher Shirer | 3 | 1553681571318534_1553716374648387 | Right. For all we know it could have been a robbery gone wrong or an altercation that got out of control. If there's no clear motive, then there's no need to stir the pot and play on people's emotions. The media is fully aware of how this was going to be interpreted. I'll wait for the facts to come out. Either way, it's sad that somebody had to lose their life.
25 | Bill Babnick | 2 | 1553681571318534_1553711934648831 | Meanwhile..... Christians worldwide witnessed "unprecedented" levels of persecution in 2016 with more than 12,000 Christians killed for their faith, up from nearly 3,000 the year before, Open Doors USA disclosed on Wednesday as it released its annual World Watch List.In a press statement, the watchdog organisation said approximately 3,400 churches were attacked or damaged."The levels of exclusion, discrimination and violence against Christians is unprecedented, spreading and intensifying," David Curry, president and CEO of Open Doors USA, said. "Christians, longing to stay in their home countries, are being forced to flee for their lives and for their children's lives."For the 14th consecutive year, North Korea ranked as the most dangerous place to live as a Christian."Christianity is not only seen as 'opium for the people' as is normal for all communist states; it is also seen as deeply Western and despicable," Open Doors USA said. "Christians try to hide their faith as far as possible to avoid arrest and being sent to a labour camp. Thus, being Christian has to be a well-protected secret, even within families, and most parents refrain from introducing their children to the Christian faith in order to make sure that nothing slips their tongue when they are asked."Open Doors USA estimates that between 50,000 to 70,000 Christians are imprisoned in labour camps in North Korea.The second most dangerous place for Christians is Iraq, where Islamic violence continued to victimise the people, forcing Christians and other minority groups to flee their homes by the thousands to escape the brutal rule of the Islamic State (ISIS) jihadist and terrorist organisation.The rest of the top 10 countries where Christians are persecuted the most, according to Charisma News and Religious News Service, are: (3) Eritrea; (4) Afghanistan; (5) Syria; (6) Pakistan; (7) Somalia; (8) Sudan; (9) Iran; and (10) Libya, which appeared on the list for the first time.Aside from ISIS, two other radical Islamic groups continued to victimise Christians in 2016. These are the Boko Haram and al-Shabaab organisations based in Africa. These two terrorist groups are active in Somalia, Sudan, Libya and Nigeria, which ranked 12th in the list."Less well known are the tens of thousands of Christians leaving the 12 sharia states of northern Nigeria, where 27 million Christians remain second-class citizens, and now many thousands are fleeing the anti-Christian violence of Hausa-Fulani herdsmen in the country's mid-section," Open Doors USA said."Official estimates seem to be the tip of the iceberg," it continued. "In Kenya, many Christians are fleeing from the Muslim-majority areas. Tens of thousands continue to brave desert and trafficking gangs to leave Eritrea, many ending up in Europe..."So.... would you like to do a numbers comparison NBC? Not that I condone this brutal act by any means, but I wonder why the mainstream media and our asinine uninformed society isn't crying out against this brutality that continues around the world daily...?

BREAKING: Three dead in mangled wreck of school bus, city bus crash
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Chriztina Kennedy | 42 | 1553612951325396_1553624557990902 | There is nothing worse than putting your child on a school bus hoping they get to school safely and learning that their bus might have crashed. I hope the children are OK. 😐😢
2 | Carlos Mariscal | 1 | 1553612951325396_1553782084641816 | A lot of bus crashes/ deaths happening. Might want to start setting up some type of rules and regulations for these drivers, just like it's done for class A drivers. But since they're only carrying human beings, no big deal.
3 | Jo Anne Harris | 7 | 1553612951325396_1553675994652425 | Praying for all. Especially worried about high school students / middle school students that may have been on the MTA bus.  Lord have mercy.

5 | Richard Rancourt | 0 | 1553612951325396_1553683531318338 | No seat belts on school buses but you need expensive, non recyclable seats and seat belts in your car

Cosby is trying to make race an issue in his criminal sexual abuse case.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Olympia Pena Alanis | 88 | 1553573411329350_1553582424661782 | Cosby is a pariah but Donald Rump is a God to these Morons! Trump is sexual predator and child rapist but he'll be a wonderful president..give me fk'n break!
2 | Allen Davis | 29 | 1553573411329350_1553574914662533 | Uh oh. How will the habitually offended respond to this?They are torn between using skin color as a crutch or using gender as a crutch.Decisions, decisions. If you blast Cosby for this, that makes you "racist", and if you don't, that makes you "sexist".You are in quite the pickle. Let the show begin.
3 | Nicole Romero | 17 | 1553573411329350_1553587544661270 | I thought he was too blind to stand trial? Can he see color? Next it's going to be his religion, sex, and sexual orientation; cover all those protected classes. Disgusting.
4 | Stephen Finnegan | 8 | 1553573411329350_1553601504659874 | I don't blame Cosby for being pissed off. Look what Bill Clinton has gotten away with raping multiple women. I guess that is white privilege for you.
5 | Ashraf U Khan | 11 | 1553573411329350_1553588284661196 | What has happened to Dtrumpf after a dozen accusations! If this is not discrimination, and on racial basis, then what it is ?!
6 | Sirach Elmtree | 5 | 1553573411329350_1553621447991213 | Oh so now he's black?!! Gtfo here Cosby! Before all this,you used your career to step on the downtrodden of the black community. Your little speeches about black people have empowered the bigots to make racist memes against your own people.
7 | Richard S Copeland | 7 | 1553573411329350_1553683937984964 | Race is an issue, exibit A "Donald Trump"! There is no tape of Cosby admitting he does or do anything close to what those women charge and he's in court. I had to cover my sons ear when listening to the Trump tape and he's allowed to run for President. If that aint racist I don't know what is.
8 | Cassi M Nance | 1 | 1553573411329350_1553659237987434 | Um dah, That is a race issue what they have done to that old man, that is the sickest thing you can ever do to a elderly person who has had a stellar career for years and have done nothing but contribute so much positive things to many, many people lives over the years. This is the most disgraceful, outlandish, most embarrassing thing you people could ever do to a good upstanding law abiding citizens was to disgrace his name in mud, and you think race didn't have nothing to do with this shameful display to our country.
9 | Cassi M Nance | 1 | 1553573411329350_1553669114653113 | You people embarrass and humiliate this country's name and you wonder why foreign people don't like and respect you anymore, the whole existence of this country has been slandered shamefully and the foreigners don't support or stand by this kind of shame that's why the luxury part of this country is being stripped to pieces, everything that had this country stable is ruined due to do much existing shame and humiliation being done here.
10 | Frederick Wm Bocchetti | 4 | 1553573411329350_1553579251328766 | This reminds me of when Cosby's Dog was in The Madison Square Garden Westminster Competition & there were no other dogs of that breed entered (un-heard of) & they let him win any way even though no other breeder or trainer or handler would be involved with him as though they all Knew The Truth of Him back then.
11 | Dwayne Leggett | 0 | 1553573411329350_1553671187986239 | Somebody made sure Bill Cosby wouldn't be any help in the challenges the black lives matters protesters face. He was a pillow of the black community until this 50 year old case came back.
12 | Polly Pomeranz | 5 | 1553573411329350_1553584777994880 | Is he just trying to look bad, he needs a shave and a good skin doctor, but maybe this is part of  his schstick. But give it up he will pay in the end one way or another
13 | Tochukwu Augustine Adimonye | 1 | 1553573411329350_1553626064657418 | American Ladies should please for once, develop a loving heart.Why are they being so wicked without Evidence. ?Why not allow an old man to age in peace?.We all have erred, no one is a saint.
14 | Blakeney Adams | 0 | 1553573411329350_1553590187994339 | Sorry old fellow. You're going to get devoured like a badly prepared Thanksgiving dinner and then power blasted out the next day after a cup of rich coffee. You're done. 😂😂😂.
15 | Rico Bobby | 0 | 1553573411329350_1553804934639531 | Cant rape the willing, to call him a serial rapist is sad.. hes still just a black man, if that were true he would have BEEN THROWN UNDER THE JAIL.
16 | Susan L Whitesall | 1 | 1553573411329350_1553639741322717 | Put this old perv to rest, just another "star" ugh, who thought he was entitled but just in case, used drugs to ensure he got what he lust after.
17 | Joe Sullivan | 9 | 1553573411329350_1553581084661916 | I wonder if Trump can pull the same argument in December in his child rape case...Or against the many women who have spoken out about him.
18 | Tim Laprade | 1 | 1553573411329350_1553582534661771 | Why not, the Liberals democrats enjoy crying racism every time they don't get what they want. even though Clinton is funded and endorsed by the KKK
19 | Patricia Blanchard | 0 | 1553573411329350_1553827317970626 | It is racially motivated because donny boy bragged about abusing women and women have said he did but he hasn't been arrested and why is that if not skin color
20 | Digna Regina Peguero Diaz | 1 | 1553573411329350_1553630904656934 | When will people understand that a crime has no color? But if things were done fairly,everyone who committed one and it's proven it has,should go to trial without playing any type of cards.
21 | Harris Smith | 6 | 1553573411329350_1553575081329183 | And yet NBC you play the race baiters in everything else....your hypocrisy is stifling...

24 | David Lee | 4 | 1553573411329350_1553583164661708 | He did not need to drug these women. He is rich and famous.  Women will have sex with him without the drugs.
25 | Irisi Marie Vauldt | 2 | 1553573411329350_1553584614661563 | No. Race has nothing to do with this, and tbh I'm pissed that he would try and play that.He assaulted those women.

Could Comey's bombshell stop Democrats retaking the Senate?
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Richard S Copeland | 125 | 1553541361332555_1553549981331693 | Nope, Dems will take the Senate and the House is on the table. That scares the Republicans. Unfortunately they should have been afraid in 2010 when they ran on a jobs platform but only voted to repeal ACA 60 times. No jobs bill! Comey should be exposing Trumps ties to Russia and the fraud charges against T. Rump University or his tax evasion cases!

3 | Mike Goldstein | 55 | 1553541361332555_1553544371332254 | If Clinton supporters were honest and said, "I will support just about any Democrat for president, no matter how personally immoral,corrupt and criminal because I consider defeating Republicans the most important thing we Americans can do on Election Day," I could live with that.
4 | Juan Manuel Mercado Sosa | 37 | 1553541361332555_1553554241331267 | That's was the plan, he is a republican, whom has openly donated money to the Republican Party. Comey went against his superior's order to make this public even though he has no information about the emails. This tells me he was desperately trying damage Hillary's image and the democrats.
5 | Christos P Mitchell | 35 | 1553541361332555_1553543681332323 | You mean James Comey breaking the Hatch Act in an attempt to give Republicans an edge in the voting/election?

7 | Karen Stendahl | 9 | 1553541361332555_1553633927989965 | Nope. Dems will get it. The Rep GOP has just once again proved what thugs they are. If they dont get the results they want..Let's just threaten the FBI shall we? The Rep GOP has done nothing for the people in 8 years but obstruct, embarass and cost people jobs. DOWN BALLOT PEOPLE!!!!! DEMOCRATS
8 | Taurean Russell | 15 | 1553541361332555_1553543171332374 | Yea and us Americans fear that this year's political antics and election has us royally screwed as a nation!
9 | Med Jersi | 25 | 1553541361332555_1553546274665397 | When a President is elected, they will bring him two briefcases, one for the Nuclear code, and the other one for the Top secret documents.Those two briefcases cannot and must not be between the hand of a lunatic, unfit, unqualified Man Without a Temperament. A disgusting con man who surrounds himself with a disgusting corrupt people. Putin's puppet ! Corrupt little man whose daughter vacations with Putin's girlfriend.Making Russia great again? Now think and think again. Don't use your hatred to cloud your judgment ! Be wise and save your country. I'M WITH HER
10 | Anna Mensah | 7 | 1553541361332555_1553605767992781 | We all need to fire all these Republicans who are in Washington wasting tax payers money, just being ignorant idiots, racist and not helping President Obama getting anything done even when they know it will help the American people; America doesn't need these fools as leaders!!!
11 | Kim Johnson | 9 | 1553541361332555_1553581831328508 | Stop it NBC, you know those 3 or 4 emails had nothing to do with any national security risk. You know Comey is on a witch hunt. Even Republican Congress members are saying what he did was wrong. So stop it. Stop being part of the problem. Just STOP.
12 | Paulo Kabale | 6 | 1553541361332555_1553562511330440 | I dont think Americans need a former first lady to become their president... too connected tooo risky.. dont you think... It is not a monarch for God's sake ..  why didn't the democratic party nominate another lady? If all they wanted was a woman president.
13 | Sarah Hammons | 3 | 1553541361332555_1553641301322561 | not if all go  and vote dem down ballot those idiots in there right now have openly said they will not work with hillary if she is elected .and wont even give any one she picks for court a chance,that is not working for the people it is childish unprofessional they have got to go. besides look how many of them flipped back and forth on trump to suit their own needs at the time.
14 | Cheryl Hammerlindl | 1 | 1553541361332555_1553795107973847 | Oh no this just makes me more inclined to vote for dems. Republicans have been whitch hunting for years. The light is starting to break through, showing just how partisan they can be.

Obama corrupt, killary corrupt, Billy and Chelsea, corrupt. Former chairman corrupt, New chairman corrupt. Lawmakers corrupt. How they want to America to correct country? That's evils.
17 | Allen Davis | 7 | 1553541361332555_1553545157998842 | I would rather see to it that zero Republicans and zero Democrats are left in the Senate/House.Independents only. The two party monopoly must die.
18 | Matthew Leach | 0 | 1553541361332555_1553682517985106 | The fact the the DNC rigged its primary to steal the nomination and that the nominee they stole if for is and will be under criminal investigation for RECO charges that should disqualify the democrat party from holding any government set or elected office. It's time the democrat party be disbanded, for corruption.
19 | Sandie Page Harris | 0 | 1553541361332555_1553686927984665 | Hillary's emails were subpoena and she chose to delete them. If she had handed them over, as required by law, this would not be happening. She made this mess not the FBI. The media is doing it's best to deflect the attention to everyone but the responsible party is Hillary. Liberals just don't want to face facts. They'll call it a witch hunt. It won't sway any if them. They really don't care.
20 | Billy D'Antoni | 0 | 1553541361332555_1553684007984957 | Why don't idiot democrats realize that they are not supporting the same democratic party that JFK or even Bill Clinton was a part of. The democratic party today is really a bunch of extreme liberal socialist who want to control every aspect of our lives. They want us all to be mindless obedient slaves who are totally dependant on government to give us everything we need. The progressive logo if there was one should be a hammer and sickle with Hillary flying over it like she is a god. Wake up democrats your party is infected with the cancer of corruption and it can only be cured by electing Trump.
21 | Paulo Kabale | 2 | 1553541361332555_1553559301330761 | The ugly TRUTH is that the current US government structure has enough checks and balances to control Trump's excesses as President but these same checks and balances will not be able to control Hillary... just look at how the mighty innoccent FBI has been turned overnight into a villain and a felon.. He is being stepped on like a doormat for doing the right thing. I think American voters need to realise that much as they hate Trump (and rightly so) the lesser of the two evils is him. Trump has done so many ugly thinks while in business and in talk. Hillary's bad mistakes and wrong actions were while holding some of the most powerful offices in government. For God's sake this is a woman who was once a first lady and a senator for many years which means every thing she did wrong, she did it intentioanlly. I dont think ten years ago Trump knew he would be compiting to be POTUS.
22 | Charles White | 0 | 1553541361332555_1553697854650239 | A referendum on the FBI finding more emails on a Hillary Clinton aid's estranged husband's laptop? Oh, I think not!No, that's not the determinate reason the American public should want to rescind Republican congressional control. America should not even be second guessing here, given congressional Republicans have no record but for filibusters and obstruction to show for their last eight years. They've existed solely as a failed, dysfunctional, and legislative paralyzed body for 8 years. A party with zero legislative accomplishments, and their credentials for being reelected is "... We'll merely promise more of the same for the next four years!"And that's congressional Republicans' 2016 closing argument--- core selling point, seven-days out from the election?Hummm, that was congressional Republicans' lockstep 2004, 2008, 2012, now 2016 closing argument also: abject failure as either the majority or minority American congressional governing body? Democrats oppositional arguments should be the strongest, given they actually have a record to run on.
23 | Tom Lacerte | 1 | 1553541361332555_1553616771325014 | Too bad, Hillary Clinton wasn't honest and forthcoming. She wouldn't released all of her e-mails, from the very start. Now, the Democrats are suffering from Hillary's poor decisions.
24 | John Nichols | 1 | 1553541361332555_1553643447989013 | Or, perhaps, since the press' attempts at changing the outcome of the election every single day have failed (and Trump is going to lose in a landslide) they are now focusing on throwing wrenches into the Senate election, instead ...
25 | Dimas Martinez | 0 | 1553541361332555_1553827584637266 | Democrats have destroyed cities and states they have been in charge of for the past 40 years like Chicago, Detroit, Washington, and places like LA and so many others they have made a huge mess  , I will say yes there are good Dems out there but lately they are rare,  if they win a single seat I will be surprised.

He said the controversial chant he was heard yelling had nothing to do with Jews.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Bert Pampanin | 1580 | 1553460594673965_1553467251339966 | Much like his idol, he can get caught on video, dead to rights, and still have the nerve to deny reality.   Unbelievable.
2 | Erich Keefer | 759 | 1553460594673965_1553473381339353 | Apparently Trump and his supporters seem to have major amnesia and cannot ever remember saying racist, homophobic, transphobic, sexist, bigoted things, even though they're all caught in video or audio or in written documentation. Huh. Strange isn't it!?
3 | Magalie Pierre | 409 | 1553460594673965_1553477864672238 | He did say Jew.S.A and I heard him very clearly. Trump has brought out all the racists  out of the woods because Trump himself is a racist, bigot, misogynist, vile, evil, and hateful man.#NeverTrumpVoteBlue
4 | Paul Shipley | 333 | 1553460594673965_1553463354673689 | Thankfully America knows Trump will destroy the economy. The Dow dropped 237 points the day Comey made the comment about new emails. Kiss your 401k goodbye.
5 | Skyler Weston Mays | 312 | 1553460594673965_1553461141340577 | Yet he is on tape yelling Jew S A. He is a antisemitic evil trump supporter.
6 | Lisa Sandona | 231 | 1553460594673965_1553525638000794 | I have to go with the Trump supporter on this one. After all, mindlessly chanting "Jew SA" into a camera in front of hundreds of people while at some raging bigot's rally easily can be misconstrued. I'm sure he was simply calmly reflecting on his years at oxford  working on his doctorate and caring for rescue puppies in his spare time. The fact that he also looks and sounds like the star perp in an episode of "cops" when they raid a trailer park should have no bearing. Shame on you, every single media outlet and every single non trump supporter who saw the footage, you're all clearly reaching....trying to make a neonazi look like he was saying something about Jews. Cmonnn...(Cue the "but Hillary...in 3....2....)
7 | Vincent Garcia | 167 | 1553460594673965_1553479221338769 | This guy looks like a human tragedy. Somehow we, who are prepared, by working for 30+ years, have to listen to morons who decided that riding ATVs, smoking joints, and drinking the contents of a brewery made more sense than educating oneself. These are your wages for that lifestyle. Don't blame us for your misery!
8 | Juan Wiseman | 95 | 1553460594673965_1553510264668998 | LOL! This racist idiot just triedto justify his "Jew-S-A" chant...By saying he was chanting with flawed speech to honor all Hispanics?Is there anybody else in Florida that this fool could possibly piss off? 😂
9 | Donna Sheed | 68 | 1553460594673965_1553480368005321 | This guy reminds me of either Moe Howard or his brother Shemp of The Three Stooges vaudeville act, DJT would fit right in. He wouldn't be one of the funny ones, just the stooge
10 | Carl Augustus Nix III | 60 | 1553460594673965_1553470301339661 | Why all this focus on ONE supporter? Is he employed by the campaign? Plenty of nuts on both sides. Lets find a Hillary supporter that says he wants to see Trump die? Trump is a HUGE supporter or Israel. This is a nonsense story.
11 | Winston Yarde | 21 | 1553460594673965_1553511128002245 | Good God what an insufferable douche he is! Can't even put down the beer and cigarettes for an interview that went national. He's like school in the summertime, no class.
12 | Karen Silas | 18 | 1553460594673965_1553486981337993 | Uh oh! He must have forgot about that job he had that helps feed his family and keeps a roof over his head or that Jewish coworker he says hello to everyday. Can you backpedal if not, maybe Trump will let you stay in that brand new hotel he built? His supervisor must have gone home and turned on the tv. Lol!!
13 | Jared Vincent Walker Sr. | 13 | 1553460594673965_1553530091333682 | In the light of day, the insects usually scatter. I just hope that his employer, friends, coworkers and neighbors all see him for what and who he really is and respond appropriately.
14 | Michael Shumate | 22 | 1553460594673965_1553482238005134 | Hillary hired this guy to pretend to be a Hillary supporter so it looks like hes a trump supporter. .....you people are idiots. And the NBC live poll tonight.....the one that NBC wouldn't let you see because it was embarrassing. ....trump destroyed Hillary. Lol. ...its cool though......you'll get a rude awakening soon enough. I can't wait
15 | Mike Duran | 17 | 1553460594673965_1553510274668997 | Anyone else catch the fact that he was more likely than not, inebriated during the interview, by the looks of him holding the Bud Light can in his hand?  Can we say "Drunk Uncle"?
16 | Michelle Lynn | 13 | 1553460594673965_1553541651332526 | If the dude has a problem with Jews, the jokes on him. Trump's daughter, son-in-law, and grandkids, whom Trump is very close with are all Jewish.
17 | Monica MoMo Roberts | 6 | 1553460594673965_1800792236868933 | Trump supporters are Excusonists. Is that a word? It is now. If The Republicans can pretend this rapist is a Christian I can pretend Excusonist is a word.  Excuses become them. More excuses... Rapist, wife is a porn star, the Klan follows him whole heartedly. However this guy who was saying Jew S A is getting roasted but NOBODY is addressing the real problem. Donald Trump is a racist and Republicans are ok with him raping girls and think its ok because they just don't like women and blacks.
18 | Krystal Brad Carpenter | 9 | 1553460594673965_1553509708002387 | There's always those crappy fans. From college football to politics. But as the record shows, there have been far more sour, violent and disgruntled Hillary fans. Just saying....
19 | Kaydele Shropshire | 3 | 1553460594673965_1251595381528234 | How is this chant (as dumb as it is) anti anything? It isn't like he said anything negative about Jews. There could be an argument that he is pro Jew, thus insinuating the word Jew as the first word of the name of our country. But....people wanna find racism everywhere these days.
20 | Sandy Coffey Frost | 4 | 1553460594673965_1800803000201190 | Just stop it, just stop it. You news media are either too corrupt or insane to see what your doing to this country. #1 Trump and Pence are on the side of Israel unlike the current administration and Clinton. #2 If this man did this, he represents only himself. If she happens to win this, the destruction of this country will fall on your shoulders. Wake up and stop being possessed by this wicked person. And one of his children is married to a Jew btw.

22 | Roovens Pierre-Louis | 1 | 1553460594673965_1803694689919605 | Seriously, that's news worthy? A drunk guy obviously having his fun at a rally saying, "JewSA". Did he threat any Jews? Nope!Did he say anything offensive to Jews? Nope!Yet, people get worked up over political correctness. Americans used to be have a world reputation for the freedom of speech. How do we get here without realizing?
23 | Darlene Ledesma | 8 | 1553460594673965_1553547741331917 | And this is why Trump is so dangerous. People believe, even with video proof, they didn't say or do what they actually did. He's been left off the hook so much, people think that's the "norm" now.
24 | Al Williams Sr. | 6 | 1553460594673965_1800752303539593 | Another deplorable racist coward who denies the obvious when called on his bs. Just another mark of the GOP. And his invisible "Mexican friends" should re-evaluate their friendships with him. 😑
25 | Craig Blinderman | 6 | 1553460594673965_1553522901334401 | Maybe he has a Cuban accent so the "Jew" was really "U". Jew know what I am saying meng? Nah, he's an antisemitic POS.

Wells Fargo is accused of overcharging hundreds of thousands of homeowners for appraisals ordered after they defaulted on their mortgage loans.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Mat Rod | 57 | 1553423064677718_1553431394676885 | They should be disbanded as a company and everyone from the board through upper management should not be allowed to work in their current positions.
2 | Kim Winters Tucker | 18 | 1553423064677718_1553585954661429 | I have never hated in my life until bought a house through Wells Fargo.  I would live in a ditch before I ever bought anything from them again and that was several years ago. They got what they deserve.
3 | Michael K Prator | 6 | 1553423064677718_1553653234654701 | Enough! - Wells Fargo needs to lose their SEC licenses and their executive leadership prosecuted under the RICO Act after these two immense acts of fraudulent behavior and blatant disregard to the laws and their customers privacy and trust. It is the only way to ensure other banks won't engage in these practices.
4 | Vincent Garcia | 14 | 1553423064677718_1553487378004620 | Wow 50 million! How are they going to survive this? Banks are not going to alter their behavior until Billions flow out of their pockets! Fascism must be put down. This is not Capitalism!

7 | LaSchelle Quarterman-Wims | 4 | 1553423064677718_1553611101325581 | Looks like I need a new bank. You know the only problem I had with them is when they belled out on my home purchase just 3 days before closing which caused me to lose about $2000.00. Because we had already did our inspections and everything.  I've been with this bank way before it was a Wells Fargo it was Wachovia.

He brings the Tasmanian-Devil to mind… he acts and talks just like the cartoon character. Hillary Clinton isn’t perfect, but after the three debates, it’s very clear Trump doesn’t have the intelligence, or temperament to be President. Now add Trump’s daily ranting and tweeting about everyone and thing, that’s “out to get him”, it's the Media, it’s the Clintons, it’s the Establishment, it's rigged polls, his shorts are too tight, it’s those women or/and it’s the corrupt system that's doing it to little Donald Trump. “That person in your mind’s eye – is - Donald Trump!” Does that imagine look like someone who should be President of the United States?  --- I sure don’t think so!

12 | Joseph Loreti Sr. | 0 | 1553393484680676_1553814304638594 | Hillary Clinton, a U.S. presidential candidate, is apparently in bed with virtually every enemy the United States has.A newest leak by Wikileaks reveals donors to the Clinton Foundation have been directly funding ISIS, and Hillary Clinton knew about it…According to a leaked Hillary Clinton email, Saudi Arabia was directly funding ISIS. They also gave $25 million to the Clinton Foundation.1. The fact that she regularly donates to her own charity for tax deductions is bad enough, but the Clinton Foundation itself actually puts less than five percent of its overall donations into play for the charities it supposedly benefits.2. We have also seen the numerous pay-to-play schemes running through the foundation that further disqualify Hillary Clinton and prove she may be the most corrupt politician not to just seek the office of the president but to hold ANY office.3. Leaked documents have proven over half of her private meetings while serving as secretary of state were with big money donors to the Clinton Foundation. What is most damning, though, is that many of these people simply had no right getting that kind of access.I am not sure what it will take for the American people to realize Hillary Clinton is a true criminal mastermind, but YOU better wake up soon or our country is doomed.

During a Colorado rally on Sunday, Trump unfurled an upside-down rainbow flag with the words "LGBTs for Trump" written on it.

1 | Dustin Ginsberg | 1193 | 1553359904684034_1553360768017281 | I love how it's upside down! Because our community will be in distress if he is elected! No self respecting gay men can vote for Trump/Pence. They want to push LGBTQ rights back 10, 20 even 30 years. Trump has stated he wants to overturn Obergefell and Pence wants to conversion therapy where they use shock therapy to try and "cure" you of being gay. Not to mention Pence signed one of the most homophobic bills into law. We didn't fight this far to be pushed back! Progress and equality must continue! Hillary may not be perfect, but she is our best bet at progress!

I do see Islamic flags being raised over Iraq, Libya, and Syria. Flags of ISIS. These terrorist accepted arms from Clinton, Obamas and John McCsin. These terrorist throw gay people off buildings to their death if they are lucky. If they are unlucky they grab their hair and cut their throats with a dull knife sawing on it until the snap the head off. Think about that when you think of voting for Clinton because she accuses Trump of whatever she can dream up. She's a hypocrite serial killer.
19 | Greg Noble | 7 | 1553359904684034_1553394111347280 | Trump opened his Greeley Colorado rally by saying "Uma" snd letting that float out there in a creepy way...he went on to say "NFL ratings are down...wanna know why folks? Kapernick"...please Gary Johnson...please Colorado third party CIA agent...back Hillary against the real evil.
20 | Michael Alan Smith | 7 | 1553359904684034_1553379831348708 | If Trump had burned the American Flag he'd of recieved praise from the left, but God forbid someone unfurl it improperly. He could take money from countries that execute members of LGBT community like Hillary has.

22 | Karen Silas | 5 | 1553359904684034_1553493998003958 | Now, hand that same banner or flag to Mike Pence. Mike Pence will cuss you out if you ask him to hold it up with pride. He hates GLBTQ people and their rights and had alot to say when the GLBTQ won the right to marry. I don't think Trump thought about his running mate before holding this up because Mike Pence would be next to Trump with a torch the size used to light large crosses on black people's lawns.

24 | Kostner Guyton | 1 | 1553359904684034_1778469072423777 | lol I just think it's funny how Republicans "support" LGBT people now when earlier this year y'all were talking about how you would assault Trans women if you saw them using the bathroom. And you guys were totally for gay marriage right! Y'all must think we have the attention span of a fly

6 | George Adams | 3 | 1553337744686250_1553387904681234 | STOP Election Fraud: Do NOT use Soros voting machines. Please vote to put Billery/Killery on trial for TREASON. She broke the law and belongs in jail. She risked our country and put our people in harm's way, and had Democratic whistleblowers murdered. Not only Billery is very dangerous, she will bring this country to a security collapse with cutting our military and a financial collapse by choosing a fight with Russia and ruining small businesses while sending all jobs overseas. Please don't vote for the DEVIL. This country needs to be free and strong, where people have a real chance at the American Dream. Billery should have never been the Democratic candidate to start with and stole the nomination from Bernie Sanders. She is the most corrupt candidate ever and works for the elite new world order who wants to make people obsolete with new robotic technology. She brings with her sinister powers and so do not be fooled by her fake smiles and phony consideration for the working man, or woman. Vote Donald Trump and save our nation. CNN until now has been reporting lies and gossip that was never admissible in court about Donald Trump. But tonight CNN, the yellow tabloid, must for a change act like a real news network and report the truth. Pray to God and pray hard that Donald Trump is our next President. We need to stop criminal refugees from coming here and take care first of our American veterans. We need to work on better trade deals so manufacturing will be back in America. We need to stop paying for parasites! The election is at stake with Billery's dirty tricks and it must be watched closely. Donald Trump is our only hope before Killery turns this country to a worse version of 1984 by George Orwell. I hope the next thing Trump do as our new much admired President is expose all the dirt, every affair and sexual indecency of every CNN reporter, including Anderson, Gloria, and that self righteous long brown haired woman. Then, HC must be locked up for the rest of her life. If you don't want more zombies on the streets, if you don't want to give up cash, and guns and freedom of speech, VOTE for TRUMP!!! We can't afford the status quo! We're losing our country!!! Dare, you pathetic paid patsies online of HC to call me names and I will take screen shots and sue you for libel!!! This nation is SICK of the Clinton cover ups. Stop totalitarianism! CNN=Clinton News Network. Hope Trump fires many of you when he is elected! Let us pray November 8 brings the change that we so desperately need. Long Live Trump, our savior!I am:1) A married WOMAN2) Have no kids3) Intelligent and educated4) Independent politically5) Trump Supporter, Truth Supporter, Freedom Supporter and a Proud American 6) Not a racist, respectful of ALL religions and races 7) Very worried about how globalism will annihilate our country as we know itWe all know main stream media and the system are rigged. We must never take our freedom for granted. On November 8 stand the lines as long as they are because our liberty and justice for all are at stake. Let us pray Billery/Killery will be arrested soon, AMEN. Please share and God Bless. P.S. For crying outloud, stop briefing the enemy Billery if you want to keep the U.S. safe!Hellery/Liary needs to have her clearance removed. Clean the swamp America! Huma is most likely a spy and Loretta Lynch, Justice Department director is as vicious as Killery, pleading the Fifth when Congress asked her about why so many millions of dollars "disappeared" and ended in Iran! We MUST put a stop to the traitors and tried them all for TREASON. PPS Huma=married to a pedophile. Killery=married to a rapist. That's how they respect women, ha???!!! JOKE! We ALL know LIARY is a pathological liar and an urgent danger to the sovereignty of the U.S. Please be careful about CNN too-they are ANTI AMERICAN. Who knows what more harm Killery did to our beloved country. Pray for our country and Trump. Ask yourself who is helping Hillery with the cover up and why...We want our country back!

Donald J. Trump has urged his supporters to closely monitor voting in "certain areas"— widely understood as a reference to minority neighborhoods.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Peggy Tressel | 200 | 1553326584687366_1553328851353806 | Actually, I think he meant in any dem stronghold. I have been listening to his speeches daily and he never even implied a racial element. NBC wants a nice juicy race war to cover.
2 | Michael Shumate | 146 | 1553326584687366_1553327824687242 | Donald trump 64 % Killary 36%Why aren't you reporting the results of your live poll NBC?Hahahahahhahahahahhahahahabbahahabbahahabhaahhahahhahahha

4 | Maxine Nodel | 42 | 1553326584687366_1553332088020149 | When Trump accuses the election of being rigged, he's just psychologically projecting exactly what he's doing!! This narcissist will do ANYTHING to get elected!
5 | Thomas Entrican | 41 | 1553326584687366_1553330368020321 | Please! Who's being the racist here? Keep your code words to yourself NBC. Everybody knows voter fraud starts with democratic graveside voter registrations.
6 | Will Mén | 8 | 1553326584687366_1553387288014629 | Chumps supporters you must be very delusional how can you support a pedophile he told a little 10 year old girl that in 10 year she is going to be his girlfriend. what normal human being would say something like that, he's 60 something year old men saying that to a ten year old girl "come on wake up already" he's a sick individual. Plus he said he loves his supporters uneducated. He talks about tell all the American company over seas to move back to the States. But he's a hypocrite in the meanwhile he has his clothesline made over sea, so he can make more profit "like always just thinking about himself" This pathetic excuse of an American. said that he was hoping for the 2004 Housing crisis to go under. So he can pick up cheap real estate on the misery of hardworking Americans. Maybe when he grabs you by the pussy like he likes to do to women's you mite wake up from your delusional state. And realize this pathetic excuse of a human being is very dangerous for America. All this is not fabricate is comes out of the filthy mouth of a racist bigot pedophile and serial liar, rampant xenophobe, misogynist and birther. And I could keep going on and on but for what You can't talk to Chumps supporters like they're normal human beings. They are so full of hatred that they don't hear anything that contradicts their distorted view of reality like indisputable facts!
7 | Bob Kellerman | 13 | 1553326584687366_1553330554686969 | You can bet that in open carry States there will be guys on the sidewalk with guns and threatening looks on their faces at Black and Hispanic neighborhood polling places.PS all the talk about voter fraud is really about intimidation there have only been 33 proven cases of people cheating

10 | Kevin Blaney | 3 | 1553326584687366_1553349404685084 | This is the same justice department that thought it was OK to have Black Panthers with clubs ON ELECTION DAY within 20 yards of a polling place in Philadelphia?
11 | Susan Mills | 3 | 1553326584687366_1553395434680481 | NBC,You are targeting the uneducated. Most intelligent people know this.   Nice try. Desperate will get you nowhere now.  Only people that haven't done extreme homework for hours and not watching what's going on are voting for Hillary.  You are looking extremely desperate. And yes, they better monitor the voting.  Criminals will vote for the criminal.   Nice try NBC.   It's all coming out.
12 | LK Morris | 8 | 1553326584687366_1553363568017001 | So Trump's supporters can't watch poll participation, but Bill and Hillary can show up to polling places and take selfies with supporters? Yeah...that seems fair. #doublestandards #rigged
13 | Will Mén | 0 | 1553326584687366_1553387764681248 | Donald Trump's prospects three weeks out until Election Day, and the problem for him runs deeper than the headline result showing Trump trailing Hillary Clinton by double digits. He's also underperforming Mitt Romney with key parts of the electorate, including women, men, Latinos, whites, and whites with college degrees. Just look at comparison between Trump's standing in our new poll and Romney's eventual standing in the 2012 exit poll:                                 Women: Clinton +20 (55%-35%); Obama +11 (55%-44%)Men: Trump +3 (48%-45%); Romney +7 (52%-45%)Whites: Trump +11 (51%-40%); Romney +20 (59%-39%)Latinos: Clinton +53 (70%-17%); Obama +44 (71%-27%)African Americans: Clinton +77 (86%-9%), Obama +87 (Obama 93%-6%)Independents: Trump +6 (41%-35%); Romney +5 (50%-45%)18-29 year olds: Clinton +18; Obama +23Whites with college degrees: even; Romney +13.
14 | Gaines Liner | 11 | 1553326584687366_1553332421353449 | There's nothing that anyone can do to intimidate a polling station like the black panthers did. But you weren't concerned about that were you NBC?
15 | Julie Smith | 3 | 1553326584687366_1553462361340455 | All of this nonsense could and would be avoided if an ID was required to vote. Plain and simple no need for the drama queen mentality. An ID is not a burden stop the drama
16 | Cacer Edgardo | 7 | 1553326584687366_1553332174686807 | The top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee says FBI Director James Comey should tell Congress and the public whether his agency is investigating Donald Trump's former campaign manager about possible ties to Russian interests.
17 | Dan Miller | 0 | 1553326584687366_1553752864644738 | no NBC it's not widely understood for a minority neighborhoods he was talking to every corner of the country because Democrats cheat and lie to get a win
18 | Teresa Mac | 0 | 1553326584687366_1553810057972352 | HIs references were saying to monitor minority neighborhoods.  Deny it all you want, but that's exactly what he meant.  He also told people in Colorado to go ahead and vote in person, even if they voted by mail.  That isn't really being covered, though.  Voting twice is voter fraud, exactly what Trump's been accusing Democrats of.
19 | Sam Daleo | 1 | 1553326584687366_1553413084678716 | Notice how NBC insinuates "minority community's" when Trump never made any comment to that at all. Just watch the areas they know fraud is rampant. We already have the fraud proof from 2012 and fraud proof from the DNC primaries. How much double think does NBC go through to come up with this bullshiit
20 | Kevin Noonan | 0 | 1553326584687366_1553625987990759 | The answer of course is for the polling places to be monitored by the local street gangs.  Those antiabortion zealots lasted about 3 minutes protesting at Cook County Hospital a few years ago. Oh, and those gang members should all be carrying licensed legal handguns (and be given the training to use them properly)
21 | Amilcar Lainez | 1 | 1553326584687366_1553653854654639 | Trump is right about the chances of people who hate him wanting to cheat on him... If the media, who supposed to be impartial, are only on the side of Hillary!!! Now imagine the people at the polls who will have the chance to destroy entire boxes of ballots!!
22 | Jenny Scott | 4 | 1553326584687366_1553330001353691 | And, in Minnesota at least, it is illegal for people to try to hang around a polling place - whether trying to intimidate voters or not - without written authorization from the State. Which means, it'll be election judges who are now forced to tell people they have to leave, which increases the likelihood of confrontation and violence. As an election judge... gee, thanks.
23 | John Lawrence | 0 | 1553326584687366_1553673104652714 | Great slanted reporting NBC News, "widely understood" meaning those in the MSM!  Idiot reporters, where did you go to school? Wait, what am I saying, all journalist schools are now liberal bastions!

Thiel claims that his endorsement of Trump has "surfaced a small number of those people who all feel that they can't say it in public."
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Kie Cochran | 495 | 1553284138024944_1553285928024765 | Trump is not a candidate. He is a pathologically narcissistic cult leader. He has the one gift of persuading his followers to suspend common sense and believe in him.

5 | Sheri Faye Sherman | 53 | 1553284138024944_1553300051356686 | These Silicon Valley Trump supporters feel they can't say that they endorse Trump in public, because they know deep down it is wrong to put a histrionic, narcissistic, misogynistic fascist in the White House. These bright minds must have skipped history class because their arrogance told them it wasn't as important as their technology. These are the educated ignorant that will help ruin our country for personal gain.

That all should not matter, what should matter is if you got your butt out the doors and choose to vote for whoever it is your supporting on November 8th. Win or lose .. best of luck to whom ever wins.

Goes on trial in Dec for a rape in 1994 of a 13 yr old. Attacked the parents of a fallen American hero. Belittled POWs, PTSD ppl and the war record of Sen. John McCain. Lied about how much money he raised for veterans and donated.   Called a former Miss Universe “disgusting” and fat, telling his Twitter followers to find her non-existent sex tape. Accused an American-born federal judge of being unfit to do his job because of his Mexican heritage. Likely avoided paying taxes for nearly two decades. Called most Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals. Lied about seeing “thousands and thousands” of Muslims celebrating in New Jersey on 9/11 watching the towers fall. Lied about getting a letter from the NFL complaining about the debate schedule. Tried to exploit the death of an African American woman in Chicago to say that’s why black voters will support him.  Settled with the DOJ after his company was found guilty of racially discriminating against minorities. Cheated on at least one wife. Was just discovered on video admitting that he not only tried to cheat on his current wife, but he attempted to do so with another married woman. His first wife and his newest wife both say publicly he does nothing when it comes to raising their children, it's women's work. Tweeted that women should have expected to be sexually assaulted when they mixed males and females together in the military. Said he wants to target the families of terrorists. Stated that he wants to ban an entire religion. Praised a Russian president who obviously hates the U.S.  Encourages the Russian government to commit espionage against Americans. Insinuated that another Republican’s wife was ugly. Tried to implicate another Republican’s father in JFK’s assassination. Sought out the help of former Fox News CEO Roger Ailes after he was fired following multiple allegations that he had sexually harassed women for years. Made Breitbart’s Steve Bannon one of his top campaign people. Had a former campaign manager abruptly resign after a report came out linking him to pro-Russian groups that were directly trying to undermine U.S. policy in eastern Europe. Called Carly Fiornia ugly. Has said climate change was a hoax created by the Chinese  — then denied saying it. Was a leading conspiracy theorist when it came to the racist-driven birther conspiracies against President Obama. Dismissed nearly eight years of accusing the president of not being an American with a less than 30 second statement where he didn’t apologize for any of it. Tried to blame Hillary Clinton for his racism. Re-tweeted anti-African American propaganda created by a white supremacy group. Played dumb about knowing who former Grand Wizard of the KKK David Duke was. Skipped a presidential debate because he was scared of a moderator. Has, on several occasions, suggested he finds his daughter attractive. Called a husband doing things like changing diapers and helping with the children, a man “trying to be the wife.” Has said he wants more countries to have nuclear weapons. Said he can’t release his tax returns because they’re currently being audited — even though the IRS said that’s a lie. Feels he has the right to sexually assault women. He has been caught paying FL atty general $25000 to drop his trump university case.  Has paid his legal fees from his trump charity which was just shut down by the NY atty general.  He has said women shouldn't be able to work. What a huge list his supporters are another story he has all white supremacy groups including Charles Manson and he has supporters with a new movement wanting to take a woman's right to vote away. Why any person especially a women would vote for Trump leaves me speechless.

5 | Rose Norris | 9 | 1553264508026907_1553400784679946 | Right here this is why the FBI need to take a serious look at Donald Trumps campaign and the people he has working for him. Not just because of his connections to Putin but because of all the sexual harassment allegations, the rape allegation and tax evasion by Trump, it should have been done weeks ago long before the election, these allegations need to be dealt with! If God forbid Trump wins, what then? Are these allegations going to be just swept under a rug or are they going to investigate and possibly charge a sitting president with these serious crimes?

8 | Wendi Sargent | 3 | 1553264508026907_1553275334692491 | Nancy S. WroteTHE STORY OF HILLARY IN A NUT SHELLA "MUST READ"To all of us, who are glued to the news, watching the election, the story unfolds as written by its author, Hillary Clinton.  She just couldn’t sit still and mind her own business.  After leaving the White House, she could have had a wonderful life.  She and Bill could have made millions in honest and decent ways.  Instead, the temptation to make hundreds of millions was too hard to resist.  She started to sell her influence, probably a little at first and it grew.Eventually, the Clintons started to get some huge payments with her run against Obama with the likelihood that she would run a better campaign later.  As Secretary of State, there was more influence to sell through the Clinton Foundation and through payments for speeches.  She probably prompted some of the largest payments into the multimillions by telling her donors that she was going to run for the presidency.  It worked.  Why else would Saudi Arabia donate more than $25 Million?  These donors were gambling, they played the odds, and Hillary had to play the part.  She had to run for president.  She would have been as good as dead if she didn’t even try. So, there she was, not knee deep, but over her head with Bill and even involving her daughter, running a criminal enterprise selling influence.  She was on a path which she could no longer abandon. This middle class woman was no innocent victim.  Her greed and her ego were in step with the pragmatic need to run for president.   As she and Bill were experienced presidents, she knew all the tricks to get into office, and she knew all the mischief she could inflict once she became the Queen of the kingdom.  She set this whole thing in motion, and just like the murderers we watch on Forensic Files, she thought that she was smart enough to get away with crimes about as serious as murder.  She rationalized just as criminals do.As with other criminals, once she was used to running her influence selling organization, after a while, she thought that she would never get caught.  After all, Bill had been the President of the United States, and his and her prestige put them on a platform of impenetrability.  Unfortunately, for her, like most criminals, she could not anticipate every turn, every person, every nook and cranny.  She probably would have gotten away with her crimes if she would have stayed as private as possible, but she just couldn’t just leave it alone.  She had to go public by running for the office of the President of the United States.  She had to put herself under a microscope.Now she is getting caught.She didn’t anticipate her mistakes or that someone like Donald J. Trump would come along to expose her criminality.  While we are watching the election, seeing the beginning of the rise of Donald J. Trump, we are also going to see the decline of Hillary Clinton and what has literally turned into a crime family.   She is desperate.  Her back is against a wall.  She has about half of the population and most people who matter totally involved.  One problem she has, though, is that her mentality has evolved and grown.  Once a person strays far from the path of decency, her criminal mentality leads to more and more actions which are off the wall.  She arranged for violent protestors to attend Trump rallies.  She probably arranged for false testimony from Mr. Khan and the women who claimed Donald J. Trump groped them.  She had no hesitation in labeling a decent man to be a bigot and a racist.  She did so well that almost half of America thinks extremely poorly about Donald J. Trump.  She was getting away with all this, too.Alas she made one mistake which was the beginning of her downfall.To make sure that there would be no criminal charges against her, Hillary orchestrated the payment of more than $675,000 to one of Director Comey’s trusted agents.  Due to Wikileaks, she got caught on this one.When James Comey decided to not prosecute, I had suggested that, in time, he would be ultimately seen as an American hero, the kind who used to be played by Jimmy Stewart.  He is probably a decent honest man who delegated responsibilities to his trusted men and women, and who believed what they reported.No doubt, Agent McCabe’s wife received this sum which is huge for an FBI agent, and then, Agent McCabe used his influence to wiggle his way to manage the investigation of Hillary Clinton’s emails.  It is no wonder she had such confidence that she would never be caught.  She had infiltrated the FBI  Now, we are just past the point in the typical Forensic Files case where the police have heard allegations of unimaginable criminality from a prior president (and wife) of the United States.  The police and almost half of America could not believe that someone with all that stature would become a head of a master criminal enterprise.  Their imaginations just couldn’t recognize something as ridiculous to be something which is tragically true.  Now, James Comey knows that she infiltrated his organization and corrupted one of his most trusted agents.  Once the police know who committed the crime, or in this case that there was a crime, they get on the path to prove and prosecute their case.  For so long, Director Comey was fed lies and he relied on the false information provided by Mr. McCabe.  Now, we are at the point where the police are looking at Hillary’s emails like a pack of hounds.  They are seeing the dark side. Now that Director Comey knows of the bribery, the bloom is off the rose.  She is exposed.  The police know that she is guilty.  Now, they are moving at rocket speed.  I am sure that Agent McCabe is no longer in charge of the investigation.  Other agents, honest ones, are hitting it as fast and as thoroughly as possible.Now, it is just a matter of time.  The FBI are on to her, and she is so guilty of so much, she will be exposed, hopefully before the election.  After all, she wants all the evidence put “on the table.”  She may get her wish.I doubt that they will be able to get things together fast enough, but there is a possibility that she will be charged and arrested before the election.Now, Hillary is able to put her mind out of reality when she performs her rally act, but there must be moments in the day when reality clicks in and she gets frightened.  She must be waking up at 2:00 o’clock in the morning in a cold sweat.  She knows that Mr. Comey knows.  She knows that she is going to get caught.  Her only hope is to become president fast enough and control the process.  Mr. Comey is a true American hero who will pull the plug before that can happen.  In fact, his annoucement last week may have done the trick.Donald J. Trump is right.  This is worse than Watergate.  This is unbelievably worse.  This is an American tragedy, which even Shakespeare couldn’t have written.As lawyers say, “The truth will out.”  Hillary Clinton is a criminal who has grown to a level we see only in comic books.  At this point, her goose is cooked.Watch her at her rallies as she plays her part.  Too bad that she has so many surrogates (some completely innocent) who speak for her.  In this regard, we will see if the Obamas continue to support her.  How did she get them to join her campaign?  Will we find that she corrupted them, too?One way or another, this is one of the greatest stories in American history.  Thankfully, we have Donald J. Trump to fix so much at this point.[If you appreciate this post, please do what you can to spread it.  Share it, Tweet it.  Email it.  Please get this word out.]

19 | Darren Blough | 10 | 1553264508026907_1553282081358483 | I swear you guys believe anything you're told. There is not one shred of evidence Russia did anything. Just because Hillary says it doesn't make it true. Russia is being used as a political tool to shift focus from an investigation. Putin's biggest crime is wanting to work with us against terrorists instead of giving them weopons and shipping them to sovereign countries to commit genocide for our selfish interests. Hillary = more war. Before you start bashing Trump instead of researching my statements, I do not endorse Trump. The fact these two idiots are the best we as a nation can come up with is extremely sad.
20 | Scot Hecker | 5 | 1553264508026907_1553289078024450 | Just so I have this straight NBC News..The goal is ,to blame Russia for hacking emails and exposing all of Hillary's corruption..So it's not Hillary's fault she's corrupt ,it's Russia's..Russia hacked Hillary's email and placed those emails on Weiners laptop in a folder marked life insurance.. Man those Russia's are great hackers..Then Trump somehow had something to do with all of this happening to rig the elections..
21 | Bobby Hammer | 1 | 1553264508026907_1553564884663536 | Another NBC lie ... I read the transcript and the FBI stated there were no findings connecting Trump to Russia..Let's get back to the real news Hillary is under federal investigation 8 days before Election Day .
22 | Brian Caswell | 0 | 1553264508026907_1553811557972202 | So he was opposed to naming Russia as the hacker of DEMOCRATIC E-Mails but releases a statement on Hillary Clintons that MAY OR MAY NOT prove anything less that 2 weeks before the election. And Trump says the election is going to be RIGGED, but by which candidate.
23 | Brad Henson | 3 | 1553264508026907_1553274384692586 | Remember when Obama said his administration would be the most transparent in history? Well thanks to Wikileaks's now they are, and now they're all pissed about it, liberal hypocrisy at its finest
24 | Mark Anthony Ramirez | 7 | 1553264508026907_1553276008025757 | Get ready for it folks. Its time for the media and Liberal politicians to pull out all the stops. They will say and do absolutely anything they can possibly think of to blame the Conservatives of destroying the world. It happens every single election. I certainly hope the voters are smart enough to do their own homework rather than blindly believing everything they hear.
25 | Mark Anthony | 2 | 1553264508026907_1553283768024981 | There sure are a lot of hearsay being reported by the main stream media. What happened to investigative journalism for facts before reporting? I also ponder, how many defamation of character suites are filed against the media?

Right now, 12 states and the District of Columbia offer Medicaid programs covering transition-related care, according to the NCTE. But that leaves 38 states with none.

1 | Ryan Spencer | 127 | 1553245091362182_1553247338028624 | Why should we offer gender transition through paid tax dollars aka medicaide? I can understand Food stamps hud housing and Medicaid but how is gender transition a necessity? Oh I know I'm heartless blah blah blah.
2 | Andrea Diaz | 101 | 1553245091362182_1553253678027990 | If you wanna change your dingaling to a hooha by all means go for it..but save up your own pretty pennies and stop expecting the public to bend over backwards and fix your gender issues.
3 | Cari Browne | 54 | 1553245091362182_1553253811361310 | There are severely disabled children on the list for medicaid waivers for years. They keep saying they don't have enough money. Where is all this new money coming from?
4 | Edith Sanders-Gipson | 50 | 1553245091362182_1553251708028187 | Lord Jesus, please help this nation of people who believe  they can undo what you have created! It is not my desire to have my tax dollars wasted on such evilness!
5 | Adri Alaniz | 31 | 1553245091362182_1553257524694272 | Isn't that considered a cosmetic surgery .? When kids and adults can't even get there teeth fixed or certain surgeries because they're considered cosmetic surgeries but this isn't? Not seeing how this makes any sense at all! In this case ever mother should be given a tummy tuck after giving birth and if a child needs braces or adults it should be covered there are many more cosmetic surgeries that should be covered .
6 | Carrie Jo | 15 | 1553245091362182_1553287294691295 | I can't afford to go to the doctor when I'm sick or need surgery myself to be healthy but they will pay for someone on Medicaid to change their gender because they feel like it...Nice
7 | Tonya Taylor | 14 | 1553245091362182_1553310198022338 | But Medicaid doesn't cover adult eye exams and eyeglasses??? So I can be blind at my own expense with no assistance, but I can receive coverage for elective gender transition?
8 | Carine Ndeh Njoh | 4 | 1553245091362182_1553260934693931 | America!!! smh. And this is one of the things r tax $$$$ shld be going to? Ppl choosing  to change their sex? Seriously! !! You cut budget in areas that truly need gvt aid, and  pay for this nonsense instead? This is cosmetic,  just like insurance won't pay for your Phentermine.
9 | Lucas Allison | 3 | 1553245091362182_1553353771351314 | Medicaid covering gender surgeries, but deny coverage to people who have REAL medical problems , this is the kind of junk democrats approve and push and yes I know there are some RINO's who go along with this. This is elective surgery, just like a face lift or tummy tuck and absolutely tax dollars should not be wasted.
10 | Troy R. Marr | 11 | 1553245091362182_1553254254694599 | ISIS is a threat to the world, our economy a trillion dollars in debt, with no manufacturing base left anymore, but Libs are only concerned about this type of nonsense- God, please help those of us that still see the reality of this...
11 | Nicolette Joan | 9 | 1553245091362182_1553259748027383 | Not sure this should be paid for when there are patients struggling to survive and in debt from a REAL medical crisis. God.
12 | Gig Eichelberger | 1 | 1553245091362182_1553317611354930 | .. but Medicaid won't cover teeth  fillings or cleanings ..they'll only pull them out and recipients  only  get 3 eye glass frames to choose from..
13 | Marie Sutter | 4 | 1553245091362182_1553290908024267 | Medicaid won't pay for genetic testing related to a rare brain disease but will pay for a cosmetic procedure. No wonder the PC agenda is out of control.
14 | Nick Dippold | 1 | 1553245091362182_1553589721327719 | Our nation is in turmoil, our infrastructure is failing in city after city, and we're going to WASTE tax dollars on passifying people with a personal "identity" crisis....Only in America can we be this STUPID!
15 | Tanya Robinson | 1 | 1553245091362182_1553606211326070 | We should Not pay for that surgery or anything related it's not a life threatening problem just like being fat isn't according to state and federal government's most states won't pay for a gastric bypass why should they pay for this.
16 | Jennifer Lea Thompson | 4 | 1553245091362182_1553324961354195 | Absolutely should NOT be paid for with tax dollars!!!! This is absolutely ridiculous!!! I have crohn's disease and can't get help at all, but if I want to change my hooha to a dick i can???!!! WTF, #TRUMPFORPRESIDENT!!!!
17 | Marshall Burroughs | 2 | 1553245091362182_1553331814686843 | People think they have rights to all this stuff.. You DO NOT. You have the right to "Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness". Period. Not welfare, free phones, are healthcare.. These are not rights. Why is history not taught anymore. You know the Declaration Of Independence and the Constitution. Democrats use our tax dollars as their giant piggy bank.. Unreal. We ran out of other peoples money a long, long, long time ago. Geez.
18 | Linda Caccamo Marshall Saylor | 21 | 1553245091362182_1553248321361859 | Sex Change is Cosmetic surgery and should not be done with tax dollars Period! If you want to change your sex GET A JOB and pay for it yourself!!!
19 | Sandy Coffey Frost | 0 | 1553245091362182_1553692457984112 | It's your soul. Do as you wish but I'm not paying for it.  If that's the case then tax dollars should pay for me to get vaneers' on my teeth and a lip job.
20 | Ram Page | 1 | 1553245091362182_1553268068026551 | How can you expect Democrats to know anything about the economy and taxes when they don't even know what sex they are?
21 | Chuck Dennis | 1 | 1553245091362182_1553534997999858 | One of the chief pioneers in the gender altering surgery from Johns Hopkins has come out against the procedure now.  It seems that as high as 60% of the people who have the surgery wind up committing suicide when they find out the surgery did not do for them what they thought it would do.
22 | Andrea Zinn | 29 | 1553245091362182_1553247284695296 | But cancer patients can't get LIFE SAVING treatment they need.
23 | John Friday | 0 | 1553245091362182_1553248994695125 | We have enough Virgina, is like parents in our communities are investing sex trade in their children, you know that parable, lazy people thought is mistake to breed boys in sex industry Thailand whereby every parents cutting kid's dick off for lubricative replacement like virginal hole. He side effect is that artificial Virgina overlaps so easy that customer complains about the go-go boys workshop owner
24 | Ryne Zuzinec | 0 | 1553245091362182_1553256954694329 | These comments are disgusting! If your kid or brother or sister or mom or dad were transgender, you would want to do everything possible to support them. Some people can't afford insurance, so because of that they don't have the right to live as happy human beings? Smh
25 | Larry Parker | 1 | 1553245091362182_1553304351356256 | 2.7% of Americans are LGBT....Lot of other issues before this miniscule amount of Americans with Mental Health problems get funding for Medical care...

3 | Meredith Cable | 244 | 1553201884699836_1553234171363274 | This is so wonderful. I am really going to miss the Obamas. Their kindness, their class, their unapologetic love of American children. Well done Kids..Michael would be honored!
4 | Faye Porter | 231 | 1553201884699836_1553230564696968 | Can't y'all lighten up for one flippin' FB post and just enjoy the scene? Whoever wins, everyone could benefit by a return to civility and at least an agreement that we can all enjoy each other's kids instead of constantly yelling the same old, tired, partisan, media sound bytes. The world won't end if you just smile at this post or scroll on past.
5 | Francis X Pfeiffer | 144 | 1553201884699836_1553245884695436 | these dancers were great---loved how the White House looked---Obamas, you two are great!! Will miss your kindhearted spirit! cp
6 | Jp Hernandez | 116 | 1553201884699836_1553240978029260 | President Obama is a loooosa. His dances are terrible folks, believe me. My dances, on the other hand, are beautiful. They have tremendous success. They're probably the best dances in the history of dances. My dances are winners. Everyday when I travel America, I literally have millions and millions of people ask me why don't we have beautiful dances. When I'm President, we'll have beautiful dances. They'll be huuuge. They'll be handled by the best dance handlers ever, believe me. Our dances will have tremendous success. The dances will be beautiful, believe me.
7 | Kimberly Dillehunt | 81 | 1553201884699836_1553247024695322 | Can't you shut your crap mouth and enjoy the kids. I watched this live and it was great! Take a Xanax and do a shot of tequila and just sit down and relax.
8 | Anna Brousseau | 64 | 1553201884699836_1553254261361265 | Omg is there anything you people can say good about the Obama's they are what love and respect and family commitment stand for maybe if you really take a good look and leave your hate and predjudice behind and take a long look at that family you would learn something positive
9 | Ebony Gordon | 39 | 1553201884699836_1553261168027241 | I swear some of y'all people are so ignorant and bitter it just don't make no sense.This thread is about kids having fun and simple minded adults got to turn it into something negative.
10 | Tebkap Pak | 97 | 1553201884699836_1553219108031447 | Remember when Trump was laughed at for saying Hillary had the questions ahead of time? Remember when he said Weiner had access to Hillary's classified emails? Remember when he said Hillary cheated Bernie out of the nomination BEFORE wikileaks confirmed it. Trumps been right about everything from the start.

12 | Vernay Lewis | 21 | 1553201884699836_1726482620933259 | It's so many racist comments in this thread from white people. Are you guys even looking at the video?? You do realize these kids are predominately white. I've seen references to monkeys, low income housing....I mean, has your racism now extended to your own children. I'm perplexed.Anyway, I see nothing negative about this clip. Kudos to the kiddies. Job well done and you'll never forget this Halloween. ❤️❤️

Here are the answers to some of the key questions surrounding the latest email saga related to the probe of Hillary Clinton's private server.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Rockwell Torrey | 106 | 1553199148033443_1553199221366769 | This is your moment. This is your time to take a stand. When your grandchildren speak of you they will recount that you stood for America. You did not surrender. You did not run away. You held strong for freedom and the Constitution. You defeated Hillary Clinton. You voted Trump. You ensured that America survived.
2 | John Bryan | 89 | 1553199148033443_1553202188033139 | NBC IS A JOKE!!! You keep trying to cover for criminal corruption. Hillary lost my vote!!! Because she showed me how much corruption is surrounding her and continues to surround clintons. I'm scared if she is elected she will definitely be impeached and then jailed. How is that going to look on America? Since Bernie is gone too and sold us out. I'm staying at home or voting for Trump.
3 | Jodi M Ritchie | 34 | 1553199148033443_1553209191365772 | Harry Reid is one of the most corrupt Democrats in Office. HE is the one throwing the implications around about Trump, in Direct violation of the Hatch Act, himself. The FBI has stated that they have not gone through all of the emails found on the computer because they stumbled upon it accidentally while investigating the spouse of Hillary's top aid for sexual sexually explicit emails to a 15 yr. Old. What they stumbled on was so egregious that they had to act immediately.
4 | Paul Desfosses | 22 | 1553199148033443_1553220694697955 | The Hatch act is not relevant, stop pushing your BS NBC. And oh by the way, the hatch act was enacted because of criminal, cheating democrats in the 30's, yes that's right the Democrats were corrupt for a long time...
5 | Phyl Burl | 15 | 1553199148033443_1553211508032207 | The FBI should've been much more responsible and winnowed through the emails FIRST instead of Comey making highly politicized statements and innuendo in order to influence the election due to his political affiliations.
6 | Valerie Lee | 30 | 1553199148033443_1553201731366518 | And she is not under investigation if you read the news. They don't have a clue yet if there's even anything about her in the darn emails. You find her guilty but you don't find him guilty of all he's done? He is by no means a good role model in any way, shape or form.
7 | Mercedes Amelia MC | 16 | 1553199148033443_1553211224698902 | Anyone who equates Hillary Clinton’s “issues” with Donald Trump’s Corruption has no idea of the facts. Consider, for example, Trump’s illegal contribution to Florida’s attorney general, Pam Bondi, after she received multiple complaints from Florida students that they were cheated by Trump University. Once she received a $25,000 donation from Trump, her office dropped the inquiry.Or Trump’s solicitation of campaign funds from foreign officials, in clear violation of federal campaign laws.Or Trump’s refusals to pay contractors who have done work for him, many of them small businesses.Or Trump University’s repeated scams.Or the Trump Network, a pyramid scheme in violation of federal securities regulations.Or Trump Model Management, which reportedly had foreign models lie to customs officials and work in the U.S. illegally.Or Trump’s employment of foreign guest workers at his resorts, claiming he couldn’t find Americans to do the work.Or Trump’s history of being charged with housing discrimination.Or Trump’s illegal dealings with Cuba while it was under embargo.Or Trump Foundation operating illegally.The list goes on. Donald Trump has a proven record of corruption. Hillary Clinton does not. Anyone who equates the two hasn't been paying attention.It would be nice to have an FBI investigation into these facts on Trump.(Jere). I agree! with Jere and I don't understand why Trump's errors and corruption are constantly ignored and this man laughs all including the FBI that instead of doing their job, create intrigue to favor Republicans. I VOTED FOR " HILLARY CLINTON " BLUE ALL THE WAY.
8 | Michael McDonald | 3 | 1553199148033443_1553306104689414 | Its not Comey that violated the Hatch act. It was Loretta Lynch that tried to quash the investigation so as not to negatively influance Hillaries Campaign. Comey made sure that didn't happen. I"m sure if she is charged with violating the Hatch act she will also take the 5th. Like she did with the Irainean money for hostages scheme.
9 | Mark Hamm | 9 | 1553199148033443_1553224248030933 | True Americans this is our last chance. The Political Democrats are lying deceiving non Americans run by the 1% of the worlds elite with all the money to destroy our country with hate and big corruption. To keep the good people penned down right where they need us and with time no power to vote. The far left and with there illegally immigrants set up to cast votes we  will be out number sooner then we think, and breed Democrat votes from now on, and with our hard working Americans tax money supporting them. It is a disgrace to our way of life. We must fight back with the biggest outcome to Vote in history to overcome this sinister way of life, it will be a sad world if Hillary Clinton wins this election.

12 | Kevin Couture | 13 | 1553199148033443_1553201761366515 | Very Interesting .... FBI Director James Comey argued privately that it was too close to Election Day for the United States government to name Russia as meddling in the U.S. election and ultimately ensured that the FBI's name was not on the document that the U.S. government put out, a former bureau official tells CNBC ... The official said some government insiders are perplexed as to why Comey would have election timing concerns with the Russian disclosure but not with the Huma Abedin email discovery disclosure he made Friday.
13 | Mark Weston | 0 | 1553199148033443_1553396111347080 | It's nothing new. It's a reopening of a case that the FBI reserved the right to reopen later. If it was a new case then it might violate Hatch Act. But it doesn't because it's a continuation of an old case started over a year ago.

18 | Jeremy Ruditis | 0 | 1553199148033443_1553389434681081 | An exception to the Hatch Act should be allowed if the person running for office is involved in pay for play or has done illegal actions which should disqualify the person to even run for office of the president such as Hillary is doing. She should not be able to do that for it shows that the elections are rigged hence why Trump is right in saying it is a rigged election
19 | Mark Weston | 0 | 1553199148033443_1553397334680291 | Please go vote for Trump. It's very close and we need you. The US Navy is prepared for an invasion of Alaska because of Obama and Clinton threats against Syria. We don't want another war.

If it was Anthony Weiner it's him trying to get a get out of jail free card. If it's Huma it's perjury which carries a 20 to 30 year prison sent in this case. Unless she decides to finally Flip on her corrupt evil boss. Either way even a person with a half a brain needs to realize how corrupt and evil Hillary Clinton is.

Clinton has become a multi millionaire through unethical, shady, and maybe illegal means.Trump has become a multi billionaire through ethical and legal means. (any significant wrong doing or finding against Trump would be front page news 24/7. Most of the minor accusations of wrong doing are false, spun or made up, or settled. Anti Trump people are desperate for dirt). Trump, a Global Business Leader (whether you have an appreciation for what that is or not) has a history of mostly success. Clinton, a career politician has a history of mostly failure. I look at accomplishments and performance, not rhetoric. Business leaders compete daily. Politicians compete at election time. Seek truth. The self serving government cartel needs to end. Our country is desperate for a real leader that will serve the people and make improvements.

You know, they’re standing there with no clothes. "

And it is unthinkable that the Director of the FBI would take this action lightly, that he would put this letter forth to the Congress of the United States saying there is more information out there about classified e-mails and call it to the attention of congress unless it was something requiring serious investigation. So that’s where we are…Is it a certainty that we won’t learn before the election? I’m not sure it’s a certainty we won’t learn before the election.IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT BERNSTEIN  IS A HILLARY SUPPORTER BUT EVEN HE KNOWS THIS IS HUGE. HE CALLED INTO CNN TO OFFER HIS ANALYSIS ❗️
