2 | Gregg Travis | 71 | 10155547804486509_10155547809861509 | Wish we could have four more years of Obama.....he was as good as FDR, Lincoln and Teddy......#YesWeDid   #StrongerTogether
3 | John Hinshaw | 59 | 10155547804486509_10155547813446509 | The scary thing to me is that there are so many people who continue to buy what the mainstream media and Hillary are selling. At what point does a Mount Saint Helens sized pile of circumstantial evidence convince someone of the truth.? White water, travelgate, selling plutonium to Russia, pay to play, Haiti, Benghazi, fast and furious, The body count of people who could've hurt them, rape and intimidation, conspiracy, treason, lying to congress and the American people, The destruction of evidence in an FBI investigation. To quote someone, "at what point does voting for Hillary Clinton constitute aiding and abetting a criminal"?
4 | Scott Mckenry | 76 | 10155547804486509_10155547807911509 | “In 2010, a massive 7.0 earthquake devastated Haiti, killing more than 200,000 people, leveling 100,000 homes, and leaving 1.5 million people destitute!” Billions of dollars were raised by the Clinton Foundation and only a few million was paid out! The Clinton’s will always take care of their rich buddies first. This is just one of Killary’s many success stories! I want to see a woman President some day; just not this Wicked Witch! Pay Haiti back!
5 | Steven Johnston | 30 | 10155547804486509_10155547814756509 | Funny how certain people refuse to believe a word CNN says, mocks them, discredits them........until they report something they like and agree with. Then suddenly they love them.
6 | Elizabeth Lafferty Graf | 20 | 10155547804486509_10155547826101509 | I would love to see what is on Giuliani and Kellyanne Conways emails. Bet that would make for some really interesting reading. Oh wait, Russia doesnt want us to see those. You can bet they have them though to hold over Trumps head. That is almost az scary has him having the nuclear code. People are idiots to not see what Russia is doing. Making us dance like puppets on a string.
7 | Tim O'Neill | 10 | 10155547804486509_10155547821606509 | No news to hear. It's called "politics" for those of you who finally decided to participate in the election process this time. Welcome to a world that some of us have taken seriously for a long time...way before the circus show we have now that has inspired your sudden interest. Stop being naive and grow up.
8 | Marx Stephens | 10 | 10155547804486509_10155547826186509 | Didn't CNN post a while back that it was illegal for the public to look at the emails? Lol so we're only supposed to read the bits and pieces you choose to report on? I don't think so.
9 | Scott Berrian | 7 | 10155547804486509_10155547812161509 | There's a lot of evidence that would imply a high level of stupidity, ignorance and straight up idiocy. From Podesta's password to Hillary emails on Weiner's laptop to the endless excuses that reinforce notions of idiocy and ignorace. Trump is a Twitter Troll, but I don't know how anyone can endorse the Buffoon Platoon with a straight face.
10 | Matt Bullington | 8 | 10155547804486509_10155547821861509 | OK yea it's bad that Russia is hacking our government officials emails but Jesus Christ look what they have exposed! The level of corruption going on in our government! It's pathetic!
11 | David Motley | 1 | 10155547804486509_10155547834006509 | I'm all for transparency, but the complete one-sidedness of the leaks suggest an attempt to sway the election in a certain direction.
12 | Ruben Reyes | 1 | 10155547804486509_10155547839506509 | Corruption! Keep letting social media influence your votes with Lies. It's embarrassing we are FORCED to choose btw 2 under cover criminals who care about nothing but the power.

Is CNN not reporting this so citizens remain unaware of the extreme corruption that Clintons have been involved in for years?

Trump would like voters to focus on the FBI’s continuing investigation of Hillary Clinton’s email server. Trump will stand trial Nov. 28th in CA for his fraud & racketeering lawsuit & then Dec. 16th, he & his 'terrific friend', (convicted pedophile) Jeffrey Epstein must appear in federal court to answer a lawsuit with charges of child rape & other sexual crimeshttp://www.rawstory.com/2016/10/reminder-donald-trump-due-in-court-after-election-day-on-child-rape-and-racketeering-charges/
20 | Mike Palmer | 11 | 10155547804486509_10155547813616509 | She's about to go down. If she becomes president, she will get impeached and that makes the VP the new president of the USA. He is worse then Clinton. He has connections with terrorist also.

Tonight's Game 7 will end a long World Series drought for either Cleveland or Chicago, and fans just can’t deal.

1 | Jimmy Robert | 2 | 10155547694251509_10155547731651509 | I just hope they zoom in on Channing Tatum at some point during the game. I bet he'll be wearing a hat and perhaps eating some nachos or a hotdog. Needless to say some will worry that those calories may ruin his figure, but if Step-up 2: Step-up to the Streets taught us anything, its that Channing is a professional. #Sports
2 | Joshua Norvell | 2 | 10155547694251509_10155547753991509 | My question is are baseball fans fareweather fans? I watch ESPN everyday and when they show baseball highlights the stands are empty! Then playoffs not even full, but if their team makes it to the World Series the field is to capacity with standing room only with "DieHard fans"
3 | Mark Miller | 5 | 10155547694251509_10155547734961509 | I'm an Indians fan but I'm not nervous. I'm tired. In some ways, I'm glad what happened last night happened as I was able to get to bed by 10:00. But the rollercoaster of emotions from this series combined with this years election shitshow has just tired me out.

3 | Ramli Xerez-Burgos | 101 | 10155547510911509_10155547516951509 | Republicans need to accept electoral defeat. People don't like your policies, so they don't vote for you. Hillary, Barack--they won. You lost. Move on.
4 | Janet Lewis | 36 | 10155547510911509_10155547574291509 | I love seeing my tax dollars at work. Especially when they're at work doing something they're not supposed to be doing. Like flying around the country campaigning for someone. Thanks CNN for the real coverage.
5 | Tena Wood | 45 | 10155547510911509_10155547524121509 | Hillary Clinton knew all along that Anthony Weiner was sexting young girls and did nothing to stop it. She's known since 2011, and never went to the authorities with that information. She's a POS and a disgrace. I wonder if Obama and Hillary and Michelle would have stopped Anthony Weiner sexting their daughters pics of his weiner? But they didn't step in and stop him from sending his weiner selfies to other peoples daughters. Sick people.
6 | Gloria Thomas | 17 | 10155547510911509_10155547566906509 | They are not for black or white or any American born...they create jobs for immigrants only..go in any manufacturing plant in the south and you find more people who can't speak English..than the one who do..the way they want is for people to go into school debts and fight over jobs that they can't find .a degree does not get you a job.the jobs they create goes to these refugees..and the average American is begging for bread.
7 | Jim Huff | 33 | 10155547510911509_10155547537701509 | African Americans are getting very smart, they have found  out crooked Hillary only wants their votes and will do nothing for them as usual like OBAMA didn't help them and he surely could have, but nope he helps his cronie crooks in Washington
8 | Judy Fergerson | 5 | 10155547510911509_10155547758931509 | shameful that he doesn't mind spending the tax dollars of Americans campaigning - but more shameful that he is out there supporting a person that is being under investigation by the FBI not once but twice.
9 | Sam Runner | 9 | 10155547510911509_10155547581151509 | Am I the only one that noticed Michelle finally took the high road and is off the campaign trail. Kudos Michelle. You know Hillary is a POS too bad your husband doesn't get it. He will when they make a fool out of him too.
10 | Susanna Duran | 4 | 10155547510911509_10155547588241509 | Republicans get in trouble with the law because of their voter suppression efforts, they get fined and have to comply with judges's orders and they target Blacks and Dems. How can any American support a party that does this? And does this openly, brags about voter suppression online, even the RNC gets in trouble here.
11 | Lisa Orndorf | 1 | 10155547510911509_10155547783491509 | Attention CNN on the situation room..you showed the NAACP president saying that in North Carolina  people could not vote if they didn't have their ID .....here's a little information in North Carolina no one has to show an ID in order to vote. What was  aired is false...so you might want to rectify that! thank you
12 | David Parrish | 8 | 10155547510911509_10155547656196509 | Don't be sheep....vote for the one who is not a CAREER POLITICIAN. The Clinton's have made their fortune selling POLITICAL INFLUENCE......nothing else.The politicians in Washington want things to stay the same. Bigger govt, more powerful govt.....less powerful WE THE PEOPLE. Trump is the only candidate that is NOT a politician. The Republicans hate him....the Democrats hate him.....WAKE UP. That should be enough for ALL of us to understand that they fear him. Because he MIGHT could burn the whole thing down.
13 | Chad Rigler | 2 | 10155547510911509_10155547746186509 | Since when did Republicans become the party that intimidates races? Democrats are responsible for all race issues in this country dating back to our forefathers. Do your homework America. Republicans work to free us from government and oppression while Dems work to control each and everyone of us.

15 | James Hansel Jr | 9 | 10155547510911509_10155547538701509 | I asked a young  Lady at a game, how she could vote for Trump, a “misogynist, a racist and a bigot”. Here is her answer: Because I use my head to research and find out what candidates really are, not what the media wants me to think.  Because Donald Trump has more women in executive and managerial positions than any comparable company, which tells me he is not a misogynist.  Because he pays these women the same or more than their male counterparts, which tells me looks for capacity and skills in people, not color, gender or race.  Because he fought the West Palm Beach City Council to be able to open his newly purchased club, so he could include blacks and Jews as members, who had been banned until then. This tells me he is not a racist.  Because he has raised wonderful children who have turned out to be outstanding, hard-working and compassionate adults. He must be doing something right.  Because his economic plans makes sense, are conservative in nature, and I vote based of what is best for my family, my friends and my country.  Because everybody, the left and the right are afraid of him, the media is trying to destroy his image, and even foreign governments are voicing their opinions, so he must be doing something right. Clean house maybe?  Because I want a Supreme Court that will uphold the Constitution, not behave as minions of the administration.  I have had enough with judges who are more like political activists than law enforcers.    Because I fear for my family’s safety if the current trend of not confronting blatant terrorism continues – which is a threat to our way of life.  Because I am fed up with the rampant corruption of this administration.  Accountability in government is paramount, and as this administration has demonstrated, it is a foreign concept to them.  Because I am fed up with the political correctness gone wild, and because Trump is not afraid to say what everybody thinks but does not dare to say. A thug is a thug, regardless of color, and that's it.  Because it is about time someone puts America's interests ahead of other countries.  Because I know he recognizes and embraces America's exceptionalism, and will not tour the World apologizing for who we are. That tells me he is a patriot.  Because, unlike HRC, he has actually held a job, worked hard and achieved success.  And last, but not least, because I am more offended by what Hillary does than by what Trump says.

18 | CJ Mehus | 0 | 10155547510911509_10155547732541509 | I'm going to go into a job interview and when they ask me about my very sketchy background check I'm just going to continually tell them what a horrible choice the other applicant is, some imperfect/unfortunate truths mixed in with lots of exaggerations and many bold face lies (which any good employer will responsibly FACT check)- I'm going to tell them that although I have NO experience I'll do big things for them, really, really, really big league (bigly) things. Just hire me you'll see. I'm not going to tell you how I'm going to do those things but there will be things and they will be big. I'll probably tell them some things and then tell them that I didn't say those things, even though they just saw/heard the words come out of my mouth. I'll also tell them I will need some time off in November and December for some legal issues (fraud and rape) and some more time for further legal issues after that but I'm uncertain of when since there are 75 pending lawsuits against me.........when can I start? 🤔
19 | Marjorie Lemons | 1 | 10155547510911509_10155547717861509 | That's because those States are making it difficult! It's a game to these States that deliberately close voting places in black communities and place all the voting machines in predominant white communities readily available at evening hours!! This game is by far a travesty to all Americans that Pledge Allegiance to an American flag and not get equality! Totally Sickening and Shameful! 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
20 | Keith C. Mentzer | 0 | 10155547510911509_10155547747371509 | Here's one for you. The African American vote is much sought after by the Democratic Party, stating they need them to vote. The Democratic Party has been the prominent party of that race since 1936. These same people are left alone after the vote, those areas are still to this day some of the hardest areas to survive. They even redraw the lines to accommodate the Party. Just saying

He’s the leader of the Democratic Party, Clinton has won the primary, and it’s the logical thing to do if you, as a Democratic president, want to jump into the 2016 to help your fellow party member beat Donald Trump in the fall. At the same time, let’s take a trip down memory lane, which I’m sure Trump and other Republicans have done, to when then-Sen. Obama pretty much called Clinton a political opportunist, who "would say anything to get elected" and “change nothing.”

25 | Jonathan Ogilvie | 1 | 10155547510911509_10155547676581509 | Maybe the problem is that the Dems chose to run a lying, cheating, scandal-ridden flip-flopping neo-liberal and that hasn't exactly inspired a whole lot of voter confidence?Maybe if they tried actually being, you know, progressive... the might be doing better.

1 | Steve Thames | 7 | 10155546836471509_10155547462036509 | WASHINGTON (AP) — A State Department official appeared to coordinate with Hillary Clinton's campaign team hours before the former secretary of state's exclusive use of private emails was first detailed in a news account last year, newly released hacked emails show.Emails from the files of Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta show that the department official provided Clinton aides with the agency's official response to a New York Times reporter in advance of the newspaper's March 2015 report that Clinton had used a private email account to conduct all of her work-related business as secretary.The stolen emails were released Wednesday by WikiLeaks, part of a massive trove of emails released by the document-leaking group on a daily basis since last month. WikiLeaks has indicated it intends to leak emails stolen from Podesta's account every day through the election.

1 | Deborah Jean | 1793 | 10155547236551509_10155547285551509 | I have never seen a president feverishly campaign for a candidate before. They are so worried that if Trump gets in that their corruption will  be uncovered. This runs deep.
2 | Veronica Diaz Pickering | 864 | 10155547236551509_10155547299801509 | At the end of the day, that's what it pretty much comes down to. I voted for Barack Obama, but never in a million years did I think at any point that the two men who ran against him were unfit for office. I knew that both men were good, decent human beings who would run the country to the best of their ability, even though we did not agree on how to do it. I do not have that same faith in Trump.

Trump is a mess as well.. that said... it comes down to policy... Frankly, Clinton has policies that will do more for the middle class than any other candidate... so if you can put aside all the business of sending one or the other to hell... take an honest look at their policies & vote your conscience

22 | Tia Mang | 11 | 10155547236551509_10155547306686509 | I love this intelligent man's words so much that I would like to share with the world..."A gentleman named Bill Howell eloquently wrote the below letter.Dear Mr. Trump,It’s taken me a while to realize this and to admit it, but I’m grateful to you.For the past few months I’ve spent a good deal of time lamenting your campaign and the poison it has so effortlessly generated. I’ve watched our country imploding, our public discourse become polluted, our political climate grows ever more corrosive, and wrongly assumed you were to blame.It’s only lately I’ve come to understand that you haven’t manufactured our current national ugliness—you’ve simply revealed it.By saying the irresponsible, mean-spirited, ignorant things you say so freely and so frequently, you’ve given other like-minded people license to do the same. You’ve opened up the floodgates for our corporate sewage to flow fully. People no longer conceal their vile mess, they now revel in it, they broadcast it and retweet it.You’ve made bigotry and racism socially acceptable again and that has been a kind of twisted gift because it’s allowed me to really see people; not as they pretend to be on the surface—but in the very depths of their wounded, weaponized hearts.Over and over as your campaign has persisted, your supporters would tell me that they like you because you “speak your mind”. It wasn’t until recently that I’ve realized that you speak their minds. You’ve given credence to their prejudices and made those prejudices go mainstream.Thanks to the terrible ground you’ve broken, politicians, pastors, friends, and strangers, both in person and on social media now regularly out themselves as hateful, intolerant, and malicious—and they remind me just how close they are to me, just how deep the sickness in us runs, and just how far we have to go together.You’ve emboldened people to be open about things they used to conceal for the sake of decorum, and though it turns my stomach, I know that this is the only way we can move forward; to have that cancerous stuff exposed fully so that it can be dealt with. Our progress as a nation is predicated on authentic dialogue, no matter how brutal and disheartening that dialogue is.In other words, you’ve let us know what we’re really dealing with here and while it’s been rightly disturbing, it’s also been revelatory. That’s the thing about that kind of harsh light: you’re forced to see everything. Beauty and monstrosity equally illuminated.Now don’t get me wrong, I think you’re the least qualified, least knowledgeable Presidential candidate we may ever have had participate this far into the process, and if you somehow were elected I’d fear gravely for the world my children would inherit—should it survive your Presidency at all. I believe you’re reckless, bitter, and completely reprehensible; the very worst kind of bully.But whether you win or lose, you’ve already allowed me the blessing of Truth; about me, about you, about other candidates, about our nation.And in the process you’ve also shown me that I am not alone in resisting you and this ugly thing you’ve revealed about us.You’ve generated an equally loud, equally passionate response to it and this is where I find my hope these days.I find it in those for whom equality isn’t just a cheap buzzword, it’s the most precious of hills to die on.I find it in those people who refuse to be silent in the face of our impending shared regression.I find it in those willing to be bolder in defending the inherent value of all people.I find it in the growing army of those who will not tolerate hatred as a core American value.I find it in those who reject violence as our default response to dissension.I find it in the ever rising voice of people who will not let malice and bitterness represent them in the world.Today I find my hope in those who, like me, will not be complicit in allowing bigotry and intolerance to become a source of national pride, because we’ve seen where that leads.Yes, Mr Trump, you’ve unearthed our hidden sickness and you’ve allowed it to go viral.You brought every awful thing about us out into the open.You will NEVER Get My Vote!"

25 | Aj Santana | 4 | 10155547236551509_10155547309631509 | "Republican nominee Donald Trump is an admitted serial sexual predator. His own recorded words confirm as much, as do the dozen or so women who have come forward to accuse him of sexual misconduct. His campaign is desperately fighting to put a lid on the growing awareness that Trump will be testifying under oath during a trial in federal court under the accusation of raping a thirteen-year-old girl and a previously undisclosed second girl, who was even younger.The case was thrown out in May due to a clerical error, but re-filed in June with two new witnesses – “Joan Doe” and “Tiffany Doe” who both say they worked as “party planners” for convicted child rapist and billionaire Jeffery Epstein. Part of that “planning” appears to have been procuring girls for the party, as “Joan Doe” revealed in her deposition that she convinced victim “Jane Doe” to attend four different parties with promises of money and “meeting contacts” in the modelling industry – a story that matches the account of another person who would arrange for underage women to attend Trump’s parties.At one of these parties, “Jane Doe” was forced to perform oral sex on Trump with a twelve-year old named “Maria.” At the fourth and final encounter, Tiffany Doe says “I personally witnessed Defendant Trump telling the Plaintiff that she shouldn’t ever say anything if she didn’t want to disappear like the 12-year-old female Maria, and that he was capable of having her whole family killed.”    NO Debra this is what we're woriied about. a pedifile as president.

3 | Aj Santana | 0 | 10155547090191509_10155547332521509 | "Republican nominee Donald Trump is an admitted serial sexual predator. His own recorded words confirm as much, as do the dozen or so women who have come forward to accuse him of sexual misconduct. His campaign is desperately fighting to put a lid on the growing awareness that Trump will be testifying under oath during a trial in federal court under the accusation of raping a thirteen-year-old girl and a previously undisclosed second girl, who was even younger.The case was thrown out in May due to a clerical error, but re-filed in June with two new witnesses – “Joan Doe” and “Tiffany Doe” who both say they worked as “party planners” for convicted child rapist and billionaire Jeffery Epstein. Part of that “planning” appears to have been procuring girls for the party, as “Joan Doe” revealed in her deposition that she convinced victim “Jane Doe” to attend four different parties with promises of money and “meeting contacts” in the modelling industry – a story that matches the account of another person who would arrange for underage women to attend Trump’s parties.At one of these parties, “Jane Doe” was forced to perform oral sex on Trump with a twelve-year old named “Maria.” At the fourth and final encounter, Tiffany Doe says “I personally witnessed Defendant Trump telling the Plaintiff that she shouldn’t ever say anything if she didn’t want to disappear like the 12-year-old female Maria, and that he was capable of having her whole family killed.”

Looks like my high school pep rally of 150 students. 6 days left, giving the crowd the bidness, to decide the future of this country. Now he's lying about the stats, because he has to. He doesn't want the country to know how bad things really are, and he wants to protect his pathetic legacy of failure. He sounds desperate, the country is teetering, hysterical, etc. Now BO is saying Donald Trump shouldn't have been nominated! He beat out 16 other candidates, HRC could bare beat one!! And she shouldn't have been nominated with all her baggage of FBI investigations, litigation, Pay for Play, Benghazi, Travelgate, Weinergate, Whitewater, just to name a few!

Their peaceful and generous nature makes them ideal neighbors, lending testimony to their exceptional family values and parenting skills unrivaled by any other culture. Their commitment to academic excellence enriches our schools and serves as an example to all who hope to achieve prominence as a people. Real Estate values are fueled by the influx of African Americans into an area due to their caring and respectful nurturing of these communities, an example of all they have achieved by their enthusiasm for self-improvement through hard work and a self-reliant can-do nature. Without their industrious and creative drive, we would be poorer as a nation.

16 | Fawzi Eyad | 12 | 10155546979256509_10155546989666509 | The problem with humanity is that we struggle to think on timeframes longer than the end of the month, when we get paid.If somebody tells a typical human that the polar ice caps could melt by 2030, the response will be "Who cares? That's not for ages", or if I'm being generous "That's not for ages, I'm sure science will come up with a solution".It's always the same. We tip tons of raw sewage into the ocean: "Oh don't worry, it's only a small amount of the ocean we're ruining each year"We pour tons of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere: "Oh don't worry, the atmosphere is massive, it'll be years before we do any serious damage"We cut down forests: "Oh don't worry, it'll be years before we've cut the whole Amazon down, and even then there are other forests in the world"It's insanity, we are a ludicrous species and are almost certainly going to wipe ourselves out - and we genuinely don't seem to care.
17 | Jim Pam Newton | 5 | 10155546979256509_10155547089161509 | Sea levels rise> more water surface> more evaporation> more clouds> cooler temperatures> more snow> more reflected sunshine> colder temperatures> more ice. That's how it works. Climate, it changes, always has and always will.It is not the weather's fault if people choose to build their homes and cities at sea level and may lose them any more than the loss of people's homes who build on the side of mountains and rains or earth tremors send their homes down the hill. People groups have ALWAYS had to move as weather patterns change.

Global warming and climate change are two seperate phenomenons and yes they happen naturally when we dont speed it up by thousands of years, now all coastal cities and islands around the world are threatened by rising sea levels and unless we all do something now it will not be reversible

Hillary will do anything to win straight up lying to your faces and smiling to get your vote. This Democrat has had enough. I see you Bernie! I won't forget what our party did to you. I'm voting TRUMP. Enough with the lies deceit and corruption. Time to take our voices back America
5 | Armin Smith | 403 | 10155546879586509_10155546882216509 | 2016 folks... where a white nationalist newspaper proudly displays their hero, Donald Trump, on the front page, and an arsonist sets black church ablaze in Greenville, MS with the words "vote Trump" spray-painted on the outer wall; just days after a Florida resident exhibited a depiction of two black dudes hanging by a noose in a tree with a Trump/Pence sign in the yard. Again, many white folks will continue to deflect to HRC, emails, etc. because this is not a visceral reality to them.It's time to wake up and show some empathy for your neighbors of color who are truly terrified of an America ran by Donald Trump and his livestock. #NeverTrump#Nevereverever
6 | Charlie Brockington | 205 | 10155546879586509_10155546891436509 | as long as trump keeps normalizing this hateful rhetoric this will not get better!  don't get mad. don't get scared. get up & go vote agaist trump or for hillary however u wanna see it!
7 | Walied Ali | 206 | 10155546879586509_10155546893981509 | Osman Hyder I don't know why but there's something more going on here, why would a Trump supporter burn a church and then write 'vote trump' knowing that'll only weaken Trump's campaign
8 | Barry Cardiss | 149 | 10155546879586509_10155546893116509 | Knowing the backlash why would Trump supporters do this? Such a dirty campaign from both sides I would not put it past the Democrat supporters to do this. Terrible and shameful whoever did it.
9 | Barbara Burke | 153 | 10155546879586509_10155546902656509 | I am POSITIVE Hillary PAID somebody to do this! The world knows she is a crook so this is something she NEEDS to do just like she PAID protesters to try and ruin Trump rallies. All so she can say, "See how bad he is?' LOL
10 | Connie Crucilla | 129 | 10155546879586509_10155546927241509 | IF this was a Trump supporter, you cannot blame millions of others and Trump for their actions. My opinion...This is a Clinton supporter trying to bash Trump.
11 | Jamie Blandford | 58 | 10155546879586509_10155546915381509 | If yall believe that Trump supporters did this and not paid Hillary supporters bc their campaign got hit so hard after the reopening of the investigation and her dropping in the polls...then yall truly are sheep.
12 | Darlita Lynnette | 47 | 10155546879586509_10155546920291509 | Looks like another set up to me. The Clinton Camp is desperate, and Clinton Supporters want to use racism as the tool to try to make our next President, Donald Trump, look bad.
13 | Paige Tackett | 25 | 10155546879586509_1131038653649494 | This is a Hillary supporter trying to frame a Trump supporter to gain the votes of a black American & just like the new article saying "the KKK supports trump" sounds a bit of a Hillary trying to pull a fast one before the polls. She has everyone so brainwashed thinking she's for the American people whenever she's off in countries making deals getting money from people that want to kill Americans. You can report all your lies and try to make us think Hillary is good but we know the facts and the American people know not to believe her stunts and dishonesty.
14 | Jason Bogard | 31 | 10155546879586509_10155546896796509 | Sounds as if someone is trying to make it look that way.. why would a Trump supporter wanna cause the spotlight change to him when it's shining bright on hillary? ..
15 | Chris Shipman | 32 | 10155546879586509_10155546920561509 | This is extremely misleading. CNN states it was a black church but that simply isn't true. This was a multi racial church. Why lie and make stuff up? Oh, that's right because that's what you do
16 | Julie Garrett | 29 | 10155546879586509_10155546894976509 | This shows how badly Trump doesn't get it....The crazy people out there are thinking this is OK due to the words he uses...and it will get worse if by some chance he wins....and maybe even if he doesn't.....sighs
17 | Alexandra Oliveira | 35 | 10155546879586509_10155546895701509 | I'm very scared for what is going to happen in this country after Election Day. Like, legitimately terrified. 😔 this country has gone to hell in a handbasket.
18 | Marti Rose Adolf | 17 | 10155546879586509_1762345320682818 | Obviously it was a set up to get people to hate Trump even more. Those vandals do not represent the millions and millions who support Trump. Obviously Trump wouldn't agree with this vandalism either. I hope they are caught!
19 | Jim Williams | 30 | 10155546879586509_10155546897661509 | Probably white Hillary Clinton supporters trying to make it look like trump did it , since Hillary said Senator Byrd from WVa was a mentor of his and he was a known KKK local leader Hillary's supporters must be racists also .
20 | Nicholas G. Rizer | 16 | 10155546879586509_1131046053648754 | This story, along with the man waving the confederate flag before ambushing two police officers, are set up PURPOSELY to distract the public from stories that continue to unfold from the crooked Democrat campaign. Don't be sheep, folks.
21 | Catherine White Cobb | 9 | 10155546879586509_1762345770682773 | Hmm I wonder  if the Demolib run CNN is grasping at straws and hired ppl to do this? sounds crazy right? well the current DNC has done this to Trump rallies and I do not trust any story like this given the lengths to which they will do to make Trump look bad- they are the cheating liars- people are tired of your BS CNN
22 | Tonya Trytten | 14 | 10155546879586509_10155546935166509 | The cop killer, Scott Michael Greene, had a Trump Pence yard sign and was recently arrested for waving a confederate flag at a high school football game and yelling obscenities at black players kneeling during the National Anthem. Two heinous acts by deplorables in one day!
23 | Le Roi Solomon | 11 | 10155546879586509_1131036463649713 | Enough with the "Hillary supporters did it". The demeanour displayed by a certain number of Trump supporters show a dangerous pattern of violence and dislike for ethnic and/or religious minorities. This is child's play to me compared to what i think a man who hangs two mannequins of black people from a tree in his compound would think of doing. The shocking thing is that Donald Trump has NEVER! come out to condemn this kind of behavior in strong terms. All his campaign does is to distance itself from the persons who commit the acts.
24 | Kofi Koranteng | 14 | 10155546879586509_1131033743649985 | This is a cruel practice from Hillary's supporters. Trump supporters are peaceful and  won't ever do this. FBI must investigate to bring the perpetrators to book
25 | Brad Straley | 10 | 10155546879586509_1131065176980175 | Willing to bet my left nut a Democrat did this to try and make Trump and his supporters look bad.I mean it has been Democrats committing acts of violence,  destroying property,  and stealing property 99.99999% of the time so far, no reason to doubt it's them again

12 | Steve Thames | 1 | 10155546706811509_672646772906275 | CNN will not report this! WASHINGTON (AP) — A State Department official appeared to coordinate with Hillary Clinton's campaign team hours before the former secretary of state's exclusive use of private emails was first detailed in a news account last year, newly released hacked emails show.Emails from the files of Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta show that the department official provided Clinton aides with the agency's official response to a New York Times reporter in advance of the newspaper's March 2015 report that Clinton had used a private email account to conduct all of her work-related business as secretary.The stolen emails were released Wednesday by WikiLeaks, part of a massive trove of emails released by the document-leaking group on a daily basis since last month. WikiLeaks has indicated it intends to leak emails stolen from Podesta's account every day through the election.

19 | Robin Perez | 0 | 10155546706811509_749024698586809 | We have 6 days before November 8 arrives and we cast our Presidential vote. This is one of the most important election that we are voting for. As a christian I am praying for One Nation under God. We have witnessed through the media  that our Country is no longer a Country of right and wrong, our Government is a criminal organization, full of corruption from the top down. The Bible clearly tells us in Isaiah 5:20 in the latter days:They say that what is right is wrong and what is wrong is right; that black is white and white is black; bitter is sweet and sweet is bitter.We the American people have a voice and a chance to help get rid of this corrupt. Please don’t let your temporary personal need for immediate gratification win out over the need to do what is RIGHT for this country when it needs you the most. We have a real opportunity to take a stand and change things in a positive way for ALL Americans, and you are a critical part of that change. Pray about your choice, I know I did and  I am Voting for Mr. Trump and the Republican Party. NO more Hillary, NO more Obama care. NO more Clinton corruption. NO more of the lies, NO more partial-birth abortions. We need a President  to strongly support our allies, forcefully stand up to our enemies, making the right choices regarding national defense, immigration, who supports our police, firemen, military men and women, we need a President  who will not leave Americans to die in foreign countries under the hands of terrorist, Who will protect our borders from criminal elements and terrorist, terrorism and small business regulations. We need a President to step up and do what they say and repair and mend other major issues facing our country. We need a President Who wants to fix our inner cities and our infrastructure, Who will improve our economy and bring jobs back to the USA, Who will protect our vets from dying in the streets and on park benches and get them help when they need it, who will fight for religious freedom and select Supreme Judges that will look out, protect and stand on what is moral. We need to really look and see because we are talking about our lives and the future of our Country, our families, our children, our grandchildren and our friends.  We can make a difference by voting and let your voice be known.
20 | Patti Grothe | 0 | 10155546706811509_748952661927346 | · Kevin Stewart) It's is my opinion that Trump is a pragmatist. He sees a problem and understands it must be fixed. He doesn't see the problem as liberal or conservative, he sees it only as a problem. That is a quality that should be admired and applauded, not condemned.Viewing problems from a liberal perspective has resulted in the creation of more problems, more entitlement programs, more victims, more government, more political correctness, and more attacks on the working class in all economic strata.Viewing things according to the so-called Republican conservative perspective has brought continued spending, globalism to the detriment of American interests and wellbeing, denial of what the real problems are, weak, ineffective, milquetoast, leadership that amounts to Barney Fife Deputy Sheriff, appeasement oriented and afraid of its own shadow.Immigration isn't a Republican problem – it isn't a liberal problem – it is a problem that threatens the very fabric and infrastructure of America. It demands a pragmatic approach not an approach that is intended to appease one group or another.The impending collapse of the economy isn't a liberal or conservative problem, it is an American problem. That said, until it is viewed as a problem that demands a common sense approach to resolution, it will never be fixed because the Democrats and Republicans know only one way to fix things and the longevity of their impracticality has proven to have no lasting effect. Successful businessmen like Donald Trump find ways to make things work, they do not promise to accommodate.Trump uniquely understands that China’s manipulation of currency is not a Republican problem or a Democrat problem. It is a problem that threatens our financial stability and he understands the proper balance needed to fix it. Here again successful businessmen like Trump who have weathered the changing tides of economic reality understand what is necessary to make business work and they, unlike both sides of the political aisle, know that if something doesn't work, you don't continue trying to make it work hoping that at some point it will.As a pragmatist Donald Trump hasn't made wild pie-in-the-sky promises of a cell phone in every pocket, free college tuition, and a $15 hour minimum wage for working the drive-through at a Hamburger place.I argue that America needs pragmatists because pragmatists see a problem and find ways to fix them. They do not see a problem and compound it by creating more problems.You may not like Donald Trump, but I suspect that the reason people do not like him is because: (1) he is antithetical to the “good old boy” method of brokering backroom deals that fatten the coffers of politicians; (2) they are unaccustomed to hearing a candidate speak who is unencumbered by the financial shackles of those who own them vis-a`-vis donations; (3) he is someone who is free of idiomatic political ideology; and (4) he is someone who understands that it takes more than hollow promises and political correctness to make America great again.Listening to Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders talk about fixing America is like listening to two lunatics trying to “out crazy” one another. ) Bush and Marco Rubio are owned lock, stock, and barrel by the bankers, corporations, and big dollar donors funding their campaigns. Bush can deny it but common sense tells anyone willing to face facts is that people don't give tens of millions without expecting something in return.We have had Democrats and Republican ideologues and what has it brought us? Are we better off today or worse off? Has it happened overnight or has it been a steady decline brought on by both parties? I submit that a pragmatist is just what America needs right now. And as I said earlier, a pragmatist sees a problem and understands that the solution to fix same is not about a party, but a willingness and boldness to get it done. People are quick to confuse and despise confidence as arrogance, but that is often just the reaction from those who have never accomplished anything in their lives despite having opportunity and ability and people who have always played it safe not willing to risk failure

But, unlike President Bush, Trump never drank alcohol. Obviously, his abstinence is not because he was once an alcoholic, nor is the reason moral or religious, as is so often the case.
25 | ChrisTeri Austin | 0 | 10155546706811509_748953315260614 | HRC is clearly trying to divert our attention to sexism and name calling, again. It's a diversion from her Second FBI investigation. Ask HIllary's aide Huma, "Did Abdulla Omar Naseef create your family business and were you working with him in ANY capacity on Septemeber 11, 2001? Yes or No? http:todaychristian.net/.../anonymous-releases-bone-chilli.../ Hillary blames FBI Comey, Russia, China...It's Hillary's fault. She had an unsecure server. She lied to the FBI and destroyed  subpoenaed evidence. That is a felony! The fact that Obama used a pseudonym from an unsecured e-mail account himself proves that our own President is GUILTY!! (wiki) The FBI knows it. The Media knows it. The public knows it. It is not a matter of IF Hillary is guilty. It's a matter of WHY isn't Hillary being tried and convicted! Her security clearance should be taken, now. Yet, the Obama's are flying around on air force one endorsing a felon chanting the same sexism diversion Hillary is to avoid America's concern's that his government insurance aka Obamacare premiums sky rocket again! The Clinton $slushfund/pay for play$ Foundation, that needs to be investigated. Is any of that being addressed? No transparancy! 6 days until the election and the corrupt skeleton's are flopping everywhere! HRC really thinks she will be elected because she is a female.  As a female, I see HIllary as a conniving, desperate, 3 decade polititian. I see money and power being her first priority. More important than our nation and our nations security. Her dark camp hires, trains, and pays women to spread lies about Mr. Trump and hires men to start fights at Mr. Trumps rallies. People got hurt! That is what a conniving person would do. Male or female. HIllary accepts BIG donations from Saudi Arabia a country that opresses women. She claims to support our LGBT family yet accepts donations from countries that kill gay people. 2 faced $$ Hillary!  Wiki shows Podesta"s "dumping" e-mail. He tried to say it meant something else. Look at the timeline. A dump is a dump! Why don't they comment on all the other wiki "truth" e-mails! Vote machines are flipping votes? Soros and on and on and on... Why did HIllary get the questions at two debates?  My enemy is not the person who votes different than me. We are not a cookie cutter society. Your vote is a historical right to set things right. #TRUMP USA!!

15 | Carol Scott | 0 | 10155546590851509_10155546959926509 | truth is that you’d have to work incredibly hard to find a politician who has the kind of history of corruption, double-dealing, and fraud that Donald Trump has. The number of stories which could potentially deserve hundreds and hundreds of articles is absolutely staggering. Here’s a partial list:Trump’s casino bankruptcies, which left investors holding the bag while he skedaddled with their moneyTrump’s habit of refusing to pay contractors who had done work for him, many of whom are struggling small businessesTrump University, which includes not only the people who got scammed and the Florida investigation, but also a similar story from Texas where the investigation into Trump U was quashed.The Trump Institute, another get-rich-quick scheme in which Trump Trump The Trump Network, a multi-level marketing venture (a.k.a. pyramid scheme) that involved customers mailing in a urine sample which would be analyzed to produce for them a specially formulated package of multivitaminsTrump Model Management, which reportedly had foreign models lie to customs officials and work in the U.S. illegally, and kept them in squalid conditions while they earned almost nothing for the work they didTrump’s employment of foreign guest workers at his resorts, which involves a claim that he can’t find Americans to do the workTrump’s use of hundreds of undocumented workers from Poland in the 1980s, who were paid a pittance for their illegal workTrump’s history of being charged with housing discriminationTrump’s connections to mafia figures involved in New York constructionThe time Trump paid the Federal Trade Commission $750,000 over charges that he violated anti-trust laws when trying to take over a rival casino companyThe fact that Trump is now being advised by Roger Ailes, who was forced out as Fox News chief when dozens of women came forward to charge him with sexual harassment. According to the allegations, Ailes’s behavior was positively monstrous; as just one indicator, his abusive and predatory actions toward women were so well-known and so loathsome that in 1968 the morally upstanding folks in the Nixon administration refused to allow him to work there despite his key role in getting Nixon elected.And that last one is happening right now. To repeat, the point is not that these stories have never been covered, because they have. The point is that they get covered briefly, then everyone in the media moves on. If any of these kinds of stories involved Clinton, news organizations would rush to assign multiple reporters to them, those reporters would start asking questions, and we’d learn more about all of them.That’s important, because we may have reached a point where the frames around the candidates are locked in: Trump is supposedly the crazy/bigoted

20 | Wes Catto | 1 | 10155546590851509_10155547417396509 | Fb,     These are my thoughts...Alot of the things that our democratic government offer are essential, sometimes a necessity, and often times quite enjoyable... People in other countries are starving! I've known people with children who were given as much as $1200/mo. in groceries. I understand that in a government- provided home, families pay very little toward rent, which provides a priceless opportunity for a struggling family to bounce back. With Medicaid included, you now gain incredible assistance with health, home, and food. When I think about the taxes we all pay, I can easily justify helping people in need, educating our children, paving our roads, etc. I know I have benefited from much needed assistance, and I may well need it again. Life happens, right? But...     With the deficit we are facing, conservative action MUST be taken. I would never consider stopping government assistance, but shouldn't we work out the kinks in the existing systems instead of implementing new ones. And if something doesn't work, let it go! Obamacare, for instance, sounded like a great deal! It's possible that with some tweaks here and there it just might work. Can we afford the repairs, though? My guess is no. No big deal. Mistakes are made. Let it go. Move on. Or better yet, move back. Progressive can be expensive, and right now we need to be conservative. How about implementing better screening processes for those on welfare. More follow ups. Also, let's make it less appealing! More uncomfortable. Two years ago, I lost my job, and made some poor choices. One thing led to another, next thing I'm doing is applying for food stamps. With me, my wife, and one child, I was getting close to $500/mo.! I found a job after a couple of months and after my first check, I reported my income and it was decided that I was making too much for assistance. No big deal. Nothing is free. I wasn't making much with my new job, and on top of paying regular bills, I had alot of catching up to do. I went from not working at all and eating like a king, to busting my back and barely scraping up enough to feed my family. Good thing my amazing wife,  Samantha Catto doesn't mind a little humble living! The next few months' menus featured different variations of beans, rice, chicken, and bread. I was extremely frustrated. Not about being a little hungry, but at how much easier it would have been to just "coast". How many people have realized this, and more importantly, how many have taken advantage of it? Not only is it not fair, but it is a doomed system in the current shape it is in. Not only is it easy to take advantage of, it can also be highly tempting to do so. I'm sure there are plenty of programs that could be great with a little work. I'm also sure there are some that need to go. I'm positive, that if we don't get this in check, we're all going to be broke and left with assistance... And I don't mean broke, as in scrape by, borrow money, etc. I'm talking no currency. With bail outs to big corporations, new programs that don't work, crooked politicians, businesses leaving the states, more goods imported than manufactured, and whatever else, all piled on top of a 20 trillion dollar deficit, it's no wonder I won't be able to depend on social security. However, what is a wonder is how President Obama finds it in the budget to campaign for the Sen. I guess they have good accountants or something. I sure hope so, because it's OUR money that they are playing with. Every dollar printed from the well-worn provider of endless Benjamin's, is another portion out of our pocket. That is why every citizen is in debt. If only democrats were liberal enough to know that sometimes a situation requires a change toward conservatism. Know what I do when I'm broke? Conserve! Any one of you voting for more programs and more Obamacare, clearly could not care less about your financial security. Unless you truly are clueless, misinformed, or, simply put, brainwashed, then you must know that we can not continue to support a government which spends money like a drunken lotto beneficiary..........I'll stop now. Forgive the rant...
21 | João Claudio Lima Nascimento | 1 | 10155546590851509_10155546738741509 | It's very appropriate to talk about the candidates, Hillary and Trump. I mean to watch their profiles, as I don't pretend to be American. Anyway, I'm astonished how people don't see a supreme virtue on Hillary, one that the Bible teaches, but I confess it's hard to learn. Let's see.Matthew 6:14-114 For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. 15 But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.Hillary Clinton forgave his husband when all the world was waiting her move, and it was a tough one. Forgiveness is a tough virtue, and people see only toughness, when forgiveness comes with silent, the proof of that is, as you know, Hillary is considered tough. She forgave her husband when he was almost a god on Earth, but I don't know if people forgave that god as she did. To forgive is tough. On the other hand, Trump is all, but forgiveness. Now until November 8th, it's people turn of forgiving Trump for saying his country is rigged, or it's not great anymore, what makes Putin's day everyday, and I hope Trump forgives people for voting on Hillary. About corruption, it's a matter of law, not forgiveness. Trump wants law and order, but, when he says "the system is rigged", he means it's HIS law and disorder, which means Trump won't bring law, order and even forgiveness.
22 | Tia Mang | 0 | 10155546590851509_10155547526131509 | I love this intelligent man's words so much that I would like to share with the world..."A gentleman named Bill Howell eloquently wrote the below letter.Dear Mr. Trump,It’s taken me a while to realize this and to admit it, but I’m grateful to you.For the past few months I’ve spent a good deal of time lamenting your campaign and the poison it has so effortlessly generated. I’ve watched our country imploding, our public discourse become polluted, our political climate grows ever more corrosive, and wrongly assumed you were to blame.It’s only lately I’ve come to understand that you haven’t manufactured our current national ugliness—you’ve simply revealed it.By saying the irresponsible, mean-spirited, ignorant things you say so freely and so frequently, you’ve given other like-minded people license to do the same. You’ve opened up the floodgates for our corporate sewage to flow fully. People no longer conceal their vile mess, they now revel in it, they broadcast it and retweet it.You’ve made bigotry and racism socially acceptable again and that has been a kind of twisted gift because it’s allowed me to really see people; not as they pretend to be on the surface—but in the very depths of their wounded, weaponized hearts.Over and over as your campaign has persisted, your supporters would tell me that they like you because you “speak your mind”. It wasn’t until recently that I’ve realized that you speak their minds. You’ve given credence to their prejudices and made those prejudices go mainstream.Thanks to the terrible ground you’ve broken, politicians, pastors, friends, and strangers, both in person and on social media now regularly out themselves as hateful, intolerant, and malicious—and they remind me just how close they are to me, just how deep the sickness in us runs, and just how far we have to go together.You’ve emboldened people to be open about things they used to conceal for the sake of decorum, and though it turns my stomach, I know that this is the only way we can move forward; to have that cancerous stuff exposed fully so that it can be dealt with. Our progress as a nation is predicated on authentic dialogue, no matter how brutal and disheartening that dialogue is.In other words, you’ve let us know what we’re really dealing with here and while it’s been rightly disturbing, it’s also been revelatory. That’s the thing about that kind of harsh light: you’re forced to see everything. Beauty and monstrosity equally illuminated.Now don’t get me wrong, I think you’re the least qualified, least knowledgeable Presidential candidate we may ever have had participate this far into the process, and if you somehow were elected I’d fear gravely for the world my children would inherit—should it survive your Presidency at all. I believe you’re reckless, bitter, and completely reprehensible; the very worst kind of bully.But whether you win or lose, you’ve already allowed me the blessing of Truth; about me, about you, about other candidates, about our nation.And in the process you’ve also shown me that I am not alone in resisting you and this ugly thing you’ve revealed about us.You’ve generated an equally loud, equally passionate response to it and this is where I find my hope these days.I find it in those for whom equality isn’t just a cheap buzzword, it’s the most precious of hills to die on.I find it in those people who refuse to be silent in the face of our impending shared regression.I find it in those willing to be bolder in defending the inherent value of all people.I find it in the growing army of those who will not tolerate hatred as a core American value.I find it in those who reject violence as our default response to dissension.I find it in the ever rising voice of people who will not let malice and bitterness represent them in the world.Today I find my hope in those who, like me, will not be complicit in allowing bigotry and intolerance to become a source of national pride, because we’ve seen where that leads.Yes, Mr Trump, you’ve unearthed our hidden sickness and you’ve allowed it to go viral.You brought every awful thing about us out into the open.You will NEVER Get My Vote!"

24 | Chris Farris | 7 | 10155546590851509_10155546635651509 | Let's just clear up some facts.... Women were allowed to vote depending upon what state you lived in. Yes... Many states did not allow women to vote. It was the REPUBLICANS that pushed to give all women their right to vote. However, DEMOCRATS fought to keep women from voting. DO YOUR RESEARCH and get the facts right.

1 | Carolyn Ryden | 779 | 10155546447466509_10155546471296509 | I don't get why ppl have to be so f'n cruel with their comments. Just vote who you want as president and respect other ppl's choices regardless if both candidates are not the greatest. Bullying is getting to be at an all time high and then ppl wonder why kids are doing it too. Smh.
2 | David Perryman | 496 | 10155546447466509_10155546497121509 | It's most likely her first and last chance to vote for a female presidential candidate. She's welcome to do so, but the rest of us can wait for a woman who is actually qualified and fit to lead this nation.
3 | Vanessa Patterson Woodard | 222 | 10155546447466509_10155546543186509 | Awww, bless her heart.  I can't imagine waiting over 103 years to be able to vote for a woman for President only to have Hillary Clinton as the choice.  I would love nothing more than to cast my vote for a woman but I think I'm going to just wait until the next one runs, so I can truly be proud of my vote.
4 | Gad Foltys | 169 | 10155546447466509_10155546474141509 | This is not a comment about this dear lady whom I have the utmost respect for, this is about the Incest of CNN and the ruling elite through the Clintons. A network of DECEPTION.
5 | Hans Neil | 146 | 10155546447466509_10155546466431509 | If you want a dark America... Vote Trump If you want a racist America... Vote TrumpIf you want a depressed America... Vote TrumpIf you want a discriminated USA... vote Trump.People with common sense and educated will never vote Trump. Smart people don't vote Trump.This country that I love so much can't have a misogynist, racist, narcissistic,  con man as president. Guys please let's get out vote Blue. You don't have to love Hillary just imagine a 4 years of Trump and how deep our country will be destroyed.
6 | DA Brown | 58 | 10155546447466509_10155546558431509 | A lot of you on this thread have NO respect for your elders! I would never in a million years say to or about an elderly woman some of the things that you all have! Shame on you!
7 | Rip Mcgill | 43 | 10155546447466509_10155546516191509 | CNN proved that its nickname, the Clinton News Network, is deserved. Only after WikiLeaks showed that Democratic Party honcho Donna Brazile, a paid commentator, twice gave Clinton debate questions in advance did the network sever its ties with her.Tellingly, Clinton never rejected the insider advantage against rival Bernie Sanders, nor seemed surprised by it. And CNN still shows no curiosity about whether anyone else participated in the scam.
8 | Allyson Fleming Bauer | 22 | 10155546447466509_10155546583211509 | This is a very amazing and historical moment for this woman and for all women. No matter who you are voting for, I hope you can set aside political differences and opinions to just appreciate this for the sake of women's history.We have come a long way!
9 | Donna Burton | 27 | 10155546447466509_10155546489876509 | It boggles my mind how anyone could vote someone who is under an active federal criminal investigation into office. Not just one either but two, One for destroyed email evidence & the other for selling out this country in her Clinton pay to play schemes.
10 | Kevin Simmons | 13 | 10155546447466509_696558083840381 | Ha ha. I knew it was going to be a story about an older lady voting for Hilary.  Of coarse it is.  This is CNN. Why write a story like this for trump.  It's ok that she voted Hilary.  She is 103.  She is too old to know better.

14 | Natasha Hilliard | 14 | 10155546447466509_10155546578106509 | What an adorable woman! To still be able to stand on her own at 103 is amazing! And she seems very cognitive. I'm not a Hillary supporter, but I'm touched by this video.
15 | Becky Kyle | 5 | 10155546447466509_10155546632666509 | Bless her.  My grandma who was born in 1894, always told me the same thing. She was married before she could vote. She wanted me to understand that women fought for the right. Today, it's more important than ever.
16 | Toni Findlay | 5 | 10155546447466509_1756188187978936 | This is a great thing regardless of who we are supporting. 1st of all 103 WOW I should be as blessed. Look at her, she is amazing! 2nd. so much history how great is the arch of her life? You go Girl!
17 | Dmitriy Mir | 2 | 10155546447466509_1756176351313453 | I am amazed how many chauvinistic pigs are alone Trump's way, man so afraid of women, especially powerful ones)). They dream of 50 politics, they became lazy. I see women who wants the bad treatment and ready compromise everything generations were fighting for. I see xenophobia, fear of competition. You Trump supporters are the worst collection of fears and phobias. It is the main factor that unifies you "Fear". And you don't want to fight it, you are for an "uncle Sam" who will do it for you, as you hope. But guess what, you more and more remind some religious sect and more and more sliding back in history.  You obtain same radical politics as any religion in the world.
18 | George Blom | 5 | 10155546447466509_696553537174169 | She was born about 50 yrs after the abolitionists won out and Lincoln (a Republican) wrote the Emancipation Proclamation. I'll bet she doesn't know that. What she should know is that Democrats have set African Americans back 50 yrs. Democrats/Liberals rewrite history, they don't want you to know the truth. But go ahead m'am...  risk your first time vote on those who have lied to you. It's not you who will pay the price.
19 | Arneisesha Hayes | 3 | 10155546447466509_1259123940774722 | It's a sad day when you guys can't even put aside your political differences and be happy in the fact that this woman has lived this long and can still exercise her right to vote. But no instead of being happy for her you guys call her an idiot, says she has dementia, call her a moron and other countless things you wouldn't want people to refer to your elderly love ones as.
20 | Connie Booth | 6 | 10155546447466509_10155546587576509 | God Bless her for being 103! And being able to have opportunity to vote for a woman in all city, county, disrict, state & now Presidential. It's a privilege to VOTE. DEMOCRATIC PROCESS.
21 | Kieu Dung | 3 | 10155546447466509_10155546597026509 | 51 GOP leaders don't vote for Trump and called him step aside. (There is no similar phenomenon happened in Democracy party). Pope Francis critizes his immigration policy by suggesting he isn't Christian. Economists point out the stupidity of Trump's economic policies, especially public debt policies. 80 major journals endorse Clinton (zero for Trump), People in all countries (except only 1) vote for Clinton, 70 Nobel laureates strongly support Clinton.That’s enough !!!Don’t believe in unreliable source like wikileak, because anyone, including republicans, can tell lie to wikileak about Clinton. Nobody can check facts of wikileak. Furthermore, many people make fake websites and try to fool other people that that websites get information from wikileak. Don’t pay attention too much in details because they may be less important than you think.http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/donald-trump-widely-condemned-republican-leaders-legislators-n662446http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/19/world/americas/pope-francis-donald-trump-christian.html?_r=0http://www.businessinsider.com/hillary-clinton-endorsements-newspaper-editorial-board-president-2016-2016-9/#houston-chronicle-these-are-unsettling-times-that-require-a-steady-hand-thats-hillary-clinton-4http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-elections/donald-trump-poll-international-countries-uk-hillary-clinton-rcp-us-presidential-live-election-a7367591.htmlhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-nobel-laureates_us_5806f564e4b0dd54ce364558http://crfb.org/papers/promises-and-price-tags-preliminary-updatehttp://graphics.wsj.com/elections/2016/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-on-the-economy/http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-election-trump-un-idUKKCN12C0UF
22 | Ginger Shissler Welch | 1 | 10155546447466509_696615773834612 | This is a heart warming story about a 103 year old woman who has chosen to use her right to vote to make that vote for a woman. For anyone who uses their freedom of speech right to make this something sinister, shame on you. Maybe if you backed a candidate that deserved a heart warming story written about him, you wouldn't be so bitter. God Bless you, Ruline.
23 | Ryan Mathis | 7 | 10155546447466509_10155546581331509 | Well I get the feeling that her vote would be casted for Hillary whether she was blessed to live as long as she has or not.
24 | Manny Marques | 2 | 10155546447466509_696591423837047 | So you dipshit Trumpzombies really show your colours every time. No respect for the elders or anyone for that matter.  Just like the sexual predator you're voting for, it's all about you. I bet that he would have a weekly reality show from the White House if he got in. It's too bad that the real American people are going to be in the middle of the biggest down spiral never seen before and a potential civil war.
25 | Jimmy Graham | 1 | 10155546447466509_1756173567980398 | Imagine the millions of Americans who lived here,worked here,died here in the USA and never saw the promise fulfilled until Barack Obama became our president..What promise?.The promise that if you believe you can,in the USA you can...And it may be possible for millions more to witness that dream fulfilled again..A woman broke that glass ceiling too..🤐

--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Jack Sylvestre | 355 | 10155546347806509_10155546355291509 | Hey democraps...Bernie supporter here from canada, how does it feel to lose the election over donald trump 😂😂😂?  Democraps be like: hillary is winning in a landslide😂😂😂with Bernie, you would have easily beat Trump in a general according to many polls. Yet you allowed Hillary stole the nominee. Good luck!
2 | Shay Isra | 313 | 10155546347806509_10155546348711509 | Hillary Clinton spent over 9 YEARS as the 'First Lady of Arkansas' at a WHITES-ONLY country club, only leaving after Bill's opponent in the 1992 election criticized them for it.
3 | Roni Khochaba | 209 | 10155546347806509_10155546361536509 | People dont listen its not a tight race lol.... CNN why not tell everybody why you told Hilary Clinton Debate Questions before hand?  Lol shes losing trumps winning now. They wont tell you that, they just keep on lying even more smfh....
4 | Brandon Horan | 292 | 10155546347806509_10155546351331509 | I fear that some day my son will ask me "Dad, why didn't you stop Trump from being president? Look at all of the terrible things he has done to our country and to the world."
5 | Jane Williams | 177 | 10155546347806509_10155546352266509 | Thank you to the battle states - please do not let our country end up in the hands of this woman who thinks she is above the law.
6 | Cl Frank | 232 | 10155546347806509_10155546357846509 | my family and I voted in tampa florida day today and will be for HILARY CLINTON, we decided that the best option is very experienced in politics, and looks to be a very strong woman.
7 | Ernest Delesma Sr | 88 | 10155546347806509_10155546363076509 | Trump the pedophile will be in court a day after the elections,for his rape charge against a 12 yr old girl, and then for his fake Trump University.
8 | Shandy Elliott | 79 | 10155546347806509_10155546359081509 | So I wonder how CNN will word their headlines when Trump actually begins to lead more states. They keep using terms to suggest Trump is still behind (when at least they are tied and Trump is still gaining momentum). CNN will find a way to minimize Trump's lead.
9 | Doug Petersen | 41 | 10155546347806509_10155546450346509 | So CNN believes WikiLeaks enough to fire Donna Brazile but doesn't trust the ones about Hillary Clinton? WikiLeaks is doing your job for you CNN. They have never had to retract any of their information. They are 100 % accurate.
10 | Jan Hobbs Chapman | 63 | 10155546347806509_10155546354466509 | I voted Monday ... straight ticket Republican!  Hillary needs to withdraw from the race now!!  No one in their right mind would vote for someone that is under FBI investigation!!  Hillary is corrupt, she is a liar, she is pure evil!!  She is a disgrace to the USA!!  #hillaryforprison #neverhillary
11 | Caitlin Hawkins | 40 | 10155546347806509_10155546367781509 | I can only imagine the dictatorship that will take place if Donald wins. So far he's suing everybody who disagrees with him. That's not quite how freedom of the press works buddy. You can only go after people for defamation of character, if it's false. Yet if it's true, it is what it is. There is more evidence of him ( through videos), acting  racist, sexiest, saying you can touch a woman everywhere when you're famous, etc... than there are of her. Arguing that her 30 years in leadership has been ineffective means you don't understand how our system works. She's one person, she can't change/run everything just because she's been around for 30 years. Look at Abraham Lincoln. How long did it take for change to take place during his life time? A pretty long time. Point being, the FBI didn't find what she did in the past to be illegal. They're looking at more info to see if it possibly has a connection. That's it. Doesn't make her guilty. Maybe a basic law 101 class would help some people understand. Wiki links feeds off of  conspiracy theorist and dooms day folks. I'm for her!
12 | Debbie Watkis | 44 | 10155546347806509_10155546370051509 | So tired of CNN airing everyone of Trump's speeches.  Why aren't they talking about his upcoming rape trial and the ramification of the fraud trial?  Why has that disappeared from the news?
13 | Chibenthung Shitiri | 26 | 10155546347806509_10155546368126509 | I'm not from America but I feel pity for Americans that both their presidential candidates are not good but I feel that Trump is  lesser evil than Hillary. Hope trump wins.
14 | Alec Drake | 28 | 10155546347806509_10155546363856509 | Hillary will win Nevada. Trump will not be able to overtake her early vote advantage and they always under poll that state. Hillary will also win pennsylvania. That state has never been in play. The real story is Florida. If Hillary wins Florida, it is over.
15 | Deanna Brand | 6 | 10155546347806509_10155546381051509 | 11/01 ANALYSIS: Monday saw a huge influx of votes. The data is provided by: State of Florida, Division of Elections."There is little doubt Florida will set a record this year. In Florida overall, the GOP continues to hold on to the lead, as well as in Tampa Bay with the exception of Hillsborough County which has more Democrats voting" DON'T LET CNN SPIN http://www.newstalkflorida.com/featured/florida-voter-analysis-10-31/
16 | Roland Manny | 14 | 10155546347806509_10155546437311509 | I feel bad for Bernie Supporters! Trump wouldn't have a change to win but my fellow Democrats rigged the system and now we all going to suffer from it. Let's all admit it we lost this battle , we have criminal nominee and under FBI investigation and Trump is our next President. Let's all get used to calling him President Trump ~~Dem From PA.
17 | Jennifer Douglas | 7 | 10155546347806509_1786084511637272 | Don't have a clue why any woman vote for this man ,a good man always remember and speak boldly about their spouse, that would give their wife a voice a spirit to stand strong. A strong leaders has strong spouses. Not saying his wife isn't strong but...
18 | Jill Priddle | 22 | 10155546347806509_10155546379751509 | Hillary needs FLORIDA to secure the win! Miami voters wait til last minute to vote so keep pushing the ground game to get out and vote Hillary!
19 | David LaBar | 7 | 10155546347806509_1260721380657523 | Technically he doesn't have to get 270, he has to stop her from getting 270, then it goes to the House of Representatives, guess what is in there.....a Republican majority.
20 | Liz Uribe | 7 | 10155546347806509_10155546444346509 | According to multiple sources, after the NYPD confiscated Anthony Weiner's laptop which was filled with Huma Abedin's emails they continued their search and discovered the property of Hillary Clinton in the form of emails that implicated her and Bill in the most heinous and serious crimes.  An NYPD source just claimed that within the emails on that device, Hillary and Bill are directly implicated ins a MASSIVE child sex/trafficking ring along with their friend, and convicted pedophile, Jeffrey Epstein. According to the source, “…It’s much more vile and serious than classified material on Weiner’s device. The emails DETAIL the trips made by Weiner, Bill and Hillary on their pedophile billionaire friend’s plane, the Lolita Express.” “We’re talking an international child enslavement and sex ring“ These claims were backed up by other NYPD sources as well: Jeff Epstein is a level-3 registered sex offender and the media ignores the fact hat Bill Clinton flew 26 times on Epstein’s private Jet and allegedly visited Epstein’s sex slave island. Now that Hillary has also been directly implicated, the media cannot ignore this any longer! The NYPD source makes specific claims about her involvement. He says, “Hillary has a well documented predilection for underage girls, and Mr. Weiner could not bear to see those details deleted.” http://redstatewatcher.com/article.asp?id=46461
21 | Rachel Tibbs | 5 | 10155546347806509_10155546482796509 | I don't believe PA will go for Clinton. We drove across PA in OCT and saw Trump signs everywhere, same with CT. May be a landslide Trump.
22 | Kimberly Garcia | 2 | 10155546347806509_1260737717322556 | The joke is on u , just wait and see chumsters because if he wins were all going to lose.

Oh yeah and when all the other countries turn their back on us , u better have your coupons ready.
23 | Robert Dunning | 7 | 10155546347806509_10155546361076509 | Wow "In Nevada, the poll suggests the race has also shifted, with Trump now ahead there 49% to 43%, with 5% behind Libertarian Gary Johnson, compared with a two-point Clinton edge in mid-October"

25 | Francesco Frank Matrà | 0 | 10155546347806509_1790998477819446 | Omg CNN is begging for a horse race. 2 weeks ago Hillary was up 12 points now they're neck n neck. I guarantee u if she was losing the race before the James Comey announcement they would of never spoke of it. They're trying to make this is a close race when it isn't

"I need everybody to understand that everything we've done is dependent on me being able to pass the baton to somebody who believes in the same things I believe in," President Obama said.

1 | Allen Johnson | 3245 | 10155546214236509_10155546216511509 | That's the point!  We don't want the same things you believe in.
2 | Laurie Jarosz Berger | 1259 | 10155546214236509_10155546220366509 | That's the whole point... to undo Pres. Obama's "legacy"...failed legacy.
3 | Sean Hill | 1801 | 10155546214236509_10155546220021509 | So, I am reading that Hillary is really upset that the FBI is "dumping" on her right before the election.... I want to say to Mrs. Clinton, "So Hillary, how does it feel to be aborted 8 days before delivery?"
4 | Jonathan Vera | 562 | 10155546214236509_10155546225021509 | That's a good thing for all americans! Obamas "legacy" has America on the edge of financial collapse put us in a sinkhole in the middle east and is poking a nuclear superpower we need a serious change of direction
5 | Shawn Tyler | 402 | 10155546214236509_10155546221501509 | As a Black Voter, Trump has no reason to have my vote. Anyone who wants to bring back Stop and Frisk is not for people of color.Edit: I upset a ton of Trump Supporters😂😂😂
6 | Moses Karugaba | 489 | 10155546214236509_10155546240356509 | What Legacy? Am a real BLACK MAN, i could even call myself a monkey, my brother, we say it was better while we waited for you to become president of the USA, You come, we become happy, we saw, we found nothing but love for Gays not Blacks, now we have nothing to look forward to in you and your legacy. We are going into the Donald J. Trump train, atleast we know its going somewhere!! Go and rest!
7 | Alec Drake | 358 | 10155546214236509_10155546222771509 | I'm voting bright and early for Hillary on November 8. I think Obama has been a great president and want to build on the progress he has made. Hillary is the candidate who will do it. She is also qualified for the job unlike the orange man.
8 | NaTasha King-Welsch | 181 | 10155546214236509_10155546238766509 | I already voted for her!!! And not because she's a woman, not because President Obama said so, not because I'm black. But because she's the most qualified!
9 | Rob Layton | 222 | 10155546214236509_10155546215726509 | A new email released by Wikileaks as part of the Podesta dump features Hillary ally Wendy Bronfein advising Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta on how to reach “f**king dumb” young people.Marketing executive Bronfein tells Podesta that Clinton “may not be the best face” to attract younger voters and that she needs to utilize “trending figures” as par of an “infusion to pull younger voters” because “that’s the crap that young people pay attention to”.Bronfein goes on to state, “It’s f**king dumb but being “cool” counts for more than it maybe should.”She references Bill Clinton’s saxophone playing as an example of this before asserting, “I hate to generalize a generation but by social media nature, they “follow”. So if someone they identify as cool endorses – they will likely fall in line with that candidate.”
10 | Jamie Renee | 143 | 10155546214236509_10155546235551509 | His legacy involved multiple lies, the worst healthcare plan in the world, the worst race relations in 50 years, the most abusive government known and the unaffordable care act. We don't want his beliefs, we want someone who has their own beliefs.
11 | Joseph Patrick | 81 | 10155546214236509_10155546227681509 | The only one bringing down your legacy is hillary, Obama. You are in charge of your own fait and what they will say about you in the history books... did you pull out your support before the inditement or did you support the biggest career criminal in US history.
12 | Blessed M. Frank | 83 | 10155546214236509_10155546263746509 | And what are his legacies?The brutal murder and miming of blacks?the championing of same sex marriage across the world?Or maybe the fueling of terrorism in Syria?The toppling of legitimate government in Libya and Egypt?Obama should buried his face In shame, he's a big disgrace to the Africans.
13 | John Plunk | 89 | 10155546214236509_10155546260936509 | He couldn't have been more truthful, if you want four more years of Obama, vote Clinton. If you would like to see some changes made in Washington D. C., vote Trump !
14 | Keith Roberts | 63 | 10155546214236509_1830772277136638 | Legacy...hmmm..a failing healthcare system...funding terrorist and destabilizing the middle east...supporting dissension and racial division in the U.S. ....allowing unvetted immigrants with radical Islamic views to permeate our society...Yes Mr. Obama. We need to destroy that legacy!!
15 | Justin Perry | 49 | 10155546214236509_1830773870469812 | So it's ok for Obama to say this to black voters but if a white president said this to white voters about Obama than it would be racist and we would get the pitch forks out... But here we go the only thing Obama did was Obama care and it sucks...
16 | Kimberly Crocker Hilgendorf | 45 | 10155546214236509_1783717418559711 | What legacy is that?  The legacy that left African Americans in worse shape than they were when you took office?  The legacy that 5.5 million more people are living in poverty since you took office?  The legacy that you took on more debt in your 8 years compared to all the other presidents combined?  The legacy of a failed Obamacare that cost tax payers billions and now premiums are skyrocketing?
17 | Jon Klock | 39 | 10155546214236509_1761676010748655 | Thats right folks, Obama needs to pass the baton to someone who believes in .....FrackingBig pharmaTppNaftaDomaCitizens unitedOffshore drillingElection fraudArms deals with dictatorsRepeal of glass steagal&dont forget all those drone bombs landing on innocent people!Great job America!
18 | Louis Griffin | 23 | 10155546214236509_10155546237671509 | North Carolina African Americans must not care about the Obama legacy.or the progress made in the last 8 years. Because early voting is down 5% for African Americans in NC..
19 | Warren Walker | 36 | 10155546214236509_1761676577415265 | That is why smart Americans are voting for Trump because he will undo as much of the Obama damage that he can and Hillary will continue the destruction.  Hopefully the smart Americans out number the dumb Americans by millions so we don't have a murdering lying old hag in the White House to hasten the down fall of America.  Vote Trump on Nov. 8th to save America from destruction.
20 | Kody Morrell | 43 | 10155546214236509_10155546233306509 | Obamacare is a disaster! Anyone voting for a continuation of his policies are hanging a burdeonsome debt around the neck of millions of Americans who cant afford it. Shame on you CNN for trying to campaign for the liberal left. You are disgusting.
21 | Edwin Reyes | 19 | 10155546214236509_1761676390748617 | Barack Obama is the best President this country's ever had ! You white folks are 😡 mad because you're the new minority, you can't fit in in the new , progressive America , y'all feel left out don't y'all ! Hooray Obama, Hooray Hillary ! She's gonna beat the crap 💩 outta tRump and his deplorables !
22 | Jeanne Rogers | 24 | 10155546214236509_10155546254931509 | Thank God he wld undo your legacy cus it's a bad one! You shld be thankful that it's still somewhat repairable and he's willing to put back together what you have destroyed! Vote Trump
23 | Jerry Fowler | 15 | 10155546214236509_1761681930748063 | 57% approval rating! The highest from a exiting President. Obama administration brought us out of the worse recession. The unemployment rate is below 5%. The national gas prices are $2.21 and falling. The economy grew 2.9%. Again I will say it, Clinton will win by a landslide! How in the hell is Trump going to win without the black vote, the Latino vote.
24 | ChrisTeri Austin | 21 | 10155546214236509_10155546263461509 | HRC is AGAIN exploiting women to divert our attention from her second FBI investigation. First, her mess is her fault!. She used a private e-mail server/ unsecure server. It's not the fault of FBI Comey, Russia, or China. HRC destroyed subpoenaed evidence. That is a felony! The FBI knows it. The Media knows it. The public knows it. It is not a matter of IF she is guilty. It's a matter of WHY isn't she being tried and convicted, now? Now the Obama's are flying around on air force one endorsing a felon, avoiding REAL issues. Will Obama address the high premiums on his gov't insurance- Obamacare? The Clinton $slushfund$ Foundation to be investigated. None of that will be addressed in these last 6 days? HRC is yet to be held accountable! Instead, let's focus on Mr. Trumps words. Pathetic that Obama's and HIllary are promoting Sexism! Words Mr. Trump said or says do not compare to HRC corrupt criminal actions!  HRC really thinks she will be elected because she is a girl. No. As a female and mother of 3 grown loving and respectful sons I point out that HRC behaving like a conniving female. She is playing on women's emotions to avoid accountablility for her actions. HIllary used and hired women to spread rumors about Mr. Trump. (Debunked lies). HRC hires birddogs. Her camp trains, and pays people to start fights at Mr. Trumps rally's. People got hurt! That is evil. Wiki shows Podesta "dumping" e-mail. He tried to say it meant something else. Look at the timeline. A dump is a dump! Why don't they comment on all the other wiki "truth" e-mails! HRC is a liar. HRC is a cheater. (answers to the debate given to her-twice!) Double dip donations-she claims to support the LGBT family yet her big $ donor kills gay people- 2 faced HIllary!  HRC has blood on her hands. Benghazi. We have bigger concerns. A safe and secure nation for our kids and grandkids. HRC and Obama gave us ISIS. HRC should have her security clearance taken now! Your vote is a historical right to set things right. Corrupt polititians "You're Fired!" #TRUMP for President. USA!!
25 | Kings Gunners | 12 | 10155546214236509_1761681740748082 | What's your legacy Obama? Blacks have been more prosecuted under your watch. Or is it the terrorist that kill Innocent people and you failed to mention them as terrorists?

JUST IN: Police have captured the man sought after the ambush-style killings of 2 Iowa police officers
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Richard Stout | 511 | 10155546128101509_10155546132746509 | Captured alive🤔🤔They should've blown him up with the robot like they've done to others who kill law enforcement 🤔🤔🙄🙄But he was white so he can surrender peacefully after murdering 2 cops in cold blood 🙄🙄
2 | Femi J. Johnson | 344 | 10155546128101509_10155546135501509 | White on white crime,..this terrorist will be off the headlines & out of politics by tonight🙏🏿for the families
3 | George Thomas | 349 | 10155546128101509_10155546131826509 | So nice of them to capture this Trump supporter ALIVE. I wonder if they stopped and got him Burger King after.
4 | Charlie Brockington | 216 | 10155546128101509_10155546157696509 | glad they caught that muslim terrorist! or wait he was a mexican illegal immigrant, wait he was an inner city violent black man! oh wait he was just a random joe shmo white guy! my bad! carry on! no talkin point here!
5 | Katrina Young | 205 | 10155546128101509_10155546136411509 | Here is some irony for you. This guy was a confederate flag waving moron who despised people who protested against the national anthem and police brutality.
6 | Heather Jarrett | 159 | 10155546128101509_10155546135401509 | Disgusting. We're currently in a time in the US where it's common that police are killed, unarmed citizens are killed, wackjobs are running for president, and clowns are in our neighborhoods. I can't wait until 2017 because 2016 has been a strange year
7 | Jonathan Ogilvie | 170 | 10155546128101509_10155546139981509 | So - using the same rules the Trump folks use - every person who agrees and believes like this guy does is a terrorist.If every BLM protester is a terrorist because of the actions of a few - if every BLM protester is a cop killer because of the actions of an even tinier few...Then every white conservative confederate-flag lover is a terrorist. These are your rules, folks. Time to live by them. Don't like it, change your attitude. Until then, you believe like this guy, champion the same causes, you're a terrorist.Enjoy.
8 | Malcolm Xavier | 113 | 10155546128101509_10155546158966509 | White cop killer, what you racists gotta say now?? Yes white people are capable of capital murder and premeditated murder against police officers. I wonder if the cops will feel "threatened" next time they pull a white person over. I'm glad the killer was white just to prove that all races are capable of violence. White people kill too. Stop blaming us blacks for everything.
9 | Cl Rich | 86 | 10155546128101509_10155546143771509 | It's called an ambush when civilians do it, yet when police did it to a 12 year old child it was called justified??? Absolutely ridiculous. It all needs to stop. Gun reform and police accountability reform are needed. If we continue to do nothing, it will continue to escalate.
10 | Christopher Levy | 124 | 10155546128101509_10155546131886509 | I bet everyone thought and expected it was gonna be a black guy.
11 | Mike Boucher | 75 | 10155546128101509_10155546160671509 | White guy wanted for killing TWO cops, taken alive. Black man reaches for ID, shot dead in front of his child. This is the story that distracts you from the government corruption
12 | Jalen Foster | 51 | 10155546128101509_10155546188981509 | Just so y'all know. This right here is EXACTLY what black people are talking about. This is why Colin Kaepernik is doing what he's doing. This is why #BlackLivesMatter exists. This is why when a black person is killed by police officers, black people are outraged.This dude KILLED, MURDERED, 2 cops. The headline?? "Suspect in Custody". He was arrested after he had killed 2 police officers. I would call him a serious threat wouldn't you?? Yet, you see a black teen or grown man trying to run away or selling CDs/cigarettes he gets 10 slugs in the back??
13 | Ted Bennett | 46 | 10155546128101509_10155546204291509 | so, I was on the original article and people said "we all know who is responsible" and "thanks BLM!"So, where are ya now?  *crickets*Shocker that he got taken alive.You're more worried about phantom threats than the things that are actually destroying your Country.Thoughts to the families of the fallen Officers.
14 | Terrence Alexander | 23 | 10155546128101509_10155546201631509 | Where's the outrage (from Trump) about this homegrown Caucasian terrorist (waiting for the mental health excuse)that murdered 2 cops?If he was Muslim,minority or illegal Trump and his surrogates would have been all over the place talking about ISIS,inner city criminals or illegal immigrants.R.I.P. to the murdered cops and prayers go out to their loved ones.Again more blood on the hands of the NRA this time the blood of 2 cops.
15 | Raymond Perez | 36 | 10155546128101509_10155546164406509 | What is the media going to call him? Terrorist?Radical White Terrorism?But of course, like every attack that is done by a white person. To the media, he just has mental problems.
16 | Caitlin Hawkins | 28 | 10155546128101509_10155546218291509 | If this guy was black he would have been shot on the spot, and for people to think Donald Trump is going to support blacks, that's a HUGE lie. He's going to protect law enforcement and bring back " law and order" , as he said in the debate. Nothing will change with him in office.
17 | Ford N Pierre | 42 | 10155546128101509_10155546131211509 | R.i.p officers 🙏 ill pray pray for the families infected by this tragedy Earlier Y'all was saying it's a black person that did It rush to judgment shame
18 | Bakari Wright | 23 | 10155546128101509_10155546209881509 | Fact: He's been captured alive so now the media will promote his background, likes, favorite foods, family, past history, etc.
19 | Jeremy Wright | 16 | 10155546128101509_10155546251841509 | Look, we shouldn't be surprised here. For generations white people have had the same mentality. "Give us our way or we will murder you." This guy was escorted out of a stadium for antagonizing and harassing black people so he got mad and targeted police officers. That's called terrorism and it's not new to the European way of doing things.
20 | Mary Janee | 20 | 10155546128101509_10155546146701509 | In custody but an unarmed black man dead hands up dead ! Sorry POS should of shot him dead color doesn't matter in reality people are sick never know whats going on in there sick mind
21 | Runmy Fade | 10 | 10155546128101509_10155546212496509 | Let's take a moment and 🙏🏾 for the families of the recently departed. Now let's 👏🏾 that the killer wasn't black. Last but not least, let's get 😡  because we all know how this would have ended if he weren't white.
22 | August Relf | 7 | 10155546128101509_10155546297561509 | Check the last article they posted about this and read all the black bashing racist idiots talk about "BLM", "thugs" and "black on black crime" now I have a question......How do you feel now? The time spent stepping on eggshells ends now it's time to call America what it is, a nation born of hate and terror can only be called one thing HELL!!!
23 | Cubie Hullum | 3 | 10155546128101509_10155546213216509 | While they looking at black communities for cop killing. They should be worried about these white men that also recognize what is happening in our country. There rights are being stolen and replaced with thug police who really think no one will fight back..the fight will come from white Society...because they will not be treated like the blacks are treated in this country.
24 | Keith Kittrelle | 4 | 10155546128101509_10155546227006509 | The cops in Iowa probably called the Charleston cops Burger King meal for the church murderer and raised them a Ruth Chris steak dinner for the Iowa cop killer! #justagameofpokertothem!
25 | Serge Mikhaleff | 3 | 10155546128101509_10155546366441509 | Another Christian terrorist. After the militia group called "The Crusaders". Their ancestors should have been vetted more carefully before letting them into the country.

1 | Andrew Najda | 890 | 10155545913781509_10155545921551509 | Hey CNN,Why dont you instead report on Peter Kadzik, a high ranking DOJ official giving Hillary Clinton a heads up about upcoming events related to the Clinton email case.To which John Podesta responds: Additional chances for mischief.Kadzik was also a dinner guest of Podesta and his wife, Mary, on Oct. 23, 2015.So not only is Loretta Lynch compromised, but also her right hand. https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/43150
2 | Roland Manny | 603 | 10155545913781509_10155545921571509 | CNN loves to put out fake news!.. let's start with CNN and the rest of alphabets medias.
3 | Beverly Ann | 751 | 10155545913781509_10155545922291509 | Suck a slong CNN. You're the most biased lying rag of a news source out there. You're going down with Killery for you role in getting her the debate questions and answers. I can't wait until Trump takes office and denies you any interviews!
4 | Jacob L. Wilkerson | 328 | 10155545913781509_10155545941371509 | you're washed up cnn.. people are going other places because they don't trust you anymore. and after the elections, your ratings will show it, trust me
5 | Han Sohlo | 263 | 10155545913781509_10155545944696509 | They don't call it the Clinton News Network for nothing! How about all the fabricated fake news against Trump, like saying that he has ties to Russia, when in fact the Clinton Foundation is the one that received a "donation" from them. Why doesn't CNN say anything about that?
6 | Tammy Lynn | 184 | 10155545913781509_10155545936151509 | As opposed to the fake news spread by the mainstream media? If we could trust the msm these little 'fringe' sites would hold no water. they might post some bs info, but if you're smart enough to see through that you will find real legit info as well.
7 | Donna Campos | 173 | 10155545913781509_10155545961191509 | Now this is funny!!! CNN wants to tell us about lies in the Media?!?! Hannity has CNN beat, in accuracy, when it comes to Fact-Checking! hahaha You have got to be kidding me - Do some real reporting (if possible) on the Clinton Corruption that are all backed up with facts.
8 | Dave Weaver | 154 | 10155545913781509_10155545943606509 | CNN Clinton News Network is a fake news media bought and paid for by the DNC.Wonder where you will be working in a couple of weeks?
9 | Bill Right | 129 | 10155545913781509_10155545935206509 | I would trust PeeWee Herman sitting behind me in a movie theater while out on a date with O J Simpson, drinking at Bill Cosby's bar with Flint Michigan ice cubes, all while Casey Anthony babysits for me before I would trust HER to walk my dog!!!
10 | Mitch Cox | 64 | 10155545913781509_10155546004701509 | My timeline is filled with trumptards posting fake news stories and not only believing them to be true but getting furious over some of them! And the thing is that it's sooo obvious that they're fake but since it fits their agenda they automatically believe it. Which is one reason why there are so many right winged extremist nut jobs running around. You can literally make them believe ANYTHING!!
11 | John Lair | 46 | 10155545913781509_10155545951746509 | CNN spreads the most fake stories while ignoring real ones. Bill Clinton denies calling Obamacare crazy; CNN ignores it; where's the reality check?
12 | Larry Reeves Underwood | 44 | 10155545913781509_10155545951326509 | Anything to take the attention off your creating news before it happens. Pathetic excuse of a news story. The main difference is he thought he was doing the right thing. CNN decided to cheat and rig the system.
13 | Toby Bee | 39 | 10155545913781509_10155545959416509 | Why don't you people report on the Hillary scandals.....You avoid all of them and continue to promote the most dishonest candidate in American history- Hell No Hillary !
14 | Jon Fryett | 30 | 10155545913781509_10155546034391509 | CNN is the King of fake stories....you have no room to talk. Some of the Dem wackos are saying Comey, Trump, and Russia are rigging the election. When the tables turn on the Dems, they go into ultra-Lying mode. Hurry....they need a Trump distraction to pull it off.  What can they make up next....the Dems/Clinton campaign? They are getting desperate folks. Hillary, her campaign, and Foundation are all based on lies and corruption. Who wants a leader with all this excessive baggage from day one? I sure don't.....she didn't get my vote thank God.
15 | Sandy Hafenbrack | 20 | 10155545913781509_10155546065011509 | The real problem is that viewers and listeners of people like Hannity and Limbaugh hear this fake news crap and take it as gospel then base their vote on all these lies and misinformation. They don't hear the retraction or if they do they won't even believe it. Misinformed voters is what will cause the fall of us as a country and society not Hillary's emails.
16 | Leland Moulton | 47 | 10155545913781509_10155545930426509 | CNN LYING Bias MEDIA It's called political correctness and it's been used to rob a nation blind, Trump broke through because he's been in the spotlight for decades and knows their game, he told you this in the beginning, the media had been used as a tool to destroy the character of anyone who challenged this juggernaut, now it's time for payback
17 | Evan Dickens | 17 | 10155545913781509_10155545994816509 | Umm, Michelle Obama did delete all tweets since 2013. Go look on twitter. Still deleted. Also, @michelleobama doesn't currently follow @hillaryclinton. Are y'all pitching this whole thing as fake? Someone at CNN was told to make this story and make it quick.
18 | Felix Atene | 12 | 10155545913781509_10155546021836509 | But that's a typical Republican tactic, say something inflammatory and after a day or two apologize mockingly. Release unsubstantiated news then, again, wait a few days and apologize with a big grin on their face.
19 | Michael Jerson | 18 | 10155545913781509_10155545979826509 | So if CNN covered both the good and bad of both candidates in a fair and balanced way, neither side would have to look elsewhere for real news. Funny how that works CNN....
20 | Neva Tapia | 11 | 10155545913781509_10155546020506509 | CNN, how dare you do your job and report the FACTS to us!! Trump supporters don't believe facts and everyone on here nagging CNN as being "fake" OBVIOUSLY didn't read the article!! Imagine that!! Sean Hannity himself corrected himself and apologized, but I'm definitely not surprised that Trump supporters believe anything that isn't on Fox News!!
21 | Victor Lawless | 10 | 10155545913781509_10155546032646509 | The only reason I even have a CNN newsfeed on facebook is to monitor the extreme bias your news service cannot seem to stay away from. You people spend more time with your lopsided 'reporting' for the benefit of a left wing liberal ideology then you do for the objective truth. CNN is as addicted to bias as a crackhead is to crack!  Sean Hannity is not even a reporter, he's a talk show host. Rather than focusing on a subject who is obviously diametrically opposed to CNN/s world view , why not do your jobs and investigate the allegations concerning the two candidates running for the office of president of the United States? At least half the people in this nation think Hillary Clinton is a criminal, now why is it CNN doesn't know why?
22 | Steve Balayewich | 10 | 10155545913781509_10155546061126509 | Cnn so busy trying to cover up the news they dont actually cover it any more.  Shame we have to rely on groups like wiki leaks and anonymous to drag the news out into the light. Main stream media bought and paid for. R.I.P. journalism
23 | Amy Flores | 13 | 10155545913781509_689426621223513 | Attention Trump voters: Whether Trump wins or loses. We will NEVER watch CNN on tv or visit their website again. You behaved like pure biased trash this election season. Let's cause a ratings nightmare for the Clinton News Network. You're done.
24 | David Gleason | 3 | 10155545913781509_689425451223630 | Well you can't blame him; it's hard to keep up with all the lies, rumors, and conspiracy theories conservatives have been heaping on Hillary for the past couple of decades. #imwithher
25 | Joe Covert | 4 | 10155545913781509_10155546010761509 | For all the anger towards CNN, there are an awful lot of people commenting. Quit giving the illusion that facts are in dispute simply because you don't believe them. #ReadABook

Stop fighting each other.  One is a lifelong politician, and the other is a lifelong jerk.

7 | Amy Gold | 17 | 10155545638336509_10155545676656509 | Sad story, but CNN is ungenuine. They look for stories like this in order to throw under the rug reporting on the extreme increase of the OBAMA-CLINTON CARE SCAM, or the FBI criminal investigation on clinton. Don't be a baby
8 | Sharon Allen | 1 | 10155545638336509_10155547392726509 | This country really has some crazies I'd venture to say more than half    are out of their minds!

Ice levels at the North Pole have shrunk to their second-lowest level ever, scientists say -- and there could be worse to come http://cnn.it/2fdyNYq
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Dennis Kraft | 163 | 10155545540581509_10155545634926509 | These comments are so disturbing. Wake up people. We are causing the earth to heat up, the ocean levels to rise, and it's going to be catastrophic. Unfortunately those of you who deny facts (and the rest of us too) will fall victim to this when its too late.
2 | Justin Mussel | 192 | 10155545540581509_10155545582991509 | You know what else is shrinking CNN , your ratings. The Clinton news network doesn't know how to report news that matters
3 | Michael Crouse | 48 | 10155545540581509_10155545572881509 | Ice levels...Cavemen virus... Alien Invasions ... COM'ON MAN !!! America is tired of this hug a tree mentality. Put up an article that everyone can get behind and can learn how to realistically help our environment. Not all of us live in the North Pole like CNN.
4 | Lisa Lisa | 43 | 10155545540581509_10155545610131509 | It's amazing the same people keep complaining about CNN and what they reporting !! And yet they are all still here !! If they hated CNN this much ? Why are you still here ? Why not just unfollow them and find another news station to harass ?  Just my opinion folks !! Have a good day !!
5 | Craig Osborne | 33 | 10155545540581509_10155545576026509 | Let's ignore immediate threats to our survival! Like Muslims spreading like a cancer across the globe, like Iran with a nuclear weapon, like Russia and China strengthening their country's while we are teaching our kids to be politically correct, gender neutral safe spacers. Like isis growing and spreading. And let's focus on hypothetical things like global warming, which may kill us in 5000 years? Yes that seems logical. Good job CNN!!!!!
6 | Rico Marquez Naje | 28 | 10155545540581509_10155545550836509 | Stop feeding us with Democrat lies... and my PAPAs hairline had shrunk to their second lowest ever is more credible than ICE that in reality is continue to build up
7 | Tom Thompson | 13 | 10155545540581509_10155545587056509 | Every summer the trees reduce the overall CO2 concentration. If the planet heats up there will be more trees consuming more CO2 which will eventually lead to a reduced level of CO2 which will lead to planet cooling. Natures balance.
8 | Patrick Federice | 8 | 10155545540581509_10155545655961509 | I just had a deep conversation with my neighbor's dog who happens to be a leading  scientist on global warming, and he agrees with Leo it's the #1 issue threatening the world.  I believe that alien abduction is the #1 threat.
9 | Evie Howard | 18 | 10155545540581509_10155545628561509 | This is disturbing news, some want to deny the fact there is major changes happening in our world we live, but digging your head in the sand is not going to fix nor cure anything!  Global warming is here and apparently going at a faster rate then expected....lets pray its not too late to fix this problem and heal our planet!
10 | Amber Krystan Browning | 15 | 10155545540581509_10155545585351509 | 👌its all a hoax people👌 A Chinese lie 😂 Can't wait for Donald Doof to fade away after this election like the ice caps are now....
11 | Amreena Qureshi | 6 | 10155545540581509_10155545876756509 | What we have done to the planet as humans is absolutely criminal. But the amount of damage that just the United States is causing is more then criminal, these corrupt politicians, big business men, the Koch brothers and others like him deserve the death penalty. They know our planet is dying, but because of corporate greed and financial increase they are pretending like it doesn't even exist.
12 | Caleb Notz | 7 | 10155545540581509_10155545671386509 | All while the ice at the south poll has been growing and this is a natural cycle. I for one don't deny humans impact on the Earth, however I do question those who jump to conclusions just to get a reaction out of the public. Every time they talk about the climate changing they only talk about the last 20k years... Why is that? Well if you go back further the data starts to work against them. This is a natural cycle the Earth goes thro every 120k years as the Earth tilt angle changes. Remember folks, when they say most scientist agree on the data, most scientist at a time also used to think the Earth was flat and the center of the universe...*edit-phone can't spell lol *
13 | Esteban Perez | 3 | 10155545540581509_10155545703306509 | Stop misleading  people into thinking we are at fault for climate change!! Little do people know this is an unstoppable earth event that will eventually happen whether we  want it or not.
14 | Ralph J Kirkhart Jr | 0 | 10155545540581509_10155547187661509 | Even if I was to be inclined to by into this theory. There is nothing anyone can do to stop it! For any Man to assume that he can act as GOD and control the planet, or affect the weather in any type of massive and controlled way is crazy! (Also I know of the Governments attempts to make weather weapons)
15 | Genoveva de Brabante | 0 | 10155545540581509_10155547436306509 | Me entristece, pero hay que hacer algo ya, vean el programa de geográfic que hizo Leo di Caprio, se quedarán espantados, la gente joven, los niños sus nietos sufrirán las consecuencias del calentamiento global, se pueden tomar medidas, tasar impuestos para las enormes empresas mil cosas, sino empezamos ya pero ya!!!  No vamos más ehh ojoo!
16 | James Wood | 1 | 10155545540581509_10155546661906509 | This is a conspiracy to let facts and science 🔬 sway you from the fact that we live in end times where we should mandate prayer in schools at gunpoint cuz both the students and teachers should always be armed and we need to build a wall on our northern border to keep Australians from coming here illegally and paying the Chinese to build our plastic bags cheaper than we can frack the oil under native graveyards than the rapist Norwegians who want to outsource our Casinos to India. Trump will put a gold toilette in every outhouse! God bless the pointy white headed Americans only. Love Doug.
17 | Charles Duane Tharp | 0 | 10155545540581509_10155546308361509 | BS. It's a natural geological cycle. The earths rotation (wobbling) on its axis changes each year therefore the Northern tip spends more time in the da creating a warmer climate. It's expected. Anyone whose studied nautical navigation is aware of this. And also the earth is closest to the Sun in the winter. How's that for a science lesson.
18 | Jeanette Engelhardt Nohawitz | 1 | 10155545540581509_10155546856516509 | History shows Ice ages, Hot glowing white gasses, Volcano's, the earth is 4 to 5 billion years old, I think it is people not the earth that is disturbing right now and the worse may be yet to come.,,,. Other civilized cultures have vanished from the earth but the earth itself is still alive and well.
19 | Kendall Turnage | 1 | 10155545540581509_10155546140566509 | One super volcano or meteorite impact could happen tommorrow, block the sun and have everyone freezing at anytime. Quit being ridiculous. I admit we are influencing it but climate change is always happening folks. Sea levels have risen hundreds of feet hundreds of times in geological history.
20 | Jennifer DeKenipp | 0 | 10155545540581509_10155545962316509 | I love how ignorant people can be saying global warming is Democratic lies..hello it doesn't take a genius to see or feel the changes in weather conditions it's real people wake up we are and have been destroying the earth for quite some time and to the idiot that said it will happen hypothetically in 5000 years..really?!
21 | Edward Priebe | 0 | 10155545540581509_10155545619831509 | Science has been wrong so many times in the past and they are still doing more harm than good so let's get ride of science and see if the ice returns. My bet is the world banned chemicals our gov is using to sell their climate change business is building up in our water just like our soil and pretty soon they are going to change the freezing temp of water to An actual neg temp instead of 32 deg.
22 | Mike Medeiros | 0 | 10155545540581509_10155547405781509 | Please, don't listen to these climate alarmists. They're taking advantage of your ignorance of climatology and making you believe a lie. Any reporting on "climate change" is politically motivated, and everyone knows it
23 | Alex San | 0 | 10155545540581509_10155545796871509 | You could be a denying Republican paid by fossil fuel to deny man made climate change or listen to scientific evidence about man made climate change. It's not a political side noone wins if we cause destruction to our only planet.
24 | Joseph Kimrey | 1 | 10155545540581509_10155545598711509 | If we have constant video record of our planet, why not show us time lapse video, instead of truncating animation?When police want to prove their case, they present video evidence...not animation of their claims.
25 | Ed Ayala | 1 | 10155545540581509_10155546835876509 | And no one has been here long enough to see if this is a naturel cycle. All you idiots crying that the sky is falling please sell your cars and stop using natural gas at home, stop using electricity and............what? Too much? Then please STFU!

"Dude, you live in a tower with your name on it in gold," Stewart said about Donald J. Trump's claims that the system is rigged against him. "How well would you be doing if the man wasn't keeping you down?"
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Robert Vaz | 1061 | 10155545453316509_10155545457991509 | The joke is on the people that think a billionaire is going to be their champion

3 | Ken Barkhuff | 1516 | 10155545453316509_10155545469371509 | Trump has never said the man was keeping him down. He's said the election is rigged, and he's right. Numerous cases of voter fraud in Tx, Fl and Oh. And when did John Stewart become a political "science" study?
4 | Jim Gavin | 563 | 10155545453316509_10155545458396509 | This is unbelievable. Americans should be outraged that the media and Hiliary have taken away one of our most important fundamental rights The right to vote. By Hiliary accepting these questions she has rigged the election and should immediately be disqualified. FORGET WHO GAVE HER THE QUESTIONS..SHE TOOK THEM IS THE ISSUE.

You had someone who worked for you that gave debate questions to Clinton, and have showed nothing but one sided propaganda. The American public deserves more from their media. We don't have to like Trump to see how much BS you feed us. The real loser is the American people who deserve to be told the truth.
11 | Andrea Diaz | 29 | 10155545453316509_552460431624018 | A billionaire, who never gave a dime to anyone else, never had to struggle, had 3 wives, and demeans women, thinks all black people are struggling, thinks all mexicans are bad rapists although he said he'd grab a womans pussy and kiss them because he's rich, thinks all muslims should be monitored or forced to leave when aside from 9/11 some of the biggest mass shootings were done by white male Americans, can't control his twitter fingers in a proffessional manner why trust him with the big red button?, his son compared Syrian refugees to skittles, his dad had possible connection with the KKK who also endorse him. And y'all complaining about some illegitimate emails... and believe he's best to run the country with no experience and doing things like that.. yeah no.
12 | Jacob Fassold | 51 | 10155545453316509_10155545475136509 | Jon Stewart does not understand. The system is rigged and the definition of electoral college vote should be easily questioned, a felon running for office is proof, the FBI bending laws to fit a candidate like Hillary is proof it's rigged, the White House is for sale and it's been proven.
13 | Fred Wallick | 22 | 10155545453316509_1098893533559376 | I have to laugh at those Trump supporters who do NOT care about ANYTHING with regards to Trump, but THINK they are so very well versed on Hillary Clinton. Its really quite funny! LMAO..!
14 | John Roscoe | 11 | 10155545453316509_10155545497476509 | Though I am not a Trump supporter, and fully acknowledge that Trump is putting on a petulant child act, Stewart here is purposely being naive and ignorant simply to bolster his own position. The context in which Trump alleges that things are rigged against him is a purely political system context. Stewart of course knows this, but purposely warps it because he's just another one of those comedians who decided all the money is in putting on the "I'm a witty Liberal comedian" routine. I'm nominally a Democrat, but this crap gets on my nerves. Him, Samantha Bee, their ilk. Be a comedian or be a pundit. Don't put on a false act of being both just to pander, when anyone with half a brain knows it's nothing but an act and their true convictions are unknown.
15 | Matthew Snyder | 24 | 10155545453316509_10155545479776509 | What does Trump's living situation have to do with democrats colluding with mainstream media outlets, hiring people to incite violence at GOP events, and committ voter fraud?
16 | Sean Boyles | 20 | 10155545453316509_10155545485851509 | Political system being rigged and the business system being rigged are 2 completely different things.

18 | Donna Campos | 16 | 10155545453316509_10155545506606509 | This idiot has been extraordinarily successful at fooling a lot of people with his antics. He is a master manipulator, a liberal political hack who has done very well at spreading his garbage. People willing put their brains to sleep as he influences their political views towards liberalism, and pretty much lowering their IQ in regards to all things political. The "Daily Show has nothing more than a "low-information" audience.
19 | Sam J Marquez | 14 | 10155545453316509_552448431625218 | The American people are on to this garbage it's disgusting. Drain the swamp already especially with these celebrities who are showing their true faces... it's the little people that made them rich and successful
20 | Bern P Haines | 7 | 10155545453316509_682731048560868 | Some people like John epitomises the reasons why Americans are not like the rest of  us, we don't accept this kind of barbaric elections and this means as the superpower is over soon our world takes a bad turn. Vote Hillary Clinton and we all go down.
21 | Christos Terzan | 16 | 10155545453316509_10155545510081509 | CNN shame, shame, shame. Who's rats are jumping ship and pleading the fifth? Report on NEWS, please.Loretta Lynch, Clintons IT people, see that wasn't hard, I'm not even a journalist. Just a hard working Ex-Felon lower class auto mechanic trying to find truth amongst all the mud slinging on both sides. I broke the law and paid the price, now give me some real news and maybe your credibility can be restored, until then, pull down your skirt, your bias is showing.
22 | Louis Barraco | 7 | 10155545453316509_10155545556416509 | This came from the Advocate (our local paper) and I am sharing it because it is exactly how most of us feel about Trump.  The Media just doesn't get it....they can't believe that people are so angry that they can no longer be manipulated!Millions of trump supporters feel this way about Donald J. Trump....."We don't care if the guy swears... or how many times he's been married...or who he voted for, or what his income tax return shows. We want the problems fixed. Yes he's an egomaniac, but we don't care. We know he's not a racist, or bad to women, or all the other things the liberal media is trying to label him with. We know he's raised a good family, and that says a lot about him.The country is a mess because politicians suck, the Republican Party is two faced & gutless, and illegals are everywhere and Muslims are openly trying to hurt this country and make the civilized world adjust to them. We want it all fixed!We don't care that Trump is crude, we don't care that he has changed positions, we don't care that he fights with Megan Kelly, Rosie O'Donnell, and so many of the elected establishment. We don't care that Rubio, Ryan, the Bush's, and so many other top old and new Republicans refuse to endorse him for their own selfish reasons, and we know what they are. We don't care that he doesn't know the name of some Muslim terrorists, we don't care that he tried some businesses that didn't work out.This country is weak, bankrupt, our enemies are making fun of us, we are being invaded by illegals, we are becoming a nation of victims, where every Tom, Ricardo and Hasid is a special group with special rights to a point where we don't even recognize the country we were born and raised in, AND WE JUST WANT IT FIXED. And TRUMP is the only guy who seems to understand what the people want.We're sick of politicians, sick of the Democratic and Republican Party. We're angry about the Iran deal, the budget, treatment of Israel, military weakness, lobbyists, special interests, overpaid politicians with their self serving bills and back room deals, trade deals, loss of jobs, manipulated economic numbers, businesses fleeing, and even the phoney pay for play Clinton Foundation.Americans are no longer going to be fooled, and the movement is out to change the direction we're taking. Trump may not be a saint, but he doesn't have lobbyist money holding him, he doesn't have political correctness restraining him, and all you know is that he has been very successful, a good negotiator, he has built a lot of things, he's flexible, and he's also not a politician. And he says he'll fix it. And we believe him because he is too much of an egotist to be proven wrong or looked at and called a liar.Public service has become elected greed. This may be our only chance to have a non-politician, despite his flaws, try and correct the mess, at least for 4 years. We must take the shot, because the consequences of putting Hillary Clinton in office are frightening. There is a tidal wave happening, and its going to overcome much of what's happened to this country."
