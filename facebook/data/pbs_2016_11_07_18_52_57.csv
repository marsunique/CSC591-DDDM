What are exit polls, and how do they help to project a winner before the final vote comes in? To help explain what these stats mean on election night and to examine the current predictions, Judy Woodruff speaks with NPR‚Äôs Domenico Montanaro.

Conversations with voters at Trump and Clinton campaign stops underscored just how divided and angry many voters feel as the election comes to its merciful end.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Kevin O'Day | 35 | 10154742006008675_10154742175813675 | Speaking of draining the swamp and why there is so much hatred and fear, it should not be lost on voters as to which party wants campaign finance reform and to overturn Citizen's United and which party generally likes our campaign and electoral process just the way it is (or longer, costlier and uglier if possible)..  vote blue.
2 | Renzo Palma | 27 | 10154742006008675_10154742196728675 | There's nothing wrong with fearing hatred; it's natural, it's survival. On the other hand worshipping hatred is wrong; it's tribalistic, it's barbaric. Trump and the Republican extremists called the "Alt-Right" are the "Global Warming" of "Global Xenophobia". We can no longer be in denial of the rise of bigoted political factions; no longer be in denial of the outbreak of militant White Nationalists; no longer ignore a cancer of racism metastasized in a tumor called Trump. And we must attend to this civic blight. The treatment for this condition is voting blue. #Imwithher
3 | Kirsten Baxter | 12 | 10154742006008675_10154742205698675 | Fear is rational.  Hatred isn't rational.  The things that come out of Trump's mouth, and the mouths of far too many of his supporters, are terrifying.  Hatred is vile, and it has no business being the motivation behind how we run this country.
4 | Michelle Vancil-Osborne | 5 | 10154742006008675_10154742215618675 | I'm going straight home tomorrow after work, bypassing my stop at my local YMCA for a much needed, stress reducing swim, to be safely tucked away from the anger and hatred that have engulfed my community.  I voted, but feel afraid to say to any of my neighbors that I supported Hillary Clinton in fear of retaliation.
5 | Randi Eitzman | 1 | 10154742006008675_10154742205428675 | This is the deal I've offered (SHARE):So, how about all the "hesitant Clinton" and "hesitant Trump" voters just get together and agree to both dump their party and vote for Johnson together. As for the dedicated party voters, carry on. üëçüèª Nothing to see here.
6 | Brian Norberg | 4 | 10154742006008675_10154742178188675 | Hillary Clinton and the DNC have set us up for a decade of lame Republican rule and continued gridlock.  Because of her hubris HRC has forced her way into the nomination this year and if she wins she will remain unpopular on the right and the left.  In the 2018 midterms Democrats are faced with an raft full of Senate races they have to defend.  Meaning they will most likely lose the Senate.  And  in 2020(assuming HRC wins tomorrow) Hillary Clinton will try and get a second term. Which if this election is any indication she will lose.  Not only will she lose but I would bet she will lose to someone like Paul Ryan.  Which will give the Republicans the House, the Senate and the Whitehouse.  And this will happen right after the next census insuring massive gerrymandering by the Republicans.  So to those of us on the left.  If you want any chance of significant change you had better get it out of Hillary in the next two years.  Because after that you are SOL.  That is why the left must stay mobilized.  If we want any change we have to push for it starting November 9th.  That is why we have to push even when we think we will lose.
7 | Bkak Jones | 1 | 10154742006008675_10154742215843675 | If Trump wins, it will be because voters have resigned to the bigotry and ignorance of the worst of us. I am volunteering in every way I can to make sure voters come out and reject Donald Trump.
8 | Carol Junco | 0 | 10154742006008675_10154742271233675 | Sometimes I look up and think I have somehow been transported back into the time of lynchings, police dog attacks, and open hate speech. I thought those days were behind us, but here we are, back at Square 1.
9 | Bryan Chris | 7 | 10154742006008675_10154742190398675 | ‚ÄúFear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.‚ÄùEven Yoda knows they're equally bad. The trump supporters are just one step further along.It's too bad we rolled over and accepted the theft of the nomination of the one candidate who offered more than fear and hate.
10 | Kristy Webb Lalonde | 0 | 10154742006008675_10154742255108675 | CNN needs to be the first media outlet to go when they begin to drain the swamp. What nonsense. The hatred is from the democrats inciting violence by paying people to do it. Crazy....
11 | Rick Martinez | 1 | 10154742006008675_10154742240643675 | ‚ÄúNo tyranny finds support without tapping into our fears this is key. Hence, all tyranny is terrorist. And when this terror ‚Äî which was sown in the peripheries, with the massacres, looting, oppression and injustice ‚Äî explodes in centers with different forms of violence, even hateful and cowardly attacks, citizens who still retain some rights are tempted to the false security of physical or social walls. Walls that enclose some and banish others. Walled citizens, terrified on one side, excluded, exiled, and still more terrified on the other. Is that the life that our Father God wants for their children?" Pope Francis
12 | David Smith | 1 | 10154742006008675_10154742209918675 | Funny....the only hate I have seen is dems tearing down Trump signs and burning Trump election offices. The dems have been paying people to start fights at Trump rallies......PBS is blatantly nevertrump and part of the corrupt media machine.
13 | Debbie West | 0 | 10154742006008675_10154742230083675 | I'm sooo tired of the media brain washing from this campaign....but the awful truth is the media will be speculating on the 2020 election next week! Gaaaah!!!!!!!!!!!!
14 | Keith John Sampson | 10 | 10154742006008675_10154742177778675 | Tricky Dick Nixon had his Enemies List and that led his downfall. Dirty Don Trump has his Enemies List that includes his political opponents, and members of the Media. Nixon thought he was above the Constitution.  Trump does not even believe in the United States Constitution.
15 | Edward StJean | 0 | 10154742006008675_10154742271848675 | Bologna, I have friends who attended and they are trustworthy and said nothing of hate or aggression whatsoever Hillary supporters should be fearful of her corrupt policies, scandals and blatant display of her distaste for the American people; all she cares about is power and money
16 | Mera Molano Andrea Esthefania | 9 | 10154742006008675_10154742183958675 | Please keep in mind, ladies, a woman voting for the sexist and misogynist Donald J. Trump would be analogous to punching herself smack in the face. The suffragettes, who endured pain and humiliation in their horrendously difficult fight to get you the right to vote, would turn over in their graves if you cast a vote for this pathological lying demagogue. I'm sure that their souls are standing proud because finally our country has its first woman presidential candidate in Hillary R. Clinton. The time has been overdue to break the gender barrier.üéÄüíïüíï
17 | Edie Walker | 6 | 10154742006008675_10154742181308675 | I am upset that Americans can be for this man. Just dont get it.
18 | Pam Spettel | 1 | 10154742006008675_10154742196858675 | I don't think there is a merciful end in sight. We will wake up Wednesday with the same chasms we wake up with on Tuesday.
19 | Russell Wilson | 6 | 10154742006008675_10154742189323675 | Donald Trump scares my little sister. She's 10 years old.
20 | Dennis G. McAuliffe | 0 | 10154742006008675_10154742251983675 | Its been amusing watching trump clueless,  poorly educated supporters work so hard against their self interest, going to miss that.Donald Trump‚Äôs presidency would ‚Äúsignificantly‚Äù weaken the country, his tax cuts would add 9.5 Trillion to the debt,  driving the U.S. into a ‚Äúlengthy recession‚Äù with nearly 3.5 million job losses and a 7 percent unemployment rate, according to a Moody‚Äôs Analytics analysis.The tax code under Mr. Trump‚Äôs plan will be much less progressive than the current tax code. More than one-third of the proposed tax cuts on personal income will go to the top 1% of income earners, with the average taxpayer in this group receiving a reduction in their tax bill of $275,000. Taxpayers in the bottom 99% of income earners will receive a tax cut of less than $2,500.Under Trump's plan, the conservative Tax Foundation expects that the bottom 80 percent of Americans will see just 0.8 percent to 1.8 percent more income after his tax cuts. Clinton's plan will only increase taxes for America's wealthiest earners.The election of Donald Trump as President of the United States could lead to chaos in markets and increased policy uncertainty that tip the world into recession, according to Citigroup Inc."A Trump victory in particular could prolong and perhaps exacerbate policy uncertainty and deliver a shock (though perhaps short-lived) to financial markets," writes a team led by Chief Economist Willem Buiter. "Tightening financial conditions and further rises in uncertainty could trigger a significant slowdown in U.S., but also global growth."The large increase in tariffs on Chinese and Mexican imports supported by Mr. Trump further exacerbates inflation pressures. The U.S. imports nearly $500 billion in goods a year from China, and another almost $300 billion from Mexico, accounting for approximately 35% of total U.S. non-petroleum goods imports. Outside of Canada, no other country comes close as a source of imports. Slapping a 45% tariff on Chinese imports and 35% on non-petroleum Mexican imports thus increases overall goods import prices by approximately 15%.would most likely retaliate with in-kind tariffs on U.S. imports. This would be a big hit to U.S. exports, as we ship well over $100 billion in products a year to China, and almost $250 billion to Mexico.And the problem with trumps outspoken approach to Mexican immigration, his ‚Äúplan‚Äù to deport 11 million undocumented immigrants would shrink the economy by about 2 percent, according to American Action Forum (AAF), a conservative and pro-business think tank. The sudden subtraction of 7 million workers would cause an immediate shock to thousands of businesses, triggering a GDP collapse ranging from $400 billion to $600 billion in productionmajority of business economists in a new survey said Hillary Clinton is the best choice to oversee the U.S. economy as president.Her Republican rival, Donald Trump, didn‚Äôt even come in second.The National Association for Business Economics surveyed its members ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential election. Roughly 55% said Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic nominee, would do the best job of managing the economy.About 14% picked Mr. Trump‚Äîslightly less than the 15% who selected Libertarian presidential nominee Gary Johnson and the 15% who said they didn‚Äôt know or had no opinion. ( The figures didn‚Äôt add up to exactly 100% due to rounding.)Donald Trump casts himself as a protector of workers and jobs, but a USA TODAY NETWORK investigation found hundreds of people ‚Äì carpenters, dishwashers, painters, even his own lawyers ‚Äì who say he didn‚Äôt pay them for their work. And trump uses undocumented labor along with Chinese Steel over American for constructing his hotels and resorts !studies of psychological profiles of individual voters characterized by a desire for order and a fear of outsiders,  people who score high in authoritarianism, when they feel threatened, look for strong leaders who promise to take whatever action necessary to protect them from outsiders and prevent the changes they fear.A polling of a large sample of likely voters, looking for correlations between support for Trump and views that align with authoritarianism found that not onlyauthoritarianism correlated, but it predict support for Trump more reliably than virtually any other indicator.Authoritarians are thought to express much deeper fears than the rest of the electorate, to seek the imposition of order where they perceive dangerous change, and to desire a strong leader who will defeat those fears with force. They would thus seek a candidate who promised these things. And the extreme nature of authoritarians' fears, and of their desire to challenge threats with force, would lead them toward a candidate whose temperament was totally unlike anything we usually see in American politics ‚Äî and whose policies went far beyond the acceptable norms.

Americans head to the polls Tuesday to elect the 45th president of the United States. But there are several interesting races that have flown under the radar this year.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Sharon Pugh | 0 | 10154741913593675_10154742144088675 | The Indiana governor's race is not the only important race. Evan Bayh is trying to win a seat back in the Senate from a Tea Party Congressman, Todd Young. I think Gregg will carry the day because of the devisive religious legislation that Pence got through the legislature: RFRA and burial of aborted fetuses. Apparently the governor doesn't know his biology, but enough said of that matter. Evan Bayh has been attacked by every Republican pact that exists. I find it incongruous since Dan Coats is retiring from his 6 year term. Coats had been a lobbyist before returning to the Senate to do what Bayh is being sought to do by the Democrats. Neither of these men has lived in Indiana for decades. Don't worry. Most Hoosiers would rather not be confused by the facts. We used to have a rather intelligent electorate here, but all the educated seem to have left.

16 | Natalia Farber | 2 | 10154742051798675_10154742179073675 | Jessica, do long lines have access to water, shade etc? If not please tell folks what to bring to help them prepare.
17 | Beverly Jones | 18 | 10154742051798675_10154742070853675 | WHy aren't these rules universal thoughtout ALL 50 States?
18 | Andy Wones | 13 | 10154742051798675_10154742078563675 | King County Washington does it right - all mail in or drop off in ballot boxes.
19 | Anna Cortinas | 2 | 10154742051798675_10154742128828675 | I had a great early voting experience. Everyone was patient and friendly. Waited in line for two hours.
20 | Virginia Longoria | 2 | 10154742051798675_10154742208163675 | I will vote blue , üòÇüòâ if she doesn't win I will be sad because he will be divided the USA for sure Racies are alive and well üòûüò†üò≠
21 | Maria A Perez | 0 | 10154742051798675_10154742234653675 | We voted since November 2, love to do things in advance and avoid lines and unpleasant surprises. My husband and I, my 4 daughters and son voted earlier..........Democrats all the way.
22 | Randi Eitzman | 11 | 10154742051798675_10154742077448675 | PBS and Vice are the ONLY true media outlets left! ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è PBS!!

--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Dave Powers | 17 | 10154741971168675_10154742039483675 | #MyVotePBS this year and cycle is to do my part to STOP THE #DonaldTrump MADNESS! I am concerned about all of the talk on the right, and while I recognize that they have legitimate gripes, the choice that they "made" for a leader is completely unacceptable. The man is unfit, unprepared, and unready to be POTUS.
2 | Jacki Watkins | 27 | 10154741971168675_10154742027968675 | This is the 10th time I've voted in a Presidential election....I don't need motivation to vote...it's not just a right, it's not just a privilege, it is our duty as Americans to vote!!  #myVotePBS
3 | William H Boley | 10 | 10154741971168675_10154742039553675 | I'm voting to preserve our democracy, or what's left of it, from the divisiveness and hate that threatens to tear it apart. That's #MyVotePBS.
4 | Pamela Scully | 6 | 10154741971168675_10154742064413675 | Because I am outraged by the racism and misogyny and hatred for people exhibited by one of the candidates. And because we need again to believe in the state as a vehicle for making people's lives better. We have to find a way to make the US function better for everyone. And yes, It is our duty to vote given all that so many people have sacrificed reaching back at least as far as the era of Reconstruction. I think of Frederick Douglass, Sojourner Truth, Susan B Anthony, Ida B. Wells,  MLK, all the student heroes of the civil rights movement, the list goes on. We have to vote.
5 | Julia Morris | 13 | 10154741971168675_10154742045023675 | I am voting because Donald Trump is a Nazi monster who brought racism and hate in the campaign. He is truly dangerous and can never be in the Whtehouse. I want the GOps that created him to be voted out also. All the GOPs do is investigate and when they don't get what they want investigate Hillary again. It's shameful and they have wasted millions of our tax dollars.
6 | Robin Williams Collica | 10 | 10154741971168675_10154742047123675 | I vote in every election. Voting is my responsibility as a good citizen. I will be excited to cast my ballot for Hillary Clinton.
7 | Janine Nelson | 2 | 10154741971168675_10154742060463675 | As an American citizen, I have had the honor to vote since I turned 18. No matter where I have lived, I believe we can make changes through the ballot box. I do my research and have a decent understanding of economics. That said, I have to wonder why so many people vote to pay more money for fewer services or benefits. Don't get me wrong, I don't believe the government should control every aspect of my life. It goes too far sometimes.  But, It's my right and duty to make decisions based on facts that support our democracy and way of life.
8 | Betsy Walters | 2 | 10154741971168675_10154742081633675 | #myVotePBS I always vote; I feel it is my duty an a citizen. This year the lies from the alt right have finally metastasized into the ugliest scene I can remember. I feel passionate about this. These days I vote by mail so that I can relax a little rather than go crazy about the voting scene.
9 | Julie Rosenwinkel | 4 | 10154741971168675_10154742040918675 | Trying to make sure Hillary does not take us to war with Russia over Syria and hope whoever gets in stops giving Saudis and Qatar the funders of ISIS more weapons contracts.
10 | Tina Jordan Hughes | 7 | 10154741971168675_10154742065683675 | I always vote. This year my motivation is not wanting to wake up one day and find out we've entered World War III over a tweet.
11 | Sara DeLuca | 3 | 10154741971168675_10154742118823675 | A vote for Hillary is a vote for intelligence, experience, inclusion, human rights (yes, including women's rights), concern for the common good. This country can not afford the damaging alternative.
12 | Lourdes Diaz | 3 | 10154741971168675_10154742072563675 | I'm voting this year FOR Hillary Clinton, a capable, intelligent, hard-working woman) and AGAINST Donald Trump to show that ALL votes (Hispanics, Mexicans, Muslims, the disabled, women, African-Americans) matter when you want to be the President of the UNITED States. KARMA on November 8.
13 | Carol Conaway | 1 | 10154741971168675_10154742111603675 | This year, it's a fear of fascism.  Gerrymandering, voting restrictions and Citizens United have diluted the democratic process.  Now an authoritarian strongman, channeling the unfocused anger of a population that gleefully rejects all information that does garner the approval of their orange-faced God, has taken advantage of these weaknesses and has a possible path to the presidency.  Any person who would vote for someone whose own campaign cannot trust with a twitter account needs to seriously question his or her love of country.  If we put an impulsive, vindictive child in the Oval Office, we will all pay very dearly for many, many years to come.
14 | Daria Rackovitch Buchanan Kowal | 2 | 10154741971168675_10154742154888675 | This year I decided to due an absentee ballot because it was not going to be easy for me to get to the poles. Being that my Mom is 87 and my Dad will be 90 the day after the election I got them absentee ballots as well. I sat with bot of them and assisted them in filling out their ballots....... It was thrilling for me to watch my Mom be able to vote for a woman for President......... Even more exciting to see my Dad choose a woman to vote for for President !!!!!
15 | Kat Russell | 6 | 10154741971168675_10154742055023675 | I am a Climate Change voter. Hillary has an extensive plan to mitigate Climate Change, and to prepare for it since we will need to deal with it. Her infrastructure redevelopment plans will put people to work in alternative energy. So smart. We can't wait any longer.
16 | Fontaine Pearson | 5 | 10154741971168675_10154742071013675 | Platforms. Hillary Clinton has the platforms that I agree with it even though she is more hawkish that I am. I'm especially concerned about insurance and where this country is going economically. Donald Trump had no platforms I could agree with except term limits. Butthr bottom line for me is that I think he is profoundly dangerous.
17 | Erica Kough | 1 | 10154741971168675_10154742154063675 | Supreme Court to be more progressive, and to protect civil rights. Education, lower the cost of college and bring more funding into our schools. More clean energy jobs and environmental protection. Guess who I'm voting for, lol #myVotePBS I'm a 36 yr old married, white female, with some college, and school age kids.
18 | Ann Weymouth Dean | 1 | 10154741971168675_10154742181598675 | I've voted in every election since I was old enough. I've been a poll worker as well. I believe in democracy, in our country, in the future. And I am afraid of the divisive actions and words of the GOP.
19 | Lisa Nolan Lindsay | 3 | 10154741971168675_10154742036323675 | Because my parents raised me right! I voted last week. Thanks for the best political coverage, #MyVotePBS
20 | Elizabeth Scott | 2 | 10154741971168675_10154742151098675 | If you don't vote you can't complain about what is going on in government. Also to know that I am voting for a woman! Added bonus.. Finally, Donald Trump, really?
21 | Lori Cook | 3 | 10154741971168675_10154742078748675 | I always Vote in Presidential Elections. This has been the most negative and depressing election ever. Donald Trump is a pretty scary candidate. Starting his campaign out attacking Hispanics was awful. Then he really never offered many policy details of how he planned to accomplish the agenda he talked about. The complaining and talk of rigged media and elections just made him an even less attractive choice for President.
22 | Pam Spettel | 0 | 10154741971168675_10154742190988675 | Of the many things to be concerned about, I chose this to be my primary focus: We've become a nation that is OK with sending our kids to school or movie theater, our moms to the mall, and our friends and neighbors to work without the assurance they will return safely due to gun violence. This needs to be reversed before the complacency  grows deeper. #MyVotePBS
23 | Russ Williams | 2 | 10154741971168675_10154742073908675 | I am simply maintaining the charade. Clinton Inc., The DNC, and Mainstream Media (including PBS NewsHour https://www.facebook.com/wikileaks/photos/a.206387512729702.43344.108734602494994/1142868019081642/?type=3&theater ) have made a mockery of our democratic processes.  It is now proven, beyond any reasonable doubt, that PBS and other "news" corporations are nothing more than propagandists for the oligarchs and our personal votes are worthless. The entire American Political system is a fraudulent and corrupt sham. How do you people that purport to be "ethical journalists" look at yourselves in the mirror? I am ashamed for you.
24 | Jane Trigg | 0 | 10154741971168675_10154742271818675 | I'm voting because that's what I do every time I get a chance. My vote this year has special meaning to me, because I believe that my vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote to preserve and continue our nation's system of government.
25 | Kathleen Stordahl | 0 | 10154741971168675_10154742088918675 | Evidently, the whole world currently thinks of the U.S.A. as a financial institution....an institution that doles out MONEY. That is NOT what I think a country or nation is....I was born in 1949, long long ago...Seriously do NOT think "we" have a nation or country anymore.

A second Harvard men's athletic team has been rating female athletes' physical appearances for years, The Harvard Crimson reported.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Paula Kay Schmidt | 13 | 10154741845483675_10154741955833675 | hopefully this will be a wake up call for people. Your misogyny, racism, and criticism of people who are 'different' is no longer acceptable behavior. Get a life
2 | Kimberlee Oller McKinniss | 7 | 10154741845483675_10154742084893675 | It is so sad that so many see nothing wrong with this behavior.  Men judge women, woman judge me, boys judge girls, girl judge boys... really because one does it, it okay for others. It wrong , no matter who is doing it. And people wonder why college campus rape / sexual assult numbers continue to rise. It's all okay, until it's your daughter or son, or family members.  Sad, just sad.
3 | John Kaye | 2 | 10154741845483675_10154741945228675 | This is news! Harvard students judging others. Unheard of. Next the women are going to start judging men. I remember the good old days when Harvard was male only. Then they could judge those not attending, like Yalies. It was always fun judging them.
4 | Sj Lag | 4 | 10154741845483675_10154742026153675 | The Harvard Cross-country Team was using spread sheets with vile language to rate their fellow Cross-country athletes who were female. Accordingly to this article this has been going on for years. Fire the coaches that knew and allowed this abusive tactic to continue and cancel the rest of the season. Name the individuals who were responsible for taking part in this , sanction them. Time to clean up the Ivy League, send them home to Mom......
5 | Bill Christenson | 0 | 10154741845483675_10154742267873675 | This has been going on for years. It's what men do , woman may not like it but they do the same thing for years.  Playboy. Play girl. Chippendales ect all objectify men or women.

7 | Bryan Chris | 0 | 10154741845483675_10154742130963675 | People have been rating others on their looks since time immemorial. It happens on both sides of the gender fence and there are numerous websites devoted to it. It may not be the most civilized behaviour, but it's hardly news.
8 | Philip B Noreen | 6 | 10154741845483675_10154741998698675 | This is the culture that brought us a spoon feed pussy grabbing presidential embarrassment

11 | Jeffrey Kelley | 4 | 10154741845483675_10154741933408675 | So? Women rate people too. This isn't some big travesty. Its college aged people being college aged people.

ANY hacker worth his Salt most likely could disrupt an election, but the effort to do so would be Paramount, and just plain not worth it! It would take insiders to do so, all of which would have to be paid substantially and have secured exits from the USA standing by if they get caught. That would take some SERIOUS cash! And Russia clearly can not afford to squander their money on some other country's problems. - Get real...

Say goodby to our country and it's safety and more illegals taking jobs and more drugs and crime cuz she won't fix that. People who have guns will have less rights and less options. She is nothing but lies and evil. I learned more about Trump and he is actually a really nice guy, I was told it is like when an actor has a role he has to play, he is just playing his tough role, but when he is with people and family he very nice. He says thank you more than anyone I have ever heard. He truly does care about the direction our country has been going since Obama, and it isn't in a good way, and he wants to turn it around. With her, we are getting another 4 years of Obama and worse. And if you vote for anyone else, it is a vote for her. So, if you don't want Hillary, choose Trump, or we will get Hillary.

3 | Rebecca Laskey | 5 | 10154741593573675_10154741670898675 | DONALD TRUMP ANNOUNCEMENT ~ REGARDING THE NEWSWEEK REPORT:TRUMP IS A ‚ÄúHUGE‚Äù NATIONAL SECURITY RISK BECAUSE OF HIS BUSINESS, FINANCIAL AND PERSONAL TIES TO RUSSIA, CHINA, SAUDI ARABIA, IRAN, ETC‚Ä¶..In a stunning and damning expose just released, the truth behind the ties between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin are revealed, and American allies in Europe are growing increasingly concerned by Russian espionage and its interference in the U.S. election.A Friday Newsweek article by Kurt Eichenwald reveals the truth behind the Trump campaign and its ties to Russia‚Äôs President Vladimir Putin. It also shows the history behind Russia‚Äôs support of the Republican candidate through espionage and cyberattacks discovered by both U.S. and allied European intelligence agencies.According to Eichenwald, American allies are concerned about Russian interference in the U.S. election and that Donald Trump‚Äôs statements denying any collusion in recent cyberattacks have only encouraged Putin to become more aggressive in his espionage against Western countries. Eichenwald cites the input of government officials, law enforcement officers, and intelligence agencies in both the U.S. and Europe.According to information gained by Western allied intelligence sources, the Kremlin‚Äôs interference into the U.S. election is aimed more at crippling Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in revenge for what Putin felt was interference in Russian elections. Clinton‚Äôs statement in 2011, saying the Russian election was ‚Äúneither free nor fair‚Äú in regards to obvious cheating, has sent Putin into a rage and made him determined to destroy Clinton. Putin was also enticed by Trump‚Äôs compliments of his strength as a leader.Some of the information gained by Western intelligence sources reveal that Donald Trump has been surrounded by a number of advisers with ties to Putin or with financial and family ties to Russia. Former campaign manager Paul Manafort was forced to resign when it was revealed that he had ties to a pro-Russian Ukraine official. Carter Page, another former Trump adviser, is being investigated by U.S. and European intelligence agencies for engaging in back-channel discussions with Russian officials. Intelligence has also revealed that Trump adviser Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn is intimately tied to RT, a Russian news agency involved in distributing Russian propaganda.Donald Trump and his campaign have also been found to be spreading Russian propaganda. The Kremlin has been distributing misinformation as part of their normal activities via various networks, through both anonymous internet trolls, RT, and Sputnik, another propaganda news source. A manipulated document from one of the anonymous internet sources found itself being recited by Trump at a campaign rally. The campaign has also been spreading rumors from Sputnik, including a piece attacking Newsweek that was forwarded by Trump staff to a number of reporters in the U.S. with requests that those reporters pursue the false story.In accordance with his position as presidential nominee, U.S. intelligence agencies have briefed Trump about Russia‚Äôs attempts to influence the election, but Trump has persisted in publicly denying these serious allegations, calling them unreliable, and dismissing them as possibly being perpetrated by some ‚Äú400-pound guy sitting on their bed‚Äù or even a child.European officials have told Newsweek that Trump‚Äôs statements have alarmed our NATO partners, because Trump refuses to believe the intelligence briefings he received or simply doesn‚Äôt understand them. They are also convinced that Trump could be misleading the American people for reasons of his own.One British official said that members of the U.K. government who are fully aware of Russia‚Äôs interference find Trump‚Äôs response ‚Äúquite disturbing.‚Äù They‚Äôre concerned that should he be elected, Trump would ignore and dismiss his own and allied intelligence services.Western law enforcement and intelligence agencies say that the Russian hacking and disinformation campaign includes tens of thousands of people in Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Novosibirsk. They say there are also operations inside the United States, working from New York City, Miami, and Washington D.C., mainly using Russian immigrants, although other foreign nationals and American citizens are also involved. According to intelligence received, those involved are being paid via a Russian pension scheme. One U.S. official told Newsweek that evidence shows that many of the Americans and other foreign nationals involved are unaware that they are part of Russia‚Äôs propaganda machine.American intelligence is also aware that Russia used cyber espionage and propaganda to interfere with other elections in the West, including the German elections last month and the June Brexit vote in the U.K., the results of both of which weakened the ties between those countries and the EU and NATO.According to a European intelligence expert, Russia is releasing its disinformation to disrupt the U.S. election through WikiLeaks, but states that the ‚Äúpipeline‚Äù through which the information flows contains numerous steps and so many filters that it is likely that the WikiLeaks organization itself does not know the source of the information.Interestingly enough, despite the Russian president‚Äôs support of Donald Trump, at one point, support for the Republican nominee was halted due to his volatile and unstable nature. According to intelligence sources, the Kremlin backed off supporting Trump when he attacked the Kahn Gold Star family publicly. The Kremlin assumed that the nominee would be forced to withdraw from the race due to his psychological unfitness, so put the hacking campaign on hold. According to reports provided to Western intelligence sources, even Putin thought Trump was unfit to be president, despite the advantages to him of a Trump presidency.According to information provided to Western intelligence agencies, Putin is satisfied that his campaign of cyber espionage has turned the tide in his direction. Putin has told his associates that even if Clinton wins the White House, she will be too busy rectifying the chaos that his leaked misinformation has wrought to interfere with his plans in Syria, Ukraine, and elsewhere.European allies are particularly stunned by Donald Trump‚Äôs refusal to credit his own intelligence services, and British officials were particularly horrified when Trump dismissed the validity of those sources. According to one British official the most disturbing evidence of Trump‚Äôs negligence was during the third presidential debate. In rebuttal to Clinton‚Äôs accusation that he was encouraging Russian cyberattacks, Trump said that she had no idea where the cyberattacks were coming from.‚ÄòHillary, you have no idea‚Ä¶ Our country has no idea.‚ÄôAccording to Newsweek, all of our intelligence sources and those of our NATO allies know that Russia is behind the hacking. Although Trump has been briefed, he continues to dismiss the information. Eichenwald sums up the exposes with some chilling thoughts:‚ÄòShould the United States, the last remaining superpower, tilt its policies away from NATO to the benefit of Russia, the alliance between America and Western Europe could be transformed in unprecedented ways. And so, for perhaps the first time since World War II, countries in Western Europe fear that the American election, should Trump win, could trigger events that imperil their national security and do potentially irreparable harm to the alliances that have kept the continent safe for decades.‚ÄôTop Pentagon Commanders: We'll Quit if Trump is Elected:http://occupydemocrats.com/2016/05/11/top-pentagon-commanders-well-quit-trump-becomes-commander-chief-2/IF YOU CARE, SHARE!

No wrongdoing, No Charges, Case Closed.The Clinton Foundation is NOT under Investigation by the FBI.  However, the Trump Foundation is still under Investigation by the New York Attorney General for ‚ÄúPay to Play‚Äù and ‚ÄúSelf-Dealing‚Äù.There is an anti-Clinton faction in an FBI office that is suspected of releasing and leaking information in an attempt to get Donald Trump elected president.Stunning Report Finds Anti-Clinton FBI Agents Are Trying To Get Trump Elected PresidentThere is an anti-Clinton faction in an FBI office that is suspected of releasing and leaking information in an attempt to get Donald Trump elected president.Reuters reported:The new emails turned up as FBI investigators were examining electronic devices used by former Democratic Representative Anthony Weiner in connection with an alleged ‚Äúsexting‚Äù scandal. Weiner‚Äôs estranged wife, Huma Abedin, is a Clinton confidante.Two law enforcement sources familiar with the FBI‚Äôs New York Field Office, which initially discovered the emails, said a faction of investigators based in the office is known to be hostile to Hillary Clinton. A spokeswoman for the FBI‚Äôs New York office said she had no knowledge about this.Democratic Party sources said such a faction was likely responsible for a recent surge in media leaks on alleged details of an ongoing FBI investigation of the Clinton Foundation.The lasting scandal to come out of the 2016 election might be the FBI, not Hillary Clinton‚Äôs emails. It is clear that there is something amiss in the bureau. If Democrats win control of the Senate on Tuesday, it is almost certain that they will launch an investigation into the FBI‚Äôs investigation of Clinton.FBI agents could be violating the law in an attempt to use their public sector jobs to interfere in a presidential election. What the anti-Clinton faction of the FBI is engaging in is a threat to US democracy.A group of FBI agents who are hostile to Hillary Clinton are trying to undermine a presidential election. That sentence reads like the plot to a Hollywood blockbuster, but that is what appears to be happening in real life in the final days of a presidential campaign.These FBI Agents were working with Rudy Giuliani to help Trump.  Agents who are Anti-Hillary are working with the Trump Campaign, Breitbart‚Äôs Bannon and a couple of others within the Trump Campaign.  Their Campaign knew in advance, that Comey was going to issue the Email to the GOP.  The GOP got it first, then it was passed on the Democrats.  There is also talk about emails being synched into Antony Weiner‚Äôs Emails, by the FBI and a proper Warrant, was not obtained?Should Hillary Clinton win the presidency, she may end up doing so by overcoming more obstacles than any other presidential candidate in US history.Clinton Foundation:  Trump and Fox News are Saying Clinton "Likely" to be Indicted.  This is a False and Ill Informed, Inaccurate and Without Merit.  Fox News has walked back their claims.Nor, is the Anthony Weiner investigation, ‚ÄúLikely‚Äù to lead to an indictment against Hillary Clinton.Comey is being Investigated for interfering with the Election.  ‚ÄúHatch Act‚ÄùRudy Giuliani is also under investigation for leaking information to the Trump Campaign.Democrats now have all the motivation that they will ever need to get out and vote.STOP THE RIGHT-WING, ALT-RIGHT MADNESS DEMOCRATS!  REJECT AND DEFEAT TRUMP AND THE GOP.  VOTE BLUE UP AND DOWN THE BALLOT!!!IF YOU CARE, SHARE!

17 | Joe Armstrong | 0 | 10154741593573675_10154741738483675 | Why haven't Black and Hispanic Americans considered moving their allegiance to the Republican Party?  1.  They are correctly demonstrating the the deaths of young men who have died in police custody.  Those are horrendous cases which do need to be investigated and bad actions ended.  But that also has to be the internal responsibility of the police agencies across our country.  Blacks and Hispanics around this country should both develop into political entities that have representatives in both the Democratic and Republican parties to ensure that their goals are achieved.  2.  Planned parenthood also came about as a "Cost Mitigation" methodology to ease the welfare cost of the minority populations trapped in inner cities.  An entire generation of unborn minority babies have been killed under the guise of "A Woman's Right To Chose",  Anyone looking at the massive numbers of abortions among young Black and Hispanic females realizes it is at an even higher percentage then Black male imprisonment.  Killing unborn minority babies is simple "Cost Mitigation".  It is far cheaper to do a simple medical procedure, then it is to pay the medical costs and welfare costs of young women who in most cases live in an environment of poverty, crime, drugs, and misery.3.  Blacks historically have been forced to live in inner city slums and ghettos for decades with no hope for a decent education, job, or an ability to own a home.  Hispanics are now being herded into "Sanctuary Cities" for the exact same reasons.  Even now, these "Sanctuary Cities" have become the Hispanic version of the same living conditions forced upon Blacks as a society. 4.  Simply consider the Republican Political Party this election cycle.  Believe the lives of every American can be better and continue to cry out the travesties that the Democratic Party is reaping on your entire populations.  The babies of Black & Hispanic women should not be slaughtered to justify the expense to mitigate the costs of living a full life as an American.  Your babies are innocent!5.  The Democratic Party wants to "Cost Mitigate" the lives of the unborn of minorities in this country.  They expect minorities to vote for their politicians, while at the same time, do nothing to better the lives of Black or Hispanic Americans with jobs, better education, safe and healthy living conditions, and the opportunity to thrive and live life in the manner every citizen deserves.

"The clear trend is away from the death penalty," according to one expert.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Angie Quinn | 6 | 10154741555343675_10154741901803675 | no. the death penalty does nothing to deter crime (states without it actually have lower murder rates per deathpenaltyinfo.org). the cost to taxpayers, for a case where the death penalty is sought, is roughly 2 - 3 times that of a case where it is not sought: it actually is 'cheaper to keep'em'. we are quickly (and in some states have literally) running out of space to jail people (AL for example). then there's the issue of back-logged DNA kits ~ several hundreds of thousands ~ either improperly processed and/or tested...or worse, not being processed at all.
2 | Jose Olvera | 2 | 10154741555343675_10154741859438675 | I think that is a Matter to be handle to all these child predators  Sexual abusers .And any violent crimes. Crimes were the executor as no moral or mercy for their Victims.Them folks should be put to dead .Immediately. After the crime.And in from of Everyone.A public Execution .With all these Rapers
3 | Bill Byrn | 6 | 10154741555343675_10154741642663675 | I personally don't have a problem with it.I see it from the point of view of tax dollars. Why pay for a guy to live if he is never coming out. (After he runs out of appeals).Repeat offenders, sexual predators, child molesters,etc....Have a consensus on where the cut-off line is the start the injection line.I do not see the rehabilitation argument. If you're not an honest, working contributing citizen then get in the injection line.

6 | Mike Eddington | 0 | 10154741555343675_10154741928608675 | Only in indisputable cases. In all criminal trials if prosecution misconduct convicts an innocent person then the sentence for the individuals responsible should be the same as the original sentence
7 | Patricia Abbott | 4 | 10154741555343675_10154741702668675 | The death penalty has never proved to be a deterrent. The appeals process is very costly to taxpayers. It should be abolished on a national basis. Note:  The US is one of very few countries that still practices the death penalty:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment_by_country
8 | Doug Sawyer | 3 | 10154741555343675_10154741686013675 | USA is one off very few civilized countries that still executes people , it's a barbaric antiquated practice that has proven to do nothing to deter crime. It's time the US caught up with the rest of the free world in this area and many others.
9 | Tamara Mason | 8 | 10154741555343675_10154741647948675 | Look at all the people who've been cleared/exonerated through DNA evidence, The Innocence Project and similar organizations. You can't undo death. You can't say "my bad, we thought we had the right guy. Oops..."
10 | Jayne Derwin | 2 | 10154741555343675_10154741741153675 | The more I read about the innocent people imprisoned and some getting their freedom finally, I am wavering on supporting the death penalty especially since there might be someone on death row who is innocent. Until this problem is solved, whether the system is executing an innocent man or woman or not, this type of sentence should be halted.
11 | Angel Morini | 2 | 10154741555343675_10154741677283675 | It's never clear that the person they are killing did that or any other crime. Police and prosecutors just want to pin it on someone so they can pat themselves on the back. What is clear that the serial rapist/killer would do a lot less raping and killing of rape kits were processed and a national database were established. Because while the guy who didn't do it is languishing on death row, the guy who did it is out there doing it again and again.

14 | Harry Brewick | 1 | 10154741555343675_10154741839963675 | I think the HIGH number of accused convicted being freed should be enough of a reason to stop the death penalty.

Why are they kept alive, when those funds can be used to help poverty-stricken areas, soldiers who can't get jobs when they return home, veterans who have giving there all for the safeguard of this nation and what the politicians consider special interest nations, defray the cost of student loan debt, provide equal educational facilities for one and all, and my list could go on and on. In these times, unlike when persons were falsely accused, and didn't have DNA to support their innocence, why should these reprobates be allowed to live off taxpayers, when innocent victms have lost their lives because of the degenerates.  Even the Holy Bible states that if a person kills another, without just cause, the murderer should be put to death. It's time for this crazy nation to do what is right for society. With DNA available to validate an individuals guilt, as well as true witnesses to the crime; due process of the law is not served by allowing murderers to continue to live off  our tax dollars.
17 | Jennifer Johnson | 1 | 10154741555343675_10154741606578675 | The only reason we don't support it is because they kill innocent people and we don't implement it for the people who deserve it like pedophiles.

I am more worried about Trump supporters than Hillary supporters at this. Being threatened or beat up or shot by them is my main concern let alone them harassing people of color. As far as illegal voting, there has never really been a "bigly" problem. Less than .01%. I don't know. Should I really like that the DOJ is sending 500 staffers to only 28 state?
7 | Scottas Sevelis | 2 | 10154741492518675_10154741697548675 | A Short List of Some of Hillary‚Äôs Many Crimes - share!Here are a few of Hillary‚Äôs crimes. Feel free to share.1. Perjury: Why not start with a blast from the Clinton past? Hillary Clinton signed documents testifying that she turned over all work-related emails to the State Department, on orders from a federal judge, under penalty of perjury. We already have indisputable proof she violated this sworn statement‚Ä¶ thousands of times. The cloud of false statements under oath surrounding Hillary Clinton is thousands of times thicker than the one around Bill. Democrats seem to have found a hidden clause in the Constitution that says Clintons can never be prosecuted for perjury, but Madame Secretary is really stress-testing that particular privilege of Clintonhood. One would think the federal judiciary had some interest in establishing that sworn documents must be taken seriously. 2. Obstruction of Justice: Bill Clinton‚Äôs primary motive for committing perjury was to obstruct justice‚Äîit was the second count in his impeachment. (The justice he was obstructing was a sexual harassment suit from Paula Jones, at a time when liberals insisted sexual harassment was the most overlooked, under-prosecuted crime in the legal code.) Hillary‚Äôs thousands of perjury counts are also related to the obstruction of justice. She held back documents she didn‚Äôt want Congress to see. She subverted the Freedom of Information Act, which is a law, not a lovely suggestion. Most media timelines of the Clinton email scandal are either incomplete or deliberately obtuse, because they almost never accurately relate how her secret server was discovered. For example, these timelines from USA Today, CNN, and ABC News all get it wrong. Sharyl Attkisson, who was a participant in the story, has an accurate timeline that makes the important point Clinton-friendly media outlets don‚Äôt want to talk about: we know about the secret server because the State Department was sued for failing to respond to FOIA requests. The State Department‚Äôs official story is that they were surprised to discover Clinton was withholding thousands of documents on her private computer. That‚Äôs straight-up obstruction of justice, in cases involving multiple federal courts, as surely as Bill Clinton‚Äôs impeachable offense of obstructing the Paula Jones suit. Clinton may become untouchable if the American people allow her into the White House, but the lawsuits don‚Äôt evaporate, and neither do the angry judges. 3. Bribery: After the FBI set off a headline earthquake by re-opening the Clinton email investigation, we learned that several other FBI investigations of Clintonworld have been quietly in progress for some time. One of those investigations is digging into bribery allegations against the Clinton Foundation. The FBI agents working on these cases were reportedly very angry that top Bureau and Justice Department officials were pressuring them to drop their investigations. The most attention-grabbing of these suspicions concerns an FBI official, Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, whose wife received an inexplicably huge political donation from Clinton bagman Terry McAuliffe, currently the governor of Virginia. The timing of this donation was so convenient that even the Left side of the blogosphere has produced some uneasy speculation that McCabe probably should have recused himself from all things Clinton-related. Well, he didn‚Äôt recuse himself, and the conflicts of interest are so apparent that the lack of a chiseled-in-stone quid pro quo might not be enough to kill this case off. After all, corrupt officials aren‚Äôt usually dumb enough to write down their quid pro quo agreements, or repeat them into microphones. The McCabe controversy already has longer legs than most observers expected, when the news first broke. 4. Pay for Play: There has also been recent confirmation that the FBI has investigated influence-peddling allegations against the Clinton Foundation, which was so obviously used for that purpose that it‚Äôs funny to watch Clinton apologists insist nothing can be proven in a court of law. Some of the most vigorous infighting within the Bureau reportedly concerns whether pay-for-play investigations should move forward. WikiLeaks has exposed emails from Clinton insiders that openly discuss how the Foundation was part of a network that steered millions of dollars to ‚ÄúBill Clinton Inc.‚Äù Even longtime members of the Clinton syndicate professed themselves troubled by these operations. They were also unhappy with arrangements like Hillary Clinton‚Äôs agreement to speak in Morocco after a $12 million donation to the Clinton Global Initiative. It‚Äôs entirely possible that more documentation about these suspicious Clinton Foundation dealings will come to light after the election, especially if some of the people Clinton took money from grow upset with her. It‚Äôs downright dangerous to have a President with so many strings attached. 5. Illegal Use of a Nonprofit Organization: There are many laws governing the management of charitable organizations, generally intended to prevent them from becoming money-laundering operations, ripoff operations, and vehicles for political influence peddling. The Clinton Foundation and its galaxy of related operations may eventually find itself answering some questions about compliance with those laws, assuming the IRS decides to stop focusing its efforts on hassling mom-and-pop pro-life groups and kitchen-table Tea Party outfits. If the Foundation is ever held to account for any other impropriety, charges of abusing a nonprofit should be part of the legal package as well. 6. Racketeering: Former prosecutor Andrew McCarthy has recently observed that Hillary Clinton‚Äôs abuse of the State Department looks an awful lot like a ‚Äúracketeering enterprise,‚Äù which could trigger the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act of 1971, more widely known as RICO. McCarthy explained: Under RICO, an ‚Äúenterprise‚Äù can be any association of people, informal or formal, illegitimate or legitimate ‚Äì it could be a Mafia family, an ostensibly charitable foundation, or a department of government. It is a racketeering enterprise if its affairs are conducted through ‚Äúa pattern of racketeering activity.‚Äù A ‚Äúpattern‚Äù means merely two or more violations of federal or state law; these violations constitute ‚Äúracketeering activity‚Äù if they are included among the extensive list of felonies laid out in the statute.7. Fraud: Wall Street analyst Charles Ortel has been building a case that the ‚ÄúClinton Charity Network,‚Äù as he calls the complete system of Clinton operations, has committed ‚Äúcharity fraud of epic proportions.‚Äù In part, he refers to discrepancies between donor accounts and the Clinton Foundation‚Äôs books. Others have pointed out how the Clinton Health Access Initiative has essentially ignored New York state law for years, without a peep from Attorney General Eric Schneiderman (who just happens to be part of the Clinton campaign‚Äôs ‚Äúleadership council.‚Äù) There are some interesting differences between the paperwork CHAI submitted to the IRS and what it submitted to the state of New York, which has more specific requirements about identifying foreign donors. In addition to getting a free pass on perjury, the Clintons are traditionally allowed to violate tax laws without penalty, eventually refiling paperwork when ‚Äúerrors‚Äù are discovered years after the fact. Another round of whoops-my-bad, no-harm-no-foul ‚Äúrefiling‚Äù during a Hillary Clinton presidency would be embarrassing, especially if she‚Äôs busy trying to ratchet up taxes on everyone else.

Say goodby to our country and it's safety and more illegals taking jobs and more drugs and crime cuz she won't fix that. People who have guns will have less rights and less options. She is nothing but lies and evil. I learned more about Trump and he is actually a really nice guy, I was told it is like when an actor has a role he has to play, he is just playing his tough role, but when he is with people and family he very nice. He says thank you more than anyone I have ever heard. He truly does care about the direction our country has been going since Obama, and it isn't in a good way, and he wants to turn it around. With her, we are getting another 4 years of Obama and worse. And if you vote for anyone else, it is a vote for her. So, if you don't want Hillary, choose Trump, or we will get Hillary.

Tougher requirements for registering and voting in several states has led to confusion and claims that certain groups are being disenfranchised. Trump has also called for supporters to monitor polling places on Election Day.

When US commanders insisted help be sent, they were relieved of duty. That is a cattle prod on ambassador Steven's genitals. Hillary denied help so her and Obama's weapons running deals would not be discovered.

13 | Scottas Sevelis | 0 | 10154741197868675_10154741698543675 | A Short List of Some of Hillary‚Äôs Many Crimes - share!Here are a few of Hillary‚Äôs crimes. Feel free to share.1. Perjury: Why not start with a blast from the Clinton past? Hillary Clinton signed documents testifying that she turned over all work-related emails to the State Department, on orders from a federal judge, under penalty of perjury. We already have indisputable proof she violated this sworn statement‚Ä¶ thousands of times. The cloud of false statements under oath surrounding Hillary Clinton is thousands of times thicker than the one around Bill. Democrats seem to have found a hidden clause in the Constitution that says Clintons can never be prosecuted for perjury, but Madame Secretary is really stress-testing that particular privilege of Clintonhood. One would think the federal judiciary had some interest in establishing that sworn documents must be taken seriously. 2. Obstruction of Justice: Bill Clinton‚Äôs primary motive for committing perjury was to obstruct justice‚Äîit was the second count in his impeachment. (The justice he was obstructing was a sexual harassment suit from Paula Jones, at a time when liberals insisted sexual harassment was the most overlooked, under-prosecuted crime in the legal code.) Hillary‚Äôs thousands of perjury counts are also related to the obstruction of justice. She held back documents she didn‚Äôt want Congress to see. She subverted the Freedom of Information Act, which is a law, not a lovely suggestion. Most media timelines of the Clinton email scandal are either incomplete or deliberately obtuse, because they almost never accurately relate how her secret server was discovered. For example, these timelines from USA Today, CNN, and ABC News all get it wrong. Sharyl Attkisson, who was a participant in the story, has an accurate timeline that makes the important point Clinton-friendly media outlets don‚Äôt want to talk about: we know about the secret server because the State Department was sued for failing to respond to FOIA requests. The State Department‚Äôs official story is that they were surprised to discover Clinton was withholding thousands of documents on her private computer. That‚Äôs straight-up obstruction of justice, in cases involving multiple federal courts, as surely as Bill Clinton‚Äôs impeachable offense of obstructing the Paula Jones suit. Clinton may become untouchable if the American people allow her into the White House, but the lawsuits don‚Äôt evaporate, and neither do the angry judges. 3. Bribery: After the FBI set off a headline earthquake by re-opening the Clinton email investigation, we learned that several other FBI investigations of Clintonworld have been quietly in progress for some time. One of those investigations is digging into bribery allegations against the Clinton Foundation. The FBI agents working on these cases were reportedly very angry that top Bureau and Justice Department officials were pressuring them to drop their investigations. The most attention-grabbing of these suspicions concerns an FBI official, Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, whose wife received an inexplicably huge political donation from Clinton bagman Terry McAuliffe, currently the governor of Virginia. The timing of this donation was so convenient that even the Left side of the blogosphere has produced some uneasy speculation that McCabe probably should have recused himself from all things Clinton-related. Well, he didn‚Äôt recuse himself, and the conflicts of interest are so apparent that the lack of a chiseled-in-stone quid pro quo might not be enough to kill this case off. After all, corrupt officials aren‚Äôt usually dumb enough to write down their quid pro quo agreements, or repeat them into microphones. The McCabe controversy already has longer legs than most observers expected, when the news first broke. 4. Pay for Play: There has also been recent confirmation that the FBI has investigated influence-peddling allegations against the Clinton Foundation, which was so obviously used for that purpose that it‚Äôs funny to watch Clinton apologists insist nothing can be proven in a court of law. Some of the most vigorous infighting within the Bureau reportedly concerns whether pay-for-play investigations should move forward. WikiLeaks has exposed emails from Clinton insiders that openly discuss how the Foundation was part of a network that steered millions of dollars to ‚ÄúBill Clinton Inc.‚Äù Even longtime members of the Clinton syndicate professed themselves troubled by these operations. They were also unhappy with arrangements like Hillary Clinton‚Äôs agreement to speak in Morocco after a $12 million donation to the Clinton Global Initiative. It‚Äôs entirely possible that more documentation about these suspicious Clinton Foundation dealings will come to light after the election, especially if some of the people Clinton took money from grow upset with her. It‚Äôs downright dangerous to have a President with so many strings attached. 5. Illegal Use of a Nonprofit Organization: There are many laws governing the management of charitable organizations, generally intended to prevent them from becoming money-laundering operations, ripoff operations, and vehicles for political influence peddling. The Clinton Foundation and its galaxy of related operations may eventually find itself answering some questions about compliance with those laws, assuming the IRS decides to stop focusing its efforts on hassling mom-and-pop pro-life groups and kitchen-table Tea Party outfits. If the Foundation is ever held to account for any other impropriety, charges of abusing a nonprofit should be part of the legal package as well. 6. Racketeering: Former prosecutor Andrew McCarthy has recently observed that Hillary Clinton‚Äôs abuse of the State Department looks an awful lot like a ‚Äúracketeering enterprise,‚Äù which could trigger the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act of 1971, more widely known as RICO. McCarthy explained: Under RICO, an ‚Äúenterprise‚Äù can be any association of people, informal or formal, illegitimate or legitimate ‚Äì it could be a Mafia family, an ostensibly charitable foundation, or a department of government. It is a racketeering enterprise if its affairs are conducted through ‚Äúa pattern of racketeering activity.‚Äù A ‚Äúpattern‚Äù means merely two or more violations of federal or state law; these violations constitute ‚Äúracketeering activity‚Äù if they are included among the extensive list of felonies laid out in the statute.7. Fraud: Wall Street analyst Charles Ortel has been building a case that the ‚ÄúClinton Charity Network,‚Äù as he calls the complete system of Clinton operations, has committed ‚Äúcharity fraud of epic proportions.‚Äù In part, he refers to discrepancies between donor accounts and the Clinton Foundation‚Äôs books. Others have pointed out how the Clinton Health Access Initiative has essentially ignored New York state law for years, without a peep from Attorney General Eric Schneiderman (who just happens to be part of the Clinton campaign‚Äôs ‚Äúleadership council.‚Äù) There are some interesting differences between the paperwork CHAI submitted to the IRS and what it submitted to the state of New York, which has more specific requirements about identifying foreign donors. In addition to getting a free pass on perjury, the Clintons are traditionally allowed to violate tax laws without penalty, eventually refiling paperwork when ‚Äúerrors‚Äù are discovered years after the fact. Another round of whoops-my-bad, no-harm-no-foul ‚Äúrefiling‚Äù during a Hillary Clinton presidency would be embarrassing, especially if she‚Äôs busy trying to ratchet up taxes on everyone else.

1 | Sj Lag | 25 | 10154740942248675_10154741122618675 | Men are lazy and self indulgent when it comes to Birthcontrol. Until We evolve into the Equality of Scandinavian Countries where men share equally in the care of children and the home, women in America will continue to carry the huge burden of home and children all their lives. No wonder birthrates are down for Professional Women. Hopefully Millennials will find balance on these basic of Human Issues. Birthcontrol and childcare should be a shared endeavor.
2 | Larissa M Rodriguez | 8 | 10154740942248675_10154741107953675 | I don't really understand why this couldn't be run as a double blind controlled study. I get that it's considered unethical to give a placebo and tell the study participants that it's birth control, but isn't there another option? Can't both groups be told to wear a condom every time they have sex?
3 | Nancy Heifferon | 1 | 10154740942248675_10154741747588675 | The men in the study were not whiners. They reported their experiences as all study subjects are supposed to. Many men want more birth control options than condoms or vasectomy. However, let's face facts: the risk/benefit relationship is different for men--they don't run the risk to health of pregnancy. I think the research will continue. And thank you to all the men, like my husband, who take active responsibility
4 | Matt Nixon | 1 | 10154740942248675_10154741708713675 | Please read the study people. There is no hope, is there? A safety review board wanted to discontinue an experimental drug trial because the negative side effects outweighed the benefit. >75% of participants said they were satisfied using too. 1. The participant is just reporting the effects because that is what they are paid to do! 2. The review board shut it down because they don't know if these effects are reversible, nor how they happen or if there are other health benefits. Why? That's their job! The review board was put together by the WHO and guaranteed contained men and women, because they are professionals. Journalist  who report studies in this manner are just hacks! It's not bias, it's just unknown territory were any human should tread lightly. Or, maybe just make the male world pop our guinea pig.
5 | Jessica Millard Packard | 2 | 10154740942248675_10154741420973675 | I think it's completely unfair to compare the side effects for one main reason: the men's version **increased** sex drive. üòè(Also, "anecdotal" evidence for depression/mood changes?? How has that not been proven by now?!)

22 | Joe Armstrong | 0 | 10154740942248675_10154741331053675 | Why haven't Black and Hispanic Americans considered moving their allegiance to the Republican Party?  1.  They are correctly demonstrating the the deaths of young men who have died in police custody.  Those are horrendous cases which do need to be investigated and bad actions ended.  But that also has to be the internal responsibility of the police agencies across our country.  Blacks and Hispanics around this country should both develop into political entities that have representatives in both the Democratic and Republican parties to ensure that their goals are achieved.  2.  Planned parenthood also came about as a "Cost Mitigation" methodology to ease the welfare cost of the minority populations trapped in inner cities.  An entire generation of unborn minority babies have been killed under the guise of "A Woman's Right To Chose",  Anyone looking at the massive numbers of abortions among young Black and Hispanic females realizes it is at an even higher percentage then Black male imprisonment.  Killing unborn minority babies is simple "Cost Mitigation".  It is far cheaper to do a simple medical procedure, then it is to pay the medical costs and welfare costs of young women who in most cases live in an environment of poverty, crime, drugs, and misery.3.  Blacks historically have been forced to live in inner city slums and ghettos for decades with no hope for a decent education, job, or an ability to own a home.  Hispanics are now being herded into "Sanctuary Cities" for the exact same reasons.  Even now, these "Sanctuary Cities" have become the Hispanic version of the same living conditions forced upon Blacks as a society. 4.  Simply consider the Republican Political Party this election cycle.  Believe the lives of every American can be better and continue to cry out the travesties that the Democratic Party is reaping on your entire populations.  The babies of Black & Hispanic women should not be slaughtered to justify the expense to mitigate the costs of living a full life as an American.  Your babies are innocent!5.  The Democratic Party wants to "Cost Mitigate" the lives of the unborn of minorities in this country.  They expect minorities to vote for their politicians, while at the same time, do nothing to better the lives of Black or Hispanic Americans with jobs, better education, safe and healthy living conditions, and the opportunity to thrive and live life in the manner every citizen deserves.

Worse election ever in the history of the United States of America.
4 | Michael Woods | 0 | 10154740893898675_10154741481213675 | HA!!! It isn't only science and health issues that have taken a back seat in this election... it's most all issues the American public would like to see and hear that have taken a back seat.

6 | Kurt Rex Cooper | 0 | 10154740893898675_10154742114278675 | You could have asked the candidates or their representatives questions about scientific issues when you had them on your show. If you did, I missed that episode, I apologize.
7 | Ted Wetherby | 0 | 10154740893898675_10154741496333675 | I though this whole election was about emails, and Bill Clinton. At least that is all I hear about.. They are talking issues like actual policy's ? I do believe I heard Hilary say something about policy's but she was interrupted by Mr Bombastic and its hard to hear over him saying "WRONG" when she talks.....
8 | Teri Taylor | 1 | 10154740893898675_10154741057718675 | Yeah, we had a fraudulent Republican candidate taking up all the oxygen in the room with a clown show.  How many times have we heard Hillary say we need to talk about the "Issues"!

Reno, a former Miami prosecutor who famously told reporters ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt do spin,‚Äù served nearly eight years as attorney general under President Bill Clinton, the longest stint in a century.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Virginia Marks Mahoney | 186 | 10154740662538675_10154740784593675 | "Speak out against the hatred, the bigotry and the violence in this land. Most haters are cowards. When confronted, they back down. When we remain silent, they flourish,"....Janet Reno. RIP
2 | Bones Lorraine | 112 | 10154740662538675_10154740734243675 | Note to the right wing loons: David Koresh was responsible for the deaths at Waco including the rapes of the young girls/children that he had brainwashed along with their families. Now go bugger off somewhere else.
3 | Rebecca Kendrick | 63 | 10154740662538675_10154740800733675 | Love her or hate her, she opened the door for women in Washington. Personally, I respected her. Our country was going through a lot of crap during her tenure. She handled it proving women could be as tough as men.
4 | Bernadette Mathews | 66 | 10154740662538675_10154740776768675 | I'm sorry she didn't live to see Hillary become President
5 | Larry Schodts | 57 | 10154740662538675_10154740823578675 | During my years in DC I met Janet Reno, a few times at functions. As attorney General she wasn't a political operative and didn't seek the cameras or media. She may have been thrust into the spotlight because of her position and career path but she was incredibly intelligent, demure and kind. She was a Dupont Circle farmers market regular, always wore a wide brimmed straw hat and sunglasses. She was a museum affecianado. A couple of times I spotted her at one of the Phillips Collection exhibits or one of the Smithsonian's and while we didn't speak we always shared a smile and kind nod. I'm sorry to hear she passed. She was an intelligent soul. We've lost a great intellect.
6 | David Martin | 31 | 10154740662538675_10154740824313675 | It's sad that Janet Reno passed away today, just one day before witnessing the election of the first female president of the United States of America!  Rest in Peace, Janet Reno!
7 | Catriona Comb | 52 | 10154740662538675_10154740755788675 | Like I said on another post - she was a tough lady in a tough job. Thank you for your service to our country Ms. Reno. xx

9 | Melanie Fernandez | 1 | 10154740662538675_10154742124498675 | Worked at Miami SAO for a short stint. Sister worked in accounting. Family friend Gary worked with secretarial pool for ASA"s on sixth floor when she was SA. She stood her ground and helped pave the way for women in gov.
10 | Mary-ann Wythe | 2 | 10154740662538675_10154742081428675 | To all the people who have chosen to focus only on Waco you need serious critical thinking education. No one's life can be viewed on only one issue, you always look at the totality of their life and work. Would you like your life to be viewed on your worst day or would you like the good and bad to be considered.? Please try to be kinder - it's easier.
11 | Mark East | 2 | 10154740662538675_10154741048288675 | A complete disgrace to the Constitution, America and our way of life. Burned women and children alive. Kidnapped a boy using the FBI at gunpoint. No one deserves less respect.
12 | Jon Osborne | 1 | 10154740662538675_10154741200823675 | Actually, it was PBS that first informed me what a devil she was. The PBS Frontline documentary told how she pretty much judicially tortured a bunch of child care workers -- including a 14-year-old baby sitter -- to make a name for herself as a crusader for children. I never forgot that. http://missliberty.com/the-child-terror-1998/
13 | Carl McKay | 1 | 10154740662538675_10154741204413675 | In REAL news, Janet Reno dies today. A reminder of the last time the Clintons were in office and appointed an Attorney General who ordered a Massacre by Federal Law Enforcement Officers on American Soil in Waco.
14 | Doug Sawyer | 10 | 10154740662538675_10154740944663675 | Reno made history, the 1st woman AG because that's what democrats do, we are known for doing 1st in the nation and we are set to make history again tomorrow with another 1st.
15 | Beverly Buys | 13 | 10154740662538675_10154740882678675 | Oh Janet, you almost made it long enough to see our first female president. I am sorry you didn't. You were a trailblazer.

From taxes to the Trans-Pacific Partnership and college costs, Clinton has laid out an extensive list of pledges.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Craig Giodsir | 15 | 10154738569718675_10154739916163675 | Unlike Trump, Clinton's policies make the allowance that day one of the Presidency starts with that horrific national debt still there. Trump's policies need to start with a balanced budget on day one and Monopoly money to pay for everything.
2 | William H Boley | 8 | 10154738569718675_10154740467973675 | At least we know specifically what she says she will do. In contrast to a few specifics and many generalities. Do we really even know what we'd be getting with him?
3 | Alison Flint | 9 | 10154738569718675_10154740158368675 | Oh yay! More pledges during a campaign.  Amazing to watch her public platform evolve over the course of the campaign to vacuum up Sander's platform. The problem here is that her public platform never happens, nor was it ever meant to happen. What nods she actually ever gives to any of it will be so watered down and full of holes and wrapped in pages upon pages of legalese that the end result will benefit the same Gods as always but she'll announce she made it happen. The folks paying for their politicians didn't gain control by being stupid, they aren't financing her out of charity. Follow the money and you'll see who will benefit from anything she does - and it ain't 99.9% of us. But yep, she'll say anything for votes.
4 | Liz Homer | 9 | 10154738569718675_10154739913868675 | My, my how the media likes planning how they will hold Hillary's feet to the fire. On the other hand Trump lies soMuch nobody really knows what he will do.
5 | James Culver | 13 | 10154738569718675_10154739905793675 | Yeah....I'd be surprised if she followed through with 10 percent of the Sanders...errr...I mean...her platform.
6 | Richard Gougeon | 4 | 10154738569718675_10154740982068675 | According to a new poll conducted last week, 67 percent of likely voters don‚Äôt think Hillary Clinton is ‚Äúhonest and trustworthy.‚Äù
7 | Kristy Webb Lalonde | 1 | 10154738569718675_10154741232568675 | Keep this in mind before you vote tomorrow if you haven't already. NONE of these thousands of emails being released by WikiLeaks or the Veritas Videos have been contested or denied by any party relating to them, at all. Not one... In FACT, many people have been fired and or resigned. GUILTY, GUILTY, GUILTY...Vote Trump/Pence 2016!!! üá∫üá∏
8 | Jennifer Vicent | 6 | 10154738569718675_10154739951853675 | Dear humans of the United States of America:   You must be very exhausted after this long elections. It's time for you to make the right decision and vote.  Overall, love everyone as you love yourself.
9 | Jeffrey Knee | 2 | 10154738569718675_10154740283233675 | LeBron James has forgotten his roots. His mom wisely gave him up to be raised in a stable family and he attended a Catholic high school, where his sporting talents took off. Today he supports Hillary, who opposes school choice for kids in failing school districts. If his mom had kept him in the inner city public schools and lived on welfare, we wouldn't know who LeBron James is today. He'd probably be just a number someplace, if still alive. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James
10 | Debby Zamorski | 6 | 10154738569718675_10154739917108675 | No, those are our platform. She is a legally ineligible and factually invalid candidate. Don't play like we make a difference, because if we did, she would not be the nominee. I no more buy into the fiction of Sanders being in a position of power (other than we the people paying attention) than I believe in any carrot stick crap that the two private club plutocrat tool parties float to try and legitimize dishonesty and ignorance .

14 | Darren Anthony Bacchus | 3 | 10154738569718675_10154740590708675 | It's not possible to know when she's lying and telling the truth. I don't think she knows anymore. She wouldn't follow through because she has no values. Just look at accusing Trump of his words towards women.

It is hard to tell how he can come on TV at CNN every night disgracing D. J. Trump when he himself committed such a disposable act! What was he showing the States teens for an example as their peer, Donald is stepping in as a Steward to the young of America. Not as this example as we see in this article:Evidence reason Bakari Sellers' DUI charge droppedLaDonna BeekerApr 8, 2013 05:16 PMCHESTER COUNTY, SC (WIS) - Evidence in a state representative's driving under the influence case allowed him to plea to a lesser charge.    State Rep. Bakari Sellers was charged with DUI on Oct. 7 when he was traveling north on Interstate 77 just after 1 a.m. from a South Carolina football game, where he admitted to deputies he was drinking alcohol. Sellers refused a breath test, resulting in an automatic six-month driver's license suspension. His license was reinstated in February by a judicial panel.However, Sellers will not see any more consequences from the DUI charge because video surveillance from the deputy's patrol car did not match the date on Sellers' ticket. Because the evidence did not flow, it could not hold up in court.Sellers was allowed to plead guilty to reckless driving and pay a $475 fine. Court documents show he signed an affidavit April 1 acknowledging his guilt to the lesser charge."I am very pleased to have been cleared of all alcohol-related charges from my traffic stop in Chester County last fall," Sellers said in a statement released Friday.He takes "full responsibility" for his actions and admitted he was too tired to drive."I apologize and will do my best to set a better example for our youth and to continue to move South Carolina forward," Sellers said." I don't think he should explain properness when he is so drunk with words against a person that stands for America! As unbelievably, there is shocking videos on the net of his DUI arrest! TRUMP 2016

During the last two decades, Iowa has largely voted for Democratic presidential candidates.

1 | Crystal Keller | 54 | 10154739342308675_10154739640253675 | He'll take Iowa cuz there's a lot of country folk. They keep voting for Steve King which is ranked last in the congress for getting anything done. Trump can have Iowa cuz Hillary will still get her numbers by winning Florida. And will probably get a majority in the senate. Problem solved. After Tuesday hope to never see or hear of Trump again. He promised.
2 | Dean Roger Miller | 29 | 10154739342308675_10154739626528675 | Yes! Iowa is home to Ernst King and Grassley. Iowa has trump demographics written all over it. Iowa is one of the least diverse states and should not be the first place to hold caucuses
3 | Kristen Meyer | 13 | 10154739342308675_10154739823648675 | After spending the weekend driving through a sea of Trump signs in rural Missouri, I'd guess The same is true of rural Iowa.  I'm hoping the cities of Missouri & Iowa are inhabited by unprejudiced citizens able to read and think intelligently therefore supporting Clinton.  I'm pretty sure the rural Midwest only receives one television channel......Fox News.
4 | Bonnie Walker | 16 | 10154739342308675_10154739670593675 | Poor Iowa !  So sorry. Buck up and vote blue on November 8th. You can do it. You are the leader the Iowa test of basic skills. We all had to take it. You used to be the leader.
5 | Deb White | 18 | 10154739342308675_10154739662778675 | Trump was spoon fed with a platinum spoon. Not only did his Daddy hand him over millions he bailed out his businesses that were collapsing. His business record is tainted and shady. He boasts about manipulating the tax codes and yet takes every advantage of roads bridges airports which he pays nothing for upkeep. He claims he donates to charity and yet no charities will confirm his generous checks have ever arrived. He is a fraud and a bloated con man.
6 | Lisa Prichard | 4 | 10154739342308675_10154740187443675 | I think it may have something to do with the Governor's son being the State campaign person for Trump. Koch Brothers have bought Iowa....Joni Ernest is their creation and they are moving in on the state legislature.
7 | Roger Cruser | 5 | 10154739342308675_10154740051868675 | I give Iowa more credit than many. They are thoughtful and considerate people. They are polar opposites of Donald Trump and I believe they will move in favor of Hillary. She is the only valid choice.
8 | Dee Slinde | 0 | 10154739342308675_10154741951838675 | The farmers have forgotten that their best chance of representation is with the Democratic FARMER Laborer party. If Trump gets elected and they lose all the lovey farm bill subsidies they currently get, the tune will change fast enough.

10 | Derrick Obeng Benson | 5 | 10154739342308675_10154739607858675 | For all you people that are against Trump, look at his background. The man came from nothing and became a billionaire. And now he is coming with no political experience and he will be the greatest president ever.Trump is the only one who can break the cycle of political cronyism in Washington - BECAUSE he's an outsider! #Trump2016
11 | George Campbell | 2 | 10154739342308675_10154740535343675 | Trump demonstrated explicitly that conservatism and racism are bound together. There is no concept of American Conservatism that does not have a racist component as a support pillar. W.F. Buckley attempted to decouple the two, but his brand of intellectualism has been rejected by the GOP.
12 | Candance Peace | 0 | 10154739342308675_10154742244488675 | Watching the news and Trump said he did along he could...I guess that includes, bullying, lying, cheating, hates speeches etc.. so glad this will end soon.

I could lie and they'd still eat it up. I bet my numbers would be terrific." -Donald J. Trump- People Magazine 1998!!!!!
14 | Ariel Cruz | 19 | 10154739342308675_10154739638968675 | I voted for Bernie Sanders against Hillary Clinton in the ny primary and I agree with Jill Stein on pretty much everything but we can't allow trump to step one foot into The White House as of today Jill Stein is polling at 2% if you supported Bernie Sanders and everything that he stands for and accomplished we should follow his advice and vote for Hillary Clinton in this election.
15 | Mera Molano Andrea Esthefania | 15 | 10154739342308675_10154739673058675 | TÂçêump is not going to be President. The majority of Americans are to morally decent and too intelligent for that to happen. What is disturbing is that we live in a country where even one single person, never mind millions, believe a brainless, racist, egomaniacal sexual predator with the temperament of a middle school bully deserves your precious vote. We're at a point where if you vote for Trump you either endorse what he represents (I almost said "stands for" but he stands for NOTHING other than his insatiable narcissism) or you are ignorant of it. Which is it? I really want a Trump voter to tell me.
16 | Robert Dunning | 3 | 10154739342308675_10154739611328675 | Easily. Des Moines register poll out yesterday has trump up by 7 in Iowa.
17 | Kylee Moore | 4 | 10154739342308675_10154739834263675 | Iowa, THIS is the election you decide to go Republican?
18 | Margaret McGinn Ragona | 2 | 10154739342308675_10154739612383675 | Iowa hasn't qualified as battle ground in quite awhile.
19 | Daniel Disabato | 4 | 10154739342308675_10154739629683675 | There are huge numbers of Hispanics in Iowa at the meat packing plants that have not been polled.
20 | Thad Messenger | 1 | 10154739342308675_10154741356623675 | Why are you now trying to say Iowa is a battle ground?  It's been pretty solidly nutty for years.

22 | Ken Dabbs | 0 | 10154739342308675_10154741315768675 | Like Trump said in the primaries: how stupid are the people of Iowa? Not my words. His words.

24 | Karen Pisano-Gustavson | 1 | 10154739342308675_10154740296548675 | Iowa is only 6 electoral votes. It's only somehow a weird symbolic thing to win it. And I mean weird as in pretty much only this race.
25 | Ann B Hein | 5 | 10154739342308675_10154739680713675 | We Re working hard in Ames to prevent it,    but the rest of the state is a tough nut to crack.

How are voters in Ohio feeling in the final days of the election?
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Scotty Jones Cherryholmes | 54 | 10154739338768675_10154739609913675 | I'm really shocked anyone is voting for Trump. I mean anyone with an education. You know, the ones ignorant people call the "elites."
2 | Wendy Mellon | 27 | 10154739338768675_10154739843643675 | I honestly have no respect for the intelligence and judgment of anyone who votes for Trump and I never will. You may hate Hillary, but don't sacrifice our country to someone incapable of running it because of that hate. I will never respect your intelligence, your brain or your service to our country if you vote Trump. You harm our country, our poor, our middle class, our daughters, mothers, sisters and grandmothers, our immigrants, our economy. I will never have respect for you no matter how you serve. Inexcusable. Period.
3 | David Motley | 5 | 10154739338768675_10154739676948675 | As far as the electoral map goes I do think Trump has a really good chance at winning Ohio (the polls are apparently really close), as well as Iowa and Arizona, but he still has quite the uphill climb for winning the election. Still curious to see if Utah goes for the independent McMullin who pulls remarkably close to Trump there. It's possible the way the polls are that Florida will be the deciding race in figuring out who's going to win this thing.
4 | Cala Rogers Seifer | 1 | 10154739338768675_10154739695493675 | I live in Stark county in ohio and Trump seems to be pretty popular around here. Yard signs and trump signs everywhere. One of the biggest industries here is steel mills and with massive layoffs people are pissed and looking for a non-politician i suppose. And there are a ton of ads about hillary coming for guns or being against the second amendment. And the mailers, whew... I read the race between Strickland and Portman for senate is one of the biggest campaign spending for a senate race. Its crazyIts not looking good.

6 | Mark W. Ingram | 0 | 10154739338768675_10154739671558675 | I would think that the good people of Ohio would feel a lot like the rest oe the country.  Like we are being assulted by a political contest that has gone insane.  No matter who wins, tribal warfare will be rampant. The goverment will be disfunctional and the downward spiral of our country will speed up.
7 | Linda Matchick | 0 | 10154739338768675_10154741632028675 | We're feeling great, even though we are surrounded by the "amazing people haters" we know Hillary will win. Just because Ohio people are low on the brain level there are others in the country that actually think.
8 | Gerry Schultz | 11 | 10154739338768675_10154739609153675 | Trump will probably win among white guys. After that, it's all her.
9 | Mindy Wirick | 0 | 10154739338768675_10154741155473675 | From Tina:I put this post on my personal page today. It was hard cause so many people on my friends list are trump supporters/Hillary haters. I like to avoid that drama! I just felt there was some things I had to say. I've tried my best to keep my opinions about the election off my fb page. Mostly cause most of my friends list is predominately trump supporters and I try to keep that drama out of my life. But as this election draws close I think it's time I put some of my thoughts out there. If you start reading this please read til the end you may be surprised where I'm going. On Tuesday when I go cast my vote for Clinton/Kaine I will walk out of there knowing for me I did the right thing. Does that mean I think she's the absolutely best candidate there is? Maybe she isn't but out of the 2 I know in my mind and heart she's the one for me. Some people say that either one of these 2 will bring down America. I strongly disagree with that. No matter what happens I know America will be ok. This election has brought out a lot of hate and ignorance on both sides. And it breaks my heart this is what we have come to. But I cannot in my own conscience vote for a man that I feel is an egotistical self righteous bully. I honestly could go on and on about why I dislike him so much but I won't cause that goes against the spirit of this post. Does trump scare me? No he doesn't but the fact that his thinking can blind so many people does. To me the things that he's said far outweigh any email scandal. Do I think Hillary was negligent in her handling of her emails. Sure she was but does that make her a criminal? Of course it doesn't. Do I think that Benghazi was a horrible tragedy that could have been handled better? Yes of course I do. But to point a finger at one person and call her a murderer is crazy. That was a joint effort of several people dropping the ball that led to these people's deaths. Why does no one bring up the fact that the republican led congress voted to cut funding for security over there? Those 4 people dying was a tragedy that should have been avoided. But to blame one person is ridiculous. One thing I know for sure is those people went to work knowing everyday that it was dangerous and they did it anyway. That to me means those people died American heroes and I can think of a lot worse ways to die. On Wednesday no matter who wins I will still wake up and go to work and live my life. It will be harder cause if trump wins and repeals Obamacare (as he has promised) that means my 19 year old daughter will be without health insurance (that includes medical dental and vision) because my right to carry her on my health insurance will be taken away. Yes that terrifies me but I will figure it out as I always do. My life will go on as will all of yours no matter what happens. What really bothers me as an aftermath of this election is all the hate and judgment that has came out of people. I know good people that support trump. Do I like their thinking on trump? No I don't but that doesn't mean I don't like them. The things I've seen on here have truly hurt my heart. People constantly sharing memes that depict me as being stupid or a baby killer or so on and so on. People know what they share. I keep my mouth shut but it hurts. People attacking obamas wife and kids or hillarys daughter or trumps wife and kids. Bothers me the most cause I think they should be off limits. People not truly understanding what late term abortion really means and calling those women murderers and saying they rip those babies out of their bodies like animals hurts me. Imagine being put in a situation where you want your baby sometimes fought to even get pregnant. Then that baby starts basically poisoning your body and the doctors are telling you that the baby cannot survive on their own and if they don't get that baby out of you now then you will both die. Late term abortions rarely happen mostly cause with wonderful medical technology they can deliver those babies. But sadly that's not always the case. I read some of these women's stories and cried with them over the agonizing decisions they were faced with. You can only trust your doctors and what they are telling you. These women are beating themselves up cause they feel like their bodies failed their babies. Some of these women would have gladly died if there was even a tiny chance their babies could be delivered and lived. But they had to think of their other children at home or their spouse or their parents. Then to have Donald trump refer to them as ripping their babies out of them. I can only imagine what a slap in the face that would be. People judging others based on their race or choice of religion hurts my heart. I've also had people even family members that I love get on here and call me stupid or blind or my head in the sand cause of my opinions. Let me tell you it hurts. Then we have the news stories that strangers comment on. Attacking each other calling names, bullying, threatening to kill each other, attacking their family members, saying that they want either one of the candidates to die. I just can't understand why people do that. So I know a lot of you people are praying that your candidate wins or even praying on which candidate to vote for. But I tell you what I'm gonna start praying on. I'm gonna start asking God for guidance on how I can become better and try and bring forth positivity. And even if I can help influence one person to be kinder then I'll be ok with that. And please respect that these are my thoughts and opinions on my page and they are not up for debate or attacking me. Have a great day everyone and may god bless all of you!
10 | Brian Norberg | 0 | 10154739338768675_10154741470138675 | Hillary Clinton and the DNC have set us up for a decade of lame Republican rule.  Because of her hubris HRC has forced her way into the nomination this year and if she wins she will remain unpopular on the right and the left.  In the 2018 midterms Democrats are faced with an raft full of Senate races they have to defend.  Meaning they will most likely lose the Senate.  And the in 2020(assuming HRC wins tomorrow) Hillary Clinton will try and get a second term. Which if this election is any indication she will lose.  Not only will she lose but she will lose but I would bet she will lose to someone like Paul Ryan.  Which will give the Republicans the House, the Senate and the Whitehouse.  And this will happen right after the next census insuring massive gerrymandering by the Republicans.  So to those of us on the left.  If you want any chance of significant change you had better get it out of Hillary in the next two years.  Because after that you are SOL.
11 | Tim Loeb | 2 | 10154739338768675_10154740172063675 | On the 8th take a stand against Trump. Trump promotes hate, stand for love. Trump promotes fear, stand for courage.

Hillary Clinton aimed to hit high notes Sunday in the final moments of her campaign as Donald Trump vowed he and his supporters would never quit.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Michele A Wilcox | 67 | 10154738337883675_10154739424108675 | Now here's the deal...I don't care whether or not any classified emails were on Hillary's private server email account 6 or more years ago since (a) her server was NEVER hacked, (b) there was absolutely NO resulting fallout detrimental to US interests. Let me repeat: I DON'T CARE!What I DO CARE about is...Trey Gowdy falsifying documents with the purpose to frame Hillary and impugn her honor as Secretary of State. He later admitted altering documents to the Select Committee, who found Hillary innocent.Jason Chaffetz outed a CIA op putting American lives in danger.The current REPUBLICAN nominee is being investigated by the FBI for his and his campaign's ties to a hostile foreign gov't.Americans still do not have Trump's tax returns and no clear plan has been announced for what happens with Trump empire should he win to avoid conflicts of interest given his deep indebtedness to Russia, China and Saudi Arabia.Ohio lost absentee ballots, Indiana may disallow 45,000 voters registered in predominantly black neighborhoods.Multiple arrests have been made in the last few days for voter fraud and election rigging by TRUMP SUPPORTERS.Once esteemed 4th Estate, upon which most Americans rely to report FACTS has turned into a freakin' 24/7 reality show filled with guest appearances by every loser with an unsubstantiated and factless "opinion".Civil suit against Trump for child rape has survived his million dollar lawyers' attempts to dismiss it. And, was only cancelled because of death threats against the plaintiff.A civil suit for FRAUD (Trump U) against Trump with substantial evidence supporting it.Republicans have threatened...yes, THREATENED - Americans with FOUR MORE YEARS of political gamesmanship and obstruction if they don't get their way.
2 | Jerry Savage | 53 | 10154738337883675_10154739420713675 | Comey knew about the emails in early October. They would have obtained a warrant immediately if there was real cause to do so. Comey's cryptic announcement was nothing but a ruse.
3 | Robyn Rogers | 1 | 10154738337883675_10154740336713675 | When Trump stands there and says "what have you got to lose" the answer is everything unfortunately but some people still don't actually work out the fact from the fiction and think he's some kind of superhero not the business, moral and person failure he so obviously is.
4 | Nancy M Bell | 21 | 10154738337883675_10154739474888675 | It's over for me.  Voted early.  Champagne on ice and ready to go to DC in January.My family, my friends areALL WITH HER
5 | Ramon Cordero | 11 | 10154738337883675_10154739579308675 | So much for the so called emails scandal. Republicans were trying to find anything to see what sticks. Get over it. You got nothing on her now. She is a good person and will be your next president. Trump is a hateful, racist, arrogant, person and will never be our president. Americans want someone that represent our values. Trump does not live up to those values.
6 | Michele A Wilcox | 2 | 10154738337883675_10154740414798675 | I find it interesting that the Republicans have investigated Hillary for 25 years and wasted millions of dollars only to find absolutely nothing. Face it, she hasn't committed any crimes. Republicans are afraid of her and know she has the ability to get things done. She has a proven track record of great accomplishments whereas Trump has a trail of failed enterprises.
7 | Mindy Wirick | 0 | 10154738337883675_10154740861268675 | From Tina:I put this post on my personal page today. It was hard cause so many people on my friends list are trump supporters/Hillary haters. I like to avoid that drama! I just felt there was some things I had to say. I've tried my best to keep my opinions about the election off my fb page. Mostly cause most of my friends list is predominately trump supporters and I try to keep that drama out of my life. But as this election draws close I think it's time I put some of my thoughts out there. If you start reading this please read til the end you may be surprised where I'm going. On Tuesday when I go cast my vote for Clinton/Kaine I will walk out of there knowing for me I did the right thing. Does that mean I think she's the absolutely best candidate there is? Maybe she isn't but out of the 2 I know in my mind and heart she's the one for me. Some people say that either one of these 2 will bring down America. I strongly disagree with that. No matter what happens I know America will be ok. This election has brought out a lot of hate and ignorance on both sides. And it breaks my heart this is what we have come to. But I cannot in my own conscience vote for a man that I feel is an egotistical self righteous bully. I honestly could go on and on about why I dislike him so much but I won't cause that goes against the spirit of this post. Does trump scare me? No he doesn't but the fact that his thinking can blind so many people does. To me the things that he's said far outweigh any email scandal. Do I think Hillary was negligent in her handling of her emails. Sure she was but does that make her a criminal? Of course it doesn't. Do I think that Benghazi was a horrible tragedy that could have been handled better? Yes of course I do. But to point a finger at one person and call her a murderer is crazy. That was a joint effort of several people dropping the ball that led to these people's deaths. Why does no one bring up the fact that the republican led congress voted to cut funding for security over there? Those 4 people dying was a tragedy that should have been avoided. But to blame one person is ridiculous. One thing I know for sure is those people went to work knowing everyday that it was dangerous and they did it anyway. That to me means those people died American heroes and I can think of a lot worse ways to die. On Wednesday no matter who wins I will still wake up and go to work and live my life. It will be harder cause if trump wins and repeals Obamacare (as he has promised) that means my 19 year old daughter will be without health insurance (that includes medical dental and vision) because my right to carry her on my health insurance will be taken away. Yes that terrifies me but I will figure it out as I always do. My life will go on as will all of yours no matter what happens. What really bothers me as an aftermath of this election is all the hate and judgment that has came out of people. I know good people that support trump. Do I like their thinking on trump? No I don't but that doesn't mean I don't like them. The things I've seen on here have truly hurt my heart. People constantly sharing memes that depict me as being stupid or a baby killer or so on and so on. People know what they share. I keep my mouth shut but it hurts. People attacking obamas wife and kids or hillarys daughter or trumps wife and kids. Bothers me the most cause I think they should be off limits. People not truly understanding what late term abortion really means and calling those women murderers and saying they rip those babies out of their bodies like animals hurts me. Imagine being put in a situation where you want your baby sometimes fought to even get pregnant. Then that baby starts basically poisoning your body and the doctors are telling you that the baby cannot survive on their own and if they don't get that baby out of you now then you will both die. Late term abortions rarely happen mostly cause with wonderful medical technology they can deliver those babies. But sadly that's not always the case. I read some of these women's stories and cried with them over the agonizing decisions they were faced with. You can only trust your doctors and what they are telling you. These women are beating themselves up cause they feel like their bodies failed their babies. Some of these women would have gladly died if there was even a tiny chance their babies could be delivered and lived. But they had to think of their other children at home or their spouse or their parents. Then to have Donald trump refer to them as ripping their babies out of them. I can only imagine what a slap in the face that would be. People judging others based on their race or choice of religion hurts my heart. I've also had people even family members that I love get on here and call me stupid or blind or my head in the sand cause of my opinions. Let me tell you it hurts. Then we have the news stories that strangers comment on. Attacking each other calling names, bullying, threatening to kill each other, attacking their family members, saying that they want either one of the candidates to die. I just can't understand why people do that. So I know a lot of you people are praying that your candidate wins or even praying on which candidate to vote for. But I tell you what I'm gonna start praying on. I'm gonna start asking God for guidance on how I can become better and try and bring forth positivity. And even if I can help influence one person to be kinder then I'll be ok with that. And please respect that these are my thoughts and opinions on my page and they are not up for debate or attacking me. Have a great day everyone and may god bless all of you!

State Rep. Bakari Sellers was charged with DUI on Oct. 7 when he was traveling north on Interstate 77 just after 1 a.m. from a South Carolina football game, where he admitted to deputies he was drinking alcohol. Sellers refused a breath test, resulting in an automatic six-month driver's license suspension. His license was reinstated in February by a judicial panel.However, Sellers will not see any more consequences from the DUI charge because video surveillance from the deputy's patrol car did not match the date on Sellers' ticket. Because the evidence did not flow, it could not hold up in court.Sellers was allowed to plead guilty to reckless driving and pay a $475 fine. Court documents show he signed an affidavit April 1 acknowledging his guilt to the lesser charge."I am very pleased to have been cleared of all alcohol-related charges from my traffic stop in Chester County last fall," Sellers said in a statement released Friday.He takes "full responsibility" for his actions and admitted he was too tired to drive."I apologize and will do my best to set a better example for our youth and to continue to move South Carolina forward," Sellers said."

Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr. George W. Bush and Al Gore. Sometimes, Election Day ends without a clear winner.

2 | Scotty Jones Cherryholmes | 8 | 10154739029478675_10154739314433675 | The Democrats were robbed in 2000. In the chaotic first days after the 2000 election, Al Gore and George W. Bush selected Christopher and James A. Baker III as their respective representatives in Florida. Both were former Secretaries of State. It soon became apparent that that was about all they had in common.Christopher believed in negotiation; he didn‚Äôt necessarily trust that he and Baker could simply decide the winner of the race between them, but he did think that they could at least settle the ground rules and procedures. Facing Baker in a conference room at the tiny Governors Inn, in Tallahassee, Christopher thought he could reach at least some kind of meeting of the minds.Baker didn‚Äôt. Baker recognized that the race for the Presidency was the ultimate zero-sum game, and he decided not to yield on a single question. Under Christopher, the Gore forces both preached and practiced restraint. Under Baker, the Bush team fought all-out on every front‚Äîthrough the media, in the courthouses, and in the streets. The difference between the two sides, and between the two men, was immediately apparent and central to the final result.By the end of the thirty-six day contest, the Gore side had stepped up its efforts, which were, by that point, led by David Boies and Ron Klain (a Christopher prot√©g√©). Chris had long since returned to Los Angeles. He was then, and is now, an honorable representative of an era very different from our own.

Carper of Delaware. Its CEO was Bruce Reed.The model on which the Democratic Leadership Council was built was the Coalition for a Democratic Majority. Founded by "Scoop" Jackson Democrats in response to George McGovern's massive loss to Richard Nixon in 1972, the CDM was dismayed by two presidential election losses and the organization's goal was to steer the party away from the New Left influence that had permeated the Democratic party since the late 1960s and back to the policies that made the FDR coalition electorally successful for close to 40 years.
10 | Susan Anthony | 0 | 10154739029478675_10154739301933675 | By changing state laws, without changing anything in the Constitution, the National Popular Vote bill is 61% of the way to guaranteeing the majority of Electoral College votes, and thus the presidency, to the candidate who receives the most popular votes in the country, by replacing state winner-take-all laws for awarding electoral votes in the enacting states.	Every vote, everywhere, would be politically relevant and equal in presidential elections. No more distorting and divisive red and blue state maps of predictable outcomes. There would no longer be a handful of 'battleground' states where voters and policies are more important than those of the voters in 38+ states that now are just 'spectators' and ignored after the conventions.The National Popular Vote bill would take effect when enacted by states possessing a majority of the electoral votes‚Äî270 of 538.  All of the presidential electors from the enacting states will be supporters of the presidential candidate receiving the most popular votes in all 50 states (and DC)‚Äîthereby guaranteeing that candidate with an Electoral College majority.The bill was approved this year by a unanimous bipartisan House committee vote in both Georgia (16 electoral votes) and Missouri (10).The bill has passed 34 state legislative chambers in 23 rural, small, medium, large, Democratic, Republican and purple states with 261 electoral votes, including one house in Arizona (11), Arkansas (6), Maine (4), Michigan (16), Nevada (6), New Mexico (5), North Carolina (15), and Oklahoma (7), and both houses in Colorado (9). The bill has been enacted by 11 small, medium, and large jurisdictions with 165 electoral votes ‚Äì 61% of the way to guaranteeing the presidency to the candidate with the most national popular votes.NationalPopularVote

Whatever does happen I just want the hate to dissipate. We are all in this together. We are still stewards and neighbors of this great nation. Let's stop turning on 'eachother'. Kindness is easy.

When it looks like it's over for Hillary, President Obama will slide one of those mysterious folding metal chairs that can somehow materialize by ring side at wrestling matches into the ring. She'll jump up and smash Trump in the back of the head while he goats, then we'll have our next president.

It is hard to tell how he can come on TV at CNN every night disgracing D. J. Trump when he himself committed such a disposable act! What was he showing the States teens for an example as their peer, Donald is stepping in as a Steward to the young of America. Not as this example as we see in this article:Evidence reason Bakari Sellers' DUI charge droppedLaDonna BeekerApr 8, 2013 05:16 PMCHESTER COUNTY, SC (WIS) - Evidence in a state representative's driving under the influence case allowed him to plea to a lesser charge.    State Rep. Bakari Sellers was charged with DUI on Oct. 7 when he was traveling north on Interstate 77 just after 1 a.m. from a South Carolina football game, where he admitted to deputies he was drinking alcohol. Sellers refused a breath test, resulting in an automatic six-month driver's license suspension. His license was reinstated in February by a judicial panel.However, Sellers will not see any more consequences from the DUI charge because video surveillance from the deputy's patrol car did not match the date on Sellers' ticket. Because the evidence did not flow, it could not hold up in court.Sellers was allowed to plead guilty to reckless driving and pay a $475 fine. Court documents show he signed an affidavit April 1 acknowledging his guilt to the lesser charge."I am very pleased to have been cleared of all alcohol-related charges from my traffic stop in Chester County last fall," Sellers said in a statement released Friday.He takes "full responsibility" for his actions and admitted he was too tired to drive."I apologize and will do my best to set a better example for our youth and to continue to move South Carolina forward," Sellers said." I don't think he should explain properness when he is so drunk with words against a person that stands for America! As unbelievably, there is shocking videos on the net of his DUI arrest! TRUMP 2016

The National Popular Vote Interstate Compact would automatically allocate participating states' Electoral College votes to whoever wins the popular vote.

1 | Langston Montgomery | 16 | 10154738540853675_10154739085228675 | When will we get it? A popular vote is just the inverse of the Electoral College--instead of focusing on a handful of states like Florida, Pennsylvania, and New Hampshire, candidates will only focus on states where most people live like CA, TX, and New York; and if you're a Republican in particular that should concern you.If we want real voting reform, we need to replace the current plurality, first-past-the-post voting system with ranked voting, instant runoffs, and a strict majority. That's how you get candidates to pay attention to the entire electorate.
2 | Sean Kelly | 23 | 10154738540853675_10154739073423675 | A democracy is the rule of majority.  The US is *not* a democracy; rather a republic based on the rule of law.  The word, "democracy" purposely does not appear in the Declaration of Independence, the US Constitution or any of the 50 state constitutions.The EC was purposely constructed by our Founding Fathers because they didn't want a democracy which are rife with whims and shortsighted political fads.The rule of law always trumps majority rule and our Founders presciently understood this.
3 | Evangeline Howard | 3 | 10154738540853675_10154739213178675 | This will diminish the power of the states, which is the intention. The founders wished local interests to have a stronger influence over federal power. This move takes control over government away from the governed, and is a mistake.
4 | Eric Jacobs | 2 | 10154738540853675_10154739109918675 | I'ts DEFINITELY time to revamp our voting system - the current electoral system made sense in the 1800s when communications were slow and distances great, but not any more.
5 | Christopher Brummet | 0 | 10154738540853675_10154739140673675 | Sorry but do not want California,New York,Illonios,Texas and Florida be the main states that pick our president most of those states do not agree with there views. The system is fine just think they want the change cause it wouldinsure the Democratic party would win all the time with the laws in some of these states. Sorry but we all should know why the Democratic party loves open borders cause eighty out of ten immagrants vote for them. They want to flood America to make sure they never lose just like this idea would be in there favor.
6 | Carole Banks | 0 | 10154738540853675_10154740906938675 | Then states with smaller populations would effectively have no voice at all.  Elections would be won by people in California, Florida and New York.  North Dakota would have no input at all, for example.  But with the electoral college, they do.
7 | Donna Demmin Church | 0 | 10154738540853675_10154740939723675 | As a New Yorker who has always voted in primaries as well as elections I'm beginning to wonder now 'whats the sense'. Oh to be sure, I will cast a vote tomorrow because as an American citizen it is my right. I just feel it is a senseless endeavor at this point. I mean I don't live in Pa, Fl, or any of these other 'swing states', so why bother? My vote does not count as much as theirs. As a WASP from the non-swing state of NY I feel I'm just going to be going through the motions. Do popular votes count? Do our votes matter? This last year has been a sickening, eye-opener to this America we live in. I'm not so proud anymore and that will stand no matter which of these people wins. God Bless America.
8 | Dustin Baugh | 0 | 10154738540853675_10154739290118675 | Popular vote probably wouldn't break us out of the 2 party system or slice into the fierce partisan contrasts we en up with. With the technology we have we can do better. Possibly a run off system combined with a popular vote so you could choose from multiple candidates that represent your interests and still not have to worry about throwing your vote away.The Bernie Sanders, Ted Cruz, Jill Stein, and Gary Johnsons would still be in play all election and if your 1st choice for president doesn't make it, we could all agree that your second choice is good too.
9 | Sj Lag | 0 | 10154738540853675_10154739082748675 | Could be like the Primaries and do it proportionally for each state ie: 30,35,10,10,5...Everybody gets an elector. Better for third and fourth parties. Keep the 269, each state is in play no more fly overs.
10 | Brett H Hunter | 1 | 10154738540853675_10154739115238675 | It's simple one person one vote. Unfortunately as long as the electoral college appears to favor one party, it won't change.
11 | Bruce Terry | 1 | 10154738540853675_10154739033838675 | It depends if it is the "popular vote" or the vote as reflected by the electors of each state.  It would make the campaign process much different if it was just a national vote.

Anybody born in the USA is automatically a citizen. China will undoubtedly take the oportunity to send as many immigrants as needed to put up shop in the USA.  They will copy the latino presedent of voting power and take it to a new level.  Once they have enough voters, they will make way to the whitehouse. Lobbying in Congress will be as strong as the NRA, Wall Street, Big Corporations. The national debt will be so high it will be impossible to pay thereby further weakening the economy.  By that time China will have landed on the moon and lay a claim of sovereignity there. The Chinese Armed forces will be more powerful than the USA.  They will have Thailand and Hong Kong.Democrats will have no option but to accept the chinese voters who will move up the ranks outnumbering latinos and other ethnic groups. Once in Congress and the Whitehouse there will be changes favorable to china.  All this power grabbing by the present Democrats will be for nothing.All will be lost.

16 | Mur Bally | 1 | 10154738540853675_10154739158018675 | Well it looks like a well orchestrated scheme, the recent FBI Investigation.

The only thing left to do is for citizens of the World to then Petition the World Courts to look into the Corrupt Clinton Foundation. It now looks like it is out side the hands of the US Government!

Obama and Lynch clearly pressured Comey. They think we watch their dancing puppets and change our mind based on what they tell us. The fact remains that the emails exist and there are sick revelations of what she and the people she surrounds herself with. My resolve against her is stronger than ever because, not in spite of, this.

Some academics say the Electoral College is inextricable from the history of slavery in the U.S.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Sean Kelly | 48 | 10154738879568675_10154738994753675 | With all due respect, you are interviewing a Canadian scholar to understand Americanism? ü§îA democracy is the rule of majority.  The US is *not* a democracy; rather a republic based on the rule of law.  The word, "democracy" purposely does not appear in the Declaration of Independence, the US Constitution or any of the 50 state constitutions.The EC was purposely constructed by our Founding Fathers because they didn't want a democracy.

2 | Chris Hottensen | 16 | 10154738879568675_10154739029578675 | If electoral college disappears, so will democracy. All candidates will have to do is court votes in the biggest cities and completely ignore rural states. Unless you live in Chicago, new York, los angeles, Houston or other huge cities, your vote will not matter to the candidates. If you want your vote to count, keep the electoral college.
3 | David Elmore | 7 | 10154738879568675_10154739049503675 | Our founding fathers didn't want bellicose blow hards to waltz in to America and take over like the tyrants of ancient Greece because the demogogues were able to bedazzle an unwitting and uninformed general public. That's what I learned in high school civics class.
4 | Todd Hansen | 5 | 10154738879568675_10154739630473675 | The Electoral College helps to ensure that smaller states have a voice. When the Constitution was drafted, state's rights were important to the founders. They didn't want a few large states dominating the political system. Currently, the fewest states one can win and still carry the Electoral College is 11, but those states would represent 57 percent of the population.
5 | Melissa Sailors | 3 | 10154738879568675_10154739381003675 | Yep, I used to question the electoral college, but after this election, I realized we still need it because we keep failing to learn the same lessons over and over and over again.
6 | John Gisondi | 5 | 10154738879568675_10154738966153675 | The structure of the Electoral College can be traced to the Centurial Assembly system of the Roman Republic. Under that system, the adult male citizens of Rome were divided, according to their wealth, into groups of 100 (called Centuries). Each group of 100 was entitled to cast only one vote either in favor or against proposals submitted to them by the Roman Senate. In the Electoral College system, the States serve as the Centurial groups (though they are not, of course, based on wealth), and the number of votes per State is determined by the size of each State's Congressional delegation. Still, the two systems are similar in design and share many of the same advantages and disadvantages. The similarities between the Electoral College and classical institutions are not accidental. Many of the Founding Fathers were well schooled in ancient history and its lessons. http://uselectionatlas.org/INFORMATION/INFORMATION/electcollege_history.php
7 | Nicholas Kavic | 3 | 10154738879568675_10154739491018675 | Voter ID laws aren't racist. Nations all over the globe have those laws. In India, there is widespread poverty and yet all of their poor have IDs to vote as do their wealthy. The purpose is to prevent fraud and corruption.
8 | Jason McHugh | 0 | 10154738879568675_10154739990683675 | What percentage of Constitutional scholars? The same number of scientists  that deny climate change is real?The argument and reasons are weak. Of course the south didn't want to lose power, hence the 3/5 compromise.The electoral college was put there because the founders didn't trust the unwashed masses. Used to think they were wrong, now I think they might be right.Whether or not it was in there wouldn't have made one difference to slavery, because the same people would have won the popular vote.The only time the popular vote and the electoral college didn't match was 1824, and a couple times after the civil war 1876 and 1888.No differences would have been made.
9 | Kurt Rex Cooper | 0 | 10154738879568675_10154739155848675 | It would not surprise me if it was, I am of the opinion one important reason the South joined the North to rebel was that the South figured British Empire would abolish slavery sooner than later (which it did in 1833) and wanted to preserve it.
10 | Tyler Dragoni | 3 | 10154738879568675_10154739335218675 | Awful idea. Following Maine and Nebraska's lead, winner by Congressional District would be fairer, need no cooperation from other states or a Constitutional amendment. No more 'swing states' but gerrymandering would have to be solved.

12 | John Weese | 0 | 10154738879568675_10154741735643675 | "The fact that the Electoral College was originally designed to solve one set of problems but today serves to solve an entirely different set of problems is a tribute to the genius of the Founding Fathers."
13 | Zach Bernstein | 4 | 10154738879568675_10154739484678675 | Vestige of slavery or not, it's an un-democratic (small-d) system of deciding who leads the country. The fact that you can get the second-most number of votes and still be elected is enough to provide that.
14 | Jim Pasterczyk | 2 | 10154738879568675_10154739451723675 | Well A), it does give disproportionate political power to states with small populations, at that time of white males, and B) I think by now we've pretty much solved the major issues with respect to counting votes quickly and correctly so that the overall mood of the country can be gauged properly, haven't we?
15 | Ben Hardin | 0 | 10154738879568675_10154739536153675 | I'm neither strongly for nor strongly against eliminating the Electoral College (EC).  There are more important fish to fry.  Results of elections seldom are any different regardless of whether EC is operative and in those cases where they are different the popular vote is almost a tie.  I mildly favor eliminating the EC simply to pave the way for comprehensive electoral reforms.  I presented an alternative to both the EC and popular vote in the July 17 posting on the Facebook page Electoral Reform for a More Favorable Congress.
16 | Daniel P. B. Smith | 0 | 10154738879568675_10154741202833675 | There are a lot of vestiges of slavery. I'm only learning about them a bit at a time. For example, the cod that hangs in the State House is there because the commercial wealth of Massachusetts was founded on supplying cost-effective, shelf-stable, nourishing food to slaves on Caribbean plantations.
17 | Allen Hermann | 1 | 10154738879568675_10154739353608675 | I believe that the advent of electronic communications,has rendered the Electoral College redundant, there is for sake of argument no more rural communities everybody's connected with the exception of a few Luddite types!
18 | Tim Craig | 0 | 10154738879568675_10154739344458675 | Seems more likely that the conventional wisdom is correct in the car of the electoral college. That its there as a safeguard against a charismatic dictator type (I figure the likes of Napoleon) being popularly elected.
19 | Kevin Lock | 1 | 10154738879568675_10154739563398675 | With facial recognition and technology we have today, WHY do we need to overpay people who "say" they represent us? I am quite capable of speaking for myself and many homeless people could live on what that dead weight is being paid!
20 | Ed Weigandt | 1 | 10154738879568675_10154739079573675 | This is garbage. At the time, like it or not, slaves were not considered human, they were lawfully deemed as property. Also, like it or not, only white males of age were allowed to vote... then. What Madison was attempting to do was level the playing field. Madison knew the Northern States would out vote the Southern, leaving the Southern States with little to no Representation. What he did was make all States equal based on the State(s) population via a ratio formula. Furthermore, they did not have the internet, nor cell phones... no modern communications. They had horse and buggy, no planes, no cars. It would take time to cast, collect and count the vote. It would be far easier for the Electoral College votes to be counted and announced in the Senate, than the ballots of the popular vote. If you recall, all States in the Senate have to give their final vote tally in the Senate for the election results to become official. Far easier to count 4 votes vs 4,000 on the floor of the Senate and announce such. With that said, if you want to do away with the electoral college vote, as do I, then do so in a proper manner, stop tying everything to slavery and/or racism.

We should be striking unions with Canada and South America rather than sustaining an outdated union of states.
