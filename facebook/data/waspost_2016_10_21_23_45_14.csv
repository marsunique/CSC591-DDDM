Remember when Hillary told everyone she did not remember getting training on classified material. Well here she is making an instructional videohttp://www.foxnews.com/.../clinton-lectured-state-dept...#http://www.usatoday.com/.../clinton-told-fbi-she.../89651862

4 | Rebecca Laskey | 10154752555829729_10154754079604729 | SO THE NARCISSISTIC PATHOLOGICAL SERIAL LIAR, THE GUY WHO ASSAULTS, RAPES AND DEMEANS WOMEN ASKS: "WHAT THE HELL DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE"???As a Black, Muslim, Gay AND A Woman. EVERYTHING!!Here is why:1. The misogynistic pathetic small man has shown over and over again throughout his life he has zero respect for women. He has said cringe worthy horrible/outrageous things about women all his life. He has consistently insulted, belittled, sexualized, and stereotyped women. Such insecure small man with zero respect for women and their contributions to our society should have NO place holding the highest office in the land. And he has promised to nominate conservative justices who will limit women's reproductive rights & women's ability to make informed decisions about their own bodies. This is a man who believes women should be "punished" for having an abortion. And he promised to overturn Roe vs. Wade if he gets elected. Just a little history here: "In the 1950s, estimates of numbers of illegal, unsafe abortions ranged widely, from 200,000 to 1.2 million per year. The methods used were often ineffective and dangerous. Desperate women were driven into the back alley, where they endured danger and abuse, sometimes sexual." Access to safe, legal abortion saves women's lives. The reality is there‚Äôs no such thing as no abortion. Just safe & unsafe. As a woman I can NOT afford to have a president who will take us back decades on the progress we made on women's rights. So as a woman I have everything to lose. 2.  I was raised in a Muslim family, even though I no longer consider myself a practicing Muslim. So that xenophobic con man's hate-filled rhetoric is a direct attack on my family and I. So as a Muslim American, I can NOT have afforded to have a president as hateful and careless as him. This country does NOT afford to have a man whose xenophobic rhetoric is feeding terrorist groups like ISIS's recruitment videos. A man whose hate-filled rhetoric terrorist experts believe is detrimental to the counterterrorism and anti- terrorism missions around the world. History shows a leader who believe people should be treated differently based on their religion is dangerous. So as a Muslim American I have everything to lose. 3. As a black person I can NOT afford to have a racist person who refused to disavow Ku Klux Klan as a president. A person who was the leading voice of the ‚Äúbirther‚Äù movement, a racist effort to try to delegitimize the nation's first black president. A racist person who ignored Fair Housing Act and let his employees mark applications of minorities with a 'C' for 'Colored' & refused to rent or negotiate rentals ‚Äúbecause of race and color.‚Äù A racist person whose campaign is attracting scary number of neo-Nazi white supremacist organizations. A racist man whose campaign selected white nationalist leader as a delegate. A racist man who hired Breitbart News executive chairman Steve Bannon, a leader of white supremacist group as his campaign CEO signaling his campaign is fully embracing the white supremacist alt-right & all their race-baiting ideas. A racist person whose campaign rallies looks like a klan gathering. On top of that he promised to nominate conservative justices who will take us back decades on voting rights. So as a black American I have everything to lose. 4. As a lesbian I can NOT afforded to have a president who does NOT think I should marry whoever my heart desire. The LGBT community has made historic progress in the past few years, I cannot afford to have a president who will destroy all those progresses by nominating conservative justices who will turn the clock back years. So as a gay citizen, I have everything to lose. 5. As a proud citizen of this great country who believes in American values I can NOT afford to have a self-serving, greedy, pathological liar, con-man who is walking all over those values as a president. To the white people who are not motivated by hate and resentment but still support Trump, I as a minority would like to ask you to think about how Trump's presidency affect me and people like me. I would like to sincerely ask you to reconsider your support for him. Please. To the people who are planning to vote for a third party candidate: I would like to ask you to think really, really hard. Especially, if you care about progressive ideas and believe Trump presidency will take us back decades on the progress we have made on women issues, LGBT issues...etc. The fact is we are a two-party system, Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump will be America's next president. Period! And your vote could decide the next President. Simply put, a vote that is not for Hillary is directly or indirectly a vote for Trump. Just as a note, I am NOT saying Hillary is perfect or doesn't come with a lot of baggage. So if you believe the con-man is unqualified, temperamentally unfit, and dangerous please reconsider voting for Hillary Clinton and vote blue up and down the ballot.Trump and Pence show extreme contempt towards Gays, LGBT and LGBTQ.  Both on are record as being ANTI-GAY!A vote for Trump is a lost vote - he will not become the next president of The United States of America!It is paramount that The President of The United States of America is a sane, intelligent, curious, controlled person, who is a reliable, detail-oriented, steadfast, cautious and methodical person without whom organizations and society would dissolve (fall apart). Hillary fits the aforementioned description! She is a woman, who can keep her cool!Trump on the other hand is non-reflecting and ruthless character, who lacks emphatic traits under non-sexual circumstances. He is extremely nervous and very emotional driven. He completely lacks self-knowledge! He is little bothered by second thoughts and self-doubt. That doesn't mean he is smart but that he is rather dumb. His knowledge is in general extremely limited. Since he does not reflect on his errors or analyze any mistakes to any great extent - Trump is incapable to learn from his errors, and so he will be caught in a loop, repeating his mistakes, which can have catastrophic consequences for the US, the rest of the world and possible beyond depending on the nature of his actions.In all fairness in the Vice Presidential debate Tuesday night, October 4, 2016, Mike Pence acted far more "vice presidential" than Tim Kaine, who was rude and insulting as well as he was talking over Mike Pence, who just had to sit there and take it.HOWEVER, Trump would still do the right thing if he voluntarily steps down from the presidential election campaign. Whether he steps down or not he will not be elected as the next President of The United States of America!DONALD TRUMP TRIED TO FIRE NANCY O‚ÄôDELL AFTER SHE REJECTED HIS ADVANCES!  HOW COME HE HASN‚ÄôT APOLOGIZED TO HER?  HIS APOLOGY MEANS NOTHING !!!PROMINATE GOP LEADERS ARE DITCHING DONALD TRUMP IS DROVES.  THE RNC STOPS WORK ON THE ‚ÄúVICTORY‚Äù PROJECT AND PULLS FUNDING FOR DONALD TRUMP !!!DONALD TRUMP RAPED HIS 1ST WIFE, IVANA.  THAT IS DOCUMENTED IN HER BOOK THE (LOST TYCOON).DONALD TRUMP RAPED A 13-YEAR-OLD CHILD AND THE FEDERAL CASE IS PENDING IN NEW YORK.  HE HELD HER AGAINST HER WILL AND RAPED HER REPEATEDLY‚Ä¶‚Ä¶THERE IS A WITNESS‚Ä¶..TRUMP THINKS THAT BECAUSE HE IS A ‚ÄúSTAR‚Äù THAT HE CAN GET AWAY WITH ANYTHING‚Ä¶.HE IS A ‚ÄúSEXUAL PREDATOR‚Äù, WHO NEEDS TO BE BROUGHT TO JUSTICE.  TELL YOUR MOTHERS, YOUR SISTERS AND YOUR DAUGHTERS, NOT TO VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP!!!TRUMP IS ON RECORD, IN SUPPORT OF BILL CLINTON DURING THE WHITE HOUSE SCANDAL‚Ä¶BILL CLINTON NEVER RAPED ANYONE!LEST NOT FORGET, HILLARY AND CHELSEA WERE THE VICTIMS OF BILL‚ÄôS INDESCRETIONS‚Ä¶BILL CLINTON IS NOT ON THE BALLOT !!! TRUMP THE SERIAL ABUSER/GROPER, SEXUAL PREDATOR, PEDOPHILE AND RAPIST IS !!! #NeverTrumpPence#NoTaxesNoVote#TrumpTheRapistAndPedophile
5 | Rebecca Laskey | 10154752555829729_10154754079039729 | HARVARD HAS BROKEN A 128-YEAR OF VOTING REPUBLICAN, BECAUSE OF TRUMP!Dear Members and Alumni,In every presidential election since 1888, the members and Executive Board of the Harvard Republican Club have gathered to discuss, debate, and eventually endorse the standard-bearer of our party. But for the first time in 128 years, we, the oldest College Republicans chapter in the nation, will not be endorsing the Republican nominee.Donald Trump holds views that are antithetical to our values not only as Republicans, but as Americans. The rhetoric he espouses ‚Äìfrom racist slander to misogynistic taunts‚Äì is not consistent with our conservative principles, and his repeated mocking of the disabled and belittling of the sacrifices made by prisoners of war, Gold Star families, and Purple Heart recipients is not only bad politics, but absurdly cruel.If enacted, Donald Trump‚Äôs platform would endanger our security both at home and abroad. Domestically, his protectionist trade policies and draconian immigration restrictions would enlarge our federal deficit, raise prices for consumers, and throw our economy back into recession. Trump‚Äôs global outlook, steeped in isolationism, is considerably out-of-step with the traditional Republican stance as well. The flippancy with which he is willing to abdicate the United States‚Äô responsibility to lead is alarming. Calling for the US‚Äô withdrawal from NATO and actively endorsing nuclear proliferation, Donald Trump‚Äôs foreign policy would wreak havoc on the established world order which has held aggressive foreign powers in check since World War II.Perhaps most importantly, however, Donald Trump simply does not possess the temperament and character necessary to lead the United States through an increasingly perilous world. The last week should have made obvious to all what has been obvious to most for more than a year. In response to any slight ‚Äìperceived or real‚Äì Donald Trump lashes out viciously and irresponsibly. In Trump‚Äôs eyes, disagreement with his actions or his policies warrants incessant name calling and derision: stupid, lying, fat, ugly, weak, failing, idiot ‚Äìand that‚Äôs just his ‚Äúfellow‚Äù Republicans.He isn‚Äôt eschewing political correctness. He is eschewing basic human decency.Donald Trump, despite spending more than a year on the campaign trail, has either refused or been unable to educate himself on issues that matter most to Americans like us. He speaks only in platitudes, about greatness, success, and winning. Time and time again, Trump has demonstrated his complete lack of knowledge on critical matters, meandering from position to position over the course of the election. When confronted about these frequent reversals, Trump lies in a manner more brazen and shameless than anything politics has ever seen.Millions of people across the country are feeling despondent. Their hours have been cut, wages slashed, jobs even shipped overseas. But Donald Trump doesn‚Äôt have a plan to fix that. He has a plan to exploit that.Donald Trump is a threat to the survival of the Republic. His authoritarian tendencies and flirtations with fascism are unparalleled in the history of our democracy. He hopes to divide us by race, by class, and by religion, instilling enough fear and anxiety to propel himself to the White House. He is looking to to pit neighbor against neighbor, friend against friend, American against American. We will not stand for this vitriolic rhetoric that is poisoning our country and our children. President Reagan called on us to maintain this, our shining city on a hill. He called on us to maintain freedom abroad by keeping a strong presence in the world. He called on us to maintain liberty at home by upholding the democratic process and respecting our opponents. He called on us to maintain decency in our hearts by loving our neighbor.He would be ashamed of Donald Trump. We are too. This fall, we will instead focus our efforts on reclaiming the Republican Party from those who have done it considerable harm, campaigning for candidates who will uphold the conservative principles that have defined the Republican Party for generations. We will work to ensure both chambers of Congress remain in Republican hands, continuing to protect against executive overreach regardless of who wins the election this November.We call on our party‚Äôs elected leaders to renounce their support of Donald Trump, and urge our fellow College Republicans to join us in condemning and withholding their endorsement from this dangerous man. The conservative movement in America should not and will not go quietly into the night.A longtime student of American democracy, Alexis de Tocqueville once said, ‚ÄúAmerica is great because she is good. If America ceases to be good, America will cease to be great.‚Äù De Tocqueville believed in the United States. Americans are a decent people. We work hard, protect our own, and look out for one another in times of need, regardless of the color of our skin, the God we worship, or our party registration. Donald Trump may not believe in that America, but we do. And that America will never cease to be great.HILLARY CLINTON CANNOT TAKE AWAY SECOND AMENDMENT GUN RIGHTS WITHOUT APPROVAL OF CONGRESS.  HILLARY DOES NOT WANT TO ABOLISH YOUR 2ND AMENDMENT.  ANOTHER TRUMP LIE.AMERICA IS ALREADY GOOD AND WE ARE BETTER THAN DONALD TRUMP!REGISTER AND VOTE BLUE UP AND DOWN THE BALLOT.1st DEBATE ~ EPIC FAILURE ON DONALD TRUMP‚ÄôS PART!  AND THIS GUY WANTS TO BE PRESIDENT???  I DON‚ÄôT THINK SO!  HILLARY CLEARLY WON THE DEBATE, HANDS DOWN!!!2ND DEBATE ~ WOO, WHAT A DISASTER.  TRUMP STALKED HILLARY ON STAGE AND WAS OUT OF CONTROL.  NEEDS TO PUT DOWN HE CRACK PIPE FOR AWHILE.  HILLARY WINS THIS ONE TOO.3RD AND FINAL DEBATE.  IS TRUMP OFF HIS MEDS?  TRUMP IS THE KNOWS NOTHING CANDIDATE.  THE ONLY THING HE KNOWS, IS HOW TO LIE.  HE DOES THAT QUITE WELL.  THIS IS A SICK MAN.  HILLARY TAKES ALL.#NeverTrumPutin#NoTaxesNoVote#NeverTrumpPence

TRUMP FAMILY CHARITIES!CROOKED DONALD TRUMP AND THE TRUMP CRIME FAMILY Spent more than a quarter-million dollars from his charitable foundation to settle lawsuits that involved the billionaire‚Äôs for-profit businesses, according to interviews and a review of legal documents.Those cases, which together used $258,000 from Trump‚Äôs charity, were among four newly documented expenditures in which Trump may have violated laws against ‚Äúself-dealing‚Äù ‚Äî which prohibit nonprofit leaders from using charity money to benefit themselves or their businesses.In one case, from 2007, Trump‚Äôs Mar-a-Lago Club faced $120,000 in unpaid fines from the town of Palm Beach, Fla., resulting from a dispute over the size of a flagpole.In a settlement, Palm Beach agreed to waive those fines ‚Äî if Trump‚Äôs club made a $100,000 donation to a specific charity for veterans. Instead, Trump sent a check from the Donald J. Trump Foundation, a charity funded almost entirely by other people‚Äôs money, according to tax records.In another case, court papers say one of Trump‚Äôs golf courses in New York agreed to settle a lawsuit by making a donation to the plaintiff‚Äôs chosen charity. A $158,000 donation was made by the Trump Foundation, according to tax records.According to the report, Trump used Trump Foundation money, that would be money that was donated by other people to his charitable foundation to do charitable stuff, to pay for debts owed by Trump's personal businesses. This, however, is in keeping with Trump using Trump Foundation money for a political donation to Florida's Attorney General and to buy a portrait of him for his personal use. These all are covered by the IRS regulations prohibiting "self-dealing" by charitable organizations.New Information:  Trump asks those who owe him money to send it to his Trump Charity to avoid paying taxes on it.UPDATE: TRUMP DOES NOT HAVE THE PROPER CERTIFICATION TO SOLICIT OUTSIDE DONORS!  ANYTHING OVER $25,000 REQUIRES AN AUDIT ACCORDING TO THE NEW YORK AG.  UH OH‚Ä¶..TRUMP PAID $8.2 Million to Family Members/Businesses.  MONEY CAME FROM THOSE WHO CONTRIBUTE TO HIS CAMPAIGN.

While people still legally have one. Freedom of speech will soon be gone and the truth will go right with it. You think I'm wrong?

Even her close aides questioned her wisdom on accepting these funds so close to her campaign. http://nypost.com/2016/10/21/huma-on-hillarys-12m-morocco-fiasco-she-created-this-mess-and-she-knows-it/

They state that he is going to stop Muslims from coming to America that will harm us they say.They state that he is going to deport All undocumented workers.They feel that Trump is going to the great saviour.Donald is the "do as I say not as I do" candidate.He preaches buying American but he only buys from China.He tells us that our military leaders and leaders are weaker than Putin and others.Our military is the best in the world.Trump states he will deport but he hires undocumented workers and married one until he got her papers.He states that he will support small businesses buy he stiffed many small businesses to the point they had to sue.He criticizes our military and doesn't support ours financially nor pride in us being number 1.He attacks Bill Clinton for affairs and Trump can't keep his hands off of married women.He is the. "Do as I say not as I do."

Hillary Clinton will never be president and will go to jail for her crimes. The Democrats must be the delusional people on the planet. All that education and still dumber than a bag of hammers.

10 | Frances Scott | 10154752574264729_10154753012779729 | Keeping a Lid on Bill's "Bimbo Eruptions"Hillary dismissed revelations of Bill's many infidelities as part of a "vast right wing conspiracy" to smear Bill Clinton's character.  So the Clintons hired private detectives to dig up dirt against Bill's female accusers.  Clinton advisor James Carville once famously said of Paula Jones and Bill's other female accusers.  "If you drag a $100 bill through a trailer park, you never know what you'll find."  Virtually all of Bill's female targets were audited by the IRS, including Gennifer Flowers, Liz Ward Gracen, Paula Jones, Juanita Broaddrick and Kathleen Willey.  The Clintons' vilifying, stalking and targeting these women with IRS audits and smears against their character was all part of a carefully planned strategy to terrify these women into silence.  Clinton political operative Betsy Wright worried in 1992 about what she called Bill's constant "bimbo eruptions" derailing his 1992 Presidential campaign.  Betsy Wright and Hillary were consumed with silencing these "bimbo eruptions" at all costs.  When Bill was governor, Hillary sent out a group of investigators known as the "Truth Squad" to discourage many of her husband's lovers from going public.  The real "war on women" has been conducted by the Bill and Hillary Clinton political machine.

1 | John Davidson | 10154752178209729_10154752479704729 | One human, one registered vote. Why should you have to prove who your are. Didn't you already confirm by registering and showing up. VOTE BLUE!
2 | Joy Machacek | 10154752178209729_10154752498614729 | Hillary is bought and paid for by people who hate us. She could care less about Americans once she is in. More concerned with obligations to outsiders and POWER over all Americans.  WAKE UP AMERICA!!!!

15 | Eric Mbiu | 10154752178209729_1209624272443080 | The America you claim to love but buy chinese steel, you and Ivanka make clothes in Asia and Mexico, and the tune goes on.  I'd be with you if you lived up to your rhetoric...I'll take Hillary Clinton as she is in the Public eye and has done her part fighting for the people, even in the worst of times.  I can measure that...You on the other hand???
16 | Paul David Menser | 10154752178209729_10154752529984729 | In the future, Americans will revere Hillary Clinton the same way the English revere Elizabeth I.

It was supposed to be his opening joke, but it landed with such heavy bitterness that it prompted scattered, uncomfortable laughter.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Karl Druart | 10154752140474729_10154752363904729 | It was actually very funny, and WaPo is misleading everyone. He got booed when he said she was corrupt (which despite being true, might have been a bit inappropriate at a charity dinner).
2 | Bruce Moon | 10154752140474729_10154752439634729 | The Left and their propaganda machine like WaPo have always decreed, declared, and pronounced  that Christianity, communism, the west- all the things they hate so much- was ended---but it didn't. And it never will.
3 | Aurelio Carbone | 10154752140474729_10154752265124729 | Liberals and Progressives are mocking Trump for not blindly endorsing ‚ÄúMy establishment, right or wrong.‚Äù Why should Americans circle the wagons, even after criminal voter fraud, just because you and the rest of the threatened old order want to? We have been lied to about Benghazi, about systemic attacks on blacks by police, about Obamacare, about the rot in Washington and the collusion of the press. With your focus on salacious gutter stories, you miss the bigger message -- that this election is not about Trump, but rather about the honest concerns of American citizens who have been mocked and lied to for far too long. Yes, and that includes justified concerns about election rigging. We have been told Islamic jihad attacks have nothing to do with Islam, when we see they do. We‚Äôve been called racists, bigots, homophobes, misogynists when we‚Äôre not. We have been lied to about Obamacare and the honesty of our elected officials. Trump is the ONLY one with the courage to open these taboo subjects and many others. All the media spins are transparent, even to ‚Äúnon-educated deplorables‚Äù; their daily sniping attacks only fuel the righteous anger of Americans. The Advocacy Media does not grasp this and will be left scratching their collective heads when reporting Trump‚Äôs landslide victory in November."
4 | Beth Harris | 10154752140474729_10154752905454729 | After this ugly election race, Historic numbers of Americans will go and vote Nov 8. Trump will LOSE by a landslide then scream it's rigged, only to be proven wrong but the ranting & raving supports Trump end game: 1) launching a new 3rd party, the white Nationalist Front Party & 2) launching a new ultra right conservative Trump TV! #BreitbartStrategy
5 | Brenda Gayle Tucker | 10154752140474729_10154752549644729 | Well folks like watch all the debates etc. trying to support the next President like the most, I think the endorsement from the White Evangelists got me the most Trump why because to me this Man who has trashed Women, people of color etc. used bankrupticies around 6 times to screw small business putting some out of business using cheap labor immigrants, because the power of the purse says he could to dodge the draft and then brag on Howard Stern his Vietnam was sleeping around !! To have ties with Brigton Beach Russian Mobs, to brag about just because he could he didn't pay taxes for yrs. when knowing our Vets our infrastructure etc. need help?? Then he come up and brags about the White Evangelists endorses him over and over well voters when I read the Bible threw I read the cry of the poor and the greed that created the poor their is over 2,000 vs on this subject like (Have we withheld wages from workers which is due them?) James 5:4 ( Do we try to get rich by cheating others?) 1 Timothy 3:8 ( For the Love of Money ) 1 Timothy Luke 18:25 (For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. Matthew 6:24 (No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mannon. Like I said their is over 2,000 vs on this subject why 2,000 is the question for me and why has the White Evangelists endorse a Man who has not paid a living wage who has cheated other to get rich why? I guess the only answer that keep popping in my head over and over for the White Evangelists and Trump is The Love of Money Is The Root of All Evil !!
6 | Jack Carrenard | 10154752140474729_10154752156434729 | Cardinal Dolan is a big hypocrite. Where was this man of God when TRUMP was calling Catholic Mexicans rapists? The silence from the church was deafening.
7 | Theo B. Dierks | 10154752140474729_10154752886229729 | Trump is just not funny...and definitely not self-deprecating ever, so this must have been really challenging for him.
8 | Will Belmont | 10154752140474729_10154752191899729 | Hillary is the change we need Itll be good to have the Clintons back in office.
9 | Mike Ziccardi | 10154752140474729_10154753948869729 | The biggest joke of the night was this fat assed..pencil dick..who should have been arrested by homeland for iinvitiing Putin to hack our political system........
10 | Karen Musko | 10154752140474729_10154753287184729 | For Donald, everything has to be about him.
11 | Walter Niewiadomski | 10154752140474729_10154753354504729 | Trump defied the tradition of light-hearted self-deprecating humor.

17 | Rebecca Laskey | 10154752140474729_10154754098309729 | SO THE NARCISSISTIC PATHOLOGICAL SERIAL LIAR, THE GUY WHO ASSAULTS, RAPES AND DEMEANS WOMEN ASKS: "WHAT THE HELL DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE"???As a Black, Muslim, Gay AND A Woman. EVERYTHING!!Here is why:1. The misogynistic pathetic small man has shown over and over again throughout his life he has zero respect for women. He has said cringe worthy horrible/outrageous things about women all his life. He has consistently insulted, belittled, sexualized, and stereotyped women. Such insecure small man with zero respect for women and their contributions to our society should have NO place holding the highest office in the land. And he has promised to nominate conservative justices who will limit women's reproductive rights & women's ability to make informed decisions about their own bodies. This is a man who believes women should be "punished" for having an abortion. And he promised to overturn Roe vs. Wade if he gets elected. Just a little history here: "In the 1950s, estimates of numbers of illegal, unsafe abortions ranged widely, from 200,000 to 1.2 million per year. The methods used were often ineffective and dangerous. Desperate women were driven into the back alley, where they endured danger and abuse, sometimes sexual." Access to safe, legal abortion saves women's lives. The reality is there‚Äôs no such thing as no abortion. Just safe & unsafe. As a woman I can NOT afford to have a president who will take us back decades on the progress we made on women's rights. So as a woman I have everything to lose. 2.  I was raised in a Muslim family, even though I no longer consider myself a practicing Muslim. So that xenophobic con man's hate-filled rhetoric is a direct attack on my family and I. So as a Muslim American, I can NOT have afforded to have a president as hateful and careless as him. This country does NOT afford to have a man whose xenophobic rhetoric is feeding terrorist groups like ISIS's recruitment videos. A man whose hate-filled rhetoric terrorist experts believe is detrimental to the counterterrorism and anti- terrorism missions around the world. History shows a leader who believe people should be treated differently based on their religion is dangerous. So as a Muslim American I have everything to lose. 3. As a black person I can NOT afford to have a racist person who refused to disavow Ku Klux Klan as a president. A person who was the leading voice of the ‚Äúbirther‚Äù movement, a racist effort to try to delegitimize the nation's first black president. A racist person who ignored Fair Housing Act and let his employees mark applications of minorities with a 'C' for 'Colored' & refused to rent or negotiate rentals ‚Äúbecause of race and color.‚Äù A racist person whose campaign is attracting scary number of neo-Nazi white supremacist organizations. A racist man whose campaign selected white nationalist leader as a delegate. A racist man who hired Breitbart News executive chairman Steve Bannon, a leader of white supremacist group as his campaign CEO signaling his campaign is fully embracing the white supremacist alt-right & all their race-baiting ideas. A racist person whose campaign rallies looks like a klan gathering. On top of that he promised to nominate conservative justices who will take us back decades on voting rights. So as a black American I have everything to lose. 4. As a lesbian I can NOT afforded to have a president who does NOT think I should marry whoever my heart desire. The LGBT community has made historic progress in the past few years, I cannot afford to have a president who will destroy all those progresses by nominating conservative justices who will turn the clock back years. So as a gay citizen, I have everything to lose. 5. As a proud citizen of this great country who believes in American values I can NOT afford to have a self-serving, greedy, pathological liar, con-man who is walking all over those values as a president. To the white people who are not motivated by hate and resentment but still support Trump, I as a minority would like to ask you to think about how Trump's presidency affect me and people like me. I would like to sincerely ask you to reconsider your support for him. Please. To the people who are planning to vote for a third party candidate: I would like to ask you to think really, really hard. Especially, if you care about progressive ideas and believe Trump presidency will take us back decades on the progress we have made on women issues, LGBT issues...etc. The fact is we are a two-party system, Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump will be America's next president. Period! And your vote could decide the next President. Simply put, a vote that is not for Hillary is directly or indirectly a vote for Trump. Just as a note, I am NOT saying Hillary is perfect or doesn't come with a lot of baggage. So if you believe the con-man is unqualified, temperamentally unfit, and dangerous please reconsider voting for Hillary Clinton and vote blue up and down the ballot.Trump and Pence show extreme contempt towards Gays, LGBT and LGBTQ.  Both on are record as being ANTI-GAY!A vote for Trump is a lost vote - he will not become the next president of The United States of America!It is paramount that The President of The United States of America is a sane, intelligent, curious, controlled person, who is a reliable, detail-oriented, steadfast, cautious and methodical person without whom organizations and society would dissolve (fall apart). Hillary fits the aforementioned description! She is a woman, who can keep her cool!Trump on the other hand is non-reflecting and ruthless character, who lacks emphatic traits under non-sexual circumstances. He is extremely nervous and very emotional driven. He completely lacks self-knowledge! He is little bothered by second thoughts and self-doubt. That doesn't mean he is smart but that he is rather dumb. His knowledge is in general extremely limited. Since he does not reflect on his errors or analyze any mistakes to any great extent - Trump is incapable to learn from his errors, and so he will be caught in a loop, repeating his mistakes, which can have catastrophic consequences for the US, the rest of the world and possible beyond depending on the nature of his actions.In all fairness in the Vice Presidential debate Tuesday night, October 4, 2016, Mike Pence acted far more "vice presidential" than Tim Kaine, who was rude and insulting as well as he was talking over Mike Pence, who just had to sit there and take it.HOWEVER, Trump would still do the right thing if he voluntarily steps down from the presidential election campaign. Whether he steps down or not he will not be elected as the next President of The United States of America!DONALD TRUMP TRIED TO FIRE NANCY O‚ÄôDELL AFTER SHE REJECTED HIS ADVANCES!  HOW COME HE HASN‚ÄôT APOLOGIZED TO HER?  HIS APOLOGY MEANS NOTHING !!!PROMINATE GOP LEADERS ARE DITCHING DONALD TRUMP IS DROVES.

18 | Rebecca Laskey | 10154752140474729_10154754098024729 | HARVARD HAS BROKEN A 128-YEAR OF VOTING REPUBLICAN, BECAUSE OF TRUMP!Dear Members and Alumni,In every presidential election since 1888, the members and Executive Board of the Harvard Republican Club have gathered to discuss, debate, and eventually endorse the standard-bearer of our party. But for the first time in 128 years, we, the oldest College Republicans chapter in the nation, will not be endorsing the Republican nominee.Donald Trump holds views that are antithetical to our values not only as Republicans, but as Americans. The rhetoric he espouses ‚Äìfrom racist slander to misogynistic taunts‚Äì is not consistent with our conservative principles, and his repeated mocking of the disabled and belittling of the sacrifices made by prisoners of war, Gold Star families, and Purple Heart recipients is not only bad politics, but absurdly cruel.If enacted, Donald Trump‚Äôs platform would endanger our security both at home and abroad. Domestically, his protectionist trade policies and draconian immigration restrictions would enlarge our federal deficit, raise prices for consumers, and throw our economy back into recession. Trump‚Äôs global outlook, steeped in isolationism, is considerably out-of-step with the traditional Republican stance as well. The flippancy with which he is willing to abdicate the United States‚Äô responsibility to lead is alarming. Calling for the US‚Äô withdrawal from NATO and actively endorsing nuclear proliferation, Donald Trump‚Äôs foreign policy would wreak havoc on the established world order which has held aggressive foreign powers in check since World War II.Perhaps most importantly, however, Donald Trump simply does not possess the temperament and character necessary to lead the United States through an increasingly perilous world. The last week should have made obvious to all what has been obvious to most for more than a year. In response to any slight ‚Äìperceived or real‚Äì Donald Trump lashes out viciously and irresponsibly. In Trump‚Äôs eyes, disagreement with his actions or his policies warrants incessant name calling and derision: stupid, lying, fat, ugly, weak, failing, idiot ‚Äìand that‚Äôs just his ‚Äúfellow‚Äù Republicans.He isn‚Äôt eschewing political correctness. He is eschewing basic human decency.Donald Trump, despite spending more than a year on the campaign trail, has either refused or been unable to educate himself on issues that matter most to Americans like us. He speaks only in platitudes, about greatness, success, and winning. Time and time again, Trump has demonstrated his complete lack of knowledge on critical matters, meandering from position to position over the course of the election. When confronted about these frequent reversals, Trump lies in a manner more brazen and shameless than anything politics has ever seen.Millions of people across the country are feeling despondent. Their hours have been cut, wages slashed, jobs even shipped overseas. But Donald Trump doesn‚Äôt have a plan to fix that. He has a plan to exploit that.Donald Trump is a threat to the survival of the Republic. His authoritarian tendencies and flirtations with fascism are unparalleled in the history of our democracy. He hopes to divide us by race, by class, and by religion, instilling enough fear and anxiety to propel himself to the White House. He is looking to to pit neighbor against neighbor, friend against friend, American against American. We will not stand for this vitriolic rhetoric that is poisoning our country and our children. President Reagan called on us to maintain this, our shining city on a hill. He called on us to maintain freedom abroad by keeping a strong presence in the world. He called on us to maintain liberty at home by upholding the democratic process and respecting our opponents. He called on us to maintain decency in our hearts by loving our neighbor.He would be ashamed of Donald Trump. We are too. This fall, we will instead focus our efforts on reclaiming the Republican Party from those who have done it considerable harm, campaigning for candidates who will uphold the conservative principles that have defined the Republican Party for generations. We will work to ensure both chambers of Congress remain in Republican hands, continuing to protect against executive overreach regardless of who wins the election this November.We call on our party‚Äôs elected leaders to renounce their support of Donald Trump, and urge our fellow College Republicans to join us in condemning and withholding their endorsement from this dangerous man. The conservative movement in America should not and will not go quietly into the night.A longtime student of American democracy, Alexis de Tocqueville once said, ‚ÄúAmerica is great because she is good. If America ceases to be good, America will cease to be great.‚Äù De Tocqueville believed in the United States. Americans are a decent people. We work hard, protect our own, and look out for one another in times of need, regardless of the color of our skin, the God we worship, or our party registration. Donald Trump may not believe in that America, but we do. And that America will never cease to be great.HILLARY CLINTON CANNOT TAKE AWAY SECOND AMENDMENT GUN RIGHTS WITHOUT APPROVAL OF CONGRESS.  HILLARY DOES NOT WANT TO ABOLISH YOUR 2ND AMENDMENT.  ANOTHER TRUMP LIE.AMERICA IS ALREADY GOOD AND WE ARE BETTER THAN DONALD TRUMP!REGISTER AND VOTE BLUE UP AND DOWN THE BALLOT.1st DEBATE ~ EPIC FAILURE ON DONALD TRUMP‚ÄôS PART!  AND THIS GUY WANTS TO BE PRESIDENT???  I DON‚ÄôT THINK SO!  HILLARY CLEARLY WON THE DEBATE, HANDS DOWN!!!2ND DEBATE ~ WOO, WHAT A DISASTER.  TRUMP STALKED HILLARY ON STAGE AND WAS OUT OF CONTROL.  NEEDS TO PUT DOWN HE CRACK PIPE FOR AWHILE.  HILLARY WINS THIS ONE TOO.3RD AND FINAL DEBATE.  IS TRUMP OFF HIS MEDS?  TRUMP IS THE KNOWS NOTHING CANDIDATE.  THE ONLY THING HE KNOWS, IS HOW TO LIE.  HE DOES THAT QUITE WELL.  THIS IS A SICK MAN.  HILLARY TAKES ALL.#NeverTrumPutin#NoTaxesNoVote#NeverTrumpPence

Do not give absolute majority to any one party or you will face same atrocity since 2014A coalition government is a cabinet of a parliamentary government in which several parties cooperate. The usual reason given for this arrangement is that no party on its own can achieve a majority in the parliament. ... If a coalition collapses, a confidence vote is held or a motion of no confidence is taken. You can kick them out if thinks go worst as todays

Presidential hopefuls Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are both scheduled to speak at the 71st Annual Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner in New York.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Midge Hough | 10154750081624729_10154750234369729 | Amazing strong woman and our next president, Hillary Clinton. I see a lot of trolls on here tonight. Guess they're upset that Don the Con is losing so badly.
2 | Patricia Wilson | 10154750081624729_1165902186833222 | She's always going around talking to people and he's just sitting around. Are you sure he's running for president? Don't look like he wants the job.
3 | Mary Henry | 10154750081624729_10154750171929729 | Just wish you knew Hillary like I do as opposed to the 30+ years of conditioning that seems to have become more myth, lore and "pile on".
4 | Johnny Campagnone | 10154750081624729_1418503431510901 | Watch Hilary come at it with class and she handle this creep once again with poise. And even laughed when he was actually funny.
5 | Brooke Jordan | 10154750081624729_1028469597279143 | Everyone needs to calm down - this dinner is a tradition! Every presidential candidate for 40 years has done it! It's a chance to blow off steam.
6 | Jimmie Singleton | 10154750081624729_1165901246833316 | Politifact is actually founded and operated by The St. Petersburg Times newspaper here in Florida and never had a reputation of being liberal media
7 | Jimmie Singleton | 10154750081624729_10154750253359729 | Thing is Marti...youre worked up over Hillary's mention of around 4 minute proceedure for launching ICBM'scwhen the entire worldcalready can figure that out
8 | Steve Jetton | 10154750081624729_932290176903167 | The Clinton Foundation only donates less than 10% to legitimate charities the rest goes to the Clintons disguised as expenses
9 | Rub Flo | 10154750081624729_1814223655483270 | This is was happen when all the comedians and journalists love this woman, she's got better material them this orange vomit.
10 | Robyn Guinn | 10154750081624729_10154750234384729 | Shut up is all a dumb liberal can add to the conversation, shut up, probably works as one of hillary's nation wide troll squad
11 | Midge Hough | 10154750081624729_1165902670166507 | It's not a baby until it can survive outside the womb. Hey guys shut up. When you give birth you can discuss this subject. It not until then.
12 | Kathleen Gibney | 10154750081624729_932309996901185 | No idea who the guy is wearing the huge medal. Does anybody know what it is he's wearing? What it represents? It's a Catholic symbol
13 | Marti Eales-Kilby | 10154750081624729_1165902116833229 | John Vidal: Dems do not care about right and wrong, they only care about power and money. They will do anything to have both, even kill people who get in their way. (Seth Rich)
14 | Ryan Belden | 10154750081624729_1418518704842707 | Kia, Melissa and the other trolls watching this clearly have no life.   I'm not sure what's funnier; Hillary's speech or their BS lol
15 | Jason Gabriel | 10154750081624729_932300896902095 | Some of the jokes were a bit funny despite being showded with the fact that these people are so far removed from the American public.  Out of touch. :(
16 | Steve Jetton | 10154750081624729_10154750191589729 | Hillary's the most corrupt and dishonest politician in American history to run for the highest office in our great country.
17 | Veronica Roragen | 10154750081624729_932295130236005 | this is very uncomfortable to watch...a stage of elites eating dinner with a cardinal....ugh But at least they are making fun of Donald
18 | Johnny Campagnone | 10154750081624729_10154750206549729 | Bill was out campaigning for his wife today. Melanie sits home and grabs her own pussy. Because Donny is out getting his own.
19 | Rub Flo | 10154750081624729_1028483683944401 | What a elegance in this woman, plus her temper that's way the American people will be proclaim as the new president on the united estates of America
20 | Suzanne McDonald | 10154750081624729_10154750257389729 | I bet if Hilary win you will see no change in 4 years the inner city will look the same we are not even moving the rate  Les then 1% in 4years if Trump font win America are the losers. Sad
21 | Abdulhak Raja | 10154750081624729_10154750168604729 | The Washington Post is doing a great job, not aligned to any of the candidates.. My prediction goes for Hilary winning, she would become the first and last Female president for one term, in the current century...
22 | Kathleen Gibney | 10154750081624729_932301246902060 | Curtis, I don't think he wants to be there. He doesn't have a sense of humor when it comes to himself. He is very thinned skinned.
23 | Marti Eales-Kilby | 10154750081624729_10154750234579729 | Yes I am. She said it takes 4 minutes from the time the call is made till the nukes are launched. Our national security officers where having heart attacks!
24 | Bill Moore | 10154750081624729_932315393567312 | I'm amazed how many haters there are watching this. If you don't like her don't watch.
25 | Marti Eales-Kilby | 10154750081624729_10154750257574729 | Jimmie, you are ignorant. Just because I went to IU does not mean I am from IN. I U is the best business school in the country, Mark Cuban went there

"Totally dishonest Donna Brazile chokes on the truth. Highly illegal!" - Donald Trump
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Charlie Kraebel | 10154749538359729_10154749887239729 | This "shoot the messenger" tactic used by the HRC campaign and the DNC is getting a little old. The contents of the documents are more important than how they were obtained.I would say people are seeing right through this, but it's 2016, and people are stupid and easily fooled.
2 | Scott Gibbs | 10154749538359729_10154749802219729 | Brazile's super-defensive interview was a gift to Donald Trump...unfortunately for him his childish and moronic "Tweets" as rebuttal are a gift to everyone else.
3 | Glenn Hassig | 10154749538359729_10154749921184729 | The government brought this onto themselves! The DNC and Hillary were nothing but a vicious group of scumbags that undermined Sanders every chance they got!!! We have seen the emails to prove it! Then you act all high and mighty when the lunatic Trump throws a hand grenade saying the election system is rigged! Guess what it is and we have seen the freaking emails. Maybe if you scumbags let Sanders compete on an even field you would not have so many voters agreeing with Trump. Arrogance at its finest
4 | Urban Smithing | 10154749538359729_10154749991879729 | Treasonous traitors NOT victims! Our government is saturated with corrupt criminals on both sides Time for a change. Just look at why Donna is there in the first place she is interim because of corruption from the last one! The DNC is a criminal organization that should be investigated under RICO.
5 | Ramone Villaster | 10154749538359729_10154750073959729 | THE DNC REALLY DIDN'T NEED TO DO THIS. Trump Supporters are naturally violent and racist! You just have to unleash them and they'll spread havoc.
6 | Russell West | 10154749538359729_10154753693624729 | Cross examination is not something these lying Democrats can handle! Donna was pathetic when confronted with serious journalism, instead of a CNN or MSNBC political hack pretending to be a journalist
7 | Tony Gutierrez | 10154749538359729_10154752113114729 | 31 credible incidents if voter fraud out of one billion ballots cast...you have a greater chance of being struck by lightning that being a victim of voter fraud. Next wedge issue.
8 | Rita Diane Palmer | 10154749538359729_10154750150184729 | It‚Äôs no surprise that Donald Trump makes things up. He told at least 58 lies in the first presidential debate. He told even more whoppers in the second debate. And last night‚Äôs debate was no different.n total, Trump has told at least 137 lies over the three presidential debates‚Äîand that‚Äôs excluding the countless falsehoods he spews daily on the campaign trail. That‚Äôs roughly one lie per every 50 seconds he spoke. It turns out that flat out lying isn‚Äôt a substitute for having policies and knowledge about the issues that are facing the country.
9 | Donna HJohnson Brown | 10154749538359729_10154749845294729 | Why Donna? You're so much better! It's public knowledge now. We know Hun! Smh!
10 | Rebecca Laskey | 10154749538359729_10154749798974729 | SO THE NARCISSISTIC PATHOLOGICAL SERIAL LIAR, THE GUY WHO ASSAULTS, RAPES AND DEMEANS WOMEN ASKS:  "WHAT THE HELL DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE"???As a Black, Muslim, Gay AND A Woman. EVERYTHING!!Here is why:1. The misogynistic pathetic small man has shown over and over again throughout his life he has zero respect for women. He has said cringe worthy horrible/outrageous things about women all his life. He has consistently insulted, belittled, sexualized, and stereotyped women. Such insecure small man with zero respect for women and their contributions to our society should have NO place holding the highest office in the land. And he has promised to nominate conservative justices who will limit women's reproductive rights & women's ability to make informed decisions about their own bodies. This is a man who believes women should be "punished" for having an abortion. And he promised to overturn Roe vs. Wade if he gets elected. Just a little history here: "In the 1950s, estimates of numbers of illegal, unsafe abortions ranged widely, from 200,000 to 1.2 million per year. The methods used were often ineffective and dangerous. Desperate women were driven into the back alley, where they endured danger and abuse, sometimes sexual." Access to safe, legal abortion saves women's lives. The reality is there‚Äôs no such thing as no abortion. Just safe & unsafe. As a woman I can NOT afford to have a president who will take us back decades on the progress we made on women's rights. So as a woman I have everything to lose. 2.  I was raised in a Muslim family, even though I no longer consider myself a practicing Muslim. So that xenophobic con man's hate-filled rhetoric is a direct attack on my family and I. So as a Muslim American, I can NOT have afforded to have a president as hateful and careless as him. This country does NOT afford to have a man whose xenophobic rhetoric is feeding terrorist groups like ISIS's recruitment videos. A man whose hate-filled rhetoric terrorist experts believe is detrimental to the counterterrorism and anti- terrorism missions around the world. History shows a leader who believe people should be treated differently based on their religion is dangerous. So as a Muslim American I have everything to lose. 3. As a black person I can NOT afford to have a racist person who refused to disavow Ku Klux Klan as a president. A person who was the leading voice of the ‚Äúbirther‚Äù movement, a racist effort to try to delegitimize the nation's first black president. A racist person who ignored Fair Housing Act and let his employees mark applications of minorities with a 'C' for 'Colored' & refused to rent or negotiate rentals ‚Äúbecause of race and color.‚Äù A racist person whose campaign is attracting scary number of neo-Nazi white supremacist organizations. A racist man whose campaign selected white nationalist leader as a delegate. A racist man who hired Breitbart News executive chairman Steve Bannon, a leader of white supremacist group as his campaign CEO signaling his campaign is fully embracing the white supremacist alt-right & all their race-baiting ideas. A racist person whose campaign rallies looks like a klan gathering. On top of that he promised to nominate conservative justices who will take us back decades on voting rights. So as a black American I have everything to lose. 4. As a lesbian I can NOT afforded to have a president who does NOT think I should marry whoever my heart desire. The LGBT community has made historic progress in the past few years, I cannot afford to have a president who will destroy all those progresses by nominating conservative justices who will turn the clock back years. So as a gay citizen, I have everything to lose. 5. As a proud citizen of this great country who believes in American values I can NOT afford to have a self-serving, greedy, pathological liar, con-man who is walking all over those values as a president. To the white people who are not motivated by hate and resentment but still support Trump, I as a minority would like to ask you to think about how Trump's presidency affect me and people like me. I would like to sincerely ask you to reconsider your support for him. Please. To the people who are planning to vote for a third party candidate: I would like to ask you to think really, really hard. Especially, if you care about progressive ideas and believe Trump presidency will take us back decades on the progress we have made on women issues, LGBT issues...etc. The fact is we are a two-party system, Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump will be America's next president. Period! And your vote could decide the next President. Simply put, a vote that is not for Hillary is directly or indirectly a vote for Trump. Just as a note, I am NOT saying Hillary is perfect or doesn't come with a lot of baggage. So if you believe the con-man is unqualified, temperamentally unfit, and dangerous please reconsider voting for Hillary Clinton and vote blue up and down the ballot.Trump and Pence show extreme contempt towards Gays, LGBT and LGBTQ.  Both on are record as being ANTI-GAY!A vote for Trump is a lost vote - he will not become the next president of The United States of America!It is paramount that The President of The United States of America is a sane, intelligent, curious, controlled person, who is a reliable, detail-oriented, steadfast, cautious and methodical person without whom organizations and society would dissolve (fall apart). Hillary fits the aforementioned description! She is a woman, who can keep her cool!Trump on the other hand is non-reflecting and ruthless character, who lacks emphatic traits under non-sexual circumstances. He is extremely nervous and very emotional driven. He completely lacks self-knowledge! He is little bothered by second thoughts and self-doubt. That doesn't mean he is smart but that he is rather dumb. His knowledge is in general extremely limited. Since he does not reflect on his errors or analyze any mistakes to any great extent - Trump is incapable to learn from his errors, and so he will be caught in a loop, repeating his mistakes, which can have catastrophic consequences for the US, the rest of the world and possible beyond depending on the nature of his actions.In all fairness in the Vice Presidential debate Tuesday night, October 4, 2016, Mike Pence acted far more "vice presidential" than Tim Kaine, who was rude and insulting as well as he was talking over Mike Pence, who just had to sit there and take it.HOWEVER, Trump would still do the right thing if he voluntarily steps down from the presidential election campaign. Whether he steps down or not he will not be elected as the next President of The United States of America!DONALD TRUMP TRIED TO FIRE NANCY O‚ÄôDELL AFTER SHE REJECTED HIS ADVANCES!

11 | Rebecca Laskey | 10154749538359729_10154749797249729 | HARVARD HAS BROKEN A 128-YEAR OF VOTING REPUBLICAN, BECAUSE OF TRUMP!Dear Members and Alumni,In every presidential election since 1888, the members and Executive Board of the Harvard Republican Club have gathered to discuss, debate, and eventually endorse the standard-bearer of our party. But for the first time in 128 years, we, the oldest College Republicans chapter in the nation, will not be endorsing the Republican nominee.Donald Trump holds views that are antithetical to our values not only as Republicans, but as Americans. The rhetoric he espouses ‚Äìfrom racist slander to misogynistic taunts‚Äì is not consistent with our conservative principles, and his repeated mocking of the disabled and belittling of the sacrifices made by prisoners of war, Gold Star families, and Purple Heart recipients is not only bad politics, but absurdly cruel.If enacted, Donald Trump‚Äôs platform would endanger our security both at home and abroad. Domestically, his protectionist trade policies and draconian immigration restrictions would enlarge our federal deficit, raise prices for consumers, and throw our economy back into recession. Trump‚Äôs global outlook, steeped in isolationism, is considerably out-of-step with the traditional Republican stance as well. The flippancy with which he is willing to abdicate the United States‚Äô responsibility to lead is alarming. Calling for the US‚Äô withdrawal from NATO and actively endorsing nuclear proliferation, Donald Trump‚Äôs foreign policy would wreak havoc on the established world order which has held aggressive foreign powers in check since World War II.Perhaps most importantly, however, Donald Trump simply does not possess the temperament and character necessary to lead the United States through an increasingly perilous world. The last week should have made obvious to all what has been obvious to most for more than a year. In response to any slight ‚Äìperceived or real‚Äì Donald Trump lashes out viciously and irresponsibly. In Trump‚Äôs eyes, disagreement with his actions or his policies warrants incessant name calling and derision: stupid, lying, fat, ugly, weak, failing, idiot ‚Äìand that‚Äôs just his ‚Äúfellow‚Äù Republicans.He isn‚Äôt eschewing political correctness. He is eschewing basic human decency.Donald Trump, despite spending more than a year on the campaign trail, has either refused or been unable to educate himself on issues that matter most to Americans like us. He speaks only in platitudes, about greatness, success, and winning. Time and time again, Trump has demonstrated his complete lack of knowledge on critical matters, meandering from position to position over the course of the election. When confronted about these frequent reversals, Trump lies in a manner more brazen and shameless than anything politics has ever seen.Millions of people across the country are feeling despondent. Their hours have been cut, wages slashed, jobs even shipped overseas. But Donald Trump doesn‚Äôt have a plan to fix that. He has a plan to exploit that.Donald Trump is a threat to the survival of the Republic. His authoritarian tendencies and flirtations with fascism are unparalleled in the history of our democracy. He hopes to divide us by race, by class, and by religion, instilling enough fear and anxiety to propel himself to the White House. He is looking to to pit neighbor against neighbor, friend against friend, American against American. We will not stand for this vitriolic rhetoric that is poisoning our country and our children. President Reagan called on us to maintain this, our shining city on a hill. He called on us to maintain freedom abroad by keeping a strong presence in the world. He called on us to maintain liberty at home by upholding the democratic process and respecting our opponents. He called on us to maintain decency in our hearts by loving our neighbor.He would be ashamed of Donald Trump. We are too. This fall, we will instead focus our efforts on reclaiming the Republican Party from those who have done it considerable harm, campaigning for candidates who will uphold the conservative principles that have defined the Republican Party for generations. We will work to ensure both chambers of Congress remain in Republican hands, continuing to protect against executive overreach regardless of who wins the election this November.We call on our party‚Äôs elected leaders to renounce their support of Donald Trump, and urge our fellow College Republicans to join us in condemning and withholding their endorsement from this dangerous man. The conservative movement in America should not and will not go quietly into the night.A longtime student of American democracy, Alexis de Tocqueville once said, ‚ÄúAmerica is great because she is good. If America ceases to be good, America will cease to be great.‚Äù De Tocqueville believed in the United States. Americans are a decent people. We work hard, protect our own, and look out for one another in times of need, regardless of the color of our skin, the God we worship, or our party registration. Donald Trump may not believe in that America, but we do. And that America will never cease to be great.HILLARY CLINTON CANNOT TAKE AWAY SECOND AMENDMENT GUN RIGHTS WITHOUT APPROVAL OF CONGRESS.  HILLARY DOES NOT WANT TO ABOLISH YOUR 2ND AMENDMENT.  ANOTHER TRUMP LIE.AMERICA IS ALREADY GOOD AND WE ARE BETTER THAN DONALD TRUMP!REGISTER AND VOTE BLUE UP AND DOWN THE BALLOT.

Although she has not yet been disbarred, Hillary Clinton would not even be able to practice law! Check out her track record as lawyer starting from the bar exam...The woman is a total fraud in everything remotely related to professional activity. Hillary Clinton‚Äôs only virtue is her being doggedly loyal to her rich benefactors who have donated to the Clinton Foundation. That is why she has all those scandals trailing Hillary Clinton throughout her professional life.The truth is plain to see! Hillary Clinton cannot hide her faulty, incompetent, and disgustingly corrupt track record! If you want to read stories describing artificial reality and comments shamelessly made by paid trolls, you should go to the Left media outlets that lopsidedly defend and praise HRC! No normal person with half a brain will cast his or her vote for a candidate who should not have been allowed to run for President in the first place!
14 | John Nelson | 10154749538359729_10154751392709729 | Hillary must win because Donald is a lunatic. However, the Democratic party needs a major overhaul.

That way you are able to create a police state.5) Welfare ‚Äî Take control of every aspect of their lives (Food, Housing, and Income).6) Education ‚Äî Take control of what people read and listen to ‚Äî take control of what children learn in school.7) Religion ‚Äî Remove the belief in the God from the Government and schools.8) Class Warfare ‚Äî Divide the people into the wealthy and the poor.

This Trump, who secretly was proven to have a sexsual relationship with Putin (a ruler of Russia) campaigned in vane 'cause he wasn't sane. He lost the election to Hillary Rodham Clinton, who we all remember as the president, who made the U.S. great again and who was the president, who negotiated a lasting peace in the Middle East.

--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Paul David Menser | 10154749742864729_10154752557699729 | The problem with the ACA is that it was written by insurance lobbyists, whose definition of "affordable" I would really like to hear. Obama signed it figuring something was better than nothing and that it could be refined and improved. Fat chance of that happening with Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan in charge. Time to make Congress blue again and bring a progressive agenda forward.

3 | Jimmie Singleton | 10154749742864729_10154750581904729 | Obamacare should have come into it's existence as it was intended...a single payer system.....BUT a combination of massive lobbying by the healthcare industry.....the sudden downturn in health by it's strongest champion Ted Kennedy.....and the waffleing of a couple of other conservative Democrats succeeded in diluting the Bill just enough to create the problems we have with it today....The Republicans problem is that thay have no substitute for suddenly kicking 20 million people out of having any insuranxe at all
4 | Jimmie Singleton | 10154749742864729_10154750564404729 | Healthcare costs will be rising but not even close to the rate private healthcare will........and that would have been especially true....absent of any Obamacare.....IF you were lucky enough not to be cancelled because of a sudden change in health status in the first place

Still, there are those that in their exalted opinion of their opinion and their own self righteousness and espoused values and principles who are saying with their noses in the air...I will not vote for evil and blah, blah, blah, etc. When if the pure truth were know, Donald Trump is more righteous than most if not all of those that have such a mindset. If you do not vote, you are in fact supporting corruption and thus your values and principles are like sounding brass and tinkling cymbals...no fence sitting allowed in this one which could be the last one!! Trump 2016...the one with will tear down the system, clean out the stench, and put it back together again the smart way and the right way!!!!! Blessings!!

11 | Sergey Malovatov | 10154749742864729_10154750496299729 | Hillary Clinton is a political cadaver like nobody has ever seen anywhere in the world. Her future would be bleak if it was not for the fact that Hillary Clinton is severely ill and probably doesn't have much time left.Professionally Hillary Clinton is in the same position as her husband was after he had been disbarred and his political career had been essentially over. Although she has not yet been disbarred, Hillary Clinton would not even be able to practice law! Check out her track record as lawyer starting from the bar exam...The woman is a total fraud in everything remotely related to professional activity. Hillary Clinton‚Äôs only virtue is her being doggedly loyal to her rich benefactors who have donated to the Clinton Foundation. That is why she has all those scandals trailing Hillary Clinton throughout her professional life.The truth is plain to see! Hillary Clinton cannot hide her faulty, incompetent, and disgustingly corrupt track record! If you want to read stories describing artificial reality and comments shamelessly made by paid trolls, you should go to the Left media outlets that lopsidedly defend and praise HRC! No normal person with half a brain will cast his or her vote for a candidate who should not have been allowed to run for President in the first place!

16 | Frances Scott | 10154749742864729_10154752143384729 | The Clinton Administration granted waivers to Loral Space and other American high-tech companies to sell missile guidance system technology to China in exchange for at least $5,000,000 in donation to the 1996 Clinton-Gore re-election effort.  This technology allowed China's nuclear missile program to leap 10 years forward almost instantly.  Julius and Ethel Rosenberg received the death penalty for selling America's atomic bomb secrets to the Soviet Union.  But the Clintons go away with Chinagate scot free.

--------------Comments:--------------
1 | April Ruggles | 10154749631524729_10154749890339729 | This is what I was waiting for men to step up to the plate and comment on Donald's Behavior. I don't know if there's any other men that came out but this man should be praised for stepping up and doing the right thing.http://tmz.me/6jRJt05
2 | John Andrews | 10154749631524729_10154751280129729 | With so little time left in this shemozzle, a few extra stories won't matter other than keep some people riled up. There is enough evidence out there aleady.
3 | Bruce Moon | 10154749631524729_10154752089274729 | Trump's morality sounds more like Bill Clinton's, Ted Kennedy's, or JfK's every day....only this time the Libbofascist media seems to have suddenly found morality and faux moral indignation for some strange reason. Who knew?
4 | Jamila Kae | 10154749631524729_10154749747459729 | That sexual predator, that unhinged misogynist, that overgrown toddler, that xenophobic bigot, that anti-intellectual, insult-spewing monstrosity is unfit to be out in public, let alone serve in public office.
5 | Rita Diane Palmer | 10154749631524729_10154749685224729 | The old Donald showed up after the first few questions in the debate: Trump‚Äôs refusal to say he would accept the result of the election if he loses. Trump‚Äôs inability to answer charges that he has behaved abusively toward women. And Trump‚Äôs return to the truculent, angry man of the first debate, interrupting Clinton repeatedly (saying, at one point, ‚ÄúSuch a nasty woman‚Äù). Trump, who‚Äôs behind, needed to change the direction of the campaign and show undecided voters that he can be thoughtful and measured when the situation requires. He failed.
6 | Mccoy Dosh | 10154749631524729_10154749743754729 | Com'on everybody has a past so stop hating, just vote him or vote him out either way stop digging his past
7 | Allan Jones | 10154749631524729_10154750020654729 | Lying bitch. What about the chick in red next to her staring at her tits.
8 | Mary Russell | 10154749631524729_10154749901939729 | This is a bunch of staged lies prompted by political motivations. It's obvious. They can't beat Trump on the merits of his arguments. He beat Hillary Clinton again so these crybabies respond with made-up stories. There's no reason to believe Gloria Allred and every reason to believe Trump. WHERE WERE THEY DURING PRIMARIES? Answer: It was not time to make up a story yet. After all they would have done it to Jeb Bush or anyone else who competed with Hillary.
9 | Mike Brown | 10154749631524729_10154752824369729 | Just one more lie brought to you by the Democrats and the propaganda news people from the Washington post.

However, Trump can sue these women under a little stipulation under the law called "False Light" in other words prove they lied to intentionally put him in false light:    http://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/gofundme-campaign-will-pay-your-legal-fees-so-you-can-n664646

I just had to laugh as I remembered when Obama sent people to Russia to try to interfere with Israel's election attempting to make sure Benjamin Netanyahu did not get re-elected be he did.  Oh these Liberals are SUCH fun they accuse others of the corruptness they do.

3 | Mysty Bent | 10154749523984729_10154750165679729 | Obama, Bush and everyone else Republicans and Democratic's have endorsed Clinton. She has friends helping her Campaign including Rivals. Such as Bernie Sanders, this says a lot about her. She has exposed her taxes and the Russians have opened up her emails. To be fair, Trump should show us his taxes and Russians should expose his emails. Critical Thinkers open your mind!
4 | Theada Bartel | 10154749523984729_10154751741109729 | Trump has no couth, I get that. However it appears that common sense that has escaped all of us. I am a strong independent woman, I am proud to be moving forward and working in a " man's world", where my actions are done with integrity. Hillary Clinton is a disgrace as a woman, her actions, her lies, her poor choices alone dictate that she is repulsive, it's not because she is female, it's because she has no integrity, no morals and no regard for life and honesty, she is not a role model for our youth, her behavior alone, I would be ashamed if she was my daughter or mother.

He is still standing in the gap for all of us, even those that do not like and support him...standing in the face of the most vicious smear campaign ever seen in a presidential election....standing after months and months and months and miles and miles and miles when lesser men would have fainted and fallen by the wayside. How is this possible...because his cause is just and because he truly loves this country and its people unlike those that oppose him who are self centered and want what they want...because he has been tapped by the Almighty for this very time, and His timing is always perfect...and when God brings you to it, He will bring you through it...that is really how this is possible!!

14 | Butch Ored | 10154749523984729_10154750679669729 | Hillary Clinton did her college thesis on his writings and Barack Hussein Obama also writes about Saul Alinsky... He is here Mentor... SO this is what they are doing to America and you are willing to let this happen if you vote for this criminal. How to create a social state by Saul Alinsky:There are 8 levels of control that must be obtained before you are able to create a social state.The first is the most important.1) Healthcare ‚Äî Control healthcare and you control the people2) Poverty ‚Äî Increase the Poverty level as high as possible, poor people are easier to control and will not fight back if you are providing everything for them to live.3) Debt ‚Äî Increase the debt to an unsustainable level. That way you are able to increase taxes, and this will produce more poverty.4) Gun Control ‚Äî Remove the ability to defend themselves from the Government. That way you are able to create a police state.5) Welfare ‚Äî Take control of every aspect of their lives (Food, Housing, and Income).6) Education ‚Äî Take control of what people read and listen to ‚Äî take control of what children learn in school.7) Religion ‚Äî Remove the belief in the God from the Government and schools.8) Class Warfare ‚Äî Divide the people into the wealthy and the poor. This will cause more discontent and it will be easier to take (Tax) the wealthy with the support of the poor.Now, think ...Does any of this sound like what is happening to the United States?

Democratic VP nominee Tim Kaine counters Trump's "rigging" claim with a call for early voting. He says it could also limit the risk of voter suppression.

1 | Felicia Nathan | 10154749561029729_10154749676209729 | Just a thought even if is rigged, not saying it is, the Gov would be saving us from Trump. He had no business running for President anyway. He did it for all the wrong reasons. It wasn't to make America Great Again either. I remember before they picked Pence they told him that basically they wanted him to do the job that Trump didn't want to do. Manafort said Trump wants to be Chairman of the Board. This is Trump's Power trip. His  whole campaign is a hoax.

Then you act all high and mighty when the lunatic Trump throws a hand grenade saying the election system is rigged! Guess what it is and we have seen the freaking emails. Maybe if you scumbags let Sanders compete on an even field you would not have so many voters agreeing with Trump. Arrogance at its finest

Why should Any of us??!?? You have Dems refusing to purge dead people from voter rolls, Dems overturned voter ID laws, Wikileaks e-mails of John Podesta saying illegals can register to vote by showing a drivers license (illegal crime), you have videos of voter fraud, you have Gore/Florida in 2000 where results were not allowed until December so Dems could recount 100s of times.....

--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Rita Diane Palmer | 10154749509044729_10154749688674729 | The old Donald showed up after the first few questions in the debate: Trump‚Äôs refusal to say he would accept the result of the election if he loses. Trump‚Äôs inability to answer charges that he has behaved abusively toward women. And Trump‚Äôs return to the truculent, angry man of the first debate, interrupting Clinton repeatedly (saying, at one point, ‚ÄúSuch a nasty woman‚Äù). Trump, who‚Äôs behind, needed to change the direction of the campaign and show undecided voters that he can be thoughtful and measured when the situation requires. He failed.

He is still standing in the gap for all of us, even those that do not like and support him...standing in the face of the most vicious smear campaign ever seen in a presidential election....standing after months and months and months and miles and miles and miles when lesser men would have fainted and fallen by the wayside. How is this possible...because his cause is just and because he truly loves this country and its people unlike those that oppose him who are self centered and want what they want...because he has been tapped by the Almighty for this very time, and His timing is always perfect...and when God brings you to it, He will bring you through it...that is really how this is possible!! Donald Trump is the only man on the radar who can put America back on track by leading from the front and not the back....because he sees the problems for what they are as his vision is not clouded by political aspirations and ideology....because he is not bought and sold like his opponent and his hands are not tied by special interests....because he can put together a world class team of true experts, instead of the present political hacks, for he has the contacts and knows where they are...and because he has the innate brilliance and savy and amazing instincts honed by years and years in a very tough business environment!! Still, there are those that in their exalted opinion of their opinion and their own self righteousness and espoused values and principles who are saying with their noses in the air...I will not vote for evil and blah, blah, blah, etc. When if the pure truth were know, Donald Trump is more righteous than most if not all of those that have such a mindset. If you do not vote, you are in fact supporting corruption and thus your values and principles are like sounding brass and tinkling cymbals...no fence sitting allowed in this one which could be the last one!! Trump 2016...the one with will tear down the system, clean out the stench, and put it back together again the smart way and the right way!!!!! Blessings!!

Such insecure small man with zero respect for women and their contributions to our society should have NO place holding the highest office in the land.

This is a man who believes women should be "punished" for having an abortion. And he promised to overturn Roe vs. Wade if he gets elected. Just a little history here: "In the 1950s, estimates of numbers of illegal, unsafe abortions ranged widely, from 200,000 to 1.2 million per year. The methods used were often ineffective and dangerous. Desperate women were driven into the back alley, where they endured danger and abuse, sometimes sexual." Access to safe, legal abortion saves women's lives. The reality is there‚Äôs no such thing as no abortion. Just safe & unsafe. As a woman I can NOT afford to have a president who will take us back decades on the progress we made on women's rights. So as a woman I have everything to lose. 2.  I was raised in a Muslim family, even though I no longer consider myself a practicing Muslim. So that xenophobic con man's hate-filled rhetoric is a direct attack on my family and I. So as a Muslim American, I can NOT have afforded to have a president as hateful and careless as him. This country does NOT afford to have a man whose xenophobic rhetoric is feeding terrorist groups like ISIS's recruitment videos. A man whose hate-filled rhetoric terrorist experts believe is detrimental to the counterterrorism and anti- terrorism missions around the world. History shows a leader who believe people should be treated differently based on their religion is dangerous. So as a Muslim American I have everything to lose. 3. As a black person I can NOT afford to have a racist person who refused to disavow Ku Klux Klan as a president. A person who was the leading voice of the ‚Äúbirther‚Äù movement, a racist effort to try to delegitimize the nation's first black president. A racist person who ignored Fair Housing Act and let his employees mark applications of minorities with a 'C' for 'Colored' & refused to rent or negotiate rentals ‚Äúbecause of race and color.‚Äù A racist person whose campaign is attracting scary number of neo-Nazi white supremacist organizations. A racist man whose campaign selected white nationalist leader as a delegate. A racist man who hired Breitbart News executive chairman Steve Bannon, a leader of white supremacist group as his campaign CEO signaling his campaign is fully embracing the white supremacist alt-right & all their race-baiting ideas. A racist person whose campaign rallies looks like a klan gathering. On top of that he promised to nominate conservative justices who will take us back decades on voting rights. So as a black American I have everything to lose. 4. As a lesbian I can NOT afforded to have a president who does NOT think I should marry whoever my heart desire. The LGBT community has made historic progress in the past few years, I cannot afford to have a president who will destroy all those progresses by nominating conservative justices who will turn the clock back years. So as a gay citizen, I have everything to lose. 5. As a proud citizen of this great country who believes in American values I can NOT afford to have a self-serving, greedy, pathological liar, con-man who is walking all over those values as a president. To the white people who are not motivated by hate and resentment but still support Trump, I as a minority would like to ask you to think about how Trump's presidency affect me and people like me. I would like to sincerely ask you to reconsider your support for him. Please. To the people who are planning to vote for a third party candidate: I would like to ask you to think really, really hard. Especially, if you care about progressive ideas and believe Trump presidency will take us back decades on the progress we have made on women issues, LGBT issues...etc. The fact is we are a two-party system, Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump will be America's next president. Period! And your vote could decide the next President. Simply put, a vote that is not for Hillary is directly or indirectly a vote for Trump. Just as a note, I am NOT saying Hillary is perfect or doesn't come with a lot of baggage. So if you believe the con-man is unqualified, temperamentally unfit, and dangerous please reconsider voting for Hillary Clinton and vote blue up and down the ballot.Trump and Pence show extreme contempt towards Gays, LGBT and LGBTQ.  Both on are record as being ANTI-GAY!A vote for Trump is a lost vote - he will not become the next president of The United States of America!It is paramount that The President of The United States of America is a sane, intelligent, curious, controlled person, who is a reliable, detail-oriented, steadfast, cautious and methodical person without whom organizations and society would dissolve (fall apart). Hillary fits the aforementioned description! She is a woman, who can keep her cool!Trump on the other hand is non-reflecting and ruthless character, who lacks emphatic traits under non-sexual circumstances. He is extremely nervous and very emotional driven. He completely lacks self-knowledge! He is little bothered by second thoughts and self-doubt. That doesn't mean he is smart but that he is rather dumb. His knowledge is in general extremely limited. Since he does not reflect on his errors or analyze any mistakes to any great extent - Trump is incapable to learn from his errors, and so he will be caught in a loop, repeating his mistakes, which can have catastrophic consequences for the US, the rest of the world and possible beyond depending on the nature of his actions.In all fairness in the Vice Presidential debate Tuesday night, October 4, 2016, Mike Pence acted far more "vice presidential" than Tim Kaine, who was rude and insulting as well as he was talking over Mike Pence, who just had to sit there and take it.HOWEVER, Trump would still do the right thing if he voluntarily steps down from the presidential election campaign. Whether he steps down or not he will not be elected as the next President of The United States of America!DONALD TRUMP TRIED TO FIRE NANCY O‚ÄôDELL AFTER SHE REJECTED HIS ADVANCES!  HOW COME HE HASN‚ÄôT APOLOGIZED TO HER?  HIS APOLOGY MEANS NOTHING !!!PROMINATE GOP LEADERS ARE DITCHING DONALD TRUMP IS DROVES.

11 | Rebecca Laskey | 10154749456454729_10154749501289729 | HARVARD HAS BROKEN A 128-YEAR OF VOTING REPUBLICAN, BECAUSE OF TRUMP!Dear Members and Alumni,In every presidential election since 1888, the members and Executive Board of the Harvard Republican Club have gathered to discuss, debate, and eventually endorse the standard-bearer of our party. But for the first time in 128 years, we, the oldest College Republicans chapter in the nation, will not be endorsing the Republican nominee.Donald Trump holds views that are antithetical to our values not only as Republicans, but as Americans. The rhetoric he espouses ‚Äìfrom racist slander to misogynistic taunts‚Äì is not consistent with our conservative principles, and his repeated mocking of the disabled and belittling of the sacrifices made by prisoners of war, Gold Star families, and Purple Heart recipients is not only bad politics, but absurdly cruel.If enacted, Donald Trump‚Äôs platform would endanger our security both at home and abroad. Domestically, his protectionist trade policies and draconian immigration restrictions would enlarge our federal deficit, raise prices for consumers, and throw our economy back into recession. Trump‚Äôs global outlook, steeped in isolationism, is considerably out-of-step with the traditional Republican stance as well. The flippancy with which he is willing to abdicate the United States‚Äô responsibility to lead is alarming. Calling for the US‚Äô withdrawal from NATO and actively endorsing nuclear proliferation, Donald Trump‚Äôs foreign policy would wreak havoc on the established world order which has held aggressive foreign powers in check since World War II.Perhaps most importantly, however, Donald Trump simply does not possess the temperament and character necessary to lead the United States through an increasingly perilous world. The last week should have made obvious to all what has been obvious to most for more than a year. In response to any slight ‚Äìperceived or real‚Äì Donald Trump lashes out viciously and irresponsibly. In Trump‚Äôs eyes, disagreement with his actions or his policies warrants incessant name calling and derision: stupid, lying, fat, ugly, weak, failing, idiot ‚Äìand that‚Äôs just his ‚Äúfellow‚Äù Republicans.He isn‚Äôt eschewing political correctness. He is eschewing basic human decency.Donald Trump, despite spending more than a year on the campaign trail, has either refused or been unable to educate himself on issues that matter most to Americans like us. He speaks only in platitudes, about greatness, success, and winning. Time and time again, Trump has demonstrated his complete lack of knowledge on critical matters, meandering from position to position over the course of the election. When confronted about these frequent reversals, Trump lies in a manner more brazen and shameless than anything politics has ever seen.Millions of people across the country are feeling despondent. Their hours have been cut, wages slashed, jobs even shipped overseas. But Donald Trump doesn‚Äôt have a plan to fix that. He has a plan to exploit that.Donald Trump is a threat to the survival of the Republic. His authoritarian tendencies and flirtations with fascism are unparalleled in the history of our democracy. He hopes to divide us by race, by class, and by religion, instilling enough fear and anxiety to propel himself to the White House. He is looking to to pit neighbor against neighbor, friend against friend, American against American. We will not stand for this vitriolic rhetoric that is poisoning our country and our children. President Reagan called on us to maintain this, our shining city on a hill. He called on us to maintain freedom abroad by keeping a strong presence in the world. He called on us to maintain liberty at home by upholding the democratic process and respecting our opponents. He called on us to maintain decency in our hearts by loving our neighbor.He would be ashamed of Donald Trump. We are too. This fall, we will instead focus our efforts on reclaiming the Republican Party from those who have done it considerable harm, campaigning for candidates who will uphold the conservative principles that have defined the Republican Party for generations. We will work to ensure both chambers of Congress remain in Republican hands, continuing to protect against executive overreach regardless of who wins the election this November.We call on our party‚Äôs elected leaders to renounce their support of Donald Trump, and urge our fellow College Republicans to join us in condemning and withholding their endorsement from this dangerous man. The conservative movement in America should not and will not go quietly into the night.A longtime student of American democracy, Alexis de Tocqueville once said, ‚ÄúAmerica is great because she is good. If America ceases to be good, America will cease to be great.‚Äù De Tocqueville believed in the United States. Americans are a decent people. We work hard, protect our own, and look out for one another in times of need, regardless of the color of our skin, the God we worship, or our party registration. Donald Trump may not believe in that America, but we do. And that America will never cease to be great.HILLARY CLINTON CANNOT TAKE AWAY SECOND AMENDMENT GUN RIGHTS WITHOUT APPROVAL OF CONGRESS.  HILLARY DOES NOT WANT TO ABOLISH YOUR 2ND AMENDMENT.  ANOTHER TRUMP LIE.AMERICA IS ALREADY GOOD AND WE ARE BETTER THAN DONALD TRUMP!REGISTER AND VOTE BLUE UP AND DOWN THE BALLOT.
12 | Sara Harper Todd | 10154749456454729_10154749502464729 | The republicans all need to be defeated! VOTE BLUE and get rid of these people who have blocked President Obama for the last  8 years.
13 | Ann Schwartz | 10154749456454729_10154749558289729 | Yeah because if it's rigged against him it has to rigged against everyone.
14 | Sergey Malovatov | 10154749456454729_10154750497209729 | Hillary Clinton is a political cadaver like nobody has ever seen anywhere in the world. Her future would be bleak if it was not for the fact that Hillary Clinton is severely ill and probably doesn't have much time left.Professionally Hillary Clinton is in the same position as her husband was after he had been disbarred and his political career had been essentially over. Although she has not yet been disbarred, Hillary Clinton would not even be able to practice law! Check out her track record as lawyer starting from the bar exam...The woman is a total fraud in everything remotely related to professional activity. Hillary Clinton‚Äôs only virtue is her being doggedly loyal to her rich benefactors who have donated to the Clinton Foundation. That is why she has all those scandals trailing Hillary Clinton throughout her professional life.The truth is plain to see! Hillary Clinton cannot hide her faulty, incompetent, and disgustingly corrupt track record! If you want to read stories describing artificial reality and comments shamelessly made by paid trolls, you should go to the Left media outlets that lopsidedly defend and praise HRC! No normal person with half a brain will cast his or her vote for a candidate who should not have been allowed to run for President in the first place!

He also doubled down on his threat to legally challenge the results if he loses.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Jill Greene | 10154749255719729_10154749299394729 | Let him challenge the results in court. It will utterly bankrupt him and hopefully we won't ever have endure his garbage  again.
2 | Connie Hammond | 10154749255719729_10154749650009729 | It's his right to challenge results. He owes it to his voters to ensure all election rules have been followed by the rule of law and in light of the never ending corruption being discovered, he'd be a fool to say otherwise.
3 | Thomas Wolfe | 10154749255719729_10154750847479729 | He can challenge results if warranted.  That's not the issue.  The question was whether he supported the American democratic principle of "peaceful transitions."  That's what he was flippant about.  And that's a problem. But that's not hanging chads.
4 | Monica Murray Karafotis | 10154749255719729_10154749370254729 | Ridiculous!! What a JOKE. Did he think we were asking about that?! Did he think everyone was saying it was unprecedented that a WINNER of the election might not accept the role of President? Haha!!!

This election is not about personalities and years old stuff....it is about principles, the direction of our country, and the future of our country....and to contrast the two candidates...the best predictor of future behavior is past behavior...so, contrast an experienced and accomplished mega businessman who has started over 500 businesses....who knows the value of a dollar...who understands the American economy and what makes America tick....who understands that a nation without borders and laws is not a nation...and who loves America and its people and often says that....and who is a proven winner and problem solver...with a woman who was fired from her first government job for fraud and lying....who stole hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of furniture and artifacts from our WH and Air Force One....who cannot account for a six billion dollar loss from her State Department....who could not even get Hillcare off the ground....who totally screwed up the 'reset' with Russia....whose policies resulted in what we now see in the Middle East....who thinks millions of Americans are deplorable...and that is just the very tip of the iceberg.

1 | Anil Ragwen | 10154749095824729_10154749226259729 | Sometimes, when there are ‚Äúevents‚Äô or ‚Äúsituations‚Äù that occur on a world stage, a historian can examine them from a different perspective. You see, a historian (good historians) can examine an presently occurring ‚Äúissue‚Äù in a different light, a light that shines backwards.As such, I have formulated a theory on a current dynamic in the Presidential Election in the United States of America:From the very beginning, Donald Trump was NEVER meant to win the Presidency. His goal, and the goal of those that back him (as Henry Kissinger would say, those in the ‚Äúback‚Äù, in the ‚Äúshadows‚Äù), was always to create situations and an environment of extreme polarization. Like most demagogues in history, his intent is not to initially obtain power but to create an environment (socially, politically and finally economically) from which he (or people like him) can attain power in the future. The last leader to do this almost to perfection was Adolf Hitler. Follow Hitler‚Äôs rise to power in the late 1920s and early 1930s and you will find rather disturbing parallels. WHY DONALD TRUMP WAS NEVER MEANT TO WIN THE ELECTTION:1)	By winning the Republican Party nomination, he demonstrated that a non-politician could win over established politicians, thereby throwing the Party into turmoil.2)	His loss will leave a number of white Americans feeling dis-enfranchised. Their hate, especially towards Latinos and blacks, will increase possibly leading to a growth in domestic right-wing movements. Hence, Trump‚Äôs declaration that he will NOT accept the election results. It is a demonstrative act of defiance that will fuel fringe groups.3)	His loss will result in a Clinton presidency that will not be immediately able to tackle the problems the United States. The first of these will be foreign policy, especially with Russia. The next will be the issue of race in the United States. Clinton‚Äôs failure in both will lead to her failure as a President and she will be ‚Äúdestroyed‚Äù publicly. She will last one (1) term.Parallels. Too many parallels. Somehow, history always seems to slip through the cracks.
2 | Sharon Connor Jones | 10154749095824729_10154749239449729 | Why is everyone freaking out about Trump saying "he will have to see if he'll accept the outcome of the election"!??? Why should Any of us??!?? You have Dems refusing to purge dead people from voter rolls, Dems overturned voter ID laws, Wikileaks e-mails of John Podesta saying illegals can register to vote by showing a drivers license (illegal crime), you have videos of voter fraud, you have Gore/Florida in 2000 where results were not allowed until December so Dems could recount 100s of times..... WHY would anyone questions Trumps motive - I wouldn't trust Clinton Crime ring either if I were trump!!!! Media is still trying to determine the outcome of this election!!!!
3 | Frances Scott | 10154749095824729_10154751712369729 | Joe HallThe irrelevant, biased, self serving, dishonest, corrupt liberal media has lost any power it might have had to stop Donald Trump....because he has people power ...and prayer power and patriotism power behind him. He is still standing in the gap for all of us, even those that do not like and support him...standing in the face of the most vicious smear campaign ever seen in a presidential election....standing after months and months and months and miles and miles and miles when lesser men would have fainted and fallen by the wayside. How is this possible...because his cause is just and because he truly loves this country and its people unlike those that oppose him who are self centered and want what they want...because he has been tapped by the Almighty for this very time, and His timing is always perfect...and when God brings you to it, He will bring you through it...that is really how this is possible!! Donald Trump is the only man on the radar who can put America back on track by leading from the front and not the back....because he sees the problems for what they are as his vision is not clouded by political aspirations and ideology....because he is not bought and sold like his opponent and his hands are not tied by special interests....because he can put together a world class team of true experts, instead of the present political hacks, for he has the contacts and knows where they are...and because he has the innate brilliance and savy and amazing instincts honed by years and years in a very tough business environment!! Still, there are those that in their exalted opinion of their opinion and their own self righteousness and espoused values and principles who are saying with their noses in the air...I will not vote for evil and blah, blah, blah, etc. When if the pure truth were know, Donald Trump is more righteous than most if not all of those that have such a mindset. If you do not vote, you are in fact supporting corruption and thus your values and principles are like sounding brass and tinkling cymbals...no fence sitting allowed in this one which could be the last one!! Trump 2016...the one with will tear down the system, clean out the stench, and put it back together again the smart way and the right way!!!!! Blessings!!

2 | Larry Laibson | 10154749018099729_10154749189749729 | Didn't Gore challenge his loss in 2000? 2000 post election debates had to do with "hanging chads" on the paper ballots and Gore refused to accept the election results. Since that time, many states have gone electronic with its own set of problems, including for some variety of machines, lack of paper audit. Major evolution of problems since the 2000 election has been the apparent increase in voter fraud, especially in some key districts, with "dead people" voting, and with potential voting irregularities with people voting in multiple States and with no or inadequate voter ID. Very logical procedures in today's highly technological world are to have a National Voter Base, clean-up State voter registration rolls which the States have identified as being required and to require Voter ID at all polls. Why has the Democrat Party pushed so hard against any of these over the past 8 years and even blocked some States, like Florida, from cleaning up the Voter Rolls pre 2012 election? Washington watchdog "Judicial Watch" has been following this problem for years including initiating court cases to address deficiencies.https://news.grabien.com/story-flashback-gore-refuses-concede-election-demands-recount-ensu

But the traitor moves amongst those within the gate freely, his sly whispers rustling through all the alleys, heard in the very halls of government itself. For the traitor appears not a traitor; he speaks in accents familiar to his victims, and he wears their face and their arguments, he appeals to the baseness that lies deep in the hearts of all men. He rots the soul of a nation, he works secretly and unknown in the night to undermine the pillars of the city, he infects the body politic so that it can no longer resist. A murderer is less to fear. The traitor is the plague." -Marcus Tullius Cicero#nevertrump #weareamericans#amoraldecision #mujerbrava #isputintrumpsvp#sniffles #trumpisinlovewithrussia

This Trump, who secretly was proven to have a sexsual relationship with Putin (a ruler of Russia) campaigned in vane 'cause he wasn't sane. He lost the election to Hillary Rodham Clinton, who we all remember as the president, who made the U.S. great again and who was the president, who negotiated a lasting peace in the Middle East.

After this kerfuffle, it seemed not so bad but the last month or so they seem to be where they were at the beginning of the year. Joe and Mika have really convenient amnesia of their feelings for Trump.
3 | Chris Smith | 10154748893714729_10154749445559729 | Well....not even close to subject matter except that its about the 2 presidential nominees, hillary deserved a better opponent and to give credibility to a well known idiot is well, pure idiocy. And I'd like to add that hillary is certainly tarnished, yet she hopefully will make this a learning experience to disavow any current and future illegal or even seemingly incorrect notions and fly america right back to 0 and make it a plus after she's president.

Here is my accepted abstract.Donald BelilePresenter Status: PhDPresentation Type: Oral PresentationBIO:Donald Belile originates from the Pine Ridge Reservation in southwestern SD and is an enrolled member of the Oglala Lakota Sioux. Mr. Belile has a B.S. in Interdisciplinary Environmental Science, M.S. in Systems and is currently attending The University of Montana while working toward a PhD in Systems Ecology under the guidance of Dr. Ragan Callaway. Key interests of Mr. Belile are in working with buffalo (Bison bison) and Tribes in the United States and Canada.Session Title: Estimating Buffalo (Bison bison) Ecological Carrying Capacity Across Varying Temporal and Spatial Scales in MontanaCo-Authors: Dr. Ragan Callaway, Ecologist at The University of MontanaSession Abstract:Wildlife managers, ranchers and scientists can agree that it is difficult to estimate how many buffalo (Bison bison) the landscape can support without risk of over grazing and ensuing ecological degradation. My PhD research is to use GIS and remote sensing products to perform a spatio-temporal analysis of bison impacts across every landscape inhabited by bison in Montana currently and in the near past, and for the entire length of the Landsat imagery legacy dataset using NASA intelligence within Google Earth Engine, executed in Java script. Disturbance of phenological plant cycles and changes to the underlying soil base are key components to understanding ecosystem tipping points as is the consideration of the interspecific interactions and pressure that over grazing directly or indirectly exerts on other wildlife. Bottom-up and top-down trophic relationships vary over space and time, and the impacts of these bidirectional interactions can be intensified by global warming. Mechanistic ecosystem modeling can be calibrated with ground data and informed with geospatial datasets over time to predict grazing impacts and primary productivity. Scientific based decision support can translate into improved herd fitness, help maintain Native American cultural integrity, and provide sustanence for the entire U.S. in the near future. A statistical based buffalo ecological carrying capacity model is fundamental in managing buffalo in North America.

3 | Elliot Lee | 10154748754974729_10154748877429729 | In so far as part of Hillary Clinton's LGBT opening comments are concerned, the world is not about being queer. We do defend and should defend their rights to privacy. However, it, is a lifestyle, should not be the raison D‚Äôetre for a civilisation. We have no desire to emulate the fall of Rome and 476 ad. What they do in their bedrooms should be private, not public. For government to get involved and to endorse a lifestyle haunted by disease and death is wrong.
4 | Mush Hood | 10154748754974729_10154748937189729 | Trump lives in the first world but has a third world mentality.by the way is he talking about a riggid election or rigid erection?
5 | Rita Diane Palmer | 10154748754974729_10154748956854729 | The GOP IS ALREADY hiding from Donald Trump! This is the reason we should never have a Republican Congress or Senate or Donad Trump for President. They cannot stand up for what is right.
6 | Sergey Malovatov | 10154748754974729_10154750500529729 | Hillary Clinton is a political cadaver like nobody has ever seen anywhere in the world. Her future would be bleak if it was not for the fact that Hillary Clinton is severely ill and probably doesn't have much time left.Professionally Hillary Clinton is in the same position as her husband was after he had been disbarred and his political career had been essentially over. Although she has not yet been disbarred, Hillary Clinton would not even be able to practice law! Check out her track record as lawyer starting from the bar exam...The woman is a total fraud in everything remotely related to professional activity. Hillary Clinton‚Äôs only virtue is her being doggedly loyal to her rich benefactors who have donated to the Clinton Foundation. That is why she has all those scandals trailing Hillary Clinton throughout her professional life.The truth is plain to see! Hillary Clinton cannot hide her faulty, incompetent, and disgustingly corrupt track record! If you want to read stories describing artificial reality and comments shamelessly made by paid trolls, you should go to the Left media outlets that lopsidedly defend and praise HRC! No normal person with half a brain will cast his or her vote for a candidate who should not have been allowed to run for President in the first place!
7 | Donn Debban | 10154748754974729_10154748808874729 | I guess no one caught Hillary' decision to tell the entire world our response time on attacks. Seems to me this is important

S. gun owners - tread carefully on Election day, 'cause Men in Black are back, JackSome top secret decree has just been approved by a conservative-liberal/republican power organisation in Washington and has the blessing of the great powers that be.On Election day November 8, 2016 the rumour has it, that +100.000 men in black will pay unannonced visits across America to gun owners and if you cannot prove you have been home all day your guns and ammo will be confiscated and you'll be presented with a hefty fine and possible looking at doing some time. This initiative - the rumour has it - is supported by some very powerful business people, who love America! This might trigger some folks to rethink their strategy. So, Gunnies - either you with us (The Powers that be) or you are against us! What's it gonna beeee????? God bless ya' - even if you'r a deplorable gunnie!
