The winner will inherit an anxious nation, angry and distrustful of leaders in Washington. She or he will preside over an economy that is improving but still leaves many behind, and a military less extended abroad than eight years ago yet grappling with new terror threats.

Nearly two years of relentless campaigning and racially loaded rhetoric has exposed a country that is deeply fractured along lines that are hardening and raw.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Joann Smith | 19 | 10154743597648675_10154744030538675 | The MEDIA needs to help heal the wounds too - there are "News" organizations that are nothing more than propaganda outlets for a particular viewpoint (and quite proud of it). Slanted news, fake news, angry, opinionated, hyper-partisan ranters...all of them share the blame and burden. But sadly, with a Clinton win, they will only dig in and howl all the louder, I fear, dragging the USA down as they have during the 8 Obama years. I have never heard anything conciliatory from any of those places (and I do try to tune in to see what other Americans are hearing and reading) - the fear-mongering is dreadful. I have seen nice, kind friends posting and sharing the most horrible things, based solely on fear and personal attack. Unless our media becomes a better source of actual news and facts, the public will remain largely ignorant and fearful. The vaunted Fourth Estate has an important role to play in any sort of democratic process. The other piece of the puzzle is to get people to listen and understand and be tolerant of other viewpoints. I hope the American people will wake up from this long electoral nightmare and realize we are all in this together.
2 | Barbara Hickman | 4 | 10154743597648675_10154744074753675 | It will take a long time with great effort to put away the unreasoning hate raised up by this election. It will do so because the 2 parties main candidates will not bring about the remedies needed for both peace and prosperity and fairness. The Republican party of hate will keep promoting unreasonable hate while stripping everybody of rights and assets in the name of the 1% and criminal biz. They have pursued a steady coarse of oppression tactics that would lead to a takeover excuse. The Dems will continue to strip assets & rights as well in the name of the 1%, criminal biz. They prefer to leave the guise of freedom in place while ruling from a 1% mindset/lifestyle. What can unite people is to support bills that reduce economic inequality (there is more than enough in the world to provide a dignified life for all so long as it is not confined to the 1% for whom it will never be enough to satisfy their every whim). Support bills that restore the rights of citizens which have been been usurped and remove the rights provided to business. Support & enforce bills which criminalize, penalize, and mandate jail time for white collar crimes and the business leadership doing them. Restore equal justice for the nation. Remove GMOs and toxic additives in the food supply, and restore the protective powers to federal agencies for food, water, air, environment. Prevent revolving door between government and business. Cap health care payments for everything  (services, drugs, everything). Stop the revolving door between bought science research and industry aims. Stop gerrymandering. Protect unions & support living wages for workers, disabled, and elderly. Revamp banking law and restore separation of service & investment banking from speculation & so-called insurance.
3 | Bob Elliott | 6 | 10154743597648675_10154744076568675 | Why is it always on the winner to heal the divisions?  As we've seen under Obama, when Republicans start his term on day 1 with a meeting to discuss how they will oppose everything, even things they have previously supported, for the sole purpose of making him a failure, it's kind of hard for the winner to heal those divisions.
4 | David Smith | 1 | 10154743597648675_10154744011703675 | The media bias doesn't stop at PBS. Minorities aren't running from Trump,  according to polls he has a larger portion with him than Romney did. Hillary isn't winning solid either, many swing states show very close battles. Smh.
5 | Stephani Falasha Masego | 2 | 10154743597648675_10154744000978675 | The good thing is that the Clinton's, Bush's and Trumps are getting so old now that after this nightmare election cycle ends, hopefully, we can get some fresh new blood in there who can straighten out the train wreck that baby boomers have caused for the past 20 years.
6 | AJ Rosales | 0 | 10154743597648675_10154744072228675 | Oh come on. You know that it's impossible for a candidate to achieve any rational progress on this issue. This is too big of a social problem to tackle. We as the American people need to figure out the way to unify ourselves. Leaving it up to the legislators is entirely too passive and it's the thing that got us into this mess in the first place.
7 | Liz Feeser-Regan | 0 | 10154743597648675_10154744196733675 | There was NO wounds in politics until Obama took office and the Republicans could not stand the fact a black man was our President, not only our President but the best of most of our life times.

10 | Ken Licau | 5 | 10154743597648675_10154743994928675 | As an independant, the choice came down to this. If I had more legitmate/viable choices I would choose someone other than these two. For whatever reason, we the people and especially the mainstream media hold republicans to a higher standard and would NEVER allow Trump to get away with even half Hillary's corruption and or incompetence (it has to be one or the other or a combo). In addition, although I would love to see a woman POTUS, Hillary as POTUS would dishonor the sex and probably embarrass it as well.

3 | Clarence Eddy | 3 | 10154743901298675_10154743903783675 | I'm supporting the candidate who is the most intellectually and emotionally qualified, with the most relevant experience and the most coherent, feasible policies and ideas and who is least likely to get us into an international catastrophe because of some perceived slight to a fragile ego. It doesn't matter that she's a woman. Hillary Clinton's contributions to American society as a woman are many, but the overall theme of her efforts is that she has continued to stay involved in fighting for all of us! Hillary helped create and pass the children's health insurance program, giving 8 million children health insurance. Hillary helped pass Obamacare, which brought my previously unaffordable insurance down to $85/month.  My car insurance, from Insurance Panda, is now just $25/month. But watching the media coverage, it is painfully obvious that women are judged differently and painfully familiar to any woman with a business career.Regardless of the gravity of the position that she seeks, she is taken to task because she is too serious and doesn't smile enough. Really??? Of course, if she were jolly, the complaint would be that she is frivolous. Or that she is loyal to her husband despite his infidelities. Really??? Of course, if she had had three husbands, then it would be that she was promiscuous. Or that she doesn't have the stamina. Really??? I'd love to see her opponent face a grilling for 11 hours by a gang of hostile Congressional representatives looking for the tiniest slip. Her election won't end the silly stereotypes. But it be the beginning of the end, finally.

A majority of Floridians have already spoken. Two years ago, nearly 58 percent of voters said doctors should be able to prescribe medical marijuana for people with certain conditions. But because 60 percent is needed to pass a state constitutional amendment, the measure died.  This year, the push to legalize medical marijuana is back as Amendment 2.

1 | Michael Curd | 12 | 10154742466623675_10154743896113675 | I'm just going to put this out there, anyone who votes for Hillary Clinton is either a braindead feminist or a traitor to the American people, she will not make a good president and she never will, and I'm not saying that because she's a woman, I'm saying that because she's a criminal and should be thrown in jail, and the only way that that can happen is if Trump becomes president.

10 | John DeWindt | 1 | 10154742466623675_10154743879288675 | Hi, my name is Hillary Clinton & I am running for president and here are my qualifications.A: I have been in politics for many years. I was the First Lady. I was a senator. I was the Secretary of State.B: I have admired a woman who refers to black people as weeds who need to be exterminated. I also admired one of the leaders of the KKK. However, I call Donald Trump a racist.C: When my husband could not keep his pony in the barn, I lied for him and put more blame on the women.D: I falsely claimed to not know it was wrong to use an insecure server for government business. I also stated that I did not know the letter "C" meant classified.E: When I was asked to turn over the emails on that insecure server I deleted them, and then bleached my hard drive. I also smashed my other communication devices. However, I had nothing to hide.F: As Secretary of State I ignored several urgent requests to send reinforcements to our US embassy in Benghazi. When that same embassy was attacked causing death to several military personnel, I lied about what caused the attack.G: When questioned about the matter I claimed not to remember factual information many times over.H: Both my husband and I have become extremely rich during our political careers, but we never did favors for money.I: During the primary debates the head of the DNC tipped the scales against my opponent, however, I decided to make her part of my personal campaign staff.J: The present head of the DNC leaked questions to me prior to debates, etc.K: I am once again under investigation concerning possible new emails that have surfaced on the computer of the estranged husband if my closest aide. I have no idea how they got on his computer, but I expect everyone to believe I am not a security risk.L: Many things have surfaced on WikiLeaks against me --- however Russia is behind those dang WikiLeaks.M: I often hide from the press. This makes it easier for me not to have to address any of the above items.G: Our Clinton foundation is under investigation and I will probably be indicted for pay to play.H: FBI revealed my server was hacked, good bye national security.I: I want to take in hundreds of thousands of refugees even though many Americans and our Veterans are needy. I also want to give benefits to people who entered our country illegally. I guess I don't know the meaning of charity begins at home first with our own needy citizens, including senior citizens.I am sure I have left out some of my wonderful qualifications. I think you get the picture.
11 | Rick Doty | 1 | 10154742466623675_10154743915728675 | Bill & Hillary Clinton, total liars!!!AN ANALYSIS WORTH READING: by Dick. Morris, former political advisor to President Bill ClintonIf you happen to see the Bill Clinton five minute TV ad for Hillary in which he introduces the commercial by saying ... He wants to share some things we may not know about Hillary's background . . beware as I was there for most of their presidency and know them better than just about anyone, I offer a few corrections:Bill says: "In law school Hillary worked on legal services for the poor."The facts are: Hillary's main extra-curricular activity in law school was helping the Black Panthers, on trial in Connecticut for torturing and killing a federal agent.She went to court every day as part of a law student monitoring committee trying to spot civil rights violations and develop grounds for appeal.Bill says: "Hillary spent a year after graduation working on a children's rights project for poor kids."The facts are: Hillary interned with Bob Truehaft, the head of the California Communist Party. She met Bob when he represented the Panthers and traveled all the way to San Francisco to take an internship with him.Bill says: "Hillary could have written her own job ticket, but she turned down all the lucrative job offers."The facts are: She flunked the DC bar exam. Yes, flunked. It is a matter of record. She only passed the Arkansas bar. She had no job offers in Arkansas, none, and only got hired by the University of Arkansas Law School at Fayetteville because Bill was already teaching there. She did not join the prestigious Rose Law Firm until Bill became Arkansas Attorney General and was made a partner only after he was elected Arkansas Governor.Bill says: "President Carter appointed Hillary to the Legal Services Board of Directors and she became its chairman."The facts are: The appointment was in exchange for Bill's support for Carter in his 1980 primary against Ted Kennedy. Hillary then became chairman in a coup in which she won a majority away from Carter's choice to be chairman.Bill says: "She served on the board of the Arkansas Children's Hospital."The facts are: Yes she did. But her main board activity, not mentioned by Bill, was to sit on the Wal-Mart board of directors, for a substantial fee. She was silent about their labor and health care practices.Bill says: "Hillary didn't succeed at getting health care for all Americans in 1994 but she kept working at it and helped to create the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) that provides five million children with health insurance."The facts are: Hillary had nothing to do with creating CHIP. It was included in the budget deal between Clinton and Republican Majority Leader Senator Trent Lott. I know; I helped to negotiate the deal. The money came half from the budget deal and half from the Attorney Generals' tobacco settlement. Hillary had nothing to do with either source of funds.Bill says: "Hillary was the face of America all over the world."The facts are: Her visits were part of a program to get her out of town so that Bill would not appear weak by feeding stories that Hillary was running the White House.Her visits abroad were entirely touristic and symbolic and there was no substantive diplomacy on any of them.Bill says: "Hillary was an excellent Senator who kept fighting for children's and women's issues."The facts are: Other than totally meaningless legislation like changing the names on courthouses and post offices, she has passed only four substantive pieces of legislation.One set up a national park in Puerto Rico. A second provided respite care for family members helping their relatives through Alzheimer's or other conditions. And two were routine bills to aid 911 victims and responders which were sponsored by the entire NY delegation.For all of you who doubt the above post I dare you to research it on the net you will find it all is true
12 | Jane Youngblood | 1 | 10154742466623675_10154743855693675 | I voted Gary Johnson, America is going broke already. Minimum wage is 9 dollars here now, already hard to find a job.

19 | Joyce Lee | 0 | 10154742466623675_10154743798968675 | Hillary Clinton poses the greater risk.  She's already proven herself to be a criminal. She's used her political position in the past to exchange political favors for money (watch Clinton Cash: https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&v=7LYRUOd_QoM&app=desktop) The Clintons have collected hundreds of millions of dollars for Haiti through their fake charity organization the Clinton Foundation. Most of that money didn't make it to the Haitian people, but went instead into their own pockets. The Haitians are still protesting the Clintons to this day. Read article in link--http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/07/18/meme-thanking-president-donald-trump-for-stopping-the-clintons-goes-viral-online/?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social  She's a globalist who has helped ISIS and terrorist nations while also receiving funding from them, probably, once again, in exchange for political favors.  She protects a serial rapist for decades and threatens rape victims, she's threat. The rapist in question: Bill Clinton. In no way, has she been the longsuffering victim wife. She's enabled Bill by covering up for him and seeking to get rid of the women who could testify against him. Watch video interview of political insider who exposes the Clinton's War on Women: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzZgoTOb2Gg&feature=share After everything Obama's done to tear down and divide this nation, Clinton wants to carry on his legacy.  Despite the craziness happening in Europe and the increasing Muslim terrorist attacks, she wants to bring one million Muslims into America in her first term, without a proper vetting process. No doubt, countless radical jihadists will slip into our country as a consequence. It's foolish!  She's already compromised our national security by sharing easily accessed classified information.  She abandoned four Americans, because of wanting to serve her diplomatic and political aims in another country over and above the security of America and Americans.  She's been the poster child for media censorship and media bias.  She's threatened to make America like Australia by taking away and Second Amendment rights.  There's a suspicious body count following both of the Clintons' political careers and the list goes on and on and on. To top it all off, she's chronically lied about these issues and has gotten away with numerous counts of breaking the law and endangering our nation.  Maybe, it's just me, but I don't think that history and those qualities make for a safe, good president! She's already shown us who she is and what she's capable of. Don't let her ruin this nation altogether with corruption, greed, scandal, lies and mob-style run government that shuts people up by threatening them or even killing them.

Exterminate the black race because they are like "weeds". (Margaret Sanger quote) Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.üëÅ‚ö†If you are a Christian, Why are you voting for Hillary Clinton when she wrote her Senior thesis on Saul Alinsky who dedicated his book 'Rules for Radicals' to Lucifer (the Devil)? She says he was, and still is her mentor.üëÅ‚ö†If you are a Veteran, in the Military, or closely related to a Military member, Why are you voting for Hillary when she left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again? They called for help but the help was told to stand down.üëÅ‚ö†If you have a factory job, Why are you voting for Hillary when she supported TPP? Factory workers are being laid off because jobs are going over seas. Don't forget the deals she's made with china. She also welcomes open borders and illegals to get benefits to be paid with Your tax money.üëÅ‚ö†If you are poor, Why are you voting for Hillary, when she is supporting Wall street and all the big banks? Big banks keep poor people poor by destroying the poor man's credit by allowing medical bills and collections to affect your credit scores so you can pay higher interest rates than the rich; Taking much of the little money you earn.üëÅ‚ö†If you are a Woman, how can you vote for Hillary when she has buried all of Bills rape victims under the rug, including that little girl that was raped? Lawyer Hillary defended the rapist, and then she laughed about it later, knowing that he was guilty.If you carry a gun, or believe in the Constitution; How can you vote for Hillary when she wants to eliminate the NRA, Take your guns, and abolish the second Amendment?üëÅ‚ö†If you breathe, Why would you vote for Hillary when she and the Clinton crime family have left a trail of dead people that did not agree with her, or they knew too much?Who is left? üëÅ VOTE TRUMP!!!

(Y)http://www.unitedforcare.org/TALLAHASSEE ‚Äî Come Nov. 8, Florida could be the 26th state to legalize full-strength medical marijuana for patients with cancer, epilepsy and a host of other conditions.  A majority of Floridians have already spoken. Two years ago, nearly 58 percent of voters said doctors should be able to prescribe medical marijuana for people with certain conditions. But because 60 percent is needed to pass a state constitutional amendment, the measure died.  This year, the push to legalize medical marijuana is back as Amendment 2. Once again, we urge voters to say "yes."http://www.sun-sentinel.com/opinion/endorsements/fl-endorse-medical-marijuana-20161003-story.htmlhttps://www.facebook.com/YesOn2Florida/https://www.facebook.com/UnitedForCare/https://www.facebook.com/JohnMorganESQ/Norml of Florida...https://www.facebook.com/groups/208044745901442/

How one Syrian refugee family is trying to find their footing in the U.S. while holding on to their heritage.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Veronica-Ron Lechner | 21 | 10154742477613675_10154742843723675 | Welcome to America!! It will get better for your family with time and patience! Wish that your family was closer to other Syrian families to help make the transition easier. I can't imagine how scary it would be to live in another country without other family and friends and to have limited language skills. Stay strong!!!
2 | Sj Lag | 11 | 10154742477613675_10154742802693675 | Felt so sorry for this family,help is only Twenty Miles away. I do hope they are able to move and receive effective help. What a crazy system. My Heart goes out to the whole family.
3 | Lani Oliver Rounds | 4 | 10154742477613675_10154743732093675 | I was very fortunate to meet to wonderful Syrian teens (Muslim girls) this summer who are living in Utah. I asked what they loved most about the US. They said how clean and safe it was and that they are in school. I asked if they planned to ever go back to Syria and they said, "Yes, when it is safe we would love to return home." They lived in a refugee camp for 18 months before the UN was able to find a place for them to live. I felt proud to live in a state that has made a little room for a family to feel safe.
4 | Marilyn Maskell | 2 | 10154742477613675_10154744143838675 | Isn't it interesting how white immigrants get to hold on to their heritage, but people of color are condemned for doing so?   We need more compassion and understanding, not to mention education about others.
5 | Joy Merling | 0 | 10154742477613675_10154744078928675 | Its is awful to resettle these people in the US. They should be closer to home (in the middle east) where they speak the language, food, weather and culture is about the same. Its like taking a polar bear to the desert... its not right.
6 | Kate Burkes | 4 | 10154742477613675_10154743637923675 | Their best hope is to keep their kids in school, and do everything they can to make a better life for the next generation.  It is typical that the first generation suffers with such a move, and I agree that more could be done for the newly arrived.  But the hope is always in the children.
7 | Kathy Dendy | 9 | 10154742477613675_10154742805188675 | They can go back to Syria...they are refugees not citizens....refugees should only be in another place until they can return to their country....
8 | Ikaren Shaskan | 0 | 10154742477613675_10154744038888675 | it would have been wiser to put them in a different spot.. in 56they relocated hungarian refugees all overt hat area.. there were churches and other social thingss available to them.. also there were many single men as well.
9 | Tamara Weaver | 0 | 10154742477613675_10154744194003675 | Sounds like the mayor and others - after seeing this - are stepping up to give them more emotional support. They need to be closer to others who speak their language and can help them learn English

1 | AL Kendrick | 22 | 10154742475968675_10154742698893675 | As a lifelong democrat and self respecting centrist independent I hope that this year's campaign will prompt Republicans to look deep and reassess their core values.
2 | Sj Lag | 4 | 10154742475968675_10154742712558675 | I think this was an unusual year, a Perfect Storm, each side had issues that many in their own party could not accept. Will Latinos stay active I certainly hope so just please make the parties accountable, you can vote a person in and vote a politician out. Be aware of them all.

If you vote for Hillary Clinton; you MUST VOTE BLUE FOR SENATE AND CONGRESS. We need a government that works together from EVERY STATE. #STRONGERTOGETHER #50Union
4 | Brian Norberg | 1 | 10154742475968675_10154742710653675 | Hillary Clinton and the DNC have set us up for a decade of lame Republican rule and continued gridlock.  Because of her hubris HRC has forced her way into the nomination this year and if she wins she will remain unpopular on the right and the left.  In the 2018 midterms Democrats are faced with an raft full of Senate races they have to defend.  Meaning they will most likely lose the Senate.  And  in 2020(assuming HRC wins tomorrow) Hillary Clinton will try and get a second term. Which if this election is any indication she will lose.  Not only will she lose but I would bet she will lose to someone like Paul Ryan.  Which will give the Republicans the House, the Senate and the Whitehouse.  And this will happen right after the next census insuring massive gerrymandering by the Republicans.  So to those of us on the left.  If you want any chance of significant change you had better get it out of Hillary in the next two years.  Because after that you are SOL.  That is why the left must stay mobilized.  If we want any change we have to push for it starting November 9th.

1 | Brent Woods | 5 | 10154742447503675_10154742662783675 | No matter who wins election day, I will never view the Newshour as unbiased news again and will not be a regular viewer... Tonight when they kind of a wrap up of the election cycle.. they did have one republican view at the table.. So if nothing else I am thankful to Trump for pulling back the curtain on the American liberal press and elite class..
2 | Dwight Collins Duarte | 1 | 10154742447503675_10154743283223675 | when the refugees arrive and the rapes and murders start, the press won't tell you...because crooked is what crooked does and the media along with hillary is crooked...
3 | Mari Adams | 1 | 10154742447503675_10154742814048675 | This page has upheld the myth of false equivalency between the two candidates and I will no longer support public media financially

If you vote for Hillary Clinton; you MUST VOTE BLUE FOR SENATE AND CONGRESS. We need a government that works together from EVERY STATE. #STRONGERTOGETHER #50Union
5 | Larry McCutcheon | 1 | 10154742447503675_10154742822568675 | They shoot everyone who doesn't vote the right way? Well it done to ensure polls work and network gets good ratings who wins is not important ! Otherwise why did mainstream media lie for two years
6 | Richard Gougeon | 1 | 10154742447503675_10154742700993675 | Two national tracking polls show Donald Trump in the lead over Hillary Clinton in the closing days of the election, one with Trump showing a massive lead. In the Los Angeles Times/University of Southern California Dornsife tracking poll, Trump leads by a margin of 48.2 percent to 42.5 percent, a margin of almost 6 points. Meanwhile, the Investors Business Daily tracking poll ‚Äî one of the most accurate polls in recent electoral history ‚Äî shows Trump leading by 1 point, 44 percent to 43 percent.
7 | Brian Babcock | 0 | 10154742447503675_10154743890053675 | There should be a blackout until ALL the polls are closed. I'm tired of the election being "called" before the West Coast even finishes voting.
8 | Edward StJean | 0 | 10154742447503675_10154742690503675 | Should say how trump WILL win! The movement is too strong, the American middle class has united across all lines and the swamp will be drained! Budgets balanced, borders secured, jobs created, a nation reunited, a military strengthened, and a nation saved from corruption.
9 | Scottas Sevelis | 0 | 10154742447503675_10154742763163675 | Since Republican Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves to today, the Democratic Party has bred hate and divisiveness..........It won't end with HILLARY! Democrats are just for ME, not US. That PARTY is soon to be over!
10 | Randy Jacobs | 2 | 10154742447503675_10154742729973675 | Don't count your chickens before they hatch... early returns, nationally, show 3rd party with 20%+ of the votes... which could easily deprive either candidate of 270....The Millenials could easily turn this whole thing on its head...
11 | Pattie Schaefer | 0 | 10154742447503675_10154742719258675 | ‚ö†Ô∏èIf you are Gay, Why are you voting for Hillary when she wants to bring in thousands of refugees that believe all Gays should be executed?üëÅ‚ö†Ô∏èIf you are Black, Why are you voting for Hillary when she admires Margaret Sanger and defends Planned Parenthood who want to abort as many black babies as possible? Exterminate the black race because they are like "weeds". (Margaret Sanger quote) Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.üëÅ‚ö†Ô∏èIf you are a Christian, Why are you voting for Hillary Clinton when she wrote her Senior thesis on Saul Alinsky who dedicated his book 'Rules for Radicals' to Lucifer (the Devil)? She says he was, and still is her mentor.üëÅ‚ö†Ô∏èIf you are a Veteran, in the Military, or closely related to a Military member, Why are you voting for Hillary when she left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again? They called for help but the help was told to stand down.üëÅ‚ö†Ô∏èIf you have a factory job, Why are you voting for Hillary when she supported TPP? Factory workers are being laid off because jobs are going over seas. Don't forget the deals she's made with china. She also welcomes open borders and illegals to get benefits to be paid with Your tax money.üëÅ‚ö†Ô∏èIf you are poor, Why are you voting for Hillary, when she is supporting Wall street and all the big banks? Big banks keep poor people poor by destroying the poor man's credit by allowing medical bills and collections to affect your credit scores so you can pay higher interest rates than the rich; Taking much of the little money you earn.üëÅ‚ö†Ô∏èIf you are a Woman, how can you vote for Hillary when she has buried all of Bills rape victims under the rug, including that little girl that was raped? Lawyer Hillary defended the rapist, and then she laughed about it later, knowing that he was guilty.If you carry a gun, or believe in the Constitution; How can you vote for Hillary when she wants to eliminate the NRA, Take your guns, and abolish the second Amendment?üëÅ‚ö†Ô∏èIf you breathe, Why would you vote for Hillary when she and the Clinton crime family have left a trail of dead people that did not agree with her, or they knew too much?Who is left?
12 | Bobby McKinley | 0 | 10154742447503675_10154742688998675 | Hillary is evil and you people are fools! How could you be so blind? You should be ashamed of yourselves. We are the underdogs and have fought to expose the truth while you sit back and do nothing but follow the leader. The world is changing and Hillary will continue the status quo but we will continue to fight and grow until we get our country back from this treasonous, heartless TRAITOR...:((
13 | Dwight Collins Duarte | 0 | 10154742447503675_10154743281298675 | never concede because the press says you lost....they want you to concede because then nobody will really care what the count is...
14 | Rode Tmcil | 5 | 10154742447503675_10154742639933675 | I love you Mrs. Clinton i know you will be a great president and you will inspire a lot of female american's young and old all around the US we need you in the white house vote for hillary!! #Imwithher

20 | Marcus Hochman | 0 | 10154742447503675_10154742782058675 | 'Twas the night before the election, when all through the nation Not a constituent was stirring, not even a pundit;The polling were hung by the chimney with care,In hopes that Cooper Anderson would soon declare;The deplorables were nestled all snug in their beds,While visions of Making America Great Again danced in their heads;And Hillary in her Orange Overalls, and Bill in his FBI cap,Had just settled down and wonder how did she beat that rap,When out on Social Media there arose such a chatter,I sprang for my Smart Phone to see what was the Latest Trump Twitter.Away to the window I flew in a flash,Tore open the shutters and threw up in the trash.

22 | Jack Greer | 1 | 10154742447503675_10154743401328675 | The media has tried to convince America that this election is a "horse race" since it's conception!  Why?  Because Donald Trump is their "cash cow" buying air time and providing a "story a day" that helped stoke ratings!  We need a media that reports the news, limits the purchasing of air time for negative ads and sticks to the facts instead of dwelling on the innuendo.
23 | Richard Klein | 0 | 10154742447503675_10154742743263675 | People understand Stronger Together is the grand design for human survival and, a peace of mind. I love I'm with the party of beautiful caring people with a great convention and, historical speeches. I fear nothing when, ‚ÄúLove Trump‚Äôs Hate!‚Äù? The sky is not falling when, ‚ÄúLove Trump‚Äôs Hate!‚Äù Yes, I favor the democrat issues. My healthcare is good and, I feel great when, ‚ÄúLove Trump‚Äôs Hate!‚Äù I selected my own primary care doctor and, gained few essentials too.           So, if you think some of Trump‚Äôs voters are going to stop us from being Stronger Together, you are so wrong! We don‚Äôt mean any ill feelings when, ‚ÄúLove Trump‚Äôs Hate!‚Äù I realize some may have gotten a grudge when, ‚ÄúLove Trump‚Äôs Hate!‚Äù But, that‚Äôs you and, not us. Democrats will lift the world with this Latinos, ‚ÄúLove Trump‚Äôs Hate!‚Äù vote of love. ‚ÄúLove Trump‚Äôs Hate!‚Äù is the reason Republicans will try to skate! ‚ÄúLove Trump‚Äôs Hate!‚Äù is needed badly for our FBI!             America doesn‚Äôt have all these varieties of tastes because; you select the same thing every time you go to the store.  The immigrants along with you, that brings many tastes and likes is the reason for all the varieties. The world is much better with all of these ‚Äúvarieties‚Äù and, ‚Äúlikes‚Äù no doubt why; ‚ÄúLove Trump‚Äôs Hate!‚Äù is our fieriest battle cry! Yes, ‚ÄúLove Trump‚Äôs Hate!‚Äù it‚Äôs no lie! ‚ÄúLove Trump‚Äôs Hate!‚Äù is how we fly! ‚ÄúLove Trump‚Äôs Hate!‚Äù by Hillary and I. We‚Äôre ‚ÄúStronger Together!‚Äù with her from the Middle Class out!

It‚Äôs been a long, strange trip to Election Day.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Tim Fisher | 6 | 10154742433553675_10154742586533675 | We've known who Clinton is for decades. Trump has had a year to prove he's even close to her ability and character and be a respectable alternative. He failed, utterly. He's going to lose, bigly. Rig that.
2 | Lisa McGahee | 1 | 10154742433553675_10154742686773675 | 'Twas the night before Elections and all through the country, not one issue was forgotten, not even Donald Trump's money; the ballots were  put into the computers with care, in hopes that every citizen, even immigrants and refugees would all be treated fair. The donkeys and elephants were nestled and snug in their cage, while dreaming of women being paid the same wage. Hillary in her red suit and Donald in blue, had just looked over their first 100 day plans to see how they'll do. When online on Twitter, there rose such vitriolic banter, I quickly grabbed my phone to see what was the matter; I logged onto my account in a flash, only to see a comment from the GOP front runner, to be dismissed as brash. The responses and backlash had created quite a show, the immense retweets and favorites made me say no. When what to my wandering eyes should appear, a tweet from Miss Clinton, that was seen all across the northern hemisphere. "Delete your account" she said, oh no she didn't... Only to elicit responses like "You should be in prison!" Two candidates, both lively and quick, one tempered and the other quite impolitic. Their supporters are both very devout, "a basket of deplorables" is quite the name to tout; other names to be mentioned this election season were Sean Hannity, Alicia Machado, Obama, and Putin. From building walls to opening borders, something about this whole thing seems out of order; deleted emails and sexual assault, both candidates have serious faults. So when you choose to vote this election season, please make sure you do it with reason. Whether you want to Make America Great Again or You're With Her, don't blame the election results on the a rigged system, the "liberal media," or NBC's Katy Tur. As the decision draws near and almost out of sight, happy election to all and to all a goodnight!- Author: Isaiah McGahee (myself, first time voter) 11/7/2016

5 | Rizwan Elahi | 2 | 10154742433553675_10154742650783675 | In a way Trump is fooling his own voters. He is saying what they want to hear. Once he is elected he will change and he will simply say , Yes I was wrong , what I know now I should not have said this and that. You can save this post for record , His voters will be the on who will be disappointed.
6 | William Isenberg | 1 | 10154742433553675_10154742535893675 | The 2 party system is a con of good cop bad cop. Read the Princeton / Northwestern University study proving the USA is a corp oligarchy. There is no difference in willful ignorance of far left, far right. The red color coded team are for those that feel and have beliefs and the blue color coded team are told they are thinkers, lol,.so with that well aimed for 50, 50 divide it is not hard for those corp oligarchs to control gov by shifting a small percent on either side to claim majority support
7 | Chad Ashton Robbins | 2 | 10154742433553675_10154742544123675 | If Clinton wins, this country is gonna be a bloated nanny state where nobody can say mean things to each other unless you want to be put on timeout. It's gonna be ran like a single moms house.
8 | Richard Gougeon | 1 | 10154742433553675_10154742634638675 | Huma Abedin, top aide to Democrat presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton, reported to the FBI that Obama was well aware that Hillary Clinton used a private email server while secretary of state. ‚ÄúThe same time everybody else learned it through news reports,‚Äù the president claimed. . Obama has spent nearly two years distancing from it. He used an alias to communicate with Clinton on her private accounts. The link had been set up by his team and was approved. Huma Abedin also told the FBI that she had to notify the White House every time Clinton changed her email address. This is another admission that Obama knew and approved of Clinton‚Äôs private server and use of private email for classified and highly sensitive government business.

Having lost his patience with the constant spewing of anti-Russia propaganda - missing the bigger picture of vicious circle towards muclear confrontation - Putin implored the western media, for the sake of the world, to listen:We know year by year what's going to happen, and they know that we know. It's only you that they tell tall tales to, and you buy it, and spread it to the citizens of your countries. You people in turn do not feel a sense of the impending danger - this is what worries me. How do you not understand that the world is being pulled in an irreversible direction? While they pretend that nothing is going on. I don't know how to get through to you anymore.In calm tones, not reflective of the angry allegations lobbed at Americans every day of a Russia hell-bent on the election of Trump (for whatever reason they dreamed up of this week), Putin reminded a 'deaf' press corps of what lies ahead and implicitly what happens if and when Americans vote for Hillary.And, as Lawrence Murray (via Atlantic Centurion) explains why Donald Trump is the anti-war candidate...From the Jordan to the Moskva, war drums beat. The powder keg that set off the first world war was ethno-religious conflict in the lands of the former Ottoman Empire, and in a sense it threatens to do so once more. The Balkan nations were not impressed with the botched settling of the Eastern Question, and a mix of state and non-state actors took matters into their own hands, leading to a globalized conflict. As late as 2006,  the borders of the region were still being contested, when Montenegro voted to break away from Serbia.Today, millions of people in the Levant, especially in Syria and Iraq, reject the imposed settlement of their borders. These were drawn by imperialists and zionists nearly a century ago under the Sykes-Picot Agreement to serve the interests of Britain, France, and the overseas Israeli community‚Äîand the successors of those diplomats wish to maintain those same borders. The ethno-religious conflict I am  referring to in the former Ottoman Empire is of course the:Syrian civil warIraqi civil warTurkish-Kurdish conflictAmerican intervention in IraqAmerican intervention in SyriaIranian intervention in IraqIranian intervention in SyriaRussian intervention in SyriaHezbollah campaign in SyriaYemeni civil warLibyan civil warNATO intervention in LibyaEgyptian counter-insurgencyWar on Terror / global Islamic jihadUS-Russian Middle Eastern proxy war

They're offensive Hillary Clinton and DNC words used to categorize entire groups of people. Hillary says that Trump should be nice to people? Perhaps she should look in the mirror and lead by example.
16 | Omar P√©rez | 1 | 10154742433553675_10154742600778675 | Trump is a man with a vision for America, not a specific vision, a great vision...the best vision...Trump has a plan to make this country great again....What plan??....a great plan...a plan that will work because it's the best plan.....Why???... because Trump knows good people...which people???....the best people....people that are not stupid like other people....people who know how to get deals done...what deals???...great deals...the biggest deals... because I know words... What words???...I have the best words... I get my information from watching TV... I consult with myself because I have a great brain... A great brain???...the best brain...Trump will also build a big wall to keep Mexicans out and he will make Mexico pay for it!...How....??? its all part of the great plan!...ISIS will be gone very, very quickly...How???... I won't tell you.. It's a secret !!!... (This guy is a ‚Äúone-man circle jerk‚Äù and he is only about entertaining the uneducated who love him and his great plan. He's all air - no substance.

Tired of hitting the refresh button on the election forecast? Hear what America's young people want to see from the next president of the United States. http://srlletters2nextprez.tumblr.com #2NextPrez
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Derek Ryter | 2 | 10154742199818675_10154742441838675 | I agree, but the president can't do that much about it. The Koch take over of the state legislatures is what is killing higher ed and forcing kids to take out loans. It's the states and change has to start in the states.
2 | Robert Barnes | 10 | 10154742199818675_10154742357538675 | The real problem is that higher ed. is a business. Period. Just like health care, the people in the field are maximizing profit even if they claim to be non-profit.
3 | Ike Udechukwu | 2 | 10154742199818675_10154742510578675 | These young people need to understand that this election was simply about good and evil. You cannot talk about environment and college if you accidentally elect an evil person as your President. Evil people do not care about environment and education costs.
4 | S John Martin | 0 | 10154742199818675_10154743186413675 | No, because you'll have more useful idiots studying useless degrees...the cost should be seen as forming part o the judgement call, "is this degree worthwhile"In most cases the answer is noHeck, look at Cape Town Uni, now science is racist
5 | Bryan Evans | 1 | 10154742199818675_10154742414733675 | Maybe we should consider eliminating student loans and just letting students make reasonable interest free payments to the school.
6 | Aurelio Varela | 0 | 10154742199818675_10154743281493675 | The Drug voting blockIn the USA almost anybody can vote.Take a drug test of all voters and a large portion will be drug users/abusersDrug use might not seem like a big deal, but just enough use of it damages the brain. People become Liberals, Leftists, Extremists, Democrats just because they want to keep getting their fix frm Mexico, Colombia, Middle East, etc.The addicts will become violent if their supply is threatened by Racists, Police, Politicians and other enemies.
7 | Marti White | 3 | 10154742199818675_10154742374183675 | I  watched 60-Minutes a few weeks ago:  OMG, My heart is Still Racing from the REMINDER that the POTUS, can give the order (alllllll BY HERSELF, or by Himself) to Decide in 8 minutes to END CIVILIZATION!

"Clinton‚Äôs win in the first debate increased her odds of winning the election by about 6 percentage points, from roughly 63 percent to 69 percent."

1 | Daniel Carvajal Reyna | 83 | 10154742212433675_10154742294218675 | Of course they don't. when the FBI reopened the email fiasco the markets took a dive because they feared Donald could be president now that it's closed again the markets have bounced back. Talk about sending a message.
2 | Jennifer Knox | 17 | 10154742212433675_10154742336683675 | I work in future pricing, as a consultant, and it's been really hard for me to recommend signing a contract during this season - if HRC wins, the price will still have value but if Orange wins, it might be a risk.  I can't wait until this is sorted tomorrow.

4 | Chris Martens | 8 | 10154742212433675_10154742304748675 | Clinton is Wall Street's candidate. Everyone knows that. She'll do whatever they want, same as Bill. Of course they don't like the idea of their puppet losing to Trump.
5 | Timothy Vandyk | 0 | 10154742212433675_10154743782933675 | Wow! Bon Jovi and Lady Gaga, two more of the wealthy elite class, who will never have to compete for a job with an illegal immigrant, who will never need Obamacare, and who have performed for the Venezuelan socialist elite, supporting Hillary. Enough said.
6 | Peter Mertz | 4 | 10154742212433675_10154742312218675 | Well that is the one sector of America that does have a interest in seeing Hillary win. The economics of the Clintons is to artificially inflate the stock market. That is good news for them at least until the bubble bursts.
7 | John Constantine | 2 | 10154742212433675_10154742311493675 | So! I pulled all my money out last year waiting for real values eto return after a major correction that's due, I may sit out a whole Clinton presidential term if Hillary is elected!
8 | Howard Dolan | 0 | 10154742212433675_10154743744228675 | If Hillary wins and gives away everything she promises, hyper inflation will occur, but the good news is I have a wheel-barrel to carry my money to buy bread.
9 | David Hathaway | 1 | 10154742212433675_10154742312358675 | Pollsters and odds makers have been woefully inaccurate this past year or so, which makes me wonder about the forecasts for tomorrow's election.Consider Brexit for one. On the day of that vote, all the top bookies had pegged likelihood of a pro-leave outcome at very distant odds. By mid day, those odds had flipped. By the end of the day Brexiters won, against all odds.We also saw this with the Bernie campaign where the media giants abandoned their exit polling ostensibly because those forecasts had been so grossly inaccurate. It could turn out the polling numbers we are seeing once again are virtually meaningless.

15 | Stephanie Marie | 4 | 10154742212433675_10154742309353675 | I'm really tired of the left saying that most Trump supporters are uneducated whites. OK. Does that mean that most Clinton supporters are uneducated minorities? Most Americans don't hold a Bachelor's degree and very few still hold a master's or higher. Does that mean that any of them aren't competent enough to make an informed decision? Shame on you if you think so. By the way, this Trump supporter holds three degrees.

We have the largest income gap, largest wealth gap, and largest deficit in the history of the US. Hillary Clinton is a free trade globalist shill. Voted for 6 free trade agreements while Senator and called the TPP (thanks Obama!) the "gold standard" of free trade agreements. Her ‚Äúdream (dream!) is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders.‚Äù.

24 | Dennis G. McAuliffe | 0 | 10154742212433675_10154742375808675 | so tell us what is good about Donald Trump‚Äôs presidency which will ‚Äúsignificantly‚Äù weaken the country, his tax cuts would add 9.5 Trillion to the debt,  driving the U.S. into a ‚Äúlengthy recession‚Äù with nearly 3.5 million job losses and a 7 percent unemployment rate, according to a Moody‚Äôs Analytics analysis.The tax code under Mr. Trump‚Äôs plan will be much less progressive than the current tax code. More than one-third of the proposed tax cuts on personal income will go to the top 1% of income earners, with the average taxpayer in this group receiving a reduction in their tax bill of $275,000. Taxpayers in the bottom 99% of income earners will receive a tax cut of less than $2,500.Under Trump's plan, the conservative Tax Foundation expects that the bottom 80 percent of Americans will see just 0.8 percent to 1.8 percent more income after his tax cuts. Clinton's plan will only increase taxes for America's wealthiest earners.The large increase in tariffs on Chinese and Mexican imports supported by Mr. Trump further exacerbates inflation pressures. The U.S. imports nearly $500 billion in goods a year from China, and another almost $300 billion from Mexico, accounting for approximately 35% of total U.S. non-petroleum goods imports. Outside of Canada, no other country comes close as a source of imports. Slapping a 45% tariff on Chinese imports and 35% on non-petroleum Mexican imports thus increases overall goods import prices by approximately 15%.would most likely retaliate with in-kind tariffs on U.S. imports. This would be a big hit to U.S. exports, as we ship well over $100 billion in products a year to China, and almost $250 billion to Mexico.And the problem with trumps outspoken approach to Mexican immigration, his ‚Äúplan‚Äù to deport 11 million undocumented immigrants would shrink the economy by about 2 percent, according to American Action Forum (AAF), a conservative and pro-business think tank. The sudden subtraction of 7 million workers would cause an immediate shock to thousands of businesses, triggering a GDP collapse ranging from $400 billion to $600 billion in productionNot to overlook Donald Trump who casts himself as a protector of workers and jobs, but a USA TODAY NETWORK investigation found hundreds of people ‚Äì carpenters, dishwashers, painters, even his own lawyers ‚Äì who say he didn‚Äôt pay them for their work. And uses undocumented labor along with Chinese Steel over American for his hotels and resorts !

Conversations with voters at Trump and Clinton campaign stops underscored just how divided and angry many voters feel as the election comes to its merciful end.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Renzo Palma | 93 | 10154742006008675_10154742196728675 | There's nothing wrong with fearing hatred; it's natural, it's survival. On the other hand worshipping hatred is wrong; it's tribalistic, it's barbaric. Trump and the Republican extremists called the "Alt-Right" are the "Global Warming" of "Global Xenophobia". We can no longer be in denial of the rise of bigoted political factions; no longer be in denial of the outbreak of militant White Nationalists; no longer ignore a cancer of racism metastasized in a tumor called Trump. And we must attend to this civic blight. The treatment for this condition is voting blue. #Imwithher
2 | Kevin O'Day | 100 | 10154742006008675_10154742175813675 | Speaking of draining the swamp and why there is so much hatred and fear, it should not be lost on voters as to which party wants campaign finance reform and to overturn Citizen's United and which party generally likes our campaign and electoral process just the way it is (or longer, costlier and uglier if possible)..  vote blue.
3 | Kirsten Baxter | 55 | 10154742006008675_10154742205698675 | Fear is rational.  Hatred isn't rational.  The things that come out of Trump's mouth, and the mouths of far too many of his supporters, are terrifying.  Hatred is vile, and it has no business being the motivation behind how we run this country.
4 | Michelle Vancil-Osborne | 22 | 10154742006008675_10154742215618675 | I'm going straight home tomorrow after work, bypassing my stop at my local YMCA for a much needed, stress reducing swim, to be safely tucked away from the anger and hatred that have engulfed my community.  I voted, but feel afraid to say to any of my neighbors that I supported Hillary Clinton in fear of retaliation.
5 | Lora Blankenship | 22 | 10154742006008675_10154742298238675 | I wasn't angry until Trump started inciting violence, threats, and hate among his minions. They're gullible enough to actually believe that he gives a rat's a-- about anyone other than himself.
6 | Bkak Jones | 23 | 10154742006008675_10154742215843675 | If Trump wins, it will be because voters have resigned to the bigotry and ignorance of the worst of us. I am volunteering in every way I can to make sure voters come out and reject Donald Trump.

Hate leads to suffering.‚ÄùEven Yoda knows they're equally bad. The trump supporters are just one step further along.It's too bad we rolled over and accepted the theft of the nomination of the one candidate who offered more than fear and hate.
10 | AJ Rosales | 2 | 10154742006008675_10154742354263675 | There is no end to this madness, not when half the country still wants to vote for Trump. This is not a divide, it is a rift. The only partial comfort in this scenario is if the senate turns to a democratic majority. At least their false outrage won't matter quite as much.
11 | Keith John Sampson | 17 | 10154742006008675_10154742177778675 | Tricky Dick Nixon had his Enemies List and that led his downfall. Dirty Don Trump has his Enemies List that includes his political opponents, and members of the Media. Nixon thought he was above the Constitution.  Trump does not even believe in the United States Constitution.
12 | Rafael Dietsch | 0 | 10154742006008675_10154742775328675 | Tomorrow you have a date with the story.Do not vote your vote.You will vote in these elections for envy and delinquency or for decency, hope and progress.We have heard how Hillary has turned this presidential campaign into a vaginal campaign.We have seen how the powerful and the press continue to mock the people and hide the evidence of delinquencies.You have thought like a man like Donald Trump with a very good financial situation, with a model family with some exemplary grandchildren and the only thing that does not have are many years to live.Because he has dedicated his time in wanting to be president when this in addition to all the problems represents a great loss in his income and a great decrease in his finances.Instead of enjoying the product of the sacrifice of your whole life, enjoy your family your grandchildren during your remaining years of life.Only a man who thinks about his family and his country can make a sacrifice in the way that Donald Trump is doing it and it is very unpleasant for people without criteria to get carried away by a professional of lies and delinquency.Ask yourself if you had 10% of Donald Trump's fortune and had a family like him. Professional children, respectful, without any vices, no alcohol not drugs not like other families who can not say the same. Think about whether you would run for president.Donald Trump can get more money out of his business than he can get as president, he will not have time to enjoy his family while in office.Righteousness has again failed the American people. 650,000 e-mails can not be reviewed in 5 or 6 days, so only the intimidation and pressure caused the FBI to make the statements it made.But now it is up to the American people to impart the justice they did not give. Think well before you vote so you will not regret it. Today the results of Obama Care and the abusive changes in giving a sinecures to health insurance companies to administer medicaid rather than being administered by the government has made those with Medicaid have hundreds of problems because depending on The company doctors leave the companies because they do not pay or do not pay on time and if the citizen has the company that the doctor no longer accepts then he has to pay copayment. This is just another abuse of the Obama-Clinton government.Think about whether you want to lose the rights you have acquired after 50 years of average work.Vote Donald Trump and Forget the Siren Songs
13 | Christopher Cleary | 0 | 10154742006008675_10154744077788675 | Divided and angry? There is one group backing a xenophobic, homophobic, misogynistic, ignorant bigot, and the other group is backing a lifelong public servant. All this election did was pull the hate groups out into the open, and now we now who they are. Looking forward to the first Madam President.
14 | Randi Eitzman | 1 | 10154742006008675_10154742205428675 | This is the deal I've offered (SHARE):So, how about all the "hesitant Clinton" and "hesitant Trump" voters just get together and agree to both dump their party and vote for Johnson together. As for the dedicated party voters, carry on. üëçüèª Nothing to see here.
15 | Kathy Maguire Schwend | 3 | 10154742006008675_10154742475603675 | I don't  buy it. I see more hatred coming from liberals than i ever see from conservatives. Hands down this is bogus except for liberals being in fear. They say that ALL the time and then proceed to name calling those that disagree with THEIR views. Thats hatred. So. i call bs.
16 | Preston W Mcguire | 0 | 10154742006008675_10154742396148675 | So we are all upset. Everyone agree's our politicians have gotten out of control and are not looking out for us dem/rep both. So why are people even considering a vote for Hillary? She is a rich , elitist, white,old woman, who hasnt even drove a car for 30 years. Trump isnt a great choice but the other side of the coin is just crooked politics as usual.
17 | David Smith | 5 | 10154742006008675_10154742209918675 | Funny....the only hate I have seen is dems tearing down Trump signs and burning Trump election offices. The dems have been paying people to start fights at Trump rallies......PBS is blatantly nevertrump and part of the corrupt media machine.

And when this terror ‚Äî which was sown in the peripheries, with the massacres, looting, oppression and injustice ‚Äî explodes in centers with different forms of violence, even hateful and cowardly attacks, citizens who still retain some rights are tempted to the false security of physical or social walls. Walls that enclose some and banish others. Walled citizens, terrified on one side, excluded, exiled, and still more terrified on the other. Is that the life that our Father God wants for their children?" Pope Francis
19 | Brian Norberg | 6 | 10154742006008675_10154742178188675 | Hillary Clinton and the DNC have set us up for a decade of lame Republican rule and continued gridlock.  Because of her hubris HRC has forced her way into the nomination this year and if she wins she will remain unpopular on the right and the left.  In the 2018 midterms Democrats are faced with an raft full of Senate races they have to defend.  Meaning they will most likely lose the Senate.  And  in 2020(assuming HRC wins tomorrow) Hillary Clinton will try and get a second term. Which if this election is any indication she will lose.  Not only will she lose but I would bet she will lose to someone like Paul Ryan.  Which will give the Republicans the House, the Senate and the Whitehouse.  And this will happen right after the next census insuring massive gerrymandering by the Republicans.  So to those of us on the left.  If you want any chance of significant change you had better get it out of Hillary in the next two years.  Because after that you are SOL.  That is why the left must stay mobilized.  If we want any change we have to push for it starting November 9th.  That is why we have to push even when we think we will lose.
20 | Kristy Webb Lalonde | 3 | 10154742006008675_10154742255108675 | CNN needs to be the first media outlet to go when they begin to drain the swamp. What nonsense. The hatred is from the democrats inciting violence by paying people to do it. Crazy....
21 | G.d. Hawksley | 1 | 10154742006008675_10154742383738675 | My fear is that as divisive as this horrible election has been, what comes after might look too much the same, and if it goes to the Supreme Court again, it will be a tie vote....
22 | Francine Fries Morof | 0 | 10154742006008675_10154743450908675 | Believe me, Daniel Bush, there is fear and hatred on BOTH sides. Don't tell me Trump people aren't fearing a Clinton presidency and Clinton supporters don't hate.
23 | Alexa Delroy | 1 | 10154742006008675_10154742665683675 | Don't bother with fear, DO WHAT YOU CAN. Vote any way you can.

Americans head to the polls Tuesday to elect the 45th president of the United States. But there are several interesting races that have flown under the radar this year.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Sharon Pugh | 0 | 10154741913593675_10154742144088675 | The Indiana governor's race is not the only important race. Evan Bayh is trying to win a seat back in the Senate from a Tea Party Congressman, Todd Young. I think Gregg will carry the day because of the devisive religious legislation that Pence got through the legislature: RFRA and burial of aborted fetuses. Apparently the governor doesn't know his biology, but enough said of that matter. Evan Bayh has been attacked by every Republican pact that exists. I find it incongruous since Dan Coats is retiring from his 6 year term. Coats had been a lobbyist before returning to the Senate to do what Bayh is being sought to do by the Democrats. Neither of these men has lived in Indiana for decades. Don't worry. Most Hoosiers would rather not be confused by the facts. We used to have a rather intelligent electorate here, but all the educated seem to have left.

7 | Vicki Thornburg Welsh | 39 | 10154742051798675_10154742090048675 | Friends voting early in Cincinnati, Ohio report no intimation. Friendly orderly lines, up to 2 hours, and folks passing out food. Seems like a good cross section of folks.
8 | Lois Walters | 16 | 10154742051798675_10154742083548675 | Oh my.. I can honestly tell you that people don't recognize you as a neighbor at the polls.  The gerrymandering of the voting areas makes sure of that.
9 | Maria A Perez | 17 | 10154742051798675_10154742234653675 | We voted since November 2, love to do things in advance and avoid lines and unpleasant surprises. My husband and I, my 4 daughters and son voted earlier..........Democrats all the way.

--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Dave Powers | 31 | 10154741971168675_10154742039483675 | #MyVotePBS this year and cycle is to do my part to STOP THE #DonaldTrump MADNESS! I am concerned about all of the talk on the right, and while I recognize that they have legitimate gripes, the choice that they "made" for a leader is completely unacceptable. The man is unfit, unprepared, and unready to be POTUS.
2 | Jacki Watkins | 37 | 10154741971168675_10154742027968675 | This is the 10th time I've voted in a Presidential election....I don't need motivation to vote...it's not just a right, it's not just a privilege, it is our duty as Americans to vote!!  #myVotePBS
3 | William H Boley | 15 | 10154741971168675_10154742039553675 | I'm voting to preserve our democracy, or what's left of it, from the divisiveness and hate that threatens to tear it apart. That's #MyVotePBS.
4 | Pamela Scully | 12 | 10154741971168675_10154742064413675 | Because I am outraged by the racism and misogyny and hatred for people exhibited by one of the candidates. And because we need again to believe in the state as a vehicle for making people's lives better. We have to find a way to make the US function better for everyone. And yes, It is our duty to vote given all that so many people have sacrificed reaching back at least as far as the era of Reconstruction. I think of Frederick Douglass, Sojourner Truth, Susan B Anthony, Ida B. Wells,  MLK, all the student heroes of the civil rights movement, the list goes on. We have to vote.
5 | Robin Williams Collica | 19 | 10154741971168675_10154742047123675 | I vote in every election. Voting is my responsibility as a good citizen. I will be excited to cast my ballot for Hillary Clinton.
6 | Tina Jordan Hughes | 17 | 10154741971168675_10154742065683675 | I always vote. This year my motivation is not wanting to wake up one day and find out we've entered World War III over a tweet.
7 | Sara DeLuca | 7 | 10154741971168675_10154742118823675 | A vote for Hillary is a vote for intelligence, experience, inclusion, human rights (yes, including women's rights), concern for the common good. This country can not afford the damaging alternative.
8 | Janine Nelson | 6 | 10154741971168675_10154742060463675 | As an American citizen, I have had the honor to vote since I turned 18. No matter where I have lived, I believe we can make changes through the ballot box. I do my research and have a decent understanding of economics. That said, I have to wonder why so many people vote to pay more money for fewer services or benefits. Don't get me wrong, I don't believe the government should control every aspect of my life. It goes too far sometimes.  But, It's my right and duty to make decisions based on facts that support our democracy and way of life.
9 | Julia Morris | 18 | 10154741971168675_10154742045023675 | I am voting because Donald Trump is a Nazi monster who brought racism and hate in the campaign. He is truly dangerous and can never be in the Whtehouse. I want the GOps that created him to be voted out also. All the GOPs do is investigate and when they don't get what they want investigate Hillary again. It's shameful and they have wasted millions of our tax dollars.
10 | Lourdes Diaz | 9 | 10154741971168675_10154742072563675 | I'm voting this year FOR Hillary Clinton, a capable, intelligent, hard-working woman) and AGAINST Donald Trump to show that ALL votes (Hispanics, Mexicans, Muslims, the disabled, women, African-Americans) matter when you want to be the President of the UNITED States. KARMA on November 8.
11 | Fontaine Pearson | 9 | 10154741971168675_10154742071013675 | Platforms. Hillary Clinton has the platforms that I agree with it even though she is more hawkish that I am. I'm especially concerned about insurance and where this country is going economically. Donald Trump had no platforms I could agree with except term limits. Butthr bottom line for me is that I think he is profoundly dangerous.
12 | Betsy Walters | 3 | 10154741971168675_10154742081633675 | #myVotePBS I always vote; I feel it is my duty an a citizen. This year the lies from the alt right have finally metastasized into the ugliest scene I can remember. I feel passionate about this. These days I vote by mail so that I can relax a little rather than go crazy about the voting scene.
13 | Julie Rosenwinkel | 7 | 10154741971168675_10154742040918675 | Trying to make sure Hillary does not take us to war with Russia over Syria and hope whoever gets in stops giving Saudis and Qatar the funders of ISIS more weapons contracts.
14 | Carol Conaway | 5 | 10154741971168675_10154742111603675 | This year, it's a fear of fascism.  Gerrymandering, voting restrictions and Citizens United have diluted the democratic process.  Now an authoritarian strongman, channeling the unfocused anger of a population that gleefully rejects all information that does garner the approval of their orange-faced God, has taken advantage of these weaknesses and has a possible path to the presidency.  Any person who would vote for someone whose own campaign cannot trust with a twitter account needs to seriously question his or her love of country.  If we put an impulsive, vindictive child in the Oval Office, we will all pay very dearly for many, many years to come.
15 | Daria Rackovitch Buchanan Kowal | 6 | 10154741971168675_10154742154888675 | This year I decided to due an absentee ballot because it was not going to be easy for me to get to the poles. Being that my Mom is 87 and my Dad will be 90 the day after the election I got them absentee ballots as well. I sat with bot of them and assisted them in filling out their ballots....... It was thrilling for me to watch my Mom be able to vote for a woman for President......... Even more exciting to see my Dad choose a woman to vote for for President !!!!!
16 | Kat Russell | 9 | 10154741971168675_10154742055023675 | I am a Climate Change voter. Hillary has an extensive plan to mitigate Climate Change, and to prepare for it since we will need to deal with it. Her infrastructure redevelopment plans will put people to work in alternative energy. So smart. We can't wait any longer.
17 | Erica Kough | 3 | 10154741971168675_10154742154063675 | Supreme Court to be more progressive, and to protect civil rights. Education, lower the cost of college and bring more funding into our schools. More clean energy jobs and environmental protection. Guess who I'm voting for, lol #myVotePBS I'm a 36 yr old married, white female, with some college, and school age kids.
18 | Ann Weymouth Dean | 2 | 10154741971168675_10154742181598675 | I've voted in every election since I was old enough. I've been a poll worker as well. I believe in democracy, in our country, in the future. And I am afraid of the divisive actions and words of the GOP.
19 | Lisa Nolan Lindsay | 3 | 10154741971168675_10154742036323675 | Because my parents raised me right! I voted last week. Thanks for the best political coverage, #MyVotePBS
20 | Russ Williams | 4 | 10154741971168675_10154742073908675 | I am simply maintaining the charade. Clinton Inc., The DNC, and Mainstream Media (including PBS NewsHour https://www.facebook.com/wikileaks/photos/a.206387512729702.43344.108734602494994/1142868019081642/?type=3&theater ) have made a mockery of our democratic processes.  It is now proven, beyond any reasonable doubt, that PBS and other "news" corporations are nothing more than propagandists for the oligarchs and our personal votes are worthless. The entire American Political system is a fraudulent and corrupt sham. How do you people that purport to be "ethical journalists" look at yourselves in the mirror? I am ashamed for you.
21 | Elizabeth Scott | 3 | 10154741971168675_10154742151098675 | If you don't vote you can't complain about what is going on in government. Also to know that I am voting for a woman! Added bonus.. Finally, Donald Trump, really?
22 | Lori Cook | 4 | 10154741971168675_10154742078748675 | I always Vote in Presidential Elections. This has been the most negative and depressing election ever. Donald Trump is a pretty scary candidate. Starting his campaign out attacking Hispanics was awful. Then he really never offered many policy details of how he planned to accomplish the agenda he talked about. The complaining and talk of rigged media and elections just made him an even less attractive choice for President.
23 | Cindy Swaidan | 1 | 10154741971168675_10154742515303675 | #myVotePBS I'm voting blue all up and down my ballot Because as a military spouse it absolutely terrifies me to think of an unstable man being commander in chief. I'm also an #ImmigrationVoter because we REALLY REALLY need immigration reform that includes a pathway to citizenship for all the good, hard working people who unfortunately are undocumented right now. I am also voting blue because I value education, and have SO many people close to me with huge student debt - and they need relief. Also because I don't want my kids to have to get in terrible debt for an education. I could go on but those are my main 3.
24 | William P. Kuhn | 0 | 10154741971168675_10154743160098675 | This is the least excited and most ashamed I've ever been to vote. I'm doing it, by all the goodness left in me, but I don't want to. My government, you stink, in the most horrible way. I feel less of a human because of our disgusting options and lack of hope. DNC, you did this, RNC I've never liked you and you did it to Ron Paul. Government system.... ugh.. I will vote but really? Please let something happen to save us all from THIS!
25 | Susan Graham | 0 | 10154741971168675_10154742400183675 | I always vote.  It is my way to take part in the democratic process. If I didn't vote, I don't believe I can complain about what goes wrong or take credit for good outcomes.  It is my right and my duty.  Millions have fought and died for Americans to have the right to vote.  We owe them this much.#MyVotePBS.

A second Harvard men's athletic team has been rating female athletes' physical appearances for years, The Harvard Crimson reported.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Paula Kay Schmidt | 31 | 10154741845483675_10154741955833675 | hopefully this will be a wake up call for people. Your misogyny, racism, and criticism of people who are 'different' is no longer acceptable behavior. Get a life
2 | Kimberlee Oller McKinniss | 13 | 10154741845483675_10154742084893675 | It is so sad that so many see nothing wrong with this behavior.  Men judge women, woman judge me, boys judge girls, girl judge boys... really because one does it, it okay for others. It wrong , no matter who is doing it. And people wonder why college campus rape / sexual assult numbers continue to rise. It's all okay, until it's your daughter or son, or family members.  Sad, just sad.
3 | John Kaye | 5 | 10154741845483675_10154741945228675 | This is news! Harvard students judging others. Unheard of. Next the women are going to start judging men. I remember the good old days when Harvard was male only. Then they could judge those not attending, like Yalies. It was always fun judging them.
4 | Jeanne Senay | 3 | 10154741845483675_10154742538973675 | And the senior captain is embarrassed by the 2014 spreadsheet but continued to think it was ok to have a spreadsheet! Really? My husband is an alumni and I can tell you he has no tolerance for this kind of behavior. Personally none of these males would be allowed in my home. My rating is F!
5 | Sj Lag | 6 | 10154741845483675_10154742026153675 | The Harvard Cross-country Team was using spread sheets with vile language to rate their fellow Cross-country athletes who were female. Accordingly to this article this has been going on for years. Fire the coaches that knew and allowed this abusive tactic to continue and cancel the rest of the season. Name the individuals who were responsible for taking part in this , sanction them. Time to clean up the Ivy League, send them home to Mom......
6 | Philip B Noreen | 14 | 10154741845483675_10154741998698675 | This is the culture that brought us a spoon feed pussy grabbing presidential embarrassment

Literally, it's the only place where young men are able to create social structures where older men impose so little on younger mens' behavior.  It's a circumstance worth pondering.  Same for the ladies, but it's a little less crucial, I think.

9 | Bryan Chris | 4 | 10154741845483675_10154742130963675 | People have been rating others on their looks since time immemorial. It happens on both sides of the gender fence and there are numerous websites devoted to it. It may not be the most civilized behaviour, but it's hardly news.

ANY hacker worth his Salt most likely could disrupt an election, but the effort to do so would be Paramount, and just plain not worth it! It would take insiders to do so, all of which would have to be paid substantially and have secured exits from the USA standing by if they get caught. That would take some SERIOUS cash! And Russia clearly can not afford to squander their money on some other country's problems. - Get real...

Say goodby to our country and it's safety and more illegals taking jobs and more drugs and crime cuz she won't fix that. People who have guns will have less rights and less options. She is nothing but lies and evil. I learned more about Trump and he is actually a really nice guy, I was told it is like when an actor has a role he has to play, he is just playing his tough role, but when he is with people and family he very nice. He says thank you more than anyone I have ever heard. He truly does care about the direction our country has been going since Obama, and it isn't in a good way, and he wants to turn it around. With her, we are getting another 4 years of Obama and worse. And if you vote for anyone else, it is a vote for her. So, if you don't want Hillary, choose Trump, or we will get Hillary.

4 | Rebecca Laskey | 6 | 10154741593573675_10154741670898675 | DONALD TRUMP ANNOUNCEMENT ~ REGARDING THE NEWSWEEK REPORT:TRUMP IS A ‚ÄúHUGE‚Äù NATIONAL SECURITY RISK BECAUSE OF HIS BUSINESS, FINANCIAL AND PERSONAL TIES TO RUSSIA, CHINA, SAUDI ARABIA, IRAN, ETC‚Ä¶..In a stunning and damning expose just released, the truth behind the ties between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin are revealed, and American allies in Europe are growing increasingly concerned by Russian espionage and its interference in the U.S. election.A Friday Newsweek article by Kurt Eichenwald reveals the truth behind the Trump campaign and its ties to Russia‚Äôs President Vladimir Putin. It also shows the history behind Russia‚Äôs support of the Republican candidate through espionage and cyberattacks discovered by both U.S. and allied European intelligence agencies.According to Eichenwald, American allies are concerned about Russian interference in the U.S. election and that Donald Trump‚Äôs statements denying any collusion in recent cyberattacks have only encouraged Putin to become more aggressive in his espionage against Western countries. Eichenwald cites the input of government officials, law enforcement officers, and intelligence agencies in both the U.S. and Europe.According to information gained by Western allied intelligence sources, the Kremlin‚Äôs interference into the U.S. election is aimed more at crippling Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in revenge for what Putin felt was interference in Russian elections. Clinton‚Äôs statement in 2011, saying the Russian election was ‚Äúneither free nor fair‚Äú in regards to obvious cheating, has sent Putin into a rage and made him determined to destroy Clinton. Putin was also enticed by Trump‚Äôs compliments of his strength as a leader.Some of the information gained by Western intelligence sources reveal that Donald Trump has been surrounded by a number of advisers with ties to Putin or with financial and family ties to Russia. Former campaign manager Paul Manafort was forced to resign when it was revealed that he had ties to a pro-Russian Ukraine official. Carter Page, another former Trump adviser, is being investigated by U.S. and European intelligence agencies for engaging in back-channel discussions with Russian officials. Intelligence has also revealed that Trump adviser Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn is intimately tied to RT, a Russian news agency involved in distributing Russian propaganda.Donald Trump and his campaign have also been found to be spreading Russian propaganda. The Kremlin has been distributing misinformation as part of their normal activities via various networks, through both anonymous internet trolls, RT, and Sputnik, another propaganda news source. A manipulated document from one of the anonymous internet sources found itself being recited by Trump at a campaign rally. The campaign has also been spreading rumors from Sputnik, including a piece attacking Newsweek that was forwarded by Trump staff to a number of reporters in the U.S. with requests that those reporters pursue the false story.In accordance with his position as presidential nominee, U.S. intelligence agencies have briefed Trump about Russia‚Äôs attempts to influence the election, but Trump has persisted in publicly denying these serious allegations, calling them unreliable, and dismissing them as possibly being perpetrated by some ‚Äú400-pound guy sitting on their bed‚Äù or even a child.European officials have told Newsweek that Trump‚Äôs statements have alarmed our NATO partners, because Trump refuses to believe the intelligence briefings he received or simply doesn‚Äôt understand them. They are also convinced that Trump could be misleading the American people for reasons of his own.One British official said that members of the U.K. government who are fully aware of Russia‚Äôs interference find Trump‚Äôs response ‚Äúquite disturbing.‚Äù They‚Äôre concerned that should he be elected, Trump would ignore and dismiss his own and allied intelligence services.Western law enforcement and intelligence agencies say that the Russian hacking and disinformation campaign includes tens of thousands of people in Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Novosibirsk. They say there are also operations inside the United States, working from New York City, Miami, and Washington D.C., mainly using Russian immigrants, although other foreign nationals and American citizens are also involved. According to intelligence received, those involved are being paid via a Russian pension scheme. One U.S. official told Newsweek that evidence shows that many of the Americans and other foreign nationals involved are unaware that they are part of Russia‚Äôs propaganda machine.American intelligence is also aware that Russia used cyber espionage and propaganda to interfere with other elections in the West, including the German elections last month and the June Brexit vote in the U.K., the results of both of which weakened the ties between those countries and the EU and NATO.According to a European intelligence expert, Russia is releasing its disinformation to disrupt the U.S. election through WikiLeaks, but states that the ‚Äúpipeline‚Äù through which the information flows contains numerous steps and so many filters that it is likely that the WikiLeaks organization itself does not know the source of the information.Interestingly enough, despite the Russian president‚Äôs support of Donald Trump, at one point, support for the Republican nominee was halted due to his volatile and unstable nature. According to intelligence sources, the Kremlin backed off supporting Trump when he attacked the Kahn Gold Star family publicly. The Kremlin assumed that the nominee would be forced to withdraw from the race due to his psychological unfitness, so put the hacking campaign on hold. According to reports provided to Western intelligence sources, even Putin thought Trump was unfit to be president, despite the advantages to him of a Trump presidency.According to information provided to Western intelligence agencies, Putin is satisfied that his campaign of cyber espionage has turned the tide in his direction. Putin has told his associates that even if Clinton wins the White House, she will be too busy rectifying the chaos that his leaked misinformation has wrought to interfere with his plans in Syria, Ukraine, and elsewhere.European allies are particularly stunned by Donald Trump‚Äôs refusal to credit his own intelligence services, and British officials were particularly horrified when Trump dismissed the validity of those sources. According to one British official the most disturbing evidence of Trump‚Äôs negligence was during the third presidential debate. In rebuttal to Clinton‚Äôs accusation that he was encouraging Russian cyberattacks, Trump said that she had no idea where the cyberattacks were coming from.‚ÄòHillary, you have no idea‚Ä¶ Our country has no idea.‚ÄôAccording to Newsweek, all of our intelligence sources and those of our NATO allies know that Russia is behind the hacking. Although Trump has been briefed, he continues to dismiss the information. Eichenwald sums up the exposes with some chilling thoughts:‚ÄòShould the United States, the last remaining superpower, tilt its policies away from NATO to the benefit of Russia, the alliance between America and Western Europe could be transformed in unprecedented ways. And so, for perhaps the first time since World War II, countries in Western Europe fear that the American election, should Trump win, could trigger events that imperil their national security and do potentially irreparable harm to the alliances that have kept the continent safe for decades.‚ÄôTop Pentagon Commanders: We'll Quit if Trump is Elected:http://occupydemocrats.com/2016/05/11/top-pentagon-commanders-well-quit-trump-becomes-commander-chief-2/IF YOU CARE, SHARE!

"The clear trend is away from the death penalty," according to one expert.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Angie Quinn | 15 | 10154741555343675_10154741901803675 | no. the death penalty does nothing to deter crime (states without it actually have lower murder rates per deathpenaltyinfo.org). the cost to taxpayers, for a case where the death penalty is sought, is roughly 2 - 3 times that of a case where it is not sought: it actually is 'cheaper to keep'em'. we are quickly (and in some states have literally) running out of space to jail people (AL for example). then there's the issue of back-logged DNA kits ~ several hundreds of thousands ~ either improperly processed and/or tested...or worse, not being processed at all.
2 | Jose Olvera | 3 | 10154741555343675_10154741859438675 | I think that is a Matter to be handle to all these child predators  Sexual abusers .And any violent crimes. Crimes were the executor as no moral or mercy for their Victims.Them folks should be put to dead .Immediately. After the crime.And in from of Everyone.A public Execution .With all these Rapers
3 | Marilyn Maskell | 7 | 10154741555343675_10154741705198675 | Only if the evidence is indisputable. Too many have been convicted on "eyewitness" accounts (dubious at times), by evidence sometimes manufactured, or by coerced confessions.
4 | Doug Sawyer | 9 | 10154741555343675_10154741686013675 | USA is one off very few civilized countries that still executes people , it's a barbaric antiquated practice that has proven to do nothing to deter crime. It's time the US caught up with the rest of the free world in this area and many others.
5 | Bill Byrn | 6 | 10154741555343675_10154741642663675 | I personally don't have a problem with it.I see it from the point of view of tax dollars. Why pay for a guy to live if he is never coming out. (After he runs out of appeals).Repeat offenders, sexual predators, child molesters,etc....Have a consensus on where the cut-off line is the start the injection line.I do not see the rehabilitation argument. If you're not an honest, working contributing citizen then get in the injection line.
6 | Patricia Abbott | 9 | 10154741555343675_10154741702668675 | The death penalty has never proved to be a deterrent. The appeals process is very costly to taxpayers. It should be abolished on a national basis. Note:  The US is one of very few countries that still practices the death penalty:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment_by_country
7 | Laura A Moreira | 0 | 10154741555343675_10154743725258675 | I can't help but notice that according to this graph, the last time public opinion reversed on the death penalty, in the pro direction, coincided with the Civil Rights Act in the 60s. The persistence of racism in this country is depressing.
8 | Tamara Mason | 11 | 10154741555343675_10154741647948675 | Look at all the people who've been cleared/exonerated through DNA evidence, The Innocence Project and similar organizations. You can't undo death. You can't say "my bad, we thought we had the right guy. Oops..."
9 | Kylee Moore | 0 | 10154741555343675_10154743511118675 | My observation: People who fear punishment tend to support the death penalty. They believe that a deterrent for them is a deterrent for all.There is also an element of justice through punishment. We hear about justice being served and think of the survivors. But really, what justice do they get? They've lost a loved one. There is nothing you can do to the perpetrator to reconcile the crime.
10 | Chuck Bruffey | 0 | 10154741555343675_10154742221813675 | If Prop 62 passes on Tuesday then we should put San Quentin up for sale on Wednesday!  This old prison is only open because of the death row and is unsafe for inmates and guards alike.  The property some years ago was estimated to be worth about $2 Billion, money that could be used for anything but a prison and no prisoner should have an oceanfront cell!!
11 | Angel Morini | 4 | 10154741555343675_10154741677283675 | It's never clear that the person they are killing did that or any other crime. Police and prosecutors just want to pin it on someone so they can pat themselves on the back. What is clear that the serial rapist/killer would do a lot less raping and killing if rape kits were processed and a national database were established. Because while the guy who didn't do it is languishing on death row, the guy who did it is out there doing it again and again.
12 | Bruce Mccoy | 1 | 10154741555343675_10154742431018675 | Life without possibility of parole is worse to many than death. For the public, they may have varying opinions, but it brings into question 'what is justice', and 'for whom'.  Is justice for the victims (and families) more important than justice for the general public? Western justice is based on 'an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth'. What moral equivalent is there for an alternative justice?
13 | Jayne Derwin | 4 | 10154741555343675_10154741741153675 | The more I read about the innocent people imprisoned and some getting their freedom finally, I am wavering on supporting the death penalty especially since there might be someone on death row who is innocent. Until this problem is solved, whether the system is executing an innocent man or woman or not, this type of sentence should be halted.
14 | Mike Eddington | 0 | 10154741555343675_10154741928608675 | Only in indisputable cases. In all criminal trials if prosecution misconduct convicts an innocent person then the sentence for the individuals responsible should be the same as the original sentence
15 | Michelle Heslop | 0 | 10154741555343675_10154744044628675 | For child rapist/killers I am. If there is indisputable evidence or confession or mass killing like a James Holmes. Yes I am for it.
16 | Lois Hackbarth | 0 | 10154741555343675_10154743031658675 | Life without parole has to be worse than death, in my opinion. The inmate should have to think about why he/she is locked up forever!  When put to death, it's over. (We really don't know what happens to criminals after death. We have lots of opinions but we really don't know for sure). Knowing that I would never know freedom ever would be devastating.
17 | Harry Brewick | 3 | 10154741555343675_10154741839963675 | I think the HIGH number of accused convicted being freed should be enough of a reason to stop the death penalty.
18 | Fawn Neun | 3 | 10154741555343675_10154741610663675 | I only think it's appropriate for the most egregious crimes: murder by torture, child rapists and killers, serial killers. That sort of thing.
19 | Suzy Davis | 4 | 10154741555343675_10154742072518675 | If you are pro-life.....how can you be for the death penalty.....
20 | Pahl Scharping | 3 | 10154741555343675_10154741983193675 | Given how many INNOCENT PEOPLE we've put to death, it's BETTER BE SAFE, THAN SORRY.
21 | Stephen Evans | 3 | 10154741555343675_10154741797488675 | I don't. To many mistakes have been made, and I don't think the state should have the power to kill even its deplorables.
22 | Shane Alg | 2 | 10154741555343675_10154741668738675 | PBS NewsHourEven those Americans supporting the death penalty are against it, when it means years of appeals and expensive trials. The lawyers like it though
23 | Terry Carpenter | 1 | 10154741555343675_10154741706388675 | We are all under a death penalty. All are appointed a time and place. We are without excuse.

8 | Scottas Sevelis | 2 | 10154741492518675_10154741697548675 | A Short List of Some of Hillary‚Äôs Many Crimes - share!Here are a few of Hillary‚Äôs crimes. Feel free to share.1. Perjury: Why not start with a blast from the Clinton past? Hillary Clinton signed documents testifying that she turned over all work-related emails to the State Department, on orders from a federal judge, under penalty of perjury. We already have indisputable proof she violated this sworn statement‚Ä¶ thousands of times. The cloud of false statements under oath surrounding Hillary Clinton is thousands of times thicker than the one around Bill. Democrats seem to have found a hidden clause in the Constitution that says Clintons can never be prosecuted for perjury, but Madame Secretary is really stress-testing that particular privilege of Clintonhood. One would think the federal judiciary had some interest in establishing that sworn documents must be taken seriously. 2. Obstruction of Justice: Bill Clinton‚Äôs primary motive for committing perjury was to obstruct justice‚Äîit was the second count in his impeachment. (The justice he was obstructing was a sexual harassment suit from Paula Jones, at a time when liberals insisted sexual harassment was the most overlooked, under-prosecuted crime in the legal code.) Hillary‚Äôs thousands of perjury counts are also related to the obstruction of justice. She held back documents she didn‚Äôt want Congress to see. She subverted the Freedom of Information Act, which is a law, not a lovely suggestion. Most media timelines of the Clinton email scandal are either incomplete or deliberately obtuse, because they almost never accurately relate how her secret server was discovered. For example, these timelines from USA Today, CNN, and ABC News all get it wrong. Sharyl Attkisson, who was a participant in the story, has an accurate timeline that makes the important point Clinton-friendly media outlets don‚Äôt want to talk about: we know about the secret server because the State Department was sued for failing to respond to FOIA requests. The State Department‚Äôs official story is that they were surprised to discover Clinton was withholding thousands of documents on her private computer. That‚Äôs straight-up obstruction of justice, in cases involving multiple federal courts, as surely as Bill Clinton‚Äôs impeachable offense of obstructing the Paula Jones suit. Clinton may become untouchable if the American people allow her into the White House, but the lawsuits don‚Äôt evaporate, and neither do the angry judges. 3. Bribery: After the FBI set off a headline earthquake by re-opening the Clinton email investigation, we learned that several other FBI investigations of Clintonworld have been quietly in progress for some time. One of those investigations is digging into bribery allegations against the Clinton Foundation. The FBI agents working on these cases were reportedly very angry that top Bureau and Justice Department officials were pressuring them to drop their investigations. The most attention-grabbing of these suspicions concerns an FBI official, Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, whose wife received an inexplicably huge political donation from Clinton bagman Terry McAuliffe, currently the governor of Virginia. The timing of this donation was so convenient that even the Left side of the blogosphere has produced some uneasy speculation that McCabe probably should have recused himself from all things Clinton-related. Well, he didn‚Äôt recuse himself, and the conflicts of interest are so apparent that the lack of a chiseled-in-stone quid pro quo might not be enough to kill this case off. After all, corrupt officials aren‚Äôt usually dumb enough to write down their quid pro quo agreements, or repeat them into microphones. The McCabe controversy already has longer legs than most observers expected, when the news first broke. 4. Pay for Play: There has also been recent confirmation that the FBI has investigated influence-peddling allegations against the Clinton Foundation, which was so obviously used for that purpose that it‚Äôs funny to watch Clinton apologists insist nothing can be proven in a court of law. Some of the most vigorous infighting within the Bureau reportedly concerns whether pay-for-play investigations should move forward. WikiLeaks has exposed emails from Clinton insiders that openly discuss how the Foundation was part of a network that steered millions of dollars to ‚ÄúBill Clinton Inc.‚Äù Even longtime members of the Clinton syndicate professed themselves troubled by these operations. They were also unhappy with arrangements like Hillary Clinton‚Äôs agreement to speak in Morocco after a $12 million donation to the Clinton Global Initiative. It‚Äôs entirely possible that more documentation about these suspicious Clinton Foundation dealings will come to light after the election, especially if some of the people Clinton took money from grow upset with her. It‚Äôs downright dangerous to have a President with so many strings attached. 5. Illegal Use of a Nonprofit Organization: There are many laws governing the management of charitable organizations, generally intended to prevent them from becoming money-laundering operations, ripoff operations, and vehicles for political influence peddling. The Clinton Foundation and its galaxy of related operations may eventually find itself answering some questions about compliance with those laws, assuming the IRS decides to stop focusing its efforts on hassling mom-and-pop pro-life groups and kitchen-table Tea Party outfits. If the Foundation is ever held to account for any other impropriety, charges of abusing a nonprofit should be part of the legal package as well. 6. Racketeering: Former prosecutor Andrew McCarthy has recently observed that Hillary Clinton‚Äôs abuse of the State Department looks an awful lot like a ‚Äúracketeering enterprise,‚Äù which could trigger the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act of 1971, more widely known as RICO. McCarthy explained: Under RICO, an ‚Äúenterprise‚Äù can be any association of people, informal or formal, illegitimate or legitimate ‚Äì it could be a Mafia family, an ostensibly charitable foundation, or a department of government. It is a racketeering enterprise if its affairs are conducted through ‚Äúa pattern of racketeering activity.‚Äù A ‚Äúpattern‚Äù means merely two or more violations of federal or state law; these violations constitute ‚Äúracketeering activity‚Äù if they are included among the extensive list of felonies laid out in the statute.7. Fraud: Wall Street analyst Charles Ortel has been building a case that the ‚ÄúClinton Charity Network,‚Äù as he calls the complete system of Clinton operations, has committed ‚Äúcharity fraud of epic proportions.‚Äù In part, he refers to discrepancies between donor accounts and the Clinton Foundation‚Äôs books. Others have pointed out how the Clinton Health Access Initiative has essentially ignored New York state law for years, without a peep from Attorney General Eric Schneiderman (who just happens to be part of the Clinton campaign‚Äôs ‚Äúleadership council.‚Äù) There are some interesting differences between the paperwork CHAI submitted to the IRS and what it submitted to the state of New York, which has more specific requirements about identifying foreign donors. In addition to getting a free pass on perjury, the Clintons are traditionally allowed to violate tax laws without penalty, eventually refiling paperwork when ‚Äúerrors‚Äù are discovered years after the fact. Another round of whoops-my-bad, no-harm-no-foul ‚Äúrefiling‚Äù during a Hillary Clinton presidency would be embarrassing, especially if she‚Äôs busy trying to ratchet up taxes on everyone else.

16 | Gabe Berg | 0 | 10154741492518675_10154742691343675 | So what about stuffing fake ballots in boxes with lookouts, what about voting twice in 2 different states, what about dead people voting for hillary, what about people only registering hillary voters. All those are just as important as race religion and gender.
17 | Marcia Tanabe | 0 | 10154741492518675_10154742279933675 | Election Officials Hide Potential Proof of Electronic Vote Rigging on Tuesday."Election officials across the country have denied requests from citizens to view and count the digital ballot images which are automatically generated in the majority of US voting precincts. The digital ballot images are a little-known feature of most US voting systems.""In the majority of paper ballot vote-counting machines, a marked ballot is fed into an optical device which reads and counts the votes and generates a digital image of the ballot all at once. The digital images are then stored in memory. The creation of digital ballot images was meant to serve as a back-up to the original paper ballot record. The images could be easily accessed, viewed, and counted without actually handling the paper ballots.""Election integrity activists are puzzled as to why election officials would want to keep the images from public view, except as a precursor to massive election fraud."

Say goodby to our country and it's safety and more illegals taking jobs and more drugs and crime cuz she won't fix that. People who have guns will have less rights and less options. She is nothing but lies and evil. I learned more about Trump and he is actually a really nice guy, I was told it is like when an actor has a role he has to play, he is just playing his tough role, but when he is with people and family he very nice. He says thank you more than anyone I have ever heard. He truly does care about the direction our country has been going since Obama, and it isn't in a good way, and he wants to turn it around. With her, we are getting another 4 years of Obama and worse. And if you vote for anyone else, it is a vote for her. So, if you don't want Hillary, choose Trump, or we will get Hillary.
