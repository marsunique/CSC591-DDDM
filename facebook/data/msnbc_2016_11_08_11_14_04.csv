Christine Adams survived Jim Crow, had to pass a literacy test to vote, and lived to see a black president.

1 | Marion Rohling | 8 | 1345694515526797_1345701852192730 | Imagine what this Woman has seen, has been through & has endured. For her, voting for a Woman must be so uplifting. We, who are younger don't vote for Hillary, BECAUSE she's a woman, that is just gravy, icing on the cake, but we vote for her, because she is what we need!
2 | Cosima Van Elgen | 3 | 1345694515526797_1345704698859112 | Wearing white today to honor the many women who died to get us to this moment. Of course, and typically - the woman who got there was abused and only made it by being so overqualified she cannot be denied. Yup. I'm nasty too.
3 | David Sillman | 1 | 1345694515526797_1345704848859097 | Fun fact: Jim Crow was manufactured by the rich white landowners in the South after the civil war to turn underpaid working class whites against underpaid working class blacks, so both exploited groups wouldn't turn against them. Sound familiar ... ?
4 | Shane Harness | 5 | 1345694515526797_1345703095525939 | This would be an embarrassment to have the first women president be a crooked and corrupted politician, women deserve to have the first one be one we can look up to. Not one that most likely will get impeached and tarnish the presidency forever.
5 | Mary McCarson | 4 | 1345694515526797_1345695768860005 | Pray. It puts everything in perspective on #ElectionDay.

9 | Jonathan Nelson | 1 | 1345694515526797_1345703475525901 | Today I vote for the candidate who already has elected experience, showed me tax returns, paid taxes, won the debates, respects women, doesn't brag about sexual exploitation of others, respects the disabled, respects veterans and prisoners of war, doesn't target people based on race or religion, proposed an economic plan that adds less debt and more jobs than her opponent according to economists, shows no bigotry towards others, demonstrates preparedness and maturity,  doesn't promise to punish her opponents, and has a generally optimistic view of the future.

1 | David Aldo | 19 | 1562004357152922_1562021087151249 | Why are Trumpian Republicans so obsessed with trolling obviously Democratic, Liberal, Progressive and Rational Republican Facebook pages and trying so hard to convince the majority of Americans that we are all wrong for supporting our first woman POTUS? As if we are all going to change our mind, this late in the game. Right......
2 | David Aldo | 5 | 1562004357152922_1562021333817891 | ...and then there's this.Trump has revealed himself...yet again!Last night he stated at one of his last rallies, "It will be the greatest waste of time, money and energy, if I lose". This shows that...this was all just about HIM and his need to message his ego! I don't believe their has ever been a presidential candidate who said this in the history of our Presidential elections.Then he went on to lie one last time on the Campaign trail and claimed that he spoke to "Tom Brady" and said, ‚ÄúHe called today and he said, Donald, I support you, you‚Äôre my friend and I voted for you.‚Äù He also added,  that Brady gave him his blessing to spill the beans on the endorsement...This is your guy...own it Trumpian Republicans! Be proud and embrace everything he stands for. Even though it is not what the majority of Americans who are Democrats, Liberals, Progressives and Rational Republicans believe in.

11 | Dakota Purtell | 5 | 1562004357152922_1562015910485100 | I VOTED TRUMP!‚ö†10 reasons NOT to vote Hillary Clinton‚ö†1) Hillary Clinton is 69 years old; she had a serious head injury after passing out in 2012 and she‚Äôs had a much remarked upon uncontrollable cough throughout much of this year‚Äôs campaign with other complications.2) What message would it send to young women if someone as corrupt, dishonest and incompetent as Hillary Clinton were elected President?3) ‚ÄúHillary demanded White House workers never speak to her and hide behind the drapes when she appeared.‚Äù You think someone like that cares about you? At all?4) why would you let a rapest back in the white house? (Bill Clinton)5) When she was practicing law, Hillary Clinton defended a man who raped a 12 year old girl. She tore the little girl apart on the stand, got the rapist off with a light sentence and later laughed about it with a reporter.6) She claimed multiple times that she had to run for her life because her plane landed under SNIPER FIRE in Bosnia. Actually, when she landed there was a greeting ceremony and an 8 year old girl read her a poem.7) She wants to ban guns and disarm the United States. 8) Hillary Clinton helped create the Iranian nuclear deal that is allowing a terrorist-supporting, anti-American nation to get nuclear weapons.9) She is planning to expand on Obama‚Äôs unconstitutional waving of immigration law for young illegal immigrants.10) Her judgment on foreign policy is terrible. Not only did she get people killed in Benghazi, she supported our intervention in Syria.VOTE SMART!                       PLEASE LIKE & SHARE IF YOU SUPPORT!

14 | Tariq Marwan Al Mutawa | 0 | 1562004357152922_1562025877150770 | The endless Clinton family crime is going on and on and will go on for another 4 years. This criminal Clinton system is now legalised by and from an entire US rigged government system and all those Clinton crimes over a century are fully backed by Barack Obama! This is the most dirtiest campaign ever in the US history which the criminal Clinton clan is organising and arranging against the system and especially against Donald J. Trump and against the entire normal US citizen and the normal US society. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama this stands for corruption, fraud, supporting Wall Street in all criminal behaviours of national and international transactions, ISIS terrorist financing, TIPP, open borders, migrants, islamisation, NWO on behalf of the 5 most powerful families that control America and the world Rothschild, Rockefeller, Du Pont, Morgan and Bush and similar influential families and Hillary Clinton will initiate the WWIII.I hope even the stupidest, the normal and the clever Americans have recognised already how criminal is the Clinton family and there entire elite supporters are as well. Now it is proven Hillary Clinton is above any valid US law.Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton should be in jail for live-time for all her political and all her international war crimes and should not sit in the oval office in the white house to initiate more and more national and international crimes and to initiate a WW III.Be sure if Hillary Clinton will be President of the United States of America one morning the Americans will wake up and will listen to the news the ‚ÄúThird World War‚Äù has started already and this will happen in the very very near future.Sorry to say this, but it seems that many of those typical American do not understand what is going on or they are totally stupid and totally unrealistic ‚ÄúPerson‚Äù who know absolutely nothing what is going on the globe initiated by the US and how dirty are those US games of the US elite and the US establishment is, at home in the US and abroad to act criminal and to destroy countries where ever they like to do it. This has to be stopped for ever this criminal behaviour of the US politicians worldwide.Bring all those US high criminals the former US presidents and the US politicians include Barak Obama to justice right now in Dan Haag, before it is too late and I believe and I feel the WW III initiated by the US government started already.Citizens of Brussels have a Message for Americans heading to the Polls!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmvcx5jD5qA

Each Presidential Candidate has what is called a "Running Mate." This "Running Mate" is just as important as the President as they will serve, monitor, manage and decide upon every law and pending issue this country is facing along with the President. They are classified as Vice Presidents. More importantly, there have been many times where a Vice President has been sworn in as President for a number of sound reasons. When voting, please remember that you are voting for two presidential nominees per party. Due Diligence is required here. Know your Vice Presidential candidates, what they stand for, their accomplishments and character. They may just become your President some day and you each need to be in support of them to represent you and this country. Thank you.

That's all they know what to do. They have been in politics all their lives. They don't know what you need for your family and your family's future and the future of America.They don't know what you need to be happy and the happiness of your family. They love to be in power.

Giving Americans only two choices when in fact there are four. Which is nothing more than an either-or fallacy. Most Americans are to stupid to realize this too. Politicians and the media have dumbed down America to the point that most Americans don't even understand civics at a grade school level.

You can evaluate, re-evaluate, research, and decide - reason based on fact!The problem with Hillary is that she's like the Higgs Boson. We theorize it's there, and we think we know, but in the end, it's a made up thing that helps us explain our reasoning, which can very well be flawed, if not even more flawed than the real thing, Trump!In the end, it's what one desires. We have a tendency to prefer our servings sugar coated, which explains how all of the crooks got in D.C., and Trump's servings are quite raw. But now we know, raw is better and healthier than the sweets we naturally desire.

19 | Dennis G. McAuliffe | 0 | 1345691452193770_1345704065525842 | so tell us what is good about Donald Trump‚Äôs presidency which will ‚Äúsignificantly‚Äù weaken the country, his tax cuts would add 9.5 Trillion to the debt,  driving the U.S. into a ‚Äúlengthy recession‚Äù with nearly 3.5 million job losses and a 7 percent unemployment rate, according to a Moody‚Äôs Analytics analysis.The tax code under Mr. Trump‚Äôs plan will be much less progressive than the current tax code. More than one-third of the proposed tax cuts on personal income will go to the top 1% of income earners, with the average taxpayer in this group receiving a reduction in their tax bill of $275,000. Taxpayers in the bottom 99% of income earners will receive a tax cut of less than $2,500.Under Trump's plan, the conservative Tax Foundation expects that the bottom 80 percent of Americans will see just 0.8 percent to 1.8 percent more income after his tax cuts. Clinton's plan will only increase taxes for America's wealthiest earners.The large increase in tariffs on Chinese and Mexican imports supported by Mr. Trump further exacerbates inflation pressures. The U.S. imports nearly $500 billion in goods a year from China, and another almost $300 billion from Mexico, accounting for approximately 35% of total U.S. non-petroleum goods imports. Outside of Canada, no other country comes close as a source of imports. Slapping a 45% tariff on Chinese imports and 35% on non-petroleum Mexican imports thus increases overall goods import prices by approximately 15%.would most likely retaliate with in-kind tariffs on U.S. imports. This would be a big hit to U.S. exports, as we ship well over $100 billion in products a year to China, and almost $250 billion to Mexico.And the problem with trumps outspoken approach to Mexican immigration, his ‚Äúplan‚Äù to deport 11 million undocumented immigrants would shrink the economy by about 2 percent, according to American Action Forum (AAF), a conservative and pro-business think tank. The sudden subtraction of 7 million workers would cause an immediate shock to thousands of businesses, triggering a GDP collapse ranging from $400 billion to $600 billion in productionNot to overlook Donald Trump who casts himself as a protector of workers and jobs, but a USA TODAY NETWORK investigation found hundreds of people ‚Äì carpenters, dishwashers, painters, even his own lawyers ‚Äì who say he didn‚Äôt pay them for their work. And uses undocumented labor along with Chinese Steel over American for his hotels and resorts !

16 | Bruce Lewis | 1 | 1345672622195653_1345674345528814 | Donald Trump Jr.25 mins ¬∑ The past 18 months have the most humbling, incredible experience imaginable. I have met tens of thousands of hard working Americans that believe they are losing their country. They feel betrayed by politicians, the media, and cultural elite.This has become more than a campaign, this is a MOVEMENT! A movement of, by, and for the American people. It is so remarkably rare that we have a chance to reclaim our government. This is not an election of Republican vs Democrat, this is about an insider vs an outsider! This is about someone who is bought by the system vs someone who wants to change the way business works in Washington DC.My father has been a lifelong disruptor, someone who has done what he said he will do, and never let the negative forces get in his way. Since the day he announced, I have seen my father endure countless unfair attacks from career politicians and media elite who would like nothing more than to see their power and influence protected. I grew up admiring my father for his courage, conviction, and ability to overcome insurmountable obstacles. What I witnessed and experienced these last 18 months has been nothing short of remarkable and incredible. My father decided to jump into the most hostile environment imaginable. He took the arrows, endured the attacks, and persevered through the tough times, all for YOU the American people.I can tell you my father does not want this job for the fame, the recognition, or any of the perks the office might entail. What keeps him up at night is witnessing the depletion of our country. That is why he ran for President. He is driven by an endless love for the country and a belief that America can be restored to greatness. I never thought I would have the chance to see my father on a presidential ballot. As I cast my vote today I can tell you that NO ONE will work harder, do more, or commit themselves to the country as much as my father. This is a day where the American people can take back our government. Where we say ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!I cannot thank all of my followers and supporters enough for your endless words of encouragement. During the long days on the trail, it has lifted me up and kept me going.Today marks a turning point in America. Today is a day where we can look our kids in the eye and say we did everything we did to save the greatest country in the history of the world.VOTE TRUMP and together we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
17 | Mark Porrey | 0 | 1345672622195653_1345687998860782 | The flood of immigrants at our borders today is neither an accident nor a surprise. It is an extension of the Cloward-Piven Strategy ‚Äì the goal of which has been known for 50 years.In a 1966 article in Nation, Richard Andrew Cloward and Frances Fox Piven, sociology professors at Columbia University, wrote that capitalism should be collapsed by overloading the government with financial demands that could not be met.The strategy is to collapse the financial system. The tactic is chaos. If a crisis does not exist, create one. The more chaos the better. The solution is always couched in empathetic words like ‚Äúfair,‚Äù ‚Äúequal,‚Äù ‚Äúhumane‚Äù and ‚Äújust.‚ÄùÔøºWomen and children look through a box of cloths that were donated by volunteers at the Greyhound bus terminal, Thursday, May 29, 2014 in Phoenix. About 400 mostly Central American women and children caught crossing from Mexico into south Texas were flown to Arizona this weekend after border agents there ran out of space and resources. Officials then dropped hundreds of them off at Phoenix and Tucson Greyhound stations, overwhelming the stations and humanitarian groups who were trying to help. (AP Photo/Rick Scuteri) In 1967 Cloward and Piven founded the National Welfare Rights Organization to increase the numbers of people on the welfare rolls. Through a series of sit-ins, demonstrations, picket lines and occasional rock throwing, smashed glass and broken furniture they succeeded beyond their wildest dreams. By the 1970‚Äôs there was one person on welfare in New York City for every two working in the private sector. The city declared bankruptcy in 1975.Project Vote was formed to organize the voter‚Äôs rights movement to take up the ‚Äúunfinished business‚Äù of the 1965 Voters Rights Act. ACORN and Human SERVE were formed to expand on the work of the National Welfare Rights Organization.Those three organizations began lobbying for the Motor-Voter law to swamp our voter rolls with names that would never vote, but whose names would be on the rolls so others could vote in their stead. When President Bill Clinton signed the bill in 1993 Cloward and Piven were standing behind him.ACORN is the most prominent of the organizations formed by Cloward and Piven. President Barack Obama was ACORN‚Äôs lawyer. They have received millions of dollars from the federal government and charitable organizations for working on the census, voter registration, affordable housing and other organizing efforts.ACORN‚Äôs biggest success was in lobbying for the expansion of housing on behalf of the poor. The financial collapse of 2008 can be traced to government decisions. The Community Reinvestment Act of 1979 required banks to make loans in poor neighborhoods. Under pressure from the Clinton White House in 1999, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac lowered their credit standards on mortgages. Proposals by the Bush Administration to put Fannie and Freddie under closer supervision were opposed by Democrats in Congress.ÔøºA U.S. Border Patrol canine team stands nearby after they helped detain a group of undocumented immigrants near the U.S.-Mexico border on April 11, 2013 near Mission, Texas. Agents say they have also seen an additional surge in immigrant traffic since immigration reform negotiations began this year in Washington D.C. Proposed reforms could provide a path to citizenship for many of the estimated 11 million undocumented workers living in the United States. Credit: Getty Images In response to the chaos created by the financial meltdown, $2 trillion was spent saving Wall Street from their own bad decisions, covering the salaries of public union employees and expanding welfare and unemployment benefits. The shovel ready jobs that were promised are still undone so the Left demands more spending.After dozens of ACORN employees were indicted on charges of voter fraud, their funding dried up and they were disbanded.Today, in keeping with the Cloward-Piven Strategy, a new crisis is being manufactured by President Obama. There is chaos at the Southern border.Two years ago the president stopped deportation efforts of young immigrants who came to the country illegally. We have had active programs in Mexico informing those who come to our country how to apply for food stamps. The welcoming word is out regarding illegal entry also.The New York Times reported last week that an illegal immigrant youth said: ‚ÄúIf you make it, they take you to a shelter and take care of you.‚ÄùA mother with her child told Channel 5 News that the message being disseminated in their country is, ‚Äúgo to America with your child, you won‚Äôt be turned away.‚ÄùÔøºCentral American immigrants ride north on top of a freight train on August 6, 2013 near Juchitan, Mexico. Thousands of Central American migrants ride the trains, known as ‚Äòla bestia‚Äô, or the beast, during their long and perilous journey through Mexico to reach the U.S. border. Some of the immigrants are robbed and assaulted by gangs who control the train tops, while others fall asleep and tumble down, losing limbs or perishing under the wheels of the trains.

If they were clearly marked, you could vote for them if you like the way things have been going, and you could easily vote for someone else if you don't.

24 | Mark Porrey | 0 | 10154721512998762_10154721804748762 | The flood of immigrants at our borders today is neither an accident nor a surprise. It is an extension of the Cloward-Piven Strategy ‚Äì the goal of which has been known for 50 years.In a 1966 article in Nation, Richard Andrew Cloward and Frances Fox Piven, sociology professors at Columbia University, wrote that capitalism should be collapsed by overloading the government with financial demands that could not be met.The strategy is to collapse the financial system. The tactic is chaos. If a crisis does not exist, create one. The more chaos the better. The solution is always couched in empathetic words like ‚Äúfair,‚Äù ‚Äúequal,‚Äù ‚Äúhumane‚Äù and ‚Äújust.‚ÄùÔøºWomen and children look through a box of cloths that were donated by volunteers at the Greyhound bus terminal, Thursday, May 29, 2014 in Phoenix. About 400 mostly Central American women and children caught crossing from Mexico into south Texas were flown to Arizona this weekend after border agents there ran out of space and resources. Officials then dropped hundreds of them off at Phoenix and Tucson Greyhound stations, overwhelming the stations and humanitarian groups who were trying to help. (AP Photo/Rick Scuteri) In 1967 Cloward and Piven founded the National Welfare Rights Organization to increase the numbers of people on the welfare rolls. Through a series of sit-ins, demonstrations, picket lines and occasional rock throwing, smashed glass and broken furniture they succeeded beyond their wildest dreams. By the 1970‚Äôs there was one person on welfare in New York City for every two working in the private sector. The city declared bankruptcy in 1975.Project Vote was formed to organize the voter‚Äôs rights movement to take up the ‚Äúunfinished business‚Äù of the 1965 Voters Rights Act. ACORN and Human SERVE were formed to expand on the work of the National Welfare Rights Organization.Those three organizations began lobbying for the Motor-Voter law to swamp our voter rolls with names that would never vote, but whose names would be on the rolls so others could vote in their stead. When President Bill Clinton signed the bill in 1993 Cloward and Piven were standing behind him.ACORN is the most prominent of the organizations formed by Cloward and Piven. President Barack Obama was ACORN‚Äôs lawyer. They have received millions of dollars from the federal government and charitable organizations for working on the census, voter registration, affordable housing and other organizing efforts.ACORN‚Äôs biggest success was in lobbying for the expansion of housing on behalf of the poor. The financial collapse of 2008 can be traced to government decisions. The Community Reinvestment Act of 1979 required banks to make loans in poor neighborhoods. Under pressure from the Clinton White House in 1999, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac lowered their credit standards on mortgages. Proposals by the Bush Administration to put Fannie and Freddie under closer supervision were opposed by Democrats in Congress.ÔøºA U.S. Border Patrol canine team stands nearby after they helped detain a group of undocumented immigrants near the U.S.-Mexico border on April 11, 2013 near Mission, Texas. Agents say they have also seen an additional surge in immigrant traffic since immigration reform negotiations began this year in Washington D.C. Proposed reforms could provide a path to citizenship for many of the estimated 11 million undocumented workers living in the United States. Credit: Getty Images In response to the chaos created by the financial meltdown, $2 trillion was spent saving Wall Street from their own bad decisions, covering the salaries of public union employees and expanding welfare and unemployment benefits. The shovel ready jobs that were promised are still undone so the Left demands more spending.After dozens of ACORN employees were indicted on charges of voter fraud, their funding dried up and they were disbanded.Today, in keeping with the Cloward-Piven Strategy, a new crisis is being manufactured by President Obama. There is chaos at the Southern border.Two years ago the president stopped deportation efforts of young immigrants who came to the country illegally. We have had active programs in Mexico informing those who come to our country how to apply for food stamps. The welcoming word is out regarding illegal entry also.The New York Times reported last week that an illegal immigrant youth said: ‚ÄúIf you make it, they take you to a shelter and take care of you.‚ÄùA mother with her child told Channel 5 News that the message being disseminated in their country is, ‚Äúgo to America with your child, you won‚Äôt be turned away.‚ÄùÔøºCentral American immigrants ride north on top of a freight train on August 6, 2013 near Juchitan, Mexico. Thousands of Central American migrants ride the trains, known as ‚Äòla bestia‚Äô, or the beast, during their long and perilous journey through Mexico to reach the U.S. border. Some of the immigrants are robbed and assaulted by gangs who control the train tops, while others fall asleep and tumble down, losing limbs or perishing under the wheels of the trains. Only a fraction of the immigrants who start the journey in Central America will traverse Mexico completely unscathed ‚Äì and all this before illegally entering the United States and facing the considerable U.S. border security apparatus designed to track, detain and deport them.

3 | Bob Mulherin | 0 | 1345647932198122_1345668705529378 | Copied from a friends post: If I was asked to justify and explain why I voted for Donald Trump and I answered honestly I would have to say that if Donald Trump had ever put our nations security at risk, I would not vote for him. If his organization received large donations from countries that killed women and gays, I would not vote for him. If he boasted 30 Years of government experience, but still could not discern if an email was classified or not, without someone letting him know if it was or not, I would not vote for him. If he boasted about how he has defended children his entire life, but is for abortion, (even late term, when the child can feel pain) I would not vote for him. If he caused lives to be destroyed in Benghazi and then lied to the faces of the parents as they stood at their child's casket, I would not vote for him. If people who came against him mysteriously turned up dead, I would not vote for him. If he suddenly developed a southern accent when he was in the South, campaigning, I would not vote for him. If he continually broke the law and that was ignored, I would not vote for him, but right now, the ONLY person who does ALL these things is Hillary. I'm bigger than those remarks made by Trump and we all have said stupid things throughout our lives. To me, the fact that Hillary lies continuously, is a much bigger problem. We can see the effects of her lies by the state of our poor country right now...

2 | Kevin Ivey | 6 | 1345617228867859_1345624632200452 | Points to consider if you're undecided:Corruption or real change? Wall Street, Banks, Globalist $$$ or standing against big $$$ lobbyists? Horrible trade deals and tax system that has caused our workers to suffer, wages stagnant for 25yrs or fair trade-taking care of Americans FIRST?Bringing jobs and co's BACK or encouraging them to leave the US? Term limits or lifetime career politicians? Open door for illegal immigration, drugs, human trafficking-women, girls, or enforcing the law and demanding that our 'friends to the south do the same? Abortion for any reason-sex selection, eye color, etc, up to the moment of birth or common sense guidelines and rules? War mongering or trying to work w other nations and demanding that countries pay their fair share and take care of biz?Upholding and respecting the law or thumbing her nose at the rule of law-one set of rules for her, her friends, people w power and another for you?
3 | Emma Ginder | 0 | 1345617228867859_1345671085529140 | Imagine it is November 9, 2016 in America and we wake up knowing who our new President will be. If it is Hillary, think of the groups of people that will celebrate. Illegal Immigrants, criminals and future criminals who will be supported for pulling a gun on a police officer, planned parenthood, the media, and the list goes on and on that represent everything that is wrong with America. If you're still "with her," look around at who you'll be celebrating with. Now imagine waking up knowing that Trump is our new President. You may or may not like him, or really know what kind of president he will be. But here are some things you will know for sure:‚Ä¢ The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.‚Ä¢ The media has been neutered forever.‚Ä¢ Career politicians will have lost all job security.‚Ä¢ The guns in your home will safely stay there.‚Ä¢ Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.‚Ä¢ Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally‚Ä¢ Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.‚Ä¢ No more apologies to the world for being great!‚Ä¢ Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.‚Ä¢ Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.‚Ä¢ There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.‚Ä¢ The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.‚Ä¢ The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.Copy and paste this as your status if you support and will vote Donald Trump for president 2016. #trump2016.üá∫üá∏‚ù§Ô∏è‚úùÔ∏èüá∫üá∏‚ù§Ô∏è‚úùÔ∏èüá∫üá∏‚ù§Ô∏è‚úùÔ∏è

5 | Mark Porrey | 0 | 1345617228867859_1345689115527337 | The flood of immigrants at our borders today is neither an accident nor a surprise. It is an extension of the Cloward-Piven Strategy ‚Äì the goal of which has been known for 50 years.In a 1966 article in Nation, Richard Andrew Cloward and Frances Fox Piven, sociology professors at Columbia University, wrote that capitalism should be collapsed by overloading the government with financial demands that could not be met.The strategy is to collapse the financial system. The tactic is chaos. If a crisis does not exist, create one. The more chaos the better. The solution is always couched in empathetic words like ‚Äúfair,‚Äù ‚Äúequal,‚Äù ‚Äúhumane‚Äù and ‚Äújust.‚ÄùÔøºWomen and children look through a box of cloths that were donated by volunteers at the Greyhound bus terminal, Thursday, May 29, 2014 in Phoenix. About 400 mostly Central American women and children caught crossing from Mexico into south Texas were flown to Arizona this weekend after border agents there ran out of space and resources. Officials then dropped hundreds of them off at Phoenix and Tucson Greyhound stations, overwhelming the stations and humanitarian groups who were trying to help. (AP Photo/Rick Scuteri) In 1967 Cloward and Piven founded the National Welfare Rights Organization to increase the numbers of people on the welfare rolls. Through a series of sit-ins, demonstrations, picket lines and occasional rock throwing, smashed glass and broken furniture they succeeded beyond their wildest dreams. By the 1970‚Äôs there was one person on welfare in New York City for every two working in the private sector. The city declared bankruptcy in 1975.Project Vote was formed to organize the voter‚Äôs rights movement to take up the ‚Äúunfinished business‚Äù of the 1965 Voters Rights Act. ACORN and Human SERVE were formed to expand on the work of the National Welfare Rights Organization.Those three organizations began lobbying for the Motor-Voter law to swamp our voter rolls with names that would never vote, but whose names would be on the rolls so others could vote in their stead. When President Bill Clinton signed the bill in 1993 Cloward and Piven were standing behind him.ACORN is the most prominent of the organizations formed by Cloward and Piven. President Barack Obama was ACORN‚Äôs lawyer. They have received millions of dollars from the federal government and charitable organizations for working on the census, voter registration, affordable housing and other organizing efforts.ACORN‚Äôs biggest success was in lobbying for the expansion of housing on behalf of the poor. The financial collapse of 2008 can be traced to government decisions. The Community Reinvestment Act of 1979 required banks to make loans in poor neighborhoods. Under pressure from the Clinton White House in 1999, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac lowered their credit standards on mortgages. Proposals by the Bush Administration to put Fannie and Freddie under closer supervision were opposed by Democrats in Congress.ÔøºA U.S. Border Patrol canine team stands nearby after they helped detain a group of undocumented immigrants near the U.S.-Mexico border on April 11, 2013 near Mission, Texas. Agents say they have also seen an additional surge in immigrant traffic since immigration reform negotiations began this year in Washington D.C. Proposed reforms could provide a path to citizenship for many of the estimated 11 million undocumented workers living in the United States. Credit: Getty Images In response to the chaos created by the financial meltdown, $2 trillion was spent saving Wall Street from their own bad decisions, covering the salaries of public union employees and expanding welfare and unemployment benefits. The shovel ready jobs that were promised are still undone so the Left demands more spending.After dozens of ACORN employees were indicted on charges of voter fraud, their funding dried up and they were disbanded.Today, in keeping with the Cloward-Piven Strategy, a new crisis is being manufactured by President Obama. There is chaos at the Southern border.Two years ago the president stopped deportation efforts of young immigrants who came to the country illegally. We have had active programs in Mexico informing those who come to our country how to apply for food stamps. The welcoming word is out regarding illegal entry also.The New York Times reported last week that an illegal immigrant youth said: ‚ÄúIf you make it, they take you to a shelter and take care of you.‚ÄùA mother with her child told Channel 5 News that the message being disseminated in their country is, ‚Äúgo to America with your child, you won‚Äôt be turned away.‚ÄùÔøºCentral American immigrants ride north on top of a freight train on August 6, 2013 near Juchitan, Mexico. Thousands of Central American migrants ride the trains, known as ‚Äòla bestia‚Äô, or the beast, during their long and perilous journey through Mexico to reach the U.S. border. Some of the immigrants are robbed and assaulted by gangs who control the train tops, while others fall asleep and tumble down, losing limbs or perishing under the wheels of the trains. Only a fraction of the immigrants who start the journey in Central America will traverse Mexico completely unscathed ‚Äì and all this before illegally entering the United States and facing the considerable U.S. border security apparatus designed to track, detain and deport them. Credit: Getty Images Children are crossing the border in astonishing numbers and an additional 230,000 children are expected over the next 24 months. Border officials fear that this is just the tip of the iceberg.The federal government is shipping illegal families to Phoenix from Texas by the planeload and illegals from Central America are being bussed from the Mexican border to Phoenix and released on the street corners. They will all overload our health care system, our welfare rolls and our schools.Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) said that the administration is committed to escalating lawlessness at the border.President Obama has called it ‚Äúan urgent humanitarian situation.‚Äù Attorney General Holder said that amnesty is a civil right and has initiated a program to hire an additional 100 attorneys to represent these children in the immigration process.Richard Cloward has died. His partner and wife, Francis Fox Piven, serves as the honorary chairmanof the Democratic Socialists of America. The Cloward-Piven Strategy is alive and well in the care of President Obama who is superintending the chaos on the border.He took office promising to transform America. This will do it.John Linder served in Congress for 18 years from Georgia. He and his wife, Lynne, have retired to a farm in Northeast Mississippi. He can be contacted at: linderje@yahoo.

Christian faith says God knew us before we were born and thou shall not kill, Muslim faith states a fetus is a living soul at 4 months and Jewish faith states abortion is forbidden with exception given according to Jewish scholar Rashi In regard to life-risking pregnancies, How is it so many woman are voting for a person that will uphold the practice of late term abortion?

9 | Karm Espinosa | 0 | 1345617228867859_1345656945530554 | TRUMP will win with your VOTE !Following is from a Facebook friend of mine, Sharon Mannor, why she supports TRUMP:What Trump is not:He's not a politician. He's not responsible for any existing laws or policies. He's not responsible for any wars.  He hasn't killed anyone or left anyone to die in Benghazi. He's not under FBI investigationHe's not politically correct. He did not sell uranium to Russia. He doesn't drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes or cigars, or do drugs. What he is:A successful businessman who has used his executive knowledge to build a multi billion dollar empire. He's a builder and knows how to get things done on time and under budget. He's charitable and often does things behind the scenes. He financially helped the marine who sat in a Mexican jail for 200 days after he was released. He raised 4 wonderful children who have never been in trouble and are very successful. He's not running for the office of president because he wants power and money.  He already has that. He's running,  using his own money (over 100 million dollars) so he is not indebted to anyone but we the people. He has watched what has happened to the country and doesn‚Äôt like the path it's on. He believes he can fix it. He won't even take a salary to do it.I believe in him and think we should give him a chance to try."Hillary has attached herself to Obama, a fraud, phony & imposter.Read ObamaScare, my book that has Documents & Facts, available on Amazon.Thank you.Respectfully,Philip J Berg, Democrat Author, ObamaScare

13 | Bob Mulherin | 0 | 1345617228867859_1345668955529353 | Copied from a friends post: If I was asked to justify and explain why I voted for Donald Trump and I answered honestly I would have to say that if Donald Trump had ever put our nations security at risk, I would not vote for him. If his organization received large donations from countries that killed women and gays, I would not vote for him. If he boasted 30 Years of government experience, but still could not discern if an email was classified or not, without someone letting him know if it was or not, I would not vote for him. If he boasted about how he has defended children his entire life, but is for abortion, (even late term, when the child can feel pain) I would not vote for him. If he caused lives to be destroyed in Benghazi and then lied to the faces of the parents as they stood at their child's casket, I would not vote for him. If people who came against him mysteriously turned up dead, I would not vote for him. If he suddenly developed a southern accent when he was in the South, campaigning, I would not vote for him. If he continually broke the law and that was ignored, I would not vote for him, but right now, the ONLY person who does ALL these things is Hillary. I'm bigger than those remarks made by Trump and we all have said stupid things throughout our lives. To me, the fact that Hillary lies continuously, is a much bigger problem. We can see the effects of her lies by the state of our poor country right now...

15 | Clarence Eddy | 1 | 1345617228867859_1345617935534455 | People are SICK of the liberal media's brainwashing efforts.

I‚Äôm not racist or bigoted, it‚Äôs just too risky at this time. America is struggling enough. Our jobs are being taken away. Our healthcare is too expensive. Mine is $600/month now (AND RISING!). My car insurance is still $29/month (from Insurance Panda), but who knows when our increasingly socialist government will come in and muddle that up? Things are getting more and more expensive as it is. Can we really afford to support the world‚Äôs homeless? Liberals are just too stupid and gullible to understand the difference between a LEGAL immigrant, and an ILLEGAL Criminal Invader. They're like naive donkeys, who believe every lie that comes from Hillary's corrupt circle, basically because she says what they want to hear, although she'll do the exact opposite when she takes office. If you can't see how willingly she lies to your face now, then don't act all stunned when she turns around and pounds you from behind once in office.

As #ElectionDay begins, some are asking what would happen if Donald J. Trump loses and declines to concede.

The answer? Nothing.

1 | Laura Hoey | 273 | 1345597862203129_1345598808869701 | We all get to roll our eyes and snort at him, one last time. Then move on and ignore is antics going forward, while Madam President works to make a better Union for all.
2 | Clifford Phillips Jr | 176 | 1345597862203129_1345598465536402 | Just a reminder about Donald J. Trump. This is a man who‚Äôs: -Mocked a man with disabilities. -Attacked the parents of a fallen American hero. -Belittled POWs and the war record of Sen. John McCain. -Lied about how much money he raised for veterans. -Called a former Miss Universe ‚Äúdisgusting‚Äù and fat, telling his Twitter followers to find her non-existent sex tape. -Accused an American-born federal judge of being unfit to do his job because of his Mexican heritage. -Likely avoided paying taxes for nearly two decades. -Called most Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals, even though that‚Äôs not remotely factual. -Lied about seeing ‚Äúthousands and thousands‚Äù of Muslims celebrating in New Jersey on 9/11. -Lied about getting a letter from the NFL complaining about the debate schedule. -Tried to exploit the death of an African American woman in Chicago to say that‚Äôs why black voters will support him.-Found the ‚Äúbright side‚Äù to tragedies because his poll numbers tend to go up.-Settled with the Department of Justice after his company was found guilty of racially discriminating against minorities. -Has cheated on at least one wife. -Was just discovered on video admitting that he not only tried to cheat on his current wife, but he attempted to do so with another married woman. -Had his first wife publicly say that he did nothing when it came to raising their children until they were old enough to talk business. -Tweeted that women should have expected to be sexually assaulted when they mixed males and females together in the military. -Said he wants to target the families of terrorists. -Stated that he wants to ban an entire religion. -Praised a Russian president who obviously hates the U.S. and Americans. -Encouraged the Russian government to commit espionage against Americans. -Insinuated that another Republican‚Äôs wife was ugly. -Tried to implicate another Republican‚Äôs father in JFK‚Äôs assassination. -Sought out the help of former Fox News CEO Roger Ailes after he was fired following multiple allegations that he had sexually harassed women for years. -Made Breitbart‚Äôs Steve Bannon one of his top campaign people. -Had a former campaign manager abruptly resign after a report came out linking him to pro-Russian groups that were directly trying to undermine U.S. policy in eastern Europe. -Called Carly Fiornia ugly. -Has said climate change was a hoax created by the Chinese ‚Äî then denied saying it. -Was a leading conspiracy theorist when it came to the racist-driven birther conspiracies against President Barack Obama. -Dismissed nearly eight years of accusing the president of not being an American with a less than 30 second statement where he didn‚Äôt apologize for any of it. -Tried to blame Hillary Clinton for his racism. Re-tweeted anti-African American propaganda created by a white supremacy group. -Played dumb about knowing who former Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan David Duke was. -Skipped a presidential debate because he was scared of a moderator. -Has, on several occasions, suggested he finds his daughter attractive. -Called a husband doing things like changing diapers and helping with the children, a man ‚Äútrying to be the wife.‚Äù -Has said he wants more countries to have nuclear weapons. -Said he can‚Äôt release his tax returns because they‚Äôre currently being audited ‚Äî even though the IRS said that‚Äôs a lie. -Feels he has the right to sexually assault women.These are the classic signs of a sociopath. -Doesn‚Äôt believe the rules or laws apply to him. -Seems to have no concern about the consequences of his actions.-Is impulsive. -Shows frequent signs of being reckless. -Is unpredictable. -Lacks morals. -Is a narcissist. -Has proven to be hot-tempered and a bit of a loose cannon. -Lacks empathy or sympathy for others. -Is manipulative to get what he wants. -Almost never apologizes.-Often invents outrageous lies about his success or experiences. -Seems to believe that what he says is the truth, even if it isn‚Äôt.This describes Trump to a tee. Explain to me why he's the president we need.
3 | Jan Matras | 75 | 1345597862203129_1345599652202950 | Good article!  So even if Cheeto man throws a temper tantrum and tries to hold his breath after shouting the "rigged" mantra, it won't matter!  #ImWithHer
4 | Jason Kelley | 51 | 1345597862203129_1345599225536326 | WHY ARE YOU READING THIS????get out and vote - not a time for regret - get out and make sure thios fool trump does-not-win - make him lose in a landslide - even if your state is obviously blue do-it-anyway-WHY ARE YOU STILL READING THIS!!!go vote - shut trump down -
5 | Bill Bartlett | 19 | 1345597862203129_1345604232202492 | Regardless of who wins, you can thank Donald Trump for accurately exposing that the system is rigged and has been for many years. Democracy in America is a farce. CNN, NBC and most MAINSTREAM MEDIA are a THREAT to democracy as well as many other media outlets including most newspapers. Between Trump and WIKI the truth finally came out. Brave New World finally exposed.
6 | Arumuham Raju | 23 | 1345597862203129_1345610295535219 | Nothing happens. If she wins and all the states certify her as the winner, then she is the President Elect? But now, today is the election day. Polling stations are already open. Wake up America. We all know that Trump is an evil and we have to save America from the evil forces of Trump. So America, go and vote for HRC and all other Democrats contesting. Don't delay. Stronger Together, we will win.
7 | Chris Tanner | 26 | 1345597862203129_1345601795536069 | He's going to lose by such big numbers that he will look even stupider if he doesn't concede.  Doesn't matter does it?  Once the election is certified, it's over for him.
8 | Curtis Benelli | 16 | 1345597862203129_1345611048868477 | With any luck he will cry, whine, throw tantrums, then disappear into obscurity....unfortunately, he'll open his new TV propaganda channel where his lemmings will continue to be misinformed....
9 | Betsy Kardos | 13 | 1345597862203129_1345612962201619 | No, something does happen. America loses a part of its tradition of grace and civility. We lose an attempt to create unity and move forward together as a country. I suspect we've lost it already; with Trump's behavior as a candidate, a significant number of citizens already feel validated in behaving badly in politics and everyday life.
10 | Denise Kolby Federoff | 8 | 1345597862203129_1345612922201623 | When Trump loses, expect him to by lying the in the fetal position in his lavish, gold bedroom in Trump Tower, foaming at the mouth and Twittering that the system was rigged against him!
11 | Carolyn Kari Bell | 4 | 1345597862203129_1345629195533329 | Nothing...we will all survive his outsized ego...he's either in our democracy or not...if he chooses not...then he will pay a yuge price....for a megalomaniac to be ignored is a fate worse than death.
12 | Via Di Veneto | 6 | 1345597862203129_1345625682200347 | If he doesn't, then he proves, again, that he is totally unAmerican and was only out for himself - Republicans, sadly, stood by such an unqualified candidate.
13 | Anna Cordova | 7 | 1345597862203129_1345606808868901 | Everthing is rigged,  everybody is cheating, losers, America is disaster, we are going to hell, Trump is a nightmare, we will see how much he loves America, what will his behavior be if he loses!!!! Or all this has been only about him. I would guess all about him.
14 | Ryan Brooks | 5 | 1345597862203129_1345627835533465 | He will simply sue everyone. The media. The republicans. The democrats. Everyone will get a lawsuit.... And he will Twitter about how everyone rigged the election....hes like an 11 year old girl
15 | Michele Mccoy-Willis | 4 | 1345597862203129_1345630338866548 | If Trump doesn't concede with the lost, the Republican Party can concede for him. His EGO and pride  is bruised really bad about now. BLUE PRIDE will DRAIN THE SWAMP into oblivion with him and his supporters today....
16 | Charles Reese | 4 | 1345597862203129_1345618238867758 | Nothing more than he further confirms that he is a narcissistic a**hole that deserved to be soundly defeated.  Hopefully his entire Empire has been exposed for what it really is and is taken down.  Imagine Donald giving up his limo for the subway and having to hitchhike to Las Vegas when his 757 is repossessed for tax evasion.
17 | Gail Smith Valente | 2 | 1345597862203129_1345626522200263 | Here's what I hope happens when he loses- we look at his pouty face, blaming others and telling us that we've done a bad thing electing Hillary for a total of 48 hrs AND THEN NEVER SEE THE MEDIA GIVE HIM 5 SECONDS OF AIRTIME EVER AGAIN. Please.
18 | Dale Miller | 2 | 1345597862203129_1345613915534857 | whether he concedes or not is really a moot point he will still be a loser, with a name like ronald the donald he has been a loser for a lonnnnnnnnnnng time so he is probaly used to it
19 | Chris Goodhart Downey | 0 | 1345597862203129_1345669628862619 | I am afraid though of what may happen if he doesn't concede. There is so much anger and hate in this election and Trump has made it socially acceptable to get violent if you disagree with someone, so who's to say we wouldn't see a rash of violent protests across the nation.
20 | Richard Smothers | 8 | 1345597862203129_1345600912202824 | What happens at the Olympics when a competitor doesn't get the gold and he refuses to concede? What happens at a horse race when the owner of the horse that breaks the finish line second refuses to concede? What happens to a skydiver whose parachute doesn't open and he hits the ground from 30,000 feet?
21 | La Duke | 3 | 1345597862203129_1345639315532317 | Nothing....Do us all a favor and don't cover him any more. We are sick of seeing his face and hearing his ridiculously loud voice.
22 | Carl C Eppler | 2 | 1345597862203129_1345666845529564 | He will have to concede. IF not,his brand will be tarnished, and could begin to lose a few followers. He would look like a person that does NOT want to make change, but simply talk about it, and that could end his celebrity.
23 | Tammi Jo Gilman | 2 | 1345597862203129_1345620438867538 | It will just make him look like a sore loser and we will all be thankful he didn't get elected! I am so happy I will never have to see his face or hear his hate ever again!
24 | Lena Benzzian | 0 | 1345597862203129_1345656685530580 | Why surprised millennials voting 3rd Party? Hillary hasn't come out & said NO more Wars. That's what they want to hear. They've been raised with war from Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria.. NO I DO not blame them. A complete generation raised with American Blood on others soil decade after decade. Just think about that will you?? They see money pored into war & none for their education. Yah they're not too happy... Rightfully
25 | Peggy Hanson | 1 | 1345597862203129_1345649382197977 | He worries so much about not looking a fool or being a looser. But if he refuses to concede, that's exactly how he will appear. Conceding would make him look like a grown-up.

Personally,and forgive the cussing, I am SO pissed that the media has decided to take over prime time instead of running the usual programs with the results banner underneath.  Enough is enough.
2 | Lori Lamb | 1 | 1345574175538831_1345617648867817 | It cracks me up how everyone is talking about Michigan and all the pissed off people in my state, while our Republican Governor is running these TV commercials about how he's turned around our economy on the back of President Obama who bailed out the auto industry and by the way they paid back everything. We are enjoying gas at $2.00 a gallon, jobs are up and no one is walking around screaming that the sky is falling. People are going on about their daily lives and all is well and will be well! Michigan will remain a blue state in spite of all the twisted lies this campaign season.

3 | Dean S. Troy | 2 | 1345574175538831_1345575438872038 | Anyone who is in industry or knows anything about the #EPA should take note that they have now changed their policy toward Boiler Mact rules after billions have already been spent complying to those regulations. A federal court recently deferred to the EPA to make those rules tighter and to cost manufacturers millions more individually without any effect on emissions. The point is to shut down as many power boilers and thus domestic manufacturers as possible. A Clinton win today is a win for huge international manufacturers at the expense of American jobs to destroy smaller domestic competition. That's what your Democratic party stands for today. #Hillary #Clinton does not represent domestic labor.
4 | Hilary Milo Campbell | 0 | 1345574175538831_1345576108871971 | Today's the day. Vote. Just get out and vote. Then make sure your family votes. And everyone you know votes. Then go find people who need help getting to a poll, and get them out to vote. I've made no secret of my preferences in this election, but you won't hear any partisan comments from me today. This is the most important American election in modern history, and the key to healing the wounds created by both parties in this electoral campaign is to start the next presidency with a clear decision by the electorate. Good luck!  #GetOutTheVote
5 | Bob Mulherin | 0 | 1345574175538831_1345615322201383 | SO! Who are you voting for? The harmless class clown frat boy or the Murderer of Benghazi who has never met a lie she didn't love. Who would you trust on the battlefield or babysitting your kids? The self serving clown or the sociopath killer. Hard choices to make as an adult isn't there?
6 | Shawne Boring | 2 | 1345574175538831_1345595898869992 | Today is election day. When you go out to vote today and you consider voting for Hillary Clinton. You might want to second-guess your vote. Hillary supports abortion, partial birth abortion at 8 months which is almost term. Now most of you supporters of Hillary will use the excuse that women have the right to abort a baby if they're raped and that they should have the choice to not carry a child if they are a victim of rape. However all you Hillary supporters ARE against the death penalty. Which is a bit messed up if you think about it. Because you're willing to kill an unborn baby that did nothing wrong but you will not kill the person that raped the woman getting the abortion. So I feel that if you are able to kill an unborn baby who has done nothing wrong but you are against the death penalty to kill an adult man who has killed someone or rape someone and they deserve to the death penalty for what they did, then you are just as bad as Hillary and these rapists and murderers, think about that. Not saying you have to vote for Trump just because he is the other candidate, there are other candidates as well to choose from. So, Choose Wisely. Don't choose Hillary.GET OUT AND VOTE....MAKE A DIFFERENCE....WE NEED CHANGE!!!!NOT MORE OF THE SAME...
7 | Bryant Amper | 1 | 1345574175538831_1345574345538814 | If ye love wealth better than liberty, the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom, go home from us in peace.

8 | John Zuk | 2 | 1345574175538831_1345583668871215 | If California didn't have over 50 electoral votes. No way would Hillary be able to win this election today. The electoral college and how they distribute votes is a joke as far as I'm concerned...I think it should be the person who wins the most states, wins the election.
9 | Bob Mulherin | 0 | 1345574175538831_1345669078862674 | Copied from a friends post: If I was asked to justify and explain why I voted for Donald Trump and I answered honestly I would have to say that if Donald Trump had ever put our nations security at risk, I would not vote for him. If his organization received large donations from countries that killed women and gays, I would not vote for him. If he boasted 30 Years of government experience, but still could not discern if an email was classified or not, without someone letting him know if it was or not, I would not vote for him. If he boasted about how he has defended children his entire life, but is for abortion, (even late term, when the child can feel pain) I would not vote for him. If he caused lives to be destroyed in Benghazi and then lied to the faces of the parents as they stood at their child's casket, I would not vote for him. If people who came against him mysteriously turned up dead, I would not vote for him. If he suddenly developed a southern accent when he was in the South, campaigning, I would not vote for him. If he continually broke the law and that was ignored, I would not vote for him, but right now, the ONLY person who does ALL these things is Hillary. I'm bigger than those remarks made by Trump and we all have said stupid things throughout our lives. To me, the fact that Hillary lies continuously, is a much bigger problem. We can see the effects of her lies by the state of our poor country right now...

But their work and that of many other suffragists contributed to the ultimate passage of the 19th amendment in 1920. Today is the day that a woman became President of the United States of America and before all polls closed tonight, it will be announced that HILLARY CLINTON is PRESIDENT!

25 | Luke Haskell | 0 | 1345574175538831_1345608085535440 | You are witnessing an end game battle for the next step to the NWO. This election is a potential Brexit on steroids. The trade agreements of the past were created to degrade America, remove industry, break down infrastructure and increase poverty and welfare.  A psychological war has been going on to remove the concept American exceptionalism creating good little NWO robots. Muslim migration, racism, anti police officer...is used to create crisis to lead to crisis response. Obama taught Alinsky, Hillary was his pen pal. One of the Alinsky tactics is to explode the debt. Obama has doubled the debt, Hillary will end the economy. You cannot have a welfare state and open boarders, it is sure destruction.  In this NWO objective globalist establishment Republicans work with globalist establishment Democrats, bankers, media, multinational corporations. The concept of man made global change was created by Club of Rome to give power being agenda 21. There is no man made global change, there is our decreasing magnetic field that is changing the density of the magnetosphere, that is our shield from the sun. It is a natural cycle of our earth. Research earths decreasing magnetic field.By 2030 TPP unites with the European trade agreements and agenda 21 forming  environmental hyper capitalist fascist United Nations controlled world trade and environmental courts that destroy the sovereignty of all participants and control every aspect of your life the largest control mechanisms being Food, Health, environmental regulations, education. The media is directed to achieve the objective. The institutions of learning have been brain washing machines to achieve the objective for generations. What is the real reason why so many are against school vouchers and charter schools and getting rid of the national education association?The Koran calls Muslims who do not follow sharia law hypocrites who will go to hell. It says those who migrate for the cause of Allah will receive the same reward as the mujahedeen the fighters. It calls Allah the greatest of schemers. The scheme is world wide sharia.The hypocrites are brave Muslim  souls who have love for fellow man and who do not follow sharia. The migration of Islam across civilized nations is being used to further break down society physically and psychologically. Along with increasing natural disasters and war against those who do not follow the plan for the NWO.The Arab Spring was to remove non sharia governments. Egypt, Libya, Syria. To further radicalize the middle East and set up the war against Israel. The Pulitzer prize winner Seymour Hersh said he believes Hillary was involved in the gas attack in Syria blamed on Assad. Obama was involved in the uprising in the Ukraine and replacing a Democratically elected government. Putin who is against the NWO is protecting his interests and trying to stop WWIII . He is up against the NWO propaganda machine. You are being lied to on a massive scale. Do your own research, remove the political correct scales from your eyes which have been created to blind you to your own destruction. General William Boykin, Admiral Lyons, Lt. Colonel Tony Shaffer, EX CIA intelligence specialists Clair Lopez, Frank Gaffney assistant director of Defense under Reagan, DHS whistle blower Philip Haney, respected investigative journalist Andrew McCarthy, Michele Bachmann...say, the Muslim Brotherhood has infiltrated every level of our government. They say at Benghazi we switched sides on the war on terror. Andrew McCarthy says Hillary secretary Huma Abiden is Muslim Brotherhood. ISIS has been used for migration saturation Jihad. Hillary will finish off the Constitution. Obama will go to the United Nations. We will become a police state as crisis response in order to control the insurrection created by fomenting hate against police, racism, and sharia law Muslims. Most of this is being financed by George Soros one of the most evil men on earth. We will go to into WWIII on the wrong side of the war. They didn't count on Trump. He was a wrench in the spokes. Now they have to destroy him by any means.Choose Trump or choose the NWO.

1 | Jeff Schmidt | 303 | 1561863277167030_1561867363833288 | It always interests me that the vile, deceitful comments all come from anti-Hillary people. The kind, thoughtful, truthful comments come from pro-Hillary people.
2 | Marcus Thomas | 116 | 1561863277167030_1561868030499888 | The road to 270 for Democrat is like driving to see Grand mother, no problems. The road to 270 for Republicans is like driving through Beirut, danger at every turn.
3 | Richard Monica | 52 | 1561863277167030_1561883273831697 | I am looking at the angry emoji and wonder ,,,are these people angry that an American is using her right to vote? I mean that is ALL the head line says,,," BREAKING: Hillary Clinton casts her ballot on #ElectionDay in Chappaqua, New York.".... I wonder if they are angry the other Candidates are using their right to vote?
4 | James M. Fabiano | 36 | 1561863277167030_1561882943831730 | Said prayers, blessings, chants and good energy to the Universe. May love and hope win today. May equalities prevail and grow. May women around the world be proud and stand tall. For equal pay, equal rights and for our planet and allies may we elect our countries first woman President Hillary Clinton <3 Blessed be, Amen and think I have my bases covered
5 | Roger Gaona | 61 | 1561863277167030_1561866680500023 | #Hillary 2016. Me and my lady are going out later today to vote for her. Hillary's got this what an exciting day!
6 | Kirstien Demuth | 35 | 1561863277167030_1561864053833619 | Listen up people, we are running out of time! Can you imagine the excitement on Wednesday morning when the Syrian people are told that Hillary won? They are going to be so happy knowing that they can now seek refuge in the USA! Hillary 2016
7 | William Todd | 22 | 1561863277167030_1561863877166970 | Ill be going to bed soon. I may wake up with Hillary as President. If that happens then I will be thanking my lucky stars that I am in the Philippines. I may even start an immigration business for those who would rather be here than in the US. (Whimsical thinking there).. Seriously though. I have played the game, I did my best to push a direction. What happens after to me is "whatever". Thank you all for playing along... I hope I didn't get too many pink panties twisted up with my male Hillary supporters lol
8 | Linda Gonzalez | 10 | 1561863277167030_1561873587165999 | Regardless who wins this election... I would NOT live anywhere else but the U.S.A. We may have our differences, but at the end we all work together. It what's makes this country powerful.
9 | Laura Hoey | 19 | 1561863277167030_1561866707166687 | Lol! It's going to be an endless stream of Trumpkin butthurt today!
10 | Paul Ydstie | 7 | 1561863277167030_1561878977165460 | Hillary Clinton did something wrong by using her husband's private server and even if you want to call it a crime, there were no victims. In contrast, Donald Trump has screwed thousands of Americans. He's never done anything for anyone, unless he saw a benefit for himself. This is a man who defrauded thousands of students who, just like many of his supporters, wanted to emulate him and his perceived success. Every time he has filed bankruptcy, he has walked away with millions of dollars, while leaving his unpaid contractors holding the bag. Most of his supporters are naive or just easily duped. They believe he's going to build a wall and make Mexico pay for it. They believe he's going to bring jobs back to this country when he has outsourced all of his own manufacturing jobs and even knowing he was running for President, made no effort to bring back a single one of those jobs. This is a man with no knowledge of current events, who possesses the attention span of a four year-old. He said he was always in favor of Brexit, but had never heard of Brexit a week before the vote. He said he had met Vladimir Putin in the "60 Minutes" green room, but even though their segments appeared the same night, Trump had no clue that they were filmed thousands of miles apart. Donald Trump said, "Vladimir Putin is not going into the Ukraine", completely clueless to the fact that Russian forces had already invaded the eastern territory of Crimea. I know it's hard to believe, but this is a man who actually asked, "Why do we have nuclear weapons if we're not going to use them?" ... As you go to the polls today, ask yourself, "Why don't you believe America is already great?" Many of you are planning to vote for a man who is not only dangerous, but a loose cannon who would possess the power to end the world.
11 | Hilary Milo Campbell | 6 | 1561863277167030_1561870127166345 | Today's the day. Vote. Just get out and vote. Then make sure your family votes. And everyone you know votes. Then go find people who need help getting to a poll, and get them out to vote. I've made no secret of my preferences in this election, but you won't hear any partisan comments from me today. This is the most important American election in modern history, and the key to healing the wounds created by both parties in this electoral campaign is to start the next presidency with a clear decision by the electorate. Good luck!  #GetOutTheVote
12 | Colleen Anderson | 19 | 1561863277167030_1561866153833409 | Today is the day people. Get out and #VOTE. The only way we will stop George Soros, the media, the DNC and the clinton machine from stealing this election is to #Vote .By the hundreds of thousands we must get off our knees, our couches and our butts and vote to #DrainTheSwamp
13 | Tina Hernandez | 4 | 1561863277167030_1561881277165230 | In Philadelphia pa the news said that uber and lyft is giving free rides to and from voting places, just FYI for people that don't have transportation
14 | Timothy Vandyk | 3 | 1561863277167030_1561886460498045 | Wow! Bon Jovi and Lady Gaga, two more of the wealthy elite class, who will never have to compete for a job with an illegal immigrant, who will never need Obamacare, and who have performed for the Venezuelan socialist elite, supporting Hillary. Enough said.
15 | Avonda Roberts Sweely | 8 | 1561863277167030_1561869713833053 | Thank you Hillary I am praying ! I can not let Trump become history for my 2 yr. Old grandson . He needs to hear your story years from now!
16 | Marion Rohling | 2 | 1561863277167030_1562020290484662 | What a Woman! She's been put through the greatest witch hunt that America has seen, she's been smeared & shamed without cause & she has put herself out there to fight for us. THIS is what stamina looks like, THIS is what it takes to be President, THIS is what a real fighter does, they keep on fighting!
17 | Emma Ginder | 1 | 1561863277167030_1561917430494948 | Imagine it is November 9, 2016 in America and we wake up knowing who our new President will be. If it is Hillary, think of the groups of people that will celebrate. Illegal Immigrants, criminals and future criminals who will be supported for pulling a gun on a police officer, planned parenthood, the media, and the list goes on and on that represent everything that is wrong with America. If you're still "with her," look around at who you'll be celebrating with. Now imagine waking up knowing that Trump is our new President. You may or may not like him, or really know what kind of president he will be. But here are some things you will know for sure:‚Ä¢ The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.‚Ä¢ The media has been neutered forever.‚Ä¢ Career politicians will have lost all job security.‚Ä¢ The guns in your home will safely stay there.‚Ä¢ Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.‚Ä¢ Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally‚Ä¢ Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.‚Ä¢ No more apologies to the world for being great!‚Ä¢ Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.‚Ä¢ Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.‚Ä¢ There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.‚Ä¢ The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.‚Ä¢ The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.Copy and paste this as your status if you support and will vote Donald Trump for president 2016. #trump2016.üá∫üá∏‚ù§Ô∏è‚úùÔ∏èüá∫üá∏‚ù§Ô∏è‚úùÔ∏èüá∫üá∏‚ù§Ô∏è‚úùÔ∏è
18 | Esther Ruskin Weiss | 3 | 1561863277167030_1561974867155871 | She's weathered many storms - real ones !  She's endured with strength and fortitude.  What she has gone through from the press, from the trump camp, from those who haven't read or considered has been surreal - !  I applaud this lady !  She has my respect and she has my vote !
19 | Jeffrey St.Clair | 1 | 1561863277167030_1561899367163421 | MSNBC - thanks for the uninterrupted election eve coverage last night from Philly. It was a great show and made me proud to be an American again.
20 | Paul G. Brown | 0 | 1561863277167030_1561971903822834 | News just in killery the cited for trump. Even she knows her lack of respect for the construction military and ambassadors of your nation are not in her qualities. However she gave the world our secrets.
21 | Shawne Boring | 0 | 1561863277167030_1561894953830529 | Today is election day. When you go out to vote today and you consider voting for Hillary Clinton. You might want to second-guess your vote. Hillary supports abortion, partial birth abortion at 8 months which is almost term. Now most of you supporters of Hillary will use the excuse that women have the right to abort a baby if they're raped and that they should have the choice to not carry a child if they are a victim of rape. However all you Hillary supporters ARE against the death penalty. Which is a bit messed up if you think about it. Because you're willing to kill an unborn baby that did nothing wrong but you will not kill the person that raped the woman getting the abortion. So I feel that if you are able to kill an unborn baby who has done nothing wrong but you are against the death penalty to kill an adult man who has killed someone or rape someone and they deserve to the death penalty for what they did, then you are just as bad as Hillary and these rapists and murderers, think about that. Not saying you have to vote for Trump just because he is the other candidate, there are other candidates as well to choose from. So, Choose Wisely. Don't choose Hillary.GET OUT AND VOTE....MAKE A DIFFERENCE....WE NEED CHANGE!!!!NOT MORE OF THE SAME...
22 | Roger Lee Lewis | 10 | 1561863277167030_1561864373833587 | If you want major changes in both party's vote Trump. If you want to keep things the way they have been for years and years vote Hillary
23 | Tata Garcia | 0 | 1561863277167030_1561990763820948 | Arriba las mujeres!Arriba los immigrants!Arriba la minoria porque algun dias seremos mayoria!Arriba America... Norte, Sur, Centro y todos los otros bellos lugares.America is already great!
24 | Bob Mulherin | 0 | 1561863277167030_1561921873827837 | SO! Who are you voting for? The harmless class clown frat boy or the Murderer of Benghazi who has never met a lie she didn't love. Who would you trust on the battlefield or babysitting your kids? The self serving clown or the sociopath killer. Hard choices to make as an adult isn't there?
25 | Michael Thiebaud | 3 | 1561863277167030_1561873710499320 | Justin Timberlake got in trouble for taking a selfie when he voted. How are all those cameras allowed to be there? Oh, Hillary's above the law. That's right. Killers with money can do anything they want.

If Donald J. Trump wins, policy experts and political veterans see the potential for an explosive time in office.

1 | Med Jersi | 102 | 1345553618874220_1345560892206826 | Trump's supporters wants you to believe everything they're saying about Hillary, but they refuse to believe anything about Trump. WHY ? Because they're using their hatred to cloud their judgement. Everybody needs to know with all what's going on in the world, specially with the Russians. We cannot afford a CLOWN to runs the most powerful country on earth who no clue how the system works. Hillary maybe not perfect, but we will be safe with her...period. I'm with her.
2 | Joseph Szarwark | 65 | 1345553618874220_1345555342207381 | I don't hate conservatives because I used to be one. But then I met people from different cultures, traveled the country and other countries,  learned about religions, studied everything people through political science in college, dated different people and now I'm center left. It took all that to tear down a Conservative wall.
3 | Rosemary Martino | 16 | 1345553618874220_1345561542206761 | It will be time to look for another country to reside. It is obvious Trump wants to be an autonomous President and doesn't care about anyone but himself. Too egotistical for the concepts of Democracy. A civil conflict is inevitable.
4 | Tom Thompson | 8 | 1345553618874220_1345611305535118 | Without a doubt, the all blue votes I just cast early this morning, were the most pleasurable ones I've made in my voting life. 18 months of suffering the B.S. con artist, reincarnation of P.T. Barnum. If there would have been a lever at my station, like the old days, I would have literally yanked it off its pivot. For too many months all I could do was voice my protest on social media. But this one mighty figurative yank, represented by an oval darkened by an ink pin, was the first time I could actually get my pound, strike that, my 260 pounds of flesh from the worst candidate for any office for all of time. I feel good!
5 | John Cox | 7 | 1345553618874220_1345612548868327 | Donald trump is not fit or qualified to run this country,it will be disastrous for all if he's elected,hate racism bigotry is at an all time high in his campaign,we can't allow donald trump to become our C.C.bottom line.vote blue.
6 | Laura Canavan | 11 | 1345553618874220_1345583355537913 | Remember the 1950's? The Cold War, women not working and having a say in life, pollution, no civil rights.. That's the America people want to go back to?  Not for me, thanks.
7 | Eric Forrest | 3 | 1345553618874220_1345598748869707 | Trump war with in America people dying no heath care all our allies will turn on us 3 wars Russians here everywhere all bad racism will be so strong that they would want different bathrooms water fountains schools different

11 | Judy Rowe Hamilton | 2 | 1345553618874220_1345575862205329 | I never considered "draining the swamp" to be explosive but Washington is such a BIG, DEEP, DIRTY swamp so it may take a big explosive to drain it.  And how stinky it will be as it drains!  Phew!
12 | Kevin Ivey | 1 | 1345553618874220_1345625815533667 | Points to consider if you're undecided:Corruption or real change? Wall Street, Banks, Globalist $$$ or standing against big $$$ lobbyists? Horrible trade deals and tax system that has caused our workers to suffer, wages stagnant for 25yrs or fair trade-taking care of Americans FIRST?Bringing jobs and co's BACK or encouraging them to leave the US? Term limits or lifetime career politicians? Open door for illegal immigration, drugs, human trafficking-women, girls, or enforcing the law and demanding that our 'friends to the south do the same? Abortion for any reason-sex selection, eye color, etc, up to the moment of birth or common sense guidelines and rules? War mongering or trying to work w other nations and demanding that countries pay their fair share and take care of biz?Upholding and respecting the law or thumbing her nose at the rule of law-one set of rules for her, her friends, people w power and another for you?
13 | Peter H Brouillard | 3 | 1345553618874220_1345568285539420 | Already, here in the state of Rhode Island, they are having problems with the voting machines. They tell you to leave your ballot and they will scan them in later. Are you kidding me? Our corrupt Hillary clone Governor Raimondo, is trying to rig the election because she is afraid to lose the state to Trump. I have been telling all do not leave your ballot. Go back when the machines are running. If not it will be "cherry picked" for the democrats.
14 | Staci Vikre Streich | 1 | 1345553618874220_1345606108868971 | For all the democrats who complained that the Republican representatives wouldn't work with obama and weren't doing their job - I agree and so did thousands of others and that is why trump is on the ticket - your vote for Hillary will be a vote for continued division in the government due to the fact all of her scandals revolve around corruption in the government - that will not change or get better with hillary - consider a vote for trump and join the 50% of americans who have decided enough is enough with political elite and we have hope to move the country forward and having this gridlock in Washington end.
15 | Daniel O'Neill | 0 | 1345553618874220_1345564252206490 | If Republicans in Congress have any morals, they will recess for a couple of weeks, to allow President Obama to rearrange the deck chairs before convening a lame duck session to prevent the demise of a nation.
16 | James Carol Dodson | 1 | 1345553618874220_1345671672195748 | The United States would probably be like North Korea with money if Trump were to win. If he does win the stock market will probably crash so there you go. We will be JUST LIKE North Korea only our Supreme Leader will have Blonde Hair.
17 | Cristan Jonas | 1 | 1345553618874220_1345690112193904 | Trump may make threats. He may delay conceding, but then the indictments will begin. Trump will lose his glossy coating in a spectacular fall from grace, and we will see the real shame he would have brought to the presidency

Kasie Hunt reports from outside a polling station in Chappaqua, New York as Hillary Clinton casts her vote on #ElectionDay.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Alan Pearlman | 9 | 1345553195540929_1345571742205741 | There's no doubt that Kasie Hunt is a skilled high quality journalist.  But I tuned in MSNBC to hear the latest news about the election and I was delighted to see Katy Tur anchoring the Live With Thomas Roberts program.  She spoke eloquently, handled her guests masterfully, managed the screen changes expertly, and enthusiastically transitioned from MSNBC Promotional Announcements to commercials. Katy Tur has always been one of the best reporters out in the field, but now I am looking forward to seeing her grace the studio more often.

11 | Crystal Morris | 2 | 1345553195540929_1345557218873860 | Hillary voters, give me your honest opinion. Is this really the woman you will vote for? One who will NEVER tell the truth? Do your own research on her. Here‚Äôs how to make it fast and easy - Here‚Äôs how the average American can person can do your own research about the F B I investigation into H R C. They released all their files to the public in the vault that ca be found online at vault.fbi.gov. On the right side of the page, type Clinton in on the search bar. This will bring up 616 related investigations (mind blowing right?) This particular investigation is titled ‚ÄúHillary R Clinton Part 01 of 04‚Äù.Interesting facts you will see:  Remember when Hillary said, ‚ÄúI turned over ALL my work related emails to the FBI?‚Äù. That was a big fat LIE. Look at the bottom of page 19. The FBI found 17,448 unique work related emails that were not provided by Hillary or her lawyers as part of the Clinton‚Äôs production to the FBI.  Remember when Hillary said, ‚ÄúI know exactly how to use, send, receive, and handle classified information?‚Äù. BOMBSHELL: Look at page 20. The FBI identified 3 different emails, encompassing 8 different email exchanges to or from Hillary Clinton‚Äôs personal email ‚Äòaccounts‚Äô, which contained at least one paragraph marked ‚Äú( C )‚Äù, a marking that indicates the presence of information that is classified. Hillary stated that she did not know what the ‚Äú( C )‚Äù meant at the beginning of the paragraphs. She speculated that it was referencing paragraphs marked in alphabetical order. The FBI only published up to page 21 of 45 so far. Judicial Watch law suites about Hillary can be found on facebook or JudicialWatch.org. You will find the latest information about the classified email Hillary sent to Chelsea. And all about the 20 out of 25 questions Hillary had to answer under oath that she COULD NOT remember about her emails or her private server. On 4 she pled the 5th on and 1 she conveniently remembered being misquoted by the media. Please take a moment and look for yourself. Ever heard of Travelgate, Filegate, Pardongate, Cattlegate, Watergate, or Chinagate? Look them up, they ALL revolve around Hillary Clinton scandals. Plus, there‚Äôs so much more. Just keep looking through those FBI files. Like I said, it‚Äôs mind-blowing. You can delve deeper and look into WIKILEAKS. If you still believe they aren‚Äôt true, why did CNN fire Donna Brazile over WIKILEAKS? Or, why was Debbie Wasserman forced to step down from DNC Chairman position over the WIKILEAKS? And, why has Julian Assange had to seek asylum from the US over WIKILEAKS? Just take a look.
12 | Dakota Purtell | 0 | 1345553195540929_1345682818861300 | I VOTED TRUMP!‚ö†10 reasons NOT to vote Hillary Clinton‚ö†1) Hillary Clinton is 69 years old; she had a serious head injury after passing out in 2012 and she‚Äôs had a much remarked upon uncontrollable cough throughout much of this year‚Äôs campaign with other complications.2) What message would it send to young women if someone as corrupt, dishonest and incompetent as Hillary Clinton were elected President?3) ‚ÄúHillary demanded White House workers never speak to her and hide behind the drapes when she appeared.‚Äù You think someone like that cares about you? At all?4) why would you let a rapest back in the white house? (Bill Clinton)5) When she was practicing law, Hillary Clinton defended a man who raped a 12 year old girl. She tore the little girl apart on the stand, got the rapist off with a light sentence and later laughed about it with a reporter.6) She claimed multiple times that she had to run for her life because her plane landed under SNIPER FIRE in Bosnia. Actually, when she landed there was a greeting ceremony and an 8 year old girl read her a poem.7) She wants to ban guns and disarm the United States. 8) Hillary Clinton helped create the Iranian nuclear deal that is allowing a terrorist-supporting, anti-American nation to get nuclear weapons.9) She is planning to expand on Obama‚Äôs unconstitutional waving of immigration law for young illegal immigrants.10) Her judgment on foreign policy is terrible. Not only did she get people killed in Benghazi, she supported our intervention in Syria.VOTE SMART!                       PLEASE LIKE & SHARE IF YOU SUPPORT!

15 | Tariq Marwan Al Mutawa | 1 | 1345553195540929_1345556545540594 | The endless Clinton family crime is going on and on and will go on for another 4 years. This criminal Clinton system is now legalised by and from an entire US rigged government system and all those Clinton crimes over a century are fully backed by Barack Obama! This is the most dirtiest campaign ever in the US history which the criminal Clinton clan is organising and arranging against the system and especially against Donald J. Trump and against the entire normal US citizen and the normal US society. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama this stands for corruption, fraud, supporting Wall Street in all criminal behaviours of national and international transactions, ISIS terrorist financing, TIPP, open borders, migrants, islamisation, NWO on behalf of the 5 most powerful families that control America and the world Rothschild, Rockefeller, Du Pont, Morgan and Bush and similar influential families and Hillary Clinton will initiate the WWIII.I hope even the stupidest, the normal and the clever Americans have recognised already how criminal is the Clinton family and there entire elite supporters are as well. Now it is proven Hillary Clinton is above any valid US law.Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton should be in jail for live-time for all her political and all her international war crimes and should not sit in the oval office in the white house to initiate more and more national and international crimes and to initiate a WW III.Be sure if Hillary Clinton will be President of the United States of America one morning the Americans will wake up and will listen to the news the ‚ÄúThird World War‚Äù has started already and this will happen in the very very near future.Sorry to say this, but it seems that many of those typical American do not understand what is going on or they are totally stupid and totally unrealistic ‚ÄúPerson‚Äù who know absolutely nothing what is going on the globe initiated by the US and how dirty are those US games of the US elite and the US establishment is, at home in the US and abroad to act criminal and to destroy countries where ever they like to do it. This has to be stopped for ever this criminal behaviour of the US politicians worldwide.Bring all those US high criminals the former US presidents and the US politicians include Barak Obama to justice right now in Dan Haag, before it is too late and I believe and I feel the WW III initiated by the US government started already.Citizens of Brussels have a Message for Americans heading to the Polls!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmvcx5jD5qA

22 | Kathy Crest | 0 | 1345553195540929_1345604912202424 | This morning I went on MSNBC's Facebook page, and I have been completely blocked from writing on it. People don't realize that our First Amendment right is being stripped of us. Our corrupt politicians don't want the truth out, but what they don't understand, is that it IS out. When Anthony Weiner's computer was confiscated, what the NYPD and FBI found was so disgusting and so vile, that the police chief said he broke down in tears. And how sad is it, that these authorities couldn't go to our media to expose the people that they now have hard evidence against, because the media is now OWNED by are politicians, VERY  POWERFUL POLITICIANS. We have now seen CNN stooping so low as to give Hillary Clinton the questions prior to the debate. And Wolf Blitzer was just recently exposed for emailing the Clinton campaign and asking what questions they thought he should ask. I don't understand what has happened to the morality of this country. The rigging of our elections is out in the public now. WE ALL KNOW this election has been rigged from day one. Yet nothing is done about it. What does that tell you? Our system is corrupt. There is SO MUCH corruption, and I mean on both sides of the aisle, that the system is in complete gridlock. No one can bring out anything against anyone else, because they all have too much dirt in their closets. The leader of the Democratic convention, Debbie Wasserman Shultz, was forced to resign after her emails were revealed and showed she had been rigging the election against Bernie Sanders. HE should be the one running against Trump, and the reason he was so popular, is that HE was against the status quo. His ideology about Socialism was nothing I could have supported, but he definitely resonated with people when it came to the corrupt establishment. The woman who took Shultz's place, was just fired from CNN as a contributor, because she was found to have been giving HIllary the debate questions prior to the CNN debates. So Hillary had a chance to memorize her answers, which is why she was never out on the campaign trail for days before a debate. Then we heard about her podium being rigged, and how she wore ear pieces to get information from behind the scenes. We have seen the results of an undercover sting operation proving the lengths Hillary went to rig this election. IT'S ALL ON VIDEO PEOPLE! NO ONE HAS DENOUNCED THEM! But once again, the Democratic party has been so use to getting away with all the corruption they are involved in, that they don't seem to care what kind of evidence anyone has against them. So what do you think these people, who have absolutely no morals or ethics, will do once they get in office? Look at how Obama lied us about Obamacare, and now we know that HE KNEW what this disastrous plan was going to do to our healthcare system. The main architect of Obamacare was videotaped over and over saying, "Obamacare was only passed because of the stupidity of the American people, and the lack of transparency within our government." He also said that if people knew they couldn't keep their plans and that their premiums would go up, Democrats in office could never have passed the bill. Just this week, we heard our own president in an interview with a Latino illegal, tell her and all the millions of illegals in this country, that it is okay to vote because "Once you are in the voting booth, you are a citizen." MY GOD PEOPLE! Really? What happened to upholding the laws of this nation? He just came out on live TV and told Americans that they need to give up some of their freedoms! AND YOU PEOPLE WANT TO VOTE FOR THIS PARTY??? YOU NEED YOUR FRICKIN' HEADS EXAMINED! How do you vote for people who want to bring in millions of Muslim refugees, KNOWING what they are doing to other countries who have let them in, KNOWING they are raping women and children, forcing citizens out of their homes because THEY DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS and can't protect themselves, and KNOWING that they are destroying the cities they have been dumped in? All I can say, is you deserve what you get. When these animals break down your doors, and you end up being lead away in handcuffs and shackles to a place where you will be executed by these people, remember who you voted for. Remember that at the Democratic National Convention this year, there wasn't ONE FLAG in the room until Americans showed so much outrage, and then all of a sudden there were flags all over at the 3rd debate. WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU? NOT ONCE was the National Anthem sung! NOT ONCE was the Pledge of Allegiance recited at the DNC. God is being removed from EVERTHING we do and EVERYWHERE we go. He is being replaced by Mohammed and Islam. And if Hillary Clinton wins this election (which she could never legally win after all the fraud) she will sell out this country to Saudi Arabia, the country that has given her SO MUCH, and Americans will be FORCED to either join the Islamic religion, or have their heads cut off. Don't you people watch the videos of these maniacs cutting the heads off innocent men, women and children, their ONLY "crime" being they believe in God? Don't you see the others who are put in cages and dropped into water to drown? Don't you see gays being walked off tall buildings to their death? These people are animals. They have NO SOULS. Their Quran tells them to kill anyone who does not believe in Islam. That is NOT a religion. That is a cult. And if Hillary Clinton becomes president, she will take our guns, leave us defenseless, and your lives will change like you have NEVER thought imaginable. I will be dead, because I will fight for this country until my death, but at least I will go out knowing I tried.

"The nation's democracy has been battered by a category 5 political storm unlike anything seen in the modern era," Chuck Todd writes.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Sherry Jones Levy | 30 | 1345533615542887_1345540812208834 | You, of all people, Chuck Todd, were part of the problem. Trying to pretend that this presidential election was the same as all others. Continously offering false equivalencies for the sake of ratings. You and the rest of the media are to blame for Trump‚Äôs rise.
2 | Paul Ydstie | 23 | 1345533615542887_1345540368875545 | Hillary Clinton did something wrong by using her husband's private server and even if you want to call it a crime, there were no victims. In contrast, Donald Trump has screwed thousands of Americans. He's never done anything for anyone, unless he saw a benefit for himself. This is a man who defrauded thousands of students who, just like many of his supporters, wanted to emulate him and his perceived success. Every time he has filed bankruptcy, he has walked away with millions of dollars, while leaving his unpaid contractors holding the bag. Most of his supporters are naive or just easily duped. They believe he's going to build a wall and make Mexico pay for it. They believe he's going to bring jobs back to this country when he has outsourced all of his own manufacturing jobs and even knowing he was running for President, made no effort to bring back a single one of those jobs. This is a man with no knowledge of current events, who possesses the attention span of a four year-old. He said he was always in favor of Brexit, but had never heard of Brexit a week before the vote. He said he had met Vladimir Putin in the "60 Minutes" green room, but even though their segments appeared the same night, Trump had no clue that they were filmed thousands of miles apart. Donald Trump said, "Vladimir Putin is not going into the Ukraine", completely clueless to the fact that Russian forces had already invaded the eastern territory of Crimea. This is a man who asked, "Why do we have nuclear weapons if we're not going to use them?" ... As you go to the polls today, ask yourself why you don't believe America is already great. Many of you are planning to vote for a man who is not only dangerous, but a loose cannon who would possess the power to end the world.
3 | Dama Arauz | 3 | 1345533615542887_1345541228875459 | While Trump was denying people of color apartments Hillary straight out of college worked in the south to desegregate the schools and was a lawyer for disabled children to have the right to attend schools. If your child is on the SCHIP program that provides health care to millions of children you have Hillary Clinton to thank for that. Hillary is the logical choice.

5 | Ann von Mehren | 0 | 1345533615542887_1345537892209126 | I'm enjoying your balanced coverage. The question of "brand" leads to questions of whether international investment knowledge is enough to handle the job of the President, from the Ukraine with its eastern third occupied by Russia to illegal immigrants without FBI and state child protection background checks near our children, perhaps even in our private or public schools and daycare centers. Does a family's "American brand" ability solve the inability of the national "American" diplomatic failures? If Trump wins today, he needs to prove he has the ability to lead the U.S. diplomatic corps, by appointing experienced government employees rather than naming family friends and associates as political appointees.

And most of all...A candidate who went after her husband‚Äôs victims after he raped them. Sound like a horrible human being right? Hillary Clinton has done all of these things and if she were not rich she'd be in jail by now.

23 | Bob Adams | 2 | 1345533615542887_1345538648875717 | If Hillary is voted in then America will continue the total change to the Republic by allowing millions of illegal immigrants, to vote and take American jobs. She has said she will raise taxes on the middle class to give refugees and continue to redistribute the wealth. "A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. It can only exist until the voters discover that they can vote themselves largesse from the public treasury. From that moment on, the majority always votes for the candidates promising the most benefits from the public treasury with the result that a democracy always collapses over loose fiscal policy, always followed by a dictatorship. The average age of the world‚Äôs greatest civilizations has been 200 years." This quote is attributed to Alexander Fraser Tytler. In 1814, John Adams said "Remember, democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts, and murders itself. There never was a democracy yet that did not commit suicide."

Christian faith says God knew us before we were born and thou shall not kill, Muslim faith states a fetus is a living soul at 4 months and Jewish faith states abortion is forbidden with exception given according to Jewish scholar Rashi In regard to life-risking pregnancies, How is it so many woman are voting for a person that will uphold the practice of late term abortion? I would rather stand with God and be judged by the world than stand with this world and be judged by God.

13 | Warren Murray | 2 | 10154806387577871_10154807545597871 | Hillary has always been in a position of service not leadership, people should use their head for more than hat mounts. Even president Obama had his programs hindered by the gop who declared they would work against him from day one. Any party or person who would stop the best interest of the people from being served, in spite of the fact that the majority voted for their opponent, is not a party for the people.

He's not responsible for any existing laws or policies. He's not responsible for any wars.  He hasn't killed anyone or left anyone to die in Benghazi. He's not under FBI investigationHe's not politically correct. He did not sell uranium to Russia. He doesn't drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes or cigars, or do drugs. What he is:A successful businessman who has used his executive knowledge to build a multi billion dollar empire. He's a builder and knows how to get things done on time and under budget. He's charitable and often does things behind the scenes. He financially helped the marine who sat in a Mexican jail for 200 days after he was released. He raised 4 wonderful children who have never been in trouble and are very successful. He's not running for the office of president because he wants power and money.  He already has that. He's running,  using his own money (over 100 million dollars) so he is not indebted to anyone but we the people. He has watched what has happened to the country and doesn‚Äôt like the path it's on. He believes he can fix it. He won't even take a salary to do it.I believe in him and think we should give him a chance to try."Hillary has attached herself to Obama, a fraud, phony & imposter.Read ObamaScare, my book that has Documents & Facts, available on Amazon.Thank you.Respectfully,Philip J Berg, Democrat Author, ObamaScare

23 | Jimmy Rockford | 0 | 10154806387577871_10154807876607871 | As a Canadian heres why I would vote for Trump. 1)Trump is so rich that he doesnt need to do this. Hillary wanted this so bad that she let her hubby have sex with and rape women. She wanted this so bad and knew she needed to stay with him. Thats sad. 2)The USA is a disaster present day thanks to all the corrupt establishment poiticians like Hillary. Trump isnt a politician. 3) Clinton Foundation pay to play is scary. 4) Just look at the names Hillary has called half of the population. Thats not cool. Im no Trump fan at all but all of the above weighs heavy on me. Hillary wins- the US loses more. Trump wins- who the hell knows what will happen> Nobody does.

Comey cited ‚Äúrecent developments‚Äù for the bureau‚Äôs decision on October 28.  These new developments came about during a separate investigation into the ‚Äúsexting‚Äù of Anthony Weiner ‚Äì the husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin.  U.S. stocks declined in a volatile session on Friday but were able to partially recover from a sharp drop spurred by news the FBI will review more emails related to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's private email use.  Each of the three major indexes on Wall Street fell to session lows, with the S&P 500 dropping 1 percent in an hour."The headline hit, everyone on Wall Street panicked that it was going to affect the outcome of the election," said Stephen Massocca, chief investment officer at Wedbush Equity Management LLC in San Francisco.Wall Street rebounded from a nine-day losing streak on Monday after Comey's decision to again not criminally charge Clinton with violations revealed during their investigation, posting its biggest gain in eight months and driving the Dow Jones industrial average up more than 370 points.  The gains came as investors focused mostly on the latest developments in the F.B.I. review of newly discovered Hillary Clinton emails.  That appeared to ease the market‚Äôs anxiety, which grew in recent weeks over signs that the presidential race was tighteningFinancial stocks led the broad market rally, which erased more than half of the losses racked up by the Standard & Poor‚Äôs 500-stock index since Oct. 25.‚ÄúClearly, the market is more comfortable with a Clinton win, only because they feel like they know her policies a little bit better,‚Äù said JJ Kinahan, chief strategist at TD Ameritrade.Banks and health care companies rose more than the rest of the market. Goldman Sachs and UnitedHealth Group had some of the biggest gains in the Dow. Goldman climbed $5.56, or 3.2 percent, to close at $181.48, and UnitedHealth added $4.22, or 3.1 percent, to $141.93."When you see that in order to produce, you need to obtain permission from men who produce nothing; when you see that money is flowing to those who deal not in goods, but in favors; when you see that men get rich more easily by graft than by work, and your laws no longer protect you against them, but protect them against you. . . you may know that your society is doomed.‚ÄùHillary 2016 vote early vote oftenSend, Receive, Repeat#feelberned#demfix#dncfix#LIE-kability #corruption#crooked#cronyism

If Hillary Clinton is elected, here's what she would face.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Robert Summers | 95 | 1345516872211228_1345520955544153 | Even if she does literally nothing at this point, which looks like it may be the case unless the Democrats win the Senate back, she would have done plenty. She would have kept the worst candidate ever from becoming president and putting judicial activists on the SCOTUS bench
2 | Nancy Mac | 20 | 1345516872211228_1345525308877051 | It's not about her. It is about getting rid of the worst congress in this country's history. Also she will have Warren and Sanders breathing down her neck to get real issues addressed.
3 | Theresa Studley Gadoury | 6 | 1345516872211228_1345524828877099 | Theresa Studley Gadoury Why hasn't anyone stopped Obama from making up the rules as he goes along? Illegals vote? This is not a third world country! We have standards and rules and they have to be approved before congress. A vote for Hillary is a vote for the New World Order. George Soros will not own this country. George Soros will not fulfill his quest to make the dollar worthless. George Soros will not do to us what he did to England and Russia. If you don't understand, swallow your ego, your pride, your "your lying" attitude and go to you tube and type in "George Soros Exposed" watch the first five minutes of the interview. Then, make up your mind if you are going to vote for a free America or the New World Order, complete with a one view media, complete with the UN millitary on our streets, complete with total helplessness because your gun rights will be stripped away. Take 5 minutes if you love America. Watch the video. Nobody's got a gun to your head. Vote Trump. Help us stop a revolution.

Last time we didn't see relief from The Great Depression until a socialist was elected running on the Democratic ticket.

9 | James Ben Asbel | 1 | 1345516872211228_1345557285540520 | I have long thought of Hilary as, at best, a tough defender of any ground already gained for another grim term or two until the demographic shift has reached the tipping point and real reformists have rebuilt the Democratic Party, or a new party. This was evident in 2012, long before the Sanders candidacy, which provides some evidence that new leadership may actually emerge.
10 | Alan Pearlman | 0 | 1345516872211228_1345546402208275 | I tuned in MSNBC to hear the latest news about the election and I was delighted to see Katy Tur anchoring the Live With Thomas Roberts program.  She spoke eloquently, handled her guests masterfully, managed the screen changes expertly, and enthusiastically transitioned from MSNBC Promotional Announcements to commercials. Katy Tur has always been one of the best reporters out in the field, but now I am looking forward to seeing her grace the studio more often.
11 | Donna Copeland | 3 | 1345516872211228_1345525105543738 | Dear HillaryWritten by Summer Marie on 10-14-2016. I really hope you do not become the first female president.I write this not because I am some crazy, right-wing, anti-feminist conspirator; I hope you are not our first female president because it would be a disgrace to that title and a disgrace to all of the young women in our country who aspire to actually do some good for our nation.Many people believe you are the best candidate for the position because you have been doing this political thing for a while‚Äîbut when was the last time that you were able to relate to the common American?You grew up in the rich white suburbs of Chicago as a young child and attended Yale. You then went on to ride Bill‚Äôs coattails all the way to your Senate seat as a former First Lady. Any true feminist would look at you and see that you are a fraud.You get on your soapbox and claim that every woman who is a victim of sexual assault should be heard‚Äîbut what about Juanita Broaddrick? Carolyn Moffet? Paula Corbin? Sara Allen-James? Christy Zercher? Kathleen Willey? Monica Lewinsky? All women who were sexually harassed or exploited by your husband. Yet you stand by him continuously, defending him and helping clean up his messes. If you ask me, that‚Äôs not very appealing to me as a woman. You also stood by him after he openly admitted to having ‚Äúsexual relations‚Äù with Monica. That sounds like a very conservative stand by my man move if you ask me.If you were as independent as you portray yourself to be, why didn‚Äôt you just leave Bill? Because you needed his political access to get your foot in the door.All of that aside, the sheer fact that you allowed four Americans to perish in Benghazi and then proceeded to later ask, ‚Äúwhat difference does it make?‚Äù proves to me that you don‚Äôt care about American lives. Those were four American men who died. Four families in our country that suffered a loss. Four mothers that had to bury their sons.‚ÄúWhat difference does it make?‚Äù‚ÄúBecause it‚Äôs not just a detail if it‚Äôs your kid, if it‚Äôs your family. It‚Äôs a big deal. And it should be a big deal to your president, too.‚ÄùA detail to you, former Secretary‚Äîbut to those families, a huge difference.Not to mention you want to allow all of these refugees in. Don‚Äôt get me wrong: I am a humanitarian. However, I, as an American citizen, am guaranteed safety as well as the safety of my future children and grandchildren in the Preamble of the Constitution of the United States. The one thing, if nothing else, that you as someone running for President of the United States should uphold. I understand that we should help people, but at the end of the day, would Syria do the same for us? In our time of crisis it is our job first and foremost, and yours, to ensure our own citizen‚Äôs safety.You use your platform of charitable humanitarian but now we are learning the extent to which your foundation is a fraud. It‚Äôs nothing but a money-laundering business that you can catch a tax break from.Which, by the way, is a wee bit illegal.You took up monetary donations after the Haiti earthquake and, yes, you did build a textile factory‚Äîon the opposite side of Haiti that wasn‚Äôt even affected by the earthquake. You also conveniently signed off Uranium to be given to Russia just after Uranium One shareholders deposited $145 million in donations to the Clinton Foundation. How thoughtful of them.You also claim to be against big business and fight all the big bad business bullies, but you‚Äôre in bed with them!Your daughter is, too. Your daughter married a former investor for Goldman Sachs. Your family managed to help spend some odd $3 million on their wedding. Wonder where that money really came from.You claim to be a friend of the black community and that you‚Äôre going to help bring them out of poverty. Look around! You are a part of the administration that has left them where they are and you have no intentions of changing that. You want control. Your mentor Saul Alinsky taught you that.You don‚Äôt know any struggle or strife. You are the epitome of ‚Äúwhite privilege.‚Äù You traipse around in heinous $12,000 suits and preach about how you are for the people‚Äîhow you are going to pull them out of poverty as you attend events where you give 20-minute speeches to the tune of $500,000 and eat $800 plates of food on your private plane.You have never faced financial strife. What makes you think you can help fix our national debt crisis?Above all things, if nothing else, the reason why I hope you don‚Äôt become the first female president is because you are a criminal. It does not matter if you didn‚Äôt intentionally use a server that was not secure. I may not intentionally go 55 in a 40 but the police officer is going to give me a ticket. I may not intentionally kill someone in a car accident; however, I can still go down for manslaughter. People don‚Äôt intentionally become drug addicts but you bet they still end up in prison for possession.You think you are above the law. You manipulate the system, which is not what a leader does. It‚Äôs not right.I am not some right-wing conspiracy theorist lunatic. I simply look at the facts.These facts tell me that I wouldn‚Äôt let you look after my pet rock, much less this nation.Yours truly,A Real Future Female Leader

I heard on CNN that areas which have more Democrat voters, the computers is down. Really..I strongly believe this is voter suppression by the Republican. Only areas that have mores Democrat voters computer's can have viruses. This is voter suppression.. DNC Please keep close eyes on North Carolina. Please. We don't want to leave any stone untouched
14 | Jeff Bartulla | 4 | 1345516872211228_1345529162209999 | She will face no support from the people at every level from impeachment hearings to constant leaks from those that rightfully believe she belongs in a jail cell. Don't believe this is inevitable the truth is the polls are too close so get out and end the corruption of Washington.

16 | Larry L Spence | 9 | 1345516872211228_1345526912210224 | Today is Our Judgement Day...Only God knows the Outcome and it will be his will...This Country will not Survive 4 more years of Corruption and these political Criminals...Vote for Real Hope & Change..Under a Hillary Clinton Administration:Healthcare costs will skyrocket out of necessity to fund all the illegals getting relief. The system will ultimately collapse and we'll be forced into a single payer system. Socialized Medicine. The goal all along.Lawlessness will reign. The Clinton's will rule the Department of Justice with a compliant Loretta Lynch at the helm. Laws will only apply to the little people while the elites will run wild with no consequence.After much "debate", the Second Amendment will be repealed. An unarmed citizenry is a compliant citizenry. We will become "subjects" instead of citizenry.The economy will continue to crumble. Our pathetic GDP will become "the good old days", as more and more jobs are lost and sent overseas with the TPP.No more borders. We will be flooded by socieltal burdens. Some just lazy; some good, hard working families; some very, very, very bad. It won't take long before we start seeing the results.Say so long to Freedom of Speech. Expect the return of The Fairness Doctrine to silence contrary thought. The UN will be given control of the internet and all "unapproved content" will be banned.The media will become emboldened to lie even more blatantly. They will direct the message for their masters in the White House.The Supreme Court wil be filled with Activist Judges. Our freedoms will gradually disappear. Not all at once. Bit by bit. So we hardly ever notice.She will finish what Obama started. Namely, the destruction of our beloved Republic. I know some don't believe this. But the writing is on the wall. You will see. And like Obama, regrets are an expensive thing.

20 | Paul Ydstie | 1 | 1345516872211228_1345540042208911 | Hillary Clinton did something wrong by using her husband's private server and even if you want to call it a crime, there were no victims. In contrast, Donald Trump has screwed thousands of Americans. He's never done anything for anyone, unless he saw a benefit for himself. This is a man who defrauded thousands of students who, just like many of his supporters, wanted to emulate him and his perceived success. Every time he has filed bankruptcy, he has walked away with millions of dollars, while leaving his unpaid contractors holding the bag. Most of his supporters are naive or just easily duped. They believe he's going to build a wall and make Mexico pay for it. They believe he's going to bring jobs back to this country when he has outsourced all of his own manufacturing jobs and even knowing he was running for President, made no effort to bring back a single one of those jobs. This is a man with no knowledge of current events, who possesses the attention span of a four year-old. He said he was always in favor of Brexit, but had never heard of Brexit a week before the vote. He said he had met Vladimir Putin in the "60 Minutes" green room, but even though their segments appeared the same night, Trump had no clue that they were filmed thousands of miles apart. Donald Trump said, "Vladimir Putin is not going into the Ukraine", completely clueless to the fact that Russian forces had already invaded the eastern territory of Crimea. This is a man who asked, "Why do we have nuclear weapons if we're not going to use them?" ... As you go to the polls today, ask yourself why you don't believe America is already great. Many of you are planning to vote for a man who is not only dangerous, but a loose cannon who would possess the power to end the world.
21 | Carol Roche | 2 | 1345516872211228_1345527222210193 | Remember we are stronger together. We need to back Hillary all the way against the Senate that has slowed down everything that has tried to be changed

25 | Adria Jackson | 10 | 1345516872211228_1345517915544457 | Nothing. Elections are about DONORS and over half of Hillary's are foreign. Trumps are Americans.

16 | Jermaine Cool | 1 | 1148453961905704_1148794705204963 | Clinton degraded Obama during the primaries 8 years ago despite the fact that they where both Democrats. This gave Trump the birther topic then too... I believe Clinton is paying for some of her sins through battering from an in experienced person like Trump. I remember Clinton calling Obama in-experienced 8 years ago she made that the centre of all her argument then. With the degradation meted to her by Trump she will hold to a high esteem the position of POTUS if she wins. She should learn from this experience. Trump on the other hand has nothing to loose... He Republican Party was never owned by him but he owned it in a way, when he loses to Clinton, the RNC will have a major restructuring to do to avoid someone close to what Trump is, never get the chance to do damage to the party like Trump did. Remember Cain for RNC during Obama 8years ago he was like trump in a way. No one ever thought that Trump will make it to the nominee position...

She learned that you can not beat them with good will alone, you have to have resources. She learned that any thing you say or do can be an investigation if they want one. 6 investigations and all ended the same. No guilt. The only thing she was ever guilty of was challenging male dominated power and their billion dollar lobbyists, in the case of healthcare. The insurance companies and Republicans swore they would make sure she regretted making them look bad in the early 90's. They have made it painful, but she will never regret walking out on that limb for the people.

Trump himself has not taken an active part in transition efforts, in part out of superstition: He fears too much planning before a victory might jinx the campaign.

2 | Sam Ringgold | 38 | 1345275545568694_1345282355568013 | Just what independent and undecided voters want to hear! So brilliant go ahead and name the rest of your cabinet dumb donald! What's Conway's role chief storyteller?
3 | Rita Kirkendall Rhodes | 21 | 1345275545568694_1345283135567935 | A bunch crooks and adulters!!!!!  Before ALL of you trolls say Bill Clinton, he is not running for President!
4 | Matthew T. Barrett | 14 | 1345275545568694_1345276802235235 | Hillary took America to war with her foreign policy but characterizes the other candidate as trigger happy and unstable.For those of us that are not partisans watching this year is entertaining.It's better then watching sports.Go vote for the people's candidate not the establishment puppet.
5 | Alan Pearlman | 9 | 1345275545568694_1345296568899925 | I tuned in MSNBC to hear the latest news about the election and I was delighted to see Katy Tur anchoring the Live With Thomas Roberts program.  She spoke eloquently, handled her guests masterfully, managed the screen changes expertly, and enthusiastically transitioned from MSNBC Promotional Announcements to commercials. Katy Tur has always been one of the best reporters out in the field, but now I am looking forward to seeing her grace the studio more often.
6 | Anthony Centamore | 2 | 1345275545568694_1345292778900304 | I believe in the American People. The hard working families throughout our country who's challenge is to provide for their children, live from pay check to pay check to pay their bills, try to live a decent and respectful life? All of us can agree we don't like to be cheated, lied to, taken advantage of in sneaky and underhanded ways? I believe they will see before they pull that level where the truth really lies..
7 | Catherine Stafford Veleker | 12 | 1345275545568694_1345308242232091 | His own big mouth jinxed his campaign.  But among the many good reasons not to vote for Trump, Gingrich and Giuliani are Thing One and Thing Two.
8 | Laura Westerfield | 2 | 1345275545568694_1345499328879649 | Trump hasn't done any damage to our country. Hillary on the other hand is only responsible for some deaths...oh and a little corruption...mixed with a little collusion with foreign countries...and a sprinkle of racism, condoning the abuse of women and gay people in terrorist countries...A dusting of lying to every American.. a pinch of putting national security at risk.. Nothing big mind you.. Clinton supporters just confound me.. smh
9 | Pat Roberts | 1 | 1345275545568694_1345496982213217 | No doubt.  Newt has always wanted to be president and, though remotely and behind the screen, looks like he will be since his buddy has no creds for the job himself....but then Trump has always been just the front man for someone/something else.
10 | Dorothy Gipson | 3 | 1345275545568694_1345486958880886 | Sorry Trump you won't get to do that....I figured they were hanging around you for something. You won't be President..hey what would Christie do ?? Head of the Transportation Dept.??
11 | Andrew Noseworthy | 3 | 1345275545568694_1345316448897937 | Belief in superstitions should be a disqualification for public office. And with Trump it doesn't stop there. His denial of the most basic tenets of science outs him as an ignorant buffoon. So glad we are hours away from seeing the last of this national embarrassment.
12 | Mary DeLuca | 2 | 1345275545568694_1345295148900067 | First Christie disappeared from the scene, because his staff was found guilty, then Giuliani disappeared after he talked about getting leaks from the FBI and whatever else happened there. Now he's left with Gingrich!
13 | Teresa Renae | 1 | 1345275545568694_1345429132220002 | Sorry Trump....I think all you have in your future is dealing with racketeering charge on the 28th and then the Status Conference coming up December 16th for the rape charge.
14 | Bill Manos | 2 | 1345275545568694_1345480852214830 | ‚ö†If you are Gay, Why are you voting for Hillary when she wants to bring in thousands of refugees that believe all Gays should be executed?üëÅ‚ö†If you are Black, Why are you voting for Hillary when she admires Margaret Sanger and defends Planned Parenthood who want to abort as many black babies as possible? Exterminate the black race because they are like "weeds". (Margaret Sanger quote) Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.üëÅ‚ö†If you are a Christian, Why are you voting for Hillary Clinton when she wrote her Senior thesis on Saul Alinsky who dedicated his book 'Rules for Radicals' to Lucifer (the Devil)? She says he was, and still is her mentor.üëÅ‚ö†If you are a Veteran, in the Military, or closely related to a Military member, Why are you voting for Hillary when she left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again? They called for help but the help was told to stand down.üëÅ‚ö†If you have a factory job, Why are you voting for Hillary when she supported TPP? Factory workers are being laid off because jobs are going over seas. Don't forget the deals she's made with china. She also welcomes open borders and illegals to get benefits to be paid with Your tax money.üëÅ‚ö†If you are poor, Why are you voting for Hillary, when she is supporting Wall street and all the big banks? Big banks keep poor people poor by destroying the poor man's credit by allowing medical bills and collections to affect your credit scores so you can pay higher interest rates than the rich; Taking much of the little money you earn.üëÅ‚ö†If you are a Woman, how can you vote for Hillary when she has buried all of Bills rape victims under the rug, including that little girl that was raped? Lawyer Hillary defended the rapist, and then she laughed about it later, knowing that he was guilty.If you carry a gun, or believe in the Constitution; How can you vote for Hillary when she wants to eliminate the NRA, Take your guns, and abolish the second Amendment?üëÅ‚ö†If you breathe, Why would you vote for Hillary when she and the Clinton crime family have left a trail of dead people that did not agree with her, or they knew too much?Who is left? üëÅ VOTE TRUMP!!!

17 | Timothy Reents | 2 | 1345275545568694_1345315892231326 | The bar is so low for the cry baby loser trump who chases story's of weiners, not winners.Untrustworthy Trump. Using fake polls, fake newspapers, fake news stories, trolls from all over the world to sell your propaganda... all the while Putin is building a new, much larger, KGB force....  Well seems really really UNTRUSTWORTHY TRUMP!The number of trump campaign staff that have active criminal investigations is growing fast! Thank you trump for being the law and order guy making it so easy to bring these "fringe individuals and groups" , both foreign and domestic,  out of the darkness and into the light of law enforcement.  I however would not support an amnesty deal for you in the process.
18 | Dave Cunningham | 23 | 1345275545568694_1345276352235280 | Good he didn't waste his time on transition.  Going to be completely unnecessary as it turns out.  Buh bye.
19 | Timothy Reents | 2 | 1345275545568694_1345316012231314 | Hiding "voters" under sheets....Okay, fine. Let's dispense with the politesse. DT is a nazi. He grew up in the shadows of a father who was arrested at a KKK rally in the 1930s. At the time he took over the family business in the 1970s, DT was forced to settle with the Nixon administration for rampant racism in his business practices. In the 1980s, he took out a newspaper ad calling for the execution of five black teenagers accused of a crime they conclusively did not commit. In the 1990s, his ex wife told a court he keeps a copy of Hitler's speeches for bedside reading at night. In the 2000s, he led the birther movement to delegitimize the country's first African American president. Throughout his campaign, he has associated with known racists. He has frequently retweeted posts by neo nazis. So yes, let's dispose of political correctness. Donald Trump is a racist and a fascist, the combination of which makes him a nazi. And people who support him, whether they admit it or not, either sympathize with his racism and hatred or live in a moral universe where Hillary's emails etc. somehow supersede the total moral failure of their candidate, a greedy, megalomaniac narcissist who exploits fear and hatred to advance his personal interests. So as you take a look at the profile pictures of the people in this comment stream who stand up to defend this indefensible man, kindly notice a pattern: they are almost all white, indeed almost all white men. They are inadvertently outing themselves. But don't kid yourselves. We see you. And we know who you are.
20 | Rick Higdon | 0 | 1345275545568694_1345539582208957 | Do you think for one second MSNBC that we don't see your spin on every post? Do you think thats how news is? I think you and CNN are running to see who can be the most corrupt news network in America!
21 | Andrew Buck | 0 | 1345275545568694_1345433808886201 | Hillary takes tens of millions from middle eastern countries that kill/beat women and gays by government decree, not to mention her foundation robbed Haiti of hundreds of millions after the earthquake which resulted in thousands of poor black Haitians dying! THIS DEMOCRAT will be voting for JILL STEIN 2016
22 | Caasain D'Etat | 0 | 1345275545568694_1345430715553177 | Vote Trump to give justice to Ambassador Steven. I wanna remind everyone about Tuesday November 8 2016. It's time for you to get out and vote. Vote for Progress, vote job creation, vote for security, for our military reform, vote for our immigration reform, vote for our Health care System, vote for our education system, and most definitely for Donald J. Trump who can make it all happened. Thank You
23 | Bob Mulherin | 0 | 1345275545568694_1345637795532469 | Today is the day. Who are you voting for? Such hard choices.  The harmless class clown frat boy who is good with money or the Murderer of Benghazi who has never met a lie she didn't love that can't be trusted to feed the dogs. Who would you trust on the battlefield or babysitting your kids or making a deposit for you? The harmless self serving clown who has a propensity for telling the truth and being criticized for it or the psychopathic killer who will lie at the drop of a hat, not answer that late night phone call to help you out of a bind or have no reservations about killing your baby. Let's see.......Who will you choose?
24 | Tammy Benson | 2 | 1345275545568694_1345386505557598 | You know why conspiracy theorists go after Clinton; it's because she's rotten to the core! She corrupts everything she touches...state dept.! Senate! Charity! Election!!! She's clawing over the bodies of murdered American in her thirst for power to rule this country...weak people are allowing it!
25 | Stella Ford | 0 | 1345275545568694_1345396502223265 | That is great news. Both of these men are brilliant and courageous. During 9/11 Giuliani was amazing and fearless. And in the nineties Newt Gingrich created a budget and pushed to get people off of welfare and strengthen our workforce...Because of him America really prospered. He did a terrific job. I'd feel very safe and glad to have both of these men in positions within our government. We will surely prosper.

"Speaking here tonight is perhaps the last and most important thing I can do for my country as first lady" - Michelle Obama

1 | Bonnie Campos | 927 | 727843227380705_727848077380220 | As a republican, I became insulted by the candidacy of Trump, and it made me take a closer look at the GOP, so now that I am safely on the blue team I should thank the huge pile of vomit, Donald Trump,  for helping me open my eyes ......                         ..........so VOTE BLUE.
2 | Katie Earley | 542 | 727843227380705_727851070713254 | Thank you Michelle for all you have done for our country.. You and President Obama will be missed so much .Thank you and bless you and your Familyüíùüíùüíù
3 | Ang Elo | 126 | 727843227380705_727851414046553 | It took John Bon Jovi, Bruce Springsteen, the president, and the first lady to get a crowd as big as the one that Donald Trump gets on a nightly basis when he's campaigning all by himself
4 | David Parrish | 106 | 727843227380705_727852100713151 | Loved the moment tonight while Madam President Clinton was speaking and said there's been a lot of rhetoric this campaign season (indicating Trumps nonsense), and a supporter in the crowd in a quiet moment yelled "not your fault", and Madam Prez. heard it loud and clear and got the biggest smile knowing WE got her back, and knowing who all is responsible for the deplorable atmosphere surrounding this election fault it is, and you could feel that this good woman needed to hear those words from a random supporter in front of the world to see!!! The amount of üí© the R's and tRump has put her through is despicable which isn't a strong enough word to describe it to say the least! She deserves better, and come Nov. 8th, We The People will deliver Sec. Clinton as our next President of The United States of America!!!
5 | Victoria Heart | 43 | 727843227380705_727850817379946 | If there is anything that this election has proven, it is the fact that men are always in the way of compitent women - they refuse to move and get out of leadership positions that they have no business being in, because they want to keep other people back.  When people realize the misogyny in the country, and make actual change against it, things will be better.
6 | Nickie Kalla | 41 | 727843227380705_727860360712325 | MY PRESIDENT and First Lady!!!! I'll never forget when I spoke with President Obama on the phone and he thanked me for being a part of his campaign. He trained me to be an Obama fellow, and I worked as hard as I could for him in Eastern Washington. I spoke at rallies, organized parades, registered voters, phone banked and made my contribution, because I believed in him that much. With Hillary, I learned to love her and though I haven't had as much of an opportunity to work for her campaign like I did for Obama, I still believe that it takes all of us, working together, organizing together, being focused on what we want to achieve. Thank you for giving me the opportunity President Obama to help shape history!  Thank you Michelle and Barack for being such awesome leaders.
7 | Ezio Carrozzi | 30 | 727843227380705_727852434046451 | Speak to the sheep every 4 years so u can use their vote. They never heard u and your beauty of a husband speak nothing but negativity while he was running for president. Apparently now shes the most qualified. #biggestscaminamericanhistory
8 | Karry Ann Mykonos | 20 | 727843227380705_727862107378817 | Mrs Hilary Clinton, A sophisticated women who will soon be the First Lady Of America just a matter of hours away. It has been a long hard road fraught with hard harsh words and criticism but she has battled through it all to come out the other end as fresh as when she first started on her campaign for the Presidency. Mr and Mrs Obama will be sadly missed but then again they are bound to be around the new President some where in the future. No matter what has been thrown at Mrs Clinton over the years she has never embarrassed her self in public and acted like a lady at all times. She should be the new First Lady of America. God Bless America at this Historic time and stay safe as your all vote for your candidate which ever it may be. America it is now time to decide.
9 | Faye E. Osbirn | 17 | 727843227380705_727881324043562 | Thank you Michelle Obama! We appreciate your service while serving as First Lady. You have served admirably considering the opposition that you had to contend with.
10 | Betty Jean Perez | 20 | 727843227380705_727865020711859 | As a democrat, I am tired of all the corruption we have experience in the last eight years and it will not get any better if another democrat gets in again, it will be the same old, same old. That is why I took a good look at the republican party and changed to be able to vote for the best candidate Donald Trump. God help us all if Hillary Clinton wins.
11 | Micah Langley | 20 | 727843227380705_727859357379092 | Not criminals, not rapists, not illegals. Who will really celebrate if she wins?‚Ä¢ All Immigrants‚Ä¢ African Americans‚Ä¢ Middle-Class Families‚Ä¢ Hispanics‚Ä¢ The Developmentally Disabled‚Ä¢ Women‚Ä¢ The LGBT Community‚Ä¢ Low Income Families‚Ä¢ The Physically Disabled‚Ä¢  VeteransTrump supporters shouting that Clinton voters are a culmination of rapists and minorities is just another reason one should never vote Trump. Those views of the world and of world's people and of the American people are tainted. Those views of ignorance, hate-centered rhetoric, and the words and actions of that candidate should never be given a stage, or God help us all.
12 | Duke Slade | 40 | 727843227380705_727847747380253 | This is your moment. This is your time to take a stand. When your grandchildren speak of you they will recount that you stood for America. You did not surrender. You did not run away. You held strong for freedom and the Constitution. You defeated Hillary Clinton. You voted Trump. You ensured that America survived.
13 | Denise Karisny Ridgeway | 11 | 727843227380705_727857570712604 | What First Lady????? I don't see her! Oh sorry, my bad, thought I was tuning in to the Trump rally! Now it all makes sense.  TRUMP/PENCE!
14 | Candy Clontz | 4 | 727843227380705_727866507378377 | If you're okay with Hillary being bought by America's allies, be sure to enlist so you can shed YOUR blood for her not our soldiers in the the war that will come. My family, my children, my family, my friends, my country and my family of soldiers deserve better. Its a shame you don't hold your family above what she is.
15 | Denise Godwin Pfeltz | 6 | 727843227380705_727877604043934 | This election is not about two different personalities or really who has said or done what in the past because both parties will defend their candidate no matter what has happened in the past. The election tomorrow is really about what this country is going to become once one of these people take office. There are two totally different visions of America. Hillary will be building on what Obama has done for the past 8 years, which if anyone can tell me that race relations are fantastic, police officers are safe, veterans are getting the medical treatment they deserve, inner cities are drug and gang free with plenty of job opportunities and great schools, Obamacare has supplied everyone with troublefree affordable healthcare, we are energy independent and we don't have to depend on terrorist sponsored countries, we have a well built well funded military with no threat of another terrorist attack on our soil, and a totally transparent government with no corruption and only our best interest in mind then please speak up because I don't see it. We could be so much better, Donald Trump wants to bring back manufacturing, cut taxes so businesses can grown and hire, responsible immigration so our citizens have jobs and are taken care of first, better city schools so people are better prepared for life, energy independence that will create more jobs. He knows business and how to make many people successful. Hillary on the other hand is only interested in making Hillary successful. Donald Trump did not have to run for POTUS, he had a amazing successful life for he and his family, plus the abuse that he and his family have endured this campaign, for what? It is because he has a love for this country and the people in it and wants to see Americans live their dream like he has lived his. He has not gotten fare representation during this campaign, the press has been terrible, highlighting fabricated stories about him, not covering Hillary's scandals, cheating during the debates, encouraging and hiding voter fraud. He hasn't been a perfect person, but that reminds me "He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone". What is important now is that his intentions are genuine, Hillary's are not. She is not even qualified for the job with a 30 year public track record of failure, ineffectiveness, irresponsibility, greed, secrets, scandals and lawlessness. Plus she should have been indicted and at the very least had her security clearance taken away. Nothing she touches turns into success. Please give Donald Trump a chance.
16 | Pamela Rider | 9 | 727843227380705_727861837378844 | This is been a very emotional evening for me & I'll bet I am not alone. I'm glad the Obamas are not leaving Washington -- gives me hope that both, in their own ways, will continue to inspire & support America's citizens.  (Also hoping that all of us who love our POTUS will follow his advice on who to vote for.  Making History double down !!
17 | Tal Green | 6 | 727843227380705_727870350711326 | I dont vote blue or red... I will only vote for the best candidate in my eyes.... & it certainly isnt Hillary... after Obuma that could if possible only make things worse... after all the mud slinging aside Trump (prior to all the debate bs) clearly has a better handle on what I vies as important... the economy (nafda) ...the infrastructure & a surprisingly good grasp of whats most important... knows exactly why we cant dictate terms to the countries that buy our debt (which Obuma almost doubled)....
18 | Cindy Stiles Foster | 9 | 727843227380705_727860310712330 | The Haitians are trying to warn us that they NEVER saw the money that millions of people gave to the Clinton Foundation to help them. They say she pretends to be a friend but lied and is their enemy. She never gave them all the money raised for them. She kept it!
19 | C.A. Maskew | 10 | 727843227380705_727864557378572 | Michelle is absolutely right. Hillary never quits. She certainly never quits lying. She never quits taking money from people who want her to support them. Oh wait, she did quit once...that one time when our ambassador and fellow citizens needed help, yeh she quit on them.
20 | Richard Martinez | 14 | 727843227380705_727857377379290 | Lol. Michelle hates hillary and had some harsh criticism of her back in 2008..now, just like a good ol politician she's talking out her her azz just to get that vote!#neverhillary
21 | Ihrig Teri Lynn | 7 | 727843227380705_629534080562952 | I just could cry. We're losing the most amazing POTUS and FLOTUS since the '60's. So many of you don't have any clue how much it matters that dignity, benevolence, intelligence, common sense and a desire to support the greater good, matters to the success of this country. If you vote for the wrong candidate this year, your whole life will suffer.
22 | Reza Kamali | 5 | 727843227380705_668151270019145 | thank first God Bless the First Lady of the United States - Michelle Obama ,tomorrow the great American's is gonna make another history by breaking the glass ceiling and show the beauty and power of blue sky all over United stat shine the 8 years legacy of one of the greats President in American history Barack Obama: The People's President by sending the first Lady President Hillary Clinton to the white house.
23 | ML Riverside | 12 | 727843227380705_727850594046635 | I mean no disrespect to any First Lady, but this is just ridiculous after all the stuff that has been pulled by this group of people. Very sad. Trump/Pence for 2016.

The system will ultimately collapse and we'll be forced into a single payer system. Socialized Medicine. The goal all along.Lawlessness will reign. The Clinton's will rule the Department of Justice with a compliant Loretta Lynch at the helm. Laws will only apply to the little people while the elites will run wild with no consequence.After much "debate", the Second Amendment will be repealed. An unarmed citizenry is a compliant citizenry. We will become "subjects" instead of citizenry.The economy will continue to crumble. Our pathetic GDP will become "the good old days", as more and more jobs are lost and sent overseas with the TPP.No more borders. We will be flooded by socieltal burdens. Some just lazy; some good, hard working families; some very, very, very bad. It won't take long before we start seeing the results.Say so long to Freedom of Speech. Expect the return of The Fairness Doctrine to silence contrary thought. The UN will be given control of the internet and all "unapproved content" will be banned.The media will become emboldened to lie even more blatantly. They will direct the message for their masters in the White House.The Supreme Court wil be filled with Activist Judges. Our freedoms will gradually disappear. Not all at once. Bit by bit. So we hardly ever notice.She will finish what Obama started. Namely, the destruction of our beloved Republic. I know some don't believe this. But the writing is on the wall. You will see. And like Obama, regrets are an expensive thing.

Can you imagine how much the government can control you when they finally control every aspect of your life. Do what they say or you will lose your income, healthcare, housing, free education, and so on. It's not like you'll be able to go out and get a job. The robots will have them. This is the future if you vote for Hillary. Democrats love massive government. Now they will get it, along with the controlling of every aspect of your life. Ha make the democrats turn off their servers.

Couldn't even defend Benghazi and we expect her to defend our nation? Whoever supports her wants the higher Obamacare premiums. We warned you in 08 about Obamacare and were right. We are now warning you that war will be on this land within 4 years with Hillary in office. Don't say you weren't warned. You wanted this.

All of the media will own it. Our military is so depleated, and Clinton doesn't want to make it strong and ready for anything . And when we Putin puts us back in the cold war !! You own it. When there is no vindication for 4 brave men in Bengazi, remember you own it. And when these unvetted refugees start murdering us, and ISIS , is here taking our Country ,you own it. !!

She arranged for her brother to get gold mining contracts in Haiti (when none had been issued 50 years prior) - screwing the Haitians out of 1/2 the royalties (while they STILL suffer from the ravages of an earthquake).  She tolerates Christian genocide - the buying, selling and gang raping of Christian women in the middle east - and takes $12 million dollars from The King of the Poor - the Moroccan king who lives a life of luxury while his people suffer.

She learned that you can not beat them with good will alone, you have to have resources. She learned that any thing you say or do can be an investigation if they want one. 6 investigations and all ended the same. No guilt. The only thing she was ever guilty of was challenging male dominated power and their billion dollar lobbyists, in the case of healthcare. The insurance companies and Republicans swore they would make sure she regretted making them look bad in the early 90's. They have made it painful, but she will never regret walking out on that limb for the people.

We can either vote to keep the same corrupt system, the same stagnant economy, and to continue our decline in standing on the world stage, or we can vote for change and send a message that we've had enough of business as usual, that we are tired of the corruption in Washington, and that We The People have had enough. If you think that this is a good as we can do, then vote for Hillary Clinton. If you think that we can rise to greater heights, greater aspirations, and to better our nation for ourselves and our children, vote for Donald J. Trump. The choice is clear.

Hillary Supporters, You think you are right about voting for Hillary Clinton, but the children in your family will suffer tremendously in a country with no borders and no guns to protects ourselves. I am assuming that when you go to bed at night that you don't lock your doors and that there is a sign in your yard saying "Come on in", coz that is exactly what Hillary represents for this country. No security while we go about our daily lives and inviting all terrorists, drug smugglers, and hardened criminals to come on in. Shame on you for not thinking about the future of your children a little harder before you made this crucial decision. If she wins, you will see the America you have created for them.

Hillary Clinton is the best person for the job! Vote and make it happen!
2 | Andy Charles | 23 | 10154068315244067_10154068510769067 | This is the future of America. Those seeking a higher minimum wage and the democrat platform will enjoy the new America. Can you imagine how much the government can control you when they finally control every aspect of your life. Do what they say or you will lose your income, healthcare, housing, free education, and so on. It's not like you'll be able to go out and get a job. The robots will have them. This is the future if you vote for Hillary. Democrats love massive government. Now they will get it, along with the controlling of every aspect of your life.

OMG! Do his followers understand what he said? He's no leader of any movement. Bernie Sanders was and is the leader of a movement. Leaders/warriors do not give up the good fight in the face of defeat. But those are leaders and warriors. Clearly, Trump is not. He is willing to walk away. I honestly feel badly for them

The system will ultimately collapse and we'll be forced into a single payer system. Socialized Medicine. The goal all along.Lawlessness will reign. The Clinton's will rule the Department of Justice with a compliant Loretta Lynch at the helm. Laws will only apply to the little people while the elites will run wild with no consequence.After much "debate", the Second Amendment will be repealed. An unarmed citizenry is a compliant citizenry. We will become "subjects" instead of citizenry.The economy will continue to crumble. Our pathetic GDP will become "the good old days", as more and more jobs are lost and sent overseas with the TPP.No more borders. We will be flooded by socieltal burdens. Some just lazy; some good, hard working families; some very, very, very bad. It won't take long before we start seeing the results.Say so long to Freedom of Speech. Expect the return of The Fairness Doctrine to silence contrary thought. The UN will be given control of the internet and all "unapproved content" will be banned.The media will become emboldened to lie even more blatantly. They will direct the message for their masters in the White House.The Supreme Court wil be filled with Activist Judges. Our freedoms will gradually disappear. Not all at once. Bit by bit. So we hardly ever notice.She will finish what Obama started. Namely, the destruction of our beloved Republic. I know some don't believe this. But the writing is on the wall. You will see. And like Obama, regrets are an expensive thing.

10 | Carmen Perryman | 0 | 10154068315244067_10154069403164067 | Today is election day. Some say it is like picking the better of two evils. Maybe it is so, maybe it has always been that way and will continue to be this way. However one thing is clear. I am picking the better candidate for president today. I rate people on what they do and say. What am not going to do is vote for someone who talks down to people, ridicule someone for their social standing, race, culture, gender, disability, or religion. We will not elect some who misses the good old days when life was good for only one set of people, while the rest was made to feel inferior based on their social standing, race, culture, gender, disability, or religion. I will not do it! So today like I did in 2008, and again in 2012 when I voted for a BETTER AMERICAN, I am voting and banking on a BETTER AMERICAN to lead this nation again. My future, that of my children, relatives, friends and my fellow Americans. I am voting for the future, not the past, cause we are not going back to the days when it was okay to destroy people who were different based on their social standing, race, culture, gender, disability, or religion. We are not going back! You might call it voting for the better of two evils, and perhaps you might be right. However, like in time past, I am voting for HOPE, and CHANGE for a BETTER AMERICA!

24 | Tevin Giles | 0 | 10154068315244067_10154068657674067 | Reposted from Dan HagenWhether or not she becomes the president, Clinton will remain an uninspiring figure who is irrelevant to the future. She's too compromised by her corporate toadying and indifferent in inequality to be of any real use. A spent figure from the dead past, she will be a caretaker president at best. Her only usefulness is that she's not Trump. The future, if we are to have any, remains with Bernie's revived liberal movement.
25 | Andrew Buck | 0 | 10154068315244067_10154068824209067 | Hillary takes tens of millions from middle eastern countries that kill/beat women and gays by government decree, not to mention her foundation robbed Haiti of hundreds of millions after the earthquake which resulted in thousands of poor black Haitians dying! THIS DEMOCRAT will be voting for JILL STEIN 2016

It‚Äôs unfortunate, but it‚Äôs true: Nearly every day on the campaign trail yielded at least one outrageous claim from the candidates.

We are going to see huge Trump supporters standing in line tomorrow all over this country. We have been waiting so long for this. We want real change, real jobs, real healthcare, real justice, we want law & order, we want our veterans taking care of, tired of seeing politicians get richer and richer off the backs of hard working Americans. YES!! We want a leader who is going to put America and Americans first for a change! A leader who is going to secure our borders and keep us safe! Yes!! Huge crowds, millions and millions will turn out for Donald J Trump tomorrow and we will make America great again!! #TRUMP2016

So, you can't imagine the speed with which technology works, but you think we can cram 650 million POEPLE through .... what? And, where the hell you getting that many people from?   If I have anything to say about either of you, it's that you don't understand how new technology works and you don't understand how it really can cripple our country. Knowing how to tweet.... doesn't qualify as being computer literate.
4 | Christopher Hugh Varney | 11 | 1345173795578869_1345179615578287 | Lies aside, why did it take MSNBC long to start calling Trump on them as opposed to giving him a free stage for 18 from which to shovel his propaganda?
5 | Candice Wagner | 2 | 1345173795578869_1345260472236868 | So do his supporters and they never admit to being wrong about anything. Even when clearly pointed out their reasoning is flawed. Its not a viewpoint it's a personality type

7 | Dallas Butler | 1 | 1345173795578869_1345413305554918 | No fact checking..so what do you think happens? Fact : hundreds of thousands of emails can be reviewed and processed because there is software created for that purpose IF you know what you're doing.. otherwise yes lie about it because YOU can't do it!
8 | Meme Beth Elliott | 2 | 1345173795578869_1345183388911243 | Let's not look back. Trump got the pants on fire award last year, and is leading the way to repeat for this year. Next election, we need to have people with cattle prods that stand next to the candidates to keep them honest.
9 | Jade Elaine Ryder Erhard | 1 | 1345173795578869_1345211562241759 | Yet these falsehoods were not called out for the general public as they should have been. The media including MSNBC has a tremendous responsibility for the rise and selection of Trump as the GOP candidate.

It is undeniable - no more glossing things over as "republican lies." The question we supporters of Bernie, Stein, Trump, and Johnson have for you is this: Can you tell us why you are still voting for her? See if you can manage to do this without being a troll. Say something intelligent (hope that is not too much to ask).
14 | Scott Rodriguez | 0 | 1345173795578869_1345241502238765 | The most amazing thing about this election is the media being exposed as in the tank for Hillary, and their misleading the American people with their collusion with the DNC. Wake up people, the rich and elite only care about themselves
15 | Dana Pontillo | 5 | 1345173795578869_1345179475578301 | Donald Trump has a 300 word vocabulary, and his team just took his twitter away. How anybody could possibly vote for this 70 year old juvenile just boggles my mind. I've been a republican for 45 years, and could never even imagine voting for this imbecile!!!
16 | Greg Caldarone | 1 | 1345173795578869_1345242998905282 | Just listening to Bruce Springsteen at Hillary Clinton's rally in Philadelphia. After praising her vision on health care, employment, women's rights, immigration reform, world affairs and global science. He then addressed her opponent saying " This is a man who's vision is limited to little beyond himself, who has the profound lack of decency that would allow him to prioritize his own interests and ego before American democracy itself. Someone who'd be willing to damage our long cherished and admired system rather than look to himself for the reasons behind his own epic failure. That's unforgivable. Tomorrow those ideas and that campaign are going down!   Well............That's why he's The Boss
17 | Kathy Kaufman Weber | 1 | 1345173795578869_1345198142243101 | I just heard that orange orangutan, saying HE will bring the country together. Heh. And then he went on to say we'll be "one people under one God", still not understanding the constitution.

Whitewater, Travelgate, Foundation favors, Filegate the list never ends‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..She cannot be trusted with the presidency of the United States.Let‚Äôs bring back the America we grew up in!!! Stop the Corruption and VOTE DONALD TRUMP!!!
19 | Loren Jury | 3 | 1345173795578869_1345192602243655 | It‚Äôs no secret that the mainstream media is a giant liberal cesspool willing to do and say anything to make sure their Democrat candidate gets elected. In this case it‚Äôs Hillary Clinton. Yet in the midst of two consecutive email scandals, her record of failure, including letting four Americans die in Benghazi, and having the father of the terrorist responsible for the worst attack since 9/11 sitting behind her at a recent rally, all the media can report is, ‚ÄúHey, look, Trump said something distasteful again!‚Äù
20 | Susan Clegg Bruder | 2 | 1345173795578869_1345232198906362 | If Hillary Clinton is elected, we will face: More terror attacks as ISIS is emboldened. Her liberal Supreme Court nominees repealing the 2nd Amendment. Obamacare expanded into Hillarycare. AND sky rocketing taxes, burdensome, job killing regulations and sure economic collapse.
21 | Tammie Lillard | 1 | 1345173795578869_1345239272238988 | With as many Christians, Jews and Muslims in America how is this race even close? Each of our faiths is against abortion. Christian faith says God knew us before we were born and thou shall not kill, Muslim faith states a fetus is a living soul at 4 months and Jewish faith states abortion is forbidden with exception given according to Jewish scholar Rashi In regard to life-risking pregnancies, How is it so many woman are voting for a person that will uphold the practice of late term abortion? I would rather stand with God and be judged by the world than stand with this world and be judged by God.

2 | Denise Navetta | 70 | 1561248307228527_1561254753894549 | No thank you. I have seen way too much of this racist, misogynist, insane, sub human already. If your network continues coverage of this monster after this nightmare election is over, you will be losing our household from your ratings.
3 | Shannon Elizabeth Davis | 73 | 1561248307228527_1561249443895080 | I'd rather watch paint dry than watch his campaign in two minutes.
4 | David Cusson | 17 | 1561248307228527_1561283413891683 | I will be happy when this nightmare of a candidate is on the trash heap!  He is the most disgusting individual who has ever run for office. No morals, no ability to tell the truth, no filters., no redeeming qualities what soever. Being rich is not a redeeming characteristic. He did work hard for what he has, I don't doubt that, but he made his riches through smoke and mirrors and by stepping over the backs of countless people who trusted him to treat them fairly.
5 | Terry Astles | 14 | 1561248307228527_1561287080557983 | Tomorrow evening we will all witness a huge landslide, Trump and all the trash supporting him will be humiliated and it will be the end of this Horrible Orange Clown! --- So, get ready America! Hillary Clinton will be the first female elected President of the United States.
6 | Jewel Aldridge | 5 | 1561248307228527_1561267007226657 | Copied from another post: The following letter addressed to Donald Trump I am sharing with you was written by a lady on another page. She asked readers to share it... feel free to do so... My open letter to Trump supporters. I know it is long but please read and take a second to think about it. The future of this country depends on it. Feel free to share! So You Want Someone To ‚ÄòTell It Like It Is‚Äô? OK, Here You Go. 1. You join a lying machine and call Hillary crooked. But you support a man who refuses to release his tax returns. You support a greedy, self serving, manipulative proven tax cheat. You support a crooked narcissistic psychopath who is worried his tax returns would reveal evidence of financial ties to Russian oligarchs and other dictators of the world. Just like we now know Putin's puppets illegally paid millions to his crooked former campaign manager, maybe he has been getting paid too. A corrupt little man whose daughter vacations with Putin's girlfriend. Making Russia great again? A con man who funneled millions of campaign money to his own companies and used campaign money to pay his family handsomely. Using his own words, a disgusting and corrupt man who surrounds himself with a disgusting corrupt people. 2. You say you love our veterans but support a man who believes POWs are not heroes because they were captured? A man who has shown he lacks emotional intelligence when he attacked families of a fallen war hero. A man whose company fired a veteran for being deployed to Afghanistan. A man who insults and derides our generals.3. You think a soulless, heartless small man who mocked a disabled reporter will make a good president. A man whose first instinct after a tragedy is always self-aggrandizement, like after Orlando mass shooting & when Dwyane Wade's cousin Nykea Aldridge was killed. As 3,000 people were dying, this man bragged about how 9/11 attacks were good for him & bragged about how his building is now the tallest in Manhattan just hours after the attack. When the pound fell to a 30-year low following the vote to exit EU, he boasted about making money off British economic uncertainty. When the housing market collapsed in 2008 and millions of Americans lost their homes, he said ‚Äú I 'sort of hope' real estate market tanks.‚Äù Trump is always looking out for Trump. How do you believe a greedy, narcissistic man who fundamentally lacks empathy and compassion will be a good president? He is not even a good person.4. You say you're patriotic & love this country but you support a man who has so little understanding of the basic parameters of our constitution's limits & has zero respect for it, except the part he uses to incite violence. A careless small man who asked Russia to spy on our former Secretary of State. A man who trash talks our NATO allies and our president but lavishly praises brutal dictators like Saddam Hussein, Kim Jong Un, Muammar Gaddafi, Vladimir Putin...etc5. You support a small man who has been married three times and has admitted to infidelity in the past. A man who was accused of raping his wife & has a federal lawsuit accusing him of raping a 13-year-old girl during a party hosted by convicted pedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein. A man who comments about his daughters breasts and body. Then you turn around and bring up Bill Clinton's history with women? I agree with you 100% Bill has a disgraceful history with women but no comparison to Trump who has said cringeworthy, disturbing things about women his whole life. May I remind you Bill is NOT running to be the next president. If you are saying oh, candidates spouses are fair game then you can't ignore that he is married to a woman whose naked pictures are all over the internet. 6. You support a man whose business career is a very long list of bankruptcies, defaults and deceptions because he is good for our economy? A man who was born into wealth and built that wealth by scamming, stiffing and bullying ordinary working citizens of this great country. 7. Yes, Hillary is not perfect, then again no one is. You call her dishonest but support a narcissistic pathological liar? Every time Trump opens his mouth every other word that comes out is a lie. Fact checkers have proven it over and over again. We are talking about a man who makes things up to spew hate and fear, like when he lied about seeing an Iran ransom video and a video of muslims celebrating in New Jersey on 9/11. The man is incapable of telling the truth and he is delusional.8. You support a hypocritical man who hired undocumented immigrants for his real estate projects & exploited our visa program. He is a man capable of solving our immigration problem?9. I agree 100% if she's elected Hillary and her whole family must distance themselves from the Clinton foundation. Let other people continue the great work the foundation is doing. With that said, you support a man whose foundation is found guilty of a pay-to-play scam and false claims of giving on its tax forms and then turn around and try to push fabricated scandals about the Clinton foundation. The IRS found the con man used funds from his charitable foundation to make a campaign donation to Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi. Just after 4 days of the bribe payment Pam dropped Trump U case. He also held $150K fundraiser for Pam after she dropped a criminal case against his university. His foundation claimed on its tax return forms that it gave $10,000.00 to The Giving Back Fund, but the organization says that donation does not exist. A man who completely retooled his charity to spend other people‚Äôs money. A man with deep ties to global financiers, foreign politicians and criminals. 10. You claim the con man whose line of clothing and accessories are made in Bangladesh, China, Honduras and other low-wage countries is the man to fix our labor laws? You claim the man who outsources everything is the answer to creating jobs here at home?11. You claim the unfit, unstable Putin's little puppet whose campaign is fully embracing alt-right's anti-Muslim and anti-Immigrant ideologies with all their conspiracy theories is the one to unite the country?12. You support a bottom feeder who put racial discrimination in housing at the heart of his real estate developments, started the birther movement, said "Obama would look perfect on food stamps, he has the right face for it,‚Äù and has shown he is prejudice with his actions & words over and over again. Then he pretends he cares about the black communities. He brings up Hillary's reference to a group of violent repeat criminals as "super-predators" in 1996? I don't agree with her choice of words all those years ago but she has apologized since. Something Trump refuses to do. Of course you can use all kind of deflection tactics & tell yourself whatever makes you feel better but the reality is if you are supporting a racist, misogynistic, xenophobic, bigoted, unfit, unqualified, disgusting con man, you really should admit to yourself you don't care what he says or does. You are using your hatred to cloud your judgement.
7 | Stephanie Marie | 17 | 1561248307228527_1561256183894406 | I'm really tired of the left saying that most Trump supporters are uneducated whites. OK. Does that mean that most Clinton supporters are uneducated minorities? Most Americans don't hold a Bachelor's degree and very few still hold a master's or higher. Does that mean that any of them aren't competent enough to make an informed decision? Shame on you if you think so. By the way, this Trump supporter holds three degrees.
8 | Joseph Dietz | 12 | 1561248307228527_1561252273894797 | The man has showed ten times the energy of Hillary. Campaigning like a real candidate. Not having the paid for media and celebrities doing his heavy lifting like crooked. Wikileaks report on that

11 | Michael Saul | 5 | 1561248307228527_1561313273888697 | Here's the big difference between Hillary rallies and Trump rallies. She brings people who are civilized and willing to make it better peacefully. He brings people who spit, carry signs that disrespect and end up screaming like lunatics. Enough said, so where do you wish to stand for?

15 | Larry Krouse | 2 | 1561248307228527_1561376227215735 | We have two choices tomorrow. We can either vote to keep the same corrupt system, the same stagnant economy, and to continue our decline in standing on the world stage, or we can vote for change and send a message that we've had enough of business as usual, that we are tired of the corruption in Washington, and that We The People have had enough. If you think that this is a good as we can do, then vote for Hillary Clinton. If you think that we can rise to greater heights, greater aspirations, and to better our nation for ourselves and our children, vote for Donald J. Trump. The choice is clear.

It is her destiny. I hope every american will work together base on one meaning which is the meaning of being a human being.

Can we NOT support our candidate without insulting everyone who favors their opponent? This name calling and BS is the reason the whole world is laughing at us. Let's be mature.
3 | Brenda Ray | 7 | 10153847116351916_10153847618506916 | Too bad.  Black people and their Clintons.  I never thought that in this 2016 Presidential general election I would be so disappointed, unenthused and filled with such dismay over the Democratic Nominee and the Democratic Party, including the Obamas. The Democrats have been such a turn off after first witnessing their rigged crap during the entire primary against Bernie Sanders then handing the presumptive nomination to Hillary when she never had the delegates to win. They just gave it to her. As the President stood by and watched and said nothing and did nothing. And now he's all over the place banging cymbals for Hillary.  Rewarding crookedness. And demanding black people do the same.  Not interested. The same status quo, do-nothing-for-the-American-people politicians do not need to be back in the White House. Obama said as much in 2008 about Hillary Clinton. We need change. Not Hillary. I think I will vote for Donald Trump. In fact it's the Democrats who are spreading the fear mongering and division. I think Trump is nothing to fear. I think Hillary Clinton is.

Look, I live outside the US so whoever is president would affect me very little. My perspective has always been opinion of better policy. I have no reason to choose a candidate based on fear and I wouldn't vote using my bible. Honestly, if I used my Bible to vote... Neither Trump or Hillary would be the choice. They both have a lot of negative attributes, cannot be denied... but which one has been there for 30yrs now milking the system but putting very little back into it? I respect your choices, Ive had my fun Hillary bashing... time to get serious now. #VoteTrump . Be safe at the polls, its a place to vote, not a place to fight. Respect each other and let the best candidate win.

God‚Äôs Word says that He personally made each one of us, and has a plan for each life:Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart.‚ÄîJeremiah 1:5Even before I was born, God had chosen me to be His.‚ÄîGalatians 1:15For You created my inmost being; You knit me together in my mother‚Äôs womb‚Ä¶ Your eyes saw my unformed body. All the days ordained for me were written in Your book before one of them came to be.‚ÄîPsalm 139:13, 16Your hands shaped me and made me‚Ä¶ Did You not clothe me with skin and flesh and knit me together with bones and sinews? You gave me life.‚ÄîJob 10:8-12This is what the Lord says‚ÄîHe who made you, who formed you in the womb‚ÄîIsaiah 44:2Did not He who made me in the womb make them? Did not the same One form us both within our mothers?‚ÄîJob 31:15Because man is made in God‚Äôs own image (Genesis 1:27), each life is of great value to God:Children are a gift from God.‚ÄîPsalm 127:3He even calls our children His own:You took your sons and daughters whom you bore to Me and sacrificed them‚Ä¶ You slaughtered My children.‚ÄîEzekiel 16:20,21The Bible says of our Creator,In His hand is the life of every living thing and the breath of every human being‚ÄîJob 12:10God, the giver of life, commands us not to take the life of an innocent person:Do not shed innocent blood.‚ÄîJeremiah 7:6Cursed is the man who accepts a bribe to kill an innocent person‚ÄîDeuteronomy 27:25You shall not murder.‚ÄîExodus 20:13Taking the life of the unborn is clearly murder‚ÄîHe didn‚Äôt kill me in the womb, with my mother as my grave.‚ÄîJeremiah 20:17‚Äîand God vowed to punish those who‚Ä¶ripped open the women with child‚ÄîAmos 1:13The unborn child was granted equal protection in the law; if he lost his life, the one who caused his death must lose his own life:If men who are fighting hit a pregnant woman, and she gives birth prematurely, but there is no serious injury, the offender must be fined ‚Ä¶if there is serious injury, you are to take life for life.‚ÄîExodus 21:22,23Life is a gift created by God, and is not to be taken away by abortion. God is ‚Äúpro-choice,‚Äù but He tells us clearly the only acceptable choice to make:I have set before you life and death, blessings and curses. Now choose life, so that you and your children may live‚ÄîDeuteronomy 30:19

She says he was, and still is her mentor.üëÅ‚ö†Ô∏èIf you are a Veteran, in the Military, or closely related to a Military member, Why are you voting for Hillary when she left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again?

21 | Tammie Lillard | 0 | 10153847116351916_10153847606486916 | With as many Christians, Jews and Muslims in America how is this race even close? Each of our faiths is against abortion. Christian faith says God knew us before we were born and thou shall not kill, Muslim faith states a fetus is a living soul at 4 months and Jewish faith states abortion is forbidden with exception given according to Jewish scholar Rashi In regard to life-risking pregnancies, How is it so many woman are voting for a person that will uphold the practice of late term abortion? I would rather stand with God and be judged by the world than stand with this world and be judged by God.
22 | Patti Pickens | 0 | 10153847116351916_10153848012706916 | I will never sacrafice my belief that it's ok to abort a baby up until the day he/she is supposed to be born. I cannot respect someone who does, no more than I can respect a serial killer, a murderer or child molester. And in my heart, I feel that someday when I meet my maker, I'll have my own sins to account for, and when He asks, why didn't you stand up for my children.... I won't have an answer, will you? Voting for Hillary Clinton is a vote for a murderer of innocents, no matter how you look at it... she's never faultered on her support of late term abortion...right up until the day the baby is to be born.

If you think that this is a good as we can do, then vote for Hillary Clinton. If you think that we can rise to greater heights, greater aspirations, and to better our nation for ourselves and our children, vote for Donald J. Trump. The choice is clear.

If she didn't have the last name of CLINTON she would not be where she is, black vote or not

5 | Richard Burckhardt | 86 | 1345101365586112_1345110725585176 | I'm a senior and cannot believe Trump has a majority senior vote. Jeez, the man supports doing away with Social Security and Medicare just like the rest of the GOP bozos. Sheesh!
6 | Cydney Renee | 78 | 1345101365586112_1345102285586020 | Ha, is the walking cesspool Trump still whining and crying and attempting to steal the vote with nothing more than fear, hate and racism!? What morons, be sure to vote Nov 28 for all you Trump chumps! idiots
7 | Adrian De Loza | 73 | 1345101365586112_1345105345585714 | Poetic justice: the one group Donald Trump offended kicking off his nazi campaign, will be his demise in this election.If you think not having the Latino vote doesn't matter, you're in for a very rude awakening.

And that would be Hillary Clinton. You have another candidate who is a legitimate outsider who hasn't had one thing to do with whatever you think is wrong in America today."                                 -Rush
9 | Dee Keihn | 15 | 1345101365586112_1345116968917885 | The 25 things that are truly important  Hillary instead of this left wing fluff:1. When did she know her husband was a serial abuser, and does she feel guilty for destroying his accusers?2. Explain precisely the trades made in the Cattle Futures scandal where $1,000 was turned into $99,000 in a matter of weeks?3. Why didn't she do anything to protect the Americans in Benghazi?4. Who is Saul Alinsky and why was he her mentor?5. When she was working on Watergate, why did her boss Zeifman, a lifelong Democrat, call Hillary a ‚Äúliar‚Äù and ‚Äúan unethical, dishonest lawyer‚Äù and have her fired?6. What really happened with Travelgate?7. What really happened with the Rose Law Firm?8. What really happened with White Water?9. What gave Hillary the right to see private FBI files of her political enemies in FileGate?10. Why won't she turn over her illegal server with state department e-mails to congress?11. Why does your foundation accept money from avowed terror states?12. What is her take on the Vince Foster "Suicide"?13. Why did she think she was entitled to steal the White House furniture when she left?14. Why do you lie even about things that mean nothing: lying about being under sniper fire in Bosnia, lying about being named after Sir Edmund Hillary, or lying that your grandparents were immigrants.15. Should America be concerned that in ChinaGate, the 22 people that were convicted of fraud or for funneling Asian funds into the DNC were associates of Bill Clinton?16. Did selling stays at the Lincoln Bedroom to political donors make you feel like a wh)o(re?17. Does Hillary think Juanita Broadrick lied when she said on national news that Bill Clinton raped her?18. Is she still okay that Bill goes to pedophile island with Jeff Epstein?19. Why are there so many murdered and suicided people in the Clinton's immediate circle?20. Doesn't the fact that the Clinton Foundation has to amend 5 years of its tax returns for improper reporting imply that you were involved in an illegal RICO enterprise?21. Doesn't approving the Russian-owned Uranium One deal as secretary of state--because of illegal contributions to your foundation--in fact make you a traitor to this country?22. Was it wise to have at least four Clinton Foundation board of directors that have either been convicted or charged of the financial crimes of bribery and fraud?23. Why, Hillary, did you pay your female senate staffers 72% of what you paid your male staffers?24. When you represented an accused pedophile rapist, why did you laugh when you got him off even though you believed him to be guilty?25. She said she had one e-mail address, it came out that she had two; She said she had one device, it came out that she had two: She said none of her e-mails on her private server was classified, but when the State Dept handed over 300 e-mails the FBI redacted large sections of one, proving again she was wrong. Thus, Ms. Clinton, are you incompetent or just a congenital liar?Everyone should go on you tube and watch The Clinton Chronicles -- it will amaze you what a couple of psychopaths the Clintons really are!10 QUESTIONS(1). "When you left the White House after your husband‚Äôs last term as president, why did you steal $200,000.00 worth of furniture, china, and artwork? And why did you tell the public that you ‚Äòreturned it‚Äô when you only brought back $27,000 of it?(2). Mrs. Clinton, when you were Secretary of State, why did you solicit contributions from foreign governments, (muslim princes donated multi-millions and got favors in return) for the Clinton Foundation after you promised President Obama you would not?(3). Mrs. Clinton, why do you and your husband claim to contribute millions of dollars to charity for a tax write off when it goes directly into your Clinton Foundation which only gives out 10% of the funds to charitable purposes and you pocket the balance to support yourself tax free? What does your daughter Chelsea do there for her 3 million dollar yearly salary?(4). Mrs. Clinton, why are you unable to account for 6 billion dollars of State department funds that seem to have disappeared while you were Secretary of State?(5). Mrs. Clinton why did you say you were broke when you left the White House, but purchased a 5 million home, built an addition for the secret service, and charge the tax payers of the United States $15,000.00 a month for their rent, an amount that pays your the entire mortgage?(6). Mrs. Clinton why did you lie to the American people about the terrorist attack in Benghazi, but managed to tell the truth to your daughter that same night it happened?(7). Mrs Clinton were you and your husband disbarred from practicing law? Answer: In 1996, Landmark Legal Foundation filed a complaint asking the court to disbar Hillary Clinton for violating the Arkansas code of conduct, (which requires lawyers to act with honesty and integrity) for her actions in the Whitewater scandal cover up. Hillary‚Äôs law license was suspended in 2002 for failing to complete her continuing legal education requirements. Bill Clinton was convicted by a grand jury for perjury and obstruction of justice to which he was impeached by the House of Representatives and disbarred from practicing as an attorney. He has been accused by a dozens of women for rape, sexual assault and sexual harassment. He settled out of court for $850.000 in one case. Hillary has him out on her campaign trail championing for her theme of feminism and "women's rights". What a blasphemy. Neither one has enough integrity to hold onto a law license.(8). Mrs Clinton, why did you say, ‚ÄúI do not recall,‚Äù ‚ÄúI have no recollection,‚Äù and ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù 56 times while testifying under oath during the Starr investigations.‚Ä¢(9). Mrs Clinton, what Really happened to Ron Brown when he was about to testify against you and your husband?(10). Mrs. Clinton what really happened to law partner Vince Foster? No way he committed suicide.CNBC, NBC, ABC, CBS, CNN, New York Times, Los Angeles Times, I know that the answers to any of these questions don‚Äôt matter to you, you would support her regardless of whether she was guilty of murder, embezzlement, money laundering, and I could go on and on. The Democrat‚Äôs and liberal‚Äôs motto is, ‚ÄúDON‚ÄôT CONFUSE ME WITH THE FACTS ‚Äì MY MIND IS MADE UP.

12 | Faith Paulele | 7 | 1345101365586112_1345104492252466 | #MediaMirror Go ahead just look at yourselves; for over 500 days trying to be a star. All analysis; of extreme, jaw-dropping reality. "I don't know Joe, what do you think?" "DUH!" "I don't know Chuck what do you think?" "Sensational!" "Astonishing!" and the ratings kept rising. You completely forgot you are the News, not a Reality Show. It is not about you, it is about the voter. And how well you (Our #NEWS) are exploring the truths and explaining to #US the honest choices.So what do you do, as you got sucked up in the Trump Vacuum, cause he made you do it, like he made everyone else do it. (Analyze that!) The first thing you do is call him #Trump and her #Hillary. This is not equal, but you made it so. Then you payed all his media bills as you and America waited on the edge of their seats for the next shoe to fall and would lightning #finally strike?You forgot, normally it is the GOP who takes the moral high ground and calls everyone down on the carpet and shames and investigates until they get their OilWhiteMale way. Well this year you forgot, #We ARE the people. With the old guard going down the toilet trying to figure out how to save themselves. There was no lightning to be thrown down. Only a very smart woman; who knew better then to open her mouth, get emotional, be critical, call you dumbbells out.There is so much I want to say, so much that went wrong. But I know how short your attention span is and I do not want to lose you, so I will get right to the Knockout Punch. #Politics is #not a sport, or a game. It is a very difficult learning experience which takes a lifetime sometimes. Your worst mistake this year, and it is a simple example of a HUGE problem, is you Assumed, being the elites that YOU are, that all of America knew, what the #Word misogyny means.
13 | Cherylyn McCollam-Kerley | 16 | 1345101365586112_1345128712250044 | Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton were walking down the street when they came to a homeless person. Trump gave the homeless person his business card and told him to come to his office for a job. He then took $20 out of his pocket and gave it to the homeless person. Hillary was very impressed, so when they came to another homeless person, she decided to help. She walked over to the homeless person and gave him directions to the welfare office. She then reached into Trump‚Äôs pocket and got out $20. She kept $15 for her administrative fees and gave the homeless person $5.00. Now, do you understand the difference between a Conservative and a Liberal progressive?

Trump is trying to pick off Michigan, and Pennsylvania, but those states have an unbelievably more favorable electorate then North Carolina and Florida (which she is up in) and Trump is still focused on appealing to the fringe instead of reaching out to the moderates as candidates usually do at this point.
15 | Susanna Lacayo | 10 | 1345101365586112_1345148678914714 | I'm sick of the media continue to push the false narrative of HRC being dishonest when studies proved she is the most honest politician out there and when Trump lies at least once every five minutes! Media needs to report factual news not the BS that the GOP put out there 30 years ago!!!! Endless investigations of her finding nothing proves this time and time again!!!
16 | Sam Arnold | 16 | 1345101365586112_1345103022252613 | Need to watch New Hampshire closely because if Mrs. Clinton loses there.  It is going to be a long night for Democrats because chances are great she will lose PA, MI, and Wisconsin.
17 | Deborah West | 2 | 1345101365586112_1159745627437561 | Man this page is full of whiners boo hoo we aren't buying what the gop has been selling anymore 8 long years of obstruction we're done.
18 | Trevor Lance Slay | 2 | 1345101365586112_1159569414121849 | I'm no longer believing any map, poll, or survey from any biased news corporation whether it be CNN, NBC, or FOX all of em are inaccurate we will know the truth tomorrow.
19 | Eddie Bruhn | 1 | 1345101365586112_1345196875576561 | Hummmmm, that's funny cause I seen 3 different polls and all had the same thing and all was different than yours. I commented on there and I'll paste the comment to yours. It's a shame that the people's vote doesn't matter. You know what. I'm a republican. But if Hillary would win the popular vote I'd except it 100% and no questions asked. But there is this bull crap electoral that controls it all. 9 states on this map for dems. 19 states for Rep. 6 for lean GOP3 toss ups. Enough said. Fix it to where it is the popular vote so Americans CAN have a voice. That's what matters not this bullcrap electorialBy the way, please voteTrump2016

We have the RIGHT & RESPONSIBILITY to impeach any official of the executive or judicial branch of our government. We need to start a petition calling for the impeachment of any government official recieving funds from ANY major corporations. Then we need to make it illegal for any future political officials to accept any kind of money from anyone accept their paycheck. If they do they should immediately impeached with no severance pay. It should be illegal to engage in any form of bullying during campaigning. The issues of the country and world need to be discussed, not swept under a rug while the candidates spend an hour calling each other names. There should be term limits with equal amounts of officials from each political party in the country being represented. There needs to be laws for more transparency in the government. We the people have the RIGHT to know what our government is doing!!!To our military and police, when the revolution begins you need to lay down your weapons and join us! It is your responsibility as an American citizen to fight corruption and injustice. Do your duty.
21 | Catherine Julie Durm | 0 | 1345101365586112_1159758960769561 | She gave money to Iran to fund terrorism and build a bomb.  She gave OUR uranium to Russia to build a bomb.  She arranged for her brother to get gold mining contracts in Haiti (when none had been issued 50 years prior) - screwing the Haitians out of 1/2 the royalties (while they STILL suffer from the ravages of an earthquake).  She tolerates Christian genocide - the buying, selling and gang raping of Christian women in the middle east - and takes $12 million dollars from The King of the Poor - the Moroccan king who lives a life of luxury while his people suffer.  She would sell us out in a heart beat!

It's so true when Toqueville said that in a democracy the people get the government they deserve. One is a populist that appeals to the lowest common denominator in human nature and the other thinks she deserves the job, that she is bigger than the Presidency, and is doing us all favor by running. Raise your hand if you really can't stand either of them.

If you elect this woman I will not wonder how you all can be so blind...Rather I will come to the conclusion that Americans are just plain dumb! The woman is evil to her core!
24 | Patricia McCullough | 4 | 1345101365586112_1345164742246441 | I LOVE,LOVE, LOVE Trumpanzees whining & repeating the RWNJ talking points, hoping to make a point. They have backed a bigoted, hateful, ignorant fool and will be left with nothing but stupid red hats....which they had to buy! Geez....
25 | Tammy Buchanan | 1 | 1345101365586112_1160006737411450 | Thank God....if Trump gets elected. ..America is going to be in big trouble.   His line is ...Make America Great Again...I didn't know we weren't doing great.  ????? Anyway my vote will cancel out any Trump votes...even if Clinton doesn't win...I did my part.
