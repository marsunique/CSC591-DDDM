"With the mainstream media, I don't think the election's fair, and I think you do see voter fraud out there." 

Eric Trump reacted to his father's comment that with regards to accepting the election results, Donald J. Trump said he "will look at it at the time."

1 | Chelsea Smith | 10154713775471336_10154713953556336 | Why didn't Hillary even address her party making trouble at Trump rallies? She didn't even address it. And the media of course is not mentioning that she glossed over it but if Trump had done the same it would be broadcasted till the election.
2 | Connie Davenport Leagon | 10154713775471336_10154713953486336 | He did not say he would not accept them! He said he would wait and see. Considering all the voter fraud I have been reading about recently not to mention Democrat operatives on tape talking about is illegal activity going back fifty years, that is probably not a bad idea.
3 | Karen Murphy | 10154713775471336_10154713955456336 | Hillary said she wanted more gun control right and regulations to protect toddlers and then a few minutes later condoned butchering a full-term baby in the mother's womb. She is evil to the core.
4 | James G. Fulks | 10154713775471336_10154713956411336 | True definition of "THE FIX IS IN" or voter tampering: News media or other group acting in concert to obfuscate the truth to bring about a controlled condition so as to be able to manipulate the end result.
5 | Joseph J Martin | 10154713775471336_10154713951601336 | She avoided a lot of the questions by answering with something that sounds smart but doesn't actually answer the question.  30 years of experience and some people still buy her bs. She could cook a live puppy in boiling water and some people would still come back with "oh, well Donald Trump is racist etc.
6 | Donnie Edmonds | 10154713775471336_10154713953096336 | Just a couple or points. The media is trying to make hay out of Trumps refusal to say whether or not he would except the results of the election, and how big the hill is that Trump has to climb to win this election. Where were they when Al Gore contested the results of the 2000 election. Secondly I would t trust the poles. The Brexit vote was down by 10 points against on the day of the vote. We all know how that turned out. The 1948 election had Republican nominee Dewey ahead and projected as winning the election. Truman ended up being the president. So much for the pollsMy point. Pay no attention to the media, and Get out and vote. It ain't over till it's over.
7 | Ryan Stallins | 10154713775471336_10154713951096336 | The system/ government has failed americans. Its time for the military to take control of the white house. We need a complete change.
8 | Rodney Liptak | 10154713775471336_10154713957376336 | Yes even Fox News is getting on my nerves! Kelly is in the tank for Hillary, she can't stop talking about Trump and these women accusers.
9 | Diane Edge | 10154713775471336_10154713956736336 | Leave it to the media to pick up on one of the insignificant answers tonight to ignore the ones HRC didn't bother to answer ‚Ä¶ or to question the irony of her answers.
10 | Debbie Hayes Mooney | 10154713775471336_10154713962816336 | Trump Won hands down. ...Why should he say he accepts the out come of the election when 16 Republican Candidates took the pledge and to honor the last man standing but there was plenty that wouldn't honor that so I think he has the right to be on the look out for more back stabbing from both sides
11 | Ashlie Friis | 10154713775471336_10154713959761336 | I PRAY that Trump doesn't accept a rigged or stolen election!IF Hillary is able to win fairly (which is doubtful) then so be it, but I personally want to KNOW this election is FAIR!NO MORE GOVERNMENT SPONSORED CORRUPTION ACCEPTABLE!!!
12 | Anthony Johnston | 10154713775471336_10154713974686336 | The Democrats are all freaking out over Trump saying that he will not accept the results of a rigged and corrupt election system. The people should question it when there is proof coming out everyday over voter fraud. They are acting like this is the first time in history that this has ever happened. Where was their outrage during the Gore vs Bush election? Gore would not concede for weeks. It's completely a double standard.
13 | Chesley Horace Foster Jr. | 10154713775471336_10154713982646336 | Trump won the debate. The media is blowing up over saying the would not answer right now to accept the result of the election. All BS. He is talking about voter fraud which Obama and Clinton is totally involved in.
14 | Tim Langley | 10154713775471336_10154713971306336 | Donald? You should have looked over at a Hillary and said, it's Halloween. Those 250,000 dead souls in the cemetery that are voting in the election, want their name back so they can Rest In Peace!!!
15 | Jack Howell | 10154713775471336_10154713966881336 | Christians think about this. Moses was raised in the house of Pharoah. Pharoah was the enemy of God's people. Moses was like a billionaire of his time. He was not raised in the laws or teachings of God. The people of God would not have chosen him to be the one to free them from bondage. Yet God chose him. Even though he did not know God. Even though he was guilty of many sins including murder. God used this man to lead his people from corruption and slavery. So maybe we should not be so quick to judge. God knows what is best. This TRUMPet may be being used by God to awaken his people to the attack of the devil. I myself am much more alarmed about what has been proven that Hillary has done than I am about what has been alleged that Trump has done. Before you believe the media that seems to be obviously trying to influence you, Pray to God alone and search your heart and ask God to show you the Truth. Knock and the door shall be opened, seek and you shall find. Moses lead God's people through the Red Sea to escape slavery from a corrupt government 6,000 years ago. Now a Red Sea of voters will elect Trump to free God's people once again from a corrupt government.üôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèªüá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏Wear red on 11/8/2016 VOTE Donald J. Trump
16 | Daniel Zanderman | 10154713775471336_10154713967041336 | Donald Trump is a whiny baby. The election is not rigged and has been proven not to be. I guess if you were to win, not going to happen, but then it wasn't rigged. Go away and take your family with you
17 | Tad T Mekonnen | 10154713775471336_10154713959091336 | She is too smart to go against a man with 0 intelligence. I feel so bad that she has to play in the same ballpark as him and people are actually following him. I'm with her.
18 | Jeff Anglin | 10154713775471336_10154713980816336 | I love listening to eric trump.To say you accept something before you have seen the results  and circumstances is just dumb. That like voting on a bill before you know whats in it.
19 | Mark Bain | 10154713775471336_10154713975021336 | We see over 100% voter participation in some democratic counties yet there's never an investigation. Dead people voting  DNC campaign buses shipping people around to different voting  sites. Yep no voting fraud here
20 | Richard Colacino | 10154713775471336_10154713977531336 | That was a bad answer by Trump....he has no choice but to accept the results even if this is rigged. There is no remedy to what is about to happen. The fix is clearly in and unless he has activated 10 million voters who never vote, we know how this will play out. Is there a wave or not...
21 | Werner Salinas | 10154713775471336_10154713963246336 | Trump is like the old uncle who only comes over during Holidays and sits at the end of the table, and rambles on about how life used to be. Oh, and he's nuts!
22 | Bill Heckathorn | 10154713775471336_10154713970496336 | Obama just cemented his legacy he is nothing more than a thug who was the head organizer of all the violence at Donald Trump rallies. It is utterly disgusting that a president of the United States would be involved with a man who organized violence at a presidential campaign rally. It is not only wrong but it is unlawful to incite violence at a peaceful campaign rally. To think that the president of the United States of America had a hand in inciting this violence is totally disgusting and should be investigated by a special prosecution team. This is not communist Russia this is by God the United States of America ,America wake up! This is a disgrace this man is not my president!
23 | Sandy Palumbo | 10154713775471336_10154713967781336 | Hillary.....you going to make jobs for medical staff that performs third trimester abortions? Third trimester abortions are murder. You will have a hard time finding RNs and MDs to do this heinous act. If the child is ill and threatening the life of the mother, the fetus can be delivered by C Section with dignity, respect and humanely. The child can also be baptized in the faith of the parents.Instead, Hillary wants the fetus ripped apart in incredible pain. Hillary....you are a malignant, evil, hateful sick woman. Go to Hell with your sick ideas. Sandy Palumbo, RNTRUMP 2016
24 | Scott Brooklyn Petruccelli | 10154713775471336_10154713983341336 | The moderator tried to be too fair...and didn't hit Hillary with the all those wikileak scandal questions....that's how OJ WON this murder case....CNN wasn't fair at all attacking Trump on things that weren't true in the first 2 debates..but here they had hard facts against Hillary and never brought them up.....trying to be too fair is the enemy of justice...the news didn't make her accountable...and neither did the moderator
25 | Tim Berry | 10154713775471336_10154713974606336 | Most important:  So here's the REAL story. Amb. Stevens was sent to Benghazi post haste in order to retrieve US made Stinger missiles supplied to Ansar al Sharia without Congressional oversight or permission. Hillary brokered the deal through Stevens and a private arms dealer named Marc Turi. Then some of the shoulder fired missiles ended up in Afghanistan used against our own military. It was July 25th, 2012 when a Chinook helicopter was taken down by one of our own Stingers, but the idiot Taliban didn't arm the missile and the Chinook didn't explode, but had to land anyway. An ordnance team recovered the serial number off the missile which led back to a cache of Stingers being kept in Qatar by the CIA. Obama and Hillary were now in full panic mode and Stevens was sent in to retrieve the rest of the Stingers. This was a "do-or-die" mission, which explains the stand down orders given to multiple commando teams. It was the State Dept, not the CIA that supplied them to our sworn enemies, because Petraeus wouldn't supply these deadly weapons due to their potential use on commercial aircraft. Then, Obama threw Gen. Petraeus under the bus after he refused to testify that he OK'd the BS talking points about a spontaneous uprising due to a Youtube video. Obama and Hillary committed treason...and THIS is what the investigation is all about, why she had a private server, (in order to delete the digital evidence), and why Obama, two weeks after the attack, told the UN that the attack was because of a Youtube video, even though everyone knew it was not. Further...the Taliban knew that this administration aided and abetted the enemy without Congressional approval when Boehner created the Select Cmte, and the Taliban began pushing the Obama Administration for the release of 5 Taliban Generals. Bowe Bergdahl was just a pawn...everyone KNEW he was a traitor. So we have a traitor as POTUS that is not only corrupt, but compromised...and a woman that is a serial liar, perjured herself multiple times at the Hearing whom is running for POTUS. Only the Dems, with their hands out, palms up, will support her. Perhaps this is why no military aircraft was called in...because the administration knew our enemies had Stingers.Copied and pasted...and pasted again and again and again until everyone reads this truth.... share

"When I started this campaign, I started it very strongly. It's called 'Make America Great Again.' We're going to make America great. We have a depleted military, it has to be helped ... we have the greatest people on earth in our military." 

Donald J. Trump gave a final statement to the American people in the final presidential debate. http://bit.ly/2e2Nygi
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Christopher Larocque | 10154713725651336_10154713871161336 | Hillary was asked about Bill Clinton's prior allegations of rape and sexual misconduct about him and completely deflected, avoided the question and utilized the time to bash Trump for the allegations against him. A little sad that she has to use the allegations against Trump in an effort to win votes, yet she can't speak about the one's against her own husband and how she treated those women who spoke out against him. But she's all for the fair and equal treatment of women, right?
2 | Chad Myrick | 10154713725651336_10154713872736336 | Trump has his faults...but the Bible is full of stories of God using deeply flawed people for His purpose. Hillary and the Democrats are just so diametrically opposed to Biblical principles on major issues, I honestly don't see how anyone could support her in good conscious. I will concede that she is the candidate of choice for atheists, agnostics, Wiccans, Scientologists and Satanists. Hands down. Anyone else...you've lost your ever loving mind if you're "With Her." I'm honestly just sick of the "Trump said this" or the "Hillary has no energy" stuff...it's all clutter. I hate the clutter and the inconsequential garbage perpetuated by the media. They distract people and it's giving us bad leaders who, in turn, give us bad policies. Even on Fox News...first thing that's the "take away" from the talking heads is that ohhhhhh Trump won't accept the election outcome. Huh? That's about number 325 on my take aways from the debate...I didn't even give it a second thought. Honestly, why are they acting like that was something just never heard of in American politics. The Dems fought tooth and nail in 2000 in the courts after Bush was declared president. Silly. And with all of the voter fraud evidence out there...anyone with a brain would question the validity of the system as it is...esp since the Dems think it's "disenfranchising" to show an actual photo ID to vote...gee, I wonder why. I think we all know why. Anyway, Hillary is ahead in the polls right now...and as sad as that is, I've always said that after 2012 I will never again underestimate the stupidity of the American voters. But the race is close...it comes down to those "battleground" states...and whether the silent majority shows up for Trump in numbers great enough to counter all of the dead and/or illegal voters that show up for Hillary.
3 | Vitor Oliveira | 10154713725651336_10154713875311336 | Hillary wants no children to be hurt like that poor little one out there in Syria, that's the reason she wants all of them killed before birth!#KillaryForJail2016!
4 | Bob Jack Christiansen | 10154713725651336_10154713874496336 | This Christian is voting for TRUMP, I live in California and all my neighbors and friends are voting for TRUMP...We are tired of the lies and corruption of career politicians!!!!
5 | Joyce Cody | 10154713725651336_10154713878306336 | Why is Fox News being so biased toward Mr. Trump? You know what a liar Hillary Clinton is, and you're sitting there defending her!
6 | Sharon Theobald Hess | 10154713725651336_10154713878181336 | Why do you suppose Trump said he wouldn't accept the vote if he lost? There have been many that have had recounts because they felt the count was wrong. Now there have been rumors that there was a whole town without a republican vote in previous years. I am one that admires Trump for telling the truth because he may ask for a recount and then everyone/media would say he lied so might as well tell his true feelings. I think this is very minor compared to all our problems.
7 | Vickie Colyer | 10154713725651336_10154713877886336 | There are many voters refusing to admit they are voting Trump, not because they are ashamed but because they refuse to take polls and refuse to give main stream media any information LOL
8 | Aaron Ahrens | 10154713725651336_10154713884791336 | Trump has done more to expose Hillary and the Dems than any Republican in recent memory. Yet, Fox is no better than the other news outlets about bashing him. Seems to me that they are want the country to burn just like the rest of them. I'm pretty disappointed in your "fair and balanced" philosophy. Its pretty disgraceful really.
9 | Barbara Bain | 10154713725651336_10154713881576336 | I liked Trumps final statement and with the people he chooses for his cabinet ... I believe he can make America Great once again . If not I really fear for my children and grandchildren .
10 | James Dotson | 10154713725651336_10154713885891336 | Trump did great but; now Megan Kelly bashing him and sounding like CNN . Hillary was over prepared and had all her little talking point;'s all lined up.You could actually see her looking down at her note's as she talked.I am so sick of the media.
11 | Patricia Carey Bergelin | 10154713725651336_10154713881761336 | And you were made to hold your hand up & take a pledge..was criticized for it..and yet the others did not honor it..and now they want you to agree to accept outcome...media is corrupt..don't believe polls...they are running scared that the people want Trump
12 | Cindy Koshinsky | 10154713725651336_10154713887716336 | Hillary was asked what she has done in the last 30 years of government office.. I heard her talking and saw her mouth moving, but she said NOTHING at all with substance. The answers were vague, and had no substance. She seemed to just talk and talk, but never really answered the question. It is based on this that I won't vote for her. She has done NOTHING for us as Americans.. and will continue to do absolutely nothing.
13 | Jeremy Yost | 10154713725651336_10154713882596336 | Hillary said Illegal Aliens pay more in income tax then Trump. Which in those cases mean they are using someone elses SSN, which now means the Illegal has committed 2 crimes.
14 | Peggy Slagle | 10154713725651336_10154713881791336 | Trump answer to "accepting results" is not a debate win or lose factor, and Fox anchors and contributors have blown this out of proportion trying to say Trump stepped in it with his answer.
15 | Mary J Thompson | 10154713725651336_10154713891866336 | As for making a final statement which was supposed to be not known... Hilliary was totally memorized, at one point lost her place, and then started again......Hilliary was playing on my last nerve... She vomits words and says nothing but dribble and lies..........DONALD TRUMP 2016
16 | Tania Kicak Lafave | 10154713725651336_10154713911356336 | One thing I have to say, I'm so angry with the reporters right now on Fox news!!!!!!!! You idiots! You are hooked on him saying that he would think about accepting the outcome of the election????? REALLY? Get over it! Who the heck cares? Donald Trump did a great job! I as a voter am more concern about the state of our nation than I am about him not accepting the outcome or even questioning it! Way to go fox reporters! Are you all voting for Clinton? You sure sound like it! You are sounding like the liberal media! If I was him I would question it too! There has been so much corruption in this election it's frightening and yet you all are saying he's basically doomed because of him refusing to accept the outcome! You reporters have no idea what you are talking about! I'm frightened about Hillary becoming president!
17 | Debra Graham | 10154713725651336_10154713884121336 | she skirted most all of the questions....never really answering too many of them...only trying to get jabs in at Trump....not changing my vote...Trump Pence 2016
18 | Frank Linford | 10154713725651336_10154713912491336 | You know people,,,we are all very flawed. Sometime we act and talk in such a way that dishonors who we are...But we can all change and make a difference to people. I believe with all my heart and flaws that the Lord has given us Donald Trump.. I believe that he will fight every single day for us. You know last election 25 million Christians did not vote for one reason or another....Obama won by 3.7 million....Lets not let this happen again. All of us go vote, take car loads of Trump supporters to vote...We can do this, lets show the media who is going all out to keep us home, that We the People will vote, period.
19 | Patrick Perry | 10154713725651336_10154713885581336 | If it wasn't t Trump not promising to honor the election results, the liberal media would find another negative about Trump to put on the headlines! People aren t falling for it anymore and a good majority of people think there in mass voter fraud!
20 | Dorothy House | 10154713725651336_10154713893361336 | Does anyone remember, when her husband was president, he practically dismantled the military, she's far worse, she ( Clinton) has no respect for the military, she's scary
21 | Aaron Thiel | 10154713725651336_10154713873016336 | Hillary turned into a stuttering mess that couldn't control the volume of her voice. Could you imagine her negotiating with a hostile Putin with WWIII hanging in the balance? Hillary is in over her head and she knows it. This isn't the peaceful world her husband seen during his presidency and it scares the crap out of her.
22 | Ck Martin | 10154713725651336_10154713885046336 | she totally blew off the pay for play question, totally blew off the fact that dnc employees were responsible for inciting riots, blew off the disaster they left in other countries with their foundation's help, etc.
23 | Clara Espinoza | 10154713725651336_10154713883326336 | She said she wanted gun control to protect a little baby toddler for their life and then another breath she says that abortion should be done up to nine months till the baby is born I don't understand her she makes me sick to my stomach when she liar liar your pants suit from China on fire
24 | Matt Dragovits | 10154713725651336_10154713882121336 | If I have to listen to Megyn Kelly whine and nag any more on your network, I think my head will explode. She has become a badgering pain in the butt to watch. Wasting time following the third, and most important debate, by moaning that Trump said he wouldn't be attracted to an unattractive woman is just pathetic. Move on already... or I'm turning the channel.
25 | Linda Dundee | 10154713725651336_10154713885926336 | Megan Kelly you should be ashamed of yourself for badgering one of trumps managers. Tonight about those women that supposedly he has  salted. You just wouldn't let it go. You've held a grudge because when you do in the primaries and you got into a tiff with him. It sounded like a CNN reporter. Shame on you I liked you until tonight and that is it your over for me girlfriend  And yes we don't want Hillary Clinton and her husband as the first man in the White House having sex with all the different women in there. And Hilary thinks it's fine and lives with a man like that she should be barred from the White House and him too he was in Peach people don't you remember?

--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Otto Wulff | 10154713809701336_10154713817376336 | Have you noticed when anything is brought up to Hillary that she can't lie her way out of it she laughs waits a few seconds and changes subject.
2 | John Mckinley | 10154713809701336_10154713812831336 | Trump wins! People around the world are waking up and revolting to the global agenda and radical Muslim invasion. Clinton is the most corrupt presidential candidate in living memory. Not to mention she bullied and insulted her husband's alleged rape and sexual assault victims. Obamacare is set to implode in 2017. So if you're a complete idiot then go and vote for Clinton and your godless agenda. You can put Clinton and Kaine in their own basket of deplorable's. 90% of DEMOCRATS, are burning flags, shooting cops, sitting down during the national anthem, rioting, and blocking traffic, not to mention the architects of the affordable care act that is due to implode in 2017, adding 10 trillion to the deficit, lest we forget giving the Iranians 1.3 billion dollars in cash in one of the worst deals in recorded history....But Republicans are the problem. All the media wants to cover is that Trump made some locker room banter 11 years ago. GO FIGURE!Trump
3 | Tina Guerriero | 10154713809701336_10154713816601336 | at one point I thought killary was going to have a stroke trying to yell above trump when she clearly went over her time again trying to run the debate. chris did a better job than the last 2 commentators.
4 | Cheryl Panik Kerr | 10154713809701336_10154713820061336 | Trump definately won this debate!  Meghan Kelly should go work for CNN though. She just tries her hardest to bring Trump down. Many Fox watchers turn the channel now when she is on.
5 | Justin Tuttle | 10154713809701336_10154713816186336 | Donald Trump absolutely won the debate, he wasn't as aggressive as last debate & should have pushed Clinton on more issues. He was still cool & calm & right on many issues he did mention.
6 | Rhonda Andrews | 10154713809701336_10154713820011336 | Trump definitely won. Wish Megan Kelly would move to CNN. She keeps pushing the issues with women and how Mr. Trump does not have women's votes. I am a female and I am definitely voting for Mr. Trump!!!
7 | Aine-Annie Hodkinson | 10154713809701336_10154713817831336 | Donald Trump is for equal rights for all women;born and unborn... Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness whereas Hillary Clinton has said that partial birth abortion is ok and that the unborn do not have constitutional rights because they are not persons. The human heart begins beating at 28 days prenatal and does not stop until the day we die.
8 | Mary Pabiona Evans | 10154713809701336_10154713814586336 | Hillary cannot fool the American people, no matter how much she memorized her line, in fact it is obvious that she is making thing up, unless you do not know the fact, she could have fooled me, but I know the truth. She try to confused the American people with who hack the DNC website and blaming Russia, but people could careless who hack them, what is important is thee content and it shows this people are a bunch of crooks, that this election is rigged, that Hillary's campaign is corrupt and did some illegal voting activities and they got caught. Hillary will NOT lead this country, she do not deserve good American votes.
9 | Richard Holcomb | 10154713809701336_10154713816181336 | Megyn Kelly go back to your motel room in Vegas pull the covers up and put two pillows over your head the world will be a better place
10 | Wanda McLamb Collins | 10154713809701336_10154713822181336 | Would be watching FOX News but Megan Kelley does NOT belong on your channel.... she is obviously biased and is an angry woman. It's showing.
11 | Janell Hemsley | 10154713809701336_10154713835681336 | I don't know if he won, however, he showed she supports killing fetus who are live and living beings. As an NICU nurse I cared for babies at 23 weeks. These are people. She supports killing babies.I was undecided until tonight. Hillary will NOT get my vote!
12 | Andrea Pilgrim Whittington | 10154713809701336_10154713832171336 | What's wrong with Megyn Kelly???? She really hates Trump. All she wants to do is bring up the women and his comment on if he'll accept the election results. Hannity did his show about the voter fraud last night. Dead people are registered to vote!!!
13 | Santigie Lawrence Sesay | 10154713809701336_10154713815511336 | The candidate representing the 'moral' party just called his opponent  "a nasty woman". Make America 'rude' again. And he ' RESPECTS' woman.
14 | Dori Griffith Blades | 10154713809701336_10154713821476336 | Well, she was cheating again!  If you go back and watch when the camera panned over, you could see the TelePrompter on her podium lit up!  Also, she was using signals across her chin and cheek again!So once again, she cheated and got help again!!I will not change my mind!  I'm angry!
15 | Andrea Mesich | 10154713809701336_10154713825606336 | What's really sad, is that Clinton and her supporters want you to believe that... If Russia was behind the hacks... If they were... That telling the American people the truth, and showing them how corrupt the clintons really are is espionage... But, it's perfectly acceptable for the Clinton's to have lied to the American people all these years. Again they do not deny the content of those emails which are shocking, should be Criminal, I mean people on their payroll actually hiring people to go to Trump rallies and start violence that could have gotten somebody killed? I mean they do not even deny it... They're just mad that it got out to the American people. But the really sad thing is, there are so many Americans who don't care. These people are going to start World War 3 and people are more interested in the fact that Trump said he's not going to necessarily accept the election results until the day of to make sure there's no voter fraud... which undercover video and leaked emails have proven there already is. People on the Clinton payroll are registering dead people as Democrats for crying out loud... so forgive Trump for not exactly saying he's going to trust it right off the bat.
16 | Andrew James Sanchez | 10154713809701336_10154713825636336 | Don't know what they were getting at when Trump was asked about accepting results of election. I remember Gore not accepting the results, and Kerry not accepting the results when they lost. So...I guess what goes around comes around! However, Trump will win so big it is not going to be close, unless Soros programs his voting machines for Clinton!
17 | Don Didio | 10154713809701336_10154713823596336 | When will Fox send Megyn Kelly over to MSNBC where she belongs? Her constant badgering on Trump to validate her claims that he's a sexist is Very old. I love FoxNews but I refuse to watch when that woman is on.
18 | Andrea Mesich | 10154713809701336_10154713830801336 | Hillary is for allowing someone to kill a baby the day is supposed to be born... People on her payroll has been proven to be registering dead people as Democrats... It has been proven on video and in leaked emails the people on her payroll hired people to protest against Trump and told them to become violent which could have gotten somebody killed... There are so many leaked emails that are Criminal... And yet all the media wants to do is talk about how Trump refuses to say he won't accept their election results right now... I mean come on... they are registering dead people and look what they did to Bernie Sanders... can you blame the guy?
19 | Jim Dunn | 10154713809701336_10154713820511336 | Finally A fair moderator which equals a Trump win. He would have won by a larger margin if Crooked Hillary would have actually answered the questions asked to her.
20 | Dave Presutti | 10154713809701336_10154713836506336 | Fox News has the worse post debate analysis I've ever seen. Megyn Kelly is horrible! Brit Hume is negative. Dana Perino is her usual insufferable self. Bret Baier is a wuss! Juan Williams is a dope. Had to turn it off.
21 | Rose Elizabeth-Leigh Williams | 10154713809701336_10154713838146336 | Megyn Kelly is the all-round biggest Pinhead on Fox News. Trump gave the right answer about the election results. Are you kidding me? On the day that all this video is reviewed after several days of this coming into the light about voter fraud. They say they've been doing this for 50 years? And he supposed to just smile and say oh yeah sure no problem? This is why he's going to win because nobody forces him to be politically correct and smile for the cameras and not Rock the Boat. He's going to win by a landslide so it isn't going to be a problem for him to accept because so many Americans are going to offset the scheming voter fraud it isn't going to matter. Get over yourself Megyn Kelly. You are no Barbara Walters.
22 | Gisella Mortelliti | 10154713809701336_10154713856411336 | I think Trump is a real fighter. He hates to lose! What's wrong with that? Don't we want someone like that to lead us and want to actually win? And he is right in defending himself against the liberal media. It is our media that now elects our presidents, not the people.
23 | Ziaul Hashem | 10154713809701336_10154713817051336 | I haven't heard anything new from Mr. Trump which can change my decision. I was going round and round with same statements we have hard 100times...some of them were totally made up anyway...and facts checked before. Trump was boring!
24 | Tony Sarrio | 10154713809701336_10154713840226336 | We were laughing so hard when Bret and Megyn were reading headlines from all of the mainstream media . Of course they are going to find anything possible to bash Trump. I got news for you two shills. The American people do not see things your way. We know what you are doing.99.9% of the comments are against you. Your reporting lies has no merit. People are not buying it.
25 | Joe McMullins | 10154713809701336_10154713847251336 | Eric tell you Dad to remind the people in his rally's about Hillary's early years.                                                                                            I just saw this post, I encourage people to read.                                                How quickly we forget! If you‚Äôre over 35, take a walk with me down memory lane‚Äîyou won‚Äôt believe what you have forgotten. If you‚Äôre under 35, read on‚ÄîI promise you that you will be amazed at what you missed! (By the way, sadly, this isn‚Äôt a joke. I wish it was.)REMEMBER WHEN BILL CLINTON WAS PRESIDENT?(January 20, 1993 to January 20, 2001‚Äîtwo terms)When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over an attempt to reform health care. Her proposed plan was so bad that many Democrats came up with competing plans of their own in protest, and in spite of threats and intimidation, on September 26, 1994, the ‚ÄúHillarycare‚Äù bill was declared dead.This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million for studies, promotion, and other efforts.Then, President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general. Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood‚Äîboth were forced to withdraw their names from consideration. Next, she chose Janet Reno, which husband Bill described as "my worst mistake." (Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.)Husband Bill also allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission‚ÄîLani Guanier was her selection. After considerable backlash from prominent Democratic senators concerning Ms. Guanier's radical views, Bill Clinton withdrew her name from nomination, stating that she did not represents the civil rights views that he had championed during his campaign.However, apparently a slow learner, husband Bill continued to allow Hillary to make more recommendations. She chose former law partners, Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department. Her selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kennedy was forced to resign. (Is anyone wondering yet what her Supreme Court Justice appointments would be like?)Many younger voters will have no knowledge of "Travelgate," the first major ethics controversy during Bill‚Äôs presidency.Hillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend, Harry Thompson‚Äîbut the White House Travel Office refused to comply. She trumped up allegations of financial mismanagement and reported seven long-time White House employees to the FBI. This ruined their reputations, got them fired, and caused a thirty-six month investigation. Eventually, most of the employees were reinstated and Clinton associates were forced out of the travel office. Only one White House employee, Billy Dale, was charged with a crime‚Äîthe enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds; a jury acquitted him in less than two hours.Still not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House Security. When Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies (Filegate) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff, suddenly Hillary and the President denied even knowing Livingstone, and of course, denied knowledge of drug use in the White House.Following this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents.Next, when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by Bill Clinton, Hillary was put in charge of the "bimbo eruption" and scandal defense. Let‚Äôs look at some of her more notable decisions in this regard . . . She urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation, they settled with Ms. Jones. She refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor. After $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr's investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs. Hillary's devious game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for 'lying under oath' to a grand jury, followed by his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives. Hillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, "I do not recall," "I have no recollection," and "I don't know" a total of 56 times while under oath. (Sound familiar?) After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had "mistakenly thought was hers."So you see, the email scandal and all of her malfeasance regarding the handling of Top Secret information, not to mention the "pay to play" schemes of the Clinton Foundation, are nothing new. Hillary‚Äôs entire political career has been nothing but a web of lies, corruption and destruction in her quest for power.

"I'm reaching out to all Americans: Democrats, Republicans and independents, because we need everybody to help make our country what it should be." 

Hillary Clinton made a statement at the end of the final debate, adding she "knows the awesome responsibility of protecting our country."
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Ken Boonie | 10154713753771336_10154713779986336 | Hillary said Trump's buildings were constructed with steel from China. He should have asked her where her pantsuit came from.
2 | Jason Edge | 10154713753771336_10154713777531336 | Did anyone else catch Hillary's statement about what Trump said. She said "first when I hear Donald talk like that and know that his slogan is make America great again I wonder when he thought America was great". So basically I take it as she is saying America is not great nor ever was.
3 | Peri Nope | 10154713753771336_10154713778276336 | Meghan Kelly should go work for Hillary since she loves her so much....
4 | Skull Tierra | 10154713753771336_10154713779251336 | Why did she just tell the entire world how long it takes for us to launch a nuke?? Shouldn't that be "top secret classified???" She just proved herself to the nation, that she gives classified material.
5 | Kathy Dierking | 10154713753771336_10154713779811336 | Listening to Megyn and Brett. Megyn needs to quit going after Trump and the women. She can't get past it and talk about policies! She has a major problem!
6 | Kiersten B Coats | 10154713753771336_10154713782181336 | Reaching out to all Americans??? So that's why she insulted Trump supporters calling us Deplorables, irredeemable? Oh please lady! First she insults us, lies to us then expects us to believe she's reaching out to all of us?? The only thing she knows about protecting our country is silence!! She blames everyone else but herself. What a load of horse crap!
7 | John Taylor | 10154713753771336_10154713777016336 | Hillary said "I'm appalled" ....ironc coming from the criminal.
8 | Robert Brown | 10154713753771336_10154713779781336 | I give Wallace a 4 out of 10.

10 | Terry Carroll | 10154713753771336_10154713778136336 | Was on Mark Cubans fb page earlier and saw a post of someone asking for someone to kill Donald Trump. And the media says Trump supporters are the ones trying to incite violence. I have screen shots of this comment and individual and have passed this info on to the FBI and various worthy media outlets.
11 | Sam Morifi | 10154713753771336_10154713777476336 | It's NASTY that Hillary Clinton ignored the cries for help from Ambassador Steven before he and several other Americans got slaughtered by savage Muslims in Benghazi. It's NASTY how she exploited the people of Haiti. It's NASTY that Hillary Clinton defended a rapist and laughed about it. It's NASTY that she had 6 billion dollars unaccounted for as Secretary of State. It's NASTY how she claims to support women's rights but still accept donor money from countries that oppress women. It's NASTY that she purposely deleted evidence that could have put her in jail. It's NASTY how the mainstream media is eating right out of her hand. So yes I agree with Trump's so-called controversial statement. She is a NASTY woman!- sincerely, an angry deplorable from Africa
12 | Mary Ann Chandler | 10154713753771336_1163901157035797 | I used to hate Hillary but I listened, researched, and read about her work and policies but you know what after over 30 years of studying all that she has done!  I still hate Hillary Clinton.
13 | Luci Brown Stefek | 10154713753771336_10154713782866336 | Why aren't you asking Hillary why she DID NOT answer the question given to her about how she treated All those many women her husband had sex with and raped!!!She Never answered at all!!!!!Why aren't you reporters asking questions about this???????

19 | Kristy Townsend | 10154713753771336_10154713782456336 | She had the opportunity to protect and serve the American public. She failed us miserably. She is responsible for the death of 4 American's. Not to mention the corruption that seems to surround her!

"Look at her"...it's an entire person.....Look at you.....you should be on MSNBC because you're so misunderstood.Sounds the same to me.

21 | Jamie Lynn Johnson | 10154713753771336_10154713798376336 | Hmmm she had to resign as Secretary of State, she failed miserably at the lower office so now let's put her in charge in the highest office.

Donald J. Trump disagreed with Hillary Clinton's characterization of him as being "cavalier" and "casual" about the use of nuclear weapons. http://fxn.ws/2eTjiXF
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | David Johnston | 10154713519921336_10154713725401336 | The reason Donald Trump did not agree to accept the outcome of the election. It's because all the theifth the Democrats have done. Plus he flat out won the debate. So many questions she didn't want to answer.
2 | Jay Jones | 10154713519921336_10154713722421336 | Hillary is guilty of treason and she knows it.........Hillary will finish destroying this Nation and can only "win" this election through fraud and cheating
3 | Dan Belle | 10154713519921336_10154713728586336 | Omg!!!! Fox news stop saying he refused to accept the results of the election!!!!!! That is NOT what he said stop trying to make up our minds,,  he said he would let you know when it happens, he like hundreds of millions of people are suspect of what is going on, and you talking about it proves it.  Shut your opinionated one sided pie holes!!!! Its been 15 minutes now and you haven't even mention killarys name
4 | Josie Milone | 10154713519921336_10154713726191336 | How in the heck do we get the Bush cheer leader, Megyn Kelly, Juan Williams discussing the debate with us??? Fox what the heck are you thinking???
5 | Karen Fiorentino-Christensen | 10154713519921336_10154713722091336 | Because I can't trust Hillary, you have my vote Donald Trump.
6 | Kathleen Griffin | 10154713519921336_10154713728416336 | Trump won the Debate. Wallace did a great job. That was a tough one. Sometimes people who are guilty are full of words and people who are full of action few words. TRUMP spoke the TRUTH!
7 | Tom Herrick | 10154713519921336_10154713734251336 | Very disappointing listening to Megan Kelly and the guests on Fox after the debate. I had to check my TV because it sounded just like CNN. I can no longer watch Fox except when Hannity is on.
8 | Marie Sweeney Foxx | 10154713519921336_10154713725056336 | OK, I am not for either of these idiots!!! But here are a couple things to think about. Perhaps the russians are hacking the dnc because Hillary got caught sending top secret info and they can't get that info anymore? Because Trump didn't pay taxes he is a bad guy? Let me ask you this, if you had the chance to take advantage of the loopholes to pay less taxes or no taxes, would you do it? Of course you would. What Hillary did was illegal. What Trump did with taxes was LEGAL. Again, I am not for either candidate.
9 | Sherry Chowka | 10154713519921336_10154713737646336 | " I hear that train a comin‚ÄôIt‚Äôs rollin‚Äô round the bend.Gonna pick up Mrs. ClintonAnd take her to the pen.They‚Äôll have her coronationMake her cell block queenHillary for prisontwo thousand and sixteenThey‚Äôve got an orange pants suitHangin‚Äô on the wallAnd a cell for Bubba WillieJust a little down the hall.We‚Äôll put ‚Äòem in the big houseLock them up inside.Unless a whole lot of witnessesCommit suicide.Remember James McDougalAnd 20 or 30 moreAbout to testify, they found ‚Äòem dead upon the floor.Now they‚Äôre pilin‚Äô up the bodiesLike they did back thenThey want back in the White HouseHere we go again.Glue the china to the tableNail the table to the floorLock up all the silver‚Äòfore they haul it out the doorWhite trash in the White HouseBeats all I‚Äôve ever seen.Hillary for prisontwo thousand and sixteen
10 | Anthony Johnston | 10154713519921336_10154713735046336 | Trump knocked it out of the park. He was detailed on his policy. He stuck by the Constitution. And, he was the only one who brought up the Veterans. That is the Leadership that our Great Country deserves. Congratulations Mr. Trump...Very Presidential!
11 | Rory Mambo | 10154713519921336_10154713735861336 | I agree with Donald J. Trump for the life of me, I can't accept having a criminal, liar, who doesn't believe in Catholics, calls people who are deplorables, basement dwellers, disprespects Police..law and order, let people die and lie to their families, who takes money from Countries who treat women horribly, and kill gays and lesbians, who wants to go to war with Russia.... as a President for our Country..So I can't say I would accept more years of her. So VOTE TRUMP not to accept her
12 | Charles Kimmel | 10154713519921336_10154713740666336 | Blow hard Megyn goes back to her regular smears preferring not to discuss the debate, but to smear Trump based on the gold-digger Gloria Ared clients' fradulent claims and accusations.   You are nothing but a Hillary Clinton troll Megyn!
13 | Joey Diaz | 10154713519921336_10154713725421336 | That is not anything new Hillary is a plain liar nothing knew! We need to rally Republicans and Democrats and Independents alike, in order to show the American People that actions matter much more than words!
14 | Tamera Marten | 10154713519921336_10154713736606336 | Why was Hillary continually looking down through out her responses?  Why was she provided a lighted podium and Donald Trump wasn't?  Was there a thorough examination of the podiums before they walked out on stage to ensure there was no cheating?  Because of her special treatment....there is no room for anything but examination of the details before the debate.
15 | Joseph Brasington | 10154713519921336_10154713741001336 | With all the corruption that is clearly seen in the Government from the President, Attorney General, FBI Director, the Media, Hillary Clinton and her campaign that is readily staging mass voter fraud across the country;  can we blame Trump for answering the question like he did about accepting the out come of the votes on election day?
16 | Marcia Boon Green | 10154713519921336_10154713733026336 | Let's be straight fox....Trump said "we'll see" he did NOT say he wouldn't accept the nomination..... He's HONEST.... unlike Hillary.... proven...Remember, proof now that the DNC has went after Trump and pushed for violence....they also have the media in their pocket! You are making me sick....
17 | John Rillaerts | 10154713519921336_10154713728636336 | That Hillary is a number, a number that people who like to be slaves and dependent of the government will follow blindly. It takes a lot of will power and effort to become independent from the government machine. brainwashed Liberals are comfortable in their role as slaves. Time for a president that sets things right. Time for TRUMP
18 | Tim Flynn | 10154713519921336_10154713739551336 | Man Megan Kelly is still a bitter woman! There's no redeemable qualities on either candidate but she has to keep piling on Trump.Get over it all ready and shame on Fox for letting her drone on every night.Hillary should be in Jail and Donald should be on the Apprentice.
19 | Virginia Roberts | 10154713519921336_10154713756801336 | I hate listening to Megyn Kelly.. all she does is put Trump down.. I am so sick of that woman.. can't you get Hannity for once? No, because you want Trump to lose!!!
20 | Patricia Leighton | 10154713519921336_10154713745201336 | People are already misquoting Trump & it will be the headlines tomorrow. Trump did not say he would not accept the results of the election, just said he will look at it!!!
21 | Michele Mosley | 10154713519921336_10154713729891336 | I sure hope FOX doesn't sensationalize the fact that Trump will not say if he will accept the out come.  We know there was a lot of bad things going on that Wiki Leaks exposed, and the media bashing.  Sure, go ahead and report it, but please don't milk it for a week.  There are bigger and better things to focus on.
22 | JoAnne Gause Cole | 10154713519921336_10154713760091336 | I was extremely disappointed that ALL THE FOX STAFF can talk about is Trump's saying he will "look at the results of the election at the time"....there were so many issues to discuss about their differences, the abortion, the second amendment, the supreme court...and all you can talk about is the comment about the conceding of the election...get off of it Fox...
23 | Gene Jones | 10154713519921336_636485169859603 | Ladies & Gents that's how you tell lies to the American voters, so they can vote for you! Empty promises just like Obama did it with his free health care! Everyone was fooled about it and now Obamacare is a disaster!HC is another big gov. puppet! She doesn't care about the middle class! She will tax us the most!!!Don't be fooled by another Democrat like Obama did...Vote TRUMP...
24 | Adele Hoegermeyer | 10154713519921336_1308857132466886 | Well Ms Megan Kelly got right on the band wagon of Mr. Trump and women. I think she should go back and view her Howard Stern tape when she was a guest. How does she defend her behavior during that interview. Quite titillating.  No one else brings it up, but her.
25 | Bobbie Swindle | 10154713519921336_686917381476468 | Megan kelly you sound like you should be on MSNBC are you trying to switch channels?  Fox News is just like the establishment republicans now. They pushed trump during the primaries and now they want to back away. If they would have supported Ted Cruz to begin with we wouldnt have this problem. They  are sticking with the establishment republicans and backing Hilary.

--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Kate Marie | 10154713533946336_10154713670471336 | She wants to be the president for ALL Americans yet those aborted aren't important enough. Maybe because they can't vote. She is a disgrace. No flag pin, murdered Americans in bangazi, deleted emails, lying to the American people over and over. She needs to be elected for a inmate position in JAIL!!
2 | Skull Tierra | 10154713533946336_10154713671381336 | Why did she just tell the entire world how long it takes for us to launch a nuke?? Shouldn't that be "top secret classified???"
3 | Cinde Keep Smith | 10154713533946336_10154713676446336 | She verified 2 strong things. She going to change our Constitution and  make tax payers foot the bill for abortions including babies of 9 months gestation. Disgusting
4 | Wayne R Johnson | 10154713533946336_10154713670661336 | Hillary's political record is built from greed, stained with blood and covered with a whitewash of lies and conveniently fake excuses of stupidity whenever; the lies begin to weaken in a rain of truth. Where is her admission or her apology?It's not hate, it's not discrimination, it's love and responsibility to do our part as Americans and Christians.On a plane you are told "In case of an emergency oxygen mask will drop from the console above, put the mask on YOURSELF FIRST then help children or others." We are given these instructions before a flight.Why? So that we maintain consciousness to help others. Jesus tells us "FIRST take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye.‚Äù (his story regards judging but the principle applies)The only way America can continue to help the world is to make sure we keep America strong.Some don't realize the extent of danger they are in when the mask falls, they try to put the mask on others first. In doing so they lose consciousness and become oblivious to their surroundings.America is in an emergency. The mask has dropped and we cannot afford to become oblivious to your surroundings.We must fix ourselves so we can continue to be the nation of hope and freedom. Trump understands this analogy, He wants to protect America first and fix the issues toMake America Great Again.One nation under God
5 | Keith Duncan | 10154713533946336_10154713678826336 | I cannot take credit for this, as I'm not the original author, but thought it is too important not to share.ALL Of A Sudden....Seven Short Years Have Passed!Before Obama, There was virtually no outlandish presence of Islam in America.‚Ä¢ All of a sudden, Islam is taught in schools. Christianity and the bible are banned in schools.‚Ä¢ All of a sudden we must allow prayer rugs everywhere and allow for Islamic prayer in schools, airports, and businesses.‚Ä¢ All of a sudden we must stop serving pork in prisons.‚Ä¢ All of a sudden we are inundated with law suits by Muslims who are offended by American culture.‚Ä¢ All of a sudden we must allow burkas to be worn everywhere even though you have no idea who or what is covered up under them.‚Ä¢ All of a sudden Muslims are suing employers and refusing to do their jobs if they personally deem it conflicts with Sharia Law.‚Ä¢ All of a sudden the Attorney General of the United States vows to prosecute anyone who engages in 'anti-Muslim speech'.‚Ä¢ All of a sudden, Jihadists who engage in terrorism and openly admit they acted in the name of Islam and ISIS are emphatically declared they are NOT Islamic by our leaders and/or their actions are determined NOT to be terrorism, but other nebulous terms like 'workplace violence."‚Ä¢ All of a sudden, it becomes Policy that Secular Middle East dictators that were benign or friendly to the West, must be replaced by Islamists and the Muslim Brotherhood.‚Ä¢ All of a sudden our troops are withdrawn from Iraq and the middle east, giving rise to ISIS.‚Ä¢ All of a sudden, America has reduced its nuclear stockpiles to 1950 levels, as Obama's stated goal of a nuke-free America by the time he leaves office continues uninterrupted.‚Ä¢ All of a sudden, a deal with Iran must be made at any cost, with a pathway to nuclear weapons and HUNDREDS of BILLIONS of dollars handed over to fund their programs.‚Ä¢ All of a sudden America APOLOGIZES to Muslim states and sponsors of terror worldwide for acts of aggression, war, and sabotage THEY perpetrate against our soldiers.‚Ä¢ All of a sudden, the American Navy is diminished to 1917 Pre-World War I levels Of only 300 ships. The Army is at pre-1940 levels. The Air Force scraps 500 planes and planned to retire the use of the A-10 Thunderbolt close air support fighter. A further draw down of another 40,000 military personnel is in progress.‚Ä¢ All of a sudden half of our aircraft carriers are recalled for maintenance by Obama rendering the Atlantic unguarded, NONE are in the Middle East .‚Ä¢ All of a sudden Obama has to empty Guantanamo Bay of captured Jihadists and let them loose in Jihad-friendly Islamic states. He demands to close the facility.‚Ä¢ All of a sudden America will negotiate with terrorists and trade FIVE Taliban commanders for a deserter and Jihad sympathizer.‚Ä¢ All of a sudden there is no money for American poor, disabled veterans, jobless Americans, hungry Americans, or displaced Americans but there is endless money for Obama's "Syrian refugee" resettlement Programs.‚Ä¢ All of sudden there is an ammunition shortage in the USA.‚Ä¢ All of a sudden, the most important thing for Obama to do after a mass shooting by two Jihadists, is disarm American citizens.‚Ä¢ All of a sudden, the President of the United States cannot attend the Christian funerals of a Supreme Court Justice and a former First Lady because of previous (seemingly unimportant) commitments. **************************************************************************************************************All of a sudden, I‚Äôm sick to my stomach. I‚Äôm not sure the majority of Americans recognize the seriousness of the situation and how much ‚Äúprogress‚Äù has been made by Islam these last 7 years, a very brief time compared to a 75 year lifetime!üá∫üá∏ Yes, this IS Obama's legacy.
6 | Marnie Lou | 10154713533946336_10154713672956336 | Yep! She would say and do anything to get elected .. But let's look at her political history so far?? What are her accomplishments?? Quit telling us all the crap you are going to do.. You have had the last 20 years to do it... And all you and other career politicians have left us is a freaking mess..
7 | Rob Dedo | 10154713533946336_10154713676431336 | Killery just don't get it. Trump can lower taxes because there will be more businesses coming in and more people working so in reality there would be more people paying taxes and less people needing handouts so in reality it would be much better Trump's way. Also Trumps ways he would be closing the loopholes so the wealthy will also be paying.
8 | Irene La | 10154713533946336_10154713672761336 | Why is Chris giving more time to Hillary and keeps cutting off Donald? I thought he was going to be fair. Or is he scare of the backlash from the leftish media?
9 | Darlene Grove | 10154713533946336_10154713691586336 | I am so sick of Hillary saying that she has spent her entire life 'working for women and children' - the only women and children that she has worked for is HILLary herself and the children is Chelsea. You do not spent your entire life working for others and become a Millionaire. She spews more BS than any woman and liar than I have ever seen.
10 | Brian Laskoski | 10154713533946336_10154713673331336 | Just wait in the coming weeks she will be throwing Obama under the bus after this beatdown and using his failures as a Hail Mary to the endzone with 2 seconds on the clock.
11 | Tara Swope Saksek | 10154713533946336_10154713672806336 | Yes... Why would we actually negotiate with the countries who owe us the money. On second thought lets get the wealthy and middle and poor in America pay for everything by increasing our taxes!?!!? No thanks!
12 | Honey Wales | 10154713533946336_10154713679926336 | Stand up for children?? But, she supports late term abortions??? Hypocrite. He speaks from the HEART. She lies thru her teeth. DT is not making up the Corruption of the Clintons, most of this infor. has been out there for years - not thru the Main stream News Mafia, but thru other REPUTABLE sources.
13 | Miguel Duhamel | 10154713533946336_10154713691221336 | She said it takes four minutes to launch nuclear missiles from the president why did he not come back with, it took U more than 13 hours to answer a phone call for Benghazi
14 | Matt Ernst | 10154713533946336_10154713700896336 | Chris Wallace has left her off the hook on answering two questions he posed which were never answered. 1. To explain her role in discrediting the victims of her husband (never even broached) & 2. Would she shoot down a Russian plane in her hypothetical no fly zone in Syria.
15 | Rachel Morris Allgood | 10154713533946336_1874624882760871 | She talked about that poor little boy with blood all over his head, but abortion is OK ! She really think that the DEPLORABLES are STUPID ! Stop looking down your nose !
16 | Andrew Pate | 10154713533946336_10154713670961336 | Hillary Clinton, as a person, as a secretary of state. Folks, I'm here to tell you, there was no way this woman ought to be anywhere near the Oval Office. She ought not be anywhere near the White House. I don't care what Donald Trump's faults are, I don't care what people think of Donald Trump. This kind of corruption has got to be stoped. Trumps right the system is rigged @the Highest level
17 | Gina Gillespie-Marshall | 10154713533946336_10154713693681336 | As an undecided in Ohio. I was leaning towards Hillary but am now swayed by Mr Trump.  I didn't like that she avoided answering questions of integrity e.g. the Clinton Foundation or her stances and plans.  It seems like she spends most of her time cleaning up the problems she's created.  Glad I watched tonight
18 | Sharron Gibson Boling | 10154713533946336_10154713692451336 | Oh i love him!! Lets get a real american in the whitehouse! He blew her away!! Nice to hear someone stand up for us true Americans! Feeling happy!! Thank you Donald! My hero!!üòä
19 | Peggy Bucklin | 10154713533946336_10154713700296336 | Right off the bat Fox starts talking negative about Donald J. Trump because be did not say he would accept the results of the election. So fed up with all the news media.
20 | Mark Ferraro | 10154713533946336_10154713687401336 | Yea Killery from our pockets right to yours. And you got the nerve to Lie again and say "You'll stand up for us Americans " yea.. bull like you stood up for the American citizens you allowed to be brutality tortured and murdered in Benghazi. You are such a evil liar.
21 | Cassandra Rizer | 10154713533946336_10154713696476336 | Megan Kelly is Pathetic - Cannot stand her - She has been waiting for over a year to gloat === She is not a republican and She doesn't speak for Women. She is a Political Corporate Clinton Pusher. Americans are SICK of the BIAS in the media and she has been fighting against TRUMP since the first debate in the primaries. She should go work for CNN or DNC
22 | James Gustin | 10154713533946336_10154713688826336 | "She'll say anything, and change nothing."  ~ Barack Obama, 2008Hillary Clinton is definitely all talk. She WILL say anything to get the vote, and will NOT change a single thing. In fact, she will make things worse.
23 | Oscar Bautista | 10154713533946336_1205963099478106 | Yes where the hell is the 6 billion dollars that's missing in the state department according to the Inspector General. Hillary should go to jail just for this single issue, never mind the hosts of issues we now know with written evidence about her crimes. Lock her up already.
24 | Dawna Ballard Rickord | 10154713533946336_10154713702786336 | Fox News is wrong. He can't accept the decision because the media is biased and tapes released today show Clinton campaign has tampered with the campaign. Media pushed this.
25 | Isaac King | 10154713533946336_10154713681296336 | This election is all about issues:1. Supreme Court: We need conservative Judges otherwise this country will be a abortion country, lesbian country, Islamic country, and poor country (18 T debt), more spending than earning country, more taxing country in the world. I do not want my teenage daughter will go to a restroom where a grown man is. God cannot bless America if we do not have justice through right judges who follow the biblical values.Mr. Trump committed to appoint Judges who support biblical and our constitutional values. He already named 20 most conservative judges for Supreme Courts and other courts.Hillary promised to appoint Judges that support abortion, same sex, Islamazition. Obama named Muslim judges for courts and suggested Sharia laws, and Hillary will continue Obama‚Äôs polices.2. Protection: Government is all about protection. As a country we cannot allow other countries to dump their criminals, addict ones into USA to harm us, destroy us, and kill us. Mr. Trump committed to protect American citizens with number one priority whatever necessary such as wall, strong military, tough diplomacy, peace through strength, small government for small business.Hillary will open borders, open access to Muslims, cut military funding as Obama did, give Nukes to our enemies as Bill did to N. Korea, Obama open the door for Iran, big government, more spending with high taxes on every paycheck. 3. Job creation: Taxing the companies in the highest way will force them to leave USA. Bill did it that causes China to become rich and powerful. We will lose more jobs and there will be no such a thing "Made in USA." Clintons already made almost everything here "Made in China."Mr. Trump committed to cut taxes for all Americans, but will get money from foreign trades to run a small government.Hillary will raise taxes to everyone, every company, every paycheck; even she will tax to the churches as Obama passed already executive order. 4. Education: We need parents' choice school education system, not government forced one. Mr. Trump committed to vanish common core, Federal and state running school system. He will bring it to local, and give it to parents ‚ÄúWe, the people‚Äù.Hillary will continue common core, more federal regulation and a federal education system with advisors who are Muslims and atheists. 5. Religious Freedom: We want government will not politically correct us through laws and punishment through any forms and titles. Mr. Trump committed to stop completely all political correctness where every Americans can enjoy religious freedom everywhere in the Land. Hillary will forced political correctness everywhere by laws and punishments. Pastors will be stopped by law and punishment to preach the biblical sermon, no sermon on the mountain. So do not vote your feelings, skin, sex, but use your brain for the good and bright future for you and your children as our forefathers did when they founded our nation. Make America Great Again by casting your vote for Mr. Trump. Thank you. God bless you. God bless America.-Prepared by Dr. King

1 | Sheikh Musa | 10154713599241336_10154713630031336 | I used to hate Hillary but from 8 years i am searching and reading about her work and policies but you know what afrer all these 8 years i still hate hillary Clinton
2 | Tracy L Heyden | 10154713599241336_10154713630021336 | body language in psychology if you have taken that course.. tells you all ya need to know about killery
3 | Stacey N LeeAnne Ellertson | 10154713599241336_10154713631851336 | Nothing is more horrifying than a crooked, corrupt, lying, evil person like Hillary Clinton.
4 | Rick Stewart | 10154713599241336_10154713633896336 | Watching the debate, I'm not sure what's more striking: The smug, pompous arrogance of the disgusting, repulsive, hideous Hildabeast - or her ability to lie about her lies thinking nobody cares or notices !
5 | Kathy Ledet Relan | 10154713599241336_10154713632171336 | Why didn't he ask Hillary if she would accept the results of the election?
6 | Adria Marshall Denzinger | 10154713599241336_10154713635496336 | Horrifying?  No, what is horrifying is you ignoring the pleas for help from four Americans, for 13 hours, while they were tortured, raped, and murdered, you evil witch.
7 | John Spencer | 10154713599241336_10154713638041336 | Someone asked me today how I stand up for Trump, a misogynist, a racist and a bigot. Here is my answer: Because I use my head to research and find out what candidates really are, not what the media wants me to think.Because DT has more women in executive and managerial positions than any comparable company, which tells me he is not a misogynist. ...Because he pays these women the same or more than their male counterparts, which tells me looks for capacity and skills in people, not color, gender or race.Because he fought the West Palm Beach City to be able to open his newly purchased club, so he could include blacks and Jews as members, who had been banned until then. This tells me he is not a racist.            Because he has raised wonderful children that have turned out to be outstanding, hard working and compassionate adults. He must be doing something right.    Because his economic plans makes sense, are conservative in nature, and I vote based on what is best for my family, my friends and my country.Because everybody, the left and the right are afraid of him, the media is trying to destroy his image, and even foreign governments are voicing their opinion, so he must be doing something right. Clean house maybe?    Because I want a SCOTUS that will uphold the Constitution, not behave as minions of the administration. I have had enough with judges that are more like political activists than law enforcers. I do not want the same fate for the SCOTUS.Because I fear for my family's safety if the current trend of not confronting blatant terrorism continues, which is a threat to our way of life.            Because I am fed up with the rampant corruption of this administration. Accountability in government is paramount and, as this administration has demonstrated, it is a foreign concept to them.Because I am fed up with the political correctness gone wild, and because he is not afraid to say what everybody thinks but does not dare to say. A thug is a thug, regardless of color, and that's it.          Because it is about time someone puts America's interests ahead of other countries.  Because I know he recognizes and embraces America's exceptionalism, and will not tour the World apologizing for who we are. That tells me he is a patriot.  Because, unlike HRC, he has actually held a job, worked hard and achieved success.And last, but not least,Because I am more offended by what Hillary does than by what Trump says. I could have gone on and on, but I think you get the picture.
8 | Melody Fitzwater Johns | 10154713599241336_10154713637756336 | She is disgraceful.  Couldn't even look directly at the camera when she talked about how she and Bill have "supported Haiti for years and years."  Yeah you lying cheat go home!
9 | Harriet Albright | 10154713599241336_10154713641081336 | Michelle Obama said if Donald Trump is elected: "We're telling our sons it's okay to humiliate women. We're telling our daughters this is how they deserve to be treated.".... that's funny. So does that mean that if Hillary Clinton is elected, we are teaching our sons & daughters that it's ok to murder, lie, cover up, be corrupt, demean women, use racial slurs, and stay with a spouse that openly rapes women & cheats on you?
10 | Sally Hansen Pattok | 10154713599241336_10154713634501336 | Gore the loser didn't concede to Bush the winner.Gore sued. Repeatedly. And he & his supporters never accepted the results.
11 | James Sanders | 10154713599241336_10154713636011336 | What's horrifying are the OKeefe videos that the major media are trying to keep under wraps. Pretty much proves the DNC is capable of anything, including voter fraud.
12 | Megan Glisson | 10154713599241336_10154713639066336 | Why should he accept it? It's been proven she will cheat to get the nomination and she will stop at nothing, she will say anything to get in the White House. Even Obama says she will do and say anything she needs to say to get in the White House. If you are so sure you will legitimately win, allow voter ID to make sure people who aren't supposed to vote or are dead, don't vote. If you're so sure.
13 | Linda Cracraft Albos | 10154713599241336_10154713636091336 | I wish Chris had better control of the debate. .he is letting mainly Hillary run over him. .they need to have a shock button. .you get out of hand you get zapped. .
14 | Gerry Rickard | 10154713599241336_1256422221069559 | I learned something new during this debate. I learned where the mute button is on a Directv remote, I've used it every time Hitlery has answered a question. This has been the most enjoyable debate I've watched so far
15 | Darlene Howe | 10154713599241336_10154713641201336 | Trump is knocking it out of the park! She belongs in jail, why is she allowed to run at all? Because she must have a little black book on most of the big wigs in Washington.......... they're all afraid of her and we should be too.
16 | Linda Cracraft Albos | 10154713599241336_1755119774747990 | I agree the picture of the little 4 year old boy with blood on his face sitting in the ambulance is horrifying. .however so is the fact that she says an unborn child up to hours before birth has not rights. .or that a young 12 year old girl, that was raped by a older man, wanted the affection (and this is just my wording. .hers was worse) of the older man and then chuckle on video about getting the man off
17 | Natalie Thomason Golly | 10154713599241336_10154713651006336 | With all the found Hillary general election ballots, 10s of thousands in a warehouse in Ohio last month, All the dead democratic registered voters and no voter ID laws... he's correct not to just accept the initial outcome.
18 | Dave Tee | 10154713599241336_1755125291414105 | These past eight years have taught me to do something I'm ashamed of. I've actually hated  people. I try to fight it but this whole government and media has me pissed off to the point of hate for what they're doing and have done to this nation and its people. I'm disgusted by this woman.
19 | Thomas Patterson | 10154713599241336_10154713644341336 | When Gore challenged his election results and took it to the supreme court the left had no issue with that. If it looks like fraud and corruption changed the result Trump should challenge, if not he should concede, won't know until nov 8th
20 | Laura Smith | 10154713599241336_1256420901069691 | I love Chris Wallace, I trust him. I'm disappointed he's allowed HC to go on and on slandering Trump, she's had more time than he to spread her lies , bla, bla, bla. Her specialty in government is deception and yet she gets the most time. Where is the questions about emails, FBI, Benghazi , Wikileaks?
21 | Elena M Siniscalchi | 10154713599241336_1256419897736458 | Well I won't accept the outcome if it is Killary because it will be a win from voter fraud!!!! So no, we Americans should not accept it and Trump shouldnt.. we fight back and revolt!!!!
22 | L Jason Queen | 10154713599241336_1755121618081139 | I will not accept nor recognize (George Soros) I mean Hillary Clinton as president of the U.S. "Doesn't matter what the press says. Doesn't matter what the politicians or the mobs say. Doesn't matter if the whole country decides that something wrong is something right. This nation was founded on one principle above all else: The requirement that we stand up for what we believe, no matter the odds or the consequences. When the mob and the press and the whole world tell you to move, your job is to plant yourself like a tree beside the river of truth, and tell the whole world -- "No, YOU move.‚Äù ~ Cap
23 | Jakie Hearn | 10154713599241336_1256420401069741 | Why didn't Chris ask her about all of Bill's women like he said he was....he ask Trump about all the women accusing him of different things but never went back to her about Bill.  Also, why didn't he ask her if she would accept the election outcome.
24 | Patty Meade Buzzelli | 10154713599241336_10154713648386336 | We all have seen- if you looked beyond the Lib media, that the democrats and obama administration have been signing up all kinds of people to vote that normally would not be able to vote..... muslim immigrants, illegal aliens, felons and dead people are on the voter rolls
25 | Diane Dunn Beck | 10154713599241336_1256419737736474 | What is horrifying is that Hillary Clinton has not been formally charged and is able to even run in the presidential election!

2 | Brad Brower | 10154713575301336_10154713588036336 | There's also one candidate that has American bloods on her hands.

4 | Pepe Perejil | 10154713575301336_10154713587216336 | As American hispanics, we are tired of how all of these coward racist liberals that hate America like Obama, Clinton, and their supporters are trying to turn this great country into a 3rd world one. Unfortunately, one of the biggest problems we have right now is the media and entertainment that are always trying to tell us how to think. They have created enough imbeciles that would re-elect a failure like Obama. Even more, we're supposed to bow down to anti-American Obama, love liberal policies no matter how destructive they are, love bigger enslaving government, and be in favor of illegal immigration because of the color of our skin... disgusting. That's why we support Donald Trump. Show everyone your support for Trump by buying the fantastic Trump Strong t-shirt at: www.teespring.com/trumpstrong .And let's Make America Great Again! Thank you.
5 | Andrew Nemeth | 10154713575301336_10154713588996336 | Clinton says she did not know the ``C'' mark meant classified information and did not ``pay attention to different classification levels.'' Yet she had signed a binding classified information nondisclosure agreement.
6 | Cristi Chirtes | 10154713575301336_10154713590161336 | Hillary you are the worst and the worst criminal ever this country see the hole 245 years...that is a SHAME for ALL American people
7 | Jeffery Flatt | 10154713575301336_10154713600651336 | Actually Hillary, when your husband signed NAFTA he gave China steelworkers jobs,Trump had to buy the steel since thats where our steel comes from...this is all on you and Bill!
8 | Linda Sullivan Creamons | 10154713575301336_10154713588486336 | and there is only one of you on stage who is responsible for deaths in Benghazi!!!!!!!
9 | Rockwell Torrey | 10154713575301336_10154713587671336 | You could lay the bodies left in the Clinton's wake on the steps of Congress, or deliver indictments for her every crime to the Supreme Court, and it would mean nothing to anyone except for the millions of Americans willing to say no more. We will stand together until Hillary Clinton is defeated. She may have the Media. We have the votes. We will save this Nation.
10 | Cindy Bryant | 10154713575301336_10154713594566336 | Fox News like I said, Chris Wallace is a registered Democrat. Can you count how many times biased Chris Wallace has cut off Donald J. Trump? Countless!!! Meanwhile, Wallace has allowed Hillary to run with her lies!!!! How much time did each candidate get? Donald J. Trump got 35:41 and Hillary Clinton got 41:46 as reported by CNN Politics. There you have it folks, Wallace sold out!! #TrumpPence16 #MAGA #BigLeagueTruth
11 | Lisa Land Coles | 10154713575301336_10154713589526336 | Hillary hasn't shipped any jobs to Mexico because she's never created any.
12 | Terri Nukem | 10154713575301336_10154713590556336 | If miss Cunton was THAT concerned about the laws that millionaires/billionaires take advantage of, then she would've changed it in those 30 years....but she uses them herself and that folks, is why she hasn't changed them. She benefits too. #DrainTheSwamp
13 | GatesandCarole Conner | 10154713575301336_1467346489948298 | My father was a steelworker for 37 years, a coal miner for 10 years, and spent 4 years in WWII. He would never have backed Hillary Clinton. She does not represent anything he stood for or fought for. She is a catastrophe waiting to happen.
14 | Bren Vieweg | 10154713575301336_10154713610751336 | After William Jefferson Clinton signed NAFTA there was no way US steel mills could compete against foreign steel mills anymore that's why Trump had to use Chinese steel.
15 | Cordell Smith | 10154713575301336_10154713605896336 | He buys the steel from China because Clinton and Obama cut out the coal that produces the steel in America!!!
16 | Gail VandeSande | 10154713575301336_10154713617151336 | I will no longer watch Chris Wallace and perhaps Fox news. So disappointed in the questioning and time given to Trump. Interupting Me. Trump nearly every time and allowing Mrs. Clinton to rant
17 | Linda Falke | 10154713575301336_10154713615631336 | There's only one person on the stage who's guilty of stealing the nomination ... and that's you, Hillary Clinton: professional liar and thief.
18 | Steve Sunderlin | 10154713575301336_10154713611036336 | Well -- True.  He is a businessman and the business environment created by Hillary's husband made it advantageous for Mr. Trump to do just that.  It would be foolish to buy American or keep your global company in US simply out of patriotism if you are at a business disadvantage against your global competition.  Donald wants to make the US a business advantage.  He wants to make companies want to come here, to stay here and to employ American workers.  If we make labor more expensive ($15 Min Wage) and if she wants to penalize corporations with higher taxes, they are going to leave because they have other choices.
19 | Daniel Royal | 10154713575301336_10154713591956336 | Just Let This Set In 15 dollars hour minimum wage that would make everything go up a 300-400 grocery bill will turn into 600-700 grocery bill collage buying a car or house clothes etc If you let people into this country you will not have job increase because they will get our jobs or create jobs we knows this Middle Class will become the ones barely making it
20 | Holly Benschoter Copado | 10154713575301336_10154713598766336 | Seriously, Fox? Why isn't she asked point blank if she lied to the FBI? Ask if she deleted 33k emails after they were supoenaed?
21 | Melissa Freelove | 10154713575301336_10154713593241336 | Because our government Jacks our taxes ! I would too  after all before he started running for the president of the United States or was he not a businessman do businessmen not try to make it the most money they can? But once he lowers taxes he can bring em back ! Thank you Hillary but you can go now !
22 | Bob Cilino | 10154713575301336_10154713610371336 | I am not a Trump fan, but at least he has created real jobs. The only jobs Hilliary has created are for defense attorneys,  computer scrubbers, and paid protesters. Oh yeah and Debbie whats her name Schultz
23 | Jon Childrey | 10154713575301336_10154713592941336 | Did she forget about her husband's nafta deal to which she whole heartedly supported. Isnt that the kettle calling the pot black
24 | Paulla Warren Johnson | 10154713575301336_10154713613811336 | Chris let her slip by from answering the question he asked her about Attacking bills women. That was a big error he has let her go off topic allot for extended periods of time
25 | William Phillip Broadus | 10154713575301336_10154713617311336 | She never created a job or ran a business in her life. What has she actually accomplished in 30+ years of living off my tax money.

Say whatever you want but whoever is President major changes are on the way and I at least want to know I did my part urging people to get out and vote Trump!
3 | Tara Coker | 10154713540066336_10154713559606336 | What about the part of the question directed to her in reference to her defending Bill and his behavior?? She did a great job dodging that bullet...
4 | Sandra E Loggia | 10154713540066336_10154713559961336 | Chris Wallace gave Clinton a pass. She didn't answer her question about what she did to the women her husband raped and assaulted!!

11 | Steve Brown | 10154713540066336_10154713564411336 | Clinton is really bothered by "Russians" releasing all the info of her corruption to wiki leaks....she hates that all that info has been getting out, she changes the subject and goes into her robot fake politician training
12 | Tammy Ortega | 10154713540066336_10154713564716336 | Everyone should vote for Trump , he will make a good president for America, people are so  tired of being over worked and over Tax and under payed and unappreciated .Trump&Pence can and will fix this , and Clinton can't My Voice My Vote and I'm Voting for Trump&Pence.
13 | Callie Calhoun | 10154713540066336_10154713586936336 | Mike would be so disappointed in his son that he let Hillary slip on the Bill Clinton question as well as the Wikileaks email (that she wrote it), and that he also let her pivot on the question he asked her about Secretary of State and the Clinton Foundation! You, Chris are a disappointing disgrace! Way to let her pivot and give her little memorized speeches! You are part of the problem! Thanks for nothing but more bs from her mouth without answering!
14 | Rene Desrosiers | 10154713540066336_10154713586946336 | Chris just asked the same type of question as Brett And Megan asked the first debate with will you sign a pledge to support the nominee, tonight it is will you accept the results of the election?  Chris is losing it and showing us how much of a registered democrat.
15 | Rick Stewart | 10154713540066336_10154713570776336 | Watching the debate, I'm not sure what's more striking: The smug, pompous arrogance of the disgusting, repulsive, hideous Hildabeast - or her ability to lie about her lies thinking nobody cares !
16 | Joe Mills | 10154713540066336_10154713609351336 | I'm so sick of her shaking her head. She does nothing but lie, she has no room to judge anyone. I do whole heartedly believe the groping accusations came from the Clinton camp. It's proved in wiki leaks that they have paid people to protest at Trump rallys. The Clinton camp have proven time and time again if you have read these documents that they will stop at nothing to get where they want to go.If she's is elected I hope all you sheep that voted for her gets everything thing you most certainly deserve and then some, and hope I can get thru it unscathed. I see no way for that to happen though.
17 | Debbie Mathes | 10154713540066336_806991076105234 | I was asked tonight how I could ever support Trump after the comments he made over 11 years ago about women and if I would still support him if he made those comments to my daughter? My response was this....If he had put our nations security at risk, I would not vote for him. If his organization received large donations from countries that killed women and gays, I would not vote for him. If he boasted 30 Years of government experience, but still could not discern if an email was classified or not, without someone letting him know if it was or not, I would not vote for him. If he boasted about how he has defended children his entire life, but is for abortion, (even late term, when the child can feel pain) I would not vote for him. If he wanted my 3 year old Granddaughter to go to restrooms with men dressed as women, I would not vote for him. I have taught my daughter and will teach my granddaughter to disregard sexist remarks and move on, especially when they were made so many years ago and, also to forgive those who say they are sorry. If he caused lives to be destroyed in Benghazi and then lied to the faces of the parents as they stood at their child's casket, I would not vote for him. If people who came against him mysteriously turned up dead, I would not vote for him. If he suddenly developed a southern accent when he was in the South, campaigning, I would not vote for him. If he continually broke the law and that was ignored, I would not vote for him, but right now, the only person who does all these things is Hillary. Right now, the fact that Donald made these remarks over 12 years ago, does not move me. I'm bigger than those remarks and we all have said stupid things throughout our lives. To me, the fact that Hillary lies continuously, is a much bigger problem. We can see the effects of her lies by the state of our poor country right now... Rant over... Still voting for Trump. (Copy and paste) WOW INTERESTING THOUGHTS ......
18 | Linda Held | 10154713540066336_10154713599836336 | Once again, like the first debate, she has a lighted screen in her podium that she's reading from. Trumps podium is completely dark when cameras view them both from behind!
19 | Carolyn Bieker | 10154713540066336_10154713573886336 | I turned it off when the food fight started...why talk about lies..wasted time..the women are lying...Wallace won't stay on topic and seems to give Hillary more time to talk...interrupts trump and stops in from talking...
20 | Patty Knight | 10154713540066336_10154713592476336 | Go Donald Trump! She's a liar and she does not need to run for president for a the emails she lied about and no women should be running for president any way! I vote for Donald Trump all the way!!
21 | Bryan Stamey | 10154713540066336_10154713593571336 | She is a Lying witch, George Soros has her and Obama in his pocket, he spends big money on them, he owns voting machines in 16 key states in 307 counties and Soros has said she is a done deal, I do believe this election is rigged.
22 | Sam Womble | 10154713540066336_10154713600566336 | Trump is telling the truth. Hilary did start these rumors. You can tell be the way NBC held the audio until debate time and then cooper anderson asking him the way he did. It was all set up
23 | Paula Ann Nix Poe | 10154713540066336_10154713592861336 | And who knows what else she has done and hasn't gotten caught ! It is rigged! Dead people vote,  non citizens vote, ,,,ballots are lost ,,not counted, ,,and some folks are so special that they can vote multiple times!
24 | Liz Carragher Westerfer | 10154713540066336_10154713603711336 | Please people get out and vote trump.If Clinton does win this thing all of you morons who voted for her have noooooooo reason to complain about your taxes going up; or all these illegals taking your jobs and all the new random terror attacks. God help us all.
25 | Ryan Chin | 10154713540066336_1761695460770194 | Everyone who supports trump needs to go out and let the world know. Talk to your friends and  neighbors about why #trump is the right choice!

1 | Terry Carroll | 10154713483721336_10154713534981336 | Was just on Mark Cubans fb page and saw a post of someone asking for someone to kill Donald Trump. And the media says Trump supporters are the ones trying to incite violence. I have screen shots of this comment and individual and have passed this info on to the FBI and various media outlets.
2 | Christy Chatman | 10154713483721336_10154713535621336 | Thank you, Mr. Trump, for wearing the stars and stripes!
3 | Dee Gardner Kramer | 10154713483721336_10154713538841336 | Clinton reminds me so much of her husband.... "I did not have sexual relations with that woman." She is lying to America, straight to our faces, just as he did! Lying & very good at it!
4 | Zach Kerman | 10154713483721336_10154713534046336 | Donald J Trump will be the next POTUS... he is showing the world tonight the kind of leader we need for this country!!! Trump/Pence üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
5 | Kiersten B Coats | 10154713483721336_10154713547876336 | if she wants to talk about Trump admitting to things??? How about she admit to lying about Benghazi and leaving those soldiers to die!! How about she admit to deleting 33,000 emails, bashing phones, lying under oath, leaking the 11 year old Trump comments, condoning violent protests, allowing her staff to interfere with voting.......Her list is way longer and more crucial to her competency at president!! Those are the important questions!!
6 | Andrew Lefebvre | 10154713483721336_10154713537781336 | Actually, she admitted to the truthfulness of wikileaks when hrc said "if you read the rest of that sentence" in reference to Chris Wallace's question about "Hillary giving a speech in a leaked email in wikileaks given to a Brazilian bank for a fee of $225000."
7 | George Pattron | 10154713483721336_10154713540896336 | He's got that scag flustered and on the run!! Get her Donald!! Expose that liar for what she is: Just another Democrat who hates America!!
8 | Lori Hinson Netherton | 10154713483721336_10154713542886336 | I can't stand watching this lying woman. she talks about how bad trump treats woman as Bill and her had to pay a woman over eight hundred K for raping her.

As soon as Chris brought up Wikileaks she brings up Russia so she doesn't have to actually respond to the question!  Chris never made her go back and actually answer the question.
11 | Bob Jack Christiansen | 10154713483721336_10154713561751336 | This Christian is voting for TRUMP, I live in California and all my neighbors and friends are voting for TRUMP...We are tired of the lies and corruption of career politicians!!!!
12 | Wayne R Johnson | 10154713483721336_10154713535861336 | Allegations against Donald Trump in these final weeks should be obvious. Yet the email leaks are actual proof about Hillary. Nobody bothered with any allegations until just a few weeks before the election. Think about it people!Dear Common Sense, We know you've been having fun being elusive, hiding from so many to see how they would act and what they would do without you, but please! We beg of you! Please come back! your presence is greatly needed. Needed by so many who are simply lost without you, some ignoring all the deceit, lies and corruption before their eyes and threatening to vote for Hillary Cinton anyway!Common Sense, All of America needs you to effect there minds once again before it's too late to "Just Say No" to more greed and corruption.

14 | Sharon Menser Hoyt | 10154713483721336_10154713544016336 | I hope the American people see the corruption in Hillary , and shut her down . We have had enough of their lies and dragging this country through the dirt .
15 | Orlando Ramos | 10154713483721336_10154713545446336 | Alright I thought they did not know the the questions yet it looks to that Hillary keeps glancing down and appears to be reading her answers... just saying!
16 | Deborah Williams | 10154713483721336_10154713545681336 | Obama blamed Bush for everything even hurricane Katrina, now Hillary blames the Russians... I have found it amusing, even weak when someone is guilty and refuses to take responsibility but instead casts a shadow on someone else to get out of the heat. Wonder what a Hillary presidency would look like.

19 | Rick Stewart | 10154713483721336_10154713567896336 | Watching the debate, I'm not sure what's more striking: The smug, pompous arrogance of the disgusting, repulsive, hideous Hildabeast - or her ability to lie about her lies thinking nobody cares !
20 | Carol Venuto-Rebbecchi | 10154713483721336_10154713557731336 | Tired of hearing her lies! Americans if you want your children to know America the way we know America you need to vote for Trump. Look at the last 8 years how America has changed! Scary!
21 | Sara Sangster Blas | 10154713483721336_10154713576546336 | Chris Wallace neeeds to back up and make Clinton answer the question about her support of the disgusting actions her husband was proven to have done as they had Trump have to answer his part of the question - what a crock!

23 | Ivy Beltran | 10154713483721336_10154713594441336 | Hillary is not answering all the questions directly at all. She likes to stir around. Questions about the open borders & she answered about energy? Whaaattt?
24 | Dave Presutti | 10154713483721336_1627847264181196 | Fox News has the worse post debate analysis I've ever seen. Megyn Kelly is horrible! Brit Hume is negative. Dana Perino is her usual insufferable self. Bret Baier is a wuss! Juan Williams is a dope. Had to turn it off.
25 | Ella Andersen | 10154713483721336_1627821954183727 | Mike Wallace your really fair and balanced!!! NOT!! Hillary makes me sick!!! What a lying, evil woman. Look all she has lied about and is going to get away with it all!! She should never be able to run for this country!

4 | Jerry Quinn | 10154713479741336_10154713502776336 | I'm scared for our country and for the people that love it. Our faith in Jesus should remain stronger than ever. Trump is not a perfect man, nor does he claim to be. He regrets things he has said, just as we all have at times in our lives. He owned it and moved on. That's what men do.  Did he deny it? Did he try to cover it up? Did he throw money at it to make it go away? No he didn't. He was a man and accepted responsibility. Unlike his opponent. She hasn't accepted blame for anything. As for Hillary I firmly believe Hillary is a liar, has blood on her hands, and covers the truth up.  She is God, in her mind. Her side covers it up and thinks she is above the law. She doesn't accept her transgressions or asks for forgiveness. Asking for forgiveness is a sign of weakness to her.I happen to find strength in forgiveness. My faith in Jesus is the very thought of forgiveness. Donald Trump in my eyes is a changed man.  People change, people's hearts change. His heart has changed and I feel with complete certainty he wants to help people that love this country and the greatness this country offers the world.Ladies and Gentlemen, if Hillary is president, there will be a domestic uprising in our present day, of historic measure. History will be made and unfold like never before, right before your eyes. Our country will be torn apart again, as it once was 150 years ago. Why, you say? Not because of race, not because of slavery, not because of states rights.  It will happen because of being a Christian and loving Jesus. Jesus is under attack in this country like never before. Is Our faith not valuable enough to fight for it? Should we lay down and not fight for our Savior? Should Christians go quietly into the night?A man's heart has changed, A man's heart has asked for forgiveness in front of the world for words spoken 11 years ago. What he said was wrong, no doubt, but I'm not letting those words minimize the actions of Hillary and what she wants this country to become. I choose to support Trump even with his flaws, they make him real, it makes him a person that can relate with most of us that want to be better. To be better than what you are today you have to look in the mirror. He may not like what he sees, but I my opinion, he is changing for the better. I will support anyone who looks in the mirror, recognize his issues, and makes true changes to better themselves. Hillary would never admit these things. She is perfect compared to anyone in her mind.
5 | Deborah Thibodeaux Guidry | 10154713479741336_10154713496556336 | All I had to hear her say was that she wanted to uphold Roe v Wade- that in and of itself is enough reason for me not to vote for her - not that I was even thinking about it

7 | Juan Villacis | 10154713479741336_10154713491516336 | As American hispanics, we are tired of how all of these coward racist liberals that hate America like Obama, Clinton, and their supporters are trying to turn this great country into a 3rd world one. Unfortunately, one of the biggest problems we have right now is the media and entertainment that are always trying to tell us how to think. They have created enough imbeciles that would re-elect a failure like Obama. Even more, we're supposed to bow down to anti-American Obama, love liberal policies no matter how destructive they are, love bigger enslaving government, and be in favor of illegal immigration because of the color of our skin... disgusting. That's why we support Donald Trump. Show everyone your support for Trump by buying the fantastic Trump Strong t-shirt at: www.teespring.com/trumpstrong .And let's Make America Great Again! Thank you.

9 | Zach Kerman | 10154713479741336_10154713491206336 | Trump should offer to help pardon Julian Assange right now and recognize him for the brave hero that he is.

13 | Wayne R Johnson | 10154713479741336_10154713502831336 | When you have No Resemblance of Ethics, Morals or Truth you get Hillary Clinton. Vote TRUMP/PENCE By Voting for Hillary you share in the assurance that unborn babies will continue to be killed. You share in her choice of Judges. You share in their decisions on the bench. When our streets are full of terrorist after the floodgates of immigration are opened you have yourself to thank, When your daughters are sharing locker rooms and bathrooms with cross gender boys or men you will have your vote to thank. When you're told you're breaking the law to stand with Gods word because someone believes it discriminates, you are responsible. When your weapons of defense are outlawed you can look in the mirror and know it was by your vote.

17 | Geri Ramsier | 10154713479741336_982607328518335 | Commentator did not let Trump finish anything, rudely interrupted Trump over and over. Hilliary read script and commentator few times softly gave appearance of trying to stop her, but let Hillary go on and on and on. Worst of debates for commentator unfairness and do believe unfair and I am not Trump fan. I think Fox being republican leaning went out of way to appear not Trump favoring to end up unfair to Trump. Media bias or just sexual bias?

24 | Dennis Jones | 10154713479741336_982637711848630 | Republicans will lose in a blowout. Trump is going down. Republicans will lose Senate and 25-35 house seats.  Bernie Sanders will be Senate budget leader. Hillary will put  obama on the supreme Court.
25 | Karolyn Hall Marino | 10154713479741336_10154713573001336 | Tell Chris Wallace to stop the train wreck... he never successfully stops Hillary. She rolls right over him every time! He's creating a mess because Trump watched and learned.

22 | Samantha Krier | 10154713468186336_10154713507871336 | Another terrible Clinton idea. Her higher minimum wage will kill small businesses. Free education. Given me a break. Nothing is free in our world. Someone is paying for it. Obama promised same thing. 8 years later nothing. She is gonna raise taxes. She isn't going to lower them.
23 | Andreas Klingmann | 10154713468186336_10154713474026336 | Apparently, many Americans don't realize what's at stake in this election. You think Donald Trump is a racist. You think Donald Trump is hostile to women. And yet, you have no problem to vote for a warmonger. You have no problem to vote for a woman who doesn't flinch at corruption, extortion, theft, murder and abuse of power. You are the reason that America is in bad odour in terms of education. What do you think will happen if Hillary Clinton becomes president? Hillary Clinton will not create jobs. People will fall into despair, riots and lootings will increase and consequently a civil war would erupt. America would destroy itself. The government would have no choice but to continue to incite wars and sell weapons. America has no major allies. China and Russia are not allies of America. She claims that Russia is the aggressor. The Russians are not the ones to incite wars. This woman doesn't know what she's talking about. She criticized Donald Trump because he knows nothing about foreign policy, but she would only make a lot of enemies. And quite frankly, I'd rather have Russia as an ally than America. And Hillary Clinton's motto, STRONGER TOGETHER, is a complete joke, downright ridiculous. And everyone who believes in it is a complete and utter fool. America is already unpopular and with Hillary Clinton as president, you will have no more allies. You will have NO ONE. You will lose everything. This election is not just about America's future. It's about this world's future as well. Hillary Clinton poses a threat to Europe and the rest of the world. She wouldn't contribute to global peace, just like Obama and his predecessor, Bush. She would carry on their work to destabilize the Middle East, resulting in an outbreak of war on European soil. If Hillary Clinton actually manages to win, I would call for drastic consequences from our politicians. I would demand all US troops stationed in Germany and the rest of Europe to be kicked out and be replaced by Russian troops. If Hillary Clinton wins, we Europeans are going to need Russia more than ever. No one wants to f--ck with Russia. The Russians aren't the bad guys. Your government makes you believe that Russia is the enemy. Everyone knows that except Hillary Clinton supporters. They don't know what's happening in the world. Wake up! For cripes' sake!To the Trump supporters: You're doing the right thing. You know what's happening in the world, you see the corruption, you see the bigger picture. Keep it up comrades!Best regards from Germany!
24 | Margaret Blaylock | 10154713468186336_10154713507936336 | Doesn't take long listening to Hillary to understand that under her "leadership" we will slide further and further down socialism's slippery slope.
25 | Rita Lovett | 10154713468186336_10154713489176336 | Abortion is murder and God Almighty told me that it was murder and a woman has to Repent of Murder! That baby has a life and it needs to be respected as a human being! Nobody has the RIGHT to PLAY GOD!!!

--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Donald Wellner | 10154712497151336_10154712515231336 | If Hillary wins we all need to show up in mass numbers to D.C. And make a statement! She can't be president! If she wins we know our government is corrupt and rigged even worse than we thought
2 | Ron Folkerts | 10154712497151336_1288814861151255 | I never told this to anybody but... Hillary Clinton touched me inappropriately when we were under heavy sniper fire in Nicaragua... :/
3 | Brenda Torres | 10154712497151336_1288782087821199 | I can't watch it...I am having a hard time imagining four more years of a Smug Democrat Administration attacking our Christian Values and Spending, Spending, Spending....
4 | Lori Collins Smith | 10154712497151336_10154712610056336 | Fox News is my last option for news so if Chris Wallace blows it tonight and shows his butt and his on Hillary side I'm done with Fox. So there you go Fox
5 | Joyce Krebs | 10154712497151336_10154712663891336 | I don't watch Megyn Kelly. Evidently, a lot of other people don't either! Latest news is that her ratings, like the NFL's, are tanking!
6 | Regina Kennell | 10154712497151336_1847452408821969 | Clinton wants to kill babies through planned parenthood. She feels this is fine. But worries about toddlers and the second ammednant. WTH.
7 | Ron Mitchell | 10154712497151336_1003818319728975 | One minute she wants to save dozens of children a year from guns then the next she says she supports killing kids in the womb
8 | Lisa Hannon-Osborne | 10154712497151336_1799312450339355 | Why should we give illegals free health care and free rent when we ourselves can afford it screw her she's a liar ,she should be in jail
9 | Pam Whitlock Smith | 10154712497151336_10154712551471336 | I tried watching the Fox pre debate but I changed the channel to one American news. Cannot watch that liberal Shephard Smith
10 | Nancy Purpura Penton | 10154712497151336_1128254617244428 | We don't want the opinions of idiot commentators like Megyn Kelly, Juan Williams, Julie Roginsky, Geraldo, Shep. I'll be watching it on OAN. One American News..
11 | Mekenna Yohe | 10154712497151336_10154712663216336 | Already know she's a lying, scheming, low down dirty "lady" (putting it nicely) who doesn't deserve to be running for POTUS. She's not getting my vote so no need to put myself through the pain.
12 | Erin Flynn Smelser | 10154712497151336_1314753381869254 | How was Donald suppose to do anything he wasn't in politics, she was!  For 30 years!
13 | Lendon Bracewell | 10154712497151336_1690214611217153 | I had a dream last night that Hillary Clinton won the election and..well let me just say it wasn't a dream, it was a nightmare.
14 | Javier Nino | 10154712497151336_933923123418600 | If Hillary hates the UNBORN child, she should not be running for president, because the UNBORN child is the future of America.
15 | Jackie Beyer | 10154712497151336_1820132081564441 | Hillary Clinton takes money from wall street and the rich! She is bought and paid for! She will never change things for the better.
16 | Arthur Kemper | 10154712497151336_1006609516132557 | Deplorable Mexican-American Catholic Redneck Irredeemable from Florida checking in!
17 | Alysse Shane Ricks | 10154712497151336_10154712556176336 | get rid of shep and i'll think about it. he's crossed the line between news and commentary. FOXNEWS is no more trustworthy than cnn and msnbc at this point. shame on you!
18 | Kt McFarland | 10154712497151336_888848434585345 | Hillary against tax cuts - but every time US cut taxes - 1920s, 1960s, 1980s, we have had major growth within two years.
19 | Duane N Kyle Pavel | 10154712497151336_1488991557783906 | Hillary you had years to grow the economy.Nothing happened.
20 | Kt McFarland | 10154712497151336_1769411783308306 | so far real winner is Chris Wallace - he's doing excellent job of moderating without taking sides.
21 | Judge Jeanine Pirro | 10154712497151336_557617934362930 | Intelligence surge? That's gonna make us win now?

23 | Kim Nable | 10154712497151336_1818370491712519 | Any person in their sober and sound mind would not vote for a Corrupt Criminal that has cost the lives of others and betrayed Americans.
24 | Mary Meeks | 10154712497151336_1818400125042889 | I'll watch the debate, but forget the "talk" afterward! I know what I hear and what I see.  Don't need the corrupt media to tell me what I hear and see.
25 | Geraldo Rivera | 10154712497151336_888828384587350 | The right of a woman to choose abortion, the old divider in the USA, is now clearly laid bare as a fundamental issue this election cycle.

A former Arkansas TV reporter claimed for the first time Wednesday that former President Bill Clinton sexually assaulted her in 1980.

1 | Giulio Braga | 10154713063331336_10154713178351336 | When your own government lies to you, and the media lies to you, and the GOP has more to do with the Big Liar, what do you have left??? .....TRUMP!!! all the way!!!! #Trump2016
2 | Mark Deda | 10154713063331336_10154713182111336 | " I hear that train a comin‚ÄôIt‚Äôs rollin‚Äô round the bend.Gonna pick up Mrs. ClintonAnd take her to the pen.They‚Äôll have her coronationMake her cell block queenHillary for prisontwo thousand and sixteenThey‚Äôve got an orange pants suitHangin‚Äô on the wallAnd a cell for Bubba WillieJust a little down the hall.We‚Äôll put ‚Äòem in the big houseLock them up inside.Unless a whole lot of witnessesCommit suicide.Remember James McDougalAnd 20 or 30 moreAbout to testify, they found ‚Äòem dead upon the floor.Now they‚Äôre pilin‚Äô up the bodiesLike they did back thenThey want back in the White HouseHere we go again.Glue the china to the tableNail the table to the floorLock up all the silver‚Äòfore they haul it out the doorWhite trash in the White HouseBeats all I‚Äôve ever seen.Hillary for prisontwo thousand and sixteen
3 | Rodney B Wooten | 10154713063331336_10154713185691336 | Duh..he has done it for years..the only reason Hillary is with him is for her political career..what "strong" woman would put herself through this guys litany of sexual encounters unless there was an agenda..
4 | Barry Verrico | 10154713063331336_10154713188496336 | Turn FOXNews on for minute Megan's talking about sexual allegations against trump change the channel go back 10 minutes later she still freaking talking about sexual allegations against trump please FOXNews get rid of this woman unless you're paying her to say it is that possible
5 | Sallie Raymond-Mullinger | 10154713063331336_10154713200441336 | Someone needs to let Murdoch know that Megyn Kelly is not who we, the viewers, want to see on FOX. Is she a shill working for the Dems?Could not believe her just now arguing with Mike Pence about one of the bimbo allegations aimed at Trump. She actually interrupted him twice!I never see her arguing with a Dem pundit with that kind of vehemence.We wont watch her show in our home and its getting to the point where we wont watch anything else with her on it.I hate that shes involved in the debate tonight. She is anything but fair and balanced when it comes to Trump.
6 | Jay Wagner | 10154713063331336_10154713187066336 | So ? What's gonna happen to Bill, ? Nothing at all...now if it was Trump.. Whoa!!! Now that would be non stop, wall to wall trashing Trump.. And Fox is as bad as the rest of them.. U can't get fair straight just the news in this country ..
7 | Shane Dawson | 10154713063331336_10154713182426336 | If Trump wins,everyone will pay a fair and honest price for some tacos. If Hillary wins she will give away free tacos to all who vote for her & then charge all us tax payers $10 dollars a taco! It's true. I saw this in one of her deleted emails that they found on a blown up computer in Benghazi!  It's all on video!
8 | Amy Woodmansee | 10154713063331336_10154713188341336 | Democrats on Bill Clinton: "That was years ago, she must be lying." Democrats on Trump: "Nope, it's true. Doesn't matter how long ago it was."
9 | SD Buckland | 10154713063331336_10154713183841336 | So the liberal argument will be "it's a lie because she waited so long to come forward" while at the same time saying "it doesn't matter how long she waited, Trump assaulted her"
10 | Mark Jones | 10154713063331336_10154713176561336 | Looking forward to tonight's final debate. This is what America is all about folks. Anyone with enough drive, and ambition, like Trump, can become President of the United States of America. Against every conceivable odds against him, the corrupt Obama administration, the corrupt Soros funded Clinton machine, the CORRUPT MEDIA, and even the corrupted establishment GOP, Trump will be our next POTUS because real Americans are sick and tired of democrats trying to run the show and failing on nearly every account the last 8 years. History will remember 2016 as the year Trump turned our once balanced system that was created by our founding fathers back to order once again for all. Go Trump/Pence 2016! üá∫üá∏
11 | George Pattron | 10154713063331336_10154713180516336 | I believe it would be easier to count the women Bill Clinton DIDN'T sexually assault.
12 | William Paddison | 10154713063331336_10154713208791336 | A former Arkansas TV reporter claimed for the first time Wednesday that former President Bill Clinton sexually assaulted her in 1980.Leslie Millwee, formerly a local news reporter at KLMN-TV, alleges that on three separate occasions, the then-Arkansas governor touched her inappropriately in a secluded editing room at the TV station.Bill Clinton is such a pig!!!!
13 | Pam McFarlen | 10154713063331336_1139450432802623 | It's obvious! Those who accuse Trump are victims and on a path to sainthood. Those who accuse Bill Clinton took advantage of him, seduced him, and according to Joy Behar are "tramps". The media also plays the double standard. I don't believe any of these women would have waited until this few days before election to speak of these assaults. Why not filing lawsuits, charges years before now?
14 | Shane Howell | 10154713063331336_10154713239231336 | I honestly walked into the middle of this report on Fox News and thought "oh crap, this one for some reason sounds and looks legit" like she is telling the truth...thinking it was another one coming out against Trump...
15 | Tim McKnight | 10154713063331336_10154713179231336 | We all know what happened to everyone else back then when they has something to say about the Clintons.... They all commited suicide.
16 | Brenen Oakley Dukeman | 10154713063331336_10154713227106336 | Of course another one was going to come forward and that assinine Meygan Kelly just keeps saying it over and over...but when Pence or aneyone else starts saying something about Trump she cuts them off.  Is she going to be running her mouth through the whole debate?  Could she llike go to her room?
17 | Lilly Stanga Rose | 10154713063331336_10154713240371336 | Please Fox News you are becoming a disappointment. Show the facts I'm intelligent enough to figure it out my self. Good Lord you're becoming a bias network . I left CNN, ABC, MSNBC, NBC for the fair and balanced network. You're opinions need to be kept to yourself
18 | Betty Sizemore | 10154713063331336_10154713206376336 | I'm shocked to the core to thank bill Clinton would do this I don't know if I can get over this but I will try to get my self together mean while Trump all the way president 2016 üá±üá∑üá±üá∑üéâ
19 | Betty Galloway | 10154713063331336_1623199017982118 | You know what? I'm so tired of women suddenly coming forward about something that happened to them years ago. There ought to be a statute of limitations on how long after a crime is committed that it can be reported. You know, if you are to weak or stupid to claim it when it happens you really shouldn't be whining about it 10,20,30 years later.
20 | Shandy Elliott | 10154713063331336_1623201881315165 | I see that Juan Williams is on the panel again. I don't understand what you people see in him. Is it a demographic thing? He is THE most argumentative and unreasonable person on your panels, and he is almost enough for me to turn the channel when I see him.
21 | Gwendle Burks | 10154713063331336_10154713248636336 | I'm a total Trump person, but I have to say this. AllThese women need to stop. They make the victims of sexual assault look bad. If this woman would of come forward when he was governor then ok. Now coming out of the woodwork is little off the wall. I feel the same of the ones that came after Trump. This needs to stop!
22 | Tricia Parten Richardson | 10154713063331336_10154713280976336 | Wow. Why is this such a trend now? If I ever get sexually assaulted I'm definitely going to wait 25 or 30 years before I tell anyone. You know, just in case he decides to run for president.
23 | Roger Dodson | 10154713063331336_10154713246601336 | Why  can't everyone get this through their HEADS. Bill Clinton is NOT running for President period. This lady if there is any TRUTH to her claims, has NOTHING to do with Hillary Clinton running for President. And of all days to come forth on this lie, the very day of this last debate!!
24 | Brian Mesias | 10154713063331336_1139453469468986 | She's accusing Bill Clinton!!! Liar!! Can't be true!!! The clintons would never do anything like this!!! It's only a matter of time before Hilary comes out and destroys her life now!
25 | Linda Weyandt | 10154713063331336_1623277691307584 | Arkansas, the Clintons finest moments......Hillaryfails her DC bar exam, Bill gets caught screwing other women and lying unde oath and disbarred! They use the n word! Lmao!

The Cleveland Indians are World Series-bound after defeating the Toronto Blue Jays in five games to win their first American League pennant since 1997. Cleveland wrapped up the series with a 3-0 victory in Game 5.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Rebecca Leigh Randolph | 10154713060681336_10154713065866336 | Next Tuesday is officially going to be the craziest night in Cleveland history when game 1 of the World Series and the Cavs season opener where they get their rings are both on the same night!!
2 | Tim Wilson | 10154713060681336_10154713066941336 | Before this year, the Cavs & the Indians combined to win 2 titles in 156 tries. They now could win 2 titles in four months.
3 | Doug Griffith | 10154713060681336_10154713070566336 | Congrats to the Cleveland Indians from a Blue Jays fan.  You deserved it and I wish you well.
4 | Steve Schira | 10154713060681336_10154713107926336 | Megy Kelly go to CNN ..you ,Brit Hume and all the back stabbers at Fox .....actually just move out of the country because of you and you liberal co-workers at Fox I no longer watch Fox.....thanks for destroying the only channel left for conservatives
5 | Jon Perkins | 10154713060681336_10154713157876336 | Juan Williams on Fox News is lying thru his teeth. He just tried to argue that the tapes just released of the people that went to Trumps rallies to incite riots. It is right there on tape Juan. The top person has visited Obama‚Äôs White House over 300 times. Give me a break, You can't even hold your head up cuz you know you are being paid off by Clinton to be her spokesperson on Fox. You disgust me and you judgment day will come.
6 | Pat Neff | 10154713060681336_10154713106871336 | What a year for Cleveland....a successful national convention, the Cavs title and now the Tribe going to the series. Way to go Cleveland!!!
7 | Mitchell Lawson | 10154713060681336_10154713072886336 | You Hilary Supporters are being deceived daily. A vote for Hilary is a vote for Bill Clinton, Bill has been impeached from the White House, by law he should not be able to return to the Hill as First lady or First man, he sourly is not a Gentleman. Just another way for Bill to sneak through the back door with 30 more years of Hell in the United States of America.
8 | Brian Shales | 10154713060681336_10154713137201336 | Congratulations from a Blue Jay fan in Canada. Cleveland was the better team. Awesome pitching, clutch hitting and a very smart Manager. Good Luck in the World Series. Should be a great one!
9 | Sarah Stiegel | 10154713060681336_10154713966076336 | 8 Generations ago my direct relative, Col. Christopher Truby risked his life fighting the British in the American Revolution.  Today, nearly 240+ years later I find myself saddened by the state of our great country.  I have always felt pride being an American, a patriot, however at this time I'm almost embarrassed and most definitely saddened.  Our country has regressed 270+ years to a state where we need to overthrow our governing body.  Don't you remember learning in American history "no taxation without representation".?  Don't you remember the pride you felt learning how our founding fathers drafted such amazing documents like the Declaration of Independence and most importantly the Constitution of the United States?  Our fore-fathers died for those documents, those beliefs.  Now today 270+ years later our basic rights that we fought for are at stake and it sickens me to see how many people are willing to throw it all away.  This election isn't about taxes, immigration, or abortion, this election is about our basic American rights.  We are at risk of losing our guaranteed rights thanks to a corrupt woman and her ulterior motives.  I'm voting for America, for our founding fathers, for our Bill of Rights, for our Freedoms, for the best country in the world.  This isn't about race/ethnicity this is about US, as Americans, standing up for US, the greatest nation of the modern world.  We need to bring back unity, we need to be proud Americans.  It's time to stand up, with our right hand over our heart and proudly state "one God, indivisible, in liberty and justice for ALL".  Protect our America, our freedom.  Vote TRUMP 2016
10 | Christine Hollis | 10154713060681336_10154713341486336 | Yay!!!! If the Royals couldn't make it this year, I'm glad it's another AL Central team and ANY team other than the Blue Jays.
11 | Irving Bobby | 10154713060681336_10154713243801336 | Yes Sir. Buckeyes, Indians Cavs and Stipe with the UFC! Never mind about our Browns. They installed a quarterback vending machine in the locker room.
12 | Jason Anthony | 10154713060681336_10154713426401336 | Sometimes whenever I eat M&Ms, I like to hold two M&Ms in between my fingers and squeeze as hard as I can until one M&M cracks, I eat the cracked one, and the one that didn't crack becomes the champion. Then I grab another M&M and force it to compete with the champion in this deadly game of M&M gladiators. I do this until I run out of M&Ms and when there is only one M&M left standing, I send a letter to M&Ms brand with the champion M&M in it with a note attached that reads: "please use this M&M for breeding purposes."
13 | Renee Riley Keeling | 10154713060681336_10154713166931336 | Megyn Kelly needs to lay off the "tape" of course those women are describing everything on the tape because they heard the tape!!! Megyn go to CNN!!
14 | Paul Stuart | 10154713060681336_10154713198881336 | Whats up with FOX right now just before the debate.Megan Kelly and Baer just talking about Trump and all of those corrupted women claiming assault,barely anything about HITLERY....DISGUSTING FAUX NEWS AND KELLY....
15 | Julio Abdiel Fuentes Castillo | 10154713060681336_10154713070051336 | Congratulations to the Cleveland Indians but you will have a hard team to play called Los Angeles Dodgers.
16 | Sandra Fore | 10154713060681336_10154713065626336 | Congrats to Cleveland. What a year for that City. Now lets go Cubs.
17 | Dale Berkebile | 10154713060681336_10154713090421336 | What's next? Cleveland Browns win the rest of their games and win the Superbowl?
18 | David Maris | 10154713060681336_10154713099611336 | Congrats Cleveland!!!!!!!!  Two championships in one year what are you going to do next?  Good luck in the World series
19 | Tena Wood | 10154713060681336_10154713070266336 | Congrats Cleveland Indians. Good luck in the World Series. Bring it home. So glad you beat Toronto Blue Jays. Good luck from a die hard Yankees fanüç∫üç∫üç∫üç∫.
20 | Nick Beirl | 10154713060681336_10154713094961336 | Cleveland is looking like the city of champions. And where was the RNC held this year? That's right. #TrumpTrain
21 | Franklin M. Porter | 10154713060681336_10154713126221336 | BASEBALL'S BORING. How about Trump desperately blaming EVERYTHING AND EVERYONE, but himself for his dramatic drop in the UPCOMING election. "He's dropping fast, REALLY FAST." NEVER HAS A BASE SHRUNK SO FAST, SO VERY, VERY FAST.
22 | Patricia Terrell Williams | 10154713060681336_10154713068726336 | They must have had "Wild Thing" pitching for them!! :)
23 | Chuck Fink | 10154713060681336_10154713169036336 | One of my favorite movies is Major League this is great I hope they win it all
24 | Logan Radcliff | 10154713060681336_10154713206931336 | The last time i remember watching an Indians game was when Charlie Sheen pitched for them in Big League.
25 | John Millin | 10154713060681336_10154713073116336 | Congratulations from a Royals fan!  Keep that trophy in the AL Central!!

"He's making that effort, where so many ... that have legs, that could stand, are sitting or kneeling and not using their 'well legs' to stand and respect those who have fought and died for our flag and for our country," the teen's uncle said.

I have a feeling the elections will be rigged too. 2 times ,a president was elected by the votes of Superdelegates backed by least amount of voters. Is this your democracy? Also, Americans get mad when foreigners get involved and share their opinions in America's elections but America always in our business during our elections and they are always in many other countries' businesses too.
2 | Giulio Braga | 10154712655401336_10154712975706336 | He is a giant compared to bored OVERPAID idiots that are too weak to understand the value of Freedom, and the value of the lives lost to protect that Freedom - God bless HIM THOUSANDS TIMES !!!!
3 | Tyler Schumann | 10154712655401336_10154712972101336 | Yet, rich athletes feel the need to knee because they're "oppressed." Gotta love the new America. God bless this teen and God bless the USA.
4 | Tracy Dennis | 10154712655401336_10154712991541336 | White teens, kids, men, and women are not being gunned down by a racist police force.  Screw him and the flag, and the police, and the people who do not like blacks sitting during the national anthem.Stop killing black people: #BlackLivesMatter!
5 | Karen Henderson Maxwell | 10154712655401336_10154712994516336 | If this young person can stand, so can others that could stop whining and take responsibiliy for their own lives.
6 | Randy Winton | 10154712655401336_10154713169881336 | Megyn Kelly is at it again.  She argued with Pence about voter fraud in Phili.  She said there were just a few precincts in which there were 0 votes for Romney--Actually, there were 59.  Even more interesting is that there were a few registered Republicans in those districts.  When reporters went looking for them they were either "gone" and long time residents had never heard their names.  Wonder where those mail-in ballots went?
7 | Jody Beadle | 10154712655401336_10154713133396336 | The following are a few basic historical facts that every American should know.Fact: The Republican Party was founded primarily to oppose slavery, and Republicans eventually abolished slavery. The Democratic Party fought them and tried to maintain and expand slavery. The 13th Amendment, abolishing slavery, passed in 1865 with 100% Republican support but only 23% Democrat support in congress.
8 | Sarah Stiegel | 10154712655401336_10154713966611336 | 8 Generations ago my direct relative, Col. Christopher Truby risked his life fighting the British in the American Revolution.  Today, nearly 240+ years later I find myself saddened by the state of our great country.  I have always felt pride being an American, a patriot, however at this time I'm almost embarrassed and most definitely saddened.  Our country has regressed 270+ years to a state where we need to overthrow our governing body.  Don't you remember learning in American history "no taxation without representation".?  Don't you remember the pride you felt learning how our founding fathers drafted such amazing documents like the Declaration of Independence and most importantly the Constitution of the United States?  Our fore-fathers died for those documents, those beliefs.  Now today 270+ years later our basic rights that we fought for are at stake and it sickens me to see how many people are willing to throw it all away.  This election isn't about taxes, immigration, or abortion, this election is about our basic American rights.  We are at risk of losing our guaranteed rights thanks to a corrupt woman and her ulterior motives.  I'm voting for America, for our founding fathers, for our Bill of Rights, for our Freedoms, for the best country in the world.  This isn't about race/ethnicity this is about US, as Americans, standing up for US, the greatest nation of the modern world.  We need to bring back unity, we need to be proud Americans.  It's time to stand up, with our right hand over our heart and proudly state "one God, indivisible, in liberty and justice for ALL".  Protect our America, our freedom.  Vote TRUMP 2016
9 | Ma Dukes | 10154712655401336_10154713045286336 | I know some people who stand for the flag all the time.  The national anthem too.  And they are the worse people I know .  Un-american, selfish, discriminatory, hate mongers, anti-democracy, no compassion, cowards, violent, wife beaters, etc.  Props for the young man for doing what he wanted to do, under difficult circumstances..  But I cant get the connection between standing for flags and songs, and patriotism. I think the standard for being a patriot should be higher than that.  Props to the military who fight for our freedom to stand or not stand, to protest and not protest, and to push to make this country better.
10 | Keith Clay | 10154712655401336_10154713016046336 | Actually no one dies for the flag, they die for what the flag stands for. Which is you're freedom of speech and expression. So those who choose not to stand have that right under the constitution. Like it or not.
11 | Candice Moore | 10154712655401336_10154713009676336 | I work with the elderly and the other day one of the women told me of a story about how when her husband was in the army (can't rember the name) he and the rest of the troops went to get something to eat in uniform and was turned away because they didn't serve negros they didn't care that he was serving his country or putting his life on the line when older black people tell me these stories of things they actually experienced it makes me feel that much more proud to see someone take a knee or sit in a locker room
12 | Joseph Matthews | 10154712655401336_10154713063746336 | No disrespect to the presidential 'debate' tonight, but if you don't know who you're going to vote for by now, I have some property in an alligator-infested swamp in Florida I'd like to sell you. I want a strong military, less taxes and regulations, to cut regulations that burden businesses, land owners and consumers, for the U.S. to retain its sovereignty and not hand it over to U.S.-hating groups like the United Nations, to fully support our friends in Israel, to eliminate loopholes that allow the rich to escape paying taxes and to have a president who will praise law enforcement over violent rioters and protesters and those who seek to harm the police, to have Supreme Court justices who will uphold the U.S. Constitution, and most importantly to be able to have the freedom to worship Jesus Christ without the long arm of the government looming over me. For me, it's a pretty simple choice.
13 | Alvah B. Carlson Jr | 10154712655401336_10154713142491336 | Florida is experiencing a first for voting and Republicans. For what may be the very first time in Florida, a Republican is ahead in the polls leading up to the election that decides the next President of the United States.That man is Donald Trump and he‚Äôs not winning by a few points, he‚Äôs winning by a long shot! He‚Äôs up 120,000 in early voting in Florida. That‚Äôs A LOT if you ask me. If he was winning by 12, then I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs not a big decisive number. However, 120,000 is YUGE and Hillary will need a lot of help from undocumented illegal immigrant voters to catch up.
14 | Larry Phillips | 10154712655401336_10154713110261336 | I'm sitting here listening and watching the news and you guy's are sitting there and talking about all the sexual affairs going on and you don't let up, for christ sakes is there or is there nothing to report if there is go legal or shut the hell up.
15 | Steven Myles Rothacker | 10154712655401336_10154713042986336 | Why do you keep putting on the left.. with their lies and dont challenge them.. SHAME.. your just another mouth piece for them... Either challenge them as much as the MSM challenges any GOP politician or stop having them on your channel.. Conservatives have nowhere to turn when you put these idiots on TV
16 | Doranne Vega | 10154712655401336_10154713416606336 | God bless this young man. Unlike the disrespectful over paid athletes who do not have respect for their freedom to earn an obscene amount of money. No athletes anywhere else on this planet are paid as well as these entitled jerks
17 | Chris Osborne | 10154712655401336_10154713004581336 | Anyone seen what is happening at CNN? Protestors are so loud you can hardly hear the panel speak. They are paying for their bias reporting big time.
18 | Karen Paxton | 10154712655401336_10154713343371336 | No they know they are above the law now because of Obama and black lives matter there are blacks and there are African American people the blacks need more parenting skills less dead beat dads an education, and so on they are mostly thugs look at Chicago! They kill echother everyday kids, moms, animals are what they are yes I'm as racist as they come against black thugs.
19 | Bob Smothers | 10154712655401336_10154713176146336 | Good for him but so what?  It is awesome that he showed his respect but stop patronizing people because they are in a wheelchair! Oh look he is disabled and he still stands when other people refuse to do so.Is this supposed to be some feel good mushy crap because the kid is wheelchair bound?
20 | Alec Gormley | 10154712655401336_10154713049801336 | Joining the military back in the day was the ticket to success a job to get ahead with. The GI bill and free college all you had to do is love your country.
21 | Harry Shaw | 10154712655401336_10154713143546336 | This is how a real American respects our flag! It is ashamed how some people have no respect for an American tradition and don't have enough honor to give thanks to the people of the past that gives him the chance to play a game and get paid by the fans of the sport and he turns around and spits in America's face! That young man in this story is the real American!

1 | Remy Holleman | 10154711860686336_10154712848991336 | I just don't get it !!! They know she is guilty of several things but yet no one has filed charges against her ! How can she even be allowed to run for presidency ! And how DUMB and ignorant can you be to vote for a lying corrupt devil! You should be ashamed! The founders of the United States are turning their backs in their graves! #Trump2016
2 | Granny Goodwitch | 10154711860686336_10154712863926336 | God she thinks she is so great look at her stupid face. I can't stand her or that she is a woman she is giving woman a very bad name. vote Trump/Pence and maybe the first woman president will be someone who actually loves America.
3 | Earl Franklin Clemons Jr | 10154711860686336_10154712847101336 | What ever these Wikileaks are, one thing is for certain. They demonstrate that all of the content of the traffic traversing HELLary rotten Clinton's private server while she was on the taxpayers' payroll must be considered to have been compromised and that makes her guilty of espionage. The appropriate punishment must be forthcoming,,,,,,,,,,
4 | Thomas Callahan | 10154711860686336_10154712901811336 | What I don't get we impeached Nixon for spying on the DNC (Watergate)! Now this dam Country is gonna to elect someone that committed crimes far worse then Nixon.
5 | Ryan Vanek | 10154711860686336_10154712848281336 | Trump needs a miracle tonight to persuade all the idiots believing the MSM/Hillary agenda.Get back to the issues, focus on her lies, and hope for the best.
6 | Gary Vicki Browning | 10154711860686336_10154712905781336 | Trump is winning and the media and hillary know it...just get the vote out everyone...that's when we speak...and in the end, we end her illegal campaign and the media's collusion...finally we end the greedy gravy train in DC...
7 | Sandy Golay | 10154711860686336_10154712910921336 | Just because she wasn't charged doesn't mean she is innocent. Our "bought and paid for" FBI director, James Comey, spelled it out. He told what she did, and then said he wouldn't recommend charging her. They both should be charged! Hillary, at the very least should lose her security clearance.
8 | Gil Viator | 10154711860686336_10154712922736336 | I personally don't get how anyone who values females prefers Clinton over Trump. Trump's locker-room talk was just a case of Trump being a guy. I've talked that way too. Most fellas have. However, the one thing the majority of us men don't do is go and sexually assault multiple women like Bill Clinton did. What Trump joked about, Bill actually did....several times. (By the way - I am well aware that Bill's not running for president, but he's going to be living in the White House if his wife wins the election.)
9 | Frank Caputo Sr. | 10154711860686336_10154712877991336 | Stop watching the media, without funds they will wither and die. Time for peer to peer communication as in Colonial times. US Media and government can no longer be trusted. Even the Pope has been compromised. If Hilary Clinton is elected we will never know the full extent of all crimes that the Clintons, Obama and their cronies have committed against the American people. We do know that these acts are traitorous in nature and have compromised the FBI and other intelligence agencies. If you support Hilary Clinton in this election you are aiding and abetting in high crimes against the American people and should be treated as such!! Do you know a Clinton supporter? Let them know how you feel. I will not talk too, associate with, purchase from or have anything to do with a Clinton supporter in any way shape or form. Do the same and they should get the message. Time to defeat Wall Street, as well as the Political and Media elite with one blow!! I'm an Independent and I stand strong behind Donald Trump!! TRUMP üá±üá∑ PENCE 2016!!Stop Americas destruction by liberal loons and Conservative power trips!

11 | Barbara Bombard | 10154711860686336_10154712929681336 | She had to prepare and practice because when you've told so many lies you can't remember what to say so she has to make sure she practices and practices and practices! She can't just speak off the top of her head because she would probably screw up so bad, because she doesn't remember which lies she told. Trump just speaks how he thinks and doesn't need to practice what he's going to say. He just answers the questions and speaks exactly how he feels.
12 | Kim King Clayton | 10154711860686336_1786773914895951 | Why is Megyn Kelly reporting on Fox now?!  Her hour is the 8/9 o'clock time. I would rather watch CNN, than Megyn Kelly! I won't be watching debate on Fox News channel. She's way too liberal, and clearly not a Trump supporter
13 | Sheri Maurer | 10154711860686336_1110152672435312 | Meghan Kelly just said she doesn't understand about media bias!  She's no too bright!Fox News you can do better than having her on!
14 | Joseph Esteves | 10154711860686336_10154712880931336 | Why is anyone going to watch this debate. We all know Donald Trump is going to be rude and Arrogant. He has ZERO class. We know he is going to speak out or turn and interrupt. And we know tomorrow morning TRUMP and everyone of his Surrogates aka Cronies is going to say he won the debate. So again why are we watching it?
15 | Sandy Carter | 10154711860686336_10154712905216336 | The Legislative Branch is being run by the Executive Branch. She's untouchable. Until Trump wins. Then Katy bar the door. Let the grand jury begin!
16 | Tonee VanderVliet | 10154711860686336_10154712865766336 | The only thing is she debates better- she has 30 years experience!  She should debate better, but doesn't make her smarter, or ethical or a patriot!
17 | Gerry Hoehn | 10154711860686336_10154713002246336 | If the media wasnt corrupt and in the tank with Clinton and Obama, she would be destroyed with these leaks that are coming out.  But the media chooses not to talk about them...corruption all around us.  We need to change this now, stand up for a change and get the corruption out of our government.  She should be in jail, and leaks about her Foundation, just as we all suspected, pay to play...and media silent on it.
18 | Patricia DiMaggio Siergiej | 10154711860686336_10154712977546336 | This is from a friends page. I found it thought provoking. I do not care if Donald Trump called a woman fat. I do not care if he tried to sleep with a woman or if he likes "beautiful" women. I care that he sent a plane to pick up 200 Marines who were stranded after desert storm. I care that he supports our police officers and first responders. I care that he supports guns and standing behind our military. I care that he supports the death penalty and is AGAINST abortion. I care that he supports enforcing immigration laws. I care that he wants to destroy radical Islamic groups. I care that he supports COAL. These are things I care about. Him talking sexually about women does not bother me. Were they mean words? Yes. Were they words spoken in PRIVATE? Yes. Have you ever talked to your friends about the opposite sex in private and said things? I'm positive all of you have. But, News Flash!! Women have been sexualized for centuries!! Jay-Z, Lil' Jon, Lil' Wayne and every single other rapper helped establish that platform, but people are ok with music blasted all over the radio degrading women. Ever heard of Victoria Secret? Or their fashion show? Ever heard of Hooters? People are ok with that too. Until all of these things are different, women will be viewed this way. Your precious Obama couldn't change that and Hillary can't either. I feel sorry for the women Donald has belittled and said terrible things about. But I'm still much more offended by what Hillary Clinton has DONE over what Donald Trump has SAID... PERIOD!!!!. But he is speaking the truth! Just because he's not a polished politician like Hillary or Obama doesn't mean he's unqualified to be president. He cares for this country, not growing the size of his pockets. That man has so much money he could never spend it all. He gets NOTHING out of being president! I'm standing for the man accused of saying mean words. I'll never back a woman under three different scandal investigations, possible murder at Benghazi, and the secretive email scandal which has been nothing but lies from the beginning. Since I have to pick between the two:Trump 2016!!!Copy and paste!!! And pass it on #trumpforpresident
19 | Sally Patterson Bernocco | 10154711860686336_1110120189105227 | Fox news- maybe you could put one person on who will call Killary a criminal and say something positive about trump. You are no better than CNN. I cant tell the difference.
20 | John Aichner | 10154711860686336_1110154212435158 | Hillary Clinton is an all out criminal who needs to be locked up in prison she should not even be allowed to run for president of United States this is a travesty of justiceif she is elected president this country is going to go right down the toilet the rest of the way
21 | Mark Ruddy | 10154711860686336_1110128032437776 | Fox news....you blamed Trump for the violence at his rallies. Now you know it was all a set up by the democrats. But you say you can't tie it Hillary. Hypocritical much? The news, all news makes me sick. None of you are real journalist. None.
22 | Kathy Jackson Stevens | 10154711860686336_10154712913061336 | little did we all know just how "prepared" she was..having been given the questions ahead of time so she could prepare her answers #hillaryforprison
23 | William Paddison | 10154711860686336_10154712993486336 | Foval also discusses planting people at rallies for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Those chosen are sent to incite violence and are even given scripts and training, according to Foval.Demcroats up to their old dirty tricks!
24 | Joe Aex | 10154711860686336_1513549822004787 | This has made America a world wide joke.....our enemies are laughing and our allies are crying......what a shame that something as serious as leadership of the most powerful country in the world has been reduced to such trash....I am voting for Trump not because he deserves it because he is the lessor of two evils......GOD help the USA !!
25 | Carlos Snel | 10154711860686336_10154712918861336 | If this devil becomes president, what can we tell our children? A hardcore criminal and corrupt rotten person can become president of the most important nation in the world! No moral, bad example for the young ones! #Trump2016

Donald J. Trump supporter Scott Baio says that if Hillary Clinton is elected president, the people who voted for her have no right to complain about "the demise of the United States of America."
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Keith Webber Jr. | 10154712485351336_10154712666576336 | When your government lies to you and the press lies to you, what do you have left??? .....TRUMP all the way!!!!
2 | Mitzi Davis | 10154712485351336_10154712670351336 | Your vote counts..Hillary is not as far ahead as the media wants you to think. VOTE!!!!
3 | Danny Barker | 10154712485351336_10154712689191336 | When Scott Baio is one of your most vocal celebrities endorsing you, you literally have no chance...Scott Baio lulz!
4 | Sydney Nichols | 10154712485351336_10154712666476336 | Folks, this is the BIGGEST election of our lifetime. SOCIAL MEDIA is crucial because main stream media is telling LIES LIES LIES & MORE LIES. They want you to believe your vote does NOT count. They want you to stay home and NOT vote. They want you to be afraid that you will offend someone on social media if you "share". SHARE, LIKE, SHARE AGAIN the US CONSTITUTION & America's freedom depends on it!LANDSLIDE for TRUMP#TrumpPence2016
5 | Sean Donegan | 10154712485351336_10154712670526336 | That's what i have been telling everyone. People worry about emotional issues first not whats logically needed for our country to continue.
6 | Chris Baugh | 10154712485351336_10154712672326336 | This guy is an idiot.You trump morons actually think our country will become worse like when George W Bush was POTUS..LOL
7 | Skender Boci | 10154712485351336_811200422355802 | I would like to remind Donald Trump that the system is not rigged instead you might lose because you are unfit, unstable, unprepared, a bully, a tax cheat, a pervert, a racist, narcissist, shallow, a person that have no respect for women or disabled people and heartless.Tell me, when are you Mr. Trump going to be locked in jail for scamming millions of out innocent people for fake Trump University degrees.
8 | Marchon Dixon | 10154712485351336_929234690513675 | My head tells me that Trump is totally unfit to be president! He's a thin skinned, arrogant, petulant, undisciplined self-serving opportunistic man. He won't even listen to his own campaign manager!  Not to mention his lack of intelligence.   That's what my head tells me ! BTW, trumps entire campaign is fueled by emotion. Scott Baio is a joke!
9 | Danny DiPietro | 10154712485351336_10154712681366336 | Back in the Charles in Charge days, I always heard rumors that Baio was a douche in real life. I have to say, it would seem those were just rumors. This guy is one of only a few celebrities who totally gets it.
10 | Wayne R Johnson | 10154712485351336_10154712670336336 | The media makes their living focusing on ways to spin words, (rather than maintain the intent) to make their story more interesting. This spin created untrue perceptions of some of Donald trumps words making them sound alienating to some. If the words were NOT twisted with spin by The Clinton campaign and Clinton media the perceived alienation would not exist.Look at the issues Donald Trump has raised in this election!   "Continuing to do the same thing and expecting a different result is ludicrous". We have nothing but corruption, lies, and deceit in our current political arena of status quo. "Especially in Hillary Clinton" Who intends the same O same O policies except; where she can create more personal wealth with a new deception.Trump/Pence offers real change. The corruption is being brought to light and Trump offers a correction in the corrupt portions of our government. This correction scares the so-called "establishment" in both parties. Their pocketbooks and power are threatened. Let's try and make America better againand Vote TRUMP/PENCE
11 | Michael Tyler | 10154712485351336_10154712676621336 | YUP! The entitled, complacent , delusional voters of the corrupt Hillary Clinton hopefully will be humbled a 3rd time around when the find out their choice of candidate didn't do thing for them or for this country.
12 | Jake Styles | 10154712485351336_10154712676106336 | Maybe if he hadn't demonized my people and continue being a douche bag, he'd have more minority support. Pshhhhhh stop voting with emotion.?You think Barack would have been elected had he grouped all whites as being uncaring , cruel and emotionless pieces of scum as trump is?
13 | Kelly Craft Morris | 10154712485351336_1779015785720816 | Scared for my kids & next generation if Hilary Clinton gets elected! Please investigate who you are electing. Don't get your info from NBC, CBS, & ABC. They are totally bias & don't report facts.
14 | Pakalu Papito | 10154712485351336_10154712666756336 | Im naturally funny because my life is a joke
15 | Laurie Davy Kardos | 10154712485351336_10154712701131336 | Exactly!! Your supposed to look at politics logically, not emotionally. But so many base their judgement on emotions.  "Trump said mean things....Trump said something inappropriate 11 years ago.....whine, whine....and they have no clue what the issues really are.....what Nafta is, what are policy in Syria has done with our relationship with Russia, what Globalism is, who George Soros is....we are screwed!!!!!
16 | Chad Roberts | 10154712485351336_10154712711171336 | This election isn't about just the next 4 to 8 years. This president will put 3-4 Supreme Court Justices in the bench. This will effect our country for the next 40-50 years. We know who Trump will nominate he showed his list. True constitutionalist based justices. Hillary won't say who she wants. But it won't be good at all.
17 | Judy DiFranco | 10154712485351336_10154712701666336 | Trying to even have a conversation with a Hillary supporter is like entering the 5th ring of hell. They seem to go into this trance like state.I think it is a cult and it's scary
18 | Darby Morris Herlong | 10154712485351336_10154712710241336 | What was so ignorant was how the democrats poked fun at Scott Baio for not being an A list celebrity. Aren't the words that are spoken what really matter? They had judged the content of his message before he even uttered a word by the status of his celebrity. How many of us are "everyday Americans"? words Hillary reportedly can't stand to even utter? Yet we make up the majority of the nation. We pay for every scam she dreams up. We have lined her pockets. "I want to see some punishment!!!"
19 | Mike West | 10154712485351336_10154712710311336 | I pray Trump wins POTUS but even if he doesn't more Americans are coming to light now. They are finally seeing the corruption and deceit of the government they thought was here to help them. We can all thank Trump for that. If Hillary wins I pray we as Americans can finally come together and purge this evil from our country
20 | Kathy Lee | 10154712485351336_929239697179841 | this idiot should do a little more research.  The Congress and Senate, both run by the repubs, are responsible for rising costs, higher taxes and a multitude of other things that are wrong with country....NOT the President.
21 | Joe Palahunik | 10154712485351336_1779018902387171 | POINTS TO PONDER BEFORE ELECTION DAY :If you are Gay, why are you voting for Hillary? She wants to bring in hundreds of thousands of refugees that believe all Gays should be executed.If you are Black, why are you voting for Hillary? She admires Margaret Sanger and defends Planned Parenthood. They want to abort as many black babies as possible. "Exterminate the Black Race because they are like weeds." Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.If you are a Christian, why are you voting for Hillary Clinton? She wrote her Senior Thesis on Saul Alinsky. He dedicated his book "Rules for Radicals" to Lucifer, The Devil? She says he was and still is her mentor.If you are a Veteran, in the military, or closely related to a military member, why are you voting for Hillary? She left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again. They called for help but the help was told to stand down.If you have factory job, why are you voting for Hillary? She supported TPP. Factory workers are being laid off because jobs are going overseas. Don't forget the deals she made with China. She also welcomes open borders and for illegals to get benefits with YOUR tax money.If you are poor, why are you voting for Hillary? She is supporting Wall street and all the big banks. Big banks keep the poor, poor by destroying the poor man's credit by allowing medical bills and collections to affect your credit scores so you can pay higher interest rates than the rich. - Taking as much of the little money you earn.If you are a woman, how can you vote for Hillary? She has buried all of Bill's rape victims under the rug. Remember the little girl that was raped? She defended the rapist and laughed about it later.If you carry a gun, and believe in the Constitution, how can you vote for Hillary? She wants to eliminate the NRA, take your guns, and abolish the second amendment.If you breathe, why would you vote for Hillary? She has left a trail of dead people that did not agree with her or knew too much!
22 | Alex Stanley | 10154712485351336_10154712668211336 | My head says Trump doesn't know what the hell he's talking about. I'll go with the expert. Hillary Clinton.
23 | Jay Akram | 10154712485351336_1620017418291589 | I can't believe this loser actor is giving all of us advice on who to vote for. Maybe he is thinking that when Donald Trump becomes president his acting career will be resurrected. As Donald himself said "I don't think so"
24 | BJ Layla-Kahlua Dakota-Jericho | 10154712485351336_10154712718026336 | Hillary -watergate, travelgate, cattlegate, Newsgate 2016. Hillary globalist Elite. New World Order. Paid to play.

25 | Chris Baugh | 10154712485351336_929240047179806 | Donald J. Trump supporter Scott Baio says that if Hillary Clinton is elected president, the people who voted for her have no right to complain about "the demise of the United States of America."You trump voters have no right to complain about the demise of the United States of America if he is elected President.Do you morons not know that it's Congress who controls if we succeed or fail as a nation.It's Congress who controls what bills are passed to the president.I'm curious what has our Republican Congress done for Americansoil the past several years?

Two Democratic operatives are out of a job after a controversial conservative activist released undercover footage showing discussions of "busing" in voters and inciting violence at Republican rallies.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Ryan Axe | 10154712542396336_10154712553476336 | Maybe tonight's moderator will ask the following: . Moderator: Good evening ladies and gentlemen. Let's start the first question with you Mrs. Clinton. ‚ÄúWhen you left the White House after your husbands last term as president, why did you steal $200,000.00 worth of furniture, china, and artwork that you were forced to return? Mrs. Clinton, when you were Secretary of State, why did you solicit contributions from foreign governments for the Clinton foundation after you promised President Obama you would not? Mrs. Clinton, why do you and your husband claim to contribute millions of dollars to charity for a tax write off when it goes to your family foundation that gives out less than 15% of the funds you collect and you use the balance to support yourself tax free? Mrs. Clinton, why are you unable to account for 6 billion dollars of State department funds that seem to have disappeared while you were Secretary of State? Mrs. Clinton, why did you say you were broke when you left the White House, but you purchased a 2 million home, built an addition for the secret service, and charge the tax payers of the United States rent in an amount of the entire mortgage? And Mrs. Clinton, how is it that your daughter, Chelsea, can afford to buy a $10.5 million apartment in New York City shortly after you left the White House? And speaking of Chelsea, how is it that her first paying job, in her late 20's, was for more than the President of the United States‚Äô salary? Was there a quid pro quo of any sort involved?? Mrs. Clinton why did you lie to the American people about the terrorist attack in Benghazi but managed to tell the truth to your daughter the same night it happened? Mrs. Clinton why did you lose your law license? Why did your husband lose his? Mrs. Clinton, what Really happened to Ron Brown when he was about to testify against you and your husband? Take your time to respond Mrs. Clinton.
2 | Dawn L. Morey | 10154712542396336_10154712553426336 | Out of a JOB??? Why aren't they charged with a crime???? Out of a job in the democrat party means they will be on a payroll soon.....just somewhere else.
3 | Ike Spike | 10154712542396336_10154712550461336 | But Remember that the "President" said this does NOT happen, just yesterday!!It must have been a Science Fiction Movie right????
4 | Chris Garner | 10154712542396336_10154712553511336 | o'keefe and wikileaks doing the job the mainstream media isn't doing
5 | Matthew Utley | 10154712542396336_10154712549066336 | And just like Debbie Wasserman Schultz Shelby elected by the Hillary Clinton campaign to run something else they quit or get fired but they never go to prison they just get hired somewhere else to work for another Democrat nothing new nothing ever happens
6 | Sandy Grace von Nolting | 10154712542396336_10154712552566336 | Dear Mr. Trump, Please, when you go on that stage tonight, think about Mr. Smith goes to Washington. Humble yourself and tell the truth. I stand or my porch every night and I give the speech that I want to hear you give. I want you to pledge allegiance to the flag of the united states of america one nation under god and indivisible to all I want to hear you say that you are not a professional politician and that you come humbly to serve if we can find it fitting for you to do so. That you will do your very best to hire the right people to solve our problems. That you have no agenda but to Serve. Thank you Mr. Trump for your effort, but PLEASE LISTEN TO ME ON THIS.
7 | Julie Shamalov | 10154712542396336_10154712553846336 | The democratic party are full of hatters and liars. Just look at the history of their party's dealings and corruption...disgraceful....the dems were pro slavery and owned abused slaves. Not 1 rep was pro slavery
8 | Thomas Russo | 10154712542396336_10154712558651336 | This is news? People with more than half a brain (IE not demorats) have known of them bussing in people to incite violence at numerous events, Trump rallies and BLM stuff as well.
9 | Michael Barber | 10154712542396336_10154712574546336 | So, seems as though Trump was speaking the truth, regardless of what the Media, the Republicans and Democrats said.   Better pay attention, America!
10 | Julie Ann | 10154712542396336_10154712555201336 | What a dam shame that the people of USA can't even vote in their choice whom ever that be!   How dare some people rig this election. Wow
11 | Chuck Smith | 10154712542396336_10154712572161336 | Funny the Democrats are convinced that the Government and Media are going to just Hand Killary the Election but We The People , The Silent Majority , The Deplorables ...... The Patriots will not let that Happen .... Trump Landside Happens 11-8-16 !!!
12 | Tony Mantegna | 10154712542396336_10154712575901336 | Your foxnews poll showing Hillary up by 6 points sampled 9% more democrats than republicans, the wsj/NBC poll sample of Democrats was 14% higher of Democrats they showed hillary up by 11 points. These polls are rigged by a system that fears the change a Trump administration would bring, especially as it is tied to big business,  no illegals for cheap labor threatens all Corp America balance sheets. The media is corrupt,  I don't believe any new outlet anymore. I saw the pdf file sample for wsj/NBC poll. I downloaded it. Why is fox not reporting there sample size of democrats
13 | Richard Hill | 10154712542396336_10154712559901336 | So it continues. Wonder when we will hear about some sort of "accidental death" of these two. Because the Clinton's put a HIT out on these people.Who says Killary hasn't created jobs.  Hillary gives and then taketh away.
14 | Mark Osatchuck | 10154712542396336_10154712575386336 | They're just out of THIS job......they will still be doing what they did before.....and employed by the same people who fired them..the only difference is they will change their tactics....You can't keep a dirty corrupt Liberal down!
15 | Pakalu Papito | 10154712542396336_10154712556236336 | Im naturally funny because my life is a joke
16 | Mike Cool | 10154712542396336_10154712594566336 | I wish Juan would shut the F up and go back to CNN. He's a freaking moron and anyone who doesn't think that Hillary's camp is involved with these whack job left wing radical hypocrites is just as moronic. Please.
17 | Ed DeKarski | 10154712542396336_1076729562447405 | The democratic party is a disgrace, a crime ridden organization with no morals, no regsrd for the laws, rules, no regard for anything at all.  And I'm sure they're are members of the Republican party who have been quietly cleaning up their messes while the spotlight is focused on the current criminal.  What a horrible representation of our country and are supposed democracy!!!
18 | Susan Muck | 10154712542396336_1076736375780057 | So they are saying .. "just  because they said it-that doesn't mean it took place."  But in Trumps case.. since he said something lewd 12 years ago while also not knowing he was being recorded... then he is a sex offender and promoting rape culture. Oh.. gotta love the old Democratic political double standard.
19 | Lori Arnett | 10154712542396336_1800608266819774 | Let's all take note of something important about one of the men "out of a job!" Robert Creamer is married to Janice Schakowsky, better known as the U.S. Representative for Illinois's 9th congressional district. She has been serving since 1999, and is a member of the Democratic Party. Robert Creamer visited the White House over 300 times,  with 45 of those visits being with President Obama, and the last visit was June 2016. In 2005 Creamer pleaded guilty to tax violations and $2.3 million dollars in bank fraud.
20 | Brian Gangi | 10154712542396336_950380585105563 | How much more do you brainwashed sheep, I mean Hillary supporters need to see before you realize that Clinton and the dnc are the most corrupt scum that we've ever had in our government? She shouldn't be running for president, she should be rotting away in a cell. This woman represents EVERYTHING that is wrong with our government today.
21 | Valarie O'Hern Smith | 10154712542396336_10154712577241336 | The system is rigged folks!!!! Here's your proof President Obama.  Now YOU can stop whining!  I'm sure there is a lot more rigging too.
22 | Michael Photopoulos | 10154712542396336_10154712573096336 | Democrats are doing the same stuff nazis did to get into power first the voilence at rallys and now The firebombing thats right there with the night of broken glass. Welcome back 1938What is funnier is bernies response to the violence that mirrors russias response to violence against russian gays.Look it up.
23 | Jennifer Mikelyn Penzero | 10154712542396336_1076747412445620 | But yet there is virtually no possibility of rigging an election...give me a break!!! Just like the postal employee who bragged about ripping up republican ballots! I just filled out my mail-in ballot and I am hand delivering it! Trump/Pence 2016!üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
24 | Richard Jo Charles | 10154712542396336_10154712592436336 | They are a part of the plan to get Hillary elected. Watch the tape if you get a chance. They are telling about being in contact with super pac , and DNC and are part of Hillary's plan to discredit Trump. They even told how they have firewalls to keep it from leading back to Hillary. She should be banned from running and banned from anything involved with the National Security!!!!
25 | Jon Dodson | 10154712542396336_10154712551771336 | Oh, but I thought these videos were fake and fabricated.....

1 | Fox News | 10154712142861336_1144565675630116 | Watch the final showdown between Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton TONIGHT at 9p ET on Fox News Channel!
2 | Randy R. Dahl | 10154712142861336_10154712317856336 | will be directing my support for Pence by voting for the Trump / Pence ticket. I would think Pence and the others figure heads around Trump are enough to keep Trump in line. I have no trust in the Clinton s and anybody that does, have been misguided by the lame stream media. If Hilliary is elected we are in trouble, as it has been proven that nobody, I mean Nobody can keep them in line. Such as the FBI or the Dept of Justice, The Clintons have ways of silencing people.
3 | Dan Buress Sr. | 10154712142861336_10154712316696336 | Do not be distracted! Democrats want open borders, higher taxes, more "refugees" & illegals, weakened military & police, abolish the 2nd Amendment, Leftist judges, more BLM, and more islamic influence. THAT IS NOT A CHOICE!!!!! Trump/Pence 2016!

5 | Dawn Kloes Cook | 10154712142861336_10154712344646336 | Eric Trump also said that if women can't handle sexual harassment in the workplace than they should work somewhere else. I guess the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.
6 | Branden Rose | 10154712142861336_10154712316971336 | Unfortunately we are forced to vote for two candidates who don't deserve to be the POTUS. Our decision is made by what media drills into your head. In order to achieve what we want, we have to work together as American people. This will be the first time I refuse to vote because of what these two parties presented to us are a complete abomination
7 | Riya Sharma | 10154712142861336_10154712318386336 | If Republicans don't win this race this will likely be end of the two party system, and then that's the end of America and our constitution. Say whatever you want but whoever is President major changes are on the way and I at least want to know I did my part urging people to get out and vote Trump!
8 | Lisa M Wilcox Seeley | 10154712142861336_10154712340896336 | I wish he would instead focus on the issues.  Personal attacks are not necessary and make him appear to be unprepared for the presidency.  He already has my vote and this is what I see, imagine what the undecided folks are thinking.
9 | Michael Brkich | 10154712142861336_10154712326606336 | hillary clinton has to realize that government does not create jobs; government creates an enviroment that creates jobs and I doubt if she could create this enviroment based on her track record.
10 | Ed Gilliam | 10154712142861336_10154712327546336 | I think this is amazing, Billionaire Mark Cuban said to the effect: Donald Trump will be broke in seven years if he's not elected president. Because he is actually turning his back on all the rich people who can afford his establishments; in respect of those who cannot. So therefore if he doesn't make the presidency the ones who can afford his establishments won't go and the ones he tried to help can't afford to go. Now Inadvertently Mark Cuban has given (((Donald J Trump))) and extreme compliment...think about it and go vote for this great man !!!
11 | Thomas Satterfield | 10154712142861336_10154712331031336 | Chris Christie already tried that at the GOP convention didn't change any votes...Donald has already lost this...Look at the polls...he is loosing in Red Arizona...Hell Texas is to close to call...he is done...done done done.....
12 | Evan Alvarez | 10154712142861336_10154712398846336 | Doesn't matter. Trump has dug a hole (grave?) too deep. He is losing to her now, after 2 debates, and leaked emails, and all the crap. He will go full looney toons yet again, turning off even more voters, and she will calmly let him crash and burn (again). He simply cannot control himself and his actual debating skills are awful.
13 | Suzanne Hansen | 10154712142861336_10154712350801336 | How about telling us what you will do for our country instead of tearing down a candidate that Democrats will vote for anyway. Start acting Presidential and see if you can get some Republicans and Independents to decide to vote for you. And stop the tweeting. Really now.
14 | Elizabeth Ra | 10154712142861336_10154712355291336 | If donald can't afford himself or his business's & DIDN'T PAY TAXES & still filed for bankruptcy several times... how can he afford a whole country....that is already in debt?!?#Dumptrump
15 | Julie Mavis Risch | 10154712142861336_667563280083591 | Eric trump ???? Who cares what he says? He is only successful because of his daddy's money......and his daddy is successful due to his daddy's money. Eric trump should just shut up. Animal killer
16 | Joyce Dietrich Zawacki | 10154712142861336_10154712339201336 | Stay focused on the issues. Tell us HOW you will create jobs, improve the economy, and bring us together. I am trusting you, please don't let us down. Thanks.
17 | Ryan Walker | 10154712142861336_10154712341666336 | Heres a thought instead of blaming eachother and talking about who said what and when could you talk about how your gonna make changes. What are your goals besides digging up dirt on eachother. This election is like 2 5 year olds telling on eachother. Grow up both of you
18 | Celeste M Wuersig | 10154712142861336_10154712362581336 | Right about that!  In the last debate Hillary said she created so many jobs as a senator for NY If that's true, then why are people still leaving this state in droves, looking for work elsewhere? It is just another lie!.
19 | Jeannie Smith | 10154712142861336_10154712397156336 | Stick to topics. Answer Chris Wallace questions don't let this be about you it has to be about the American people and how Hillary Clinton has abused her power while in office. For 30 years.
20 | Dan Jaworek | 10154712142861336_1144411398978877 | Go ahead and prosecute her resume. But what should really be on trial is her ideology. Republicans would have a lot more success if the did more to explain the big picture. Explain their motives. Their record is only a failure when you wrongfully assume that they want the same outcome that you do. Clinton and the rest of them are not inept. They are a smashing success. Its just that they are trying to accomplish very different things. Explain THAT Mr. Trump. Explain that and you might have a chance.
21 | Eve Mrozowski | 10154712142861336_10154712329376336 | That's right, Eric! She has created nothing but a private server, lies, then lies of those lies; she has created a corruption, robberies of funds that were supposed go to the Haiti victims; she has created a Clinton Laundromat Foundation and more lies and lies about those lies ... THAT'S ABOUT IT!
22 | Debbie Mathes | 10154712142861336_10154712402566336 | I was asked tonight how I could ever support Trump after the comments he made over 11 years ago about women and if I would still support him if he made those comments to my daughter? My response was this....If he had put our nations security at risk, I would not vote for him. If his organization received large donations from countries that killed women and gays, I would not vote for him. If he boasted 30 Years of government experience, but still could not discern if an email was classified or not, without someone letting him know if it was or not, I would not vote for him. If he boasted about how he has defended children his entire life, but is for abortion, (even late term, when the child can feel pain) I would not vote for him. If he wanted my 3 year old Granddaughter to go to restrooms with men dressed as women, I would not vote for him. I have taught my daughter and will teach my granddaughter to disregard sexist remarks and move on, especially when they were made so many years ago and, also to forgive those who say they are sorry. If he caused lives to be destroyed in Benghazi and then lied to the faces of the parents as they stood at their child's casket, I would not vote for him. If people who came against him mysteriously turned up dead, I would not vote for him. If he suddenly developed a southern accent when he was in the South, campaigning, I would not vote for him. If he continually broke the law and that was ignored, I would not vote for him, but right now, the only person who does all these things is Hillary. Right now, the fact that Donald made these remarks over 12 years ago, does not move me. I'm bigger than those remarks and we all have said stupid things throughout our lives. To me, the fact that Hillary lies continuously, is a much bigger problem. We can see the effects of her lies by the state of our poor country right now... Rant over...
23 | Brian Maurer | 10154712142861336_1144393932313957 | So here's the REAL story. Amb. Stevens was sent to Benghazi post haste in order to retrieve US made Stinger missiles supplied to Ansar al Sharia without Congressional oversight or permission. Hillary brokered the deal through Stevens and a private arms dealer named Marc Turi. Then some of the shoulder fired missiles ended up in Afghanistan used against our own military. It was July 25th, 2012 when a Chinook helicopter was taken down by one of our own Stingers, but the idiot Taliban didn't arm the missile and the Chinook didn't explode, but had to land anyway. An ordnance team recovered the serial number off the missile which led back to a cache of Stingers being kept in Qatar by the CIA. Obama and Hillary were now in full panic mode and Stevens was sent in to retrieve the rest of the Stingers. This was a "do-or-die" mission, which explains the stand down orders given to multiple commando teams. It was the State Dept, not the CIA that supplied them to our sworn enemies, because Petraeus wouldn't supply these deadly weapons due to their potential use on commercial aircraft. Then, Obama threw Gen. Petraeus under the bus after he refused to testify that he OK'd the BS talking points about a spontaneous uprising due to a Youtube video. Obama and Hillary committed treason...and THIS is what the investigation is all about, why she had a private server, (in order to delete the digital evidence), and why Obama, two weeks after the attack, told the UN that the attack was because of a Youtube video, even though everyone knew it was not. Further...the Taliban knew that this administration aided and abetted the enemy without Congressional approval when Boehner created the Select Cmte, and the Taliban began pushing the Obama Administration for the release of 5 Taliban Generals. Bowe Bergdahl was just a pawn...everyone KNEW he was a traitor. So we have a traitor as POTUS that is not only corrupt, but compromised...and a woman that is a serial liar, perjured herself multiple times at the Hearing whom is running for POTUS. Only the Dems, with their hands out, palms up, will support her. Perhaps this is why no military aircraft was called in...because the administration knew our enemies had Stingers.Copied and pasted...and pasted again and again and again until everyone reads this truth.... share
24 | Mel Mcbroome | 10154712142861336_10154712419106336 | I hope he destroys her! We all know she should be in handcuffs! This is what is wrong with a government when they allow some people to get prosecuted and others not too. We need a change America and Trump is it. Otherwise we will be like my country of Mexico.
25 | Dave Long | 10154712142861336_10154712419356336 | Yeah. And they call Donald a fibber. Exactly... in the 24 years Hillary and Bill have been in office as Pres, Mrs Pres, Senator, Sec of State... what positive things CAN you point to? She has no ideas, no plans, nothing, except she wants guns gone, minorities given preferential treatment, etc.

Live from the MGM Grand Las Vegas lazy river pool: Dana Perino and Chris Stirewalt record their pre-debate podcast, "I'll Tell You What." #debates
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Donna Gathright | 10154712251151336_540080606189047 | Why is the media saying no voter fraud happens. Hello didn't we just watch Clinton steal the nomination from Bernie. Wake up!!!
2 | Ruth Hollern Conway | 10154712251151336_522956801229567 | You both support Clinton, and Bush family...you both are out of touch with Americans. This is NOT an Election, it is a Movement by the People, For The People. You both are bought into the Political Problems.
3 | Kevin Barker | 10154712251151336_540079946189113 | Dana you should call out all the establishment republicans to get on board. Tell your old old old boss to stop acting like a spoiled brat and step up and help us defeat Crooked Hillary
4 | Marie Seybert Stringfellow | 10154712251151336_1181952075185042 | Dana is a wannabe. I used to like her and Meghan but they are both Hillary supporters in disguise although not good at disguising it.
5 | Christy Taylor | 10154712251151336_540079939522447 | He has already apologized. How many more times does he have to apologize for remarks made 11 years ago? Hillary needs to apologize, especially to the mother of the Benghazi victim!
6 | Charli Allen Morgan | 10154712251151336_522957077896206 | Hope you guys will stick to reporting truth...fair, unbalanced truth.  Don't be like CNN. Bring our faith back to media that reports the truth.
7 | Jim Wilson | 10154712251151336_1129727967105069 | You lying skanks! Real polls show epic record landslide. Your days as a news show with journalist credentials are soon over!#trump #FollowTheMoney #DrainTheSwamp #Veritas

9 | Jeffery Fowler | 10154712251151336_1129726740438525 | Dana will believe her old bosses lies but will not believe the people on the ground at Benghazi. She is just as bad as Meghan Kelly.
10 | Paul Sessa | 10154712251151336_1129727923771740 | She shouldn't even be allowed to run and be behind bars. She only cares about herself because she's old and wants to go out in history as being the first woman president.
11 | Joseph Craig Leal | 10154712251151336_10154712256891336 | With the amount of corruption that has been exposed how can anyone still support Clinton. Smh #Americafirst #NeverHillary
12 | Marc Levant | 10154712251151336_650875061756366 | If Hillary wins, there is a good chance she will be impeached. Do we really want to go through that and possibly have Kaine as President. Wake up America.
13 | Alicia Lareau | 10154712251151336_1598505097121251 | I live only 10 mins from the strip maybe I should run to MGM in slap them to wake them up! Our country is heading to a disaster and if we elect the wrong person ( Hillary) we better brace for what's coming!
14 | Danny Tate | 10154712251151336_1117811338267570 | It's do or die tonight please stay on he issues and stop the other BS and u can take this campaign to the finish line we need u as our POTUS......
15 | Melissa Lynn Newton | 10154712251151336_540083142855460 | Yeah and Reagan was losing by 10How did that work out for the demsOne of the greatest presidents everShe's a crook and we need change
16 | Ron Mortellito | 10154712251151336_1117809648267739 | There once were some Hillary groupies,That tried to get rid of their poopies,Their actions were seen,Upsetting the queen,Now her voters have all flown the coopies.
17 | Robbie Hansen | 10154712251151336_10154712258746336 | Will Faux News keep Kelly away and actually ask Killary the hard questions and keep her in check when she goes off!!!?
18 | Barbara Johnson Christianson | 10154712251151336_540082146188893 | Maybe if Jeb was the candidate Dana would be less in love with horrid Hillary. Nothing will change Dana for the better as long as you keep putting our candidate down.
19 | Mark Brown | 10154712251151336_1129730753771457 | Americans have no rights didn‚Äôt you know because we forgot how to fight for them. Only the strong survive and we wimped out a longtime ago.
20 | Wesley Redd | 10154712251151336_1324304100916024 | Of course he's losing in the "FAKE" polls. Their polling mostly demoturds with a few Republicans mixed in. I'm from NC and me nor my family have received a call. Nov 8th wear red
21 | Stephanie Joiner Peaster | 10154712251151336_1797533407155542 | Hillary belongs in prison and everyone that won't indict & prosecute her along with all the cronies that do her bidding. The election will be rigged this country is corrupt
22 | Bill McKee | 10154712251151336_1598498757121885 | Hillary is a bundle of contradictions and when called to actually take action.. she let 4 Americans die... a wanton disregard for American patriots.
23 | Bill McKee | 10154712251151336_1764056467177653 | talk about 30 years of corruption-government corruption- which she has been involved in a new controversy EVERY year. Specifics!!
24 | Debbi Meyers | 10154712251151336_1126098807477558 | I enjoy Fox and friends in the morning and Sean Hannity and Lou Dobbs in the evening and that's it! I am totally disgusted with Fox news!
25 | Joe Spivey | 10154712251151336_10154712261306336 | Hey folks when you get a chance flip the channel briefly to CNN and look at all the Trump supporters standing behind them it's great I'm loving it and then turn right back to Fox. Fox is the only news channel is giving us a fair Shake.

The incident happened Tuesday around 9:30am in Lawrenceville, about 30 miles northeast of Atlanta, near where people were waiting in line for early voting.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Sam Scott | 10154711921536336_10154712080391336 | Hillary has already started to sh*t on the American people
2 | Kira Bemelen | 10154711921536336_10154712078386336 | And are they going to press charges!? That is illegal! Funny I thought dems cared so much about the environment.
3 | Luke Krenning | 10154711921536336_10154712089976336 | If Trump doesn't win and Republicans lose the Senate, it will likely be end of the two party system, and with it, the end of America and our Constitution. That is why it's so important that we vote for Donald Trump as our 45th President of the United States on November 8th!
4 | Nicklas Peoples | 10154711921536336_10154712085691336 | Appropriate... Democrats dump sewage on American people every time they speak...
5 | Bill Stuff | 10154711921536336_10154712107161336 | A large amount of "drying toilet paper" and a "foul smell" was left behind. That might be the headline in 4 years if Hillary is elected.
6 | Brandon Longenecker | 10154711921536336_10154712104926336 | The entire democrat party summed up in one image and action! :D LOL!!!
7 | Nick Romeos Sr. | 10154711921536336_10154712110576336 | Georgians,  remember this when you vote. A perfect example of what she will do to the American citizens if she is elected!  TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT!!!
8 | Brandon Joseph Gordon | 10154711921536336_10154712081056336 | Well at least the crap didn't come out of their mouths this time üòÇ
9 | Charlene Lindsay | 10154711921536336_10154712117206336 | "We were unaware of any possible violations and have already taken corrective action with the charter bus company to prevent this from happening again,". The driver from the bus company knew when and where to release the waste! This was not an accident!  He was probably told to get rid if that smell, so he just dumped it where he was! I'm surprised that the company and the driver didn't get a ticket. If it was ANYONE else they would have gotten a large fine, if nothing else!
10 | Steve Adams | 10154711921536336_10154712096726336 | I thought I could smell something coming from Lawrencville. I thought it was just because a clinton bus had been there but now I know it's because clinton crap was there too. They'll never get THAT smell to go away.
11 | Cindy Mucha Whitehead | 10154711921536336_10154712121721336 | Anyone who owns a motor home knows that there are multiple places to legally and safely dump the waste. Most campgrounds, state parks with RV camping, any Camping World store (and many other RV sellers), most Flying J gas stations..... so many legal options, and they chose a storm sewer? This leads to another question: Where have they been dumping their waste all along?
12 | Kimberly Boyd | 10154711921536336_10154712130916336 | Honest mistake? How does one accidently (and with great precision) dump crap staight into a storm drain?! If it were truly an accident it would have been dumped all over and not just in the storm drain.
13 | Bruce Pobanz | 10154711921536336_10154712124646336 | HAZMAT crew had to be called out by the Police to contain and clean up this illegal dumping, More American tax dollars had to be spent to clean up this so-called "spill". Public safety hazard and illegal dumping. If this was Donald trump bus, it would be front page news and on the airwaves every hour. But since it is a Hillary bus the news media lets it slide because it is business as usual with Hillary and her team.
14 | Melanie Bartholomew | 10154711921536336_1788916778057889 | Honest mistake my rear end. Just the DNC showing their detest for the general public and laws because they don't apply to them. Imagine if Trump or Stein or Johnson "party" bus had done this. The media would be crucifying them and it would the next big story. This was done with intent because they simply do not care about anyone but their selfish selves....all the way to the top.
15 | Kristin Noell Casey | 10154711921536336_1785429771713492 | I keep reading all these political comments but the only thing that keeps coming to my mind is:National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation: "Hey Clark, the shitter was full!" #trump2016
16 | LeighAnn Cariker | 10154711921536336_10154712123461336 | The Dems are so full of $#%& they had to dump it somewhere...Wonder how this might affect global warming?
17 | Adam Siegel | 10154711921536336_10154712090506336 | If this isn't a metaphor for how she will run the country, I don't know what is.Is Cousin Eddie operating this bus?#HeyHillaryTheShittersFull
18 | Ian Mercer | 10154711921536336_10154712128251336 | Of course, notably missing from the story was the part where all of her supporters grabbed a straw to go lap it up like its the nectar of the gods as usual.
19 | Gene R. Ashley | 10154711921536336_1222356877787410 | This is considered a federal offense. All sewage is considered biohazard waste. Considering there are multiple campsites around Lawrenceville GA and I am sure the driver had a cell phone. They could have very easily found a dumpsite. What a moron.
20 | Elmer Roldan | 10154711921536336_10154712142376336 | üá∫üá∏There are MILLIONS of Shadow TRUMP supporters who are not announcing THEY ARE VOTING FOR TRUMP!! Why? Because liberals act like bullies by assaulting, harassing & intimidating them. Be FEARLESS #VoteTrump on 11/8/2016 üá∫üá∏
21 | Claire Allen Gasparre | 10154711921536336_598117157063501 | Can you imagine if it was s republican bus, I can hear all their "catch phrases": offensive , treason , racist , etc . And it would be on the liberal news media 24:7.
22 | Brenda Griswold Fraser | 10154711921536336_1222327791123652 | Curious...was a citation issued? This happened around the area I live in. I would love to know that this was handled just like any citizen doing this would have been handled. I read there was an apology issued, sometimes, that just isn't enough.
23 | Ginger Wargo | 10154711921536336_598124937062723 | Typical liberals...shitting all over everyone else and then saying it was a simple "mistake"! Anyone with an ounce of commen sense/ decency knows better than to dump raw sewage in the storm drain!
24 | Heather Boswell | 10154711921536336_10154712142246336 | Where is the EPA? This is illegal, not to mention gross and just rude. Disgusting.
25 | Gail Adie | 10154711921536336_10154712104146336 | They're going to be blaming it on the Trump campaign saying it was their bus not the Clinton bus. Plus they always feel it's okay for them to get away with stuff but nobody else can.

Donald J. Trump will also have another VIP guest: Malik Obama, President Obama's Kenyan-born half-brother.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Dixie Parks Wagner | 10154711945976336_10154711970696336 | Wikileaks release show Obama knew about Hillary's unsecure private server and lied to the media about it. Don't you love it when it becomes 100% clear that your President blatantly and intentionally lied to you for purely political reasons. Sure seems to happen more and more often as Obama does everything he can to try to get Hillary into the White House. People know that Obama does not even like Hillary but assume he is campaigning for her "to protect his legacy". That is only part of it. Now that it has become clear that Obama knew about Hillay's illegal unsecure private server, used a fake name to correspond with Hillary over it, allowed her to continue to use it even though it put US national security at risk, and in doing all this, also mishandled classified material and risked our national security himself....he NEEDS Hillary to win. Because if Trump is elected, his crimes will come to light right along with Hillary's. He is campaigning so hard for Hillary because he HAS TO....to save his own butt from being disgraced as wholly incompetent and for engaging in illegal acts as a sitting President that risked US security. His entire administration, Comey of the FBI, and of course the media have all been corrupted to engage in the cover up of crimes committed by Obama and Hillary Clinton. If Trump is not elected, the public will never know the depth of corruption and criminal activity that took place during the Obama Presidency.
2 | Andrea Strauss | 10154711945976336_10154711987756336 | I think it would be a "BOOM" moment if at some point in the debate Trump told the audience, "Look, Hillary has invited billionaire globalists and celebrities. I've invited military families and those who can overcome racial expectations to vote for their country. The choice is clear. Hillary is represented by billionaire globalists and I represent patriotic Americans."
3 | Annmarie Huber | 10154711945976336_10154711957011336 | I PLEDGE- I will vote for Donald J, Trump on Nov 8th.

A message to all the "Silent Majority"- Please don't sit at home and just watch the results come in- get out and vote for your next President of the United States of America- Donald J.Trump! We need you too. Please share with everyone.Thanks. GO TRUMP!
4 | Kelly Boatman | 10154711945976336_10154712065636336 | Oh the desperation of the Trump camp..... Obama's half brother, really? WTF! This is hilarious since, 1) Obama isn't running for president, 2) this guy can't vote , not that it really matters, and 3) who cares?
5 | Bruce Rider | 10154711945976336_10154712110171336 | Early voting started today in TN... I voted This Morning... Lines where out the door... everyone I spoke to was voting for Trump and were Proud of IT!!!!  I think Hillary will be surprised!
6 | Mixhael L Villar | 10154711945976336_10154711951306336 | Although I can appreciate some of the commentator on Fox News for their continuous efforts in reporting on the emails released by wikileak in the attempts to expose corruption within the Hill\Billary camp. At best to date, the only thing the wikileak emails have exposed is a mirror showing the unethical behavior of Hill/Billary and her subordinates proving in MY opinion that if she were to be elected PotUS, it would just be more of the same 'ol which doesn't look to  favorable for us "WE the PEOPLE" and "WE the PEOPLE" should expect better from our Constituent's/President. One can only imagine that if she and her staff acts in such a way now, what it would be like when she/they take office. I am convinced that there are some very influential and power individuals working diligently to control the outcome of this election (deem the puppet master's) this has been a practice that has been going on in this country for decade's to better serve their agenda. This election Hill/Billary is their agenda and they will stop at nothing to ensure that she becomes their next PotUS branding her with the title of the new and improved goverment tested "Teflon Don-est" because none of the speculative allegation's of her involvement in any crime being commited will stick.  I'm sure some of you can recall the controversy surrounding George Bush jr back in '96 when reports came out that he was involved in a secret society inside the Masons plotting to control the government and persuade to outcome of elections. I recall after about a week or so of constant reporting by the media and one commentator actually attending one of the gatherings, found that it was nothing more than just a group of men discussing the world view just like regular people do in lounges. Another case of just barely scratching the surface only to come up empty handed which is exactly what is going to happen with the wikileaked e-mails. They (the media) will never find anything or anybody at the puppet master level because they too are puppet in the grand scheme of things and GOD help us all if they ever do.Puppet Master= Rich and Powerful special interest individualsPuppets= Trump, Hill/Billary and the Media including now the Social MediaWe the People= Cattle being herded through the corral's of their making in awl of the shiney things they dizzle us with and continue to baffle us with their BULL$#!T.Trump, God Speed
7 | Terry Malone | 10154711945976336_10154711969636336 | Women who say Trump touched them 20 years ago weather true of not is no were close to the evil Clinton has done. If elected she will only get worse because she will have power of the Presidents office, if that don't scare you, your either asleep or just plain brain dammagged
8 | Lucy Bella | 10154711945976336_10154712025661336 | It doesn't really matter who wins tonight, last time trump won, the media made crooked Killary look good üò° We don't care how Rigged The System is!!! We'r still voting For Trump üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏We need to be heard! are you with me?
9 | Tom Gravel | 10154711945976336_10154711953561336 | Let's see. Melania is a former communist. Ivanka is best friends with Putins mistress, Trump's former campaign manager had to resign because of his Russian ties. Trump praises Putin, Russia hacks the DNC and gives the emails to Assange to leak 3 weeks before the election. Mmm.
10 | John Collins | 10154711945976336_10154711961306336 | From the Truthpost Party Web Site: Chris Stevens and Benghazi..So here's the REAL story. Amb. Stevens was sent to Benghazi post haste in order to retrieve US made Stinger missiles supplied to Ansar al Sharia without Congressional oversight or permission. Hillary brokered the deal through Stevens and a private arms dealer named Marc Turi. Then some of the shoulder fired missiles ended up in Afghanistan used against our own military. It was July 25th, 2012 when a Chinook helicopter was taken down by one of our own Stingers, but the idiot Taliban didn't arm the missile and the Chinook didn't explode, but had to land anyway. An ordnance team recovered the serial number off the missile which led back to a cache of Stingers being kept in Qatar by the CIA. Obama and Hillary were now in full panic mode and Stevens was sent in to retrieve the rest of the Stingers. This was a "do-or-die" mission, which explains the stand down orders given to multiple commando teams. It was the State Dept, not the CIA that supplied them to our sworn enemies, because Petraeus wouldn't supply these deadly weapons due to their potential use on commercial aircraft. Then, Obama threw Gen. Petraeus under the bus after he refused to testify that he OK'd the BS talking points about a spontaneous uprising due to a Youtube video. Obama and Hillary committed treason...and THIS is what the investigation is all about, why she had a private server, (in order to delete the digital evidence), and why Obama, two weeks after the attack, told the UN that the attack was because of a Youtube video, even though everyone knew it was not. Further...the Taliban knew that this administration aided and abetted the enemy without Congressional approval when Boehner created the Select Cmte, and the Taliban began pushing the Obama Administration for the release of 5 Taliban Generals. Bowe Bergdahl was just a pawn...everyone KNEW he was a traitor. So we have a traitor as POTUS that is not only corrupt, but compromised...and a woman that is a serial liar, perjured herself multiple times at the Hearing whom is running for POTUS. Only the Dems, with their hands out, palms up, will support her. Perhaps this is why no military aircraft was called in...because the administration knew our enemies had Stingers.
11 | Mike Connors | 10154711945976336_519951398210875 | In Kenya any tom dick and Obama will claim to be Obama's brother if you pay them $5. Pay them an extra $5 they will say Obama joined ISIS on his 5th Birthday and that he was born in Bin Laden's family house in Saudi Arabia.
12 | Bonnie Wells Artist | 10154711945976336_10154711960661336 | I hate the lies, by the disgusting media. Over and over they talk about how horrible it is to talk about women and say bad names. The Clinton media supporters would preferred just to murder women 36 weeks we don't hear about that do we.
13 | Feidhlim McAleer | 10154711945976336_10154712106816336 | So one of several Obama half-brothers is disgruntled. Is that really a big deal with implications for "policy" or offering insights on "issues".....or is it simply a lame but cynical attempt by the party of "family values" to get further down into the gutter???
14 | Paula Martineau- Hoover | 10154711945976336_10154711966161336 | Really? Clinton's idea of intimidation in the audience is Mark Cuban, co owner of Girls Gone Wild, and Meg Whitman, a woman who had to pull out of the Governor's race for Ca. because of threats she made to her illegal house keeper. You go girl! Trump should just walk on stage and ask Mark how his partnership is going and ask Meg if she learned anything from her last house keeper.
15 | Angie Grippe Stein | 10154711945976336_1415165628523877 | Obama just signed to not give the military a raise. This is 3rd year in a row. I am so disgusted. Our military put their life on the line for us and how are they appreciated. Some of us depend on a raise. Mr. Obama can not wait until you are out of the White House but then SHE will follow you so I guess we will not get a raise for the 4 years.  We need TRUMP.
16 | Brent Fox | 10154711945976336_10154711957866336 | Hillary didn't care when leaving those men there to fend for themselves, doubt she'll care if mom's sitting in the crowd.
17 | Kathy MacWood | 10154711945976336_10154712301741336 | Our Niece was murdered 15 years ago. If anyone, the police, detectives or the prosecutor would of lied to our Family, I would be up in arms. This Mother deserves the truth.  Not the lies told to her by the F$&king government. Hillary chose to lie to this poor Mother. I hate Hillary. This government is so corrupt. How anyone could vote for Hillary is beyond me.
18 | Todd Jones | 10154711945976336_10154712031416336 | The Donald is going to lose the debate, and he's going to lose the election - Bigtime. Hillary could receive over 400 electoral votes, and win back the house and senate.Hillary & Bill 2016 2020! AMERICAN BORN President Barack Obama 2008 & 2012!
19 | Jimi Tee | 10154711945976336_10154712048706336 | Do not let the polls or media suppress your support for Trump. This is what Hillary and the establishment politicians want you to do. Trump can and will win.. Ben Stein is an establishment hack as well....pay no attention to the men behind the curtain. Get out and vote with record numbers to support TRUMP!!!!
20 | Mark Engelbrecht | 10154711945976336_10154711976001336 | That is awesome!  At least there is one bright Obama that cares about our country.....I understand he had voting rights. Tonight should be good! Trump / Pence 2016
21 | Beth Busiek | 10154711945976336_1415163361857437 | I hope Donald J. Trump has some representatives of Haiti at the debate to remind hilary of how she and bill stole millions from the Haitians after the earthquake
22 | Nickson Ekume | 10154711945976336_1415057295201377 | Why is Trump acting so desperate like that....?? Inviting this moron Maliki Obama makes me feel that Trump is more desperate to go to the oval office by all means This guy known as Malik was agood friend of fomer Libya dictator Gaddafi who use to fund terrorist around the world  this makes me wonder was Trump in that group too...?? This guy malik was taken to court by his child for child abuse and neglecting her, This Malik is so selfish of his own brother Obama, The guy has more than four wives...!!! Yet Americans are waiting to clap for him for the thrush he gonna talk...??
23 | Theresa Archuletta | 10154711945976336_10154712294416336 | And what is Hillary Clinton your average grandma she's the globalist trader and has sold out our country for 30 pieces of silver she is the a pitta me of everything that is a political hack Tammany Hall would be ashamed of her tactics!
24 | Theresa Archuletta | 10154711945976336_10154712290526336 | Yeah and their. No racist in the Democratic Party right you beat up other people who don't vote like you you call them deplorable's super predators rednecks and all kinds of other evil names so who's the real racist here!
25 | Ken Sandler | 10154711945976336_10154712144596336 | FOX, I know how excited you are about hosting the debate tonight, but showinga double box all day w/ an empty stage is a bit much, dont you think?  Seriously, why do news managers think stunts like that are a good idea?

2 | Mark Jones | 10154711776401336_10154711791081336 | Voter fraud, disrespecting our flag and military, professional agitators, anti voter ID laws, firebombing Republican offices, calling Mexicans "taco bowls,"shooting cops, calling blacks " super predators," beating up Trump supporters...yep, the democrats are clearly the "tolerant," party.
3 | Jack Munley | 10154711776401336_10154711792046336 | Obama said the voting can not be rigged. Now in convinced more than ever the voting will be rigged.
4 | Jennie Reha | 10154711776401336_10154711837096336 | 1.8 billion dollars was just transferred by Hillary Clinton to qatar. .... Qatar funds ISIS ..then a palace was cleared for a "GUESTS" arrival in early November .. if Hillary is elected. .... her first move is to go to Qatar.... cause war on American soil and blame the Russians! !!!!!! WAKE UP , WE NEED TRUMP! !!!!!!!!!!!!
5 | Marge Taranto | 10154711776401336_10154711814691336 | I knew this would happen! This is on Obama for not taking care of this many years ago...all our loved ones lost life and limb to win and now to go back again because he didn`t follow through? How much longer are we going to stand for this????
6 | Tony Kincaid | 10154711776401336_10154711807221336 | To our service women and men, please be safe . You have an administration that cares nothing for you. You're expendable in there eyes, be safe. God Bless.
7 | Adriana Jacobs | 10154711776401336_10154711794456336 | We are fighting against what they called the New World Order, which means changes in honor, morality and Our Constitution and our God. Who is behind the NWO? Just see who owns of the oil and you will have answer. These people buy and hide behind Corporations and had been able to buy the media, schools and politics.  Yes Hillary is bought by them too and believe me she is not looking for you and your family and what makes you who you are. If you care for who you are and for your future - you have to support TRUMP. We have an opportunity with Trump to recuperate our Country back. We are the silent MAJORITY!
8 | Frank Caputo Sr. | 10154711776401336_10154711900531336 | Stop watching the media, without funds they will wither and die. Time for peer to peer communication as in Colonial times. US Media and government can no longer be trusted. Even the Pope has been compromised. If Hilary Clinton is elected we will never know the full extent of all crimes that the Clintons, Obama and their cronies have committed against the American people. We do know that these acts are traitorous in nature and have compromised the FBI and other intelligence agencies. If you support Hilary Clinton in this election you are aiding and abetting in high crimes against the American people and should be treated as such!! Do you know a Clinton supporter? Let them know how you feel. I will not talk too, associate with, purchase from or have anything to do with a Clinton supporter in any way shape or form. Do the same and they should get the message. Time to defeat Wall Street, as well as the Political and Media elite with one blow!! I'm an Independent and I stand strong behind Donald Trump!! TRUMP üá±üá∑ PENCE 2016!!Stop Americas destruction by liberal loons and Conservative power trips!

12 | Gwyn Simons Maahs | 10154711776401336_10154711854546336 | A LOT OF TRUTH HERE:We are so asleep and in need of an awakening. Some of these things on the list are NOT "all of a sudden," but have been going on several years already. Some would have been unbelievable a few years ago.Does anybody remember what and how things happened in Germany?Think, all of this in less than 8 years.Before Obama there was virtually no outlandish presence of Islam in America.‚Ä¢ All of a sudden, Islam is taught in schools. Christianity and the bible are banned in schools.‚Ä¢ All of a sudden we must allow prayer rugs everywhere and allow for Islamic prayer in schools, airports and businesses.‚Ä¢ All of a sudden we must stop serving pork in prisons.‚Ä¢ All of a sudden we are inundated with law suits by Muslims who are offended by American culture.‚Ä¢ All of a sudden we must allow burkas to be worn everywhere even though you have no idea who or what is covered up under them.‚Ä¢ All of a sudden Muslims are suing employers and refusing to do their jobs if they personally deem it conflicts with Sharia Law.‚Ä¢ All of a sudden the Attorney General of the United States vows to prosecute anyone who engages in "anti-Muslim speech".‚Ä¢ All of a sudden, Jihadists who engage in terrorism and openly admit they acted in the name of Islam and ISIS, are emphatically declared they are NOT Islamic by our leaders and/or their actions are determined NOT to be terrorism, but other nebulous terms like 'workplace violence."‚Ä¢ All of a sudden, it becomes Policy that Secular Middle East dictators that were benign or friendly to the West, must be replaced by Islamists and the Muslim Brotherhood.‚Ä¢ All of a sudden our troops are withdrawn from Iraq and the middle east, giving rise to ISIS.‚Ä¢ All of a sudden, America has reduced its nuclear stockpiles to 1950 levels, as Obama's stated goal of a nuke-free America by the time he leaves office continues uninterrupted.‚Ä¢ All of a sudden, a deal with Iran must be made at any cost, with a pathway to nuclear weapons and HUNDREDS of BILLIONS of dollars handed over to fund their programs.‚Ä¢ All of a sudden America APOLOGIZES to Muslim states and sponsors of terror worldwide for acts of aggression, war and sabotage THEY perpetrate against our soldiers.‚Ä¢ All of a sudden, the American Navy is diminished to 1917 Pre-World War I levels of only 300 ships. The Army is at pre-1940 levels. The Air Force scraps 500 planes and planned to retire the use of the A-10 Thunderbolt close air support fighter. A further draw down of another 40,000 military personnel is in progress.‚Ä¢ All of a sudden half of our aircraft carriers are recalled for maintenance by Obama rendering the Atlantic unguarded, NONE are in the Middle East.‚Ä¢ All of a sudden Obama has to empty Guantanamo Bay of captured Jihadists and let them loose in Jihad-friendly Islamic states. He demands to close the facility.‚Ä¢ All of a sudden America will negotiate with terrorists and trade FIVE Taliban commanders for a deserter and Jihad sympathizer.‚Ä¢ All of a sudden there is no money for American poor, disabled veterans, jobless Americans, hungry Americans, or displaced Americans but there is endless money for Obama's "Syrian refugee" resettlement programs.‚Ä¢ All of sudden there is an ammunition shortage in the USA.‚Ä¢ All of a sudden, the most important thing for Obama to do after a mass shooting by two Jihadists, is disarm American Citizens.‚Ä¢ All of a sudden, the President of the United States cannot attend the Christian Funerals of a Supreme Court Justice and a former First Lady because of previous (seemingly unimportant) commitments.‚Ä¢ All of a sudden the President of the United States won‚Äôt attend the funeral of a flag-rank Officer (Gen. Greene) killed in action; he played golf. But he sends a big delegation to Michael Brown‚Äôs funeral. He sends a minor delegation to Margaret Thatcher‚Äôs funeral. He won‚Äôt acknowledge Chris Kyle‚Äôs murder but he‚Äôll fly the Flag at half-mast for Whitney Houston.‚Ä¢ All of a sudden, I‚Äôm sick to my stomach. I‚Äôm not sure the majority of Americans recognize the seriousness of the situation and how much ‚Äúprogress‚Äù has been made by Islam these last 7 years, a very brief time compared to a 75 year lifetime.If you agree, be strong enough to at least forward this to a few friends. Remember, Hillary will continue on this path. Trump will not
13 | Roxy Havens | 10154711776401336_10154711959276336 | üá∫üá∏ I wish to thank our military for their courage and bravery in the protection of our country. Last night I was reading the Padesta emails and one of them contained a clear message that disgusted and horrified me at the same time as all the emails have. It said she hated Americans. Hilary has fully identified herself what she really is. I pray that Americans open their eyes and their hearts and their conscience to vote for a man that will and the corruption that has been going on for too long.
14 | Melissa Dolan St Clair | 10154711776401336_10154711960311336 | The Obama Administration has absolutely just trying to make it look like Wikileaks is a Russian plant. It's not these are from podesto's laptop. They had their hands involved in Justice Scalia dying and I want to hear the news mention it and discuss it. If it was Donald Trump it would be all over the news to face prick
15 | Juan Acevedo | 10154711776401336_10154712028856336 | Right, he was " on " dress as an Afghan solider. Such BS!!!! When Bush was President we wiped out 80% of al-Qaeda within months. Why is this so difficult for our current administration. Oh yeah, that's because we have the biggest terrorists of them all in office. If they can have it there way. The liberals will elect Killary " his secon in command" to continue killing Americans. Vote Trump 2016 üíØ%üá∏

It is a sad day in the United States when you cannot display who you are voting for because of some scumbag tearing up your property or beating you for it we need to make a change people. And TRUMP will make that change. And has anyone seen where the insurance is going up 65 more percent most working people cannot afford that the lazy ones won't have a problem with it. That will be  the ones that will vote  for Hillary üôÑ
23 | Linda Chodroff | 10154711776401336_10154711978321336 | Get our Military back home out of the Hell Hole Obama on Purpose sent them too, so He could exercise His Dictatorship on America with HildaBeast. Less Military in America more wicked Washington has become.

Highly aggressive. I've yet to meet a trump voter I would consider a victim. Aggression doesn't fit the profile of a Democratic voter.

Trump's plan to handle isis is too radical and unnecessary. Obama and Hillary's strategy is working...." Nice try. I don't believe the mainstream media anymore. Isis is still a threat, more importantly sleeping cells in the US.
