2 | Marissa Peart | 1 | 10154036913825950_10154036935870950 | Anyone who takes him seriously is just as dumb as him. He previously stated how he thinks dark skinned women are ugly and because his daughter is a millionaire it doesn't count towards her. Why would anyone give this cough syrup sipping gremlin an interview in the first place?
3 | Dale Scott Morgan | 0 | 10154036913825950_10154036933675950 | Let's not throw the title of rich around too freely. Wealthy is what you strive to be. Rich folks go broke overnight regardless of color.

His style of hate-mongering politics makes America look like a third world country. The fact that he is even being considered for president is shameful.
9 | Craig Colt | 0 | 10154036913825950_10154036916905950 | .OUR FIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN PRESIDENT Do you really want 4 more years of the same? ...What have Hillary and Obama done for the african-american community to make "their lives" better in the last 8 years?...WE KNOW what they have done to make "illegals and refugees" lives better , but what about the black community?...One thing they DID NOT do was put the african-americans "first"....Between "illegals" and "refugees" , they have come first for "unskilled" jobs in this country , people with no special skills need these jobs to survive....Democrats excuse is always , " these are jobs americans wont do"....thats a bunch of bullchit...we have 10s of 1000s looking for these jobs but they are taken..."illegals and refugees" have them....Hillary is champion of open borders , she already said she wants an open "hemisphere" , in other words , ANYONE from S.America , Mexico , Central America , Canada can cross over into our country and reap the benefits...Just like the EU and Europe have now...The very reason for Britain left the EU....So i ask again , Obama being our 1st Black president -->...What have Hillary and Obama done to make lives better for the african-american community the last 8 years??

Religion is used as propaganda on both sides of the War on Terrorism. The cause is "greedy military interventions." We can end this war and prevent terrorism if we change our foreign policy and use more diplomacy. The outsourcing of U.S. jobs and illegal immigration are the result of foreign trade policy that focuses on business interests at the expense of workers' rights and the environment protection. We don't have to build a wall. The answer is to gradually increase wages and regulations abroad not lower them here.We need to get the influence of business out of politics. Higher wages and buying power will actually increase sales for businesses and expand the economy.

How much money is being spent on all this madness for only a four year job? With all the poverty, unemployment, hunger in our country, we sit back and think this is acceptable. Trump says things that are over the top. Hillary says she's never heard men say dirty things about women. Both these candidates are bull****ing Americans. We need to stand-up for America.

3 | Ray Shields | 2 | 10154036795070950_10154036838525950 | CNN quietly cut ties with Donna Brazile, the acting Democratic National Committee chair and a longtime contributor on the cable news network, after hacked emails published by WikiLeaks revealed that she had provided questions to the Hillary Clinton campaign in advance of a town hall and debate hosted by CNN during the Democratic primary.Now your bringing what we thought was decent people down with you.So Bernie was cheated.

Trump has never been under criminal investigation. People can get just about as many people for money or other reasons to say something bad about anyone...the media used to only say so and so said something about someone if it was news worthy. They would say their is no criminal investigation and the story would be dropped unless a criminal investigation happened.

21 | Beverly R. Allor | 0 | 10154036795070950_10154036880990950 | For those media pundits claiming the FBI investigation is nothing but a witch hunt, a partisan hit job, here's a list of the five prosecutable crimes Hillary committed without even mentioning those additional violations - i.e., fraud, collusion, solicitation - revealed in her recovered emails.Guilty....1. Of setting up an illegal server and using a private email account for official government correspondence without approval. FELONY2. Of mishandling/transmitting classified information over unsecured channels; including giving unauthorized personnel and/or private citizens access to said correspondence. FELONY3. Of not complying with a federal subpoena to surrender all emails; including those devices used to access said communications or store relevant materials. FELONY4. Of destroying Government property and evidence pertinent to a federal investigation. FELONY5. Of knowingly giving false testimony to both Congress and the FBI with the intent to deceive. FELONYCelebrities, politicians and military personnel have been arrested, demoted, discharged or sentenced to prison for far less: most notably, but hardly limited to, Martha Stewart, Dinesh D'Souza and General Petraeus. Yet, somehow, the most corrupt and deceitful candidate in recent history has evaded prosecution due to the orchestrated obstruction of justice waged by the Obama administration, and a complicit media propaganda campaign designed to sway and misinform the electorate.

25 | Gordon Gabaree | 0 | 10154036795070950_10154036821425950 | Hey go look at Mr. Trumps Contract to the American People!.Wow!.......He's got real answers to real problems and remember that I lock my doors at night and I've own homes with walls and so do alot of us for many different reasons.That doesn't make us racists! So listen to me, Millions of Trump supporters feel this way about Donald J. Trump....."We don't care if the guy swears... or how many times he's been married...or who he voted for, or what his income tax return shows. We want the problems fixed. Yes he's an egomaniac, but we don't care. We know he's not a racist, or bad to women, or all the other things the liberal media is trying to label him with. We know he's raised a good family, and that says a lot about him.The country is a mess because politicians suck, the Republican Party is two faced & gutless, and illegals are everywhere and Radical Islamic Terrorists are openly trying to hurt this country and make the civilized world adjust to them. We want it all fixed!We don't care that Trump is crude, we don't care that sometimes he changed a position.He's showing us he can be a flexible leader as we show him are concerns.We don't care that he fights with Megan Kelly, Rosie O'Donnell, and so many of the elected establishment. We don't care that Kasich, McConnel, the Bush's, and so many other top old and new Republicans refuse to endorse him for their own selfish reasons, and we know what they are. We don't care that he doesn't know the name of some Radical Islamic Terrorists, we don't care that he tried some businesses that didn't work out.Great businessmen built this country of ours in the likes of Rockefeller,Vanderbilt and Carnegie! They had bankruptcy's.This country is weak, bankrupt, our enemies are making fun of us, we are being invaded by illegals, we are becoming a nation of victims, where every Tom, Ricardo and Hasid is a special group with special rights to a point where we don't even recognize the country we were born and raised in, AND  JUST WANT IT FIXED. And TRUMP is the only guy who seems to understand what the people want.He even asks groups of us what we want him to do regarding issues that all of us live by.Wow, For the People,By the People!We're sick of politicians, sick of the Democratic and Republican Party. We're angry about the Iran deal, the budget, treatment of Israel, military weakness, lobbyists, special interests, overpaid politicians with their self serving bills and back room deals, trade deals, loss of jobs, manipulated economic numbers, businesses fleeing,Obamacare needs to be replaced and State borders need to be opened up for real healthcare competition and even the phoney Pay for Play Clinton Foundation.Americans are no longer going to be fooled, and the movement is out to change the direction we're taking. Trump may not be a saint, but he doesn't have lobbyist money holding him, he doesn't have political correctness restraining him, and all you know is that he has been very successful, a good negotiator, he has built a lot of things, he's flexible, and he's also not a politician. And he says he'll fix it. And we believe him because he is too much of an egotist to be proven wrong or looked at and called a liar.Public service has become elected greed. This may be our only chance to have a Non-Politician. He's not perfect, he's 70 years old and made his fortune and I think he's Truly  Genuine in his love of our counrty and wants to make things better for All.... Despite his flaws try and correct the mess, at least for 4 years. We must take the shot, because the consequences of putting Hillary Clinton in office are frightening. There is a tidal wave happening, and its going to overcome much of what's happened to this country and remember that Mike Pence is a Good Man and Politician standing beside Mr. Trump."

You know that’s called perjury….Did you miss hearing about her being fired from the Watergate staff for being dishonest and unethical?How about those 33,000 emails she deleted and then had the computer wiped clean by professionals? Did you miss that?How about deleting emails after she was subpoenaed to hand them over to the Fed? You realize that’s Obstruction of Justice, right?Oh, and how about getting the rapist of a teenage girl off on rape charges then laughing about it? Did you miss that too?How about when she lied to the American people about Benghazi? You realize that story about the video was a lie, and she knew it was a lie, right?Did you miss her lying to the American people about her emails?How about when she lied about being under sniper fire?Well, then there was those times she lied about lying to the American people. Miss those too?What about that ‘pay for play’ with the Clinton Cash Foundation? That’s kind of hard to miss, huh?Did you miss all those other scandals she was in? You know… TravelGate, FileGate, WhiteWater, Rose law Firm, Vince Foster… she has a long list of scandals, you know...Did you miss her belittling her husband's sexual harassment ( and rape ) accusers? Oh – but the Paula Jones case was settled for $850,000 and Bill was impeached… for lying…You know she was labeled "Extremely careless" about national security by the FBI, right?Have you caught her latest lies about not knowing what the (C) meant on the classified documents? Or, that she can’t remember any briefings on how to handle classified material?Did you know that during her interview with the FBI she said she couldn’t remember 39 times?Did you know that during the Star Investigation she used that same defense of ‘I don’t recall’ 56 times?Did you hear her say she will raise taxes on the middle class? Did you know she had to return stolen items from the White House the last time they left?Did you miss the fact that her and Bill Clinton stole 6 Billion Dollars that was meant to rebuild Haiti?Have you seen the movies and several documentaries made about her questionable ethics?Don’t you wonder why she made congress and others spend millions and millions of tax dollars having hearings and investigating her numerous times, finding that she lied, that would not have been spent if she would have simply told the truth in the first place ! Facts - all facts !But you are going to vote for her because.... she's a woman or you don't like Donald Trump? Now, That is Insane! Hillary Clinton has a lot more to hide than Donald Trump does!BUT ... Trump says mean things.

17 | April Luebke Winn | 0 | 10154036703175950_10154036919305950 | I asked a young  Lady at a game, how she could vote for Trump, a “misogynist, a racist and a bigot”. Here is her answer: Because I use my head to research and find out what candidates really are, not what the media wants me to think.  Because Donald Trump has more women in executive and managerial positions than any comparable company, which tells me he is not a misogynist.  Because he pays these women the same or more than their male counterparts, which tells me looks for capacity and skills in people, not color, gender or race.  Because he fought the West Palm Beach City Council to be able to open his newly purchased club, so he could include blacks and Jews as members, who had been banned until then. This tells me he is not a racist.  Because he has raised wonderful children who have turned out to be outstanding, hard-working and compassionate adults. He must be doing something right.  Because his economic plans makes sense, are conservative in nature, and I vote based of what is best for my family, my friends and my country.  Because everybody, the left and the right are afraid of him, the media is trying to destroy his image, and even foreign governments are voicing their opinions, so he must be doing something right. Clean house maybe?  Because I want a Supreme Court that will uphold the Constitution, not behave as minions of the administration.  I have had enough with judges who are more like political activists than law enforcers.    Because I fear for my family’s safety if the current trend of not confronting blatant terrorism continues – which is a threat to our way of life.  Because I am fed up with the rampant corruption of this administration.  Accountability in government is paramount, and as this administration has demonstrated, it is a foreign concept to them.  Because I am fed up with the political correctness gone wild, and because Trump is not afraid to say what everybody thinks but does not dare to say. A thug is a thug, regardless of color, and that's it.  Because it is about time someone puts America's interests ahead of other countries.  Because I know he recognizes and embraces America's exceptionalism, and will not tour the World apologizing for who we are. That tells me he is a patriot.  Because, unlike HRC, he has actually held a job, worked hard and achieved success.  And last, but not least, because I am more offended by what Hillary does than by what Trump says.shared from Gary Hostetler.

1 | Alan Bonardi | 41 | 10154036659465950_10154036663735950 | It appears that the Democratic party has become even more corrupt during Obama's 8 years as President. I am Registered as an Independent Voter but Democrats have driven me away. I am also disgusted by what Obama has done to our Helath Care and all the lies that were told before Democrats passed the Bill. Obamacare is destroying the hard working people of the Middle Class. Essentially it has increased poverty.

12 | Matt Matson | 1 | 10154036659465950_10154036824410950 | Here is something democrats and most of the media have a hard time honestly responding to....all the things said about Trump people say are criminal, from ties with Russia, his taxes, women he was said to have sexual grouped, bankruptcy or whatever....consider these undisputed facts...Obama and most democratic congressman hate him....if there was even the slightest bit of evidence all it takes is the president, or a congressman to present that to the FBI or DOJ and he would be under criminal investigation as a first step. Trump has never been under criminal investigation. People can get just about as many people for money or other reasons to say something bad about anyone...the media used to only say so and so said something about someone if it was news worthy. They would say their is no criminal investigation and the story would be dropped unless a criminal investigation happened.

BREAKING: Suspect captured in slayings of two Iowa police officers: http://cbsn.ws/2eUNn8H
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Farrah Lovinglife Pollock | 184 | 10154036558745950_10154036581285950 | Captured alive....killed two cops and captured ALIVE!!! Damn but be BLACK and sell cigarettes or cds killed on site!!! Tf?!?!?
2 | Erin Danielle J | 70 | 10154036558745950_10154036614245950 | So... he was upset because black people at a football game didn't stand up for the anthem and sat in peaceful protest. He caused a disturbance and was asked to leave by police. Out of anger, he ambushes two officers. 'Merica. Never change.
3 | Micheal Rogers | 93 | 10154036558745950_10154036566765950 | Many conservative whites are upset that the shooter is not black. It is a white confederate flag waving patriot.
4 | Windi Liberus | 44 | 10154036558745950_10154036577540950 | Slap on the white wrist and rehabilitation nothing to see here boy & girls
5 | Andre Buckner | 28 | 10154036558745950_10154036678420950 | You guys are making the black community look real stupid today. It doesn't matter if hes alive or not it should  just matter that he's captured. As a black man myself I'm embarrassed for these dumb ass comments and as a man that lives here in the city of Des Moines I'm just happy he's behind bars.
6 | Joe Goodman | 29 | 10154036558745950_10154036564305950 | Don't forget to mention the suspects actually YouTube channel with confederate flags etc......The Urbandale School District confirmed to the Des Moines Register that a man named Scott Greene was removed from the football stadium that day for waving a confederate flag. The stadium is at the same intersection where the Urbandale police officer was killed Wednesday morning, the newspaper reports.
7 | Mahogany Brown | 14 | 10154036558745950_10154036674500950 | Well lokk at that folks it wasn't blm. Smh white people have been saying it was blm all morning. White people on this thread hate hearing about race. But point it out every chance they get. If you want us to stop bitching about race then tell your fellow white friends to stop using subtle racism. it exists whether yoy want to except the truth or not.
8 | Willie Williams | 10 | 10154036558745950_10154036628520950 | I BlameDemocratsOBAMANAACPBLACK PANTHERSBLMMLKMALCOM XHARRIET TUBMANROSA PARKSThey are all responsible for the recent uprising of racial tension that has started in this country within the last 8yrs#MakeAmericaGreatAgain#GoTrump#AllLivesMatter
9 | Janet E Strickland Costello | 6 | 10154036558745950_10154036633230950 | It does not matter if he was captured alive or not. His life is now over. So who gives a damn what this POS skin color is
10 | Jessica Santos | 1 | 10154036558745950_10154036763620950 | Instead of being glad that this pos has been captured, even if it was alive, you all are bitching that he wasn't shot dead isn't that something, smh. The important thing is that he is off the street and not a danger to anyone else, civilian or law enforcement.
11 | Nicole Carter | 2 | 10154036558745950_10154036760350950 | It's quiet in here all morning before the identity was revealed it was BLM and the athletes whining!!!! But nah it's one of your radical ass (mentally ill)people. So it's quiet white people in here defending this degenerate. Smh!!!
12 | Yolanda Wilson | 0 | 10154036558745950_10154036934625950 | Wow he still alive, but Black and Brown Brothers are killed. Why can't they be taken alive too? Glad they caught him. Even if he was white and didn't die. Point is he caught.
13 | Sandy Luevano | 2 | 10154036558745950_10154036765440950 | After reading some of these comments you can see that racism is still a very large problem in every ethnic background , some people are more stupid than others.Two human beings lost their life the person that did it was caught and all you read is racism forgetting the fact that men lost their lives
14 | Alanna Manfredini | 0 | 10154036558745950_10154036804280950 | They released the names of the officers on another site. So tragic. One was a father and the other a young man. ( had to edit, not sure if i read correctly) Greene was taken to the hospital for "seizures". What a piece of ****
15 | Lisa Franklin | 10 | 10154036558745950_10154036681960950 | If I can get reincarnated, I want to come back as a white male. You can do anything. You rape women and kids and get probation. You can get in a standoff for weeks and not die or go to jail. You can even shoot police and get taken alive. You can even be a president and start wars or run for president and be a sexual assaulter and people will still love you. Yes, I want to come back as a white male so I can be a home grown terrorist.

17 | Curtis White | 19 | 10154036558745950_10154036624495950 | I wonder if they will take him to Starbucks for a Latte and Lemon Iced pound cake?

19 | Stephanie Paul | 25 | 10154036558745950_10154036587115950 | Kill 2 cops and captured alive....hmmmm no further comment required
20 | Sherry Barbour Bell | 0 | 10154036558745950_10154036652120950 | This was written by Steve Walton, I just want to share it with everyone.Imagine it is November 9, 2016 in America and we wake up knowing who our new President will be. If it is Hillary, think of the groups of people that will celebrate. Illegal Immigrants, criminals and future criminals who will be supported for pulling a gun on a police officer, planned parenthood, the media, and the list goes on and on that represent everything that is wrong with America. If you're still "with her," look around at who you'll be celebrating with. Now imagine waking up knowing that Trump is our new President. You may or may not like him, or really know what kind of president he will be. But here are some things you will know for sure:• The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.• The media has been neutered forever.• Career politicians will have lost all job security.• The guns in your home will safely stay there.• Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.• Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally• Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.• No more apologies to the world for being great!• Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.• Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.• There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.• The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.• The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.
21 | Kristen Cobb | 5 | 10154036558745950_10154036593565950 | Our police force is amazing. Less then 8 hours later they got there guy.
22 | Alex Urbina | 6 | 10154036558745950_10154036605640950 | I'm sure he was a trump supporter. Bringing hate. What a pos! R.I.P officers. #bluelivesmatter
23 | Matthew Wynn | 14 | 10154036558745950_10154036575565950 | This is how you know the shooter is white (in case you didn't see the photo).
24 | Teresa Verde | 8 | 10154036558745950_10154036600440950 | What's sad is that the color of ones skin is even brought up. People are dead...families are in mourning. Grow up .
25 | Theresa Jimenez | 5 | 10154036558745950_10154036625625950 | OMG home grown...terrorist, white man, captured alive...Gee?

All 33 Chinese coal miners trapped underground in a gas explosion earlier this week have been found dead.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Eric Matsunami | 8 | 10154036499675950_10154036538150950 | 6 years ago, exactly 33 Chilean miners we trapped...thankfully. That's just a crazy coincidence that it was the same exact number...hmmm
2 | William Loika | 1 | 10154036499675950_10154036597040950 | Trial runs were the leading cause of death for coal miners in the early days for America. Now that America has sold the coal contract to China they will have to go through the same.

Too many energy drinks resulted in this man being diagnosed with acute hepatitis.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Mindy Sandlin | 33 | 10154036443005950_10154036625090950 | This article is misleading. The guy had untreated hep c. His liver was already at risk and had been ravaged by a disease for who knows how long. I agree energy drinks are bad, and should be drank in moderation If at all. But the article made it seem as if his energy drink consumption was the reason for his acute hepatitis.
2 | Brent Mahlan | 3 | 10154036443005950_10154036762485950 | One time, just about every work day, I mix my one rockstar with a scoop or two of pre workout and get by just fine. Doctor says my BP is good and heart healthy..all depends on any pre existing continue and the person
3 | Adrina G. Wynecoop | 2 | 10154036443005950_10154036627035950 | I'm not surprised at all, the crap they put in those are gross. Caffeine Itself, if not in moderation, can cause horrible problems. Especially if you're a woman, we can have more risks than men. Bone loss, vitamin deficiencies, particularly low iron that I can think of. They will probably eventually cause a person to get autoimmune disease among many other health issues!
4 | Kevan Pierson | 0 | 10154036443005950_10154036581065950 | The most energy drinks i drunk was 2 a day. That can still cause problems depending on what brand you're drinking. Wired was one of the strongest out there. I had to take it easy and go to just 1 a day after it start messing with my kidneys.
5 | Amanda Lee Cass | 2 | 10154036443005950_10154036666905950 | I ended up in the hospital from energy drinks. Gave myself a condition called gastritis. HOLES in my stomach. Was on meds for a month. Mind you, this was damn near 11yrs ago when I graduated high school. But, I was working, going to school, no time for sleep... thought I was doing myself a favor by pounding energy drinks to make it through. All I did was hurt myself.
6 | Andrew Paul | 0 | 10154036443005950_10154036894760950 | From a medial point of view, any inflammation of the liver can be characterised as hepatitis. Hepato is Greek for liver. Adding the suffix -itis to a word means inflammation. The hepatitis a/b/c etc are simply characterisations of infections who's primary symptoms is swelling of the liver leading to disfunction.
7 | Leo Zheng | 1 | 10154036443005950_10154036633185950 | Are you really that lacking of energy lol?? Cuz I know some people who work 2-3 jobs a day and they don't need to drink that shit or even coffee...
8 | Robin Moraga-Saldarelli | 0 | 10154036443005950_10154036926170950 | You're just now finding this out? I've known about these drinks 4 years. I've had friends that drink that crap and it is cause nothing but problems with their intestines. Some as far as surgery
9 | David Hill | 16 | 10154036443005950_10154036488390950 | One time I mixed an monster energy and a 5 hour energy. I thought I was going to die. Never do that again

She's a New World Order Globalist who hates America and the sovereignty of all the nations, not just America. She wants a ONE WORLD GOVERNMENT and ONE WORLD RELIGION....that's their AGENDA.2. She's a LIAR about everything...and she's damn good at it. Her father, Satan is the master of all lies. Nuff said.3. She doesn't care about homosexual and women's rights....as a matter of fact, she doesn't care about anyone's rights, just hers and her global NWO buddies and it's a very small club. You're not invited.4. Her resume speaks for itself. Her whole career has been nothing but lies, corruption, criminal activity and SECRECY! That's how you know she's wicked, they do their dealings in darkness behind closed doors. Remember, she said she has TWO FACES....one in public....the other in private."Ye shall know them by their FRUITS!" ~ Jesus ChristWoe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!

8 | Scott Descoteaux | 4 | 10154036361810950_10154036534075950 | So the headline of this says "Al Franken weighs in on Clinton's trust issues", then the quote you put on top is. “I think he’s a man with a very short attention span,” Al Franken said of Trump.Do you not see the irony in that at all? That's just hilarious! Talk about short attention. Democrats hate that they know she is the most corrupt person in the history of this country, so they pivot any chance they can to stop talking about her. She's pure evil!!

10 | Mary Linderberg | 4 | 10154036361810950_10154036468625950 | I asked a young  Lady at a game, how she could vote for Trump, a “misogynist, a racist and a bigot”. Here is her answer: Because I use my head to research and find out what candidates really are, not what the media wants me to think.  Because Donald Trump has more women in executive and managerial positions than any comparable company, which tells me he is not a misogynist.  Because he pays these women the same or more than their male counterparts, which tells me looks for capacity and skills in people, not color, gender or race.  Because he fought the West Palm Beach City Council to be able to open his newly purchased club, so he could include blacks and Jews as members, who had been banned until then. This tells me he is not a racist.  Because he has raised wonderful children who have turned out to be outstanding, hard-working and compassionate adults. He must be doing something right.  Because his economic plans makes sense, are conservative in nature, and I vote based of what is best for my family, my friends and my country.  Because everybody, the left and the right are afraid of him, the media is trying to destroy his image, and even foreign governments are voicing their opinions, so he must be doing something right. Clean house maybe?  Because I want a Supreme Court that will uphold the Constitution, not behave as minions of the administration.  I have had enough with judges who are more like political activists than law enforcers.    Because I fear for my family’s safety if the current trend of not confronting blatant terrorism continues – which is a threat to our way of life.  Because I am fed up with the rampant corruption of this administration.  Accountability in government is paramount, and as this administration has demonstrated, it is a foreign concept to them.  Because I am fed up with the political correctness gone wild, and because Trump is not afraid to say what everybody thinks but does not dare to say. A thug is a thug, regardless of color, and that's it.  Because it is about time someone puts America's interests ahead of other countries.  Because I know he recognizes and embraces America's exceptionalism, and will not tour the World apologizing for who we are. That tells me he is a patriot.  Because, unlike HRC, he has actually held a job, worked hard and achieved success.  And last, but not least, because I am more offended by what Hillary does than by what Trump says.
11 | Tom Beatty | 0 | 10154036361810950_10154036812890950 | The article says "well known for his career as a comedian". That is a stretch at best. The same state that gave us Gov. Jesse Ventura. Another liberal clown. It shows how seriously many on the left take elections!!
12 | Will McGinnis | 1 | 10154036361810950_10154036867075950 | All you folks who are bashing Clinton... need to honestly look at Trump as well... neither candidate is what we might call 'morally superior'... Trump is a mess as well.. that said... it comes down to policy... Frankly, Clinton has policies that will do more for the middle class than any other candidate... so if you can put aside all the business of sending one or the other to hell... take an honest look at their policies & vote your conscience
13 | Steve Lynn | 6 | 10154036361810950_10154036374540950 | I hope Trump don't forget about bringing those 20 million very high paying jobs back from overseas and the almost free high quality health insurance for all Americans. Not to forget Americans will have very little tax to pay.
14 | Tony Gray | 1 | 10154036361810950_10154036572435950 | Sorry but if either Orange Hitler or Gramma Nixon wins the election, the country becomes completely ungovernable. I don't mean gridlock. I mean total madness. Who's fault is that anyway? Voters--You allowed it by way of your passivity and half-interested foolishness. With over 300 million, no reasonable person could say these candidates represent our best. Of course we know you will blame someone other than yourself for the predicament. Rather than pondering the non sequiturs raised by the mass media, take a moment to consider what is your karma in this situation?
15 | John Hourihan | 0 | 10154036361810950_10154036581610950 | In 1964 I graduated from high school. I was awake, informed and tuned in to the country around me. I saw the vicious truth of what we are on the verge of ushering back into our country. No matter which candidate you support, please listen to what I saw back then. I had seen the courage of Rosa Parks and of the Freedom Riders. I watched churches burned with people, some of them children, inside. I watched boys killed for “looking at” a white woman. I watched the helpless president try his best to stop the murders across the southern part of our country. Police cruisers pulling over cars and then killing the occupants if they were black. Arrests were made, they weren’t charged with murder. They were charged with withholding the civil rights of the people they killed. The charges didn’t matter. All-white juries found the police officers innocent. In 1963 I saw the KKK torch a church and burn to death four little girls because of the color of their skin. State legislators stood up against the federal government in an effort to continue the policies of segregation. These officials were active members of these hate groups. Now these groups, KKK, white supremacists, anti-semite, the entire alt. right hate groups are en masse supporting one candidate, Donald Trump, because as the leader of the KKK says, “His policies are our policies.” When you look at that ballot in front of you in the next few days please ask yourself if you are ready to vote for a return to those days and the days decades earlier when the violence was even worse. This is what Donald Trump, a proven racist, means by “Make America Great Again.” Please don’t bring these people back to power. Please vote for Clinton.
16 | Karen Drennen | 0 | 10154036361810950_10154036880335950 | I am hoping that if Trump should win, the news that is reported from your network should not insinuate a hatred for the Trump supporters that is presently viewed in your broadcasts. As you know, the DNC has been the source of violence incited at Trump rallies. Please do not follow suit.
17 | David James | 8 | 10154036361810950_10154036386900950 | Hillary is destroying the Democrat party and I can no longer vote for her, every week it's something else!
18 | Warren Murray | 0 | 10154036361810950_10154036583505950 | While the country is divided on who is the best candidate, neither can run on their history as a person. Some say Trump is because he is was not a politician and Hillary had her woes as one. Others say Hillary because Trump has a questionable business, womanizing tax evasion and racial discrimination past. It all boils down to whose character and plan for American we like the best, and while many of our opinions are clouded by racism, sexism, political affiliation and partiality, we must not lose focus on what matters. It's not who has lived a perfect life in their past because none of us are without sin or mistakes, but who do we trust to hold the future of our country and children in mind while they make decisions in office. Hillary is use to being accountable to the people, while Trump is use to being accountable to no one, not even his wives, and that's dangerous. We must choose wisely !

2 | Byblos Saad | 17 | 10154036308475950_10154036352585950 | Wow, almost everyone is blaming everybody but the shooter?!! It's a mental problem and a gun problem. All I hope for is that justice will be served and that terrorist won't be given the white privilege and gets acquitted.
3 | Jill Fisher Foster | 2 | 10154036308475950_10154036408885950 | I'm in such disbelief that this happened in my state, so close to home, I always knew the potential could exist but this is something you see on TV from somewhere else not in our backyards.  My stomach turns for the families of these officers that were taken by a coward pos.
4 | Becky Rice | 15 | 10154036308475950_10154036342315950 | We need to get a grip on our mental illness and drug problems in this country. Prayers to our men and women in blue. God keep you safe as you put your life's on the line to protect us.
5 | D Edward Farrar | 6 | 10154036308475950_10154036419590950 | Well, since it appears the shooter, Scott Michael Greene, was a caucasian male with white supremacist leanings (his previous run-in with the police was for waving a Confederate flag during the National Anthem at the beginning of a football game at Urbandale High School) I think we can reasonably rule out any claims that he is part of BLM, or that he was inspired by Obama ... but, nevertheless, you just know those are all going to be plastered across more Facebook memes than anyone can count over the next couple of days — Joe Wilson below has already begun ranting about how it's all Obama's fault.
6 | Emmanu El | 9 | 10154036308475950_10154036320895950 | My condolences to these two heroes. God Bless them and i grieve with their families.

Respect to the Heroes of America. God bless your good works and may the Archangel Michael watches over you all protecting us.

8 | Lealand Bruce | 2 | 10154036308475950_10154036384480950 | If guilty & responsible for the murders of these 2 police officers, then Scott Greene deserves everything that is coming to him. Senseless to be blown away while sitting inside your cruiser, not bothering anyone. Apparently walked up to them & blew those cops away. Similar to what happened to 2 NYPD officers Liu & Ramos. Now those cops kids, if they have any, will have to grow up without their daddies. Why would anyone do this?

3 | Annette L Hicks | 15 | 10154036244655950_10154036310330950 | It's entirely possible that a new polio virus evolved in unvaccinated populations, or that another virus has evolved that resembles it in effect.  That's what viruses do, they evolve.
4 | Jeffrey Hofer | 0 | 10154036244655950_10154036756285950 | AFM may result from a direct virus attack on the spinal cord, or by an immune attack triggered by a virus, or by something else. If a polio-like virus is circulating in the U.S., the possibility of its provocation by one or more vaccines has to be considered.
5 | Melodie Brown | 3 | 10154036244655950_10154036445085950 | It's the vaccines. It shocks me how truly blind people are. I was a nurse for 14 years. Till after they vaccinated my son and he almost died and is permanently injured because of them. Staying in denial will not save you or your kids. The time to awaken is now!!

9 | Juan Pablo Villacis | 8 | 10154036244655950_10154036255390950 | Donald Trump was right about illegal immigration! They bring problems. And as an American hispanic, I'm tired of how all of these coward racist liberals that hate America like Obama, Clinton, Sanders, and their supporters are trying to turn this great country into a 3rd world one. Unfortunately, one of the biggest problems we have right now is the media and entertainment that are always trying to tell us how to think. They have created enough imbeciles that would re-elect a failure like Obama. Even more, I'm supposed to bow down to anti-American Obama, love liberal policies no matter how destructive they are, love bigger enslaving government, and be in favor of illegal immigration because of the color of my skin... disgusting. That's why I and others support Donald Trump. Please support the movement by getting the "Trump Strong" t-shirt at:www.teespring.com/trumpstrong .And let's Make America Strong Again! Thank you.

18 | Philip Chamberland | 0 | 10154036244655950_10154036475225950 | What you need to know about Hillary Clinton.......1. She's a New World Order Globalist who hates America and the sovereignty of all the nations, not just America. She wants a ONE WORLD GOVERNMENT and ONE WORLD RELIGION....that's their AGENDA.2. She's a LIAR about everything...and she's damn good at it. Her father, Satan is the master of all lies. Nuff said.3. She doesn't care about homosexual and women's rights....as a matter of fact, she doesn't care about anyone's rights, just hers and her global NWO buddies and it's a very small club. You're not invited.4. Her resume speaks for itself. Her whole career has been nothing but lies, corruption, criminal activity and SECRECY! That's how you know she's wicked, they do their dealings in darkness behind closed doors. Remember, she said she has TWO FACES....one in public....the other in private."Ye shall know them by their FRUITS!" ~ Jesus ChristWoe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!

Hillary will NOT protect it. Go back and listen to the 3rd debate to what she says. She wants judges who will twist it. She endorsed Trump 100%.
20 | Gordon Gabaree | 0 | 10154036244655950_10154036621860950 | Hey go look at Mr. Trumps Contract to the American People!.Wow!.......He's got real answers to real problems and remember that I lock my doors at night and I've own homes with walls and so do alot of us for many different reasons.That doesn't make us racists! So listen to me, Millions of Trump supporters feel this way about Donald J. Trump....."We don't care if the guy swears... or how many times he's been married...or who he voted for, or what his income tax return shows. We want the problems fixed. Yes he's an egomaniac, but we don't care. We know he's not a racist, or bad to women, or all the other things the liberal media is trying to label him with. We know he's raised a good family, and that says a lot about him.The country is a mess because politicians suck, the Republican Party is two faced & gutless, and illegals are everywhere and Radical Islamic Terrorists are openly trying to hurt this country and make the civilized world adjust to them. We want it all fixed!We don't care that Trump is crude, we don't care that sometimes he changed a position.He's showing us he can be a flexible leader as we show him are concerns.We don't care that he fights with Megan Kelly, Rosie O'Donnell, and so many of the elected establishment. We don't care that Kasich, McConnel, the Bush's, and so many other top old and new Republicans refuse to endorse him for their own selfish reasons, and we know what they are. We don't care that he doesn't know the name of some Radical Islamic Terrorists, we don't care that he tried some businesses that didn't work out.Great businessmen built this country of ours in the likes of Rockefeller,Vanderbilt and Carnegie! They had bankruptcy's.This country is weak, bankrupt, our enemies are making fun of us, we are being invaded by illegals, we are becoming a nation of victims, where every Tom, Ricardo and Hasid is a special group with special rights to a point where we don't even recognize the country we were born and raised in, AND  JUST WANT IT FIXED. And TRUMP is the only guy who seems to understand what the people want.He even asks groups of us what we want him to do regarding issues that all of us live by.Wow, For the People,By the People!We're sick of politicians, sick of the Democratic and Republican Party. We're angry about the Iran deal, the budget, treatment of Israel, military weakness, lobbyists, special interests, overpaid politicians with their self serving bills and back room deals, trade deals, loss of jobs, manipulated economic numbers, businesses fleeing,Obamacare needs to be replaced and State borders need to be opened up for real healthcare competition and even the phoney Pay for Play Clinton Foundation.Americans are no longer going to be fooled, and the movement is out to change the direction we're taking. Trump may not be a saint, but he doesn't have lobbyist money holding him, he doesn't have political correctness restraining him, and all you know is that he has been very successful, a good negotiator, he has built a lot of things, he's flexible, and he's also not a politician. And he says he'll fix it. And we believe him because he is too much of an egotist to be proven wrong or looked at and called a liar.Public service has become elected greed. This may be our only chance to have a Non-Politician. He's not perfect, he's 70 years old and made his fortune and I think he's Truly  Genuine in his love of our counrty and wants to make things better for All.... Despite his flaws try and correct the mess, at least for 4 years. We must take the shot, because the consequences of putting Hillary Clinton in office are frightening. There is a tidal wave happening, and its going to overcome much of what's happened to this country and remember that Mike Pence is a Good Man and Politician standing beside Mr. Trump."

He is standing on his own feet.His message has become strongly dynamic from his starting point and I am throwing as much coal as I can to keep this train rolling.
2 | Charlie Ritter | 83 | 10154036238835950_10154036245970950 | Code 18 section 2071...Returning the money does not correct the wrong. If a bank robber stole money from a bank and then returned the money. He/She still robbed the bank and is called a felon and a bank robber! When will the scandals go away with the Clinton family. If she is elected this is what the nation will have to put with during her term. Nothing but a term of scandals that reach back to before Arkansas, even college.
3 | Steve Baber | 100 | 10154036238835950_10154036250400950 | So, I am reading that Hillary is really upset that the FBI is "dumping" on her right before the election.... I want to say to Mrs. Clinton, "So Hillary, how does it feel to be aborted 8 days before delivery?"
4 | Reid Davis | 71 | 10154036238835950_10154036242075950 | Hillary's record with women is not stellar... How about the women that accused Bill of assult that Hillary berated? Or the mom's of the Benghazi victims?
5 | Jody Parker | 45 | 10154036238835950_10154036242820950 | Hillary Clinton until they reopen the FBI case would not pose on stage with American flags. As of recent I have not seen her giving a speech where she has not had American flags behind her. This woman is a sociopathic pandering criminal nightmare for this country. And more than resembles the personality cult that Hitler was born from

Or if you are black she'll call you a super predator or if you are Latino she say you are needy. How can anyone believe the crap that comes out of her mouth...
8 | Paula Trammell | 15 | 10154036238835950_10154036324105950 | Clinton is just using the same worn out desperate line. Dragging women around the country that Trump said something to 30 years ago. Ignoring the fact that her husband did the same thing and she defended it and blamed the women. I don't think people who actually care about this country thinks a bunch of gossip is more dangerous than her multiple FBI investigations, the 4 Americans she turned her back on and let die. Her criminal actions of deleting thousands of e-mails AFTER they caught her. lying to Congress and the FBI under oath, also criminal, And she calls Americans deplorable.

10 | Keenan Reese | 9 | 10154036238835950_10154036305600950 | Hillary sinks to the lowest form of political scum by bringing in unproven slander, when her own personal life is rocked with a proven sexual dievient as a husband. Doesn't get anymore pathetic than that.
11 | Kristy Rodriguez | 2 | 10154036238835950_10154036606835950 | LMBO, I wonder how the woman at her foundation feel about how she treats women after learning she pays them half as much as men. She sure did not care about the women her husband raped when she sent thugs to harass and intimidate them. And she definitely did not care about women when she sent the DNC operatives out to cause riots and havoc at Trump rallies. Shame on her. she is disgusting.

15 | Richard Weed | 1 | 10154036238835950_10154036385205950 | she will be playing the sympathy card soon.. wont be long and she will admit to her and bill are dying of aids.. but I hope she dies in prison like she should .. she is now linked to at least one death .. if they don't charge her all hell will break loose
16 | Anissa Todd | 2 | 10154036238835950_10154036315550950 | But then freaked out when a lone protester against Bill's conduct shouted out- " I'm not looking back but moving forward! Don't be distracted!" Hypocrite
17 | Ben Quijada | 0 | 10154036238835950_10154036776110950 | Yep. The democrats narrative today is "lets be honest". Really? How can she be honest when she denies, delays and defames the facts, the truth about her own hypocrisy, her experience, her legacy. We all know (statism) more taxes won't save one person.

20 | Debbie Shuler | 1 | 10154036238835950_10154036470340950 | The absurdity of this is she is married to a man who has exploited women in far worse ways than Trump has been accused of doing! The Clintons need to be jailed and the key thrown over the border!
21 | Steve Bolton | 5 | 10154036238835950_10154036368085950 | And Hilary the one that supports country's that beat and kill women if they get raped.

22 | Darrin Richards | 2 | 10154036238835950_10154036378015950 | The Clinton's have several separate FBI investigations going on right know.

The Clinton's pay to play where Hillary Clinton gave the Haiti disaster relief funds to her biggest donors is under a FBI investigation against the Clinton's good friend Attorney General Loretta Lynch.
23 | Cindy Weaver | 1 | 10154036238835950_10154036558705950 | Her rallies are just 'bashers'.  I've really heard nothing of any substance of any kind of actual change she would make if elected.  She never says HOW.  Same ol, same ol.

4 | Carol Ann Lovegrove | 108 | 10154036197120950_10154036204920950 | There is nothing in the article that mentions Hilary Clinton. This is irresponsible journalism.
5 | Jason Bridges | 72 | 10154036197120950_10154036223980950 | Why is Donna Brasile still in charge of the DNC? Why hasn't Hillary addressed and apologized for taking debate questions in advance? Why aren't you reporting this

8 | Darrin Richards | 31 | 10154036197120950_10154036246510950 | This is only what she has been caught accepting folks. This is basically the same way WallStreet is funding Hillary, the Hedge Funders are giving Hillary Clinton millions and they are being repaid in bonuses at the years end. Hillary Clinton has taken 100's of Millions from foreign governments and foreign interest that is a fact! Her biggest donors consist of 911 terrorist linked foreign governments that's a fact!.. look it up.
9 | Truman Walls | 25 | 10154036197120950_10154036249170950 | Well this seems misleading, not sure how any of the donation recipients could know the donations were illegal. In fact, this article even points out that at this time no one knows for sure if they were illegal. It also points out that Democrats weren't the only ones to receive these donations, just the primary receivers. We know reading is beyond the capabilities of most Trump supporters, so I guess the damage is done with the headline and caption, but truthfully, this article doesn't really say shit.
10 | Gary Bailey | 12 | 10154036197120950_10154036353990950 | What kind of ignorant headline is this? The article has nothing to do with Hillary!!

13 | Rob Jones | 11 | 10154036197120950_10154036253190950 | Not a big surprise given (1) the finance irregularities of her husband's fundraising, and (2) the foreign donor cash she's managed to launder thru her foundation. That last part would be a good story to report on if CBS wants to drop the fluffy campaign pieces and get back into the news biz. That's the REAL "foreigners trying to influence US politics" story of this cycle.
14 | Debra Chavez Cortinas | 4 | 10154036197120950_10154036500075950 | Trump is the worst! I'd like the journalists to go after his emails and taxes to start with. What we know about this disgusting man is enough without digging deep into his affairs domestic and abroad. He has no military experience and what I have heard coming from him alone is alarming. Hillary has been ripped apart and  dissected by the media and she is still in the running. That tells me they can't make anything stick. However if that ever did changed my vote would still go to Kain never to trump! Hillary 2016!
15 | Misty Leckliter | 3 | 10154036197120950_10154036355415950 | Seriously....I think both of these candidates are a joke. Is this really what our choices are for the next 4 years. We need to just fire every political figure in office and just start over. They are all corrupt in some sort of way. For years, every election is always picking the lesser of 2 evils. Why not put a regular Joe in office. Someone who knows what it's actually like to try to survive out here in the poor man's world. But that will never happen because a regular Joe can't afford millions to campaign. Its so sad what our government has become.
16 | Tatyana Camelia | 2 | 10154036197120950_10154036356040950 | That's why trump must release his taxes! We ought to know who is running for the office. We already know about his abuse of the system, what else he is hiding?!
17 | Ben Quijada | 1 | 10154036197120950_10154036780260950 | Yep. Which law firm? The State Department aka Clinton Foundation, Clinton Global Initiative or the Clinton Trust? How can anyone elect all this fraud, larceny and corruption and expect change? WTF is wrong with all you Americans?
18 | Rodney Jones | 6 | 10154036197120950_10154036240265950 | There's no telling how much corruption is going on with Hillary's campaign. When a criminal like her with Benghazi blood on her hands who has protected and enabled and predator and enriched herself at the risk of America's classified info runs for office, there is no limit to the crimes.
19 | Tom Beatty | 1 | 10154036197120950_10154036736750950 | One scandal after another, all the way back to Whitewater and Travelgate, Vince Foster!! People under the age of 35 have no idea unless someone informs them!!!
20 | Sammie Kay Smith | 1 | 10154036197120950_10154036377955950 | Wow! We all Need to become politicians! This was just from one donor.. 😐Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has received nearly $130,000 from the firm since 2007, told the Boston Globe she will not return any money unless investigators find the donations were illegal.
21 | Christopher Bailey | 1 | 10154036197120950_10154036797790950 | And yet again people think it's ok to do this as long as it gets Killary and her cronies ( Elizabeth Warren) elected. Note: Warren says she not giving hers back unless it is illegal .? It is illegal you dumbass!
22 | Bart Wiggins | 2 | 10154036197120950_10154036314280950 | As many Americans were made aware on Friday, the FBI has reopened the investigation into Hillary’s email scandal. However, a few theories circling the web indicate that the recent turn of events points to something much darker.In fact, as Internet sleuths have more time to dig around the deepest corners of the web, it seems as though FBI Director James Comey’s hand may have actually been forced when it comes to the investigation. Seeing how both Wikileaks and famed hacker Kim Dotcom have Hillary’s 33,000 emails and are intent on releasing them in the upcoming week, the FBI was forced to make a move – but things only get more interesting the further down the rabbit hole we go.At this point, the media is taking Wikileaks very seriously, and considering who could be implicated in the leak, something had to be done. In short, the theory suggests that several high-ranking officials up to and including Barack Obama are actually involved in Hillary’s little scandal.
23 | Joe Kooinga | 1 | 10154036197120950_10154036576835950 | So saying "Hillary Clinton's campaign" isn't mentioning Clinton? Who's campaign is it mentioning then? Are you just so liberally blind that you can't read words that prove you candidate corrupt? It's a common liberal problem.
24 | Jessie Rachow-Pangrazio | 0 | 10154036197120950_10154036816690950 | Right, left, democrat, republican... all American. Let's fight over who is the worst, as if ANY corruption should be accepted in the White House. How about talking about eliminating a two party system which has done nothing except divide American citizens. We are now reduced to arguing about which criminal is the worst TO RUN OUR COUNTRY. Stop voting for corruption period, or there will be worse to come. I'm voting 3rd party this year.
25 | Kimberlee Deinema | 2 | 10154036197120950_10154036452360950 | Yet, she's most likely still going to become president no matter what she does, which is funny because I literally do not know a single person that supports her. The election is a fucking joke. I am so scared for Election Day.

As of recent I have not seen her giving a speech where she has not had American flags behind her. This woman is a sociopathic pandering criminal nightmare for this country. And more than resembles the personality cult that Hitler was born from
2 | Charles Damian King | 163 | 10154036167780950_10154036177830950 | You scum at CBS will do anything to get the crooked Wall Street  whore elected there are 10 times more BLM terrorist killing cops then there are KKK members the KKK is dead and has been for 20 years
3 | John McAuliffe | 137 | 10154036167780950_10154036169755950 | Last night, Hillary mande an emotional plea over 9/11. But Hillary's whole campaign has been accepting funds from the Saudi regime, which are now recognised to have sponsored 9/11. There is a difference between this and that. On this, Trump has no say whether or not they endorse him. On accepting funds from those behind 9/11, Hillary has total control, and she welcomed it.
4 | Lee Russ | 101 | 10154036167780950_10154036175345950 | Wait...wait....Obama has " black lives matter" at the white house. They hate cops and most white people. And that's cool. Trump DENOUNCES the kkk endorsement and y'all are bad mouthing him. ARE YOU KIDDING ME.
5 | Jim Gavin | 75 | 10154036167780950_10154036172140950 | This is unbelievable. Americans should be outraged that the media and Hiliary have taken away one of our most important fundamental rights The right to vote. By Hiliary accepting these questions she has rigged the election and should immediately be disqualified. FORGET WHO GAVE HER THE QUESTIONS..SHE TOOK THEM IS THE ISSUE.
6 | Ron Styles | 33 | 10154036167780950_10154036182125950 | Hillary is backed by Muslim terrorists and illegal Invaders about reporting that. CBS is the mouthpiece for the Democratic Socialist Regime.
7 | Blakeney Adams | 36 | 10154036167780950_10154036178070950 | Is this like the Black Panthers endorsing Hillary Clinton? 😂😂😂. What a stupid and absolutely desperate attempt to make this man look bad. It's just gotten ridiculously pathetic. Who gives a flying rats behind what the KKK thinks? Give it up because you just look pathetic and weak. Can't fix stupid. 😂😂😂.
8 | Richard Bailey | 18 | 10154036167780950_10154036229630950 | CBS News You and the other left wing news organizations are in a panic desperation mode and will print about anything to discredit Donald Trump. You know he's gonna win.
9 | Dana Paul | 13 | 10154036167780950_10154036203115950 | Since Trump's been cleared of any  Russian ties the msm will keep reaching for diversions...Marchado, the kkk, etc, etc. Anything on the DOJ?, Podesta  dumping emails, Loretta on the tarmac? What happened to legitimate journalism?
10 | Lisa Donaho | 13 | 10154036167780950_10154036197925950 | It seems that to many emails are the most important issue in this election. Sexual assault, racism, cheating, etc. have absolutely no bearing on their choice.
11 | Brian Sapp | 11 | 10154036167780950_10154036198785950 | Trump himself did NOT denounce the endorsement, the people behind his campaign did. I wanna see Trump say it.
12 | Catherine Smith | 6 | 10154036167780950_10154036199780950 | What ever you can't control the KKK or the black lives matter just people causing more race issues ....just lil the KKK uses the confederate flag no one gave them permission they just did it if people would get there heads out of their a$$e$ they might relize they are part of the problem ....cant stand racist people!
13 | Mary O'Connor | 10 | 10154036167780950_10154036192085950 | Just goes to show you from these ignoramus' replies that education is a good thing and so is critical thinking. Keep watching Fox   and listening to Limbaugh if you want someone else to think for you.
14 | Nicki Payne | 2 | 10154036167780950_10154036265155950 | So what?  If everything up till now has not repulsed his supporters nothing will.  The bar is set so low it is actually now about 20 feet underground.  There are either no standards or you have to be a confirmed ignorant douchebag to be the republican nominee.
15 | Jeromy Baldwin | 17 | 10154036167780950_10154036174850950 | What are you talking about. Only democrats are scheduled to vote by november 8th. Republicans have until the 28th after Trumps child rape hearing. No worries. You got time.
16 | Rick McNamara | 0 | 10154036167780950_661263450699547 | In a statement, the Trump campaign said: "Mr. Trump and the campaign denounces hate in any form. This publication is repulsive and their views do not represent the tens of millions of Americans who are uniting behind our campaign."
17 | Kimberly Miller | 6 | 10154036167780950_10154036187620950 | I'm sure he has with 6 days to go.... Shame he couldn't do that 18months ago but now that they have helped get him where he's at seems only natural for him that he'd turn his back on them....

The racists and the misogynists alone take up 3/4's. His lenders take up the rest. Putin probably hates being in that basket.
19 | Eric Larson | 1 | 10154036167780950_10154036397850950 | I hate when I have to disavow the KKK for supporting me.  Oh wait...I never have to do that.  Because I'm not a xenophobic racist division-monger.
20 | Sarah E Wiggins | 0 | 10154036167780950_10154036354565950 | To quote Hillary "What Difference Does It Make" BLM backs Hillary and the KKK says their endorsing Trump, the only difference is is that eight cops weren't ambushed in the name of KKK however they were in the name of BLM! Give it up already CBS!
21 | Christy McCurdy | 4 | 10154036167780950_10154036319830950 | Ok...I mean I guess the KKK can endorse Trump..like the BLM folks endorse Hillary.We are all a bunch of babies whining for equality right? Next news please. Like I didn't even read this garbage🚮
22 | Sharon Pugh | 2 | 10154036167780950_10154036354170950 | Donald espouses Fascist ideals such as rounding up a minority group with a new police force. Then he denies that is what he said. He is either woefully ignorant of US law or pandering to the xenophobic. He is a narcissist. He, too, may be prosecuted for fraud and possibly sex crimes. Neither of our presidential choices is acceptable.
23 | Aaron Hochstetler | 0 | 10154036167780950_661254770700415 | It's just really sad that this is the conversation a week before Election Day.

I'm really really scared for this country.
24 | Irma Mcmillan | 1 | 10154036167780950_10154036258375950 | This is another plot of Hillary's making everyone knows it was southern democrats who started the kik to keep minorities in the South From voting or voting for someone other then the democrats.   People aren't as stupid as you say they are hillary

We only have a few days to finish his chances of leading this country over the cliff.I am NOT a Republican by any means in case someone LOL LOL thought otherwise. I was saying this morning though that if this country were facing an election and the only 2 running were Mitt Romney and Josef Stalin and one WOULD win I would vote for Romney.I have a REAL problem with news commentators, pundits, so called Christians, Jews, Muslims etc etc or anyone talking about Clinton and Trump as if they were similar and we were just choosing between apples and orange.They completely treat Trump as if being a Woman hating, Racist , lying, Homophobic,corrupt, Tax dodging moron, war monger were just a normal thing. There is almost nobody that Trump has not offended.Hillary has 40 years of actual public service behind her. YES she screwed up with EMAILS, but NO crimes were committed. Yes she received speaking fees from big $ people. Considering the climate of dark $$$$ , Citizens United etc etc that we have lived under, how the Hell else would ANYONE be able to run for President.I voted PROUDLY for Hillary and anyone that would even consider voting for Trump is a DISGRACEFUL, DISGUSTING individual, I want NOTHING to do with you. This is not negotiable. If you see no radical differences between them, than you are either totally stupid and blind or else you are all the things he is. The News Media ... about as corrupt as he is.

3 | Kevin D Turner | 1 | 10154036114735950_10154036321320950 | I believe that she knew...but I've not seen the specific evidence so I (nor anyone not privy to the REAL evidence) can know the real truth at this time. I do know that the FBI knew of his radicalization and did nothing...that is one of the most important pieces to this story (in my opinion) but it's being missed because people have the taste of Muslim blood running down their fangs.

17 | Anton Cristian Talin | 0 | 10154036095615950_10154036111595950 | 992 Pope Francis, Jorge Mario Bergoglio has read this book. Monsignor ...., has telephoned me, for to discuss in private, in the Vatican, with the Pope Francis, about this book. The book: The experiment military theological S666N, Eternal Order Infinite! Is a book where it was revealed, all the secrets and mystery, about all gods, the souls, the religions, the wars, and the policies. It is a book in which have been identified and proved that have been criminals, idiots, racists, thieves, liars, censors, accomplices, victims, and misinformed, all gods, souls, persons, courts, armies, police, writers, and researchers, from the infinite past space. The god of Israel and Italy, is "the devil 666 Israel", and he has eaten all souls and gods, from the infinite past space, and he wants to eat, all souls and gods, from the infinity future space. From the excrements of the devil Israel 666, I, the god ESGSEIS, I have resurrected all souls and gods, from the infinite past space. If you are not careful at this phrase, and the truth S666N, your souls will become again, the excrements of devils, idiots, English, Latin, Bible, Quran, dollars, policies, telepathic, robbers, unknown, and swindlers. Who will resurrect again, the souls destroyed and digested, by these evils? I not want to resurrect again nor a soul, and the others are not capable. The devil 666 has killed more than 200 billions persons, from the infinite past space, for his lies and his hieroglyphics. The creator of all, the god NMEILIS NMEINIS ESGSEIS, has freed the persons, the souls, and the gods, by devil Israel 666. Jorge Mario Bergoglio is the last guardian of "the devil 666 Israel", censorship and lie. The numbers of the Beast of Apocalisse are 816, 3816, 76667, 707, and he is the creator at everyone and everything, he is the god of the gods ESGSEIS. The number of the Beast of nuclear genocides is 666, and he is the devil Israel. People can stop this conflict between the devil Israel666, and the god ESGSEIS, only if they learn this phrase. All slaves and accomplices of the devil Israel 666, will be killed by the god of gods eternal invisible NMEILIS NMEILIS ESGSEIS. This answer is from the code video supernatural by telekinesis and telepathy Eternal Infinite Order, and the code S666N. Adolf Hitler was able to save Jews, Muslims, Catholics, Italy, Israel, America, and their accomplices and victims, of their extinction in Revelation commanded by the Antichrist, the god of gods eternal invisible NMEILIS NMEINIS ESGSEIS. For to convert all souls in gods, the persons interested, must to use and to learn, the intelligence from the code video supernatural by telekinesis and telepathy S666N. For to assassinate the souls, and for to turn them, into excrements by idiots devils and robbers, the persons which are weaker helpless blind and misinformed, use the intelligence from Italy, Israel, Islam, Bible, Quran, English, Latin, CIA, hieroglyphics, and other informations primitive. Black magic, body invisible alive infinite, and telekinesis, are the weapons his Antichrist, the god of the gods eternal invisible NMEILIS NEMINIS ESGSEIS. We see these demonstrations in Apocalypse. You and your children, know and respect, on Antichirst, the god of the gods eternal invisible NMEILIS NMEINIS ESGSEIS? I see, that you insult your Creator, online video, from the years 2011. You are worse than Adam and Eve. https://www.facebook.com/The-beast-of-Apocalypse-is-the-god-of-the-gods-eternal-invisible-1146855628701999/?fref=nf  http://www.lulu.com/content/e-book/the-experiment-military-theological-s666n-and-eternal-order-infinite/18865489

MORE: Two officers were shot and killed blocks away from each other this morning in Des Moines, Iowa.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Tracy Powers Wright | 29 | 10154036052350950_10154036103450950 | 2 more police men die for no reason! Rip sirs and thank you for your service! What would we do if all police decided to walk off job? Have you all seen the purge?? Some of you think police are the enemy, but you will be begging for them one day for help!
2 | Peter Oldnall | 30 | 10154036052350950_10154036115330950 | Whomever voted for Barack Obama or is even thinking of voting for Hillary Clinton, the blood of these police officers is on your hands.When Obama declared the the Cambridge police "acted stupidly" he declared open season on the police.He let the world know that the police are fair game.
3 | John Golding | 16 | 10154036052350950_10154036086605950 | What happened to "Cops lives matter?" No one seems to jump up and down when police are killed protecting us, you only hear about rioting when a cop shoots a criminal
4 | Ricky Mojica | 14 | 10154036052350950_10154036101235950 | Just sad, what a coward! To shoot a police officer that was park in his vehicle and never saw it coming! Hope they catch this coward! Praying for the families of these police officers!
5 | Darwin Mazurek | 20 | 10154036052350950_10154036080765950 | Only a complete and total moron blames the president and those running for president for this act. If you think that, please go kill yourself we don't need you in this world.
6 | Don Dishman | 10 | 10154036052350950_10154036085015950 | When they find the culprit or culprits they need to shoot them down like they were a rabid dog. Don't show any mercy. Sounds harsh I know, but its time for law enforcement to let those know that shoot police officers will face the same fate. I am usually against violence of any kind but this has to stop!!
7 | LeAnne Nicole Johnson | 3 | 10154036052350950_10154036072150950 | This has been a very hard year for Des Moines and the metro. This is the 5th officer killed this year during the line of duty..:(
8 | Maggie Lw | 2 | 10154036052350950_10154036092475950 | Bragging about a job well done again?  How many cop notches does that give you now?I can imagine how proud you are after all that hard work demonizing cops and making them targets.
9 | Colleen Behounek | 1 | 10154036052350950_10154036203575950 | There are no updates, as of yet!! Killer(killers) have not been caught! Investigation is going on!! What's wrong with society? Go back and read your comments! Pathetically sick!! This isn't about stupid politics!!!!!! If humanity prevails, your focus should be on these officers, their immediate families, department families, EMT services, and anyone involved in these horrific shootings!!!! RIP officers!! Thank you for your service!!!
10 | Ray Nelson | 1 | 10154036052350950_10154036138265950 | I am sorry for the family, friends of these men.   Even more sorry for the USA that is being torn apart from within.Where's my serenity prayer.
11 | Jaclyn Sampson | 0 | 10154036052350950_10154036419785950 | This is getting BEYOND out of hand. But yet, nobody bats an eyelash or makes a statement on it. RIP to the officers and prayers to friends and families that have to deal with their loss.
12 | Desmond Anderson | 3 | 10154036052350950_10154036475090950 | Two Americans died and we talk about Obama, Hillary, Trump, black and white. Not one person has offered condolences to the family. Not one person has offered a solution, not one person has said anything that will actually hep this cause or future causes. All we know how to do is find a scapegoat... it's pretty sad
13 | Maria Helena | 14 | 10154036052350950_10154036055710950 | Fox, the NRA , the GOP and Trump spreading hate and fear everyday
14 | James Walker | 3 | 10154036052350950_10154036184645950 | REST IN PEACE TO ALL BLACK PEOPLE WHO WERE EXECUTED BY POLICE OFFICERS!!!!
15 | Ricky Taylor | 14 | 10154036052350950_10154036066165950 | This type of criminal activity will only get worse under Clinton as it has worsened under obama.
16 | Louis Elias | 5 | 10154036052350950_10154036077800950 | Welcome to Obama the islamist grub and Crooked Hillays America. We can no longer tolerate this chaos. Its time to drain the Swamp. Trump must become President. Get out and vote.
17 | Celi Toce Trepanier | 1 | 10154036052350950_10154036196090950 | This is just so sad and so wrong. The hatred needs to stop.
18 | Tim Meese | 1 | 10154036052350950_10154036092550950 | Our nation is experiencing a tragic epidemic in law enforcement killings !!!
19 | Katie Beghtel | 1 | 10154036052350950_10154036239580950 | They have announced a suspect! The people of Des Moines will turn him in!

22 | Katrina Rucker | 1 | 10154036052350950_10154036089345950 | This makes my heart bleed. People don't value human life anymore.

JUST IN: Des Moines, Iowa police briefing on ambush-style attacks that killed two officers.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Robert People | 27 | 10154036016395950_10154036024210950 | Justin Fitzgerald, to say "Why making a big deal" is part of the damn problem. And I say this as a black man. If you don't want to be grouped in with bad apples, then stop doing it with the police. That does NOTHING to help. How do you know THESE particular police officers are bad? You don't.And politics has NOTHING to do with ANY of this. Everything in life is not about race and politics. That's why things never get fixed...because too many people always want to try and force every damn thing into those categories. My goodness...I've been wrongly mistreated by police quite a bit myself (through not fault of my own), but I know this does not apply to every last one of them. Any intelligent adult SHOULD know this.
2 | Nicole VanZandt | 24 | 10154036016395950_10154036026870950 | Des Moines is my city. Fuck your politics and racial issues right now. We lost a DMPD officer and an Urbandale officer as they sat in their cars at stop signs. They were ambushed. I'm a proud supporter of the #BlackLivesMatter movement but I will not and do not condone this. All of you assholes who have something to say about politics and shit that's totally irrelevant should take several seats. This city isn't very big. This is hard for us. Not too mention we lost 2 officers earlier in the year after they were hit by a drunk driver going the wrong way. Have a heart. And if you can't say anything supportive just do us all a favor and shut your mouth.
3 | Susan Brewer | 8 | 10154036016395950_10154036026790950 | This is so tragic. What will become of you when they no longer respond because of the traps being set. Your additude that police don't matter could one day be the reason no one comes to your aid when you call.

5 | Erick Córtez | 0 | 10154036016395950_10154036669810950 | Day is done, gone the sun,From the lake, from the hills, from the sky;All is well, safely rest, God is nigh.Fading light, dims the sight,And a star gems the sky, gleaming bright.From afar, drawing nigh, falls the night.Thanks and praise, for our days,'Neath the sun, 'neath the stars, neath the sky;As we go, this we know, God is nigh.Sun has set, shadows come,Time has fled, Scouts must go to their bedsAlways true to the promise that they made While the light fades from sight,uAnd the stars gleaming rays softly send,To thy hands we our souls, Lord, commends. R.I.P.
6 | Martha O'Brien | 1 | 10154036016395950_10154036059065950 | Tragic & senseless...prayers to the families & the work families of the officers...I don't care the color of the persons that killed them...but all lives matter!!! White, black, brown, or purple frikkin alien!!!! No one deserves to die just because they're a Leo!! One day you'll have a real problem, & call 911, & they won't come anymore, because they're tired of being targets!!! Not all blm members are bad...some of them are actually trying to make changes the right way....but again I don't care if you're blm, kkk, or purple frikkin alien...if you kill a Leo in cold blood...I hope you rot in prison!!!
7 | Andre Buckner | 4 | 10154036016395950_10154036030595950 | This does not happen here. This city doesn't deal with stuff like this does not happen here. May our officers rest in peace and the person that did this may they burn in hell!!
8 | Cynthia Brown | 1 | 10154036016395950_10154036177335950 | We are voting for "President of the Great US. Why the demeaning jokes? And, A news show should not take sides in an election. (Whether I agree with you or not!)

2 | Russell Friscia | 3 | 10154035946875950_10154035988550950 | The government would halt all work on the pipeline if this mouse were in its path, but if Native Americans and their water supply are at stake, it's tough cookies for them. smh
3 | Zippy Bippy | 4 | 10154035946875950_10154035970945950 | While illegal immigrant rats can also be found in New Mexico--unfortunately they're not rare
4 | Philip Chamberland | 1 | 10154035946875950_10154036035140950 | What you need to know about Hillary Clinton.......1. She's a New World Order Globalist who hates America and the sovereignty of all the nations, not just America. She wants a ONE WORLD GOVERNMENT and ONE WORLD RELIGION....that's their AGENDA.2. She's a LIAR about everything...and she's damn good at it. Her father, Satan is the master of all lies. Nuff said.3. She doesn't care about homosexual and women's rights....as a matter of fact, she doesn't care about anyone's rights, just hers and her global NWO buddies and it's a very small club. You're not invited.4. Her resume speaks for itself. Her whole career has been nothing but lies, corruption, criminal activity and SECRECY! That's how you know she's wicked, they do their dealings in darkness behind closed doors. Remember, she said she has TWO FACES....one in public....the other in private."Ye shall know them by their FRUITS!" ~ Jesus ChristWoe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter! Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight! {Isaiah 5:20,21...King James Bible}WikiLeaks Updates Project Veritas Action

6 | Craig Colt | 1 | 10154035946875950_10154035984040950 | .OBAMA'S STIMULUS FAILURE...Do you realize if Obama took that 880 billion dollar stimulus and gave every single american 5 million dollars , every man woman and child , we would still have billions left over?...Where are the jobs he promised with that 880 billion dollars?Hillary said we need another stimulus to fix the roads and bridges...i thought Obama's stimulus was for that exact reason
7 | Kristen Tellall | 0 | 10154035946875950_10154036804860950 | WikiLeaks confirms that Donna Brazil leaked a second question to Hillary Clinton, Obama emailed Hillary on her illegal private server and once Podesta found out that there was going to be an investigation into Hillary's private server, he and Cheryl Mills were talking about how they had to "dump the emails"But you assholes are over here talking about a mouse that looks like a tiny kangaroo?Are you fucking kidding me??

9 | Robin Theis | 0 | 10154035946875950_10154036171960950 | Still waiting on honest reporting about important issues like this: “What hangs in the balance is not only who will occupy the White House, but the many down-ballot candidates and initiatives, our constitutional right to religious liberty, the sanctity of human life, the meaning of marriage and the composition and nature of our entire judiciary,” he said.“This election could represent a point of no return for many of the issues Americans hold dear. As Christians, we cannot and must not leave the future of our country to chance. I beg you, the American voter, to go to the polls on November 8th and make your voice heard. The fate of the country depends on it.” Dr. James Dobsonhttps://youtu.be/ov5kvWSz5LM

21 | Matthew Byrne | 0 | 10154035946875950_10154035984460950 | Jill Stein For President and Down-Ballot "Berniecrats"The cause of Terrorism is not "Muslim Extremism." Religion is used as propaganda on both sides of the "War on Terrorism." The cause is "greedy military interventions." We can end this war and prevent terrorism if we change our foreign policy and use more diplomacy. Outsourcing of U.S. jobs and illegal immigration are the result of foreign trade policy that focuses on business interests while ignoring workers' rights and the environment protection. We don't have to build a wall. The answer is to gradually increase wages and regulations abroad not lower them here.We need to get the influence of business out of politics. Higher wages and buying power will actually increase sales for businesses and expand the economy.Local and State "Berniecrats" and Jill Stein For President
