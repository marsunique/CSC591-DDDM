‚ÄúThey made a huge mistake by nominating someone they know is a serial liar, has a history of having a casual relationship with the truth, of always putting Hillary first.‚Äù

1 | Deborah Brien | 262 | 1337804146315834_1337805966315652 | This woman has no integrity at all if she actually believes the foolishness she spews.
2 | Valerie Weisenfeld | 143 | 1337804146315834_1337805919648990 | She apparently lives in the upside down. She must feel such incredible amounts of shame when she's alone.
3 | Sandy Cox | 118 | 1337804146315834_1337805389649043 | i really wish someone would hack Donald Trumps e-mails also.
4 | Jen Travieso | 101 | 1337804146315834_1337805672982348 | Trump is the biggest mistake the Republicans have made and they will pay for it for years to come.
5 | Carolyn Peterson | 32 | 1337804146315834_1337810002981915 | The DOJ needs to open an investigation into James Comey's involvement in a possible conspiracy with Jason Chaffetz to throw the election. This needs to be done before all the republicans involved have time to destroy the evidence and cover their tracks.
6 | William Toro | 47 | 1337804146315834_1337806546315594 | What I am about to tell you are facts:Only Donald Trump admitted to sexually assaulting women. Only Donald Trump didn't know the military didn't have a court system to deal with rapes in the military. Only Donald Trump talks about knowing more about ISIS than the generals yet he had his daddy buy him 5 deferments from the military to avoid military service. Only Donald Trump has gone bankrupt six times. Only Donald Trump has openly used donations to veterans collected then deposited to his personal and illegal foundation and use that money to pay for lawsuit settlements, but a self portrait, a signed football helmet and "donate" to the Florida attorney general so she wouldn't open and investigation in to the plethora of fraud complaints against his so called trump university. Only Donald Trump has over 200 lawsuits for fraud and racketeering pending in court. Only Donald Trump would have a pro Russian lobbyist as his campaign manager. Only Donald Trump would illegally do business with Iran, Russia and Cuba when it was illegal to do so. Only Donald Trump has zero political experience. Only Donald Trump is despised by the leaders of his own party which will severely limit what he can accomplish if he wins. Only Donald Trump has alienated world leaders. Only Donald Trump wants the proliferation of Nuclear weapons. Only Donald Trump made racist comments about Mexicans, Jews and Muslims. Only Donald Trump publicly made fun of a person with a handicap. Only Donald Trump called for women to be punished if they had an abortion. Only Donald Trump told his supporters to hurt people protesting at his rallies leading to people getting sucker punched as they left. Only Donald Trump has not released his tax returns. Only Donald Trump admitted to not paying federal income taxes. Only Donald Trump has called women fat, pigs and disgusting etc. Only Donald Trump blames the media for publicizing things that come out of his own mouth. Only Donald Trump has said he will support a peaceful transition of power but only if he wins. Only Donald Trump talks about keeping jobs in the US then sends his own company's jobs overseas. Only Donald Trump talks about the importance of improving the state of our economy and then used steel from china and room furniture and accessories from foreign countries to build and furnish his hotels.Should I go on? I still have the pending FBI investigation in to Trumps business dealing and campaign solicitation schemes! üò±

8 | George Dreger | 5 | 1337804146315834_1337805042982411 | This seems an appropriate time to post this for the convenience of many celebrities and other liberals: True patriot-love in all thy sons command.With glowing hearts we see thee rise,The True North strong and free!And stand on guard, O Canada,We stand on guard for thee.[Chorus:]O Canada, glorious and free!O Canada, we stand on guard, we stand on guard for thee.O Canada, we stand on guard for thee.O Canada! where pines and maples grow,Great prairies spread, and lordly rivers flow.How dear to us thy broad domain,From East to Western sea.The land of hope for all who toil,The True North strong and free![Chorus:]O Canada, glorious and free!O Canada, we stand on guard, we stand on guard for thee.O Canada, we stand on guard for thee.O Canada! beneath our shining skies,May stalwart sons, and gentle maidens rise.To keep thee steadfast through the years,From east to western sea,Our own beloved native land,Our true north strong and free![Chorus:]O Canada, glorious and free!O Canada, we stand on guard, we stand on guard for thee.O Canada, we stand on guard for thee.Ruler Supreme! who hearest humble prayer,Hold thy Dominion in thy loving care;Help us to find, Oh God, in thee,A lasting rich reward.As waiting for the Better Day,We ever stand on guard.O Canada, Glorious and free!

9 | Francine Lachance | 0 | 1337804146315834_1337813809648201 | That is truly funny coming from Kellyanne about her candidate, the pathological liar Donald Trump. Ironically, they are always making statements about Democrats that are really true about Republicans. Campaign strategy: best defense is a good offense.
10 | Becky Lee Wetzel | 5 | 1337804146315834_1337810902981825 | People are finally seeing what a liar, fake and an evil Narcissist Trump really is .. a scoundrel and a man too dangerous to be our President... everything is coming out on Trump from sex scandals to espionage with Russia talk about traitor to our country for PRESIDENT .. I DON'T THINK SO! Scary really really scary!!!!!!!
11 | Gavin Michael Dillon | 9 | 1337804146315834_1337810746315174 | Republicans made a huge mistake with Donald J. Trump. Prayerfully we will reject him come Election Day! Remember it isn't our candidate who brags about sexual assault. #StrongerTogether
12 | Sylvia Queen | 0 | 1337804146315834_1337813892981526 | That hooker gets paid to make insane accusations. The funny part is that in her comments, she gave an amazingly accurate description of Trump.
13 | Favour Johnson Destiny | 2 | 1337804146315834_1337810122981903 | Oh really , a liar is better than sexual assaults and racist . Remember he refused to show his tax returns also invading tax for over 2 decades .
14 | Luis Mitchel Gomez Macias | 0 | 1337804146315834_1337813492981566 | Oh you wanna start talking about truthfulness? How about we ask your Boss where are his millions he made by going bankrupt? How about the time he literally got away with groping women? What about his endeavors that are now in the judiciary process (The University, just one example)? His records about the wIraqi war and how HE DID suppport it? Or what about the times he used his Foundation to get away with money to cover his expenses? Or the times he has to resettle the cases of frontal racism to people of color?And you want to talk about someone who is "a serial liar"... because you don't like when people asks your boss about HIS OWN LIES? Gimme a break...

Bush administration. Between 2003 and 2009, the Bush White House ‚Äúlost‚Äù 22 million emails. This correspondence included millions of emails written during the darkest period in America‚Äôs recent history, when the Bush administration was ginning up support for what turned out to be a disastrous war in Iraq with false claims that the country possessed weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and, later, when it was firing U.S. attorneys for political reasons."

17 | Kenneth Brown | 0 | 1337804146315834_1337814712981444 | Donald Trump, the draft-dodging Russophile who cloaks his xenophobia and bigotry in a veneer of false patriotism, reportedly had to ask what a Gold Star family was after he attacked the Muslim-American parents of war hero Capt. Humayun Khan. Trump has thus once again proven his patriotic rhetoric to be nothing but ignorant and self-serving bombast.The Trump-Khan feud arose after Khizr Khan, Capt. Khan‚Äôs father, gave a powerful speech at the Democratic National Convention over the summer repudiating Trump‚Äôs hateful anti-Muslim rhetoric. Khan said that Trump had ‚Äúsacrificed nothing‚Äù while he and his wife had paid the ultimate sacrifice for America, and famously held up his pocket-size Constitution and offered to lend it to Trump. Trump, who seems physically incapable of responding to criticism with anything other than blustering attacks, went on a tirade against Mr. Khan, adding for good measure that his wife Ghazala was not allowed to speak at the DNC because she is a Muslim.When one of Trump‚Äôs advisers warned him against attacking a Gold Star family, Trump reportedly responded, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs that?‚Äù Paul Manafort, Trump‚Äôs campaign manager at the time, apparently had to repeatedly explain to the candidate that a Gold Star family is a family that has lost a loved one serving in war. In a surprising bit of pushback from a Trump campaign staff that seems to consist overwhelmingly of yes men, Manafort reportedly told Trump in response to his feud with Khan that the election ‚Äúis about the American people, it‚Äôs not about you.‚ÄùThat Trump has the audacity to criticize war heros like Capt. Khan and Sen. John McCain after using his privilege to avoid war and knowing nothing of their sacrifice, that he is so presumptuous as to adopt the mantle of fighting for America while knowing nothing about American institutions, is proof that he is nothing but an opportunistic demagogue who will say anything to appease his own ego. In stark contrast to Trump‚Äôs sleaze, however, Khizr Khan has, in the best American tradition, taken the high road.Khan has continued to speak out for American values and against Trump‚Äôs hate-peddling. Last week he said that ‚Äúthere comes a time in an ordinary citizen‚Äôs life where you have to gather all the courage you have and you stand up and speak against tyranny and speak against un-American hate.‚Äù Khan has continued to get under Trump‚Äôs skin, with the nominee replying to that speech with the hackneyed lie that he opposed the Iraq war. Perhaps the reason Trump has been so irritated by Mr. Khan is that he has demonstrated so much better than Mr. Trump himself what it means to be a true American.

She is a hypocrite knowing the lies he spews everytime he opens his big mouth. She is just one of the many Stooges he has and they all need immediate Mental Evaluations. Hillary has her own issues and we have all known that for years......but this GOP group is a disgrace.
19 | Patti Kielty | 0 | 1337804146315834_1337809639648618 | Tomas Davis, what a dumb thin to post. Don't speak on my behalf of what I might or might not be aware of. You don't speak for what "democrats" are aware of, trying get to do so makes you sound like a manipulative tyrant. What I am aware of is that You must not have heard about 911, or the 13+ Benghazi like attacks, 60 people killed, during the Bush administration. Or else you are ignorant and deaf and blind. Oh, and lest we not forget the 22 million emails lost during the investigation of Bush and Cheney.
20 | Lyndon Mickens | 0 | 1337804146315834_1337814136314835 | Joe is a joke just like Trump...Trump goes to court on federal charges of fraud the day after the election for Trump University and in December he goes on trial for rape of a 13 year old...cases on court dockets.....name one case HRC has scheduled for court...I'll wait...
21 | Kathy Hudspeth | 1 | 1337804146315834_1337811796315069 | See this is what voting for trump will get us, more lies,more cheating and loss of more freedoms, especially health wise and women's rights. How you can make that kind of decision to vote for him and the reps is just appalling..
22 | Patricia Haidvogel | 1 | 1337804146315834_1337812839648298 | Says the woman who constantly spouts off misinformation. Newsflash Kellyanne Conway... You represent a man who lies every three minutes and more than half of the fact checks on his claims show him to be lying.
23 | Godswill Essien | 0 | 1337804146315834_1337812852981630 | THE DANGERS OF PERVASIVE IGNORANCE: During an interview in 2012, retired U.S justice, David Souter had this to say and I am going to paraphrase him. He said, "one thing that keeps me up at night is not an economic meltdown, depression or terrorist attack. Rather what bothers me is that due to the failures of previous administrations, some politician will come forth and say to the American people, give me absolute power and I will solve all your problems. He went further to say, 'that's how the Roman Empire collapsed', adding that Augustus did not seize power from the Roman senate but rather got all the absolute power he needed with their consent and that of the people. The Romans granted him power to do what needed to be done and before they knew it Augustus became an authoritarian leader. In Justice Souter's opinion, that's how democracy dies. Here again, lies the emergence and appeal of people like Trump in the United States. He says to his admiring supporters, make me your president and I will make America great again.
24 | Ena Riden | 0 | 1337804146315834_1337813512981564 | This woman has no value of a human being. I really want to see Wikileaks's hack her and his emails, maybe there are bunches of stinky things like their mouths and scurvy manners. Like chump like her.
25 | Maggie Wood | 0 | 1337804146315834_1337814669648115 | It's odd, but as the campaign goes on, Hillary keeps looking younger and more spritely.. ..while Trump and Kellyanne look older and more tired.  Puffy eyes and droopy face.  Too much fast food?   Or the stress of hating and lying from sunrise to midnight?

1 | Kirstien Demuth | 182 | 1337751689654413_1337752199654362 | God bless Hillary! The conservative media and corrupt republicans will stop at nothing to try and destroy this woman! They know full well how corrupt, vile, and dishonest Trump is. I pray to God that he will keep Hillary strong and people will not buy into all the lies being spread by conservative controlled medias.
2 | Nana Lee | 111 | 1337751689654413_1337752659654316 | The Hatch Act prohibits FBI officials from using their official authority to influence an election. Reid said that by releasing this information, which he says is not conclusive or pertinent, Comey may have broken the law. Reid referenced a memo from Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates from March of this year that establishes all Justice Department employees, including Comey, are subject to the Hatch Act.
3 | Daniel Resto | 57 | 1337751689654413_1337759712986944 | What bothers me the most is the fact that Comey issues a letter that lacks any serious factual information, and three days later hasn't come forward to provide much-needed information.
4 | Alec Drake | 63 | 1337751689654413_1337757372987178 | Most people like myself have made up our minds about the emails a long time ago. I was planning on voting for Hillary before and am now more determined then ever to vote for her now. The stakes are too high and I trust Hillary Clinton with the future of this country more then I do Trump. If Trump supporters can overlook all the scandals and issues about him, then I can do the same about Hillary. I also still think she is going to win. If Hillary wins North Carolina, Trump can't win.
5 | Raymond Towler | 29 | 1337751689654413_1337757526320496 | 538 has Hillary at 78% to win the election in first polls taken after the Comey letter. People that are voting for Hillary are still voting Hillary. Trump people are still voting Trump. Polls not showing movement in either direction
6 | Gutierrez Ralph | 13 | 1337751689654413_1337755106320738 | Of course it will. I switched parties because in my opinion Trump is worse than Hillary in every way. Unfortunately the media has always focused on e-mails that don't matter and because of this Trump will be president and will reverse allot of Obama's executive actions. Nothing will get done in congress and our standing in the world will shrink to a rising Russia.
7 | Kimberly Cooper Brown | 9 | 1337751689654413_1337756546320594 | I know all media would love it if the race becomes closer cause you know their ratings depend on it so from now on I don't believe much of what they say without fact checking everything they say I'm so disappointed in MSNBC I used to trust them but after this election there are only a couple of them I still sort of trust. Sad that they have turned into a reality show instead of a trusted news organization
8 | Ig Cherem | 19 | 1337751689654413_1337752339654348 | Only Hillary Clinton was caught lying to congress.Only Hillary Clinton was fired from a job for being unethical.Only Hillary Clinton deleted 30 some thousand emails after she was ordered to hand them over to the Fed.Only Hillary Clinton had that same computer wiped clean by professionals.Only Hillary Clinton got the rapist of a teenage girl off on rape charges then laughed about it.Only Hillary Clinton lied to the American people about Benghazi .Only Hillary Clinton lied to the American people about her emails.Only Hillary Clinton lied about being under sniper fire.Only Hillary Clinton lied about lying to the American people.Only Hillary Clinton was involved in " Cash Cow "Only Hillary Clinton has a long list of scandals.Only Hillary Clinton nationally belittled her husband's sexual harassment ( and rape ) accusers.Only Hillary Clinton is a career politician.Only Hillary Clinton will not release her speeches to Goldman Sachs and other banks.Only Hillary Clinton is tied to Monsanto.Only Hillary Clinton was labeled " Extremely careless " about national security by the FBI !Only Hillary Clinton said she will raise taxes on the middle class.Only Hillary Clinton benefited from the DNC rigging an election !Only Hillary Clinton had to return stolen items from the White House.Only Hillary Clinton said the Benghazi victims parents where lying.Only Hillary Clinton wants you to vote for her based on her gender.Only Hillary Clinton has no real accomplishments after a lifetime in politics.Only Hillary Clinton has never created any jobs.Only Hillary Clinton has been investigated by the FBI and found to have put national security at risk.Only Hillary Clinton has had two or more movies and several documentaries made about her questionable ethics.Only Hillary Clinton was called "Broomstick one" by the SS.Only Hillary Clinton made congress and others spend millions and millions of tax dollars having hearings and investigating her to find that she lied, that would not have been spent if she would of simply told the truth in the first place ! Fact - all facts !Only Hillary Clinton regularly cussed out and belittled her SS detail.Only Hillary Clinton Only Hillary Clinton Only Hillary Clinton over and over again.
9 | Tony Blackie Clouds | 7 | 1337751689654413_1337762192986696 | The liberal comments here are so blatantly ignorant. Always blaming everything and everybody for the DNC and Hillary's failures. Hillary did this to herself. Don't blame poor timing on political agenda. The FBI do not accomodate felons. What a bunch of morons and losers....
10 | Paul Phillip Tomlin III | 4 | 1337751689654413_1337759449653637 | No, not really. This is just a setback and she'll still be fighting, Hillary is a proven fighter and knows how to deal with these kinds of accusations.That's because she's been doing a lot of this kind of coverup recently. What is coming this week from Wikileaks, Project Vertitas, and all the centipedes out there will shake her campaign to its core.
11 | Lana Mary | 4 | 1337751689654413_1337764359653146 | Will this impact my decision to vote for Hillary. Hell NO ! And it's funny to hear republicans say that she is the corruption in Washington when THEY obstruct almost everything that happens IN Washington !!!
12 | Sally Lenz Forness | 4 | 1337751689654413_1337767846319464 | I might care in another election, but Trump is the alternative. Don't give a rat's a@& about emails that may or may not have anything new. Worst case she has to step down and we get Kaine as President. I'll take that any day over Trump/Pence and their hate filled, misogynistic, agenda!
13 | Pat Pusey | 1 | 1337751689654413_1337773106318938 | Not if the biased media have anything to do with it. She is corrupt to the core. I do not care if Donald Trump called a woman fat. I do not care if he tried to sleep with a woman or if he likes "beautiful" women. I care that he sent a plane to pick up 200 Marines who were stranded after desert storm. I care that he supports our police officers and first responders. I care that he supports guns and standing behind our military. I care that he supports the death penalty and is AGAINST abortion. I care that he supports enforcing immigration laws. I care that he wants to destroy radical Islamic groups. I care that he supports COAL. These are things I care about. Him talking sexually about women does not bother me. Were they mean words? Yes. Were they words spoken in PRIVATE? Yes. Have you ever talked to your friends about the opposite sex in private and said things? I'm positive all of you have. But, News Flash!! Women have been sexualized for centuries!! Jay-Z, Lil' Jon, Lil' Wayne and every single other rapper helped establish that platform, but people are ok with music blasted all over the radio degrading women. Ever heard of Victoria Secret? Or their fashion show? Ever heard of Hooters? People are ok with that too. Until all of these things are different, women will be viewed this way. Your precious Obama couldn't change that and Hillary can't either. I feel sorry for the women Donald has belittled and said terrible things about. But I'm still much more offended by what Hillary Clinton has DONE over what Donald Trump has SAID... PERIOD!!!! So Trump doesn't do well at the debates, maybe he even sounds childish and incapable. But he is speaking the truth! Just because he's not a polished politician like Hilary or Obama doesn't mean he's unqualified to be president. He cares for this country, not growing the size of his pockets. That man has so much money he could never spend it all. He gets NOTHING out of being president! I'm standing for the man accused of saying mean words. I'll never back a woman under four different scandal investigations, possible murder at Benghazi, and the secretive email scandal Clinton's Foundation which has been nothing but lies from the beginning. Trump 2016!!!
14 | Tracy Hornschuch | 1 | 1337751689654413_1337803036315945 | I like what my mother said. Hillary deserves a medal after winning next week for withstanding as much as she has since she has announced. There may be a small impact, but I strongly believe this will not cause her to lose. We will win if we get out and vote democratic!
15 | Toni Lenzo Ziemniak | 0 | 1337751689654413_1337772239652358 | funny how all of you constitutional scholars come lately know so much about the hatch act, but forget this one.  United States Code", here's what it says:"(a) Whoever willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys, or attempts to do so, or, with intent to do so takes and carries away any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.(b) Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States. As used in this subsection, the term "office" does not include the office held by any person as a retired officer of the Armed Forces of the United States."Yes, it explicitly states "shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States.‚Äù;This is the link to the law: react-text: 295 https://www.law.cornell. /react-text edu/uscode/text/18/2071 Shouldn't voters know that?
16 | Connie Greene | 1 | 1337751689654413_1337791349650447 | I have not watched any news since this news broke. I follow the percentage polls. Silver and Princeton University polls. They are factual and less excitable. My political group provides support and encouragement. Enough of the emails and biased media already. VOTE
17 | Rhonda Sheptock | 0 | 1337751689654413_1337804542982461 | Meanwhile Trump is actually going to court for Child Rape and his Fraudulent University that stole millions from hard working Americans, shipping his work off the other countries while touting he wants to make America great, sexually assaulting women for decades, building his businesses with a Chinese steel, hiring US Contractors to architect and build his hotels and then not paying them, bankrupting his businesses and putting people out of work and not providing healthcare benefits for the ones he does have working. And this is all on top of him being a racist, misogynist, hate breeding, war monger who disrespects our veterans and war heroes and makes fun of disabled people! And we can also add that he not only lost 500million on a single year beating the great business man that he is, but found a loophole to then not pay any personal federal income tax for the last 20 years. So he isn't contributing to our schools, fire/police departments, servicemen, veterans, or any other departments that he states he cares so much about!
18 | Gretchen Cowen | 0 | 1337751689654413_1337798246316424 | Not if you quick spending every waking moment acting like it should when you know it shouldn't! I've been a long time fan, but I'm really sick of you guys and your double standard this year. You've spent at least as much time talking about Hillary's stupid emails as you have all of Trump's scandals put together. You usually give his about one news cycle and they're gone. And you don't talk about the child rape case at all. Seems unfair, yes, but not in the way he's claiming. You guys are doing his job for him!
19 | Carolyn Peterson | 0 | 1337751689654413_1337810119648570 | The DOJ needs to open an investigation into James Comey's involvement in a possible conspiracy with Jason Chaffetz to throw the election. This needs to be done before all the republicans involved have time to destroy the evidence and cover their tracks.

The GOP congress has been investigating her for decades and none of their committees have ever come up with a convictable offense or they would have done it already - and now that she is running for office they use their record of BS investigations as proof that she's crooked while leaving out the fact that they've never found enough evidence to prove guilt of any kind. They're just a bunch of dogs chasing a tail they cut off years ago.

The emails never did since we never heard a peep from Congress when 22 MILLION went missing from the Bush/Cheney admin.  Besides, I will stand up some  "tax-payer money wasting, almost, don't quite know, haven't seen it yet" email  faux-scandal against all the REAL ignorant, dangerous, treasonous, racist, mysogynist crap Trump has been selling for the past year and half. Not to mention he's set to stand trial for Trump University fraud on Nov 28 and rape of a 13 year old child (!!!!!) on Dec. 13. But y'all still worried about email. SMH

24 | Robb Allen | 1 | 1337751689654413_1337786542984261 | Ok, for anyone who doesn't get what's going on with the emails.  Weiner is in trouble for naked pictures sent to a 15 year old, at some point he steals a boatload of emails from his wife huma abedin. Now he needs leverage to get out of trouble, so he tells the fbi that he has emails from Hillary saying something really juicy. So if the fbi gets what he promised, he will get some sort of deal for his sexting charges. It has to be something really good for the FBI to go for the deal.
25 | John Moore | 3 | 1337751689654413_1337761729653409 | Go Hillary! The only qualified candidate! Remember Trump is facing 2 Federal Judges for FRAUD and Child Rape in Nov. and Dec. those are criminal charges!

6 | Tebkap Pak | 32 | 1337688816327367_1337690036327245 | Hillary Clinton‚Äôs $500,000 Bribe to the FBI Came Through Virginia ‚Äì CONFIRMED!The question we are all thinking of so much time now, is how on earth does Hillary gets away without charges with more than 50 FBI agents assigned to investigate her illegal use of a private email server?It is the wizardry or corruption!But now it has emerged that Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe, a known Clinton insider and former Hillary Clinton campaign chairman, deposed at least $675,000 to the election of the wife of an FBI official doing the Clinton investigation. More so, his political action committee gave $467,500 to the state senate campaign for FBI agent Andrew McCabe‚Äôs wife. Just to be clear he has the reputation of a deputy director.Via   ThePoliticalInsiderMore money came to her through the Democratic Party of Virginia:Jill McCabe received an additional $207,788 from the Virginia Democratic Party, the report states, which is heavily influenced by McAuliffe.The money directed by McAuliffe began flowing two months after the FBI investigation into Clinton began in July 2015. Around that time, the candidate‚Äôs husband was promoted from running the Washington field office for the FBI to the No. 3 position at the FBI.Within a year, McCabe was promoted to deputy director, the second-highest position in the bureau.[‚Ä¶]The governor‚Äôs office claimed the FBI‚Äôs McCabe met the governor only once ‚Äî on March 7, 2015, when McAuliffe persuaded Jill McCabe to run.The 2015 Virginia state Senate run ‚Äî her first run for public office ‚Äî was unsuccessful as she lost to the incumbent Republican.McAuliffe ‚Äúsupported Jill McCabe because he believed she would be a good state senator. This is a customary practice for Virginia governors‚Ä¶ Any insinuation that his support was tied to anything other than his desire to elect candidates who would help pass his agenda is ridiculous,‚Äù a spokesman for the Virginia governor told The Journal.McAuliffe, a long-time D.C. insider, claims that this was simply him supporting fellow Democrats. But McCabe was the third-largest recipient of funds from Common Good VA, the Governor‚Äôs PAC. With such few public meetings, the massive size of the contribution is more than a little suspicious.McCabe‚Äôs campaign announcement came in March 2015, roughly the same time it was reported that Hillary Clinton illegally used a home email server to transmit classified documents.This is pay-for-play politics at its worse. Hillary Clinton‚Äôs team knows how D.C. works, and the Governor of Virginia was willing to do anything to prevent his friend from facing criminal charges. Politics is a dirty business, and there‚Äôs no question that McAuliffe was trying to buy favors.

And this is all on top of him being a racist, misogynist, hate breeding, war monger who disrespects our veterans and war heroes and makes fun of disabled people! And we can also add that he not only lost 500million on a single year beating the great business man that he is, but found a loophole to then not pay any personal federal income tax for the last 20 years. So he isn't contributing to our schools, fire/police departments, servicemen, veterans, or any other departments that he states he cares so much about!

Going all in against the director of the FBI is precarious ‚Äî especially after Democrats praised his integrity after he initially cleared Hillary Clinton in July.

1 | J Thomas Gaffney | 70 | 1337636596332589_1337637716332477 | The Democrats and Clinton campaign sensed they were losing the presidential election to Trump so they've devised this scheme to contest the election if they lose, claiming interference too close to the election under provisions of the Hatch Act. And if this doesn‚Äôt work, they‚Äôll contest the election claiming Putin and Russia interfered with the U.S. election through Wikileaks. This is all assuming that their massive vote rigging scheme fails to elect Hillary in the first place.

5 | Brian Seligman | 12 | 1337636596332589_1337652139664368 | If she had turned over all of her emails, as she testified under oath she did, then it wouldn't be a problem. Don't shoot the messenger, blame Hillary for her Clinton Lies and the DNC for rigging the primary.
6 | Jack Harrington | 10 | 1337636596332589_1337662619663320 | Comey (FBI) is attempting to sabotage HRC's campaign w/ the latest email review. The investigation is not "reopened," the emails on her assistant's laptop are being reviewed and HRC has had nothing to do w/ that. Chaffetz, republican house member hoping to become Speaker of the House SOON, received a note from FBI Comey stating it was a simple review of HRC's assistant's emails. Chaffetz perjured the meaning of the FBI note by immediately going to the media and stating, "The FBI director was 'reopening' the investigation into Hilary Clinton's using personal email server." There is a huge difference between "reviewing" emails on someone else's laptop and "reopening" the investigation that has taken millions of dollars and years to complete. Chaffetz intended to upset the HRC campaign, the white house and all supporters of HRC and to tilt the election in trump's favor. This is treason. Our system really is beginning to crumble right in front of us.

8 | Michael Richmond | 2 | 1337636596332589_1337681919661390 | I believe that we are missing the basic issue. The server has been investigated, it was determined that it was not appropriate but was not criminal. The new issue is that there was a discovery of more emails that may be significant. That discovery could be important  if classified information was sent  What can also be significant if any corespondance would point to a cover up of the destrction of emails/ corespondance. I am a lifelong Democrat and I have no tolerance for any type of cover up or malfeasance. The FBI director was praised and quoted by Mrs. Clinton and other Democrats. He let Congress know, I may have been too quick in my previous testimony. Let us not forget that he was under oath before the Congressional hearing. Let us hope it is nothing but Democrats and Republicans cannot have it both ways.
9 | James Ray Amos | 0 | 1337636596332589_1337757922987123 | wishes Director Comey would release some updates on investigations involving Trump, including his Russian connections which might balance his mistaken dumping of innuendoes against Hillary Clinton. Its astonishing that all the issues placed under a republican microscope into Hillary for all these years have not only found nothing but have been proven to just be partisan witch-hunts. None of it makes Trump fit for office or changes the direction the republican policies would take our country. If you're not satisfied with the direction our country is taking, voting for more GOP obstruction doesn't solve that...PEACE!
10 | Richard Howell | 0 | 1337636596332589_1337659819663600 | The references to ‚ÄúMetadata‚Äù by the cable news outlets are aimed at confusing the computer illiterates, by making them believe that all information is stored and accessible in the ‚ÄúMetadata‚Äù, this is far from the truth. In fact, it is a downright lie and the cable news outlet should be held accountable for spreading propaganda to the public through a series of carefully orchestrated Republicans white men lies.To access ‚ÄúMetadata, which is stored in binary form, a separate ‚Äú.Net‚Äù program would have to be written specifically to the process and information required. This means that someone in the FBI‚Äôs IT Department wrote a ‚Äú.Net‚Äù program to access and interrogates ‚ÄúMetadata‚Äù. Program Specifications had to be developed, design documents had to be developed, and the program had to be coded and compiled into a ‚ÄúMetadata‚Äù file and tested. Who are the FBI Technicians that wrote the programs that accessed ‚ÄúMetadata‚Äù of the ‚Äú.Net‚Äù programs used in sending and receiving State Department emails?

15 | Clifford Phillips Jr | 3 | 1337636596332589_1337654162997499 | Copy from Facebook page of Kevin M Carney(opposing Views.) A gentleman named Bill Howell eloquently wrote the below letter.Dear Mr. Trump,It‚Äôs taken me a while to realize this and to admit it, but I‚Äôm grateful to you.For the past few months I‚Äôve spent a good deal of time lamenting your campaign and the poison it has so effortlessly generated. I‚Äôve watched our country imploding, our public discourse become polluted, our political climate grows ever more corrosive, and wrongly assumed you were to blame.It‚Äôs only lately I‚Äôve come to understand that you haven‚Äôt manufactured our current national ugliness‚Äîyou‚Äôve simply revealed it.By saying the irresponsible, mean-spirited, ignorant things you say so freely and so frequently, you‚Äôve given other like-minded people license to do the same. You‚Äôve opened up the floodgates for our corporate sewage to flow fully. People no longer conceal their vile mess, they now revel in it, they broadcast it and retweet it.You‚Äôve made bigotry and racism socially acceptable again and that has been a kind of twisted gift because it‚Äôs allowed me to really see people; not as they pretend to be on the surface‚Äîbut in the very depths of their wounded, weaponized hearts.Over and over as your campaign has persisted, your supporters would tell me that they like you because you ‚Äúspeak your mind‚Äù. It wasn‚Äôt until recently that I‚Äôve realized that you speak their minds. You‚Äôve given credence to their prejudices and made those prejudices go mainstream.Thanks to the terrible ground you‚Äôve broken, politicians, pastors, friends, and strangers, both in person and on social media now regularly out themselves as hateful, intolerant, and malicious‚Äîand they remind me just how close they are to me, just how deep the sickness in us runs, and just how far we have to go together.You‚Äôve emboldened people to be open about things they used to conceal for the sake of decorum, and though it turns my stomach, I know that this is the only way we can move forward; to have that cancerous stuff exposed fully so that it can be dealt with. Our progress as a nation is predicated on authentic dialogue, no matter how brutal and disheartening that dialogue is.In other words, you‚Äôve let us know what we‚Äôre really dealing with here and while it‚Äôs been rightly disturbing, it‚Äôs also been revelatory. That‚Äôs the thing about that kind of harsh light: you‚Äôre forced to see everything. Beauty and monstrosity equally illuminated.Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, I think you‚Äôre the least qualified, least knowledgeable Presidential candidate we may ever have had participate this far into the process, and if you somehow were elected I‚Äôd fear gravely for the world my children would inherit‚Äîshould it survive your Presidency at all. I believe you‚Äôre reckless, bitter, and completely reprehensible; the very worst kind of bully.But whether you win or lose, you‚Äôve already allowed me the blessing of Truth; about me, about you, about other candidates, about our nation.And in the process you‚Äôve also shown me that I am not alone in resisting you and this ugly thing you‚Äôve revealed about us.You‚Äôve generated an equally loud, equally passionate response to it and this is where I find my hope these days.I find it in those for whom equality isn‚Äôt just a cheap buzzword, it‚Äôs the most precious of hills to die on.I find it in those people who refuse to be silent in the face of our impending shared regression.I find it in those willing to be bolder in defending the inherent value of all people.I find it in the growing army of those who will not tolerate hatred as a core American value.I find it in those who reject violence as our default response to dissension.I find it in the ever rising voice of people who will not let malice and bitterness represent them in the world.Today I find my hope in those who, like me, will not be complicit in allowing bigotry and intolerance to become a source of national pride, because we‚Äôve seen where that leads.Yes, Mr Trump, you‚Äôve unearthed our hidden sickness and you‚Äôve allowed it to go viral.You brought every awful thing about us out into the open.You will NEVER Get My Vote!Clifford Phillips Jr's Tomahawked

A ‚Äú.Net‚Äù program is written, then it is compiled, the output from the compile is stored in an area referred to as ‚ÄúMetadata‚Äù.

2 | Sam William | 28 | 1552029384817086_1552676758085682 | Trump should be investigated for treason for encouraging Russia to interfere with our election...and by the way when is Trump‚Äôs racketeering and fraud case is it b4 or after his rape case of 13 yr old girl ,not to mention the 12 women accusing him of sexual assault.
3 | Selena Ellis | 7 | 1552029384817086_1552696188083739 | Obamacare has not tripled,my daughter has used it 2 two years now. She has 0 premiums, Last year she was diagnosed with cancer,she would have died without Obamacare,She paid nothing out of pocket for treatments. During her treatments she continued to attend Culinary School and continued to volunteer with Meal on Wheels, She is cancer free now and will go to work for Meals on Wheels to give back to the community.  Trump will go to trial in December for the rape of a 13 yr old girl. Trump will go to trial on fraud charges for his Trump University.Trump has 12 women he has groped without their permission. Trump faces 169 trial and courts dates Trump has married two immigrants and wishes to build a wall. He is supporting Russia instead of his own country. He hire immigrants to work for him and imports foreign goods for his hotels. He lacks any record of supporting the American people ,With all this you think he will make a good President. The President's job is like hiring any job position, it requires knowledge and experience,Trump has neither, It requires background check,Trump certainly would not pass it.Thus the reason people feel that Trump supporters may be racist and uneducated.

6 | Cecilia St Laurent Toulouse | 0 | 1552029384817086_1552817104738314 | Mr. Hedglin. If you cared to research you would find out most radio and tv stations are actually owned by the 1%. These are the people affiliated with power all over the world and responsible for the TEA PARTY.  The media has treated Hillary very badly; due to her and her husbands resistance  to this particular sect and not allowing them to do as they please with America . The media has allowed all of us to believe she is dishonest, although she has been cleared of everything they have ever accused her of. DONALD TRUMP on the other hand; they are simply repeating what he says. Using his own words. The ALT-RIGHT counts on you to be too busy to check the facts. And obviously you don't.  Use your head; When the KKK supports a candidate there is a reason for it. When BREITBART supports a candidate there is a reason for it. The 4 people closest to Trump have been making theirs life's mission to destroy Hillary.  Think! why are they so afraid of her?
7 | Dean Felix | 0 | 1552029384817086_1552822424737782 | For those of you who wonder why so many of us are voting for Trump- I think this sums it up pretty good! For What It's Worth Department:                                        The Media just doesn‚Äôt get it....they can't believe that people are so angry     that they can no longer be manipulated!  Millions of trump supporters feel this way about Donald J. Trump.....We don't care if the guy swears... or how many times he's been married...or who he voted for, or what his income tax return shows. We want the problems fixed. Yes, he's an egomaniac, but we don't care. We know he's not a racist, or all the other things the liberal media is trying to label him with. We know he's raised a good family, and that says a lot about him.The country is a mess because politicians suck, the Republican Party is two faced & gutless, and illegals are everywhere and Muslims are openly trying to hurt this country and make the civilized world adjust to them. We want it all fixed!We don't care that Trump is crude, we don't care that he has changed positions, we don't care that he fights with Megan Kelly, Rosie O'Donnell, and so many of the elected establishment. We don't care that Rubio, Ryan, the Bush's, and so many other top old and new Republicans refuse to endorse him for their own selfish reasons, and we know what they are. We don't care that he doesn't know the name of some Muslim terrorists, we don't care that he tried some businesses that didn't work out.This country is weak, bankrupt, our enemies are making fun of us, we are being invaded by illegals, we are becoming a nation of victims, where every Tom, Ricardo and Hasid is a special group with special rights to a point where we don't even recognize the country we were born and raised in, AND WE JUST WANT IT FIXED. And TRUMP is the only guy who seems to understand what the people want.We're sick of politicians, sick of the Democratic and Republican Party. We're angry about the Iran deal, the budget, treatment of Israel, military weakness, lobbyists, special interests, overpaid politicians with their self serving bills and back room deals, trade deals, loss of jobs, manipulated economic numbers, businesses fleeing, and even the phony pay for play Clinton Foundation.Americans are no longer going to be fooled, and the movement is out to change the direction we're taking. Trump may not be a saint, but he doesn't have lobbyist money holding him, he doesn't have political correctness restraining him, and all you know is that he has been very successful, a good negotiator, he has built a lot of things, he's flexible, and he's also not a politician. And he says he'll fix it. And we believe him because he is too much of an egotist to be proven wrong or looked at and called a liar.Public service has become elected greed. This may be our only chance to have a non-politician, despite his flaws, try and correct the mess, at least for 4 years. We must take the shot, because the consequences of putting Hillary Clinton in office are frightening. There is a tidal wave happening, and it's going to overcome much of what's happened to this country.

NBC writes  ‚ÄúBut Trump's escalation in rhetoric, paired with his longstanding reluctance to denounce extremist supporters, has civil rights groups worried that conditions are becoming dangerous.‚ÄúThis fear is especially pronounced because Trump has cast such a wide net in picking targets, and they often have a racial, ethnic, or religious component. He's regularly made false claims about American Muslims celebrating terrorism or refusing to turn in an attacker and warned that "other communities" ‚Äî almost invariably cities with large minority populations ‚Äî are out to steal the election. Recently, Trump told Fox News "illegal immigrants are voting all over the country.""What happens on Nov. 9 is anyone's guess, but some of these trend lines of mainstreaming and broadening bigotry and incidents of violence and hints of a dark conspiracy are very concerning," Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, said in an interview.

2 | Jackson Eggers | 183 | 1337554249674157_1337559083007007 | To the liberals and progressives out there. As you can see it is critical now more than ever that you get out and vote. My take on this new FBI investigation is that it is a political hit piece. It's a plot hatched by embarrassed FBI agents looking for revenge and Republicans trying to gain advantage by any means necessary. Think about it, what do the emails the feds have really say? No one knows because they won't release them. So why release a statement saying basically we are investigating, but we won't tell you what our new evidence is or why it is important. This is the kind of justice and government we can look forward to under President Trump with a Republican majority. They will use the power of government to harass and persecute all their enemies, real and imagined. If you want to fight against Trump and his politics of revenge, then you MUST get out and vote blue all the way down the ticket. You can make a difference.
3 | ƒÜ√ø Herrington | 73 | 1337554249674157_1337570719672510 | Trump has upcoming fraud and child rape trials. Trump tried to do business in Cuba during an embargo. Trump used his charity's money to buy a portrait of himself and pay fines. Trump lied about donating to veterans and 9/11 charities. Trump stiffed sub-contractors out of payment. Trump used illegal Polish immigrants to build Trump Tower. Trump was sued for not renting to black people. Trump "Donated" $25,000 to Florida's Attorney General causing her to drop the investigation into Trump University.Trump bragged about sexual assault. Trump left the State of NJ with an unpaid $25 million tax bill. Trump was found guilty of creating a fake anti-gambling front organization to slander Native American casino competition. Trump has been repeatedly fined for breaking rules related to his operation of casinos. Trump was fined $750,000 by the FTC for failing to disclose his purchases of stock in two companies.The hypocrisy of Trump supporters is too funny and too sad at the same time.

5 | Janay King | 60 | 1337554249674157_1337560673006848 | He has lost his mind!As we run into this final stretch in the 2016 vote, I wanted to make a post that helps to keep people on target since this is such an important election. Let‚Äôs think about the recent Brexit vote that is forcing the United Kingdom to exit the European Union, for a moment. In that vote, people made a protest vote against staying in the Union because they didn‚Äôt think that it would really happen. The Result, many Millennial Voters desperately want to take their vote back, saying that they were not being serious. In the 1980‚Äôs Carter was up by 8 points in the polls, people did not come out to vote because they thought that he had it beat. In the 2000 election, people were not thrilled about Al Gore, thinking that he was too much of a bore, and not a strong candidate. Many Liberals voted for Ralph Nader instead of Al Gore, and handed George Bush Jr. a razor thin victory that resulted in a disastrous 8 years. Listen People, I understand that it really looks like Hillary has this all sewn up. Trust me when I say that she doesn‚Äôt. It is not over until the last vote is counted.  She may not be your candidate that you are willing to stand on railroad tracks to get elected, she may not be your perfect choice for President, BUTIf history tells us anything, it is that we should never take anything for granted. This election needs to be won by Hillary Clinton. It is not enough to say that Hillary Needs to be President, but that she needs to win by such a huge margin so we never have to see Trump, or anyone like Trump, on the ballot ever again. We need to retake Congress. We need to vote blue for all Congressmen and Senators so we can retake the House and Senate. We need to put a stop to this crazy Republican right wing insanity that has gripped our government for years because of blind racism and stupidity. Get out there, Vote, get your Friends and Family to vote. Stop the insanity!!!!

This is a man who‚Äôs: Mocked a man with disabilities. Attacked the parents of a fallen American hero. Belittled POWs and the war record of Sen. John McCain. Lied about how much money he raised for veterans. Called a former Miss Universe ‚Äúdisgusting‚Äù and fat, telling his Twitter followers to find her non-existent sex tape. Accused an American-born federal judge of being unfit to do his job because of his Mexican heritage. Likely avoided paying taxes for nearly two decades. Called most Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals, even though that‚Äôs not remotely factual. Lied about seeing ‚Äúthousands and thousands‚Äù of Muslims celebrating in New Jersey on 9/11. Lied about getting a letter from the NFL complaining about the debate schedule. Tried to exploit the death of an African American woman in Chicago to say that‚Äôs why black voters will support him. Found the ‚Äúbright side‚Äù to tragedies because his poll numbers tend to go up. Settled with the Department of Justice after his company was found guilty of racially discriminating against minorities. Has cheated on at least one wife. Was just discovered on video admitting that he not only tried to cheat on his current wife, but he attempted to do so with another married woman. Had his first wife publicly say that he did nothing when it came to raising their children until they were old enough to talk business. Tweeted that women should have expected to be sexually assaulted when they mixed males and females together in the military. Said he wants to target the families of terrorists. Stated that he wants to ban an entire religion. Praised a Russian president who obviously hates the U.S. and Americans. Encouraged the Russian government to commit espionage against Americans. Insinuated that another Republican‚Äôs wife was ugly. Tried to implicate another Republican‚Äôs father in JFK‚Äôs assassination. Sought out the help of former Fox News CEO Roger Ailes after he was fired following multiple allegations that he had sexually harassed women for years. Made Breitbart‚Äôs Steve Bannon one of his top campaign people. Had a former campaign manager abruptly resign after a report came out linking him to pro-Russian groups that were directly trying to undermine U.S. policy in eastern Europe. Called Carly Fiornia ugly. Has said climate change was a hoax created by the Chinese ‚Äî then denied saying it. Was a leading conspiracy theorist when it came to the racist-driven birther conspiracies against President Obama. Dismissed nearly eight years of accusing the president of not being an American with a less than 30 second statement where he didn‚Äôt apologize for any of it. Tried to blame Hillary Clinton for his racism. Re-tweeted anti-African American propaganda created by a white supremacy group. Played dumb about knowing who former Grand Wizard of the KKK David Duke was. Skipped a presidential debate because he was scared of a moderator. Has, on several occasions, suggested he finds his daughter attractive. Called a husband doing things like changing diapers and helping with the children, a man ‚Äútrying to be the wife.‚Äù Has said he wants more countries to have nuclear weapons.

24 | Debra Combs | 2 | 1337554249674157_1337685812994334 | On Oct. 10, 1989 waves of grief and shock ran through Trump‚Äôs organization and 5 families just months before it opened the Trump Taj Mahal Casino & Hotel, then billed as the largest casino in the world. At the same time the business ((Taj) faced major financial challenges. There was a Helicopter crash and 5 good men died. The three Trump organization executives killed when the Trump helicopter crashed in a wooded Garden State Parkway median in Lacey Township were: Etess, 37, of Margate; Trump senior executive in charge of all Atlantic City operations Stephen Hyde, 43, of Linwood; and Executive Vice President of the Trump Plaza Hotel Casino Johnathan Benanav, 33, of Margate. Two pilots also died. It was well known that Trump was the driving force in the Trump Organization, but Hyde was the guy who pulled everything together for him in Atlantic City,‚Äù said Daniel Lee, an analyst with the investment banking firm of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. "As you can imagine they fought like cats and dogs".Federal investigators determined a faulty rotor caused the crash. That was found miles away from the scene of the crash. The investigation also found that Trump leased Helicopters had failed operator inspections and missed the required service appointments to address the infractions. Trump knew about it, he was too cheap to get the repairs. The helicopter was pressed into service when it should not have been flying. Trump was negligent in not updating his business license for the shuttle service and getting the repairs required to operate the helicopters. The investigation also found that days before the crash Donald J. Trump and VP Stephen Hyde had been fighting about financial problems associated with the project. Sources say, Trump threaten he would get even with Hyde. It was later found that the manager Trump hired to run Trump Helicopter was connected to organize crime and later went to prison for drug trafficking and murder. The bodies were not even cold yet and Trump appointed his brother Robert to replace Etess, but he didn‚Äôt last. Robert Trump quit after feeling humiliated by his older brother. Are you not surprised. Trump threaten him as well. Then the law suit came. Trump sued the manufacturer and operator of the helicopter after the crash. Isn't it odd that one of Donald Trump's brothers is dead (Trump fought his brother Freddy's family for their inheritance) and the other was kicked out of the family business. Were they loaned 14 million as well? Was it just a case where one sibling eats another. Although I find it interesting, but I digressed. In April 1991, a federal judge ruled that Trump‚Äôs three casinos were not entitled to millions of dollars in damages to compensate for business losses allegedly arising from the deaths.Only the families of the victims could rightfully seek damages related to wrongful death, a judge ruled.The families settled with both the manufacturer and the operator of the craft, which Trump had leased.Trump blamed the Helicopter crash on the failure of his marriage. (It had nothing to do with his cheating) Before the law suit ruling was announced. Trump told New York Magazine in February 1990 that the crash convinced him to pursue a divorce from his first wife, Ivana. Records show that it was his wife that filed for divorce because she caught him cheating. Trump said, "I think the helicopter had something to do with it,‚Äù Trump said in an interview published in the March 5 issue. It showed him ‚Äúhow short and how fragile life is.‚Äù He preceded in trying to leave his wife broke.Trump later married actress and model Marla Maples, then age 26 in 1993. When Trump is your friend do you need enemies?Trump went on to say that "Emotionally was the hardest part because I lost three great friends,‚Äù said Trump, 43 at the time. ‚ÄúTo have three of your best friends go down like this. It‚Äôs a horror.‚ÄùThis is an odd statement. These were the same 3 best friends he let ride in a company helicopter that should not have been flying. This is the same 3 best friends Trump refused to pay benefits to the families of the men that died while in mid day working for Trump. Sources say, these three executives that died was threaten by Donald J Trump daily. Trump is the guy that was upset because the families of his 3 best friends settled with the helicopter manufacturer and he was not paid in the settlement. Trump as the families of the deceased men to give him part of the settlement to cover his "losses".People die everyday, it is part of life. Very large number of people die in war. The US lost more than 7, 000 people in the Afghanistan/Iraq war. Americans have lost millions of people that have paid the ultimate sacrifice in effort to protect our freedom. All Americans are grateful and forever indebted for their service. Hillary cannot be blamed for the 4 men in Benghazi death's, just like Bush cannot be blamed for the Afghan war, or Lincoln can be blamed for the civil war. Do you agree?Maybe you don't agree..,If people can blame Hillary for the deaths of the men that was in a middle of a military war zone in Benghazi, then Trump was more responsible for the lives of 5 men that died while working for the Trump organization in peaceful New Jersey (USA).Although it is a shame that any one of these men died. There has been a lot of talk about Benghazi, in which Hillary was cleared, but people keep accusing her of the deaths. Ok, here it goes Trump was investigated for negligence and was not indicted, is it because Rudy Giuliani was the Attorney General of the southern district of New York at the time. These 5 men that died worked for Trump had families also, no one seems to care about them. Or do they? TRUMP, MURDER DOES NOT HAVE STATUTE OF LIMITATION.

Pence defended Comey's decision to notify Congress of the potentially new batch of emails despite top DOJ officials arguing such disclosure of information that lacks substantive detail is not a standing practice, particularly when it could influence an election.

1 | Amara Belle Barksdale | 164 | 1337534216342827_1337536806342568 | Well of course he would defend it, this is a blatant political ploy. But what about trumps skeletons Lola such hypocrites. Now I'm going to make sure I vote on the 8 this is a dirty way to get votes.
2 | Cheryl Stolle | 124 | 1337534216342827_1337540093008906 | How about revealing info about the FBI investigations of Trump, and the rape allegations. Trump has no business calling anyone other than himself a perv. He is the very definition of the term.
3 | Jessica Naomi | 87 | 1337534216342827_1337537609675821 | Figures Feckless Pence would do that but what is NBC excuse for refusing to release Deplorable Donald racist sexist Apprentice tapes rants what are YOU hiding Chuck Todd?

5 | Jacqueline Parkey | 37 | 1337534216342827_1337550463007869 | Bwahahahaha says the candidates that keep tax returns secret, has two politicalOperatives that has to leave campaign overnight bc of Russian Kremlin ties , so in debt to Chinese and Russian banks, has a trump U racketeering trial in Nov, a child rape case in Dec, currently named (as always, so it has nothing to do with bringing him down) in double digit law suits bc he won't pay his bills, is under FBI investigation for working with Russia to interfere with US elections, double digit sexually assaulted women coming forward after he lied on national tv that he never does  it, asked his campaign staff what a Gold Star family was, and had to cease and desist his illegal charity... you know, the one that he took donations from others and used it for paintings of himself, to pay his legal fees for some of his nearly 4,000 lawsuits against him-some for sexual harassment spanning decades, and a fountain for one of his golf courses. I think Mike Pence should stfu so ppl don't start talking about how republicans in his state refused to reelect him as their governor. He was just that bad.
6 | Eva Capaldi | 43 | 1337534216342827_1337539993008916 | It was just clearly stated on the morning news that the FBI director himself doesn't even know if these emails are significant so if he didn't know they were significant he should've never have said anything until he review them he is getting a lot of heat right now because he has strong something else there and he has no details I know that anything is even significant
7 | Imogene Aldridge Hall | 28 | 1337534216342827_1337534933009422 | Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin brought this all on themselves. It wouldn't be happening 8 days before an election if the two of them had not lied and destroyed/hid evidence.
8 | Joshua Sickles | 7 | 1337534216342827_1337552269674355 | A vote for Hillary might very well end up being a vote for Kaine.  So liberals have seen proof that the DNC conspired against their beloved Bernie. They know she has lied to the FBI and the American people. They know she deleted classified emails that was never supposed to of been on the server they was on and before you say they was personal emails just don't, no one goes through the expensive process of bleaching their server to hide non criminal emails it's just common sense. She let Americans die in Benghazi.  She takes money from countries that kills GAYS.  Has anyone heard her condem these countries?  Nope she takes their dirty money.  Then their is wiki leaks but all democrats will say that those emails are made up and not authentic.  Even our own military and police do not support her. If our nations heros don't support her but you do then you might be part of the liberal problem in America. A bunch of easily offended sissy's who want the government to tax the rich more because they can't figure out how to make it on their own without having the government steal it from someone and then give it to you.  Then there is obama care and the disaster that is. She says she wants to fix it.... No you can't fix it or you would of already did it so you can look forward to crazy high premiums that no one can afford.
9 | Thomas Huntley | 11 | 1337534216342827_1337540446342204 | Hillary's supporters still back her and DT's supporters still back him. This changes nothing. Just high drama to fill the cable news talk shows for the next week #hurryupnovember9
10 | Ken Myers | 3 | 1337534216342827_1337594766336772 | Just remember: Trump will go on trial in November for accused Racketeering, and again in December accused of child rape. He is a sexual predator, and hasn't released his tax returns, and has used his foundation money to pay his legal fees. So instead lets talk about emails Hillary did not send from someone else's computer. Come on America lets focus. The whole Trump campaign is to get you confused and apathetic, if you stay home you get Trump. The release is timed to save House and Senate members, that is why they released tweets before the letter was received. We must do one thing above all else. That is make sure another Trump never even tries again we must leave no doubt.
11 | Gwendolyn Robertson | 3 | 1337534216342827_1337644799665102 | Six-Pence would say that, because he's a Trumpster-clone with no morals. No one bothered to wait until anything was found, and once Comey made that decision to attack the e-mails, Comey stepped over the line to sway the vote to one candidate against the other. He should be fired. And Trumpster, who didn't wait for a decision, he jumps on his high horse and spews his venom. Now they ALL have EGG on THEIR FACES! Self-serving bunch of hypocrites.
12 | Ali Bomaye | 23 | 1337534216342827_1337539049675677 | We know Trump is racist, rapist and Russian puppet. That is why he won't release his Tax returns. No wonder they want to distract us with Hillary's emails. Even Wikileaks & Russians couldn't find a smoking gun.
13 | Anna Shive | 9 | 1337534216342827_1337586096337639 | These men disgust me. Let's see all your emails for a change. Your man Trump has not released anything. I don't give a Damm about the emails. I will vote Hillary no matter what.
14 | Nancy Chavira | 7 | 1337534216342827_1337558766340372 | Remember way back when the republicans said there would be a bombshell coming in October, they knew, don't be fooled! They are just as crooked.
15 | Raksha Andreassen | 2 | 1337534216342827_1337612293001686 | Your coverage of emails found on Huma Abedin's husband's computer sucks! You fail to mention that FBI knew about the emails while ago and yet they didn't investigate the emails or notify Comey who was stupid to disclose that information 11 days before the election. For all I know these emails were - looked at already - are duplicates- could have been altered by a rogue, right wing FBI agent- or they have nothing to do with Hillary's personal serverMy vote for Hillary remains solid!!!
16 | John Wilson | 7 | 1337534216342827_1337540583008857 | It was not really a surprise,people sort of expected that the 30thousand email would show up, but  we didn't expect it would be the FBI not wikileaks. It really shouldn't have an impact. There are two kind of voters, ones that know she is corrupt and one that knows she is corrupt and will still vote for her.

18 | Tammy Trahan Reeves | 3 | 1337534216342827_1337610446335204 | Apparently, the FBI forgot to visit the Cornell Law Library. Word for word from the Cornell Law Library Former United States Attorney General Michael Mukasey tells MSNBC that not only is Hillary Clinton‚Äôs private email server illegal, it ‚Äúdisqualifies‚Äù her from holding any federal office. Very specifically points to one federal law, Title 18. Section 2071.So here‚Äôs the one law you need to know that should terminate her presidential campaign:For those of us who do not have United States Code committed to memory, here‚Äôs what it says:‚Äù(a) Whoever willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys, or attempts to do so, or, with intent to do so takes and carries away any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both. (b) Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States. As used in this subsection, the term ‚Äúoffice‚Äù does not include the office held by any person as a retired officer of the Armed Forces of the United States.‚ÄùYes, it explicitly states ‚Äúshall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States.‚Äù
19 | Sue Fox | 3 | 1337534216342827_1337561933006722 | It's a violation of the Hatch Act.

Either candidate can not trust him to serve in their administration
20 | Denzil P Walker | 4 | 1337534216342827_1337551466341102 | No matter the personal advantage, at some point in time, some person has to see that Director Comey overstepped his partiality. To sit there, and not acknowledge that, shows the colors of this hypocrite who loves to say, "I'm a Christian, a conservative, and a Republican" in that order. As is often the case, those who love to get on their soapboxes and declare their selective Christianity, are some of the worst hypocrites of whom Christ warned us in his teachings.
21 | Joseph James Mohn | 3 | 1337534216342827_1337564649673117 | Of course the DOJ was against it. They've been protecting Hillary since day 1. Loreta Lynch's secret meeting with Bill Clinton just enforces that known fact.

A bit of the old pot & kettle story.Hillary is a lier ....Dangerous Donald has been caught & verified in many, many lies to the American Public. Hillary is dishonest. ...... Dangerous Donald is being sued for fraud and has been shown to not honor his contracts. Hillary is secretive. ..... Dangerous Donald will not show ANY tax returns, it's non of the People's business. The election is rigged. ..... this latest FBI release may have been orchestrated by the Republicans to do exactly that. On a state & local level the Republicans have been trying to suppress voter registration & turn out. When one looks at Dangerous Donald, it's plainly evident that whatever he claims is bad about Hillary, he, Dangerous Donald, has already participated in similar activities.
24 | Joshua Feind | 1 | 1337534216342827_1337628883000027 | A ****ing never ending circle. When this does not pan out, which it won't, they'll choose another aquaintence or friend of the Clintons and demand their emails. Nothing new and more tax payers money all to beat a dead horse.

While some believe 'October Surprises' date back to the earliest American elections, it was Henry Kissinger's election-eve promise of peace that began the modern history of the last-minute bombshell. Will FBI Director Comey's email revelation join the ranks?
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Roberto Zullo | 52 | 1336687483094167_1337488503014065 | LOL not in a million years, the FBI tried to change the face of these elections, but it's not going to happen. In January a lot of big boys will be losing their job over at the Bureau .
2 | Michael Smith | 14 | 1336687483094167_1337492113013704 | At this point why would Hilary still want to be president? If shes elected she will still be under FBI investigation. Plus she will get absolutly nothing she wants done because Republicans will have a majority in Congress and will make her life a living hell. I see her having a stroke in 6 months.
3 | Lonnie Sapp | 18 | 1336687483094167_1337520606344188 | Lie cheat steal or bully your way to the top!?! The American way..., right.

5 | Robert Rich | 10 | 1336687483094167_1337486959680886 | To me it looks like the FBI found a missed location as to where the emails were being sent to have the classifications stripped before being turned over in the first part of the open investigation!
6 | Deborah Brien | 2 | 1336687483094167_1337641759665406 | This has got to stop! I hope all Hillary supports run, not walk, to the voting booths across America. Americans need to boot all obstructionists out of office. Anyone Republican who has come forth with a plan to begin more "hearings" on Clinton if she wins, should be voted out while we still have a chance for a sane, do-SOMETHING presidency. Taxpayer money should not be wasted on witch-hunts. And while I'm at it..... how about boycotting EVERY company that advertises on cable news programs. This includes every one of them. I'm heard enough spin this weekend to need a double-dose of Dramamine. The 24 hour cable news networks need to fill 24 hours, and frankly the "hosts" either repeat ad nauseum or they convolute and fill their questions with innuendo (on both sides). A boycott would send a clear message that Americans are sick of the manipulation.

"The public has a right to know this information... And yet, you continue to resist calls to inform the public." Harry Reid 10/30/16If the allegations against Trump and his campaign are true, but are hidden by the FBI and Trump is elected, Putin will have the ability to blackmail Trump for his entire Presidency.

Not that it will make a 'huge' difference in the ultimate outcome of the election, but could tip the scales in a few 'swing states', combined with Voter ID suppression, of minorities and college students.. Talk about 'rigging' the election.. From 'gerrymandering' districts, to Voter ID laws, to cutting minority voting locations, cutting out voting inside college campus locations, cutting early voting days, now the FBI director getting unprofessionally, and illegally involved.. Its disturbing.. As has been said, Trump is like a 5th grader, doing a oral book report on a book he never read, unprepared, and unfit, an uncaring, just enough effort to get by.. Like Benghazi, emails, emails, emails, will dominate the next week from the media.. Chris Matthews of CNN might get his wish of a close election.. The media now has a 'topic' to over kill, dwell on, discuss to ridiculous lengths.. The talking heads are in 'mania mode', their heads exploding and hair on fire..

This country had been the laughing stock of the world for over a year, and now for Comey to release such a confusing and nonsensical public statement regarding the Clinton campaign, only adds fire to that ridicule. Even the Justice Department informed him that he should not release any information. He justifies the release so to "make clear the FBI was not holding anything back from the public." He should have called the top 3 republicans, and top 3 democrats, in for a coffee and chat. Comey was a registered Republican for most of his adult life, he disclosed during Congressional testimony on July 7, 2016 CNN and other news media outlets pointed out the similarities between Comey and J. Edgar Hoover in "influencing" elections. His past is filled with dealings of a shady nature. And, 3 months after becoming an unregistered Republican, and less than 2 weeks before an election he starts doing useless disclosures and press conferences? The only person to benefit from his actions is the Republican Party and, in particular, Donald J. Trump, Jr. Because of this little stunt, there could be 3, 4, or more Swiss and Cayman accounts open already. Maybe this would be a good time to call for an examination of Trump's accounts. I am not claiming or asserting the FBI can be bought. But, it sure is coincidental.
12 | Butch Betts | 4 | 1336687483094167_1337512633011652 | I'm sure the news of the investigation being reopened is heart breaking for some but the truth is the only person to blame is Hillary for making this mess. If she had not been working outside proper guidelines, for whatever reason you may come up with, NONE of this would be happening.
13 | Donna Straley | 3 | 1336687483094167_1337595773003338 | The "October surprise" is that an FBI director broke the law by releasing a statement full of speculation & innuendo in a deliberate attempt to tilt an election towards his party's candidate. This is an abuse of power on an unprecedented level & is another attack on democracy by Republicans.
14 | Thomas T. Panto | 4 | 1336687483094167_1337512163011699 | THIS is EXACTLY why Americans need democrats leading America.  ACCUSATIONS (''wmd'') are all the republicans have had for decades . . See Moscow to know how propaganda corrupts human minds. The worshipers of the republican religion actually hate themselves. THAT is how ALL political religions on earth work.
15 | Carolyn Ege | 3 | 1336687483094167_1337516289677953 | Hilliary is trying to blame anyone but her self..It must be real bad...Because they are going to reopen HILLIARY emails ...They did not say Wiener or his wife email but HILLIARYS.
16 | Devvon Mayherrun | 4 | 1336687483094167_1337514936344755 | "Mrs. Clinton appears to have converted the office of secretary of state into a racketeering enterprise.

19 | Jason Brantley | 3 | 1336687483094167_1337528703010045 | Most of us expect Director Comey to take National Security concerns seriously. If Hillary, and her team had complied with the subpoena in the first place she would not be in this situation.

21 | Dan Wimmis | 1 | 1336687483094167_1337533026342946 | If so many people are so stupid that the email nonissue causes Clinton to lose then America deserves the fitting end, that Trump represents, of American greatness.
22 | Rhonda Ludlow | 1 | 1336687483094167_1337563779673204 | this is no surprise this is a matter we have been hearing about for two years so why should this new info change anyone mind Its either voting Trump who has offended  so many and his crazy thoughts on what the president power means to him, or Hilary and her emails if its about trust they both have lied she at least took some ownership . I mean this is serous stuff what will other nations think of the Americans if we vote someone like Trump , I mean yes Hilary has Email's not sexually assaults , ect ....
23 | Gerald Ott | 1 | 1336687483094167_1337577666338482 | Anthony Weiner‚Äôs computer had emails on it? Wow. Who knew? Mine doesn't. I keep my emails in my pocket with loose change. Where do you keep yours? The FBI has had Weiner‚Äôs hard drive (pardon the pun) for a long time - long enough to know it contained "emails" which, I think, is what got the Weiner in trouble. Why did Comey sit on this until now? And, no one has reported that Huma actually used the device - or, if so, that she sent a "howdy" (or anything) to HRC. Comey can't get off with a hand slap here. He's delinquent and untimely in his discovery tactics. If Huma posted cat pictures on a FB page and Comely can't figure that out in 15 minutes, he needs to looking for another job.
24 | Karen Jones | 0 | 1336687483094167_1337684106327838 | I laugh everyday when I read statements from trump supporters about Hillary being a criminal. When Trump's whole life has been heaped with dishonest issues and it is determined most everyday that he lies. But Hillary is the problem. It is ashamed that pants really don't catch on fire with a lie cause Trump would have been burnt to a crisp the very first time he opened his mouth. This is just a crime to the American people that someone so unfit to be evan the local dog catcher if they still existed is now the candidate for Party. Trump is not going to win and it will be his own party and the women that will nail that coffin closed. The only thing Trump is going to shake up is the money he has taken from his supporters and lined his own pockets with. I want a President that my grandchildren can look up to and that is not trump since he spends the majority of his time in the gutter.
25 | Dean Felix | 0 | 1336687483094167_1337798189649763 | For those of you who wonder why so many of us are voting for Trump- I think this sums it up pretty good! For What It's Worth Department:                                        The Media just doesn‚Äôt get it....they can't believe that people are so angry     that they can no longer be manipulated!  Millions of trump supporters feel this way about Donald J. Trump.....We don't care if the guy swears... or how many times he's been married...or who he voted for, or what his income tax return shows. We want the problems fixed. Yes, he's an egomaniac, but we don't care. We know he's not a racist, or all the other things the liberal media is trying to label him with. We know he's raised a good family, and that says a lot about him.The country is a mess because politicians suck, the Republican Party is two faced & gutless, and illegals are everywhere and Muslims are openly trying to hurt this country and make the civilized world adjust to them. We want it all fixed!We don't care that Trump is crude, we don't care that he has changed positions, we don't care that he fights with Megan Kelly, Rosie O'Donnell, and so many of the elected establishment. We don't care that Rubio, Ryan, the Bush's, and so many other top old and new Republicans refuse to endorse him for their own selfish reasons, and we know what they are. We don't care that he doesn't know the name of some Muslim terrorists, we don't care that he tried some businesses that didn't work out.This country is weak, bankrupt, our enemies are making fun of us, we are being invaded by illegals, we are becoming a nation of victims, where every Tom, Ricardo and Hasid is a special group with special rights to a point where we don't even recognize the country we were born and raised in, AND WE JUST WANT IT FIXED. And TRUMP is the only guy who seems to understand what the people want.We're sick of politicians, sick of the Democratic and Republican Party. We're angry about the Iran deal, the budget, treatment of Israel, military weakness, lobbyists, special interests, overpaid politicians with their self serving bills and back room deals, trade deals, loss of jobs, manipulated economic numbers, businesses fleeing, and even the phony pay for play Clinton Foundation.Americans are no longer going to be fooled, and the movement is out to change the direction we're taking. Trump may not be a saint, but he doesn't have lobbyist money holding him, he doesn't have political correctness restraining him, and all you know is that he has been very successful, a good negotiator, he has built a lot of things, he's flexible, and he's also not a politician. And he says he'll fix it. And we believe him because he is too much of an egotist to be proven wrong or looked at and called a liar.Public service has become elected greed. This may be our only chance to have a non-politician, despite his flaws, try and correct the mess, at least for 4 years. We must take the shot, because the consequences of putting Hillary Clinton in office are frightening. There is a tidal wave happening, and it's going to overcome much of what's happened to this country.

Following the revelation that the FBI is investigating more emails related to Hillary Clinton, new polls show her barely in the lead.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Ken Odil | 251 | 1337434306352818_1337439453018970 | In July Comey was acting in accordance with Justice Department protocol and procedure. Today it was announced the FBI knew about these emails back in September and didn't do anything about them, never requested a warrant to gain access to them but Comey makes this announcements 11 days before the election and addresses the letter directly to the Republicans and only cc's the Dems. The Republican from Utah tweets out that message before the Dems knew anything about it. Sounds like someone is trying to change the outcome of this election, don't you think?  What I really want to know is when is Comey going to resign and how long will he be spending in prison.
2 | Jeremy Turner | 136 | 1337434306352818_1337435926352656 | Trump is a freaking Republican. They don't have teams. Voting Republican in the USA is like voting for a party that's just at the passing point for the legal system to not be the Nazi Party. She's gonna win. The question is: where do you take this in Congress? Republicans are loss. Republicans are loss. All of that.
3 | Robert Saltzman | 165 | 1337434306352818_1337435719686010 | If anything it invigorated the Clinton campaign. If I haden't voted yet it wouldn't have changed my vote one ioata. If I voted tomorrow or next week I'd still be voting Blue down the ticket...
4 | Linda Dedrick | 89 | 1337434306352818_1337448953018020 | Come on people we just need to VOTE and emails mean nothing don't care what any poll's say we must VOTE that's all we have to do up or down in poll's just VOTE BIG AND BLUE and that racist sexist pig TRUMP can't win. NEVER EVER TRUMP.
5 | Trevor L Stewart Saunders | 58 | 1337434306352818_1337454836350765 | How has it reached a turning point?  You have emails on one hand,  and you have a rapist,  lying racist on the other...who is voting for this man..? This country has really let me down!
6 | Bronia Wroblewska-Potts | 36 | 1337434306352818_1337460949683487 | so now they say barely in the lead.,.tomorrow she will have double digit lead and the day after she will be behind..the media is trying ot keep itself relevant here too so I have no idea who they poll because I and everyone i know has never been called for a poll or asked for our opinion etc.
7 | Earl Franklin Clemons Jr | 42 | 1337434306352818_1337434453019470 | Dems are panicking and then all of their dirty tricks are on full display --- calling names, innuendo, distraction, lying, spinning, excuse creating, blaming, temper tantrums, hissy fits, memory loss/amnesia, blaming others for what they are guilty of, bed wetting, hugging/biting their panic pillows, seeking solstice in safe spaces and OMG just acting like a kindergarten class of whiney 5 year olds ...... It is all the fault of other people or party.
8 | Lewis Lester | 16 | 1337434306352818_1337467486349500 | Morning Joe are making massive fools of themselves. Mika had √† Clinton opinion this morning that was incoherent because she didn't understand what Joe told her say. The panel has given up on forwarding opinions to Joe because he dismisses anything that disputes his recently exaggerated unorthodoxy. He keeps trying position himself as reasonable partisan but in the end he will be faced with a Clinton victory and like 2012 shrug his shoulders.
9 | Chris Wilkie | 26 | 1337434306352818_1337437463019169 | 1. Trump said follow the $..2. The Clinton Foundations largest donor was Saudi Arabia.3. Hillary purposefully set up a private server to store classified info. 4. Her closest advisor Huma is the daughter of a devout Muslim in the Muslim Brotherhood from Saudi Arabia. My prediction of the next Wikileaks drop will be proof that Hillary was selling classified info to the Saudi's by way of Huma.
10 | Josh Thompson | 6 | 1337434306352818_1337474096348839 | Good God... the polling at the moment has very little impact from the email thing - forgetting the YouGov poll showing very little apparent changes, PPP saying they're not detecting much. I expect this lack of context from the Australian press, who don't seem to understand... but MSNBC, really?
11 | Elizabeth Amanda Elgin | 1 | 1337434306352818_704778739687529 | Regardless of what Comey did and why, there is NO WAY there is enough data available in reliable polls at this point to make this headline true.  And you should not underestimate how pissed off Hillary voters are right now and therefore will turn out in droves. If there was any complacency setting in, this turned it around. #NEVERTRUMP
12 | Toni Albin | 10 | 1337434306352818_1337500186346230 | They can call these HRC emails when they were on Huma Abedin's laptop??? I'm beginning to think Comey should be called Crooked Comey! This is a sad time in our history‚òπÔ∏è
13 | Giovanni Moretti | 19 | 1337434306352818_1337466929682889 | This was a deliberate action on the part of comey to try to derail Hillary's campaign and its working to some extent but we know its a political move ...we wont let trump win #voteblue
14 | Tina Waters | 7 | 1337434306352818_1337543386341910 | Yeah because emails are far more criminal than a child rapist who admits to sexually assaulting women and evades paying taxes.What's actually criminal is the amount of tax dollars they have spent opening and reopening this investigation several times.
15 | Jesse Shilling | 2 | 1337434306352818_1337482756347973 | As somebody who already voted for Bernie Sanders in the general election(live in Vermont). You hill-bots  sound just as desperate as you did back in the primaries. I hope she gets indicted or gets her security clearance stripped and we end up with Tim for the next four years and then we have a real Progressive run against him as the incumbent.
16 | Thomas T. Panto | 2 | 1337434306352818_1337487236347525 | The ''WMD'' of America CONTINUESAfter decades of being LIED TO by the foreign corporate owned republicans, now, anyone who ignores their deeds and continues worshiping the republican religion is a stupid fool.
17 | Michael Smith | 2 | 1337434306352818_1337491729680409 | At this point why would Hilary still want to be president? If shes elected she will still be under FBI investigation. Plus she will get absolutly nothing she wants done because Republicans will have a majority in Congress and will make her life a living hell. I see her having a stroke in 6 months.
18 | Chris Esry | 2 | 1337434306352818_1337465989682983 | This poll sample 37 percent Democrat, 28 percent Republican and 30 percent independent and only 1 day of the 3 days it was done was after the FBI announcement. I think we may see Trump break the 1980 Ronald Reagan record of 44 states.
19 | Michele Barone Berry | 2 | 1337434306352818_704734786358591 | 22 million Bush Cheney emails missing$9 billion lostWheres the rage?Republican dont investigate themselves. Thats why this nation is a mess.Republicans who cant win on issues will cause more chaos for this nation. Republicans are running this show.Clean House 2016
20 | Marie Jackson | 1 | 1337434306352818_897635543669996 | Newsweek: "Over the course of decades, Donald Trump‚Äôs companies have destroyed or hidden thousands of emails, records and documents demanded in official proceedings, often in defiance of court orders." And no tax returns. The FBI should go after that jerk.
21 | Julie Brown | 4 | 1337434306352818_1337533969676185 | The election has been compromised by the FBI. Comey has had a grudge against the Clintons since he was the prosecutor on the White Water investigation way back when Bill Clinton was president. He is totally biased against Hilary Clinton. He is like all misogynistic men who seek to keep their heel in the neck of women in general. He violated the Hatch Act that prohibits Federal employees from interfering in politics. And most especially a presidential election. Don't know if he will be brought up on any charges for this or not. He is a lawyer so perhaps not. It is, to me, a blatant act to defeat the only sane candidate for president. Trump looks like he has some kind of dementia problem he can't remember from one day to the next what he said. So he lies and says he didn't say that. Clear indicators of something very wrong with his brain. Something should happen to Comey that he will not like. Looks like he was paid off by someone to defy the Justice Department in sending this letter to Republicans in the house. He will be out of his cushy job if Hilary is elected. Trump may have paid him big money in a Cayman Islands account for his retirement fund. The Justice Department should look at that possibility.
22 | Shane Snyder | 1 | 1337434306352818_1337575789672003 | "The best thing would be for Democrats to ask her to step down now. It would be the most responsible thing to do, if the nation were more important to them than power. And the American news media ‚Äî fairly or not firmly identified in the public mind as Mrs. Clinton's political action committee ‚Äî should begin demanding it."http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/columnists/kass/ct-hillary-clinton-emails-kass-1030-20161028-column.html
23 | Cecilia St Laurent Toulouse | 0 | 1337434306352818_704812786350791 | In July Comey announced the findings that Hillary was innocent of wrong doing but gave us all his opinion. Due to the fact that he is the FBI Director and supposed to be bi-partisan, that was out of line. We should question why he did that. For who's benefit. And now he pulls this stunt. Obviously he is obligated to do what he can for the right for some reason.  He needs to be fired.
24 | Mark Rush | 0 | 1337434306352818_704743266357743 | I see MSNBC is back at it with these poll scare tactics, well the only poll that counts is the one on November 8,2016. All indications are is that early voting is going very well for Democrats and these are real votes casted.
25 | Andrew Teal | 0 | 1337434306352818_897559700344247 | Talk about an October surprise. Nothing of substance produced by someone who is legally obligated not to entangle justice and elections, which still ended up causing massive damage after millions of early votes have been cast.

3 | John Sakelos | 129 | 721651201333241_722877794543915 | Oh Liz, you wannabe Native American -- your little tantrums aren't working. The Democrats are so used to getting away with corruption and murder. Literally. Now that the tables are turning, they are portraying themselves as the victims‚Ä¶ Pathetic. I predict it has to do with the Clinton Foundation. If this is the case, Hillary is done. Thank God for Wikileaks, the FBI, and as much as I hate to say it, Anthony Wiener.
4 | Chaz Pacific | 124 | 721651201333241_722879884543706 | Just came from a Trump Rally in ABQ, NM. There had to be several several thousand people there. Everyone was super nice too.
5 | Chris Konces | 89 | 721651201333241_722886444543050 | I know it sucks and I'm not trying to rub anyone's face in it, but you Dems should be pissed as hell. Not at Trump, but Hilary Clinton. You put all your faith in someone who you believed in, I get it. But open your eyes...you have been duped by a common criminal. Be pissed,  but be pissed at YOUR candidate who lied to you, and even her own inner circle.
6 | Kyle Sisemore | 80 | 721651201333241_722876471210714 | I think she meant Hillary. Trump isn't the one under investigation again due to her poor choices.
7 | Sheila Hollan Gabbard | 72 | 721651201333241_722879284543766 | Don't believe the media...Hillary's poll numbers are falling faster than Bill Clinton's pants in an Arkansas trailer park..üòÇ
8 | Sandra Marv | 34 | 721651201333241_722881257876902 | I'd rather have a candidate for president that didn't use a properly secured email server than someone who sexually assaults women and children. This vague letter changes nothing. The GOP is on a wild goose chase to try to deflect off their sexual predator of a candidate. I trust Hillary more with emails than I do Trump with the nuclear codes.

10 | Carol Ross | 21 | 721651201333241_722881134543581 | I can't agree w/ her enough, as Trumpet besides a lot of other things, is heavily in debt w/ no place this time for somebody to bail him out & pay it for him, so he's after us to do it for him!!!  Talk about a 'CON' artist who's nothing but cheap talk & never keeps his word about anything, let alone ever practices what he preaches!!!!  Don't believe me, just ask Scotland what he did to them!!!  And now he's suing them because he couldn't get his way there like he gets away with in the states!!!!  He's quite a character w/ a 'really' bad history of doing business for the last 30-40 yrs, plus a lot of it w/ the Russians!!!  He even still has a couple of Russian immigrants on his staff, nor is Paul Manafort actually out of the picture!!!!  In fact he lives in Trumpet's beach house in New Jersey!!!
11 | Richard S. Simon | 19 | 721651201333241_722916477873380 | How did this happen to our country? A man with multiple mental disorders, a sexual predator, a man with no real plans, a man without a soul, a man with no conscience, a man with a foul mind and foul mouth,,, how did this man get this far???? Unbelievable.
12 | Cody Villeneuve | 9 | 721651201333241_1840270409536752 | Hillary says people under FBI investigation shouldn't qualify to own a gun ....but it's okay for them to run for president?!?Hillary says that Trump's charges thee election is rigged makes him a foolNext sentence out of her crooked smile is saying the FBI & Russia are rigging the election ?!?Elizabeth Warren sold out all her followers the day she indorsed WALL STREETS CANDIDATE
13 | Bryan Nugent | 3 | 721651201333241_722905664541128 | Beware Hillary's useful idiots plan:1) Healthcare ‚Äì Control healthcare and you control the people.2) Poverty ‚Äì Increase the poverty level as high as possible; poor people are easier to control and will not fight back if you are providing everything for them to live.3) Debt ‚Äì Increase the debt to an unsustainable level. That way you are able to increase taxes and this will produce more poverty.4) Gun control ‚Äì Remove people‚Äôs ability to defend themselves from the government. That way you are able to create a police state.5) Welfare ‚Äì Take control of every aspect of people‚Äôs lives (food, housing and income).6) Education ‚Äì Take control of what people read and listen to; take control of what children learn in school.7) Religion ‚Äì Remove the belief in God from the government and schools.8) Class warfare ‚Äì Divide the people into the wealthy and the poor. This will cause more discontent and it will be easier to take from (tax) the wealthy with the support of the poor.
14 | Samantha Hartwell | 54 | 721651201333241_722874891210872 | Is Trump seriously just now realizing his supporters are a bunch of window-licking water heads? Donald, you are talking to the craziest people in the country.

17 | Annie Des | 8 | 721651201333241_1336232239742893 | Sooo... It's not ok for Donald Trump to call Hillary a nasty woman, but Elizabeth Warren can call him a sleazeball? Hypocrite
18 | Tammy Clark Broughton | 3 | 721651201333241_1840474502849676 | To everyone who thinks this is Donald J. Trump's fault ,this crap was going on long before he even decided to run for President ,this is a mess of the DNC's on making and they should have never allowed Clinton to run ,Trump beat out 16 opponents ,and the DNC could only find 2 ? and had to cheat to beat Bernie
19 | John Grzeskiewicz | 2 | 721651201333241_1840416126188847 | That's it...resort to name calling. Haha Trump has put the whole lot of you crooks on notice. Now you don't know what to do. Good for all of you. The American working class are fed up with all of you as well. Good luck finding a job when Trump is elected.
20 | Nola Hennessy | 4 | 721651201333241_722895767875451 | Shouldn't her constituents be embarrassed that she's name-calling instead of behaving like an adult? God help the US Senate (and all Americans) if this is the acceptable standard for US Senators.
21 | Adrienne Cole | 6 | 721651201333241_722895607875467 | If Trump's child rape case, his sexually assaulting women comments, and the billion other things that he's said and done, haven't done him in, no foundation ANYTHING will dampen HRC's chances. If you think so, your just as delusional as Melania.

Also the FBI Weiner team briefed Comey and Comey assessed that there was substantial weight towards hillary's espionage to re initiate the case, which was never closed, because there has been no verdict and the statute of limitations has not lapsed.

Nathan | 162 | 1337142269715355_1337142526381996 | The only real scandal in this election is Trump still refusing to release his tax returns thus keeping voters totally in the dark about his financial affairs & he getting ready for the Trump university fraud trial.Of course he treats women in the most demeaning way
2 | John Sakelos | 91 | 1337142269715355_1337143293048586 | Yupp. Hillary Clinton sure made that mistake this election. The Democrats are so used to getting away with corruption and murder. Literally. Now that the tables are turning, they are portraying themselves as the victims‚Ä¶ Pathetic. I predict it has to do with the Clinton Foundation. If this is the case, Hillary is done. Thank God for Wikileaks, the FBI, and as much as I hate to say it, Anthony Wiener.
3 | Columbus Omorisiefe | 43 | 1337142269715355_1337160906380158 | I think President Obama should worry more for himself regarding the FBI investigations about Hillary's emails. I see him getting caught in the web and his reputation going up in smoke...
4 | Bob Caparillo | 39 | 1337142269715355_1337143443048571 | Obama is praying, and praying hard on his rug that he doesn't get caught in the Clinton's second Weiner gate.
5 | Sheila Hollan Gabbard | 40 | 1337142269715355_1337148756381373 | Don't believe the media...Hillary's poll numbers are falling faster than Bill Clinton's pants in an Arkansas trailer park...üòÇ
6 | Chris Esry | 15 | 1337142269715355_1337216253041290 | It's so clear that the corruption goes all the way up to Obama. I can't believe that a small percentage of people are still supporting the Clintons and their corruption. Knowing that they have robbed and  caused the death of thousands of Haitians, Africans and middle eastern people. It's really sick to see Americans support this corruption because they are so blinded by their ideology.
7 | Frank Herbage | 12 | 1337142269715355_1337167556379493 | What some people allege Clinton has done. Does not in any way compare to the things that Trump has actually done. People need to realize that they are being manipulated by the Republican party. Who have lost all sense of decency. The one thing to never lose sight of, is that Trump must never be our President. It would be a total disaster for our country. From the very first day of his primary campaign, he has been a disgrace to our country. He has lived in the gutter all his life, and he has taken our Presidential campaign into it as well. There is a reason that he will lose every state from Maine to N.Carolina, to Penslyvania. This is his home terrritory. But the North East know him for the trash he is. Future generations will curse anyone who voted for him......

9 | Eric Hazlett | 6 | 1337142269715355_1337244956371753 | Wikileaks is doing the job the mainstream media refuses to. There is no real journalism anymore, it's all political pandering and propaganda...Wake up people. Stop blaming the source of the information and actually look at the content! Hillary violated the law. She risked National Security because she wanted a private server to hide her communications! She's corrupt to the core and bought and paid for by wall street... You idiots voting for this woman need a major wakeup call.
10 | Kevin Harris | 1 | 1337142269715355_1337459403016975 | I will vote for Hillary Clinton because I believe she is qualified for the job. However, Mrs. Clinton and her staff have no one to point fingers at but themselves.  Clinton's paranoia and need for control led her to this place coupled with her obvious sloppy staff. If Hillary would have followed protocol and used the government server she wouldn't be in this mess. It was not a mistake as Mrs. Clinton says. It was deliberate and willful and now with the Democrats having a chance to seize both houses has been derailed and America has another Congress that will do nothing but say no to the middle class. Thanks Mrs. Clinton for following the advice of your husband.  Find him something to do but keep Bill Clinton out of politics.
11 | Carol Lijoi | 14 | 1337142269715355_1337144699715112 | As to the continued noise of witch hunts. Remember when many said "what if there was a war and no  one went"?  Well for election 2016 - What if the GOP invented a scandal and no one noticed?
12 | Jan Kobus | 8 | 1337142269715355_1337212359708346 | The Clinton campaign is a sinking ship! If by a miracle she did win this election, her first several months would involve her being under investigation and ultimately criminally charged!

14 | Idelisses Medina Torres | 3 | 1337142269715355_1337288453034070 | I wonder if president Obama is embarrassed that, the FBI reopened the Clinton investigation? And now he has to talk through that egg all over his face.
15 | Dwayne Flaherty | 6 | 1337142269715355_1337175916378657 | Obama has been the worst leader this nation has had the misfortune of having. Thankfully in a couple of months he and his administration will be nothing but a horrid memory and Trump can begin fixing the destruction obama has done.

19 | Cody Villeneuve | 1 | 1337142269715355_1337275513035364 | Under investigation by the FBI in Obama world makes you "the most qualified candidate for president ever" 8 more days until he finds out thats false, it just makes you a criminal
20 | George Pauls | 3 | 1337142269715355_1337164589713123 | Hey Obama! When are you going to keep your promises to the Standing Rock Sioux Nation and the rest of the Native Americans that you said you would support? Keeping your word is more important than politics and right now you are looking like a liarSo if you can't keep this promise then the rest of your words are as meaningless as Clinton or Trumps - nice legacy you are building
21 | Donna Wright | 1 | 1337142269715355_1337546396341609 | It was up to each state to participate in the part of ACA that would have helped her. Florida, like my state of Idaho, preferred to make a politic statement against Obama and not adopt this part of Obamacare, leaving her with no options. These states care less about their people and more about keeping huge corporations and insurance lobbyists happy. If you want it to change, you need a different governor and state legislature.
22 | Michael Richardson | 7 | 1337142269715355_1337149503047965 | Please just go away, you have cost us so much. I let go of 77% of my people under your stupid pen and phone crap. I do not beleive I would have ever comented about a president of the United States this way but I feel you are a trater, are out to do somthing bad and use smoke and mirrors to make some feel good. I am sick and tired of seeing and hearing you speak, again, please go away!
23 | Jason Bridges | 8 | 1337142269715355_1337163316379917 | Even now dems are crowing that she's already won. And the investigation is "inconvenient"? God save us from this vile woman and her mindless followers
24 | Polin B Jimenez | 1 | 1337142269715355_1337219379707644 | Remember: a vote for Hillary is a vote against racism, bigotry, and  misogyny. We cannot let a rapist and sexual predator into the White House. Trump faces trials in November for fraud and December for raping a 13 year old. Is that who you want as President? No matter what you think about Hillary, she's not a rapist or racist.
25 | John Vaughn | 0 | 1337142269715355_1337187556377493 | That is so right because, COMPLACENCY ("Oh she's ahead by x-amount of points, no need to worry") VOTING will surely make us the losers in this foot race. Please, please, please, please. DO NOT FORGET that there are Congressional and Senatorial races taking place this cycle. I know every one of us want to be a part of the historical aspect of it all, but remember, that forgetting these other elections is what scuttled many items on President Obama's "Hope and Change" list, and the #GOPerversionParty #DisposablesInAHandbasket only wish to repeal and obstruct.

Your not happy unless your telling others what to do.   We'll do what we want, so sit down and shut the h up.   Halloween is so you can express yourself however you want if you don't like it lock yourself in you liberal safe space and don't go out on the 31st.
2 | Ricky Taylor | 35 | 1187195981355640_1189589417782963 | What kind of person sends trouble makers to another candidates rally for the sole purpose of causing trouble? Hillary is pure scum!!!!
3 | Pat Fagan Reiser | 8 | 1187195981355640_1189607994447772 | I'm wondering why MSNBC has had Trump rallies and speeches on all weekend (along with CNN). You should have pulled in Andrea Mitchell for interviews and commentary, she would just about have finished off any respect your network has left for me...if it weren't for Rachel and Lawrence, I would have just given up and turned off the tv.
4 | Dean Felix | 0 | 1187195981355640_1190347151040523 | For those of you who wonder why so many of us are voting for Trump- I think this sums it up pretty good! For What It's Worth Department:                                        The Media just doesn‚Äôt get it....they can't believe that people are so angry     that they can no longer be manipulated!  Millions of trump supporters feel this way about Donald J. Trump.....We don't care if the guy swears... or how many times he's been married...or who he voted for, or what his income tax return shows. We want the problems fixed. Yes, he's an egomaniac, but we don't care. We know he's not a racist, or all the other things the liberal media is trying to label him with. We know he's raised a good family, and that says a lot about him.The country is a mess because politicians suck, the Republican Party is two faced & gutless, and illegals are everywhere and Muslims are openly trying to hurt this country and make the civilized world adjust to them. We want it all fixed!We don't care that Trump is crude, we don't care that he has changed positions, we don't care that he fights with Megan Kelly, Rosie O'Donnell, and so many of the elected establishment. We don't care that Rubio, Ryan, the Bush's, and so many other top old and new Republicans refuse to endorse him for their own selfish reasons, and we know what they are. We don't care that he doesn't know the name of some Muslim terrorists, we don't care that he tried some businesses that didn't work out.This country is weak, bankrupt, our enemies are making fun of us, we are being invaded by illegals, we are becoming a nation of victims, where every Tom, Ricardo and Hasid is a special group with special rights to a point where we don't even recognize the country we were born and raised in, AND WE JUST WANT IT FIXED. And TRUMP is the only guy who seems to understand what the people want.We're sick of politicians, sick of the Democratic and Republican Party. We're angry about the Iran deal, the budget, treatment of Israel, military weakness, lobbyists, special interests, overpaid politicians with their self serving bills and back room deals, trade deals, loss of jobs, manipulated economic numbers, businesses fleeing, and even the phony pay for play Clinton Foundation.Americans are no longer going to be fooled, and the movement is out to change the direction we're taking. Trump may not be a saint, but he doesn't have lobbyist money holding him, he doesn't have political correctness restraining him, and all you know is that he has been very successful, a good negotiator, he has built a lot of things, he's flexible, and he's also not a politician. And he says he'll fix it. And we believe him because he is too much of an egotist to be proven wrong or looked at and called a liar.Public service has become elected greed. This may be our only chance to have a non-politician, despite his flaws, try and correct the mess, at least for 4 years. We must take the shot, because the consequences of putting Hillary Clinton in office are frightening. There is a tidal wave happening, and it's going to overcome much of what's happened to this country.
5 | Patrick Michael | 6 | 1187195981355640_1189600337781871 | I remember there was a guy classmate of mine in 5th grade that chose to dress up as a girl for Halloween. The entire class laughed at him and he ended up crying in the bathroom and went home early because he was so embarrassed. Sadly I was in on laughing at him but now I could care less. If you're an adult who cares how another person lives their lives, congratulations, you have the same mindset as children except a lot more hateful.

21 | Bobby McKinley | 0 | 1187195981355640_1189591521116086 | I'm certain that I will get alot of backlash and negative feedback for what I'm about to say, but it has to be said.Throughout this entire election process there has been alot of casualties cause in part by the Media and some self inflicted. One in particular is Bill Clinton, Bill Clinton prior to Hill/Billarys stubborn attempt to become the 45th PotUSA was in my opinion going to go down in history as one of the three greatest President's ever. The first being George Washington for fighting to give us this great country. The second being John F Kennedy for defending our great nation without even having to fire a shot by staring down the Russian's as they were moving into Cuba. The third being Bill Clinton for giving us economic growth after being seated with a declining economic which projected us into a semi recession caused by George W Bush Sr. I am fully aware of Bill's infidelities while in office, but at the time of what was going on with the economy and the lack of jobs when he stepped into the White House and the way he grab the bull by the horns and detoured our economy from going into a full fledged recession was greatly shadowed by his later indiscretion. Since Hill/Billary made the decision to run for office, she had to know what this was going to do to Bill's dignity(or what he had left) and how it was going to smash and dedicate all over her own husbands legacy without any regard to what or how it was going to affect him. Here lately everytime I see him on TV, he comes off a being an abused dog with his tale between his leg's suffering from dementia. Sad that she would even sacrifice her own family member (husband) to feed her sick delusion of becoming the next PotUSA.

Kiss your healthcare good bye because you wont be able to afford it, Good chance of kissing your job good bye when she starts TPP and opens the borders. Kiss your safety good buy when she allows 500k people in the country from the middle east. Kiss your family and friends good bye when she send them to the middle east to die. After all you didn't think the middle east gave her 25 million dollars out of the kindness of their hearts.

13 | Joe Doodian | 4 | 1337071473055768_1337109406385308 | A former top FBI official blasted Hillary and Bill Clinton on Sunday as the heads of an influence-peddling "crime family" rife with corruption and deceit.James Kallstrom, the head of the FBI's New York City office in the mid-90s, said the bureau's reopening of its probe into Clinton's private email server confirmed that the former secretary of state was never subject to a "real investigation" in the first place."The Clintons, that's a crime family. It's like organized crime. The Clinton Foundation is a cesspool ... It's just outrageous how Hillary Clinton sold her office for money. She's a pathological liar," Kallstrom railed

22 | Belinda Tanner | 3 | 1337071473055768_1337079873054928 | FBI Director James Comey caught admitting he knew his letter would create a ‚Äúmisleading impression‚Äù‚ÄúEven as FBI Director James Comey was sending a letter to Congress that he knew would become public, he also privately sent a different letter to members of his own staff. Hours later, now that Comey‚Äôs public letter has been exposed as intentionally misleading and has created a firestorm of public and legal backlash against him that will almost certainly cost him his job, it turns out Comey privately admitted that he was fully aware his public letter would mislead the public.‚ÄùComey‚Äôs letter sent to Congress created the false impression that the FBI was reopening its long-ago-finished investigation into Hillary Clinton‚Äôs emails, for which she has already been fully exonerated. Comey made a point of failing to admit that this new investigation is actually into the behavior of former Congressman Anthony Weiner, which the media subsequently dug up on its own. Now that CNN is calling on Comey to resign from the FBI, and MSNBC is outright accusing him of intentionally trying to rig a Presidential election, his private letter to FBI employees essentially serves as a confession of guilt.‚ÄúGiven that we don‚Äôt know the significance of this newly discovered collection of emails, I don‚Äôt want to create a misleading impression,‚Äù James Comey wrote in a private letter to his staff just before he released his public letter. ‚ÄúIn trying to strike that balance, in a brief letter and in the middle of the election season, there is significant risk of being misunderstood.‚ÄùIn so doing, FBI Director James Comey admitted in his own words that he was fully aware that ‚Äúa brief letter and in the middle of the election season‚Äù would likely cause the ‚Äúmisleading impression‚Äù he had referenced. This now leaves Comey no ground for claiming that he didn‚Äôt know his letter to Congress would sabotage the Presidential election. This hands House Democrats the smoking gun they‚Äôve been looking for, in terms of forcing out of office.

Eric Garner didn't make the cut because he wasn't shot. Sad part is Eric Garner was the one who was only selling untaxed cigarettes, his daughter is not supporting Hillary. They chose Michael Brown to use, a thug who had just committed strong armed robbery attacked a cop and tried to take his gun and died because the cop was defending himself. But Eric Garner was the one who didn't fit Hillarys criteria

17 | Steven Akin | 0 | 1550076338345724_1552222904797734 | I sent this info to a Friend here on Facebook... So, since I typed a book, I thought I would share it with everyone: ;).... The Feds own about 28% of the country in USA..... Yet, the Govt. demands to bring in 3rd world country folks that are very low educated, no money, and shady criminal history too.. and expect the Citizens to take on this burden. ..The Govt even wants to dictate to Property Owners who they should or shouldn't rent their properties to, etc....Why doesn't the Gov. open up some of that 28% land if they feel the People should be so giving out of their own pockets? It's like our Govt has a huge sign at the Borders saying, "Are you a loser in your own poor and disgusting country? No worries, come to USA and we will gladly and foolishly hold your hand forever!" .. I used to do some work for Dept of Labor. (DoL manages Job Corps and Peace Corps too.) These two programs are really seriously outdated and no longer necessary assets to this country. Job Corps actually occupies quite a few acres too. It costs the U.S. Gov billions every year to keep these two programs operable. Actually, they should totally close down these programs and turn the land over to private interests and use those billions to patrol our border and other things. The end result value of Job Corps and Peace Corps is extremely low.. I have also done work for Dept of Defense. DoD has programs for the military and their families that really need streamlined and cutting of the pork. In turn, DoD could utilize those saved funds to strengthen the military in other areas without extra expense to the taxpayers... Our current Govt has totally dropped the ball in so many areas that are so obvious even to a layman. When a layman such as myself can walk into these departments and quickly spot the obvious, that says the Govt is seriously failing everyone. I guess Edward Snowden can relate to what I am saying.... I have also done work for USAA in San Antonio. Many people think that USAA is somehow linked to the U.S. Govt. (They are NOT, they are no different than State Farm Ins. or Farmers, or AllState, etc. but the exception for USAA is, they choose to gear their business specially for Active Military, Vets, and their families. .. USAA in San Antonio have 20,000 workers onsite. .. 5,000 of those workers are H1-B, mostly from India... USAA prefers not to allow the Indians to man the phones for Customer Service etc. because they do not want the general public to hear their accents, etc. ..USAA is NOT a branch of our government or military! USAA makes billions in profits waving around a lot of flags and eagles and running millions of dollars of ads...They want you to believe they are patriots and make you think they are attached to our Government... Again, they are NOT........Well anyway, if all H1-Bs that are currently working in the U.S. were sent back to their home country, that will automatically and immediately open up at least 1 million good paying high Tech jobs to U.S. citizens in the U.S. Over the years, USA has directly or indirectly sent many billions (maybe even trillions) of dollars to India. If it were not for the shared U.S. technology and dollars given away, everyone in India would still be driving a camel to work everyday. Instead, the Govt. has felt it is better to put their own Citizens out of work in lieu of helping 3rd world countries advance... Go figure. (Rolling eyes) .. .... You see, one way Trump has proposed that Mexico will pay for the wall is, all funds being transferred from this Country into Mexico have a specific tariff applied and then will be added to border security funds. Hence, Mexicans paying for the wall with NO COST to the U.S. .. It's a no-brainer... As I am an average Citizen of this country, I just outlined plans to create more than a million jobs practically immediately, save billions from leaving this country practically immediately, have Mexico pay for the wall practically immediately (think of it like a tollway highway for money transfers), how to restrict billions from leaving this country practically immediately, how to streamline government agencies (including the military) practically immediately, how to give the Citizens more flexibility for growth in the way our lands are being managed... Trump can and will do these things... The only thing Clintons will do is continue putting hundreds of millions into their own onshore and offshore accounts. If Clinton is elected, we are handing over the keys to Ft. Knox to them with no challenge. If Clinton is elected, by the end of her term the Clintons will be Billionaires if not multi-billionaires.... Trump has already stated he will not take any paycheck from government for being President. ... What Trump desires to do is analyze the money flow to all countries outside of America to see what we are getting for our money return and see if it's a good investment or fair deal.. If not, I feel very confident he will pull that plug. ..... Would any competent business person run their own business differently??http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2271455/Revealed-How-immigrants-America-sending-120-BILLION-struggling-families-home.htmlFew minds will stir when they learn that the US federal government owns a grand total of 640 million acres of land: that figure is so vast that it becomes meaningless. The sum of all that acreage adds up to about 28% of the nation's total surface, 2.27 billion acres.

4 | Christina Kook | 354 | 1337005169729065_1337009936395255 | The best gift Democrats can give to Republicans is to defeat them soundly and take back the Senate at a minimum. "Our system would then be returned to balance, and the public trust in our government would be restored. A landslide defeat of Trump would not only dispatch with a dangerous demagogue, but it would also go a long way toward restoring the proper functioning of our democracy."

(At least for the next 4 years)
18 | Elaine Beach | 19 | 1337005169729065_1337029926393256 | Some people are sooooo stupid that they actually think because the FBI came out with more E-mails at the urging of the Republican candidate that we would just magically change our minds and pick that fool!!! Now lets switch it. If some how they had video and/ or voice recording of Donald Trump raping/ molesting  a woman or child then the conservatives would most definitely change their votes to Hillary, I'm convinced of that! I don't think so, so why in the HELL would the conservatives think that of us?
19 | Ken Crawshaw | 15 | 1337005169729065_1502236713136519 | The FBI would legally be required to obtain a second Search and Seizure Warrant to investigate anything about Clinton.  If they did not do that, if the FBI uncovered anything, it would be considered inadmissible in a court of law.  The Search and Seizure Warrant is a formality, and certainly not an indication that they have uncovered anything incriminating.
20 | Lori Bird | 20 | 1337005169729065_1337024753060440 | I also do not care nor do I think it should have happened prior to the election.Hillary is the fittest in every way to be President!#I'mWithHer
21 | Alene Bynum | 9 | 1337005169729065_998628716914372 | This is in regard to Weiners email on his and his wife's laptop. Since they both used the laptop the FBI would rightly check out to see if his wife shared classified information. However, this investigation should have token place sooner before the election. It has the appearance of trying to influence the election. I'm in favor of FBI doing their jobs concerning both candidates. I'm not in favor of having public investigations that influence an election when there is no evidence of foul play yet.
22 | Debbie Browning | 14 | 1337005169729065_1337031713059744 | People get a clue!!! If you break the law, you should be penalized!  Don't break the law if you don't want   Repercussion!  She is NOT above the law. No one is!
23 | Cindy Stiles Foster | 18 | 1337005169729065_1337026009726981 | Let me see if I understand: Hillary Clinton did not put all the evidences on the table, when she received the subpoena from the authorities to turn all the emails. Instead she decided to destroy 33 thousand emails. But now she is comanding the investigators to put all their evidences on the table, before the investigations are completed? Queen of Corruption
24 | Robin Soma Dudley | 3 | 1337005169729065_998671683576742 | Funny- when I heard what Comey wrote, I thought it better not be politically motivated because it could be a violation of the Hatch Act. It certainly seems on the edge.
25 | Tony Brown | 4 | 1337005169729065_1502237803136410 | I hate these FBI and these pathetic criminals! They are the criminals that should be locked up! Hillary has my support and my vote. I am no puppet and I am not swayed by white corrupt nonsense once again.

The man, wearing a "Hillary for prison" t-shirt, repeatedly yelled "Jew-S-A!" at journalists even as he stood next to a child at the campaign event in Phoenix.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Laura Hoey | 573 | 1336987586397490_1336990256397223 | What a lovely man. One might say, deplorable. And as of this morning, KelleyAnne Conway agrees that Trump has his Deplorables. Nice when it comes from inside the campaign its self.
2 | Steve Vann | 304 | 1336987586397490_1793767984246314 | I've noticed that a lot of Trump supporters seem to despise the Jews along with gays, blacks, Latinos, Muslims, Independent women, Hillary and Obama. But they all love Jesus. lol
3 | Danielle Ream Brown | 176 | 1336987586397490_1336996843063231 | The surrounding Trump supporters are looking at him like he's an idiot. They seem oblivious to the fact that the rest of the country looks at them the same way. This is so sad and so scary.
4 | Nir Chen | 111 | 1336987586397490_1336988633064052 | Well, i'm a Jew and I think this article is stupid. One voter does not represent an entire population. Some Hillary voters from the democrat party support "palestinian" terrorism.. It doesn't mean most democrats does. Only a few bunch of them.
5 | Artimis Virvos | 71 | 1336987586397490_1337016236394625 | And don't talk to me about foreign terrorists when we have our very own home grown terrorist leader named Donald Trump with his millions of koolaid followers!!!! That scares the hell out of me, they are here!!! NOW!!!!
6 | Shala Sanders | 72 | 1336987586397490_1793767584246354 | How can a man " Make America Great Again " when his campaign brings out the WORST of America?!P.S.America is already great and we want to continue to make it better
7 | Robin Lee Goldenberg-Riddell | 50 | 1336987586397490_1337002293062686 | Wow! Of course I recognize there is anti Semitism around the world, I've encountered it personally upon occasion BUT NEVER do I remember a presidential election where one candidate blatantly exhibited as well as attracted such!
8 | Rick Davis | 58 | 1336987586397490_1337001859729396 | This is the kind of people he energizes without any clear and harsh condemnation of this type of hate sick rhetoric which is permeates deep into Republican party. This man is a modern A H
9 | Danny Gebhardt | 41 | 1336987586397490_1337002059729376 | And of course, all Trump and his supporters had to do with the FBI letter was stay focused and stay quiet and ride it out, and they somehow managed to screw it up and change the narrative with their crazy.  GOP needs an overhaul after the election.  This is embarrassing, and dare I say, deplorable.
10 | Joanne Hredzak Gibson | 39 | 1336987586397490_1337003626395886 | Hillary For Prison, hanging Hillary in effigy, "lock her up", this example of a bigot. It is all encouraged by Trump. Shouting at the media and fights breaking out at the rallies. They truly are deplorable, low class, poorly educated people.
11 | Janeen Cox | 31 | 1336987586397490_1337011349728447 | He can't possible win. üòû I am at a loss for words. I'm spent. I can't believe everything that has gone on and everything they've done to Hillary. I'll be losing sleep until this madness is over
12 | Gloria Springer | 26 | 1336987586397490_1337022229727359 | We must stop this madness and Vote blue all the way my friend in London say the people over there laughing at us say we have a clown run for president wake up America don't let this's fool run this country to the ground
13 | Janay King | 29 | 1336987586397490_1337000939729488 | As we run into this final stretch in the 2016 vote, I wanted to make a post that helps to keep people on target since this is such an important election. Let‚Äôs think about the recent Brexit vote that is forcing the United Kingdom to exit the European Union, for a moment. In that vote, people made a protest vote against staying in the Union because they didn‚Äôt think that it would really happen. The Result, many Millennial Voters desperately want to take their vote back, saying that they were not being serious. In the 1980‚Äôs Carter was up by 8 points in the polls, people did not come out to vote because they thought that he had it beat. In the 2000 election, people were not thrilled about Al Gore, thinking that he was too much of a bore, and not a strong candidate. Many Liberals voted for Ralph Nader instead of Al Gore, and handed George Bush Jr. a razor thin victory that resulted in a disastrous 8 years. Listen People, I understand that it really looks like Hillary has this all sewn up. Trust me when I say that she doesn‚Äôt. It is not over until the last vote is counted.  She may not be your candidate that you are willing to stand on railroad tracks to get elected, she may not be your perfect choice for President, BUTIf history tells us anything, it is that we should never take anything for granted. This election needs to be won by Hillary Clinton. It is not enough to say that Hillary Needs to be President, but that she needs to win by such a huge margin so we never have to see Trump, or anyone like Trump, on the ballot ever again. We need to retake Congress. We need to vote blue for all Congressmen and Senators so we can retake the House and Senate. We need to put a stop to this crazy Republican right wing insanity that has gripped our government for years because of blind racism and stupidity. Get out there, Vote, get your Friends and Family to vote. Stop the insanity!!!!
14 | Terri Joyce-Kincaid | 12 | 1336987586397490_983004238488399 | This is a video and story about ONE man. Anytime there is a gathering of people you can have that one A$$hole. BUT it is the comments here by thousands that I find unbelievable. I have great fear that no matter which of these two end up in the White house our country will never be the same. Win or loss I do not see Mr. Trump doing anything to try and heal the wounds he has inflicted on this great county.
15 | Christopher Voshell | 7 | 1336987586397490_1337032786392970 | And this is part of the problem. Trump has whipped up such a frenzy of hate that this keeps happening. It's not acceptable and I would like to know if he was escorted out or is this a case of "oops did we do that?"
16 | Kyle Cruciger | 30 | 1336987586397490_1336994793063436 | This is the kind of trash that trumps campaign attracts. Sad part is, he really does represent most of his peers. I hope his parents are proud...
17 | Olayinka Adedapo | 9 | 1336987586397490_1337003733062542 | Anybody with brain will know just a day after Trump said cancel the election and give it to me and making reference to email will understand the conspiracy theory.
18 | Richard S. Simon | 5 | 1336987586397490_983050738483749 | I knew it was only a matter of time before Trump's deplorable parts would start to attack Jews. Jews are always a scapegoat for the simple minded.
19 | Nelson Armando | 5 | 1336987586397490_1337006566395592 | The Trump way is one of cultural insensitivity. I agree that we have to find a way to assist all those who feel left out with no voice in a political system that has left them out. But the way they are going at it is totally wrong. In this election, it is imperative we choose a candidate that to the extent that is possible, is all inclusive. Some of the jewish people I know, are great people, help others without asking for anything in return. They are some of the best efucators, doctors, professionals in every field, and contribute strongly to our economy. I feel sorry for this fellow acting in a way that is so devisive. How will his attitude contribute to make Ametica great?
20 | Andrea Morgan | 11 | 1336987586397490_1337031986393050 | He really meant to say....Trump the biased, bigoted, fraudulent, tax return-HIDING, sociopathic, psychopathic, ignorant, evil inhuman entity, offensive, heinous, irrational, unstable and unhinged, finger-pointing, conspiracy theory spreading, big talking, woman's private parts-grabbing, insecure, condescending, Pootin (Putin)-loving, dictator wannabe, chauvinistic, uncaring, dumb son of a sea cook..Chump for PRISON. What Trump the Skunk Chump fails to realize is that there are INTELLIGENT, reasonable, rational, common sense-using voters out here who will NOT allow his Unqualified Hiney near the White House.....they understand what's at stake here, and know that Trump the Monster Chump is not the answer. They know that Trump the Deplorable Chump is Dangerous and that this email "so-called" smoking gun, is a load of deflecting garbage. They know Trump, Chaffetz and Comey are the "three amigos" and somehow, they are all connected. Why did Trump mention Weiner and Huma before this occurred? Anybody wondering why, he would know to mention them at his rallies last week or whenever that was. He is NOT a psychic, he is a PSYCHO. There is definitely something "smelly" going on and it's all going to be exposed. None the less, Election Day will be the day, HRC is elected the 45th president of America, and rightfully so. Just saying...
21 | Karen Wilding | 6 | 1336987586397490_1278054095548047 | Trump supporters can't even admit that some of them are loose cannons! They always try to blame Hillary for everything! Apparently they're all perfect and well mannered! More proof of how dilusional and brain washed they are!!!
22 | Ann Sentman | 14 | 1336987586397490_1278043912215732 | Taking children to Trump rallies is irresponsible. They are exposed to hateful rhetoric such as this man is spewing. They hear bullying and harsh and suggestive language. Regretfully this campaign season has not provided role models for our children. Nine more days...
23 | Ed Sperandio | 16 | 1336987586397490_1337006343062281 | Yah and how much did this bonehead get paid by the dems to pull this? Its not like America hasn't found out all these instigators have been paid by dems. Love the idiots that still fall for it. Smfh
24 | EJ Perry | 11 | 1336987586397490_1793762737580172 | Trump supporters are insane. Like leader like followers. If Trump wins America's standing in the world will falter. This man and the Republican Party must be stopped.
25 | MarianoAnd Minnie Pavia | 9 | 1336987586397490_1793770844246028 | I thought that Hitler and the Kkk were dead and buried. But now that Trump is running for  president they have come alive again , that's the America that he wants to bring back , no thanks

--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Helene Mayer | 174 | 1550079121678779_1552073241479367 | She is using the candidate's own words. There is no slander, here. And, she is also expressing her point of view. That's freedom of speech. Very American. And, quite impressive for a Halloween "exhibit".
2 | Steven Brady | 63 | 1550079121678779_1552065538146804 | Wow she seems like a intelligent person... let's slander a presidential candidate... OK cool... liberals are okay to slander others. If a Republican does it... people like this cry... what a sad excuse for a American
3 | Carlos DeCarvalho | 38 | 1550079121678779_1552072464812778 | Hillary is throwing rocks at glass houses! She is the most corrupt politician in our history! Voters are voting stupidly! It's not about a woman president but honest, reliable and competent woman. She doesn't fit the bill! Her corruption makes her dangerous for America!
4 | Chris Nelson | 14 | 1550079121678779_1552301384789886 | A gentleman named Bill Howell eloquently wrote the below letter.Dear Mr. Trump,It‚Äôs taken me a while to realize this and to admit it, but I‚Äôm grateful to you.For the past few months I‚Äôve spent a good deal of time lamenting your campaign and the poison it has so effortlessly generated. I‚Äôve watched our country imploding, our public discourse become polluted, our political climate grows ever more corrosive, and wrongly assumed you were to blame.It‚Äôs only lately I‚Äôve come to understand that you haven‚Äôt manufactured our current national ugliness‚Äîyou‚Äôve simply revealed it.By saying the irresponsible, mean-spirited, ignorant things you say so freely and so frequently, you‚Äôve given other like-minded people license to do the same. You‚Äôve opened up the floodgates for our corporate sewage to flow fully. People no longer conceal their vile mess, they now revel in it, they broadcast it and retweet it.You‚Äôve made bigotry and racism socially acceptable again and that has been a kind of twisted gift because it‚Äôs allowed me to really see people; not as they pretend to be on the surface‚Äîbut in the very depths of their wounded, weaponized hearts.Over and over as your campaign has persisted, your supporters would tell me that they like you because you ‚Äúspeak your mind‚Äù. It wasn‚Äôt until recently that I‚Äôve realized that you speak their minds. You‚Äôve given credence to their prejudices and made those prejudices go mainstream.Thanks to the terrible ground you‚Äôve broken, politicians, pastors, friends, and strangers, both in person and on social media now regularly out themselves as hateful, intolerant, and malicious‚Äîand they remind me just how close they are to me, just how deep the sickness in us runs, and just how far we have to go together.You‚Äôve emboldened people to be open about things they used to conceal for the sake of decorum, and though it turns my stomach, I know that this is the only way we can move forward; to have that cancerous stuff exposed fully so that it can be dealt with. Our progress as a nation is predicated on authentic dialogue, no matter how brutal and disheartening that dialogue is.In other words, you‚Äôve let us know what we‚Äôre really dealing with here and while it‚Äôs been rightly disturbing, it‚Äôs also been revelatory. That‚Äôs the thing about that kind of harsh light: you‚Äôre forced to see everything. Beauty and monstrosity equally illuminated.Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, I think you‚Äôre the least qualified, least knowledgeable Presidential candidate we may ever have had participate this far into the process, and if you somehow were elected I‚Äôd fear gravely for the world my children would inherit‚Äîshould it survive your Presidency at all. I believe you‚Äôre reckless, bitter, and completely reprehensible; the very worst kind of bully.But whether you win or lose, you‚Äôve already allowed me the blessing of Truth; about me, about you, about other candidates, about our nation.And in the process you‚Äôve also shown me that I am not alone in resisting you and this ugly thing you‚Äôve revealed about us.You‚Äôve generated an equally loud, equally passionate response to it and this is where I find my hope these days.I find it in those for whom equality isn‚Äôt just a cheap buzzword, it‚Äôs the most precious of hills to die on.I find it in those people who refuse to be silent in the face of our impending shared regression.I find it in those willing to be bolder in defending the inherent value of all people.I find it in the growing army of those who will not tolerate hatred as a core American value.I find it in those who reject violence as our default response to dissension.I find it in the ever rising voice of people who will not let malice and bitterness represent them in the world.Today I find my hope in those who, like me, will not be complicit in allowing bigotry and intolerance to become a source of national pride, because we‚Äôve seen where that leads.Yes, Mr Trump, you‚Äôve unearthed our hidden sickness and you‚Äôve allowed it to go viral.You brought every awful thing about us out into the open.You will NEVER Get My Vote!
5 | Brandon Blake | 24 | 1550079121678779_1552084568144901 | BREAKING! BREAKING!William Thompson---Breaking News....!!!! CNN reports Clinton is now LEADING in the polls in important battleground states such as Qatar, Iraq, Iran, and Syria. And hopefully soon San Quentin.....!!!!
6 | Chelle Davis | 10 | 1550079121678779_1552142838139074 | The setting looks a lot like the Benghazi compound that Hillary left our brave soldiers and ambassador to die in..., no answer to that 3:00 AM call... but in Hillary's famous words, "what difference does it make?"
7 | Pat Calvin | 14 | 1550079121678779_1552120944807930 | I just love it !!! Funny how this video has pulled out a lot of the deplorables !! Just way to funny !! The deplorables want to dish out lies about Hillary, but can't take it when the truth comes out about dump . Wow Really üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
8 | Patrice West | 6 | 1550079121678779_1552104558142902 | Your so one sided shame on you . May the Lord forgive you for your false news. Your overwhelming short of such an evil person. Your selling your souls to the devil. God help you all.
9 | Djr Dwr | 5 | 1550079121678779_1552083988144959 | Another scary thought is women serving in the military. It's bad enought that they deal with sexual harrassment and disrespect within their own rank structure but if Trump wins, they have to worry about a Commander in Chief that also disrespect and sexually harass women.
10 | Patrice West | 4 | 1550079121678779_1552107958142562 | Everyone who feels her protecting child rapist not only in her career but in her marriage and wants evil assuage into our country. May the Lord be with you all. Not news sell your souls for the devil hurler Hilary
11 | Terri Hitchcock | 6 | 1550079121678779_1552077121478979 | Your. all a joke ! democrats only do for them self  that is the truth! I will expect the obama's care crap is what it is and coming out of my pocket not your or that theif Clinton clan !!
12 | Ted Kisselovich | 1 | 1550079121678779_1552194448133913 | Obviously a woman of limited imagination.... How about an ISIS dude sticking a bomb in a school bus... that's way more scary.... Hillary has ordered some of those from the Amazon refugee site.... they are out for delivery to your neighborhood.... oooooo scary
13 | David Wooten | 2 | 1550079121678779_1552198351466856 | Of course she used Trump for her display... If she had of tried to use Hillary for the display...All of the lies, scandals and people who committed "suicide" that Hillary tried to bury would have taken a yard the size of 2 or 3 football fields....
14 | Pam Ben | 9 | 1550079121678779_1552084348144923 | lol...yeah, Trump is way scarier than a President with a husband who is a rapist with an assistant who's husband is a pedophile........lmao, who cheats, murders, steals and is probably going to be in prison soon!
15 | Robert Rivera | 2 | 1550079121678779_1552171854802839 | Scary thing is she wants open boarders, 500% increase of Syrian refugees, Obama care, more second amendment restrictions, lies, corruption, scandal...
16 | Karen Bartsch | 3 | 1550079121678779_1552174938135864 | MSNBC when are you going to report on the alien abductions and people being taken hostage by bigfoot. Independent voters can tell the difference between NEWS and propaganda, and this is not NEWS.
17 | Jeanne Brooks-Miller | 0 | 1550079121678779_1552543438099014 | All the serious FBI things going on with one candidate & MSNBC chooses to report on something as trivial as this....that's their norm 1
18 | Jason B Smith | 2 | 1550079121678779_1552087598144598 | Its funny, but the hypocrisy of liberals is not, when republicans do stuff like this, you see ton of comments about how its so disrespectful.
19 | Anthony Verrette | 2 | 1550079121678779_1552113134808711 | A CONUNDRUMThe definition of the word conundrum is something that is puzzling or confusing.Here are six conundrums of socialism in the United States of America:1. America is capitalist and greedy - yet half of the population is subsidized.2. Half of the population is subsidized - yet they think they are victims.3. They think they are victims - yet their representatives run the government.4. Their representatives run the government - yet the poor keep getting poorer.5. The poor keep getting poorer - yet they have things that people in other countries only dream about.6. They have things that people in other countries only dream about - yet they want America to be more like those other countries.Think about it! And that, my friends, pretty much sums up the USA in the 21st century.  Makes you wonder who is doing the math. These three short sentences tell you a lot about the direction of our current government and cultural environment:1. We are advised to NOT judge ALL Muslims by the actions of a few lunatics, but we are encouraged to judge ALL gun owners by the actions of a few lunatics.Funny how that works.  And here's another one worth considering... 2. Seems we constantly hear about how Social Security is going to run out of money. But we never hear about welfare or food stamps running out of money!   What's interesting is the first group "worked for" their money, but the second didn't.Think  about it ... and last but not least:3.  Why are we cutting benefits for our veterans, no pay raises for our military and cutting our army to a level lower than before WWII, but we are not stopping the payments or benefits to illegal aliens?Am I the only one missing something?"If you do not take an interest in the affairs of your government, then you are doomed to live under the rule of fools." - Plato
20 | Bryan Davis Sr. | 0 | 1550079121678779_1552644131422278 | Trump continues to harp on the one issue that has no real substance with Hillary's email's but Hillary has 101 items to come against Trump with and until election day at her rallies and in the news she needs to constantly remind people that Trump is a child molesting, incest practicing, woman assaulting, abortion punishing, tax evading, handicap bashing, fascist loving, Putin supporting, business destroying, job killing, minority hating racist!!!!! DON'T LET PEOPLE FORGET because he's not letting them forget about those insignificant emails...
21 | Janay King | 3 | 1550079121678779_1552085011478190 | As we run into this final stretch in the 2016 vote, I wanted to make a post that helps to keep people on target since this is such an important election.

22 | Dean Felix | 0 | 1550079121678779_1552824224737602 | For those of you who wonder why so many of us are voting for Trump- I think this sums it up pretty good! For What It's Worth Department:                                        The Media just doesn‚Äôt get it....they can't believe that people are so angry     that they can no longer be manipulated!  Millions of trump supporters feel this way about Donald J. Trump.....We don't care if the guy swears... or how many times he's been married...or who he voted for, or what his income tax return shows. We want the problems fixed. Yes, he's an egomaniac, but we don't care. We know he's not a racist, or all the other things the liberal media is trying to label him with. We know he's raised a good family, and that says a lot about him.The country is a mess because politicians suck, the Republican Party is two faced & gutless, and illegals are everywhere and Muslims are openly trying to hurt this country and make the civilized world adjust to them. We want it all fixed!We don't care that Trump is crude, we don't care that he has changed positions, we don't care that he fights with Megan Kelly, Rosie O'Donnell, and so many of the elected establishment. We don't care that Rubio, Ryan, the Bush's, and so many other top old and new Republicans refuse to endorse him for their own selfish reasons, and we know what they are. We don't care that he doesn't know the name of some Muslim terrorists, we don't care that he tried some businesses that didn't work out.This country is weak, bankrupt, our enemies are making fun of us, we are being invaded by illegals, we are becoming a nation of victims, where every Tom, Ricardo and Hasid is a special group with special rights to a point where we don't even recognize the country we were born and raised in, AND WE JUST WANT IT FIXED. And TRUMP is the only guy who seems to understand what the people want.We're sick of politicians, sick of the Democratic and Republican Party. We're angry about the Iran deal, the budget, treatment of Israel, military weakness, lobbyists, special interests, overpaid politicians with their self serving bills and back room deals, trade deals, loss of jobs, manipulated economic numbers, businesses fleeing, and even the phony pay for play Clinton Foundation.Americans are no longer going to be fooled, and the movement is out to change the direction we're taking. Trump may not be a saint, but he doesn't have lobbyist money holding him, he doesn't have political correctness restraining him, and all you know is that he has been very successful, a good negotiator, he has built a lot of things, he's flexible, and he's also not a politician. And he says he'll fix it. And we believe him because he is too much of an egotist to be proven wrong or looked at and called a liar.Public service has become elected greed. This may be our only chance to have a non-politician, despite his flaws, try and correct the mess, at least for 4 years. We must take the shot, because the consequences of putting Hillary Clinton in office are frightening. There is a tidal wave happening, and it's going to overcome much of what's happened to this country.

Comey's letter said the FBI learned "of the existence of e-mails that appear to be pertinent" to the Clinton investigation, though he added that the FBI "cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant."
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Denise Hill | 487 | 1336897189739863_1336897589739823 | This has really fired up the Democrat base, its going to be in favor for Hillary and backfire on the Republicans that this email garbage has happened. I have friends calling me reminding me that we have to be there for her. Hillary Clinton supporters are on fire now!!!!!!
2 | Lisa Thompson | 313 | 1336897189739863_1336905189739063 | If you can't assess whether they're pertinent  you have no business saying anything until you do, especially in light of the election being a little over a week away.
3 | George Huhs | 179 | 1336897189739863_1336904186405830 | This is beyond disturbing. Hillary's had to run against Trump, Wiki, Russia, GOP, the press, and now the FBI in my opinion. I hope if she gets in she starts her own investigations and doesn't make peace like dems usually do.
4 | Rita Militello | 115 | 1336897189739863_1336907659738816 | It's time to demand a full financial disclosure on Trumps businesses and investments !! We need to now who and which countries he owes money to. He is the one with the pending law suits and conflicts of interest - what about his former campaigns managers connections to Russian Oligards - WE NEED TO KNOW
5 | Mike Lentine | 95 | 1336897189739863_1336903029739279 | Lynch job. Came out with no emails being looked at. I bet none will be anything that could hurt her. That's why they are demanding release of the information by Monday.
6 | Tricia Adams | 68 | 1336897189739863_1336909779738604 | We should hold Comey accountable for the fact he didn't state all of what is being looked at was Anthony Weiner and his wife use of emails. Someone needs to lose their job.
7 | Karen Ullman Marks | 63 | 1336897189739863_1336916199737962 | I hope this fires up the Democratic base. The announcement of the additional emails is ridiculous and uncalled for. We don't know that they are anything, but yet it gives Trump ammunition to spout off lies and conspiracy theories which many people believe. It won't matter to his base, but I worry about what it will do to the few people out there who were on the fence or undecided. It makes me feel even more strongly that Donald should not be president. Look at how he has jumped to conclusions without any evidence. I don't want someone with that mentality in the WH. He is way too volatile and has no level headed thinking. Hillary's criticism of Donald has been based on Donald's own words: his criticism of her has been based on conspiracy theories and outright lies.
8 | Stacey Haire | 29 | 1336897189739863_1336938713069044 | Do Republicans forget that millions of emails were "lost" during the Bush administration or do the rules change when a woman loses emails? People were in an uproar about Obama and his birth certificate,  but Trump gets a pass on taxes. Everyone has a right to their opinion, but you gotta be consistant or you're actually no better than the "he's not a typical politician" guy... He is EXACTLY like a politician!
9 | R. Grace Comyns | 42 | 1336897189739863_1336915703071345 | still trying to figure out why the FBI isn't more concerned with the KGB hacking campaign emails and trying to influence the election.. Is anyone looking into that? CIA, NSA, where are you in all this?
10 | Rob Lawrence | 32 | 1336897189739863_1336916649737917 | There are some things that are pretty certain right now.1) Comey will NOT be the FBI director under a Clinton administration.2) Something seems a little funny as to agents waiting so long to inform him.3) Comey is acting alone on this. He has gone against his bosses wishes concerning the release of information and Comey could have also violated a directive from the Department of Justice.4) Comey has now put the reputation of the FBI in jepordy as being a fair and impartial law enforcement agency.
11 | Diane Foster Pohlman | 40 | 1336897189739863_1336902956405953 | I think it is sad how this country is always assuming guilt before innocents. That is backwards...it is a person is innocent until PROVEN guilty...and not just for using poor judgment, but of a criminal act. This is true not only in the Clinton probe, but also of our neighbors.
12 | Jan Vumback | 27 | 1336897189739863_1336929283069987 | So....the Orange Buffoon is behind. So...Republican James Comey puts his finger on the Buffoon scale. So...should Dems be surprised? Do we even care? Are smart people going to be dissuaded from voting for Hillary? NO! #imwithher #nastywoman
13 | Linda Kenley | 25 | 1336897189739863_1336909536405295 | Is Comey in violation of the Hatch Act? The American Bar Assoc has rules that prohibit what Comey did at the time he did, prior to political election. I expect him to resign but I hope not before this is explained. I am sure it is a nothing as the other emails hv been. He was so premature in his actions. Shamefully so. #puresexism
14 | David A. Neder | 12 | 1336897189739863_1336914659738116 | A fool could have told you that any release about emails would affect the election, to what extent is unknown. Releasing it after the election would Not have affected the election; it only MAY have. So unless you are partisan,  why not wait till after November 8th. That dog don't hunt, I'm hearing that this director, who is far far from stupid may have tampered , along with Russia, to interfere with an American  political contest.
15 | Stephanie Welch | 8 | 1336897189739863_1336926233070292 | Anyone else recall Trump making an issue of Huma being Hillary's assistant and "who knows what classified information she may have shared with her husband"???? I find this whole thing incredibly suspicious and would ask the Democrats to demand a separate investigation into Trump and his associate's emails/servers..... Let's see who's really trying to rig the election!!
16 | Mary Ramirez | 16 | 1336897189739863_1336922949737287 | Short on facts and short on getting a warrant to review the emails!!! Comey is "trigger happy" to share information that's not even "information"! He doesn't even know what's in the emails yet!!! More than likely, these are emails that his team has already seen and reviewed aka--duplicate emails!!! Comey sounded an alarm before there was anything to be alarmed about!!!!! HE should be investigated about his motives to be soooo quick to make his unclear announcement!!!! Vote blue!!!
17 | Colleen Carroll | 11 | 1336897189739863_1336941473068768 | When is Comey going to send around a letter and issue a vaguely-worded statement about the F.B.I.'s investigation of the links of Russian hackers to the Trump campaign 10 days before the election?
18 | Dale Whiting | 8 | 1336897189739863_1336927403070175 | So the FBI says these emails "appear to be pertinent" but must convince a judge that they are materially significant, this to get a search warrant. And the purpose of that warrant is to be legally authorized to read them? Dear President Obama, on November 9th and regardless of who is elected to replace you, send FBI Director Comey packing!
19 | Julie Washingon | 10 | 1336897189739863_1336945723068343 | "The FBI lied when it claimed the it found Clinton emails when it searched Anthony Weiner‚Äôs computer. Sources now tell VT that the FBI in fact ‚Äúsynced‚Äù the email account of Weiner‚Äôs estranged wife, Huma, downloading the emails ‚Äúfrom the cloud‚Äù and falsely claiming they were discovered as part of a legal search warrant. However, there is no case law supporting the expansion of such warrants to spouses or others whose email accounts may be accessible through devices but were not stored on hard drives and not by any stretch of the imagination, legally accessed under any possible search warrant tied to Weiner‚Äôs sexual indiscretions"http://www.veteranstoday.com/‚Ä¶/breakingexclusive-comey-lie‚Ä¶/
20 | Richard S. Simon | 8 | 1336897189739863_1336923496403899 | Comey does not even know anything about the e mails. The FBI is still getting a warrant to look at them. Can Huma release them on her own now? That would stick it to the Republicans and put this issue to bed.
21 | Chris Collins | 6 | 1336897189739863_1336929399736642 | Will Humas immunity agreement be pulled since she didn't turn over all devices that may have had emails on them? And since when does the FBI give every witness immunity before an investigation begins? U guys LOVED Comey a week ago lmao üëÄ
22 | Eric Dekenipp | 1 | 1336897189739863_1108012125935087 | If I were Huma I'd start spilling the beans on Hillary ASAP. As trump tries to leverage this newest email scandal, the Clinton camp is certainly looking for a scape goat and I suspect Huma will pay the price for Hillary's illegal actions.
23 | Freedom Rules | 5 | 1336897189739863_1336941626402086 | Accountability for people in power is absolute...President Obama has to come clean when he knew about Hillary Clinton hidden email server in the basement. President Obama has to report how many of our nations secrets were sent to this old ladies basement. Hillary Clinton has to release what the FBI has on Huma computer. Accountability for people in power is absolute.
24 | Donna Straley | 4 | 1336897189739863_1336958089733773 | Richard Painter, a Republican, has filed an ethics complaint against Comey for possible violations of the Hatch Act.  Comey deserves to go prison for his attempt to subvert democracy.
25 | Kevin Harris | 0 | 1336897189739863_1108437252559241 | If an investigation is ongoing then why the need for Comey to send a vague letter to Congress which is unprecedented, especially since Comey doesn't even know the content of the emails ? Yet the Republicans want America to believe this is not influencing the election.  President Obama can't be critical of Comey because he is the one that pit the bozo in office in a ridiculous attempt to appease the Republicans.  However why didn't Comey send a letter to Congress about the ongoing investigation on the Russian hacking and the ties Trump and his aides may have?

5 | Terri Bonds Lotshaw | 0 | 1550080015012023_1551994334820591 | Rachael Maddow  Please address this question, many would like to know why this is any different in the case of HACKING!The federal courts and every state have rules of evidence regarding what types of evidence are admissible and the authentication required for admitting that evidence. The requirements for a recorded conversation are no different. As a general rule, evidence obtained illegally cannot be used in court, and surreptitious tape recordings by telephone are illegal in most states under their respective penal (or criminal) codes. You must have permission from the party being recorded or, at the very least, give the other person notice that the call is being recorded.The twelve states listed below require, under most circumstances, the consent of all parties to the conversation before taping is allowed. If the court determines that the statement was obtained in violation of state law, it will not qualify as generally admissible evidence.California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Washington. Establishing a Foundation for the Recorded ConversationFederal law and several states require only that one party to the conversation consent to the recording. If you are a party to the conversation that you are recording, then your consent is sufficient. New York, Louisiana, and Texas adhere to this requirement.However, even if the recording is the type of evidence that is admissible, you still may not be able to introduce the tape in court due to a lack of predicate. Predicate refers to the foundation that you must establish to ensure the evidence is reliable. For example, until you establish that the voice on the tape is actually belongs to the person you are claiming it does, the recorded conversation is hearsay and will not be admitted.Predicate rules are usually set out in a state's rules of evidence and will vary, but generally you must be able to:Demonstrate that the voice on the tape actually belongs to the person you are claiming, not someone impersonating them;Show that the recording device you used was capable of making an accurate recording;Prove that the recording is a true and accurate representation of the conversation. This is usually an issue when the recording cuts in and out because of, for example, wind blowing through the microphone, which could cause the conversation to lose much of its context; andVerify that the recording has not been tampered or altered in any way.Even if the evidence would otherwise be admissible, if you cannot satisfy your state's procedural predicate rules, the recording cannot be used in court.Because the recording and predicate rules vary so much by state, you should consult with an attorney in your state before you begin making recordings. They can advise you of the proper consent requirements and recording techniques to insure that your evidence can be used. Most importantly, they can help you avoid being charged with a crime yourself.

And it is unthinkable that the Director of the FBI would take this action lightly, that he would put this letter forth to the Congress of the United States saying there is more information out there about classified e-mails and call it to the attention of congress unless it was something requiring serious investigation.

A group supporting Donald Trump called "Vote Protectors" is trying to recruit 3,000 poll watchers in key battleground states on Election Day.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Barbara Wohlferd | 579 | 1336795703083345_1336799599749622 | And this is exactly why Trump can not be allowed to be President.
2 | Eduardo Macias | 398 | 1336795703083345_1336806433082272 | If anyone comes near you or threatens you, in any way at the poles, stand still & call 911. NO ONE is allowed, by law, to interfere with the polling process! If they do, they can be fined up to hundreds of dollars & arrested on the spot! Not to mention the law suit you will have against them for interfering with your right to vote!  :-)
3 | Roberto Zullo | 423 | 1336795703083345_1336797449749837 | Tell them "Yes I'm voting for your friend Donny" walk by, vote for Clinton and leave, thats what I did when they forced flyers on me 100ft away from the polling station
4 | Deborah Harris | 210 | 1336795703083345_1336800899749492 | My polling place is very racist and they are 'ok' with it, but NO ONE better 'watch me, follow me' or ask me any unnecessary questions..#NOElectionDayShenanigans!!!
5 | Susan Snyder Earley | 174 | 1336795703083345_1336805986415650 | This is absolute intimidation. He is making a mockery of this whole country and democracy. He says everything is rigged.... Fbi, the dept of justice, the whole electorate system....and it's all against him. Doesn't that alarm anyone?
6 | Keith Scarberry | 140 | 1336795703083345_1336810239748558 | They need to understand that I am A Veteran and I do know voting laws!!!  I will cast my vote even if it means putting one or more of these idiots in the hospital!!!  If these people are at my voting location?  I will do my solemn duty as a Veteran and stand my ground to make sure that citizens vote!!!
7 | Holly TidWebb | 62 | 1336795703083345_1336799346416314 | What abouy beating Up a old homeless woman for supporting donald trump? The attackers should be charged with terrorism!
8 | Patsy Atwell Berryman | 37 | 1336795703083345_1337975372893014 | The Republican Party is on probation for this same tactic they tried in 1981. The probation is up Dec. 2017. If they do this it will add 8 years to that probation. The Party wants Trump to shut up, but that nasty mouth never stops. They don't want another 8 years added to the probation. The Democrats already have it in the courts. The GOP is about to pee their pants.
9 | Nathan J Biggs | 32 | 1336795703083345_1336821066414142 | Yet you dumb liberals had no problem with the new black panthers standing guard at voting polls.I'm all for a fair, non intimidating election process, but you need to speak up when it goes your way too.
10 | Roger Gienapp | 29 | 1336795703083345_1336830023079913 | What exactly are these people going to "monitor"? It is illegal to distribute any material or display signs or spout political rhetoric or interfere with poll workers in a polling place. It's cause for arrest.
11 | April Ruggles | 22 | 1336795703083345_1336860136410235 | Seems to me that Republicans are the ones that cheat at everything. From not paying taxes such as Donald Trump. They want to pay cash for things, under the table, get away from paying taxes. They want the cheapest price out there for the best work possible, which is like an oxymoron. So they end up hiring illegal immigrants. Yet they want to build a wall to keep them out. They're thr angriest group of people. The ones voting twice, such as the woman that was already caught. So go ahead and bring  your little hick people out there to watch everybody. Because you cannot intimidate or people will call the police. You cannot ask people who they voted for it's not your right to do that. But the people do have a right to be protected from nutbags like this.
12 | Craig Goedecke | 21 | 1336795703083345_1336818926414356 | If I see a or asked by a Trump pollster..im going to get into their face and yell HILLARY!# and then say CHILD RAPIST AND FRAUD!! How bout that!!
13 | Carol Thacker Pullen | 19 | 1336795703083345_1336831963079719 | This is going to get the Republican party into so much trouble.  Untrained militia white nationalist types intimidate voters, what could possibly go wrong and that is even before you discuss the decree they are going to be ignoring.
14 | Kathi Harrington- Hoops | 14 | 1336795703083345_1337909626232922 | How long is the government going to let this go on. This needs to be stopped now right NOW. People should be able to go vote with out fear, fear from Hitler Trumps brown shirts. President Obama YOU NEED TO DO SOMETHING.....
15 | Kathy Tvedt Casey | 24 | 1336795703083345_1336813483081567 | The polls already have Democrats and Republicans to watch the polls if Trump orders that and causes trouble they will all be arrested including Trump that is the Law.
16 | Scott Lothrop | 15 | 1336795703083345_1336863099743272 | If this turns out to be true then Democrats need to raise larger group of "Voter Protectors" to forcibly remove the so-called "Vote Protectors" who are attempting to intimidate citizens from exercising their constitutional right to cast their ballots.
17 | Julie Brown | 12 | 1336795703083345_1337950689562149 | This is the same kind of intimidation that all dictators use to get their way. Hitler did the same thing to voters in Germany before he was elected as leader of Germany. Trump wants to be a dictator with Alzheimer's disease in his brain. May be why he lies all the time.
18 | Christina Sorensen | 14 | 1336795703083345_1336830663079849 | If anybody is filming while you're lining up to vote have the FBI local office number on hand and call them because this is totally against the law and further the RNC is under what's called a consent decree look it up online and be familiar with it
19 | Mildred Franklin | 13 | 1336795703083345_1336815053081410 | Service Announcement to All who think this is a good idea: Donald Trump says it best....WRONG!!! Don't turn this into something that's it's not..be very careful who you approach you might not like what happens next...it's simple don't start nothing you can't finish especially in the inner cites...ijs..ya might get F***** up! No threat just a real possibility tell Donald to have medical professionals there as well.
20 | Marion Seppala Holly | 19 | 1336795703083345_1337924499564768 | These nitwits have no idea of what they are looking at. Unless you are or have been an election judge, the average person does not understand how a polling place actually works. If any of them show up where I work as an election judge, they will be told to leave or law enforcement will be called. There is an official process for a political party to send one observer, who must follow rules.
21 | Linda DeFurio | 8 | 1336795703083345_1777255552540646 | Totally believe this. Donald Trump, the King of Bankruptcy, professional conman, draft dodger, tax cheat and sexual predator is a psychotic self-absorbed narcissist. His style of hate-mongering politics makes America look like a third world country. The fact that he is even being considered for president is shameful.
22 | Jim James | 7 | 1336795703083345_1337991876224697 | How can these idiots "intimidate" voters? Come in groups to the polls, shove them out of the way if they even attempt to block your entry and have them arrested and hauled off if they cause ANY problems at all. This would include ANY Law Enforcement people that are there to observe while "off duty" too.
23 | Alicia Delacruz | 37 | 1336795703083345_1336797606416488 | All we have is our voteüíôüá∫üá∏üíô #Ihaveherback üíïGrab them by the polls!
24 | Ray Seabolt Jr. | 9 | 1336795703083345_1336812796414969 | If all they do is observe, I'm all for that.  But if the goal is to challenge every voter that enters the polls or even speak to voters, they should be barred from even being on the property.
25 | Kathleen DeLander | 1 | 1336795703083345_1338311799526038 | Vote early, go with someone else and take a cell phone along to both video record and report anyone who attempts voter intimidation. Voting is YOUR RIGHT! Both parties already have poll watchers inside the voting center to prevent voter fraud. In most voting centers around the country, there are laws against anyone who approaches voters with the intent to intimidate them. They can be reported, then arrested for this, especially if they come from outside the voting district.

Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine on Donald J. Trump: "Why would he say that our first black president wasn‚Äôt a U.S. citizen? The level of disrespect that he‚Äôs shown for this community is huge... He says he‚Äôs going to be great for everybody but those are words -- his life history shows otherwise."

That's why he has paid no taxes and abuses woman. Someone should beat the hell out of him. He is aloser
5 | Craig Anderson | 21 | 1336729436423305_1336770683085847 | Trump sealed his inevitable loss coming back from Mexico and making his speech in Arizona. Pence, sexual assault, Kellyanne Conway and three debate meltdowns were just icing on the cake.
6 | Chris Nelson | 6 | 1336729436423305_1337159763046939 | A gentleman named Bill Howell eloquently wrote the below letter.Dear Mr. Trump,It‚Äôs taken me a while to realize this and to admit it, but I‚Äôm grateful to you.For the past few months I‚Äôve spent a good deal of time lamenting your campaign and the poison it has so effortlessly generated. I‚Äôve watched our country imploding, our public discourse become polluted, our political climate grows ever more corrosive, and wrongly assumed you were to blame.It‚Äôs only lately I‚Äôve come to understand that you haven‚Äôt manufactured our current national ugliness‚Äîyou‚Äôve simply revealed it.By saying the irresponsible, mean-spirited, ignorant things you say so freely and so frequently, you‚Äôve given other like-minded people license to do the same. You‚Äôve opened up the floodgates for our corporate sewage to flow fully. People no longer conceal their vile mess, they now revel in it, they broadcast it and retweet it.You‚Äôve made bigotry and racism socially acceptable again and that has been a kind of twisted gift because it‚Äôs allowed me to really see people; not as they pretend to be on the surface‚Äîbut in the very depths of their wounded, weaponized hearts.Over and over as your campaign has persisted, your supporters would tell me that they like you because you ‚Äúspeak your mind‚Äù. It wasn‚Äôt until recently that I‚Äôve realized that you speak their minds. You‚Äôve given credence to their prejudices and made those prejudices go mainstream.Thanks to the terrible ground you‚Äôve broken, politicians, pastors, friends, and strangers, both in person and on social media now regularly out themselves as hateful, intolerant, and malicious‚Äîand they remind me just how close they are to me, just how deep the sickness in us runs, and just how far we have to go together.You‚Äôve emboldened people to be open about things they used to conceal for the sake of decorum, and though it turns my stomach, I know that this is the only way we can move forward; to have that cancerous stuff exposed fully so that it can be dealt with. Our progress as a nation is predicated on authentic dialogue, no matter how brutal and disheartening that dialogue is.In other words, you‚Äôve let us know what we‚Äôre really dealing with here and while it‚Äôs been rightly disturbing, it‚Äôs also been revelatory. That‚Äôs the thing about that kind of harsh light: you‚Äôre forced to see everything. Beauty and monstrosity equally illuminated.Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, I think you‚Äôre the least qualified, least knowledgeable Presidential candidate we may ever have had participate this far into the process, and if you somehow were elected I‚Äôd fear gravely for the world my children would inherit‚Äîshould it survive your Presidency at all. I believe you‚Äôre reckless, bitter, and completely reprehensible; the very worst kind of bully.But whether you win or lose, you‚Äôve already allowed me the blessing of Truth; about me, about you, about other candidates, about our nation.And in the process you‚Äôve also shown me that I am not alone in resisting you and this ugly thing you‚Äôve revealed about us.You‚Äôve generated an equally loud, equally passionate response to it and this is where I find my hope these days.I find it in those for whom equality isn‚Äôt just a cheap buzzword, it‚Äôs the most precious of hills to die on.I find it in those people who refuse to be silent in the face of our impending shared regression.I find it in those willing to be bolder in defending the inherent value of all people.I find it in the growing army of those who will not tolerate hatred as a core American value.I find it in those who reject violence as our default response to dissension.I find it in the ever rising voice of people who will not let malice and bitterness represent them in the world.Today I find my hope in those who, like me, will not be complicit in allowing bigotry and intolerance to become a source of national pride, because we‚Äôve seen where that leads.Yes, Mr Trump, you‚Äôve unearthed our hidden sickness and you‚Äôve allowed it to go viral.You brought every awful thing about us out into the open.You will NEVER Get My Vote!
7 | Marilyn Kopecky | 8 | 1336729436423305_1336753106420938 | Impeached Bill Clinton is campaigning for his wife Hillary clinton who is under federal criminal investigation in a church of color...As sos & past, she used her maiden name with a hyphen, Oh how time flies....
8 | Jim James | 16 | 1336729436423305_1336783356417913 | Yes. Trump is great at saying things but the doing is where the problems really come in. He's all about women's rights but he is accused of groping women. He's anti immigrant and yet his wife is one and so are many of his underpaid labor type employees. How does he "make America great again" with all his racist attitudes? He just splits the country. He does nothing to bring us together.
9 | Nancy Hayes | 1 | 1336729436423305_1336966289732953 | MSNBC started actually reporting news on Friday about the case of emails being reviewed ( I say reviewed because it was never closed as Hillary led the people to believe). It was exciting to finally see them report the truth but over the weekend quickly they returned to the same Bias news reports again. Sad to say the least. The media corruption continues. The Media supports the candidate that pays for more ads to run... Plain & Simple this is about the almighty dollar.
10 | Gerald Ott | 4 | 1336729436423305_1336753783087537 | Columnist Ross Douthat (no friend of Hillary Clinton) writes in the NYT of the dangers of a Trump presidency. They are many: 1) The first is sustained market jitters, leading to an economic slump. Trump‚Äôs election alone would probably induce a Brexit-esque stock market dip, but the real problem would be what happened next. Instead of Theresa May‚Äôs steadiness inspiring a return to fundamentals, you would have the spectacle ‚Äî and it will be a spectacle ‚Äî of the same Trump team that drop-kicked its policy shop and barely organized a national campaign trying to staff up an administration. 2) The second peril is major civil unrest. Some of Trump‚Äôs supporters imagine that his election would be a blow to left-wing activists, that his administration would swiftly reverse the post-Ferguson crime increase. This is a bit like imagining that a President George Wallace would have been good for late-1960s civil peace. In reality, Trump‚Äôs election would be a gift to bad cops and riot-ready radicals in equal measure, and his every intervention would pour gasoline on campuses and cities ‚Äî not least because as soon as any protest movement had a face or leader, Trump would be on cable bellowing ad hominems at them. 3) The third likely highly-plausible peril, and by far the most serious, is a rapid escalation of risk in every geopolitical theater. But, Douthat writes, I think that reluctant Trump supporters are overestimating the systemic durability of the American-led order, and underestimating the extent to which a basic level of presidential competence and self-control is itself a matter of life and death ‚Äî for Americans, and for human beings the world over. http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/30/opinion/sunday/the-dangers-of-donald-trump.html?action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=opinion-c-col-left-region&region=opinion-c-col-left-region&WT.nav=opinion-c-col-left-region
11 | Garry Davis | 12 | 1336729436423305_1336768443086071 | It seems to me that Don Trump aka Bozo the clown with make-up, will say whatever comes into his mind to get approval from those whom he is talking to. This means twisting his statements, saying negative things about various races & religions & races and turning around and saying that he loves them & the love him. The man has issues that go far beyond what would be considered normal behaviour and is quite delusional in his aspirations to lead the USA. Trouble is that he is the Jimmy Jones of politics & THAT is really scary !!!
12 | Jackson Eggers | 19 | 1336729436423305_1336754303087485 | To the liberals and progressives out there. As you can see it is critical now more than ever that you get out and vote. My take on this new FBI investigation is that it is a political hit piece. It's a plot hatched by embarrassed FBI agents looking for revenge and Republicans trying to gain advantage by any means necessary. Think about it, what do the emails the feds have really say? No one knows because they won't release them. So why release a statement saying basically we are investigating, but we won't tell you what our new evidence is or why it is important. This is the kind of justice and government we can look forward to under President Trump with a Republican majority. They will use the power of government to harass and persecute all their enemies, real and imagined. If you want to fight against Trump and his politics of revenge, then you MUST get out and vote blue all the way down the ticket. You can make a difference.

This should be consistently applied across the spectrum and different communities. Civil rights are meaningless if being abuse that why west is heavily in debt
21 | Sonny Chapman | 2 | 1336729436423305_1337052889724293 | Black Americans have been deeply hurt by the disrespect shown to President Obama by too many. And the total lack of outcry by Republican "Leaders ",except John McCain, has led to this Mob Rule/Trump level of social ugliness
22 | Tish Holbrook | 6 | 1336729436423305_1336862913076624 | "The best predictor of future behavior is past behavior." Trump has been a hustler who walked all over the working class all his life. Trump is out of his league; he doesn't have the ability to be any good for anyone but himself.
23 | Janay King | 6 | 1336729436423305_1336777149751867 | As we run into this final stretch in the 2016 vote, I wanted to make a post that helps to keep people on target since this is such an important election. Let‚Äôs think about the recent Brexit vote that is forcing the United Kingdom to exit the European Union, for a moment. In that vote, people made a protest vote against staying in the Union because they didn‚Äôt think that it would really happen. The Result, many Millennial Voters desperately want to take their vote back, saying that they were not being serious. In the 1980‚Äôs Carter was up by 8 points in the polls, people did not come out to vote because they thought that he had it beat. In the 2000 election, people were not thrilled about Al Gore, thinking that he was too much of a bore, and not a strong candidate. Many Liberals voted for Ralph Nader instead of Al Gore, and handed George Bush Jr. a razor thin victory that resulted in a disastrous 8 years. Listen People, I understand that it really looks like Hillary has this all sewn up. Trust me when I say that she doesn‚Äôt. It is not over until the last vote is counted.  She may not be your candidate that you are willing to stand on railroad tracks to get elected, she may not be your perfect choice for President, BUTIf history tells us anything, it is that we should never take anything for granted. This election needs to be won by Hillary Clinton. It is not enough to say that Hillary Needs to be President, but that she needs to win by such a huge margin so we never have to see Trump, or anyone like Trump, on the ballot ever again. We need to retake Congress. We need to vote blue for all Congressmen and Senators so we can retake the House and Senate. We need to put a stop to this crazy Republican right wing insanity that has gripped our government for years because of blind racism and stupidity. Get out there, Vote, get your Friends and Family to vote. Stop the insanity!!!!
24 | Dean Felix | 0 | 1336729436423305_1052609534836622 | For those of you who wonder why so many of us are voting for Trump- I think this sums it up pretty good! For What It's Worth Department:                                        The Media just doesn‚Äôt get it....they can't believe that people are so angry     that they can no longer be manipulated!  Millions of trump supporters feel this way about Donald J. Trump.....We don't care if the guy swears... or how many times he's been married...or who he voted for, or what his income tax return shows. We want the problems fixed. Yes, he's an egomaniac, but we don't care. We know he's not a racist, or all the other things the liberal media is trying to label him with. We know he's raised a good family, and that says a lot about him.The country is a mess because politicians suck, the Republican Party is two faced & gutless, and illegals are everywhere and Muslims are openly trying to hurt this country and make the civilized world adjust to them. We want it all fixed!We don't care that Trump is crude, we don't care that he has changed positions, we don't care that he fights with Megan Kelly, Rosie O'Donnell, and so many of the elected establishment. We don't care that Rubio, Ryan, the Bush's, and so many other top old and new Republicans refuse to endorse him for their own selfish reasons, and we know what they are. We don't care that he doesn't know the name of some Muslim terrorists, we don't care that he tried some businesses that didn't work out.This country is weak, bankrupt, our enemies are making fun of us, we are being invaded by illegals, we are becoming a nation of victims, where every Tom, Ricardo and Hasid is a special group with special rights to a point where we don't even recognize the country we were born and raised in, AND WE JUST WANT IT FIXED. And TRUMP is the only guy who seems to understand what the people want.We're sick of politicians, sick of the Democratic and Republican Party. We're angry about the Iran deal, the budget, treatment of Israel, military weakness, lobbyists, special interests, overpaid politicians with their self serving bills and back room deals, trade deals, loss of jobs, manipulated economic numbers, businesses fleeing, and even the phony pay for play Clinton Foundation.Americans are no longer going to be fooled, and the movement is out to change the direction we're taking. Trump may not be a saint, but he doesn't have lobbyist money holding him, he doesn't have political correctness restraining him, and all you know is that he has been very successful, a good negotiator, he has built a lot of things, he's flexible, and he's also not a politician. And he says he'll fix it. And we believe him because he is too much of an egotist to be proven wrong or looked at and called a liar.Public service has become elected greed. This may be our only chance to have a non-politician, despite his flaws, try and correct the mess, at least for 4 years. We must take the shot, because the consequences of putting Hillary Clinton in office are frightening. There is a tidal wave happening, and it's going to overcome much of what's happened to this country.
25 | Gordon Wright | 1 | 1336729436423305_1336778219751760 | Attorney General Loretta Lynched promised this July that she would press charges against Hillary Clinton if recommended by the FBI.As more details emerge regarding Clinton‚Äôs use of a private server during her time as Secretary of State, and a new investigation by the FBI opening only days before the election, Lynch‚Äôs promise has taken on renewed significance.

When Linda Gottlieb hails a taxi cab in NYC and asks the driver to take her home, she has one word to describe how she feels: embarrassed.

Why? Because she has to tell the driver to take her to Trump Place.

He is evil, vile, beyond contempt, with no business even being considered for the presidency.

3 | Marsha Shipley | 63 | 1336689849760597_1336693619760220 | The fbi is also investigating 3 of trumps campaign people for their ties to Russia!  Donald himself also has several court cases pending!  Everything that comes out of his mouth is a lie! So it's not just Hillary! Neither one are completely innocent!
4 | Gina Appleby Estrin | 34 | 1336689849760597_1336701996426049 | I was going to say the same thing that Emmett Jackson said. You have had well over a year since Trump began his run for president.   Plenty of time for any lease to have ended.   Move or shut up.
5 | Sherry Johnson Balch | 40 | 1336689849760597_1336704226425826 | That man is a large orange pile of putrid puss. Don't let him infect this country any more than he already has with his racist, misogynist hateful division. Can't wait for his legal problems to start with the fake University in November and the child rape in December.
6 | Dave Appel | 21 | 1336689849760597_1336713236424925 | Ohhhhh! She feels embarrassed that she can afford and does live there. Attitudes like hers are that which is destroying the fabric of America.
7 | George Dreger | 39 | 1336689849760597_1336692973093618 | SO TO CLARIFY, Hillary is demanding that the FBI immediately reveal information that she could have revealed any time she wanted for the last year.
8 | Charles Gustafson | 11 | 1336689849760597_1336707666425482 | If you live in Trump Place, you are richer than the average person. Why doesn't she have a driver? Just use a Limo service sedan.

Chelsea Clinton married to George Soros Nephew Marc Mezvinsky, and father in law a Iowa Congressman sentenced to 80 years prison for embezzlement out in 5 years. Father called Nixon corrupt? Wow! and Nixon left to protect two men who broke into office and should not have - to the Clintons who profited financially for pay to play through Clinton Foundation.  I am working with a legal group that is identifying all donors and will be giving to the IRS - as the Clinton Foundation is not a 501C3 wherein contributions are tax deductible.  So the CNN media here and even DOJ who have contributed we will get your names and if you took a tax write off the IRS will be looking for more taxes from you I guarantee.
10 | Deann Jarrett | 6 | 1336689849760597_1336751499754432 | How strange , the wealthy , and the educated have nothing but distain and contempt for the trumped up idiot. His poorly educated support base adores him.
11 | Imogene Aldridge Hall | 9 | 1336689849760597_1336694723093443 | MSNBC, the FBI and the Justice Department are now meeting with lawyers to release Abedin's emails.
12 | Al Snook | 5 | 1336689849760597_1336726506423598 | This should be of no surprise to anyone. Again it's 2 + 2 = 4 , not 2 + 2 = whatever as Trump people would want you to believe. Dangerous Donald has alienated huge numbers of people around the country and the world. Some of which were or could have been customers. On the other hand, DD has culivated a following that very few within were or would ever be customers. Just do the math.
13 | Richard Howell | 4 | 1336689849760597_1336725939756988 | MSNBC stop bring up a false issue about Obama Care. It is estimated that around 20 million people are on Obama Care, and none of these people are complaining, so, who are those that are upset over Obama Care, only, the Republicans making false accusations.Donald Trump will not have the authority to appeal anything that Congress has instituted into law, he is just blowing smoke and MSNBC News Reporters that are Republican plants are interjecting his falsehood, there is a process to appeal a law passed by Congress.What is particular strange, is that MSNBC, FOX News, and CNN all have women in the forefront blabbing off at the mouth about another female being elected as the President of the United States, it seems, that these female would be in support, but they have gone for the OKI-dope, they seems to love being suppressed.
14 | David Sepulveda | 7 | 1336689849760597_1336751919754390 | Every time aTrump surrogate asks why Hillary emails connected to Hillary's aid haven't been disclosed, the journalists have an obligation to ask why Trump has not released his Taxes!!
15 | Anita O'Daly | 2 | 1336689849760597_1336760133086902 | He will change the name. People who can afford his products are not his fans. They look down on him.  It's kind of funny. He's spent his whole life trying to be something he's not...check out the nouveau riche glitz and over the top gold...only to be spurned by the people with genuine class.
16 | Amy Guynes | 7 | 1336689849760597_1336725899756992 | If any of you listened to Marc Cuban a Real billionaire trump is a brand and he predicted that in 7 years he will be broke...Trump is a no nothing about how the American people think
17 | Paul Prendergast | 2 | 1336689849760597_1336818413081074 | Trump has never made anything great. He is a complete fraud. His brand, reality shows, his supposed wealth, his business success or lack thereof and his candidacy all rely on there being enough gullible people to believe in his lies. He lies every time he opens his mouth.
18 | Janay King | 9 | 1336689849760597_1336715189758063 | As we run into this final stretch in the 2016 vote, I wanted to make a post that helps to keep people on target since this is such an important election. Let‚Äôs think about the recent Brexit vote that is forcing the United Kingdom to exit the European Union, for a moment. In that vote, people made a protest vote against staying in the Union because they didn‚Äôt think that it would really happen. The Result, many Millennial Voters desperately want to take their vote back, saying that they were not being serious. In the 1980‚Äôs Carter was up by 8 points in the polls, people did not come out to vote because they thought that he had it beat. In the 2000 election, people were not thrilled about Al Gore, thinking that he was too much of a bore, and not a strong candidate. Many Liberals voted for Ralph Nader instead of Al Gore, and handed George Bush Jr. a razor thin victory that resulted in a disastrous 8 years. Listen People, I understand that it really looks like Hillary has this all sewn up. Trust me when I say that she doesn‚Äôt. It is not over until the last vote is counted.  She may not be your candidate that you are willing to stand on railroad tracks to get elected, she may not be your perfect choice for President, BUTIf history tells us anything, it is that we should never take anything for granted. This election needs to be won by Hillary Clinton. It is not enough to say that Hillary Needs to be President, but that she needs to win by such a huge margin so we never have to see Trump, or anyone like Trump, on the ballot ever again. We need to retake Congress. We need to vote blue for all Congressmen and Senators so we can retake the House and Senate. We need to put a stop to this crazy Republican right wing insanity that has gripped our government for years because of blind racism and stupidity. Get out there, Vote, get your Friends and Family to vote. Stop the insanity!!!!
19 | Dana Michels Pike | 4 | 1336689849760597_1336722263090689 | I hope so, no price is too high for him to pay for the anger, hostility, and hatred his campaign has stirred up in this country.

22 | Jennifer Thurston | 6 | 1336689849760597_1336721166424132 | no, drumph brand was never a Great or even Good brand & after all this, you would be a Fool to buy Anything from this 'brand'....not giving him or his sad families any of my money.
23 | Melody McPherson | 2 | 1336689849760597_1336826263080289 | Met two women this morning as we walked together over the Chicago river. We were all laughing and joking about what an embarrassment Trump tower is, as I tried to cut it out of my picture.
24 | Kevin M. Carney | 1 | 1336689849760597_1336759309753651 | A gentleman named Bill Howell eloquently wrote the below letter.Dear Mr. Trump,It‚Äôs taken me a while to realize this and to admit it, but I‚Äôm grateful to you.For the past few months I‚Äôve spent a good deal of time lamenting your campaign and the poison it has so effortlessly generated. I‚Äôve watched our country imploding, our public discourse become polluted, our political climate grows ever more corrosive, and wrongly assumed you were to blame.It‚Äôs only lately I‚Äôve come to understand that you haven‚Äôt manufactured our current national ugliness‚Äîyou‚Äôve simply revealed it.By saying the irresponsible, mean-spirited, ignorant things you say so freely and so frequently, you‚Äôve given other like-minded people license to do the same. You‚Äôve opened up the floodgates for our corporate sewage to flow fully. People no longer conceal their vile mess, they now revel in it, they broadcast it and retweet it.You‚Äôve made bigotry and racism socially acceptable again and that has been a kind of twisted gift because it‚Äôs allowed me to really see people; not as they pretend to be on the surface‚Äîbut in the very depths of their wounded, weaponized hearts.Over and over as your campaign has persisted, your supporters would tell me that they like you because you ‚Äúspeak your mind‚Äù. It wasn‚Äôt until recently that I‚Äôve realized that you speak their minds. You‚Äôve given credence to their prejudices and made those prejudices go mainstream.Thanks to the terrible ground you‚Äôve broken, politicians, pastors, friends, and strangers, both in person and on social media now regularly out themselves as hateful, intolerant, and malicious‚Äîand they remind me just how close they are to me, just how deep the sickness in us runs, and just how far we have to go together.You‚Äôve emboldened people to be open about things they used to conceal for the sake of decorum, and though it turns my stomach, I know that this is the only way we can move forward; to have that cancerous stuff exposed fully so that it can be dealt with. Our progress as a nation is predicated on authentic dialogue, no matter how brutal and disheartening that dialogue is.In other words, you‚Äôve let us know what we‚Äôre really dealing with here and while it‚Äôs been rightly disturbing, it‚Äôs also been revelatory. That‚Äôs the thing about that kind of harsh light: you‚Äôre forced to see everything. Beauty and monstrosity equally illuminated.Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, I think you‚Äôre the least qualified, least knowledgeable Presidential candidate we may ever have had participate this far into the process, and if you somehow were elected I‚Äôd fear gravely for the world my children would inherit‚Äîshould it survive your Presidency at all. I believe you‚Äôre reckless, bitter, and completely reprehensible; the very worst kind of bully.But whether you win or lose, you‚Äôve already allowed me the blessing of Truth; about me, about you, about other candidates, about our nation.And in the process you‚Äôve also shown me that I am not alone in resisting you and this ugly thing you‚Äôve revealed about us.You‚Äôve generated an equally loud, equally passionate response to it and this is where I find my hope these days.I find it in those for whom equality isn‚Äôt just a cheap buzzword, it‚Äôs the most precious of hills to die on.I find it in those people who refuse to be silent in the face of our impending shared regression.I find it in those willing to be bolder in defending the inherent value of all people.I find it in the growing army of those who will not tolerate hatred as a core American value.I find it in those who reject violence as our default response to dissension.I find it in the ever rising voice of people who will not let malice and bitterness represent them in the world.Today I find my hope in those who, like me, will not be complicit in allowing bigotry and intolerance to become a source of national pride, because we‚Äôve seen where that leads.Yes, Mr Trump, you‚Äôve unearthed our hidden sickness and you‚Äôve allowed it to go viral.You brought every awful thing about us out into the open.You will NEVER Get My Vote!
25 | Chelle Davis | 1 | 1336689849760597_1336742886421960 | I find it funny that people think his "brand" is hurt... lots of wannabee's out there wishing they had his business acumen... perhaps they wouldn't cry about Obamacare premiums...  Trump doesn't care about Obamacare premiums for himself or his family... he wants to do something about it because it is the right thing to do. He wants to close the boarders to keep our country safe and let people immigrate legally...after being vetted properly.... he wants to lower taxes so we can invest in new businesses and more BETTER jobs and opportunities.  He doesn't need this job as much as our Country needs someone like him to get rid of all the lame establishment politicians (on both sides of the aisle) and get our government working for us rather than us working for them. Getting rid of the corruption and collusion is the best thing anyone can do for our Country!  #votetrump

2 | Jim Manning | 155 | 1550077718345586_1551749191511772 | MSNBC is so bad, trying to divert away from Hillary and the scandal that she is, MSNBC is so bias. Can't trust you at all, no wonder why your ratings suck.
3 | Ted Kisselovich | 62 | 1550077718345586_1551752471511444 | People who think this kind of crap is important need to check their priorities.... The FBI found Hillary "extremely careless" in her handling of classified documents while using a private server so she could foil or avoid FOIA requests.... That is more important than a complimentary bag of candy in a hotel drawer.....
4 | Sue Hecht | 43 | 1550077718345586_1551752421511449 | yeah he would bring jobs and you too can work for free, because the orange unregistered sex offender does not pay anybody but himself which is why there are hundreds or is it thousands of lawsuits against him. his hotel just went bankrupt and all those workers are OUT OF WORK. plus they lost their pensions too. wake up people, if you believe the trump BS, we got a bridge to nowhere to sell you.

7 | Clara Santana | 27 | 1550077718345586_1551766161510075 | Lol "make America great again "  of course it is soooooo clear... Not!!! You should have spoken to his staff too. I would love to see who he hired to maintain his rooms clean and attend to his guests. They are probably all white college graduates, American born of course, and paying them $15.00 dollars  an hour with full benefits including health insurance. Highly unlikely!!!  He is a joke, uninformed, dangerous, easly provoked, temperamental unfit for the oval office. Chose wisely America
8 | Galal Gabriel Hazzi | 8 | 1550077718345586_1551799354840089 | You guys have nothing to hit Trump on so you're recycling news?!! This was published few days ago already. MSNBC=assholes. Focus on the emails and the organized crime organization called the Clinton Foundation.
9 | Dawn Freeman | 7 | 1550077718345586_1551762044843820 | if he was so against " products from overseas" he should be buying american made products, sheets, decorations, linens, furniture, food, can all be purchased in the us. notice how he used "trump wine" instead of a french or spanish wine? I am personally very careful to buy as many US made products and locally made products, if i can do it someone like trump can do it.

11 | Richard Howell | 5 | 1550077718345586_1551809678172390 | Fellow Americans:We just witnessed wholesale racism and disrespect for a female boss, an African American Boss. This is the reason the FBI Director disregarded his boss. She is a black female. Fellow Americans, you have to see this, it is too apparent. This is why the white males in this country are objecting to Hillary Clinton being President; they do not want to accept a female boss. They are looking at the District of Columbia, at one point, three women occupied the top three political positions in Washington DC, and, at least two were African American females.If Loretta Lynch was a white man, Comey would have taken his boss‚Äôs advice. With her being a woman, and a black woman at that, he is guilty of insubordination and should be terminated immediately. This is racism and women suppression at its worst, and in full view of the American Citizens.Why are MSNBC and the other ‚Äúcable‚Äù news outlets refusing to recognize this factor?This is a precursor to what is instore for a female boss of white males. They are setting the tone early, in case she win, not to have to respect her as the President of the United States, but they know in their hearts that Hillary Clinton is a strong woman, so they are starting early, just in case they cannot get a noted womanizer in the White House. Bill Clinton was not noted as a womanizer when he entered into office. President, Clinton was, basically, setup by Newt and others through a series of planned efforts that involved the U. S. Secret Service Officer derelictions of their duties by allowing a female to reach the President. The end result was a sexual affair, but she could have easily stabbed the President in the heart, and should not have had clear access to the President. The President has no authority to dismiss the security provided by the Secret Service agents assigned to protect him. So, how did the female get through the Secret Services Officers assigned to protect the President? Suppose, she had poisoned the President instead of, giving him oral sex, who would have garner the blame? This was a Newt and company setup and they are being punished by God until they leave this earth. Remember, Newt was found to be sexually involved with very young women and had to step down, someone, was suspected as being too young (young attractive Pages).
12 | Carolyn Gable Savory | 1 | 1550077718345586_1551778348175523 | Of course it is important!! His stump speech is Make America Great Again....and apparently he doesn't feel he has to buy American to fill the pockets of his ill fitting suit made in China. Think about how many mattresses, pillows, linens, ..the list goes on and on that are made in the USA.
13 | Jered Olds | 2 | 1550077718345586_1551863818166976 | Haha. Msnbc has 621 reactions here. Fox has thousands on it's last post! People are finally figuring out how much of a criminal she is. She is a sinking ship. Get on the trump train! Trump 2016!
14 | Wesley Moore | 2 | 1550077718345586_1551812558172102 | Well of course you idiots. He is a business man. Not a politician yet. If you are in the business to make money why would you brake the bank trying to have everything in a hotel made in America when the hotels purpose is to make you money. Why don't you dumbasses ask yourself this...... Why is it so hard and expensive to have products made in America.
15 | Robb Allen | 6 | 1550077718345586_1551764971510194 | I'm trying to figure out why in the hell this story is even relevant? No criminal activity equals nothing to see here. If you want to see criminal activity follow Hillary around for about 10 minutes.
16 | GranGran Jeanette | 1 | 1550077718345586_1551771244842900 | Everything is made in China and why he preaches it needs to come back! Even food... little wonder nothing tastes good anymore and American beef... probably Mexico!
17 | David Von Raesfeld | 1 | 1550077718345586_697964503697858 | So he basically put the best cottons in world, the finest constructions, and electronics, in his rooms, along with many items that that did come from the US, because he wants the guests to have a fine living experience? He should go to HELL!Tell me, how many people here only use American made products? If I want high end furniture for my house. It's not coming from America. If I want the best electronics, They aren't coming from America. But a good American businessman, knows how to tap those markets, and bring the profits back to the US, even if they are being manufactured somewhere else.
18 | Deedee Perkins | 3 | 1550077718345586_1551801888173169 | Just sickening. ...not only does he not help emergency workers and schools by paying no taxes he doesn't support American businesses......what sort of mind thinks someone like this could lead our country upward....we'd be working for 50 cents an hr living in tents standing in soup lines....we just can't allow it under any circumstances!!!
19 | Joseph Miranda | 1 | 1550077718345586_1821755541441469 | DUH! Because you liberals sold our jobs to china and that is where all this stuff is being made. Trump don't own manufactories. He goes where it is cheapest to buy things. It is to expensive to buy in America because Liberals have taxed the hell out of our companies and ran them off to places like china. Don't like that 70% of our good in the US are Imports? Vote Trump to bring our businesses back and Trump can afford to buy from US businesses again. Duhhhhh. You liberals are not very smart are ya'll?
20 | Kimberly Fenton | 0 | 1550077718345586_1821944534755903 | MSNBC must have missed that home show where their job was to decorate a  home in all items made in the US well they had a terrible time pulling it off they couldn't even find a coffee pot made in the USA as it had Chinese components in so many of the items.   Only way to fix that is by bringing jobs back to the USA so we can buy US made goods.   Just like Trump said.
21 | Robert V. Nord | 0 | 1550077718345586_697976423696666 | Just try to buy most anything made is this country.  The only thing I know is that I was made in this country.  Back in the day, Sam Walton insisted on all his stores carry American made stock.  Now you can't find anything in Walmarts made in America.  The clerks just laugh at you if you ask for American made stuff.  I bet Hillary can't buy pant suits made in America unless they're custom fabricated; then comes the shoes; then comes the cars etc., etc.
22 | Christine Smith | 7 | 1550077718345586_1551754768177881 | I bet if we flipped over everything in your house most of it says that too it's an economy problem. You can't bash someone for it when it's still free trade available. Now if if he doesn't pull through with his promises bringing jobs back and did this it would be disappointing.
23 | Jim Campeau | 1 | 1550077718345586_1551777181508973 | Who cares? He wasn't a politician he was in business trying to make a profit. You Democrats are simply idiots....it's sad really that any of you have any say in who the president should be. Registering as a Democrat should actually nullify your vote for the good of the country.
24 | Jim Smith | 0 | 1550077718345586_698073050353670 | True, many items here in the pic are from China. But why? Its because we no longer produce the items he wanted for the hotel. Thanks to the democrats and there raising of business tax, companies have moved out of this country. Sure, they go where its cheaper to produce a product, any business man would. Its a greddy world folks and look at Obama and his under the table business dealings.
25 | Don Neuterman | 0 | 1550077718345586_698110897016552 | I would bet my last dollar if you looked in the Clinton mansion you would find things made in China, Mexico etc. This is ridiculous, he's a business mogul. Let's take a look at Hillary's home and see what we can find.

2 | April Green | 108 | 1551606194859405_1551677008185657 | You have to be a special kind of foolish to want someone as ignorant as DT to lead this country. This guy has no clue about anything including all the failed businesses he owns. He wants to replace Obamacare and cant articulate  what it is or how it works and yes I know its flawed. He makes George Bush look like a Scholar. I have never seen such stupidity. Forget the racism, misogyny, bigotry, lack of respect for everything and everyone, HE'S JUST DUMB and has no desire to learn. This is all ego driven at the highest cost... Our Country's Future!!!
3 | Glenda Reitz | 307 | 1551606194859405_1551667201519971 | When Mrs Clinton sends a classified email to her Aid's yahoo account who shares an account with a husband under investigation, don't you think it causes great concern for everyone involved....Mrs Clinton knows what the emails are, she, once again is placing blame on everyone else instead of being open and honest with the American people and her loyal supporters
4 | Mike Ryals | 169 | 1551606194859405_1551667548186603 | In the end, ignorance of the majority will put her in the White House, because our culture has embraced criminality, rejected traditional morality, and accepted this mob mentality; we need to return back to the values that made US great - Christianity.
5 | Bill Max | 65 | 1551606194859405_1551671718186186 | It doesn't matter if she wins , she ll still go down as the 1st female presidential nominee to have been investigated by the FBI and found EXTREMELY CARELESS handling classified info. Her supporters may not care,  but history will never lie or forget.
6 | Jenny Torpey Gray | 86 | 1551606194859405_1551681151518576 | I'm not voting for anyone under FBI investigation. And when you use Clintonmail.com with your own server instead of HClinton.gov for your work related emails, I have a big problem with that.
7 | Blaze Woods | 67 | 1551606194859405_1551671584852866 | My open letter to Trump supporters.So You Want Someone To ‚ÄòTell It Like It Is‚Äô? OK, Here You Go. 1. You join a lying machine and call Hillary crooked. But you support a man who refuses to release his tax returns. You support a greedy, self serving, manipulative proven tax cheat. You support a crooked narcissistic psychopath who is worried  his tax returns would reveal evidence of financial ties to Russian oligarchs and other dictators of the world. Just like we now know Putin's puppets illegally paid millions to his crooked former campaign manager, maybe he has been getting paid too. A corrupt little man whose daughter vacations with Putin's girlfriend. Making Russia great again? A con man who funneled millions of campaign money to his own companies and used campaign money to pay his family handsomely. Using his own words, a disgusting and corrupt man who surrounds himself with a disgusting corrupt people. 2. You say you love our veterans but support a man who believes POWs are not heroes because they were captured? A man who has shown he lacks emotional intelligence when he attacked families of a fallen war hero. A man whose company fired a veteran for being deployed to Afghanistan. A man who insults and derides our generals.3. You think a soulless, heartless small man who mocked a disabled reporter will make a good president. A man whose first instinct after a tragedy is always self-aggrandizement, like after Orlando mass shooting & when Dwyane Wade's cousin Nykea Aldridge was killed. As 3,000 people were dying, this man bragged about how 9/11 attacks were good for him & bragged  about how his building is now the tallest in Manhattan just hours after the attack. When the pound fell to a 30-year low following the vote to exit EU, he boasted about making money off British economic uncertainty. When the housing market collapsed in 2008 and millions of Americans lost their homes, he said ‚Äú I 'sort of hope' real estate market tanks.‚Äù Trump is always looking out for Trump. How do you believe a greedy, narcissistic man who fundamentally lacks empathy and compassion will be a good president? He is not even a good person.4. You say you're patriotic & love this country but you support a man who has so little understanding  of the basic parameters of our constitution's limits & has zero respect for it, except the part he uses to incite violence. A careless small man who asked Russia to spy on our former Secretary of State. A man who trash talks our NATO allies and our president but lavishly praises brutal dictators like Saddam Hussein, Kim Jong Un, Muammar Gaddafi, Vladimir Putin...etc5. You support a small man who has been married three times and has admitted to infidelity in the past. A man who was accused of raping his wife & has a federal lawsuit accusing him of raping a 13-year-old girl during a party hosted by convicted pedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein. A man who comments about his daughters breasts and body. Then you turn around and bring up Bill Clinton's history with women? I agree with you 100% Bill has a disgraceful history with women but no comparison to Trump who has said cringeworthy, disturbing things about women his whole life. May I remind you Bill is NOT running to be the next president. If you are saying oh, candidates spouses are fair game then you can't ignore that he is married to a woman whose naked pictures are all over the internet. 6. You support a man whose business career is a very long list of bankruptcies, defaults and deceptions because he is good for our economy? A man who was born into wealth and built that wealth by scamming, stiffing and bullying ordinary working citizens of this great country. 7. Yes, Hillary is not perfect, then again no one is. You call her dishonest but support a narcissistic pathological liar? Every time Trump opens his mouth every other word that comes out is a lie. Fact checkers have proven it over and over again. We are talking about a man who makes things up to spew hate and fear, like when he lied about seeing an Iran ransom video and  a video of  muslims celebrating in New Jersey on 9/11. The man is incapable of telling the truth and he is delusional.8.  You support a hypocritical man who hired undocumented immigrants for his real estate projects & exploited our visa program. He is a man capable of solving our immigration problem?9. I agree 100% if she's elected Hillary and her whole family  must distance themselves from the Clinton foundation. Let other people continue the great work the foundation is doing. With that said, you support a man whose foundation is found guilty of a pay-to-play scam and false claims of giving on its tax forms and then turn around and try to push fabricated scandals about the Clinton foundation. The IRS found the con man used funds from his charitable foundation to make a campaign donation to Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi. Just after 4 days of the bribe payment Pam dropped Trump U case. He also held $150K fundraiser for Pam after she dropped a criminal case against his university. His foundation claimed on its tax return forms that it gave $10,000.00 to The Giving Back Fund, but the organization says that donation does not exist. A man who completely retooled his charity to spend other people‚Äôs money. A man with deep ties to global financiers, foreign politicians and criminals. 10.  You claim the con man whose line of clothing and accessories are made in Bangladesh, China, Honduras and other low-wage countries is the man to fix our labor laws? You claim the man who outsources everything is the answer to creating jobs here at home?11. You claim the unfit, unstable Putin's little puppet whose campaign is fully embracing  alt-right's anti-Muslim and anti-Immigrant ideologies with all their conspiracy theories is the one to unite the country?12. You support a bottom feeder who put racial discrimination in housing at the heart of his real estate developments, started the birther movement, said "Obama would look perfect on food stamps, he has the right face for it,‚Äù and has shown he is prejudice with his actions & words over and over again. Then he pretends he cares about the black communities.  He brings up Hillary's reference to a group of violent repeat criminals as "super-predators" in 1996? I don't agree with her choice of words all those years ago but she has apologized since. Something Trump refuses to do. Of course you can use all kind of deflection tactics & tell yourself whatever makes you feel better but the reality is if you are supporting a racist, misogynistic, xenophobic, bigoted, unfit, unqualified, disgusting con man, you really should admit to yourself you don't care what he says or does. You are using your hatred to cloud your judgement.

This woman has been investigated multiple times in the past 30 years what does that tell you and that she's the first presidential candidate ever in the history of the United States to be investigated Again by the FBI while running for president talk about red flags when you actually have people convinced they are still voting for her can you imagine that. It just shows how many people are walking around like brain dead zombies in America. It's scary what the future will look like in America

14 | Earl Franklin Clemons Jr | 14 | 1551606194859405_1551696324850392 | Attorney General Loretta Lynch., should be ashamed of herself, for meeting with Bill Clinton in the back of a plane for 39 mn while investigating his wife. She and the system have been fully exposed and Comey Has taken the first step to redemption. He should now present the information to a Grand Jury and let the chips fall where they might. These same people who are compaining now and calling fro Comey's head are the same ones who praised him after he knuckled under to the Clinton Machine.
15 | Geoff Smith | 11 | 1551606194859405_1551685251518166 | I wonder how many early voters for Hillary are kicking themselves right now???? Hillary Clinton is a snake and needs to go!! #DRAINTHESWAMP
16 | Laura Saylor | 8 | 1551606194859405_1551710341515657 | No one really cares about something all elected officials have always done whether it be in ink or email, especially the scandal ridden Republican party. (Just as they really didn't care about Bill Clinton's affairs but they knew it would strike a nerve with all the faux "Christians" out there. ) People are falling prey to the Republicans determined attempt to keep another Democrat (and especially a female one)  from winning the White House. To seriously think electing Donald Trump to lead this country is not only irrational but totally irresponsible. To jeopardize the safety and security of this country because you believe all the false and over blown pre-election nonsense is pathetic. Do your research and not just at right wing anti Hillary sites. Donald Trump is not the lesser of two evils. Hillary is the best candidate for the job.
17 | Pat Pusey | 0 | 1551606194859405_675069455993566 | October 30, 2016, 07:00 amEx-FBI official: Clintons are a 'crime family'By Harper NeidigA former FBI official said Sunday that Bill and Hillary Clinton are part of a ‚Äúcrime family‚Äù and argued top officials hindered the investigation into Hillary Clinton‚Äôs private email server while she was secretary of State.During a radio interview with John Catsimatidis, former assistant FBI director James Kallstrom heaped praise on Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump before taking aim at the Clintons.‚ÄúThe Clintons, that‚Äôs a crime family, basically,‚Äù Kallstrom said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like organized crime. I mean the Clinton Foundation is a cesspool.‚ÄùKallstrom, best known for leading the investigation into the explosion of TWA flight 800 in the late '90s, said that Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, was a ‚Äúpathological liar.‚ÄùHe also blasted Attorney General Loretta Lynch, claiming that she impeded the investigation into Clinton‚Äôs private server.‚ÄúThe problem here is this investigation was never a real investigation,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the problem. They never had a grand jury empanelled, and the reason they never had a grand jury empanelled, I‚Äôm sure, is Loretta Lynch would not go along with that.‚Äù ‚ÄúGod forbid we put someone like that in the White House,‚Äù he added of Clinton.Kallstrom also said that FBI Director James Comey and the rest of the FBI‚Äôs leadership were responsible for holding back the investigation, not the rest of the bureau.‚ÄúThe agents are furious with what‚Äôs going on, I know that for a fact,‚Äù he said.
18 | Anietie Usen | 1 | 1551606194859405_1633260336972002 | If God wants to punish America and make America small before the world, Trump will be elected. If God wants America to be ruled, ruined, led by the nose and humiliated by Russia, He will make Trump a president. But the rest of the world that love America and wouldn't want to see the downfall of America, would certainly celebrate the victory of Hillary Clinton. It is the perception of the rest of the world that Trump is a very lousy, morally decadent and irresponsible fellow. God cannot allow a fellow of Trump's calibre to become the leader of the free world. God forbid!
19 | Jen Boyd | 5 | 1551606194859405_674459362721242 | Blah blah blah. Everyone already knows who they are going to vote for. Everyone has already taken a side. Let's just get this over with. Your nasty messages slung back and forth at each other will do nothing to change anyone's mind. Just vote. Period.
20 | John Spaulding | 2 | 1551606194859405_1633293826968653 | Why is it we have heard about Hillary's emails forever, and no crime was found by the FBI, but Donald Trump has been sued for the rape of an underage girl and I have yet to hear anything from the major networks about this--even tho his court dat is only a month away!
21 | Babette Stone | 2 | 1551606194859405_674591682708010 | This nonsense about emails that might be pertinent is hogwash...it ANGERS me and should anger all of you and the GOP/H'ERR DRUMPF campaign have jumped on it like flies to horseshit...THE BIGGEST THREAT TO AMERICA AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE'S IS THE GOP AND TRUMP!

24 | Robert Walters | 0 | 1551606194859405_625467720965476 | Hillary Clinton is full of hot air. She isn't going to do anything for the American people. She's bought and paid for. Trump might actually be a better choice because you don't know what will happen with him. With her you already know... and it isn't good.
25 | Ginny Swartz | 2 | 1551606194859405_1633215303643172 | The Trump supporters support a man who preaches hate, lies over 70% of the time, cheated on at least two of his 3 wives, gropes women, stiffs his workers, contractors, students, investors, dishonors POWs, vets and the military, insults all minorities, discriminates against black buyers and renters, disrespects women, etc, And they are outraged at Clinton for deleting her personal emails? They are hopeless bigots. Simple!

2 | Lisa Carper | 202 | 1336558903107025_1336564746439774 | GO HRC!  Has everyone forgotten that Trump still has to answer his fraud charges, and the 12 women that might be suing him.  Atleast HRC is saying hey you have something to say FBI, then say it, I am here, go for it.  That is an innocent person that says that. GO HRC!
3 | Jennifer Mooney Smotherman | 28 | 1336558903107025_1336563963106519 | I hate that the media is reporting this as actual votes when in fact is just who has voted and what they registered as. I'd imagine in this particular election, not only is what one originally registered as not necessarily up to date, but there will also be crossing of party lines on both sides. Don't make yourselves look stupid by reporting "results" before they are actually results.
4 | Cheryl Norris | 23 | 1336558903107025_1336575473105368 | Hey MSNBC why are you not reporting or even mentioning the fraud case in Nov and rape case in Dec against Trump, stop sensationalizing and start reporting all things pertinent to this election. I thought your network once stood for the people and good of this country but not so much anymore, guess your owned by the 1% so all that went out of window and that is disgusting.
5 | Jackson Eggers | 28 | 1336558903107025_1336576539771928 | To the liberals and progressives out there. As you can see it is critical now more than ever that you get out and vote. My take on this new FBI investigation is that it is a political hit piece. It's a plot hatched by embarrassed FBI agents looking for revenge and Republicans trying to gain advantage by any means necessary. Think about it, what do the emails the feds have really say? No one knows because they won't release them. So why release a statement saying basically we are investigating, but we won't tell you what our new evidence is or why it is important. This is the kind of justice and government we can look forward to under President Trump with a Republican majority. They will use the power of government to harass and persecute all their enemies, real and imagined. If you want to fight against Trump and his politics of revenge, then you MUST get out and vote blue all the way down the ticket. You can make a difference.
6 | Fran Addesso | 42 | 1336558903107025_1336562819773300 | That investigation BS did nothing we coming out in force Clinton/Kaine!!!!!!!!!!!
7 | Suiyoobi Allen | 10 | 1336558903107025_1336612976434951 | Florida Gov. Rick Scott is working for a Trump Super Pac. He's doing everything he can to get Trump Florida. Having ballots thrown out. Wouldn't allow voters an extention for registration when the hurricane came in. Some places actually HID the Democrat ballots claiming only Republican ballots were available. Only after going to the manager were the Democrat ballots found buried in a closet.
8 | Cindy Brown | 3 | 1336558903107025_1336801106416138 | If you take Hillary at her word:She can‚Äôt recognize classified information when she sees it.She can‚Äôt tell the difference between a terror attack and a protest.She doesn‚Äôt understand how computers work.She can‚Äôt tell the difference between work related information and personal communications.She believes it is perfectly fine to accept money from foreign interests and then treat them more favorably.She has a terrible memory, particularly when under oath.She is not qualified to work at McDonald's let alone be POTUS.
9 | Kevin M. Carney | 8 | 1336558903107025_1336662703096645 | A gentleman named Bill Howell eloquently wrote the below letter.Dear Mr. Trump,It‚Äôs taken me a while to realize this and to admit it, but I‚Äôm grateful to you.For the past few months I‚Äôve spent a good deal of time lamenting your campaign and the poison it has so effortlessly generated. I‚Äôve watched our country imploding, our public discourse become polluted, our political climate grows ever more corrosive, and wrongly assumed you were to blame.It‚Äôs only lately I‚Äôve come to understand that you haven‚Äôt manufactured our current national ugliness‚Äîyou‚Äôve simply revealed it.By saying the irresponsible, mean-spirited, ignorant things you say so freely and so frequently, you‚Äôve given other like-minded people license to do the same. You‚Äôve opened up the floodgates for our corporate sewage to flow fully. People no longer conceal their vile mess, they now revel in it, they broadcast it and retweet it.You‚Äôve made bigotry and racism socially acceptable again and that has been a kind of twisted gift because it‚Äôs allowed me to really see people; not as they pretend to be on the surface‚Äîbut in the very depths of their wounded, weaponized hearts.Over and over as your campaign has persisted, your supporters would tell me that they like you because you ‚Äúspeak your mind‚Äù. It wasn‚Äôt until recently that I‚Äôve realized that you speak their minds. You‚Äôve given credence to their prejudices and made those prejudices go mainstream.Thanks to the terrible ground you‚Äôve broken, politicians, pastors, friends, and strangers, both in person and on social media now regularly out themselves as hateful, intolerant, and malicious‚Äîand they remind me just how close they are to me, just how deep the sickness in us runs, and just how far we have to go together.You‚Äôve emboldened people to be open about things they used to conceal for the sake of decorum, and though it turns my stomach, I know that this is the only way we can move forward; to have that cancerous stuff exposed fully so that it can be dealt with. Our progress as a nation is predicated on authentic dialogue, no matter how brutal and disheartening that dialogue is.In other words, you‚Äôve let us know what we‚Äôre really dealing with here and while it‚Äôs been rightly disturbing, it‚Äôs also been revelatory. That‚Äôs the thing about that kind of harsh light: you‚Äôre forced to see everything. Beauty and monstrosity equally illuminated.Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, I think you‚Äôre the least qualified, least knowledgeable Presidential candidate we may ever have had participate this far into the process, and if you somehow were elected I‚Äôd fear gravely for the world my children would inherit‚Äîshould it survive your Presidency at all. I believe you‚Äôre reckless, bitter, and completely reprehensible; the very worst kind of bully.But whether you win or lose, you‚Äôve already allowed me the blessing of Truth; about me, about you, about other candidates, about our nation.And in the process you‚Äôve also shown me that I am not alone in resisting you and this ugly thing you‚Äôve revealed about us.You‚Äôve generated an equally loud, equally passionate response to it and this is where I find my hope these days.I find it in those for whom equality isn‚Äôt just a cheap buzzword, it‚Äôs the most precious of hills to die on.I find it in those people who refuse to be silent in the face of our impending shared regression.I find it in those willing to be bolder in defending the inherent value of all people.I find it in the growing army of those who will not tolerate hatred as a core American value.I find it in those who reject violence as our default response to dissension.I find it in the ever rising voice of people who will not let malice and bitterness represent them in the world.Today I find my hope in those who, like me, will not be complicit in allowing bigotry and intolerance to become a source of national pride, because we‚Äôve seen where that leads.Yes, Mr Trump, you‚Äôve unearthed our hidden sickness and you‚Äôve allowed it to go viral.You brought every awful thing about us out into the open.You will NEVER Get My Vote!

If it changes then demand that it be corrected. Be very careful, reports of calibration errors have stopped but some poll workers have been in the news. These issues have affected both parties and amendments that are being voted on
17 | Carolyn Peterson | 1 | 1336558903107025_1336694613093454 | The DOJ needs to open an investigation into James Comey's involvement in a possible conspiracy with Jason Chaffetz to throw the election. This needs to be done before all the republicans involved have time to destroy the evidence and cover their tracks.
18 | Jeff Goin | 0 | 1336558903107025_1336607166435532 | How do we put someone in the white house who cheats people out of money, lies consistently, and demeans and disrespects women and treats them like sex objects? -- By voting for his wife for president, that's how.When you claim to have a sudden case of the "morals", remind me of this. Unless I remember you wanting to impeach Clinton some years ago.. just stop. You have no credibility when you justify some idiotic hypocrisy.

20 | Gary Alexander | 5 | 1336558903107025_1336570809772501 | Dear Hillary Supporter, Did you miss the part where she lied to congress? You know that‚Äôs called perjury‚Ä¶. Did you miss hearing about her being fired from the Watergate staff for being dishonest and unethical?How about those 33,000 emails she deleted and then had the computer wiped clean by professionals? Did you miss that? How about deleting emails after she was subpoenaed to hand them over to the Fed? You realize that‚Äôs Obstruction of Justice, right? Oh, and how about getting the rapist of a teenage girl off on rape charges then laughing about it? Did you miss that too?How about when she lied to the American people about Benghazi? You realize that story about the video was a lie, and she knew it was a lie, right?Did you miss her lying to the American people about her emails? How about when she lied about being under sniper fire?Well, then there was those times she lied about lying to the American people. Miss those too?What about that ‚Äòpay for play‚Äô with the Clinton Cash Foundation? That‚Äôs kind of hard to miss, huh?Did you miss all those other scandals she was in? You know‚Ä¶ TravelGate, FileGate, WhiteWater, Rose law Firm, Vince Foster‚Ä¶ she has a long list of scandals, you know... Did you miss her belittling her husband's sexual harassment ( and rape ) accusers? Oh ‚Äì but the Paula Jones case was settled for $850,000 and Bill was impeached‚Ä¶ for lying‚Ä¶You know she was labeled "Extremely careless" about national security by the FBI, right? Have you caught her latest lies about not knowing what the (C) meant on the classified documents? Or, that she can‚Äôt remember any briefings on how to handle classified material? Did you know that during her interview with the FBI she said she couldn‚Äôt remember 39 times? Did you know that during the Star Investigation she used that same defense of ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt recall‚Äô 56 times? Did you hear her say she will raise taxes on the middle class? Did you know she had to return stolen items from the White House the last time they left? Did you miss the fact that her and Bill Clinton stole 6 Billion Dollars that was meant to rebuild Haiti?Have you seen the movies and several documentaries made about her questionable ethics? Don‚Äôt you wonder why she made congress and others spend millions and millions of tax dollars having hearings and investigating her numerous times, finding that she lied, that would not have been spent if she would have simply told the truth in the first place ! Facts - all facts ! But you are going to vote for her because.... you don't like Donald Trump?Now, That is Insane!Hillary Clinton has a lot more to hide than Donald Trump does!
21 | Anthony Verrette | 1 | 1336558903107025_1336607879768794 | A CONUNDRUMThe definition of the word conundrum is something that is puzzling or confusing.Here are six conundrums of socialism in the United States of America:1. America is capitalist and greedy - yet half of the population is subsidized.2. Half of the population is subsidized - yet they think they are victims.3. They think they are victims - yet their representatives run the government.4. Their representatives run the government - yet the poor keep getting poorer.5. The poor keep getting poorer - yet they have things that people in other countries only dream about.6. They have things that people in other countries only dream about - yet they want America to be more like those other countries.Think about it! And that, my friends, pretty much sums up the USA in the 21st century.  Makes you wonder who is doing the math. These three short sentences tell you a lot about the direction of our current government and cultural environment:1. We are advised to NOT judge ALL Muslims by the actions of a few lunatics, but we are encouraged to judge ALL gun owners by the actions of a few lunatics.Funny how that works.  And here's another one worth considering... 2. Seems we constantly hear about how Social Security is going to run out of money. But we never hear about welfare or food stamps running out of money!   What's interesting is the first group "worked for" their money, but the second didn't.Think  about it ... and last but not least:3.  Why are we cutting benefits for our veterans, no pay raises for our military and cutting our army to a level lower than before WWII, but we are not stopping the payments or benefits to illegal aliens?Am I the only one missing something?"If you do not take an interest in the affairs of your government, then you are doomed to live under the rule of fools." - Plato
22 | Jeffrey Felix | 1 | 1336558903107025_1336743416421907 | I don't know why the Clinton Camp is crying about FBI director Comey reopening the criminal investigation of Hillary Clinton‚Äôs private server again. The FBI discovered thousands of top secret state department emails on Anthony Weiner (petifile) and his estranged wife's computer devices while doing a criminal investigation on the sexting of a 15 year old girl. Anthony Weiner's estranged wife was suppose to turn over ALL of the State Department emails that were sent to her from Hillary Clinton's private server to the FBI. Hillary Clinton is getting tons of free publicity.
23 | Craig Bradshaw | 0 | 1336558903107025_1336849043078011 | These polls change from week to week. That's what happens with "small" sample sizes.  The only consistency is that she is holding leads nationally, though they vary in lead size.
24 | Rick Speich | 1 | 1336558903107025_1336659916430257 | The Democrats motto in early voting states is "Vote Daily for Hillary without showing an I. D". Also Hillary is leading in the cemetery residence vote.
25 | Martha Olivares | 0 | 1336558903107025_1336635769766005 | Too close. Thanks MSNBC for jumping on the "horse race" theory with the rest of the media. Influencing and skewing the narrative.
