1 | Gordo Botaitis | 46 | 10154051945450950_10154051962610950 | Today is Nov 7 2016. After much research I have come to the conclusion that Hillary Clinton is the greatest threat to global security since the guy with the little moustache. Therefore I am hoping (on that basis alone) that The Donald wins tomorrow. #TrumpWins #ClintonCrooks
2 | Angelo V. Albino | 8 | 10154051945450950_10154051954105950 | - "Tomorrow is going to affect whether or not you have a government that brings about nuclear apocalypse, or continues human civilization."LOL, that's clearer.
3 | Bjorn Jones | 5 | 10154051945450950_10154051950995950 | I'm anti-Trump, but Hillary's lies, deceit, and hidden prejudices also demonstrate that she does not treat the American people with the dignity they deserve. Evan McMullin for President. :)
4 | Sandy Machell | 9 | 10154051945450950_10154051954420950 | Crazy uncle joe ,man with all the polls what are they worried about, but we do know the vote is up and we know Killary will never get the votes Obummer did , so Trump should have this in a landslide, unless it is rigged!!!!!!!!!!
5 | Tracee Ducker | 5 | 10154051945450950_10154051972955950 | It's not about a government treating the average person with dignity! It's about the special treatment the elite receive! We would have been locked up a long time ago!!!!
6 | Musthafa Mohamed Didi | 0 | 10154051945450950_10154051991040950 | They say dignity , but ultimately what is happening is shelling other nations and killing innocent people . Can we justify this as a dignified policy?
7 | Erin Scully | 1 | 10154051945450950_10154051986635950 | Our government already doesn't treat it's citizens with dignity, the results of tomorrow's election will not change anything.
8 | David Harkness | 0 | 10154051945450950_10154051998270950 | CBS , Biden has it right this time, tomorrow will change a lot of things, first its over for Biden and Obama and Hillary can go home. Second just think.
9 | William Johnson | 2 | 10154051945450950_10154051946780950 | After this election is over, Trump should enroll in Zoolander's school for kids who can't speak English good and can't do other stuff good too.
10 | Cyndee Branch Howard | 11 | 10154051945450950_10154051967745950 | Obama played his race card, Hillary's playing her woman card, so Americans are now playing their Trump card #TrumpforPresident
11 | Robin Perez | 0 | 10154051945450950_10154052000070950 | Why I’m Voting for Donald Trump in 2016For some young people going through this election cycle, including first-time voters, this last month before the elections is really a crazy one. Accusations flying back and forth, unlikable candidates on both sides, shifting loyalties among the party faithful, and a confused and tired populace throughout the country. So it’s important to find a way to quiet all the noise and think about what really matters. When you do, the choice becomes very clear. After doing this recently, I have decided to vote for Donald Trump. Here’s why.No one disagrees that these two candidates have questionable pasts; many feel that they are quite unlikable, even those in their own parties. And the feeling that voters are taking to the polls this year is that while they don’t agree with everything their candidate says or does, it seems to them that they are voting for “the lesser of two evils.” That’s totally understandable. But here’s another reason to consider your candidate, and why this year Trump has won my vote.I recently heard Dobson say that God puts people in critical roles and places at precisely the right time that they’re needed. And some time these folks are the not the most desirable, or likable, or proven people around – but somehow they get the job done. Three folks come to mind that illustrate this point.Moses was a shepherd who had killed a man when he was younger, and was doubtful he could lead anyone. Quite an unlikely “man of the hour.” But he ended up leading an entire people out of bondage and was one of the great leaders of his time.Winston Churchill was by all accounts a drunken buffoon who had made many bad calls in his life, was quite unlikable, and was not anyone’s first choice when it came to leading Great Britain. But when his country needed a leader most, he stepped up and reassured the British people, stiffened their resolve, and helped them withstand the Nazi threat and emerge victorious in WWII.In that same conflict, probably the most unlikable leader of all was General George Patton. He had a reputation for cursing, taking chances with his men’s lives, losing control of his temper, and showing off for the press. But General Eisenhower knew he was the man for the job in North Africa, and again in Europe when a breakout was most important. To this day he is regarded as one of America’s finest generals – the perfect person for the job, at exactly the right time.I don’t know what Trump will do in office if he is elected. But I do know what Hillary will do, based on her career history, her liberal politics and the way she treats those around her. And perhaps it’s just possible that Donald Trump - this very flawed, very controversial man – has been put in this position, at this specific time, to accomplish great things. Is it a risk? Sure, just as Churchill and Patton were potential risks. And these comparisons to those great men may not be valid; we’ll have to wait and see. But this man has a habit of getting things done, many times behind the scenes, usually ahead of schedule, and almost always under budget. That by itself would be a huge change in the way our country operates.We know what Hillary will do if she’s elected, and it is right for Americans to be concerned about the whittling away of their rights as Americans, and the acceleration of this process if she is elected. This issue, and the Supreme Court, are two HUGE reasons why it is more important than ever to not allow Hillary Clinton into the White House this November.Is Donald Trump a perfect candidate? Absolutely not. Is there a chance he could screw things up? Sure. But is it possible that he’s been placed in this position to do great things, improve this country’s standing in the world, get our economy back on track, and help turn back the progressive tide in this country that is threatening our way of life in America? It sure is. And that’s why he gets my vote.I’m willing to take a chance this November - one that may take you a bit out of your comfort zone. I hope you will do the same, and with hard work and a resolute optimism we will start to fix this country over the next 4-8 years. Over the last 8 years we were all promised Hope and Change and we have never been more divided. This is your chance to vote and get change that we have been waiting for.  If you feel the same way,  encourage them to really think about this election as a potential turning point for this country. Together, we CAN make a difference, and it starts with all of us doing the right thing for America.
12 | Debra Ann Tucker | 0 | 10154051945450950_10154051992940950 | Dignity!? GMAB! You've got it all wrong! How can anyone who is a thief have dignity? Her character is not what you see in the light. Behind closed doors she's a scorned pissed off woman who was thrown under the bus by Bill so now she is in retaliation mode. She doesn't care about the American ppl.
13 | Maria Perez | 4 | 10154051945450950_10154051965825950 | I'm all about live and let live. But this is getting crazy! For example, I have a friend who gets about $800 a month in social security. Her spouse can't work at this time, and his monthly insurance premium is jumping from @ $230 per month to about $750 per month. If she didn't take on a part time job, that would leave them with less than $50 a month to live on. So while the wealthy celebrities are stumping for Clinton, and the people on subsidized health care are voting for Clinton, the people who have worked all of their lives, and those of us in the middle class are getting screwed. I've seen people's names changed because they bought a new social security card illegally, I've been to the richest cities in the country with people sleeping on the sidewalks, I've been called racist because I don't agree with this administration, I've seen towers fall, and I've seen my hometown county turn into the 2nd most affected by meth and heroin in NY state, (of which Clinton was a Senator). I've watched videos of Clinton saying she was against gay marriage, that she was for a border wall, called young black men "super predators" and her outright lies about a little place called Benghazi. As I've said before, I don't know if Trump is the answer, but this woman, with all of the opportunity she has had to affect change, is definitely not the answer. She walked into Washington 40 plus years ago with the sole purpose to gain the Presidency. It's been about her the entire time. Kicked off the Watergate case for taking home documents, lying under oath, and the most recent admission of accepting an unreported gift of 1 million dollars from a foreign nation (that which you need to report). They left Haiti, still in ruins. This woman can't even wear an American flag pin, as to not offend her foreign counterparts. This is not the America my ancestors came here for. Scared to speak your mind, less control over your children's upbringing, and a new database with your private healthcare information going straight to the government. All true. All evidence based in fact. When Tuesday is over, one way or another it's gonna be scary. I just hope. I don't know what I hope. But I'm gonna have a back up plan.Wake up America! Drain the swamp!
14 | Laura Ollis | 1 | 10154051945450950_10154051989160950 | I don't care that she is a woman, because she's a deceitful POS and her and her rapist husband should never be allowed in the White House again.
15 | Yvonne Clerebout | 7 | 10154051945450950_10154051959855950 | I get a chuckle out of the libtards thinking that the Hildebeast will win because the FBI closed one of the two cases they have her on. Trump voters outnumber the brain dead by millions. We've got this! #spiritcooking #lolitaexpress #wikileaks #projectveritas #vincefoster #draintheswamp

Major revelations disseminated by WikiLeaks have allowed millions of people to see that Hillary and Bill have been far more corrupt than we ever have imagined.Just one day before the election, we can see that Hillary Clinton is wounded while Donald Trump is gaining strength.WikiLeaks has been on a nonstop campaign to release as much information as they can before the election on Tuesday, including a bombshell email chain indicating that top federal intelligence agents admitted that Hillary Clinton killed Vince Foster and Ron Brown.
18 | Jim Gavin | 5 | 10154051945450950_10154051947640950 | The only reason Hillary wants to be president is ambition. She's not qualified to be. She hasn't done anything to earn the job within even the political world, other than be married to a guy who has achieved as president but still was disgraced with sexual scandals.
19 | Gabriel James | 5 | 10154051945450950_10154051957950950 | Tomorrow is going to affect whether or not you keep Obamacare, increase un-vetted Syrian refugees by 550%, continue with "dreamed about" unrestricted borders, sanctuary cities, increased taxes, TPP and other deals like Cinton's NAFTA deal. Democrat and Republican establishment are terrified Trump will win. He'll be the new kid coming into the sandbox to kick over their sandcastles built with special interest corruption and pay to play politics.

Exterminate the black race because they are like "weeds". Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.If you are a Christian, why are you voting for Hillary Clinton when she wrote her Senior thesis on Saul Alinsky who dedicated his book Rules for Radicals to Lucifer, The Devil. She says he was and still is her mentor.If you are a Veteran, in the military, or closely related to a military member, why are you voting for Hillary when she left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again. They called for help but the help was told to stand down.If you have factory job, why are you voting for Hillary when she supported TPP and factory works are being laid off because jobs are going over sees. Don't forget the deals she made with china. She also welcomes open borders and illegals to get benefits with your tax money.If you are poor, why are you voting for Hillary, when she is supporting Wall street and all the big banks. Big banks keep the poor, poor by destroying the poor man's credit by allowing medical bills and collections to affect your credit scores so you can pay higher interest rates than the rich. Taking as much of the little money you earn.If you are a woman, how can you vote for Hillary when she has buried all of Bills rape victims under the rug including the little girl that was raped when she defended the rapist and laughed about it later.If you carry a gun, believe in the Constitution, how can you vote for Hillary when she wants to eliminate the NRA, Take your guns, and abolish the second amendment.If you breathe, why would you vote for Hillary when she has left a trail of dead people that did not agree with her or knew too much!Who is left?

1 | Josh Harrell | 237 | 10154051865985950_10154051872875950 | Trump would be more of a champion for the working class than HRC could ever be. Hillary doesn't care about anyone but herself.
2 | Elaine St Onge | 119 | 10154051865985950_10154051882205950 | why isn't he in the white house doing his friggin job instead of spending more of our tax dollars flying around to campaign for a evil woman?? I know cause he wants more of the same and she said she would do it. more obamacare, more taxes, more illegals and syrian refugees, more open borders, more job loss, more freebies off the backs of the worker, more classified secrets out there for all to see, more of us protecting other countries but not our own, and the list goes on, well WE CAN NOT AFFORD CLINTON !! trump2016
3 | Patricia Pierron-Hebert | 101 | 10154051865985950_10154051876070950 | Did you miss the part where she lied to congress? You know that’s called perjury….Did you miss hearing about her being fired from the Watergate staff for being dishonest and unethical?How about those 33,000 emails she deleted and then had the computer wiped clean by professionals? Did you miss that?How about deleting emails after she was subpoenaed to hand them over to the Fed? You realize that’s Obstruction of Justice, right?And why did she destroy 13 devices with a hammer and acid-wash e-mails? Oh, and how about getting the rapist of a teenage girl off on rape charges then laughing about it? Did you miss that too?How about when she lied to the American people about Benghazi? You realize that story about the video was a lie, and she knew it was a lie, right?Did you miss her lying to the American people about her emails?How about when she lied about being under sniper fire?Well, then there was those times she lied about lying to the American people. Miss those too?What about that ‘pay for play’ with the Clinton Cash Foundation? That’s kind of hard to miss, huh?Did you miss all those other scandals she was in? You know… TravelGate, FileGate, WhiteWater, Rose law Firm, Vince Foster… she has a long list of scandals, you know...Did you miss her belittling her husband's sexual harassment ( and rape ) accusers? Oh – but the Paula Jones case was settled for $850,000 and Bill was impeached… for lying…AND THEN, there’s the case of his illegitimate son, Danny Williams-Clinton, a son he made while keeping a black prostitute on retainer while he was still in Arkansas? You know she was labeled "Extremely careless" about national security by the FBI, right?And don’t you know there is evidence now that she cheated with the debates by getting questions ahead of time? Have you caught her latest lies about not knowing what the (C) meant on the classified documents? Or, that she can’t remember any briefings on how to handle classified material?Did you know that during her interview with the FBI she said she couldn’t remember 39 times?Did you know that during the Star Investigation she used that same defense of ‘I don’t recall’ 56 times?Did you hear her say she will raise taxes on the middle class? Did you know she had to return stolen items from the White House the last time they left?Did you miss the fact that her and Bill Clinton stole 6 Billion Dollars that was meant to rebuild Haiti?Have you seen the movies and several documentaries made about her questionable ethics?Don’t you wonder why she made congress and others spend millions and millions of tax dollars having hearings and investigating her numerous times, finding that she lied, that would not have been spent if she would have simply told the truth in the first place ! Facts - all facts !Don’t you wonder about all the illegal stuff she’s done that we don’t know?.......yet?  But you are going to vote for her because.... she's a woman or you don't like Donald Trump? Now, That is Insane! Hillary Clinton has a lot more to hide than Donald Trump does!
4 | Ed Bailey | 42 | 10154051865985950_10154051892855950 | Good grief! He should be doing HIS job, not campaigning for that witch. She won't be for the working people. She will be for special interests,and her Foundation. Democrats are nott for everyday Americans. They want control, and globalization. They are dangerous to our country.
5 | Gayla Taylor | 38 | 10154051865985950_10154051881230950 | She's only a "champion of people" because her campaign gave her that line. They said in their email exchange that she "hates average Americans"

11 | Brenda Gittemeier | 3 | 10154051865985950_10154051935450950 | Obama-- just 8 years ago you were quoted saying, "Hillary will say anything and change nothing. Hillary can't be trusted and isn't qualified to be President". It appears now your legacy is more important than the fate of our country.
12 | Gordon Taylor | 10 | 10154051865985950_10154051892775950 | CBS, you lost all credibility when you met secretly with the Clinton campaign. Walter Cronkite would be ashamed of what you've become.
13 | Jason Smith | 5 | 10154051865985950_10154051916680950 | The gap between Wall Street and mainstream widened under Obama. "But the dow jones is at record highs!" Great, so is the number of people on food stamps, and the number of people who have left the workforce, as well as the national debt.There's no reason to think that this will change under Clinton.
14 | Byron Wallace | 11 | 10154051865985950_10154051881755950 | Hillary Clinton donors own her, she is only loyal to them...it is not our interest she will prioritize it is the donors. She is paid for already
15 | Drew Weise | 1 | 10154051865985950_10154051943320950 | Fiscally liberal agendas will lead to a welfare state. Socially conservative agendas will lead to divisions among people and hate between different groups. I'm sticking with the party that is fiscally conservative and socially tolerant. Hopefully after the election, the millions of Republicans who disavow the party but still wants some fiscal responsibility and at the same time can handle having neighbors with different social values will join the libertarians
16 | Jessica Esteban | 4 | 10154051865985950_10154051925230950 | "Ultimately, I campaigned on changing Washington and bottom-up politics," Obama said. "And I don't want to send a message to the American people that there are two sets of standards -- one for powerful people and one for ordinary folks who are working every day and paying their taxes." Obama's 2009 interview with CNNSo after all the email released. Why is he still campaiging for Hillary?
17 | Alyson Maio Federico | 3 | 10154051865985950_10154051924570950 | Trump has employed more people as a private sector business man than Obama has done as president over the past 8 years. He's a disgrace! Have a look at unemployment among blacks and black youth! Way to go Obama...you failed the black people you promised the world too. And all they got was a lousy phone!

22 | Michael Braxton | 1 | 10154051865985950_10154051953295950 | Bill Clinton get away millions of jobs with the North American trade agreement which resulted in a recession.The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) dates the beginning of the recession as December 2007. According to the Department of Labor, roughly 8.7 million jobs were shed from February 2008 to February 2010, and GDP contracted by 5.1%, making the Great Recession the worst since the Great Depression.Wikileaks emails have revealed that Donna Brazile, the interim chairwoman of the DNC, provided Hillary Clinton with debate details that would give her an edge over Bernie Sanders.How quickly we forget!  If you’re over 35, take a walk with me down memory lane—you won’t believe what you have forgotten.  If you’re under 35, read on—I promise you that you will be amazed at what you missed!   (By the way, sadly, this isn’t a joke.   I wish it was.)WHEN BILL CLINTON WAS PRESIDENT. (January 20, 1993 to January 20, 2001—two terms)When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over an attempt to reform health care. Her proposed plan was so bad that many Democrats came up with competing plans of their own in protest, and in spite of threats and intimidation, on September 26, 1994, the “Hillarycare” bill was declared dead.This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million for studies, promotion, and other efforts.Then, President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general.  Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood—both were forced to withdraw their names from consideration.  Next, she chose Janet Reno, which husband Bill described as "my worst mistake."  (Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.)Husband Bill also allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission—Lani Guanier was her selection. After considerable backlash from prominent Democratic senators concerning Ms. Guanier's radical views, Bill Clinton withdrew her name from nomination, stating that she did not represents the civil rights views that he had championed during his campaign.However, apparently a slow learner, husband Bill continued to allow Hillary to make more recommendations. She chose former law partners, Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department. Her selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kennedy was forced to resign.  (Is anyone wondering yet what her Supreme Court Justice appointments would be like?)Many younger voters will have no knowledge of "Travelgate," the first major ethics controversy during Bill’s presidency.Hillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend, Harry Thompson—but the White House Travel Office refused to comply. She trumped up allegations of financial mismanagement and reported seven long-time White House employees to the FBI.  This ruined their reputations, got them fired, and caused a thirty-six month investigation. Eventually, most of the employees were reinstated and Clinton associates were forced out of the travel office. Only one White House employee, Billy Dale, was charged with a crime—the enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds;  a jury acquitted him in less than two hours.Still not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House Security.  When Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies (Filegate) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff, suddenly Hillary and the President denied even knowing Livingstone, and of course, denied knowledge of drug use in the White House.Following this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents.Next, when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by Bill Clinton, Hillary was put in charge of the "bimbo eruption" and scandal defense. Let’s look at some of her more notable decisions in this regard . . . She urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation, they settled with Ms. Jones.  She refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor.  After $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr's investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs.  Hillary's devious game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for 'lying under oath' to a grand jury, followed by his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives.  Hillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, "I do not recall," "I have no recollection," and "I don't know" a total of 56 times while under oath.   (Sound familiar?)  After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had "mistakenly thought was hers."So you see, the email scandal and all of her malfeasance regarding the handling of Top Secret information, not to mention the "pay to play" schemes of the Clinton Foundation, are nothing new.  Hillary’s entire political career has been nothing but a web of lies, corruption and destruction in her quest for power.Is anyone else ready to say, “Enough is enough!”?But unfortunately, I’m sure her loyal fans will say, "What difference does it make?"
23 | James Tinsley | 2 | 10154051865985950_10154051925695950 | Trump has created jobs in the private sector. Unlike Obama and Hillary....government does NOT create jobs but only hires to fill positions that are vacant for those government employees who decide to return to the private sector.
24 | Marissa HookemHorns | 4 | 10154051865985950_10154051905355950 | That's weird because the crowd in Michigan at trumps rally was so huge and the Facebook live feed reached a record of 115k viewers 🤔
25 | David Williams | 0 | 10154051865985950_10154051945520950 | Why in the hell do we have a president that is campaigning for a crooked politician? It is against the law for a president to campaign with somebody in the first place!!! Our president job is to protect United States and figure out how to solve the problems that are going on not to go out and be a cheerleader! I thought it was amazing and the first place for a president to sell health insurance! I really started 4 him to start selling cars! Let's get these people out of here and drain the swamp! Trump 2016

"We are a nation of immigrants and I am proud of it," said Clinton on immigration. This is how her administration would handle the issue.

1 | Alexandria Hill-Weikart | 102 | 10154051815710950_10154051829580950 | My vent for the day.... I get $112 too much a month to get Irelyn disability.... this is fucking bullshit! Her dad and I both work and pay our fucking taxes, which he pays like $20k a year in ss tax, and our daughter can't get it but these fucking refugees can get it! And they never worked a day in their fucking lives! So my daughter that has a real diagnose disability , she's not sitting on her fucking ass all day collecting welfare has to go without!!!! A child with disabilities is very expensive, to get her everything she needs cost an arm and leg, Remember this when you are voting! We can't  take care of the American people that are truly disabled, but we can give all these refugees and lazy as fucks free shit!!! This is fucked up! The average  family of five on welfare gets over $120k of free food, healthcare, social security, free housing, free utilities and money!! Than me a single mom of four can't bring in more than 2400 a month! FYI, Irelyns appts are $150 a pop 4x a week! That's 2400 a month!!! Almost All my income to just her appts!!!! How can we eat, live under a roof, or drive her there?!!!! Fuck all you people voting for Hillary! De friend yourself now, you are supporting families like me to go without, for illegals and refugees that never contributed to anything to this fucking country! These programs are tax dollar funded! They are supposed to be a hand up, not a hand out! I paid my share, and I work, and going to school to be a nurse to help those in need! God forbid I receive child support, the money doesn't cover everything! A blanket for my daughter alone was $300! I'm having a shitty day, and fuck you Hillary supporters!!!! She can use her foundation to support these refugees, oh wait it's not a charity foundation, it's a way to not be taxed and pay for expensive wedding for her daughter, to arm fucking Isis, to pay and play shit, for lawyers because she's fucking breaking the law every day....
2 | Ed Bailey | 34 | 10154051815710950_10154051838130950 | They need to come LEGALLY. The illegal ones need to be punished, at the very least, with a heavy fine. The border needs to be secure. I doubt this witch will do that. #BuildTheWall #Trump2016

4 | Pat Dillon | 21 | 10154051815710950_10154051830465950 | For the love of God, please shut up with the meaningless platitude, we are a nation of immigrants. Surely people are not that stupid to think this means we should be flooded with illegals. Is it not obvious to everybody that immigration is how democrats intend to gain permanent political power.? Are we really that stupid as a nation to not see this?? Or have people been so conditioned by the American public education system to hate republicans and conservatives, that they don't care how it gets done; just do it.
5 | David Richter | 8 | 10154051815710950_10154051882330950 | A nation of immigrants yes...but there are rules and laws for immigration that need to be followed. As for a path to citizenship, we have that, starting with a green card and through the process. The stupid thing is neither candidate seems to be focused on enforcing laws already in place same as with guns and other issues. Stop all the BS and just do what the law says.
6 | Mike McNeil | 11 | 10154051815710950_10154051828425950 | In just the last ten years 7 million people became US citizens, 13 million became legal residents, and roughly one million work visas are issued annually. ..apparently hillary, not everyone finds legal immigration too burdensome.

10 | Drew Weise | 0 | 10154051815710950_10154051943675950 | Fiscally liberal agendas will lead to a welfare state. Socially conservative agendas will lead to divisions among people and hate between different groups. I'm sticking with the party that is fiscally conservative and socially tolerant. Hopefully after the election, the millions of Republicans who disavow the party but still wants some fiscal responsibility and at the same time can handle having neighbors with different social values will join the libertarians
11 | Toni Z Klosse | 1 | 10154051815710950_10154051876515950 | The system IS rigged, not by actual individual votes, but by Media.  Remember this is Hillary, not Tea Leone playing Madam Secretary. Even shows like The Simpsons lean toward Hillary. The writers, networks, newscasters, etc, are swaying us toward a Hillary vote . This is how the election is rigged.  Of course, who do you think all the immigrants she and Obama let in plus the illegals are going to vote for!  Yes, Rigged!

14 | Cammie Nguyen | 2 | 10154051815710950_10154051912780950 | Taking a compassionate stance on immigration does not mean we are opening the doors to everyone. There are still procedures and regulations. But it's only HUMANE to help others in need. Especially when we are the richest, most powerful nation in the world. With power comes responsibility. Should we not be flattered that everyone wants to come to America to secure a better future for themselves and their families? Why? Because  America is the place you can do just that. So instead of pushing people away, let's embrace and work together.

Therefore, a serial sexual assaulter will be in the White House, whether one votes for Clinton or Trump (based on the logic of these people's reasoning).

When it is a formal occasion, I think it could also be "Ladies and Gentlemen The President, Hillary Clinton, and the former President, Bill Clinton". Once you are President, you are always referred to as "Mr. President". She will probably be addressed as "Madam President".
12 | Trina Donato Marta | 1 | 10154051662635950_540725292803878 | When addressing a former President of the United States in a formal setting, the correct form is “Mr. LastName.” (“President LastName” or “Mr. President” are terms reserved for the current head of state.)

20 | Maria Perez | 2 | 10154051662635950_10154051711940950 | I'm all about live and let live. But this is getting crazy! For example, I have a friend who gets about $800 a month in social security. Her spouse can't work at this time, and his monthly insurance premium is jumping from @ $230 per month to about $750 per month. If she didn't take on a part time job, that would leave them with less than $50 a month to live on. So while the wealthy celebrities are stumping for Clinton, and the people on subsidized health care are voting for Clinton, the people who have worked all of their lives, and those of us in the middle class are getting screwed. I've seen people's names changed because they bought a new social security card illegally, I've been to the richest cities in the country with people sleeping on the sidewalks, I've been called racist because I don't agree with this administration, I've seen towers fall, and I've seen my hometown county turn into the 2nd most affected by meth and heroin in NY state, (of which Clinton was a Senator). I've watched videos of Clinton saying she was against gay marriage, that she was for a border wall, called young black men "super predators" and her outright lies about a little place called Benghazi. As I've said before, I don't know if Trump is the answer, but this woman, with all of the opportunity she has had to affect change, is definitely not the answer. She walked into Washington 40 plus years ago with the sole purpose to gain the Presidency. It's been about her the entire time. Kicked off the Watergate case for taking home documents, lying under oath, and the most recent admission of accepting an unreported gift of 1 million dollars from a foreign nation (that which you need to report). They left Haiti, still in ruins. This woman can't even wear an American flag pin, as to not offend her foreign counterparts. This is not the America my ancestors came here for. Scared to speak your mind, less control over your children's upbringing, and a new database with your private healthcare information going straight to the government. All true. All evidence based in fact. When Tuesday is over, one way or another it's gonna be scary. I just hope. I don't know what I hope. But I'm gonna have a back up plan.Trump 2016
21 | Klaus Reck | 5 | 10154051662635950_540726709470403 | If you are Gay or lesbian, why would you want to vote for Hillary, when she gets millions from countries that will execute or in prison gays & lesbians?If you are Black, why are you voting for Hillary when she defends Planned Parenthood and admires Margaret Sanger, who wanted to abort as many black babies as possible and exterminate the black race, and Margaret Sanger said blacks are “morons,” “idiots,” “imbeciles,” “human weeds,” and “misfits.” Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.If you are a Woman, how can you vote for Hillary when she has buried all of Bill's rape victims under the rug. As an attorney, Hillary also defended the rapist of a 12-year old girl and laughed about it later. She plays the woman-card and acts entitled; implying that she deserves your vote merely because of her sex. How is that gender neutral?If you are a Miner, Steelworker or have a Factory job, why are you voting for Hillary when she supported NAFTA and TPP, and workers are being laid off because jobs are going overseas? She also welcomes open borders and illegals to get benefits with your tax money and compete for our jobs. Hillary boasts that under her administration miners and steelworkers will lose their jobs.If you are a Law abiding citizen, how can you vote for Hillary when she is clearly above the law? Hillary deleted thousands of secret e-mails *after* they had been subpoenaed by the courts (illegal). Hillary kept thousands of classified and top secret e-mails on her private server; servers that had less security that g-mail and Hotmail. You can be sure Russia, Iran, and China have those now. The DNC clearly broke the rules by heavy-handedly favoring Hillary over Sanders while they were still competing for the nomination.If you are a Veteran, in the military, or closely related to a military member, why are you voting for Hillary when she left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again? They called for help, but the help was told to stand down. Furthermore, Hillary wants to eliminate the NRA, take away your guns, and abolish the second amendment?Go Trump

23 | Greg Griffin | 2 | 10154051662635950_10154051779515950 | People of color believe the Democratic Party represents them.  Nothing could be farther from the truth.  Democratic policies have bogged down their communities with failed big government policies that have hurt more than they’ve helped for half a century now.  Democrats tell folks of color what they want to hear to secure their votes.  Once that happens, they forget about them until the next election.Actually, forget is too kind a term.  They outright ignore them.  Don’t think so?  Check their record over the last 50 years.  It’s abysmal.The hallmarks of the modern Democratic Party’s election messaging strategy are:1.	All non-Democrats are racists…or worse2.	Only the government can solve your problems…you’re not smart or strong enough to make it on your own3.	The United States Constitution is irrelevant…it’s a document that contains edicts and proclamations that have  outlived their usefulnessStronger together….right?  Not even close.  It’s a straight up message of divisiveness and hate.  It’s a message that will not soon be forgotten by 10s of millions of Americans who feel as if they’ve been negatively stereotyped for simply supporting a different political viewpoint.  This isn’t a step forward…it’s a huge leap backwards.This is the very thing people of color have been struggling to stop in American politics for decades.  Not only has the modern Democratic Party propagated this approach, they have gleefully embraced it.  And they’ve insidiously done so in the most destructive, socially repugnant way imaginable.They turned us on each other for votes. Choose wisely tomorrow, People.  YOUR children and grandchildren’s future depends on it.

Folks, the very system we trust has been highjacked by a criminal cartel headed by the clintons. the fbi has thrown us under the bus, the DOJ is driving the bus.

(The lettuce was an insult because it was said that his face and head looked like a lettuce) Rather than being angry, he held it and laughed at it, made jokes about his head and finished his speech. He would later win the presidency. I really want to say Taft but it could be someone like Cleveland or Arthur.

So I can make more millions by being a criminal and not going to jail because I'm above the laws. I wish I did this sooner so I didn't spend years of my life serving my country. I could have been a wimp and let others die for me. While I allow idiots to step on my flag and kneel when my country's anthem is played.

2 | Tom Mann | 5 | 10154051518580950_10154051549215950 | So, when it comes to "Bridgegate", courts have actually convicted Mr. Cristy's former aids on all counts...AKA: the courts have ruled that a crime was committed. But meanwhile, Cristy goes around calling Hillary a crook, even though she's never been convicted, let alone charged, with anything. And  yet, republicans think this guy would be a good attorney general.

So if I vote, will Immigration know where I live? Will they come for my family and deport us?” - Gina Rodriguez“Not true, and the reason is, first of all, when you vote, you are a citizen yourself. And there is not a situation where the voting rolls somehow are transferred over and people start investigating, etc. The sanctity of the vote is strictly confidential.” - Obama's answer.

2 | Bryan Corni | 185 | 10154051448775950_10154051452145950 | Let's not be politically correct. She was not a 'model'. She was a soft porn model.
3 | Gary M Malone | 104 | 10154051448775950_10154051511750950 | Interesting that Trump married a woman who's work visa expired, became an illegal alien, and then was allowed to stay and become a U.S. citizen after marrying Trump. So much disgusting hypocrisy from Trump and his racist deplorable supporters....

11 | Madeline Ivette Arroyo | 1 | 10154051448775950_10154051594450950 | Michael Wildes, has indicated that she first entered the United States on a business visitor visa in August 1996. She obtained an H-1B visa in October 1996. After that, she regularly returned to Slovenia to obtain a series of four more one-year work visas because, at the time, one-year visas were all that were permitted under the U.S. agreement with Slovenia. She obtained a green card and became a lawful permanent resident in 2001, applying as a model of “extraordinary ability”. She obtained U.S. citizenship in 2006, the year after her marriage.[

The only thing the Republican-majority Congress has done, is SEQUESTRATION -- cutting veterans benefits, etc... that is no reason to re-elect any Republican to Congress

Check your states website for eligible write in candidates and you should find Bernie's name if he had enough voters to nominate him. IF Trumpleforeskin wins due to all the divided votes, DON'T SAY SHIT. Women protect your pussies and Black people be prepared to fight racist who push you back to the 1800's by freely calling you nigger.

And what gets me is that so many before her did the same thing. But knowing she was running for office they had to have something.  And after 4 years of keeping anything from getting done they will once again say that nothing got done just like they have done to Obama.
5 | Katie Roberts | 0 | 10154051385585950_10154051632620950 | Problem is everyone is afraid of retaliation. If the investigation needs to continue, then she shouldn't be eligible to run for President. If it was anyone else, they would have been forced to revoke campaigning already. How can anyone vote for her to become the President of our country? This will be a disgrace to the United States if this woman is the first woman to become President.

After 30+ years in politics Hillary has a handful of celebrities backing her and the FBI looking into her affairs & foundation. Trump has the United States Military backing him along with the American Law Enforcement... Independent for Trump.! ( my healthcare doubles in 2017 also)

12 | Alan Elnick | 0 | 10154051385585950_10154051436875950 | States of PlayWashington State may be among the more interesting watches tomorrow evening as the election results come in. Bernie Sanders won the Democratic Primary with over 70% of the vote Trump won the Republican Primary with over 75% of the vote. Two Democratic electors have announced they will not give Hillary Clinton their electoral vote should she win the state, this despite a $1,000. fine for not voting the popular will. Of course in Seattle, Everett to be more precise, is Boeing, the largest private employer in the state. Boeing's chief competition is Airbus in Europe. Subsidies to Airbus in Europe, particularly nearly interest free loans, and payback terms timed to actual delivery of product (if payback is even required), has put Boeing at a competitive disadvantage. Despite efforts to file for an even playing field at the World Trade Organization, effectively, no response has been obtained. Boeing, while a proponent of International Trade, wants Fair Trade, sound familiar? If the Democratic firewall is broken in Seattle, the state is Republican.Minnesota, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin are all in play. The great fallacy of all the pundits' arguments we keep hearing on all stations, is that the Democratic turnout will be high. They tend to record that in Hillary's pocket. In these states particularly, If Democrats vote in numbers, not much greater than 70% will vote for Hillary Clinton. The rest will either simply vote down ticket or for Trump. These are the Blue Dog states. Republicans will vote in excess of 90% for the Republican nominee. African American turnout will likely be much less than 2012, and the best Hillary can count on from African Americans is 70%, they are very lukewarm towards her.Tomorrow night should be more interesting from what we have not been told, than from the pablum the MSM has been feeding us.
13 | Klaus Reck | 0 | 10154051385585950_10154051829905950 | If you are Gay or lesbian, why would you want to vote for Hillary, when she gets millions from countries that will execute or in prison gays & lesbians?If you are Black, why are you voting for Hillary when she defends Planned Parenthood and admires Margaret Sanger, who wanted to abort as many black babies as possible and exterminate the black race, and Margaret Sanger said blacks are “morons,” “idiots,” “imbeciles,” “human weeds,” and “misfits.” Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.If you are a Woman, how can you vote for Hillary when she has buried all of Bill's rape victims under the rug. As an attorney, Hillary also defended the rapist of a 12-year old girl and laughed about it later. She plays the woman-card and acts entitled; implying that she deserves your vote merely because of her sex. How is that gender neutral?If you are a Miner, Steelworker or have a Factory job, why are you voting for Hillary when she supported NAFTA and TPP, and workers are being laid off because jobs are going overseas? She also welcomes open borders and illegals to get benefits with your tax money and compete for our jobs. Hillary boasts that under her administration miners and steelworkers will lose their jobs.If you are a Law abiding citizen, how can you vote for Hillary when she is clearly above the law? Hillary deleted thousands of secret e-mails *after* they had been subpoenaed by the courts (illegal). Hillary kept thousands of classified and top secret e-mails on her private server; servers that had less security that g-mail and Hotmail. You can be sure Russia, Iran, and China have those now. The DNC clearly broke the rules by heavy-handedly favoring Hillary over Sanders while they were still competing for the nomination.If you are a Veteran, in the military, or closely related to a military member, why are you voting for Hillary when she left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again? They called for help, but the help was told to stand down. Furthermore, Hillary wants to eliminate the NRA, take away your guns, and abolish the second amendment?Go Trump
14 | Jacki Watkins | 6 | 10154051385585950_10154051398850950 | gotta keep beating that poor old dead horse...VOTE 'EM THE HELL OUT.  we have to take back the House and Senate, or this is all they will do for 4 years!!!

Hillary Clinton has "established a lead in some states" that Donald Trump won't be able to overcome, Robby Mook said.

He had a plan to bring Al-Qaida, Isis, Libya, Syria, Lebanon, Iran, and all supporting outside factors to the Peace Table. He waited, and waited, and waited, it everyone refused to even entertain such a foolish, never going to happen in a million years, shot in the dark.Thousands, upon thousands of American dead and wounded beyond believe. Possibly 10’ of thousands, to 100’s of thousand civilians dead or wounded beyond belief. Millions displaced refugees, sick old woman, children, sent out into the world without, food, water, shelter, and a slim chance in hell to survive. Only to be beheaded, castrated, buried alive, and tortured. All the while, the kings and queens of the world danced and partied with Champaign and caviar to the beat of a different drummer. Just like decades and upon decades before.Mr. President Truman, would not have let this happen. Mr. Roosevelt, would not have permitted this to happen, as well as Mr. President Eisenhower, or Mr. President Kennedy would both not have permitted this all to happen. So why does, Mr. Barrack Hussein Obama, and Mr. Impeached Mr. Bill (Blyth), (I did not have sexual relations with that woman) permit it to happen. As well as the G. Bush family permit it all to start happening all over again.This far East Asian part of the world has been in this same, turmoil for over centuries and not a single president, not less a Democratic one has ever figured it out! But The Clintons have with their, Pay to Play Foundation)! A political 3, 4, or even 5-decade savvy politician, can never figure it out, because they are just politicians, and their jobs would end if they did figure it out.Just remember, just about everyone in both houses, from the front door to the side doors and the back doors all have two things in common. A. They are mostly all lawyer. And B. They are mostly all lawyer.http://frankseldenlaw.com/lawyer_jokes/

I am heartbroken that so many people would rather stay ignorant to the truth and blindly follow Hilary and not read ONE DAMN EMAIL that was leaked!!! How can you love America & continue to support a woman who has sold our country out?!? HOW?!? This election has uncovered a lot of truth & so have these LEAKED EMAILS:: TRUTH that Hilary broke the law by having a server & having TOP SECRET, CLASSIFIED Information on her server; which she used BleachBit to wipe clean (not with a cloth!); Hilary had 13 devices (not one for convenience like she lied about) & confessed to smashing them with a hammer; she told the FBI that she didn't remember what Classified meant; that Hilary will LIE TO YOUR FACE while you bury your child that she helped kill in Benghazi; Hilary hates Catholics, Gays, Arabs, Bernie Supporters & blacks (those super predators); Obama made sure the FBI didn't indite Hilary & emailed her knowing she had a private email account-(proving he also broke the law & KNEW she was breaking the law!); had Bill Clinton secretly meet with the DOJ Loretta Lynch on the airport Tarmac which was NOT about discussing grandchildren for over 30 minutes; the State department tried to BRIBE the FBI to Declassify some of Hilary's emails; the DNC rigged the system & stole the election from Bernie; tried to ruin Trump with sexual allegations that couldn't be denounced and proven false in time before the election- KNOWING that such allegations would be harmful even though they were NOT TRUE & that she tried to destroy the women who made sexual assault allegations about her husband; the democrat party has set up people to fight at Trump rallies and to incite violence & have PAID THEM TO DO SO; Dead Democrats are voting & George Soros (who OWNS Hilary) is linked to voting machines in 16 states that have major electoral college counts; truth that Hillary can sell her position at SOS & give favors to other countries through the Clinton Foundation for millions of dollars: Hilary & Bill have sold out our country for MILLIONS of dollars to Countries that SHE KNEW WERE FUNDING ISIS!!!! AND NOW....We are seeing all over the Internet that when the NYPD obtained Anthony Weiner's laptop there were emails from Hillary & Huma stored on it, evidence of bribery, treason, & child sex trafficking! This has been "leaked" all over the web and if this proves true & you voted for this woman YOU will have played a part in nominating a evil beast to run your country!How in the hell can you support the continued corruption in our government?!? If Hilary wins there will be NOTHING nor No branch of government to stop her!!! She has already proven that!!! Please take off your Republican & Democrat hat & start thinking like an American!!!  Read the damn emails and stop swallowing the bullcrap the democrat party, Hilary & the main stream media are shoveling down your throats!!! Think like an American  & pick back up those "principles" that you gave up to support the corruption of these "Political Parties"!!! This is NOT about "right" versus "left"...this is about WRONG VERSUS RIGHT!!This country is on her knees, with her head bent down and Hilary is holding the killing sword!!!!

1 | Jason Kerry | 3 | 10154051270135950_10154051323825950 | "the ad cuts together video clips of billionaire George Soros, Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen and Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyn Blankfein -- all of whom are Jewish"I don't think Trump produces his own commercials. Regardless, this is a hyper-sensitive response. Perhaps the ADL is advocating that Jews avoid taking influential positions or succeeding in life
2 | Carrie Smith | 0 | 10154051270135950_10154051666820950 | I saw this ad and did not think anti-Semitic.  First of all I did not know those people were Jewish.  In the United States religion does not matter.  In the second place this campaign is about money in government and how the billionaires are running the government. Some people need to get a life!   And vote Hillary Clinton!!
3 | Welsh Jhoulys | 0 | 10154051270135950_10154051291845950 | The supreme court considers this a tax. Defeat Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. My platform is simple. Hybrid Cap-Capitalism with Social Healthcare? Here is what we are looking at, a 10M Capitalism Cap. All income and combined assets above 10 Million will be absorbed by our U.S. Government. ( Except one residence or farm could be grand-fathered at a 1 Million Max Assessment) Proceeds go to Single Payer Quality Health Care, Inner City Job creation through manufacturing and National Debt. Management. (So, yes, we would have one sector of our Economy under socialist framework instead of all of it under Fascist Socialism) Borders would be tight to keep our Federal Elections legal and Health Care system solvent. "Because there comes a point where money has no real utility for Billionaires." Thank You, President Obama (Final UN Address) for your work and input on this. And my good friend Warren Buffet for his wise words. A solution for people that really care. Hillary was just there to handle the masses for super-rich domestic and foreign donors? Now she is going away. Write in Hybrid Cap-Capitalism for President and Democracy for Vice-President.

The teflon Clinton's have powerful connections that allow them to coerce or bribe their way out of every cesspool of corruption that they continue to wallow in.

I would never have known that the people in the video were Jewish... ""For examples of the powerful elites, the ad cuts together video clips of billionaire George Soros, Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen and Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyn Blankfein -- all of whom are Jewish.""And why would it make a difference? Are you supposed to step back form your comment on who and what you think is wrong because they are of a certain ethnicity?

23 | Michael Larabell | 0 | 10154051270135950_10154051421575950 | Why I am voting for Donald Trump without mention Hillary. I challenge anyone supporting Hillary to do the same without mention Bill or Trump. 1. Stop the inflow of illegals coming over our boarders, putting a major strain on the cities, states and our country. We are already going broke. We can not afford to provide these people with food, shelter, schooling and medical care. 2. Stop the inflow of refugees that have not been screened. To much of a chance if ISIS or any other terrorist group to gain entry to our country. 3. Abolish and replace Obamacare. Millions of middle class families are forced to paying thousands of dollars for Obamacare and will never meet their yearly deductible, thus still having to pay out of pocket for all of their medical care. This is billions of dollars that could be spent growing our economy. 4. Trump owes nobody any favors in Washington. He is already filthy rich, so he does not have to accept donations from anybody including foreign countries in exchange for political favors. 5. He is not afraid to call anyone out if they are wrong regardless to what party they belong to. 6. Our companies are so over regulated that billions and billions of dollars are wasted trying to keep up and follow all of the executive orders that need to be over turned. 7. Bring our companies back home. We need to have it so companies can operate in this country without being over taxed. The jobs that will be created will pay more in taxes than what we will lose by lowering the cooperate tax rate putting more money to work growing our economy. 8. Renegotiate our trade agreements with other countries to make it more fair for American companies selling goods in other countries. 9. Bring law and order back to out country. Nobody is above the law regardless of who you are and who you know. 10. Secure funding for the schools and work training for the inner city communities.

If you are a Christian, or have a Family, or are soon to "retire", or are a member of the Military, or are just an ordinary HONEST American......, NOT voting is NOT an option ! You HAVE to get out and VOTE for Trump ! Do NOT believe the LIES about Trump ! NOT Voting, will help Hillary Clinton win ! The last time Hillary moved out of the White house, she STOLE over $200,000.00 worth of White House Property ! And her husband used the OVAL office as his own personal "Sex Dungeon" ! Help us SAVE America !
25 | Denise A Spencer | 3 | 10154051270135950_10154051315890950 | So now we learn from the Republican FBI Director that there is nothing criminal about Hillary's email...It's all just a made up story to get Trump and republicans elected as they can't run on their policy of giving tax cuts to the rich.The right wing media is also to blame for hyping this non story for republican distractions.

Donald Trump has six paths to obtain the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency, his campaign manager explained.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Alan Cabrera | 185 | 10154051238085950_10154051241610950 | Donald Trump has no paths. He has no policies he has nothing. We need someone who can actually get something done and look for our well being. Stop and Frisk Donald Trump!!
2 | Laura Thaxton | 149 | 10154051238085950_10154051239875950 | Sorry Trump supporters but Trump won't win. Clinton is already at 275 electoral votes and Trump is at 188. And I'm sure you know you need 270 to win. And if that doesn't convince you look at it like this... Florida, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin are all leaning towards Hillary. And if she wins Florida alone she wins the presidency. And so far early voting puts Florida in Hillarys favor. And if by some chance Trump does win Florida he still wouldn't have enough to win the presidency. He'll need to turn at least 3 or 4 other states that are already blue or leaning blue his way. Which at this point is near impossible
3 | Dean Roger Miller | 85 | 10154051238085950_10154051256090950 | This woman is exactly what is wrong with our current political system. She is a paid professional who spins and lies about everything
4 | Adrian Sharp | 53 | 10154051238085950_10154051264980950 | I do hope Kellyanne and the rest of the Trump campaign got paid in advance! Given his track record, I can't see anyone getting paid if (when) he loses ....
5 | Bill McKetrick | 34 | 10154051238085950_10154051261430950 | I can't understand why any of the news networks continue to give this skank a platform for her bullshit, considering she's done nothing but lie and obfuscate since she became Trump's Campaign Director. Hopefully, after Clinton wins on Tuesday.....Conway will crawl back under whatever rock it is she crawled out from.......
6 | Doug Donoho | 28 | 10154051238085950_10154051275115950 | Can't wait for the day when Trump surrogates and Trump go by the wayside. Although Trump is an attention whore, much like the Kardashians, I am sure he will fight to remain in the spotlight. Probably even launching Trump TV. Please, make it all go away.
7 | Alex Mogo | 25 | 10154051238085950_10154051251330950 | Not enough bigot vote to win TRUMP bigots. Your kind will be rolled over with one swipe easily tomorrow . The landslide has started. I am embarrassed to be in the same species as TRUMP supporters.  Back to your deporable caves and rot!! TRUMP exposed and unmasked the bigotry behind the Republicans  for life. Now lets go win and kick as in 2018. Hillary will not stand and just take the punches , bring it on bitches.
8 | VP Miner | 11 | 10154051238085950_10154051345875950 | This is THE MOST ignorant female in all of these United States. She sounds like a drug addict in denial when she speaks for him. It's sad to see a human bend so low and she does it thinking she is doing something good..ignorant or stupid?

10 | Jeff Autrey | 19 | 10154051238085950_10154051254165950 | The way I look at it is Mitt Romney was a hundred times better candidate than Donald Trump we must remember Romney had the entire Republican party supporting him and Trump is already doing far worse than Romney was at this point in the race. His defeat ill trump that of Barry Goldwater.
11 | John Foster | 19 | 10154051238085950_10154051241640950 | Hillary Clinton will win in a landslide. Don the con gets beat by a girl!!! Ha ha ha!
12 | Caryn Dalton | 3 | 10154051238085950_10154051360860950 | Interesting that everyone is calling CBS the Clinton Broadcast System when CBS caters to Kellyanne Conway for Trump all the time. Rarely is Clinton's spokesperson brought on and when he is it is via satellite.
13 | Louis Morningstar | 5 | 10154051238085950_10154051329570950 | The Hispanic, Black, Muslim and the female voters and whoever else Trump has insulted will blow him out of the water tommorrow! 😈
14 | Christian Torres | 22 | 10154051238085950_10154051241925950 | Trump is a pathetic,desperate pathological liar who will throw his red meat out there and see who will eat it up...now you see why he said, "I love stupid people, they will believe anything I say."and "stupid people love me. " How is it Presidential to incite hatred, violence, fighting, and even murder: If any people have not figured out that Trump is a lying fraud by now... they are either complete morons or racists who just like his nasty attacks and feeling they have a voice. What a spoiled little baby brat...wah wah, everybody is cheating, picking on me, misleading, not playing fair...the whole system is rigged...HE IS PSYCHOTIC !!!

16 | Mark Flynn | 2 | 10154051238085950_10154051499495950 | Only one way only one path does he have to win this election and that's if by tomorrow he somehow builds a death star or some other doomsday device and holds the world to ransom. He's hanging in there alright. Come Wednesday that prospect that the world will finally be able to call him a loser will taste so sweet
17 | Robert Arredondo | 2 | 10154051238085950_10154051497225950 | I just heard Kellyanne Conway state on CBS This Morning with Gayle that the "Dems. went low so they went, "medium to high"!!! Hmmm....that sounds familiar. LOL

19 | Cindy Fuller | 5 | 10154051238085950_10154051291745950 | Love the way the Hillary Supporters want to do nothing to educate themselves on their candidate. They blindly follow her lead by calling anyone that doesn't cow tow to her by horrible names. I asked early on in this race why I should vote for her. I also asked why I should vote for Trump. I asked that they give me solid evidence for their decision. I also asked that they not bash the other side. I truly was undecided and going to vote for a 3rd party. Guess what happened? Hillary supporters were vicious, name calling, and couldn't give me one good reason (except 1 man gave good answers without bashing). Trump supporters made very compelling and intelligent answers. Then I listened to the 3rd debate and when Hillary started talking about how okay it was to have an abortion just days before the due date and that she knew people that had to make this horrific decision with their family, I knew she was lying. If you have carried a baby that long and then your life becomes in jeopardy it will be in jeopardy whether you kill the baby before you deliver or give birth! That made me cry and I lost any respect or compassion I had for Her! Never would I vote for her!
20 | Cindy Barber Mckeon | 2 | 10154051238085950_10154051426195950 | I've watched cbs all my life. During this campaign I've given them the benefit of the doubt but I've seen nothing but biased reporting. I've waited to see if at any point you would report fairly and as of today, the day before Election Day you still are one sided. Therefore, you will never be on my TV again. You forever lost a viewer. Sadly, I was not even any specific party. I just don't feel a news station has the right to pick sides.
21 | Kathie Myles | 2 | 10154051238085950_10154051276295950 | This late in the game I doubt it he so stupid and you know what his campaign manager looks like all she does is an alcoholic and drugs no matter how much you dress her up she looks like a drug attic

In the crucial Sunshine State battleground, many voters say they'll vote for Clinton in 2016, but against her in 2020.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Tom Belkowski | 44 | 10154051209865950_10154051231475950 | I've already voted for Clinton, and would still vote for her. But, I won't commit to 2020 until i see what she's accomplished and I know who else running. As far as Rubio is concerned. Not now. Not ever. Never!
2 | Donna Marie | 22 | 10154051209865950_10154051252170950 | I'm confused...We had this huge scandal about Clintons campaign inciting violence. The voter fraud going on-its in the Wikileaks emails and on video.Four men killed in Benghazi under her watch that she lied about. Clinton's emails on her own personal server deleted, bleach bit used and her devices trashed by hammers.She is in this election because she cheated out Bernie. It's been proven. Her Clinton Foundation has made over 2 billion dollars and only 10-15% of that has gone to those it was raised for and that is still under investigation.At the last debate she told the world our classified information regarding the timing of our nuclear response.She has accepted large amounts of money from middle eastern countries that kill gays and stone women for her campaign. She has had top 'you tubers' at huge events (some say they were paid) taking selfies with these young girls.These top you tubers have large followings.  Smart or illegal campaigning? She's dishonest-you decide.Her own Secret Service agents have said how much they hated that detail because she was so difficult to work with. She's a charmer!She claimed multiple times that she had to run for her life because her plane landed under SNIPER FIRE in Bosnia. That was debunked long ago but the fact remains that she's a liar. She has lied under oath and she gets her passes from our own FBI and The Justice Dept twice!Loretta Lynch had what she thought a private meeting on a jet with Bill Clinton in the middle of an airport while Hillary was still under investigation!This is less than half of what this woman has done.So surprising that she's still on the campaign trail and  not it in a courtroom being sentenced!So yes I'm confused..How can anyone still vote for her?
3 | Jj Hoffer | 16 | 10154051209865950_10154051249605950 | I just know this country can not withstand 4 more years of Obama which is what you will get voting for Hillary.I don't understand why people can not see the mess Obama made.People are all divided.Not good.
4 | Peggy Ann Clark Clark | 9 | 10154051209865950_10154051281560950 | There are soo many here in FL that have voted & want nothing to do w/HC & her lies, corruption/bengazi.. We will not vote for a felon now or in 4 yrs....Who wants a criminal as PRES?
5 | Mandy Reynolds | 5 | 10154051209865950_10154051235170950 | Described as a 'FBI hiccup.'  This country is in horrible trouble. I know I made the right decision to not have children. God help your children and grandchildren. They are the ones who are going to pay dearly for your ignorance.

10 | Melissa Jo Walker | 6 | 10154051209865950_10154051224685950 | Wikileak s emails out of the DNC reveal a plan to paint Donald Trump as a sexual predator with ties to Putin. None of these emails have been proven false. The liberal secular humanist mind is not tied to truth. The means justifies the ends. Hillary is the most corrupt candidate ever to run for office. The Clinton Foundation is in collusion with the Government for regime change and gun running operations and kick backs around the world. There is no rule of law in our Government right now, the media has worked with the CIA in the regime change propaganda operations. They cannot have Trump become president because he will bring down the entire machine. Even Obama used the server. Many people in our Government are guilty of felonies and treason.This election is about American nationalist patriots vs the NWO and their programmed. Which are you?The image of Trump is a media propaganda construct. In the Alinsky process what you are guilty of you place  on the enemy to try and keep the focus off of you. Hillary' s Ex secret service details believe she is a violent sociopath who will be a dictator. The Clinton Foundation is in collusion with many many aspects of the Government for regime change gun running and kick backs around the globe so many people are paid for or blackmailed..." One who fears corruption fears life."Alinsky Clinton's pen palTrump is a blue collar billionaire who due to his status was tempted on many levels. With all of the temptation I am surprised through all their digging they have not found much more. He is 70 years old. Those who accuse him of groping have no evidence. The one who accused him of rape has dropped her case. At around the same time Hillary was calling black children super-predators without empathy or conscience and talking about building a wall and having distain for illegal immigrants on street corners waiting for jobs that she said they should not be allowed to have. At the same time she was praising Senator Byrd a member of the KKK and Margaret Sanger who called for the extermination of the black race, calling Jews F...en jews, using the word nigger, calling mentally disabled children retards, being involved in scandal after scandal in which fall guys went to prison, left the country or died, Trump was...Receiving the New York Ellis island award for his dedication to ethnic causes, being praised by Jesse Jackson for his real estate donations and dedication to Jesse Jackson s Rainbow push program. At the same time Hillary was paying for access to all white country clubs he was suing the cronies in Palm Beach for not allowing blacks and Jews into their Clubs. Did Hillary ever speak out about blacks and Jews not being allowed into the Clubs she belonged to?Trump was sued over an apartment dispute that was racially motivated during a time the Government begin to push unfunded mandates on apartment owner to rent to minorities. It was around the same time section 8 was going to start up. Trumps dads apartments were made an example of along with many other owners in New York because of the size of the complex.Did he receive the Ellis island award before or after the apartment scandal?Did he receive the accolades From Jesse Jackson before or after the apartment scandal?Did he sue the cronies in Palm Beach before or after the apartment scandal?The media has created an all out war against Trump through dis honesty. Trump did not make fun of a disability that a reporter had. He has family members with disabilities. Trump mimicked someone who was caught in a lie and back peddling in a story. He has made the same movements over and over again to express different people lying and back peddling. The reporters condition is a paralysis of the hand. There is no movement. By definition Trump could not have mimicked the reporter unless he mimicked the static paralysis which he did not.Trump did not attack the Son of Gold Star parents. The DNC knew that Mr Kahn followed and was an expert on sharia law. Trumps response to Mr. Kahn and his wife was because Trump has people on his team who know the Muslim plan for sharia law in America. He was most likely very frustrated by what he saw knowing the plan behind it. Those who follow sharia have a goal of a world wide Caliphate.  Only in an Obama and Hillary world can a sharia following Muslim who makes money through the refugee program attack Trump by referring to the Constitution. Article 6 of the Constitution outlaws sharia law. What the media and Hillary and the DNC does is to count on the stupidity of the general public.In order to be a racist you have to fall under the definition of a racist not the contrived emotional response the media propaganda machine, the DNC, and Hillary want you to believe. Did Hillary think Trump was a racist before or after she went to his wedding? A racist believes his race is superior to all others.Trumps response to the judge hearing the Trump University case was not racist. The judge was pro open borders and illegal immigration and his wife is tied to the Clinton Foundation. This is a conflict of interest to one who wants legal immigration and wants to build a wall. It is illegal immigrants that hurts the job market of legal immigrants.When Trump referred to the Mexicans coming across the border, a percentage being rapist and murderers he did so in the context of illegal immigrants and sanctuary cities. Do you want the MS 13 EX military hit squads and drug runners to have a revolving door into America?In order to be misogynist you have to hate woman. Trump treats woman and men equally. His company has more woman in high level positions than most. Out of over 500 companies 6 have gone bankrupt during tumultuous times.  Rosie O'Donald attacked his family so Trump wearing his heart on his sleeve attacked her. He says what he thinks, sometimes tooo much. He does not have the contrived pathological liar thought process of Hillary or Obama. There is no evidence that Trump ever called Ms Machado Ms Piggy and even if he did it does not follow under the definition of misogynist. There is evidence that he argued with the board of the pageant and saved her job. Her history is terrible yet Hillary parades her around counting on the stupidity of the masses falling for the deception.  Hillary is parading this woman around counting on the stupidity and laziness of the public. Your own ego is your worst enemy that they will use against you. 11 years ago the blue collar billionaire trying to impress some so called friends said some stupid words about sexual conquests. I have heard that woman in locker rooms and strip clubs say pretty much the same about men. Trump apologised for what he said. Trump is a flawed man on a spiritual journey. I believe because of realizing what he is up against and the Christians he has surrounded himself with, this spiritual journey is leading him to great things.
11 | David Throop | 0 | 10154051209865950_10154051258385950 | Will in 2016 but already saying they won't in 2020? That's an awful presumptive stance to take at this point. If she wins she could make an outstanding president. Even if things just continue to hum along unremarkably and the field in 2020 is no better wouldn't she likewise garner support then too?

Racism against blacks (super predators), Hispanics (taco bowl voters), Jews, homosexuals, targeting Sanders, sending protesters out to target Trump, discussing placing craigslist ads to frame Trump, Selling federal positions for donations (isn't that a crime), media collusion, saying Hillary wanted to keep her voters ignorant and much more. Will the FBI investigate (Clinton Cash) Hillary selling off America and farmers/ranchers being harassed and/or killed for their land? Oh and Hillary does pay trolls to comment on social media on her behalf.
13 | Laura Thaxton | 3 | 10154051209865950_10154051224175950 | Sorry Trump supporters but Trump won't win. Clinton is already at 275 electoral votes and Trump is at 188. And I'm sure you know you need 270 to win. And if that doesn't convince you look at it like this... Florida, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin are all leaning towards Hillary. And if she wins Florida alone she wins the presidency. And so far early voting puts Florida in Hillarys favor. And if by some chance Trump does win Florida he still wouldn't have enough to win the presidency. He'll need to turn at least 3 or 4 other states that are already blue or leaning blue his way. Which at this point is near impossible
14 | Teresa Cooper | 2 | 10154051209865950_10154051235450950 | Before you vote tomorrow remember this, 51 million babies have been aborted in the U.S.since Rowe vs Wade decision. Hillary supports Partial Birth Abortion even when full term. They will advance their cause on this. At any term this is still a baby. And on any day of the week it is still abortion more - correctly described... murder of innocents. Think about the murder of thesebabies before you cast your vote.  Also remember for those of you who carry a gun, if you vote for Hillary, you will have your guns taken away. It's not just scare tactics, it is a fact. And this country will sympathize Muslims, and persecute Christians. You are not voting in the first woman President, you are voting in a demon. Pray before you vote.https://www.google.com/search?q=partial+birth+abortion&biw=1360&bih=631&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjNsrnL7pbQAhUDziYKHSJVDn0Q_AUIBygC#imgrc=JqGf6fM1z1SEKM%3A

18 | Sleister Michael | 3 | 10154051209865950_10154051228580950 | PEOPLE LISTEN UP.If you vote for Hillary you vote for 100% more corruption in our government.Don't you think it is time to end it?Maybe Trump isn't the best pick, but at least we stand a chance to end part of the corruption, and if Trump doesn't do well we can find someone better in 4 years.But with Hillary she will get us in a war with Russia and chins the first year she is in office. Hillary has already stated she wants a war with Russia here at home to build her regime so she can control all.
19 | Alex Shaffer | 0 | 10154051209865950_10154051923425950 | Marco Rubio is little more than but a juvenile, pendejito Cubano with a sense of entitlement. He all but quit his job in the Senate to pursue a job on K Street as a highly paid lobbyist which he evidently failed to land. Hence why he wants his old job back. Send him home to his momma.
20 | Rose Morales | 0 | 10154051209865950_10154051327220950 | The reason nothing has changed in this Country is because the same people that have been sitting in the same chairs for years, The same people that are endorsing Donald Trump but won't say his name or stand on the same stage with him. The reply I usually get is those lazy people or they are taking our jobs, referring to people of color. That brainwashing is what has kept us all down, unless you are wealthy. We are all living from paycheck to paycheck.
21 | Alexandria Hill-Weikart | 1 | 10154051209865950_10154051625975950 | My vent for the day.... I get $112 too much a month to get Irelyn disability.... this is fucking bullshit! Her dad and I both work and pay our fucking taxes, which he pays like $20k a year in ss tax, and our daughter can't get it but these fucking refugees can get it! And they never worked a day in their fucking lives! So my daughter that has a real diagnose disability , she's not sitting on her fucking ass all day collecting welfare has to go without!!!! A child with disabilities is very expensive, to get her everything she needs cost an arm and leg, Remember this when you are voting! We can't  take care of the American people that are truly disabled, but we can give all these refugees and lazy as fucks free shit!!! This is fucked up! The average  family of five on welfare gets over $120k of free food, healthcare, social security, free housing, free utilities and money!! Than me a single mom of four can't bring in more than 2400 a month! FYI, Irelyns appts are $150 a pop 4x a week! That's 2400 a month!!! Almost All my income to just her appts!!!! How can we eat, live under a roof, or drive her there?!!!! Fuck all you people voting for Hillary! De friend yourself now, you are supporting families like me to go without, for illegals and refugees that never contributed to anything to this fucking country! These programs are tax dollar funded! They are supposed to be a hand up, not a hand out! I paid my share, and I work, and going to school to be a nurse to help those in need! God forbid I receive child support, the money doesn't cover everything! A blanket for my daughter alone was $300! I'm having a shitty day, and fuck you Hillary supporters!!!! She can use her foundation to support these refugees, oh wait it's not a charity foundation, it's a way to not be taxed and pay for expensive wedding for her daughter, to arm fucking Isis, to pay and play shit, for lawyers because she's fucking breaking the law every day....
22 | Klaus Reck | 0 | 10154051209865950_10154051831235950 | If you are Gay or lesbian, why would you want to vote for Hillary, when she gets millions from countries that will execute or in prison gays & lesbians?If you are Black, why are you voting for Hillary when she defends Planned Parenthood and admires Margaret Sanger, who wanted to abort as many black babies as possible and exterminate the black race, and Margaret Sanger said blacks are “morons,” “idiots,” “imbeciles,” “human weeds,” and “misfits.” Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.If you are a Woman, how can you vote for Hillary when she has buried all of Bill's rape victims under the rug. As an attorney, Hillary also defended the rapist of a 12-year old girl and laughed about it later. She plays the woman-card and acts entitled; implying that she deserves your vote merely because of her sex. How is that gender neutral?If you are a Miner, Steelworker or have a Factory job, why are you voting for Hillary when she supported NAFTA and TPP, and workers are being laid off because jobs are going overseas? She also welcomes open borders and illegals to get benefits with your tax money and compete for our jobs. Hillary boasts that under her administration miners and steelworkers will lose their jobs.If you are a Law abiding citizen, how can you vote for Hillary when she is clearly above the law? Hillary deleted thousands of secret e-mails *after* they had been subpoenaed by the courts (illegal). Hillary kept thousands of classified and top secret e-mails on her private server; servers that had less security that g-mail and Hotmail. You can be sure Russia, Iran, and China have those now. The DNC clearly broke the rules by heavy-handedly favoring Hillary over Sanders while they were still competing for the nomination.If you are a Veteran, in the military, or closely related to a military member, why are you voting for Hillary when she left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again? They called for help, but the help was told to stand down. Furthermore, Hillary wants to eliminate the NRA, take away your guns, and abolish the second amendment?Go Trump
23 | Maureen Kiernan Healy | 0 | 10154051209865950_10154051388680950 | Another racist bunch. What are they going to support Rubio in 2020? Well they will not be getting the Trump supporters after the shit they are pulling on Trump. This is a rare occurrence with the unity of Trump supporters Looks like Hillary will be there for 8 years. I guess the Hispanics want to have their turn for president. First we have a black president next will be a woman and after her a Hispanic. Rubio would be a very weak candidate because he is a weak man, and he's lazy he doesn't like to show up for work.

4 | Sharon L Harris-Farrer | 5 | 10154051170205950_10154051192145950 | WASHINGTON—U.S. Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) issued the following statement after President Obama's comments on illegal immigrants voting in U.S. elections:  “I am shocked that the President of the United States—who is the chief law enforcement officer for the nation and to whom all federal law enforcement officers report—failed to strongly and immediately object to a statement by an interviewer that unlawful immigrants can and should vote in U.S. elections. The interviewer proposed a radical and illegal action, which the President had a duty to condemn.The President must immediately issue a statement to make crystal clear that only citizens of the United States have the right to vote, and that any noncitizen who votes, and anyone who assists noncitizens to vote, does so illegally and is subject to prosecution. The failure to clarify this statement will only add further credibility to the public’s concerns about the integrity of this election.”

10 | Christian Torres | 23 | 10154051170205950_10154051172605950 | Trump is a pathetic,desperate pathological liar who will throw his red meat out there and see who will eat it up...now you see why he said, "I love stupid people, they will believe anything I say."and "stupid people love me. " How is it Presidential to incite hatred, violence, fighting, and even murder: If any people have not figured out that Trump is a lying fraud by now... they are either complete morons or racists who just like his nasty attacks and feeling they have a voice. What a spoiled little baby brat...wah wah, everybody is cheating, picking on me, misleading, not playing fair...the whole system is rigged...HE IS PSYCHOTIC !!!
11 | Richard Klein | 2 | 10154051170205950_10154051256005950 | People understand Stronger Together is the grand design for human survival and, a peace of mind. I love I'm with the party of beautiful caring people with a great convention and, historical speeches. I fear nothing where, “Love Trump’s Hate!”? I don’t have near the women problem Trump has. The sky is not falling. Yes, I favor the democrat issues. My healthcare is good and, I feel great. I selected my own primary care doctor and, gained many other essential things.So, if you think some of Trump’s voters are going to stop us from being Stronger Together, you are so wrong! We don’t mean any ill feelings. I realize some may have gotten a grudge. But, that’s you and, not us. Democrats will lift the world with this Latino and, minority vote of love. Democrats did not try to default on the nation’s debt. The debt is a serious matter. This tells me the republicans do not have educated thinkers to run this country. The country could have been seriously harmed or, destroyed.The Republicans will ride any wave that comes their way if it will grab them power, including electing this habitual sexist liar Trump for President. Republicans think they don’t have to take any responsibility for anything no matter how heinous it is. Republicans may have another 8 years to re-think their, “I got an axe to grind!” and their, “hate” behavior. The world is much better and, bigger than what the republicans can see. So, I don’t expect them to see, Stronger Together with her is truly the only place for me.
12 | Melissa Jo Walker | 0 | 10154051170205950_10154051228715950 | Wikileak s emails out of the DNC reveal a plan to paint Donald Trump as a sexual predator with ties to Putin. None of these emails have been proven false. The liberal secular humanist mind is not tied to truth. The means justifies the ends. Hillary is the most corrupt candidate ever to run for office. The Clinton Foundation is in collusion with the Government for regime change and gun running operations and kick backs around the world. There is no rule of law in our Government right now, the media has worked with the CIA in the regime change propaganda operations. They cannot have Trump become president because he will bring down the entire machine. Even Obama used the server. Many people in our Government are guilty of felonies and treason.This election is about American nationalist patriots vs the NWO and their programmed. Which are you?The image of Trump is a media propaganda construct. In the Alinsky process what you are guilty of you place  on the enemy to try and keep the focus off of you. Hillary' s Ex secret service details believe she is a violent sociopath who will be a dictator. The Clinton Foundation is in collusion with many many aspects of the Government for regime change gun running and kick backs around the globe so many people are paid for or blackmailed..." One who fears corruption fears life."Alinsky Clinton's pen palTrump is a blue collar billionaire who due to his status was tempted on many levels. With all of the temptation I am surprised through all their digging they have not found much more. He is 70 years old. Those who accuse him of groping have no evidence. The one who accused him of rape has dropped her case. At around the same time Hillary was calling black children super-predators without empathy or conscience and talking about building a wall and having distain for illegal immigrants on street corners waiting for jobs that she said they should not be allowed to have. At the same time she was praising Senator Byrd a member of the KKK and Margaret Sanger who called for the extermination of the black race, calling Jews F...en jews, using the word nigger, calling mentally disabled children retards, being involved in scandal after scandal in which fall guys went to prison, left the country or died, Trump was...Receiving the New York Ellis island award for his dedication to ethnic causes, being praised by Jesse Jackson for his real estate donations and dedication to Jesse Jackson s Rainbow push program. At the same time Hillary was paying for access to all white country clubs he was suing the cronies in Palm Beach for not allowing blacks and Jews into their Clubs. Did Hillary ever speak out about blacks and Jews not being allowed into the Clubs she belonged to?Trump was sued over an apartment dispute that was racially motivated during a time the Government begin to push unfunded mandates on apartment owner to rent to minorities. It was around the same time section 8 was going to start up. Trumps dads apartments were made an example of along with many other owners in New York because of the size of the complex.Did he receive the Ellis island award before or after the apartment scandal?Did he receive the accolades From Jesse Jackson before or after the apartment scandal?Did he sue the cronies in Palm Beach before or after the apartment scandal?The media has created an all out war against Trump through dis honesty. Trump did not make fun of a disability that a reporter had. He has family members with disabilities. Trump mimicked someone who was caught in a lie and back peddling in a story. He has made the same movements over and over again to express different people lying and back peddling. The reporters condition is a paralysis of the hand. There is no movement. By definition Trump could not have mimicked the reporter unless he mimicked the static paralysis which he did not.Trump did not attack the Son of Gold Star parents. The DNC knew that Mr Kahn followed and was an expert on sharia law. Trumps response to Mr. Kahn and his wife was because Trump has people on his team who know the Muslim plan for sharia law in America. He was most likely very frustrated by what he saw knowing the plan behind it. Those who follow sharia have a goal of a world wide Caliphate.  Only in an Obama and Hillary world can a sharia following Muslim who makes money through the refugee program attack Trump by referring to the Constitution. Article 6 of the Constitution outlaws sharia law. What the media and Hillary and the DNC does is to count on the stupidity of the general public.In order to be a racist you have to fall under the definition of a racist not the contrived emotional response the media propaganda machine, the DNC, and Hillary want you to believe. Did Hillary think Trump was a racist before or after she went to his wedding? A racist believes his race is superior to all others.Trumps response to the judge hearing the Trump University case was not racist. The judge was pro open borders and illegal immigration and his wife is tied to the Clinton Foundation. This is a conflict of interest to one who wants legal immigration and wants to build a wall. It is illegal immigrants that hurts the job market of legal immigrants.When Trump referred to the Mexicans coming across the border, a percentage being rapist and murderers he did so in the context of illegal immigrants and sanctuary cities. Do you want the MS 13 EX military hit squads and drug runners to have a revolving door into America?In order to be misogynist you have to hate woman. Trump treats woman and men equally. His company has more woman in high level positions than most. Out of over 500 companies 6 have gone bankrupt during tumultuous times.  Rosie O'Donald attacked his family so Trump wearing his heart on his sleeve attacked her. He says what he thinks, sometimes tooo much. He does not have the contrived pathological liar thought process of Hillary or Obama. There is no evidence that Trump ever called Ms Machado Ms Piggy and even if he did it does not follow under the definition of misogynist. There is evidence that he argued with the board of the pageant and saved her job. Her history is terrible yet Hillary parades her around counting on the stupidity of the masses falling for the deception.  Hillary is parading this woman around counting on the stupidity and laziness of the public. Your own ego is your worst enemy that they will use against you. 11 years ago the blue collar billionaire trying to impress some so called friends said some stupid words about sexual conquests. I have heard that woman in locker rooms and strip clubs say pretty much the same about men. Trump apologised for what he said. Trump is a flawed man on a spiritual journey. I believe because of realizing what he is up against and the Christians he has surrounded himself with, this spiritual journey is leading him to great things.

Trump says laziness is an inherent trait in black people. Clinton emails.Did we miss anything?Gee who should I vote for? Trump seems to have negatives, but Clinton gets incessant negative press (which all stems from one thing, that not illegal when she had it, no charges were filed, and it wouldnt even be a blip on the radar for Trump if it was him that did it when you compare it to his other scandals).

23 | Laura Thaxton | 1 | 10154051170205950_10154051222330950 | Sorry Trump supporters but Trump won't win. Clinton is already at 275 electoral votes and Trump is at 188. And I'm sure you know you need 270 to win. And if that doesn't convince you look at it like this... Florida, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin are all leaning towards Hillary. And if she wins Florida alone she wins the presidency. And so far early voting puts Florida in Hillarys favor. And if by some chance Trump does win Florida he still wouldn't have enough to win the presidency. He'll need to turn at least 3 or 4 other states that are already blue or leaning blue his way. Which at this point is near impossible
24 | Tom Lacerte | 0 | 10154051170205950_10154051400355950 | People don't want Trump to stay on message. He's spontaneous.

So she could practice her answers.

7 | Sherry Barbour Bell | 3 | 10154051143980950_10154051224895950 | WATCH – Warning To America From Europe – THIS Will Happen Unless We Elect TRUMP!Our country is at war, but not with who you expect. Liberalism has been proven time and again to be a failing system.Milo Yiannopoulos said the influx of Muslims Hillary would allow into our country would threaten the well-being of minorities everywhere. He admonished his listeners to be particularly wary of a false sense of security minorities might be lulled into by liberals.Yiannopoulos is a British-born journalist, and he is a well-aware of the threat he preaches against. He has witnessed the once great continent of Europe struggle as it come to grips with the violence of an Islamic worldview. Europeans are usually not conservative, but when it comes to Muslims they have definitely learned some things the hard way.The first attack Europeans suffered post 9/11 was gang violence, a 17-year-old girl was beaten to death by a Muslim gang. Things would become progressively worse. Just a month later, Moscow would be the scene of another deadly attack.Muslim Chechen rebels stormed a theater and held 900 people hostage. During this attack, 129 people were killed and 150 more were In August 2003 another terrorist attack happened in the Russian town of Mozdok. A suicide bomber drove into a hospital and killed 50. There were also 100 injured.Madrid, Spain would be the site of the next terrorist attack. Commuter trains were targeted in March 2004. Bombs went off, leaving 200 people dead and 1,800 people in need of medical attention.Milo Yiannopoulos is right. An examination of just the first three years of the post 9-11 attacks in Europe show them increasing in severity. Yet, according to the Pew Research Center, the Muslim population in Europe continues to steadily increase.As a result of this growing population, there have been hundreds of violent incidents. Countries as diverse as Belgium, England, Scotland, and Spain have all seen attacks of a common theme. These violent Muslims will “praise Allah” even for a small-scale attack.Yiannopoulos’ warning might have come just in the nick of time for America. The attacks in San Bernardino were downgraded by the Obama administration as simple workplace violence. But, then there was the tragic nightclub shooting in Orlando. Now, many American minorities are coming to a stunning realization:The left no longer has their back. As a result, minority groups feel betrayed and are wondering how to prevent these attacks from becoming as commonplace as they are in Europe. The answer is to quit doing the same thing over and over again! Elect someone with some common sense. Elect Donald Trump, and stay away from Hillary Clinton. Simple as that.

"One of the most abjectly stupid things I've ever seen," New Jersey Governor Chris Christie said about Bridgegate.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Annie Mendelsohn | 41 | 10154051112605950_10154051124165950 | What a callous statement to make, people were stuck in their cars while their children were home alone, while they were late for a job interview, while they had patient's waiting for their help, while they had weddings and funerals to attend. While they were ill or desperately had to use a restroom, worrying about running out of gas or being late for work.  Christie is thinking only of himself as he does over and over.
2 | Jacqueline Hone | 11 | 10154051112605950_10154051239980950 | Gov. Chris Christie's taxpayer-funded legal bills for Bridgegate (January 2014 through October) are $11,278,532.20. It's time to make this guy pay. Enough is Enough! He is due in court this month. Stand up and tell this Judge to appoint a special prosecutor.

5 | Patrick Mulrain | 3 | 10154051112605950_10154051194575950 | Christie made the perfect arguement for Clinton when he skoffed at Trump's disaffection and when he suggested his own fall in the polls is due to the continued investigations.
6 | Christian Torres | 15 | 10154051112605950_10154051119695950 | Trump is a pathetic,desperate pathological liar who will throw his red meat out there and see who will eat it up...now you see why he said, "I love stupid people, they will believe anything I say."and "stupid people love me. " How is it Presidential to incite hatred, violence, fighting, and even murder: If any people have not figured out that Trump is a lying fraud by now... they are either complete morons or racists who just like his nasty attacks and feeling they have a voice.

1 | Jeff Autrey | 252 | 10154051084270950_10154051090115950 | That's what Republicans do spend taxpayer money on investigations that yield zero evidence in hopes of stringing along enough innuendo to win the next election.
2 | Rick Ustler | 150 | 10154051084270950_10154051097570950 | Of course you will waste more tax dollars, it not like it's yor money or you have anything else to do, like running the country. Time to bring  a responsible government to Washington , vote Democrat across the board.

4 | Todd Edens | 43 | 10154051084270950_10154051124790950 | No surprise here, they are going to start the next 8 years the same way they started the last, trying to make Hillary a one term president. It will backfire the same way it has two times before. Republicans are no longer interested in doing their jobs, just whining, stomping their feet, and running off with the ball when they can't have it their way. They been doing this since 1992.

7 | Kathy Murray Rodio | 32 | 10154051084270950_10154051104100950 | Really?  They were 5 to 8 years ago when she was Secretary of State. Nobody hacked them. Nobody, and they really really tried, found anything. We have much bigger fish to fry. We have Flint where kids are being poisoned every day and Congress VOTED not to send them help. We have a pipeline trying to go across land promised to the original Americans. They are under attack by people who claim to be good Americans. We have a good man who will not even be looked at by Congress just because they don't like OUR president, nominated for the empty seat at the Supreme Court for months. But we have to stay focused on the e-mails!  Is she the only person who was E-mailing anyone. People are so sucked in by this witch hunt.
8 | TJ Frisk | 14 | 10154051084270950_10154051166480950 | Imagine, if you will, an FBI that would keep after Trump to expose and bring charges against him for tax evasion, fraud, sexual misconduct, voter intimidation, inciting violence against political opponents, collusion with Russia and Putin with rigging of the USA elections...etc etc.It is only then will the majority of Americans ever trust the FBI again
9 | Skip Hinshaw | 15 | 10154051084270950_10154051130300950 | Right Chaffetz, spend four more years not doing your job and spending our money. Maybe the rest of your Republicans can also vote 50 more times to repeal the ACA and maybe a small group would like to study Benghazi a few more years
10 | Beth Reynolds | 8 | 10154051084270950_10154051128215950 | To me, this continuous need for investigation on Chaffetz's part and his like minded band of brothers is the classic definition of insanity: doing the same things by over and over and over and expecting different results. Why don't the republicans spend all the money they are wasting and put it in more programs that will effect a positive response. Stop. Wasting. My. Money. I have much less respect for you now and it wasn't a lot before.

16 | Shirley Terry | 3 | 10154051084270950_10154051120620950 | If what both parties spent on this campaine they could have had free college education food  housing for the needy for at least 20 yearsran from one state to another not happy with either one but will vote tomorrow
17 | Joseph Kaising | 5 | 10154051084270950_10154051110405950 | So, if Hillary becomes president another 4 years of gridlock? Mmmm, to me it sounds like the Republicans have no "Real" plans on helping America go forward? No wonder we are becoming a third world nation....
18 | Rodney Nursoo | 4 | 10154051084270950_10154051107725950 | Let's hope he doesn't get re-elected then he can continue his probe in his garage at home while he at it he can probe his ass. Stay focus Democrats don't boo vote as your President Obama keeps saying don't boo just vote this dickhead out
19 | Allison Attong-Rogers | 2 | 10154051084270950_10154051293135950 | Chaffetz and the republican congress need to start doing the people's work and stop wasting our money on hearings. Confirm President Barack Obama nominee. If you want to investigate how about the cases in court against Donald Trump and making him release his tax returns.
20 | Daniel Killman | 3 | 10154051084270950_10154051140130950 | Of course you will.  Because it's the way politics works. You probe things endlessly rather than getting things done for the American people.
21 | Carolyn Yvonne Garris | 1 | 10154051084270950_10154051379130950 | Did Soros build the computer program to review the emails? It was just a smokescreen by Comey and Clinton...We know you cannot be trusted with the welfare of our country.
22 | Bill May | 2 | 10154051084270950_10154051191325950 | The Republicans are so worried about helping the People of America,That their gonna spend as much time and tax payer dollars on useless investigations as possible
23 | Christian Torres | 10 | 10154051084270950_10154051089220950 | Trump is a pathetic,desperate pathological liar who will throw his red meat out there and see who will eat it up...now you see why he said, "I love stupid people, they will believe anything I say."and "stupid people love me. " How is it Presidential to incite hatred, violence, fighting, and even murder: If any people have not figured out that Trump is a lying fraud by now... they are either complete morons or racists who just like his nasty attacks and feeling they have a voice. What a spoiled little baby brat...wah wah, everybody is cheating, picking on me, misleading, not playing fair...the whole system is rigged...HE IS PSYCHOTIC !!!
24 | Cheryl Stolle | 11 | 10154051084270950_10154051122980950 | It is time to look at how we hold Republicans accountable for obstruction, constitutional disregard, and spending millions in the effort to obstruct the government. This former Republican would like to see jail time for their abuse of power and reckless behavior.
25 | Cheryl Reiseg Lang | 1 | 10154051084270950_10154051885540950 | Of course. Let's spend millions more of our taxpayer dollars on an investigation where no criminal wrongdoing was found. Twice. Congress needs to start doing their jobs. Pass legislation.

We are going to see huge numbers of Trump supporters standing in line tomorrow all over this country. We have been waiting so long for this. We want real change, real jobs, real healthcare, real justice, we want law & order, we want our veterans taking care of, tired of seeing politicians get richer and richer off the backs of hard working Americans. YES!! We want a leader who is going to put America and Americans first for a change! A leader who is going to secure our borders and keep us safe! Yes!! Huge crowds, millions and millions will turn out for Donald J Trump tomorrow and we will make America great again!! #TRUMP2016
2 | JoshCallihan MissyCallihan | 27 | 10154051043375950_10154051072970950 | Think about beyonce, I watched a video that beyonce herself said the only reason she is voting for hilliary is because she is a woman nothing else just because she is a woman, Really? Hilliary is not someone I would want my child growing up idolizing.
3 | Stacy Guillory | 9 | 10154051043375950_10154051083960950 | Think about this: When did the Morals of the people of The U.S.A. start going to the devil? I tell you when, when the American people said that it was ok for the President of The U.S.A. ( Bill Clinton)to have sex with an intern in the Whitehouse while on duty, when the people said it was ok for the President ( Bill Clinton) to rape a woman, to expose himself to another and to sexually assault two others. When the people said it was ok for his wife (Hillary Clinton) to send Private investigators to dig up dirt and threaten these women.   When the people Reelected Bill Clinton and Elected Hillary Clinton as senator.
4 | Troy Hatcher | 5 | 10154051043375950_10154051072520950 | Gary Johnson A self made millionaire & two time governor with no FBI investigations, no scandals, no corruption, no molested women. Just honesty, integrity & a love for freedom.. If you love your children & grandchildren, there is only one real choice.
5 | Scott Partridge | 8 | 10154051043375950_10154051112070950 | .... as a Independent Voter this is the way I see it. After 30+ years in politics Hillary has a handful of celebrities backing her and the FBI looking into her affairs & foundation. Trump has the United States Military backing him along with the American Law Enforcement... Independent for Trump.! ( my healthcare cost doubles in 2017 also)
6 | Jim Gull | 5 | 10154051043375950_10154051067790950 | This election was over long ago maybe even as much as two years. The poll numbers are manipulated by the media to keep us all interested as if it was a race at all. You can't really alienate women and minority voters and expect to win. Impossible. Hillary will be our next president. Whether any one of us like it or not.

They're Sending F.B.I. Republican Hit-Jobs, They're sending low life POS. They're sending Right Wing Breitbart KKK Conspiracy Lies , They're sending KGB Russian Hackers to Attack America and Rig the election for TRUMP, They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems to us. They're bringing hate. They're bringing fear. They're deplorable and some, I assume are good people!!!???
13 | Gina Williams-Vacala | 2 | 10154051043375950_10154051067665950 | Does any of this scare you?There are eight levels of control that must be obtained before you can create a social state:1. Healthcare - Control healthcare and you control the people. 2. Poverty - Increase the Poverty level as high as possible; poor people are easier to control and will not fight back if you are providing everything for them to live.3. Debt - Increase the debt to an unsustainable level. That way you are able to increase taxed, and this will produce more poverty.4. Gun Control - Remove the ability to defend themselves from the government. That way you are able to create a police state.5. Welfare - Take control of every aspect of their lives (Food, Housing, and Income).6. Education - Take control of what people read and listen to - take control of what children learn in school. 7. Religion - Remove the belief in the God from government and schools.8. Class Warfare - Divide the people into the wealthy and the poor. This will cause more discontent, and will be easier to take (tax) the wealthy with the support of the poor.But the one that they missed, that George Orwell didn't miss in his book, "1984", was first control the media! With the news media we have today that is totally being controlled to write only stories that "Big Brother" corporate elites and the corrupt politicians want, we become in effect brainwashed by their 24 hour bombardment of "news"! Right now our only salvation is Facebook and the other internet sites that we can share info with! But here is the bottom line as we have seen with the shutting down of Wikileaks we are in real danger of losing credible news sources! So recently, I put out two most compelling posts about the corruption in our government and I ask you these questions: Where is the news media? Why aren't Congress and the FBI investigating the Whitehouse and its role in operating dirty tricks on the Trump campaign and at its rallies? Why would the news media not allow the American People access to Wikileaks? They say that Russia is trying to influence our election well what about the fact that Russia got 20% of our Uranium by colluding with the Clinton Foundation? We are at a crossroad in our country and if we don't act now we will not have our country any longer! As the song says "You don't know what you got until it's gone"! Wake up and Vote for Trump, he is our only hope to rid our country of the stinking rotten corruption!If you don't know who George Soros is. Who Saul Alinsky was. What Agenda 21 or Agenda 30 is, and what Cloward-Piven means... educate yourself. Research these names tied with Clinton & Obama before you go to vote!!
14 | Klaus Reck | 0 | 10154051043375950_10154051832045950 | If you are Gay or lesbian, why would you want to vote for Hillary, when she gets millions from countries that will execute or in prison gays & lesbians?If you are Black, why are you voting for Hillary when she defends Planned Parenthood and admires Margaret Sanger, who wanted to abort as many black babies as possible and exterminate the black race, and Margaret Sanger said blacks are “morons,” “idiots,” “imbeciles,” “human weeds,” and “misfits.” Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.If you are a Woman, how can you vote for Hillary when she has buried all of Bill's rape victims under the rug. As an attorney, Hillary also defended the rapist of a 12-year old girl and laughed about it later. She plays the woman-card and acts entitled; implying that she deserves your vote merely because of her sex. How is that gender neutral?If you are a Miner, Steelworker or have a Factory job, why are you voting for Hillary when she supported NAFTA and TPP, and workers are being laid off because jobs are going overseas? She also welcomes open borders and illegals to get benefits with your tax money and compete for our jobs. Hillary boasts that under her administration miners and steelworkers will lose their jobs.If you are a Law abiding citizen, how can you vote for Hillary when she is clearly above the law? Hillary deleted thousands of secret e-mails *after* they had been subpoenaed by the courts (illegal). Hillary kept thousands of classified and top secret e-mails on her private server; servers that had less security that g-mail and Hotmail. You can be sure Russia, Iran, and China have those now. The DNC clearly broke the rules by heavy-handedly favoring Hillary over Sanders while they were still competing for the nomination.If you are a Veteran, in the military, or closely related to a military member, why are you voting for Hillary when she left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again? They called for help, but the help was told to stand down. Furthermore, Hillary wants to eliminate the NRA, take away your guns, and abolish the second amendment?Go Trump
15 | Greg Hartzog | 1 | 10154051043375950_10154051287645950 | I call bullshit. Every poll i have seen (there have been several) jas Trump stomping a mudhole in Killary's butt. I have no respect for the media at all anymore.

May all in heaven and earth acclaim your glory and never cease to praise you.Lord, please help to change the hearts and minds of citizens in our country to choose life over death, law over lawlessness, honesty over corruption, and freedom over oppression. We have been given a choice Lord, of a candidate with a history of working to fund and to expand the most heinous forms of death and violence to our unborn children in addition to promoting the restriction of the rights of your children, their silencing, and their oppression. Through her court appointments she will institutionalize the killing of innocent human life as a Constitutional right for decades to come and will work to strip Constitutional rights from your Church on earth and all your faithful.

23 | Teresa Cooper | 0 | 10154051043375950_10154051236880950 | Before you vote tomorrow remember this, 51 million babies have been aborted in the U.S.since Rowe vs Wade decision. Hillary supports Partial Birth Abortion even when full term. They will advance their cause on this. At any term this is still a baby. And on any day of the week it is still abortion more - correctly described... murder of innocents. Think about the murder of thesebabies before you cast your vote.  Also remember for those of you who carry a gun, if you vote for Hillary, you will have your guns taken away. It's not just scare tactics, it is a fact. And this country will sympathize Muslims, and persecute Christians. You are not voting in the first woman President, you are voting in a demon. Pray before you vote.https://www.google.com/search?q=partial+birth+abortion&biw=1360&bih=631&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjNsrnL7pbQAhUDziYKHSJVDn0Q_AUIBygC#imgrc=JqGf6fM1z1SEKM%3A

Janet Reno's time at Justice Department helm was marked by moments like the storming of Branch Davidian compound and Elian Gonzalez case.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Lloyd Hart | 27 | 10154051026090950_10154051083080950 | Janet Reno is the person most responsible for all the death and destruction the US has inflicted on the world in the last 16 years with it's phony "War On Terror". As US Attorney General, she didn't lift a finger to investigate the theft of election 2000 and the subsequent suborning of the US Supreme Court by the Bush Campaign because the Clintons bribed and blackmailed her off the case. Janet Reno, coward to the grave.
2 | Janice Bowlin Williams | 4 | 10154051026090950_10154051217240950 | Janet Reno was a brave and honorable Attorney General. She immediately took responsibility for the Waco crisis, when it was clearly the fault of the arrogant cult leader who killed them all for his own ego.
3 | Fay Lyn Mowry | 5 | 10154051026090950_10154051099560950 | I wish MSNBC would combine their coverage of Ms. Reno's passing with her passion for our Native Americans and honor her with some on the ground reporting at Standing Rock. The tribes are coming together to pray with people from all over the world and where are the major media networks here in the US....squeezing every last bit of blood out of this election week. https://www.justice.gov/archive/ag/speeches/1999/1119ag.htm
4 | Joyce Nagy | 0 | 10154051026090950_10154051317845950 | Under Bill Clinton's watch this woman's orders caused to the deaths of 80 people, mostly women and children burned to death in Texas. A Mother holding a baby and teenage son murdered at Ruby Ridge on her watch. Then she sent back to Communist Cuba a six year old boy who's mother dies in the attempt to get him to freedom. No matter her political excuses. May God have mercy on her soul.
5 | David Martin | 6 | 10154051026090950_10154051067410950 | It's sad that Janet Reno passed away today, just one day before witnessing the election of the first female president of the United States of America!  Rest in Peace, Janet Reno!
6 | Michael Roberts | 7 | 10154051026090950_10154051042255950 | She was one hideous repugnant bull. I'll be nice and just say she was a handsome woman with woman in parentheses. Who am I kidding she was a chick with a dick disgusting

9 | Josh Colletta | 2 | 10154051026090950_10154051175835950 | So between the gas-and-fire murdering of innocents in Waco and the armed raid of a Little Havana home to send an innocent boy back to the terrorist state his mother gave her life to remove him from, should I be *sad* at Janet Reno's passing, or...?
10 | Richard Main | 0 | 10154051026090950_10154051557635950 | Reno was responsible for the actual biggest mass murder in recent US history, which included fire bombing infants and hundreds of others. Ironic that she was Hillary's suggestion to Bill, and Bill admitted she was his biggest mistake.
11 | Jason Bridges | 6 | 10154051026090950_10154051079090950 | Another example of pushing the "first woman attorney general" rather than someone best qualified for the job. The same mindset is electing Hillary Clinton.

For the past 48 years, students at the school have been casting their “votes” to determine the winner of each presidential election. And for the past 48 years, the school has never been wrong.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Christopher Horn | 152 | 10154050981640950_10154051019050950 | They didn't tell the students about the corruption of Hillary, her scandals. But they probably mentioned Trump's female accusers. Corrupt fraudulent deal.I'm voting Trump
2 | Ryan McNeilly | 81 | 10154050981640950_10154051030255950 | Because 8-year-olds have an understanding of the healthcare market, capital economics, international diplomacy, and military/national security efforts.
3 | Jeremy Finks | 62 | 10154050981640950_10154051042095950 | My daughters highschool also has had mock elections for YEARS and this year Trump won by a landslide. Quit using children to get your DNC message across. Pathetic
4 | Craig Giodsir | 56 | 10154050981640950_10154050985490950 | And for the first time in 48 years, all the students have more maturity than the Republican candidate and the schoolyard bully at this school thinks the Republican Party will have a place for him.
5 | Wayne Howard II | 50 | 10154050981640950_10154050985115950 | Save the read, the kiddies all voted Hillary. Hillary will be the next President.
6 | Shannie Blake | 35 | 10154050981640950_10154051002700950 | Hillary Clinton will be OUR FIRST Female President in HISTORY baby!!!
7 | Barbara Wright | 18 | 10154050981640950_10154051049425950 | All the picks are depending on what is taught about each of them and what is said about the candidate....  but since The Whole truth was not taught about both candidates... I'm not surprised. Plus I'm sure they used the " first woman president "  isn't that cool 😎 card......
8 | Philip Racuel | 3 | 10154050981640950_10154051315510950 | The kids picked $hillary. I like what the school is doing but they presented the kids with only two choices. This tells the kids that the two corporate parties are the only choices. It would have been interesting to see what the results were if they had included Jill Stein and Gary Johnson.
9 | James Martin | 15 | 10154050981640950_10154051035025950 | Can't wait to see that map tomorrow nite turn red it's time for real change vote TRUMP let's make a difference in this election Mrs Clinton is wrong for America get out an vote for real change let's stand up an be counted  let our votes be heard loud an clear say know to the establishment an yes to real change vote TRUMP GOD bless you and the USA
10 | Carlton Tasch | 4 | 10154050981640950_10154051202375950 | WHO ever heard of this johhy-come-lately school OR its predictions, Ever hear of them in the last 48 years, No, neither did I. But suddenly their prediction overrules the corruption 5th graders have no idea of. I CALL BULLSHIT!
11 | Nichol Reimer | 10 | 10154050981640950_10154051599730950 | Oh my God!!! Just look at the crap you people type! They picked THIS school because they've been right for 48 years straight! Has any of the other schools or classes you've listed been right that many years straight?! That's kind of neat/interesting. Yeah, it's fluff reporting. It's bringing something light hearted and fun to this insanely crazy election year! Lighten up!They weren't told who they actually picked until they chose who they were voting for. They were told person A and person B. So, it's not what they heard at home but who they (the student) wanted.Also, it wasn't much of a landslide so for all of you who want to say the teachers brainwashed them, come on!! If that were true there'd be a greater difference! Also, if teachers are such rotten people then home school your kids! Half of you couldn't handle the job of a teacher nor put up with it for the pay they get!The students weren't given all the media BS, they were given facts! Not each candidates long history report but where they each stand on matters, the same matters. They aren't teaching them about scandals and pussy grabbing! It's an elementary school for God's sake! So once again, lighten up! It wasn't a real election! Take it for what it is, a lighthearted, fun story. It doesn't matter who these kids would have picked, the comments would have been ridiculous regardless! This election year is the worst ever! I'm scared to see how America is going to behave once the winning candidate is announced! Lord help us all!
12 | Greg Yates | 3 | 10154050981640950_10154051270705950 | I wonder why cbs did not make a big announcement about high school students in Minnesota picking Trump... Hmm, one wonders..
13 | Mary Behenna Bird | 1 | 10154050981640950_10154051635620950 | God help us if they are right. Funny the political scientist( I can't remember his name right now) that's never been wrong said Trump would win. Guess we will know tomorrow
14 | Carlton Tasch | 1 | 10154050981640950_10154051189365950 | With a majority of female teachers herding the sheeple minors and ABC running Yellow Journalism at its worst, File this under Paid for by Killary Rotten Cunton.Remember how Your teachers would Herd you into doing what They want, remember ABC is on Who's payroll? Last minute bullschite responsible to no one, Do you expect a retraction from a fictious story? Not, TRUMP, TRUMP, TRUMP.

18 | Bryan Curran | 7 | 10154050981640950_10154051029930950 | Quickest investigation in history and completed just in time for the elections...680,000 emails reviewed in less than a week? Impossible no matter what predictive coding technology you use. And then you find that the investigations have been overseen by FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, whose wife received half a million in funding for her own political campaign from the Clinton camp, as publicised by the Wall Street Journal http://www.wsj.com/.../clinton-ally-aids-campaign-of-fbi...
19 | Melissa Ipock | 9 | 10154050981640950_10154051065335950 | Can't wait to see trump throw a tantrum when Hillary wins 😂😂😂😂😂😂

21 | Veronica Chapman | 11 | 10154050981640950_10154050994860950 | Awesome!! They'll be correct again this year too then !!!
22 | Phillip Chilcott | 8 | 10154050981640950_10154051078370950 | Of course it was going to be Mrs Clinton otherwise CBS News wouldn't have published the article.
23 | John Hebert | 0 | 10154050981640950_10154051915495950 | Don't believe the media...Hillary's poll numbers are falling faster than Bill Clinton's pants in an Arkansas trailer park...
24 | David Cornelison | 12 | 10154050981640950_10154050998350950 | Well with scientific evidence like this…….seriously, you are reporting this crap as news?
25 | Camille Myers | 0 | 10154050981640950_10154051660385950 | A Good share of teachers are just plan Democratic. ..remember  when I was young. .. it was all pushing  the Democratic  party...
