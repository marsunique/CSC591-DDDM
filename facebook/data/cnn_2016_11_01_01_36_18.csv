Donald J. Trump's campaign manager says Democrats should not blame FBI director James Comey, but rather the selfishness of Hillary Clinton and Anthony Weiner.

First of all, he'd have to secure a majority of African-American and Hispanic votes, which he hasn't. Now granted, Comey's letter has done damage with undecided and unsatisfied republicans. But Chump still hasn't a chance in hell of winning.
2 | Jake DeLuna | 26 | 10155539078606509_10155539082371509 | She's praying that Donald doesn't forget to pay her after this is all over
3 | Heine Inge Graawe | 1 | 10155539078606509_10155539092466509 | How many email are correct, and belong to Hillary??? And how many email are the same, as the other Surver??? 1-1000??? How many is new email??? 1-100??? It all came from Hillary Data Computer, sending over to the other Computer... I think, some of this, is a sabotage of Hillary Clinton, because she is a Woman... Vote for Hillary... :-)

5 | Kelly Momo | 1 | 10155539078606509_10155539085491509 | Hilary should be investigated, she is not a Saint,she's just a wolf in a sheepskin. She's so cunning and a criminal
6 | Craig Tarres | 9 | 10155539078606509_10155539085846509 | Hopefully everyone comes together and supports Donald Trump. Its a big machine to run.
7 | Ryan Myers | 13 | 10155539078606509_10155539081921509 | Remember when Trump was laughed at for saying Hillary had the questions ahead of time? Remember when he said Weiner had access to Hillary's classified emails? Remember when he said Hillary cheated Bernie out of the nomination BEFORE wikileaks confirmed it. Trumps been right about everything from the start.#MAGA
8 | Marti White | 10 | 10155539078606509_10155539085346509 | I watched 60-Minutes few weeks ago. My heart is still racing from the REMINDER that the POTUS, can give the order (alllllll BY HERSELF, or by Himself) to Decide in 8 minutes to END CIVILIZATION! Honest to God, Donald Trump should be kept far away from office of the Presidency. With His TEMPERAMENT and HIS Ego? OMG!
9 | Jake Chrisman | 8 | 10155539078606509_10155539083271509 | All weekend I have been thinking about The FBI Directors behavior this close to the election. I am not at all surprised by it because this is what we have seen since The Tea Party took over Congress. There has been absolutely ZERO concern about ethics in their rabid campaign to discredit and delegitimize President Obama and Hillary Clinton. The Republicans on the Benghazi and Email Committees had no intention to seek the truth they were looking to find fault and keep Hillary's approval rating as low as possible.The timing of this email story Friday 11 days before the election is just more of the same. These men were elected to Congress to help our country prosper, and instead they have made it their mission to take away women's rights and LGBT rights. They have worked to oppose President Obama's agenda whenever possible and they tried to ensure his failure. They have shown ignorance in their opposition to reducing the use of fossil fuel and the development of a clean energy economy and instead denied Climate Science calling it a hoax. One thing the Trump voter and the Clinton voter have in common is the disgust with the Republicans in Congress. It is time to replace these destructive individuals with people who care about protecting the rights of our country's diverse population. Leaders who will foster our economic growth as a clean energy superpower to both tackle global warming and create good jobs in small businesses. Leaders who have as a primary goal to spend their time making our government work to help people and keep us safe. Hillary Clinton has shown us during this campaign just what kind of a team player she truly is in working with Senator Bernie Sanders after the primary to come up with the most progressive agenda ever. She has the unique skill set, leadership skills and grace to bring Congress together and make government work to tackle the problems facing our country. Democrats work to help our country Tea Party Republicans work to help themselves. I voted BLUE! Hillary Clinton is a leader who will keep us safe from enemies both foreign and domestic. The GOP members of Congress have been an enemy to our nation by spending millions to discredit and obstruct. Undecided voters A vote for Gary Johnson Is a vote for Trump. A vote for Jill stein is a vote for trump. A vote for trump is a vote for trump. And a No vote is a vote for trump. If you really don't want trump. Then vote Hillary. Because She will probably be out of office in 4 years time and possibly impeached before then but 4 years of Hillary is not 4 years and possibly 8 years of trump. Florida, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Colorado, New Mexico, North Carolina, Virginia, and Nevada. To all hillary supporters in those states Hold the line. We have one final week to go. We've held on for a long time. We're 8 days out, we can do this clinton supporters. Keep up the fight and fight harder than we ever have before. Scream, shout, fight, and most importantly do whatever it takes to win. And also hillary won't be for sure at least for now the one going to trial after this election is over don't forget about that undecided voters. Remember Trump is actually going to trial Twice after this election is over, and that is a 100 percent fact. She isn't. Yet anyways depending on what they say, Innocent until absolutely proven guilty.
10 | Stacey Toole | 0 | 10155539078606509_10155539094871509 | If Hillary Clinton believed in transparency, this would never have happened. She only has herself to blame. Not Comey, not Trump.....

If you didn't want the FBI involved in the election you shouldn't have nominated someone who blatantly violated federal law.

1 | Jonathan Rezach | 10 | 10155538957896509_10155538978616509 | Hell no. There's no way they can make these things safe. Guaranteed massive accidents with self driving cars. Not to mention the elimination of hundreds of thousands of jobs
2 | Andrea Benalcazar Barcia | 1 | 10155538957896509_10155538986311509 | I'd never get one of these cars or go in one of these cars because technology has its flaws even cars now a days have recalls and I personally have had horrible dreams about these kind of cars before like accidents going off Highway turns over the rail. So no way. No thanks.
3 | Mark Rubello | 3 | 10155538957896509_10155538981771509 | the only time self driving cars will be safe is when every car is self driving.  as long as idiots are on the road, I want 100% control.
4 | Josue Salas | 1 | 10155538957896509_10155538980481509 | This is gonna be a big fail. No one better than a human driver which the rider can tell the Uber driver which is the best and easiest route to take. Not to mention that a human can't be hacked or tampered with.

8 | Josée Touchette | 2 | 10155538957896509_10155539009756509 | New technologies = less jobs. Much easier to inovate in technology with new gadgets than find solutions to poverty and new treatments for cancer and other medical problems
9 | Michael Miranda | 2 | 10155538957896509_10155538961831509 | Imagine it is November 9, 2016 in America and we wake up knowing who our new President will be. If it is Hillary, think of the groups of people that will celebrate. Illegal Immigrants, criminals and future criminals who will be supported for pulling a gun on a police officer, planned parenthood, the media, and the list goes on and on that represent everything that is wrong with America. If you're still "with her," look around at who you'll be celebrating with. Now imagine waking up knowing that Trump is our new President. You may or may not like him, or really know what kind of president he will be. But here are some things you will know for sure:• The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.• The media has been neutered forever.• Career politicians will have lost all job security.• The guns in your home will safely stay there.• Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.• Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally• Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.• No more apologies to the world for being great!• Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.• Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.• There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.• The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.• The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.Copy and paste this as your status if you support and will vote Donald Trump for president 2016.

I fear we will only be fighting over which politician has the absolute backing of science and education, before anything else, after climate change has brought famine to the first worlds. Not even displacement over rising tides or loss of animal and plant life. Lose the food, lose your people.

9 | Kevin Bautista | 0 | 10155538854256509_10155538887571509 | Reparations owed for “Racial Terrorism” says UN Committeeby Phoebe Braithwaite (United Nations, )Monday, October 31, 2016Inter Press ServiceUNITED NATIONS, Oct 31 (IPS) - Stressing the enduring relationship between injuries inflicted by slavery and contemporary injustices, a UN committee has recently issued a strongly-worded call for reparations for black U.S. Americans."A systemic ideology of racism ensuring the domination of one group over another continues to impact negatively on the civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights of African Americans today," said the UN Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent, in a report released in August.So far this year 212 black people have been killed by police in the United States, according to statistics collected by The Guardian. This is almost a quarter of the total 883 people killed by police in 2016, despite the fact that only14.4 percent of US Americans are of African descent.While only 6.5% of the US population are African American men, they constitute 40.2% of prison populations, according to Ana DuVernay's recent film 13TH. While 1 in 17 white men can expect to go to prison in their lifetime, one in three black men can expect to be incarcerated.The group's report, which focuses especially on police brutality against black Americans as "reminiscent of the past racial terror of lynching," makes 35 diverse recommendations, from establishing sovereign human rights commissions to the reinstatement of voting rights of former felons.Yet critics question whether the liberal human rights paradigm can adequately address this kind of cruelty and oppression, originating as it does in 20th century Europe, where fascism had recently taken root, and in light of Europe's own role in creating and perpetuating racial injustice."In the era of the Atlantic slave trade," says Andrew Johnson, Professor of African American Studies at Harvard University, "new notions of difference – absolute, racial notions of difference – were used to define, describe, and justify the political economy of slavery, articulating the centrality of racism in capitalist exploitation."Demands for reparations have been largely ignored in the political mainstream. A bill, HR-40, introduced in 1989 to establish a commission examining the "fundamental injustice, cruelty" and brutality of slavery has gained little traction – though the UN committee recommends its passage through Congress. Last year, then-presidential candidate democratic socialist Bernie Sanders dismissed the question of reparations saying that it wouldn't get through Congress and would be "too divisive".Noting Sanders' determination to push the boat out on issues of class, celebrated writer and proponent of reparations Ta-Nehisi Coates deplored this lack of political imagination: "I thought Sanders's campaign might remind Americans that what is imminently doable and what is morally correct are not always the same things, and while actualising the former we can't lose sight of the latter," Coatessaid.He urged that class-based solutions are inappropriate to address "racial plunder" – borne out by the fact that the median income for African American households ($36,898) is almost half their white counterparts ($62,950). The median net worth of black families, $4,900, versus white families, $97,000, reveals an even starker difference.Movement for Black LivesThe Movement for Black Lives, a coalition of over 50 black-led organisations, has set out five key requests which would begin to restore what has been being stolen "since the time that the first black person was kidnapped from the shores of Africa," in the words of Black Panther Angela Davis.They focus especially on education, a particular site of harm since it was made illegal to teach enslaved people to read, a law which began in South Carolina in 1740 and was punishable by death in Louisiana. Since then, owing to redlining policies and explicit disinvestment in primarily-black schools, African Americans have continued to suffer from worse educational opportunities, with black students expelled at three times the rate of white students."You're more likely to walk into your hallway and interact with a police officer – in a school – than a guidance counselor," Kesi Foster, Coordinator at the Urban Youth Collaborative, and contributor to the policy recommendations for the Movement for Black Lives' demand for reparations, told IPS, saying that in New York, there is one guidance counselor for every 322 students, but a police officer for every 192 students.These officers are more prevalent in schools with metal detectors, which are usually primarily non-white. Describing what is often called the ‘school-to-prison pipeline', Foster says that reparative justice could begin by defunding the COPS programme which stations police in schools in line with the perception that black and brown males are "inherently dangerous".ReparationsAfter the end of the American Civil War in 1865, people who were formerly enslaved were given forty acres of tillable land – and, sometimes a mule. But after Abraham Lincoln's assassination the same year, his successor Andrew Johnson reversed Lincoln's directive for redistribution.Calls for reparations have a long history proceeding from this date, and have tended to focus on material restitution, which makes the Movement for Black Lives' emphasis on education salient. "Not only is there no curriculum recognition about the real history of our country… but there's also no cultural recognition," Foster says. "In Germany and other places... where really atrocious things have taken place, there are markers."They call for "mandated public school curriculums that critically examine the political, economic, and social impacts of colonialism and slavery, and funding to support, build, preserve, and restore cultural assets and sacred sites to ensure the recognition and honoring of our collective struggles and triumphs."It is clear that fulsome reparations for the continued atrocities perpetrated against people of African descent are not about to be freely given simply because whites are made to see the error of their ways. In the words of Mariame Kaba, organiser, educator and founder of Project NIA, speaking at a recent conference on the disproportionate effect the war on drugs has had on black communities, "the system can't indict itself. You can't think that the system that is killing you is going to save you."Kaba, who helped in the fight for plaintiffs' justice in the Burge torture trials, discussed the extensive public apology that was eventually won by some of those Burge tortured, and the history's inclusion in Chicago's curriculums, demonstrating the essential role honest expressions of responsibility can play in processes of healing for black communities who have been brutalised by the state.But the Movement's foremost demand is for the "full and free access for all Black people (including undocumented and currently and formerly incarcerated people) to lifetime education" in its every form, including the "retroactive forgiveness of student loans".Professor Harold McDougall, who teaches law at Howard University, has, among many others, argued for the necessity of black-only education. McDougall would like to see Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), like Howard, funded to set up "Reparations Academies" for the descendents of people who were "damaged by educational racism". This is a practical measure as much as it compounds Stokely Carmichael and Charles Hamilton's view that "group solidarity is necessary before a group can operate effectively from a bargaining position of strength".

4 | Fangyu Han | 1 | 10155538733916509_10155538817771509 | I think an issue could be the energy consumption. I've heard that their prototype maglev consumes a lot more electricity than current Shinkansen trains...But as engineers keep working I think everything will fine in the future
5 | Myo Maung | 1 | 10155538733916509_10155539018591509 | I was on seven shinkansens during my trip to Japan in June, very nice trains (more like flying!) especially the ones between Tokyo & Shin-Hakodate-Hokuto on the way to & from Sapporo.  Way way above Amtrak & Via Rail trains of North America, which really are like not much different from trains in Thailand & India, lol
6 | Zab Morioka Ongori | 1 | 10155538733916509_10155538936546509 | You guys are really ahead of time. Took the shinkanshen from sendai to Tokyo in record short time. This one is faster than the bullet train? Awesome.

The mice's testicles shrunk to one-tenth of their normal size and did not recover, this new study found.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Joe Recine | 100 | 10155538645051509_10155538652591509 | Wow, even mice testicles aren't safe from political comments. At least someone found some links to watch movies for free. Neato!
2 | Josh N Amber Gagnier | 40 | 10155538645051509_10155538714076509 | Just in: Clinton is now LEADING in polls in important battleground states, such as Qatar, Iraq, Iran, and Syria And hopefully soon...San Quentin
3 | Steve Mestayer | 35 | 10155538645051509_10155538668991509 | Bunch of old dudes with testicles that hang down into the toilet now want to know where they can get some of that Zika.
4 | Morgan Spears | 5 | 10155538645051509_10155538708896509 | Well maybe if our no good crap congress would approve funds to combat this we wouldn't have kids being born with birthdefects and now shrunken testies and infertility issues. Its all fun and games until your wife gets infected and your child is born mentally retarded and deformed. Wtf is wrong with people.
5 | Tina Saldaña | 7 | 10155538645051509_10155538737076509 | Can we release those Zika infected mosquitoes into the areas where the Trump supporters live so they can stop reproducing... if that could be done that would be nice. 😂
6 | Rita Rita | 5 | 10155538645051509_10155538747406509 | I'm sure anything to do with a man's private parts will be looked at immediately, never mind developing easy blood tests for women & breast cancer, ovarian cancer, cervical cancer etc. which of course is not important enough. Duh!
7 | Joanne Matthew | 3 | 10155538645051509_10155538761826509 | Oh.....so if it's found to affect men, then congress might actually pass some bills to prevent it.  When it affected women and babies,they didn't care.
8 | John Orr | 1 | 10155538645051509_10155538801666509 | Well crap we really need to get serious.about this zika virus. Mcrosephaly and permanent brain damage are one thing, but shrunken mice testicals that is serious business.
9 | Nicole Gladue Weesemat | 0 | 10155538645051509_10155539019111509 | Smh Rather then doing that on small or any type of animal why don't they do it on all the fn lifers in jail?  What they got to loose...thats who's nuts they should be experimenting on 😂 sorry not sorry!!!!
10 | Ai Takahashi | 0 | 10155538645051509_10155538928821509 | Ahhh, now that explains things...it's the Zika virus. The same thing that got injected into Chump's brain - unlike his hands, which are naturally small...just like his little pee pee (AARGH, the visuals!!!)...😝
11 | Felipe Riveros | 2 | 10155538645051509_10155538727111509 | Another phony virus owned by the Rockefeller Fundation, it just so happens that Rockefeller is yet another member of the global elite wich is also an eugenecist weirdo.#PopulationControl  #BigPharma #ItsAlwayTheMoney https://www.lgcstandards-atcc.org/products/all/VR-84.aspx?geo_country=es#

13 | Kara Byrnes | 1 | 10155538645051509_10155538764166509 | I guess since men can't handle the side effects of a birth control pill like women do, they just contract the Zika virus to shrink their testicals.
14 | Hamidreza Azarmehr | 41 | 10155538645051509_10155538648116509 | Remember when Obama said his administration would be the most transparent in history? Well thanks to Wikileaks's now they are, and now they're all pissed about it, liberal hypocrisy at its finest
15 | Pat Wallace | 1 | 10155538645051509_10155538777086509 | It appears that mice testicles aren't the only thing shrinking. Integrity at CNN is shrinking. CNN's mild admonishment of Donna Brazile shows that they aren't very disturbed by the corruption going on at the network.
16 | Nicolle Martin | 4 | 10155538645051509_10155538694161509 | CNN brain shrunk to nothing......the country is falling apart..CNN has liars on there staff and they are  worried about testicles.....did they just hire.....WEINER..
17 | Mae Swope | 0 | 10155538645051509_10155538922931509 | Yikes more wasteful spending of tax money and grant money from this country.....no offense it's too late these pregnant women w/Zika have to handle it if it effects a baby boy.

18 | Lito Villegas | 0 | 10155538645051509_10155538962001509 | Thats animal abuse! Why not try it on gays and lgbts.......theyre more than happy to have their testicles shrink 1/10 of their size, easier to cut.
19 | Carl Greerio | 1 | 10155538645051509_10155538779751509 | CNN=CORRUPT NEWS NETWORK.. bottom of the barrel..and their journalists..they are NOT journalists ..obviously they moved the barrel and dug under it to get them....CNN are a gossip network...they should be ashamed of themselves!!!
20 | Jeff A. Johnson | 5 | 10155538645051509_10155538669511509 | Uh-oh...once Amurica learns that this disease could harm MEN... NOW it's time for action.
21 | Lee Pintor | 16 | 10155538645051509_10155538658576509 | CNN, where is your story about interim DNC chair Donna Brazile resigning her position with you today after being caught secretly emailing the Clinton campaign (at least two) questions--and then lying about it, like they always do--for the CNN debates? #Draintheswamp
22 | Lucas Max | 5 | 10155538645051509_10155538683836509 | Weird, CNN's recent news stories have the same affect on me.
23 | Larry Loomis | 2 | 10155538645051509_10155538652316509 | So do steroids...and millions of bodybuilders and athletes still use them....
24 | Danka Danuta | 3 | 10155538645051509_10155538683216509 | And that is going to spur serious and effective research because men cannot have or handle shrinking testicles.
25 | Cheryl Woods | 8 | 10155538645051509_10155538650736509 | Maybe because they had to listen to a liberal banshee!

Donald J. Trump said Hillary Clinton is a "terrible example" for children, including his 10-year-old son, as he lambasted her for getting a tip on a question in a town hall during the Democratic primary
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Michael Bowman | 1727 | 10155538554071509_10155538555406509 | Trump's logic: "deleting emails is a bad example to children but groping women is acceptable and joking about it is locker room banter." Sounds reasonable to me...
2 | Clay Leak | 1193 | 10155538554071509_10155538554426509 | CNN, where is your story about interim DNC chair Donna Brazile resigning her position with you today after being caught secretly emailing the Clinton campaign (at least two) questions--and then lying about it, like they always do--for the CNN debates? #Draintheswamp
3 | Angelo Morena | 777 | 10155538554071509_10155538555066509 | The real issue in this latest Donna Brazile scandal is that Hillary Clinton cheated! Clinton took the questions in secrecy to give herself the advantage over her opponents. She is the cheater and liar we should be most concerned about. That is the point.That being said, the White House defended Donna Brazile today and falsely claimed she wasn’t a DNC head when she gave the questions to Hillary Clinton....Time to drain the swamp
4 | Roger Trump | 767 | 10155538554071509_10155538556201509 | Hillary is such a champion for women's rights and protecting children that she has chosen to attack the FBI investigation of a pedophile she is associated with, without a single word about his multiple underage female victims. Nothing changes with Hillary.
5 | Hector Gabriel Camejo Otero | 525 | 10155538554071509_10155538556811509 | Says the sexual predator Trump and the stripper Melania! 😂😂😂😂😂😂
6 | Billy Willis | 378 | 10155538554071509_10155538563626509 | Between him groping women and Clinton deleting emails, I would probably have to say groping women would be a lot worse of an example to set for a child. That's just me though.
7 | Jairo Jair Ramirez | 482 | 10155538554071509_10155538559886509 | Clinton is a terrible example for kids ? Trump has harrased and created hatered everywhere he goes. He talks about groping women and says it's Locker Room talk. He's is the worst example and role model for any human being!!
8 | Terry W Johnson | 209 | 10155538554071509_10155538568221509 | lol what a joke a man saying she is a bad example for his son, how about you grabbing women and being a sexual predator and pedophile, that child should be nowhere near you and if it wasn't for the money his wife wouldn't even be with him
9 | Heidi Johnston Bales | 190 | 10155538554071509_10155538576961509 | So knowing a question is worse than sexually assaulting women, cheating people out of their life savings, refusing to pay vendors, employees, and lawyers, and colluding with the enemy???????  Mr. Trump you are not only delusional, but the most sociopathic person I've ever known.
10 | David Shine | 198 | 10155538554071509_10155538557786509 | The most terrible example, a man who can't accept responsibility for being a fraud... even children can pick it up...
11 | Venus Kone | 91 | 10155538554071509_10155538568921509 | Hey Donald Trump Are you good example for your sons and daughters!!???You are mentally and physically sick!!Money is the only reason that your kids and wife stands by your side!
12 | Michael Molineaux | 62 | 10155538554071509_10155538574096509 | This coming from the man who would grab your teenage daughter or teenage granddaughter in-between their legs because he's a celebrity and feels entitled... The only person who is a risk to children is DONALD J. TRUMP!
13 | Linda Lange | 45 | 10155538554071509_10155538591226509 | I'm sure his wife giving a plagiarized speech is a good example for his son! Wait till Barron sees all the nude photos of his mom on the Internet!! Those are good things too I guess! Maybe he can take his son to his rape trial coming up in December!!
14 | Sheila Jasper | 65 | 10155538554071509_10155538560656509 | I'm pretty sure Cinnamon Hitler would like voters to focus on the FBI’s continuing investigation of Hillary Clinton’s email server —but instead questions about his own legal troubles have been raised again. This pervert raped a little girl when she was only 13 years old. She filed a lawsuit in December of 2015..
15 | 児玉源太郎 | 35 | 10155538554071509_10155538592906509 | Trump look at yourself in the mirror. You are a bad example to all people in the entire world. You cheated on your ex wives, you are an adulterer, liar, and etc etc etc etc. You are a military dodger and a pussy graber. You have filled so many bankruptcies and cheated many people by not paying them. You will go to court in November and December for fraud and rape of a 13 year old. You are dirtier.
16 | Alli Buckley | 43 | 10155538554071509_10155538590801509 | So Hillary Clinton is a bad example for his son but not him.....the actual parent who mocks people,gropes women,cheats on his wives ,admittedly forces himself on a married woman,bullies people ,makes sexist comments.....the list literally goes on and on......
17 | Shawn Gabo | 46 | 10155538554071509_10155538581156509 | Is this Oorange Oompa Loompa for real? I'm so sick of seeing his disgusting face in my facebook page... I can't wait for this election to be over! #NeverTrump #ByeByeFelicia #Deploreble #OrangeAnus? lol...
18 | Angela Williams | 19 | 10155538554071509_10155538573916509 | She is a horrible example for kids, I have 6 so I can speak with experience. I would never want my kids to lie, deceive, steal, cheat, and kill their way to the top.
19 | Eyal Salseroshtein | 22 | 10155538554071509_1777812822486324 | “He is a sexual predator, hasn’t released his tax returns, and has used his foundation’s money to pay his legal fees. He has abused the family of a war hero and … oh, but let’s talk about some emails Hillary didn’t send from someone else’s computer..."
20 | Jorge G Almada | 32 | 10155538554071509_10155538576601509 | And of course Trump's polite manners, selflessness, abnegation, dedication to the poor, appreciation for minorities, honesty, tax genius, never filing for fake bankruptcies, and many other qualities are a shining example for his ten year old. Sure. In what planet?
21 | Lora Grigonis | 24 | 10155538554071509_10155538576886509 | Please stop yelling is what Trump thinks, says or does unless he is dropping out of the race, releasing his tax returns, admitting he is trying to sell the US to Putin, paying all the people he stiffed, paying his taxes, or is exiling himself.
22 | Steve Bench | 38 | 10155538554071509_10155538569746509 | Trump's conduct has really stuck in my mind, maybe because the media has focused on it, or maybe because he's bullied and mocked so many people in front of the camera.  He's not a good example or representative of Americans.  We are better than him.
23 | Taylor Renn | 13 | 10155538554071509_10155538593561509 | You have no credibility anymore, CNN. You're the most biased news source around. All you do is slam Trump at any opportunity while turning a blind eye to the handful of scandals Hillary is involved in.
24 | Dianna Kim Scott | 10 | 10155538554071509_10155538611231509 | I would say your a terrible example for your own son you racist pig, pervert, sexual predator, misogynistic woman hater, a person who hates Mexican lawyers, hates anyone who says a bad word against him, doesn't pay his workers, doesn't pay taxes. Yeah I'd say your a great example for your son.
25 | Maricela Brambila | 22 | 10155538554071509_10155538610426509 | What I am about to tell you are facts:Only Donald Trump admitted to sexually assaulting women. Only Donald Trump didn't know the military didn't have a court system to deal with rapes in the military. Only Donald Trump talks about knowing more about ISIS than the generals yet he had his daddy buy him 5 deferments from the military to avoid military service. Only Donald Trump has gone bankrupt six times. Only Donald Trump has openly used donations to veterans collected then deposited to his personal and illegal foundation and use that money to pay for lawsuit settlements, but a self portrait, a signed football helmet and "donate" to the Florida attorney general so she wouldn't open and investigation in to the plethora of fraud complaints against his so called trump university. Only Donald Trump has over 200 lawsuits for fraud and racketeering pending in court. Only Donald Trump would have a pro Russian lobbyist as his campaign manager. Only Donald Trump would illegally do business with Iran, Russia and Cuba when it was illegal to do so. Only Donald Trump has zero political experience. Only Donald Trump is despised by the leaders of his own party which will severely limit what he can accomplish if he wins. Only Donald Trump has alienated world leaders. Only Donald Trump wants the proliferation of Nuclear weapons. Only Donald Trump made racist comments about Mexicans, Jews and Muslims. Only Donald Trump publicly made fun of a person with a handicap. Only Donald Trump called for women to be punished if they had an abortion. Only Donald Trump told his supporters to hurt people protesting at his rallies leading to people getting sucker punched as they left. Only Donald Trump has not released his tax returns. Only Donald Trump admitted to not paying federal income taxes. Only Donald Trump has called women fat, pigs and disgusting etc. Only Donald Trump blames the media for publicizing things that come out of his own mouth. Only Donald Trump has said he will support a peaceful transition of power but only if he wins. Only Donald Trump talks about keeping jobs in the US then sends his own company's jobs overseas. Only Donald Trump talks about the importance of improving the state of our economy and then used steel from china and room furniture and accessories from foreign countries to build and furnish his hotels.Should I go on? I still have the pending FBI investigation in to Trumps business dealing and campaign solicitation schemes! 😱

2 | Silvia Dinneen | 476 | 10155538468611509_10155538478661509 | Wow, are the Chinese so cold, uncaring, and jaded that all those motorist just swerved around him and not one person stopped to help. That would never happen in the USA.
3 | Simmy Taub | 178 | 10155538468611509_10155538476786509 | Nice, but what the hell is wrong with the imbeciles who just kept on driving?!
4 | Brad Allen | 79 | 10155538468611509_10155538506561509 | Haha everyone is talking about what they would do. Yes, in America you jump out and "save this kid", but not before you made sure your camera was on record.
5 | Candace Hirsch | 23 | 10155538468611509_10155538533116509 | Handed him back to his parents?  Hardly!  Though he did look like he said a few strong words to the mom.  Can't believe all the people driving by as if it was common place.
6 | Sherry Walker Lacey | 49 | 10155538468611509_10155538483941509 | It amazes me that people are so heartless that they don't all stop and get the little boy to safety. I have done more for animals than these people have even tried to do. All traffic stop, until baby is safe. It's that simple. It's unreal the police officer was the only one to help. Thank you sir for protecting and serving. I'm glad this turned out with good results.
7 | Lucy Garcia | 21 | 10155538468611509_10155538549586509 | Yep. Not surprised with Chinese ppl. I remember a video where a little girl was hit by a car and nobody stop and not even pedestrian stopped and help. Ppl passed next to her like nothing. They are like ants. So many they don't even care if someone is dying or hurt. Smh
8 | Sara Ellis | 15 | 10155538468611509_10155538495341509 | There are way too many videos like this where children are in some sort of peril on the streets of china and are just ignored! Traffic or no, who doesn't risk their life for a child's?! Get it together, society! 😡
9 | 陈小亮 | 7 | 10155538468611509_10155538734546509 | as a chinese i feel shame no one out car to take the boy to safty. good policeman. i believe no one want the boy hurt they just dont realize or ignore the dangerous. also i saw another vedio that a man pull a boy out of an accident but he was hit by a truck himself, so let's all believe that good things are far nore than bad things.
10 | Dailyn Aimée Ortega | 7 | 10155538468611509_10155538560071509 | Why is everybody so hung up on the negative side of this story and lo and behold.... talking about politics. Thank God that little boy is safe, that his mother got a good scolding from the police officer (at least that's what it looks like to me) so that hopefully she won't be so careless next time and on the bright side the little boy just had the ride of his life! Have a great day everyone! ✌️️
11 | Zheng Hao Liu | 3 | 10155538468611509_10155538528851509 | What make the strengh of a nation are the values that it shares between it's people, no other external things! Chinese leader thinks that whith a strong economy and military, the chinese nation could rise, that's totally false!
12 | Nick Tarnowski | 3 | 10155538468611509_10155538715631509 | Savages! In America it would not matter of color, democrat, republican, etc. WE WOULD OF STOPPED IMMEDIATELY to do the obvious. Do these people have a conscience?
13 | Elvira Esmeralda Bravo | 2 | 10155538468611509_10155538625486509 | Really?  Are we surprised no motorists stopped?  I can't hardly keep up with all the motorists that not respect school zones, speeding (when there is no reason to) much less those who see a police car (yes is the law now to move over and slow down) and don't move over  (until a close friend is injured then they complain about it ). From Texas! No, I am not moving to another country,  nor tell me to go back to Mexico. If we all try to follow and respect traffic laws, we will probably have less fatalities in our roads!
14 | Marsha Young | 2 | 10155538468611509_10155538511016509 | CNN...The truth came out through wiki about Donna Brazile. You knew about this week's ago yet true to your initials, Clinton Network News, you sat on it. If there are any journalists left among you, RUN. This network just lost credibility.  I miss al Jazeera!
15 | Mohammed Awwal | 1 | 10155538468611509_10155538618001509 | Look how the officer respectfully returned the boy to his ward.If it was Dubai, parent would probably have to  pay thousands of dollars in fine and kid would be subject to traumatic experiences, held away from his parents for weeks. Difference between being human and being a lifeless plank of wood.
16 | Ricardo Pantoja Hernandez | 5 | 10155538468611509_10155538497481509 | No wonder that place is so polluted,they never let there cars rest,even if it's to save a little baby's life..I would hate to live there.. it's the times we live in now
17 | Ann Nilla | 1 | 10155538468611509_687454721419341 | Wtf??? Why would people not stop!!!! What world we live in that people would see kid in the middle of traffic and not responsibly care enough to stop!!!!! A bus zoomed on by !! WTF????? What country is this???? Heartless people live there!!! SHAME ON THEM!!!!!!
18 | Mervyn Jui Meng Tan | 4 | 10155538468611509_10155538562461509 | Sadly, this is one of a great many videotaped incidents of child endangerment and tragically witnessed road accident or near accidents from 🇨🇳China. Life is cheap there I suppose‼️
19 | Christian Noé | 1 | 10155538468611509_10155538582051509 | Yes, I guessed it CHINA!!!! Just like that one video where the person runs overs the baby and just leaves!! Incredible!
20 | Mamaa Fejo | 1 | 10155538468611509_10155538492916509 | That's the problem nowdays all those people didn't bothered most probably punch kad worriesWhereas this Policeman has got no punchkad blues Is their job to  rescue n  haress people 24hrs daily An ordinary workers views vill be brushed aside by his suoperior 😊 👮💃 x
21 | Robert DOnofrio | 1 | 10155538468611509_10155538643806509 | I don't know about China, but many other countries don't have the safety trafic laws that we have in the US. Therefore it is common place and not to excuse it but drivers are more cautious because of it. Whats really disturbing is that a parent would allow this.
22 | Trung Dinh | 0 | 10155538468611509_10155538641061509 | It seems whatever bad all from China. I used to see two little girls climbed and teetered in an advertising board next to a cliff and easy to fall down while their mother was chatting. I was so surprised because no one showed any attention and even when I tried to stop them, one man said 'Don't touch others' children'. and I'm not Chinese and living in Australia.
23 | Monday Adam Marsters Poaiti | 0 | 10155538468611509_690135234470712 | Cant believed that no one would have stopped and help this kid up, what kind of human being are we, so sad, if that the case, we should start banding Asian into New Zealand. Lucky the kid got saved by police officer.
24 | Howard Liu | 0 | 10155538468611509_690145351136367 | 你们这些美国人不了解中国的国情，帮助别人有时候会摊上事，扶摔倒老人会被赖上的神奇国度。如果你不停车，只要不撞到他就不关你的事，你停车下来救小孩说不定旁边跳出来人说你拐卖儿童让你赔钱。中国社会现状就是这样，人心冷漠。If u can't read Chinese and really want to know what I'm saying, just use the google translator plz.
25 | Michael Greenstein | 2 | 10155538468611509_10155538500866509 | I can't believe CNN have Donna Brazile the debate questions in advance to give to Hillary. Doesn't CNN Jane any confidence in her?

1 | Nick Myer | 1152 | 10155538373141509_10155538381511509 | Typical Republicans. When faced with losing they resort to violence. When faced with facts they resort to lies and deflection. The Deplorable Party lives up to it's name.
2 | William Holley | 685 | 10155538373141509_10155538383891509 | He should be forced to resign...sorry excuse of a politician to say something as responsible as this....especially since there are lunatics that would take his words as a call to action.
3 | Jennifer Strickland Gilcrease | 397 | 10155538373141509_10155538384616509 | Horrible remarks, regardless of political party. He also clearly showed he is not willing to work for the good of the people in a bipartisan way.

5 | Jodi Simmons | 128 | 10155538373141509_10155538433356509 | Truly tired of hearing these types of remarks. Also tired of hearing how the Grand Ole Party wants to block filling the spot on the Supreme Court. We need to vote these idiots out! Their filibusters and wasted time this past 8 years has not earned them a place in our government. It has earned them a ticket out of Washington.
6 | Prince Phillips | 111 | 10155538373141509_10155538451101509 | F@$k Republicans and F@$k Donald Trump, they are evil and deplorable. I pray that they lose next week, I hope that despite the media and all the help Donald Trump has gotten Hillary wins about 400 electoral votes. That would be a statement!!!!
7 | Mike Wagner | 137 | 10155538373141509_10155538396991509 | republicans have turned into a pack of murderous lunatics. this is not a Halloween joke. we need to make some serious changes in this country. Electing Hillary Clinton is priority #1, getting rid of right wing psychos is #2 on the list.
8 | Shannon Flavin | 78 | 10155538373141509_10155538473016509 | Senator Burr, how would you feel if this were to actually happen? Could you look her daughter and grandchildren in the face and tell them that you find it amusing that someone shot and killed their mother and grandmother and that you suggested that someone do so? You're a dispicable man.
9 | Brian Alan Whatcott | 60 | 10155538373141509_10155538432681509 | Hmm - a senator inciting homicide on a presidential candidate - itn't that Illegal? Well, yes: but he's a Republican senator, so he has better things to do than mess with the SS - it's the FBI he's into!  <grin>
10 | Marti White | 50 | 10155538373141509_10155538401276509 | Even AFTER Hillary Clinton become President, Americans and other decent people of the World, will still be Shaken-up pretty badly; from the actual knowledge that ; ONCE upon a time there was an actual THING called trump that happened on this land.
11 | Linda Har | 21 | 10155538373141509_10155538479621509 | All this dangerous talk has GOT to stop!!!! These deplorables think that as long as they say "I misspoke" after the fact, that it makes it all go away.  This hatred, un-American and undemocratic  crap has gone beyond normal partisan behavior.  Vote blue and let's stand for what's decent and good in people!  Remember, when they go low, we go high. Now get out and vote!
12 | Debbie Barrett OMary | 19 | 10155538373141509_10155538471926509 | No different than Trump it's on audio.  He needs to be immediately removed from Congress.  Words are like a bullet once the trigger is pulled too late damage done!
13 | Camille Isaacs-Wood | 16 | 10155538373141509_10155538468616509 | Why are these jackasses even in politics, I swear this election bringing out these  fools true colors, am so sick of these Republicans I want this election to be over already.
14 | Jorge Mexico Grande | 16 | 10155538373141509_10155538477496509 | Will Trump activate the nuclear code if a foreign leader calls him short-fingered vulgarian? The answer is a definitive YES. If election season did not provide enough clues into his behavioral disposition, I don´t want to know what will.  Yes, chances are the U.S. electorate can self-inflict wounds that will not heal in an entire era
15 | Justin Roberts | 43 | 10155538373141509_10155538381691509 | When is Bernie Sanders going to hold a press conference rescending his endorsement of Clinton in light of the newest wikileaks involving Donna Brazille, oh that's right.. the socialist is enjoying his $600K lakefront property paid for by Clinton Inc.
16 | Susie Shelton | 18 | 10155538373141509_10155538473356509 | Vote out the republican congress. This country needs Hillary and Kaine plus a Democrat Congress. Get out and vote democrat up and down the ballot
17 | Affa Jones | 10 | 10155538373141509_10155538402326509 | Im guessing somebody is gonna say he should resign now.......what possible example are these politicians setting for the younger and impressionable generation. God help us al!!!!
18 | Lida Giachetti | 26 | 10155538373141509_10155538417501509 | I used to be tolerant of republicans. No more. They prove every day that they will do anything to keep their gravy train rolling from the Koch brothers and other billionaires. They are deplorable. No morals. No values.
19 | Jackie Watts Fromm | 21 | 10155538373141509_10155538393201509 | Just for once can one of you please stop blaming everybody but Clinton for her investigative troubles that seem to appear all the time. Just once please. This has nothing to do with Democrats or Republicans or the FBI and has to do with criminal acts all the time carried out by HRC and crew.
20 | Hugh Clark | 15 | 10155538373141509_10155538414741509 | , hopefully nothing will ever happen to her but if someone does get out of line and shoots her then he should be held responsible for accessory
21 | Laura Kangas Weeks | 12 | 10155538373141509_10155538455726509 | What it is with all the comments and wishes of death upon an opponent in this election season? My god.  What is this country coming to? That is never anything to even joke about.
22 | Lani Curran | 8 | 10155538373141509_10155538422666509 | To quote Greg Gutfeld (sort of):  Old white guys should realize they are being recorded.  If they are too dumb to figure that out they need to go.
23 | Frances Caires | 5 | 10155538373141509_1418023938497196 | DISGUSTING!! That's a death threat!! If anybody else made a threat like this, he/she would be arrested, WHY can Trump, his followers, and Burr make these threats on Hillary Clinton's life and get away with it??
24 | Daniel Barron | 6 | 10155538373141509_1776467589263508 | So we disagree with other people's political views so we decide violence is the answer. No room for this kind of talks in America. He needs to resign or be kicked out
25 | Tanya Walker | 5 | 10155538373141509_1776471025929831 | Add him to the watch list...threatening either candidate with shooting.  Uncalled for and he should be sanctioned for such an irresponsible statement.  Hopefully the Secret Service has had a discussion with him.He needs to grow up.

John Kasich wrote in John McCain's name at the top of the ticket instead of voting for Donald J. Trump
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Dan White | 1531 | 10155538275616509_10155538277366509 | CNN going extra mile on Trump bashing since it's been caught giving clinton the questions for the debate.
2 | Jaron Hicks | 898 | 10155538275616509_10155538283741509 | Well at least he's not fake endorsing Trump like every other republican is doing. Stand your ground Kasich!
3 | Sherry Cooledge Townsend | 672 | 10155538275616509_10155538299656509 | I would have voted for Kasich  but you haters who thought it was cool to vote for someone that bullies and calls names .. since I can't stand Trump I am crossing the river and voting for Hillary. CNN had nothing to do with it...it is Trump himself period.
4 | Tam Thomas | 364 | 10155538275616509_10155538277226509 | For democrats, corruption is ok. Pure libs are communist bigots who love brainwashing propaganda instead of balanced news and facts. Real progressives see the 100 day plan and policy speeches of Trump as pro-growth and pro-America solutions for our county, and will vote accordingly.DRAIN THE SWAMP 🇺🇸 VOTE EARLY!
5 | Daniel Andrews | 170 | 10155538275616509_10155538313371509 | Turns out he was the only real Republican in the race with a backbone for principle. It's a shame, because he would have beaten Hillary in a landslide. But no, Trump voters had to have "tells it like it is" orange Hitler, and now Hillary will be President.
6 | Scott Bullard | 168 | 10155538275616509_10155538287481509 | I'm glad to see that some Republicans are standing up and not voting for Don The Con.The way he was shuffled into being the GOP nominee is shameful,and will be a black mark against the party forever.And for the record,I am not a Clinton supporter.
7 | Sean Jackson | 87 | 10155538275616509_10155538341356509 | Kasich was the only candidate polling better against Hillary. Most of the time by double digits ahead of Hillary. Republicans missed the boat on beating Hillary. Instead they nominated a man that misleads and lies more than a regular politician.

9 | Michael Jankiewicz | 50 | 10155538275616509_10155538308116509 | We were counting on Kasich not being American. Still in last place CNN. Need to find who was giving Donna debate questions, that is actually news. Remember News, what you are to be doing?
10 | Clif Dc | 26 | 10155538275616509_10155538337631509 | Not a fan of John Kasich but let's hope other Republicans follow suit, It matters more that it is happening in a battle ground state.
11 | David Caldwell | 31 | 10155538275616509_10155538312111509 | What a sore loser. I'm watching Democrat tv all day once they announce that Trump is the president, especially CNN with all of their fake polls.
12 | Giovanni Moretti | 20 | 10155538275616509_1824338884477571 | Kasich is probably one of the most decent republicans left in the party all others will sink with the trump ship..

I am sure if we go through every sec of states emails, there will never be an end.Hillary, we are behind you.The dump groper has no hope.
14 | Jake Green | 12 | 10155538275616509_1276815309017293 | GOP coming in to crash and burn alongside the Democrats. This election has proved that the difference between the Clintons and the Bushes is purely cosmetic. Trump's coming with a broom, it's time to sweep out the garbage.
15 | Denny Alexander | 13 | 10155538275616509_753343211471821 | I'm a Democrat but I always said this,  Kasich was more capable of running against hillary than any of the other GOP clowns.. but Kasich was just too normal for the deplorables hahahahhahaha
16 | Jayesh Patel | 20 | 10155538275616509_10155538333206509 | CNN, grow up and do your job right. Where's hillary Clinton's crap you are to show us. If not no point of firing of Donna Brazile and still have more hillary Clinton's paid Analysts bashing Trump.

18 | Tom Hansen | 12 | 10155538275616509_753330364806439 | Lol! That's a great example to set for new voters! Vote for someone that has a snowballs chance in hell of winning, and waste your vote. What an idiot! Glad he didn't get elected...
19 | Teresa Polek-Cummiskey | 10 | 10155538275616509_1824343861143740 | Dear Republican Party, you. Should have invested in a candidate like John Kasich, someone with integrity that we could have stood behind , instead you left us no choice but to vote against the party.
20 | Benjamin MrClean Sturms | 18 | 10155538275616509_1824337217811071 | He just lost any chance at running for President if this is true. I'd like to see him run again, but I'll just write in Donald Trump if he should ever win the nomination down the road. We don't forget.
21 | Stefani Sangalang | 14 | 10155538275616509_10155538347371509 | Don't vote for Hillary Clinton. She has a problem being ethical. Donald Trump just has a problem with controlling his words.#MAGA#KASICHSORELOSER
22 | Shane Snyder | 5 | 10155538275616509_1276867819012042 | To those complaining about how horrible both Trump and Clinton are, remember: WE put them there. They didn't just show up. There was a primary. There were 16 other Republicans. There were two other Democrats (however, the argument can be made that the Democrat primary was rigged). If feel you're always choosing the lesser of two evils every four years, then you're not doing it right. The issue isn't the politician, it's our apathy. Get involved. Educate yourself on the issues. Vote your values, every election (local, primary, general, etc). WE run this country. The politicians work for US. If you're not happy with the current situation stop complaining and start making a difference.
23 | Jaroslava Struk | 13 | 10155538275616509_10155538351066509 | Had the republicans chosen Kasich as their candidate, they would have pulled in votes from democrats, independents, undecided and won the House.  Instead, they chose an ignoramus in Trump.  Too bad, so sad.
24 | Roque Coral | 21 | 10155538275616509_10155538309456509 | It's sad, the Republican Party as we know it is vanishing. The Kasich's, Bush's and McCain's are being pushed out by the alt-right and tea partiers.
25 | Mike Adams | 5 | 10155538275616509_1276828135682677 | See John, if you hated minorities, gays and women and you lied almost every time you opened your mouth, didn't pay your bills or federal income taxes and you bragged about grabbing women in the p***y, the Republicans would have you running for president..but you're a good person so I didn't get the chance to vote for you. .you know the saying..#NEVERTRUMP

For children and teens, using cell phones, tablets and computers (especially at night) is associated with losing sleep time and sleep quality

1 | Brian Isgrigg | 81 | 10155538182311509_10155538187456509 | This is news! With all the corruption from the Hillary campaign this is what you report on! What a Crappy News Network!!
2 | Shawn Rogers | 12 | 10155538182311509_10155538283641509 | What happened to parents being parents and putting their foot down, if a child is on the computer, cell phone, tablet whatever and it's a school night and they should sleeping tell them to turn it off. If they disobey take it from them, plain and simple.
3 | Dyke Stewart | 6 | 10155538182311509_10155538189846509 | Also losing their freedom and getting killed by strangers, because of having their own phones, tablets and computers. Parents need a parental lock on these items. And kids should be monitored while using the electronics and shouldn't have them in their own rooms.
4 | Job Basiimwa | 3 | 10155538182311509_10155538208451509 | These Americans ranting here about their elections should know that CNN serves the whole world not USA alone. why do you want to campaign over posts that even have nothing to do with politics?
5 | Gloria Fernandez | 0 | 10155538182311509_10155538408461509 | Many parents are presently mistaking this epidemic with depression. I strongly suggest for parents to set and maintain reasonable boundaries. Further, sadly our youth are learning the obsessive behaviors from their parents who have difficulty putting the phones down.
6 | Michael Greenstein | 0 | 10155538182311509_10155538506181509 | I can't believe that CNN supplied Donna brazile with the debate questions ahead of time to slip to Hillary Clinton. Doesn't CNN have any confidence in the candidate that they are backing?
7 | Liz Esquivel Martinez | 1 | 10155538182311509_10155538459831509 | Very simple- be a parent and take all their stuff away at a designated time. Don't allow them to have their electronic gadgets in their room. When I tell my kids their time is up, they know to turn their gadgets over to us.
8 | Bob Smith | 1 | 10155538182311509_10155538308991509 | The Clinton News Network confirmed Trump's claim about a rigged election by reports that one of their employees passed debate questions to shrillary in advance of the debate.

10 | James Pilz | 3 | 10155538182311509_10155538192776509 | Maybe that's how hilldog got so sloppy with the emails and having paedophiles work for her.  Get some sleep Hillary or just wait for prison whichever works ;)

Libraries still exist. And yes, no cell phones for my kids after 7:00pm, no video games were allowed in my home....Period!! And computer time, in the family room was done at 9:00!!! No tablets. Bedtime consisted of reading an actual book!!! I get sick of hearing about the computer world. Take control, it's a privilege, not a right!!
16 | Hamidreza Azarmehr | 3 | 10155538182311509_10155538188266509 | There is no one else who could have survived all the repercussions from past like Hillary has. That has changed and it will come out eventually. My hope is that all this corruption gets exposed for what it is. The Clinton's are masters of manipulation and think they are above the law. Wikileaks has opened this up for all to see.

We are noticing the Establishment never punishes this sh--! People resign, get fired, step down...NO ONE GOES TO JAIL!! CNN HAD to let her go to appear to be at least a little neutral, so I'm waiting for her friggin PUNISHMENT! Yours too, CNN. That's a YUGE crime and I'm pissed off about the many ways the system is #rigged. How about we cut off the CORRUPT BRANCHES?!? #CNNEstablishment #MafiaMedia
2 | Dave Ball | 107 | 10155538107406509_10155538139786509 | Hey CNN, now that you guys are sharing inside information (i.e. Donna Brazile) I was wondering if you might share tomorrow night's winning Mega Millions Lottery numbers with me.... I could use a little advantage too....
3 | Mobimba Domingo Jose | 23 | 10155538107406509_10155538343381509 | The theory of evolution is a product of imaginations of atheists. It makes absolutely no sense and is beyond ridiculous. How did life learn to create itself? How can life evolve entirely without any intervention of a higher being? Any interpretation of science that attempts to remove God from involvement with origins is utter nonsense, period.

7 | Otto Wulff | 4 | 10155538107406509_10155538419411509 | Why do I get the feeling CNN is trying to say blacks are descended from apes and or monkeys. Whites don't have those facial features but CNN knows blacks do. CNN we all came from Adam and Eve  made in the image of God yet you keep pushing this trash on blacks.
8 | Chris Sousa | 3 | 10155538107406509_10155538216391509 | Well there's about 15% of all humans that have Neanderthal ancestry but having a species entirely doesn't seem likely .

She will start her presidency the same way that Bill ended his:  under investigation, corruptive behavior, arguing the definition of "it", and the list goes on.

11 | Frances Lee Okutoro | 32 | 10155538001861509_1782735385284545 | I like Gary Johnson. He doesn't have baggage. He doesn't have scandal.  He isn't caught up in drama. He is fair and reasonable compared to the two horrible canidates. Yeah, he didn't know about Aleppo but he was honest about it. I like that in a canidate and I'm casting my vote for him.
12 | Nader Adel | 30 | 10155538001861509_10155538036391509 | Reading all the comments, I came to the conclusion that people hate trump so much more than they love america. I can see why they don't support trump but I just can't see why they keep defending Hillary, even tho. She has done nothing to benefit them. And scandals are surrounding her. I am a middle eastern immigrant and I can see that Clinton destroyed Libya and created an ISIS stronghold and armed the rebel in Syria that started the civil war causing 1000s of death. And it will probably take them a min. After they read my comment To start calling me all kind of names.
13 | Amy Martin | 19 | 10155538001861509_10155538023446509 | He's guessing. Yikes. If he has pertinent information to share, why dosen't he share it? Right now not even the investigators in the case know what's in the emails.
14 | Rickey Ricardo Rickard | 19 | 10155538001861509_10155538027886509 | Really? From the same man who didn't know what a modern day event like Aleppo was but he can remember back to Watergate? I'm not buying it. Have a 💺
15 | Ngweze Ngweze | 15 | 10155538001861509_10155538033076509 | I watched in amusement Trump thank some fools for the new developments. All it does, it paints Trump as a greedy person who wants to be in the white house by force, someone who does the finger pointing and he will be happy when his rivals and people he hate suffer while he enjoys merry..he might as well rape the whitehouse puppies
16 | Will Keeler | 18 | 10155538001861509_10155538038081509 | Hell-he doesn't even have a clue about Aleppo...how could he even know the meaning of impeachment!? ImWithHer
17 | Ian Valles | 11 | 10155538001861509_10155538049751509 | This guy is such a joke. How high is he? On second thought, that's an insult to my pot smoking pals. Why is he soooo disconnected from his VP nominee? Bill Weld has been slowly but surely pushing Libertarians towards Hillary, and condemned this FBI B.S and Comey's action as completely inappropriate, meanwhile Mr. Munchies is a spouting off this ignorance while on his latest crusade to find a bag of cheese puffs...
18 | Keith Alan Gordon | 13 | 10155538001861509_10155538053891509 | Aleppo Gary, It does not matter if Hillary was the Virgin Mary,  Congress's life time goal is impeachment of Hillary.  So get off the weed and out of the election.
19 | Vincent Alexander | 17 | 10155538001861509_10155538019731509 | I doubt that. It is strange that WikiLeaks is going after the Democratic party and not one leak about the Republican party. It shows that something is really fishy. GOP's have skeletons in their closets too. Now no one thinks that this election isn't rigged? Yes it is.
20 | Randy Maginn | 5 | 10155538001861509_10155538086011509 | CNN, Fox. You guys may be different but you're all the same, biased, unethical and arrogant. The media has turned the corner......and going downhill at breakneck speed. How many more Donna Braziles do you have hiding in your closet.
21 | Mary Davis | 10 | 10155538001861509_10155538056841509 | Please.Johnson is trying to take a last breath. He will never win. His Allepo moment can't be redeemed unless he comes back sharp as a tack next time around, and totally give up the pot smoking.
22 | Dean Barboza | 4 | 10155538001861509_1169211296503528 | OK . Jerk off's this is a family day for kids and family's to have fun on Halloween. Why don't you all go to your families and tell them you love them and have fun for the day and get over your selfs. I did my mail in ballot  today and it was like voting to die by cancer of die in a plane crash. We are so screwed.
23 | Shanon Letellier | 9 | 10155538001861509_10155538082991509 | and a gary johnson presidency would end in insolvency, debt, anger and a government that can no longer provide protection to the people. I'll take an impeachment over that.
24 | Rick Friedman | 8 | 10155538001861509_10155538037321509 | I love it and the way she barked at Megan Kelly for daring to insinuate  that she would do such a thing after the first email ..what a fool she looks like now I bet she's too ashamed to even show her face
25 | Michelle MacCutcheon | 6 | 10155538001861509_10155538054821509 | All in for the most executive experience on any ticket, both elected in landslides for the second term as governors, honesty and integrity to boot! Go Gary Johnson and Bill Weld!!#President#GaryJohnson2016

This little girl conquered cancer, but the bullying that came afterward proved to be too much, her mother said.

1 | Tracey Lewis Wright | 2459 | 10155537888561509_10155537920656509 | If I found out my child was bullying another child, they wouldn't be able to sit for a month of Sundays. Parents need to start being parents and quit worrying about whether or not their children "like" them.
2 | Dennis W Khisa | 2228 | 10155537888561509_10155537895636509 | Cant beleive people are turning this into a political discussion anyone brings up trump or Hillary especially deplorables , is a sick human being who deserves to be euthanized ..don't you people have any shame? This little girls story and life is more important than your orange Buffon of a candidate.you people are desensitized and mentally unstable..thanks for showing us your true colors..you don't care about human lives just your politics..and wonder why they call you deplorable..
3 | Laura Tilton | 1189 | 10155537888561509_10155537913876509 | This infuriates me!!!! My oldest is a cancer survivor and was bullied all of the time because of his hair loss! Why are kids so mean???!!!!! Prayers for the girls family!
4 | Cer Ern | 1117 | 10155537888561509_10155537890521509 | Bullying must stop. They need more education on this.
5 | John Marceneck | 802 | 10155537888561509_10155537897091509 | I hate being human. We're all basically scum, the way we treat each other. As far as children acting like scum, look to the parents. Something isn't right in their households, behind closed doors. Children are highly impressionable, they copy what they see. It's how they learn. I don't buy the argument that it's the school teachers. Teachers do their thing in public, where there are many eyes watching them. RIP Bethany Thompson.
6 | William Casterline | 534 | 10155537888561509_10155537910651509 | The children and parents should be held responsible :'(. The children should go to the funeral,  give a eulogy and tell the people there why they thought it was ok to bully her.
7 | Mayra Alvarado | 242 | 10155537888561509_10155537897901509 | Bullying is real!! And it needs to stop. Parents need to be educated about bullies and what to do when their child is a bully. This cant keep happening. May she Rest In Peace.
8 | Andrea Daines | 238 | 10155537888561509_10155537904551509 | Most of the time this is what a gun in the house is going to be used for. People think they're getting them for "protection" but they're just kidding themselves.
9 | Eduardo Lima | 165 | 10155537888561509_10155537901101509 | A beautiful child, taken away from her parents by cruel, despicable kids. Honestly, I don't know if I could go on if it happened to one of my kids.
10 | Glorianne Joy Sandberg Katz | 100 | 10155537888561509_10155537927576509 | I never read about any consequences for bullies. Most of the time the school just like in this instance say they'll investigate. This precious little girl is not the only child to take their own life over bullying. What is wrong with people? I'm so ashamed that people in this country feel that it's perfectly ok to bully. I feel that this is learned at home as noone is born to hate. R,I.P. you're an angel now, watching over all the children that are being bullied.
11 | Tanya Copeland | 100 | 10155537888561509_10155537936406509 | I don't know what the laws are like down there, but up here in Canada, they are making the parents responsible and laying charges. It all starts at home. It's a known fact. So get to the root of the problem. If you fix the parents, chances are you can fix your bully
12 | Hannah Matt | 80 | 10155537888561509_10155537934476509 | I hope the parents of the children who bullied this little girl never get a good nights sleep again knowing they have raised disgusting little monsters.
13 | Heather Annastasia Mac Namara | 47 | 10155537888561509_10155537986866509 | I told my boys what I wished someone had told me when I was a kid: don't be a victim, don't expect adults to be able to solve the problem for you, stand up for yourself. If that means a fight, so be it. You don't have to win the fight, you just have to be willing to fight. Bullies go after easy targets.People have always said that I shouldn't encourage my kids to fight, but you know what? My kids never had a bully problem for long, and no, they never bullied other kids. As a matter of fact, they had a reputation for sticking up for kids who couldn't stick up for themselves. Teach your kids to stand up for themselves, and teach them that it's NOT OK to stand by while someone else gets picked on. And most of all: bullies are kids too! They're lashing out at easy targets because, in their kid logic, it seems like that's what they should be doing to gain social acceptance. When their peers don't tolerate their behavior, they learn that bullying is NOT OK, and they stop (adults can tell them a million times that bullying is wrong, but if their peers give them an audience,that's all that matters).
14 | Chele Lewis | 42 | 10155537888561509_10155537909586509 | Sad news. I truly wish things like this didn't happen. Bullying is absolutely horrible, but for some reason many of us survived 30 years ago, I think social media has really changed all aspects of bullying.
15 | Lauren Spencer | 67 | 10155537888561509_10155538003401509 | The community is rallying around the family now that the child is gone when they should have been rallying around her while she was alive to stop this. 😡 makes me so angry when adults don't take bullying seriously!
16 | Susan Britt | 30 | 10155537888561509_10155537913686509 | Until the schools take a more active and meaningful role in stopping bullying these tragedies will continue. The law has to change as well. There should be harsh punishments for repeat offenders, for do nothing parents and for teachers who won't get involved.
17 | Michelle Kim | 42 | 10155537888561509_10155537984806509 | I was 29 when I had brain tumor removed and surgery left my left side of face paralyzed. I have a crooked smile just like her, and it was REALLY REALLY hard for me even though people at my age didn't bully me. I can't imagine what this girl might have gone through. My heart breaks for this girl. 😢
18 | Sarah Scarvelli | 30 | 10155537888561509_10155537933076509 | Wow parents should've taught their kids to admire this girl love this girl look up to this girl and be kind to this girl because she was stronger than they were she was a warrior. I cannot believe this what a tragedy.
19 | Kira Ehrnsberger | 28 | 10155537888561509_10155537999771509 | Where are the people that are normally screaming for kids to "toughen up" when there's a bullying article? Well, that doesn't do crap. Tell the adults and you're a tattletale and get the "kids being kids" line. Fight the bully back and YOU'RE the jerk (according to the school). Then there's situations where the kid has no idea of how to get out the situation and ending it is the only way out.The "toughen up" mentality was designed by the bully's accomplices, either directly or indirectly. If you know what's going on and don't do anything about it, you're an accomplice.Schools NEED to do more about bullying. Stop with the same routine of having anti-bully speaker come in, make people cry and "bond" for a day, and then forget about it. Every school I've been in has done that and it fails to do much in the long run. Actually enforce it, not just for the day, the week, or whatever. Enforce it every minute that school is open for students.That "bully free day" and the "toughen up" mentality go hand in hand and let children suffer. Teachers and administrators need to stop turning a blind eye to this activity.When I look at that beautiful girl, I think to myself "that could have been me". I think it's about time for this crap to end for real.
20 | Brett Walkup | 27 | 10155537888561509_10155537944401509 | The punishment for bullying needs to be increased tenfold!!!! It's ridiculous this precious girl lost hope and the school administrators didn't intervene enough!!!
21 | Tomas Westin | 31 | 10155537888561509_10155537910571509 | Kids are freaking nasty these days. Honestly if I was a parent and found out my kid or even witnessed another kid that was getting ridiculed like that I'd probably end up choke slamming a few kids (bullies)...Poor girl. R.I.P
22 | Jessica Weldele-Handt | 16 | 10155537888561509_1344848208882289 | My daughter died of a brain tumor at age 2. Bullying the sick is about as low as it gets. This poor girl fought cancer but ended up killing herself. I don't know if I'm more sad or angered. Please teach your children to be kind to others.
23 | Kari Lyn | 25 | 10155537888561509_10155537931926509 | Teachers NEED to be trained on how to handle these bullies. As someone who was bullied, I know how little they actually do. My grades suffered, I skipped school, I even had teacher witness instances of verbal abuse and nobody ever got more than a stern look or having their name said in a disapproving tone. Something in these situations needs to change. We need to do more for these children.
24 | Angie Roessler | 19 | 10155537888561509_10155537980096509 | I'm 36 and have been dealing with people bullying me about my crooked smile for as long as I can remember. I've had a form of bell's palsy since I was a baby. The bullying never really goes away but it does get better over time. She should have been being celebrated for surviving cancer, not terrorized for it. My heart goes out to her family and friends. I hope they can find a way to deal with this senseless tragedy. :'(
25 | Jenn Henry | 11 | 10155537888561509_10155537978811509 | The principal and superintendent need to be held accountable. From my understanding this wasn't the first time bullying had been brought to their attention.

"Thank you Huma, thank you Huma. Good job, Huma. Thank you, Anthony Weiner." Donald J. Trump thanked Hillary Clinton's top aide Huma Abedin, after the FBI discovered new emails that could potentially be related to Clinton's private email server. Abedin's estranged husband is disgraced former Congressman Anthony Weiner who is under investigation. http://cnn.it/2eNPMSf

7 | Melanie Hodgson | 158 | 10155537779931509_10155537793886509 | Yes because it's smart to be thanking people who he believes are corrupt. Trump is a moron and if the USA elects him, they deserve him.
8 | Sean Jackson | 110 | 10155537779931509_10155537835846509 | Thanks Mr Trump for your inspiration before you became a lying and or misleading politician . I'm going to vote democrat all the way. You have said on the apprentice that sometimes you have to go back on history. And said on national news show historically the economy runs better under democrats. Plenty of data to back that up with little exception. Economy is most important to me because at end of the day have to have a good economy. Or nothing else can get done efficiently.

I voted for Bush, oh wait, no I didn't. Comey is scum, now he's walks on water. The election and the polls are rigged, now he agrees with them.

20 | Florence Ozoh Okechukwu | 16 | 10155537779931509_10155537838416509 | Has anyone heard about Trump's emails and their contents? Or maybe he just doesn't communicate thru emails. One sided email leaks hummmmm. Makes one wonder if there is a Trump - wikileaks alliance, then Russia. Put on your thinking hats people!
21 | Wendy Godding | 31 | 10155537779931509_10155537850711509 | As an Australian watching the US election I'm actually starting to worry that Trump might actually get in. Surely Americans wouldn't really do that? He is unhinged, egotistical, narcissistic, simpleminded.......

24 | William Reilly | 18 | 10155537779931509_10155537805826509 | Funny how They're investigating Anthony Weiner and his poor ex-wife and Hillary have nothing to do with these emails they're looking for something kind of along the lines of what Donald trumps on trial for in December raping a little girl Anthony Weiner is being investigated for texting a little girl funny how will try and put Hillary Clinton on the line for what Anthony Weiner and Donald Trump have in common sexual deviancy!
25 | Nikki Riegler | 22 | 10155537779931509_10155537838231509 | Thank YOU  Donald, for screwing yourself so bad with all of your hate, lies, fraud, sexual assault , mocking disabled people , that you will NEVER make it in the White House.

18 | Jon Tyson Weems | 5 | 10155537642181509_10155537741356509 | SHARE IT:  Cornell Law Library. Word for word from the Cornell Law Library Former United States Attorney General Michael Mukasey tells MSNBC that not only is Hillary Clinton's private email server illegal, it "disqualifies" her from holding any federal office. Very specifically points to one federal law, Title 18. Section 2071.For those of us who do not have United States Code committed to memory, here's what it says:“(a) Whoever willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys, or attempts to do so, or, with intent to do so takes and carries away any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both. (b) Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States. As used in this subsection, the term “office” does not include the office held by any person as a retired officer of the Armed Forces of the United States.”Yes, it explicitly states "shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States.Shouldn't voters know that? The media won't tell them. So it's up to us.
19 | Lora Grigonis | 0 | 10155537642181509_10155537783566509 | Huh? New York doesn't even have early voting. You can only vote absentee if you qualify based on disability, travel, work, or a few other reasons you might not be able to get to your designated polling place on election day.
20 | George Adams | 3 | 10155537642181509_10155538152631509 | STOP Election Fraud: Do NOT use Soros voting machines. Please vote to put Billery/Killery on trial for TREASON. She broke the law and belongs in jail. She risked our country and put our people in harm's way, and had Democratic whistleblowers murdered. Not only Billery is very dangerous, she will bring this country to a security collapse with cutting our military and a financial collapse by choosing a fight with Russia and ruining small businesses while sending all jobs overseas. Please don't vote for the DEVIL. This country needs to be free and strong, where people have a real chance at the American Dream. Billery should have never been the Democratic candidate to start with and stole the nomination from Bernie Sanders. She is the most corrupt candidate ever and works for the elite new world order who wants to make people obsolete with new robotic technology. She brings with her sinister powers and so do not be fooled by her fake smiles and phony consideration for the working man, or woman. Vote Donald Trump and save our nation. CNN until now has been reporting lies and gossip that was never admissible in court about Donald Trump. But tonight CNN, the yellow tabloid, must for a change act like a real news network and report the truth. Pray to God and pray hard that Donald Trump is our next President. We need to stop criminal refugees from coming here and take care first of our American veterans. We need to work on better trade deals so manufacturing will be back in America. We need to stop paying for parasites! The election is at stake with Billery's dirty tricks and it must be watched closely. Donald Trump is our only hope before Killery turns this country to a worse version of 1984 by George Orwell. I hope the next thing Trump do as our new much admired President is expose all the dirt, every affair and sexual indecency of every CNN reporter, including Anderson, Gloria, and that self righteous long brown haired woman. Then, HC must be locked up for the rest of her life. If you don't want more zombies on the streets, if you don't want to give up cash, and guns and freedom of speech, VOTE for TRUMP!!! We can't afford the status quo! We're losing our country!!! Dare, you pathetic paid patsies online of HC to call me names and I will take screen shots and sue you for libel!!! This nation is SICK of the Clinton cover ups. Stop totalitarianism! CNN=Clinton News Network. Hope Trump fires many of you when he is elected! Let us pray November 8 brings the change that we so desperately need. Long Live Trump, our savior!I am:1) A married WOMAN2) Have no kids3) Intelligent and educated4) Independent politically5) Trump Supporter, Truth Supporter, Freedom Supporter and a Proud American 6) Not a racist, respectful of ALL religions and races 7) Very worried about how globalism will annihilate our country as we know itWe all know main stream media and the system are rigged. We must never take our freedom for granted. On November 8 stand the lines as long as they are because our liberty and justice for all are at stake. Let us pray Billery/Killery will be arrested soon, AMEN. Please share and God Bless. P.S. For crying outloud, stop briefing the enemy Billery if you want to keep the U.S. safe!Hellery/Liary needs to have her clearance removed. Clean the swamp America! Huma is most likely a spy and Loretta Lynch, Justice Department director is as vicious as Killery, pleeding the Fifth when Congress asked her about why so many millions of dollars "disappeared" and ended in Iran! We MUST put a stop to the traitors and tried them all for TREASON.
21 | Rob Francis | 2 | 10155537642181509_10155537757941509 | I thought the US had secret ballots? How is it possible to change your vote unless there was a way that you could prove how you voted the first time? I know here in Canada your identity is not linked to your vote so there is no legal way to change your vote once it is cast.
22 | Lonnie Moser Myers | 2 | 10155537642181509_10155537683946509 | I'm all for some one wanting to convert to being deplorable, but your vote is in. Don't screw with the ballots more then they will be.
23 | Tracy Beck | 0 | 10155537642181509_10155537905871509 | Oh wow, so this gives people the opportunity to vote multiple times. So, say I already voted, and the media has found a way to "change my mind", I can go in, say I've had a change of heart and vote again. But, what if I really didn't have a change of heart, will my candidate then have 2 votes from me? Or, what if the media touches my heart again, could I vote a third time? If you voted early, you should have to live with your vote.
24 | Jon Zeidler | 0 | 10155537642181509_10155539077531509 | There are only two reasons why someone would vote for Hillary Clinton.1. They are ignorant and uneducated about who she is.2. They are traitors to this country.Those are your only two choices if you want to vote for her. Are you ignorant or are you a traitor?
25 | Jamye Rico | 0 | 10155537642181509_10155538099446509 | That's ridiculous. Yes, let's encourage people to not make decisions and stick to them or better yet to flippantly change their minds back and forth. That's so irresponsible and does not hold others accountable.

Many will balk at this, but I truly believe that President Obama may have been such a man, but with racial prejudice and an obstructionist Congress, he never achieved his full potential.

Several world leaders thought very highly of you. Nothing is perfect but at least you tried to make things better even though we did not know all the details that went into making difficult decisions.👻

20 | Jeanette Engelhardt Nohawitz | 23 | 10155537468606509_628957217285198 | Obama was good at dancing and taking expensive vacations, too bad he couldn't do anything to improve the Twenty Trillion Dollars of Debt, the Economy, ISIS, Terrorism, the War on Police, and the other important things in our country
21 | Bradford James Putt | 20 | 10155537468606509_628981267282793 | Fellow Americans, this is a fun event! My goodness, aren't we sick enough of this shaming and embarrassing campaign by lowering ourselves further with hating on a Halloween event!! & maybe some people should get off Facebook long enough to actually read posted articles & do productive research on the good President Obama has done in 8 years. Try and inherit the Republican & "privileged white men" mess Mr. Obama did & then do a better job! ... 😫
22 | Jonathan Murphy | 15 | 10155537468606509_984145841715074 | Make no mistake, Michelle Obama will be President in four or eight years time :) The Obama's will be back :D Just a pity Vice President Biden didn't make an appearance. I think most people just love Biden.
23 | Veronica Villalobos | 15 | 10155537468606509_984150215047970 | The worst president this country has ever seen!! He used plenty of executive orders to do bad things.  So, don't say he was stopped by republicans. Democrats and republicans suck! Go Trump ❤️🇺🇸
24 | Claudia McCain | 10 | 10155537468606509_984204668375858 | We will never see this again anytime soon. Not ashame to be a real man dad or President. What a team these two or shall I say 5 including grandma. Class real class. Although they will never give credit where it's  do. Hurts to bad for them to fist up. Wondeful man.
25 | Linda Lange | 18 | 10155537468606509_628954430618810 | I will truly miss the Obamas!! Just imagine what he could have achieved if he didn't have the republicans obstructing everything!!

We're at the The White House on Halloween, where the Obamas are handing out candy. Trick or treat!

1 | Jamey Trembléy | 1528 | 10155537445006509_10155537469166509 | If you guys can't say something nice why say anything at all? Who cares what you think about the Obamas right now. Be happy for these kids and shut up.
2 | Judy Dinkidi | 731 | 10155537445006509_10155537469831509 | Watching from Australia. Disappointed to see so many Americans filled with hatred

4 | Marcus Dillard | 475 | 10155537445006509_1336349299711060 | People are going to miss Pres. Obama and Michelle after the election since no matter who wins both candidates are one of the most untrustworthy in the history of presidential elections

10 | Lloyd Hayes | 89 | 10155537445006509_665595166941044 | When it comes to our Presidents, I can't think of a President and his family in recent history who identified more with the average family then this one.
11 | Daniel K Crockett | 102 | 10155537445006509_1239706376089825 | Quit hating on the best President in history or skip by this awesome event for kids. Awesome!!!!

14 | Jeff A. Johnson | 64 | 10155537445006509_665599830273911 | wow - such miserable people leaving such narrow-minded comments on here. Left or right, black or white - just for 5 minutes, enjoy the occasion, and see how much joy these kids and parents are having

16 | Ebony Rutherford Johnson | 52 | 10155537445006509_920546648081308 | So many hateful comments but guess what? not one of them over all these years has taken anything from this president. He and his family ignored your hate as if you don't exist.😊 untouchable
17 | Jerusalem Benavides | 46 | 10155537445006509_862736513863219 | Can't believe you're complaining that our leader is giving children candy for Halloween. There are children benefiting from him right now and your complaining
18 | Alfonso Lopez-Vasquez | 79 | 10155537445006509_1333783150016513 | Never ceases to amaze me how the nay sayers and president Obama haters are such poor spellers. An indication of their cognitive functionality? This is a rhetorical question.
19 | Bob Powell | 47 | 10155537445006509_668856169943886 | These two and their children have set the bar so high as to how a first family should be that I doubt it will ever be topped.
20 | Diana Mac | 44 | 10155537445006509_1336364729709517 | For crying out loud, people. It's a Halloween celebration. Can the hateful comments stop for one freaking minute and let people just enjoy the moment!?
21 | Janine Riddle | 48 | 10155537445006509_1118896734845992 | People with these negative attitudes need to just get off this page if they're not happy with the Obamas....nothing wrong with celebrating children & fun!
22 | Dawn Sampson | 46 | 10155537445006509_1668329653457334 | Jeez you americans really need to lose the hate. This is about the kids not politics. Save it for another time if you need to vent.  Good for them I say.
23 | Rick Simmons | 38 | 10155537445006509_1770580139858259 | Well, this is the last time in a long that we are going to have a young, energetic couple occupying the White House.  We should celebrate their enthusiasm.

25 | Mike Remus | 88 | 10155537445006509_1239705752756554 | Maybe instead of candy they should pass out free health care.

"There is no case here." Hillary Clinton reassures supporters amid new email probe
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Stephen Más | 2726 | 10155537250266509_10155537383331509 | Remember when Trump was laughed at for saying Hillary had the questions ahead of time? Remember when he said Weiner had access to Hillary's classified emails? Remember when he said Hillary cheated Bernie out of the nomination BEFORE wikileaks confirmed it. Trumps been right about everything from the start.
2 | Adam Lasales | 1376 | 10155537250266509_10155537389806509 | She lied under oath, she cheated in the debates. She continues to lie and deceive her supporters while degrading her opposers. Now she blames the FBI for investigating her. And not to mention the twenty something questionable suicides and murders in her inner circle. Career Corrupted Politician. She should be in jail. And how any one can support her, is beyond us. Hillary for Prison 2016

7 | Lisbeth Castro | 166 | 10155537250266509_10155537386076509 | It was just a political move that went terribly wrong for them!  Don't get mad get even !! VOTE BLUE!! STRONGER TOGETHER!!!
8 | Holly Fehr | 123 | 10155537250266509_10155537416286509 | Of course she says this. What else would you expect her to say. She's pooping bricks right now, and Huma, hmmmm why isn't she traveling with good ol'Hil? Hil would love to make her disappear right about now, but, well, that would show just another sign of guilt. To think I voted for this woman 8 years ago.
9 | Ron Dowlen | 52 | 10155537250266509_10155537441326509 | I am SO sick of hearing about Hillary's emails and Benghazi that she should be in prison. How about the thousands of deaths under Bush... regarding Katrina, 9/11 , the fake Iraq war that we were lied to about, and the billions in profits made by Chaney's Halliburton and subsidiaries,the banking and housing market disaster and all the cover-ups by the Republicans in office? Missing documents, blacked out sentences and paragraphs,the millions of White House E-mails suddenly disappearing regarding the extreme mishandling of all the Bush Administration that almost destroyed this world then was mysteriously hushed up and was never to be discussed or talked about again. The Republicans won't ever talk about ANY of this. THEY are the ones that should all be in prison !
10 | Joshua Braska | 35 | 10155537250266509_10155537436846509 | Republicans would be doing a lot better in this election cycle if they came up with better ideas instead of trying to find new ways to put their opponents down. When you can't run on good ideas, this is what you get.
11 | Daniel Sykes | 42 | 10155537250266509_1229066887167050 | For everyone still voting Hillary Clinton you should be ashamed of yourselves because she has lied to American people from Bengahzi to these emails all she's gonna do is put blame on someone else and get away with it she is a disgrace to American Race.
12 | Michael Proia | 72 | 10155537250266509_10155537402491509 | When I see her say "there is no case here" it reminds me of exactly how bill acted when he said "I did not have sexual relations with that woman"
13 | Mary McCarson | 52 | 10155537250266509_10155537411636509 | Really Hillary?

18 | Jill Bucholtz | 13 | 10155537250266509_1611036002530886 | I'm with you Hillary !! Let's put Trump in jail where he belongs and get rid of these obstructionists republicans. Vote blue across the board!!

20 | Rockie Springer | 13 | 10155537250266509_1611036145864205 | Does the Clinton News Network pay for the comments directly, or does the Clinton campaign or Clinton Foundations pay for them all?? No one in their right mind would ever believe a word the Clinton News Network, proven liars, proven state controlled media, has to say. Number one rule to avoid all of the fake news. Never ever listen to or watch the Clinton News Network.
21 | Adrian Likus | 10 | 10155537250266509_532515420278575 | You know what I noticed, and is disgraceful? All of Hillary's cohorts wear a Hillary lapel pin, not an American Flag pin such as is customary and respectable. These idiots swear their allegiance to Hillary, not America.
22 | Gilbert House | 5 | 10155537250266509_532516000278517 | I'm still with her. Trump will shatter and ruin All the ground we have gain as a country in the last 100 years. All people are created equal. God bless Hillary Clinton our next president.
23 | Gregg Wartgow | 9 | 10155537250266509_10155537411756509 | This woman is delusional. You think the FBI would do this at this juncture, when this story was, for all intents and purposes. put to rest? The Weiner agents must have saw something very alarming already. Seems obvious.
24 | Henry Rios | 8 | 10155537250266509_644141135760315 | There's no doubt that Trump and Republicans have felt the pressure of losing the race to the presidency. There's also no doubt that the GOP pressured Comey into making a statement without a pinch of evidence in order to cast doubt to undecided voters. Too many young voters out there that don't know how Al Gore was ripped off from winning the presidency; and here we go again! It doesn't matter that the FBI has no concrete proof of any wrongdoing? I am sickened by how the GOP will play filthy dirty politics to win at any cost. Democrats need to grow a pair and play dirty too!!! If Trump can cast accusations without proof then let's do the same. Since he is unwilling to show his taxes, then that must mean he is a crook. Since there are so many women claiming sexual assault and misconduct, then he must be a sexual predator. His racist, sexist, divisive comments, and the fact that he does not offer substantial or proven policies--that he'll offer real plans AFTER he becomes president is absolutely OUTRAGEOUS! The email scandal is the only thing the GOP and Trump have left. Let's see...emails vs. sexual assault and misconduct, criminal business deals, and the fact that he has absolutely NO EXPERIENCE to ensure that he can do the job as president. Trump supporters will say that it doesn't matter that he doesn't have the knowledge and experience, as he will hire people to run the country for him. OH HELL NO! Hillary supporters must stand their ground and vote for Hillary 2016! Please get out there and VOTE!
25 | Paulson Uba | 8 | 10155537250266509_1229042667169472 | CNN God of justice has come to rescue america true Trump.they hate him bcus he is not economical with truth,they abandoned and attack him even his own party bcus he couldnt be bought over.his coming has unveiled the massive corruption and rigging in american system.God brought him for a reason.Trump go and maken Ameeica great again.I love you from nigeria here.

The Winchester Mystery House is one of the most haunted places in America. Folks have experienced everything there from hearing eerie footsteps to seeing full physical manifestations of those passed. So, naturally, Great Big Story went to investigate.

1 | Joshua Baker | 112 | 10155536465241509_10155537336086509 | Hey CNN when are you going to report Donna Brazile was suspended and resigned for leaking debate questions to Hillary? Huh? I guess you wouldn't report that on the Clinton Network lol
2 | Tiffany Prince | 42 | 10155536465241509_10155537382586509 | For eff's sake. Can't we all just take a break from political talk every once in a while?!.....thank you CNN for sharing something that is NOT related to politics.
3 | Jayesh Patel | 1 | 10155536465241509_10155537424621509 | CNN , who gave the information to Donna Brazile and why? , there is no investigation on that and CNN is still bios on trump, by puting Michael Moore today to talk for hilary but not ask tough questions about Hilary and Donna Brazile story.
4 | Andreas Lohne | 8 | 10155536465241509_10155537374611509 | Wow, that is so interesting. And exactly the appropriate news story to publish while everyone else is focusing on Donna Brazile.But I guess that's not all that important. So what if she gave Clinton the questions in advance and perverted the political process ? It's not a huge story that demands a lot of coverage, right ? No big deal.You obviously have to make cuts in your coverage to make room for the hour long coverage of Trump forcefully kissing some women in the 1990s and the outrage towards comey for doing his job.
5 | Jayesh Patel | 0 | 10155536465241509_10155538161731509 | I just wanted to to let you know that Clintons are with Saudi Arabia to clear the Syria and rebuild the way they want so if any refugees wants to claim their land back it would be tough to do so. It is a biggest money and country laundering scheem. And their banks and investors will benifit from it.

11 | Rob Singer | 1 | 10155536465241509_10155537335591509 | Reparations owed for “Racial Terrorism” says UN Committeeby Phoebe Braithwaite (United Nations, )Monday, October 31, 2016Inter Press ServiceUNITED NATIONS, Oct 31 (IPS) - Stressing the enduring relationship between injuries inflicted by slavery and contemporary injustices, a UN committee has recently issued a strongly-worded call for reparations for black U.S. Americans."A systemic ideology of racism ensuring the domination of one group over another continues to impact negatively on the civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights of African Americans today," said the UN Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent, in a report released in August.So far this year 212 black people have been killed by police in the United States, according to statistics collected by The Guardian. This is almost a quarter of the total 883 people killed by police in 2016, despite the fact that only14.4 percent of US Americans are of African descent.While only 6.5% of the US population are African American men, they constitute 40.2% of prison populations, according to Ana DuVernay's recent film 13TH. While 1 in 17 white men can expect to go to prison in their lifetime, one in three black men can expect to be incarcerated.The group's report, which focuses especially on police brutality against black Americans as "reminiscent of the past racial terror of lynching," makes 35 diverse recommendations, from establishing sovereign human rights commissions to the reinstatement of voting rights of former felons.Yet critics question whether the liberal human rights paradigm can adequately address this kind of cruelty and oppression, originating as it does in 20th century Europe, where fascism had recently taken root, and in light of Europe's own role in creating and perpetuating racial injustice."In the era of the Atlantic slave trade," says Andrew Johnson, Professor of African American Studies at Harvard University, "new notions of difference – absolute, racial notions of difference – were used to define, describe, and justify the political economy of slavery, articulating the centrality of racism in capitalist exploitation."Demands for reparations have been largely ignored in the political mainstream. A bill, HR-40, introduced in 1989 to establish a commission examining the "fundamental injustice, cruelty" and brutality of slavery has gained little traction – though the UN committee recommends its passage through Congress. Last year, then-presidential candidate democratic socialist Bernie Sanders dismissed the question of reparations saying that it wouldn't get through Congress and would be "too divisive".Noting Sanders' determination to push the boat out on issues of class, celebrated writer and proponent of reparations Ta-Nehisi Coates deplored this lack of political imagination: "I thought Sanders's campaign might remind Americans that what is imminently doable and what is morally correct are not always the same things, and while actualising the former we can't lose sight of the latter," Coatessaid.He urged that class-based solutions are inappropriate to address "racial plunder" – borne out by the fact that the median income for African American households ($36,898) is almost half their white counterparts ($62,950). The median net worth of black families, $4,900, versus white families, $97,000, reveals an even starker difference.Movement for Black LivesThe Movement for Black Lives, a coalition of over 50 black-led organisations, has set out five key requests which would begin to restore what has been being stolen "since the time that the first black person was kidnapped from the shores of Africa," in the words of Black Panther Angela Davis.They focus especially on education, a particular site of harm since it was made illegal to teach enslaved people to read, a law which began in South Carolina in 1740 and was punishable by death in Louisiana. Since then, owing to redlining policies and explicit disinvestment in primarily-black schools, African Americans have continued to suffer from worse educational opportunities, with black students expelled at three times the rate of white students."You're more likely to walk into your hallway and interact with a police officer – in a school – than a guidance counselor," Kesi Foster, Coordinator at the Urban Youth Collaborative, and contributor to the policy recommendations for the Movement for Black Lives' demand for reparations, told IPS, saying that in New York, there is one guidance counselor for every 322 students, but a police officer for every 192 students.These officers are more prevalent in schools with metal detectors, which are usually primarily non-white. Describing what is often called the ‘school-to-prison pipeline', Foster says that reparative justice could begin by defunding the COPS programme which stations police in schools in line with the perception that black and brown males are "inherently dangerous".ReparationsAfter the end of the American Civil War in 1865, people who were formerly enslaved were given forty acres of tillable land – and, sometimes a mule. But after Abraham Lincoln's assassination the same year, his successor Andrew Johnson reversed Lincoln's directive for redistribution.Calls for reparations have a long history proceeding from this date, and have tended to focus on material restitution, which makes the Movement for Black Lives' emphasis on education salient. "Not only is there no curriculum recognition about the real history of our country… but there's also no cultural recognition," Foster says. "In Germany and other places... where really atrocious things have taken place, there are markers."They call for "mandated public school curriculums that critically examine the political, economic, and social impacts of colonialism and slavery, and funding to support, build, preserve, and restore cultural assets and sacred sites to ensure the recognition and honoring of our collective struggles and triumphs."It is clear that fulsome reparations for the continued atrocities perpetrated against people of African descent are not about to be freely given simply because whites are made to see the error of their ways. In the words of Mariame Kaba, organiser, educator and founder of Project NIA, speaking at a recent conference on the disproportionate effect the war on drugs has had on black communities, "the system can't indict itself. You can't think that the system that is killing you is going to save you."Kaba, who helped in the fight for plaintiffs' justice in the Burge torture trials, discussed the extensive public apology that was eventually won by some of those Burge tortured, and the history's inclusion in Chicago's curriculums, demonstrating the essential role honest expressions of responsibility can play in processes of healing for black communities who have been brutalised by the state.But the Movement's foremost demand is for the "full and free access for all Black people (including undocumented and currently and formerly incarcerated people) to lifetime education" in its every form, including the "retroactive forgiveness of student loans".Professor Harold McDougall, who teaches law at Howard University, has, among many others, argued for the necessity of black-only education. McDougall would like to see Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), like Howard, funded to set up "Reparations Academies" for the descendents of people who were "damaged by educational racism". This is a practical measure as much as it compounds Stokely Carmichael and Charles Hamilton's view that "group solidarity is necessary before a group can operate effectively from a bargaining position of strength".

Lots of people are voting early.  The rest were older folks some carrying Bibles and then young women.  I guess this is going to be an election for the record books.  Then I get home and find out CNN fired Donna Brazil, the DNC Chairwoman for issues relating to Hillary's campaign during the debates and such.
5 | Shanish Ujoodha | 146 | 10155537192861509_10155537194716509 | See this what happens when people disobey Clinton. She ordered everyone to destroy their electronics with a hammer. She said no evidence, no crime.
6 | Tom Whiting | 72 | 10155537192861509_10155537223996509 | The problem was created by Hillary and her camp. Additionally, this was manipulated by Lynch.Understandably, the ever flopping liberal party wants to blame Comey (whom they praised for the decision earlier in the year), but it's really not his fault. He's just the messenger.
7 | Carlos Artiaga | 48 | 10155537192861509_10155537203071509 | Cornell Law Library. Word for word from the Cornell Law Library Former United States Attorney General Michael Mukasey tells MSNBC that not only is Hillary Clinton's private email server illegal, it "disqualifies" her from holding any federal office. Very specifically points to one federal law, Title 18. Section 2071.For those of us who do not have United States Code committed to memory, here's what it says:“(a) Whoever willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys, or attempts to do so, or, with intent to do so takes and carries away any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both. (b) Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States. As used in this subsection, the term “office” does not include the office held by any person as a retired officer of the Armed Forces of the United States.”Yes, it explicitly states "shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States.Shouldn't voters know that?
8 | Louie Gallo | 60 | 10155537192861509_10155537243491509 | I can only imagine if Weiner was a Republican who was married to Trumps top adviser. He would be on a 24/7 news loop about his sexually deviant behavior. Both Hillary and Huma are married to perverted sexual predators. Why hasn't any one at CNN ever pressed Hillary on Weiner? Because it would crush her chances at getting elected that's why. CNN once again proving their bias and hypocrisy
9 | Nancy Long | 23 | 10155537192861509_10155537207321509 | Neither Comey nor the FBI had the opportunity to review these emails before making the decision not to charge Hillary Clinton. Discovering them now, so close to the election, has caused a political maelstrom that may pose a problem for Hillary Clinton's apparently smooth ride to victory in the last days of this campaign. But this problem wasn't created by Comey. The FBI found new information that's potentially relevant to the investigation we all thought was over. Now someone has to deal with this information, and that job belongs to James Comey.
10 | Djenane Freibott | 27 | 10155537192861509_10155537220566509 | This is all Hillary's fault. She had the server she wasn't supposed to have. If Wiener guy has her e-mails, God knows else has them. And they want to blame on Russia, Trump, on Comey???
11 | Erin Capuano | 13 | 10155537192861509_10155537287036509 | Severs ties with Donna Brazile but seems totally ethically fine with employing Corey Lewandowski as a contributor who is still on Trump's payroll. CNN trying to be ethical is laughable.
12 | Becky Cabrera | 14 | 10155537192861509_10155537229801509 | Hillary has to stay in the race. The minute she's no longer a political force, any high-level protections that she and the Clinton Foundation have been enjoying will evaporate. She's running not just for President, but for self-preservation.  In case you do not understand how the Clinton foundation works, here's shady the set up.  The Clinton Foundation is "organized crime" at it's finest, and we are financing it.  It may eventually prove to be the largest political criminal money laundering enterprise in U.S. history. This is a textbook case on how to hide foreign money sent to you and re-package it, to be used for your own purposes. All tax free.  Here's how it works: 1. You create a separate foreign "charity."  In their case one in Canada. 2. Foreign wealthy rulers and governments, then donate to this Canadian charity.  In this case, over 1,000 contributed mega millions.  I am sure they did this out of the goodness of their hearts, and expected nothing in return.3.The Canadian charity then bundles these separate unidentified individual donations & makes a massive donation to the Clinton Foundation.  4. The Clinton Foundation, and the cooperating Canadian charity claim Canadian law prohibits, the identification of individual donors. 5. The Clinton Foundation, then "spends" some of this money, for legitimate good works programs.  Un-fortunately, experts believe this is on the order of a mere 10%.  Much of the balance goes to enrich the Clinton's,  pay "salaries" to un-told numbers of hangers on, fund lavish travel, etc.  Again virtually all tax free, which means you & I are subsidizing it. 6. The Clinton Foundation with access to the world's best accountants, somehow fails to report much of this on their tax filings.  They discover these "clerical errors" and Hillary has to begin the process of re-filing 5 years of tax returns. 7. Net result: foreign money, much of it from other countries, goes into the Clinton's pockets tax free & untraceable back to the original donor. This is the textbook definition of money laundering.  Oh, by the way, the Canadian "charity" includes, as a principal one Frank Giustra.  Google him.  He is the guy who was central to the formation of Uranium One, the Canadian company that somehow acquired massive U.S. uranium interests and then sold them to an organization controlled by Russia.  This transaction required U.S. State Department approval.  Guess who was Secretary of State, when the approval, was granted?  As an aside, imagine how former, Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell feels.  That poor schlep, is in jail because he and his wife took $165,000 in gifts and loans for doing minor favors for a guy promoting a vitamin company. Not legal, but it didn't exactly put U.S. security at risk.  Sarcasm aside, if you are still not persuaded, this was cleverly structured in order to get unidentified foreign money to the Clinton's.  Ask yourself this: Why did these foreign interests, funnel money, through a Canadian charity?  Why not donate directly to the Clinton Foundation? Better yet, why not donate money directly to the people, organizations & countries in need?  This is the essence of money laundering and influence peddling.  Now you know why Hillary's destruction of 30,000 e-mails was a risk she was willing to take.  Bill and Hillary are devious, unprincipled, dishonest, and criminal.  They are Slick!Remember, most people are not well informed. But to convict a defendant under RICO, the government must prove that the defendant engaged in two or more instances of racketeering activity and that the defendant directly invested in, maintained an interest in, or participated in a criminal enterprise affecting interstate or foreign commerce. The law has been used to prosecute members of the mafia, the Hells Angels motorcycle gang, and Operation Rescue, an anti-abortion group, among many others.

You watch children die, countries go to war, murder and rape and you point your camera at it and say this is all the news there is. You are behind the most corrupt person to ever run for president and you should all be locked away for a thousand years. You do nothing but poison the minds of the innocent and gullible and spread your lies like disease. You do nothing but spread hate to those who need it the most and you offer only twisted, contorted, flimsy specs of truth about almost anything.

21 | Walt Sherwood | 15 | 10155537192861509_10155537208046509 | This email investigation is the tip of the iceberg. The Wikileaks release a few days ago showed the selling of political favors for personal enrichment via donations. This is the substance of the emails, aside from classified info. Judicial Watch is already telling the House that have plans to IMPEACH her, if elected (and the whole administration knew and covered it up). Wikileaks has promised more this week. Comey was told to let it go & his staff was pissed but Wikileaks has now pushed his hand (he does not want to be complicit when it all comes out anyway). If she is elected, we will have an international disgrace worse than anything Trump cam say, which even MSNBC is coming down on her now. The Chicago Tribune just said she should step down. They just released audio of her suggesting rigging the Palestine election in 2006 (nothing is beneath her).
22 | Paul Wagner | 12 | 10155537192861509_10155537232226509 | The FBI sat on these emails for four weeks. A warrant could have been issued within 24 hours and we would probably already have an outcome.So yeah, Comey deserves some criticism, for not doing his job at the first opportunity.I'll vote for Hillary out of spite at this point....
23 | Seane Sca Raiztlin | 11 | 10155537192861509_10155537308141509 | The only supporters she hase left are insane women and feminists who dont care about her crimes, the only one thing they care about is getting a woman president, the truth and facts of all her crimes don't matter to them she could go on live t.v. and sacrafice little kids as a tribute to satan for halloween and they would still vote for her.

12 | Michael Fisher | 15 | 10155537088646509_10155537116221509 | Isn't there more important things to be reporting CNN???? Your woman is done. Bye Felecia 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂. Trump wins by a landslide.
13 | Eva Antal | 10 | 10155537088646509_600217686826618 | I live 50 miles from the border. And, years ago, some of my former coworkers lived very close and heard many scary stories. Nighty illegals were crossing/jumping over their backyard/fence. Is you don't have a border, you don't have a country! Vote Smart! #NEVERKILLARY! #Trump2016
14 | Lisa Maria Nellis | 8 | 10155537088646509_10155537150921509 | Build s wall around trump extreme vetting use law and order if he doesn't comply send him back where he belongs until further notice trump brings hate bigotry and division into our country we need to secure our borders from him and people like him
15 | Sharon Hemmerich | 18 | 10155537088646509_10155537154406509 | And another one going down with Hillary. CNN had to fire Brazile. Huma lawyered up & Weiner is singing for a deal. Dems are running away & commentators are denouncing her. Obama's cancelled events for her. And it's just the beginning
16 | Matthew Rull | 19 | 10155537088646509_10155537112956509 | HEADLINE CORRECTION:  We at CNN are so in the tank for Hillary that we approve of people entering and staying in the United States ILLEGALLY and forcing law-abiding Americans to subsidize them.
17 | David Gao | 5 | 10155537088646509_10155537194801509 | CNN is the REAL OSCAR AWARD WINNER. Don't try to avoid the question by posting news about trump. The whole world knows you guys leaked town hall questions to the Killary
18 | Carlos Rodriguez | 5 | 10155537088646509_10155537201416509 | I think the level of corruption reached in our government is UNPRECEDENTED, and, to a certain extent, unparalleled.  The amount of money, the briberies, the shady deals, the selling off of national security secrets to the highest bidder, the murders, etc...it blows one's mind as to how it could have gotten so bad.  But then again, this is what you get in 8 long years of unchallenged power.
19 | Melissa Ware | 2 | 10155537088646509_10155537221361509 | This report was laughable- first of all, obviously engineering people would have to take a look at the landscape and what type of "wall" fits the terrain, materials etc. - I've never seen so many people who take every single word so literal in my life. Think outside the box!
20 | Anja Allison | 4 | 10155537088646509_1801388293484209 | Do those people really think that Trump will actually build a wall? And if that would ever happen, you know who pays for it? We, the middle class! Focus on real issues, like education, airport security, food safety, health care... but no, those uneducated folks want a wall, like the built after WW2, really???? They do not understand that if Trump wins, there will be huge recession, and most of us will loose our jobs, cause all that Trump is concerned about it filling his own pockets, and those of his rich friends... and he decided to run as a Republican, cause he knows that "they believe everything you tell them, no matter if it's true or not" (his own words a few years back).
21 | Olivia Pipski | 3 | 10155537088646509_10155537147196509 | Thank you CNN for providing continual, in-depth reporting on Donald Trump's upcoming fraud trial, upcoming child-rape trial, tax return controversy, and possible ties to Russia. America needs to know these things so they can make informed decisions! #JustKiddingThatWasn'tYouGuys
22 | Jeff Enochs | 3 | 10155537088646509_10155537184261509 | This article is a PRO for the Trump campaign and yet still, those trolls take offense and have to pivot the topic back to Clinton. Just shut up for once and enjoy that CNN gave Trump some good PR by showing a failing fence line.
23 | Marie Wellens | 3 | 10155537088646509_10155537241011509 | Little do these people know that there is a much bigger problem here. A very good Mexican friend of mine has his own business & is very intellegent. We were talking about Trump building the wall one day & he looked at me with a smile and said, sure, let Trump  a wall, this way no one will bother the ones digging the tunnels. What he was saying is that # 1 a wall isn't going to keep the  " bad Hombres " as Trump calls them, out. And #2, Mexico isn't going to pay for that wall. Maybe it's time for a better solution.
24 | Donna Marie Givens | 3 | 10155537088646509_10155537214671509 | A commentary on walls? DNC not only built a wall around it's convention center, it built a blue wall around the podium which it then changed to a clear wall because the blue wall became controversial. So I guess a policy of open borders applies to everyone except the party promoting the open borders? What was the purpose of the wall/fence at the convention? To keep people in?
25 | John Robinson | 2 | 10155537088646509_600220136826373 | Hillary is a sociopath and the sad thing is that no matter what she does she will still have the support of her Democratic voters. She could stand on the hood of a pickup truck filled with live babies and twist their necks one by one telling voters they were deplorable; tossing them into the crowd and they would still applaud her.

This is what it's like to be on the front lines in Mosul http://cnn.it/2f5X0zo
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Joseph Loreti Sr. | 183 | 10155536898696509_10155537019321509 | Regarding Donna....does CNN really believe this little gesture will make them a legitimate news organization again?  That ship has sailed, and it's not coming back.
2 | Marc Langsam | 90 | 10155536898696509_10155537001251509 | If I were a Bernie supporter, I'd be beyond enraged.Except he's the one who sloughed off the whole email thing when he had the PERFECT opportunity not to.If you were tired of hearing about her emails THEN, Bernie, how 'bout NOW?More proof of how Democrats seem to think that wishing makes it so, that the world revolves around their own sensibilities instead of, you know, reality.
3 | Robert Dlamini | 35 | 10155536898696509_10155537021396509 | So now you decide to run a news story CNN. Why haven't you run a story on your corrupt partner Donna Brazile giving questions to crooked Hillary before the debates!? - everyone at CNN you should be ashamed of yourselves
4 | Ellen M Shelby | 12 | 10155536898696509_10155537044301509 | Are you serious CNN? Your channel is a joke. You are not reporting on the FBI reopening case against criminal Hillary beecause loretta lynch and obama pressured them to let her off before and now with Weiner and #Wikileaks they can't hide it anymore. At CNN journalism is DEAD
5 | Pat Schmida | 4 | 10155536898696509_10155537037866509 | Yeah, let's put the Mosul confrontation on the top of the CNN page. Nothing about Hillary's email conundrum. Can't find anything here. Doesn't surprise me.
6 | Dennis Sirman | 3 | 10155536898696509_10155538163776509 | There would be no "front lines in Mosul" if our feckless president had intervened vs ISIS at the very beginning.  ISIS is Obama's problem, along with stronger North Korea, a destroyed Syria, lost Libya, Russian seizure of Crimea and eastern Ukraine, racial hatred in the USA and a host of other problems lying at the feet of a fraud.
7 | Debbie Kostoglakis | 15 | 10155536898696509_10155536986291509 | The problem is not Donald Trump groping every hot women in sight, the problem is Trump lying about not knowing and having seen any of those women before and suing them. A man like Trump isn't qualified to be called a human being, what makes you think he's qualified enough to represent USA?
8 | Jana Bobbitt | 5 | 10155536898696509_10155537025441509 | All about Trump and his donations, we have seen him personally truck loads going to LA and SC.... and you didn't say a thing about Clinton and her donating to herself!
9 | Hendrick Perry | 6 | 10155536898696509_10155537097951509 | Served with the Iraqi special forces last year. Stand up guys. Praying they do what  they have to do, and return home safely. War is hell, if you never been in it. You have no room to talk
10 | Susan Scrofani | 2 | 10155536898696509_10155537040146509 | If Oblunder and Crooked Killary didn't pull the troops out this debacle could have been prevented. Clinton News Network sucks
11 | Rayma Allaby | 0 | 10155536898696509_10155537082576509 | i find cnn hypocritical you kept the trump talking head lewendowsky knowing he was getting a pay check from trump and knowing he was on flights with trump after he was supposedly fired but you dump brazille based on a e-mail that may be altered just wow
12 | Jeff Miller | 3 | 10155536898696509_10155537025571509 | Quite the comedy show you losers have going at this point in the sell-out, and I remember when at one point, you were actually a network worth watching...Been quite a while, but at this point, game over for you tools really...You all actually think anyone will take you legitimately ever again, after this election, and your one-sided cheer leading?
13 | John Turner | 1 | 10155536898696509_10155537372066509 | Hey CNN when are you going to report Donna Brazile was suspended and resigned for leaking debate questions to Hillary? Huh? I guess you wouldn't report that on the Clinton Network...
14 | Ron Shields | 2 | 10155536898696509_10155537039766509 | Where has CNN been the last years when we were there ??? Little or no coverage....guess covering US military doesn't pay the bills,
15 | Rob Young | 1 | 10155536898696509_10155538441696509 | Whatever it takes to defeat Isis is fine with me. Regardless of how you think Isis came to be, they need to be destroyed. I hope the Iraqis and Kurds can take them out with US support.
16 | Brad Jackson | 2 | 10155536898696509_10155537082996509 | So CNN cheated to help Clinton....how can that be with as they say The Most Trusted Name in News??? I think it's more that you can  probably TRUST a lot more evidence will come out showing how disingenuous you really are. And you wonder why you're getting verbally booed around the country. Go figure.
17 | Bryan Adams | 1 | 10155536898696509_10155538223721509 | WTF is Wrong with American Citizen, All article comment section is About Trump and Clinton. I'm double checking the video and I'm quit sure this isnt about your election yet the comment section . . . . zzzz.Can't wait for November 8!
18 | Johnny King | 1 | 10155536898696509_10155537100761509 | Tom...eventhough ClintonNewsNetwork is corrupt, they still need to make $...and nobody wants to watch a lying criminal, named Hillary (except you)...
19 | Patti Jo Stevens | 1 | 10155536898696509_10155537433491509 | And all of the people living there who for years have been brutalized by ISIS, now the US does something just before an election...like we don't get that it was done NOW to favor Clinton....monstrous...
20 | Yvonne Gokul Edwards | 1 | 10155536898696509_10155537211301509 | I think the US should brinig their soldiers home, let the middle East deal with their own problems,iraq have plenty of wealth neighbours to help them solve the problems there.
21 | Kevin Miller | 2 | 10155536898696509_10155537046481509 | CNN, what about your (cough) journalist that attended Hillary's off the record dinner ? If they'll still employed CNN is not a legitimate news source.
22 | Frank Reno | 2 | 10155536898696509_10155537128636509 | The Clinton News Network needs to get their head out of their Culo & actually report the news. Hillary is over. Chew on that for a while.
23 | Marcus Bergfeldt | 0 | 10155536898696509_10155537187396509 | Are there any info on the amount of ex u.s military equipment iraq has bought from the u.s and how much they have paid for it must be a huge amount.
24 | Penny Van Amburg | 0 | 10155536898696509_10155537953481509 | I just read this article on someone else's newsfeed. It's a real eye opener to say the least!Let me explain a few things to people who don't understand how this will end. People call these Muslims refugees! BS... this is an army invading our country under the assumption they are refugees. This is the only way to invade America from the inside and people say why we are strong and yes America is a super power. Killary wants to bring in 500,000 more how many are already here?. People say they are nice people I live with them and work with them, that is a red herring. Once they have enough and that will be soon if Killary is elected president. And listen to this very closely because it's no joke. Once they have the numbers here it will begin, and remember Obumer is closing Guantanamo Bay and bringing the worst of the worst Muslim leaders here to America. Why would you say does it matter well I'm going to tell you. Once the numbers are here and your "Social Security is funding all this " then they will detonate EMP bombs around America where it will do the most damage to the grid. Now some people ask what is a EMP bomb. It will destroy anything that is electrical, ie cars ,planes, generators,cell phones you get my point now. How will that be bad people ask, so I will explain . America will return to the dark ages no power to stay warm or cook no ac to stay cool no way to ship food no way to keep meat good. No place to buy food no way to call for help so people ask why would I need to call for help. Well that's when these so called refugees will turn into an Army that will start the take over of America. They will go from town to towns state to state and they will kill you cut your head's off they will rape and pillage everything and everyone they have contact with. Christians will be killed without mercy. I'll fight you say I'll call the cops or the army someone. No you won't no way to call for help phones won't work and Killary has already taken our guns so your fight won't last long. ie. Don't bring a gun to a knife fight. But don't worry Killary will set up FEMA camps for your protection she will say but many will be killed in these camps. How will you feed your family with no food no stores no walmart. So many Americans will die from starvation in the first month alone it will be sick. And then you have people in your own town that will try to take what you have to feed their's. Race groups killing and pillaging anywhere they want. America will be lost forever meanwhile all those countries that hate America will attack because we will be like sitting ducks in a pond. So prepare the best you can because this is what you are voting for if you vote this traitor as president. Some of you idiot's will laugh but I assure you when it happens it will be no laughing matter when your young girls are raped in front of you and watch as your sons and husband's heads are cut off. And no one will be able to help you you won't be able to fight because Killary took our right as American citizens all so she can fill her pockets. Obumer is Muslim plant that has brainwashed Killary into destroying the country she says she loves. Trump is our only way out of this out come so be smart people think for yourselfs and let's make America the great country it was before this traitor took control. You need to ask yourselfs why would any United States president give 400 million dollars to country like Iran that is the biggest funder of terrorist Go Trump/Pence Drain those swamps  The peaces of the puzzle are coming together to show the whole picture.  PLEASE SHARE, PLEASE
25 | Kevin Griffin | 0 | 10155536898696509_10155537281406509 | I wonder what it feels like to be the world's largest news organization on the precipice of disaster? I guess Operation Mockingbird didn't work in your favor after all. There will be too few jobs for weather men. McDonald's is always hiring.

1 | Shane Ruiz | 509 | 10155536461411509_10155536913311509 | Posting fluff today CNN. How about Donna Brazile and the corruption of Hillary Clinton along with the DNC?
2 | Sherry Champion | 202 | 10155536461411509_10155536910471509 | Hillary Clinton should be disqualified for running for president, if not, anyone one that votes for her should be charged with aiding and abetting a CRIMINAL. Six hundred and fifty thousand emails that the FBI is investigating criminally now? ? Bleaching 30 thousand emails after receiving a subpoena for? The Clinton foundation donates over 50 MILLION to Bill Clinton? The Clintons taking millions from Isis enablers and supporter as Americans are being BEHEADED?? Bill Meeting with the DOJ about a criminal case that his wife is being investigated for? Not to mention that Bill Clinton is a Rapist and was found guilty in a court of law and had to pay his victim 600000.00!! There is too much to list! You have to be kidding me!!
3 | David LaBar | 20 | 10155536461411509_10155536941286509 | All these filler pieces CNN, if you need to be pointed towards a real news story, try Donna Brazile let go by CNN for supplying debate questions to HRC!
4 | Claudia I. García Reynoso | 9 | 10155536461411509_10155537020996509 | This post is about an unique museum in Mexico, not politics in USA! All those comments talking about the Candidates in USA are totally out of place; THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS INTERESTING POST!
5 | Robert Minto | 8 | 10155536461411509_10155537034956509 | WTF?? FBI investigating Clinton and I am watching reports on Trump charity donations????? What do I care????? It's his money, and that has zero bearing on anyones ability to run the country. Get it together you hacks!
6 | Josh Nathaniel Davis | 5 | 10155536461411509_10155536995851509 | Ask Hillary why she represented a rapist and than laughed about getting him off. You need to do your research and think about all the women the Clintons have hurt.....she deleted 33000 emails, mostly classified material, had it on a private server, and then lied about sending it, receiving it, deleting it 39 times and counting. Your candidate calls black males super-predators, takes money from countries who kill lesbians and gays, does favors for other nations when they donate to her campaign. Your candidate called the rape victims of Bill Clinto looney tunes when it was proved he did it. He had to settle in court with all of them. Not to mention she failed to send back up when our boys were dying in Benghazi. I would really urge you to do your research on Clinton Corruption and ton reconsider your vote.
7 | James Pilz | 5 | 10155536461411509_10155537031921509 | Just go to a Hillary Clinton rally its a bunch of brain dead losers who get paid to start fights! Looking at hillary is just like looking death in the face. Plus I'm sure her breath could kill a horse

If you are fascinated with dead, go to the morgue... let these people rest!
10 | Gaile Jones | 2 | 10155536461411509_10155537406961509 | Rest assured that CNN only fired Donna Brazile because she got caught !!! Corrupt CNN would have kept quiet, if they could have gotten away with it.Remember Donna’s interview on Fox News Megyn Kelly show? Donna referred to herself as a “good Christian woman.” (I quote)Hmmm….. I don’t think God wants to be named as a ‘co-conspirator’ with Donna Brazile!
