1 | Albert Rodriguez Jr. | 636 | 10154756538826336_10154757158076336 | Wow I guess some high school students are smart enough to think for themselves instead of what the media crams down everyone's throat.
2 | Giulio Braga | 347 | 10154756538826336_10154757157916336 | Well… Trump, in a year, has literally taken down the entire United States government and the mainstream media, we still trust none of you but watching you squirm and refuse to admit defeat is pricelessThank you- #TrumpPence #MAGA
3 | Michael Pinkstaff | 111 | 10154756538826336_10154757161271336 | I'm really hoping for a repeat of the Reagan Carter election of 1980! I believe Donald Trump is going to win by a landslide!
4 | Jeff Zienty | 88 | 10154756538826336_10154757158146336 | the Clinton campaign makes the mafia look like a class full of kindergarten students. Time for this sham to come crashing down and it is. GOOD.
5 | Brandi Bass | 62 | 10154756538826336_10154757156311336 | He's been in the lead in a lot of the mock elections where I'm at. Which means their parents most likely are voting for Trump. :)
6 | Mark Jones | 31 | 10154756538826336_10154757159306336 | This is history in the making. I could be wrong, however it appears that Trump, with a little help from Wikileaks, has single handedly brought down the corrupt democrat party, the media, and exposed the establishment from both sides of the isles. This is what America has needed for a very long time no matter how painful it's going to be for those who willfully participated in it all along.
7 | Stefan Wacker | 26 | 10154756538826336_10154757159471336 | The FBI reportedly found evidence of treason, money laundering and connections to child exploitation – including the infamous Lolita Express – on Anthony Weiner’s home computer, says former federal prosecutor Doug Hagmann
8 | Yvonne Loescher Davis | 4 | 10154756538826336_10154757180396336 | This is what we get if killary hillary wins...stop and think..wake up people and lets stop her from winning...vote Trump/Pence to clean up the corruption. ...get our country back and safe..I just read this article on someone else's newsfeed. It's a real eye opener to say the least!Let me explain a few things to people who don't understand how this will end. People call these Muslims refugees! BS... this is an army invading our country under the assumption they are refugees. This is the only way to invade America from the inside and people say why we are strong and yes America is a super power. Killary wants to bring in 500,000 more how many are already here?. People say they are nice people I live with them and work with them, that is a red herring. Once they have enough and that will be soon if Killary is elected president. And listen to this very closely because it's no joke. Once they have the numbers here it will begin, and remember Obumer is closing Guantanamo Bay and bringing the worst of the worst Muslim leaders here to America. Why would you say does it matter well I'm going to tell you. Once the numbers are here and your "Social Security is funding all this " then they will detonate EMP bombs around America where it will do the most damage to the grid. Now some people ask what is a EMP bomb. It will destroy anything that is electrical, ie cars ,planes, generators,cell phones you get my point now. How will that be bad people ask, so I will explain . America will return to the dark ages no power to stay warm or cook no ac to stay cool no way to ship food no way to keep meat good. No place to buy food no way to call for help so people ask why would I need to call for help. Well that's when these so called refugees will turn into an Army that will start the take over of America. They will go from town to towns state to state and they will kill you cut your head's off they will rape and pillage everything and everyone they have contact with. Christians will be killed without mercy. I'll fight you say I'll call the cops or the army someone. No you won't no way to call for help phones won't work and Killary has already taken our guns so your fight won't last long. ie. Don't bring a gun to a knife fight. But don't worry Killary will set up FEMA camps for your protection she will say but many will be killed in these camps. How will you feed your family with no food no stores no walmart. So many Americans will die from starvation in the first month alone it will be sick. And then you have people in your own town that will try to take what you have to feed their's. Race groups killing and pillaging anywhere they want. America will be lost forever meanwhile all those countries that hate America will attack because we will be like sitting ducks in a pond. So prepare the best you can because this is what you are voting for if you vote this traitor as president. Some of you idiot's will laugh but I assure you when it happens it will be no laughing matter when your young girls are raped in front of you and watch as your sons and husband's heads are cut off. And no one will be able to help you you won't be able to fight because Killary took our right as American citizens all so she can fill her pockets. Obumer is Muslim plant that has brainwashed Killary into destroying the country she says she loves. Trump is our only way out of this out come so be smart people think for yourselfs and let's make America the great country it was before this traitor took control. You need to ask yourselfs why would any United States president give 400 million dollars to country like Iran that is the biggest funder of terrorist Go Trump/Pence Drain those swamps  The peaces of the puzzle are coming together to show the whole picture.  PLEASE SHARE, PLEASE
9 | Brian Culver | 7 | 10154756538826336_10154757170021336 | REASONS TO VOTE FOR DONALD J. TRUMP1. Donald J. Trump is the only candidate who can turn things around for America and should be taken seriously!!! He loves America and Americans of ALL races.2. He is immune to special interest lobbying because he has accepted no donations or special interest money. No other candidate can make this claim.3. He is an executive. The President of the United States is the Chief Executive Officer of our nation. We don’t need a policy expert or a legislator – we need someone who knows how to run an organization. Mr. Trump is the only candidate who has a proven record as a successful executive on a large scale.4. He is honest. Mr. Trump is a man who tells the truth. He may not always say it in the most polished way, but our country has had enough suave liars. It is time for some straight forward honesty.5. He is decisive. As President every decision he makes would be in the best interest of the country. We hear about his having business interests that filed for bankruptcy. In each case, he looked at the situation as it was, and then he cut his losses. We need someone who will look at government programs realistically and if they are failures; will end the wasteful Washington spending.6. He is courageous. Mr. Trump has been viciously attacked by the Washington establishment and the media – and he has not budged one inch. In other words, he is willing to take charge and lead.7. He listens. At Trump Presidential events, the audience gets to actually speak to him without being screened, and he responds without a teleprompter.8. His success is unmatched in the business world by all the others - He attended one of the best business schools/ to make 10 billion dollars.9.

He’s a job producer/ just for the records/ most of his CEO’s are women/ yes they make more than the men/ creditability counts.16. He gives millions to charities.17.

He’s pro military & Vet’s [improve VA hospital/care] Take ISIS oil fields to pay Vets.22. He wants to seal off the boarder [build that wall] He’s built a 96 story building/ he thinks that’s harder than constructing a wall. He understands that a nation without borders, language and laws is not a nation.23. He’s anti-Iran deal/ pro-Israel. He says it states we have to protect Iran if Israel attacks [Iran keeps saying they are going to wipe Israel and us off of the map].24. His pro Christmas stance is anti [political correct].25. He also realizes that our nation is being trashed worldwide and speaks up about it. 26. He recognizes the China money manipulation policy which is anti-USA.27. He says that Japan’s tariff on US goods [one way deal making].28. He wants to put a tariff on Mexican goods/ all traffic/ cut off aid.29.

No BS red tape. 37. He will use China's influence in North Korea to secure the peninsula of Korea and in the process increase commerce amongst China Sea nations...              SUMMARYLike him or not, agree with him or not, it doesn’t matter. So far Trump is the only candidate who has shown that he “can up-set the apple-cart” and make things happen and he is exactly what America needs at this point in time!Everybody should do their homework on the candidates. We must not listen to the “political main stream media”. They are not going to tell you the truth! They have a way of twisting words for their own story and agenda! There is an important choice that each voter has to make. Either you cast your vote for another “puppet candidate” and business as usual in Washington or you  support Donald J. TrumpMAKE AMERICA GREAT!!! AGAINPlease "LIKE" if you agree
10 | Gerard Tourtois | 2 | 10154756538826336_10154757174296336 | Be careful, students are inexperienced and often foolish, often politically correct and often listen to the last who speaks. Do not think it is over until the last polling station closes ! Keep looking for fraud and prevent it. Scrutinise the results, and vote in mass until the last minute. Don't count your chickens before they're hatched. Never !
11 | Elson Riza | 10 | 10154756538826336_10154757157691336 | Formally, elections express the peoples’ will and desire for change. Informally, elections are required to maintain the illusion of freedom and secure the taxes and bodies needed for endless wars.
12 | Michael Simmons | 0 | 10154756538826336_10154757182711336 | Hitler Clinton. Where do I begin. I can make a list 100 times longer than than this one, which would make Trumps worst accusation far more just than any one of Clintons. This criminal(Clinton) deserves to be in the big house(prison) but absolutely not the White House. Anybody that votes for her should consider themselves a criminal and a non-American as well.
13 | Michael Condee | 11 | 10154756538826336_10154757166206336 | The Democratic party is in full panic mode. The polls we see and what they see are totally different. Have you heard how desperately they are begging for votes from the few hundred that show up to see them? All of Washington is scrambling for sides right now. Names are dropping like flies. The circle of Hillary Clinton's corruption is getting bigger. Pretty soon the ax will fall and I for one will not shame myself for voting for Hillary Clinton. Trump is not perfect but nobody else in America is either. I'm voting for Trump. I'm voting to save America

21 | Michael Fairleigh | 0 | 10154756538826336_10154757200176336 | The most significant things here are 1) that we're talking about high schoolers, and 2) the fact that MN is heavily Democratic.  For that demographic to go 35% the other way is telling.
22 | Vidal Reyes Flores | 0 | 10154756538826336_10154757192301336 | •Evolution of Evil:At the beginning, Trump had less 1% of voters support. Everybody knew that he was a donkey. But as his racism, or at least his pandering to the racists baser instincts, became evident, his support started to grow up. That's clear now, all racists are stand up for Trump. The KKK leaders, the whitey supremacist, are stand up for him. Even the hispanics that follow him are paradoxically racists. Most embarrassing of all this are racist evangelicals. Similar to the times of the civil war, the evangelicals are divided as racists and non-racists. The crotches of their daughters are less important than their baleful white supremacist feelings. Neither the Jesus Christ blood has been enough to clean their hearts of this aberrant white supremacy belief. Even prominent actors as Clint Eastwood and politicians like Rudy Giuliani, has exposed themselves as blatant racists because of Trump. Being a non-racist and being a Trump follower, are two completely incompatible things. And as if all of these were not enough, now they are also showing themselves as a male-chauvinist and misogynists. Those are the people which The Donald said that are good Americans, that's really deplorable. The upcoming elections will be an epic battle between non-racists and racists, between the common sense and madness. Donald Trump is playing the racist card. Had it not been a racist, he would not have won more than 4% or 5% of the votes. With this slimy clown and his cronies ruling the US, we will be entering to a new and perilous racial upheavals era. Anyone doubt?

24 | Jerry Robinson | 0 | 10154756538826336_10154757191341336 | The Washington Post: How the heck can voters think Donald Trump is more honest than Hillary Clinton? Donald Trump has said, repeatedly, that he opposed the war in Iraq from the start. He didn't.He said he saw “thousands” of Muslims celebrating on New Jersey rooftops on the night of Sept. 11, 2001. Didn't happen.He said that 58 percent of black youths are unemployed. Nope.These are far from isolated incidents. In fact, 63 percent of the 91 Trump statements that the WaPo's Fact Checker has checked were given a Four Pinocchio rating — meaning they were/are totally false. (A typical candidate gets Four Pinocchios somewhere between 10 and 20 percent of the time; 14.2 percent of Clinton's claims have been given Four Pinocchios.)
25 | Gregory Dale Holland | 9 | 10154756538826336_10154757155836336 | Time to, get real and be honest. The media only want ratings so we have to remind people just who and what trump is....He isA sexistA racistA bigotA poor business man who would be nothing without a handout from daddy A liar, by some accounts 75% of the time he is speaking he is lyingA serial adulterer 3 wives 5 kidsA man that abusesGold star families The disabled Women who he see as physically not perfectCalls Mexicans rapist Was sued for not allowing African American to rent his apartmentsWas sued by a small paint business in Miami this year for non-payment and lost the caseHas threatened violence a this ralliesHas called on his supporters to assault or kill Hillary Clinton twiceHe set up Trump university with the sole goal of ripping off people and targeted vets as customers He is a self-admitted sexual abuserHe is accused and awaiting trial for the rape of a 13 year old girlEncourages Putin and the Russian secret service to try to change the outcome of our democracy ,which by the was breaks Logan's law and is treasonHas paid no federal taxes for years but says he supports our military our troops and our vets. Guess he does not understand that these things are paid for by federal taxesHas declared bankruptcy 4 or 6 times. And says he will run the country the way he runs his business, no thanksMakes all his clothing and trump brand good overseas so outsourcing American jobsUses Chinese's steel rather than keeping American steel workers in jobsFurniture in his hotels is all from overseas.

The Republican Party of Florida alleges that officials in Broward County, which includes Fort Lauderdale, have been opening tens of thousands of vote-by-mail ballots prior to them being cleared for counting.

Nothing to see here, just a glitch in the 100% perfectly fine system.And… strange how dead people seem to vote democrat as well! Clinton couldn't even beat Bernie without cheating.Thank you- #TrumpPence #MAGA

19 | Eric Staffin | 15 | 10154756757511336_10154757054451336 | You have to wonder whether they actually received "twenties" of thousands of ballots but threw away the Trump votes .. leaving only tens of thousands with magically overwhelming support for Hillary.
20 | Hou-Yin Chang | 3 | 10154756757511336_10154757076316336 | This reminds me of the late 1980's to early 1990's controversy over the rap group "2 Live Crew" where the obscene group went after the sheriff because he prosecuted them after the music was found to be obscene.  Seems that group has won because Broward is a hard-left core for stealing votes.  Seems "2 Live Crew" and the left-wing thugs that went after the sheriff a generation ago have won.
21 | Bernie Massey | 5 | 10154756757511336_10154757079531336 | The sad thing is most dems dont know who their party is and will vote blindly for clinton with out hearing one word of the truth . They still think its the 60s party and well its not people.
22 | Danielle Latona | 5 | 10154756757511336_1772285719702958 | When is someone going to intervene and stop this from happening?  I can't believe we are living in the United States of America and what I have seen in the last month is appalling! If she wins this election there will be an uprising, I see it coming 😡😡😡😡😡
23 | Anne Lee | 7 | 10154756757511336_1772279353036928 | They need to go to jail. I remember a year after the election with Obama and Romney a closet full of ballots were found and they were all votes for Romney  and never counted!  it was total fraud it was barely on the news! I live in South Florida and the Democrats will do everything to rig this election!!
24 | Terry Jones | 17 | 10154756757511336_10154757047701336 | Of course they are opening them, if the vote is for Hillary, they keep it and if it's for Trump, the pitch it.  It's the only way she can win!
25 | Jim Vian | 3 | 10154756757511336_10154757076441336 | It should be an automatic landslide victory for Donald J. Trump! It can’t even be called a “choice” anymore! What we must do to elect Trump our next president is so obvious it’s like there’s a cliff we come to and we ask, do I jump over the cliff or not! With so much corruption, so many violations of federal national security statutes, so many foreign government pay for play schemes, such big tax hikes, such astronomical escalation of Obamacare premium hikes which will escalate even more, no strategy to defeat ISIS, no way to stop the unsustainable growth of our national debt, no way to expand our job market, all on Hillary’s side, what’s there to make a choice about?! There’s only one answer and that’s to send Hillary to jail and elect Donald Trump with a House and Senate majority that he can work with to bring any semblance of sanity back to our once we-the-people Constitutional Government!

The Chicago Cubs, who haven't won the World Series since 1908, tweeted out a "super official excuse note" for fans in advance of the team's showdown with the Cleveland Indians.

1 | Danilo Cardenas | 141 | 10154756542916336_10154756903761336 | People, please don't mention Hillary or Trump on this post. Thank you.
2 | Dawn Bruder | 88 | 10154756542916336_10154756938071336 | Folks this isn't about the freaking election!!!! It's about a ballgame. Maybe everyone ought to shut off the news for a few hours and enjoy a game!!!!GO TRIBE!!!
3 | Jason Griffiths | 56 | 10154756542916336_10154756900241336 | Wonder how many bosses would accept that as an excuse for missing work?
4 | Cindy Keaton-Stover | 19 | 10154756542916336_10154756965896336 | The National news does realize there are TWO teams playing tonight right? I know the Cubs winning would be big ratings, but you have counted out the Indians all series. Give it a rest already. #DefendTheLand #YouDontLikeClevelandAndWeDontCare #RallyTogether
5 | Doug Joe Joey Allen | 9 | 10154756542916336_10154756931381336 | Hard to imagine the Cubs won't win, but I will be praying for the Indians and trusting G-d will smile upon them this evening, in an exciting game, which benefits and blesses Cleveland, on the road to an epic recovery, for it's inner city denizens and the whole city. May you, holy One of Israel, bring this to pass, in Yeshua's name.
6 | Allan Brad Forrest | 24 | 10154756542916336_10154756904556336 | Too bad they are gonna lose to the Indians! Curse of the Bambino has yet to be broken ... muhahahahaha
7 | Dustin Melton | 6 | 10154756542916336_10154757005001336 | I'm curious how many bandwagon fans the Cubs will lose if they don't win? Cubs had like 12 fans before they started doing good then everyone magically was a fan lmao
8 | Larry Marten | 8 | 10154756542916336_10154757064981336 | I told my boss there is no way in he!! I am going to miss game 7 and I would not be able to work tonight.She promptly told me there is no way I'm watching game 7, alone. She then asked me what I wanted for dinner.God, I love my wife.
9 | Derek Henderson | 3 | 10154756542916336_10154757025861336 | oh please!  don't give me that crap about a championship drought. the white Sox won ten years ago, the black hawks are always winning, and you also had six nba championships from Jordan. Chicago fans are just spoiled, and greedy. Cleveland has been suffering, and we have some catching up to do. GO TRIBE!!!

12 | Thomas J Huntress | 0 | 10154756542916336_10154757053236336 | the cubs should hold nothing back and use all the pitching they have ready,  spread out over the nine innings to get the indians stymied by it. make it count , as this hasnt happened in quite some time for cubs .as a redsox fan i know how it felt and over the years i think the sox may have won more had the utilized more pitchers.
13 | Jill Reznak | 0 | 10154756542916336_10154757068436336 | So looking forward to the game tonight. We missed the entire game last night due to a 4 1/2 hour power outage and Verizon wasn't working to watch on our phones. Dinner in front of the tv tonight. GO CUBS GO !!!!!!!
14 | Amy Cross Shafer | 1 | 10154756542916336_10154757060586336 | Cleveland Indians fans won't need an excuse note... they'll still get up & go to work the day after Cleveland wins tonight!
15 | Richard Herring | 0 | 10154756542916336_10154757098801336 | I can't take all the bandwagon cubs fans. Pretty cool how most of there fans somehow have tags on the hats they have owned there whole life... only one reason I want Cubs to lose.
16 | Hector Arce | 0 | 10154756542916336_10154757105881336 | Since I was a kid I've been waiting for the Cubs to win the World Series there was rumors going around that when the Cubs go to the World Series and win the World Series it's the end of the world. I hope they win the World Series
17 | Julio Garcia | 3 | 10154756542916336_10154756977731336 | If you have the right to vote, please do so as many people residing in the U.S. cannot. This man is a monster and will probably start WWIII to say the least. I know Hillary is not perfect but at least we know she has what it takes to lead this great nation. If you want to go back to the days MLK got killed then #VoteTrump, if you're a bigot #VoteTrump, if you don't care about this country #VoteTrump, if you want your children to live in a torn up country #VoteTrump, if you have no soul/values #VoteTrump, I know this country is founded on Laws but no man in this country is here 'Lawfully' with the those Laws written by Native American blood. If we follow the laws of god and have basic morals we would have no problem with our neighbors, we would embrace them instead regardless of orientation, religion, disability, race and anything that Trump does not stand for. I'm done talking about this bigot as he is wasting my time and energy. Again if you can vote go vote, but remember that your vote can either keep the world as is, or make is 100 times worse. God Bless!
18 | Mike Conway | 0 | 10154756542916336_10154757117871336 | Joe Buck is a giant TOOL and should never be allowed to telecast a playoff game again. He is nothing but a loud mouthed shill for any team BUT the Cubs.
19 | Phillip Milligan | 1 | 10154756542916336_10154757063586336 | Can't watch the whole thing is rigged just think how much money they would loose if they only played 3 games not to mention there's supposed to be laws against price gouging 1100 a ticket if that's not price gouging I don't know what is
20 | Andrew Land | 0 | 10154756542916336_10154757013016336 | Maybe it's time for the entire Cubs organization to apologize for the horrible way Steve Bartman has been treated. The guy stuck out his hands because a baseball was flying towards his head and the Cubs and the entire city of Chicago have made his life miserable ever since. He still gets death threats. Cubs need to man up and right the wrong that has been done to Bartman. Chicago doesn't need a scapegoat. They will NEVER be winners until they embrace Bartman and admit he is not to blame for the team's past failures.
21 | Guahan Ash | 2 | 10154756542916336_10154756939356336 | If I was an employer, my employee would be terminated, because he/she wasn't sick, to miss work.If I was a teacher, my students who missed school will be marked as "unexcused absence", and will not be allowed to make up assignments missed during their absence.

A new WikiLeaks release shows a possible conflict of interest between a Justice Department official and Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Cheryl Cook Junk | 958 | 10154756629906336_10154756641731336 | The FBI needs to tie the Justice Departments hands... the DOJ is criminal.... they need to force this guy's hands to step down or start stating all that he knows...It was because of Loretta Lynch herself that the FBI was not allowed to investigate the email scandal in the proper way... it was because of her there was no Grand Jury or search warrants... they are all crooked and corrupt...
2 | Kevin Stewart | 660 | 10154756629906336_10154756640401336 | It's is my opinion that Trump is a pragmatist. He sees a problem and understands it must be fixed. He doesn't see the problem as liberal or conservative, he sees it only as a problem. That is a quality that should be admired and applauded, not condemned.Viewing problems from a liberal perspective has resulted in the creation of more problems, more entitlement programs, more victims, more government, more political correctness, and more attacks on the working class in all economic strata.Viewing things according to the so-called Republican conservative perspective has brought continued spending, globalism to the detriment of American interests and wellbeing, denial of what the real problems are, weak, ineffective, milquetoast, leadership that amounts to Barney Fife Deputy Sheriff, appeasement oriented and afraid of its own shadow.Immigration isn't a Republican problem – it isn't a liberal problem – it is a problem that threatens the very fabric and infrastructure of America. It demands a pragmatic approach not an approach that is intended to appease one group or another.The impending collapse of the economy isn't a liberal or conservative problem, it is an American problem. That said, until it is viewed as a problem that demands a common sense approach to resolution, it will never be fixed because the Democrats and Republicans know only one way to fix things and the longevity of their impracticality has proven to have no lasting effect. Successful businessmen like Donald Trump find ways to make things work, they do not promise to accommodate.Trump uniquely understands that China’s manipulation of currency is not a Republican problem or a Democrat problem. It is a problem that threatens our financial stability and he understands the proper balance needed to fix it. Here again successful businessmen like Trump who have weathered the changing tides of economic reality understand what is necessary to make business work and they, unlike both sides of the political aisle, know that if something doesn't work, you don't continue trying to make it work hoping that at some point it will.As a pragmatist Donald Trump hasn't made wild pie-in-the-sky promises of a cell phone in every pocket, free college tuition, and a $15 hour minimum wage for working the drive-through at a Hamburger place.I argue that America needs pragmatists because pragmatists see a problem and find ways to fix them. They do not see a problem and compound it by creating more problems.You may not like Donald Trump, but I suspect that the reason people do not like him is because: (1) he is antithetical to the “good old boy” method of brokering backroom deals that fatten the coffers of politicians; (2) they are unaccustomed to hearing a candidate speak who is unencumbered by the financial shackles of those who own them vis-a`-vis donations; (3) he is someone who is free of idiomatic political ideology; and (4) he is someone who understands that it takes more than hollow promises and political correctness to make America great again.Listening to Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders talk about fixing America is like listening to two lunatics trying to “out crazy” one another. Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio are owned lock, stock, and barrel by the bankers, corporations, and big dollar donors funding their campaigns. Bush can deny it but common sense tells anyone willing to face facts is that people don't give tens of millions without expecting something in return.We have had Democrats and Republican ideologues and what has it brought us? Are we better off today or worse off? Has it happened overnight or has it been a steady decline brought on by both parties? I submit that a pragmatist is just what America needs right now. And as I said earlier, a pragmatist sees a problem and understands that the solution to fix same is not about a party, but a willingness and boldness to get it done. People are quick to confuse and despise confidence as arrogance, but that is often just the reaction from those who have never accomplished anything in their lives despite having opportunity and ability and people who have always played it safe not willing to risk failure.
3 | Martin Meyer | 205 | 10154756629906336_10154756642666336 | People considering voting for Hillary (for reasons that are indefensible) are aware that she wants to secure mothers the right to murder their child the day it's set to born, right? Making her nothing but a murderer. If you vote for her, I hope you feel guilty every day you look yourself in the mirror. All those innocent, healthy lives on your conscience (if you still have one).
4 | Christopher Cook | 172 | 10154756629906336_10154756640006336 | John Podesta thanked Peter Kadzik for keeping him out of jail..How he can now be overseeing this investigation amazes me & Donald Trump should be screaming about his appointment..
5 | Stacy Dispenza | 107 | 10154756629906336_10154756644551336 | I predict a lot of prison time handed out when this is all done...Anyone that gets close to the Clinton's becomes dirty instantly.
6 | Greg Poore | 109 | 10154756629906336_10154756666836336 | This has gotten BEYOND ridiculous. It's time for a Special Prosecutor. If crimes were committed, those responsible- regardless of who they are, including Clinton- need to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. If no crimes were committed (that being highly unlikely, given what has come to light), then fine, move on. We are turning into a Banana Republic, the very thing immigrants flock to this Country to escape. This is no longer about Trump or Clinton. It's about the American Judicial System being bastardized. Wake up folks. Once our Judiciary is compromised, and it already may very well be, we're no different than Venezuala or some third world Country. I say this as a retired Federal Agent who spent a career working for a Federal Law Enforcement Agency under the DOJ, in the very Judicial System that is being made a mockery of. It's disgusting to watch.
7 | Josh Sanders | 89 | 10154756629906336_10154756637886336 | So Hillary tried to use the good  ol womans card again at her rally by using the poor, poor victim alicia machado to attack big ol mean Trump...... did she also mention this fine example of womens virtue machado was also in mexican equivalent of playboy? OR she was caught having sex on mexicos version if big brother the tv show which her then husband saw and divorced her? OR how she was married to and is the baby mama of one of mexicos most notorious drug lords and cartel leaders??? Wow!!! She really is a poor defenseless victim huh? I love seeing democrats and Hillary grasping for straws trying to throw anything they can to stick to Trump. 😂😂😂😂😂 #desperate
8 | Tim Cody | 40 | 10154756629906336_10154756701056336 | Have any of you, democrat or republican wondered just how deep this corruption goes? Why does it have to be Wikileaks, why not out own investigation system? Is everyone on the take?  One thing no one can deny is that it keeps linking back to Hilary or the  Clinton Foundation. Things have to change and it won't be Hilary making that happen!
9 | Tony Perseo | 41 | 10154756629906336_10154756670766336 | Comforting to know that our tax dollars are going to aiding this corrupt liar.

For my family and your families and our kids futures we have to stop Clinton by voting trump in

13 | Paula A Adams | 11 | 10154756629906336_10154756704396336 | I have a headache from from Hillary screeching and yelling at her rally. I was in the other room and heard it all the way down the hall into the bedroom. She sounds like she is stomping her feet and chastising children threatening they better vote for her or boy are they are getting in trouble. It's not attractive and not something I want to listen to for the next four years. So far everyone knows she is the most corrupt candidate to run for President in our history Whatever excuses people make to vote for her I hope they can live with that decision. If she gets in she will steamroll the constitution and blame it on the person closest to her. She surrounds herself with corrupt people. If you want a safe America don't vote for Hillary. What about your kids and grandkids? I want to keep them safe. She just doesn't make sense to me.
14 | Mike L Jackson | 16 | 10154756629906336_10154756668181336 | Apparently, the FBI forgot to visit the Cornell Law Library. Word for word from the Cornell Law Library Former United States Attorney General Michael Mukasey tells MSNBC that not only is Hillary Clinton's private email server illegal, it "disqualifies" her from holding any federal office. Very specifically points to one federal law, Title 18. Section 2071.For those of us who do not have United States Code committed to memory, here's what it says:“(a) Whoever willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys, or attempts to do so, or, with intent to do so takes and carries away any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both. (b) Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States. As used in this subsection, the term “office” does not include the office held by any person as a retired officer of the Armed Forces of the United States.”Yes, it explicitly states "shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States.Shouldn't voters know that? The media won't tell them. So it's up to us. I DID MY PART......NOW DO  YOURS!!!!

He has no problem saying what people want to hear to get his way, which is the same way he built his hotels and landscapes by agreeing to have companies build them while he had no intention on paying many of them. He has abused the bankruptcy and court system using his crooked lawyers to find loopholes and file lawsuits to intimidate his creditors. He will do the same thing to the American people, while he leaves our government in shambles as bush did, he will go back to his penthouse and brag about how he swindled his way to the white house.

17 | Rob Savio | 65 | 10154756562466336_1596801263957172 | An honest mistake is missing your train stop or forgetting to pay the electric bill.

It was done willfully and purposely to conceal everything she was doing as Secretary of State and with her foundation. Remember, she didn't return any state department emails after she left office. The Benghazi committee requested her emails and the state department didn't have any. That's not an honest mistake, that's intentional!

23 | John Arias | 25 | 10154756562466336_10154756574336336 | From Canexit ,,,,,,WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE LEARNED FROM READING WIKILEAKS So here's the REAL story. Amb. Stevens was sent to Benghazi post haste in order to retrieve US made Stinger missiles supplied to Ansar al Sharia without Congressional oversight or permission. Hillary brokered the deal through Stevens and a private arms dealer named Marc Turi. Then some of the shoulder fired missiles ended up in Afghanistan used against our own military. It was July 25th, 2012 when a Chinook helicopter was taken down by one of our own Stingers, but the idiot Taliban didn't arm the missile and the Chinook didn't explode, but had to land anyway. An ordnance team recovered the serial number off the missile which led back to a cache of Stingers being kept in Qatar by the CIA. Obama and Hillary were now in full panic mode and Stevens was sent in to retrieve the rest of the Stingers. This was a "do-or-die" mission, which explains the stand down orders given to multiple commando teams. It was the State Dept, not the CIA that supplied them to our sworn enemies, because Petraeus wouldn't supply these deadly weapons due to their potential use on commercial aircraft. Then, Obama threw Gen. Petraeus under the bus after he refused to testify that he OK'd the BS talking points about a spontaneous uprising due to a Youtube video. Obama and Hillary committed treason...and THIS is what the investigation is all about, why she had a private server, (in order to delete the digital evidence), and why Obama, two weeks after the attack, told the UN that the attack was because of a Youtube video, even though everyone knew it was not. Further...the Taliban knew that this administration aided and abetted the enemy without Congressional approval when Boehner created the Select Cmte, and the Taliban began pushing the Obama Administration for the release of 5 Taliban Generals. Bowe Bergdahl was just a pawn...everyone KNEW he was a traitor. So we have a traitor as POTUS that is not only corrupt, but compromised...and a woman that is a serial liar, perjured herself multiple times at the Hearing whom is running for POTUS. Only the Dems, with their hands out, palms up, will support her. Perhaps this is why no military aircraft was called in...because the administration knew our enemies had Stingers.Copied and pasted...and pasted again and again and again until everyone reads this truth.... share
24 | David Zúñiga | 19 | 10154756562466336_1596808737289758 | Mr. Obama thinks people might have a problem voting for Hillary because she is a "WOMAN". NO, it is the "criminal behavior, history of lying, failure to protect ambassadors under her care, granting interviews and favors for big donors, and promotion of killing babies before they are born" that's a problem. Did I mention that shrill voice?
25 | Jodie Harby | 10 | 10154756562466336_980421495414162 | Honest mistake? You mean as Secretary of State she didn't have the common sense to know she shouldn't have had a private email server in her home ??? And she's running for President?  smh

This is so they discredit the Government slowly, while raising the debt ceiling. Then like we have now. We get a corporate overlord who promises to fix congress. The people are so disappointed they look for the one who says what they feel. Soon the corporate overlord will be in control. An economic super power with the ability to place laws into affect. With a military to enforce. This is how democracy dies, to thunderous applause. It will go smoothly at first, as promised. The people who leaked information to our enemies have their fall women. She's dying and gains favors for her daughter who will succeed her. As long as she takes the blame. Eventually the debt is called in, America Can't pay because the American people have been held down. They used our emotions against us. (If you cannot control your emotions, he who controls your emotions controls you.). The Corporations step in and offer to buy the debt. Then with swift moves like the Nazi party. They've consolidated their power. They'll villinize their enemies and then final step is to institute genocide. It's a plan that's being placed through decades if not centuries.The corporations always had one enemy. The only one who could stop them. The Government. The Government is no longer a threat. This will be a dictatorship.

11 | Jimmy Mack | 1 | 10154756493506336_10154756695121336 | Donald J. Trump proudly acknowledges he did not pay a dime in federal income taxes for years on end. He insists he merely exploited tax loopholes legally available to any billionaire — loopholes he says Hillary Clinton failed to close during her years in the United States Senate. “Why didn’t she ever try to change those laws so I couldn’t use them?” Mr. Trump asked during a campaign rally last month.But newly obtained documents show that in the early 1990s, as he scrambled to stave off financial ruin, Mr. Trump avoided reporting hundreds of millions of dollars in taxable income by using a tax avoidance maneuver so legally dubious his own lawyers advised him that the Internal Revenue Service would most likely declare it improper if he were audited.
12 | John Reid | 0 | 10154756493506336_10154756759101336 | Imagine it is November 9, 2016 in America and we wake up knowing who our new President will be. If it is Hillary, think of the groups of people that will celebrate. Illegal Immigrants, criminals and future criminals who will be supported for pulling a gun on a police officer, planned parenthood, the media, and the list goes on and on that represent everything that is wrong with America. If you're still "with her," look around at who you'll be celebrating with. Now imagine waking up knowing that Trump is our new President. You may or may not like him, or really know what kind of president he will be. But here are some things you will know for sure:• The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.• The media has been neutered forever.• Career politicians will have lost all job security.• The guns in your home will safely stay there.• Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.• Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally• Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.• No more apologies to the world for being great!• Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.• Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.• There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.• The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.• The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9th if Trump does win.Under no circumstances will I vote for Hillary Clinton.#Hillary #Pelosi #Kaine #NeverHillary #BillClinton #HillaryClinton #Obama #Bernie #Sanders #DemExit #DNCleaks #Hypocrites #ExtremeCarelessness #LIESLIESLIES #RiggedSystem #CrookedHillary #MichelleObama #Liars #Failures #Traitors #BarrakObama #Wikileaks #JOOO1https://www.facebook.com/theconservativetribune/videos/164828893921196/

Germany, half as large as Texas,  took 900 000 in 2015. We are all still alive. There is no more terrorism than there was the years before. Trump is spreading irrational fear. He doesn't have the skills, the temper, nor the dignity to be president of the US. HE is the real danger to global peace.

18 | Xavier Keough | 31 | 10154756355956336_10154756367416336 | Solving Immigration in 60 secondsFor decades politicians have muddled a simple issue of national security with endless victimization banter solely to achieve their goal of forever tipping America’s electoral balance. California is case-in-point - a once red state turned dark blue via orchestrated illegal immigration, rampant anti-Americanism and blanket Amnesty. Unfortunately, considering an estimated 15-20 million illegal immigrants currently reside in America, locating and deporting those individuals would be an arduous task if not an extremely costly one. Not only could such an endeavor result in mass chaos in the streets, a public relations nightmare would ensue if these actions resulted in loss of life among immigration officials or the countless subjects they pursued. Although America is fully justified in deporting or arresting all of these individuals and their families, I believe these critical concerns can be diligently and equitably addressed in 5 simple steps, or more succinctly, one Constitutional Amendment.1) Any illegal immigrant wishing to remain in America must come forward to be fully vetted, medically and criminally. Those who successfully pass will be approved for a conditional guest/work visa and required to pay taxes; which will include a national duty imposed on all foreign guest workers to pay for their screening and monitoring. However, because these individuals knowingly broke our immigration laws, they will NOT be eligible for citizenship, public assistance or granted the right to vote. Any guest worker/resident who commits future egregious or felonious acts – i.e., murder, rape, acts of terrorism, vote fraud, harboring other illegals – will be imprisoned, deported, and permanently barred from re-entering the country. Their immediate family will also be subject to the same penalties. All children or “anchor babies” born to guest residents will not receive citizenship or the privileges prescribed within.2) Those immigrants wishing to become actual American citizens must physically leave the country, file for citizenship and complete the process afforded by law before returning to America; those prudent actions they should have taken before illegally crossing our border. 3) Eliminate all Sanctuary Cities. American citizens are not given refugee from breaking the law so why would a foreign trespasser? Those illegals who do not subject themselves to a background check for a guest visa, or willingly vacate the country to apply for citizenship, will be tracked/arrested and banned from returning to America or ever applying for citizenship.4) Build a Wall. Once completed, anyone who illegally enters America will serve a mandatory prison term, be deported, and banned from returning or ever becoming a U.S. citizen. 5) All immigration from Islamic countries must cease for the foreseeable future; at least until a credible method is found to properly identify Muslims and thoroughly investigate their backgrounds for possible radical ties. All Islamic nationals currently residing in America on guest or student visas must be identified and re-screened. If insufficient information exists on any given subject, they will be immediately returned to their native country. With a 500% increase in the prevalence of global terrorist attacks since 2008, consider these precautions justified and long overdue. Self-preservation needs to justification.Every civilized nation recognizes the absolute necessity of protecting their borders and maintaining an orderly immigration program. With due diligence, not subversive political subterfuge, we can honor the promise of America - a beacon of hope and opportunity for all mankind - without sacrificing our national sovereignty or the safety of the American people; that indelible duty our elected government swore to fulfill.
19 | Jennifer Lynn Brooks | 5 | 10154756355956336_1773026402945998 | Big difference between Muslims and radical Islamic terrorists. Muslims are actually very peaceful. It is not Trump's fault that some people can't see that difference.
20 | Joseph Tierney | 8 | 10154756355956336_10154756391286336 | Yes. No need for political spin, he says what he means and means what he says and that's why he's going to be the next president of United States of America. This is why the people will elect him, this is what the vast majority of the people want. And that is democracy,  the will of the people the majority of the people must be the law of the land. If you don't like it and you are in the minority, remember that in a democracy it is the majority of the will of the people. The minority has had eight years to rule and has done a deplorable job tearing down this nation and the majority will take it back and rebuild it. Accept  this, minority or risk more fascism. We live in a democratic republic, a nation ruled by law. That is America.
21 | Joe Mazzella | 4 | 10154756355956336_1773040839611221 | We are sick and tired of the hard drugs , gangs, cartels, violence flowing into our country from Mexico. Also, the refugees can stay put.

He has always been a worker. And he will work non-stop for All Americans.
2 | Robert Perri | 1562 | 10154755969076336_10154756089811336 | Now that's how a Presidential/President should sound.  Not like  President Obama and Hillary who would rather trash the cops, and feel sorry for the criminals/murders.
3 | Ann Ylrebmik | 223 | 10154755969076336_10154756090526336 | Someone called it right...they said there would be a police shooting or something to get the focus off of Hillary being investigated again....sad and pathetic how we can call the shots bout what will go down before it happens with this poor excuse for what you call a woman!!
4 | Bill Right | 249 | 10154755969076336_10154756090541336 | I would trust PeeWee Herman sitting behind me in a movie theater while out on a date with O J Simpson, drinking at Bill Cosby's bar with Flint Michigan ice cubes, all while Casey Anthony babysits for me before I would trust HER to walk my dog!!!
5 | Heather Malek Rice | 165 | 10154755969076336_10154756090801336 | Thank you Mr Trump for acknowledging current events. If you go to Killarys page, it's all about her campaign and asking for more money. And she NEVER talks to the American people.
6 | Debby Havard Slater | 98 | 10154755969076336_10154756110936336 | God bless you, Donald Trump. I am praying our Father is with you, but more importantly, that He is in your heart and that HE will remain there as you take the highest office in our land. Many prayers for these families who have lost loved ones just because they are trying to protect our lives. I am praying this Trump presidency will restore patriotism and respect for our military and police officers and self-respect and independence to United States citizens.
7 | Irene Zamarron | 113 | 10154755969076336_10154756108031336 | My husband is in law enforcement as were my father and grandfather. Trump being the first of the two candidates to always go public with a "shout out" to these families means a lot to me and my family. Trump/Pence 2016❤️🇺🇸
8 | Susan Turner Petersen | 71 | 10154755969076336_10154756091056336 | RIP officers Trump has to win this election. I am from a family of LEO.'s. sorry to politicize this tragedy but I want our LEO's to work and live in a better place than they are now..
9 | Elaine Bollinger-Rife | 41 | 10154755969076336_10154756112966336 | Yes Trump actually prays! And at his Conventions they open with a prayer! So, why do people want a Woman who thinks she is a God and can get away with crimes? She never has prayer at her Conventions! She is to arrogant! And, she does not support our Country! She never has flags or flag pins, only Hillary pins and her communist outfits!
10 | Ted Bennett | 49 | 10154755969076336_10154756099301336 | SO why was the original reaction "Thanks BLM!" or "we know it was a Muslim" but now that it's a deranged white man who is likely a right-wing Christian and is a Trump supporter, all you hear is *crickets*this is what you need to fear, right here America. People like this lunatic.
11 | Mike Hatch | 32 | 10154755969076336_10154756108366336 | instead of puking out talking points, why not report what you see in your town - here in panhandle of Florida its all solid red and the enthusiasm is incredible - no HRC signs here!!!!
12 | Julie Bir | 28 | 10154755969076336_10154756111861336 | Donald Trump is absolutely right. People who cannot respect their police force, their protectors must be deported or put behind bars. It's a shame on those Americans. Big shame. Trump for president on this!

14 | Adam Storick | 8 | 10154755969076336_10154756149111336 | Q:Why do all his videos have smiley faces and she has angry ones? How is she winning?A: Surprising at may be to you, this is Fox News' website. The majority of people in this site are Pro Trump. It's like asking why does a video of Hitler's speech circa 1939 get a ton of likes on Stormfront's website. Rest assured. Also, voters on the left are more educated (in most part) than those on the right. This allows us to actually verbalize our opinions, rather than having to settle for CAPITALIZING words for no reason and including a s--t tone of US flags and turd emojis to get our points across.Q: Why do his rallies have 25K people and Hillary can't fill a Gym.A: While it makes for a good story, in reality it's not the case. Trump is in his element however when he does all the talking and doesn't have to answer any questions (see debates 1-3). There were 120,000,000+ votes cast in the 2012 election, not thousands. In any case, this is not an indicator for who will win the election. As Seth Meyers said on his show recently, "If getting the most people in one place is the deciding factor in the election, our next President would be IKEA on a Saturday."Q: Why doesn't Hillary ever wear a US Flag Pin?A: The election is not an Olympic event. The right is often caught up on "symbols" measuring how much someone is Patriotic or not. In reality, wearing a flag pin on your lapel does not measure one's Patriotism, it's simply a prop. Prior to the election, did you see Trump wearing a flag pin on his lapel? Of course not. He only has started to do so now, because he knows a large number of his base fall for it.
15 | Alec Gormley | 10 | 10154755969076336_10154756097836336 | It is an attack on us all just like what we are going through with ISIS and Obama releases them from Gitmo OMG and you can't see a problem with that, what is he saying by releasing terrorists, they are now fighting again sooo?
16 | Ayden N EliSanchez | 14 | 10154755969076336_10154756128371336 | You will never catch Hillary praying, shes going to take away our religous freedom. Christians need to get out and vote, be bold church now is not the time to sitback. We WILL have our country and freedoms taken. Neither trump or Hillary are great, but pay attention to who will be working and helping making key decisions. Who will be in their ear influencing their decisions, are they good people, do they stand for what is right and what is Just?
17 | Deborah Ahrns | 9 | 10154755969076336_10154756126111336 | Amen we need a fund raiser to help the families of ALL of the fallen officers this year!  Also NC is still recovering from the hurricane it would be very important to raise this awareness and visit this area with relief food water and mobile homes while they are rebuilding.
18 | Dan Jestic | 10 | 10154755969076336_10154756111461336 | Can't wrap my head around the disconnect: mindless Liberals continuing to talk about the need for "community policing"to nurture trust and respect while cops get  picked off one by one. Thanks, Mr. President, for championing respect for law and order [eye roll].
19 | Margaret Petriella Blackwell | 9 | 10154755969076336_10154756103241336 | This is EXACTLY what the president of the United States should say,  unlike the one we have now who doesn't show any support for our police force.
20 | Robert Jordan | 6 | 10154755969076336_673880752780315 | He shot the cops because he was upset they didn't arrest black people for sitting during the national anthem. Why don't you just call this what it is, white Christian terrorism?
21 | Jim Denney | 8 | 10154755969076336_10154756097791336 | Could a Political Promise like this get someone elected President? Couldn't hurt any, right? Attention: Here's what I need to hear from the Presidential Candidates, "any Law that has been passed, or will be passed in the future or any Executive Order that has already been signed, or any Executive Order that will be signed in the future, will apply equally to everyone from the President on down to everyone in these United States of America, no exceptions." If you think like I do, please "like" & "share". Think about this, we may never get a chance like this again. Think about Congress and other people in DC and the "WALK-AROUND" Clause in Obamacare!!
22 | Matt Damien | 2 | 10154755969076336_1283494545005152 | Did he mention the reason it happened was that one of his supporters, complete with Trump lawn sign, obviously emboldened by Trump's #deplorable rhetoric, decided to wave a Confederate flag at a football game and then, when summarily ejected, decided to "2nd Amendment" those poor heroic officers. Welcome to Donald Trump's 'murica. #deplorable
23 | Therese Kramer | 4 | 10154755969076336_10154756104551336 | That's nice! What about those at standing rock being beaten while being calm and peaceful!!! I'm surprised at you! The love of money should not outweigh integrity! Be a blessing today!
24 | Waldo Wood | 5 | 10154755969076336_10154756134326336 | Mark up Two more Attacks against Law Enforcement to BLM, obama aND Hillary Clinton. Black Lives Matter ="Pigs in a blanket- fry'em like bacon""What do we want?Dead Cops!When do we want it?Now!"BLM- Should be designated as a 'Domestic Terrorist Organization'a p op🇺🇸
25 | Amb Alam Kyriel | 5 | 10154755969076336_10154756101766336 | God already programmed that there would be a time for a black President and after a black President comes the first woman President in the history of United States of America; because American people have their Trust in God. "So shall it be Amen."

Breaking News: Police in Iowa have captured the man accused of shooting and killing two officers in an overnight ambush in Des Moines, Fox News confirms.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Jus Grant | 617 | 10154755926446336_10154755939081336 | Praying for the officers families!!!  Pray we all find understanding especially regarding our differences.
2 | Victoria Wise | 716 | 10154755926446336_10154755940946336 | Thats what happens when a weak president and a corrupt self-serving establishment fails to bring the people together under one flag and one law... Hillary will be worse
3 | MV Kemp | 374 | 10154755926446336_10154755931781336 | Obama has diminished the respect for police throughout his presidency.
4 | Syed Hassan Rizvi | 545 | 10154755926446336_10154755933066336 | Trump is like the modern day Paul Revere!! Traveling the country to assure Americans that change is coming when he's elected President of the United States!! Trump plane gets around! He's our hero!! Thank you Mr. Trump!
5 | Wanda Wilson | 188 | 10154755926446336_10154755946026336 | And this scumbag is still alive....should have shot him down like a wild rabid animal......Praying for the family both blood and blue...<3
6 | Shirley Vercelli | 101 | 10154755926446336_10154755953576336 | I'm just sick about this horrible murder of two officers! I can't wait til Nov.8th for the change to start and police are respected again!!
7 | Mary Hopkins | 64 | 10154755926446336_10154755946636336 | I was so heartbroken this morning when I heard about the ambush....I am glad this man is caught so he can be brought to justice, although this will not replace the officers that were killed, at least he will have to face his punishment!
8 | Dave Rosset | 47 | 10154755926446336_1813943822218328 | I'm from Des Moines and the shootings happened not far from where I live. Praying for the officer's family, their brothers and sisters in blue, and our community.
9 | Bj Taylor | 49 | 10154755926446336_10154755972431336 | liberals' America.  We older Americans have managed to fail to teach the younger generation, the value of ethics, morals, and that there really is a right and wrong.  We have enabled them to conclude that God is a waste of time and they can successfully direct the future of America without Him.
10 | David Kieffer | 49 | 10154755926446336_10154755967601336 | Why didn't they kill him? If he were black they probably would have. Just sayin......by the way before anybody says anything , I'm white. My condolences and prayers go out the families and friends of the officers this monster took from us.
11 | Scott Mattern | 52 | 10154755926446336_10154755951566336 | Too bad he didn't point a gun at them. So they could do the us tax payers a favor. Prayers for the families of these brave officers that sacrificed their lives to serve and protect us.
12 | Vicki Hammons Woodlee | 31 | 10154755926446336_690126247820685 | As the mother of two police officers, I am sorry and sad when any police life is taken. The officers were sitting in their squad cars. Probably waiting for the shift to end. Maybe doing a report from a previous call. Maybe thinking about getting home and seeing their son/daughter before the child heads off to school. The officers weren't in a confrontation. They weren't on a dangerous call. They were simply being a human being. In a car. With a badge and uniform. And they were killed for that. Please America.Stop.
13 | Ronald James Simpson | 20 | 10154755926446336_1172964099461367 | can any of you crazy people explain to me how Trump is going to "bring respect" back to police? I'm assuming your reasoning can only be that he's white. I say that because even though this president has done nothing to make things worse for cop (police shootings are lower under this president than any in our lifetime) he is black and y'all blame him for every cop shooting in America. Trump has done nothing and proposed nothing that would fix relations between cops and citizens, you really believe he can, and he's white.
14 | Sparky Beason | 16 | 10154755926446336_690122867821023 | This is so very disturbing. One of the shootings happened just blocks from my home. I never expected anything like this to happen in our small peaceful community. God bless these officers and pray for the families of the fallen. I also pray that Donald Trump will be elected on Tuesday with the hope of law and order restored in our broken nation.
15 | Chaz Harris | 31 | 10154755926446336_10154755987516336 | Welcome to America, where you can kill two police while being white but get choked to death for selling loose cigarettes get killed while reaching for your gun permit, shoot up a church and get 🍔 king smfh
16 | David Lester | 18 | 10154755926446336_10154755948631336 | So Hillary is really upset that the FBI Director James Comey is "dumping" on her right before the election.... So everyone wants to know Hillary, how does it feel to be aborted just 11 days before delivery?
17 | Linda Davis | 26 | 10154755926446336_10154755945196336 | Just watched the Gov of Colorado and want to tell him that everyone of my friends that live in that state said they are voting for Trump.  I wouldn't write him off yet and say he only has the people that show up at his rallies.  Good try
18 | Brian Meals | 28 | 10154755926446336_10154755980596336 | You tube videos showing he was a white trash racist who showed up to a high school football game with a Confederate flag and was escorted out.
19 | Aaron Bordsen | 3 | 10154755926446336_10154756001146336 | my condolences to the families of these officers prayers sent..........hhhmmm right before elections gun control on the table crooked over-reaching big gov. canidate emploding slipping in polls FBI ivestigations.....no nope!! too convenient I'm not buying it democrats upset senate will not confirm their Anti-2nd amendment supreme court nominee  Merrick garland known gun hater..... ploy of big gov. socialist  elitists trying to finish obozo's wet dream of the destruction of America
20 | Ellayna Oliver | 0 | 10154755926446336_690269584473018 | Living in the area this took place, My heart is continuing to break every time I see something about this. People need to wake up and need to put a stop to police brutality. These families are hurting because someone thinks so little of our law enforcement. 💙💙💙 #bluelivesmatter
21 | Beverly Schuelein Schrimpf | 8 | 10154755926446336_1813940952218615 | Praying for the families of these brave police officers  May God Bless Them and all the other officers who put their lives on the line everyday.
22 | Ann Syverson Lenaghan | 6 | 10154755926446336_690122704487706 | This is unreal to see our community on national news in this way. Please pray for our police departments, families, and our community.
23 | Alec Gormley | 8 | 10154755926446336_10154755955756336 | Systemic failure of this magnitude is scary, wait till rioters start shooting back armed and ready to do battle against the Hillary mafia ruining our country.
24 | Robert Fisher | 12 | 10154755926446336_690129891153654 | There is no logic in blaming OUR President for this tragedy. The killer is a redneck, racist. He's not exactly Obama's primary support demographic.Also, he was thrown out of a football game for flying a confederate flag and also threatened the life of an African American neighbor two years ago while hurling racial slurs at him.
25 | Wendy Drahota | 9 | 10154755926446336_690131971153446 | This is enough!! I'm so sick of hearing cops doing their jobs and getting shot!!! We need control back in this country!!!!! Do people not get it??? Prayers to the families and police dept that have to burry two more in blue!!

Spread the News: Police are asking parents to "please check and double check your children's candy."
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Allen Stafford | 979 | 10154755913156336_10154755918656336 | I've been checking in son's candy for days..... I still haven't swallowed a nail.
2 | Jd Bales | 460 | 10154755913156336_10154755929626336 | Historically it's the kids parents looking for money or fame... no kid has ever died from Halloween candy. Stop spreading fear.
3 | Gene Cole | 163 | 10154755913156336_10154755942631336 | Every year it's the same thing. Scary unsubstantiated urban folklore. Next year I'm going to spread the rumor that my daughter came home with a puppy in her candy bucket !!!
4 | Dottie Ann | 208 | 10154755913156336_10154755928121336 | A GOOD IDEA FOR PARENTS: Take your children Trick or Treating for the experience but then dispose of all the candy when you get home. Instead, YOU give them a big bag filled with an assortment of all their favorites! Worth it to keep your children safe! (Just my thoughts as a Critical Care RN.)
5 | Michelle Craddock | 111 | 10154755913156336_10154755928811336 | I think going door-to-door on halloweens time has come and gone.  Parents should have block parties for their kids instead.  I think it would be safer.  There are too many nut jobs in the world who want to harm children.
6 | Jessica R Ferris | 96 | 10154755913156336_10154755938441336 | I'm a big skeptic of these reports. Not to say you shouldn't check and throw away candy with compromised wrapping or just looks suspicious. But most of the time these are staged.
7 | Brian Carter | 45 | 10154755913156336_10154755942371336 | This is why soccer mom's invented Trunk or Treat. Stop spreading fear and BS. You are also the reason for people putting up Christmas decorations before Halloween.  #stopprematuredecorations
8 | Joshua Clark | 20 | 10154755913156336_10154755941856336 | IF this is real...and I say that because there have been so many hoax stories over the years...it means that someone is committing this violent and malicious act from their own home, in person. Seems that your kids didnt go to THAT many houses where you couldn't figure out where these came from. Some kids (most) eat a bit of candy while walking house to house. I cant believe nobody figured this out and got the person arrested.  That being said, I didnt read the article....this is the first thing in my news feed and I've had too much coffee.
9 | Mickey Burrøw | 23 | 10154755913156336_10154755961406336 | Back in the 70s and 80s the big scare was razors in apples. I guess it would be hard to shove a Gillette Mach 3 disposable into a fun size.
10 | Roxanne Carrell Hall | 9 | 10154755913156336_10154755990881336 | I think the days of knocking on a stranger's door and getting candy are quickly coming to an end. There are too many other halloween events for kids to participate in ... schools, churches, local trunk and treats and tons of other places.
11 | Johnathan Mahoney | 9 | 10154755913156336_10154755986836336 | Why are these parents not taking their child's over-the-counter medicines to a local chemist to verify poisions haven't been added, does nobody remember the worker tampering with Tylenol in the early 80s? That KILLED people, I don't recall these 'check your candy' stories reporting injuries in the past years... yet parents will flip out and have this stuff xrayed, and dissected; but none of you 'catious' parents think about testing ANYTHING else, at least nothing else but Halloween candy. I bet you don't do it for Christmas candy or easter candy or birthday pinata candy do you??I'm just sick of these stupid seasonal paranoia 'Your kids are at risk' kind of stories.
12 | Frank Sullivan | 8 | 10154755913156336_10154755994246336 | Listen folks, I understand the fears, wanting safety for your children is paramount! Next Halloween, take a magnet with you. Strong 💪 enough to detect metal objects in a thick candy 🍭 bar. After each visit, switch it around in the bag 💼. If there is metal detected at this house 🏡 and not the prior house 🏡, bingo!Now, don't be a hero and confront the giver, contact the police 🚨, let THEM do it. Enjoy 😊 Halloween 👻 WITH your kids, keep them safe. I grew up in Edwardsburg, Michigan, from east to west, lower Michigan is a farming belt. Good 😊 folks, but, DON'T let a few sick 😷 individuals ruin what can be a fun evening for kids.
13 | Leslie Howard Lubke | 8 | 10154755913156336_10154755939841336 | still doing this after all these years, my parents started check for needles and such in the 1960's. I checked my son's in the 1980's. Keep checking, we have too to keep us safe from the crazies.
14 | Robin Hensley Smoot | 8 | 10154755913156336_10154755969996336 | Oh for crying out loud! I have been hearing of this since I was a kid back in the 70s, and every year parents "find" needles, nails razor blades etc in their kids candy, if this were actually true then aren't parents playing a form of Russian Roulette by taking them Trick or Treating?!  Might be some parents are looking for attention, ever thought about that?
15 | Joyce Menzel | 3 | 10154755913156336_10154755981496336 | What is going on with our country?  How can anyone try and hurt our children?  They are kids. They are innocent and don't deserve that. Our country has turned so evil because God has been taken out of everything. We better fall on our knees and pray that God hasn't forsaken us.
16 | Johnathan Guest | 1 | 10154755913156336_1863638147201520 | I dispose of all my sons candy that is twist wrapped!!! 10 years I've been looking for that X-tacy candy that been going around and sad to say is none!!! All I ever get off it is an upset stomach!!!  P.S. I hope this dude just got off work cause his finger nails contaminated the candy right out the wrapper!!! Clean your finger nails and hands before handling your kids candy, PLEASE!!!!!!
17 | Linda Frazier | 0 | 10154755913156336_1212295925517853 | They use to be able to get candy x-rays  for fee years ago. Are we as parents going to go after that route again. Although now I don't think they'll even let anybody extra candy because the health care prices have risen so high because of Obamacare
18 | Robert Hill | 4 | 10154755913156336_10154755947016336 | Metal detecting is a great hobby and a good way to check for nails, needles, bottle caps and pull tabs. I find them all the time ... in the dirt.
19 | Stephanie Ann Fischer | 0 | 10154755913156336_1212295418851237 | I remember the ER opening up the X-ray department in the 80's for our parents on Halloween night. We'd go get our bag X-rayed before going home. Free of charge. Unfortunate this isn't a new thing.
20 | Donald Brockhaus | 0 | 10154755913156336_10154756022801336 | I didn't know you could even still buy Mars Bars.  I used to love them but haven't seen them in years.  But anyone who would do this to hurt kids is one sick puppy.
21 | Cheryl Moore | 0 | 10154755913156336_10154756050161336 | For the parents who are really concerned about this issue and are so sure that it's real, there's place here (Velocity care) that will x-ray your child's candy, they'll even let the kids have the x-ray of thier candy, all for free! Now with that said, they did stop doing it last night it was just through Nov. 1st, but they advertised it a few days up to Halloween. So there are places that do things if you want to be safe about it. But that just means next year they'll be saying heroine was injected into a tootsie roll for a creamy center. The rumors spread so easily, don't let false accusations kill the one time a year the kids get to go have a good time....that will just make Halloween an adult's only holiday for us to have drinks while the kids go to bed bored.
22 | Danielle Warren Smith | 0 | 10154755913156336_10154756110551336 | Jd Bales ...these stories are most likely true...when I was little someone put a sewing needle in my pumpkin shaped candy corn...check your kids candy people...I grew up in a small town
23 | Zoey Clare | 1 | 10154755913156336_10154756153246336 | Not saying this didn't really happen, however.... there always seems to be 1 or 2 parents who find "things" in their kids' candy yet nobody else who collected candy from the same area had any candy tampered with. There definitely are crazy people out there but one would think they would tamper with more than one piece of candy. I think I'd be checking the parents tool shed. Everyone is looking for their 15 min these days.
24 | Brianna Taylor | 0 | 10154755913156336_1863673687197966 | When I lived in Cleveland in the early '90s, we would go trick-or-treating, and when we were finished, we'd go to the fire station and have it all run through a metal detector and passed by the drug-sniffing K9s. And yes, there were needles and razor blades and drugs and such put in candy by crazy people back then too. Witnessed it myself with some of the candy I'd been given. Anyway, the fire station would host a really fun Halloween party for families to engage in while the treats were inspected for safety. I thought it was really cool that they did that to ensure safety!
25 | Jon Handel | 0 | 10154755913156336_1863662757199059 | Can Halloween just go away already? It is, no doubt, the most worthless "holiday" of the year. Stop and think about it. Candy? Why? Costumes and props? Why? Nothing is being celebrated. You're clinging to a secular celebration with pagan roots and glorifying demonic spirits while risking your kids' safety. Dumb. Dangerous.

1 | Estela Reyna | 737 | 10154755813296336_10154755819831336 | It's out of control because of the perpetuated hate by this corrupt administration and the Liberal MSM!! They are the ones who put these officers in danger. They glorify thugs and vilify officers. It's disgusting. Trump won't let our officers be treated this way! Trump/Pence 2016!
2 | Josh Brown | 227 | 10154755813296336_10154755822781336 | The Powers are not gonna step up, Hussein and Soros orchestrated this whole war on cops and the BLM and everyone fell right where they wanted with this one.
3 | Frank Otto | 94 | 10154755813296336_10154755836921336 | Trump will restore law and order! Obama whines about gun control but approved early prison release of criminals that had drug convictions as well as gun charges!

You want a globalist Hillary NWO where you lose your rights, then vote for Hillary and see where it gets you. Nationalism is key, with a twist of globalism do the math.
8 | Alec Gormley | 17 | 10154755813296336_10154755858376336 | Obama pardoning terrorists setting them free to act again, it is all part of the crumbling glass house built by liberals on shaky ground. let liberals take the blame, after Hillary gets done they will all covert to The GOP. LOL
9 | Aaron Bordsen | 6 | 10154755813296336_10154755957191336 | My condolences to the families of these officers this was a horrible event but I'm just not buying it days before the election when people are going to go out and vote only to have their opinions swayed by the convenient deaths of two officers what shakes the opinion of the people in the midwest the most We the People especially here in the state of Iowa will never Bow Down to a tyrant Government  and become we the sheeple you can fool some of the people some of the time but you cannot fool all of the people all of the time so now we see the light we will stand up for our second amendment right!!!

12 | Kat Hawthorne | 8 | 10154755813296336_10154755912341336 | Disgusting!!! This has become the norm rather than the exception. We are becoming numb to the lawlessness we live in now… This news no longer makes me sad. It makes me ANGRY and resentful to our leadership that has done nothing to support our men and women in blue… God Bless their grieving families. And may God give us strength to never give up and to keep fighting for what is right!
13 | Tom Donaldson | 8 | 10154755813296336_10154755849431336 | They still don't get it... We chose Donald Trump as our candidate because we are pissed off beyond belief.. If they try to shut Hillary Clinton down our throats we will never accept her as president.. She is a criminal and she is running for the office illegally..

15 | Joana Joana | 4 | 10154755813296336_10154755916841336 | Horrendous and no one stands up for our law enforcement, but then everyone calls them when they have the slightest problem. We need people in office that will give our Blue Lives the respect and attention that they deserve.

What a load of crap!!!
18 | Mark Tercsak | 3 | 10154755813296336_10154755917131336 | It is my belief that these Radical Bolshevik Scumbags do not want a secure Border nor are they concerned about your safety or that of your family, Illegal Immigration is only a small part of it, the other part is the drugs coming across the border, they want people to become addicted, because; when you become addicted too drugs you become dependent upon them and the services they provide. They want strife, they want you and I too live in fear of our very lives, you see we become dependent upon them yet again. they hope ISIS and Al~Qaeda operatives and the Muslim Jihad do in fact infiltrate our country get caught planning attacks or even carrying out attacks so that you and I surrender our Liberty's freely to them Demorats and Repuke~Republicans, The Demorats are the Party of Slavery!

Obama I think you should stop campaign for your little clone and start thinking of a way to get out of the presidency.
20 | Peggy Hillhouse | 3 | 10154755813296336_10154755882881336 | Obama and the left wings have split this country in 4 ways. With Latinos, whites, blacks, and others .Before Obama came in office we did not have all of the murders we are having. He hates Law Enforcement. If he didn't, he would go on TV an announce about being punishment for killing or talk to people of the USA about stop killing.
21 | Jeffrey Jazz Shuford | 7 | 10154755813296336_10154755957246336 | 101 police officers were killed when Ronald Reagan was president. George H. W. bush 90, Bill Clinton 81, George Bush 72, Barack Obama 62. Don't be a media mind controlled idiot. Focus on facts. There is no assault or war on law enforcement.
22 | Brenda Weaver | 4 | 10154755813296336_10154755872566336 | I can't believe it has come to the point that we law abiding citizens have to protect our law enforcement officers from criminals.  Stand up people. These officers are precious to their family's. They need everyone to report anything and everything that we see or hear     May God receive them into his arms as they are the best of us.
23 | Frankie Oppedisano | 0 | 10154755813296336_931210707016352 | This is why we need to elect Trump as president. This needs to be handled.

24 | John Bliss | 2 | 10154755813296336_10154755926556336 | When are you going to wake up America???? Obama and Hillary court these terrorist organizations for votes!!! The foster and fabricate racism for votes!!!! Hillary will bring more of this senseless violence on innocent Americans!
25 | Enigo Montoya | 1 | 10154755813296336_10154755929256336 | Liberals are all about "Facts" when they support their ideology but they totally ignore them when they are contrary to whatever narrative they have chosen to set. All African Americans should visit the DOJ and FBI sites that show violent crime stats by race..then maybe they will understand why out of millions of arrests sometimes suspects are shot dead...

3 | Rod Drake | 214 | 10154755675501336_10154755683861336 | And just think NOT one BLM person has killed a cop but people label them a terrorist organization....I don't give a sh%t about BLM but I just find that strange
4 | Josh Sanders | 256 | 10154755675501336_10154755678761336 | God bless the two great souls who were killed....this happens far too often under obama.... however I did expect it...... Now clinton and democrats can breath a sigh of relief knowing the crooked cnn, msnbc, and abc networks will be covering the ambush instead of her scandles.....very conviniant this happens now no?

23 | Jacqueline Rundstrom Dolan | 5 | 10154755675501336_1634115996885515 | False flag or just another liberal killing of police officers to divert us from Clinton's criminal activity. This has to stop, our police keep us safe Vote Trump, make America safe again.

This is so sad this is what these right- wing zealot haters have brought our country to, it is a sad day when anyone loses their life in such a senseless way, but because of all the hate generated by all these right- wing hate groups in America everything is viewed thru the lens of race in America. If the shooter was an African-American Iam sure this would have been dragged into The Presidential race, my best guess it will be barely mentioned now.

Days before the presidential election, the FBI released an archive of documents from a long-closed investigation into President Bill Clinton's 2001 presidential pardon of a fugitive financier.

1 | Wessley Newton | 3657 | 10154755651111336_10154755656211336 | LMAO Trump has literally in a year taken down the entire United States government and the mainstream media, we still trust none of you but watching you squirm and refuse to admit defeat is priceless
2 | Syed Hassan Rizvi | 2473 | 10154755651111336_10154755652301336 | Michelle Obama said if Donald Trump is elected: "We're telling our sons it's okay to humiliate women. We're telling our daughters this is how they deserve to be treated.".... that's funny. So does that mean that if Hillary Clinton is elected, we are teaching our sons & daughters that it's ok to murder, lie, cover up, be corrupt, demean women, use racial slurs, and stay with a spouse that openly rapes women & cheats on you?
3 | Pieter van Schlaraffenland | 879 | 10154755651111336_10154755657131336 | I can't understand why are some of you guys so blind. Clinton is not only corrupt, she is also  treat for the world's peace and American safety. She destroyed countries like Yugoslavia, Iraq, Libya etc. If someone think that was a right choice, just look at them before and after Clinton's democracy. I don't even know how is she available to run for president after all that things. But the worst is that over 40% of Americans support her?!? How is that even possible? America, what is wrong with you? You need to be an example. I hope that she is not going to win because that would be legalising of the crime. She lied and she is running for president? That's so insane. She's even under a FBI investigation, she deleted over 30k emails. Well only you, the american people, have the power to change things. Make your country great again.
4 | Mike Schumacher | 561 | 10154755651111336_10154755674441336 | Most disturbing part of article is where Earnst was boarding Air Force One with Obama for Hillary campaign rally in Columbus! Why are we the taxpayers paying for Obama to break the law at 200 k an hour to try to elect a criminal that will destroy America?
5 | Tonya Waddell Woods | 351 | 10154755651111336_10154755663221336 | "Last night a friend claimed that Donald Trump wouldn’t make a good president; he is brash, he is racist, he is a loudmouth; you know the normal things people learn to recite after being programmed by television news. The one I loved was that, “Trump is arrogant.” My friend questioned if one man could make “that much difference in the world today.” To my friend's credit, she was respectful enough to let me respond when she asked, “Really, what has Trump done?”I said, “In June of last year, Trump entered the race for president. In just a little over a year, Trump has single handedly defeated the Republican party. He did so thoroughly. In fact, he did so in such a resounding way that the Republican Party now suffers from an identity crisis. He literally dismantled the party. Trump even dismantled and dismissed the brand and value of the Bush family.Trump has Obama petrified that Trump will dismiss programs that weren’t properly installed using proper law.Trump has single handedly debunked and disemboweled any value of news media as we knew it—news now suffering from an all-time level of distrust and disrespect.Trump has leaders from all over the world talking about him, whether good or bad. Trust me, powerful men who have been president before weren’t liked by the global community. I doubt Mikhail Gorbachev liked Reagan when Reagan said, "Tear down that wall."Trump has expressly disclosed the fraud perpetrated on the American public by Hillary Clinton. He has, quite literally, brought Hillary to her knees—if you believe that nervous tension and disorders offer physical side effects and damage.Trump has unified the silent majority in a way that should be patently frightening to “liberals.”As the press accuses Trump of being a house of cards, Trump has proven the press is the real house of cards. He has whipped up the entire establishment into pure panic. Trump has exposed them for who they are and worse, what they are. George Clooney was right when he said Trump draws live news coverage of his podium that he’s not yet approached. Thanks, George, you were perfectly correct.What we see as headline news today are actually the last bubbles from the ship that is now sunk—meaning the standard news media, as a propaganda machine, has been exposed. They have no more value.In the same way Trump asked the African-American community this question, I asked my friend, ”At this point, what do you have to lose?” We have mass cop shootings, riots in our streets, ambushed cops, double digit inflation, bombs blowing up in our cities, targeted police, #BLM, a skyrocketing jobless rate, no economic growth, privately owned land being seized by the federal government, the worst racial tension in my lifetime, no God in schools, more abortions than ever, illegal aliens pouring into our country, sick veterans receiving no care, and a debt that doubled in seven years to $19 trillion. Are you really happy with the condition of the current system?One man has done all of this in one year—one guy, and on his own dime. And with everything I’ve written above, you believe Trump hasn't done anything? You claim that you are afraid of Donald Trump? No wonder we’re in trouble. You can say that Trump is a lousy presidential candidate. That’s your right. Just don’t ever say he’s not effective.That Megan Kelly, FOX News, CNN, MSNBC, Washington Post, Rachel Maddow, the Huffington Post, the New York Times, Raleigh’s News and Observer, the AP, Don Lemon, Jake Tapper, and many more, failed to implement their collectively orchestrated lie on the American people against Trump, is actually a massive testament to Trump. The press colluded pure propaganda to accomplish his demise … and they have collectively failed and miserably.Here's just one example of how badly America is injured right now. There are high school football players on their knees during the national anthem simply because the press used as propaganda to program those kids to do that very thing. But, these kids are mimicking NFL stars the same way the same kids chooses which brand of football shoe to purchase—they're overtly brain-washed to do that very thing.Now, we have a generation of children who hate America.America’s problem isn’t that little children are on their knee in collective disrespect of America. Our problem is that America is on her knee from collective disrespect by Americans.You can disrespect America all you want. But, it’s high-time you respect the silent majority. Because they’re not simply the “silent majority” as you’ve been trained to believe when Hillary calls them “deplorables.” The fact is, they are simply the majority. And now they're no longer silent either. Donald Trump changed all of that, single-handedly and within one year."

14 | Rob Holian | 28 | 10154755651111336_10154755701676336 | Again:For all you idiot Clinton supporters,How quickly we forget!  If you’re over 35, take a walk with me down memory lane—you won’t believe what you have forgotten.  If you’re under 35, read on—I promise you that you will be amazed at what you missed!   (By the way, sadly, this isn’t a joke.   I wish it was.)REMEMBER WHEN BILL CLINTON WAS PRESIDENT?(January 20, 1993 to January 20, 2001—two terms)When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over an attempt to reform health care. Her proposed plan was so bad that many Democrats came up with competing plans of their own in protest, and in spite of threats and intimidation, on September 26, 1994, the “Hillarycare” bill was declared dead.This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million for studies, promotion, and other efforts.Then, President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general.  Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood—both were forced to withdraw their names from consideration.  Next, she chose Janet Reno, which husband Bill described as "my worst mistake."  (Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.)Husband Bill also allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission—Lani Guanier was her selection. After considerable backlash from prominent Democratic senators concerning Ms. Guanier's radical views, Bill Clinton withdrew her name from nomination, stating that she did not represents the civil rights views that he had championed during his campaign.However, apparently a slow learner, husband Bill continued to allow Hillary to make more recommendations. She chose former law partners, Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department. Her selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kennedy was forced to resign.  (Is anyone wondering yet what her Supreme Court Justice appointments would be like?)Many younger voters will have no knowledge of "Travelgate," the first major ethics controversy during Bill’s presidency.Hillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend, Harry Thompson—but the White House Travel Office refused to comply. She trumped up allegations of financial mismanagement and reported seven long-time White House employees to the FBI.  This ruined their reputations, got them fired, and caused a thirty-six month investigation. Eventually, most of the employees were reinstated and Clinton associates were forced out of the travel office. Only one White House employee, Billy Dale, was charged with a crime—the enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds;  a jury acquitted him in less than two hours.Still not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House Security.  When Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies (Filegate) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff, suddenly Hillary and the President denied even knowing Livingstone, and of course, denied knowledge of drug use in the White House.Following this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents.Next, when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by Bill Clinton, Hillary was put in charge of the "bimbo eruption" and scandal defense. Let’s look at some of her more notable decisions in this regard . . . She urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation, they settled with Ms. Jones.  She refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor.  After $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr's investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs.  Hillary's devious game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for 'lying under oath' to a grand jury, followed by his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives.  Hillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, "I do not recall," "I have no recollection," and "I don't know" a total of 56 times while under oath.   (Sound familiar?)  After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had "mistakenly thought was hers."So you see, the email scandal and all of her malfeasance regarding the handling of Top Secret information, not to mention the "pay to play" schemes of the Clinton Foundation, are nothing new.  Hillary’s entire political career has been nothing but a web of lies, corruption and destruction in her quest for power.Is anyone else ready to say, “Enough is enough!”?But unfortunately, I’m sure her loyal fans will say, "What difference does it make?"

18 | Jessica Savaya | 7 | 10154755651111336_1025154507596867 | So Hillary is upset that the FBI dumped this on her just days before the election. My question for her now is, how does it feel to be aborted just days before your delivery? #evil #karma

21 | Laina Poleman | 19 | 10154755651111336_10154755691591336 | I wonder if any of this is true. More information about what I received about Clinton's emails.Clinton did not know that her chief adviser Huma used her husband's computer to back up all emails. She had done this a long time ago, and she probably forgot about THAT setting of backup. For Weiner's computer.Now the FBI goes to Weiner's computer to check his emails in his sex case, and they stumble on this file with all the backed up emails.Could the FBI keep quiet about this finding? No. Whichever way they would have decided, the Republicans would have cried 'murder', if it was known that they had the missing emails, yet did not say so. They had to come clean and announce it.Why is Russia so interested in keeping Assad in power?I have asked many influential people and they did not have an answer,Yesterday I received the answer.President Obama and Clinton were planning to build an oil pipeline from Turkey to Qatar. They were going to make a 'killing' on this deal. Literally billions of dollars. Now this is where the snag popped up. Assad did not like the pipeline passing through Syria (not sure if he was not offered enough to like it or any other reason for him being against it). The deal was stuck.The solution was to get rid of Assad and so Obama and Clinton decided to start an Arab spring in Syria, as that was the trend in the rest of the Arab world at that time. the USA encouraged rebels to take up arms and started a revolution to get rid of Assad. The plan nearly worked, but Russia cam into the picture as she did not want this deal to go through. So Russia intervened and saved Assad from assured destruction.Now this deal could now also explain the millions of dollars the Qatar has donated over the years to the Clinton foundation.Now Iran is also involved in this deal. She was supposed to benefit greatly from this pipe line as she was going to be one of the main suppliers of this oil that was to be pumped to Qatar. Now we see that Iran has a very big vested interest in our region and stood to make billions annually from it.At the beginning of the year, America, under the orders of Obama, transferred 1.7 billion dollars in CASH to the Iranians. It was made out to be some type of ransom, for the 4 Americans being held there at that time. This seems now to not be the truth. This money was made out to be ransom money, but it was money due to Iran according to the pipe line agreement and this was a cover for this transaction. Money was in reality being stolen by the Clintons and Obama, and used for their personal interests. CRIMINAL.And what about the resulting civil war in the region, that was to topple Assad. hundreds of thousands of people had been killed as a result, and million have been left homeless and refugees. This could be the reason why Clinton wants to allow so many of the Syrian refugees into America.There is more to come, and the information that I am receiving, is now putting many pieces of the puzzle together and the picture is becoming very clear. These people, Obama and the Clintons have destroyed the decent world over greed for themselves. Human lives have not been part of the equation. Money was the prize, and it was going to be got at all costs.Oh and another point was written and agreed on. If Obama was to be charged, Clinton, being President was supposed to grant him a pardon, shortly later.Can you sleep tonight? I certainly cannot, knowing there is the slightest possibility that Clinton could be elected President, and these evil plans and cover-ups could continue.Wikileaks will fill us in on all the information needed, before and I'm sure after the elections. Internal investigations are continuing by them.More to follow.....

He donated to Hillary's senate campaign and to the Clinton foundation after being pardoned from his 55 million dollar tax evasion.

24 | Ron Wilson | 7 | 10154755651111336_10154755692301336 | According to multiple sources, after the NYPD confiscated Anthony Weiner's laptop which was filled with Huma Abedin's emails they continued their search and discovered the property of Hillary Clinton in the form of emails that implicated her and Bill in the most heinous and serious crimes.  An NYPD source just claimed that within the emails on that device, Hillary and Bill are directly implicated ins a MASSIVE child sex/trafficking ring along with their friend, and convicted pedophile, Jeffrey Epstein. According to the source, “…It’s much more vile and serious than classified material on Weiner’s device. The emails DETAIL the trips made by Weiner, Bill and Hillary on their pedophile billionaire friend’s plane, the Lolita Express.” “We’re talking an international child enslavement and sex ring“ These claims were backed up by other NYPD sources as well: Jeff Epstein is a level-3 registered sex offender and the media ignores the fact hat Bill Clinton flew 26 times on Epstein’s private Jet and allegedly visited Epstein’s sex slave island. Now that Hillary has also been directly implicated, the media cannot ignore this any longer! The NYPD source makes specific claims about her involvement. He says, “Hillary has a well documented predilection for underage girls, and Mr. Weiner could not bear to see those details deleted.” http://redstatewatcher.com/article.asp?id=46461

6 | John Anderson | 10 | 10154753464871336_10154755599611336 | "Last night a friend claimed that Donald Trump wouldn’t make a good president; he is brash, he is racist, he is a loudmouth; you know the normal things people learn to recite after being programmed by television news. The one I loved was that, “Trump is arrogant.” My friend questioned if one man could make “that much difference in the world today.” To my friend's credit, she was respectful enough to let me respond when she asked, “Really, what has Trump done?”I said, “In June of last year, Trump entered the race for president. In just a little over a year, Trump has single handedly defeated the Republican party. He did so thoroughly. In fact, he did so in such a resounding way that the Republican Party now suffers from an identity crisis. He literally dismantled the party. Trump even dismantled and dismissed the brand and value of the Bush family.Trump has Obama petrified that Trump will dismiss programs that weren’t properly installed using proper law.Trump has single handedly debunked and disemboweled any value of news media as we knew it—news now suffering from an all-time level of distrust and disrespect.Trump has leaders from all over the world talking about him, whether good or bad. Trust me, powerful men who have been president before weren’t liked by the global community. I doubt Mikhail Gorbachev liked Reagan when Reagan said, "Tear down that wall."Trump has expressly disclosed the fraud perpetrated on the American public by Hillary Clinton. He has, quite literally, brought Hillary to her knees—if you believe that nervous tension and disorders offer physical side effects and damage.Trump has unified the silent majority in a way that should be patently frightening to “liberals.”As the press accuses Trump of being a house of cards, Trump has proven the press is the real house of cards. He has whipped up the entire establishment into pure panic. Trump has exposed them for who they are and worse, what they are. George Clooney was right when he said Trump draws live news coverage of his podium that he’s not yet approached. Thanks, George, you were perfectly correct.What we see as headline news today are actually the last bubbles from the ship that is now sunk—meaning the standard news media, as a propaganda machine, has been exposed. They have no more value.In the same way Trump asked the African-American community this question, I asked my friend, ”At this point, what do you have to lose?” We have mass cop shootings, riots in our streets, ambushed cops, double digit inflation, bombs blowing up in our cities, targeted police, #BLM, a skyrocketing jobless rate, no economic growth, privately owned land being seized by the federal government, the worst racial tension in my lifetime, no God in schools, more abortions than ever, illegal aliens pouring into our country, sick veterans receiving no care, and a debt that doubled in seven years to $19 trillion.

13 | Michael R Anderson | 3 | 10154753464871336_10154755606501336 | HEADLINES November 9th. Hillary loses election by a landslide. Hillary and press blame FBI Director Comey’s letter to congress.Let me tell you a little story and you decide it’s plausibility. So, a few months ago, FBI Director Comey tells congress he will not be seeking charges against Hillary. Why because he is a pro-Hillary fan and friend of the Clinton’s, while most Americans will admit, Hillary broke the law.A very large number of Americans believe the main-stream media is fixed behind Hillary. They feel the press are even willing to artificially inflate the numbers in the polls so more and more people will get behind her and to help continue the mega-billionaires to keep the money rolling in.In fact, if you compare the photos of Trump’s and Hillary’s rally’s, it is obvious Trump is filling football stadiums and Hillary is having a hard time filling high school gyms. One event was cancelled because only about 30 people showed up. What that means, is that Trump is winning by a landslide. Hillary knows she is losing. The press knows she is losing.What’s going to happen to the media and Hillary, if Trump does win by a land slide. It will be proof the media was lying by over inflating Hillary’s numbers. How can Hillary save face that mainstream America thinks she’s crooked and lost the election by a landslide? Moreover, how can the crooked media avoid being caught in their massive lies? Let’s go back to Comey for a moment. Eleven days before the election, Comey writes a letter to congress fully knowing the Republicans will leak it to the press, stating he wants to advise congress of this new twist in the email investigation against Hillary.Wow, that letter seems to have made the Democrats very mad as they believe the letter to likely be the single biggest reason Hillary lost the election, right? Well, maybe not. I say it’s all planned and here’s why I think that way:If Hillary loses, that makes her look bad and a mega-insult to her ego as well as to the Democratic party. It also proves the media was lying in polls showing Hillary was so far ahead of Trump.So, I have to ask, why did a pro-Hillary FBI Director release such a damaging letter? Think about it… Hillary loses the election by a landslide. Comey is actually helping Hillary with a plausible excuse for losing. Hillary can blame that letter from Comey to congress instead of facing the facts that America is tired of the direction the Democrats have taken our country.Wait for it…. What about the lying press? Well, if Hillary loses and loses big, the press too can point to Comey’s letter deflecting any thoughts of numbers rigging.In the Democratic party, Comey is a hero. Took one for the team. I’m confident there will be a place for Comey in the Clinton foundation somewhere.In the end, a Hillary loss will be a winner for both the Democrats and the press and American’s as a whole.

It's Americans 🇺🇸VS globalistsA socialist state by ObamaHillary to include George Soros agenda for America: Some are 8 levels of control that must be obtained before you are able to create a social state.The first is the most important.1) Healthcare — Control healthcare and you control the people (Obamacare ring a bell)2) Poverty — Increase the Poverty level as high as possible, poor people are easier to control and will not fight back if you are providing everything for them to live.3) Debt — Increase the debt to an unsustainable level. That way you are able to increase taxes, and this will produce more poverty.4) Gun Control — Remove the ability to defend themselves from the Government. That way you are able to create a police state.5) Welfare — Take control of every aspect of their lives (Food, Housing, and Income).6) Education — Take control of what people read and listen to — take control of what children learn in school.7) Religion — Remove the belief in the God from the Government and schools.8) Class Warfare — Divide the people into the wealthy and the poor. This will cause more discontent and it will be easier to take (Tax) the wealthy with the support of the poor.Now, think ...Does any of this sound like what is happening to the United States?🇺🇸 Let's Go!🇺🇸
18 | Angie Phifer | 0 | 10154753464871336_10154756508281336 | With Mr.Pence behind Trump, they will clean out the corruption in Washington. Killary and George Soros are evil people and with his money and power, she has bought her way out,used others for cover,killed 4 men that died a painful,horrible death and is letting the ones below her that the fall that is meant for her. I voted Trump!!
19 | Louis Barraco | 3 | 10154753464871336_10154755695191336 | This came from the Advocate (our local paper) and I am sharing it because it is exactly how most of us feel about Trump.  The Media just doesn't get it....they can't believe that people are so angry that they can no longer be manipulated!Millions of trump supporters feel this way about Donald J. Trump....."We don't care if the guy swears... or how many times he's been married...or who he voted for, or what his income tax return shows. We want the problems fixed. Yes he's an egomaniac, but we don't care. We know he's not a racist, or bad to women, or all the other things the liberal media is trying to label him with. We know he's raised a good family, and that says a lot about him.The country is a mess because politicians suck, the Republican Party is two faced & gutless, and illegals are everywhere and Muslims are openly trying to hurt this country and make the civilized world adjust to them. We want it all fixed!We don't care that Trump is crude, we don't care that he has changed positions, we don't care that he fights with Megan Kelly, Rosie O'Donnell, and so many of the elected establishment. We don't care that Rubio, Ryan, the Bush's, and so many other top old and new Republicans refuse to endorse him for their own selfish reasons, and we know what they are. We don't care that he doesn't know the name of some Muslim terrorists, we don't care that he tried some businesses that didn't work out.This country is weak, bankrupt, our enemies are making fun of us, we are being invaded by illegals, we are becoming a nation of victims, where every Tom, Ricardo and Hasid is a special group with special rights to a point where we don't even recognize the country we were born and raised in, AND WE JUST WANT IT FIXED. And TRUMP is the only guy who seems to understand what the people want.We're sick of politicians, sick of the Democratic and Republican Party. We're angry about the Iran deal, the budget, treatment of Israel, military weakness, lobbyists, special interests, overpaid politicians with their self serving bills and back room deals, trade deals, loss of jobs, manipulated economic numbers, businesses fleeing, and even the phoney pay for play Clinton Foundation.Americans are no longer going to be fooled, and the movement is out to change the direction we're taking. Trump may not be a saint, but he doesn't have lobbyist money holding him, he doesn't have political correctness restraining him, and all you know is that he has been very successful, a good negotiator, he has built a lot of things, he's flexible, and he's also not a politician. And he says he'll fix it. And we believe him because he is too much of an egotist to be proven wrong or looked at and called a liar.Public service has become elected greed. This may be our only chance to have a non-politician, despite his flaws, try and correct the mess, at least for 4 years. We must take the shot, because the consequences of putting Hillary Clinton in office are frightening. There is a tidal wave happening, and its going to overcome much of what's happened to this country."
20 | Sue Fox | 1 | 10154753464871336_10154755978511336 | These guys are showing us what we need to do. While Crooked HIllary  says Trump isn't fit to be president. Well it appears to me it is the other way around. Oh you blinded Clinton followers could put her in the White House, but she will only be Impeached liked her pathetic husband was. Then you would have stuck us with her yes man as our president. I am listening to what Pence and Trump are saying. We need this change.

1 | Cody Carter | 2213 | 10154755402241336_10154755404891336 | With Crooked Hillary as president.. expect to see many police killings and her apologizing for how bad our police are... On the other hand Trump will respect the police, restore law and order... and Drain The Swamp of Washington corruption
2 | Emily Ann Holt | 1809 | 10154755402241336_10154755408121336 | I personally blame Hillary, Obama, Lynch, and BLM for all of these police shootings/ambushes/deaths. They created this environment to allow this to happen and it makes me so angry to think about. This is just one of the many reasons I am voting for Trump.
3 | Ingrid Springer | 899 | 10154755402241336_10154755416851336 | Our country needs to bring the death penalty for all cop killers back - and to be carried out within a year after conviction. No such thing as being on death row for 20 years. And we need politicians who respect police.
4 | Arthur C Elling | 382 | 10154755402241336_10154755415951336 | When you have people like Obama and Clinton who demonize police officers, things like this are going to happen! Their is blood on their hands and others who support their anti cop rhetoric!
5 | Angel Jeremitha | 335 | 10154755402241336_10154755405461336 | Can you all stop with Hillary and Trump craps.The world doesn't revolve around the election and your idiotic candidates. 2 souls just gone. Be thankful for their service and have some respect.
6 | Guy D Rodriguez | 223 | 10154755402241336_10154755407831336 | It's unfortunate Iowa is not a death penalty State. I guess they will be sentenced to detention. Prayers for the families of the officers. BACK THE BLUE
7 | Seán Herlihy | 205 | 10154755402241336_10154755408266336 | Pipeline explodes and two cops murdered because they had to distract everyone from Killarys criminal activities....well we won't be distracted.TRUMP2016
8 | Keith E Holder | 104 | 10154755402241336_10154755418531336 | How many does this make it now? Under Obama I can't even count that high. Enough people we can't have four more years of Hillary Clinton and her anti police policies like Obama. Yea are there bad cops absolutely there are. But for cops to be executed like they have been is enough.
9 | Jay Boggs | 160 | 10154755402241336_10154755404701336 | Thank you Obama... Does anybody really think Hillary will make any attempts to change this?
10 | Caryn Gildea | 107 | 10154755402241336_10154755417271336 | Hillary says the police need to be retrained! There will be more of this if Hillary is elected! Obama should be impeached for not backing our men and women that put their lives on the line to protect us!
11 | Lynne Krantz | 73 | 10154755402241336_10154755437071336 | I am absolutely sick to my stomach right now – this happened just down the road from my home😣  May God bless our law enforcement officers💙🙏🏻
12 | Mamie Jones | 56 | 10154755402241336_1797296233845673 | Here in Iowa, we respect our police, consider them part of a bigger family - laugh with them and grieve with them. This type of violence has never touched our community and we are all in shock. Please pray for these officers and their families.
13 | Shelly Creson Whiteing | 30 | 10154755402241336_10154755485336336 | What absolutely horrible news to see first thing this morning. This is so sad -- this is not supposed to happen in our State, our Cities. May God be with these officers loved ones today and in the coming days. And, even more importantly may the Good Lord put a hedge of protection around all of our Law Enforcement today and forever. I pray that the coward who did this horrible deed be found and punished to the full extent of the law. I so wish Iowa had the death penalty for the cowards like this.
14 | Tamara Bolton | 17 | 10154755402241336_1172633216162535 | I'm confused how does Obama, and #BLACKLIVESMATTER get the blame for another pink person killing the police??? 90% of the time when police are murdered its done by pink ppl yet you blame everyone else except pink people. Sounds like Amerikkka to me
15 | Molly Malone | 25 | 10154755402241336_10154755426476336 | Suspect is white, not black, by the way. And he's just a coward who hates cops. Probably has nothing to do with political parties. He just decided to remove someone from earth through his own awful choices. And he probably will end up dead in the next few hours.
16 | Kevin Brannon | 33 | 10154755402241336_10154755481076336 | I wonder if Obama will have a press conference and announce that if he had a son, his son would look like these police officers. I wonder if Obama is going to hold a press conference and ask everyone not to jump to conclusions if the killer ends up having a Muslim sounding name. I wonder is Obama will take time away from the golf course to pay respect to these dead officers....
17 | Brandi Woodson | 28 | 10154755402241336_10154755418926336 | Obviously I missed a speech or something. How is it that so many people believe Trump is Superman,  how exactly is it that he will protect and save every person from harm. How is he going to stop crime and violence??? 🤔🤔 somebody please enlighten me, because I must of missed it
18 | Sandy Kay Wagner | 15 | 10154755402241336_10154755453146336 | ITS so sad what our world has become... Two more police officers killed early this morning while sitting in their car in Iowa. Children's Holloween candy found with nails, needles, and other objects...This is what's become of our country since Obama has been in office. Terrorist attacks, innocent people killed, Cities destroyed, Illegal immigrants treated better than our Men & women that fight for our country, and our Veterans... Healthcare, Our seniors going without needed care...Etc.  #CrookedHilary would be much worse...She doesn't care about the American people! #VoteTrump to make America safe again.
19 | Julie Boone | 14 | 10154755402241336_10154755426146336 | Oh God have mercy to our nation! I pray for the safety of all the police officers especially this coming election and all the American people who are going to vote.
20 | Peter Oldnall | 16 | 10154755402241336_1797286930513270 | Whomever voted for Barack Obama or is even thinking of voting for Hillary Clinton, the blood of these police officers is on your hands.When Obama declared the the Cambridge police "acted stupidly" he declared open season on the police.He let the world know that the police are fair game.
21 | Mark Fudge | 22 | 10154755402241336_10154755424406336 | Broken ChainWe little knew that morning that God was going to call your name. In life we loved you dearly, in death we do the same. It broke our hearts to lose you, you did not go alone; for part of us went with you the day God called you home. You left us peaceful memories, your love is still our guide, and though we cannot see you, you are always by our side. Our family chain is broken and nothing seems the same, but as God calls us one by one, the chain will link again. - Ron Tranmer
22 | Michelle Hardt | 9 | 10154755402241336_10154755483181336 | Lack of leadership from the top is the result of this. Our president needs to take time out of his campaigning for Hillary and address the crisis we have against our police officers! He has the influence to help stop this atrocity just as he had the influence that created it! One of the worst presidents ever!God bless our men in blue!
23 | Grant Doiron | 9 | 10154755402241336_10154755459011336 | I read all these comments and feel the same yes two officers was killed but people. I can see why others involve politics. It's sad but when all the police killings started taking place was when all the corruption was being aired about Hillary. We got over all that to find out it was pretty quiet for a while. And now it's back on Hillary right before the election. So it makes you wonder if it's just another way she maybe involved to pull the attention off of her. We all know she is capable of making things happen like this. RIP.
24 | Michelle Kaplan | 4 | 10154755402241336_1797290530512910 | Prayers for these offiicers friends and family!  RIP Officers! Thank you for your service! That being said, these animals need to be stopped! And sorry but it is true Hillary and Obama néed to stop bashing the police!!!! They just add fuel to an already large fire!

Explain how middle class and low-income voters can accept this. She has done NOTHING to merit this kind of wealth.
5 | Hannah-Rose Harding Pepe | 224 | 10154753754056336_10154755374376336 | Hillary Clinton is a filthy excuse for a human being. She is as corrupt as they come. She will continue on Obama's path to dismantle the very foundation this country was built on. All in the name of greed and lining her own dirty pockets. God is throwing us a lifeline here people, and his name is Donald Trump. He isn't a perfect person by any means - which one among us really is?- but he is the right man for this arduous task. Grab on to this buoy and hold on tight!

They should have slapped the crap out of him for even trying...his _____would be in his throat....but Hillary Clinton has shamed & threatened Bill's rape victims...(I do not care that Bill isn't running)..they've been trying to be heard for years, & she has blocked them at every turn, until Trump gave them time to speak...Hillary has stood on live television and said that she supports late term abortion...(it's a real thing...look it up) she takes money from the very people that hate Americans, they hate women, the ones that took out the twin towers, & the same ones that think children are ready for sex at age 6...there are many other reasons why we didn't vote for her...these are just a few...
13 | Leonard Wong Chin San | 18 | 10154753754056336_10154755403921336 | Trump all the way! Economics runs countries. Trump's been in economics all his life. That automatically makes him a better candidate. It has been stated that he is untested politically. This is only partly true but it actually works in his favor. We see him campaigning with the common people. That says a lot about his personality. His trip and speech to Mexico hints on his style regards to foreign relations .... firm but tactful. He is someone who will fight for the rights of his citizens/country. He has no political baggage and is free to form a new team to revamp / improve all government sectors. An opportunity to change things for the better
14 | John Anderson | 22 | 10154753754056336_10154755530791336 | "Last night a friend claimed that Donald Trump wouldn’t make a good president; he is brash, he is racist, he is a loudmouth; you know the normal things people learn to recite after being programmed by television news. The one I loved was that, “Trump is arrogant.” My friend questioned if one man could make “that much difference in the world today.” To my friend's credit, she was respectful enough to let me respond when she asked, “Really, what has Trump done?”I said, “In June of last year, Trump entered the race for president. In just a little over a year, Trump has single handedly defeated the Republican party. He did so thoroughly. In fact, he did so in such a resounding way that the Republican Party now suffers from an identity crisis. He literally dismantled the party. Trump even dismantled and dismissed the brand and value of the Bush family.Trump has Obama petrified that Trump will dismiss programs that weren’t properly installed using proper law.Trump has single handedly debunked and disemboweled any value of news media as we knew it—news now suffering from an all-time level of distrust and disrespect.Trump has leaders from all over the world talking about him, whether good or bad. Trust me, powerful men who have been president before weren’t liked by the global community. I doubt Mikhail Gorbachev liked Reagan when Reagan said, "Tear down that wall."Trump has expressly disclosed the fraud perpetrated on the American public by Hillary Clinton. He has, quite literally, brought Hillary to her knees—if you believe that nervous tension and disorders offer physical side effects and damage.Trump has unified the silent majority in a way that should be patently frightening to “liberals.”As the press accuses Trump of being a house of cards, Trump has proven the press is the real house of cards. He has whipped up the entire establishment into pure panic. Trump has exposed them for who they are and worse, what they are. George Clooney was right when he said Trump draws live news coverage of his podium that he’s not yet approached. Thanks, George, you were perfectly correct.What we see as headline news today are actually the last bubbles from the ship that is now sunk—meaning the standard news media, as a propaganda machine, has been exposed. They have no more value.In the same way Trump asked the African-American community this question, I asked my friend, ”At this point, what do you have to lose?” We have mass cop shootings, riots in our streets, ambushed cops, double digit inflation, bombs blowing up in our cities, targeted police, #BLM, a skyrocketing jobless rate, no economic growth, privately owned land being seized by the federal government, the worst racial tension in my lifetime, no God in schools, more abortions than ever, illegal aliens pouring into our country, sick veterans receiving no care, and a debt that doubled in seven years to $19 trillion. Are you really happy with the condition of the current system?One man has done all of this in one year—one guy, and on his own dime. And with everything I’ve written above, you believe Trump hasn't done anything? You claim that you are afraid of Donald Trump? No wonder we’re in trouble. You can say that Trump is a lousy presidential candidate. That’s your right. Just don’t ever say he’s not effective.That Megan Kelly, FOX News, CNN, MSNBC, Washington Post, Rachel Maddow, the Huffington Post, the New York Times, Raleigh’s News and Observer, the AP, Don Lemon, Jake Tapper, and many more, failed to implement their collectively orchestrated lie on the American people against Trump, is actually a massive testament to Trump. The press colluded pure propaganda to accomplish his demise … and they have collectively failed and miserably.Here's just one example of how badly America is injured right now. There are high school football players on their knees during the national anthem simply because the press used as propaganda to program those kids to do that very thing. But, these kids are mimicking NFL stars the same way the same kids chooses which brand of football shoe to purchase—they're overtly brain-washed to do that very thing.Now, we have a generation of children who hate America.America’s problem isn’t that little children are on their knee in collective disrespect of America. Our problem is that America is on her knee from collective disrespect by Americans.You can disrespect America all you want. But, it’s high-time you respect the silent majority. Because they’re not simply the “silent majority” as you’ve been trained to believe when Hillary calls them “deplorables.” The fact is, they are simply the majority. And now they're no longer silent either. Donald Trump changed all of that, single-handedly and within one year."

If we forget GOD, we will be cut off. “The Lord spoke to Moses, saying, "Say to the people of Israel, Any one of the people of Israel or of the strangers who sojourn in Israel who gives any of his children to Molech shall surely be put to death. The people of the land shall stone him with stones. I myself will set my face against that man and will cut him off from among his people, because he has given one of his children to Molech, to make my sanctuary unclean and to profane my holy name. And if the people of the land do at all close their eyes to that man when he gives one of his children to Molech, and do not put him to death, then I will set my face against that man and against his clan and will cut them off from among their people, him and all who follow him in whoring after Molech.”‭‭         Leviticus‬ ‭20:1-5‬GOD WILL NOT BLESS SIN. ...

20 | Pattie Goshtigian | 14 | 10154753754056336_1815874435330478 | I awoke this morning with the actual thought and concern that our country would be in grave danger if Clinton gets elected. One of the biggest reasons is the influx of refugees and the thought of Sharia law being incited and changing the way of life for our children and grandchildren. I really pray that those that haven't yet decided would please consider these two facts along with many other negative reasons. She is a dangerous woman and cannot be trusted with the lives of the people of this country. Nor the babies that will not stand to have a life. I'm praying that people will vote with a conscience and with the mind set that your vote isn't for yourself but your future offspring. Think of the battle that would exist for them and you may not be here to help. How will you feel voting for Clinton? She is going to see that the religious freedom will change when she has the ability to place a person of her choice in the Supreme Court.  Donald Trump may not be the ideal candidate, but he loves the country and the people. He didn't have to do what he's doing.  He said some offensive things, but he hasn't done anything nor will he do anything negative to hurt this country. Please think of the children and their future, born and unborn.

The commander of the California National Guard reportedly cannot locate more than 4,000 of the some 9,700 soldiers involved in the enlistment bonus scandal.

1 | Mike Stevens | 1153 | 10154753574001336_10154755273546336 | I'd be more worried about other IMPROPER PAYMENTS to welfare, illegals and dead people. So lets skip the small stuff.
2 | Bill Morin | 479 | 10154753574001336_10154755274026336 | this story pretty much is making the idiots who are trying to get money back for their mistakes they made..not the Soldier...look really bad. Enough already...does anyone know where any of these missing soldiers are? will you please turn them in? yeah right !!! if anything i'll tell them Thank You and Screw the Treasury Dept and IRS. what a major embaressment to this Country.
3 | Diane Sylvia | 363 | 10154753574001336_10154755284896336 | There are worse scandals in life than giving real soldiers inappropriate bonuses!! Like the Clinton's taking millions from foreign governments in speaking fees!!!!
4 | Clif McGhar | 181 | 10154753574001336_10154755284031336 | So we have to honor our contract with the military but if the military agrees to a contract they don't have to honor it ?
5 | Martha O'Brien | 211 | 10154753574001336_10154755270766336 | The soldiers should not have to pay that back...they signed what was supposed to be a good military contract...& I love our men & women that serve, but that was the military's bad, not theirs!!!
6 | Cassandra Pena | 146 | 10154753574001336_10154755315696336 | This story makes me so angry. These veterans wrote a blank check made payable to "The United States of America," for an amount of "up to and including THEIR LIFE." When you sign this contract, you are required to uphold your end of it, and the government makes sure that you do. Some of these soldiers served multiple tours during their contract. Now the government wants to turn around and void their end of an already completed contract? "Oh we paid you too much for you to put your life on the line and serve your country. Our bad. Now give us our money back." SCREW THAT.
7 | Sandy Harper Waller | 87 | 10154753574001336_10154755352951336 | So odumbo pays billions to iran, illegal aliens, and builds mosques in the middle east but is SCREWING OUR MILITARY BY DEMANDING ENLISTMENT BONUSES BE RETURNED. why hasn't this traitor been hung for treason?
8 | Joe Neltner | 46 | 10154753574001336_10154755402991336 | The headline makes one infer that these former guardsmen are either hiding or didn't exist. After reading the article, one realizes they just moved on after doing their service. I understood the Army was not going to try to collect this money. So which is it?  A bonus given in good faith or what?  Don't ask folks to do something you won't do ; then demand a refund. What a crock of manure.
9 | Ashley Nanny Conklin | 35 | 10154753574001336_10154755332196336 | It's not a scandal like the soldiers were in the wrong. The military were the ones that screwed up! The soldiers deserve every bit of what was GIVEN to them and more! The military is a disgrace for trying to even MAKE the soldiers pay it back. Like they think all the soldiers just set the bonus aside all this time. Putting them on payment plans and so on...Yeah, real pathetic military
10 | Randi Hautala | 22 | 10154753574001336_10154755416206336 | Although some soldiers may have received bonuses they weren't entitled to....I say...keep the money. They probably did more for the country than many members of Congress. Also, knowing how much money the Pentagon wastes on silly trivial things, this is a bargain. It will cost more to track down the missing soldiers than its worth. Keep the money.
11 | Ronald Nordby | 9 | 10154753574001336_10154755433356336 | This is awful. If the government screws up, they shouldn't be allowed to collect on it. The rules regarding bonuses is often complicated and always requires approval. If these forms were approved, its there fault. A system which is so easily abused deserves to be abused. Plain and simple.
12 | Cliff English | 21 | 10154753574001336_10154755302761336 | Doesn't matter if you can find them or not. You paid them and they performed the service end of story. You only prove what fools we have running things. Donald Trump - Mike Pence For America Great Again !!!
13 | Megan Elizabeth Couch | 9 | 10154753574001336_10154755427761336 | They are probably homeless veterans since the govt doesn't bother to take care of most of them after they get home and leave the military. How are they gonna find someone that has no address? They cant. And those people couldn't pay for a place to stay so how would they even begin to pay the govt money they shouldn't b asking for in the first place.
14 | Dan Mott | 12 | 10154753574001336_10154755405246336 | Why is this called a scandal? It should be called an injustice. These men and women do not deserve this and it needs to be fixed and any soldier who has payed any of it back or has legal fees paid out to fight it should be immediately reimbursed!
15 | Frank Mills | 8 | 10154753574001336_10154755372021336 | Leave it, own the mistake and carry on. Idiots. Not for the bonus, but for even trying to recover it, foolish and now everyone knows that they are.
16 | Cody Sipes | 25 | 10154753574001336_10154755324251336 | Take a bonus from those fine men and women but let the welfare queens get away with scamming the system on a daily. We need new leadership for sure
17 | Jason Durandetto | 14 | 10154753574001336_10154755338721336 | So how much government money is being spent on trying to find these soldiers and doing all the legwork to get the money back? Our government is a disgrace!!
18 | Keith E Holder | 4 | 10154753574001336_10154755428986336 | A large part of them could be homeless because of the mental stresses they faced fearing or seeing death everyday like they did fighting for our country. Shame on America for allowing this to happen.
19 | Laura Meeks Jorgensen | 9 | 10154753574001336_10154755455601336 | Check the streets. That's usually where we send our veterans. Just leave them all alone. As a tax payer, I give you permission to allow them to keep the money. They earned it and much more.
20 | Jessica Nottingham Roberts | 3 | 10154753574001336_10154755616696336 | Probably can't be found, due to PTSD or taking there own lives, excuse me I am sad to say such a thing.. these men and women went to war, seeing things we never though could possibly been seen..maybe many moved out of the country for being treated ungreatful, no services..homeless, no health insurance..Hillary losses 6 millions dollars like nothing, why doesn't she has have to pay back..I am not understanding any of this !
21 | Coleen Courtney Mick | 6 | 10154753574001336_10154755320156336 | This seems like government abuse in retaliation toward our military for supporting a candidate other than the current administration. These people did not ask for such monies as incentives the government its self paid it out to them.  Why is it they can pay out billions of dollars in bail out monies to Wall Street banks and other corporations and then some them not pay them bail out monies back but then do this yes it's got be some sort retaliation no doubt.
22 | Lisa Essigmann-Martin | 6 | 10154753574001336_10154755360661336 | Good ! They made good on their end so they shouldn't have to pay it back. Why don't we try and get back from welfare fraud or the $6 million Hillary lost..And not allow a  retirement raise for Obama!! (I think it is illegal for him to propose anyway while in office)...
23 | Brenda Sparks | 9 | 10154753574001336_10154755363866336 | Well, if they served those multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan back then as we know many did under Bush, I bet many of them returned and are wounded in some capacity -- and homeless!We have many homeless vets here in California because the cost of living has skyrocketed and typically vets rely on Social Security which is lower than what a cheap apartment costs here in California.Our vets deserve so much better!Elect Trump, he will shore up social security, provide jobs, and put our loyal veterans first in line where they should be!
24 | Gary Dayze | 9 | 10154753574001336_10154755399626336 | That shows the incompetence that our government continues to display. Obama can put $1.75 Billion in unmarked bills on a plane to Iran, and he can spend $3.6 Million to play golf with Tiger Woods; but he can't pay our brave soldiers what he promised them? Let me tell you, this is one screwed up President.
25 | Reid Mason | 5 | 10154753574001336_10154755561106336 | Really, is there not more underlying problems we could be focused on, like illegals coming into this country, like the criminal Clinton machine, what about Al Sharpton who owes more than 4 million dollars, like the thug BLM. Let's get to work on law and order and prosecute the ones that we know where they are, the important ones and not the ones that have defended us.

10 | Sam Suzanne Roberts | 12 | 10154753443866336_10154755382121336 | Hillary doesn't even put a flag lapel pin on!🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸The attack on freedom and our constitution was alive and well long before my birth...(A speech from 1964)"The profit motive has become outmoded. It must be replaced by the incentives of the welfare state." Or, "Our traditional system of individual freedom is incapable of solving the complex problems of the 20th century." Senator Fullbright has said at Stanford University that the Constitution is outmoded. He referred to the President as "our moral teacher and our leader," and he says he is "hobbled in his task by the restrictions of power imposed on him by this antiquated document." He must "be freed," so that he "can do for us" what he knows "is best." And Senator Clark of Pennsylvania, another articulate spokesman, defines liberalism as "meeting the material needs of the masses through the full power of centralized government." Well, I, for one, resent it when a representative of the people refers to you and me, the free men and women of this country, as "the masses." This is a term we haven't applied to ourselves in America. But beyond that, "the full power of centralized government"—this was the very thing the Founding Fathers sought to minimize. They knew that governments don't control things. A government can't control the economy without controlling people. And they know when a government sets out to do that, it must use force and coercion to achieve its purpose. They also knew, those Founding Fathers, that outside of its legitimate functions, government does nothing as well or as economically as the private sector of the economy. ~ Ronald Reagan
11 | Eddie Ramirez | 18 | 10154753443866336_10154755153891336 | "Dear Republicans, - Author -Meira WainsteinYou remember how this started, right? You got in bed with the ‘I’m mad as hell and I’m not gonna take it anymore’ Tea Party. You saw the Harvard Law Review Editor who just happened to be black and you lost your minds. You called him a Socialist. You said he never read the Constitution. You said he was a Muslim as if that were some slight when Muslims have fought and died for this country right beside citizens of every other religion. It was never enough. You never seemed to run out of the venom you spewed.You played to the fears of white, male America. “He’s coming for your guns!” How many did the Great Gun Grabber actually get? You stared at twenty children slaughtered in Sandy Hook and turned up your palms and said, “This isn’t the time to talk about gun control.”You listened and half-believed the conspiracy theorists who talked about the great conspiracy of Sandy Hook and too many of you accused the parents of being actors. The best of you, who used to care about your country first and your party second, kept silent and eventually began to participate in the madness.You sold your souls because you saw after Romney lost that you weren’t going to be sitting your man in the White House anytime soon. Reince Priebus presented his autopsy of that election. To even be competitive, you have to carry 40% of the Latino vote and 45% of the women’s vote. Let’s not even consider the black vote which Romney lost by more than 90 points! Romney only got 27% of the Latino vote.DID YOU LEARN FROM IT?You certainly swelled your ranks with a fresh infusion of “populist” infantry who had the audacity to say Obama was going to invade Texas in Operation Jade Helm. You said that he was born in Kenya and a secret agent of the Muslim Brotherhood. You were more angry at Hillary than at the murderers at Benghazi. You stood there, silent and complicit as every maniac with a mouthpiece or radio show lied and incited their listeners to hatred and worse.  When your cries of wolf fell on deaf ears, you turned up the volume.The night Obama won, the establishment met in secret and promised to do everything to make him a one term president even if it meant hurting the country. That’s what your partisanship wrought and what did you achieve? You wasted millions in taxpayer money to flog the Benghazi horse and you voted to repeal Obamacare sixty times. While you strained to do anything to make the President look bad, you shut down the government and cost the economy $24 billion. While you played brinksmanship with the full faith and credit of our government, what you really achieved was to convince the vast majority of Americans that you are incapable of governing.This time you went to the natural end of your rope and jumped the shark with Trump costing you stalwart republicans like George Will, Charles Krauthammer, Bill Kristol and any steward of the Nation’s security. You nominated a man for his success in business even as many of his businesses were going bankrupt and are under investigation for fraud. You apparently learned not a thing from the political train wreck that was George W. Bush.But this time is different and you know it now. There is no hiding the fact that white supremacists and the full complement of other racists and xenophobes have embraced your nominee publicly and loudly.  The last Univision poll Jorge Ramos reported had Trump with an 83% disapproval rating among Latino voters. The party that claims to be the defender of “family values” sent dreamers back across the border or deported their parents  so they have to visit them across a fence. Not only have you proven that you care nothing for their lives but your nominee intends to deport eleven million of them."You built this, own it.

They have found something big for them to reopen this investigation. The evidence is over whelming on the Clinton's corruption and criminal activity. I believe the Wikileaks and project Veritas videos have made an impact in exposing the undeniable corruption of Hillary Clinton!!!! #TrumpPence2016LandslideVictory...
13 | Donald Brockhaus | 11 | 10154753443866336_10154755530091336 | While out campaigning yesterday, Donald Trump made a very good speech and laid out a very good plan for repealing and replacing Obamacare. He talked about real issues that Americans are concerned about. What did Hillary talk about ? Bashing Donald Trump. Miss Universe from 20 years ago. She's got nuthin'. She can't run on her own record of 30 years of failure, scandals, and lies. Stupid Democrats...how can they be so gullible as to swallow this utter B.S. ?
14 | Toto Johnson | 13 | 10154753443866336_10154755171971336 | Only stupid people will vote for a corrupt politician like Killery Clinton Benghazi who is under FBI investigation for criminal activities.
15 | Kyle Bailey | 14 | 10154753443866336_10154755213246336 | Actually I have experienced the lies, corruption and evil of the USA State Department several times in just the last 3 years.  "False advertising on government sites, scamming people for expensive visa applications with NO intention to give visas, giving visas, then refusing to renew a visa leaving people stranded in foreign speaking countries with only a short term passport visa and no job nor ability to legally work. Yes. Our State Dept is extremely corrupt!
16 | Russell Sonny Jones | 11 | 10154753443866336_10154755394491336 | It looks like the Whole system is at risk thanks to Obama and the Clintons. So what are we the people of honest integrity going to do about it. Get over our petty little feelings and vote. Do not stay at home or vote a third party or right in someone stupid like Kasich
17 | Kelly Tranum | 10 | 10154753443866336_10154755563296336 | The whole system is at risk and has been for a long time. Unfortunately the government has allowed people to depend on them for handouts and then these people rely on them so in turn vote for idiots that will keep giving handouts. There are people I know who work hard and do the right thing and could use a little help to make ends meet but they can't get it. I do know several people that won't work because hey will loose their help. This is part of the government plan to make us dependent on them and then you know the rest of the story..........

Democrats in the south tried to scuttle the new law with Jim Crow laws and other rules designed to keep blacks enslaved, but eventually that went down as well, writes Bill Federer at
19 | James Branigan | 0 | 10154753443866336_729319943881696 | I would agree with Laura Ingraham's observation.  Until you can pass laws that are enforced for "everybody" regardless of status in America, then there is always a risk to the overall system.  Honesty in government is paramount with respects to the population.  The only recourse for voters is to vote them out.
20 | Debra Pace Cleary | 4 | 10154753443866336_10154755405291336 | Thank you Laura, for clearly stating the obvious.  With emotions running high, it has become easy to take your side  with little consideration for the good of our precious nation.  I pray for a turning away from the destructiveness we have seen embraced by so many that influence our citizenry.  May God be with us as we make our decision, much is at stake!
21 | Pattie Goshtigian | 3 | 10154753443866336_10154755673071336 | I awoke this morning with the actual thought and concern that our country would be in grave danger if Clinton gets elected. One of the biggest reasons is the influx of refugees and the thought of Sharia law being incited and changing the way of life for our children and grandchildren. I really pray that those that haven't yet decided would please consider these two facts along with many other negative reasons. She is a dangerous woman and cannot be trusted with the lives of the people of this country. Nor the babies that will not stand to have a life. I'm praying that people will vote with a conscience and with the mind set that your vote isn't for yourself but your future offspring. Think of the battle that would exist for them and you may not be here to help. How will you feel voting for Clinton? She is going to see that the religious freedom will change when she has the ability to place a person of her choice in the Supreme Court.  Donald Trump may not be the ideal candidate, but he loves the country and the people. He didn't have to do what he's doing.  He said some offensive things, but he hasn't done anything nor will he do anything negative to hurt this country. Please think of the children and their future, born and unborn.
22 | Michelle Hasbun | 4 | 10154753443866336_10154755654366336 | With all of our laws, I cannot believe there is no statute that calls for the resignation of a candidate for President if brought under an active Federal investigation into certain crimes. The fact that Hillary is still on the ballot is evidence of how broken our existing system is. Trump can, and will, fix our crumbling republic-including the dying legal system.
23 | Rick LaRose | 3 | 10154753443866336_10154755372646336 | Laura is absolutely correct. Another thing we must all consider is this. If she is elected, the investigations will continue and perhaps worse there will be gridlock in Washington the likes of which we've never seen. There are far too many issues for this nation to address than to be mired in this swamp for four much less eight more years.
24 | Rusty J Grant | 5 | 10154753443866336_10154755194246336 | Amen. Clinton Greed has destroyed this country. They must be held accountable for the damage they have done. And the bodies they are responsible for.
25 | David May | 3 | 10154753443866336_1708217599438955 | "Putting money ahead of national honor." I can't think of a phrase that sums up Donald Trump's life any better. Show us your tax returns Donald and then we'll see if you care more about your brand or your country.

3 | Linda Hyde Knight | 23 | 10154753660371336_10154755119916336 | Why blast it all over the place -I would say they were obviously hungry...why not help the person ..buy them food etc  rather than make fun of them...you may very well be in there shoes someday..you cant fly so high God cant clip your wings
4 | Donald Rooster Schmitt | 24 | 10154753660371336_10154755136576336 | Look at the hand writing...it's a kid that was obviously hungry and didn't have change...at least they were honest about it...if anything you're admitting that you're an idiot that left your car unlocked
5 | Shelley Lynn Turner | 20 | 10154753660371336_10154755102191336 | The question here is was it my only kit kat or do I have a back up one. If I have no backup KitKat then this person needs to fry and hopefully it was his 3rd strike
6 | Joe Bass | 18 | 10154753660371336_10154755124331336 | I've been homeless and so hungry I would have punched thru the glass for something to eat that was not found in a dumpster.
7 | Catherine Holmes | 16 | 10154753660371336_10154755624651336 | Dude was hungry...and you had no respect for that kit kat anyway...you left it unattended in your car.....who would do something like that??..My husband murdered an almond joy the same way last week....He wasnt charged...I tried to save it by putting it in the freezer...but the damage was done..............leave the dude alone..
8 | Sara Kathryn Patterson | 3 | 10154753660371336_10154755923896336 | Way to go media for putting the wrong spin on this... yet again 🙄. Kid was hungry and left a note. Your car was unlocked. It's not like he broke a window. A thief doesn't leave an apology note. The kid was obviously starving. It's a good deed, you involuntarily giving your KitKat to someone starving, not something to be upset about. I actually find it heartwarming and would want to track that kid down and give him a lifetime supply of KitKats. Just sayin.
9 | Ralph Johnston | 3 | 10154753660371336_10154755849861336 | Can't condone taking what is not yours and violating someones personal space. However there is a spark of morality in leaving the note and stating that they were hungry. If asked, I would have given it to them plus money to eat if I had it.
10 | Adam Walker | 6 | 10154753660371336_10154755865326336 | Does this mean a hungry person should walk through neighborhood's checking doors to see if one is unlocked? Then enter the home and raid the fridge? It's only food right? Just like you morons saying it's only a piece of candy...If I find you in my car, or exiting my car with my property in hand, you will answer to Kimber, the all mighty judge jury and executioner. Yes, a kit Kat bar could be your demise...I've had many things stolen from me throughout my life, so don't dare tell me I'm wrong.

Say you left something in you yard, and because you didn't put it away. You must not care about it. So I took it to sell it and get some money for food, because I was hungry. Translation; " if I want it, I'll take it., but I have a good reason"  Crazy how something so simple, yet wrong is spun to make it seem ok. Well it's not, and we have soup kitchens and shelters for people on the streets. Help is available everywhere. When you enter anyones property without permission and take...guess what...it's against the law. A slice of pizza put a person on their third strike in prison. He was just hungry.....Quit giving in to these types of things. It's a crutch for anyone to justify doing something that is wrong. Even if it's a stupid candy bar. Jokes about it were funny, but having my house broken into and precious items taken gives me a different perspective on things. You might think well it's just things. Well it was the last thing my husband gave me before his sudden heart attack. It's the love he had in his heart giving it to me that made it special. It can't be replaced.  So sorry.. to me it's not ok.

22 | Gideon Jooste | 1 | 10154753660371336_10154755489366336 | Reporters from the Swedish weekly newspaper Nya Tider (New Times) have traveled to South Africa to investigate whether the “Rainbow Nation” is the success story that Swedish establishment media sometimes say – as far as they are at all interested in the land that has been in the media focal point until 1994. We met with politicians, farmers and victims. Thousands of farmers have been murdered in the Rainbow Nation, and the fear is always present.The sun shines low over the red-colored, dry ground. I am currently in South Africa, a land of contrasts with a history out of the ordinary. During the day, I met the country’s former interior minister for a meeting about the country and its challenges. Zulu Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi confirmed what I have written about for years, namely the difficult situation that the country’s white farmers are in. Mr. Buthelezi said that he fully understands that the white farmers are frightened in South Africa of today. There is every reason for it.Since the ANC took power in South Africa in 1994, thanks to extensive financial and moral support from the Swedish government, several thousand white farmers have fallen victim to farm attacks, according to the American organization Genocide Watch. The topic is controversial, especially for us in the Western world. To speak of vulnerable minorities is certainly always appreciated, but not when it comes to a minority originating from the Netherlands and neighboring countries from the beginning. Then the question becomes suddenly very sensitive.I strongly believe in every ethnical groups right to live in accordance with their culture and traditions. After traveling around in South Africa for long periods and after reporting from war torn countries in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, you quickly realize the value of security and peace. Civilized and non-corrupt governments, ethnical groups whose rights are recognized and nations that are not exploited by foreign interests are of paramount importance for a just world.A forgotten minority. One of the many children who will grow up in a squatter camp in South Africa. Picture from Pretoria. Photo: Nya Tider / Free West mediaA forgotten minority. One of the many children who will grow up in a squatter camp in South Africa. Picture from Pretoria. Photo: Nya Tider / Free West mediaDuring a five year period, I have traveled to South Africa several times, visiting farms and farmers to document farm attacks. During this latest trip, I have spoken with the victims of those attacks, as well as with relatives of people murdered in the most heinous acts. What is remarkable in these stories is that in many cases it is not about robbery. It would have been much easier for perpetrators to clear the home when no one is home, but still they wait until the owners come back. What happens then is in too many cases that the woman in the house is raped in front of the husband, and that one or more is killed – sometimes the whole family. On a farm I visited in Randfontein outside Johannesburg in mid-March the whole family was killed, and there was still money left on the bloody bed where an elderly man was beaten to death. The only thing taken after the murders was a car, but it was set on fire a few kilometers away. The trend is similar in many of the cases we have examined.Many white farmers are worried about the political developments in South Africa. The radical party Economic Freedom Fighters, who want to seize most, if not all, of the white farmers’ land, is gaining ground. They received six percent of the votes in its first election two years ago. I met with their representatives in Cape Town a couple of days ago, and they were confident that the party will be governing in a not too distant future. Party leader Julius Malema made himself known to an international audience when he, then as leader of the ANC Youth League, sang a song about killing white farmers. Human rights activist Dan Roodt, born in South Africa, says that the situation of the white minority has become worse since Nelson Mandela – a restraining factor – died two years ago. Attacks are now more and more brutal. Most white farmers know someone or know of someone who has fallen victim to an attack. The fear has spread in the rural communities.Blacks have grown to 90 percent of the population and there is little interest in protecting the white minority’s interests. On the contrary, today there are more racial laws than during apartheid. Businesses owned by blacks get preferential access to government contracts, there are laws requiring black ownership in large companies and many whites are locked out of universities because “their” quota is full.Five years ago I visited a farmer community outside the city of Nylstroom and two years ago I did a follow-up. When I came to the same area again last week, I was met by several tragic news. Several attacks have occurred in the neighborhood. An elderly couple had been murdered in their home, the older woman had been raped and burned up. The perpetrators had left empty liquor bottles at the scene and set fire to the house before they set off. We spoke with a 28-year-old woman who lost her husband in a farm attack that took place outside Nylstroom at the end of last year. This was the second husband the young woman had lost. The perpetrators had broken into the house when the couple slept and stabbed her husband to death with a screwdriver. The woman grabbed a knife and fought for her life, thus escaping being raped, but she was also badly cut. The perpetrators held a knife to the couple’s infant to force the mother to open the gun cabinet and then murdered her husband when his four-year daughter watched.Many white farmers would naturally flee South Africa if they could. However, most are settled in the country for economic reasons, including an elderly lady I spoke with, whose daughter had been stabbed to death eight months ago. She had been stabbed with a knife in front of her two little boys. The elderly woman now wants to move to Europe or Australia, but has no economic opportunity to even move to a safer part of South Africa.In Sweden, we are constantly told that there are no Swedes, that a “privileged white” person cannot become a victim of racism. The same attitude towards whites that is prevalient in the West, we also see when it comes to South Africa’s white minority. The official viewpoint is that it simply cannot exist any racism against whites, that the attacks against whites simply are a matter of common robbery, despite the statistics and that the farmers themselves suggest otherwise. When I met the press spokesman of the Transvaal Agricultural Union, Henk van de Graaf, he told me that the most dangerous profession in the crime ridden South Africa is being a farmer. More people have been murdered here than in neighboring Zimbabwe, where the regime deliberately hunted white farmers out of the country.We must dare to talk about the attacks against the white minority in South Africa, just as we need to talk about racism against the Swedes in my home country without being labeled as “racists”. In the upcoming issue of New Times, readers will find stories and interviews with victims and politicians from South Africa.Sanna Hill – Free West Media

7 | Joyce Menzel | 74 | 10154753457881336_10154755054901336 | She should be put in jail to never see the light of day again. They are children, who she was supposed to protect. It's bad when a child can't depend on its own mother to keep it safe. Children are a gift from God.

Thank you state of Texas.

Prayers for these kids that someone can truly care for them and they stay together. Hopefully there is no issues with them being addicted to it. Sounds like there was more abuse then just the use of drugs.

On Fox & Friends, Speaker Paul Ryan said former President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton "live beyond the rules."

1 | Patty Rasmusson So | 1068 | 10154753353251336_10154754863076336 | Her followers question NOT how she has earned her money. She owns NO business, employs NO ONE, turns NO profit that benefits the public, yet has millions upon millions. Explain how middle class and low-income voters can accept this. She has done NOTHING to merit this kind of wealth.
2 | Andrew Elorriaga | 578 | 10154753353251336_10154754859551336 | You would think at their age they would be content with all of their ill gotten gains but it will be their greed for more that will finally do them in.
3 | Rocky Robinette | 236 | 10154753353251336_10154754863806336 | Paul Ryan finally got something right. America is sick and tired of all the scandals, corruption, lies and deception of the Clintons. It's time for them to go away.
4 | Aaron Graham | 172 | 10154753353251336_10154754865396336 | I was born in 1990, so I don't recall all of the scandals, but I do remember hearing my first "sex" talk on the tv news from the impeachment trial. I first heard of the phrase blow job in 1998 when I was 8 years old from the tv news. I had know idea what it meant, I thought they were talking about a lolly pop. Part of my innocents was indirectly taken by the Clinton's. Lets prevent anymore Clinton damage, vote Trump/Pence!
5 | Pamela Huffman | 108 | 10154753353251336_10154754863901336 | Well Paul, why aren't you standing up for Trump then? It's a good statement, but actions speak louder. Show us where you stand.
6 | Este Fanía | 61 | 10154753353251336_10154754862486336 | AMERICANS NEED TO READ THIS REPOST FROM A MILITARY MEDIC! WAKE UP AMERICA! Something I saw in a comment section Those that are interested in the truth, will find it. Those that interested in PC will follow blindly.Christopher Allard Repost23 hrs · Edited · I don't typically go on rants or express my political beliefs here, but I just have to get this off my mind. As some of you know, I'm active duty Army. Aside from that, I am a medic. I've spent 3 years of my life overseas in both Afghanistan and Iraq. I've seen some pretty atrocious sites caused by war, from both sides. I've picked up blown up body parts of friends and I've saved the lives of guys who were trying to kill me and my guys right before I was keeping them from their 72 virgins or whatever they believe awaits them on the other side. Here is an unbiased truthful view to the Syrian refugee situation. My first deployment to Iraq, in 2006, my unit voluntarily ran a childrens burn clinic outside of the FOB. It was a constant target for attacks. You would think that people wouldn't shoot mortars or rockets at their own children, but you would be wrong. We saw hundreds of children, from infants to 18 year olds. The overwhelming majority of the kids we saw (90% or better) were clear cases of abuse. These parents were literally dunking their kids in boiling water, or throwing hot chai at their kids faces... Yes, we're talking about babies, toddlers, kids not even old enough to understand why their parents would do these things to them. HUNDREDS of kids... We saw quite a few of these kids that were sexually abused, both girls and boys. Their parents acted if nothing was wrong with this, even when confronted by our doctors. This is the mentality of their society, not the viewpoint of a few individuals... these beliefs have been accepted to the vast majority of these people. Many were educated, well dressed, well spoken men, but yet, they still raped their own children, and kept chai boys (if you don't know what that means, google it.) During that deployment, we also captured the 3rd largest EFP cache that had ever been captured. There were hundreds of copper plates, homemade explosives, fake curbs to house the EFP's, hundreds of mortars and rockets and howitzer rounds, even an anti-aircraft gun. All of these things came from one place, Syria. Almost every single IED or EFP we found or hit could be traced back to Syria... A lot of the terrorists we captured were from SYRIA... Imagine that. Fast forward a couple years, and I find myself in Helmand Province, in Afghanistan... We had a group of Afghani's that were paid to help guard our little mud hut in the middle of an Afghan village (I wasn't on a fob) These guys also kept a "chai boy" A boy, about 11 years old, who was there to serve these guys sexually. We heard him being sexually assaulted many times, but there was nothing we could do about it. We asked the police, the Afghan Army, and we were told the same thing every time.... it's their culture, and accepted as the norm.... Once again, we captured Syrian made explosives, weapons, and other items... We found Syrian passports during raids... And people out there want us to let these people into the US, with our kids, and near our wives. Near our schools, near our churches, synogogues, malls. Places where we should never have to fear being blown up, shot, kidnapped and tortured... Don't forget what they did to the Egyptian Coptic Christians, or the Jordanian pilot... Don't forget about what they do to rape victims! They stone these women to death for being raped! They behead their own people. Do you think they will show mercy to you? Look at the rape statistics in Denmark, Sweden, Belgium. Facts don't lie... 97% of rapes committed in Sweden were committed by Muslim immigrants... And you want 10,000 of these people here? Even if just 1% of these so called "refugees" were ISIS supporters or active ISIS terrorists, would that be acceptable to you? Chew on it... think about it. Take a good look at your kids or your wife and decide if the risk is worth taking. Feel free to share this if you want.
7 | Scotty Hickox | 58 | 10154753353251336_10154754866856336 | I'll never forget being a little boy holding my action figures watching the TV as the president said that he did not have sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky only to find myself on that same spot of carpet with action figures in my hand a short time later watching him admit that he lied to the American people and did in fact have sex with Monica Lewinsky! The clintons are nothing but Scandal! I choose to vote for Donald Trump!
8 | Schwabe David Shannah | 32 | 10154753353251336_10154754897101336 | The Clintons have robbed the American people blind. They have taken money from countries that kill women and children . Bill Clinton is a convicted Sex Offender ! And Hillary defends this behavior , just ask the little girl who was brutally raped , and Hillary defended this monster , laughing ,that she got him off. WOMEN ..listen up , this is not the woman, we want our daughters to look up to ! Hillary is a disgrace to our country.
9 | Wayne Miller | 32 | 10154753353251336_10154754866516336 | We hated that period of American History , it was a time some seem to forget because they never accepted that William Jefferson Clinton was impeached and disbarred and left with a very dark cloud over their heads . History will never change the facts were even softened and America moved on never to go back .
10 | Al Gi Carrillo | 15 | 10154753353251336_1224948684238540 | So, I am reading that Hillary is really upset that the FBI is "dumping" on her right before the election.... I want to say to Mrs. Clinton, "So Hillary, how does it feel to be aborted 8 days before delivery?" Stole that comment, but it is awesome!
11 | John Cheek | 24 | 10154753353251336_10154754877151336 | It's not the money. It's like a kleptomaniac or any other psychopath. They just feel they are above everyone else and because they are so superior. they do as they please.
12 | Bill Morin | 13 | 10154753353251336_10154755287321336 | No..i was sick of the Clintons after 8 years of Bill Clinton embaressing this Country...I don't need to see him as first lady around the White House, his Wife is not deserving of the position and frankly she acts as if she Is owed the position. She shouldn't even hold a Security Clearance.
13 | John Anderson | 15 | 10154753353251336_10154754923821336 | "Last night a friend claimed that Donald Trump wouldn’t make a good president; he is brash, he is racist, he is a loudmouth; you know the normal things people learn to recite after being programmed by television news. The one I loved was that, “Trump is arrogant.” My friend questioned if one man could make “that much difference in the world today.” To my friend's credit, she was respectful enough to let me respond when she asked, “Really, what has Trump done?”I said, “In June of last year, Trump entered the race for president. In just a little over a year, Trump has single handedly defeated the Republican party. He did so thoroughly. In fact, he did so in such a resounding way that the Republican Party now suffers from an identity crisis. He literally dismantled the party. Trump even dismantled and dismissed the brand and value of the Bush family.Trump has Obama petrified that Trump will dismiss programs that weren’t properly installed using proper law.Trump has single handedly debunked and disemboweled any value of news media as we knew it—news now suffering from an all-time level of distrust and disrespect.Trump has leaders from all over the world talking about him, whether good or bad. Trust me, powerful men who have been president before weren’t liked by the global community. I doubt Mikhail Gorbachev liked Reagan when Reagan said, "Tear down that wall."Trump has expressly disclosed the fraud perpetrated on the American public by Hillary Clinton. He has, quite literally, brought Hillary to her knees—if you believe that nervous tension and disorders offer physical side effects and damage.Trump has unified the silent majority in a way that should be patently frightening to “liberals.”As the press accuses Trump of being a house of cards, Trump has proven the press is the real house of cards. He has whipped up the entire establishment into pure panic. Trump has exposed them for who they are and worse, what they are. George Clooney was right when he said Trump draws live news coverage of his podium that he’s not yet approached. Thanks, George, you were perfectly correct.What we see as headline news today are actually the last bubbles from the ship that is now sunk—meaning the standard news media, as a propaganda machine, has been exposed. They have no more value.In the same way Trump asked the African-American community this question, I asked my friend, ”At this point, what do you have to lose?” We have mass cop shootings, riots in our streets, ambushed cops, double digit inflation, bombs blowing up in our cities, targeted police, #BLM, a skyrocketing jobless rate, no economic growth, privately owned land being seized by the federal government, the worst racial tension in my lifetime, no God in schools, more abortions than ever, illegal aliens pouring into our country, sick veterans receiving no care, and a debt that doubled in seven years to $19 trillion. Are you really happy with the condition of the current system?One man has done all of this in one year—one guy, and on his own dime. And with everything I’ve written above, you believe Trump hasn't done anything? You claim that you are afraid of Donald Trump? No wonder we’re in trouble. You can say that Trump is a lousy presidential candidate. That’s your right. Just don’t ever say he’s not effective.That Megan Kelly, FOX News, CNN, MSNBC, Washington Post, Rachel Maddow, the Huffington Post, the New York Times, Raleigh’s News and Observer, the AP, Don Lemon, Jake Tapper, and many more, failed to implement their collectively orchestrated lie on the American people against Trump, is actually a massive testament to Trump. The press colluded pure propaganda to accomplish his demise … and they have collectively failed and miserably.Here's just one example of how badly America is injured right now. There are high school football players on their knees during the national anthem simply because the press used as propaganda to program those kids to do that very thing. But, these kids are mimicking NFL stars the same way the same kids chooses which brand of football shoe to purchase—they're overtly brain-washed to do that very thing.Now, we have a generation of children who hate America.America’s problem isn’t that little children are on their knee in collective disrespect of America. Our problem is that America is on her knee from collective disrespect by Americans.You can disrespect America all you want. But, it’s high-time you respect the silent majority. Because they’re not simply the “silent majority” as you’ve been trained to believe when Hillary calls them “deplorables.” The fact is, they are simply the majority. And now they're no longer silent either. Donald Trump changed all of that, single-handedly and within one year." From Be Forbes."Bebe Coe Bertino9/29/2016 , this is a copy and paste, and needs to be read and spread!! #onpoint
14 | Brenda Y. England | 5 | 10154753353251336_10154755263616336 | Yes lots of scandals but no proof  of wrong doing as I remember the only thing that the desperate GOP was able to get on Bill Clinton is his lying about Monica Lewinsky and that was a pitiful and ugly win for the GOP!
15 | Avi Rubin | 7 | 10154753353251336_10154754912931336 | Mrs. Clinton is weak and unreliable liar. Obama was the worst president of all time, weakening US caused the rise of radical Islam. Mrs. Clinton would be Obama follows causing a strengthening of Islamic terrorism and Will continue to destroy of the US. Only Trump will stop the Islamic terrorism and will strengthen the US.Do not make a critical mistake you need to choose Trump!
16 | Dwayne Lowe | 13 | 10154753353251336_10154754870066336 | The clintons can be compared to the mob. Only difference is that the mob has morals/ethics which the clinton's lack. But that's just my opinion
17 | Andrew Smith | 5 | 10154753353251336_10154754879231336 | Well, so did Dick Cheney, Karl Rove, and George Bush when they outted a covert CIA agent, but did they get in trouble? Nope.
18 | Susan Moore | 2 | 10154753353251336_1224891980910877 | And of course we should listen to Paul Ryan! The man who posed for photo ops at a soup kitchen but insisted on washing already washed pots and pans. Or maybe the man who lied about his time in the marathon he was so proud of finishing, but no one ever was able to verify his time or his finishing order, These are not lies that he would have ever had to lie. He lied for the effect, to prove his "goodness". The lies about school childrens lunches in Wisconsin were convenient when he wanted to cut funding to schools but were they showing his goodness to poor kids who went hungry at school? As far as he is concerned it is one lie after another after another.
19 | Marianne Delgaudio | 5 | 10154753353251336_1225021297564612 | I have to say I borrowed this post !! It was to good not to pass on , POINTS TO PONDER BEFORE ELECTION DAY :If you are Gay, why are you voting for Hillary? She wants to bring in hundreds of thousands of refugees that believe all Gays should be executed.If you are Black, why are you voting for Hillary? She admires Margaret Sanger and defends Planned Parenthood. They want to abort as many black babies as possible. "Exterminate the Black Race because they are like weeds." Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.If you are a Christian, why are you voting for Hillary Clinton? She wrote her Senior Thesis on Saul Alinsky. He dedicated his book "Rules for Radicals" to Lucifer, The Devil? She says he was and still is her mentor.If you are a Veteran, in the military, or closely related to a military member, why are you voting for Hillary? She left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again. They called for help but the help was told to stand down.If you have factory job, why are you voting for Hillary? She supported TPP. Factory workers are being laid off because jobs are going overseas. Don't forget the deals she made with China. She also welcomes open borders and for illegals to get benefits with YOUR tax money.If you are poor, why are you voting for Hillary? She is supporting Wall street and all the big banks. Big banks keep the poor, poor by destroying the poor man's credit by allowing medical bills and collections to affect your credit scores so you can pay higher interest rates than the rich. - Taking as much of the little money you earn.If you are a woman, how can you vote for Hillary? She has buried all of Bill's rape victims under the rug. Remember the little girl that was raped? She defended the rapist and laughed about it later.If you carry a gun, and believe in the Constitution, how can you vote for Hillary? She wants to eliminate the NRA, take your guns, and abolish the second amendment.If you breathe, why would you vote for Hillary?

The crazy thing back then, I thought poor Clinton, the Republican Party was trying to sabotage them. But wow I know differently now they are just greedy and want power, nothing good about them. They are bad, I am a democratic for Mr Trump. Vote for him.
21 | Laura Dreyer Ferguson | 6 | 10154753353251336_10154755062401336 | These people are billionaires. Don't let the media fool ya. She gets all her money from our enemies. Just hides it.

24 | Deborah Worsham Ethridge | 3 | 10154753353251336_10154755167441336 | Not only scandal after scandal but complete incompetence! Read on for some of her past accomplishments.....For the young pups......Those that refuse to learn from the lessons of history are condemned to repeat them:   How quickly we forget! If you’re over 35, take a walk with me down memory lane—you won’t believe what you have forgotten. If you’re under 35, read on—I promise you that you will be amazed at what you missed! (By the way, sadly, this isn’t a joke. I wish it was.)REMEMBER WHEN BILL CLINTON WAS PRESIDENT?(January 20, 1993 to January 20, 2001—two terms)When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over an attempt to reform health care.Her proposed plan was so bad that many Democrats came up with competing plans of their own in protest, and in spite of threats and intimidation, on September 26, 1994, the “Hillarycare” bill was declared dead.This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million for studies, promotion, and other efforts.Then, President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general. Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood—both were forced to withdraw their names from consideration.Next, she chose Janet Reno, which husband Bill described as "my worst mistake."(Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.)Husband Bill also allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission—Lani Guanier was her selection.After considerable backlash from prominent Democratic senators concerning Ms. Guanier's radical views, Bill Clinton withdrew her name from nomination, stating that she did not represents the civil rights views that he had championed during his campaign.However, apparently a slow learner, husband Bill continued to allow Hillary to make more recommendations.She chose former law partners, Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department.Her selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kennedy was forced to resign.(Is anyone wondering yet what her Supreme Court Justice appointments would be like?)Many younger voters will have no knowledge of "Travelgate," the first major ethics controversy during Bill’s presidency.Hillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend, Harry Thompson—but the White House Travel Office refused to comply.She trumped up allegations of financial mismanagement and reported seven long-time White House employees to the FBI. This ruined their reputations, got them fired, and caused a thirty-six month investigation.Eventually, most of the employees were reinstated and Clinton associates were forced out of the travel office. Only one White House employee, Billy Dale, was charged with a crime—the enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds; a jury acquitted him in less than two hours.Still not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House Security.When Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies (Filegate) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff, suddenly Hillary and the President denied even knowing Livingstone, and of course, denied knowledge of drug use in the White House.Following this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents.Next, when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by Bill Clinton, Hillary was put in charge of the "bimbo eruption" and scandal defense.Let’s look at some of her more notable decisions in this regard . . .She urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation, they settled with Ms. Jones.She refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor.After $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr's investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs.Hillary's devious game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for 'lying under oath' to a grand jury, followed by his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives.Hillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, "I do not recall," "I have no recollection," and "I don't know" a total of 56 times while under oath. (Sound familiar?)After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had "mistakenly thought was hers."So you see, the email scandal and all of her malfeasance regarding the handling of Top Secret information, not to mention the "pay to play" schemes of the Clinton Foundation, are nothing new.Hillary’s entire political career has been nothing but a web of lies, corruption and destruction in her quest for power.Is anyone else ready to say, “Enough is enough!”?But unfortunately, I’m sure her loyal fans will say, "What difference does it make?"Source:copy/paste......wish I could take credit for this eloquent recap of Historical events

It is really sad the state of this country where peoples ages 18 thru 24 are gonna vote because of what they think they know or because of what Liberal teachers and professors have taught them. I am proud to have been born in 1978, raised in the 80's, experience the 90's and 2000's. This is most definitely the worse I have seen this country besides the late 1990's say 1997 thru 1999.

"Clinton is corrupt. There's no reason to believe Clinton's going to do anything that involves reforming anything."

Newt Gingrich reacted to new emails released by Wikileaks on interim DNC chair Donna Brazile, asking "where are all the Bernie Sanders supporters? These people just got mugged by the Clinton machine."

2 | Paul Gordon | 281 | 10154754633646336_10154754807321336 | Because Bernie Sanders just received a brand-new house his third homes at that ,I'm willing to bet the Clinton foundation paid for it
3 | Tammy Altom | 194 | 10154754633646336_10154754812481336 | Something that I read from another voter, Nancy Cruz, that made sense and sums up the nonsense:What exactly is the confusion in this election? ---You either want lower taxes or you don't. You either want a country with safe, secure borders or you don't. You either want a robust economy & more JOBS or you don't.You either want safe neighborhoods or you don't.You either want to defeat radical Islamic terrorism or you don't.You either want school choice or you don't. You either want a strong National defense system or you don't. You either want to keep the right to bear arms (& protect yourself) or you don't.You either want better & less expensive healthcare or you don't.You either want a candidate who wants to be President of the People or you want the candidate of the Wealthy Elites.You either want a CORRUPT FREE government or you are happy with the corruptness at every level (FBI, DoJ etc).You either believe a child has rights even 1 minute before they're born or you don't think a child has rights until after they're born. You either want the first US female President to be honest, trustworthy, and patriotic or you want her to be the most corrupt person to ever run for POTUS, morally bankrupt, who put America up for sale, & has disdain and contempt for all hard-working Americans! Hillary Clinton has lied and cheated her entire life! Voting for her is ANTI-AMERICAN! For the future first woman President, I'm picturing someone like Jackie Kennedy or Nancy Reagan, not this evil woman.
4 | Brian Tutterrow | 98 | 10154754633646336_10154754817996336 | Sanders isn't saying anything because he wasn't there to win.  He was to keep all other candidates (democrat) out.  He got paid for his services.  Make no mistake about that.
5 | Tom Miller | 145 | 10154754633646336_10154754818536336 | If Trump becomes President...THINK HARD PEEPS!• The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.• The media has been stomped.• Career politicians will have lost all job security.• The guns in your home will safely stay there.• Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.• Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally• Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.• No more apologies to the world for being great!• Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.• Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.• There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.• The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.• The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump becomes President ❤
6 | Samy Sam | 53 | 10154754633646336_10154754816981336 | Let's narrow it down to a minimum. Obama and hillary allowed Americans to die in Benghazi, hillary deleted emails so we couldn't see her criminal actions, hillary and her criminal campaign mafia pays people to got to Trumps rallys to incite violence. Hillary and her criminal campaign mafia paid people to cause riots in cities where Trump is holding a rally. Hillary and her criminal campaign mafia paid people to cause voter fraud. Well just a few. So along comes wikileaks and O ' Keefe videotapes where the whole world can see how much of a criminal hillary really has been. To put the icing on top, the wiener, yes along comes wiener and puff there's the emails she was hiding.
7 | Carl Wisnesky Sr. | 43 | 10154754633646336_10154754916476336 | Hey liberals, just to refresh your memory.  Your hero Obama said of Hillary in his 2008 campaign, "She will say anything to get elected but will do nothing."
8 | Jeff Parshall | 30 | 10154754633646336_10154754838876336 | Bernie Sanders is a Sellout.  He will always be known as the sellout to the Devil! He fooled them all!  I heard Bernie is on his 3rd home now. Wonder if he has any room in his basement?
9 | Alec Gormley | 43 | 10154754633646336_10154754812846336 | The Clinton machine is unstoppable. Wait till libs start going broke forced to pay for Obama Care, then they will regret voting for her. Then her spending will hit 30 trillion so taxes will go up.
10 | Wendi Sargent | 15 | 10154754633646336_10154754849316336 | AMERICANS NEED TO READ THIS REPOST FROM A MILITARY MEDIC! WAKE UP AMERICA! Something I saw in a comment section Those that are interested in the truth, will find it. Those that interested in PC will follow blindly.Christopher Allard Repost23 hrs · Edited · I don't typically go on rants or express my political beliefs here, but I just have to get this off my mind. As some of you know, I'm active duty Army. Aside from that, I am a medic. I've spent 3 years of my life overseas in both Afghanistan and Iraq. I've seen some pretty atrocious sites caused by war, from both sides. I've picked up blown up body parts of friends and I've saved the lives of guys who were trying to kill me and my guys right before I was keeping them from their 72 virgins or whatever they believe awaits them on the other side. Here is an unbiased truthful view to the Syrian refugee situation. My first deployment to Iraq, in 2006, my unit voluntarily ran a childrens burn clinic outside of the FOB. It was a constant target for attacks. You would think that people wouldn't shoot mortars or rockets at their own children, but you would be wrong. We saw hundreds of children, from infants to 18 year olds. The overwhelming majority of the kids we saw (90% or better) were clear cases of abuse. These parents were literally dunking their kids in boiling water, or throwing hot chai at their kids faces... Yes, we're talking about babies, toddlers, kids not even old enough to understand why their parents would do these things to them. HUNDREDS of kids... We saw quite a few of these kids that were sexually abused, both girls and boys. Their parents acted if nothing was wrong with this, even when confronted by our doctors. This is the mentality of their society, not the viewpoint of a few individuals... these beliefs have been accepted to the vast majority of these people. Many were educated, well dressed, well spoken men, but yet, they still raped their own children, and kept chai boys (if you don't know what that means, google it.) During that deployment, we also captured the 3rd largest EFP cache that had ever been captured. There were hundreds of copper plates, homemade explosives, fake curbs to house the EFP's, hundreds of mortars and rockets and howitzer rounds, even an anti-aircraft gun. All of these things came from one place, Syria. Almost every single IED or EFP we found or hit could be traced back to Syria... A lot of the terrorists we captured were from SYRIA... Imagine that. Fast forward a couple years, and I find myself in Helmand Province, in Afghanistan... We had a group of Afghani's that were paid to help guard our little mud hut in the middle of an Afghan village (I wasn't on a fob) These guys also kept a "chai boy" A boy, about 11 years old, who was there to serve these guys sexually. We heard him being sexually assaulted many times, but there was nothing we could do about it. We asked the police, the Afghan Army, and we were told the same thing every time.... it's their culture, and accepted as the norm.... Once again, we captured Syrian made explosives, weapons, and other items... We found Syrian passports during raids... And people out there want us to let these people into the US, with our kids, and near our wives. Near our schools, near our churches, synogogues, malls. Places where we should never have to fear being blown up, shot, kidnapped and tortured... Don't forget what they did to the Egyptian Coptic Christians, or the Jordanian pilot... Don't forget about what they do to rape victims! They stone these women to death for being raped! They behead their own people. Do you think they will show mercy to you? Look at the rape statistics in Denmark, Sweden, Belgium. Facts don't lie... 97% of rapes committed in Sweden were committed by Muslim immigrants... And you want 10,000 of these people here? Even if just 1% of these so called "refugees" were ISIS supporters or active ISIS terrorists, would that be acceptable tob you? Chew on it... think about it. Take a good look at your kids or your wife and decide if the risk is worth taking. Feel free to share this if you want.
11 | Greg Frith | 23 | 10154754633646336_10154754811631336 | Just in case anyone has forgotten, international tax fugitive Marc Rich bought a highly controversial Presidential Pardon from Bill Clinton in 2001 via a $1,000,000+ donation to the Clinton Foundation  from his ex-wife, Denise Rich, to help pay for the Clinton Presidential library. It seems the FBI has finally released a lot of information into the investigation they conducted into Bill Clinton's "Pardon For Payment" allegations in 2001. Trump is not much better, but this is who you are voting to get into the White House if you vote for Hillary Clinton - An established political dynasty willing to sell out political favours for cash. Abraham Lincoln would be spinning in his grave. How has it come to this?
12 | Avi Rubin | 16 | 10154754633646336_10154754913251336 | Mrs. Clinton is weak and unreliable liar. Obama was the worst president of all time, weakening US caused the rise of radical Islam. Mrs. Clinton would be Obama follows causing a strengthening of Islamic terrorism and Will continue to destroy of the US. Only Trump will stop the Islamic terrorism and will strengthen the US.Do not make a critical mistake you need to choose Trump!
13 | Alec Gormley | 9 | 10154754633646336_10154754815076336 | How will libs survive paying for Obamacare, oh right Hillary will raise minimum wages. Then we will get inflation people on fixed incomes will be broke.
14 | Michael Angelo de Castro | 37 | 10154754633646336_10154754803336336 | Hillary is such a champion for women's rights and protecting children that she has chosen to attack the FBI investigation of a pedophile she is associated with, without a single word about his multiple underage female victims. Nothing changes with Hillary.
15 | William Boggs Montemayor | 8 | 10154754633646336_10154754825616336 | Obama said if you disrespect woman then and if Trump elected he'll do it again, i highly diut that.ButHilliary Clinton 30 years in office corrupting the system repeatedly, if she get elected she'll continueslly doing the corruption and not ever stop until she die.Hilliary is a dishonest, liar and metriarch of all American corruptions. #hillarygotohellbringyoursexaddictBillwithyou
16 | Randy Vaughan | 5 | 10154754633646336_10154754913436336 | Seems even Bernie mugged his own supporters after the Clinton/Obama cult made it worth his troubles. Now the basement dwellers, as Hillary calls them, find themselves thrown in either the taco bowl, or the deplorable basket, or a super preditor if they don't bow to queen Hillary. This Presidential election choice is so simple. Either you can vote for Trump/Pence and stand with your fellow Americans who wish to end the corruption in DC and a bias mainstream media. Or, you can vote for an unfit criminal who has a trail of corruption 30 years long, Hillary/Kaine. Or vote for one who has no impact and does nothing to end the corruption in DC, Or, you can not vote at all and do nothing to help cleanup the lawlessness in our nations government.
17 | Santiago Palomares | 2 | 10154754633646336_10154754937551336 | Newt nailed it, I sure like him.. And the deal Bernie where he sold his people out, I think their to embarrassed to show their face for being such fools.. They should be all over the DNC and the Clinton's, and yes Obama you know that fool was in it somewhere. You liberal sheep just never learn do you?
18 | Joseph Yuzon | 4 | 10154754633646336_10154754857946336 | Nominations was stolen from Bernie Sanders. Bernie Sanders is not speaking out because all of the sudden he bought a property over half million. Did I say hush?🤐u talk beans spills. Hush$So much dishonesty in the Demorats
19 | Tankeh Ndimukum | 3 | 10154754633646336_1742280739367577 | Newt it's because only deplorable republicans like you with a xenophobic character see Clinton as corrupt and the rest of the world see her as a strong passionate woman. You may just resign instead for loosing on this campaign.  Fox news alone can not influence the election. You can plan another conspiracy in the next seven day. We don't plan anything against Trump except to use his vile words to define the animal and his deplorable supporters who see nothing wrong if he threatens democracy or human lives by planning to start a nuclear war or shoot anyone on the street and his supporters would still support him including Newt Hannity of Fox. The mega evil machine of the republican party media.
20 | Laina Poleman | 3 | 10154754633646336_1013839948738208 | I wonder if any of this is true. More information about what I received about Clinton's emails.Clinton did not know that her chief adviser Huma used her husband's computer to back up all emails. She had done this a long time ago, and she probably forgot about THAT setting of backup. For Weiner's computer.Now the FBI goes to Weiner's computer to check his emails in his sex case, and they stumble on this file with all the backed up emails.Could the FBI keep quiet about this finding? No. Whichever way they would have decided, the Republicans would have cried 'murder', if it was known that they had the missing emails, yet did not say so. They had to come clean and announce it.Why is Russia so interested in keeping Assad in power?I have asked many influential people and they did not have an answer,Yesterday I received the answer.President Obama and Clinton were planning to build an oil pipeline from Turkey to Qatar. They were going to make a 'killing' on this deal. Literally billions of dollars. Now this is where the snag popped up. Assad did not like the pipeline passing through Syria (not sure if he was not offered enough to like it or any other reason for him being against it). The deal was stuck.The solution was to get rid of Assad and so Obama and Clinton decided to start an Arab spring in Syria, as that was the trend in the rest of the Arab world at that time. the USA encouraged rebels to take up arms and started a revolution to get rid of Assad. The plan nearly worked, but Russia cam into the picture as she did not want this deal to go through. So Russia intervened and saved Assad from assured destruction.Now this deal could now also explain the millions of dollars the Qatar has donated over the years to the Clinton foundation.Now Iran is also involved in this deal. She was supposed to benefit greatly from this pipe line as she was going to be one of the main suppliers of this oil that was to be pumped to Qatar. Now we see that Iran has a very big vested interest in our region and stood to make billions annually from it.At the beginning of the year, America, under the orders of Obama, transferred 1.7 billion dollars in CASH to the Iranians. It was made out to be some type of ransom, for the 4 Americans being held there at that time. This seems now to not be the truth. This money was made out to be ransom money, but it was money due to Iran according to the pipe line agreement and this was a cover for this transaction. Money was in reality being stolen by the Clintons and Obama, and used for their personal interests. CRIMINAL.And what about the resulting civil war in the region, that was to topple Assad. hundreds of thousands of people had been killed as a result, and million have been left homeless and refugees. This could be the reason why Clinton wants to allow so many of the Syrian refugees into America.There is more to come, and the information that I am receiving, is now putting many pieces of the puzzle together and the picture is becoming very clear. These people, Obama and the Clintons have destroyed the decent world over greed for themselves. Human lives have not been part of the equation. Money was the prize, and it was going to be got at all costs.Oh and another point was written and agreed on. If Obama was to be charged, Clinton, being President was supposed to grant him a pardon, shortly later.Can you sleep tonight? I certainly cannot, knowing there is the slightest possibility that Clinton could be elected President, and these evil plans and cover-ups could continue.Wikileaks will fill us in on all the information needed, before and I'm sure after the elections. Internal investigations are continuing by them.More to follow.....
21 | Linda Stillwell Ray | 3 | 10154754633646336_1013564162099120 | Hillary has NEVER apologized to the American People. She accused Mr Trump of not apologizing, when he did apologize for his language & poor choice of words. But why should he apologized for unproven accusations?  Accusation: a charge or claim of wrong doing. Does not mean it's true, especially when the women are drummed up by an opposing candidate !!!!!
22 | Joanne McDonald | 4 | 10154754633646336_10154754851236336 | Bernie never had a slight chance to be the nominee. Hillary and the DNC trampled all over him, then he goes and endorses and campaigns with her. What a fool !

24 | Constantin Pavel | 2 | 10154754633646336_10154754960051336 | The Republican Party cursed the world with their presidential nominee who is a pathological day-to-day liar, a flaming narcissist, a sexual predator. And in so doing has unmasked the Republican Party revealing their true face & agenda. Burdening us with the candidate of the crazies, the KKK, the white supremacists, the Neo Naz, the violent unstables, and the domestic terrorists. Trumps violent bullies will intimidate at voting places, commit violence after Trump loses, and then domestic terrorism in the time after the elections.
25 | Beth Tieman Anderson | 2 | 10154754633646336_1013841402071396 | And Donald the duck Trump won't do anything either. He's all talk and no action. Do you want every country to have nuclear weapons? That's what he wants. Do you believe women should be punished for having a say about how to handle their own body? He does. Is a woman in the workplace dangerous? He thinks so. He said if dinner isn't ready when he gets home he goes through the roof. Do you want a shaky finger on the red button? He adores Putin. Thinks he's the best leader hands down and has met him and has said so on video but then denies it. The man thinks he can grope woman anytime. He can't look at a woman as his equal or better. He's a pig, narcissist and says 'i and only I can do this'. He can't take criticism. I will NOT be bullied into changing my vote and no one else should either. Besides once you vote you're done. You can't change it. He's such an idiot.
