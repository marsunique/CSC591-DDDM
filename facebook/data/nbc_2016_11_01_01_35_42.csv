During a Colorado rally on Sunday, Trump unfurled an upside-down rainbow flag with the words "LGBTs for Trump" written on it.

1 | Dustin Ginsberg | 284 | 1553359904684034_1553360768017281 | I love how it's upside down! Because our community will be in distress if he is elected! No self respecting gay men can vote for Trump/Pence. They want to push LGBTQ rights back 10, 20 even 30 years. Trump has stated he wants to overturn Obergefell and Pence wants to conversion therapy where they use shock therapy to try and "cure" you of being gay. Not to mention Pence signed one of the most homophobic bills into law. We didn't fight this far to be pushed back! Progress and equality must continue! Hillary may not be perfect, but she is our best bet at progress!
2 | Zabi Habash | 176 | 1553359904684034_1553361698017188 | Trump is a smart man with a deep understanding of what stupid people want. Trump is leading a cult not a movement. If trump ever makes it in...the USA can kiss every single tie with every nation goodbye. I've yet to hear one world leader say anything positive about this moron.
3 | Erick J. Sorto | 97 | 1553359904684034_1553361514683873 | Is that the same Trump that works for Putin? Because I've heard they treat LGBTQ people fantastic in Russia, so good that many are still in jail since the cold war.
4 | Charlotte Hodge | 27 | 1553359904684034_1553364884683536 | Donald Trump has a preliminary hearing on 12/16/2016 at 10 am in front of judge Ronnie Abrams at Manhattan federal court house the second time he's been charged with rape this time against a 13year old child.Child Rape...Case 1:16-CV-04642 US District Court Southern District of New York.
5 | Alex Mogo | 38 | 1553359904684034_1553361688017189 | There is not enough Bigot Vote for Trump to ever have a chance . We don't care if Hillary was emailing the devil, while snorting crack cocaine on the belly of an aborted fetus, while 3 midgets take turns giving her oral! Hillary in a landslide coming.
6 | Muhammad Talha | 33 | 1553359904684034_1553360461350645 | Remember when Obama said his administration would be the most transparent in history? Well thanks to Wikileaks's now they are, and now they're all pissed about it, liberal hypocrisy at its finest
7 | Steven Villarreal | 19 | 1553359904684034_1553361768017181 | Eight years ago the American people decided Hillary wasn't good enough to be President. They chose a lesser known, a lessor qualified person instead. Eight years later we know more than ever about Hillary's corruption. We know she destroy subpoenaed evidence. Why would anyone vote for this criminal?
8 | James Robinson | 13 | 1553359904684034_1553363284683696 | There is no proof Trump has ever been anti-LGBT. In contrast Clinton voted against gay marriage and equal rights on several occasions. Not that the Trump isn't a complete twat.
9 | Ylssel Renssor | 2 | 1553359904684034_1553375061349185 | He has a big cool aid smile w the upside flag he has no idea its upside down...just like the blacks and Latinos for Trump signs being held by white people. At least if he's gonna fake it make it look real and don't fk it up. Lmao.
10 | Asia A Garrett | 4 | 1553359904684034_1553366914683333 | Lol planted flag.....so typical. I don't know a whole lot about the LGBT flag but even I knew it was upside down. What an insult.
11 | Joe Reusser | 0 | 1553359904684034_1553375791349112 | Can we talk about real news NBC?  Honestly.  It's all focused on the election, and it's all negative-Trump and negative-GOP all day everyday.  It's a real big world, there's plenty of other topics you can throw in my newsfeed.  Stop trying to brainwashing the public. Start presenting fair and unbiased facts on both parties, or continue down your path of turning your once incredibly mighty media empire into nothing more than a supermarket tabloid.  This completely liberal biased coverage over the last 2 years has been nothing more than a joke.  You're losing credibility and viewers by the day.  And frankly, NBC, you aren't the media powerhouse that you were 20 years ago.  Keep this garbage journalism up and you'll be nothing more than The Sun, trying to sell advertising through some rag that people laugh at as they read the sensational headlines, but are way too smart to actually buy when they go through the Wal-Mart checkstands...
12 | Michael Alan Smith | 0 | 1553359904684034_1553379831348708 | If Trump had burned the American Flag he'd of recieved praise from the left, but God forbid someone unfurl it improperly. He could take money from countries that execute members of LGBT community like Hillary has.

20 | Mike Cheremsak | 3 | 1553359904684034_1553365724683452 | So, what do all these Hillary supporters think about the money she receives on a regular basis from the countries that regularly suppress, invite violence, and murder gays? Oh, that's ok though. How about the 30-40 times Hillary has said that she doesn't recognize gay marriage, and that marriage should between only a man and woman. Oh, that's ok though. Because Donald Trump was never called a racist, bigot, or homophobe in the 35 years he's been in the public eye; until he ran for President.
21 | Alain Matz | 2 | 1553359904684034_1553366768016681 | Vote for Trump! He'll make sure you can't get married and businesses can discriminate against you. But no one is a bigger fan of gays than Trump.

Donald J. Trump has urged his supporters to closely monitor voting in "certain areas"‚Äî widely understood as a reference to minority neighborhoods.

4 | Thomas Entrican | 24 | 1553326584687366_1553330368020321 | Please! Who's being the racist here? Keep your code words to yourself NBC. Everybody knows voter fraud starts with democratic graveside voter registrations.
5 | Maxine Nodel | 14 | 1553326584687366_1553332088020149 | When Trump accuses the election of being rigged, he's just psychologically projecting exactly what he's doing!! This narcissist will do ANYTHING to get elected!
6 | Bob Kellerman | 7 | 1553326584687366_1553330554686969 | You can bet that in open carry States there will be guys on the sidewalk with guns and threatening looks on their faces at Black and Hispanic neighborhood polling places.PS all the talk about voter fraud is really about intimidation there have only been 33 proven cases of people cheating
7 | Gaines Liner | 9 | 1553326584687366_1553331738020184 | Liberals are on the ropes with their ridiculously flawed candidate and are swinging wildly hoping that something sticks. This time they go with their oldest ploy.... "You're a racist." They really are vile human beings.

9 | Randall Horvath | 3 | 1553326584687366_1553341831352508 | Funny how the dems call foul because someone wants to watch over them? How are you going to intimidate someone when the walk inside and go privately behind the curtain? No different than the brinks money trucks...they have two drivers in each truck for security and to watch the other guy. Hillary is about done, your girl has failed you all.
10 | Jenny Scott | 4 | 1553326584687366_1553330001353691 | And, in Minnesota at least, it is illegal for people to try to hang around a polling place - whether trying to intimidate voters or not - without written authorization from the State. Which means, it'll be election judges who are now forced to tell people they have to leave, which increases the likelihood of confrontation and violence. As an election judge... gee, thanks.

15 | LK Morris | 1 | 1553326584687366_1553363568017001 | So Trump's supporters can't watch poll participation, but Bill and Hillary can show up to polling places and take selfies with supporters? Yeah...that seems fair. #doublestandards #rigged
16 | Gaines Liner | 5 | 1553326584687366_1553332421353449 | There's nothing that anyone can do to intimidate a polling station like the black panthers did. But you weren't concerned about that were you NBC?

When do we hear you and sister News stations tell the Truth about Clinton being excused of CRIMES so far due to Obama ordering FBI to back off as well as constant PARDONS "about 17 of them so far" and NOT BECAUSE THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE? Also, can you direct me to a reliable and truthful News Media? Thank you!

Thiel claims that his endorsement of Trump has "surfaced a small number of those people who all feel that they can't say it in public."

1 | Kie Cochran | 299 | 1553284138024944_1553285928024765 | Trump is not a candidate. He is a pathologically narcissistic cult leader. He has the one gift of persuading his followers to suspend common sense and believe in him.
2 | Tiger Yi | 199 | 1553284138024944_1553286991357992 | Because billionaires can benefit a lot from tax cut under Trump policy. Trump won't support middle class and those at bottom. Trump supporters, you are not one of billionaires and in fact you can't afford Trump Hotel so why you all support Trump?
3 | Jonathan Langen | 59 | 1553284138024944_1553289508024407 | Crazy that in the United States there are those that are actually afraid to voice their support for a candidate because liberals are so intolerant of every opinion that doesn't match their own

6 | Jerry Martin | 9 | 1553284138024944_1553312771355414 | It really is reversed, I am a democrat and fear what the hate filled followers of trump would do to me. At least I can still vote in secret to voice my opinion. If trump wins I may not have that privalege for long. What a millonaire thinks, doesn't mean anymore to me than what the fellow that carries out my groceries thinks.
7 | Joel Robards | 14 | 1553284138024944_1553287721357919 | I "read" (I'm not saying it's true) that the FBI is after Huma for her ties to Muslim terrorist organizations, specifically the Muslim Brotherhood who has ties to her family in Saudi Arabia. Supposedly she had access to classified documents that she didn't have clearance for. And that she was  (possibly) sending intel to Islamic terrorist operatives using Weiner's computer. We'll see if it's true or not.
8 | Sheri Faye Sherman | 16 | 1553284138024944_1553300051356686 | These Silicon Valley Trump supporters feel they can't say that they endorse Trump in public, because they know deep down it is wrong to put a histrionic, narcissistic, misogynistic fascist in the White House. These bright minds must have skipped history class because their arrogance told them it wasn't as important as their technology. These are the educated ignorant that will help ruin our country for personal gain.
9 | Brandon Johnson | 5 | 1553284138024944_1553305864689438 | I doubt that powerful and wealthy people in Silicon Valley became powerful and wealthy by keeping their mouth shut and not standing up for something. If they support Trump, they'd be proud to come out and put their boatloads of money where their mouths are.
10 | Michael David | 4 | 1553284138024944_1553306214689403 | Wait a minute I thought that all of the deplorable's were stupid dumb rednecks. Well I guess this doesn't fit the liberal douchebags stereotype does it!
11 | Jim Geddis | 6 | 1553284138024944_1553302271356464 | Who cares who someone supports or doesn't support it's there right as a person and voter to support whoever he or she wants to support, right or wrong in someone else mind. That all should not matter, what should matter is if you got your butt out the doors and choose to vote for whoever it is your supporting on November 8th. Win or lose .. best of luck to whom ever wins. I believe are country is full of great people and is a great country, so instead of hiding behind a computer screen and hating on someone else for there views, get out the door on November 8th and make your vote count is all I can say.
12 | Dan Lawler | 1 | 1553284138024944_1553310711355620 | Of course, there are many that would like to put a bumper sticker, a window decal, or sign in their yard supporting trump, but don't because of the likelihood of getting their car keyed, something destroyed by the loving free speech supporting democrats!
13 | Michael J. Piper | 6 | 1553284138024944_1553296871357004 | A 1.25 million dollar contribution to HRC? Hardly a blip on the media radar. A 1.25 million dollar contribution to DJT? Priceless publicity. That seems to me to be closer to the real reason he did it.
14 | Kindra Gripp Godwin | 2 | 1553284138024944_1553309941355697 | This is true for a lot of people. Tbey just don't want to admit that they are supporting him. The same happened with Reagan, he was polling low but cleaned house and won. That's because people were ashamed to say they supported him. I see this with this election.
15 | Ena Riden | 4 | 1553284138024944_1553303428023015 | Simply they don't want to pay taxes like Chumpy. That's why others don't want say in public, if they announce they support him, they are boycotted or people will understand why.
16 | Debbie Pollack DeKalb | 1 | 1553284138024944_1553322678021090 | We will know who you are, though, you misogynistic, racist, haters, and we will not forget. I will never allow someone to get away with making biased, ignorant remarks again. I will stand up to every bully I encounter. I will push back against every groper I encounter. I will not go quietly into that good night!
17 | Robert Moriarity | 2 | 1553284138024944_1553315224688502 | Yep. Ive got lots of people who are bigly behind trump, I just can't tell you now. But it will be great. It must be some kind of virus and trump is the carrier.
18 | Frank Valdez | 1 | 1553284138024944_1553328868020471 | Smart not to say it in public.. would hurt businesses since trump the child molestor stands for so much bad.. I wish there was a database that we could search trump supporters so when we are hiring candidates we could just disqualify them instantly..
19 | Cristina Ibanez Pando | 1 | 1553284138024944_1553335204686504 | Billionaires like Thiel don't have consciences, they don't love America, that's why they support that sex-predator, tax evader, misogynistic criminal who scams students (trump univ) and rapes teen-age girls while gropes all women at his scope.
20 | Marie Jackson | 1 | 1553284138024944_1553350838018274 | Yea, they are pretty much a group of people without good social senses...   just self serving IT people that should have had some liberal arts and social studies in the making of their credentials.  Silicon Valley workers pretty much are  destroying the San Francisco neighborhoods and cultures too.  And they want that billionaire tax break Trump is promising.
21 | Manny Tan Sy | 2 | 1553284138024944_1553330214687003 | As an entrepreneur thst we can understand the feelings trump in good intension for the country of America, why ? He can create jobs as an experience self made business . Not from a grandfather textile factory of Hillary , this out of range to mention " as a businesswomen." According to other people. Vote trump with out doubt. Vote trump .
22 | Edward Lucky Narans | 1 | 1553284138024944_1553337881352903 | Worst speech reader ever.  Sounded like a second grader reading the theory of relativity. Appeared to regularly lose his place on the TelePrompTer.  Positive for trump though is it Made trump look like an amazing speaker. Lol
23 | Julie Ostergard | 3 | 1553284138024944_1553305901356101 | hope he suffers a severe back lash, someone in his position should be a little brighter than falling for dtrump idiocy!! hard to believe these people would sleep with the devil to avoid paying Taxes, so un-American üòà
24 | Meresa Salisbury | 1 | 1553284138024944_1553310304688994 | #Trump states things that SHOULDN'T be said in public (or even thought of for that matter).  What a ridiculous thing to say.  I wonder what kind of discrimination happens at these silicone valley businesses.
25 | Jeanne Clevenger | 3 | 1553284138024944_1553302981356393 | Hillary has nobody to blame but herself for installing a private server in her home.

A senior FBI official told NBC News that Comey's concerns were based on the potential impact on any related investigation, not specifically the U.S. elections.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Calvin Anderson | 108 | 1553264508026907_1553265914693433 | That's what I say is crazy the FBI director told his agents not to talk about Russia working with Donald Trump to undermine our election but yet he comes after Hillary Clinton on her emails government conspiracy trying to rig the election the FBI director knows Donald Trump is working with the Russians and he knows Donald Trump is working with the KKK and the Nazis but why didn't he announce that to the public
2 | Darb Sigrah | 61 | 1553264508026907_1553265601360131 | A week ago, NBC and the ENTIRE Democratic Party were praising him because he saved their candidate. You people are pathetic.

Corruption about Democrats and Hillary have no end! This proves that Hillary and the whole party, its employees, is corrupt and false!
4 | Lisa Ledford | 17 | 1553264508026907_1553267521359939 | I don't understand why no one has brought up that fact that OBAMA used a pseudonym - his hands are dirty too - why would he do that unless he knew she was breaking the law with unsecure illegal servers- they need to do search on what he said in the infamous emails

6 | Philip Holt | 1 | 1553264508026907_1553319398021418 | its ok for  FBI Director James Comey argued against publicly disclosing the U.S. intelligence community's conclusion that Russia was behind hacks into U.S. political institutions, highly placed sources told NBC News on Monday.A former senior law enforcement official with detailed knowledge of the matter said on condition of anonymity that Comey argued that disclosing that operatives based in Russia were behind the widespread hacking not only might interfere with the U.S. election but also could violate Justice Department guidelines.Comey's opposition to the Russia report was first disclosed Monday by CNBC, which said Comey was concerned about being seen as interfering with next week's general election.
7 | Darren Blough | 7 | 1553264508026907_1553282081358483 | I swear you guys believe anything you're told. There is not one shred of evidence Russia did anything. Just because Hillary says it doesn't make it true. Russia is being used as a political tool to shift focus from an investigation. Putin's biggest crime is wanting to work with us against terrorists instead of giving them weopons and shipping them to sovereign countries to commit genocide for our selfish interests. Hillary = more war. Before you start bashing Trump instead of researching my statements, I do not endorse Trump. The fact these two idiots are the best we as a nation can come up with is extremely sad.
8 | Scot Hecker | 4 | 1553264508026907_1553289078024450 | Just so I have this straight NBC News..The goal is ,to blame Russia for hacking emails and exposing all of Hillary's corruption..So it's not Hillary's fault she's corrupt ,it's Russia's..Russia hacked Hillary's email and placed those emails on Weiners laptop in a folder marked life insurance.. Man those Russia's are great hackers..Then Trump somehow had something to do with all of this happening to rig the elections..
9 | Mark Anthony Ramirez | 5 | 1553264508026907_1553276008025757 | Get ready for it folks. Its time for the media and Liberal politicians to pull out all the stops. They will say and do absolutely anything they can possibly think of to blame the Conservatives of destroying the world. It happens every single election. I certainly hope the voters are smart enough to do their own homework rather than blindly believing everything they hear.
10 | Devvon Mayherrun | 7 | 1553264508026907_1553274891359202 | Comey went from a sellout and a Dem hero to a Russian traitor over night, lmao you guys and your excuses. She's the biggest criminal to ever seek office, why is that so hard to accept
11 | Mark Anthony | 2 | 1553264508026907_1553283768024981 | There sure are a lot of hearsay being reported by the main stream media. What happened to investigative journalism for facts before reporting? I also ponder, how many defamation of character suites are filed against the media?
12 | Wendi Sargent | 1 | 1553264508026907_1553275334692491 | Nancy S. WroteTHE STORY OF HILLARY IN A NUT SHELLA "MUST READ"To all of us, who are glued to the news, watching the election, the story unfolds as written by its author, Hillary Clinton.  She just couldn‚Äôt sit still and mind her own business.  After leaving the White House, she could have had a wonderful life.  She and Bill could have made millions in honest and decent ways.  Instead, the temptation to make hundreds of millions was too hard to resist.  She started to sell her influence, probably a little at first and it grew.Eventually, the Clintons started to get some huge payments with her run against Obama with the likelihood that she would run a better campaign later.  As Secretary of State, there was more influence to sell through the Clinton Foundation and through payments for speeches.  She probably prompted some of the largest payments into the multimillions by telling her donors that she was going to run for the presidency.  It worked.  Why else would Saudi Arabia donate more than $25 Million?  These donors were gambling, they played the odds, and Hillary had to play the part.  She had to run for president.  She would have been as good as dead if she didn‚Äôt even try. So, there she was, not knee deep, but over her head with Bill and even involving her daughter, running a criminal enterprise selling influence.  She was on a path which she could no longer abandon. This middle class woman was no innocent victim.  Her greed and her ego were in step with the pragmatic need to run for president.   As she and Bill were experienced presidents, she knew all the tricks to get into office, and she knew all the mischief she could inflict once she became the Queen of the kingdom.  She set this whole thing in motion, and just like the murderers we watch on Forensic Files, she thought that she was smart enough to get away with crimes about as serious as murder.  She rationalized just as criminals do.As with other criminals, once she was used to running her influence selling organization, after a while, she thought that she would never get caught.  After all, Bill had been the President of the United States, and his and her prestige put them on a platform of impenetrability.  Unfortunately, for her, like most criminals, she could not anticipate every turn, every person, every nook and cranny.  She probably would have gotten away with her crimes if she would have stayed as private as possible, but she just couldn‚Äôt just leave it alone.  She had to go public by running for the office of the President of the United States.  She had to put herself under a microscope.Now she is getting caught.She didn‚Äôt anticipate her mistakes or that someone like Donald J. Trump would come along to expose her criminality.  While we are watching the election, seeing the beginning of the rise of Donald J. Trump, we are also going to see the decline of Hillary Clinton and what has literally turned into a crime family.   She is desperate.  Her back is against a wall.  She has about half of the population and most people who matter totally involved.  One problem she has, though, is that her mentality has evolved and grown.  Once a person strays far from the path of decency, her criminal mentality leads to more and more actions which are off the wall.  She arranged for violent protestors to attend Trump rallies.  She probably arranged for false testimony from Mr. Khan and the women who claimed Donald J. Trump groped them.  She had no hesitation in labeling a decent man to be a bigot and a racist.  She did so well that almost half of America thinks extremely poorly about Donald J. Trump.  She was getting away with all this, too.Alas she made one mistake which was the beginning of her downfall.To make sure that there would be no criminal charges against her, Hillary orchestrated the payment of more than $675,000 to one of Director Comey‚Äôs trusted agents.  Due to Wikileaks, she got caught on this one.When James Comey decided to not prosecute, I had suggested that, in time, he would be ultimately seen as an American hero, the kind who used to be played by Jimmy Stewart.  He is probably a decent honest man who delegated responsibilities to his trusted men and women, and who believed what they reported.No doubt, Agent McCabe‚Äôs wife received this sum which is huge for an FBI agent, and then, Agent McCabe used his influence to wiggle his way to manage the investigation of Hillary Clinton‚Äôs emails.  It is no wonder she had such confidence that she would never be caught.  She had infiltrated the FBI  Now, we are just past the point in the typical Forensic Files case where the police have heard allegations of unimaginable criminality from a prior president (and wife) of the United States.  The police and almost half of America could not believe that someone with all that stature would become a head of a master criminal enterprise.  Their imaginations just couldn‚Äôt recognize something as ridiculous to be something which is tragically true.  Now, James Comey knows that she infiltrated his organization and corrupted one of his most trusted agents.  Once the police know who committed the crime, or in this case that there was a crime, they get on the path to prove and prosecute their case.  For so long, Director Comey was fed lies and he relied on the false information provided by Mr. McCabe.  Now, we are at the point where the police are looking at Hillary‚Äôs emails like a pack of hounds.  They are seeing the dark side. Now that Director Comey knows of the bribery, the bloom is off the rose.  She is exposed.  The police know that she is guilty.  Now, they are moving at rocket speed.  I am sure that Agent McCabe is no longer in charge of the investigation.  Other agents, honest ones, are hitting it as fast and as thoroughly as possible.Now, it is just a matter of time.  The FBI are on to her, and she is so guilty of so much, she will be exposed, hopefully before the election.  After all, she wants all the evidence put ‚Äúon the table.‚Äù  She may get her wish.I doubt that they will be able to get things together fast enough, but there is a possibility that she will be charged and arrested before the election.Now, Hillary is able to put her mind out of reality when she performs her rally act, but there must be moments in the day when reality clicks in and she gets frightened.  She must be waking up at 2:00 o‚Äôclock in the morning in a cold sweat.  She knows that Mr. Comey knows.  She knows that she is going to get caught.  Her only hope is to become president fast enough and control the process.  Mr. Comey is a true American hero who will pull the plug before that can happen.  In fact, his annoucement last week may have done the trick.Donald J. Trump is right.  This is worse than Watergate.  This is unbelievably worse.  This is an American tragedy, which even Shakespeare couldn‚Äôt have written.As lawyers say, ‚ÄúThe truth will out.‚Äù  Hillary Clinton is a criminal who has grown to a level we see only in comic books.  At this point, her goose is cooked.Watch her at her rallies as she plays her part.  Too bad that she has so many surrogates (some completely innocent) who speak for her.  In this regard, we will see if the Obamas continue to support her.  How did she get them to join her campaign?  Will we find that she corrupted them, too?One way or another, this is one of the greatest stories in American history.  Thankfully, we have Donald J. Trump to fix so much at this point.[If you appreciate this post, please do what you can to spread it.  Share it, Tweet it.  Email it.  Please get this word out.]
13 | Sandra Austin | 1 | 1553264508026907_1553303031356388 | I'm weary of this whole 2016 election - both major party candidates are a disgrace and embarrassment to our country. The whole process has been ridiculous and nothing but mudslinging, back and forth accusations, lies, and neither with any promising solutions to issues of importance domestically and on the world front. My only flicker of light is the knowledge that one or the other (whoever wins) can be replaced in four years and hopefully our country won't be totally destroyed in the mean time.

20 | Brad Henson | 3 | 1553264508026907_1553274384692586 | Remember when Obama said his administration would be the most transparent in history? Well thanks to Wikileaks's now they are, and now they're all pissed about it, liberal hypocrisy at its finest

Right now, 12 states and the District of Columbia offer Medicaid programs covering transition-related care, according to the NCTE. But that leaves 38 states with none.

1 | Ryan Spencer | 75 | 1553245091362182_1553247338028624 | Why should we offer gender transition through paid tax dollars aka medicaide? I can understand Food stamps hud housing and Medicaid but how is gender transition a necessity? Oh I know I'm heartless blah blah blah.
2 | Andrea Diaz | 57 | 1553245091362182_1553253678027990 | If you wanna change your dingaling to a hooha by all means go for it..but save up your own pretty pennies and stop expecting the public to bend over backwards and fix your gender issues.
3 | Cari Browne | 37 | 1553245091362182_1553253811361310 | There are severely disabled children on the list for medicaid waivers for years. They keep saying they don't have enough money. Where is all this new money coming from?
4 | Edith Sanders-Gipson | 30 | 1553245091362182_1553251708028187 | Lord Jesus, please help this nation of people who believe  they can undo what you have created! It is not my desire to have my tax dollars wasted on such evilness!
5 | Adri Alaniz | 22 | 1553245091362182_1553257524694272 | Isn't that considered a cosmetic surgery .? When kids and adults can't even get there teeth fixed or certain surgeries because they're considered cosmetic surgeries but this isn't? Not seeing how this makes any sense at all! In this case ever mother should be given a tummy tuck after giving birth and if a child needs braces or adults it should be covered there are many more cosmetic surgeries that should be covered .
6 | Carrie Jo | 5 | 1553245091362182_1553287294691295 | I can't afford to go to the doctor when I'm sick or need surgery myself to be healthy but they will pay for someone on Medicaid to change their gender because they feel like it...Nice
7 | Tonya Taylor | 3 | 1553245091362182_1553310198022338 | But Medicaid doesn't cover adult eye exams and eyeglasses??? So I can be blind at my own expense with no assistance, but I can receive coverage for elective gender transition?
8 | Lucas Allison | 1 | 1553245091362182_1553353771351314 | Medicaid covering gender surgeries, but deny coverage to people who have REAL medical problems , this is the kind of junk democrats approve and push and yes I know there are some RINO's who go along with this. This is elective surgery, just like a face lift or tummy tuck and absolutely tax dollars should not be wasted.

1 | Irene Shaw | 1001 | 1553201884699836_1553220321364659 | I am honestly going to miss the Obamas so much. They are such genuine people, and they are some of the most kind. They don't see themselves as superior to the average citizen, they are just like us. A loving family that values each other, rather than status. Even if it's something as simple as giving out candy on Halloween, they still go out of their way to be there for us. Love them‚ù§ I'm sure Trump supporters will have something negative to say about this. What else can you expect from miserable creatures!
2 | Lisa Keeslar | 521 | 1553201884699836_1553233448030013 | It's Halloween and kids dancing to a classic HALLOWEEN song!!! Get over your politicsl views for a 2 minuttes and appreciate

4 | Faye Porter | 142 | 1553201884699836_1553230564696968 | Can't y'all lighten up for one flippin' FB post and just enjoy the scene? Whoever wins, everyone could benefit by a return to civility and at least an agreement that we can all enjoy each other's kids instead of constantly yelling the same old, tired, partisan, media sound bytes. The world won't end if you just smile at this post or scroll on past.
5 | Meredith Cable | 138 | 1553201884699836_1553234171363274 | This is so wonderful. I am really going to miss the Obamas. Their kindness, their class, their unapologetic love of American children. Well done Kids..Michael would be honored!

7 | Tebkap Pak | 88 | 1553201884699836_1553219108031447 | Remember when Trump was laughed at for saying Hillary had the questions ahead of time? Remember when he said Weiner had access to Hillary's classified emails? Remember when he said Hillary cheated Bernie out of the nomination BEFORE wikileaks confirmed it. Trumps been right about everything from the start.
8 | Jp Hernandez | 46 | 1553201884699836_1553240978029260 | President Obama is a loooosa. His dances are terrible folks, believe me. My dances, on the other hand, are beautiful. They have tremendous success. They're probably the best dances in the history of dances. My dances are winners. Everyday when I travel America, I literally have millions and millions of people ask me why don't we have beautiful dances. When I'm President, we'll have beautiful dances. They'll be huuuge. They'll be handled by the best dance handlers ever, believe me. Our dances will have tremendous success. The dances will be beautiful, believe me.
9 | Anna Brousseau | 27 | 1553201884699836_1553254261361265 | Omg is there anything you people can say good about the Obama's they are what love and respect and family commitment stand for maybe if you really take a good look and leave your hate and predjudice behind and take a long look at that family you would learn something positive
10 | Kimberly Dillehunt | 33 | 1553201884699836_1553247024695322 | Can't you shut your crap mouth and enjoy the kids. I watched this live and it was great! Take a Xanax and do a shot of tequila and just sit down and relax.

You do realize these kids are predominately white. I've seen references to monkeys, low income housing....I mean, has your racism now extended to your own children.

Here are the answers to some of the key questions surrounding the latest email saga related to the probe of Hillary Clinton's private server.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Rockwell Torrey | 90 | 1553199148033443_1553199221366769 | This is your moment. This is your time to take a stand. When your grandchildren speak of you they will recount that you stood for America. You did not surrender. You did not run away. You held strong for freedom and the Constitution. You defeated Hillary Clinton. You voted Trump. You ensured that America survived.
2 | John Bryan | 68 | 1553199148033443_1553202188033139 | NBC IS A JOKE!!! You keep trying to cover for criminal corruption. Hillary lost my vote!!! Because she showed me how much corruption is surrounding her and continues to surround clintons. I'm scared if she is elected she will definitely be impeached and then jailed. How is that going to look on America? Since Bernie is gone too and sold us out. I'm staying at home or voting for Trump.
3 | Jodi M Ritchie | 26 | 1553199148033443_1553209191365772 | Harry Reid is one of the most corrupt Democrats in Office. HE is the one throwing the implications around about Trump, in Direct violation of the Hatch Act, himself. The FBI has stated that they have not gone through all of the emails found on the computer because they stumbled upon it accidentally while investigating the spouse of Hillary's top aid for sexual sexually explicit emails to a 15 yr. Old. What they stumbled on was so egregious that they had to act immediately.
4 | Paul Desfosses | 14 | 1553199148033443_1553220694697955 | The Hatch act is not relevant, stop pushing your BS NBC. And oh by the way, the hatch act was enacted because of criminal, cheating democrats in the 30's, yes that's right the Democrats were corrupt for a long time...
5 | Phyl Burl | 8 | 1553199148033443_1553211508032207 | The FBI should've been much more responsible and winnowed through the emails FIRST instead of Comey making highly politicized statements and innuendo in order to influence the election due to his political affiliations.
6 | Valerie Lee | 24 | 1553199148033443_1553201731366518 | And she is not under investigation if you read the news. They don't have a clue yet if there's even anything about her in the darn emails. You find her guilty but you don't find him guilty of all he's done? He is by no means a good role model in any way, shape or form.
7 | Mark Hamm | 7 | 1553199148033443_1553224248030933 | True Americans this is our last chance. The Political Democrats are lying deceiving non Americans run by the 1% of the worlds elite with all the money to destroy our country with hate and big corruption. To keep the good people penned down right where they need us and with time no power to vote. The far left and with there illegally immigrants set up to cast votes we  will be out number sooner then we think, and breed Democrat votes from now on, and with our hard working Americans tax money supporting them. It is a disgrace to our way of life. We must fight back with the biggest outcome to Vote in history to overcome this sinister way of life, it will be a sad world if Hillary Clinton wins this election. God have mercy on the true Americans. We must vote Donald Trump üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
8 | Bobby Johnson | 5 | 1553199148033443_1553219894698035 | the man is just doing his job. he probably hasn't had much sleep since July either knowing what he did then was a bad decision.
9 | Mercedes Amelia MC | 9 | 1553199148033443_1553211224698902 | Anyone who equates Hillary Clinton‚Äôs ‚Äúissues‚Äù with Donald Trump‚Äôs Corruption has no idea of the facts. Consider, for example, Trump‚Äôs illegal contribution to Florida‚Äôs attorney general, Pam Bondi, after she received multiple complaints from Florida students that they were cheated by Trump University. Once she received a $25,000 donation from Trump, her office dropped the inquiry.Or Trump‚Äôs solicitation of campaign funds from foreign officials, in clear violation of federal campaign laws.Or Trump‚Äôs refusals to pay contractors who have done work for him, many of them small businesses.Or Trump University‚Äôs repeated scams.Or the Trump Network, a pyramid scheme in violation of federal securities regulations.Or Trump Model Management, which reportedly had foreign models lie to customs officials and work in the U.S. illegally.Or Trump‚Äôs employment of foreign guest workers at his resorts, claiming he couldn‚Äôt find Americans to do the work.Or Trump‚Äôs history of being charged with housing discrimination.Or Trump‚Äôs illegal dealings with Cuba while it was under embargo.Or Trump Foundation operating illegally.The list goes on. Donald Trump has a proven record of corruption. Hillary Clinton does not. Anyone who equates the two hasn't been paying attention.It would be nice to have an FBI investigation into these facts on Trump.(Jere). I agree! with Jere and I don't understand why Trump's errors and corruption are constantly ignored and this man laughs all including the FBI that instead of doing their job, create intrigue to favor Republicans. I VOTED FOR " HILLARY CLINTON " BLUE ALL THE WAY.

11 | Kevin Couture | 11 | 1553199148033443_1553201761366515 | Very Interesting .... FBI Director James Comey argued privately that it was too close to Election Day for the United States government to name Russia as meddling in the U.S. election and ultimately ensured that the FBI's name was not on the document that the U.S. government put out, a former bureau official tells CNBC ... The official said some government insiders are perplexed as to why Comey would have election timing concerns with the Russian disclosure but not with the Huma Abedin email discovery disclosure he made Friday.
12 | Michael McDonald | 0 | 1553199148033443_1553306104689414 | Its not Comey that violated the Hatch act. It was Loretta Lynch that tried to quash the investigation so as not to negatively influance Hillaries Campaign. Comey made sure that didn't happen. I"m sure if she is charged with violating the Hatch act she will also take the 5th. Like she did with the Irainean money for hostages scheme.

Chances are, you've seen at least a few of your Facebook friends check in at Standing Rock today, but they're likely not in North Dakota. Here's why they're doing it.

2 | BEn Skocik | 39 | 1553143371372354_1553150511371640 | It shows that your gov and police work for the corporations and not the people because if the police stood with the citizens they would be arresting the criminals trespassing on natives land but instead they are terrorizing the citizens
3 | Dana Van Becelaere-Cadotte | 9 | 1553143371372354_1553275051359186 | Sadly, that sheriff's department is lying. As a military policeman I use FB posts and check-ins as a way of tracking down subjects and victims. That department is definitely doing the same thing. Law enforcement will use anything at their disposal to get what they need accomplished. Especially if it doesn't cost us a dime.

If there is a reservation here in the Northwest that doesn't look like a dump, show me. You know when you hit Tulalip or Puyallup. It's not like all of a sudden you have stumbled across a land that would make you envy the dump. Sometimes I wonder just why they are doing it? Setting a tire and a car on fire, tell me again how that helps Mother Earth?

12 | Ronald Dye | 1 | 1553143371372354_1553327234687301 | Last night a friend claimed that Donald Trump wouldn‚Äôt make a good president; he is brash, he is racist, he is a loudmouth; you know the normal things people learn to recite after being programmed by television news. The one I loved was that, ‚ÄúTrump is arrogant.‚Äù My friend questioned if one man could make ‚Äúthat much difference in the world today.‚Äù To my friend's credit, she was respectful enough to let me respond when she asked, ‚ÄúReally, what has Trump done?‚ÄùI said, ‚ÄúIn June of last year, Trump entered the race for president. In just a little over a year, Trump has single handedly defeated the Republican party. He did so thoroughly. In fact, he did so in such a resounding way that the Republican Party now suffers from an identity crisis. He literally dismantled the party. Trump even dismantled and dismissed the brand and value of the Bush family.Trump has Obama petrified that Trump will dismiss programs that weren‚Äôt properly installed using proper law.Trump has single handedly debunked and disemboweled any value of news media as we knew it‚Äînews now suffering from an all-time level of distrust and disrespect.Trump has leaders from all over the world talking about him, whether good or bad. Trust me, powerful men who have been president before weren‚Äôt liked by the global community. I doubt Mikhail Gorbachev liked Reagan when Reagan said, "Tear down that wall."Trump has expressly disclosed the fraud perpetrated on the American public by Hillary Clinton. He has, quite literally, brought Hillary to her knees‚Äîif you believe that nervous tension and disorders offer physical side effects and damage.Trump has unified the silent majority in a way that should be patently frightening to ‚Äúliberals.‚ÄùAs the press accuses Trump of being a house of cards, Trump has proven the press is the real house of cards. He has whipped up the entire establishment into pure panic. Trump has exposed them for who they are and worse, what they are. George Clooney was right when he said Trump draws live news coverage of his podium that he‚Äôs not yet approached. Thanks, George, you were perfectly correct.What we see as headline news today are actually the last bubbles from the ship that is now sunk‚Äîmeaning the standard news media, as a propaganda machine, has been exposed. They have no more value.In the same way Trump asked the African-American community this question, I asked my friend, ‚ÄùAt this point, what do you have to lose?‚Äù We have mass cop shootings, riots in our streets, ambushed cops, double digit inflation, bombs blowing up in our cities, targeted police, #BLM, a skyrocketing jobless rate, no economic growth, privately owned land being seized by the federal government, the worst racial tension in my lifetime, no God in schools, more abortions than ever, illegal aliens pouring into our country, sick veterans receiving no care, and a debt that doubled in seven years to $19 trillion. Are you really happy with the condition of the current system?One man has done all of this in one year‚Äîone guy, and on his own dime. And with everything I‚Äôve written above, you believe Trump hasn't done anything? You claim that you are afraid of Donald Trump? No wonder we‚Äôre in trouble. You can say that Trump is a lousy presidential candidate. That‚Äôs your right. Just don‚Äôt ever say he‚Äôs not effective.That Megan Kelly, FOX News, CNN, MSNBC, Washington Post, Rachel Maddow, the Huffington Post, the New York Times, Raleigh‚Äôs News and Observer, the AP, Don Lemon, Jake Tapper, and many more, failed to implement their collectively orchestrated lie on the American people against Trump, is actually a massive testament to Trump. The press colluded pure propaganda to accomplish his demise ‚Ä¶ and they have collectively failed and miserably.Here's just one example of how badly America is injured right now. There are high school football players on their knees during the national anthem simply because the press used as propaganda to program those kids to do that very thing. But, these kids are mimicking NFL stars the same way the same kids chooses which brand of football shoe to purchase‚Äîthey're overtly brain-washed to do that very thing.Now, we have a generation of children who hate America.America‚Äôs problem isn‚Äôt that little children are on their knee in collective disrespect of America. Our problem is that America is on her knee from collective disrespect by Americans.You can disrespect America all you want. But, it‚Äôs high-time you respect the silent majority. Because they‚Äôre not simply the ‚Äúsilent majority‚Äù as you‚Äôve been trained to believe when Hillary calls them ‚Äúdeplorables.‚Äù The fact is, they are simply the majority. And now they're no longer silent either. Donald Trump changed all of that, single-handedly and within one yearRonald Dye replied to Connie Kirk Centers's comment.

Researchers found that the greatest increase over time was among children 1 to 4 years in age.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Colin Guthrie | 5 | 1553124151374276_1553131078040250 | I think part of this is rooted in our zest for opioid laced medication, and overuse of opioid medication, starting with adults, but it's use with children. The drug is a controlled substance, and doctors prescribe it like it is candy. Several questions come into mind, why was the medication prescribed, and what alternatives were discussed with whoever needed it? Alternatives with zero addiction issues should be used, and addressing the actual cause for pain without using drugs at all.
2 | Kiki Hemphill | 9 | 1553124151374276_1553127634707261 | Parents/adults need to be held accountable when/if they leave powerful medications laying around for a small child to overdose on........It's the same as leaving a loaded gun around.
3 | Michael Krska | 0 | 1553124151374276_1553146191372072 | Wait till they turn 10 years old and can reach the top shelf if the medicine cabinet. Then they sell the pills at school in larger numbers than the accidental overdoses.Oops were not covering that story because November is medical Marijuana voting for a number of states and nobody's ever overdosed on that. 25 Opioid deaths a month per state at 50 states and that's the adult numbers. Sorry Big Pharma but you didn't pay me to keep quiet. Just the media. Vote medical Marijuana and save some Lives. I didn't say recreational I said medical.

5 | Jeanne Clevenger | 2 | 1553124151374276_1553139298039428 | With a Trump presidency, we can look forward to closed borders and a reduction in illegal drugs being brought in from Mexico. We can also look forward to the criminal illegal immigrants, many involved in the drug trade, being returned to Mexico and not being allowed respite in sanctuary cities or allowed back in our country at the borders. It is sad how far American values have fallen in the last decade.

10 | Kathy Bertrand | 22 | 1553094868043871_1553096234710401 | I found this post and it's right on the money so tell us what is good about Donald Trump‚Äôs presidency which will ‚Äúsignificantly‚Äù weaken the country, his tax cuts would add 9.5 Trillion to the debt,  driving the U.S. into a ‚Äúlengthy recession‚Äù with nearly 3.5 million job losses and a 7 percent unemployment rate, according to a Moody‚Äôs Analytics analysis.The tax code under Mr. Trump‚Äôs plan will be much less progressive than the current tax code. More than one-third of the proposed tax cuts on personal income will go to the top 1% of income earners, with the average taxpayer in this group receiving a reduction in their tax bill of $275,000. Taxpayers in the bottom 99% of income earners will receive a tax cut of less than $2,500.Under Trump's plan, the conservative Tax Foundation expects that the bottom 80 percent of Americans will see just 0.8 percent to 1.8 percent more income after his tax cuts. Clinton's plan will only increase taxes for America's wealthiest earners.The large increase in tariffs on Chinese and Mexican imports supported by Mr. Trump further exacerbates inflation pressures. The U.S. imports nearly $500 billion in goods a year from China, and another almost $300 billion from Mexico, accounting for approximately 35% of total U.S. non-petroleum goods imports. Outside of Canada, no other country comes close as a source of imports. Slapping a 45% tariff on Chinese imports and 35% on non-petroleum Mexican imports thus increases overall goods import prices by approximately 15%.would most likely retaliate with in-kind tariffs on U.S. imports. This would be a big hit to U.S. exports, as we ship well over $100 billion in products a year to China, and almost $250 billion to Mexico.And the problem with trumps outspoken approach to Mexican immigration, his ‚Äúplan‚Äù to deport 11 million undocumented immigrants would shrink the economy by about 2 percent, according to American Action Forum (AAF), a conservative and pro-business think tank. The sudden subtraction of 7 million workers would cause an immediate shock to thousands of businesses, triggering a GDP collapse ranging from $400 billion to $600 billion in productionNot to overlook Donald Trump who casts himself as a protector of workers and jobs, but a USA TODAY NETWORK investigation found hundreds of people ‚Äì carpenters, dishwashers, painters, even his own lawyers ‚Äì who say he didn‚Äôt pay them for their work. And uses undocumented labor along with Chinese Steel over American for his hotels and resorts !

16 | Nick Nicholas | 6 | 1553094868043871_1785944261667983 | Breaking news. NBCNews did NOT report about Bill's trip to Russia while Hillary was Secretary of State to speak to a Russian investment firm, which paid him 500k. Also had meeting with Putin that led to the 20% uranium deal. Feel free to fact check.
17 | Sue Kraimer | 3 | 1553094868043871_752355488236223 | Oh please!! Is this really the best you've got?! What a joke! You have utterly ignored Hillary's ties to other countries, but the best you have on Trump is a guy who doesn't even work for him anymore?! WHO CARES?! Sit down NBC. You should rest after being neutered by Donald J. Trump, and members of your own political party.
18 | Ray Muccianti | 13 | 1553094868043871_1553106431376048 | Not looking into John Podesta, Hillary's campaign chair person, who lobbies Washington on behalf of Putin's Russian bank Sberbank which was named in the Panama papers? Russia is running her campaign! Oh, Podesta also works as a Public Relations representative of the Saudi Dictatorship. So they have a piece of her campaign too! How awesome!
19 | Stephen Sutter | 4 | 1553094868043871_1553134674706557 | This won't bother the Trumpsters. Their allegiance is and has been to Vladimir Putin for at least a year now. They would be entirely happy to abandon all the articles and amendments of the Constitution except for the 2nd Amendment. And let's not forget Trump also wants to defend "Article VII", even though there's no such Article in the Constitution. There's only 1 through 7 articles.
20 | Kathy Kangas | 12 | 1553094868043871_1553106121376079 | Dear NBC and media: Why haven't you been investigation Trump on MANY various topics from months ago? Stay on top of the Trump ball - Trump should go to prison!
21 | Linda Burchette | 3 | 1553094868043871_672401396274306 | I would challenge you to ever accuse Trump of inciting fear, defiance and sexism.....really, speaking the truth about the most dishonest and corrupt person under FBI to have ever run for the highest office in the US, Hillary has said over and over again how middle class are deplorable and latino's are Needy. She has used the Black community for decades and turned her back to them the minute she got a vote! Wake up Americans!
22 | Jennifer Devlin | 3 | 1553094868043871_1785939485001794 | Hillary Clinton belongs in Jail.In 30 years + she has accomplished nothing!Voting for her and this Regime is voting for Organized Crime at the Tax Payers expense!This email Scandal is just the beginning.She is a Threat to our national Security and when she claims she had no idea what the letter C means in front of her emails only proves she is unfit to run our country! She can not be trusted! She was disbarred as an Attorney for being unethical & a Liar... nothing has changed except her bank account !!!!
23 | Nick K. Manning | 3 | 1553094868043871_1785929041669505 | nbc squirming now and bringing up old stories. You big JOKES will understand that We The People remember all the crap you pulled for the lying, deceitful and corrupt pantsuit wearing POS to come along in America's history.
24 | Billy Gasn | 3 | 1553094868043871_1785933325002410 | Lmao. Was this before or after Clinton gave 20% of our uranium to a Russian company in exchange for $142 million dollars to their foundation? #hypocrites
25 | Julie A Kvinge | 2 | 1553094868043871_1553142188039139 | Just a reaction to Hillary's criminal background for 30 years. How could anyone vote for such a liar and chief. You not like Trump, but she is a criminal. Benghazi alone shows how uncaring and terrible she can be. It is the lowest of low to lie to a Mother of a dead son!! I know!  I hope she goes to jail.

"I am sure they will reach the same conclusion they did when they looked at my emails for the last year, there is no case here," Hillary Clinton told supporters.

1 | Dustin Ginsberg | 260 | 1553069478046410_1553069654713059 | There is no case! She was cleared by a GOP lead investigation and the FBI! These emails weren't even sent or seen by her. There is literally no issue. It's enough with the emails. Why don't we focus on Trumps rape case that starts next month? You know, the one where he is accused of raping a minor
2 | Favour Johnson Destiny | 215 | 1553069478046410_1553070898046268 | So, to recap. Trump will go on trial in November accused of racketeering, and again in December accused of child rape. He is a sexual predator, hasn't released his tax returns, and has used his foundation's money to pay his legal fees. He has abused the family of a war hero and... oh, but let's talk about some emails Hillary didn't send from someone else's computer, that weren't a crime anyway, because that's how to choose a president. Come on, America. Focus.
3 | Sarah Sprague | 232 | 1553069478046410_1553072301379461 | This is pathetic. If there is no case then why were 2 Clinton staffers fired 2 wks ago and another one today?! Your empire of corruption is crumbling!!!
4 | Wayne Thorning | 165 | 1553069478046410_1553077701378921 | NBC,  you can keep plucking that fiddle and playing the "Same old tune" , but the American people are waking up to your biased BS,  and know that HRC is not only doomed,  but eventually going to Prison!  ... I can't wait to see your coverage of that!

The cheating, corruption, lying, name calling, spin, the outing of msm as corrupt and biased etc etc. This has been like watching a Shakespeare play, with all the sordid characters and evil twisted plots. An Olympics of filth... just unmissable stuff.
8 | Dolores Cook Wells | 20 | 1553069478046410_1553075101379181 | Does anyone read the news?The GOP, Trump, and the FBI are Traitors.They tried a little back door coup and it blew up in their face.Hillary is innocent.Spin your lies elsewhere.If you support Trump Traitors after today and the overwhelming truth is in your face, what does that make you?
9 | Holly Shuey | 25 | 1553069478046410_1553080888045269 | Nancy S. WroteTHE STORY OF HILLARY IN A NUT SHELLA "MUST READ"To all of us, who are glued to the news, watching the election, the story unfolds as written by its author, Hillary Clinton.  She just couldn‚Äôt sit still and mind her own business.  After leaving the White House, she could have had a wonderful life.  She and Bill could have made millions in honest and decent ways.  Instead, the temptation to make hundreds of millions was too hard to resist.  She started to sell her influence, probably a little at first and it grew.Eventually, the Clintons started to get some huge payments with her run against Obama with the likelihood that she would run a better campaign later.  As Secretary of State, there was more influence to sell through the Clinton Foundation and through payments for speeches.  She probably prompted some of the largest payments into the multimillions by telling her donors that she was going to run for the presidency.  It worked.  Why else would Saudi Arabia donate more than $25 Million?  These donors were gambling, they played the odds, and Hillary had to play the part.  She had to run for president.  She would have been as good as dead if she didn‚Äôt even try. So, there she was, not knee deep, but over her head with Bill and even involving her daughter, running a criminal enterprise selling influence.  She was on a path which she could no longer abandon. This middle class woman was no innocent victim.  Her greed and her ego were in step with the pragmatic need to run for president.   As she and Bill were experienced presidents, she knew all the tricks to get into office, and she knew all the mischief she could inflict once she became the Queen of the kingdom.  She set this whole thing in motion, and just like the murderers we watch on Forensic Files, she thought that she was smart enough to get away with crimes about as serious as murder.  She rationalized just as criminals do.As with other criminals, once she was used to running her influence selling organization, after a while, she thought that she would never get caught.  After all, Bill had been the President of the United States, and his and her prestige put them on a platform of impenetrability.  Unfortunately, for her, like most criminals, she could not anticipate every turn, every person, every nook and cranny.  She probably would have gotten away with her crimes if she would have stayed as private as possible, but she just couldn‚Äôt just leave it alone.  She had to go public by running for the office of the President of the United States.  She had to put herself under a microscope.Now she is getting caught.She didn‚Äôt anticipate her mistakes or that someone like Donald J. Trump would come along to expose her criminality.  While we are watching the election, seeing the beginning of the rise of Donald J. Trump, we are also going to see the decline of Hillary Clinton and what has literally turned into a crime family.   She is desperate.  Her back is against a wall.  She has about half of the population and most people who matter totally involved.  One problem she has, though, is that her mentality has evolved and grown.  Once a person strays far from the path of decency, her criminal mentality leads to more and more actions which are off the wall.  She arranged for violent protestors to attend Trump rallies.  She probably arranged for false testimony from Mr. Khan and the women who claimed Donald J. Trump groped them.  She had no hesitation in labeling a decent man to be a bigot and a racist.  She did so well that almost half of America thinks extremely poorly about Donald J. Trump.  She was getting away with all this, too.Alas she made one mistake which was the beginning of her downfall.To make sure that there would be no criminal charges against her, Hillary orchestrated the payment of more than $675,000 to one of Director Comey‚Äôs trusted agents.  Due to Wikileaks, she got caught on this one.When James Comey decided to not prosecute, I had suggested that, in time, he would be ultimately seen as an American hero, the kind who used to be played by Jimmy Stewart.  He is probably a decent honest man who delegated responsibilities to his trusted men and women, and who believed what they reported.No doubt, Agent McCabe‚Äôs wife received this sum which is huge for an FBI agent, and then, Agent McCabe used his influence to wiggle his way to manage the investigation of Hillary Clinton‚Äôs emails.  It is no wonder she had such confidence that she would never be caught.  She had infiltrated the FBI  Now, we are just past the point in the typical Forensic Files case where the police have heard allegations of unimaginable criminality from a prior president (and wife) of the United States.  The police and almost half of America could not believe that someone with all that stature would become a head of a master criminal enterprise.  Their imaginations just couldn‚Äôt recognize something as ridiculous to be something which is tragically true.  Now, James Comey knows that she infiltrated his organization and corrupted one of his most trusted agents.  Once the police know who committed the crime, or in this case that there was a crime, they get on the path to prove and prosecute their case.  For so long, Director Comey was fed lies and he relied on the false information provided by Mr. McCabe.  Now, we are at the point where the police are looking at Hillary‚Äôs emails like a pack of hounds.  They are seeing the dark side. Now that Director Comey knows of the bribery, the bloom is off the rose.  She is exposed.  The police know that she is guilty.  Now, they are moving at rocket speed.  I am sure that Agent McCabe is no longer in charge of the investigation.  Other agents, honest ones, are hitting it as fast and as thoroughly as possible.Now, it is just a matter of time.  The FBI are on to her, and she is so guilty of so much, she will be exposed, hopefully before the election.  After all, she wants all the evidence put ‚Äúon the table.‚Äù  She may get her wish.I doubt that they will be able to get things together fast enough, but there is a possibility that she will be charged and arrested before the election.Now, Hillary is able to put her mind out of reality when she performs her rally act, but there must be moments in the day when reality clicks in and she gets frightened.  She must be waking up at 2:00 o‚Äôclock in the morning in a cold sweat.  She knows that Mr. Comey knows.  She knows that she is going to get caught.  Her only hope is to become president fast enough and control the process.  Mr. Comey is a true American hero who will pull the plug before that can happen.  In fact, his annoucement last week may have done the trick.Donald J. Trump is right.  This is worse than Watergate.  This is unbelievably worse.  This is an American tragedy, which even Shakespeare couldn‚Äôt have written.As lawyers say, ‚ÄúThe truth will out.‚Äù  Hillary Clinton is a criminal who has grown to a level we see only in comic books.  At this point, her goose is cooked.Watch her at her rallies as she plays her part.  Too bad that she has so many surrogates (some completely innocent) who speak for her.  In this regard, we will see if the Obamas continue to support her.  How did she get them to join her campaign?  Will we find that she corrupted them, too?One way or another, this is one of the greatest stories in American history.  Thankfully, we have Donald J. Trump to fix so much at this point.[If you appreciate this post, please do what you can to spread it.  Share it, Tweet it.  Email it.  Please get this word out.]
10 | Holly Shuey | 33 | 1553069478046410_1553081174711907 | I do not care if Donald Trump called a woman fat. I do not care if he tried to sleep with a woman or if he likes "beautiful" women. I care that he supports our police officers and first responders. I care that he supports guns and standing behind our military. I care that he supports the death penalty and is AGAINST abortion. I care that he supports enforcing immigration laws. I care that he wants to destroy radical Islamic groups. I care that he supports COAL. These are things I care about. Him talking sexually about women does not bother me. Were they mean words? Yes. Were they words spoken in PRIVATE? Yes. Have you ever talked to your friends about the opposite sex in private and said things? I'm positive all of you have. But, News Flash!! Women have been sexualized for centuries!! Jay-Z, Lil' Jon, Lil' Wayne and every single other rapper helped establish that platform, but people are ok with music blasted all over the radio degrading women. Ever heard of Victoria Secret? Or their fashion show? Ever heard of Hooters? People are ok with that too. Until all of these things are different, women will be viewed this way. Your precious Obama couldn't change that and Hillary can't either. I feel sorry for the women Donald has belittled and said terrible things about. But I'm still much more offended by what Hillary Clinton has DONE over what Donald Trump has SAID... PERIOD!!!! So Trump doesn't do well at the debates, maybe he even sounds childish and incapable. But he is speaking the truth! Just because he's not a polished politician like Hilary or Obama doesn't mean he's unqualified to be president. He cares for this country, not growing the size of his pockets. That man has so much money he could never spend it all. He gets NOTHING out of being president! I'm standing for the man accused of saying mean words. I'll never back a woman under three different scandal investigations, possible murder at Benghazi, and the secretive email scandal which has been nothing but lies from the beginning. And Hillary supports late term abortion (right up to the birth) how sick is that?And at the same time she is going around the country saying she's fighting for the children, yea right!the last time she was in the White House she stole $200,000 of furniture and then had the nerve to vandalize the White House on her way out!Trump 2016!!!Copy and paste!!! And pass it on #trumpforpresident
11 | Annie C. Galloza | 16 | 1553069478046410_1553074968045861 | The fact that the Deleter-In-Chief, the MOST CORRUPT person ever to run for the Presidency, can't shake the consequences of HER own willful and intentional actions, SHOULD shake up this race! She didn't get convicted before because her girl, Lynch, who is still obstructing justice, wouldn't even allow a grand jury! And she & her camp have the shameless audacity to ask for transparency?! Hillary has put the H in Hypocrisy! We would not be here if she didn't believe she was above the law! She and her circle are the absolute epitome of everything Americans hate about the government! Double-standard Democrats & media rather keep their heads in the sand regardless of an avalanche of evidence against the ever vile, ever vindictive, ever deceptive, & ever crooked Clinton Cartel! May justice truly prevail. How absolutely disgusting to see these asstards praise Comey in July and now condemn him. Vile Hypocrites!
12 | Ric Winthrop | 3 | 1553069478046410_1101947003273108 | Comey is on a Republican initiated witch hunt. This a..hole has just politicized what should be an impartial office. Wonder what the Republican Party promised Comey in return....maybe the position of Attorney General? Doesn't anyone think it odd that Comey made his big announcement before he even had a warrant for the emails? The whole purpose was to smear Clinton, with no actual proof, just prior to the election.
13 | Rhonda Sheptock | 2 | 1553069478046410_1804571273157850 | Meanwhile Trump is actually going to court for Child Rape and his Fraudulent University that stole millions from hard working Americans, shipping his work off the other countries while touting he wants to make America great, sexually assaulting women for decades, building his businesses with a Chinese steel, hiring US Contractors to architect and build his hotels and then not paying them, bankrupting his businesses and putting people out of work and not providing healthcare benefits for the ones he does have working. And this is all on top of him being a racist, misogynist, hate breeding, war monger who disrespects our veterans and war heroes and makes fun of disabled people! And we can also add that he not only lost 500million on a single year beating the great business man that he is, but found a loophole to then not pay any personal federal income tax for the last 20 years. So he isn't contributing to our schools, fire/police departments, servicemen, veterans, or any other departments that he states he cares so much about!
14 | Barb Loeb | 2 | 1553069478046410_1553078818045476 | It's so interesting that the little hitler tRump said he had a "secret weapon" just after the pussy tape was revealed and comey knew about the emails on the weiner's laptop and then chaffetz also knew about this before everyone else who got the letter and gee, the russians must be involved...and huh...whose rights have been violated. So interesting... a little collusion? A little treason?
15 | Mike Fischer | 11 | 1553069478046410_1553105144709510 | PS: If Trump becomes President...THINK HARD FOLKS!‚Ä¢ The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.‚Ä¢ The media has been neutered forever.‚Ä¢ Career politicians will have lost all job security.‚Ä¢ The guns in your home will safely stay there.‚Ä¢ Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.‚Ä¢ Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally‚Ä¢ Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.‚Ä¢ No more apologies to the world for being great!‚Ä¢ Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.‚Ä¢ Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.‚Ä¢ There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.‚Ä¢ The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.‚Ä¢ The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.Copy and paste this as your status if you support and will vote Donald Trump for president 2016.

18 | Tony Mason | 2 | 1553069478046410_1553110394708985 | November 8th can't come soon enough,  that way at least that part will be over! The problem is that the fallout will be just as debilitating to the country.   Since we are so at odds as people and parties,  the discord will continue at nausea.  We need a President that can listen,  can be respected by the bulk of the citizens.  Someone that can act on the part of the citizens,  not democrats and republicans. We need to start grooming that person,  because they do not seem to exist at this time.
19 | Penny Elizabeth Dutkowski | 1 | 1553069478046410_1101933903274418 | Abedin left her husband the month before the FBI investigation started. She left the computer behind as well. It makes no sense that if she was covering up emails, she would a) leave the computer behind b) not scrub it clean first. Russia/wikileaks hacked into computers and stole thousands of emails, Russia/wikileaks can hack into computers and dump files. That is the story everyone should be pursuing, why aren't they?
20 | CynthiaBaker Zillion | 1 | 1553069478046410_1804582359823408 | The FBI uncovered emails from someone, to someone, about something, that may be pertinent to something, although they cannot assess whether or not this material may be significant to something, and they can not predict when they may know!!! And, they didn't get them from Hillary's server. They are not to her or from her. Sounds like they've got the smoking gun for sure.
21 | Joe Wenal | 6 | 1553069478046410_1553097608043597 | I feel bad for all of you, and I worry about the future of my country. I am voting for trump , and I know exactly what he is . Just like I know exactly who Hilary is . I wish I was not voting for trump but he is way better than Hilary. Everyone has blinders on due to there party loyalty. There's an old saying if it looks like a turd smells like a turd don't eat it. If someone could snap a finger and do away with political parties both government and Democrat and there was no party affiliation and for the first time you are hearing about a candidate you heard that they were under investigation now twice by the FBI and the FBI said how bad they were at their job and they've been fired from a lesser job they left American military soldiers who died in Benghazi she lied about why she lied to their families there's proof that her foundation did not give all the money to earthquake relief efforts she was behind pay for play where she put people in high-ranking positions with no experience at those positions and those people gave her large amounts of money and I know there's more but that alone if there was no party affiliation no one would even consider voting for such a person but because she's the one on your team just like because trumps the one on the Republican team we Overlook every and anything they are both terds . But one is way worse. If any of you actually possess the ability to at least be honest with yourself anymore right down all the stuff that we know Hillary has done that they think Hillary has done that the things we know she has lied about and then do the same thing for Trump and even put on there says mean things and is a jerk and is a racist sure if you think that put it on the list and then compare the lists I guarantee you Hillary's is not only going to be longer but worse I know this because I've done it

2 | Stan Gilbert | 48 | 1553043314715693_1553045414715483 | They need to be working just as fast to remove Comey. He's proven to be danger to himself and this Country by his own actions. How can the Directior of the FBI disobey his Superiors and not folloe policy, it's  slap in the face, on the butt, and in the gut, yet He's still on the job. Go figure.

She and her circle are the absolute epitome of everything Americans hate about the government! Double-standard Democrats & media rather keep their heads in the sand regardless of an avalanche of evidence against the ever vile, ever vindictive, ever deceptive, & ever crooked Clinton Cartel!

11 | Wendi Sargent | 0 | 1553043314715693_1553126681374023 | Nancy S. WroteTHE STORY OF HILLARY IN A NUT SHELLA "MUST READ"To all of us, who are glued to the news, watching the election, the story unfolds as written by its author, Hillary Clinton.  She just couldn‚Äôt sit still and mind her own business.  After leaving the White House, she could have had a wonderful life.  She and Bill could have made millions in honest and decent ways.  Instead, the temptation to make hundreds of millions was too hard to resist.  She started to sell her influence, probably a little at first and it grew.Eventually, the Clintons started to get some huge payments with her run against Obama with the likelihood that she would run a better campaign later.  As Secretary of State, there was more influence to sell through the Clinton Foundation and through payments for speeches.  She probably prompted some of the largest payments into the multimillions by telling her donors that she was going to run for the presidency.  It worked.  Why else would Saudi Arabia donate more than $25 Million?  These donors were gambling, they played the odds, and Hillary had to play the part.  She had to run for president.  She would have been as good as dead if she didn‚Äôt even try. So, there she was, not knee deep, but over her head with Bill and even involving her daughter, running a criminal enterprise selling influence.  She was on a path which she could no longer abandon. This middle class woman was no innocent victim.  Her greed and her ego were in step with the pragmatic need to run for president.   As she and Bill were experienced presidents, she knew all the tricks to get into office, and she knew all the mischief she could inflict once she became the Queen of the kingdom.  She set this whole thing in motion, and just like the murderers we watch on Forensic Files, she thought that she was smart enough to get away with crimes about as serious as murder.  She rationalized just as criminals do.As with other criminals, once she was used to running her influence selling organization, after a while, she thought that she would never get caught.  After all, Bill had been the President of the United States, and his and her prestige put them on a platform of impenetrability.  Unfortunately, for her, like most criminals, she could not anticipate every turn, every person, every nook and cranny.  She probably would have gotten away with her crimes if she would have stayed as private as possible, but she just couldn‚Äôt just leave it alone.  She had to go public by running for the office of the President of the United States.  She had to put herself under a microscope.Now she is getting caught.She didn‚Äôt anticipate her mistakes or that someone like Donald J. Trump would come along to expose her criminality.  While we are watching the election, seeing the beginning of the rise of Donald J. Trump, we are also going to see the decline of Hillary Clinton and what has literally turned into a crime family.   She is desperate.  Her back is against a wall.  She has about half of the population and most people who matter totally involved.  One problem she has, though, is that her mentality has evolved and grown.  Once a person strays far from the path of decency, her criminal mentality leads to more and more actions which are off the wall.  She arranged for violent protestors to attend Trump rallies.  She probably arranged for false testimony from Mr. Khan and the women who claimed Donald J. Trump groped them.  She had no hesitation in labeling a decent man to be a bigot and a racist.  She did so well that almost half of America thinks extremely poorly about Donald J. Trump.  She was getting away with all this, too.Alas she made one mistake which was the beginning of her downfall.To make sure that there would be no criminal charges against her, Hillary orchestrated the payment of more than $675,000 to one of Director Comey‚Äôs trusted agents.  Due to Wikileaks, she got caught on this one.When James Comey decided to not prosecute, I had suggested that, in time, he would be ultimately seen as an American hero, the kind who used to be played by Jimmy Stewart.  He is probably a decent honest man who delegated responsibilities to his trusted men and women, and who believed what they reported.No doubt, Agent McCabe‚Äôs wife received this sum which is huge for an FBI agent, and then, Agent McCabe used his influence to wiggle his way to manage the investigation of Hillary Clinton‚Äôs emails.  It is no wonder she had such confidence that she would never be caught.  She had infiltrated the FBI  Now, we are just past the point in the typical Forensic Files case where the police have heard allegations of unimaginable criminality from a prior president (and wife) of the United States.  The police and almost half of America could not believe that someone with all that stature would become a head of a master criminal enterprise.  Their imaginations just couldn‚Äôt recognize something as ridiculous to be something which is tragically true.  Now, James Comey knows that she infiltrated his organization and corrupted one of his most trusted agents.  Once the police know who committed the crime, or in this case that there was a crime, they get on the path to prove and prosecute their case.  For so long, Director Comey was fed lies and he relied on the false information provided by Mr. McCabe.  Now, we are at the point where the police are looking at Hillary‚Äôs emails like a pack of hounds.  They are seeing the dark side. Now that Director Comey knows of the bribery, the bloom is off the rose.  She is exposed.  The police know that she is guilty.  Now, they are moving at rocket speed.  I am sure that Agent McCabe is no longer in charge of the investigation.  Other agents, honest ones, are hitting it as fast and as thoroughly as possible.Now, it is just a matter of time.  The FBI are on to her, and she is so guilty of so much, she will be exposed, hopefully before the election.  After all, she wants all the evidence put ‚Äúon the table.‚Äù  She may get her wish.I doubt that they will be able to get things together fast enough, but there is a possibility that she will be charged and arrested before the election.Now, Hillary is able to put her mind out of reality when she performs her rally act, but there must be moments in the day when reality clicks in and she gets frightened.  She must be waking up at 2:00 o‚Äôclock in the morning in a cold sweat.  She knows that Mr. Comey knows.  She knows that she is going to get caught.  Her only hope is to become president fast enough and control the process.  Mr. Comey is a true American hero who will pull the plug before that can happen.  In fact, his annoucement last week may have done the trick.Donald J. Trump is right.  This is worse than Watergate.  This is unbelievably worse.  This is an American tragedy, which even Shakespeare couldn‚Äôt have written.As lawyers say, ‚ÄúThe truth will out.‚Äù  Hillary Clinton is a criminal who has grown to a level we see only in comic books.  At this point, her goose is cooked.Watch her at her rallies as she plays her part.  Too bad that she has so many surrogates (some completely innocent) who speak for her.  In this regard, we will see if the Obamas continue to support her.  How did she get them to join her campaign?  Will we find that she corrupted them, too?One way or another, this is one of the greatest stories in American history.  Thankfully, we have Donald J. Trump to fix so much at this point.[If you appreciate this post, please do what you can to spread it.  Share it, Tweet it.  Email it.  Please get this word out.]
12 | Evon Ruth | 2 | 1553043314715693_1553146868038671 | Unless Clinton's emails reveal that she molested a dozen men, cheated on 3 spouses, is facing a rape case in December, is facing a fraud case in November for ripping off students, has bullied hundreds of contractors and workers into accepting half what they were promised, mocked a handicapped man, disparagingly treated a deceased vets family, threatened to punish women who get abortions, profited off a charity and used its money to bribe two attorney generals, and developed an oddly cozy relationship with a foreign leader who's trying to alter the course of our election, I'm sticking with Hillary. Credit unknown, but tweaked it and pasted it on, keep it going!
13 | Jeff W. Mathewson | 2 | 1553043314715693_1553056928047665 | BS. We know it. You made a deal with Bill Clinton that if you would drop the case back in July you would have a longer lasting job. So yes you are kind of pissed off right now that most likely that deal will not go through as you had planned. Remember all, 1 day before the FBI dropped the case they had a meeting on her private jet about, get this, GOLF and the grand kids. LOL

How can you defend what you don't know? I am worried about what they say. Covering up makes me suspicious, and that is what they are doing. Hillary has always been a crook, why would she change now?

After all Hillary has told Attorney general Loretta Lynch that she wants her in her new administration, so it makes perfect sense for the two of them to help each other out!.....doesn't It???

24 | Klaudio Vinkerliƒá | 0 | 1553043314715693_1553084144711610 | Last Dec, the Saudi government announced a budget deficit for 2015 of about $135 billion, which it filled largely by drawing down hundreds of millions of dollars of its foreign reserves. Much of those reserves are held in U.S. Treasury securities, which Saudi officials have threaten to dump if Congress passes the 9/11 bill. Economists believe that is unlikely, given Saudi Arabia‚Äôs fragile economy right now. So, this political marriage would go on for some time. Even Trump wouldn't do such a thing. He has openly said of occupying Iraqi oil reserves from falling hands to the ISIS. He's a shrewd businessman, he wouldn't do anything that would threaten the greenback.Considering ruble or juan...lets wait the market is being established....But great opportunities for investments in EAsian spheredo u think of Trump would win ?About the money...it is all paper  work of Monopoly...If we speak what is standing behind the paper money...it is simply a fraud, brick or else...it is the Monopoly trick.This what matters is the essential energy mean transmitted in some exchange mean.It could be some other matter, like food..but this does not play yet in the planned economy. Russia, China and BRICS do understand that...but the NATO members need to adjust and accept the cooperative methods.About Donald Trump....hahaha...he is, or not just another Monopoly fox.We do need Turkey's agreement to let the Far East Economy to enter to the European market. By the way, Europe will not be able to function without EAsian energy supply, resources...the US is to far away to be profitable in the competition with EAsian resources.If not so, and not to enter an agreed World's Economy ballanced progress, People's relations to cooperate and let live, there is the provoked danger by the US and NATO's Monopoly to iniciate more conflicts to become a destrustive World War-Russia, India, China on the Asian continent are the majority, not to mention Brasil, Argentina.....The economies of Brazil and Argentina are doing badly due to China's slowdown. India is the only one stable.I would not agree. Brazil and South America are to far away to practice the Chinas Investments. There are some planes to build the railway to Pacific...but let's see.To me, the most important job is to make Turkey understand that Turkey is the gateway to Africa. If not so EAsia will need to search for some other traffic solution.And, if being left that the EAsian Indurstri rises without european involvement, Europe will fail...same as the US/Canadian economy. South America, and later Africa will rise due to the Chinese capital if not only. Russia will collaborate but will always try to remain independent.Question:Would You prefer to live in a region where are jobs opportunities iniciatives  like EAsian project or in society where there is no future... like the dying Western's Capitalism, if not agreed so...World wide?Chat Conversation EndType a message...
25 | Dean Felix | 1 | 1553043314715693_1553109204709104 | For those of you who wonder why so many of us are voting for Trump- I think this sums it up pretty good! For What It's Worth Department:                                        The Media just doesn‚Äôt get it....they can't believe that people are so angry     that they can no longer be manipulated!  Millions of trump supporters feel this way about Donald J. Trump.....We don't care if the guy swears... or how many times he's been married...or who he voted for, or what his income tax return shows. We want the problems fixed. Yes, he's an egomaniac, but we don't care. We know he's not a racist, or all the other things the liberal media is trying to label him with. We know he's raised a good family, and that says a lot about him.The country is a mess because politicians suck, the Republican Party is two faced & gutless, and illegals are everywhere and Muslims are openly trying to hurt this country and make the civilized world adjust to them. We want it all fixed!We don't care that Trump is crude, we don't care that he has changed positions, we don't care that he fights with Megan Kelly, Rosie O'Donnell, and so many of the elected establishment. We don't care that Rubio, Ryan, the Bush's, and so many other top old and new Republicans refuse to endorse him for their own selfish reasons, and we know what they are. We don't care that he doesn't know the name of some Muslim terrorists, we don't care that he tried some businesses that didn't work out.This country is weak, bankrupt, our enemies are making fun of us, we are being invaded by illegals, we are becoming a nation of victims, where every Tom, Ricardo and Hasid is a special group with special rights to a point where we don't even recognize the country we were born and raised in, AND WE JUST WANT IT FIXED. And TRUMP is the only guy who seems to understand what the people want.We're sick of politicians, sick of the Democratic and Republican Party. We're angry about the Iran deal, the budget, treatment of Israel, military weakness, lobbyists, special interests, overpaid politicians with their self serving bills and back room deals, trade deals, loss of jobs, manipulated economic numbers, businesses fleeing, and even the phony pay for play Clinton Foundation.Americans are no longer going to be fooled, and the movement is out to change the direction we're taking. Trump may not be a saint, but he doesn't have lobbyist money holding him, he doesn't have political correctness restraining him, and all you know is that he has been very successful, a good negotiator, he has built a lot of things, he's flexible, and he's also not a politician. And he says he'll fix it. And we believe him because he is too much of an egotist to be proven wrong or looked at and called a liar.Public service has become elected greed. This may be our only chance to have a non-politician, despite his flaws, try and correct the mess, at least for 4 years. We must take the shot, because the consequences of putting Hillary Clinton in office are frightening. There is a tidal wave happening, and it's going to overcome much of what's happened to this country.

Hillary Clinton's 6-point national lead over Donald J. Trump remains virtually unchanged since last week, even after FBI Director James Comey announced newly discovered emails that could be "pertinent" to the investigation of Clinton's use of a private email server.

6 | Todd Devine | 115 | 1553003958052962_1553015481385143 | very clear of the deception NBC has on this election. Almost all the polls in the last few days show Trump closing the gap yet this crappy media biased station is reporting false info. Don't believe the garbage the media is feeding you. Vote! Trump 2016 Make America Great again and Drain the swamp.
7 | Calvin Anderson | 96 | 1553003958052962_1553006691386022 | Because they put a letter out there like that that fired up the Democratic base that's why we're coming out very strong for Hillary Clinton I was very impressed with the White House briefing when the one reporter asked about the FBI investigation Donald Trump's close ties to Russia maybe that's why he doesn't want to show his tax returns
8 | Matt Bradley | 100 | 1553003958052962_1553014181385273 | Don't believe the media...Hillary's poll numbers are falling faster than Bill Clinton's pants in an Arkansas trailer park...
9 | Steve Hunter | 94 | 1553003958052962_1553009314719093 | Clinton has a husband that had an affair, is running against a man that's bragged about molesting women and has five kids to three different women, and she's now having to deal with an FBI case about a man that is addicted to sending dick pics to 15 year old girls. If ever there was proof we need a woman as President...
10 | Jim Williams | 94 | 1553003958052962_1553005884719436 | "FBI Director Comey‚Äîwho released a vague and misleading letter about Hillary's emails just days before the election‚Äîopposed releasing details about Russian interference because he thought it was too close to the election.

12 | Ronnie King | 32 | 1553003958052962_1553016578051700 | It is NBC . They have the lowest ratings of all because of their bias reporting. All the other polls show Hillary is dropping like a rock. Also never believe the main stream media polls ,they have an agenda .
13 | Amanda N Jaquay | 64 | 1553003958052962_1553011744718850 | Brought to you by the Nobody But Clinton News network! Just trying to make everyone give up and not vote. Killarys crowds are smaller than school gymnasiums while trump packs stadiums.
14 | Wayne Thorning | 26 | 1553003958052962_862799017194994 | NBC,  you can keep plucking that fiddle and playing the "Same old tune" , but the American people are waking up to your biased BS,  and know that HRC is not only doomed,  but eventually going to Prison!  ... I can't wait to see your coverage of that!
15 | Felix Potvin | 21 | 1553003958052962_1447592955269014 | Yeah, truly NBC, your desperation is pathetic. We realize you want people to believe you, but hey, you've lost all credibility. You've now joined the ranks of Jerry Springer.
16 | Murph McCurley | 12 | 1553003958052962_862812673860295 | NBC is lying because they are so pro Hillary it stinks. Get your facts right NBC. I actually switch channels because of your constant disregard for laws that Hillary has broken. People have and are going to prison and losing their military benefits for lesser offenses.
17 | Peggy Munn | 10 | 1553003958052962_1366211530069108 | NBC, and all the other media outlets can rally for Hillary, but Nothing Changes Hillary is Still A Criminal Whose Broken Every Law Written, and More Dangering Our Country, and the American people!!!!! Hillary shouldn't be even running for president!!! Vote Trump for all our sakes, or you'll Never Get Another Chance To Save America, and Our Lives!!!!!! Praying Trump will win!!!!!!
18 | Robert Hansen | 11 | 1553003958052962_1553010724718952 | Most people are Media Literate and know the difference between reporting the news and the analyzing of the news for conservative agendas or liberal agendas. Most Americans see Trumps "McCarthyism" speeches for what they are. Most Americans see Trumps Nationalist Dixiecrat Republican Party as just to dangerous to be relied on.
19 | Bill Wilson | 5 | 1553003958052962_862841747190721 | can't wait til the Clintons are indicted for RICO/organized crime. the most corrupt family in American politics and the supporters, vote what u promote  open boarders, sharia law, illegal aliens, pro abortion, anti police anti Christian values etc
20 | Jorge A Lopez | 11 | 1553003958052962_646660658831224 | I think this was the worst mistake for the Trump campaign because I'm independent and I vote for a candidate that I like and I was undecided but since Friday when all this BS emails came back to light that is not even Hillary emails it made me decide to vote for her because now we the voters that were undecided can see that all this email are a big BS and so I decided to vote for Hillary and tanks to the FBI director.
21 | Juli Jordan Booth | 6 | 1553003958052962_1553015368051821 | I am amused by the way you put the word pertinent in quotes, as though you are making fun of the way the FBI Director characterized the potential link to Sec. Clinton.  It reminds me of the way I use the word "unbiased" when describing NBC.
22 | Ron Dowlen | 13 | 1553003958052962_1553022664717758 | I am SO sick of hearing about Hillary's emails and Benghazi that she should be in prison. How about the thousands of deaths under Bush... regarding Katrina, 9/11 , the fake Iraq war that we were lied to about, and the billions in profits made by Chaney's Halliburton and subsidiaries,the banking and housing market disaster and all the cover-ups by the Republicans in office? Missing documents, blacked out sentences and paragraphs,the millions of White House E-mails suddenly disappearing regarding the extreme mishandling of all the Bush Administration that almost destroyed this world then was mysteriously hushed up and was never to be discussed or talked about again. The Republicans won't ever talk about ANY of this. THEY are the ones that should all be in prison !
23 | Melinda Echols | 15 | 1553003958052962_1553010364718988 | The news, believe it was GMA, reported a one point lead this morning. Of course, NBC will report a six point lead.  Puppet journalism at its best!
24 | Gary Daum | 3 | 1553003958052962_862823437192552 | The new email controversy in a nutshell:A collection of emails has been found that MAY be related. They MAY also be duplicates of emails already been seen.Content? Completely unknown. Any inferences are complete speculation.The FBI is in the process of examining them. Nothing has been released as to content. The first set earned a rebuke for carelessness and a statement that no reasonable prosecutor would pursue Clinton. There is no evidence--at this time--to believe that this set will produce different results.So, which is it? Guilty until proven innocent, or innocent until proven guilty? Or, is it that so many Americans are clairvoyant and know the content?
25 | Bruce Dadisman | 6 | 1553003958052962_1553018778051480 | Trump's whole campaign has been based on hyperbole ("worst", "best" "never happened") to the point that his "sky is falling" b.s. has turned everyone off...except for the "deplorables" of course. They don't care...and look out for that piece of sky!!!

2 | Henrik Ahlm | 37 | 1552975901389101_1552976341389057 | Why vote Clinton and not Trump?It is one of the most simple questions to answer if you got a normal functioning brain.Like the editorial board of one of the world's most respected business newspapers said today:"Mrs Clinton carries enough baggage to fill a Boeing 747. She is not trusted by the majority of voters. But she is manifestly more competent than Mr Trump whose braggadocio, divisiveness and meanness are on daily display."The essence is, that Trump is not fit for public office and Trump will not be the 45th President of the US. Period!Nobody, who loves America, wants a President, who secretly enjoys a sexsual relationship with Putin. Putin - the serious rumour says - makes Trump crawl on the floor while Putin whips Trumps hairdue with a goosefeather all the while Trump beggs for mercy and cries out loud. The rumour also has it that a certain gay speculator from Silicon Valley likes to join in.And U.S. gun owners - men in black are back on Election day! Either you are with us, you deplorable gunnies, or you are against us!

14 | Dean Felix | 0 | 1552975901389101_1553109661375725 | For those of you who wonder why so many of us are voting for Trump- I think this sums it up pretty good! For What It's Worth Department:                                        The Media just doesn‚Äôt get it....they can't believe that people are so angry     that they can no longer be manipulated!  Millions of trump supporters feel this way about Donald J. Trump.....We don't care if the guy swears... or how many times he's been married...or who he voted for, or what his income tax return shows. We want the problems fixed. Yes, he's an egomaniac, but we don't care. We know he's not a racist, or all the other things the liberal media is trying to label him with. We know he's raised a good family, and that says a lot about him.The country is a mess because politicians suck, the Republican Party is two faced & gutless, and illegals are everywhere and Muslims are openly trying to hurt this country and make the civilized world adjust to them. We want it all fixed!We don't care that Trump is crude, we don't care that he has changed positions, we don't care that he fights with Megan Kelly, Rosie O'Donnell, and so many of the elected establishment. We don't care that Rubio, Ryan, the Bush's, and so many other top old and new Republicans refuse to endorse him for their own selfish reasons, and we know what they are. We don't care that he doesn't know the name of some Muslim terrorists, we don't care that he tried some businesses that didn't work out.This country is weak, bankrupt, our enemies are making fun of us, we are being invaded by illegals, we are becoming a nation of victims, where every Tom, Ricardo and Hasid is a special group with special rights to a point where we don't even recognize the country we were born and raised in, AND WE JUST WANT IT FIXED. And TRUMP is the only guy who seems to understand what the people want.We're sick of politicians, sick of the Democratic and Republican Party. We're angry about the Iran deal, the budget, treatment of Israel, military weakness, lobbyists, special interests, overpaid politicians with their self serving bills and back room deals, trade deals, loss of jobs, manipulated economic numbers, businesses fleeing, and even the phony pay for play Clinton Foundation.Americans are no longer going to be fooled, and the movement is out to change the direction we're taking. Trump may not be a saint, but he doesn't have lobbyist money holding him, he doesn't have political correctness restraining him, and all you know is that he has been very successful, a good negotiator, he has built a lot of things, he's flexible, and he's also not a politician. And he says he'll fix it. And we believe him because he is too much of an egotist to be proven wrong or looked at and called a liar.Public service has become elected greed. This may be our only chance to have a non-politician, despite his flaws, try and correct the mess, at least for 4 years. We must take the shot, because the consequences of putting Hillary Clinton in office are frightening. There is a tidal wave happening, and it's going to overcome much of what's happened to this country.

17 | Jeanne Clevenger | 0 | 1552975901389101_1553001344719890 | So as to appear transparent, Hillary demands that the FBI put the emails "on the table", knowing they cannot do so because it is an open investigation. If Hillary really wanted the American public to know the truth, she would set up a press conference and have Huma tell the American people what is in the emails. Liberals, how many times does Hillary have to dupe you before the truth sinks in?

With Obama, Lynch, the biased media, the corrupt Leftist Democratic Political Machine and loyal minions they're gonna have to sharpen their swords. It'll be difficult cutting the throat of this double headed beast!
21 | Ajeban Adeyemi | 0 | 1552975901389101_1553038364716188 | Deceived Christians not voting for TrumpPart 2 by Michael PearlI have read that many professing Christians have said they are not going to vote for Trump, allowing Clinton to rise to power, because they want God to judge America. Is there such acrimony against sinners that Christians are willing to sink the ship in order to kill the rats? I am compelled to shine the light of Scripture on those whose hearts are so hard against sinners that they are willing to sacrifice our children to punish sinners.When Abraham was informed that God was going to bring judgement on Sodom, a city filled with homosexuals, adulterers, and violence, Abraham pleaded with God to spare them. When Jonah was told to go to Nineveh and call them to repentance, he took a ship in the opposite direction because he wanted God to judge Nineveh. Judgement came on Jonah alone as he was swallowed by a whale. When he was finally constrained enough to go to Nineveh and his reluctant preaching provoked them to repentance, thus staying the judgment of God, Jonah sat down on a hill above the city and pouted. God interrupted his sulking with, ‚ÄúAnd should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and also much cattle?‚Äù (Jonah 4:11). The entire book of Jonah is a statement about the mercy of God compared to the self-righteousness of his prophet.It is so easy to ascend the hill of righteousness and look back down on the awful sinners. The disciples grew vengeful when they saw sinners acting like sinners. ‚ÄúAnd when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven, and consume them, even as Elias did? But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of. For the Son of man is not come to destroy men‚Äôs lives, but to save them. And they went to another village (Luke 9:54‚Äì56). The Christians who would fail to vote because they ‚Äúwant to see God judge America‚Äù do not know ‚Äúwhat manner of spirit they are of.‚ÄùChristians seem to be ignorant of the fact that God‚Äôs judgment comes on those with the most light. ‚ÄúFor the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?‚Äù (1 Peter 4:17).The sinners won‚Äôt be carried into Babylon captive; the innocent children will be.The judgment will come in a form that takes away Christian liberty and forces children to become part of the secular state. The judgment that believers are welcoming is their own suffering, not the sinners on whom they wish evil. The godless state will be strengthened. Families will suffer while the state celebrates its victory over all that is holy and pure. When your children are forcibly taken from your home and placed in government care and sent to a school where they are encouraged to have same gender sex and change their sex on a whim, when babies are killed as they come out of the womb, and all vestiges of Christianity are wiped from their minds, and the secularists celebrate their victory while you try to scratch out a living in a war torn country where taxation prevents prosperity, you will remember that you wanted judgment and you bought it with your vote. If you fail in your responsibility to vote against the hellish Hillary, it will not be God‚Äôs judgement; it will be your judgement upon the children of America.

23 | Jerry Wizman | 0 | 1552975901389101_1553149421371749 | ALIEN ARCHONS HAVE BEEN RULING THE PLANET SINCE BEFORE THE "BUY BULL" The IllumiNazis are but a predecessor of an older and even more cruel order. They've been running this planet since the dawn of time...Dragons aren't some mythological being...The Draco Reptilians came from the Alpha Draconis star system out of the Draco Constellation... They were know as the Atlanteans, Satan, Baphomet, Archons, Draconian's, in the bible they were known as the Seraphim, the Burning Ones/Serpents also the Nephilim or Elohim, the fallen angels, those who were casted out from the heavens. Both words are plural and feminine, meaning there were many gods and were androgynous. The Sumerians knew them as the Anunnaki... Anakim in Hebrew means giant...Because they are very tall 7ft-15ft and have shapeshifting abilities. In the Indian culture the were known as the Naga. Dracula in Latin means Dragon, The Order of the Dracul able to shift physically into other creatures or into the ether via the quantum field The Mayans called them Quezatcoatl, and Kukulcan the Feathered Serpent King and incorporated their images of dragons in their pyramids ... There are dragon statues all over the world, throughout the ages...The coat of arms for the city of London is two Dragons holding a red shield, which in German is Rothschild. There are 33 Dragon statues in the City of London to quell consciousness. The slaying of a Dragon by St. George. The Muslims knew them as Dajjal or Djinn or Genies... After your three wishes your soul is theirs to keep... They were also known to the Buddhist monks as the Brotherhood of Two dragons... The Red Dragons in the east and the Yellow in the west... Same goes for the native American Indians all the aboriginals knew them as the Brotherhood of the Snake... The Egyptian knew them as Horus, Anubis and Amen Ra.... That's why every religion says amen after every prayer cause they are paying homage to Satan Baphomet/ Draco Reptoids... Santa Claus is actually Satan's Claws both wearing red, both come from the fire, both have minions working feverishly. All religions and holidays are based on satanic doctrines and pagan dogmas. And if you don't believe me than you're being quite draconian about it Basilisk in Latin means King of the Serpents, as in St Peters Basilica where there lies two Dragon Statues in the Vatican as well as Obelisks, the phallus of the Dragon that is why there is at least few obelisks in every city on the planet the Freemasons put them there throughout history in order to control consciousness...The Chinese, Japanese, India,  Indonesians, Mayans, Incas all worship the Dragon in antiquity... There are Gargoyles adorn every church and cathedral.... The Watchers... The biggest trick the D-Evil can play is making humanity believe that he does not exist :/  https://m.youtube.com/#/watch?v=S23t0e2AZPYThere are over 10 thousand pyramids that align with each other on a global grid system with gps accuracy to the millimeter. In the Aegean Sea there are 13 ancient Megalithic sites that represent the 13 Illuminati Families that control the world, that when you connect them dot to dot, over 1000km area makes a perfect Maltese Cross. This is the symbol of the Monarchy, Freemasonry, Vatican, Jesuits, Knights of Malta and Templars, even Hitler's Germany. Megalithic architecture on geomantic energy sites, in conjunction with an occult esoteric satanic Freemasonry religion of Kabbhalism, aka the Lucifer experiment in order to control humanities consciousness... and create portals into Agartha/Hollow Earth, hence disappearance of boats, planes in the Bermuda Triangle and Dragon's Triangle... http://chani.invisionzone.com/uploads/monthly_08_2013/post-248-0-56239100-1376895880.jpg

"I fear he has unintentionally and negatively affected public trust in both the Justice Department and the FBI," Holder wrote in an op-ed. "And he has allowed ‚Äî again without improper motive ‚Äî misinformation to be spread by partisans with less pure intentions."

2 | Jim Spears Jr. | 309 | 1552915404728484_1552924538060904 | He talks about public trust in the DOJ and FBI . This is the same guy that was involved in the fast and furious gun trade. And Lynch meets with Billy boy during hillary's email case. How can you trust people like them.
3 | Cindy Piepszowski Albers | 100 | 1552915404728484_1552941118059246 | ....and what did Fast & Furious do, my man?

You've got real nerve telling me who "negatively affected the public trust"!!!!
4 | Joshua Ricker | 78 | 1552915404728484_1552922848061073 | I dont think anyone has trust issues with the FBI for doing their job. The public trust issue is with the Clintons, as it has always been... on account of the fact they are criminals.
5 | Scot Hecker | 60 | 1552915404728484_1552918968061461 | Nothing new ..Holder never wanted to enforce justice unless it was against the agenda..Oh ,I would like to also suggest to Holder that there was evidence against Clinton but she was set free due to being careless..
6 | Juan Gonzalez | 25 | 1552915404728484_1552919351394756 | The doj failed to prosecute Hillary for classified emails but we send a submarine troop to jail because he took a picture inside sub wow that's America for u
7 | Nick Nicholas | 25 | 1552915404728484_1552933061393385 | I fear Mr.Holder would be singing a different tune if roles reversed. Then again That's not possible. It's Hillary Thsts been lying and cheating all along. She basically got a pardon in July..
8 | David Bar | 24 | 1552915404728484_1552918828061475 | Director comey's testimony before the legislative branch was no longer valid , so he had to let the congress know of the new developments ; imagine if these new information had come out after the election  , it would have only reinforced the idea od rigged system in favor of clinton

I don't care that people with damaging info on the Clintons died mysteriously. I don't care that Bill Clinton is a rapist. I don't care that as secretary of state she gave weapons contracts to countries that made huge donations to the Clinton Foundation.I don't care that she has received millions from Islamic countries that abuse women and behead Christians and gays. I don't care that she was indecisive on providing adequate protection for the embassy in Benghazi resulting in the death of four Americans.I don't care that she says unborn children have no rights.And I certainly don't care that she had a private server that she used to email classified info through and then had her lawyers wipe it clean to hide evidence. . actually I do care and that is why I‚Äôm voting for TRUMP!!
15 | Jay Bee | 12 | 1552915404728484_1552921514727873 | I hope Comey is an honorable man, and has a reason for all of this. However, this is bringing back bad memories of Bush looking for WMDs in Iraq, where there werent any.

18 | Peggy Tressel | 9 | 1552915404728484_1552927008060657 | If Holder had any credibility, his opinion might matter. He would still be wrong. The past and present Attorneys General are who damaged those reputations. Since he has no credibility, it doesn't matter.
19 | Ruben Castro | 2 | 1552915404728484_1063663393750396 | The people of this Country already not trust the FBI and the DOJ, I think the FBI is trying to regain the trust of all of us. Besides, is Hillary's fault, not theirs. And finally, you're another corrupt guy, nobody listens to you.
20 | Susan Brewer | 6 | 1552915404728484_1552934031393288 | My God, facebook has been buzzing since July about the failure to do their duty by both DOJ  and FBI and this guy has the audacity to lay the blame on just Comey. What is this? Save Loretta Lynch despite her meeting with Bill Clinton in Arizona? Despite her efforts to give immunity to Hillarys staff? Despite her refusal to persue evidence of perjury and reckless handling of classified info. You don't get off that easy. Bucks stops at the top.
21 | Ric Winthrop | 1 | 1552915404728484_721390481358867 | Comey is on a Republican initiated witch hunt. This a..hole has just politicized what should be an impartial office. Wonder what the Republican Party promised Comey in return....maybe the position of Attorney General? Doesn't anyone think it odd that Comey made his big announcement before he even had a warrant for the emails? The whole purpose was to smear Clinton, with no actual proof, just prior to the election.
22 | Evon Ruth | 2 | 1552915404728484_721436438020938 | Unless Clinton's emails reveal that she molested a dozen men, cheated on 3 spouses, is facing a rape case in December, is facing a fraud case in November for ripping off students, has bullied hundreds of contractors and workers into accepting half what they were promised, mocked a handicapped man, disparagingly treated a deceased vets family, threatened to punish women who get abortions, profited off a charity and used its money to bribe two attorney generals, and developed an oddly cozy relationship with a foreign leader who's trying to alter the course of our election, I'm sticking with Hillary. Credit unknown, but tweaked it and pasted it on, keep it going!
23 | MaryLu McFall | 3 | 1552915404728484_1552983421388349 | I am heartily sick of our government bureaucrats, politicians, career congress people, Senators, FBI, CIA, NASA, Governors, State department officials, media experts and whoever else has become irrelevant to the everyday life of senior citizens, the entire middle class, first responders, veterans, and preachers/ministers. I can only speak for myself but I would wager there are a lot who agree with my nausea.
24 | John Cranston | 2 | 1552915404728484_1552937804726244 | Comey did "unintentionally and negatively affect public trust in both the Justice Department and the FBI" when he did not pursue the investigation in July.  In his statement he says there is evidence that he actions were criminal, but he didn't think a reasonable prosecutor (wat he means is Loretta Lynch) would file charges.  This time he informed Congress (not the public) of the status of an investifation which he had previously been called to testify about.  The blatant obstructure that Holder and others are attempting right now are more damning than anything that Comey did (and that says a lot).
25 | Thomas Entrican | 3 | 1552915404728484_721378774693371 | Oh Mr. Holder, the people lost their faith in the Justice department the moment Bill Clinton boarded Loretta Lynch's plane last summer. They lost trust in the FBI back when Hoover used his crevice tool to get dirt on so many innocent people.

Out of the 650,000 emails found on former congressman Anthony Weiner's laptop, only a small number will likely be related to the probe of Hillary Clinton's private server.

3 | Henrik Ahlm | 85 | 1552893388064019_1552893614730663 | Why vote Clinton and not Trump?It is one of the most simple questions to answer if you got a normal functioning brain.Like the editorial board of one of the world's most respected business newspapers said today:"Mrs Clinton carries enough baggage to fill a Boeing 747. She is not trusted by the majority of voters. But she is manifestly more competent than Mr Trump whose braggadocio, divisiveness and meanness are on daily display."The essence is, that Trump is not fit for public office and Trump will not be the 45th President of the US. Period!And U.S. gun owners - men in black are back on Election day!

Unless those emails contain the tax returns Donald Trump is still hiding from the public, I don't care. (And no, he's not required to release them. But every other presidential candidate has. And since he's accused of having ties to Russia, I'd like to know who his business associates are and who he donates to. But that's just me)

13 | Tracy Hill | 15 | 1552893388064019_1552909451395746 | Purely speculation on your part NBC, good try.  Even the White House states they don't know the information that is contained in these emails.  You will just have to wait like the rest of us.

If they did not have significant info , FBI wouldn't have reopen the case . So please stop trying to lessen the gravity of Hillary's crimes and let the justice work , if we still have a justice system standing for its citizens.
15 | Darline Box Kandalec | 5 | 1552893388064019_1552930198060338 | "Likely" isn't a definitive term. With his wife "sharing" that laptop with him during HRC's term as SOS, that really ups the odds. Also, it calls into question to me why Huma didn't see any of his, let's say, "extracurricular activity" while sharing this laptop and she would have had equal access to it as he would, or maybe she did see things he was up to but looked the other way. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to open the files kept on a computer or to look at the search engine history. Stop downplaying this.

20 | Lisa M Plante-Poirier | 13 | 1552893388064019_1552897174730307 | Regardless, even if its one. its too many! They both (Clinton & Huma) are liars and should be penalized .
21 | Imogene Aldridge Hall | 10 | 1552893388064019_1552898748063483 | I watched this video and nothing was mentioned about a small number of them likely related to Hillary's private server. NBC should provide a link to the source.
22 | Jim Spears Jr. | 6 | 1552893388064019_1552919998061358 | People saying vote for her despite her baggage is funny. Look at the years her baggage has been packing. So many scandals it's unbelievable clearly showing she's a habitual liar who thinks they are above the law.
23 | Kiela Hammel | 1 | 1552893388064019_561111744083480 | Says who?? The cache of emails goes back several years, the official told NBC News. Who is the official who's giving information? I doubt this official is apart of the FBI or knows what's going on.
24 | Darryll Wayne Blount | 3 | 1552893388064019_1552902778063080 | it seems the FBI has been in control of this laptop since late september and is just now getting a subpoena on sunday to look at emails that they are somehow saying that ,even though they havent looked at them ,have some evidence thats relevant to the clinton email case ... how can you not read something and know whats in it?
25 | Robyn Gibbons | 1 | 1552893388064019_1552929054727119 | Its only because she has worked with the candidate...neither woman can control what their husbands do...on or off a computer and I hope my boss doesnt find me incompetent just because I cant figure technology out that 30yrs ago we hardly had.

1 | Sean Gallagher | 18 | 1552852314734793_1552861958067162 | Just two of many frightening and unacceptable reasons not to vote for Donald Trump:1) Trump will take away your healthcare, and if you have a pre-existing medical condition, start getting your affairs in order, because Trump /Pence think that if you aren‚Äôt wealthy, you don‚Äôt have a right to medical care.2) Ladies, Trump /Pence want to occupy your Uterus! Think Supreme Court nominations. Trump /Pence so oppose your reproductive rights, you will no longer be in charge of your body. Trump /Pence believe that even if you are raped by a mentally disabled relative, you should have to bear that revolting rapists child.Think before you vote for two of the most extremely conservative men to run for office.

3 | Jay Kris | 1 | 1552852314734793_1553079218045436 | Its hard to vote when they are both irresponsible, its hard to have the right to vote when your rights does not matter to the government, its hard to vote when all you hear about are racistism acts, Its hard to vote when this land is eaten through for more profits in the hands of the greedy people.

We submit our ballots but does our ballots really count?
4 | Annie C.

And she & her camp have the shameless audacity to ask for transparency?! Hillary has put the H in Hypocrisy! We would not be here if she didn't believe she was above the law! She and her circle are the absolute epitome of everything Americans hate about the government! Double-standard Democrats & media rather keep their heads in the sand regardless of an avalanche of evidence against the ever vile, ever vindictive, ever deceptive, & ever crooked Clinton Cartel! May justice truly prevail. How absolutely disgusting to see these asstards praise Comey in July and now condemn him. Vile Hypocrites!

8 | Henrik Ahlm | 0 | 1552852314734793_1552940298059328 | Why vote Clinton and not Trump?It is one of the most simple questions to answer if you got a normal functioning brain.Like the editorial board of one of the world's most respected business newspapers said today:"Mrs Clinton carries enough baggage to fill a Boeing 747. She is not trusted by the majority of voters. But she is manifestly more competent than Mr Trump whose braggadocio, divisiveness and meanness are on daily display."The essence is, that Trump is not fit for public office and Trump will not be the 45th President of the US. Period!And U.S. gun owners - men in black are back on Election day!
9 | Scott Geer | 3 | 1552852314734793_1552880161398675 | Only Hillary Clinton made congress and others spend millions and millions of tax dollars having hearings and investigating her to find that she lied, that would not have been spent if she would of simply told the truth in the first place !

10 | Scott Geer | 4 | 1552852314734793_1552877951398896 | Only Hillary Clinton said she will raise taxes on the middle class. If the democratic policies continue more companies will leave the US and Hillary will need some way to pay her promised entitlements.
11 | Mike L King | 1 | 1552852314734793_1552864118066946 | Yes, it is sad that these are the two best we could come up with. Trump is the better out of the Two in my opinion and he will get my vote. I am SICK of CAREER POLITICIANS and Politicians who have been in our offices almost as long as I have been alive and I am 47 years old. Yes, we have politicians who are still in office from when I was born. That is the problem with our country. I hope a lot of these DUNDERHEAD Americans in my country will seek to do better next time instead of always trying to MAKE HISTORY with first MIXED race president and now with First FEMALE president. My gosh, can't we just vote for someone on a non historical basis. But then, this election is historical because this election tells us and you the world if we are still a FREE REPUBLIC or a SOCIALIST country. I pray for a FREE REPUBLIC.

When Linda Gottlieb hails a taxi cab in New York City and asks the driver to take her home, she has one word to describe how she feels: embarrassed.

Why? Because she has to tell the driver to take her to Trump Place.

2 | Tim Wenzel | 63 | 1552808878072470_1552810924738932 | I have a funny feeling that she has the means to move if she was really that embarrassed.
3 | Debbie Mossey | 50 | 1552808878072470_1552813328072025 | NBC News .. this is not news. I don't even think the Enquirer or ET would run this.

5 | Sam Congdon | 23 | 1552808878072470_1552831738070184 | You know, there's a lot of homeless veterans and homeless people in general who I'm sure would love the opportunity to complain about the name of the apartment building they live in because at least it's a roof over their heads. I'm not feeling particularly sympathetic towards complaints from someone who probably makes more in a month than I do all year.

9 | Yael Teresa Harmon | 1 | 1552808878072470_1552869311399760 | FOR THOSE WHO are undecided, PLEASE consider this: One tax plan over another tax plan, one economic policy over another policy - are NOT the differences that will help this country. Because of the fact that we are severely bogged down with the richest snubbing the poor, powerful employers cheating women and others out of the salaries they deserve, and the 1 percent not caring at all for the rest of us ‚Äì it‚Äôs a boatload of proof that listening to what candidates shout out loud from their podiums - is the ultimate WRONG thing to do.  That said, we must push aside trumps corrupt business scandals and Hillary‚Äôs bountiful conspiracies ‚Äì and look at what these two have done as individuals prior to being brand names. That alone should tell us more about who each of them truly are - as opposed to what each other‚Äôs opponents have deviously supplanted into mainstream thinking against the other ‚Äì for years.This is crucial because after the election most of the hyped promises will be left by the wayside - and we will suffer ‚Äì because ‚Äì the hatred that was bolstered during this campaign ‚Äì will remain. The disenfranchised will not be better off but will remain crippled by their own fear - of people with beliefs that are different than theirs.This campaign has clearly brought all sorts of people out of the woodwork - spewing evil unlike never before. Therefore, it‚Äôs essential to look at nothing but how these two were as twenty somethings. Research how they related and comingled with the world ‚Äì before they were brands. Only by exploring how they came to be ‚Äì will you get a true sense of who can help the things that truly matter - in terms of humanity in the long run. Latching onto fears and buying into conspiracy theories about either one is simply unwise. Research their beginnings. Please. (PS: this post is not for those who are staunch supporters of either candidate ‚Äì so spare us the piling on of unproven conspiracies regarding either candidate. Let the undecided explore these two as younger adults.) In fact, no comments of any kind would be ideal ‚Äì just cutting and pasting.

Then they will preach equality and how being a man or woman should make no difference, when thats actually the only thing that does matter to them.Absolutely ridiculous.

22 | Anna Schmidt | 0 | 1552808878072470_1552857794734245 | All weekend have been thinking about The FBI Directors behavior this close to the election. I am not at all surprised by it because this is what we have seen since The Tea Party took over Congress. There has been absolutely ZERO concern about ethics in their rabid campaign to discredit and delegitimize President Obama and Hillary Clinton. The Republicans on the Benghazi and Email Committees had no intention to seek the truth they were looking to find fault and keep Hillary's approval rating as low as possible.The timing of this email story Friday 11 days before the election is just more of the same. These men were elected to Congress to help our country prosper, and instead they have made it their mission to take away women's rights and LGBT rights. They have worked to oppose President Obama's agenda whenever possible and they tried to ensure his failure. They have shown ignorance in their opposition to reducing the use of fossil fuel and the development of a clean energy economy and instead denied Climate Science calling it a hoax. One thing the Trump voter and the Clinton voter have in common is the disgust with the Republicans in Congress. It is time to replace these destructive individuals with people who care about protecting the rights of our country's diverse population. Leaders who will foster our economic growth as a clean energy superpower to both tackle global warming and create good jobs in small businesses. Leaders who have as a primary goal to spend their time making our government work to help people and keep us safe. Hillary Clinton has shown us during this campaign just what kind of a team player she truly is in working with Senator Bernie Sanders after the primary to come up with the most progressive agenda ever. She has the unique skill set, leadership skills and grace to bring Congress together and make government work to tackle the problems facing our country. Democrats work to help our country Tea Party Republicans work to help themselves. I voted BLUE! Hillary Clinton is a leader who will keep us safe from enemies both foreign and domestic. The GOP members of Congress have been an enemy to our nation by spending millions to discredit and obstruct.
23 | Scott Geer | 2 | 1552808878072470_1552880548065303 | Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, along with Barack Obama, single-handedly created the instability in the middle-east by 1. Supporting the overthrow of Maummar Gaddafi in Libya (2011), 2. Not stabilizing Libya during it's Civil war (2012), and 3. Allowing ISIS to grow in Libya, push through Egypt into the Middle-East and create the Muslim Refugee Crisis (2012 to date). The result of this failed Secretary of State Clinton has resulted in killing and violence in the Middle-East and eventually caused the UK to break from the European Union to protect it's citizens from Radical Islamic Terrorism. Clinton has been paid by Middle-Eastern Countries for decades through her Clinton Foundation and will destroy this nation through promises to Middle-Eastern interests which have been bought and paid for.

10 | Peter James Wambold | 0 | 1552781314741893_1553010254718999 | HilLIARy and Obama drop bombs and destroy city after city, warning the bad guys in advance that they are coming. Then they wonder where all the bad guys are and what do we do with all these refugees? Then they leave the bad guys come back, and they bring untold numbers of refugees that they created here to help our economy...? WHATYou can't make this sht up, they are that stupid
11 | Chad Hance | 5 | 1552781314741893_1552805611406130 | This is just a fraction of the death and destruction due directly to Obama and Hillary policies.
12 | Michael Kwiatkowski | 0 | 1552781314741893_1553322528021105 | He should have been fighting for his family, not letting others do it for him.

15 | Scott Geer | 7 | 1552781314741893_1552880971398594 | Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, along with Barack Obama, created the Refugee Crisis in the middle-east by 1. Supporting the overthrow of Maummar Gaddafi in Libya (2011), 2. Not stabilizing Libya during it's Civil war (2012), and 3. Allowing ISIS to grow in Libya, push through Egypt into the Middle-East and create the Muslim Refugee Crisis (2012 to date). The result of this failed Secretary of State Clinton has resulted in killing and violence in the Middle-East and eventually caused the UK to break from the European Union to protect it's citizens from Radical Islamic Terrorism. Clinton has been paid by Middle-Eastern Countries for decades through her Clinton Foundation and will destroy this nation through promises to Middle-Eastern interests which have been bought and paid for.
16 | Denise Spencer | 8 | 1552781314741893_1552781644741860 | Trumps Foreign Policy:So Trump's policy is to whine and cry about ISIS and do the same thing that Obama is doing...except he wants to set up concentration camps in America and have his special panels decide if you have freedom or not....and he wants to spend a lot of money on the military that they say they don't need and we don't have because he wants to give all our money in tax cuts to oligarchs....all while he is buddy buddy with Putin telling us how great he is and suggesting NATO, Freedom, Liberty, and countries are up for grabs...and he thinks we should be using our military to invade and steal other countries oil for international oil cartels...He wants to commit war crimes and torture everyone and says torture works when the CIA says Nope.He wants to keep Gitmo open as a symbol that America Tortures POWs and commits war crimes at will.He wants to throw Americans in GITMO with no trial or due process.He speaks openly of using nuclear weapons.

19 | Rei Rei Domingo | 1 | 1552781314741893_1553191788034179 | Sad because trump and his supporters wants to kill these people. Little did they know, the God they pray to under Christian values is not a white man with blue eyes. Jesus is a middle eastern man like these people.Not to mention Trump wants to cast them out and close the borders and deny these people who went through more than enough, from coming to America.Trump is all about making America White again and branding his business for himself and taking the spotlight for himself.That is why we're gonna:#voteblue #hillary2016#hillaryforpresident #nevertrump

More than a year after a grainy cellphone video shocked the nation, jury selection in the murder trial of a former South Carolina police officer who killed an unarmed black man is set to begin Monday.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Sasha Bens | 126 | 1552745041412187_1552752014744823 | Police officers like this, give great, honest police officers a bad name, and at times, make their job harder then it has to be. It's so disappointing.
2 | Jessie Jackson | 55 | 1552745041412187_1552759508077407 | I was wondering how long these murder cases was going stay I the background....this should be a quick factual conviction...but with global white supremacy ...we know how it will probably turn out
3 | Aeren Martinez | 31 | 1552745041412187_1552760568077301 | Every time I see this video I only get more angry. Before the Bundy trial I would have said they have a slam-dunk case against the cop, but now I question whether any real justice is possible.
4 | Tim Tully Sr. | 8 | 1552745041412187_1552952391391452 | The cop said he was in fear for his life--- maybe he was overweight and feared running after the guy would cause a heart attack
5 | Eddie Franca | 9 | 1552745041412187_1553015294718495 | I can read it now, cop acquitted of wrong doings, he acted according to corrupt department policy and he feared for his life!!!
6 | Anthony Howard | 19 | 1552745041412187_1552754498077908 | I stand by the police, but this murderer deserves to fry
7 | Larry Bittner | 9 | 1552745041412187_1552920058061352 | Let me remember?  He's white?  If that's the case, why hold a trial at all - just say, "tried and acquitted"... remember, the Bundy's are NOT guilty and walked... white people walk while non-whites hang or get the max... I hate WHITE PRIVILEGE and I am a white guy !
8 | Megan Frisque | 5 | 1552745041412187_1553202724699752 | It's ironic to see the outrage by people only because it was caught on video but if you paid attention to Daren Wilson testimony this is exactly what he did to Mike Brown. And Wilson admitted it. Only difference being is the lack of video evidence. Either every American has civil rights or no one does. Just some food for thought.
9 | Sean John | 8 | 1552745041412187_1552774028075955 | Accountability!!!!!!!!!!!!! If we do not get on the phone, write letters, who are we fooling, this will continue. Having a casual conversation on social media won't help him or the next victim who might not have a video. We are held accountable, they must be also held accountable even more so because our taxes votes give them the ability. It's time to restructure their role in our community or fire the department.
10 | David Wajda | 3 | 1552745041412187_1552752714744753 | O! So against what all the SJWs are trying to shove down my throat, this cop is going to trial for shooting an unarmed man? Hmmm, another myth dispelled
11 | Ben Thigpen | 2 | 1552745041412187_1552818524738172 | For all the comments by the racist democrats. I am a white Trump supporter. I believe this man broke the law. But the law he broke did not carry the death penalty with it. I don't know anyone that supports this kind of behavior. I hope the former officer has to answer in full. So please stow the small minded racism!
12 | Trina Brady | 0 | 1552745041412187_1552828991403792 | Not that I am saying it justifies the shooting but everyone seems to leave out that part about Scott having vague information about whether he owned the car or had insurance and that he ran from the traffic stop because of a bench warrant for his arrest.
13 | Janice Mortensen | 1 | 1552745041412187_1552875141399177 | I have little confidence that the jury will fault the police officer, even though you'd need to be blind to not see Mr. Slager running away, not threatening the shooter.
14 | Jason Tarter | 1 | 1552745041412187_1552944891392202 | I'm not endorsing the officer but it's got to be hard day in day out. Dealing with the good the bad and the ugly 1/3 of military come back with ptsd for this kind of stuff. This was a bad idea using deadly force without attempt of non deadly. He deserves what he gets and I hope it's more then a slap on the wrist. I hope more it's unbiased and dealt with the upmost consideration of message sent to the public. Eliminate color black, white and blue this was a murder and should be treated as such
15 | Yvonne Chatmon | 0 | 1552745041412187_1553060651380626 | I'm really hoping they convict this pos. Throwing down a weapon and trying to pin it on the VICTIM only proves he knows he did the wrong thing.
16 | Marc Yager | 0 | 1552745041412187_1553275004692524 | I almost always stand with the police, not on this one though. This was straight murder, and this man's family deserves justice.
17 | ÿ¥Ÿäÿ®ÿ±ÿØ ÿ®ŸäŸÑ | 12 | 1552745041412187_1552767481409943 | I bet this happened millions of times without consequences before the cellphone was invented.
18 | Les Brown | 3 | 1552745041412187_1552762081410483 | There is good and bad in all groups in life this man is clearly guilty with enough video to back it up, Just like the Clinton videos she guilty to.
19 | Lisa Franklin | 0 | 1552745041412187_1552861144733910 | When someone runs away from you the threat is no longer present and you'll be charged with murder. The same should apply to cops. I'll raise my hand in victory on this one if he actually serves a sentence comparable to civilians for the same situation. At most he should have chased after him and cuffed him.
20 | Stephen Mckiernan | 0 | 1552745041412187_1552947781391913 | Just in: Clinton is now LEADING in polls in important battleground states, such as Qatar, Iraq, Iran, and Syria And hopefully soon...San Quentin !!!
21 | Doug Lambert | 2 | 1552745041412187_1552781614741863 | Occurred in April 2015. Yet, in Chicago, CPD Officer Jason Van Dyke still hasn't gone to trial over a retreating suspect he shot 16 times in October, 2014. Van Dyke is charge with first degree murder. He and other officers present falsified their written accounts of the incident. Dash cam video proved their stories were false.
22 | Bill Karim | 0 | 1552745041412187_1553032011383490 | As much as I'd like to see this guy fried and served over a bed of rice, what he really deserves is life behind bars and a prison marriage to Big Bobo
23 | Anda Glend | 2 | 1552745041412187_1552778001408891 | if the man killed was my familly i will spend my whole life taking down that officer's familly members that way the police will think twice before killing someone like that
24 | Deb Wood | 1 | 1552745041412187_1552791128074245 | Why did the guy in the green shirt jump outta his car and run? Oh yeah, he had broken the law....just sayin...
25 | Gary Basham | 9 | 1552745041412187_1552769688076389 | I just came here to see racist Trump supporters blame the victim.
