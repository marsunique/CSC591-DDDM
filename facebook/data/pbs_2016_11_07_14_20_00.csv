1 | Rebecca Laskey | 1 | 10154741593573675_10154741670898675 | DONALD TRUMP ANNOUNCEMENT ~ REGARDING THE NEWSWEEK REPORT:TRUMP IS A “HUGE” NATIONAL SECURITY RISK BECAUSE OF HIS BUSINESS, FINANCIAL AND PERSONAL TIES TO RUSSIA, CHINA, SAUDI ARABIA, IRAN, ETC…..In a stunning and damning expose just released, the truth behind the ties between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin are revealed, and American allies in Europe are growing increasingly concerned by Russian espionage and its interference in the U.S. election.A Friday Newsweek article by Kurt Eichenwald reveals the truth behind the Trump campaign and its ties to Russia’s President Vladimir Putin. It also shows the history behind Russia’s support of the Republican candidate through espionage and cyberattacks discovered by both U.S. and allied European intelligence agencies.According to Eichenwald, American allies are concerned about Russian interference in the U.S. election and that Donald Trump’s statements denying any collusion in recent cyberattacks have only encouraged Putin to become more aggressive in his espionage against Western countries. Eichenwald cites the input of government officials, law enforcement officers, and intelligence agencies in both the U.S. and Europe.According to information gained by Western allied intelligence sources, the Kremlin’s interference into the U.S. election is aimed more at crippling Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in revenge for what Putin felt was interference in Russian elections. Clinton’s statement in 2011, saying the Russian election was “neither free nor fair“ in regards to obvious cheating, has sent Putin into a rage and made him determined to destroy Clinton. Putin was also enticed by Trump’s compliments of his strength as a leader.Some of the information gained by Western intelligence sources reveal that Donald Trump has been surrounded by a number of advisers with ties to Putin or with financial and family ties to Russia. Former campaign manager Paul Manafort was forced to resign when it was revealed that he had ties to a pro-Russian Ukraine official. Carter Page, another former Trump adviser, is being investigated by U.S. and European intelligence agencies for engaging in back-channel discussions with Russian officials. Intelligence has also revealed that Trump adviser Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn is intimately tied to RT, a Russian news agency involved in distributing Russian propaganda.Donald Trump and his campaign have also been found to be spreading Russian propaganda. The Kremlin has been distributing misinformation as part of their normal activities via various networks, through both anonymous internet trolls, RT, and Sputnik, another propaganda news source. A manipulated document from one of the anonymous internet sources found itself being recited by Trump at a campaign rally. The campaign has also been spreading rumors from Sputnik, including a piece attacking Newsweek that was forwarded by Trump staff to a number of reporters in the U.S. with requests that those reporters pursue the false story.In accordance with his position as presidential nominee, U.S. intelligence agencies have briefed Trump about Russia’s attempts to influence the election, but Trump has persisted in publicly denying these serious allegations, calling them unreliable, and dismissing them as possibly being perpetrated by some “400-pound guy sitting on their bed” or even a child.European officials have told Newsweek that Trump’s statements have alarmed our NATO partners, because Trump refuses to believe the intelligence briefings he received or simply doesn’t understand them. They are also convinced that Trump could be misleading the American people for reasons of his own.One British official said that members of the U.K. government who are fully aware of Russia’s interference find Trump’s response “quite disturbing.” They’re concerned that should he be elected, Trump would ignore and dismiss his own and allied intelligence services.Western law enforcement and intelligence agencies say that the Russian hacking and disinformation campaign includes tens of thousands of people in Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Novosibirsk. They say there are also operations inside the United States, working from New York City, Miami, and Washington D.C., mainly using Russian immigrants, although other foreign nationals and American citizens are also involved. According to intelligence received, those involved are being paid via a Russian pension scheme. One U.S. official told Newsweek that evidence shows that many of the Americans and other foreign nationals involved are unaware that they are part of Russia’s propaganda machine.American intelligence is also aware that Russia used cyber espionage and propaganda to interfere with other elections in the West, including the German elections last month and the June Brexit vote in the U.K., the results of both of which weakened the ties between those countries and the EU and NATO.According to a European intelligence expert, Russia is releasing its disinformation to disrupt the U.S. election through WikiLeaks, but states that the “pipeline” through which the information flows contains numerous steps and so many filters that it is likely that the WikiLeaks organization itself does not know the source of the information.Interestingly enough, despite the Russian president’s support of Donald Trump, at one point, support for the Republican nominee was halted due to his volatile and unstable nature. According to intelligence sources, the Kremlin backed off supporting Trump when he attacked the Kahn Gold Star family publicly. The Kremlin assumed that the nominee would be forced to withdraw from the race due to his psychological unfitness, so put the hacking campaign on hold. According to reports provided to Western intelligence sources, even Putin thought Trump was unfit to be president, despite the advantages to him of a Trump presidency.According to information provided to Western intelligence agencies, Putin is satisfied that his campaign of cyber espionage has turned the tide in his direction. Putin has told his associates that even if Clinton wins the White House, she will be too busy rectifying the chaos that his leaked misinformation has wrought to interfere with his plans in Syria, Ukraine, and elsewhere.European allies are particularly stunned by Donald Trump’s refusal to credit his own intelligence services, and British officials were particularly horrified when Trump dismissed the validity of those sources. According to one British official the most disturbing evidence of Trump’s negligence was during the third presidential debate. In rebuttal to Clinton’s accusation that he was encouraging Russian cyberattacks, Trump said that she had no idea where the cyberattacks were coming from.‘Hillary, you have no idea… Our country has no idea.’According to Newsweek, all of our intelligence sources and those of our NATO allies know that Russia is behind the hacking. Although Trump has been briefed, he continues to dismiss the information. Eichenwald sums up the exposes with some chilling thoughts:‘Should the United States, the last remaining superpower, tilt its policies away from NATO to the benefit of Russia, the alliance between America and Western Europe could be transformed in unprecedented ways. And so, for perhaps the first time since World War II, countries in Western Europe fear that the American election, should Trump win, could trigger events that imperil their national security and do potentially irreparable harm to the alliances that have kept the continent safe for decades.’Top Pentagon Commanders: We'll Quit if Trump is Elected:http://occupydemocrats.com/2016/05/11/top-pentagon-commanders-well-quit-trump-becomes-commander-chief-2/IF YOU CARE, SHARE!
2 | Rebecca Laskey | 1 | 10154741593573675_10154741671913675 | B-R-E-A-K-I-N-G - STUNNING REPORT SAYS THAT ANTI-CLINTON FBI AGENTS, LEAKED INFORMATION TO GET TRUMP ELECTED:Hillary Clinton has been “EXHONERATED” in the Email Scandal, again.  No wrongdoing, No Charges, Case Closed.The Clinton Foundation is NOT under Investigation by the FBI.  However, the Trump Foundation is still under Investigation by the New York Attorney General for “Pay to Play” and “Self-Dealing”.There is an anti-Clinton faction in an FBI office that is suspected of releasing and leaking information in an attempt to get Donald Trump elected president.Stunning Report Finds Anti-Clinton FBI Agents Are Trying To Get Trump Elected PresidentThere is an anti-Clinton faction in an FBI office that is suspected of releasing and leaking information in an attempt to get Donald Trump elected president.Reuters reported:The new emails turned up as FBI investigators were examining electronic devices used by former Democratic Representative Anthony Weiner in connection with an alleged “sexting” scandal. Weiner’s estranged wife, Huma Abedin, is a Clinton confidante.Two law enforcement sources familiar with the FBI’s New York Field Office, which initially discovered the emails, said a faction of investigators based in the office is known to be hostile to Hillary Clinton. A spokeswoman for the FBI’s New York office said she had no knowledge about this.Democratic Party sources said such a faction was likely responsible for a recent surge in media leaks on alleged details of an ongoing FBI investigation of the Clinton Foundation.The lasting scandal to come out of the 2016 election might be the FBI, not Hillary Clinton’s emails. It is clear that there is something amiss in the bureau. If Democrats win control of the Senate on Tuesday, it is almost certain that they will launch an investigation into the FBI’s investigation of Clinton.FBI agents could be violating the law in an attempt to use their public sector jobs to interfere in a presidential election. What the anti-Clinton faction of the FBI is engaging in is a threat to US democracy.A group of FBI agents who are hostile to Hillary Clinton are trying to undermine a presidential election. That sentence reads like the plot to a Hollywood blockbuster, but that is what appears to be happening in real life in the final days of a presidential campaign.These FBI Agents were working with Rudy Giuliani to help Trump.  Agents who are Anti-Hillary are working with the Trump Campaign, Breitbart’s Bannon and a couple of others within the Trump Campaign.  Their Campaign knew in advance, that Comey was going to issue the Email to the GOP.  The GOP got it first, then it was passed on the Democrats.  There is also talk about emails being synched into Antony Weiner’s Emails, by the FBI and a proper Warrant, was not obtained?Should Hillary Clinton win the presidency, she may end up doing so by overcoming more obstacles than any other presidential candidate in US history.Clinton Foundation:  Trump and Fox News are Saying Clinton "Likely" to be Indicted.  This is a False and Ill Informed, Inaccurate and Without Merit.  Fox News has walked back their claims.Nor, is the Anthony Weiner investigation, “Likely” to lead to an indictment against Hillary Clinton.Comey is being Investigated for interfering with the Election.  “Hatch Act”Rudy Giuliani is also under investigation for leaking information to the Trump Campaign.Democrats now have all the motivation that they will ever need to get out and vote.STOP THE RIGHT-WING, ALT-RIGHT MADNESS DEMOCRATS!  REJECT AND DEFEAT TRUMP AND THE GOP.  VOTE BLUE UP AND DOWN THE BALLOT!!!IF YOU CARE, SHARE!

"The clear trend is away from the death penalty," according to one expert.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Angie Quinn | 8 | 10154741555343675_10154741605393675 | it's already been established the death penalty does nothing to discourage crime. the cost to taxpayers, for a case where the death penalty is sought, is roughly twice that of a case where it is not sought: it actually is 'cheaper to keep'em'. we also can no longer rationally justify locking people up for ridiculously long sentences in relation to marijuana: we are quickly (and in some states have literally) running out of space to jail people. then there's the issue of back-logged DNA kits ~ several hundreds of thousands ~ either improperly processed and/or tested...or worse, not being processed at all.
2 | Bill Byrn | 0 | 10154741555343675_10154741642663675 | I personally don't have a problem with it.I see it from the point of view of tax dollars. Why pay for a guy to live if he is never coming out. (After he runs out of appeals).Repeat offenders, sexual predators, child molesters,etc....Have a consensus on where the cut-off line is the start the injection line.I do not see the rehabilitation argument. If you're not an honest, working contributing citizen then get in the injection line.
3 | Patricia Abbott | 0 | 10154741555343675_10154741702668675 | The death penalty has never proved to be a deterrent. The appeals process is very costly to taxpayers. It should be abolished on a national basis. Note:  The US is one of very few countries that still practices the death penalty:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment_by_country

It's time the US caught up with the rest of the free world in this area and many others.
5 | Angel Morini | 0 | 10154741555343675_10154741677283675 | It's never clear that the person they are killing did that or any other crime. Police and prosecutors just want to pin it on someone so they can pat themselves on the back. What is clear that the serial rapist/killer would do a lot less raping and killing of rape kits were processed and a national database were established. Because while the guy who didn't do it is languishing on death row, the guy who did it is out there doing it again and again.
6 | Tamara Mason | 4 | 10154741555343675_10154741647948675 | Look at all the people who've been cleared/exonerated through DNA evidence, The Innocence Project and similar organizations. You can't undo death. You can't say "my bad, we thought we had the right guy. Oops..."

16 | Allen Sauner | 0 | 10154741555343675_10154741642298675 | Its not intended to discourage crime Angie. The death penalty has only been intended to end repeating offenders from victimizing others. Even the law doesn't deter any crime but establishes crime and punishment.  Rapists keep raing, batterers keep injuring people,  murderers keep killing people and all regardless of law or consequences.  Those people you put down to end their offending.

5 | Scottas Sevelis | 0 | 10154741492518675_10154741697548675 | A Short List of Some of Hillary’s Many Crimes - share!Here are a few of Hillary’s crimes. Feel free to share.1. Perjury: Why not start with a blast from the Clinton past? Hillary Clinton signed documents testifying that she turned over all work-related emails to the State Department, on orders from a federal judge, under penalty of perjury. We already have indisputable proof she violated this sworn statement… thousands of times. The cloud of false statements under oath surrounding Hillary Clinton is thousands of times thicker than the one around Bill. Democrats seem to have found a hidden clause in the Constitution that says Clintons can never be prosecuted for perjury, but Madame Secretary is really stress-testing that particular privilege of Clintonhood. One would think the federal judiciary had some interest in establishing that sworn documents must be taken seriously. 2. Obstruction of Justice: Bill Clinton’s primary motive for committing perjury was to obstruct justice—it was the second count in his impeachment. (The justice he was obstructing was a sexual harassment suit from Paula Jones, at a time when liberals insisted sexual harassment was the most overlooked, under-prosecuted crime in the legal code.) Hillary’s thousands of perjury counts are also related to the obstruction of justice. She held back documents she didn’t want Congress to see. She subverted the Freedom of Information Act, which is a law, not a lovely suggestion. Most media timelines of the Clinton email scandal are either incomplete or deliberately obtuse, because they almost never accurately relate how her secret server was discovered. For example, these timelines from USA Today, CNN, and ABC News all get it wrong. Sharyl Attkisson, who was a participant in the story, has an accurate timeline that makes the important point Clinton-friendly media outlets don’t want to talk about: we know about the secret server because the State Department was sued for failing to respond to FOIA requests. The State Department’s official story is that they were surprised to discover Clinton was withholding thousands of documents on her private computer. That’s straight-up obstruction of justice, in cases involving multiple federal courts, as surely as Bill Clinton’s impeachable offense of obstructing the Paula Jones suit. Clinton may become untouchable if the American people allow her into the White House, but the lawsuits don’t evaporate, and neither do the angry judges. 3. Bribery: After the FBI set off a headline earthquake by re-opening the Clinton email investigation, we learned that several other FBI investigations of Clintonworld have been quietly in progress for some time. One of those investigations is digging into bribery allegations against the Clinton Foundation. The FBI agents working on these cases were reportedly very angry that top Bureau and Justice Department officials were pressuring them to drop their investigations. The most attention-grabbing of these suspicions concerns an FBI official, Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, whose wife received an inexplicably huge political donation from Clinton bagman Terry McAuliffe, currently the governor of Virginia. The timing of this donation was so convenient that even the Left side of the blogosphere has produced some uneasy speculation that McCabe probably should have recused himself from all things Clinton-related. Well, he didn’t recuse himself, and the conflicts of interest are so apparent that the lack of a chiseled-in-stone quid pro quo might not be enough to kill this case off. After all, corrupt officials aren’t usually dumb enough to write down their quid pro quo agreements, or repeat them into microphones. The McCabe controversy already has longer legs than most observers expected, when the news first broke. 4. Pay for Play: There has also been recent confirmation that the FBI has investigated influence-peddling allegations against the Clinton Foundation, which was so obviously used for that purpose that it’s funny to watch Clinton apologists insist nothing can be proven in a court of law. Some of the most vigorous infighting within the Bureau reportedly concerns whether pay-for-play investigations should move forward. WikiLeaks has exposed emails from Clinton insiders that openly discuss how the Foundation was part of a network that steered millions of dollars to “Bill Clinton Inc.” Even longtime members of the Clinton syndicate professed themselves troubled by these operations. They were also unhappy with arrangements like Hillary Clinton’s agreement to speak in Morocco after a $12 million donation to the Clinton Global Initiative. It’s entirely possible that more documentation about these suspicious Clinton Foundation dealings will come to light after the election, especially if some of the people Clinton took money from grow upset with her. It’s downright dangerous to have a President with so many strings attached. 5. Illegal Use of a Nonprofit Organization: There are many laws governing the management of charitable organizations, generally intended to prevent them from becoming money-laundering operations, ripoff operations, and vehicles for political influence peddling. The Clinton Foundation and its galaxy of related operations may eventually find itself answering some questions about compliance with those laws, assuming the IRS decides to stop focusing its efforts on hassling mom-and-pop pro-life groups and kitchen-table Tea Party outfits. If the Foundation is ever held to account for any other impropriety, charges of abusing a nonprofit should be part of the legal package as well. 6. Racketeering: Former prosecutor Andrew McCarthy has recently observed that Hillary Clinton’s abuse of the State Department looks an awful lot like a “racketeering enterprise,” which could trigger the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act of 1971, more widely known as RICO. McCarthy explained: Under RICO, an “enterprise” can be any association of people, informal or formal, illegitimate or legitimate – it could be a Mafia family, an ostensibly charitable foundation, or a department of government. It is a racketeering enterprise if its affairs are conducted through “a pattern of racketeering activity.” A “pattern” means merely two or more violations of federal or state law; these violations constitute “racketeering activity” if they are included among the extensive list of felonies laid out in the statute.7. Fraud: Wall Street analyst Charles Ortel has been building a case that the “Clinton Charity Network,” as he calls the complete system of Clinton operations, has committed “charity fraud of epic proportions.” In part, he refers to discrepancies between donor accounts and the Clinton Foundation’s books. Others have pointed out how the Clinton Health Access Initiative has essentially ignored New York state law for years, without a peep from Attorney General Eric Schneiderman (who just happens to be part of the Clinton campaign’s “leadership council.”) There are some interesting differences between the paperwork CHAI submitted to the IRS and what it submitted to the state of New York, which has more specific requirements about identifying foreign donors. In addition to getting a free pass on perjury, the Clintons are traditionally allowed to violate tax laws without penalty, eventually refiling paperwork when “errors” are discovered years after the fact. Another round of whoops-my-bad, no-harm-no-foul “refiling” during a Hillary Clinton presidency would be embarrassing, especially if she’s busy trying to ratchet up taxes on everyone else.

6 | Scottas Sevelis | 0 | 10154741469823675_10154741698063675 | A Short List of Some of Hillary’s Many Crimes - share!Here are a few of Hillary’s crimes. Feel free to share.1. Perjury: Why not start with a blast from the Clinton past? Hillary Clinton signed documents testifying that she turned over all work-related emails to the State Department, on orders from a federal judge, under penalty of perjury. We already have indisputable proof she violated this sworn statement… thousands of times. The cloud of false statements under oath surrounding Hillary Clinton is thousands of times thicker than the one around Bill. Democrats seem to have found a hidden clause in the Constitution that says Clintons can never be prosecuted for perjury, but Madame Secretary is really stress-testing that particular privilege of Clintonhood. One would think the federal judiciary had some interest in establishing that sworn documents must be taken seriously. 2. Obstruction of Justice: Bill Clinton’s primary motive for committing perjury was to obstruct justice—it was the second count in his impeachment. (The justice he was obstructing was a sexual harassment suit from Paula Jones, at a time when liberals insisted sexual harassment was the most overlooked, under-prosecuted crime in the legal code.) Hillary’s thousands of perjury counts are also related to the obstruction of justice. She held back documents she didn’t want Congress to see. She subverted the Freedom of Information Act, which is a law, not a lovely suggestion. Most media timelines of the Clinton email scandal are either incomplete or deliberately obtuse, because they almost never accurately relate how her secret server was discovered. For example, these timelines from USA Today, CNN, and ABC News all get it wrong. Sharyl Attkisson, who was a participant in the story, has an accurate timeline that makes the important point Clinton-friendly media outlets don’t want to talk about: we know about the secret server because the State Department was sued for failing to respond to FOIA requests. The State Department’s official story is that they were surprised to discover Clinton was withholding thousands of documents on her private computer. That’s straight-up obstruction of justice, in cases involving multiple federal courts, as surely as Bill Clinton’s impeachable offense of obstructing the Paula Jones suit. Clinton may become untouchable if the American people allow her into the White House, but the lawsuits don’t evaporate, and neither do the angry judges. 3. Bribery: After the FBI set off a headline earthquake by re-opening the Clinton email investigation, we learned that several other FBI investigations of Clintonworld have been quietly in progress for some time. One of those investigations is digging into bribery allegations against the Clinton Foundation. The FBI agents working on these cases were reportedly very angry that top Bureau and Justice Department officials were pressuring them to drop their investigations. The most attention-grabbing of these suspicions concerns an FBI official, Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, whose wife received an inexplicably huge political donation from Clinton bagman Terry McAuliffe, currently the governor of Virginia. The timing of this donation was so convenient that even the Left side of the blogosphere has produced some uneasy speculation that McCabe probably should have recused himself from all things Clinton-related. Well, he didn’t recuse himself, and the conflicts of interest are so apparent that the lack of a chiseled-in-stone quid pro quo might not be enough to kill this case off. After all, corrupt officials aren’t usually dumb enough to write down their quid pro quo agreements, or repeat them into microphones. The McCabe controversy already has longer legs than most observers expected, when the news first broke. 4. Pay for Play: There has also been recent confirmation that the FBI has investigated influence-peddling allegations against the Clinton Foundation, which was so obviously used for that purpose that it’s funny to watch Clinton apologists insist nothing can be proven in a court of law. Some of the most vigorous infighting within the Bureau reportedly concerns whether pay-for-play investigations should move forward. WikiLeaks has exposed emails from Clinton insiders that openly discuss how the Foundation was part of a network that steered millions of dollars to “Bill Clinton Inc.” Even longtime members of the Clinton syndicate professed themselves troubled by these operations. They were also unhappy with arrangements like Hillary Clinton’s agreement to speak in Morocco after a $12 million donation to the Clinton Global Initiative. It’s entirely possible that more documentation about these suspicious Clinton Foundation dealings will come to light after the election, especially if some of the people Clinton took money from grow upset with her. It’s downright dangerous to have a President with so many strings attached. 5. Illegal Use of a Nonprofit Organization: There are many laws governing the management of charitable organizations, generally intended to prevent them from becoming money-laundering operations, ripoff operations, and vehicles for political influence peddling. The Clinton Foundation and its galaxy of related operations may eventually find itself answering some questions about compliance with those laws, assuming the IRS decides to stop focusing its efforts on hassling mom-and-pop pro-life groups and kitchen-table Tea Party outfits. If the Foundation is ever held to account for any other impropriety, charges of abusing a nonprofit should be part of the legal package as well. 6. Racketeering: Former prosecutor Andrew McCarthy has recently observed that Hillary Clinton’s abuse of the State Department looks an awful lot like a “racketeering enterprise,” which could trigger the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act of 1971, more widely known as RICO. McCarthy explained: Under RICO, an “enterprise” can be any association of people, informal or formal, illegitimate or legitimate – it could be a Mafia family, an ostensibly charitable foundation, or a department of government. It is a racketeering enterprise if its affairs are conducted through “a pattern of racketeering activity.” A “pattern” means merely two or more violations of federal or state law; these violations constitute “racketeering activity” if they are included among the extensive list of felonies laid out in the statute.7. Fraud: Wall Street analyst Charles Ortel has been building a case that the “Clinton Charity Network,” as he calls the complete system of Clinton operations, has committed “charity fraud of epic proportions.” In part, he refers to discrepancies between donor accounts and the Clinton Foundation’s books. Others have pointed out how the Clinton Health Access Initiative has essentially ignored New York state law for years, without a peep from Attorney General Eric Schneiderman (who just happens to be part of the Clinton campaign’s “leadership council.”) There are some interesting differences between the paperwork CHAI submitted to the IRS and what it submitted to the state of New York, which has more specific requirements about identifying foreign donors. In addition to getting a free pass on perjury, the Clintons are traditionally allowed to violate tax laws without penalty, eventually refiling paperwork when “errors” are discovered years after the fact. Another round of whoops-my-bad, no-harm-no-foul “refiling” during a Hillary Clinton presidency would be embarrassing, especially if she’s busy trying to ratchet up taxes on everyone else.

20 | Joe Armstrong | 0 | 10154741469823675_10154741586708675 | Why haven't Black and Hispanic Americans considered moving their allegiance to the Republican Party?  1.  They are correctly demonstrating the the deaths of young men who have died in police custody.  Those are horrendous cases which do need to be investigated and bad actions ended.  But that also has to be the internal responsibility of the police agencies across our country.  Blacks and Hispanics around this country should both develop into political entities that have representatives in both the Democratic and Republican parties to ensure that their goals are achieved.  2.  Planned parenthood also came about as a "Cost Mitigation" methodology to ease the welfare cost of the minority populations trapped in inner cities.  An entire generation of unborn minority babies have been killed under the guise of "A Woman's Right To Chose",  Anyone looking at the massive numbers of abortions among young Black and Hispanic females realizes it is at an even higher percentage then Black male imprisonment.  Killing unborn minority babies is simple "Cost Mitigation".  It is far cheaper to do a simple medical procedure, then it is to pay the medical costs and welfare costs of young women who in most cases live in an environment of poverty, crime, drugs, and misery.3.  Blacks historically have been forced to live in inner city slums and ghettos for decades with no hope for a decent education, job, or an ability to own a home.  Hispanics are now being herded into "Sanctuary Cities" for the exact same reasons.  Even now, these "Sanctuary Cities" have become the Hispanic version of the same living conditions forced upon Blacks as a society. 4.  Simply consider the Republican Political Party this election cycle.  Believe the lives of every American can be better and continue to cry out the travesties that the Democratic Party is reaping on your entire populations.  The babies of Black & Hispanic women should not be slaughtered to justify the expense to mitigate the costs of living a full life as an American.  Your babies are innocent!5.  The Democratic Party wants to "Cost Mitigate" the lives of the unborn of minorities in this country.  They expect minorities to vote for their politicians, while at the same time, do nothing to better the lives of Black or Hispanic Americans with jobs, better education, safe and healthy living conditions, and the opportunity to thrive and live life in the manner every citizen deserves.

Tougher requirements for registering and voting in several states has led to confusion and claims that certain groups are being disenfranchised. Trump has also called for supporters to monitor polling places on Election Day.

4 | Shelly Semrad | 0 | 10154740942248675_10154741595438675 | I really think from what I read that the side effects were bad enough ( I know! Don't yell at me😁) that for someone without a horse in the race- it's a non starter.
5 | Bobbie Malchert | 5 | 10154740942248675_10154741306123675 | The warning side of my pills (just for proof the other photos came from this). The other side is proper use.
6 | Anthony Tanner Bazar | 0 | 10154740942248675_10154741328363675 | I bet the same women calling men whiners sure have alot to say whenever a male tries to tell them something about their bc
7 | Vanessa Whitmore | 0 | 10154740942248675_10154741492463675 | No... I thought the side effects were mass and dangerous... they have to readjust so it is safer for consumer
8 | Janice Gilbert | 1 | 10154740942248675_10154741614013675 | They didn't like the way it makes them feel. Same complaint as  use of condoms.Grow up and get a grip.
9 | Kristi McArthur | 16 | 10154740942248675_10154741082698675 | 
10 | Sandy McColley | 4 | 10154740942248675_10154741166088675 | What a bunch of whiners.
11 | Daniel Orloski | 0 | 10154740942248675_10154741231303675 | Umm it had serious side effects. Identity politics yet again

17 | Marlene Pettine | 0 | 10154740942248675_10154741228103675 | Like women didn't have severe side effects when the pill was new?  I know, as I experienced them.  Men are wimps!
18 | Joe Armstrong | 0 | 10154740942248675_10154741331053675 | Why haven't Black and Hispanic Americans considered moving their allegiance to the Republican Party?  1.  They are correctly demonstrating the the deaths of young men who have died in police custody.  Those are horrendous cases which do need to be investigated and bad actions ended.  But that also has to be the internal responsibility of the police agencies across our country.  Blacks and Hispanics around this country should both develop into political entities that have representatives in both the Democratic and Republican parties to ensure that their goals are achieved.  2.  Planned parenthood also came about as a "Cost Mitigation" methodology to ease the welfare cost of the minority populations trapped in inner cities.  An entire generation of unborn minority babies have been killed under the guise of "A Woman's Right To Chose",  Anyone looking at the massive numbers of abortions among young Black and Hispanic females realizes it is at an even higher percentage then Black male imprisonment.  Killing unborn minority babies is simple "Cost Mitigation".  It is far cheaper to do a simple medical procedure, then it is to pay the medical costs and welfare costs of young women who in most cases live in an environment of poverty, crime, drugs, and misery.3.  Blacks historically have been forced to live in inner city slums and ghettos for decades with no hope for a decent education, job, or an ability to own a home.  Hispanics are now being herded into "Sanctuary Cities" for the exact same reasons.  Even now, these "Sanctuary Cities" have become the Hispanic version of the same living conditions forced upon Blacks as a society. 4.  Simply consider the Republican Political Party this election cycle.  Believe the lives of every American can be better and continue to cry out the travesties that the Democratic Party is reaping on your entire populations.  The babies of Black & Hispanic women should not be slaughtered to justify the expense to mitigate the costs of living a full life as an American.  Your babies are innocent!5.  The Democratic Party wants to "Cost Mitigate" the lives of the unborn of minorities in this country.  They expect minorities to vote for their politicians, while at the same time, do nothing to better the lives of Black or Hispanic Americans with jobs, better education, safe and healthy living conditions, and the opportunity to thrive and live life in the manner every citizen deserves.

Here are some of the key scientific issues that U.S. politicians should be paying attention to, but aren’t. (from Scientific American magazine)
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Bill Thompson | 20 | 10154740893898675_10154740925493675 | So much wasted time on insult and innuendo. Unfortunately the voting populous is more interested in a reality show produced by the news outlets. There are certain things that should not be for-profit healthcare, prisons, defense and most of all the news media!
2 | Jeff Jenicek | 11 | 10154740893898675_10154740909718675 | Why talk about science its simple if you believe in science you vote Dem. If you don't believe in science you vote Republican. See science is fact based two things republicans hate are science and facts.
3 | Nancy Eubert | 0 | 10154740893898675_10154741068343675 | How corrupt our broadcasting cable and network channels have been throughout this whole election. How the President has overstayed his welcome. How anyone, even those with criminal actions and that means if we do it and we're criminals you should be too Hillary. More than 10% of the American population wasn't represented because 3rd candidates are finished before they even start because the strength of the R and D's are stronger than the American public. Worse election ever in the history of the United States of America.
4 | Michael Woods | 0 | 10154740893898675_10154741481213675 | HA!!! It isn't only science and health issues that have taken a back seat in this election... it's most all issues the American public would like to see and hear that have taken a back seat.
5 | Pam Johnson | 0 | 10154740893898675_10154741208733675 | So all the trump voters are uneducated. Pbs your so disgusting. You were for America now you are corruption., lies, Hillary's pay for play. Bill raping women which is ok with you. Used to watch your channel now it's one sides. Totally a shame of you. How much did Obama and Hillary give to your channel for corruption.
6 | Ted Wetherby | 0 | 10154740893898675_10154741496333675 | I though this whole election was about emails, and Bill Clinton. At least that is all I hear about.. They are talking issues like actual policy's ? I do believe I heard Hilary say something about policy's but she was interrupted by Mr Bombastic and its hard to hear over him saying "WRONG" when she talks.....
7 | Bani Adam | 0 | 10154740893898675_10154740939803675 | This election is for me a kind of joke. Mb dream even,  waiting to be awake to see finished the mess. Big topics arenot being discussed deeply enough as if people are to be told that there llnot be a big difference if either of the candidates is in the Whitehose ON THOSE BIG ISSUES.Nukes,  Russia and the way of dealing wz it, poverty,  pollution Iran or Arabs are the future allies.
8 | Teri Taylor | 1 | 10154740893898675_10154741057718675 | Yeah, we had a fraudulent Republican candidate taking up all the oxygen in the room with a clown show.  How many times have we heard Hillary say we need to talk about the "Issues"!
9 | Christy Grace | 0 | 10154740893898675_10154741322013675 | "If I were to run, I'd run as a Republican. They're the dumbest group of voters in the country. They believe anything on Fox News. I could lie and they'd still eat it up. I bet my numbers would be terrific." -Donald J. Trump- People Magazine 1998!!!!!
10 | Tim Beach | 4 | 10154740893898675_10154740934323675 | It's difficult when one party has become the anti science party.
11 | Caspar David | 2 | 10154740893898675_10154741068903675 | Just try something new. We all have enough of these two candidates.
12 | Keith Sargent | 0 | 10154740893898675_10154741466893675 | I hope that there will be some importance to these issues by the new president and Congress, along with security, etc.
13 | Glenna Mayer | 1 | 10154740893898675_10154740932103675 | One can see how these issues were never addressed what with only 600 some days being spent on this BS.
14 | Amy McClintock | 1 | 10154740893898675_10154741231373675 | Maybe if they didn't focus on bogus email "scandals" they could have focused on real issues.

Reno, a former Miami prosecutor who famously told reporters “I don’t do spin,” served nearly eight years as attorney general under President Bill Clinton, the longest stint in a century.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Virginia Marks Mahoney | 153 | 10154740662538675_10154740784593675 | "Speak out against the hatred, the bigotry and the violence in this land. Most haters are cowards. When confronted, they back down. When we remain silent, they flourish,"....Janet Reno. RIP
2 | Bones Lorraine | 95 | 10154740662538675_10154740734243675 | Note to the right wing loons: David Koresh was responsible for the deaths at Waco including the rapes of the young girls/children that he had brainwashed along with their families. Now go bugger off somewhere else.
3 | Rebecca Kendrick | 52 | 10154740662538675_10154740800733675 | Love her or hate her, she opened the door for women in Washington. Personally, I respected her. Our country was going through a lot of crap during her tenure. She handled it proving women could be as tough as men.
4 | Bernadette Mathews | 56 | 10154740662538675_10154740776768675 | I'm sorry she didn't live to see Hillary become President
5 | Larry Schodts | 47 | 10154740662538675_10154740823578675 | During my years in DC I met Janet Reno, a few times at functions. As attorney General she wasn't a political operative and didn't seek the cameras or media. She may have been thrust into the spotlight because of her position and career path but she was incredibly intelligent, demure and kind. She was a Dupont Circle farmers market regular, always wore a wide brimmed straw hat and sunglasses. She was a museum affecianado. A couple of times I spotted her at one of the Phillips Collection exhibits or one of the Smithsonian's and while we didn't speak we always shared a smile and kind nod. I'm sorry to hear she passed. She was an intelligent soul. We've lost a great intellect.
6 | Catriona Comb | 46 | 10154740662538675_10154740755788675 | Like I said on another post - she was a tough lady in a tough job. Thank you for your service to our country Ms. Reno. xx
7 | David Martin | 27 | 10154740662538675_10154740824313675 | It's sad that Janet Reno passed away today, just one day before witnessing the election of the first female president of the United States of America!  Rest in Peace, Janet Reno!
8 | Ramona Kenyon | 30 | 10154740662538675_10154740792193675 | She was one of the Nasty Women... Much respect, there has to be first.Rest in peace knowing you paved the way for others
9 | Jon Osborne | 1 | 10154740662538675_10154741200823675 | Actually, it was PBS that first informed me what a devil she was. The PBS Frontline documentary told how she pretty much judicially tortured a bunch of child care workers -- including a 14-year-old baby sitter -- to make a name for herself as a crusader for children. I never forgot that. http://missliberty.com/the-child-terror-1998/
10 | Mark East | 2 | 10154740662538675_10154741048288675 | A complete disgrace to the Constitution, America and our way of life. Burned women and children alive. Kidnapped a boy using the FBI at gunpoint. No one deserves less respect.
11 | Carl McKay | 1 | 10154740662538675_10154741204413675 | In REAL news, Janet Reno dies today. A reminder of the last time the Clintons were in office and appointed an Attorney General who ordered a Massacre by Federal Law Enforcement Officers on American Soil in Waco.
12 | Doug Sawyer | 7 | 10154740662538675_10154740944663675 | Reno made history, the 1st woman AG because that's what democrats do, we are known for doing 1st in the nation and we are set to make history again tomorrow with another 1st.
13 | Beverly Buys | 11 | 10154740662538675_10154740882678675 | Oh Janet, you almost made it long enough to see our first female president. I am sorry you didn't. You were a trailblazer.

15 | Jennifer Johnson | 6 | 10154740662538675_10154740686883675 | She had 24 children murdered under the Clintons in Waco.

From taxes to the Trans-Pacific Partnership and college costs, Clinton has laid out an extensive list of pledges.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Craig Giodsir | 14 | 10154738569718675_10154739916163675 | Unlike Trump, Clinton's policies make the allowance that day one of the Presidency starts with that horrific national debt still there. Trump's policies need to start with a balanced budget on day one and Monopoly money to pay for everything.
2 | William H Boley | 7 | 10154738569718675_10154740467973675 | At least we know specifically what she says she will do. In contrast to a few specifics and many generalities. Do we really even know what we'd be getting with him?
3 | Alison Flint | 8 | 10154738569718675_10154740158368675 | Oh yay! More pledges during a campaign.  Amazing to watch her public platform evolve over the course of the campaign to vacuum up Sander's platform. The problem here is that her public platform never happens, nor was it ever meant to happen. What nods she actually ever gives to any of it will be so watered down and full of holes and wrapped in pages upon pages of legalese that the end result will benefit the same Gods as always but she'll announce she made it happen. The folks paying for their politicians didn't gain control by being stupid, they aren't financing her out of charity. Follow the money and you'll see who will benefit from anything she does - and it ain't 99.9% of us. But yep, she'll say anything for votes.
4 | James Culver | 11 | 10154738569718675_10154739905793675 | Yeah....I'd be surprised if she followed through with 10 percent of the Sanders...errr...I mean...her platform.
5 | Richard Gougeon | 2 | 10154738569718675_10154740982068675 | According to a new poll conducted last week, 67 percent of likely voters don’t think Hillary Clinton is “honest and trustworthy.”
6 | Kristy Webb Lalonde | 0 | 10154738569718675_10154741232568675 | Keep this in mind before you vote tomorrow if you haven't already. NONE of these thousands of emails being released by WikiLeaks or the Veritas Videos have been contested or denied by any party relating to them, at all. Not one... In FACT, many people have been fired and or resigned. GUILTY, GUILTY, GUILTY...Vote Trump/Pence 2016!!! 🇺🇸
7 | Jennifer Vicent | 6 | 10154738569718675_10154739951853675 | Dear humans of the United States of America:   You must be very exhausted after this long elections. It's time for you to make the right decision and vote.  Overall, love everyone as you love yourself.
8 | Liz Homer | 8 | 10154738569718675_10154739913868675 | My, my how the media likes planning how they will hold Hillary's feet to the fire. On the other hand Trump lies soMuch nobody really knows what he will do.
9 | Jeffrey Knee | 2 | 10154738569718675_10154740283233675 | LeBron James has forgotten his roots. His mom wisely gave him up to be raised in a stable family and he attended a Catholic high school, where his sporting talents took off. Today he supports Hillary, who opposes school choice for kids in failing school districts. If his mom had kept him in the inner city public schools and lived on welfare, we wouldn't know who LeBron James is today. He'd probably be just a number someplace, if still alive. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James
10 | Debby Zamorski | 5 | 10154738569718675_10154739917108675 | No, those are our platform. She is a legally ineligible and factually invalid candidate. Don't play like we make a difference, because if we did, she would not be the nominee. I no more buy into the fiction of Sanders being in a position of power (other than we the people paying attention) than I believe in any carrot stick crap that the two private club plutocrat tool parties float to try and legitimize dishonesty and ignorance .

It is hard to tell how he can come on TV at CNN every night disgracing D. J. Trump when he himself committed such a disposable act! What was he showing the States teens for an example as their peer, Donald is stepping in as a Steward to the young of America. Not as this example as we see in this article:Evidence reason Bakari Sellers' DUI charge droppedLaDonna BeekerApr 8, 2013 05:16 PMCHESTER COUNTY, SC (WIS) - Evidence in a state representative's driving under the influence case allowed him to plea to a lesser charge.    State Rep. Bakari Sellers was charged with DUI on Oct. 7 when he was traveling north on Interstate 77 just after 1 a.m. from a South Carolina football game, where he admitted to deputies he was drinking alcohol. Sellers refused a breath test, resulting in an automatic six-month driver's license suspension. His license was reinstated in February by a judicial panel.However, Sellers will not see any more consequences from the DUI charge because video surveillance from the deputy's patrol car did not match the date on Sellers' ticket. Because the evidence did not flow, it could not hold up in court.Sellers was allowed to plead guilty to reckless driving and pay a $475 fine. Court documents show he signed an affidavit April 1 acknowledging his guilt to the lesser charge."I am very pleased to have been cleared of all alcohol-related charges from my traffic stop in Chester County last fall," Sellers said in a statement released Friday.He takes "full responsibility" for his actions and admitted he was too tired to drive."I apologize and will do my best to set a better example for our youth and to continue to move South Carolina forward," Sellers said." I don't think he should explain properness when he is so drunk with words against a person that stands for America! As unbelievably, there is shocking videos on the net of his DUI arrest! TRUMP 2016

During the last two decades, Iowa has largely voted for Democratic presidential candidates.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Crystal Keller | 52 | 10154739342308675_10154739640253675 | He'll take Iowa cuz there's a lot of country folk. They keep voting for Steve King which is ranked last in the congress for getting anything done. Trump can have Iowa cuz Hillary will still get her numbers by winning Florida. And will probably get a majority in the senate. Problem solved. After Tuesday hope to never see or hear of Trump again. He promised.
2 | Dean Roger Miller | 27 | 10154739342308675_10154739626528675 | Yes! Iowa is home to Ernst King and Grassley. Iowa has trump demographics written all over it. Iowa is one of the least diverse states and should not be the first place to hold caucuses
3 | Kristen Meyer | 13 | 10154739342308675_10154739823648675 | After spending the weekend driving through a sea of Trump signs in rural Missouri, I'd guess The same is true of rural Iowa.  I'm hoping the cities of Missouri & Iowa are inhabited by unprejudiced citizens able to read and think intelligently therefore supporting Clinton.  I'm pretty sure the rural Midwest only receives one television channel......Fox News.
4 | Bonnie Walker | 16 | 10154739342308675_10154739670593675 | Poor Iowa !  So sorry. Buck up and vote blue on November 8th. You can do it. You are the leader the Iowa test of basic skills. We all had to take it. You used to be the leader.
5 | Deb White | 18 | 10154739342308675_10154739662778675 | Trump was spoon fed with a platinum spoon. Not only did his Daddy hand him over millions he bailed out his businesses that were collapsing. His business record is tainted and shady. He boasts about manipulating the tax codes and yet takes every advantage of roads bridges airports which he pays nothing for upkeep. He claims he donates to charity and yet no charities will confirm his generous checks have ever arrived. He is a fraud and a bloated con man.
6 | Lisa Prichard | 4 | 10154739342308675_10154740187443675 | I think it may have something to do with the Governor's son being the State campaign person for Trump. Koch Brothers have bought Iowa....Joni Ernest is their creation and they are moving in on the state legislature.
7 | Roger Cruser | 5 | 10154739342308675_10154740051868675 | I give Iowa more credit than many. They are thoughtful and considerate people. They are polar opposites of Donald Trump and I believe they will move in favor of Hillary. She is the only valid choice.
8 | Derrick Obeng Benson | 5 | 10154739342308675_10154739607858675 | For all you people that are against Trump, look at his background. The man came from nothing and became a billionaire. And now he is coming with no political experience and he will be the greatest president ever.Trump is the only one who can break the cycle of political cronyism in Washington - BECAUSE he's an outsider! #Trump2016
9 | George Campbell | 2 | 10154739342308675_10154740535343675 | Trump demonstrated explicitly that conservatism and racism are bound together. There is no concept of American Conservatism that does not have a racist component as a support pillar. W.F. Buckley attempted to decouple the two, but his brand of intellectualism has been rejected by the GOP.

11 | Ariel Cruz | 19 | 10154739342308675_10154739638968675 | I voted for Bernie Sanders against Hillary Clinton in the ny primary and I agree with Jill Stein on pretty much everything but we can't allow trump to step one foot into The White House as of today Jill Stein is polling at 2% if you supported Bernie Sanders and everything that he stands for and accomplished we should follow his advice and vote for Hillary Clinton in this election.
12 | Mera Molano Andrea Esthefania | 15 | 10154739342308675_10154739673058675 | T卐ump is not going to be President. The majority of Americans are to morally decent and too intelligent for that to happen. What is disturbing is that we live in a country where even one single person, never mind millions, believe a brainless, racist, egomaniacal sexual predator with the temperament of a middle school bully deserves your precious vote. We're at a point where if you vote for Trump you either endorse what he represents (I almost said "stands for" but he stands for NOTHING other than his insatiable narcissism) or you are ignorant of it. Which is it? I really want a Trump voter to tell me.
13 | Robert Dunning | 3 | 10154739342308675_10154739611328675 | Easily. Des Moines register poll out yesterday has trump up by 7 in Iowa.

15 | Margaret McGinn Ragona | 2 | 10154739342308675_10154739612383675 | Iowa hasn't qualified as battle ground in quite awhile.

21 | Karen Pisano-Gustavson | 1 | 10154739342308675_10154740296548675 | Iowa is only 6 electoral votes. It's only somehow a weird symbolic thing to win it. And I mean weird as in pretty much only this race.

How are voters in Ohio feeling in the final days of the election?
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Scotty Jones Cherryholmes | 50 | 10154739338768675_10154739609913675 | I'm really shocked anyone is voting for Trump. I mean anyone with an education. You know, the ones ignorant people call the "elites."
2 | Wendy Mellon | 26 | 10154739338768675_10154739843643675 | I honestly have no respect for the intelligence and judgment of anyone who votes for Trump and I never will. You may hate Hillary, but don't sacrifice our country to someone incapable of running it because of that hate. I will never respect your intelligence, your brain or your service to our country if you vote Trump. You harm our country, our poor, our middle class, our daughters, mothers, sisters and grandmothers, our immigrants, our economy. I will never have respect for you no matter how you serve. Inexcusable. Period.
3 | David Motley | 5 | 10154739338768675_10154739676948675 | As far as the electoral map goes I do think Trump has a really good chance at winning Ohio (the polls are apparently really close), as well as Iowa and Arizona, but he still has quite the uphill climb for winning the election. Still curious to see if Utah goes for the independent McMullin who pulls remarkably close to Trump there. It's possible the way the polls are that Florida will be the deciding race in figuring out who's going to win this thing.
4 | Cala Rogers Seifer | 1 | 10154739338768675_10154739695493675 | I live in Stark county in ohio and Trump seems to be pretty popular around here. Yard signs and trump signs everywhere. One of the biggest industries here is steel mills and with massive layoffs people are pissed and looking for a non-politician i suppose. And there are a ton of ads about hillary coming for guns or being against the second amendment. And the mailers, whew... I read the race between Strickland and Portman for senate is one of the biggest campaign spending for a senate race. Its crazyIts not looking good.

I got more training militarily than a lot of the guys that go into the military.”-- “I always wanted to get the Purple Heart. This was much easier." -“Senator McCain is not a war hero.”- “The US Generals are rubble.” - “I know more about ISIS than the Generals do.” - “Obama is the founder of ISIS” - “I would bring back a hell of a lot worse than Waterboarding.”  – “I love War.” - “Why can’t we use Nukes?”
6 | Mark W. Ingram | 0 | 10154739338768675_10154739671558675 | I would think that the good people of Ohio would feel a lot like the rest oe the country.  Like we are being assulted by a political contest that has gone insane.  No matter who wins, tribal warfare will be rampant. The goverment will be disfunctional and the downward spiral of our country will speed up.
7 | Linda Matchick | 0 | 10154739338768675_10154741632028675 | We're feeling great, even though we are surrounded by the "amazing people haters" we know Hillary will win. Just because Ohio people are low on the brain level there are others in the country that actually think.
8 | Gerry Schultz | 11 | 10154739338768675_10154739609153675 | Trump will probably win among white guys. After that, it's all her.
9 | Mindy Wirick | 0 | 10154739338768675_10154741155473675 | From Tina:I put this post on my personal page today. It was hard cause so many people on my friends list are trump supporters/Hillary haters. I like to avoid that drama! I just felt there was some things I had to say. I've tried my best to keep my opinions about the election off my fb page. Mostly cause most of my friends list is predominately trump supporters and I try to keep that drama out of my life. But as this election draws close I think it's time I put some of my thoughts out there. If you start reading this please read til the end you may be surprised where I'm going. On Tuesday when I go cast my vote for Clinton/Kaine I will walk out of there knowing for me I did the right thing. Does that mean I think she's the absolutely best candidate there is? Maybe she isn't but out of the 2 I know in my mind and heart she's the one for me. Some people say that either one of these 2 will bring down America. I strongly disagree with that. No matter what happens I know America will be ok. This election has brought out a lot of hate and ignorance on both sides. And it breaks my heart this is what we have come to. But I cannot in my own conscience vote for a man that I feel is an egotistical self righteous bully. I honestly could go on and on about why I dislike him so much but I won't cause that goes against the spirit of this post. Does trump scare me? No he doesn't but the fact that his thinking can blind so many people does. To me the things that he's said far outweigh any email scandal. Do I think Hillary was negligent in her handling of her emails. Sure she was but does that make her a criminal? Of course it doesn't. Do I think that Benghazi was a horrible tragedy that could have been handled better? Yes of course I do. But to point a finger at one person and call her a murderer is crazy. That was a joint effort of several people dropping the ball that led to these people's deaths. Why does no one bring up the fact that the republican led congress voted to cut funding for security over there? Those 4 people dying was a tragedy that should have been avoided. But to blame one person is ridiculous. One thing I know for sure is those people went to work knowing everyday that it was dangerous and they did it anyway. That to me means those people died American heroes and I can think of a lot worse ways to die. On Wednesday no matter who wins I will still wake up and go to work and live my life. It will be harder cause if trump wins and repeals Obamacare (as he has promised) that means my 19 year old daughter will be without health insurance (that includes medical dental and vision) because my right to carry her on my health insurance will be taken away. Yes that terrifies me but I will figure it out as I always do. My life will go on as will all of yours no matter what happens. What really bothers me as an aftermath of this election is all the hate and judgment that has came out of people. I know good people that support trump. Do I like their thinking on trump? No I don't but that doesn't mean I don't like them. The things I've seen on here have truly hurt my heart. People constantly sharing memes that depict me as being stupid or a baby killer or so on and so on. People know what they share. I keep my mouth shut but it hurts. People attacking obamas wife and kids or hillarys daughter or trumps wife and kids. Bothers me the most cause I think they should be off limits. People not truly understanding what late term abortion really means and calling those women murderers and saying they rip those babies out of their bodies like animals hurts me. Imagine being put in a situation where you want your baby sometimes fought to even get pregnant. Then that baby starts basically poisoning your body and the doctors are telling you that the baby cannot survive on their own and if they don't get that baby out of you now then you will both die. Late term abortions rarely happen mostly cause with wonderful medical technology they can deliver those babies. But sadly that's not always the case. I read some of these women's stories and cried with them over the agonizing decisions they were faced with. You can only trust your doctors and what they are telling you. These women are beating themselves up cause they feel like their bodies failed their babies. Some of these women would have gladly died if there was even a tiny chance their babies could be delivered and lived. But they had to think of their other children at home or their spouse or their parents. Then to have Donald trump refer to them as ripping their babies out of them. I can only imagine what a slap in the face that would be. People judging others based on their race or choice of religion hurts my heart. I've also had people even family members that I love get on here and call me stupid or blind or my head in the sand cause of my opinions. Let me tell you it hurts. Then we have the news stories that strangers comment on. Attacking each other calling names, bullying, threatening to kill each other, attacking their family members, saying that they want either one of the candidates to die. I just can't understand why people do that. So I know a lot of you people are praying that your candidate wins or even praying on which candidate to vote for. But I tell you what I'm gonna start praying on. I'm gonna start asking God for guidance on how I can become better and try and bring forth positivity. And even if I can help influence one person to be kinder then I'll be ok with that. And please respect that these are my thoughts and opinions on my page and they are not up for debate or attacking me. Have a great day everyone and may god bless all of you!
10 | Brian Norberg | 0 | 10154739338768675_10154741470138675 | Hillary Clinton and the DNC have set us up for a decade of lame Republican rule.  Because of her hubris HRC has forced her way into the nomination this year and if she wins she will remain unpopular on the right and the left.  In the 2018 midterms Democrats are faced with an raft full of Senate races they have to defend.  Meaning they will most likely lose the Senate.  And the in 2020(assuming HRC wins tomorrow) Hillary Clinton will try and get a second term. Which if this election is any indication she will lose.  Not only will she lose but she will lose but I would bet she will lose to someone like Paul Ryan.  Which will give the Republicans the House, the Senate and the Whitehouse.  And this will happen right after the next census insuring massive gerrymandering by the Republicans.  So to those of us on the left.  If you want any chance of significant change you had better get it out of Hillary in the next two years.  Because after that you are SOL.

Hillary Clinton aimed to hit high notes Sunday in the final moments of her campaign as Donald Trump vowed he and his supporters would never quit.

1 | Michele A Wilcox | 65 | 10154738337883675_10154739424108675 | Now here's the deal...I don't care whether or not any classified emails were on Hillary's private server email account 6 or more years ago since (a) her server was NEVER hacked, (b) there was absolutely NO resulting fallout detrimental to US interests. Let me repeat: I DON'T CARE!What I DO CARE about is...Trey Gowdy falsifying documents with the purpose to frame Hillary and impugn her honor as Secretary of State. He later admitted altering documents to the Select Committee, who found Hillary innocent.Jason Chaffetz outed a CIA op putting American lives in danger.The current REPUBLICAN nominee is being investigated by the FBI for his and his campaign's ties to a hostile foreign gov't.Americans still do not have Trump's tax returns and no clear plan has been announced for what happens with Trump empire should he win to avoid conflicts of interest given his deep indebtedness to Russia, China and Saudi Arabia.Ohio lost absentee ballots, Indiana may disallow 45,000 voters registered in predominantly black neighborhoods.Multiple arrests have been made in the last few days for voter fraud and election rigging by TRUMP SUPPORTERS.Once esteemed 4th Estate, upon which most Americans rely to report FACTS has turned into a freakin' 24/7 reality show filled with guest appearances by every loser with an unsubstantiated and factless "opinion".Civil suit against Trump for child rape has survived his million dollar lawyers' attempts to dismiss it. And, was only cancelled because of death threats against the plaintiff.A civil suit for FRAUD (Trump U) against Trump with substantial evidence supporting it.Republicans have threatened...yes, THREATENED - Americans with FOUR MORE YEARS of political gamesmanship and obstruction if they don't get their way.

3 | Robyn Rogers | 1 | 10154738337883675_10154740336713675 | When Trump stands there and says "what have you got to lose" the answer is everything unfortunately but some people still don't actually work out the fact from the fiction and think he's some kind of superhero not the business, moral and person failure he so obviously is.
4 | Nancy M Bell | 21 | 10154738337883675_10154739474888675 | It's over for me.  Voted early.  Champagne on ice and ready to go to DC in January.My family, my friends areALL WITH HER
5 | Ramon Cordero | 11 | 10154738337883675_10154739579308675 | So much for the so called emails scandal. Republicans were trying to find anything to see what sticks. Get over it. You got nothing on her now. She is a good person and will be your next president. Trump is a hateful, racist, arrogant, person and will never be our president. Americans want someone that represent our values. Trump does not live up to those values.
6 | Michele A Wilcox | 2 | 10154738337883675_10154740414798675 | I find it interesting that the Republicans have investigated Hillary for 25 years and wasted millions of dollars only to find absolutely nothing. Face it, she hasn't committed any crimes. Republicans are afraid of her and know she has the ability to get things done. She has a proven track record of great accomplishments whereas Trump has a trail of failed enterprises.
7 | Mindy Wirick | 0 | 10154738337883675_10154740861268675 | From Tina:I put this post on my personal page today. It was hard cause so many people on my friends list are trump supporters/Hillary haters. I like to avoid that drama! I just felt there was some things I had to say. I've tried my best to keep my opinions about the election off my fb page. Mostly cause most of my friends list is predominately trump supporters and I try to keep that drama out of my life. But as this election draws close I think it's time I put some of my thoughts out there. If you start reading this please read til the end you may be surprised where I'm going. On Tuesday when I go cast my vote for Clinton/Kaine I will walk out of there knowing for me I did the right thing. Does that mean I think she's the absolutely best candidate there is? Maybe she isn't but out of the 2 I know in my mind and heart she's the one for me. Some people say that either one of these 2 will bring down America. I strongly disagree with that. No matter what happens I know America will be ok. This election has brought out a lot of hate and ignorance on both sides. And it breaks my heart this is what we have come to. But I cannot in my own conscience vote for a man that I feel is an egotistical self righteous bully. I honestly could go on and on about why I dislike him so much but I won't cause that goes against the spirit of this post. Does trump scare me? No he doesn't but the fact that his thinking can blind so many people does. To me the things that he's said far outweigh any email scandal. Do I think Hillary was negligent in her handling of her emails. Sure she was but does that make her a criminal? Of course it doesn't. Do I think that Benghazi was a horrible tragedy that could have been handled better? Yes of course I do. But to point a finger at one person and call her a murderer is crazy. That was a joint effort of several people dropping the ball that led to these people's deaths. Why does no one bring up the fact that the republican led congress voted to cut funding for security over there? Those 4 people dying was a tragedy that should have been avoided. But to blame one person is ridiculous. One thing I know for sure is those people went to work knowing everyday that it was dangerous and they did it anyway. That to me means those people died American heroes and I can think of a lot worse ways to die. On Wednesday no matter who wins I will still wake up and go to work and live my life. It will be harder cause if trump wins and repeals Obamacare (as he has promised) that means my 19 year old daughter will be without health insurance (that includes medical dental and vision) because my right to carry her on my health insurance will be taken away. Yes that terrifies me but I will figure it out as I always do. My life will go on as will all of yours no matter what happens. What really bothers me as an aftermath of this election is all the hate and judgment that has came out of people. I know good people that support trump. Do I like their thinking on trump? No I don't but that doesn't mean I don't like them. The things I've seen on here have truly hurt my heart. People constantly sharing memes that depict me as being stupid or a baby killer or so on and so on. People know what they share. I keep my mouth shut but it hurts. People attacking obamas wife and kids or hillarys daughter or trumps wife and kids. Bothers me the most cause I think they should be off limits. People not truly understanding what late term abortion really means and calling those women murderers and saying they rip those babies out of their bodies like animals hurts me. Imagine being put in a situation where you want your baby sometimes fought to even get pregnant. Then that baby starts basically poisoning your body and the doctors are telling you that the baby cannot survive on their own and if they don't get that baby out of you now then you will both die. Late term abortions rarely happen mostly cause with wonderful medical technology they can deliver those babies. But sadly that's not always the case. I read some of these women's stories and cried with them over the agonizing decisions they were faced with. You can only trust your doctors and what they are telling you. These women are beating themselves up cause they feel like their bodies failed their babies. Some of these women would have gladly died if there was even a tiny chance their babies could be delivered and lived. But they had to think of their other children at home or their spouse or their parents. Then to have Donald trump refer to them as ripping their babies out of them. I can only imagine what a slap in the face that would be. People judging others based on their race or choice of religion hurts my heart. I've also had people even family members that I love get on here and call me stupid or blind or my head in the sand cause of my opinions. Let me tell you it hurts. Then we have the news stories that strangers comment on. Attacking each other calling names, bullying, threatening to kill each other, attacking their family members, saying that they want either one of the candidates to die. I just can't understand why people do that. So I know a lot of you people are praying that your candidate wins or even praying on which candidate to vote for. But I tell you what I'm gonna start praying on. I'm gonna start asking God for guidance on how I can become better and try and bring forth positivity. And even if I can help influence one person to be kinder then I'll be ok with that. And please respect that these are my thoughts and opinions on my page and they are not up for debate or attacking me. Have a great day everyone and may god bless all of you!

Trump promotes division, stand for unity. Trump supports despair, stand for hope. You will not be standing alone......we are millions...
9 | Bruce Terry | 9 | 10154738337883675_10154739424393675 | The Trump campaign has mobilized a lot of people with unfounded prejudices via a divisive campaign that has also divided the Republican Party, but hopefully after November 8 the US will be "great again" (united and strong and confident). http://www.economist.com/news/business/21708718-some-americans-are-getting-rich-pushing-politics-extremes-business-outrage?fsrc=scn/fb/te/pe/ed/thebusinessofoutrage

Vermont, Wyoming, Oregon, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Iowa, Delaware, and Alabama, write in Bernie too. Everybody else, your job is to vote third party so we can be rid of Trump/Clinton and kick this thing to the US House. The goal, keep Trump and Clinton out of the top three. Oh and big thanks to Utah for leading the way and going third party, neither Clinton nor Trump will reach 270. Lets try to keep them out of the top three America!

The majority of Americans are to morally decent and too intelligent for that to happen. What is disturbing is that we live in a country where even one single person, never mind millions, believe a brainless, racist, egomaniacal sexual predator with the temperament of a middle school bully deserves your precious vote. We're at a point where if you vote for Trump you either endorse what he represents (I almost said "stands for" but he stands for NOTHING other than his insatiable narcissism) or you are ignorant of it. Which is it? I really want a Trump voter to tell me.

Not as this example as we see in this article:Evidence reason Bakari Sellers' DUI charge droppedLaDonna BeekerApr 8, 2013 05:16 PMCHESTER COUNTY, SC (WIS) - Evidence in a state representative's driving under the influence case allowed him to plea to a lesser charge.    State Rep. Bakari Sellers was charged with DUI on Oct. 7 when he was traveling north on Interstate 77 just after 1 a.m. from a South Carolina football game, where he admitted to deputies he was drinking alcohol. Sellers refused a breath test, resulting in an automatic six-month driver's license suspension. His license was reinstated in February by a judicial panel.However, Sellers will not see any more consequences from the DUI charge because video surveillance from the deputy's patrol car did not match the date on Sellers' ticket. Because the evidence did not flow, it could not hold up in court.Sellers was allowed to plead guilty to reckless driving and pay a $475 fine. Court documents show he signed an affidavit April 1 acknowledging his guilt to the lesser charge."I am very pleased to have been cleared of all alcohol-related charges from my traffic stop in Chester County last fall," Sellers said in a statement released Friday.He takes "full responsibility" for his actions and admitted he was too tired to drive."I apologize and will do my best to set a better example for our youth and to continue to move South Carolina forward," Sellers said." I don't think he should explain properness when he is so drunk with words against a person that stands for America! As unbelievably, there is shocking videos on the net of his DUI arrest! TRUMP 2016

Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr. George W. Bush and Al Gore. Sometimes, Election Day ends without a clear winner.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Scotty Jones Cherryholmes | 8 | 10154739029478675_10154739314433675 | The Democrats were robbed in 2000. In the chaotic first days after the 2000 election, Al Gore and George W. Bush selected Christopher and James A. Baker III as their respective representatives in Florida. Both were former Secretaries of State. It soon became apparent that that was about all they had in common.Christopher believed in negotiation; he didn’t necessarily trust that he and Baker could simply decide the winner of the race between them, but he did think that they could at least settle the ground rules and procedures. Facing Baker in a conference room at the tiny Governors Inn, in Tallahassee, Christopher thought he could reach at least some kind of meeting of the minds.Baker didn’t. Baker recognized that the race for the Presidency was the ultimate zero-sum game, and he decided not to yield on a single question. Under Christopher, the Gore forces both preached and practiced restraint. Under Baker, the Bush team fought all-out on every front—through the media, in the courthouses, and in the streets. The difference between the two sides, and between the two men, was immediately apparent and central to the final result.By the end of the thirty-six day contest, the Gore side had stepped up its efforts, which were, by that point, led by David Boies and Ron Klain (a Christopher protégé). Chris had long since returned to Los Angeles. He was then, and is now, an honorable representative of an era very different from our own.

10 | Susan Anthony | 0 | 10154739029478675_10154739301933675 | By changing state laws, without changing anything in the Constitution, the National Popular Vote bill is 61% of the way to guaranteeing the majority of Electoral College votes, and thus the presidency, to the candidate who receives the most popular votes in the country, by replacing state winner-take-all laws for awarding electoral votes in the enacting states.	Every vote, everywhere, would be politically relevant and equal in presidential elections. No more distorting and divisive red and blue state maps of predictable outcomes. There would no longer be a handful of 'battleground' states where voters and policies are more important than those of the voters in 38+ states that now are just 'spectators' and ignored after the conventions.The National Popular Vote bill would take effect when enacted by states possessing a majority of the electoral votes—270 of 538.  All of the presidential electors from the enacting states will be supporters of the presidential candidate receiving the most popular votes in all 50 states (and DC)—thereby guaranteeing that candidate with an Electoral College majority.The bill was approved this year by a unanimous bipartisan House committee vote in both Georgia (16 electoral votes) and Missouri (10).The bill has passed 34 state legislative chambers in 23 rural, small, medium, large, Democratic, Republican and purple states with 261 electoral votes, including one house in Arizona (11), Arkansas (6), Maine (4), Michigan (16), Nevada (6), New Mexico (5), North Carolina (15), and Oklahoma (7), and both houses in Colorado (9). The bill has been enacted by 11 small, medium, and large jurisdictions with 165 electoral votes – 61% of the way to guaranteeing the presidency to the candidate with the most national popular votes.NationalPopularVote

Here's what you can look out for on election night.

1 | Cindy Bowen | 8 | 10154738532653675_10154739526453675 | This election is uncharted territory. There is no trend, no predictable key results. Anything could happen. Anything. Whatever does happen I just want the hate to dissipate. We are all in this together. We are still stewards and neighbors of this great nation. Let's stop turning on 'eachother'. Kindness is easy. Kindness trumps hate. Let's remember that and set an example to our children.
2 | John Petrow | 7 | 10154738532653675_10154739244338675 | With trust in our federal government at record lows with less than 18% of the population trusting the Federal government to do the right thing, it's time to make a change.
3 | James F. Brooks | 5 | 10154738532653675_10154739316153675 | A rigged election where the people's vote does not count also known as the popular vote and only the electoral vote counts, it has been the same for over 200 years. The American people never elect their president or vice president. What's absolutely amazing is that we are in an age of technology and information and people refuse to look it up
4 | Hedy Bethany | 4 | 10154738532653675_10154739334073675 | She broke the law period! A criminal politician! If you have to cheat to win then you're a loser to all, even if you win. Still looking at yourself in the mirror knowing you're a loser anyway. That's corrupt Hilarious Hiliary Clinton's Legacy. The history 📚 books will record it for sure.
5 | Bryan Evans | 2 | 10154738532653675_10154739487413675 | She'll go down, and it will look like it's  for the count. Trump will turn his back and tear his shirt off. When it looks like it's over for Hillary, President Obama will slide one of those mysterious folding metal chairs that can somehow materialize by ring side at wrestling matches into the ring. She'll jump up and smash Trump in the back of the head while he goats, then we'll have our next president.

8 | Edwards Greg | 10 | 10154738532653675_10154739247988675 | Well, at least we know Repubs won't need to eat on election night; Clinton and the Dems are serving them up a whole plateful of smackdown.
9 | Hal Long | 0 | 10154738532653675_10154740381553675 | Interesting that once again, Alaska and Hawaii are not included. When our polls are closing, the president has already been elected.

It is hard to tell how he can come on TV at CNN every night disgracing D. J. Trump when he himself committed such a disposable act! What was he showing the States teens for an example as their peer, Donald is stepping in as a Steward to the young of America. Not as this example as we see in this article:Evidence reason Bakari Sellers' DUI charge droppedLaDonna BeekerApr 8, 2013 05:16 PMCHESTER COUNTY, SC (WIS) - Evidence in a state representative's driving under the influence case allowed him to plea to a lesser charge.    State Rep. Bakari Sellers was charged with DUI on Oct. 7 when he was traveling north on Interstate 77 just after 1 a.m. from a South Carolina football game, where he admitted to deputies he was drinking alcohol. Sellers refused a breath test, resulting in an automatic six-month driver's license suspension. His license was reinstated in February by a judicial panel.However, Sellers will not see any more consequences from the DUI charge because video surveillance from the deputy's patrol car did not match the date on Sellers' ticket. Because the evidence did not flow, it could not hold up in court.Sellers was allowed to plead guilty to reckless driving and pay a $475 fine. Court documents show he signed an affidavit April 1 acknowledging his guilt to the lesser charge."I am very pleased to have been cleared of all alcohol-related charges from my traffic stop in Chester County last fall," Sellers said in a statement released Friday.He takes "full responsibility" for his actions and admitted he was too tired to drive."I apologize and will do my best to set a better example for our youth and to continue to move South Carolina forward," Sellers said." I don't think he should explain properness when he is so drunk with words against a person that stands for America! As unbelievably, there is shocking videos on the net of his DUI arrest! TRUMP 2016
17 | Mur Bally | 1 | 10154738532653675_10154739838683675 | D. J. Trump could walk out and say "o no..... " (like a mouse) and that roaring MOB would go into an uncontrollable FRENZY!!!!!, that's AMERICA!!!!!

The National Popular Vote Interstate Compact would automatically allocate participating states' Electoral College votes to whoever wins the popular vote.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Langston Montgomery | 16 | 10154738540853675_10154739085228675 | When will we get it? A popular vote is just the inverse of the Electoral College--instead of focusing on a handful of states like Florida, Pennsylvania, and New Hampshire, candidates will only focus on states where most people live like CA, TX, and New York; and if you're a Republican in particular that should concern you.If we want real voting reform, we need to replace the current plurality, first-past-the-post voting system with ranked voting, instant runoffs, and a strict majority. That's how you get candidates to pay attention to the entire electorate.
2 | Sean Kelly | 23 | 10154738540853675_10154739073423675 | A democracy is the rule of majority.  The US is *not* a democracy; rather a republic based on the rule of law.  The word, "democracy" purposely does not appear in the Declaration of Independence, the US Constitution or any of the 50 state constitutions.The EC was purposely constructed by our Founding Fathers because they didn't want a democracy which are rife with whims and shortsighted political fads.The rule of law always trumps majority rule and our Founders presciently understood this.
3 | Evangeline Howard | 3 | 10154738540853675_10154739213178675 | This will diminish the power of the states, which is the intention. The founders wished local interests to have a stronger influence over federal power. This move takes control over government away from the governed, and is a mistake.
4 | Eric Jacobs | 2 | 10154738540853675_10154739109918675 | I'ts DEFINITELY time to revamp our voting system - the current electoral system made sense in the 1800s when communications were slow and distances great, but not any more.
5 | Christopher Brummet | 0 | 10154738540853675_10154739140673675 | Sorry but do not want California,New York,Illonios,Texas and Florida be the main states that pick our president most of those states do not agree with there views. The system is fine just think they want the change cause it wouldinsure the Democratic party would win all the time with the laws in some of these states. Sorry but we all should know why the Democratic party loves open borders cause eighty out of ten immagrants vote for them. They want to flood America to make sure they never lose just like this idea would be in there favor.
6 | Carole Banks | 0 | 10154738540853675_10154740906938675 | Then states with smaller populations would effectively have no voice at all.  Elections would be won by people in California, Florida and New York.  North Dakota would have no input at all, for example.  But with the electoral college, they do.
7 | Donna Demmin Church | 0 | 10154738540853675_10154740939723675 | As a New Yorker who has always voted in primaries as well as elections I'm beginning to wonder now 'whats the sense'. Oh to be sure, I will cast a vote tomorrow because as an American citizen it is my right. I just feel it is a senseless endeavor at this point. I mean I don't live in Pa, Fl, or any of these other 'swing states', so why bother? My vote does not count as much as theirs. As a WASP from the non-swing state of NY I feel I'm just going to be going through the motions. Do popular votes count? Do our votes matter? This last year has been a sickening, eye-opener to this America we live in. I'm not so proud anymore and that will stand no matter which of these people wins. God Bless America.
8 | Dustin Baugh | 0 | 10154738540853675_10154739290118675 | Popular vote probably wouldn't break us out of the 2 party system or slice into the fierce partisan contrasts we en up with. With the technology we have we can do better. Possibly a run off system combined with a popular vote so you could choose from multiple candidates that represent your interests and still not have to worry about throwing your vote away.The Bernie Sanders, Ted Cruz, Jill Stein, and Gary Johnsons would still be in play all election and if your 1st choice for president doesn't make it, we could all agree that your second choice is good too.
9 | Sj Lag | 0 | 10154738540853675_10154739082748675 | Could be like the Primaries and do it proportionally for each state ie: 30,35,10,10,5...Everybody gets an elector. Better for third and fourth parties. Keep the 269, each state is in play no more fly overs.
10 | Bruce Terry | 1 | 10154738540853675_10154739033838675 | It depends if it is the "popular vote" or the vote as reflected by the electors of each state.  It would make the campaign process much different if it was just a national vote.
11 | Brett H Hunter | 1 | 10154738540853675_10154739115238675 | It's simple one person one vote. Unfortunately as long as the electoral college appears to favor one party, it won't change.
12 | John Maniz | 0 | 10154738540853675_10154741489983675 | Americans care about the issues and not the superficial left wing social agenda trying to destroy this country. #WAKE UP and VOTE for the United States!!! Vote the issues!!! #VOTE TRUMP!!!
13 | Aurelio Varela | 0 | 10154738540853675_10154741116723675 | IF HILLARY wins CHINA winsThe end of USA is beginning.Democrats' quest  power at all costs will bring an end to USA.Amnesty and open borders will set a dangerous presedent unforseable to the blinded left.  Anybody born in the USA is automatically a citizen. China will undoubtedly take the oportunity to send as many immigrants as needed to put up shop in the USA.  They will copy the latino presedent of voting power and take it to a new level.  Once they have enough voters, they will make way to the whitehouse. Lobbying in Congress will be as strong as the NRA, Wall Street, Big Corporations. The national debt will be so high it will be impossible to pay thereby further weakening the economy.  By that time China will have landed on the moon and lay a claim of sovereignity there. The Chinese Armed forces will be more powerful than the USA.  They will have Thailand and Hong Kong.Democrats will have no option but to accept the chinese voters who will move up the ranks outnumbering latinos and other ethnic groups. Once in Congress and the Whitehouse there will be changes favorable to china.  All this power grabbing by the present Democrats will be for nothing.All will be lost.

15 | Virginia Perez | 3 | 10154738540853675_10154739033743675 | The Clinton PAC Trolls are highly threatened by this news. They will threaten you with Trump because that's his purpose. Two more states to add to the write Bernie to save the world vote, California and Washington can write in Bernie for a future to believe in. Vermont, Wyoming, Oregon, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Iowa, Delaware, and Alabama, write in Bernie too. Everybody else, your job is to vote third party so we can be rid of Trump/Clinton and kick this thing to the US House. The goal, keep Trump and Clinton out of the top three. Oh and big thanks to Utah for leading the way and going third party, neither Clinton nor Trump will reach 270, lets try to keep them out of the top three America!
16 | Mur Bally | 1 | 10154738540853675_10154739158018675 | Well it looks like a well orchestrated scheme, the recent FBI Investigation. A scheme between the FBI and the established Government of the US, to all of a sudden say there is no Email charges! When 99% of the World believe she has a pattern of breaking the law. The only thing left to do is for citizens of the World to then Petition the World Courts to look into the Corrupt Clinton Foundation. It now looks like it is out side the hands of the US Government! We have to show these crooked Clinton's that they can't keep breaking the Law flagrantly, and without consequence around the World! TRUMP 2016
17 | Chuck Johnson | 4 | 10154738540853675_10154739033678675 | The election is clearly being manipulated and American voters are being made fools of. It's official, the rule of law only applies if you are against liberals. The FBI news today was all a roose to divert attention from wikileaks, as Limbaugh, Jones and Savage predicted. Obama and Lynch clearly pressured Comey. They think we watch their dancing puppets and change our mind based on what they tell us. The fact remains that the emails exist and there are sick revelations of what she and the people she surrounds herself with. My resolve against her is stronger than ever because, not in spite of, this.
18 | Karen Greenberg | 0 | 10154738540853675_10154740535243675 | The popular vote should determine the winner. When this doesn't happen it is another reason the voters feel like their votes don't matter
19 | John Meshna | 1 | 10154738540853675_10154739062678675 | The electoral college just needs to be eliminated by a constitutional amendment.
20 | Rudy Gadrey | 4 | 10154738540853675_10154739027788675 | omg First it was rigged, then it wasn't rigged, and now it's rigged again!!!the Rigging has been Rigged!!!FBI Director James B. Comey notified key members of Congress that after a review of the newly discovered Hillary Clinton emails, which were found on a device used by former congressman Anthony Weiner, the agency stands by its original decision against recommending charges: “We have not changed our conclusions expressed in July.” MOMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
21 | Daniel Hoffman | 0 | 10154738540853675_10154741377918675 | Why would we need the electoral college if the popular vote counted?
22 | Matthew Dancz | 0 | 10154738540853675_10154739294733675 | That is silly, the electoral college should be divided between the candidates proportionally to that candidates popular vote in the state.
23 | Pete McGovern | 0 | 10154738540853675_10154740868618675 | The founding fathers had an inherent distrust of the general electorate for good reason. Don't screw with their wisdom.
24 | Thomas Fletcher Kildren | 0 | 10154738540853675_10154739426213675 | drop the current First Past the Post system and adopt what Maine is voting on a Ranked Vote system it will allow more parties than the 2 party gridlock we currently have.

Some academics say the Electoral College is inextricable from the history of slavery in the U.S.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Sean Kelly | 44 | 10154738879568675_10154738994753675 | With all due respect, you are interviewing a Canadian scholar to understand Americanism? 🤔A democracy is the rule of majority.  The US is *not* a democracy; rather a republic based on the rule of law.  The word, "democracy" purposely does not appear in the Declaration of Independence, the US Constitution or any of the 50 state constitutions.The EC was purposely constructed by our Founding Fathers because they didn't want a democracy.  The rule of law always trumps majority rule and our Founders presciently understood this.
2 | Chris Hottensen | 16 | 10154738879568675_10154739029578675 | If electoral college disappears, so will democracy. All candidates will have to do is court votes in the biggest cities and completely ignore rural states. Unless you live in Chicago, new York, los angeles, Houston or other huge cities, your vote will not matter to the candidates. If you want your vote to count, keep the electoral college.
3 | David Elmore | 7 | 10154738879568675_10154739049503675 | Our founding fathers didn't want bellicose blow hards to waltz in to America and take over like the tyrants of ancient Greece because the demogogues were able to bedazzle an unwitting and uninformed general public. That's what I learned in high school civics class.
4 | Todd Hansen | 5 | 10154738879568675_10154739630473675 | The Electoral College helps to ensure that smaller states have a voice. When the Constitution was drafted, state's rights were important to the founders. They didn't want a few large states dominating the political system. Currently, the fewest states one can win and still carry the Electoral College is 11, but those states would represent 57 percent of the population.
5 | Melissa Sailors | 3 | 10154738879568675_10154739381003675 | Yep, I used to question the electoral college, but after this election, I realized we still need it because we keep failing to learn the same lessons over and over and over again.
6 | John Gisondi | 5 | 10154738879568675_10154738966153675 | The structure of the Electoral College can be traced to the Centurial Assembly system of the Roman Republic. Under that system, the adult male citizens of Rome were divided, according to their wealth, into groups of 100 (called Centuries). Each group of 100 was entitled to cast only one vote either in favor or against proposals submitted to them by the Roman Senate. In the Electoral College system, the States serve as the Centurial groups (though they are not, of course, based on wealth), and the number of votes per State is determined by the size of each State's Congressional delegation. Still, the two systems are similar in design and share many of the same advantages and disadvantages. The similarities between the Electoral College and classical institutions are not accidental. Many of the Founding Fathers were well schooled in ancient history and its lessons. http://uselectionatlas.org/INFORMATION/INFORMATION/electcollege_history.php
7 | Nicholas Kavic | 3 | 10154738879568675_10154739491018675 | Voter ID laws aren't racist. Nations all over the globe have those laws. In India, there is widespread poverty and yet all of their poor have IDs to vote as do their wealthy. The purpose is to prevent fraud and corruption.
8 | Jason McHugh | 0 | 10154738879568675_10154739990683675 | What percentage of Constitutional scholars? The same number of scientists  that deny climate change is real?The argument and reasons are weak. Of course the south didn't want to lose power, hence the 3/5 compromise.The electoral college was put there because the founders didn't trust the unwashed masses. Used to think they were wrong, now I think they might be right.Whether or not it was in there wouldn't have made one difference to slavery, because the same people would have won the popular vote.The only time the popular vote and the electoral college didn't match was 1824, and a couple times after the civil war 1876 and 1888.No differences would have been made.
9 | Kurt Rex Cooper | 0 | 10154738879568675_10154739155848675 | It would not surprise me if it was, I am of the opinion one important reason the South joined the North to rebel was that the South figured British Empire would abolish slavery sooner than later (which it did in 1833) and wanted to preserve it.
10 | Tyler Dragoni | 3 | 10154738879568675_10154739335218675 | Awful idea. Following Maine and Nebraska's lead, winner by Congressional District would be fairer, need no cooperation from other states or a Constitutional amendment. No more 'swing states' but gerrymandering would have to be solved.
11 | Donelle Bomben | 0 | 10154738879568675_10154740005078675 | Sean Kelly, I am sorry, but his brain seems to work fine. They have democracy up there as well, and it seems to work a lot better these days.  Did you read where it says he is a visiting scholar?
12 | Zach Bernstein | 4 | 10154738879568675_10154739484678675 | Vestige of slavery or not, it's an un-democratic (small-d) system of deciding who leads the country. The fact that you can get the second-most number of votes and still be elected is enough to provide that.
13 | Jim Pasterczyk | 2 | 10154738879568675_10154739451723675 | Well A), it does give disproportionate political power to states with small populations, at that time of white males, and B) I think by now we've pretty much solved the major issues with respect to counting votes quickly and correctly so that the overall mood of the country can be gauged properly, haven't we?
14 | Ben Hardin | 0 | 10154738879568675_10154739536153675 | I'm neither strongly for nor strongly against eliminating the Electoral College (EC).  There are more important fish to fry.  Results of elections seldom are any different regardless of whether EC is operative and in those cases where they are different the popular vote is almost a tie.  I mildly favor eliminating the EC simply to pave the way for comprehensive electoral reforms.  I presented an alternative to both the EC and popular vote in the July 17 posting on the Facebook page Electoral Reform for a More Favorable Congress.
15 | Daniel P. B. Smith | 0 | 10154738879568675_10154741202833675 | There are a lot of vestiges of slavery. I'm only learning about them a bit at a time. For example, the cod that hangs in the State House is there because the commercial wealth of Massachusetts was founded on supplying cost-effective, shelf-stable, nourishing food to slaves on Caribbean plantations.
16 | Allen Hermann | 1 | 10154738879568675_10154739353608675 | I believe that the advent of electronic communications,has rendered the Electoral College redundant, there is for sake of argument no more rural communities everybody's connected with the exception of a few Luddite types!
17 | Tim Craig | 0 | 10154738879568675_10154739344458675 | Seems more likely that the conventional wisdom is correct in the car of the electoral college. That its there as a safeguard against a charismatic dictator type (I figure the likes of Napoleon) being popularly elected.
18 | Kevin Lock | 1 | 10154738879568675_10154739563398675 | With facial recognition and technology we have today, WHY do we need to overpay people who "say" they represent us? I am quite capable of speaking for myself and many homeless people could live on what that dead weight is being paid!
19 | Ed Weigandt | 1 | 10154738879568675_10154739079573675 | This is garbage. At the time, like it or not, slaves were not considered human, they were lawfully deemed as property. Also, like it or not, only white males of age were allowed to vote... then. What Madison was attempting to do was level the playing field. Madison knew the Northern States would out vote the Southern, leaving the Southern States with little to no Representation. What he did was make all States equal based on the State(s) population via a ratio formula. Furthermore, they did not have the internet, nor cell phones... no modern communications. They had horse and buggy, no planes, no cars. It would take time to cast, collect and count the vote. It would be far easier for the Electoral College votes to be counted and announced in the Senate, than the ballots of the popular vote. If you recall, all States in the Senate have to give their final vote tally in the Senate for the election results to become official. Far easier to count 4 votes vs 4,000 on the floor of the Senate and announce such. With that said, if you want to do away with the electoral college vote, as do I, then do so in a proper manner, stop tying everything to slavery and/or racism.
20 | Andy Laugisch | 0 | 10154738879568675_10154740816578675 | We either act as a nation or as a union of states similar to the EU.We have come far enough to end state sovereignty and become one true nation.The republic served its purpose, but the modern reality is...we need to grow or be outpaced by other nations. We should be striking unions with Canada and South America rather than sustaining an outdated union of states.

22 | Emily Waggoner | 1 | 10154738879568675_10154739280858675 | I'd happily vote it away. I think it would increase voter turn out. One person one vote. Simple. We have the technology for it - no reason not to.

24 | Joyce Bugg | 0 | 10154738879568675_10154739354388675 | It appears only educated, people w/wealth, owned land, or property; could vote. Not common people, sharecroppers, women, slaves & etc. White men that's it
25 | Curt Siters | 0 | 10154738879568675_10154739993528675 | Oh how wrong this is...The House is elected by and represent the people.The Senate was filled by state legislatures to represent the states.The President was elected by the two of them to represent both the states and the people (this is the electoral college).The only connection it had to slavery was because the census counted slaves as 2/3's of a person.

In July, FBI director James Comey said that the bureau would not recommend criminal charges against Clinton. That conclusion has not changed, he said today.

1 | Frank Rioux | 388 | 10154738769073675_10154738783158675 | Shame on him. Apologies are called for. Start with an apology to the American people.
2 | Darren Benjamin | 298 | 10154738769073675_10154738783573675 | This f*cking clown, partisan hack had better have his resignation letter prepared. Perhaps he can apply for the head of a law enforcement agency in some banana republic.

5 | Kim Kulchycki | 113 | 10154738769073675_10154738788483675 | What a douche. This should be considered election tampering, his announcement.

7 | Regina Johnsen Mardex | 60 | 10154738769073675_10154738836373675 | That may be so, however the damage this stunt has caused over the past week  is likely irreparable.  Remember the Karl Rove whisper campaigns and thinking, "Could it get any lower?"  I do, and it has.  Now, it is said loudly and over and over and over...
8 | Kathleen Mathers | 52 | 10154738769073675_10154738838048675 | If the same conclusion as last July, then nothing has changed! Why did the FBI do this, except to help mr Trump!! Will this make the news or simply be a side comment?? That was a total waste.
9 | Sandor Feher | 50 | 10154738769073675_10154738771268675 | On the 8th of November (Natalis of Nerva), at 8:20 PM Eastern Standard Time, Hillary Diane Rodham Clinton in this dress will be announced as the final, and projected winner of the 2016th Presidential Elections.
10 | Gary Rold | 23 | 10154738769073675_10154738903213675 | I have been suspicious of the FBI since the Hoover days but the handling of this email matter by Comey and his staff has been unconscionable. If you don't have EVIDENCE of wrong doing, you don't report anything.
11 | Sara Meyer | 21 | 10154738769073675_10154738877553675 | He should have investigated this before EVER announcing they were looking deeper. This was a total political move to help Trump. 😡
12 | Gareth Fales | 39 | 10154738769073675_10154738807323675 | Fox and Breitbart scrambling to decide whether Comey is the traitor of last month or still the "patriot" of yesterday. It's so cruel to treat these poor upstanding news agencies so badly!
13 | Jerry Savage | 38 | 10154738769073675_10154738886678675 | In other words, Comey misled the American people causing a significant shift in attitudes and voting behavior at a critical point in the race. He needs to make a public announcement on television and then hand in his resignation for violation of the Hatch Act.
14 | Carlos A. Morillo | 15 | 10154738769073675_10154738882488675 | Irresponsible and incompetent F.B.I. director James Comey should resign for all the churn created by his false alarm during the last 10 days.
15 | Shawn Chauvette | 4 | 10154738769073675_10154739063448675 | No conviction for gross negligence. I guess I'll just have to not vote for her because she is too stupid to handle classified material. She wasn't smart enough to not tell the world our nuclear response time on national tv, why would I think she would be smart enough not to give away more secrets during a a state of the union address?
16 | Ann Bottolene | 24 | 10154738769073675_10154738879418675 | It certainly begs the question why, if he could review the documents in such a timely manner, did he not wait to inform Congress. He owes an apology to Hillary and all the people of this country.
17 | Earl Heller | 3 | 10154738769073675_10154739081668675 | There are 691,200 seconds in 8 days. The investigation reopened 8 days ago. There were 650,000 emails to look over. You do the math...Seems legit...
18 | Don Tartasky | 15 | 10154738769073675_10154738928068675 | Time to resign Comey. Time for Internal Affairs investigation of FBI NYC office to determine responsibility for leaks to press, Kallstrom and Giuliani.

20 | Sarah Louise | 16 | 10154738769073675_10154738888288675 | But, ah, the damage is done. And I suspect that was the purpose all along. A very nicely played move to rig the election for Donald Trump. If he wins, he can thank Comey.
21 | Janice Groves Maioli | 9 | 10154738769073675_10154738881343675 | You should spend the rest of Sunday typing your resignation letter for Wednesday. How the hell do you think you can be trusted to work for ... Madame President
22 | Sam T. Abraham | 11 | 10154738769073675_10154738893973675 | I'd think an apology is in order, oh and how about Comey speaks to the American people concerning his timely letter  10 days ago.. that clearly had an effect on this election
23 | Audrey Muller | 13 | 10154738769073675_10154738833018675 | You should be fired for putting out lies, that could (but won't change history). More people believe in Hillary than her dam emails!
24 | Nancy Wesselman | 11 | 10154738769073675_10154738885413675 | Can this please be the end of the attacks on her?

25 | Rebecca Hurst Ruvalcaba | 10 | 10154738769073675_10154738800993675 | That's it?!! All faith lost in this institution- supposed to be not a partisan position- hardly! Too little and too late of an ooops- shame on you😡

It is hard to tell how he can come on TV at CNN every night disgracing D. J. Trump when he himself committed such a disposable act! What was he showing the States teens for an example as their peer, Donald is stepping in as a Steward to the young of America. Not as this example as we see in this article:Evidence reason Bakari Sellers' DUI charge droppedLaDonna BeekerApr 8, 2013 05:16 PMCHESTER COUNTY, SC (WIS) - Evidence in a state representative's driving under the influence case allowed him to plea to a lesser charge.    State Rep. Bakari Sellers was charged with DUI on Oct. 7 when he was traveling north on Interstate 77 just after 1 a.m. from a South Carolina football game, where he admitted to deputies he was drinking alcohol. Sellers refused a breath test, resulting in an automatic six-month driver's license suspension. His license was reinstated in February by a judicial panel.However, Sellers will not see any more consequences from the DUI charge because video surveillance from the deputy's patrol car did not match the date on Sellers' ticket. Because the evidence did not flow, it could not hold up in court.Sellers was allowed to plead guilty to reckless driving and pay a $475 fine. Court documents show he signed an affidavit April 1 acknowledging his guilt to the lesser charge."I am very pleased to have been cleared of all alcohol-related charges from my traffic stop in Chester County last fall," Sellers said in a statement released Friday.He takes "full responsibility" for his actions and admitted he was too tired to drive."I apologize and will do my best to set a better example for our youth and to continue to move South Carolina forward," Sellers said." I don't think he should explain properness when he is so drunk with words against a person that stands for America! As unbelievably, there is shocking videos on the net of his DUI arrest! TRUMP 2016

“A smaller and smaller slice of the electorate are making decisions that are important."
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Allen Hermann | 71 | 10154738327833675_10154738528723675 | It's because Civics classes were cut out of high school education in an effort to dumb down the masses, when you have a majority of people who don't know how the government works ,which is the case today , they can be herded much more easily!
2 | Steve Warner | 54 | 10154738327833675_10154738587768675 | It's partly because of our antiquated election system of having to waiting hours in long lines, gerrymandering districts so voters don't think their voices are heard and simply the dumbing down of the American electorate.
3 | Alex Lindstrom | 30 | 10154738327833675_10154738558328675 | You'd be surprised how much of it has to do with a series of purposefully limiting regulations (voting isn't a national holiday, frequently on a work day, often inconvenient hours, not all states have early voting) and the fact that voting requires registration and so is essentially 'opt-in'. The difference between opt-in and opt-out (the latter implying that registration is automatic for everyone) is huge in political psychology, yet isn't mentioned here. Additionally, ongoing disenfranchisement of certain groups and rock-bottom trust in government are factors. While the article is right to indicate that it isn't any one thing, that doesn't change the fact that there's a litany of glaring potential factors that we should be doing something about now.
4 | Jackie Carmichael | 16 | 10154738327833675_10154738561828675 | In my opinion it is a combination of voter disenfranchising, gerrymandering, dirty money in politics, dirty politicians and a two party system that is as crooked as a nine dollar bill, it’s no wonder people don’t feel their votes count. The whole system needs overhauling and ‘we the people’ need to be in charge of who represents us again.
5 | Molly Walts | 18 | 10154738327833675_10154738516343675 | We are getting more and more disgusted at the fact that voting doesn't change a darn thing. The few truly good people who are sent to help govern are either quickly corrupted, or too few to matter.
6 | Julie Rosenwinkel | 10 | 10154738327833675_10154738549013675 | Two reasons. Our choices. Not enough. We need another major 3rd and 4th party candidate and rank voting. Secondly, voting needs to be a national holiday, and we need free transport to polling stations, and we need to have paper ballots in addition to electronic votes to be able to check votes because it is starting to look like our votes don't matter.  Get rid of presidents day holiday and make it into a federal voting day holiday, and for the primaries too.
7 | Greta Hernandez | 3 | 10154738327833675_10154739294958675 | We don't have a democracy! We have Corporatocracy.... Corporations have lobbyists who make the laws in favor of Corporations. This is one reason why the Middle Class is disappearing.
8 | Matt Morrison | 2 | 10154738327833675_10154739101193675 | This is why! A small handful of wealthy, evil, greedy and very powerful individuals create vast networks to shuffle their blood money through to get what they want so they can get even richer.They're corrupt and don't care about you and me. They make sure that Citizen's United is passed and that the Voting Rights Act of 1965 is gutted to prevent good honest people of different races and nationalities from casting their votes.

9 | Sharon Stone | 1 | 10154738327833675_10154739082763675 | Hmmm - I wonder if it is because voters hear the message - your vote doesn't count (when you are one party and the opposite party always wins your state)  Or maybe they hear - If you are going to vote for so and so you might as well stay home.  Or maybe it's - you know it's your fault for getting us into this mess after all, you voted for him/her.  Maybe it is the story after story they hear about voter fraud, rigged machines, redistricting, lost ballots, broken machines, long lines and inaccurate voter rolls.  Or perhaps they are sick and tired of the mud slinging, the hemorrhaging of money and career politicians who serve themselves and not the public.  Perhaps they sick of a two party system that seems to have no cares or concerns for the people and a government that no longer seems to work.  We should be encouraging people to vote, celebrating the excersing of their vote, making it easy for people to vote.We should be educating our young people to believe that they can make a difference and allow them to make a difference.  Every 18 year old student should be registered to vote before they leave High School.
10 | Deanna Umpangco Laquian | 1 | 10154738327833675_10154739004473675 | Maybe just maybe because it's on a week day? When people are working, and are obliged to be in school? Especially college students who need to fill absentee ballots because where they're registered is far from where they're at at Election Day. And workers who risk losing their jobs if they miss a minute on the field.Second is voter suppression efforts--closing of polling places thereby limiting places where to vote; purging lists, that turn away voters, not knowing they can reinstate before elections, or vote via provisional ballots until a verdict is reached by the cases in court; and last but not least, voter intimidation. I would have to say the last one actually doesn't work, and have the opposite effect to Americans: the more you try to inhibit people from expressing their freedom of right to vote, the more energized Americans get.
11 | Patricia James | 3 | 10154738327833675_10154738616488675 | The problem with voter turnout has a lot to due with the continuing drop in the quality of education in our country.  It also has a lot to do with citizens who only seem interested in voting for things that benefit them directly, instead of for the good of the community, state or country. There is also a problem with a large number of the electorate that does not pay attention to what is going on except around election time. Add to that those who get discouraged easily and give up on the whole process, when it is their civic duty to stay informed, investigate what is on the ballot from objective sources and vote their conscience. Americans used to be courageous, intelligent and proactive.  What happened, America?
12 | Dotti Cade | 0 | 10154738327833675_10154739095173675 | Maybe it's because we're so frustrated that the issues that matter to us aren't dealt with the way we ask those who represent is to handle them. Maybe we don't feel our votes or opinions  count. Maybe we feel the politicians think only of what's good for them personally and not what's good for the country. Maybe because we're tired of our elected officials acting like pre-schoolers who have not yet learned the lessons of teamwork!   Don't get me wrong - I'm ever the optimist, but always have to have a talk to remind myself that voting is a privilege and responsibility fought for by a lot of people through a lot of generations. I'm not about to let them down by ignoring what they fought so hard to attain!
13 | Michael D. Wells | 1 | 10154738327833675_10154738968953675 | For starters...a large incarcerated population that cannot vote once out of jail; a declining educational system that teaches to tests; voter suppression efforts/gerrymandering; crappy candidates that don't really spell out policy positions; a news media that concentrates on ratings and not on informing us; a news media that caters to the extreme left or extreme right; an election season that lasts as long as an administration; too much shady money; pledges to outside groups and not to constituents...
14 | Layla Foshee | 0 | 10154738327833675_10154741142663675 | Voter turnout is low because of the electoral college. In some ways, unless you live in a battleground state, it almost feels pointless. It is NOT pointless...I didn't say THAT. I'm saying it almost feels that way. I vote anyway. I feel it's my duty.
15 | Christy Snadow | 0 | 10154738327833675_10154739371518675 | When you want to vote for say, Bernie Sanders, and there is all but a news black out on anything positive about him and you have DNC-Debbie and DNC-Donna working for Hillary and against Bernie, you begin to see how futile an individual's participation can be.
16 | Kevin R Johnson | 1 | 10154738327833675_10154738687233675 | I probably should actually read this before commenting...but it seems like a waste of time.We have low voter turnout because we are spoiled, we are not terribly bright and we have utterly no idea what our country is truly about.If you don't vote, you are WORSE than ISIS.If you vote Trump, you are Equally bad as ISIS.

I have never missed a vote since I became of age. In California I never needed to be in line longer than 10 minutes. They have polling places everywhere. In Indiana I have to vote early as they think a 2 to 3 hr wait is fine. Despicable.

Closing poll stations to force voters to wait in long lines, requiring photo ID's etc. We should have mandatory voting like taxes and have a national voting day but Republicans,the great patriots that they are, refuse to entertain the idea.
24 | Bruce Bennett | 0 | 10154738327833675_10154738877158675 | Maybe the system itself and the candidates it produces don't in any way represent many of the people. Is it impossible for all of you who say, "Vote! It's your duty!" to imagine an election that is so evil you would not take part? That's what many of us believe is offered, and taking part legitimizes the process.
25 | Nicodimos Safos | 0 | 10154738327833675_10154739326433675 | Because people figured it out that Presidents and congress are marionettes of the Industrial Military Complex.

"For me, it's principle, not party." This Florida couple says Jill Stein is more in line with their politics than either Clinton or Trump. For more on what's motivating Florida voters: http://to.pbs.org/2epFe84

Toss your vote away on a candidate without a snowballs chance in Hell and help elect a lying racist misogynist.You're just as bad as DT's supporters for thinking you're taking the high road.Save yourself the time and just don't vote at all = same result.
2 | Chris Allen | 91 | 10154738307813675_10154738359553675 | I wonder how many Nader voters in Florida regretted their vote after 8 years of Bush? I'd love to see some of them interviewed.
3 | Bob Hunter | 42 | 10154738307813675_10154738641758675 | I live in an overwhelmingly red state. A vote for Clinton here will not prevent Trump from getting the state. A vote for Clinton would be a wasted voted. But a vote for Jill could make a difference for the future. 3% and the Green party is on the ballot in my state for 2018, 5% and they get funding in the next national election. Don't ever let people tell you that voting for a third party presidential candidate is a wasted vote. They are not as politically savvy as they think they are.
4 | Charles Kenneth Conner | 78 | 10154738307813675_10154738337008675 | Too bad it's not about math. In a binary election, a vote for a third party simply favors the underdog of the two. Basic math. It's better to vote based on where you are on the political spectrum and choose one of the two candidates that can win which more closely matches your point on the spectrum.
5 | George Argentos | 33 | 10154738307813675_10154738534878675 | Idealistic fools. they have an infant son and are voting for a person who believes vaccines cause autism. Get enough of them and they could put Florida, and its 25 electoral votes,  safely in the red. Oh yes, let's focus on 2020 and beyond when we'll have repealed the VRA, Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, Roe v. Wade, and, of course, the ACA. All while giving more tax breaks to the fossil fuel industry. Yeah, the environment will be in great shape then. This guy's thinking is as bad as his haircut.
6 | Jeffrey David Zacko-Smith | 27 | 10154738307813675_10154738529368675 | It's not about "basic math", it's not about "wasting your vote" -- people fought and died so we could each vote for the person and policy ideas that WE EACH most believe in. I'm not going to be forced to vote for a candidate I neither trust nor respect and this year it's BOTH the Democrats and Republicans that fit into this reality. Voting for a candidate is like buying a product -- your purchase or your vote sanction (or do not sanction through the withholding) the product, its sellers and its creators. So save the fear mongering and math lectures for those who are stupid enough to buy into those arguments (I have a PhD and know plenty about math, thank you). Oh, and if the Democrats wanted to wipe the floor with Trump, perhaps they should have put forward a stronger candidate?
7 | Josh Smith | 12 | 10154738307813675_10154738825593675 | If you vote for the warmongering right wing capitalist billionaire, whether it is Trump or Clinton, you are scum. Stein is the only way to go. No more wars. No more pipelines. Let's start putting wealthy politicians and capitalists where they belong: in prison, not in the drivers seat.
8 | Gail Nilson | 14 | 10154738307813675_10154738548503675 | Per an interview on Bill Maher, retired politician Barney Frank, Jill Stein doesn't follow through. She comes in with grandiose ideas and when no one thinks they're doable, she gets up and leaves. Also, she's against vaccinations. Not real practical for a physician.
9 | Elizabeth Kellogg | 12 | 10154738307813675_10154738622448675 | #JillStein got my vote and I couldn't be more at ease with it.  I haven't had to wonder what's gonna come next, or what crapola might come out of her mouth.  It's not about winning now folks, we already know we are under a 2 party closed democracy.  It is about getting the votes to open up that 2 party closed democracy so we don't have to go through an election like this again.  It is called.....thinking ahead.
10 | Mike Mezanko | 10 | 10154738307813675_10154738366678675 | If we want to "hold her feet to the fire" - we need to have real options - if it is just a Democrat and a Republican in 2020, we do not have any leverage...there would be no fire to hold her to, if it is her again and whoever the Good ol' party brings to the table...the two party system is obviously a con - and it has to go!
11 | Adam Christian | 16 | 10154738307813675_10154738335953675 | PBS doing its establishment thing, trying to peddle the same old mythology that votes for the Green Party will somehow lose the election for weak Democrats. Choose actual liberal candidates, Dems, and you might not lose all the sensible voters.
12 | Adrian Luhowy | 6 | 10154738307813675_10154738512368675 | Sometimes it's easier to not think about the effect one's choices have on others. "I'm voting my way and I don't care about the consequences" - may seem reasonable to some.
13 | Demi Andre | 3 | 10154738307813675_10154740069318675 | If Trump was not the alternative, if it was a moderate Republican, then I would say go for it, vote third party, blow the joint up and teach both Reps and Dems a lesson but really, have you heard Trump talking..?!  You're willing to risk all environmental progress...an all or none bet on your son's future and the future of all our kids cause Trump sure isn't going to get you or me what we want.
14 | Joe Condiracci | 1 | 10154738307813675_10154741462178675 | No. It is about what issues are important to you, and which candidate will actually want to and be able to enact them. Considering that the only way Jill Stein will get into the Oval Office is if she pays for a tour, the only reasonable vote is for Clinton. Period.
15 | Dave Platt | 4 | 10154738307813675_10154738505858675 | "Throwing" is a good word choice -- but it should actually read, "They are throwing their vote away by voting for Green Party candidate, Jill Stein."
16 | Karen Lara | 6 | 10154738307813675_10154738333533675 | I understand what they're saying, and I sympathize. But let's be realistic. She has no chance. This is why I am 100% sure that Trump will win Florida and will win the election.
17 | Tara LeAnn Peyton | 17 | 10154738307813675_10154738862683675 | I'll be following suit and voting for Jill Stein! to me Jill is the only choice. She is the only candidate running a clean campaign. I'm not voting for an orange pervert or a sneaky old war monger. Voting for a candidate you despise is the true definition of throwing away your vote. These are your options guys!!! Read their platforms and learn everything you can about them. Don't fall for the 2 party trap. You do have options and if enough people utilize those options anything is possible!
18 | Eric Paul Meier | 2 | 10154738307813675_10154739966598675 | Vote your conscience. Just remember what a Trump presidency will do. Roll back all the progressive things Obama did, create a police state to remove all undocumented people, ban all Muslims, cripple our attempt to address climate change, dismantle any progressive agenda that Bernie sanders has worked his entire life on, and continue a Supreme Court with a rightwing agenda - sustaining the Citizens United decision which flooded our democracy with big money. Your choice...
19 | Martha Bobbitt Myers | 1 | 10154738307813675_10154741196033675 | I don't understand the thinking that if you're an environmental voter, you need to vote for Jill Stein. She can't win so the Dems are the best chance this year of keeping the Paris agreement and moving forward. A Trump presidency scares me to death over concerns for the environment. Increasing the fossil fuel industry and getting rid of the EPA (which he has proposed) would be disastrous IMO.
20 | Matthew Adams | 1 | 10154738307813675_10154741500893675 | It's sad how so many people will post comments essentially demanding you not exercise democracy and instead vote for only one of two candidates, and/or blaming you if their preferred candidate loses. Just come clean and admit what America has isn't democracy, its corruption. At least then your arguments for picking one of only two candidates make sense.
21 | KV Kelly | 3 | 10154738307813675_10154738743238675 | Jill Stein is an insult to the intelligence of all those who will vote for her. I don't view her candidacy seriously bcuz her off year efforts are non-existent w/respect to running Green candidates in other races in receptive states. As the leader of the Green Party she must do more than run for President every four years to make the party viable.
22 | Jeff Clark | 2 | 10154738307813675_10154738557643675 | Exercising their rights, just in a rather counterproductive and selfish fashion - let us all know how that works for you over the next 4 years - said they don't want to wait until 2020 ... LOL if "T" gets elected she'll have to wait longer than that -
23 | Sandy Brakeman Zinninger | 6 | 10154738307813675_10154738512113675 | Well while they are sitting up there on their high horses claiming to be "principled" there is actually only one candidate who will be strong on the environment and has an actual chance of implementing policy. Its just stupid.
24 | Jeff Fox | 5 | 10154738307813675_10154738757998675 | I'm sure Stein has some good ideas, but her and her party have not earned my vote. It takes work and effort to do that. And a party that half-heartedly jumps into the election cycle every four years is not doing it.
25 | Robert Walz | 2 | 10154738307813675_10154740562403675 | Jill Stein has no chance to get elected. A vote for her is not a wasted vote, it potentially a vote for Trump. We need to learn how to build coalitions and bridges and not destroy the environmental progress we have made or potentially can make with a progressive. Trump does accept global warming and worse yet he is invested in the pipeline. Actions have consequences. We are stronger together. Vote for Hillary.

1 | Pete Bender | 7 | 10154737853663675_10154738150783675 | So how did Hillary get so rich? Bernie says she was bought and paid for by Wall Street, was he wrong? And did he get bought off or blackmailed? Wikileaks says blackmailed and we know about the Lake House. So how did Hillary get so rich? Those must have been some really good speeches, too bad we aren't good enough donors to hear them.
2 | Sj Lag | 2 | 10154737853663675_10154738251723675 | That this race is close, is telling on both sides. If Clinton didn't have her baggage imagine the results . Trump should be further ahead because He's running against Hillary Clinton for heaven sake, but He refuses to stop being Donald Trump at his most extreme. Whomever looses they have only themselves to blame. And now America has to pay the price.

5 | John Northerner | 4 | 10154737853663675_10154738037323675 | This picture represents the American way as far as Hillary Clinton is concerned. That's why I can't possibly vote for her. I can not think of a single instance where Clinton's leadership has allowed diplomacy or democracy to triumph over oppression or tyranny. But I can easily name 6 instances where she has done exactly the opposite. She has left a trail of dead children, bloated body bags and bloody refugees from Honduras to Iraq to Libya to Palestine to Syria to Yemen in America's name. Turning Syria into the new Iraq is not progress. Her foreign policy of domination and regime change will only fan the flames of terrorism instead of making the world a better place. I'm voting for a candidate who views Progressive values as cornerstones instead of concessions. I want America's children to have the same rights and opportunities that are enjoyed by the modern nations. Clinton believes that universal health care and publicly provided higher education are impossible dreams for America. I'm not voting for that kind of negativity and defeatism and I implore you to also vote against Clinton because she wants to be our first war queen and little more. She's totally given up on universal healthcare. She's surrendered to the medical-industrial complex and the tiny wealthy few. Instead of making higher education a right, she has a plan to turn it into a welfare benefit for families earning under a certain amount. That's not making it a right. That's making it a welfare benefit. One that will only deepen the class divide. I'm voting for a woman of unimpeachable integrity instead of wasting my vote on an extremely divisive figure whose impeachment is an inevitability. Hillary Clinton wants to legalize some kind of GMO marijuana on behalf of Monsanto while perpetuating the asinine and ignorant ban that results in the arrest of 2,000 of our countrymen every day. That's not progress. I urge you to vote against the arms and pharmaceutical and incarceration industries and instead to vote for long overdue progress and freedom. Vote for a doctor and teacher of medicine instead of a doctor of death and destruction. Please join me in voting for Doctor Jill Stein. Voting for Hillary Clinton comes with a price tag that I can not bear. That price tag is innocent children murdered by American arms for nothing more than greed.

It is surprising that CNN didn't call for immediate resignation or employment of Angela Rye on CNN! Here is the heinous, awful, awful rhetoric below:"Petition to have Angela Rye Removed from CNN""Tonight on CNN's Anderson Cooper program, "political analyst" Angela Rye made the inflammatory statement that "police are shooting black people for sport".  This on the heels of several controversial officer-involved shootings, and the night after the murder of 5 Dallas police officers by someone who was angry about the recent shootings.  Her appearance on the segment was hostile, rude, divisive, and her statement was guaranteed to fuel the fires of racism and violence that are a major crisis in our country right now.  Thankfully another guest on the program immediately replied that that was the most offensive thing he had ever heard on the network, and the host, who was clearly appalled as well, immediately tried to interject.  But the damage was done.  I second the opinion that it was the most offensive thing I've ever heard on CNN, and would take that a step further to say it's probably one of the most offensive things I've ever heard on TV.  Ms. Rye should be ashamed to make such a statement at any time, and so much moreso when so many police officers were just hurt and killed in the Dallas ambush.  But I did some research on her, and was shocked and horrified to find that Ms. Rye is not some independent activist invited on for the night...she is a paid employee of CNN and regularly makes such inflammatory appearances.  She also is a guest on NPR and many other shows and networks.  I'm appalled that she has such a large platform with which to spread such a hateful agenda.  I would ask most importantly for CNN to immediately remove Ms. Rye from the program, review her statements, and then terminate her employment.  I would also ask that CNN release a statement condemning her comments, and that Ms. Rye issue an apology for making such a dangerous and obviously false statement on national television.  We need speakers on TV who are working to calm the situation down and advocate peace and moderation and working together.  Ms. Rye clearly is an awful person with the worst agenda, and she needs to be removed from her platform before she can further damage this great country with her hateful speech."Taken from an excerpt of a petition to have her removed. By: Troy Dillon:Here are some quotes, of 52 people; that have signed for her to be removed."Our country needs healing. We do not need major media outlets supporting people who use inflammatory statements intended to keep anger flowing. Angela Rye's rhetoric can only encourage more violence." Nancy Forston, Red Oak, Texas"This is getting absolutely out of hand, hate only breeds hate."Jacob Barnard, Chandler, AZ4 months ago(Listing many more.)Is this Angela Rye show a Commentator, that we should be listening to on her evaluation's of Mr. D.

It is hard to tell how he can come on TV at CNN every night disgracing D. J. Trump when he himself committed such a disposable act! What was he showing the States teens for an example as their peer, Donald is stepping in as a Steward to the young of America. Not as this example as we see in this article:Evidence reason Bakari Sellers' DUI charge droppedLaDonna BeekerApr 8, 2013 05:16 PMCHESTER COUNTY, SC (WIS) - Evidence in a state representative's driving under the influence case allowed him to plea to a lesser charge.    State Rep. Bakari Sellers was charged with DUI on Oct. 7 when he was traveling north on Interstate 77 just after 1 a.m. from a South Carolina football game, where he admitted to deputies he was drinking alcohol. Sellers refused a breath test, resulting in an automatic six-month driver's license suspension. His license was reinstated in February by a judicial panel.However, Sellers will not see any more consequences from the DUI charge because video surveillance from the deputy's patrol car did not match the date on Sellers' ticket. Because the evidence did not flow, it could not hold up in court.Sellers was allowed to plead guilty to reckless driving and pay a $475 fine. Court documents show he signed an affidavit April 1 acknowledging his guilt to the lesser charge."I am very pleased to have been cleared of all alcohol-related charges from my traffic stop in Chester County last fall," Sellers said in a statement released Friday.He takes "full responsibility" for his actions and admitted he was too tired to drive."I apologize and will do my best to set a better example for our youth and to continue to move South Carolina forward," Sellers said." I don't think he should explain properness when he is so drunk with words against a person that stands for America! As unbelievably, there is shocking videos on the net of his DUI arrest! TRUMP 2016

6 | Mur Bally | 1 | 10154737645678675_10154738791778675 | Investigation of Corrupt Clinton Wall Bangers Part 9Angela RyeAfter close examination on Prayers for Dallas Police Officer's that were fallen. It is surprising that CNN didn't call for immediate resignation or employment of Angela Rye on CNN! Here is the heinous, awful, awful rhetoric below:"Petition to have Angela Rye Removed from CNN""Tonight on CNN's Anderson Cooper program, "political analyst" Angela Rye made the inflammatory statement that "police are shooting black people for sport".  This on the heels of several controversial officer-involved shootings, and the night after the murder of 5 Dallas police officers by someone who was angry about the recent shootings.  Her appearance on the segment was hostile, rude, divisive, and her statement was guaranteed to fuel the fires of racism and violence that are a major crisis in our country right now.  Thankfully another guest on the program immediately replied that that was the most offensive thing he had ever heard on the network, and the host, who was clearly appalled as well, immediately tried to interject.  But the damage was done.  I second the opinion that it was the most offensive thing I've ever heard on CNN, and would take that a step further to say it's probably one of the most offensive things I've ever heard on TV.  Ms. Rye should be ashamed to make such a statement at any time, and so much moreso when so many police officers were just hurt and killed in the Dallas ambush.  But I did some research on her, and was shocked and horrified to find that Ms. Rye is not some independent activist invited on for the night...she is a paid employee of CNN and regularly makes such inflammatory appearances.  She also is a guest on NPR and many other shows and networks.  I'm appalled that she has such a large platform with which to spread such a hateful agenda.  I would ask most importantly for CNN to immediately remove Ms. Rye from the program, review her statements, and then terminate her employment.  I would also ask that CNN release a statement condemning her comments, and that Ms. Rye issue an apology for making such a dangerous and obviously false statement on national television.  We need speakers on TV who are working to calm the situation down and advocate peace and moderation and working together.  Ms. Rye clearly is an awful person with the worst agenda, and she needs to be removed from her platform before she can further damage this great country with her hateful speech."Taken from an excerpt of a petition to have her removed. By: Troy Dillon:Here are some quotes, of 52 people; that have signed for her to be removed."Our country needs healing. We do not need major media outlets supporting people who use inflammatory statements intended to keep anger flowing. Angela Rye's rhetoric can only encourage more violence." Nancy Forston, Red Oak, Texas"This is getting absolutely out of hand, hate only breeds hate."Jacob Barnard, Chandler, AZ4 months ago(Listing many more.)Is this Angela Rye show a Commentator, that we should be listening to on her evaluation's of Mr. D. J. Trump!JOIN THE MOVEMENT OVER THE BARRICADES OF THE WASHINGTON ESTABLISHMENT! TRUMP 2016

It is hard to tell how he can come on TV at CNN every night disgracing D. J. Trump when he himself committed such a disposable act! What was he showing the States teens for an example as their peer, Donald is stepping in as a Steward to the young of America. Not as this example as we see in this article:Evidence reason Bakari Sellers' DUI charge droppedLaDonna BeekerApr 8, 2013 05:16 PMCHESTER COUNTY, SC (WIS) - Evidence in a state representative's driving under the influence case allowed him to plea to a lesser charge.    State Rep. Bakari Sellers was charged with DUI on Oct. 7 when he was traveling north on Interstate 77 just after 1 a.m. from a South Carolina football game, where he admitted to deputies he was drinking alcohol. Sellers refused a breath test, resulting in an automatic six-month driver's license suspension. His license was reinstated in February by a judicial panel.However, Sellers will not see any more consequences from the DUI charge because video surveillance from the deputy's patrol car did not match the date on Sellers' ticket. Because the evidence did not flow, it could not hold up in court.Sellers was allowed to plead guilty to reckless driving and pay a $475 fine. Court documents show he signed an affidavit April 1 acknowledging his guilt to the lesser charge."I am very pleased to have been cleared of all alcohol-related charges from my traffic stop in Chester County last fall," Sellers said in a statement released Friday.He takes "full responsibility" for his actions and admitted he was too tired to drive."I apologize and will do my best to set a better example for our youth and to continue to move South Carolina forward," Sellers said." I don't think he should explain properness when he is so drunk with words against a person that stands for America! As unbelievably, there is shocking videos on the net of his DUI arrest! TRUMP 2016

After Election Day, Senate Democrats will have a new leader: Sen. Chuck Schumer.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | テイル ドラッガー | 67 | 10154735521348675_10154737735093675 | I usually vote against incumbents who prove to be ineffective leaders in Washington. This year I'm voting all Dem. Maybe a couple independents. I almost never do this. Gridlock must be overcome for anything to happen. This party is more aligned with my values. Those values however are sure to be watered down by the rising right wing populism and HCs proven track record of moving to the center on every issue wherever that center takes her. That's not leadership but it's easily the most sane possible outcome of this election. I consider myself a reasonably well informed adult. I don't know how else to respond to the potential crisis of government before us if republicans get any kind of control. I don't know how you can possibly be undecided. I get the anger toward the establishment some of it is totally legitimate, I understand how ignorance makes rhetoric like DTs so appealing -- every problem is so easy just elect me I'll fix everything on day one by pushing a button. But this is not student council. Wake up.
2 | Suzanne Allen Crabtree | 68 | 10154735521348675_10154737715493675 | You can say what you want about Hillary, but there has never been a more qualified candidate.  The choice is obvious and you'll be saying #MadamePresident on November 8th!!  Vote Blue All The Way! It's gonna be a Blue Blizzard!  ❄🇺🇸 ❄🇺🇸 ❄🇺🇸
3 | Sheldon Campbell | 6 | 10154735521348675_10154737640278675 | Have to feel a little sorry for Dick Durbin. He has been a loyal and effective Dem whip and has seniority, but he's getting passed over. Probably going to remain in the same job under Schumer, which has to be a little humiliating.
4 | Gavin Ng | 4 | 10154735521348675_10154737907263675 | One of the few things I take issue with...is that he voted to override Obama's veto to sue Saudi Arabia for being responsible for 9-11, which makes me wonder about how the senate can think illogically. For example, Afghanistan was responsible for 9-11, yet it was decided that Iraq should be invaded. Al Qaeda's Osama bin Lasen was responsible, and not Saddam Hussein. It's like apples vs oranges...anyway, coming back to the main point, why would one override the veto to sue a country when other countries, in turn, would now have the right to sue the US (especially military) for all kinds of atrocities committee elsewhere, such as Okinawa, Korea, etc. That being said, he is an imperfect Senator, as in most cases with everyone else in the Senate. But, he has tried to get things done. So hopefully he will learn from mistakes and rectify them in the future.
5 | Russell Simmons | 3 | 10154735521348675_10154737792658675 | Abd if we do win back the Majority in the Senate, Chuck will appoint Bernie Sanders as the next Senate Budget Committee Chair.  How bout them pursestrings? Paul Ryan's already using that "threat" to try to get Republicans to show up on Tuesday, no matter who they write in at the top.  I recommend Snoopy for those who don't feel comfortable voting for our Democratic candidate or either of the other alternative third party candidates who are on the ticket.
6 | John Mitchell | 1 | 10154735521348675_10154738628503675 | This is the only democrat I would vote for.this politician always looking out for the citizen.I see a guy who wants to better conditions across the board
7 | Howard Dyer | 4 | 10154735521348675_10154737857158675 | More of the same with Schumer. Like Pelosi in the House,  he'll constantly pander to the right and screw over his own party if it makes him look good. Just like in the House, Dems will end up losing power with Schumer at the helm and may never get it back. A real tone deaf DINO if I ever saw one.
8 | Bruce Mccoy | 2 | 10154735521348675_10154738307593675 | At least he's understandable, principled, trustworthy (as a New Yorker anyway), and not slimy. Now the Republicans should do the same.
9 | William H Boley | 17 | 10154735521348675_10154737649908675 | The majority in the Senate will determine the politics of the next SCJ selection. Please pay attention, people, and vote on Tuesday.
10 | Margaret Steinhoff | 6 | 10154735521348675_10154738125423675 | I saw this on my newsfeed. I must post this. This is exactly how I feel. Please read and pass on. Dear Mr. Trump,It’s taken me a while to realize this and to admit it, but I’m grateful to you.For the past few months I’ve spent a good deal of time  your campaign and the poison it has so effortlessly generated. I’ve watched our country imploding, our public discourse become polluted, our political climate grows ever more corrosive, and wrongly assumed you were to blame.It’s only lately I’ve come to understand that you haven’t manufactured our current national ugliness—you’ve simply revealed it.By saying the irresponsible, mean-spirited, ignorant things you say so freely and so frequently, you’ve given other like-minded people license to do the same. You’ve opened up the floodgates for our corporate sewage to flow fully. People no longer conceal their vile mess, they now revel in it, they broadcast it and retweet it.You’ve made bigotry and racism socially acceptable again and that has been a kind of twisted gift because it’s allowed me to really see people; not as they pretend to be on the surface—but in the very depths of their wounded, weaponized hearts.Over and over as your campaign has persisted, your supporters would tell me that they like you because you “speak your mind”. It wasn’t until recently that I’ve realized that you speak their minds. You’ve given credence to their prejudices and made those prejudices go mainstream.Thanks to the terrible ground you’ve broken, politicians, pastors, friends, and strangers, both in person and on social media now regularly out themselves as hateful, intolerant, and malicious—and they remind me just how close they are to me, just how deep the sickness in us runs, and just how far we have to go together.You’ve emboldened people to be open about things they used to conceal for the sake of decorum, and though it turns my stomach, I know that this is the only way we can move forward; to have that cancerous stuff exposed fully so that it can be dealt with. Our progress as a nation is predicated on authentic dialogue, no matter how brutal and disheartening that dialogue is.In other words, you’ve let us know what we’re really dealing with here and while it’s been rightly disturbing, it’s also been revelatory. That’s the thing about that kind of harsh light: you’re forced to see everything. Beauty and monstrosity equally illuminated.Now don’t get me wrong, I think you’re the least qualified, least knowledgeable Presidential candidate we may ever have had participate this far into the process, and if you somehow were elected I’d fear gravely for the world my children would inherit—should it survive your Presidency at all. I believe you’re reckless, bitter, and completely reprehensible; the very worst kind of bully.But whether you win or lose, you’ve already allowed me the blessing of Truth; about me, about you, about other candidates, about our nation.And in the process you’ve also shown me that I am not alone in resisting you and this ugly thing you’ve revealed about us.You’ve generated an equally loud, equally passionate response to it and this is where I find my hope these days.I find it in those for whom equality isn’t just a cheap buzzword, it’s the most precious of hills to die on.I find it in those people who refuse to be silent in the face of our impending shared regression.I find it in those willing to be bolder in defending the inherent value of all people.I find it in the growing army of those who will not tolerate hatred as a core American value.I find it in those who reject violence as our default response to dissension.I find it in the ever rising voice of people who will not let malice and bitterness represent them in the world.Today I find my hope in those who, like me, will not be complicit in allowing bigotry and intolerance to become a source of national pride, because we’ve seen where that leads.Yes, Mr Trump, you’ve unearthed our hidden sickness and you’ve allowed it to go viral.You brought every awful thing about us out into the open.You will NEVER Get My Vote!

"It doesn't matter what the friggin' legal and ethics people say, we need to win this motherf****er." He adds, "we're starting anarchy here."Creamer, previously convicted of felony bank fraud, has visited the Obama White House more than 300 times. In one of the videos, he says Hillary Clinton personally knows about the false flag operation. Her campaign "is fully in it," Creamer confirms. "Hillary knows through the chain of command what's going on."

14 | Neil Alan Bufler | 6 | 10154735521348675_10154737798083675 | THE BOMBASITY OF NOPE	This election has exposed the Republican party as NOT the party of ‘values’, which is what they always wanted you to believe. This contest has shown us in many, many ways that they are only interested in being the party of ‘power’. 	Time and time again they have lowered their ‘standards’, to the level of the gutter, just for the taste of partisan ‘power’. They will push the republic to the grave to feed their greed. 	This is a culture brought forth by prebius, boehnar, mconnel and now ryan and comy (Capitalization and correct spelling come with respect) and supported by trimp, pense, murdock, fox news, bribart, hannidy, cruze, limbuagh, oreilly, goudy, chavattz, mcain, roberts and alito. All scared white guys leading the republicon party down the drain, and would take this nation with it due to their shameful partisan greed.	As they watched their little, stupid cousin, the ‘tea party’, shake up the electorate and the Senate, they sat on their hands, assured this might work out well for them. Ha, ha, ha, look how it irritates the Democrats. 	Well, now they’ve got themselves saddled with the greatest embarrassment this country has ever known, trump. This cancer has consumed a great portion of the party and now, no one there has any answers...BECAUSE you gave the friggin' keys to the inmates, idiots. 	George Will just said it best: "This (election) will be chemotherapy for the GOP".	Republicans are not going to change their tune after November 8. That means continuing pointless investigations and Chicken-Little (hannity) scandals. They’re not going to let those attacks on Hillary Clinton they invented to try to defeat her with this election go to waste. All these charges were thoroughly and endlessly investigated and they never, ever found her guilty. There was nothing. There is nothing.	Expect to hear a lot more about all of conjured scandals and probably some new ones as House Republicans use further “investigations” as a way to obstruct and distract from Hillary Clinton’s agenda (or any liberal agenda) and delegitimize her presidency and continue to block the governance of this country. Like a spoiled 2-year old.	The Republican Congress is expanding their demands for a ‘Special Prosecutor’ to investigate the Clinton Foundation for possible conflicts of interest. 	Ryan has promised "aggressive oversight work in the House" from an alleged deal between the FBI and the State Department over reclassifying an email on Clinton's private account.	Republicans in Congress and conservative groups are already publicly calling for Hillary’s impeachment. GOP lawmakers see impeachment [the oversight process] as an opportunity to keep their opponents off-kilter and keep a progressive agenda on the back burner and continue non-governance. 	J. Chaffetz (R), Chair, House Oversight Committee, just said that Republicans are preparing for years of attacks and investigations into Clinton if she wins this election. ”It’s a target rich environment…even before we get to day one, we’ve got two years of material already lined up” 	‘We’ve got document destruction, we’ve got their own rogue system’. “We’ve got ‘classified information’ and damaging information about the Clinton Foundation”. Chaffetz warned Clinton to not bring anyone into her administration that previously worked for her at the State Department, saying “She’s not going to get good reviews from the critics”.	It will start like this, as it always does: Fox News or Breitbart News or maybe even a new network called ‘Trumped Up News’ will come up with an allegation. Nothing more. 	Congressional Republicans will act concerned and outraged. Their/that traditional media will cover that concern and outrage as if there’s substance to it, because you can’t just ignore what House members say, at least not if they’re Republicans. 	So, when two congressional conservatives rub shoulders and tell FBI they have to look into something, these investigators have no choice but to open something, so you now have a ‘FBI Investigation’.  Ahhh, more headlines. House Republicans will hold endless hearings, news releases, and vocal blurbs pointing to those traditional media reports of their own concern and outrage as evidence that there’s something there. They promise that they’ll find it for you and save this Nation.	These hearings and releases will in turn be covered again and again. Congress will want to make sure a large number of Americans—even ones who didn’t hate Clinton will gain the impression of corruption even if there’s never any actual found. You can easily predict that the same thing that’s been going on for years will continue to go on if the same people are in power.	J. McCain (R) just said, when talking about Senate Republicans’ tactics regarding the Supreme Court. “I promise you that we will be united against any Supreme Court nominee that Hillary Clinton, if she were president, would put up,” McCain declared during an interview.  In absolute history, constitutionally, the Presidents right and obligation to appoint a SCOTUS nominee would never be challenged except in case of extremism or qualification. Senators could dissent from these choices but without concrete objection and evidence, are constitutionally required to fill vacancies. This requirement or obligation has seemed to have disappeared. The publics expectation that congress either do it or don’t has simply morphed into ‘we’re not going to talk about it’.	T. Cruz (R) just said that there was ‘precedent’ for a SCOTUS with fewer than nine justices (not true) and “I think there will be plenty of time for debate on that issue”	It is Speaker Ryan’s job to support the Constitutional requirement for the three branches of our government…The President supplies congress with a SCOTUS nominee, the congress accepts or denies this candidate for SCOTUS after open hearings. 	The waiting game is thus: with no accepted nominee (Judge Garland is about as far ‘right’ as any liberal President could offer), SCOTUS is in the most liberal mock-up it has seen in over 50 years, even being deadlocked at 4 to 4. 	The game McCain and other GOP obstructionists play is……… banking on the untimely retirement or the unfortunate illness of one of its older and more liberal members, making SCOTUS again a ‘right’ leaning majority (4 to 3) then congress obstructing any and all nominees for eternity. This is truly a constitutional crime.	A government ‘of the people, by the people’ mandates the ‘people’ do an realistic evaluation of where their country stands, a chore many citizens are no longer capable of, or willing to do. Unfortunately, the facts seem no longer checkable and the truth has been blurred by relentless partisan analysis. 	Even with the threats form Republicans in Congress, this election may take away all their obstructionist vows. A presidential defeat for the right should mean that Republicans would lose control of the Senate, and could mean, with loses in red states, Democrats earn enough votes to regain control of the House of Representatives. 	I’m not sure how this country moves forward but I’m positive how it continues to fall backwards and that is to elect and allow a Congress who’s only product is to defeat the other side, instead of providing solutions for its people.	I can only advise you to, as you elect Hillary, also change Congress with your ballots this week….Vote Responsible, Vote Progressive, Vote Blue, Vote Democratic. Vote. Because, without a change in Congress, there will be no change in Washington.

2 | William Maxwell | 9 | 10154735749333675_10154736279383675 | What PBS failed to point out is that most Hispanics in Miami-Dade are Cuban. They know what it is like to live under a left-wing government because Castro confiscated all their homes farms and businesses in 1959. They will probably be voting for Trump. Most Asian voters are independent thinkers and do not necessarily go along with black America even though they are black.

7 | Margaret Steinhoff | 0 | 10154735749333675_10154738159833675 | I saw this on my newsfeed. I must post this. This is exactly how I feel. Please read and pass on. Dear Mr. Trump,It’s taken me a while to realize this and to admit it, but I’m grateful to you.For the past few months I’ve spent a good deal of time  your campaign and the poison it has so effortlessly generated. I’ve watched our country imploding, our public discourse become polluted, our political climate grows ever more corrosive, and wrongly assumed you were to blame.It’s only lately I’ve come to understand that you haven’t manufactured our current national ugliness—you’ve simply revealed it.By saying the irresponsible, mean-spirited, ignorant things you say so freely and so frequently, you’ve given other like-minded people license to do the same. You’ve opened up the floodgates for our corporate sewage to flow fully. People no longer conceal their vile mess, they now revel in it, they broadcast it and retweet it.You’ve made bigotry and racism socially acceptable again and that has been a kind of twisted gift because it’s allowed me to really see people; not as they pretend to be on the surface—but in the very depths of their wounded, weaponized hearts.Over and over as your campaign has persisted, your supporters would tell me that they like you because you “speak your mind”. It wasn’t until recently that I’ve realized that you speak their minds. You’ve given credence to their prejudices and made those prejudices go mainstream.Thanks to the terrible ground you’ve broken, politicians, pastors, friends, and strangers, both in person and on social media now regularly out themselves as hateful, intolerant, and malicious—and they remind me just how close they are to me, just how deep the sickness in us runs, and just how far we have to go together.You’ve emboldened people to be open about things they used to conceal for the sake of decorum, and though it turns my stomach, I know that this is the only way we can move forward; to have that cancerous stuff exposed fully so that it can be dealt with. Our progress as a nation is predicated on authentic dialogue, no matter how brutal and disheartening that dialogue is.In other words, you’ve let us know what we’re really dealing with here and while it’s been rightly disturbing, it’s also been revelatory. That’s the thing about that kind of harsh light: you’re forced to see everything. Beauty and monstrosity equally illuminated.Now don’t get me wrong, I think you’re the least qualified, least knowledgeable Presidential candidate we may ever have had participate this far into the process, and if you somehow were elected I’d fear gravely for the world my children would inherit—should it survive your Presidency at all. I believe you’re reckless, bitter, and completely reprehensible; the very worst kind of bully.But whether you win or lose, you’ve already allowed me the blessing of Truth; about me, about you, about other candidates, about our nation.And in the process you’ve also shown me that I am not alone in resisting you and this ugly thing you’ve revealed about us.You’ve generated an equally loud, equally passionate response to it and this is where I find my hope these days.I find it in those for whom equality isn’t just a cheap buzzword, it’s the most precious of hills to die on.I find it in those people who refuse to be silent in the face of our impending shared regression.I find it in those willing to be bolder in defending the inherent value of all people.I find it in the growing army of those who will not tolerate hatred as a core American value.I find it in those who reject violence as our default response to dissension.I find it in the ever rising voice of people who will not let malice and bitterness represent them in the world.Today I find my hope in those who, like me, will not be complicit in allowing bigotry and intolerance to become a source of national pride, because we’ve seen where that leads.Yes, Mr Trump, you’ve unearthed our hidden sickness and you’ve allowed it to go viral.You brought every awful thing about us out into the open.You will NEVER Get My Vote!

18 | Mur Bally | 1 | 10154735749333675_10154738793043675 | Investigation of Corrupt Clinton Wall Bangers Part 9Angela RyeAfter close examination on Prayers for Dallas Police Officer's that were fallen. It is surprising that CNN didn't call for immediate resignation or employment of Angela Rye on CNN! Here is the heinous, awful, awful rhetoric below:"Petition to have Angela Rye Removed from CNN""Tonight on CNN's Anderson Cooper program, "political analyst" Angela Rye made the inflammatory statement that "police are shooting black people for sport".  This on the heels of several controversial officer-involved shootings, and the night after the murder of 5 Dallas police officers by someone who was angry about the recent shootings.  Her appearance on the segment was hostile, rude, divisive, and her statement was guaranteed to fuel the fires of racism and violence that are a major crisis in our country right now.  Thankfully another guest on the program immediately replied that that was the most offensive thing he had ever heard on the network, and the host, who was clearly appalled as well, immediately tried to interject.  But the damage was done.  I second the opinion that it was the most offensive thing I've ever heard on CNN, and would take that a step further to say it's probably one of the most offensive things I've ever heard on TV.  Ms. Rye should be ashamed to make such a statement at any time, and so much moreso when so many police officers were just hurt and killed in the Dallas ambush.  But I did some research on her, and was shocked and horrified to find that Ms. Rye is not some independent activist invited on for the night...she is a paid employee of CNN and regularly makes such inflammatory appearances.  She also is a guest on NPR and many other shows and networks.  I'm appalled that she has such a large platform with which to spread such a hateful agenda.  I would ask most importantly for CNN to immediately remove Ms. Rye from the program, review her statements, and then terminate her employment.  I would also ask that CNN release a statement condemning her comments, and that Ms. Rye issue an apology for making such a dangerous and obviously false statement on national television.  We need speakers on TV who are working to calm the situation down and advocate peace and moderation and working together.  Ms. Rye clearly is an awful person with the worst agenda, and she needs to be removed from her platform before she can further damage this great country with her hateful speech."Taken from an excerpt of a petition to have her removed. By: Troy Dillon:Here are some quotes, of 52 people; that have signed for her to be removed."Our country needs healing. We do not need major media outlets supporting people who use inflammatory statements intended to keep anger flowing. Angela Rye's rhetoric can only encourage more violence." Nancy Forston, Red Oak, Texas"This is getting absolutely out of hand, hate only breeds hate."Jacob Barnard, Chandler, AZ4 months ago(Listing many more.)Is this Angela Rye show a Commentator, that we should be listening to on her evaluation's of Mr. D. J. Trump!JOIN THE MOVEMENT OVER THE BARRICADES OF THE WASHINGTON ESTABLISHMENT! TRUMP 2016

It is hard to tell how he can come on TV at CNN every night disgracing D. J. Trump when he himself committed such a disposable act! What was he showing the States teens for an example as their peer, Donald is stepping in as a Steward to the young of America. Not as this example as we see in this article:Evidence reason Bakari Sellers' DUI charge droppedLaDonna BeekerApr 8, 2013 05:16 PMCHESTER COUNTY, SC (WIS) - Evidence in a state representative's driving under the influence case allowed him to plea to a lesser charge.    State Rep. Bakari Sellers was charged with DUI on Oct. 7 when he was traveling north on Interstate 77 just after 1 a.m. from a South Carolina football game, where he admitted to deputies he was drinking alcohol. Sellers refused a breath test, resulting in an automatic six-month driver's license suspension. His license was reinstated in February by a judicial panel.However, Sellers will not see any more consequences from the DUI charge because video surveillance from the deputy's patrol car did not match the date on Sellers' ticket. Because the evidence did not flow, it could not hold up in court.Sellers was allowed to plead guilty to reckless driving and pay a $475 fine. Court documents show he signed an affidavit April 1 acknowledging his guilt to the lesser charge."I am very pleased to have been cleared of all alcohol-related charges from my traffic stop in Chester County last fall," Sellers said in a statement released Friday.He takes "full responsibility" for his actions and admitted he was too tired to drive."I apologize and will do my best to set a better example for our youth and to continue to move South Carolina forward," Sellers said." I don't think he should explain properness when he is so drunk with words against a person that stands for America! As unbelievably, there is shocking videos on the net of his DUI arrest! TRUMP 2016
