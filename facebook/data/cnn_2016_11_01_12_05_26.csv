The students hoped to show how affirmative action "demeans minorities on our campus by placing labels of race and gender on their accomplishments."

2 | Mohamed Yusuf | 0 | 10155540954226509_10155540976081509 | If the white people had treated them without discrimination in the first place it will not had been necessary they can only thank them self and by the way how petty this people are they have all opportunities in life yet tries to close doors for others.

15 | Jay Ram | 0 | 10155540954226509_10155540975816509 | CNN needs to be charged with race baiting and intentionally inciting violence towards police officers resulting in death. Every police shooting this summer CNN's reporters claimed was a "act of racism towards an unarmed innocent victim". Every time they claimed they had "undeniable evidence that the shooting was racially motivated." 2 days later the cops debunked CNN's ridiculous lies every time. CNN will be facing criminal charges when this election is over.

Was it her mind then representing the little fish freely wandering outside the wire fences or was it the fish representing the people of Myanmar who wishes to be free from Junta’s ruling.

Corporate greed and the potential for an environmental disaster are two arguments against the Dakota Access Pipeline. But the more complicated issue challenging Western sensibilities is about threats to sacred land. http://cnn.it/2fr0u38
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Hughard Wind Mill | 37 | 10155540619521509_10155540718476509 | So its important to keep this "sacred ground" to protect religious freedom but you want to force certain bakeries to go against their beliefs because you say religious freedom doesn't apply there? Hmmmm, ok.Oh, and BTW, the pipeline is being built on private property.
2 | Donna Metcalf Pittman | 16 | 10155540619521509_10155540791771509 | Canadian pipeline thru sacred ground and potential and likelihood of destroying major water source for several states around the area, just to transport and remove oil to be shipped to China!    Not very smart for America, regardless of where it's running!
3 | Adriaan van Wyk | 16 | 10155540619521509_10155540777921509 | Gas prices are at an all time low, everything is working fine, everyone is doing ok. Cars and trucks are on the road. So why do we need this pipeline. People, oil is not the future. Oil has destroyed countries. It's time for oil to go.
4 | Carlo Grandinetti | 6 | 10155540619521509_10155540909146509 | One day in the future we are going to look back on this day and be so ashamed. Ashamed how we forced these people to give up the rest of what little land they have to make way for some disgusting dirty oil pipeline. The government refuses to find clean alternative energy and doesn't care about their culture or plight. Trespassing ? It's their land!! Just like history shows: America murdered and stole the land from the indigenous people. I suggest you go back to school and check your history on President Andrew Jackson's Indian Removal policy, which witnessed thousands of Indians murdered.....
5 | Ricardo J Rademacher | 12 | 10155540619521509_10155540722841509 | This is nothing more than a typical "not in my backyard" argument using the "sacred land" trump card.They want it moved so that it can affect Bismark (pop: 70K, pop density: 2000 people per square mile)but not affect the reservation(pop: 8k pop density: 2 people per square mile).So their argument is the burial grounds of people you don't remember...... is more important than the lives of 70k people that are alive...or... that the 8k people on the reservation are somehow more important than the 70k people of bismark?
6 | Michael Pack | 5 | 10155540619521509_10155540696816509 | I remember the hell they went through with Poltergeist when they built that sub-division on Indian burial grounds. Hope not the case here. PS they make the best chicken lung stew around.
7 | Kurt Giese | 7 | 10155540619521509_10155540719081509 | Later they will be crying that they don't have oil to heat their homes and gas prices are too high to drive to the new protest locations.
8 | Dustin Pease | 3 | 10155540619521509_10155540750971509 | The protests are all funded by Warren Buffet! Because of the pipelines there's no need to transport oil on trains and that's taking money out of his pockets. Know the facts people!!
9 | Adriaan van Wyk | 2 | 10155540619521509_10155540810601509 | Every one who opposes the protest must have investments in oil. Oil is not the future. Oil has to go. It destroys everything. Countries, people die. Pollution. Ocean life destroyed. Oil has to go. It's time.

20 | Andrew Steele | 2 | 10155540619521509_10155540779331509 | Ha! The Standing Rock Tribalmembers are for greed, not the corporate! They held out for more money and when DAPL went with private lands they got pissed. Everything they brought up has been debunked. Water, debunked. Sacred land, debunked. Burial grounds, debunked. Treaty land, debunked. If anyone wants to quote the treaty of 1851 it shouldn't be them. DAPL followed the treaty, you can't negotiate a deal without a a consensus and Standing Rock has backed out/not shown up/canceled meetings.No the greed is from them.And people wonder why my ancestors called them Little Snake.
21 | Rhonda Manley | 0 | 10155540619521509_10155540936056509 | This is just not right!!!! Leave these people and their land alone. This needs stopped!!!!!!!! Build the pip lines on the oil barrens back yard or whoever is for this. Just awful!!!!!!
22 | Sandy Cox | 1 | 10155540619521509_10155540877986509 | its only complicated if your non native...to make it easily understandable to non natives...how would you feel if someone took a bulldozer and dug up your great grandfathers families graves to put an oil pipeling in...didnt ask you or tell you you had time to relocate the cemetary or anything.
23 | Marion Wright | 1 | 10155540619521509_10155540865611509 | So I still have friends on my page liking and sharing these anti-pipeline articles and memes.  If you don't pipeline for a living, and you're not from North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa, or Illinois then you should really stay out of this conversation, especially if you're just going to keep sharing the same lies over and over. I know everyone is entitled to their opinion, but this is not about opinions, it's about facts, and the facts are; the Dakota access pipeline DOES NOT cross the Standing Rock reservation, it DOES have all the necessary permits and approvals, and it is NOT disturbing any burial grounds This information is easily accessible online with a quick Google search, in case you don't have time to research the lies you're sharing. And here are the links showing they have the permits, and that North Dakota's top archeologists surveyed these sites and found nothing. http://m.bismarcktribune.com/news/opinion/guest/all-eyes-on-north-dakota-full-story-isn-t-being/article_5dc1e955-fd71-5003-86be-0fa0f29d7fbc.html    http://m.kcci.com/news/archaeologist-no-human-remains-found-at-pipeline-site/41226410And before you start in about possible water contamination, that's just another scare tactic. The Missouri river will be directionally drilled and the pipeline will have the latest technologies and monitoring systems to help prevent releases and will be constructed 90 feet below the riverbed to ensure nothing may reach the river — far above and beyond what’s required by federal regulations.Don't be fooled, the battle right now may be against this pipeline, but the war is on oil. I know some of you hate oil (even though you consume as much as the rest of us on a daily basis) but there simply is not enough renewable energy to meet the current demand, so this oil WILL be brought to market one way or another, and the safest way is via pipeline. They have a smaller carbon footprint and are 4.5 times less likely to cause a spill than trains. It's an easy choice. So don't tell me you're against pipelines because you care about the environment, because the two ideas are contradictory.With that being said, I will not hold back any longer, if you've got the nerve to post these lies, I will call you out on it, so you better do your research before you chime in on something that you know nothing about. It's not about corporate greed it's Indian greed. This pipeline does not come on Indian land. It was rerouted cause the Indians wanted to much money. Now they are pissed they are missing out in a payday.
24 | Alan Lessner | 3 | 10155540619521509_10155540788111509 | What CNN no anti trump garbage. Can't spin your way out of this last Hillary mess. Actual news for once. Sorry too little too late. Hope Trump bars CNN from press briefings
25 | Zachary Ryan Louis Hackett | 0 | 10155540619521509_10155540836396509 | The officials saying that the pipeline is not on Native American land.  Is exactly like an organic farmer losing his licensing because his neighbor grows GMO's because the cross pollination will contaminate their crops.On top of a violation of the oath every officer swore to protect the people from threats foreign, domestic, including our own government.

3 | Amir Parvez | 33 | 10155540517316509_10155540567296509 | Hillary Clinton is a threat to American Democracy (what's left of it) and world peace. A vote for her is a vote for worldwide economic slavery and evil, endless war! She's a corrupt, evil, lying warmonger who already has blood on her hands of thousands of people and millions of dollars of blood money in the Clinton Foundation. #NeverHillary
4 | Marcia Makoviecki | 13 | 10155540517316509_10155540594066509 | The only one on CNN who speaks the truth is Tom Fuentes, former FBI guy.   As soon as he's done telling what's REALLY going on, they shut him down and move on to someone blaming Russia.  Ridiculous.
5 | Phil Hominid Ward | 28 | 10155540517316509_10155540612971509 | When the Donald Trump in this video says that Donald Trump rejected the head shaving for cancer research, I notice that he clearly goes on to say more which has been cut off. I wonder why? Did he go on to say that, while Trump wouldn't shave his head he donated a load of money to cancer research?See CNN, this is why no one trusts you. It's so clear the guy went on to say more. Whether a good or bad remark followed should be irrelevant and when you make such obvious edits, it does leave a lot of questions unanswered while generating many more.

If, a Republican wins, we all have to get things done! We have to not vote for anyone who presents a challenge to out "Democratic" method of governing! If we have Congresspeople out there saying we will block everything, they need to be voted out, regardless of Party. We have to stop this idiotic hatred that has somehow gotten into our elective politic. If we allow these hate paeople to influence our voting, either way, we are going to really suffer four more years of stagnation. Our children will not have better schools, our health care will continue to erode and there will be fewer jobs out there for everyone. Our system is not perfect, but that was set up that way because the founders wanted to insure different arguments were presented and not just one from a King or Dictator. A break from our propogandized positions is needed right now! If someone says Corporations will help us so we need to listen to them, reject that! There never has been nor will there ever be, a corporation to help people! We need to vote for the person, whether for President or Congress, who will give people first legislation! It is time for change! If not now, then it could mean never?

5 | Niesha Honani | 4 | 10155540467451509_10155540683526509 | I'm pretty sure CNN since you been on the DAPL nut to smear the protectors - this story was meant to emphasize the need but this explosion only proves the point of how dangerous this is. There was a leak prior to explosion. Real energy independence relies on making cost efficient and gas efficient cars which has been possible since the 50s but thanks to the car industry and oil industry was killed. Real infrastructure like public transport and less waste needs to be the focus - it's not that hard. CNN you used to be my favorite news source but you've shown your true colors so we are breaking up. The damage is done.

I say Donald Trump is strong.. when everyone left by his side, and the polls were showing double digit lead of Hillary, he remained focussed and now even the rigged media claims that he is winning. That means he will win a landslide. #Trump

5 | Ben Derrick | 310 | 10155540244781509_10155540252851509 | I'm sick and tired of those who say Hillary has no great accomplishments. I would say staying out of prison for the crimes she committed in the last four decades is an great accomplishment. Can't trust crooked Hillary for a second. #Trump2016
6 | Janelle Marie | 141 | 10155540244781509_10155540275726509 | Just when I thought I might develop some respect for Paul Ryan for how he has publicly stated how offensive the Republican nominee is....he goes and votes for him. Often times the right thing to do might not be the popular thing, but by having courage to do the right thing you become the example. Paul Ryan you had the opportunity, you are one of the most influential Republicans and yet you are blindly backing a man who if elected will bring down your party and set our country back in time 100 years with his prejudices, racist behavior and sexist ideology. You should be ashamed.
7 | William Knightley | 167 | 10155540244781509_10155540249396509 | Paul Ryan is the biggest clown in US government. How he became Speaker is beyond me.
8 | Terrence Lucus | 81 | 10155540244781509_10155540252901509 | Ryan has got his eye on 2020...where he is going to have to clean up the diarrhea Trump has left all over the GOP brand...the clean up starts Nov 9
9 | Don Anthony Ferdinand | 54 | 10155540244781509_10155540322486509 | He said he voted for the entire Republican ticket. Anyone who votes straight up and down the line is a fool. You have to look at policies of each candidate individually. You're an American before you're a Rep or Dem.
10 | Paul Sung | 24 | 10155540244781509_10155540285511509 | Paul Ryan is a good man. Donald is guy you can approach and he pay attention to the common man. He love team work. Together America will be great.
11 | Rebecca Savastio | 9 | 10155540244781509_10155540392406509 | Hey there. How about covering the story regarding Trump Organization servers communicating with a Russian bank and the allegation he has been cultivating a relationship with Russia for the last five years? Also his upcoming child rape hearing, and fraud and racketeering re Trump University are pretty important stories too.
12 | Dolly Bailie | 14 | 10155540244781509_1681730085452282 | Paul Ryan is a traitor of our country voting for Trump when he knows the ties Trump has with Russia. He knows the court cases Trump is facing. He has supported a very mentally ill narcissistic conman, for what? Not the good of the country, but for the party. Sad
13 | Suzanne McDonald Mondoux | 7 | 10155540244781509_1681726695452621 | I'm confused....How can it be more threatening to have someone openly accept their wrong with respect to an email breach OVER someone who has: -a history and present day issue with sexual abuse-harassment, -avoids paying taxes like regular folks (is this not illegal?)-has an obvious disrespect of females as well as some of his fellow Americans who are of a different cultural background-has an obvious lack of tolerance for other countries and their culture -and generally shows the egotistical, sometimes thoughtless behaviour of a 6yr old
14 | Dolores Roles | 4 | 10155540244781509_1804474939808867 | I can't believe the flip flop stance of Paul Ryan. As a lifelong Republican I used to like him. How can he support someone as woefully unprepared to be President of this country? So disappointed.
15 | Manuel Casey | 5 | 10155540244781509_10155540390216509 | The legacy of dad to his son Donald many years ago: you do not need to know anything, you only need two things. A lot of money and... "All people have a price." Gave him a lot of money... and buy and bribe, your motto is. Greetings CNN.
16 | Salako Isaac | 6 | 10155540244781509_556061081265476 | Paul Ryan and Mike Pence both fall in thesame basket. They are hypocrites of the highest level. Everything they stand for is Donald Trump. The only difference between Trump and them is their approach,  Trump is direct and straight in his stupidity while they are systemic but at the end of the day, they all have thesame converging point.
17 | Michael Glazier | 9 | 10155540244781509_10155540256746509 | That's good I would rather see a Republican vote for a republican then show no loyalty to your party regardless of what person is currently on the top of the pile
18 | Rusty Sweeney | 10 | 10155540244781509_10155540350021509 | It is amazing that some Americans would consider Hillary Clinton to be their President. She has lied to the American people, to Congress, the FBI, the DOJ, and the media, she has mishandled classified information, she has operated pay to play schemes in which she personally profited from government business, she has pocketed tax payers money through the uranium deal with Russia and the recent deal with Morocco, she has pocketed relief funds promised to Haiti, she has funded the Colombian cartels in the slaughtering of people, she has defended rapists, she has threatened the women that came forward in accusing her husband for raping them, her husband (the possible 1st lady) has been accused of raping women, he was impeached from his presidency over scandalous acts towards interns within the White House, and she is currently under FBI investigation.
19 | Marie Wellens | 2 | 10155540244781509_556056551265929 | This man is nothing short of a flip flop turn coat and only cares about keeping his stinking job and not about the people of this country and what's good for them. Ever since Trump has been running the GOP has been in a feud with themselves. The party's a mess , they are forever doing & undoing their support for Trump. That is a perfect example of what will happen if he gets elected, and it's because there are too many republicans in the government.
20 | Marilyn Cates | 7 | 10155540244781509_556053444599573 | As a reg.democrat and a woman I will be voting Trump.I would not vote for a woman like Hillary.To me she is a disgrace as a woman,leader,and the democratic party.She is a threat to national security,and when she messes up her answer is to attack someone else,or to say i don't remember.Well I don't want someone who has excuses for all she has done.
21 | Louis Griffin | 3 | 10155540244781509_1804472046475823 | Paul Ryan promised to “fix” a broken House of Representatives but that didn’t happen. The House of Representatives remains dysfunctional and unproductive as before. two of the worst Speakers of the House in American History via John Boehner and Paul Ryan.Republicans say government doesn't work; then they get elected and prove it.
22 | Jace Miller | 9 | 10155540244781509_10155540340356509 | Way to ruin you future! What a total loser! Absolutely indefensible. Voting for someone just because they say they are conservative and a Republican! The entire GOP is full of disgusting hypocrites!
23 | Ellen Leonard | 6 | 10155540244781509_1681724998786124 | I used to have some respect for Ryan. Not any more because there are plenty of Republican leaders who realize that Trump is not the answer for the party and is a terrible person to lead this country and are refusing to vote for him. They have the gonads to say no. Ryan has proved he is a weak lemming.
24 | Todd Andress | 3 | 10155540244781509_10155540389896509 | It's amazing how much damage one person can do if that person is tempermentally unfit and extremely unqualified to be president of the United States.....Donald Trump is a clown but there's nothing funny about what he's done to the Republican party!
25 | Kathy Tirado | 1 | 10155540244781509_556066071264977 | He has no integrity. Donald trump has two major cases that are coming up on November 28th dealing with fraud for trump university and one in December dealing with rape.of a 13yr old. How do this not disqualify trump to be president? Paul Ryan regardless of.what political party you are, you have no integrity for yourself!!!!!

Now we know that folks at CNN are working directly with and directly for the Clinton campaign.  The collusion is 'deplorable" and reeks of corruption!  Anyone that still thinks that CNN is an honest, reliable source for news, needs their head examined OR they are obviously okay with the LYING!
2 | Jude David | 323 | 10155540136531509_10155540148061509 | CNN is as corrupt as Hillary Clinton! The system is rigged and rigged by CNN! Why aren't you covering how one of your staffers fed questions to Hillary prior to a debate? Why are you using Hillary's newest email scandal as a way to question Comeys integrity? You are so one sided it makes me sick! I used to watch CNN all the time not anymore!
3 | Charmaine Morales Nick | 137 | 10155540136531509_10155540149601509 | If you are still planning on voting Hillary at this point, you have sacrificed all your Morals. This is Hillary's fault cut and dry,however in a party who does not know how to take responsibility for anything,why should this surprise anyone!
4 | Charlie Ragusa | 150 | 10155540136531509_10155540146101509 | Go Trump! Make America Great Again!  Trump gaining fast! The only thing going down faster than Hillary is CNN's credibility.

6 | Gene Furrow | 56 | 10155540136531509_10155540215326509 | Donna Brazil was a CNN hack!!! Don't be fooled - there are hundreds more just like her working at CNN - What a disgraceful tabloid CNN has now become. Wouldn't watch that trash now!!!!
7 | Brian Shales | 47 | 10155540136531509_10155540167051509 | Why did Hillary accept those questions in advance of the town hall instead of turning them down and firing her corrupt aide on the spot? No morals or values? Just because you can cheat doesn't mean you have to.
8 | Todd Snarr | 27 | 10155540136531509_10155540159846509 | I can say, being the owner of my S-Corp accounting business, there are many other businesses in Our Country who are in debt with regards to all of the taxation, (i.e. federal, state & local taxes) along with all of the many of federal, state & local regulation costs involved which any business has to pay to meet the many of regulations out there for all.Then,When you top it off with a sour poor economy, if the revenue is not coming into the businesses, where the businesses are having to pay all different kinds of business operating expenses, then the businesses will trend to show a loss.This loss is what we call the net operating loss and just like Trump back in 1995, there are many other businesses who have net operating losses. These net operating losses can either be chosen to carry back 3 or 5 years to offset revenue and then carry-forward for up to 20 years to offset revenue to absorb the loss or choose to waive the carry back and just carry forward for the next 20 years to offset revenue and absorb the loss.Many businesses have net operating losses and it is most frequent when Our Country is having a sour & poor economy and when I have been seeing this trend with many business clients I have, I can tell you that truthfully Obama, Hilary Clinton, Democrat Politicians and these liberal news stations (i.e. CNN & MSNBC) have been deceiving & lying to the American People.With regards to bankruptcy, Donald Trump did not file Chapter 7 to wipe away all debt. Donald Trump filed Chapter 11 to reorganize his debt due to a sour & poor economy. There are many other businesses from within Our Country who file Chapter 11 so it's not just Donald Trump.See,These are the things that Obama, Hilary Clinton, Democrat Politicians and these liberal news stations (i.e. CNN & MSNBC) do not want to share with the American People because their intentions are to deceive, mislead & lie to the American People.Frankly,Our Country's economy really does stink and by no means is our economy performing well and this is where we have the "Business-As-Usual" for the past several years.Scary,How in the past 8 years Our Country's Debt has more than doubled under the "Failed" policies of a "Divided" Country led by Obama who leads to "Divide" rather than to "Unite". From this, I say Obama is more of a "Protestor" Organizer rather than the Leader of Our Great Country.Last,When Our Country is facing a sour & poor economy where businesses are struggling to survive to operate where I see the trends of more net operating losses and Chapter 11 filings from many businesses, one of the first business operating expenses cut by most businesses is the payroll expenses by either laying off employees and/or cutting or reducing pay for employees along with eliminating some of the employer/employee benefits employers offer to their employees.And yes,Obama is correct, unemployment rate has decreased and this is only because the people's benefits have ran out with time where the people are not eligible for additional benefits. But then, many people in Our Country are working part-time jobs along with multiple jobs at the same time.But,Obama, Hilary Clinton, Democrat Politicians and these liberal news stations (i.e. CNN & MSNBC) all fail to show the significant increase in Our Country's Peoples applying for and receiving all kinds of welfare benefits.Ponder to yourself,Why will they not talk about the significant increase in welfare recipients?Why is it they don't want to say how terrible Our Country's economy is struggling to survive?Why is it will they not talk about the many of People in Our Great Country having to work more & more many different part-time jobs at the same time or many people's pay & employer-provided benefits have been cut or reduced?Ya Know People,I share the truthful trends I see on a daily basis where I have no intentions to mislead, deceive or lie. I am not a "Racist" or a "Sexist" person by any means, but Obama is by far the worst President Our Country has ever had and Hilary Clinton, by her prior years actions & words, I can't believe anything she says or doesn't say. Also, I will share I was very unhappy with George Bush Jr as well in his 2nd term of office.But,For the "Real" Change for the "Better" of Our Country,Donald Trump is not an evil person, where I don't agree with everything Donald Trump speaks about, but I do agree with most everything Donald Trump speaks about.Donald Trump will get my vote for the "Real" Change for the "Better" of Our Country.

12 | Shane Scott Ford | 9 | 10155540136531509_10155540202071509 | This country needs Hillary Clinton to win. We need open borders and millions of undocumented immigrants. We need to be racially divided. The police need to be regulated by citizens. We need to raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour. We need to raise taxes on businesses and the wealthy. We need to be hacked. We need classified information to become public. Children need to be taught that blacks lives matter more and that the police are evil. We need to ban guns. We need to have government run healthcare. We need to continue to pay for other nations. We need to support Iran. We need to let North Korea get away with everything. We need our youth to understand that straight white conservatives are evil and ignorant. We need to allow full term abortion. We need to focus on weakening our military. We need to collapse. The only way we can recover is to start over from ground zero. The pathway towards a collapse is to elect Hillary Clinton. If you vote Hillary, you are voting for our collapse. Democrats are a dirty filthy nasty group of liars and cheats. The emails and videos are 100% proof to how they operate. Hillary Clinton could murder someone on live tv and still win the election. The Bill Clinton rape tape could be released and the media would still only care about a private Trump conversation. This election is 100% rigged. The media needs to be controlled and regulated immediately. We need Hillary to win. We need a reality check. We are the old building that needs to be demolished for the new and improved one. You can't rebuild what is broken in this country. Hillary Clinton is going to be president and we get a front row seat to the fall of our nation.
13 | Kevin Durrell | 4 | 10155540136531509_10155540234141509 | The real fact is Trump doesn't become a good fit for the job by making Hillary look bad. Trump has lashed out with personal attacks at members of the media, made fun of the disabled, made racist comments, bragged about sexually assaulting women. He is unfit for the job and if anything happened to make Hillary unfit for the job Tim Cain would still be better then Donald Trump.

If you are against Obama, you are automatically racist.  It has nothing to do with his policies or personal opinions.  Now IF she gets elected, anyone who disagrees with her will automatically be labeled sexist.  It has nothing to do with her policies or personal opinions......

How Bernie can say with a straight face to his supporters to vote for the system that is not red handed caught trying to smear and now giving Hillary heads up questions in debates against Bernie?? And Donna Brazil's reward for all this?? Appointed head of the DNC when their corrupt chair had to resign for cheating Bernie Sanders. Who are the deplorables again???"In a statement, CNN said it was "completely uncomfortable with what we have learned about her interactions with the Clinton campaign while she was a CNN contributor."

Hillary is going to win, I have no doubt....but she and Bill need to be watched. Every favor, every contract needs to be handled by a 3rd party. I don't trust the Clintons.

5 | Michael Amanor | 5 | 10155540044341509_10155540089351509 | My thoughts and prayers go to the victims and their families. You all be safe out there. New month, new beginnings and also, new dangers out there so be safe.
6 | Jody Jordan | 4 | 10155540044341509_10155540158416509 | Bus crashes seem to be happening more and more. Can it be required if not on some already, but to have seat belts? I wish it every day for school buses
7 | Anhtuan Trinh | 10 | 10155540044341509_10155540092166509 | I think they crash because there's a grave yard from the hand side. I believe in ghosts and spirits would causes it. It gotta be...either that or i've watched too many horror movies.
8 | Barbara Robinson | 2 | 10155540044341509_10155540157426509 | (Thoughts and prayers for the loved ones who are mourning and the injured) If some parents are the best example that kids have growing up today, then it's no wonder society is at an all-time low. These septic comments at a tragedy are unnecessary.
9 | Randall Green | 2 | 10155540044341509_10155540557596509 | Buses aren't designed to crumple! They're not cars but a rigid vehicle. People carry on about seatbelts but when 2 big vehicles like this collide almost head on, seatbelts are useless
10 | Greg Merrick | 1 | 10155540044341509_10155540188971509 | Encourage your school officials to stay atop of their transportation people to be vigilant on the routine maintenance of the buses they use to transport  our children. And routinely monitor their drivers. Too many of the driver's should not be allowed to transport our children. Not to say that this is a case that could have prevented this. But there are too many cases where, either a mechanical error or the driver's error could have prevented tragedies like this from happening.
11 | Allison Foias | 1 | 10155540044341509_10155540256016509 | This is very sad, why do some people think the electoral candidates have anything to do with it? Like vote for this person and you will suddenly be a bad driver? My thoughts go out to the poor families, this is just an awful tragedy.
12 | Jerry Brown | 6 | 10155540044341509_10155540215381509 | May God bless there souls but CNN is the most lying, bias, disgusting media network in the universe. I actually know people who were previous employed there who said they would severely manipulate news film through editing and at times cover stories which were actually staged and recorded on movie sets... These people are working with the Devil!
13 | Srun Chey | 0 | 10155540044341509_10155540538801509 | This is scary to think about if kids were on the bus. I think school buses still don't have seat belts. Prayers to the families.
14 | Thom Roberts | 0 | 10155540044341509_10155540193646509 | Busing Children is a bad thing. Are school buses required to have seat belts? This country needs neighborhood schools that are second to none. Lets stop building nuclear weapons, nuclear power plants and the like and build schools.
15 | Caroline Clarkson Drake | 1 | 10155540044341509_10155540071246509 | I have just noticed that this awful accident has taken place and my thoughts and prayers are with those injured and I am prayingfor the families who have lost loved ones in this accident.

18 | Toby Gaither | 1 | 10155540044341509_10155540576686509 | Why aren't you covering how one of your staffers fed questions to Hillary prior to a debate? Why are you using Hillary's newest email scandal as a way to question Comeys integrity? You are so one sided it makes me sick! I used to watch CNN all the time not anymore!
19 | Novak Mary | 0 | 10155540044341509_10155540923436509 | Thoughts and prayers for those injured and for the families of those who lost their lives... May their souls Rest in Peace !  😇🎈🙏
20 | Anne Ross Knoeller | 3 | 10155540044341509_10155540095731509 | So sad im in Baltimore saw this on local  morning news praying for all involved.
21 | Dee Adams | 0 | 10155540044341509_10155540865341509 | So sad for the families! But is it necessary for the media to show the cemetery also, it makes it look spooky or supernatural related!
22 | Ken Knecht | 1 | 10155540044341509_10155540544556509 | So is anyone at the Clinton News Network going to find out who at CNN gave Brazile the quesitons prior to the debate or are you going to just sweep it under the rug like everything else. And why hasn't anyone asked Hillary why she didn't report this dishonest, immoral, and fraudulent act. If Killary had an ounce of integrity she would have reported Brazile immediately when she gave her the questions. Your not a news organization, your a political hack but I'm guessing that's nothing new. There are millions of messages all over social media letting you know that.
23 | Salita Latson | 0 | 10155540044341509_10155540659916509 | Meanwhile...The man that wants to be president can't be trusted with our daughtersDonald Trump has a preliminary hearing on 12/16/2016 at 10 am in front of judge Ronnie Abrams at Manhattan federal court house the second time he's been charged with rape this time against a 13year old child. Child Rape...Case 1:16-CV-04642 US District Court Southern District of New York. Also is the same man that sat on Howard Stern and talked about the size of his own daughter's breast with another man she was only 21 years old he also let Howard Stern call his daughter a nice piece of A** ..... I don't know any fathers that would discuss their daughter that way and we won't even talk about him admitting he likes to grab women by the pussyI will take EMAILS anyday
24 | Miguel Sanchez | 20 | 10155540044341509_10155540055066509 | No offense, but it's kinda scary the crash happened next to a GRAVEYARD
25 | Joseph Loreti Sr. | 0 | 10155540044341509_10155540719331509 | Wow.................. CNN is a FRAUD for sure!  Now we know that folks at CNN are working directly with and directly for the Clinton campaign.  The collusion is 'deplorable" and reeks of corruption!  Anyone that still thinks that CNN is an honest, reliable source for news, needs their head examined OR they are obviously okay with the LYING!

JUST IN: Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton are neck-and-neck (46%-45%) in a new national tracking poll out today
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Chris Scholl | 1291 | 10155539966656509_10155539976556509 | I really want to trust what CNN says I really do but I lost faith in this network with their obvious bias towards Hillary Clinton. Just like I can't trust FOX news for their own bias towards Donald Trump...what can I trust in the media anymore...
2 | Darnell Jordan | 1075 | 10155539966656509_10155539984341509 | CNN, you have lost all credibility as an impartial news organization now that America knows your staffers passed on questions to Hillary prior to the debate. Shame on yourself!
3 | Jeff Hanson | 578 | 10155539966656509_10155539976316509 | She belongs in Federal Prison!!Only the  ignorant can support this profoundly corrupt woman! She Belongs in Federal Prison already!!The 25 things that are truly important about Hillary instead of this left wing fluff:1. When did she know her husband was a serial abuser, and does she feel guilty for destroying his accusers?2. Explain precisely the trades made in the Cattle Futures scandal where $1,000 was turned into $99,000 in a matter of weeks?3. Why didn't she do anything to protect the Americans in Benghazi?4. Who is Saul Alinsky and why was he her mentor?5. When she was working on Watergate, why did her boss Zeifman, a lifelong Democrat, call Hillary a “liar” and “an unethical, dishonest lawyer” and have her fired?6. What really happened with Travelgate?7. What really happened with the Rose Law Firm?8. What really happened with WhiteWater?9. What gave Hillary the right to see private FBI files of her political enemies in FileGate?10. Why won't she turn over her illegal server with state department e-mails to congress?11. Why does your foundation accept money from avowed terror states?12. What is her take on the Vince Foster "Suicide"?13. Why did she think she was entitled to steal the White House furniture when she left?14. Why do you lie even about things that mean nothing: lying about being under sniper fire in Bosnia, lying about being named after Sir Edmund Hillary, or lying that your grandparents were immigrants.15. Should America be concerned that in ChinaGate, the 22 people that were convicted of fraud or for funneling Asian funds into the DNC were associates of Bill Clinton?16. Did selling stays at the Lincoln Bedroom to political donors make you feel like a wh)o(re?17. Does Hillary think Juanita Broadrick lied when she said on national news that Bill Clinton raped her?18. Is she still okay that Bill goes to pedophile island with Jeff Epstein?19. Why are there so many murdered and suicided people in the Clinton's immediate circle?20. Doesn't the fact that the Clinton Foundation has to amend 5 years of its tax returns for improper reporting imply that you were involved in an illegal RICO enterprise?21. Doesn't approving the Russian-owned Uranium One deal as secretary of state--because of illegal contributions to your foundation--in fact make you a traitor to this country?22. Was it wise to have at least four Clinton Foundation board of directors that have either been convicted or charged of the financial crimes of bribery and fraud?23. Why, Hillary, did you pay your female senate staffers 72% of what you paid your male staffers?24. When you represented an accused pedophile rapist, why did you laugh when you got him off even though you believed him to be guilty?25. She said she had one e-mail address, it came out that she had two; She said she had one device, it came out that she had two: She said none of her e-mails on her private server was classified, but when the State Dept handed over 300 e-mails the FBI redacted large sections of one, proving again she was wrong. Thus, Ms. Clinton, are you incompetent or just a congenital liar?Everyone should go on you tube and watch The Clinton Chronicles -- it will amaze you what a couple of psychopaths the Clintons really are!

5 | Bradley J Smith | 308 | 10155539966656509_10155539986256509 | Misleading headline ... you list Hillary Clinton/Donald Trump are neck & neck at 46-45. One would assume that Clinton is ahead but it's Trump who is ahead at 46-45. Shouldn't the story be that Trump overtook the lead?
6 | Chris Elliot | 383 | 10155539966656509_10155539984981509 | How is this even possible? What has happened to the common sense, education and intelligence of the American people? Bernie was my choice. I'm not a huge fan of HRC but she's the only choice now. Trump is a dangerous, egotistical, potential dictator who could ruin this country. People, wake the hell up!
7 | Kathy White Graham | 117 | 10155539966656509_10155539994626509 | Trump for president!!! I used, to watch CNN,now I can't watch it for longer then 5 minutes. Guess they haven't realized yet,their network is going down with the Clintons.
8 | Jessica Perez | 61 | 10155539966656509_10155540003271509 | I just like "liking" all the hillary comments just to make them think they have more people on their side... skewing the polls so it's a big shock come election day LOL. #HillaryForPrison2016

10 | Deshawn Branch | 43 | 10155539966656509_10155539976896509 | I don't want a criminal that is under investigation to be my president. We fear Trump being president because of what he MIGHT do, but many of us are ok with Hillary being president when we know all of he terrible things that she has done and will continue to do if she is elected.
11 | Jude David | 22 | 10155539966656509_1838243356409519 | CNN is as corrupt as Hillary Clinton! The system is rigged and rigged by CNN! Why aren't you covering how one of your staffers fed questions to Hillary prior to a debate? Why are you using Hillary's newest email scandal as a way to question Comeys integrity?

12 | Bill Howland | 25 | 10155539966656509_10155540004921509 | There won't be a cnn by next year. Your ratings are gonna drop. It must be getting real hard trying toCover up all her mistakes criminal and other wise. Report the news. That's why we have to go to other sources because you can't trust your news stations. Corrupt and bought. We the people are not fools and you will not be able to find a job in your near future.
13 | Trisha Bruno Bailey | 21 | 10155539966656509_1838246913075830 | Shame on you CNN, for your biased reporting. It's blatant and obvious. With everything going on with new findings and leaks against Hilary, you barely cover it. Do your job and report the news, even if it's against the candiate you support.
14 | Juliann Doremus Sutherland | 29 | 10155539966656509_10155540001216509 | Can someone please (and I'm not looking for hate or rudeness I am truly trying to understand) explain why people would vote for Trump? Outside of the awful things he has said, and his unbearable temperament, he is completely unqualified. His economic plan has been projected to crash the economy and raise the national debt (by unbiased economists), he wants to cut us off from NATO, and befriend dictators. He has 0 experience in office. I feel the United States will lose all credibility and the markets are predicted to crash if he wins.  I'm just trying to understand what people see in him? What does it mean make America great again? Because I love this country and I think it already is pretty great. I understand wanting to change the corruption in politics but why is this man the answer?
15 | Clifford Payne | 22 | 10155539966656509_10155539981656509 | what a horrible candidate hillary clinton has turned out to be....despite help from the media, obama and co. campaigning for her around the clock, weak kneed republicans running to her side, and she STILL might lose.....clinton needs all the help she can get
16 | Michael Glazier | 13 | 10155539966656509_10155540019186509 | That's because Hillary is nothing but a crook she will say, do, and act like anything you want to get votes she doesn't care about the American people she doesn't even care about America she only cares about her personal portfolio those who believe otherwise I'm very naive. Just remember Donald Trump was and is a very successful businessman obviously every businessman has bankruptcies in their history. Also Donald Trump does not need to be the president he doesn't feel like he's paid his dues by having a spouse running around screwing all of the interns while he sat idly by waiting his turn to be president. Trump wants this job because he cares about his country plain and simple and you can see how horrible the Democrats Act when they are paying people who work for these TV stations to bring out hidden recordings of Trump when he thought he had safe zones to talk freely
17 | Shawn Conner | 18 | 10155539966656509_10155540002586509 | Trump fills arena ,hillary can't barely get 200 people at her rallies...only a liberal is blind enough to actually think she's winning
18 | Brian Wells | 21 | 10155539966656509_10155539993646509 | Corrupt, lying conman Donald Trump might be on the cusp of rigging yet another outcome. He has destroyed the lives of hardworking American small business owners, and used corporate welfare to subsidize his obscene lifestyle. Don't let get him one last con.
19 | Wanza Vinson | 11 | 10155539966656509_862888370515401 | Everyone just go VOTE... BLUE..we cannot afford to let a vindictive, retaliate, sexual pervert racist bigot crybully that disrespects women, Jews, Blacks, Hispanics, Mexicans, disabled people , has KKK, white supremacists on his side. Hate hate hate gloom and doom is his message. Is this who you want for president? Vote. Please come on 11/8 ..this election is crazy!!!!!
20 | Edward Chesky | 15 | 10155539966656509_10155539977261509 | A new InsideSources-NH Journal Poll is rocking the race and has left Democrats STUNNED!In the poll conducted October 26-28, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has a 1.7 point advantage over former U.S. Sec. of State Hillary Clinton, with 42.9 percent favoring her versus 44.6 percent for her Republican opponent in a five-way race.If Trump can pick off New Hampshire, his path to 270 electoral votes gets a lot easier!Let’s hope America decides right when the time comes and let’s pray Hillary Clinton gets out of the political race for good.
21 | Allison Baker Bailey | 16 | 10155539966656509_10155539990431509 | This is exactly where Romney and Obama were at this point- 1 week out. Electoral map still hers. Smerconish on CNN said this morning, he's going to need a Hail Mary
22 | Njoku Chukwuma | 6 | 10155539966656509_10155539987126509 | NEW: While vote preferences have held essentially steady, Hillary Clinton is now a slim point behind Donald J. Trump—a first since May—in the latest ABC News/Washington Post tracking poll, as strong enthusiasm for Clinton has ebbed since the FBI – Federal Bureau of Investigation’s new review concerning her emails.
23 | Mary Ann Dillard Anderson | 2 | 10155539966656509_1792482794334719 | I am so tired of Donald Trump keep talking about Hillary Clinton email we need to talk about his taxes this man don't pay taxes he need to bring his jobs back to America he lies a lot and he keeps saying Hillary liar. It's really sad that people is buying into him he always have a good sales pitch, what Donald Trump is planting seeds into people hearts and Minds and the one that's catching it, is the one that is just like him
24 | Sandi Whitlatch | 4 | 10155539966656509_1838267013073820 | Oh dear! I don't know about anyone else, but this election is scaring the crap out of me! I don't understand how anyone could vote trump. I really don't. He's reckless. He has no plan. He is a racist against everyone. And how scary is that that he is even considered for president of the united states?

We are so nice, politically correct and brainwashed by MSM and cable news like CNN. CNN needs to clean house and hire investigative reporters and journalists.
5 | Mike Michael | 1 | 10155539872341509_10155540685401509 | All we know about the J-20 is that it is (supposed to be) a low-observable aircraft, aka "stealth", that it doesn't have the engines that it really wants, and that it's bloody huge! The truth is no one knows what the J-20 is going to be, except the people who spec'd it out, and the people who are building it. They probably spend their coffee/tea breaks laughing about the rumour mills. ( quora)

New research shows measles are more deadly than originally thought. Vaccinations are key, the study concludes.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Thomas McIntyre | 228 | 10155539787971509_10155539852506509 | Fact, there are thousands of doctors, scientists, researchers, politicians, and medical professionals who question both the safety and efficacy of vaccines. Fact there are hundreds of peer reviewed independent studies that show the link between vaccines and brain damage, auto - immune disease, and a host of other adverse effects. Fact, the US Department of Health and Human Services has paid out over $3.5 Billion to families of vaccine injured individuals including autism...mostly innocent children whose parents had no idea that there was a risk involved with vaccines. Fact, vaccine manufacturers have zero liability for these injuries. Fact, there are zero scientific studies done to test the safety of any combination of vaccines. Fact, there are no studies that prove vaccines have reduced the incidence of diseases for which they were created. Fact, vaccine manufacturers are responsible for conducting their own safety and efficacy studies. Fact, every drug license ever rescinded for safety issues was once approved safe by the FDA.Fact, adverse drug reactions by FDA approved drugs have killed over 1,000,000 Americans in the last decade and seriously or permanently injured over 40,000,000 in that same period. Fact, Pharmaceutical manufacturers spend more on lobbying Congress than any other industry.Fact, pharmaceutical companies spend more on MSM advertising than they do on research.Fact, pharmaceutical companies advertising dollars account for the majority of MSM revenue.Fact, the CDC has maintained a database since 1990 of health records on over 7,000,000 Americans including 1,000,000 children but refuses to release the data to independent researchers which would enable them to compare health between the vaccinated and unvaccinated.Fact, William Thompson, a senior scientist at the CDC admitted to falsifying a study along with other scientists at the CDC, that originally showed an increased risk of autism for certain children.Fact, William Thompson applied for and was granted whistleblower status. Fact, William Thompson provided over 100,000 pages of documents to Congressman Bill Posey.Fact, Bill Posey spoke before Congress calling for a complete investigation in this matter.
2 | Matt CA | 84 | 10155539787971509_10155539829936509 | I don't know what's more idiotic- the random people posting about the election on a completely unrelated article, or the people who still think that vaccinations are worse than the diseases they prevent.
3 | Cheri N Kevin Etter | 46 | 10155539787971509_10155540386041509 | My son's neurologists confirmed Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM) from my son's MMR vaccine. We like to call that "autism" in this country and that is why parents are cautious about vaccines.  It isn't rare and is now happening to 1 in 45 children so that is worth reporting. You say that there have been 17 cases of this rare SSPE in 18 years. Go research how many deaths and (ADEM) permanent brain damage have been caused by the MMR vaccine in the last 18 years and report that to be fair.
4 | Matt James | 61 | 10155539787971509_10155539834506509 | vaccine shots are the wrong way, the parents have had it before, fought off the disease, and it dies off eventually. vaccines keep introducing it back into our own ecosystem to allow it to evolve.
5 | Lacey Brinkley Miller | 47 | 10155539787971509_10155540249631509 | This "complication" is listed in the vaccine insert as a reaction to the MMR vaccine. Also, nearly all US cases of measles have been in vaccinated individuals.
6 | Manqoba Edward | 60 | 10155539787971509_10155539802546509 | Wow guess the current vaccinations you have arent causing Autism fast enough, now you wanna kick it up a'notch huh?
7 | Cathie Cloud LeVasseur | 30 | 10155539787971509_10155540282461509 | Who did you say pay for the studies?? How about doing a balanced piece and forget the studies -talk to the parents who have been awarded money from the vaccine injury court. I am sure you can find just a few to give you their thoughts. Better yet talk to those families who have all signed the VaxXed bus. Many of their interviews are posted on line. This could be a slam dunk piece for you! It could be short, to the point and concise. All vaccines contain toxins. Learn the risks.
8 | Jennifer Holman | 23 | 10155539787971509_10155540513316509 | How in the world could anyone trust the government, CDC, Or heck even CNN?! They are all corrupt. They've lied to us repeatedly. How about make the vaccines safer? The trace amounts of mercury build up over time. The aluminum. Formaldehyde. And anyone that is pro life, how can you be pro vaccine since they are made of aborted fetal tissue?! They keep the baby alive long enough to get the cells they need then kill them. It's awful. These vaccines have done more harm than good. Measles, mumps, chicken pox.. I would rather catch these diseases and build natural immunity to them than get the vaccine and have vaccine induced diseases. The mumps outbreak in northwest Arkansas.... all vaccinated!! Not one unvaccinated child was reported. If these vaccines work so well, then how come they aren't preventing the vaccinated?! Follow the money trail folks.... it's all about money to these people. They don't care if the vaccines are safe or not. They don't care about health. They care about the bottom dollar.
9 | Kristina Bullard | 20 | 10155539787971509_10155539902121509 | Uhhh,  "new research " funded by whom??  People trust big pharmaceutical companies research as much as they trust Huma's husband recommendations, and DNC polling.
10 | Sherry Scrutchin Ledet | 16 | 10155539787971509_10155540319771509 | I am not against vaccinations, but we are vaccinating our populous against everything so they have no emunity to anything. If our kids aren't getting measles, mumps and chicken pox, the are getting things we never did, like foot and mouth desease. Where in the world did that come from? There will always be something new to develope a vaccine for. Studies like this are reported and frightened parents are rushing to the doctor for a vaccine.
11 | John Hatcher | 14 | 10155539787971509_10155539983996509 | uhmmm yeah.....that's because our government genetically modified the virus!! to ensure that they could poison people forever with their vaccines!!! i can't believe cnn is still on the air!!!...ya morons!!

15 | Katie Gore | 1 | 10155539787971509_10155540583156509 | Vaccinations are necessary just not 4-8-10 at one time. They need to be spread out so a little human body doesn't get over juiced up. They can not possibly know all the effects the combo of chemicals they put in all different size babies will have.
16 | Matt James | 3 | 10155539787971509_10155539825561509 | you give very low levels of the diseases or virus with the immunity shot to start to build up an immunity, but those that have never been exposed to might have "yuge" complications. Its exactly the same with the flu vaccine.

19 | Jody Jordan | 2 | 10155539787971509_10155540031536509 | If my child goes to daycare or school, I would rather have them vaccinated than not. Besides it is the requirement of schools....a newborn with measles is a very dangerous thing
20 | Marcella Giordano | 4 | 10155539787971509_10155539810661509 | CNN leaked a town hall question and a debate question to Donna Brazile. when the rest of the email thread is released, we may find more.
21 | Matt James | 1 | 10155539787971509_10155539821516509 | all vaccines have part of the disease in the immunity, and since their parents or predecessors were never indoctrinated with, they usually get infected through the shot.

Borger sent Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta an email on February 12, 2016 titled: “U r a tv star!”In the email, Borger knocked the Republican Party and praised Hillary.“I have been in gop hell. Will reach out soon! U good?,” Borger wrote to Podesta. Podesta replied, “Yup.” Borger then said, “[Hillary] had a really good debate tonite.”

Donald J. Trump used an aggressive strategy involving losses from his casinos to avoid paying taxes on hundreds of millions of dollars, the New York Times reports.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Nathan Swenson | 2480 | 10155539715301509_10155539727656509 | Let me do the job of your editors CNN and fix your headline: "Donald J Trump used a legal strategy involving losses to reduce future tax liability" The question should be legality and if its legal (it is) then your complaint should be against the tax code and not those that use it.
2 | Josh Harrell | 1013 | 10155539715301509_10155539719296509 | If it was legal (and it was), you can't blame him. If anyone else was in his position, they would di the same thing. Bo onw is going to volunteer to pay nearly a billion in taxes.
3 | Manuel Veyna III | 767 | 10155539715301509_10155539716536509 | What CNN & Donna Brazile were ousted doing would've never been held accountable if it weren't for Wikileaks. In business we call this "insider trading" a federal offense punishable by jail time. Brazile & CNN both should be charged for leaking questions to one presidential candidate over another which puts proof to Trumps claim that the system is RIGGED.CNN should face a congressional investigation!#LatinosForTrump
4 | Abara Nouah | 510 | 10155539715301509_10155539728211509 | So every time Hillary's secrets are revealed, the NYT has to counter that by publishing a damning report about Donald J. Trump, maybe they forgot to state all Donald J. Trump was doing was legal and not illegal.
5 | Mark Wright | 358 | 10155539715301509_10155539729126509 | That's it CNN what a way to deflect the news from corrupt Clinton..put the limelight back on Trump just as you have since he became the nominee..you should be ashamed of yourselves..
6 | Chris Topher | 288 | 10155539715301509_10155539728101509 | That simply makes him smart' Why don't you report and print a list of the other Billionaires in the world who use the same loophole.... why don't you print about all the missing money from the Clinton foundation..... your are like a Dog holding on to an old soup bone with no meat left on it... leave the Man alone and go pick on the real criminal Crooked Hilary !
7 | Jennifer Corey | 141 | 10155539715301509_10155539733891509 | No where in this article does it say he did anything illegal. My guess is half of the politicians oit there are probably manipulating numbers and playing hide and seek with their ventures.....
8 | Paul M Winters | 149 | 10155539715301509_10155539730216509 | Don't hate the player, hate the game. Create a flatter, fairer tax system instead of one that politicians can call "progressive" and tout a high rate on "the rich" but is filled with so many loopholes that the rich give millions to accountants and lawyers in order to reduce their tax burden. Create a flat system with a low, reasonable rate. Sometimes less is more.
9 | Măriuca Bolk-Ionescu | 103 | 10155539715301509_10155539718966509 | And again CNN ...about Trump  :) Next post will be about FBI and how bad is that they are doing their job !I can bet .... then again Trump ....then again the bad FBI .....and so  on  ,till 8 nov .
10 | Margaret Schohn | 62 | 10155539715301509_10155539736221509 | Wow CNN I sure don't hear you talking too much about the your  you're inside feeding the Hillary Clinton campaign questions all I hear is you bring up information about Donald Trump not paying taxes  with legal means. Any single person in this country may use the tax Strategies that Donald Trump did I know several people that rent out property and have losses that They carried over because of different things that happened with the building so it isn't anything that is illegal it isn't anything that can't be done it is a strategy that the IRS allows people to use for losses on property or other things. Maybe the story should be home CNN is actually the Clinton News Network and that is a fraud for journalism it's very clear that she leaked  questions twice to Hillary Clinton and that is not journalism but it. is insider trading if it were anything else. You're so afraid that you're going to lose the status quo with Hillary Clinton that you'll do anything to keep it going even if she's not the right candidate for this country even if it's been proven over and over and over again that her campaign is done things that were not right and as far as Wikileaks goes right it's not right it's hacking it's it's something this country needs to get used to because it'll never be able to be stopped unfortunately but the thing is the emails are the truth the emails are the truth and on top of that Hillary Clinton has a woman whose husband is sending sexual pictures and sexual things to underage people and this man is a step away two steps away from the presidency. Not to mention all the information that was on his computer which God knows where that computer went and who also had access to that computer his computer could have been hacked  God knows where that computer's been God knows he's had access to that computer who could have hacked it that they didn't know about and it's been wandering around laying around for the last year or so.
11 | Eric Paniagua | 49 | 10155539715301509_10155539738401509 | So what. That makes him a pretty smart business man if he has avoided paying that amount in taxes. I'm almost certain the average American is searching and searching for deductions come tax time. If you don't admit that then your just plain lying.
12 | Michael Brown | 36 | 10155539715301509_10155539734206509 | No one can blame him, maybe this goes to show how smart he is. I don't ANYONE that walks into thier tax guy and says " find me ways to pay more taxes than I have to"
13 | Craig Whiting | 35 | 10155539715301509_10155539747741509 | Can you give a list of all the billionaires donating to Hillary's campaign and show me how many took huge deductions to avoid paying taxes? And was it legal. Ok, thanks.
14 | Catherine Grinda | 23 | 10155539715301509_10155539742656509 | Aggressive, that's an opinion. Nevertheless, his "aggressive strategy" was legal. Keep that in mind when you judge. Unlike Hillary with ALL her illegal emails, etc.
15 | Moses Karugaba | 19 | 10155539715301509_10155539748211509 | We should all be looking to learn from this man on how you can avoid a tax and remain afloat in this dog eat dog world. This man is a genius and you guys at CNN keep trashing him. Its a genius to pull this off. Donald J. Trump for president all the way from here in Uganda!
16 | Joseph Vitale | 27 | 10155539715301509_10155539779311509 | Trump should be punished for following the law, if Hillary breaks the law CNN praises her, this is just another extension of the Democratic Party using smear techniques to alter the election, nice try.
17 | Kevin Pakkala | 22 | 10155539715301509_1789904844623210 | This is why he shouldnt release his taxes.... theres too many uneducated people who dont understand how self employed taxes work.... very few including myself pay personal tax... but my business pays more ... donalds property tax is in the millions annually... not excluding the thousands of jobs hes created...
18 | Chris O'Dell | 21 | 10155539715301509_10155539752866509 | 😂Hillary is a multiple Felon and a trader to our country but CNN is Back on the trump tax thing again so sad...Desperation has set in for the communist Dems and you all are going down with the sinking ship
19 | André Larbi | 11 | 10155539715301509_10155539752851509 | Unless  CNN does not know this and they can never say that; every business always find legal means to beat the law in order to stay on top of business but that is not what matters now, what matters most is the Hillary Clinton E- mail saga, how she managed to cause such atrocities!

He is far better than the murderer, lying, sneaky, corrupt, pathetic person that Hillary Clinton is!!! When people allow someone who deserves to be behind bars for life run in the presidential election, there are huge problems ahead!!! As far as the FBI's new investigation on her, I hope she gets nailed hard and pays the price in jail that she more than deserves to pay!!!!!! #votetrump2016 #hillaryforprison
25 | Sean Pasell | 12 | 10155539715301509_1789907814622913 | CNN has to correct their headline. Should say "Trump uses legal system out in place by Washington and used by Warren Buffett, Mark Zukerberg, Bill Gates, and Tim Cook".  There you go CNN.

Black riders waited 30% longer overall for an Uber X to arrive, a new study showed.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Mary Waters | 145 | 10155539650021509_10155539658746509 | And I thought after it's been reported through WikiLeaks that CNN gave questions they were going to ask Hillary Clinton to  Brasil that you would be posting something to defend yourself or try to. Clinton News Network
2 | Taylor Brooke | 92 | 10155539650021509_10155540044101509 | I drive uber. And all I know in my case I never see anyone's photo when I pick them up. I don't know what their race is until I get there. A lot of people are like you can tell by the name... I hardly even look at names, as soon as I get that request I click accept.. cause everyone's money spends the same..
3 | Mike Mikels | 42 | 10155539650021509_10155539770891509 | First off, how would the Uber drivers know they are black when they call for a ride? If they mean they wait 30% longer waiting for an Uber driver to go into a dangerous neighborhood...oh well. If I was an Uber driver I would have to seriously have to consider if the fare was worth risk too.
4 | Ariel N'Jeremy Dennison | 41 | 10155539650021509_10155539769121509 | What did you do today dear? Oh nothing just starting the race war back up so Obama and his minions can do whatever they need to do without eyes on them. So i created a distraction that works every time.  And get this dear, there's no way uber drivers can know the race before hand hahahahahahaha. Can't wait to see America at war with its self. When there are issues being slid under the rug left and right. (My dipiction of a CNN worker and their spouse swapping work stories)
5 | Sharon Dickerson | 33 | 10155539650021509_10155539780156509 | This is such a dumb thingSo what...I can tell you, race has NOTHING to do with it. We can't see the riders' pics...So please!
6 | Daniela Wuttke | 18 | 10155539650021509_10155539845896509 | I don't discriminate but if a rider has a really low rating I won't accept them for my own security, or I might just not have gas and didn't shut off the app in time.  There are so many other reasons besides blaming it on race
7 | Jonathan A. Ronda | 16 | 10155539650021509_10155539941806509 | Oh, look... CNN is making a non-story about racism, how unusual...Uber drivers don't know how someone looks like before picking them up. I can assure you, most Uber drivers care about making money, so they don't care about what race a person is.
8 | Casey Shiller | 12 | 10155539650021509_10155539821761509 | This is ridiculous! Uber doesn't know your race until they arrive to get you..... I'm sick of everything becoming a race issue!
9 | David Victor Furman | 8 | 10155539650021509_10155539759786509 | Just in the interest of total disclosure, did this survey also determine how often a passenger has robbed or otherwise committed a crime against a driver (or vice versa) and any particulars as to the race/gender/ethnicity/etc of both the driver and passenger in such instances?  It may be an insignificant number, but in many other instances people demand data and not just anecdotal stories to fairly evaluate the various relevant factors.
10 | Keith Miller | 4 | 10155539650021509_10155540139476509 | Another nonsensical "study". Show me the data. Show me the race or gender of the drivers. Show me the areas in which these studies are comparing... Statistics are a funny thing, when you're hoping to find a particular answer.
11 | Ryan Daniel | 8 | 10155539650021509_10155539764946509 | That makes no sense.  They don't know your race.  On another note I only paid for an Uber twice and both times the drivers were nice and happened to be black.
12 | HiHater Niagara Bates | 2 | 10155539650021509_10155540066916509 | Here in Detroit,MI their always on timeI stay in the Berg/Lahser neighborhood on the westside of Detroit "working class area"There also nice peopleI've taken it 8 times never had a problem Just pay your way an get to wherever you have to go Try not to disturb the drivers let them do their job!!!
13 | Christopher Tamucci | 6 | 10155539650021509_10155540147686509 | Blacks fill a large portion of densely populated areas. So of course a cab or an UBER would be busier in those areas and take a bit longer. I moved to quiet town and I never wait very long for a cab. But when I lived in a city it took forever sometimes upward of 25-30 mins (even tho they said 5 mins) for a cab to pick me up. How do we know this is a race issue without considering other factors? After reading the article it seems a lot of assumptions were made based off the evidence instead of probing more. 'Women were kept in the cab longer 'perhaps for reason like flirting or making them you a higher fare'. Perhaps - roughly translated as we have no idea at all if this is true but this is the ASSumption we're going with.
14 | Roy Lamberson | 4 | 10155539650021509_10155539916071509 | The findings stem from a research published on Monday from professors at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Stanford University and the University of Washington. Well then. That explains this garbage research.
15 | Kcirtap Snave | 5 | 10155539650021509_10155539797056509 | I love how people blame CNN for so-called "Race Baiting", when racism has been going on since this country was founded and even before that. I love how whites act like Pres. Obama's administration somehow is causing all this racism nonsense, but yet every other day some white kid posts a picture of themselves in a gorilla suit or blackface to Instagram lol delusional.
16 | Justin May | 2 | 10155539650021509_10155539913241509 | I didn't know that was even anoption to give while requesting an uber.  We were in philly and had to take one. Driver was black. We waited longer then should have. Should I make a report of it? Seriously, you need to complain about this as well.... Nothing better to do I guess.
17 | FrankieKristin Hamilton | 3 | 10155539650021509_10155540077016509 | I seriously don't believe that Uber asks you if your black or white when you call them. This is a bit much to assume and I'm so tired of people always making stuff into a black / white race issue. We ALL are equal  in many more ways than some of you beleive.
18 | Jay Gibs | 0 | 10155539650021509_10155540567971509 | I've been dropped off in the middle of my trip. He complained about why I didn't send him the destination. I just had foot surgery and was dropped off by Church in Virginia on the side of a road. I was in tears. Uber says a refund for the ride is all that's fair even though I felt like dirt, my health was endangered, and I missed an appointment for a job ironically driving for Uber with a rental.
19 | Starla Kalb | 1 | 10155539650021509_10155540482756509 | Bad area? Less drivers in the area? More riders in the area to create longer waits? More traffic congestion? Higher demand at different times of the day or night. Just because this was done in Boston doesn't mean that every area of Boston is the same and can expect the same service. So many other factors to look at besides just race.
20 | Dan Reynolds | 2 | 10155539650021509_10155540418221509 | I will be honest, I drive in North San Antonio,  it's more affluent.  It's called smart business.  The rides are longer than other parts of the city, if I end Up downtown, I will take rides , if I get stuck doing short rides, I turn my app off and drive back to the north side.  Once again, I don't care about color and I don't even look at the name, if. A ride is over 10 miles away. I don't accept it
21 | Mykael Stewart | 0 | 10155539650021509_10155540369031509 | People didn't even read the story. CNN is only reporting what study's showed. Bloomberg reported it first. Stanford and other institutes did the study. People are just trump deplorables believing everything is tilted against them. O yea , still no smoking gun in the Hillary emails. #hillary2016
22 | Wyatt Pride | 6 | 10155539650021509_10155539708431509 | That's because the Uber driver has to fight thru the ghetto to get to them. Even though the ghetto is the safest place to live (that's why blacks live there) it's still very difficult to arrive at the passenger location. They are always showered with hugs and happiness while in the ghetto. ✌️
23 | Michael Moore | 5 | 10155539650021509_10155539784906509 | Instead of trying to divide this nation even more and continuing obamas racial legacy, let's talk about how CNN is biased and the link with the Clinton mob family!
24 | Susan Nally | 0 | 10155539650021509_879166328850070 | I love Uber! I did have a problem with being over charged one time with a route I take very often. I called, they looked into it and the next day they corrected it, no problem. I'll take Uber any day over a taxi.
25 | CJ Guion | 1 | 10155539650021509_10155539897136509 | I think it's more so a neighborhood issue than a color issue ... people tend to drive in busier areas where they will make more money... Interestingly, more minorities seem to tip than the white ones many times. But let's not act like people also don't know what areas are black and what areas are more white....

1 | Ogbeni Segun Adekunle-Alli JP | 10 | 10155539616826509_10155539624911509 | That should really be sent to Donald Trump and when he's checked that arrogance & temperament he could re-apply to become president? Knee jerks can't be president
2 | Yan Ack | 2 | 10155539616826509_10155539880326509 | experts always tell you what to think and then later they say 'not as previously thought'. The race of 'experts' is formed from the pits of human thinking. They're the worst of humanity, dictating to the rest.
3 | Randy Wilson | 17 | 10155539616826509_10155539647186509 | Funny, all the comments on Trump's ego, arrogance, etc., Him, his campaign, his career aren't under FBI investigation AGAIN, their aren't thousands of emails out there tied to incompetent national security handling, election rigging videos, every hillary campaigner, Democrat, hillary campaign mgrs.

2 | Mike Boyd | 62 | 10155539342516509_10155539363146509 | Where is your report on Wikileaks, Crooked Hillary being investigated by the FBI for criminal wrong doing, Donna Brazille and CNN feeding debate questions to Crooked Hillary before the debates???
3 | David Elias | 26 | 10155539342516509_10155539652641509 | This is very simple, if you are sexually active, your menstrual period is missing and your abdomen is distending over 7-9 months YOU HAVE KIDNEY STONES. PLEASE.
4 | Namdigui Remei Haokip | 12 | 10155539342516509_10155539460251509 | It happened to my mum as well. My mum was treated for TB and no one even knew she was pregnant until the day of the delivery. And my youngest brother who is now 13 year old was born after a gap of 7 year to my youngest sister.
5 | Carlos Cabrera | 35 | 10155539342516509_10155539457586509 | Trumpets are going crazy. They heard something about E-mails and they love E-mails. I have a friend. He's a trumpet. I sent him all my junk E-mails and he can't stop thanking me.
6 | Bernadette Rocha | 3 | 10155539342516509_10155539862836509 | It happens. Not everyone shows. This tiny Ukrainian lady I used to work with didn't start showing till she was 8 months. She didn't even have symptoms till then. By the time she gave birth, unless you already knew she was pregnant, she was still really thin. Didn't look pregnant at all.
7 | Azia Miya Mendoza | 3 | 10155539342516509_10155539707881509 | Ok every time a woman who could possibly even be pregnant gets a pregnancy test when going to the emergency room, well at least at my local hospital. So when she broke her ankle and got an X-ray why didn't they give her one?
8 | Halla Ann Howell-Holsapple | 1 | 10155539342516509_10155540117491509 | Have a friend. She gained 10lbs, and had what she thought was her period every month. She continue her normal lifestyle. Drink occasionally, went dancing etc. I had even seen her during this time. She looked normal to me. I had just had my 2nd child. She didn't have any symptoms and the baby wasn't active at all. She woke up one night with horrible back pains. She thought was either kidney stones or appendix. She went to the bathroom and gave birth to a 8lb baby on the floor. Like I said, I had seen her during her pregnancy and would have never had guessed she was expecting. All bodies are different.
9 | Tsitsi Mpofu | 2 | 10155539342516509_10155540025391509 | Guys I know it happens but seriously, I don't understand how you don't notice yourself getting bigger, feeling nauseous, no periods and something moving around inside you. I'm sure you can't mistake a baby for gas.
10 | Lori Bennett-Naumann | 0 | 10155539342516509_10155540604061509 | This DOES happen.  It happened to my daughter.I delivered her surprise "thought I had the flu" baby.She is married with 2 other babies already.
11 | Nay Rod | 0 | 10155539342516509_10155540921326509 | Sorry but how the hell you don't know your pregnant. I'm a woman and your body changes. First sign, no period, breast growing, belly growing. baby moving/kicking... You have to be completely brain dead, not to know your carrying a baby for nine months.
12 | Segun Keyboard Adeyemi | 9 | 10155539342516509_10155539357376509 | You can't compare God's work with human medical mentality

22 | Alexis Schröder | 0 | 10155539342516509_10155540137516509 | She must have already been quite overweight to not have noticed the changes to her body.

WikiLeaks  Sunday – Democracy Partners co-founder Mike Lux made the eyebrow-raising assertion in a Dec. 17, 2015 email to Center for American Progress leader Neera Tanden. The message, found in a trove hacked from Clinton Campaign Chairman John Podesta’s account and posted by WikiLeaks, refers to an alleged connection between Democracy Partners head Robert Creamer and Clinton Campaign Manager Robby Mook.“Just wanted to pass along this note I sent to Bob Creamer, who as you may know is consulting for the DNC and is close to Robby Mook,” Lux wrote in a note about outreach to grassroots progressives.

Two of China's brand new, top-of-the-line stealth fighter jets streaked and screamed across an air exhibition on Tuesday as Beijing showed its newest military hardware to the public for the first time.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Marcus Charles | 200 | 10155539323451509_10155539448211509 | Meanwhile US spent 1.4 trillion dollars on F35 that barely works. While the common citizens are robbed of 54 percent of the tax budget for the corrupt military but services, living standards etc all falling apart or collapsing. Chinese probably built this Jet at a tiny fraction of that F35 cost; while lifting millions out of poverty, building whole new cities and thousand of kms of high speed trains and all sorts of modern infrastructure that makes USA look rather behind the time technologically these days. But propaganda keeps telling you USA best in the world. Everyone else is an enemy.In fact the elites stealing your taxes and loading the nation up with debt are your people's enemy ; not the Chinese, not the Russian.
2 | Joe Fliss | 99 | 10155539323451509_10155539333631509 | They still have to fly it and if you've ever driven a car in L.A. you know Asians can't even negotiate a left turn in a car, much less a jet.
3 | Erik Madson | 27 | 10155539323451509_10155539369986509 | Everyone is getting all cocky about us jets this and us that. We blew a trillion bucks making our stealth jet. Let that sink in. And it's STILL got problems. And here they are making a copy done in half the time and 1/4 the money. Our time is running out, we either lean up and really push ahead, or we keep awarding military contracts with a blank check and slowly bankrupting ourselves. What's your choice?
4 | Chung Nguyen | 27 | 10155539323451509_10155539364001509 | What china doing is that it tries to use illegal copied weapons to intimidate small countries. Of course, those "high tech" arms combined with the cruelty of its leaders could threaten others but definitely cannot create a great china.
5 | Robert Butler | 13 | 10155539323451509_10155539876806509 | You want to make America great again.Start with education. China has more engineers than any other country in the world.The USA has become too lazy and greedy.Most of your inventions have been invented by immigrants.American globalists have sold out your country. Profits over Quality,
6 | Olweny Jovina | 19 | 10155539323451509_10155539372601509 | The problem with China is, Technologies it invent are purely western format. like this fighter jet, the outer appearance reveals US technology. Copy and paste, copy and paste, copy and paste, is all about China rise to super power.
7 | Kenneth Corbett | 22 | 10155539323451509_10155539326086509 | wonder where they got that tech from, oh wait they hacked lockheed martin and no one was held accountable for it per usual in our government
8 | James Shlosman | 8 | 10155539323451509_10155539340816509 | Quietly building their military. While this stealth jet may not be as good as a us stealth jet, it won't be long before they figure out a way to build one better.
9 | Tom Tenefrancia Opeña | 0 | 10155539323451509_10155540667761509 | Dapat adto na lantawon sa big screen na radar and satellite view kay ug klaro japun ng mga tuldok ana sa screen then pakontrahan ra japun na ug high-end regular fighting planes.hehe.. in my opinion stealth is effective sa bombers cause they do not have to expose themselves to being seen by their enemies as they fly  pero in fighter planes where close contact is required then it has to be stealth and literally not being seen face to face.
10 | Lightbulb Turner | 2 | 10155539323451509_10155539355126509 | The Russians and the Chinese got the technology from Snowden, because this tech did not become applicable to their fighter jet program's until Snowden's defection. He didn't have a problem following all types of devilish orders and concealing secrets from the public under the Bush administration's, but as soon as the black man took to office, he felt the need to defect. Well at least Obama didn't have anything deplorable to say about Putin in those wiki leak memos, like Bush and Co. did. To hell with it all, and anyone who sees different.
11 | Dean Hutchison | 0 | 10155539323451509_10155539762946509 | Stealth advantage aside, the real test will be how well they perform when they have to outrun or dogfight an opposing aircraft.Something we know the F-35 has a huge problem with.  Which is an issue and design mentality that goes back to the F-4 Phantoms and the belief back then that all air combat will be long range missile fights and dogfights of previous generations of planes were a thing of the past.
12 | Yan Ack | 0 | 10155539323451509_10155539895651509 | when a country starts putting in money into defence hardware, the evolution of such things usually points the way to using said hardware in order that they may be replaced in order that the factories that produce them may not close down. Then, this country starts eyeing potential weak countries that it may attack with impunity with a few lame excuses in tow.
13 | Michael Osip | 0 | 10155539323451509_10155539796231509 | f you go to university center, they’ll give you a new ballot, they’ll void your old ballot. They’ll give you a new ballot, and you can go out and make sure it get’s in. Now in some places, they do that four or five times, but we don’t do that. So by tomorrow, almost everyone will have their new ballots in.
14 | Mike Croslin | 0 | 10155539323451509_10155539506806509 | Hehehe!Now where is that American patriotism?That thing can't even touch the '117', let alone the 'Raptor'.And what should we spend more borrowed money on, more entitlements, education?Yeah, that sounds like the new American way!
15 | Dan Bissonnette | 0 | 10155539323451509_10155540380511509 | And they got most of their technology for these birds from the Clinton Administration and what they could steal from private defense contractor's.America needs to change the way we do things. Let's start now with next Tuesday!
16 | Lam Tran Tien | 0 | 10155539323451509_10155539611376509 | Không phủ nhận thành tựu của China , nhưng hãy tự đếm xem các người xuất khẩu được bao nhiêu tiêm kích , và cái J 20 kia cũng chỉ là một sản phẩm lỗi thời khi vừa mới ra lò mà thôi !
17 | Paul Jr Gacheru | 0 | 10155539323451509_10155540235911509 | It would probably not perform well in a real combat situation .....most Chinese stuff look real on the outside , but are fake on the inside and usually you end up disappointed.
18 | Brad Zaharis | 4 | 10155539323451509_10155539395101509 | here's the thing, what we see showcased in the USAF arsenal is about 20 years behind their actual capabilites, we dont diclose our latest fighters and bombers to the public and likely never will. Its always been that way, by the time an aircraft makes it into production they have already  begun and perfected a highly classified advanced generation stealth aircraft.
19 | James B Kirk | 0 | 10155539323451509_10155540155761509 | Wouldn't last 2 minutes against our F/A 18's. Remember the Russians had to fly chinese aircraft over korea, because chinese are terrible pilots.
20 | Kevin Francis | 1 | 10155539323451509_10155539729406509 | Evrrybody got stealth now...all this weaponry and people still dont even have food to eat in some places...gotta think what were these politicians thinking about when they decided on killing instead of living...
21 | Rick Hopper | 0 | 10155539323451509_10155539808786509 | Technology look familiar??? This is a good example of how the US govt politicians are failing the people..It cost 100s of billion of tax dollars to develop this only to have it stolen. People in high places just there because of ol boy network.
22 | Neviin Nair | 0 | 10155539323451509_10155539712771509 | Not long ago f22 got stopped production due to high cost and non foreseen adversary Suddenly china have built j20 in record speedI wont be supprised if congress give a go ahead on f22 production in near futureSo i wont elaborate much, i guess a simple man can get what im trying to say
23 | Michael-ius G Peduca | 0 | 10155539323451509_10155539537511509 | Watched Discovery channels what on earth yesterday the sattelite image showed a nighthawk in a chinese facility maybe thats why they have stealth now.
24 | Florian Hertz | 1 | 10155539323451509_10155539493641509 | China is the oldest civilization in the world as far as I'm concerned so I would definitely reassess whether America, who has only existed for a couple hundred years, is so much more Superior than a country who, I don't know, invented paper and gunpowder and has existed in some form for about five thousand years
25 | Edward Mestaz | 0 | 10155539323451509_10155539487836509 | All jokes set aside of how they drive, what they drive and if they can drive. This is some serious stuff, they are building and building and this is one prime example. This is a plane that can sneak under our radar just as much as ours can under theirs. I really would like to know how they keep coming up with something that we created first. So many American living over there because company's have moved.  This is freaky. 🇺🇸

A vacationing family found an unusual "walking" fish with legs. Researchers hope a DNA test can shed more light on this mysterious creature. http://cnn.it/2f7pSrn
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Marilia Varoli | 39 | 10155539303576509_10155539818151509 | "Hey look! A walking fish!!! Let's remove it from it's habitat and kill it on the way to a lab" - Great job folks, great job.
2 | Harold Coombs III | 3 | 10155539303576509_10155539430291509 | I believe in angler fish the males latch onto the females with their jaws and basically are incorporated into the body of the female as small appendages. I wonder if that is what happened here....
3 | Steven Li | 11 | 10155539303576509_10155539893101509 | Typicla humans. First they discover it, then study and send it to the aquarium. Later they catch some more,eat it and fish becomes extinct.
4 | Raj Bansal | 4 | 10155539303576509_10155540110986509 | A lot lies beneath which us humans aren't even aware contradictory to the claims made by scientists they know all. Each day new discoveries are made. All is creation of the Almighty. Ahem ahem !!

I don't really believe this I'm just thinking of that movie The Faculaty
7 | Jesus Sotelo Jr. | 2 | 10155539303576509_10155539521586509 | This garbage is so simple to understand!! If you want to learn more about genetics; you have to study the organism that has the highest birth rates. Because that organism is challenging it's environment at a higher rate than others. Humans were at that point at one time, and now it's fish. This fish is just at a point where the only option it had was to start walking on land. Humans do this every day when they apply their intellect at just trying to survive. Survival situations like war, famine etc.. Honestly, I would get worried when the fish start asking why humans starts wars so much. Because to me, that's the great question.
8 | Anthony Foreman | 1 | 10155539303576509_10155540395226509 | Can't be real! Remember evolution doesn't exist (even though we see it all the time)! If the Bible doesn't say it, then it isn't real like the dinosaurs!
9 | MissRaelene Paris | 3 | 10155539303576509_10155539319381509 | As you know...  this is the Eve before America sees a November it has NEVER EVER seen before ... We are 8, EIGHT, eight whole days guys! Before election... Whether you like to believe it or not ... we are at a major turning point not only as American Citizens but as a whole country... our America! In light of the fact that we have recently bred such a narcissistic generation that believes their opinion is sooooooooooo important & must be shared through the abundance of social media resources & platforms... My agenda here is not to "right" although that is usually the reason ANY argument is posed. I understand that sharing political views is not usually proper, social etiquette. esp. via social media. However, Can we just talk about the fact that my heart is severely and deeply sorrowed by the lack of morals and ethics in this country this day in age? There is absolutely zero reason why we as a country should have to sit back & observe San Bernadino & Orlando shootings. Zero Reason to observe innocent men of color or minorities being shot down just so we can turn around & then see  that police are the victims of shootings. Zero reason why we should have to start a "black lives matter" movement because TRUTH IS ... WE ALL MATTER ... & Zero reason why we must witness the most wild, chaotic debate in the history of this country!!!!!!!!! IF ALL OF US ... went ahead & just displayed LOVE.... showed a little more compassion & decided against our ugly selfishness.... America can be a rock solid foundation to birth future Generations of prosperity, wealth, health & Happiness.... It is time we come together in Unity rather than allowing a Pokémon Go game to unite us. This generation of ... "I can freely think, do whatever I want when I want, be who I want because it's convenient to me, act how I want, behave how I want, treat others how I want" has only birthed a generation with lack of morals & respect. Those who think that way need to be LOVED on. They are hurting. Rather than annihilating them with our words we ought to just LOVE on them. My heart hurts as to what liberal America has turned to... Anyways if you made it this far in the post ... kudos to you & thank you for your time... But when you hit the polls on the 8th please, first & foremost thank you for doing your duty as a citizen, but please stand for what is right after you have loved a little more this week, showed a bit more compassion & removed yourself from your selfishness.... where can our Country go with a mindset like this?!?!!!!! Lastly, & please state your opinions & debate me on this & if you feel the need share your frustrations .... but in the most HUMBLE way possible & with ALL DUE RESPECT friends Donald Trump will be winning. It is his God given & appointed time to turn America back to the father... The first 3 letters of his name is TRU & boy does AMERICA need so much more of TRUTH now than ever... America must operate in whatsoever is true, honest, pure & lovely ... I love you all dearly... seriously every single one of you on here ... I am so sure he will win that I am willing to lay down my life on the fact. I can even bet money that he will ... comments welcome please!!!!  Donald J. Trump #tagafriend

The Hillary Clinton campaign's new "Daisy" ad is playing in a very different political environment than in 1964, a CNN Opinion columnist says.

1 | Vishnu Shal | 161 | 10155539242611509_10155539249381509 | BREAKING! BREAKING! William Thompson--- Breaking News....!!!! CNN reports Clinton is now LEADING in the polls in important battleground states such as Qatar, Iraq, Iran, and Syria. And hopefully soon San Quentin.....!!!!
2 | Jeff Shoemaker | 98 | 10155539242611509_10155539254961509 | Democrats loved James Comey July 5th when he said he wouldn't recommend formal charges... Now there is a compete 180 degree flip flop. Hillary destroyed 33,000 emails and lied to the FBI and American people. 7 days from the election and there is only one person to blame for these problems...Hillary Clinton...
3 | Aasi Tahir Siddique | 27 | 10155539242611509_10155539316641509 | Unfortunately, Hillary Clinton has made few errors over a period of time but Donald Trump is an experimental error of genetic disorder.
4 | Pam Colon | 6 | 10155539242611509_10155539977191509 | I'm old, I never even heard of this ad, I do see the 60's as the beginning of the downfall of morality in the US though, a time when law enforcement and the military were treated horrendously in America, I guess we have come full circle and Hillary has highlighted it, and she is part of the problem.....Trump is the solution.....thinks for the introspective HRC! #trump16
5 | Artie Fisher | 7 | 10155539242611509_10155539836581509 | With all that is going on CNN still focuses on the Trump side of the issue like Hillary does not even exist in an attempt to distance her from an issue she herself clearly created
6 | Jeremy Ruditis | 13 | 10155539242611509_10155539333341509 | Hillary Clinton is using this for her campaign yet she used lack of security that endangers the lives of our military yet she wants to be president and commander in chief putting the lives of others in danger if elected even more so than what she did to originally endanger lives. That being said why is it she is even being allowed to run for president of our nation after all she even lied to congress which in its self a crime that she is being let off the hook for while others who lied to congress got jailed. Sounds like a rigged plot to win the presidency to me and other Americans

11 | Joe Porter | 1 | 10155539242611509_10155540646561509 | CNN owes Bernie Sanders an apology. The DNC and the Clinton campaign should not be rewarded with the White House with the clear efforts they went through to try and derail Bernie Sanders. How Bernie can say with a straight face to his supporters to vote for the system that is not red handed caught trying to smear and now giving Hillary heads up questions in debates against Bernie?? And Donna Brazil's reward for all this?? Appointed head of the DNC when their corrupt chair had to resist for cheating Bernie Sanders. Who are the deplorables again???"In a statement, CNN said it was "completely uncomfortable with what we have learned about her interactions with the Clinton campaign while she was a CNN contributor."
12 | Michael Osip | 1 | 10155539242611509_10155539794951509 | f you go to university center, they’ll give you a new ballot, they’ll void your old ballot. They’ll give you a new ballot, and you can go out and make sure it get’s in. Now in some places, they do that four or five times, but we don’t do that. So by tomorrow, almost everyone will have their new ballots in.
13 | Jude David | 2 | 10155539242611509_10155540117146509 | CNN is as corrupt as Hillary Clinton! The system is rigged and rigged by CNN! Why aren't you covering how one of your staffers fed questions to Hillary prior to a debate? Why are you using Hillary's newest email scandal as a way to question Comeys integrity? You are so one sided it makes me sick! I used to watch CNN all the time not anymore!
14 | Bill McCarron | 8 | 10155539242611509_10155539282786509 | Hillary desperate to pivot from her lies, crimes and corruption. Even if she manages to win the election, do you really want 4 years of her being under investigation and her hands being tied/ You think it bad now with this idiot in theWH, wait till the world laugh at us if she's our so called leader. talk about a weak loser
15 | Christian Rivoira | 3 | 10155539242611509_10155539470671509 | "Were Mrs. Clinton elected, she’d have the near absolute power of the American presidency. But she wouldn’t need that to become corrupt. She’s there already," argue Bill Bennett and F.H. Buckley.
16 | Todd Smith | 4 | 10155539242611509_10155539611576509 | CNN has gotten rid of Brazille for getting/giving advanced questions. Why was nothing done to the CNN reporter? So much for being the most trusted source in News! At least NBC did something to their reporters when they were unethical! And we cannot trust ABC news because it’s management has very close ties to Clinton and then there is George Stephanapolis!
17 | Humberto Flores | 11 | 10155539242611509_10155539302926509 | Hey Clinton News Network, what about HRC interview when she defended a 12 years old girl rapist and she laughed and made up histories that that girl was looking for older men...., are you even serious!???, how a 12 years old girl can be mature enough to know about that!!??

18 | MissRaelene Paris | 10 | 10155539242611509_10155539319576509 | As you know...  this is the Eve before America sees a November it has NEVER EVER seen before ... We are 8, EIGHT, eight whole days guys! Before election... Whether you like to believe it or not ... we are at a major turning point not only as American Citizens but as a whole country... our America! In light of the fact that we have recently bred such a narcissistic generation that believes their opinion is sooooooooooo important & must be shared through the abundance of social media resources & platforms... My agenda here is not to "right" although that is usually the reason ANY argument is posed. I understand that sharing political views is not usually proper, social etiquette. esp. via social media. However, Can we just talk about the fact that my heart is severely and deeply sorrowed by the lack of morals and ethics in this country this day in age? There is absolutely zero reason why we as a country should have to sit back & observe San Bernadino & Orlando shootings. Zero Reason to observe innocent men of color or minorities being shot down just so we can turn around & then see  that police are the victims of shootings. Zero reason why we should have to start a "black lives matter" movement because TRUTH IS ... WE ALL MATTER ... & Zero reason why we must witness the most wild, chaotic debate in the history of this country!!!!!!!!! IF ALL OF US ... went ahead & just displayed LOVE.... showed a little more compassion & decided against our ugly selfishness.... America can be a rock solid foundation to birth future Generations of prosperity, wealth, health & Happiness.... It is time we come together in Unity rather than allowing a Pokémon Go game to unite us. This generation of ... "I can freely think, do whatever I want when I want, be who I want because it's convenient to me, act how I want, behave how I want, treat others how I want" has only birthed a generation with lack of morals & respect. Those who think that way need to be LOVED on. They are hurting. Rather than annihilating them with our words we ought to just LOVE on them. My heart hurts as to what liberal America has turned to... Anyways if you made it this far in the post ... kudos to you & thank you for your time... But when you hit the polls on the 8th please, first & foremost thank you for doing your duty as a citizen, but please stand for what is right after you have loved a little more this week, showed a bit more compassion & removed yourself from your selfishness.... where can our Country go with a mindset like this?!?!!!!! Lastly, & please state your opinions & debate me on this & if you feel the need share your frustrations .... but in the most HUMBLE way possible & with ALL DUE RESPECT friends Donald Trump will be winning. It is his God given & appointed time to turn America back to the father... The first 3 letters of his name is TRU & boy does AMERICA need so much more of TRUTH now than ever... America must operate in whatsoever is true, honest, pure & lovely ... I love you all dearly... seriously every single one of you on here ... I am so sure he will win that I am willing to lay down my life on the fact. I can even bet money that he will ... comments welcome please!!!!  Donald J. Trump #tagafriend

20 | Sandra Seversons | 0 | 10155539242611509_10155539980541509 | Up until 4 days ago, Trump and his supporters were saying the FBI and Comey were in Clinton's and Obama's hands and that the election was rigged. Now they are saying Comey is the best thing since sliced bread. They always want it both ways. Sexual misconduct is okay when it's directed at Bill, but is hearsay and lies when directed at Trump. They want transparency from Hillary by insisting she disclose speech transcripts, but Trump gets a pass for not releasing his tax returns. They point to the Clinton foundation as being corrupt while ignoring Trump using his charity to pay off state attorney generals to not file charges against Trump Looniversity...and on and on.

Trump NEVER firebombed election headquarters, attacked supporters and destroyed property...Clinton's people did! Trump NEVER lied to congress over and over and over agian...But Clinton sure did.

24 | Jason Henderson | 19 | 10155539242611509_10155539258761509 | Lol. Hillary threatens war with Russia to distract from her corruption, and you're worried about Trump...
25 | Nancy S. Skeddle | 0 | 10155539242611509_10155540395436509 | Born in 1953, the fear of a nuclear war was exactly portrayed, as I felt at the time, in this commercial ... I remember it clearly.  Not only did we have fire drills in schools, we also had bomb drills and all of us were extremely afraid knowing this could actually occur ... especially after the assassination of President Kennedy.    In the present, I fear if Donald Trump is elected it will come true .... the man just can't STFU.

She's screwed. 650,000 emails. We all know Hillary is corrupt. These new found emails just prove it.
7 | Lise Melin | 115 | 10155539078606509_10155539101396509 | I saw this comment by David Wolski on an article I read, and it expressed my thoughts. I'm sharing it with his permission:The e-mail scandal is so small. Did Hillary choose a private server in an attempt to bypass FOIA requests and control what data was accessible? Probably. Was it an unwise decision that made the data less secure? Yes. Is this criminal and disqualifying? No. It's further evidence of her penchant for secrecy, driven by being under constant partisan attacks for 30 years. I'd prefer if she were more transparent. I do not blame her in the slightest for not being so.This doesn't change the fact that she is the most qualified presidential candidate to run in my lifetime, or that her policies will be great for this country.Donald Trump is an actual criminal. His list of controversies are long, and show that he has a history of fraud, misogyny and vindictiveness. I'll take "too secretive" over that any day.
8 | Lloyd Hayes | 35 | 10155539078606509_10155539164036509 | The FBI investigation is into Anthony Weiner's emails. Not Hillary's. But I would like to hear more about the various investigations taking place against Donald Trump? Let's see, there is the TAX investigation, and several involving Trump University. Isn't there an anti-trust investigation concerning him?
9 | Jose S Vargas | 61 | 10155539078606509_10155539100016509 | I really hope that after Drump loses the elections she gets a big fat check in the mail for all the extra hard work that she is doing for the orange clown!
10 | David Myers | 36 | 10155539078606509_10155539116366509 | FBI playing politics should have everyone cursing the sky.  It's the most disturbing thing that has happened this entire absurd election cycle.
11 | Diane Collum | 32 | 10155539078606509_10155539120751509 | This woman is pure evil and wouldn't know the truth about anything if it came up and bit her. It's like her brain is turned off when it comes to the truth about her boss Trump.
12 | Irving Tiffany | 27 | 10155539078606509_10155539188581509 | If Donald Trump thinks we will have 650 million immigrants if we elect Hillary Clinton (thereby tripling the U.S. population), then he is mentally challenged and he must have flunked junior high math and geography.
13 | Paul Wyatt | 20 | 10155539078606509_1127372427317445 | Why dont CNN report that Trump got a court date on December 16, 2016 for raping a 13 year old girl in 1994. This is crazy that this sleaze bag Trump is marching around this country like he is sqeeky clean and the media is just letting him do it. Rape is a serious charge and Trump has to face the judge less than 50 days........
14 | Lou Casa | 19 | 10155539078606509_10155539107206509 | I'm sure once the election is over and Humpty Trumpy LOST she will use her 15 seconds of fame to try and sue him for groping her too. #Trashattractsmoretrash #dispicablehumanbeingsthebothofthem
15 | David Shine | 35 | 10155539078606509_10155539107581509 | Really ? What about the sexual predator you are supporting ????? I would rather have a selfish woman than a narcissist pathological liar scum job that Trump is... give it up !!
16 | Carol Andersen | 12 | 10155539078606509_10155539249141509 | So, Trump might or might not have the e-mails against Hillary. E-mails that so far are nothing. I have a mile list of real reasons for not voting for Trump.  From his treatment of women,  to his proudness of never paying federal taxes.Federal taxes that are the only support of our armed forces.  Now, Trump wants to be commander in chief of the same military he never economically supported? As a wife and mother of veterans, I find that more than disgusting! I'm voting blue all the way regardless of e-mails!
17 | Kevin Bautista | 23 | 10155539078606509_10155539118786509 | CNN is so Corrupt! You can try to terminate Donna Brazil for giving Hillary Clinton the debate questions more than once...whatever..your whole network is a flop.In fact, it is now known that news networks under the disguise of freedom operates under curruption to influence voters. Wake up viewers: when the media is currupt and can influence voters we no longer have a democracy what we have is the illusion of the democarcy
18 | Kevin Street | 27 | 10155539078606509_10155539118036509 | Trump deplorables are hoping this is the bombshell that will make Hillary go away and Trump can casually walk into the WH Presidency. Now back to earth those emails are not bigger than watergate as Fox suggest, sheesh these idiots just don't get it, we do not want that orange stain in the WH
19 | Faye Matthews | 21 | 10155539078606509_10155539141416509 | This latest stunt by Comey should totally energize Democrats to vote for Hillary. I am voting McMullin but if I was a Democrat I would be excited to vote for Hillary. You do not crucify someone for not following office procedure and put someone like Trump in office. He is mental.
20 | Shawn Murphy | 14 | 10155539078606509_10155539190831509 | Just remember if Hillary wasn't corrupt there would be no reason for the FBI to even investigate her in the first place . I don't think upstanding politicians are cannon fodder for FBI inquires . But I guess logic doesn't play well with you liberals .
21 | Calvin Anderson | 5 | 10155539078606509_10155539100946509 | The Democrats are blaming the director of the FBI Democrats are blaming the Republican committee for leaking it out trying to undermine America's democracy we plan to unseat many members Republicans House and Senate and we plan to use what they did on the campaign Trail

25 | Bau Pham | 10 | 10155539078606509_10155539121331509 | Attention!, very important for patriotism American citizens in Texas to make sure!, don't assume or underestimated, it's depending on your vote, just a reminder that concerns.Don't be confusing!, Trump's USE Hillary email excuses to trick_or_treater stealing your votes, disgusting....Also!, YouTube shown on Barack Obama campaign 2008. Hillary attack. Trump's represent for presidential to racist matters and these are many things evil disgusting, dangerous, Trump's cares no one but himself, also planning to tore American communities into sections. My opinion to protect America history all in votes for Madam Hillary President 2016-2020 is the best honestly appreciation.

The newest Uber driver in Pittsburgh isn't a person -- but a Volvo XC90. http://cnn.it/2eOKC8R Via CNNTech
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Jonathan Rezach | 49 | 10155538957896509_10155538978616509 | Hell no. There's no way they can make these things safe. Guaranteed massive accidents with self driving cars. Not to mention the elimination of hundreds of thousands of jobs
2 | Mark Rubello | 30 | 10155538957896509_10155538981771509 | the only time self driving cars will be safe is when every car is self driving.  as long as idiots are on the road, I want 100% control.
3 | Andrea Benalcazar Barcia | 8 | 10155538957896509_10155538986311509 | I'd never get one of these cars or go in one of these cars because technology has its flaws even cars now a days have recalls and I personally have had horrible dreams about these kind of cars before like accidents going off Highway turns over the rail. So no way. No thanks.
4 | Anthony Velasquez | 9 | 10155538957896509_10155538966761509 | Technology has the potential to solve so many problems facing society. I am excited for the future. Also it's an article about self driving technology, it's not meant to be political, so chill out...
5 | Alex Mozaffarzadeh | 1 | 10155538957896509_10155539274811509 | Hell no ... those automated interactive voice customer service is enough... for me best part of uber ride is chatting with drivers. Also I can't imagine what will happen when Russian hacker decide to having little fun with uber :/
6 | Baraka Nyantori | 2 | 10155538957896509_10155539286806509 | Uber was like "we built the platform to give people more jobs, tech like this give everyone a chance of earning money" now they are trying to replace all drivers with an AI after becoming a billion dollar company.Now waiting for AirBnB to build their own houses.
7 | Osayi Israel Elegon | 1 | 10155538957896509_10155540327731509 | A company that made money and built it's brand out of hard working Americans would now dispose these Americans and replace them with machines. This is corporate self-centered greed and it's only an indication of what more to expected
8 | Tasos Anastasiou | 1 | 10155538957896509_10155539215246509 | What happens if you want to throw up while you're in this robot taxi. Does it understand "Pull Over Quick" or you just throw up in the car?? People are gonna throw up on purpose in these cars and say "Well the robot wouldn't pull over, i didn't have a choice" :) What about privacy, are there going to be any cameras inside these Robot Taxis??. No Thanks. Imagine reading your emails on your tablet or phone and a 4K camera is recording them.
9 | Josue Salas | 1 | 10155538957896509_10155538980481509 | This is gonna be a big fail. No one better than a human driver which the rider can tell the Uber driver which is the best and easiest route to take. Not to mention that a human can't be hacked or tampered with.
10 | John Lane | 3 | 10155538957896509_10155538998731509 | So many lives will be saved if we develop this technology. I was the victim of a accident that changed my life forever. They could have automated lanes and driver lanes. Traffic could be minimized etc etc
11 | Jorge Roca | 1 | 10155538957896509_10155539348966509 | I see a lot of ignorant comments when it comes to self driving cars. My guess is that people don't realize that Nearly 1.3 million people die in road crashes each year, on average 3,287 deaths a day. An additional 20-50 million are injured or disabled. And that self driving cars would drastically reduce these unnecessary deaths and injuries due to human drivers.
12 | ለይኩን ለይኩን | 0 | 10155538957896509_10155539980581509 | Uber get this level of success with the help of the drivers and now ready to get ride of them with self driving cars. As technology become dominant, the need for human involvement will diminished and God knows what kind of job the future generation will have other than techno...
13 | Lisa Smith | 1 | 10155538957896509_10155539127441509 | New movie idea here. Futuristic thriller. Self driven Uber cars get hacked all around the world by evil terrorist group. Chaos and death ensue for millions as hackers play out mass smash em up demolition derby.
14 | Nirmalya Banerjee | 0 | 10155538957896509_10155539132666509 | The road infrastructure and traffic are not built for self driven cars! The automation here is still a wobbly toddler!   Try those for testing, but don't make us guinea pigs! !!
15 | Grace Gonzalez | 0 | 10155538957896509_10155540931266509 | I am all for advancement in technology but this will take away from jobs that are so desperately needed! We need to create more jobs not continue to find ways to dehumanize them!!!
16 | Toni Kashmer | 0 | 10155538957896509_10155538984226509 | Ya right TRUMP does and Hillary is a lying cow that deserves to be in prison. Car seems cool though. I will pass and trust the judgment of a person driving.
17 | Lisa Smith | 0 | 10155538957896509_10155539113701509 | So Uber is saying that they don't have to inform you or get your consent to be driven around in a driverless vehicle.  Seems to me that it would be mandatory to tell you beforehand.
18 | Zabi Habash | 3 | 10155538957896509_10155538974061509 | I remember once when my dad gave me money to pay the electricity bill but instead i bought a raffle ticket for a brand new car. When i got home,i explained to my dad what i did and he beat the crap out of me. But the next day,when my dad woke up and opened the door,outside my house was a brand new car. We all cried especially me,because the car was from the electricity company,they were there to cut off the electricity, my dad beat the crap out of me again
19 | Toure L Muhammad | 0 | 10155538957896509_10155539774901509 | You guys sound like when the old ppl talked against the Wright  Brothers..."You will never get that contraption to fly"...#embracechange
20 | Jarden Godfrey | 0 | 10155538957896509_10155539347916509 | People should stop making or bringing too much technology. You may think that the world would be better with too much tech. No...Instead you will end up destroying the whole planet. Do you think that self-driving cars will help too much? NOooo.
21 | MissRaelene Paris | 0 | 10155538957896509_10155539319906509 | As you know...  this is the Eve before America sees a November it has NEVER EVER seen before ... We are 8, EIGHT, eight whole days guys! Before election... Whether you like to believe it or not ... we are at a major turning point not only as American Citizens but as a whole country... our America! In light of the fact that we have recently bred such a narcissistic generation that believes their opinion is sooooooooooo important & must be shared through the abundance of social media resources & platforms... My agenda here is not to "right" although that is usually the reason ANY argument is posed. I understand that sharing political views is not usually proper, social etiquette. esp. via social media. However, Can we just talk about the fact that my heart is severely and deeply sorrowed by the lack of morals and ethics in this country this day in age? There is absolutely zero reason why we as a country should have to sit back & observe San Bernadino & Orlando shootings. Zero Reason to observe innocent men of color or minorities being shot down just so we can turn around & then see  that police are the victims of shootings. Zero reason why we should have to start a "black lives matter" movement because TRUTH IS ... WE ALL MATTER ... & Zero reason why we must witness the most wild, chaotic debate in the history of this country!!!!!!!!! IF ALL OF US ... went ahead & just displayed LOVE.... showed a little more compassion & decided against our ugly selfishness.... America can be a rock solid foundation to birth future Generations of prosperity, wealth, health & Happiness.... It is time we come together in Unity rather than allowing a Pokémon Go game to unite us. This generation of ... "I can freely think, do whatever I want when I want, be who I want because it's convenient to me, act how I want, behave how I want, treat others how I want" has only birthed a generation with lack of morals & respect. Those who think that way need to be LOVED on. They are hurting. Rather than annihilating them with our words we ought to just LOVE on them. My heart hurts as to what liberal America has turned to... Anyways if you made it this far in the post ... kudos to you & thank you for your time... But when you hit the polls on the 8th please, first & foremost thank you for doing your duty as a citizen, but please stand for what is right after you have loved a little more this week, showed a bit more compassion & removed yourself from your selfishness.... where can our Country go with a mindset like this?!?!!!!! Lastly, & please state your opinions & debate me on this & if you feel the need share your frustrations .... but in the most HUMBLE way possible & with ALL DUE RESPECT friends Donald Trump will be winning. It is his God given & appointed time to turn America back to the father... The first 3 letters of his name is TRU & boy does AMERICA need so much more of TRUTH now than ever... America must operate in whatsoever is true, honest, pure & lovely ... I love you all dearly... seriously every single one of you on here ... I am so sure he will win that I am willing to lay down my life on the fact. I can even bet money that he will ... comments welcome please!!!!  Donald J. Trump #tagafriend
22 | Josée Touchette | 3 | 10155538957896509_10155539009756509 | New technologies = less jobs. Much easier to inovate in technology with new gadgets than find solutions to poverty and new treatments for cancer and other medical problems
23 | Shumon Hossain | 0 | 10155538957896509_10155540347856509 | Not cool. Wasting that much money?  What about those who will become unemployed? Cities should force them to build more schools, hire more teachers, hospitals etc instead.
24 | Michael Miranda | 2 | 10155538957896509_10155538961831509 | Imagine it is November 9, 2016 in America and we wake up knowing who our new President will be. If it is Hillary, think of the groups of people that will celebrate. Illegal Immigrants, criminals and future criminals who will be supported for pulling a gun on a police officer, planned parenthood, the media, and the list goes on and on that represent everything that is wrong with America. If you're still "with her," look around at who you'll be celebrating with. Now imagine waking up knowing that Trump is our new President. You may or may not like him, or really know what kind of president he will be. But here are some things you will know for sure:• The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.• The media has been neutered forever.• Career politicians will have lost all job security.• The guns in your home will safely stay there.• Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.• Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally• Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.• No more apologies to the world for being great!• Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.• Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.• There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.• The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.• The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.Copy and paste this as your status if you support and will vote Donald Trump for president 2016.
25 | Deanna Osborn | 0 | 10155538957896509_10155539004266509 | CNN issues a statement saying it has dumped Donna Brazile after 2nd WikiLeaks email reveals her rigging debate questions for Hillary Clinton !!!!!!!!And then it's total silence, they won't even talk any further about it. This is a total disgrace for them.

A stark new report from the WWF shows there's already been a 58% decline since 1970.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Lee Pintor | 78 | 10155538905001509_10155538910221509 | Hillary Clinton is a threat to American Democracy (what's left of it) and world peace. A vote for her is a vote for worldwide economic slavery and evil, endless war! She's a corrupt, evil, lying warmonger who already has blood on her hands of thousands of people and millions of dollars of blood money in the Clinton Foundation. #NeverHillary
2 | Ovidiu Drobotă | 60 | 10155538905001509_10155538905181509 | I voted for Bernie Sanders. I am still sad because I can not understand why so many people voted for Hillary instead of Bernie. Now we have different election. Trump will win. But please tell me this: why did you vote for Hillary and not for Sanders?
3 | Rick Stoeckel Jr. | 29 | 10155538905001509_10155538918536509 | Just stop all this BS.. They are still finding species that we never knew existed. This 'Humans are bad hysteria" is pathetic... I think CNN should power down, and get back into horseback and telegraph. At least Donna Brazile would have to learn Morse Code..
4 | Kelsey Gallegos | 19 | 10155538905001509_10155538938876509 | Piss on CNN, crooked news organization that gives Hillary the questions before the debate. This organization is SCUM!!! CNN has no ethics, no morals, no scruples, no character, and no class. SHAME SHAME SHAME!!!
5 | Warren McDonald | 10 | 10155538905001509_10155539030461509 | The most heartbreaking part of this is that more people are quibbling over which politician to hate more and ignoring the fact that we are making the planet uninhabitable and killing off species faster than any other extinction event in history. I fear we will only be fighting over which politician has the absolute backing of science and education, before anything else, after climate change has brought famine to the first worlds. Not even displacement over rising tides or loss of animal and plant life. Lose the food, lose your people.
6 | Ryan T. DaSilva | 4 | 10155538905001509_10155538959781509 | Yet nobody bats an eye. But let 1 puppy get hurt & the world freaking flips out! Newsflash ppl; if dogs go extinct the world keeps moving. The same can't be said for a lot of marine life that are crucial to the worlds food cycle. See how hungry you get is say plankton were to go bye bye!
7 | Brian Tipton | 26 | 10155538905001509_10155538911091509 | There is only one WWF. And thats the original World Wrestling Federation.
8 | Mc Cath Rite | 1 | 10155538905001509_10155540486096509 | open more labs , to increase aquatic and wild life populations, and put scientists to work, there are much students out in the world whom did do science at school and universities but not being employed, so thence here is the opportunity for gainful employments
9 | Joseph Kimrey | 0 | 10155538905001509_10155540110071509 | Two thirds of all animal life gone in six years?!? Gee, I'd better cut the WWF a big check so they can stop it.Thats pretty absurd claim, that sady, most people will subscribe to without applying rational thought.
10 | Stewart Geekie | 0 | 10155538905001509_10155539248236509 | I personally don't think it matters now what man does on this planet as the picture is already painted and hung on the wall.man is like a plaque of locusts devouring the earth.The earth can only sustain 1billion people and now there are almost 7 billion people destroying everything on it.soon all the animals will be gone,all the fish in the oceans,the forests and rain forests,in a hundred years there will be nothing left anyways.it won't matter if carbon taxes come in or not,the writing is on the wall.Why do you think scientists are looking to find another inhabitable planet so bad?to preserve mankind as it will be extinct just like the dinosaurs.and nothing man can do now can stop it from happening.outside of the complete stoppage of using carbon fuels and a lottery to find out who out of the almost 7 billion people gets to live and who gets to go to sleep permantly.I feel sorry for anyone being born right now as they may not get to live out their normal life and just could be around when it's the end of mankind !!!!The earth will always be here but man won't!!!!!
11 | Mary Mowry | 2 | 10155538905001509_10155538943321509 | How can we trust any liberal organization to tell the truth.  They are globalist that use fraud to get Amerian tax money. Take up donations and see if you can change anything.

11 | Kevin Bautista | 0 | 10155538854256509_10155538887571509 | Reparations owed for “Racial Terrorism” says UN Committeeby Phoebe Braithwaite (United Nations, )Monday, October 31, 2016Inter Press ServiceUNITED NATIONS, Oct 31 (IPS) - Stressing the enduring relationship between injuries inflicted by slavery and contemporary injustices, a UN committee has recently issued a strongly-worded call for reparations for black U.S. Americans."A systemic ideology of racism ensuring the domination of one group over another continues to impact negatively on the civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights of African Americans today," said the UN Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent, in a report released in August.So far this year 212 black people have been killed by police in the United States, according to statistics collected by The Guardian. This is almost a quarter of the total 883 people killed by police in 2016, despite the fact that only14.4 percent of US Americans are of African descent.While only 6.5% of the US population are African American men, they constitute 40.2% of prison populations, according to Ana DuVernay's recent film 13TH. While 1 in 17 white men can expect to go to prison in their lifetime, one in three black men can expect to be incarcerated.The group's report, which focuses especially on police brutality against black Americans as "reminiscent of the past racial terror of lynching," makes 35 diverse recommendations, from establishing sovereign human rights commissions to the reinstatement of voting rights of former felons.Yet critics question whether the liberal human rights paradigm can adequately address this kind of cruelty and oppression, originating as it does in 20th century Europe, where fascism had recently taken root, and in light of Europe's own role in creating and perpetuating racial injustice."In the era of the Atlantic slave trade," says Andrew Johnson, Professor of African American Studies at Harvard University, "new notions of difference – absolute, racial notions of difference – were used to define, describe, and justify the political economy of slavery, articulating the centrality of racism in capitalist exploitation."Demands for reparations have been largely ignored in the political mainstream. A bill, HR-40, introduced in 1989 to establish a commission examining the "fundamental injustice, cruelty" and brutality of slavery has gained little traction – though the UN committee recommends its passage through Congress. Last year, then-presidential candidate democratic socialist Bernie Sanders dismissed the question of reparations saying that it wouldn't get through Congress and would be "too divisive".Noting Sanders' determination to push the boat out on issues of class, celebrated writer and proponent of reparations Ta-Nehisi Coates deplored this lack of political imagination: "I thought Sanders's campaign might remind Americans that what is imminently doable and what is morally correct are not always the same things, and while actualising the former we can't lose sight of the latter," Coatessaid.He urged that class-based solutions are inappropriate to address "racial plunder" – borne out by the fact that the median income for African American households ($36,898) is almost half their white counterparts ($62,950). The median net worth of black families, $4,900, versus white families, $97,000, reveals an even starker difference.Movement for Black LivesThe Movement for Black Lives, a coalition of over 50 black-led organisations, has set out five key requests which would begin to restore what has been being stolen "since the time that the first black person was kidnapped from the shores of Africa," in the words of Black Panther Angela Davis.They focus especially on education, a particular site of harm since it was made illegal to teach enslaved people to read, a law which began in South Carolina in 1740 and was punishable by death in Louisiana. Since then, owing to redlining policies and explicit disinvestment in primarily-black schools, African Americans have continued to suffer from worse educational opportunities, with black students expelled at three times the rate of white students."You're more likely to walk into your hallway and interact with a police officer – in a school – than a guidance counselor," Kesi Foster, Coordinator at the Urban Youth Collaborative, and contributor to the policy recommendations for the Movement for Black Lives' demand for reparations, told IPS, saying that in New York, there is one guidance counselor for every 322 students, but a police officer for every 192 students.These officers are more prevalent in schools with metal detectors, which are usually primarily non-white. Describing what is often called the ‘school-to-prison pipeline', Foster says that reparative justice could begin by defunding the COPS programme which stations police in schools in line with the perception that black and brown males are "inherently dangerous".ReparationsAfter the end of the American Civil War in 1865, people who were formerly enslaved were given forty acres of tillable land – and, sometimes a mule. But after Abraham Lincoln's assassination the same year, his successor Andrew Johnson reversed Lincoln's directive for redistribution.Calls for reparations have a long history proceeding from this date, and have tended to focus on material restitution, which makes the Movement for Black Lives' emphasis on education salient. "Not only is there no curriculum recognition about the real history of our country… but there's also no cultural recognition," Foster says. "In Germany and other places... where really atrocious things have taken place, there are markers."They call for "mandated public school curriculums that critically examine the political, economic, and social impacts of colonialism and slavery, and funding to support, build, preserve, and restore cultural assets and sacred sites to ensure the recognition and honoring of our collective struggles and triumphs."It is clear that fulsome reparations for the continued atrocities perpetrated against people of African descent are not about to be freely given simply because whites are made to see the error of their ways. In the words of Mariame Kaba, organiser, educator and founder of Project NIA, speaking at a recent conference on the disproportionate effect the war on drugs has had on black communities, "the system can't indict itself. You can't think that the system that is killing you is going to save you."Kaba, who helped in the fight for plaintiffs' justice in the Burge torture trials, discussed the extensive public apology that was eventually won by some of those Burge tortured, and the history's inclusion in Chicago's curriculums, demonstrating the essential role honest expressions of responsibility can play in processes of healing for black communities who have been brutalised by the state.But the Movement's foremost demand is for the "full and free access for all Black people (including undocumented and currently and formerly incarcerated people) to lifetime education" in its every form, including the "retroactive forgiveness of student loans".Professor Harold McDougall, who teaches law at Howard University, has, among many others, argued for the necessity of black-only education. McDougall would like to see Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), like Howard, funded to set up "Reparations Academies" for the descendents of people who were "damaged by educational racism". This is a practical measure as much as it compounds Stokely Carmichael and Charles Hamilton's view that "group solidarity is necessary before a group can operate effectively from a bargaining position of strength".

Enron Executives were caught shredding and deleting information - they are still serving prison sentences!Hillary and Huma destroyed 13 phones, deleted 33,000 emails, wiped a private server clean, withheld a laptop and lost two other laptops that were under FBI subpoenas!!! And Hillary is still running for President! Puts the corruption in perspective doesn't it!

14 | Riya Sharma | 13 | 10155538792146509_10155538795716509 | Remember when Trump was laughed at for saying Hillary had the questions ahead of time? Remember when he said Weiner had access to Hillary's classified emails? Remember when he said Hillary cheated Bernie out of the nomination BEFORE wikileaks confirmed it. Trumps been right about everything from the start.

20 | Eugene Ingram Jr. | 0 | 10155538792146509_10155539223006509 | That's 50 miles if you average flight speed for such a short flight, since takeoff and landing and reaching cruising altitude takes up a big part of a short flight.
