No one responds in writing to lie, and needing to pretend liies with various natures of courts, and with their family members involved, and how.  All stand from bow.  Here many prayed.  Hey, look rook. Night hooks here. The kinds are stayed awes. There is no brook in Brooklyn. Asphalt is the cause. There is no brook in Brooklyn. I looked. It ain't sent. They would not let Kaepernick take a knee, and/or nor to use correlation. "Criminal insidiousness" loves guise, and loves humbleness, and with/as multi-front aggression/terror natures only let realized to all areas, and not by accident. No quarterback is safe. No one is not terrorized, and worse, and for trying to protract correlation, showing lies. It needs and wants we claim this prejudice, too, fact treatments that cannot protract, or stand. One way we can. I have a good video uploading about this, too, in two hours. I have songs about it, and have an organized crime conversation gathering. Please subscribe to my youtube channel. I will also be uploading the new video here in a couple of hours. Kaepernick kneels. They call him up to terrors guise, and as it deep. Here none are true.

Police are investigating after they say a decomposed and headless body was found underneath several inches of garbage inside this home.

1 | Bill Sortino | 1 | 10154033788010950_10154033811935950 | OK! Since CBS has not reported what is going on, maybe we can address it here? We have a candidate for President who is scheduled for a Federal trial in November for Racketeering! That same candidate is scheduled for a Federal trial in December for child RAPE! This is the same candidate that has lied about everything he has said for over the last 10 years and whose has about 500 open lawsuits against him! Now we have a factual report from ABC that there has been millions of dollars flowing from Russia to Trump and back! I did not vote for Bill Clinton and I was never going to vote for Hillary, but because of Trump, I have to go that way. If you actually think that somehow some emails are worse than being a rapist and a child molester, then there is nor moral value to your character and whatever someone does is fine. If you think that being a sleazy and corrupt businessman, with absolutly no ethical principles is unimportant, then you will see what will happen if Trump wins.Here is the report on the Russian connection. This is actually treason because of the hacking and his request to have them hack! http://occupydemocrats.com/2016/10/31/october-surprise-abc-uncovers-millions-payments-russia-trump/

3 | Sharon DelBrocco | 0 | 10154033788010950_10154033890955950 | We all share this life together. To respect each other, appreciate each other, let each be themselves, be comfortable in your own skin makes for comfort and peace. No one is better than the other. If you are uncomfortable in someone's company...walk away. Be a leader for you and be able to weed your own garden in this life to make room for the flowers. Men are the product of their environment and some women like to be the temptresses. Go beyond the sex and see the real person. We don't all 'connect'...some are meant to be alone. Go beyond what they call 'norm' and decide, make the choice, for you. Always be aware of what is around you and do not wear your heart on your sleeve so others can hurt you. You will not be disappointed because it is a good thing. I know...I've been there.
4 | Eddie Kay | 3 | 10154033788010950_10154033794250950 | I remember once when my dad gave me money to pay the electricity bill but instead i bought a raffle ticket for a brand new car. When i got home,i explained to my dad what i did and he beat the crap out of me. But the next day,when my dad woke up and opened the door,outside my house was a brand new car. We all cried especially me,because the car was from the electricity company,they were there to cut off the electricity, my dad beat the crap out of me again
5 | Denisa Aver | 0 | 10154033788010950_10154033820180950 | Bill Sortino even the Hillary loving NYT says this isn't true! Seriously have u done any Hillary research & all she has gotten away with? Trump has never been convicted, remember innocent until proven guilty! Is it wrong not to want to keep your money out of the hands of a goverment that does nothing but put us deeper in debt! Look up what they did with Social security funds they we paid into for years! Have u thought about why Hillary was taken off the job & it was given to John Kerry? health, lies, what exactly? Have u seriously considered Kaine having to step in & be President? Dems. gave billions of taxpayer dollars to Iran while they burned our flag & chanted death to America & still do, til this very day, even after getting our money? What do u think they will do with that money? Buy Nukes of course! The Cuban Leader would not even shake Obama's hand after he got our money! Dems. watched as Obama released prisoners we know are terrorist & didn't say a word to prevent it! They will be back to fight us again! Do u know what Sharia law is? Muslims want to replace the U.S. constitution with it! Dems. want to bring in thousands more refugees while our ppl & our vets go hungry! Healthcare cost is ridiculous!Where are our jobs? While the Democratic party were passing illegal executive orders they should have been working on getting jobs back in this country! Instead they have EPA the jobs away! Utube what's happening in Germany w refugees! Native ppl are told not to go out at night because refugees are robbing & groping German women on the streets! PLZ DO SOME RESEARCH BEFORE U BRING THIS ON OUR COUNTRY! Neither of the candidates are the best we have! but at least we know Trump loves this country! The democratic party has harmed this country! Try living w/o police they have declared war on the cops! Plz sit back & think all that has happened in the past 8 years. They tell us to defy the words of God & it will be ok! Do u believe our CREATOR has changed HIS mind & sin can go on w/o being punished? PLZ research Hillary she is even worst than Trump! PLZ ppl chaos is in our country & another 4-8 years of dems will kill this country!

Each day more comes out in print, in reputable sources, yet not a single statement on TV news programs.  Why? Alleged private email server use versus alleged child molester as President?  Is that really a question?  In the spirit of, dare I say, fairness, the American public needs to hear about Trump's allegations, too.

Zayn has been public about his battle with anxiety. But the singer says he was also struggling with even more behind-the-scenes.

1 | Martha O'Brien | 1 | 10154033721850950_10154033777120950 | People can be horses butts...they think that anxiety is a made up thing...anxiety can & will do dangerous things to your body & mind...I watch someone that I love deal with it, ptsd, & border line personality disorder daily...some people over eat, some people don't eat, some cut themselves, & they're not freaks...it is a coping mechanism that kicks in to help them somewhat deal with day to day life...you call them pussy's but if you saw one you love going through it, or if it happened to you then maybe you would understand...I don't know who this young man is, never heard of him..But it takes nerve to speak about these things...most can live a normal life, & you would never know...but some become hermits, because some people are horses butts!!!
2 | True Poizon | 0 | 10154033721850950_10154033821070950 | Hey Voters, a few things to remember when voting:----There is no such thing as a wasted vote. Refusing to vote 3rd party because you think they have no chance, isnt cool. Even if you write in a candidate, thats not a wasted vote. Your vote is your vote.----Secondly, voting for Trump simply because you dont like Clinton....or Clinton simply because you dont like Trump, isnt cool either. It's very irresponsible. Only vote for someone if you truly like them. We arent voting on Class President here lol, we are voting for the leaders of our Nation here.----Third, I'll keep repeating it: You would be fired from your job (or in jail) if you did what either of these two front runners did. Do you really want to vote for special treatment of the elite, and unfairness?----Four: Lets say Clinton does win (which I predict unfortunately), what does it matter if Congress is Republican? And vice versa.  ----Finally, every 4-8 years we elect someone thinking they'll magically change the USA, and change never happens. Real change doesnt really happen in cubicles or voting booths anymore, it happens in the streets and households. Spread the word.

‚ÄúIf they want to look at some more emails of one of my staffers, by all means go ahead! Look at them,‚Äù Clinton said during a rally.

1 | Bishoy Khazen | 104 | 10154033657400950_10154033665395950 | This lady is going to receive what she deserves from God one day, for all the evil things she has done...
2 | Cody Carter | 88 | 10154033657400950_10154033663875950 | Tim Kaine(Hillary's VP) gets 30 people at his Florida rally. Bill Clinton yesterday held a campaign speech on youtube/facebook livestream that had a total of 49 viewers. On the other hand, TRUMP held a rally yesterday that had over 15k supporters in physical attendance, and had 150k+ streaming on the internet... Which person has the enthusiasm?
3 | Timothy Navarre | 33 | 10154033657400950_10154033693565950 | Hillary Clinton has proven herself to be a PATHOLOGICAL LIAR! How someone could bring themselves to vote for her is beyond me! I've been a Democrat my entire life but the writing on the wall is too clear to ignore, red flags everywhere around her.
4 | Melinda Martinez | 33 | 10154033657400950_10154033668550950 | Does it matter? Hillary could eat those late term butchered babies that she supports  and her Brainwashed Basement Dwellers, Taco bowl Engagement and super predators would still support her.
5 | Debra Rishel | 4 | 10154033657400950_10154033709105950 | What a mess this election has become. Rumors and innuendo abound, people need facts which they likely will not have before the election. This is why this should not have come out so close to election day. If this investigation turns up no wrong doing how will we know what effect it had on the election results and how this impacts the country in the future. It's just plain wrong.
6 | Connie Swan Conrad | 3 | 10154033657400950_10154033698655950 | They checked those already when they checked the stuff that went back and forth on Hillarys end so this is just a bunch of hogwash close to the election to try to get an upset for Drumpf
7 | Ricky Smith | 5 | 10154033657400950_10154033739530950 | Clinton knows nothing will be known about this investigation until after the election, so she saying nothing to see here. Most likely there's some of the 33,000 emails she "BleachBit " off of her servers in the 650,000 emails on the Weiner laptop. Which will expose her for the crook that she is.
8 | Gaines Liner | 11 | 10154033657400950_10154033689460950 | Was it a double standard in 1992 when Casper Weinberger (Sec of Defense, Bush 41) was indicted two days before the election?  The statute of limitations had expired but a (D) DA went forward knowing that it was bogus. Bill Clinton jumped all over it, claiming the Bush administration a "culture of corruption" and it turned the election. So what the FBI did on Fri is not "unprecedented" as Hillary said. The Clintons have done that, and worse....
9 | Jimmy Torrez | 0 | 10154033657400950_10154033891445950 | There is a double standard, anyone who handled classified information so carelessly then destroyed evidence in the face of a subpoena would be in jail. You don't have to vote for the lesser of two evil, vote for someone with integrity. Vote Gary Johnson
10 | Patricia Alzate Arcuri | 2 | 10154033657400950_10154033784830950 | Listen, I believe that God is giving us another chance. The election time is here. This not a fight against two individuals. This is war against good and evil. Hillary is evil. If we do not vote against her, we will set into motion God's Word's to Jeremiah. "Behold, I am fashioning a disaster & devising a plan against you. Return now everyone from his evil way, & make your ways & your doings good." Vote. Dont sit at home! This is the most important vote of your life. Don't vote for Hillary. Vote for the future of our children. Vote for the peaceful future of America. Vote for God to reign as Lord of America. Vote for healing our nation. Vote for strengthening our leadership. Vote against corrupt & incompetent traitors & treasonous evil in our land. Vote against Hillary. #StopKillingBabies #AbortionKills #NeverHillary #Savethehumans #MAGA
11 | John Scott | 0 | 10154033657400950_10154033892700950 | The only double standard is Clinton, she should of been prosecuted for having a server in her home with top secret government documents on it. Everyone else who did far less with just single pictures etc were prosecuted, she was not, because she is part of the political elite that don't obey the rules, and it's time they did. She should be arrested and hauled off to Leavenworth. Her husband should likewise, AG Loretta Lynch, and all other co conspirators in this treasonous act including those that set up the server, and had knowledge of the server including the President, Minority and Majority leaders of the House and Senate, and anyone else involved.
12 | Sandy Phillips | 5 | 10154033657400950_10154033796150950 | Hillary you think the American voters aren't paying attention, but believe it or not WE ARE!! And for you to blatantly think that we are too dumb to see you for who you really are, and try to pass this off as a deterrent to get you elected, you lady, are seriously WRONG!!
13 | Tamela Joyce VonHolten | 2 | 10154033657400950_10154033760645950 | All this isn't a double standard. Back in July all Trump supporters thought Comey was with Hillary-Dems by not pressing charges, now everyone is saying he is with the Republican party. All of you get over it. Hillary did this too herself nobody else to blame but her.
14 | Carl Epps | 8 | 10154033657400950_10154033665460950 | The democrats have a candidate that probably will be impeached if she is elected. It's pretty clear that now that Obama and Lynch are backing Comey, the evidence will be enough to convict Hillary. Obama will have to distance himself to save his legacy.
15 | Forest Williams | 0 | 10154033657400950_10154033840100950 | I can not wait until she trades in that red pant suit for an orange one.  If she did not want these issues she should have disclosed all emails as she has repeatedly said she did and not attempted to obstruct justice in much the same manner as she did in Arkansas.
16 | Mitzi Pulatie | 1 | 10154033657400950_10154033821940950 | This is pathetic CBS News , and it is sad for huma that she is being demoted to "staffer" sad but funny, because that is how killiary works. Throw them under the bus step over them and claw her way up.
17 | Mel Mae | 1 | 10154033657400950_10154033807120950 | Classic. Welcome to the world as we know it, Hillary. You defined double standard. The rest of us have to abide by the law, and you seemingly do not.
18 | Douglas Carter | 0 | 10154033657400950_10154033845240950 | WikiLeaks and Anonymous have her exposed already. The subpoena makes the FBI's access legal, so sure, now she claims the transparency thing. I'm not buying into anything she says at this point.
19 | Michael Braxton | 2 | 10154033657400950_10154033765380950 | I have double standards because she should have been in prison. She left the people in Benghazi to be murdered.
20 | Pat Lavery | 0 | 10154033657400950_10154033838565950 | I lost trust in main stream news media recently over our Situation in North Dakota and lost hope that any of these politicians tell the truth! 53 years old I am and I can honestly say we are screwed as Voting time is near!
21 | Mary L Campbell Barron | 1 | 10154033657400950_10154033781280950 | Double standard? Other people are serving time in jail for doing far less than Hillary and she cries double standard?????? One scandal after another for years and years and she has the audacity to even utter those words? Please.
22 | Cj Juarez | 1 | 10154033657400950_10154033822985950 | SURE WHY NOT! Hillary Clinton sent classified email to her staffer, something that is a clear violation of the law. Now a man who is married to one of her staffers who goes by the alias "Carlos Danger" had access to this classified information and could of leaked out anything to anybody. That's why she's being investigated, AGAIN... GET A CLUE LADY! Put her in jail already.
23 | Jack Carrenard | 0 | 10154033657400950_10154033691310950 | Director Comey is in cahoots with House Republicans to undermine the electoral process. The real question should be What did the Director know? And when did he know it? It turns out that the FBI knew for weeks about this new batch of emails. Comey waited until now to release the news so as to inflict as much damage to the Clinton campaign as possible. When told by his subordinates about deep troubling ties between the Russian Security Services and the Trump campaign, he refuses to publicize it for fear of hurting Trump's chances at the polls. DOUBLE STANDARD.
24 | Jayson Kinnison | 0 | 10154033657400950_10154033883800950 | If she would of never had a private server this would all be a mute point. And if she would have turned over the emails when she was ordered to do so by Congress this would be all a mute point. But ya lets blame the fbi...how can ANYONE think voting for her is a good idea?
25 | Randy Sanchez | 1 | 10154033657400950_10154033783770950 | Double standard???? How funny. The double standard was set when they didn't indite her the first. Any citizen that did what she did would be in an orange jumpsuit right now!

1 | Cody Carter | 52 | 10154033590555950_10154033597595950 | James Comes is the director of the FBI. He's investigating very serious crimes. Maybe if Hillary didn't set up a private server and sabotage classified info none of this would have happened? Blame everyone but Hillary (the person responsible)
2 | Laura Coleman | 32 | 10154033590555950_10154033605740950 | This is NO ONE fault but Hillary's. Not Wikileaks, not the Russians, not the Republicans, and not the FBI!  Hillary made a conscious decision to hide her information to get rich, and hide it from the American people! Clinton Cash!
3 | Blakeney Adams | 7 | 10154033590555950_10154033649290950 | He, as well as the rest of the FBI, are doing there jobs people. Perhaps the Democratic Party shouldn't have nominated a scandalous and shady person for there candidate. Hillary has no one to blame but herself.
4 | Kenny Southerlin | 8 | 10154033590555950_10154033642185950 | Director Comey didn't make the letter public.  Members of a congressional committee did.  Comey has actually bent over backward to NOT influence the election, but many people need a scapegoat and a distraction, as well as an excuse to get their own name in the headlines.
5 | Jack Carrenard | 3 | 10154033590555950_10154033670945950 | Director Comey is in cahoots with House Republicans to undermine the electoral process.

6 | Debra K Williams | 0 | 10154033590555950_10154033816585950 | It doesn't matter now. Trump has set the precedence. A country divided against itself . He can't even find unity in his own party . Looks like we have four years of hatred and division to look forward to. Dog eat dog, only the strong survive let the weak be trampled upon.
7 | Hall Bauer S B | 1 | 10154033590555950_10154033719070950 | A Clinton croney is overseeing the new email investigation. Nothing like the fox watching the hen house. This is farcical justice at best. "Clinton Campaign Chair Had Dinner With Top DOJ Official One Day After Hillary‚Äôs Benghazi Hearing‚Äù in which we reported that John Podesta had dinner with one of the highest ranked DOJ officials the very day after Hillary Clinton‚Äôs Benghazi testimony?It was Peter Kadzik.The day after Hillary Clinton testified in front of the House Select Committee on Benghazi last October, John Podesta, Hillary‚Äôs campaign chairman met for dinner with a small group of well-connected friends, including Peter Kadzik, who is currently a top official at the US Justice Department serving as Assistant Attorney General for Legislative Affairs.The post-Benghazi dinner was attended by Podesta, Kadzik, superlobbyist Vincent Roberti and other well-placed Beltway fixtures. The first mention of personal contact between Podesta and Kadzik in the Wikileaks dump is in an Oct. 23, 2015 email sent out by Vincent Roberti, a lobbyist who is close to Podesta and his superlobbyist brother, Tony Podesta. In it, Roberti refers to a dinner reservation at Posto, a Washington D.C. restaurant.  The dinner was set for 7:30 that evening, just one day after Clinton gave 11 hours of testimony to the Benghazi Committee.Podesta and Kadzik met several months later for dinner at Podesta‚Äôs home, another email shows. Another email sent on May 5, 2015, Kadzik‚Äôs son asked Podesta for a job on the Clinton campaign."
8 | Randy Sanchez | 1 | 10154033590555950_10154033796085950 | Why is it everyone else's fault but Hillarys. She's the one who committed the crime, lied about it, got special treatment by not getting charged, lied when she said there were no more emails or devices used to send or receive emails and now it's the FBI fault for all this. Typical liberal, take no responsibility for their actions.
9 | Joseph Harris | 5 | 10154033590555950_10154033610760950 | Headline should be: GOP Senator fails to realize Comey is biding his time and keeping investigation open until after Obama leaves office to recommend charges because Obama will simply pardon Clinton if she were to be indicted; sends vague letter so he can "find nothing" is Clinton wins to save his own career.
10 | Debra Vogt | 0 | 10154033590555950_10154033748445950 | Do you think that perhaps his notification of the OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE might have something to do with getting the warrant from Loretta (I plead the fifth) Lynch prior to the evidemce disappearing?
11 | Susan Brewer | 1 | 10154033590555950_10154033655265950 | What was vague about the letter? New evidence has come to light that may be pertinate to previous investigation. Happens all the time in cases of all discriptions.
12 | Barbara Lamarr | 0 | 10154033590555950_10154033750730950 | The FBI did the right thing. Nothing will happen to Hillary because there are to sets of rules . One for Hillary and one for you and me. If we did what she did we would be in jail.
13 | Jake Vanek | 9 | 10154033590555950_10154033597600950 | What's "not fair" is how the Clinton's have been getting away with everything for 30+ years.
14 | Carl Epps | 1 | 10154033590555950_10154033672285950 | The democrats have a candidate that probably will be impeached if she is elected.

15 | David Martinez | 1 | 10154033590555950_10154033820925950 | It's not his fault that the emails were saved to that computer, as some sort of insurance policy.  Most people who aren't fearing for their life or job don't copy emails, they just keep them on the server, not on their own hard drive.

22 | Gaines Liner | 8 | 10154033590555950_10154033601130950 | What's not fair is stonewalling and obfuscation and downright lies that Hillary used that created this mess in the first place. The blame is squarly on her.

2 | Cody Carter | 148 | 10154033545880950_10154033550845950 | If he didn't violate the law. If he took tax deductions and it was perfectly legal. What's wrong with that? Would any of you pay extra taxes you didn't have to? If it's such a big deal Hillary and Obama have changed the law in your many decades in government.. Ah that's right they didn't get that done did they? What Trump did was LEGAL
3 | Tammy Sue Collins Castro | 30 | 10154033545880950_10154033572485950 | Hillary had no time to change the laws that her husband put in place because she was too busy being a criminal.  She used the same laws to avoid paying taxes as well.   Time to move on from this crap!!!  There is way more important things going on in this election!!
4 | Jim Gavin | 33 | 10154033545880950_10154033548535950 | What a smart business man to use Hiliary's and Obamas tax laws to save money. BTW Did you know Hiliary is under investigation by the FBI? Did you know Hiliary was given the questions to the debates by Donna Brazile? Why don't we have any posts on that news??
5 | Imogene Aldridge Hall | 19 | 10154033545880950_10154033586785950 | I can say one thing for certain, the Republicans are an intelligent group of people. They noticed how Hillary Clinton's answers to questions in the debates seemed "rehearsed." They were 100% accurate in their revelation. CNN staffer Donna Brazile leaked the questions to Hillary Clinton. Oh, and that is probably why Hillary Clinton wore that smirky smile on her face. Like a fox coming out the hen house.

Mr. Trump does not think that taxpayers should file returns that resolve all doubt in favor of the I.R.S. And any tax experts that you have consulted are engaged in pure speculation.

Why don't you mention the taxes the Clinton ended up owing when Bill Clinton took office because they took some that were questionable and the IRS said no, no, no.

6 | S Kay Fisher | 0 | 10154033507995950_10154033569685950 | Comey has an insurrection on his hands beyond the ability of anyone to control. These mutinous senior FBI agents have enough dirt to toss Obama, Comey, Hillary and others in jail. They also loathe the idea of being subjected to Clinton in the future as they know they will be forced to perpetrate more cover-ups and stain the bureau even more. They presented Comey and Obama with a choice‚Ä¶ ‚Äúgive us Hillary‚Äôs head on a platter and we will be silent on Obama‚Äôs complicity in federal crimes [effectively a Nixon type pardon by omission of pursuit] and we will allow Comey to quietly be succeeded by a person of our choosing on an incoming Trump Administration.‚Äù OR ELSE THEY WILL GO PUBLIC. Comey could have been silent until after the election no matter what they found on Weiner‚Äôs laptop because they already have seen ALL the emails including the deleted ones. The fact that Comey is taking this action indicates that his hand is being forced and that he [and Obama] have accepted the terms offered by the insurrectionists in exchange for the face saving terms offered. This also dovetails with Assange saying his next batch [the FBI knows the contents of ALL of Podesta‚Äôs emails] will result in the arrest of Hillary. The FBI cannot weather another PR storm revealing them complicit in a cover-up. They also must be proactive and use Hillary‚Äôs arrest/indictment/forced withdrawal from the race as a lightning rod to quell a furious public by granting them their ‚Äòpound of flesh‚Äô. No one likes Hillary, and don‚Äôt think that the Pentagon is going to silently sit still as one of their 4-Star generals get ramrodded for MUCH less than Hillary did. They are aligned with the insurrectionists at the FBI. Comey and Obama‚Äôs hand is being forced. Hillary is toast and going to jail. You will know this is true within a few days because the sheriff is about to slap the cuffs on Hillary. Weiner‚Äôs laptop is just a cover story.

2 | Susan Brewer | 49 | 10154033479365950_10154033488035950 | Shes been groomed to lie, but its possible Weiner himself transferred her laptop content after looking up life insurance on hers.

I see charges of perjury up ahead.
9 | Michael Stevens | 2 | 10154033479365950_10154033577050950 | In a bad marriage that is careening off the road there is quite often a fair amount of household surveillance and interfamily  espionage going on. There is fair amount of technology available as well as the fact that most spouses have a fairly descent shot of guessing each others passwords, that one could imagine a scenario where perhaps Tony installed some kind of spyware on Huma's computer and he just captured all that e-mail in some sort of jealous obsession and never bothered erasing it from his proud-penis transmission device...

I believe the master minds behind are this rigged election are Hilary Clinton and Donald Trump. And they are fooling everyone into believing they are at each other throats. Just think how they been talking about how Donald hasn't been paying any taxes and take advantage of the loophole the same loophole that Hilary hasn't even tried to close. So if Clinton wins Donald Trump won't lose cause she'll keep forgetting on closing those loopholes and Donald Trump will keep on used them to his benefit. Don't be surprise if at the end of this election the Clinton's and the Trump's become best friends again, bigly!

All these emails, therefore will have already been vetted by the FBI, and James Comey knew this likelihood before he sent his infamous letter. There is no acceptable excuse for James Comey‚Äôs clear, intentional violation of The Hatch Act, which Congress passed to protect our republic from future excesses of, for instance, FBI Directors, using their sweeping powers to undermine our democratic processes and free elections. The only remedy The Hatch Act allows is the immediate removal of Director Comey from his position. NOW.

6 | Scott Lester | 22 | 10154033441390950_10154033499730950 | I know we don't have much to pick from this election BUT I honestly remain so amazed that people are willing to dive into a Hillary presidency knowing good and well the already ongoing deception of her and her campaign.  This family, reaching back to Bill as potus, has shamelessly displayed attempt after attempt to get away with every kind of deceit & dishonesty they possibly can - perjury, destruction of subpoenaed evidence, sexual assault, planting Trump rally spoilers, weapons to syria, benghazi lies, Bill Clintion's multiple affairs right in the white house, 20percent of clinton foundation money coming from ruthless sharia governed leaders who murder gays and terribly oppress women, rigging of debate questions with cnn, etc. geeeeeeezzzz.Yet the loyalty of clinton followers are in a cult of personality exactly like the one that followed after Hitler despite ethnic cleansing. Hitler told his following it was the right thing to do and the cult of personality followed right along like the sheep that they were.  Sick.
7 | Belinda Ransom-Davis | 20 | 10154033441390950_10154033528560950 | But here are the problems with a Trump presidency: FBI Comey can't discuss his investigation on Trump who has many scandals pending. But, he can bring up emails that Hillary didn't send and that he didn't read. His court hearing on Trump University, where he stole people's money, using not professionals, but felons and the like with no experience. Bribed 2 gov officials to not investigate and this hearing is end of Nov. In Dec, Trump has a court hearing in regards to raping a then 13 year old.His foundation isn't licensed, but has taken donor money, while using it for his legal bills and 2 painted portraits of himself. Won't show his taxes, even to the fact that he's able to, which would show much about the man he claims to be, taxes..ahem..hasn't paid, charities that he said he gave to, which they said never received any donations from him.Used illegals on his buildings, paying $4.00/hr, if they were paid. Failed to pay companies, workers, businesses, small co. who he purchased, then filed 4 bankruptcies washing his hands from it. Many women came out angry, after he said he was a sexual predator, able to do anything to women because he's a star. Used China steel instead of helping American businesses, and has his own and his daughter's clothing, etc made overseas, with all of his building's furnishings made in China.  Fact Checked he lies 85% every time he opens his mouth, and there is nothing that he claims he'll do is possible, while he reads Republican written speeches, since he has a 3rd grade vocabulary and rants incoherently, of racism, bigotry and hate.
8 | Walter Adams | 7 | 10154033441390950_10154033504045950 | Trump will be fair and tough with Russia, and hopefully he can bring an end to the notion that are two countries will always be adversaries. JFK talked about the same thing in a speech I listened to in a history class.
9 | RBryce Glenn | 9 | 10154033441390950_10154033515575950 | In words of President Ronald Reagan; trust, but verify! If Hillary Clinton must have an FBI body search, than verify if  Donald Trump pays taxes, launders $$ for Russia, pays back Trump University deposits, pays contractors or workers (as agreed), and doesn't abuse women. What's good for Hillary should be good for Donald.
10 | Janet Iannarone | 5 | 10154033441390950_10154033517705950 | I'll believe that when Comey does a news conference and tells us what that his investigation into any ties between Trump and Russia shows. Just as I don't believe there's anything pertinent on that laptop for Hillary. The investigation has not been reopened, there are new emails to read and clear. We have no idea what's on them.
11 | Joy Juaneza | 3 | 10154033441390950_10154033482090950 | What about ties between Putin and HRC. Recall that Russia acquired 20% of US uranium capacity through a deal made possible by Bill Clinton and approved by the then Secretary of State, HRC. The details are quite interesting - from the New York Times, no less.http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/24/us/cash-flowed-to-clinton-foundation-as-russians-pressed-for-control-of-uranium-company.html
12 | Eric Hancock | 7 | 10154033441390950_10154033483320950 | A guy with Trump's 'checkered' past protected by mob lawyers & advised by industry slime isn't going to leave a trail of bread crumbs leading to the Kremlin.  You won't be able to hang a sociopathic narcissist like Trump with facts: he has spent his career making such things disappear or go silent with pay offs, gag orders, or other means; legal or otherwise, all in defense of the 'brand'- to win at all costs.  His paper trail- the one he lets you see- will only tell one story, while his actions & character say the rest.  His flock, similar to religious true believers, aren't easily swayed by 'facts'- especially when they differ from the opinion of his REICH.
13 | Roy Roberts | 3 | 10154033441390950_10154033580000950 | "I hear that train a comin‚Äô It‚Äôs rollin‚Äô round the bend.Gonna pick up Mrs. ClintonAnd take her to the pen.They‚Äôll have her coronationMake her cell block queenHillary for prison...two thousand and sixteenThey‚Äôve got an orange pants suitHangin‚Äô on the wallAnd a cell for Bubba WillieJust a little down the hall.We‚Äôll put ‚Äòem in the big houseLock them up inside.Unless a whole lot of witnessesCommit suicide.Remember James McDougalAnd 20 or 30 moreAbout to testify, they found ‚Äòem dead upon the floor.Now they‚Äôre pilin‚Äô up the bodiesLike they did back thenThey want back in the White HouseHere we go again.Glue the china to the tableNail the table to the floorLock up all the silver‚Äòfore they haul it out the doorWhite trash in the White HouseBeats all I‚Äôve ever seen.Hillary for prisontwo thousand and sixteen."
14 | Rob Jones | 3 | 10154033441390950_10154033570455950 | Alternate headline: "FBI confirms the obvious". Nobody with a brain thought Trump was colluding with Putin... but plenty of Democrats did. Having exhausted that rabbit trail, it's time to focus on those hose corruption has been exposed instead of blaming their corruption on those that exposed it.Seriously. When the thermometer says it's 100 degrees outside, screaming at the thermometer for causing it just isn't bright.

Not sure how far it goes and what the link to Russia means as it was encrypted and the US testers are not hackers. This was posted by another news network yesterday. The FBI certainly would have the ability to get a warrent and find out what was involved... but only if they stop reading Anthony Weners emails.... :)http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/cover_story/2016/10/was_a_server_registered_to_the_trump_organization_communicating_with_russia.html

22 | Shelly Stephens | 0 | 10154033441390950_10154033559355950 | BS. He wants Hilary's emails but won't release his taxes. Who's worse? Trump had links to Russia. Those hacks did nothing to implicate Trump so it's obvious that the hacks are one sided and Trump has something to do with it. People are so dumb man? It's so obvious. And Trump condones it such a dark man.

11 | S Kay Fisher | 0 | 10154033394645950_10154033572730950 | Comey has an insurrection on his hands beyond the ability of anyone to control. These mutinous senior FBI agents have enough dirt to toss Obama, Comey, Hillary and others in jail. They also loathe the idea of being subjected to Clinton in the future as they know they will be forced to perpetrate more cover-ups and stain the bureau even more. They presented Comey and Obama with a choice‚Ä¶ ‚Äúgive us Hillary‚Äôs head on a platter and we will be silent on Obama‚Äôs complicity in federal crimes [effectively a Nixon type pardon by omission of pursuit] and we will allow Comey to quietly be succeeded by a person of our choosing on an incoming Trump Administration.‚Äù OR ELSE THEY WILL GO PUBLIC. Comey could have been silent until after the election no matter what they found on Weiner‚Äôs laptop because they already have seen ALL the emails including the deleted ones. The fact that Comey is taking this action indicates that his hand is being forced and that he [and Obama] have accepted the terms offered by the insurrectionists in exchange for the face saving terms offered. This also dovetails with Assange saying his next batch [the FBI knows the contents of ALL of Podesta‚Äôs emails] will result in the arrest of Hillary. The FBI cannot weather another PR storm revealing them complicit in a cover-up. They also must be proactive and use Hillary‚Äôs arrest/indictment/forced withdrawal from the race as a lightning rod to quell a furious public by granting them their ‚Äòpound of flesh‚Äô. No one likes Hillary, and don‚Äôt think that the Pentagon is going to silently sit still as one of their 4-Star generals get ramrodded for MUCH less than Hillary did. They are aligned with the insurrectionists at the FBI. Comey and Obama‚Äôs hand is being forced. Hillary is toast and going to jail. You will know this is true within a few days because the sheriff is about to slap the cuffs on Hillary. Weiner‚Äôs laptop is just a cover story.

3 | S Kay Fisher | 0 | 10154033327875950_10154033573340950 | Comey has an insurrection on his hands beyond the ability of anyone to control. These mutinous senior FBI agents have enough dirt to toss Obama, Comey, Hillary and others in jail. They also loathe the idea of being subjected to Clinton in the future as they know they will be forced to perpetrate more cover-ups and stain the bureau even more. They presented Comey and Obama with a choice‚Ä¶ ‚Äúgive us Hillary‚Äôs head on a platter and we will be silent on Obama‚Äôs complicity in federal crimes [effectively a Nixon type pardon by omission of pursuit] and we will allow Comey to quietly be succeeded by a person of our choosing on an incoming Trump Administration.‚Äù OR ELSE THEY WILL GO PUBLIC. Comey could have been silent until after the election no matter what they found on Weiner‚Äôs laptop because they already have seen ALL the emails including the deleted ones. The fact that Comey is taking this action indicates that his hand is being forced and that he [and Obama] have accepted the terms offered by the insurrectionists in exchange for the face saving terms offered. This also dovetails with Assange saying his next batch [the FBI knows the contents of ALL of Podesta‚Äôs emails] will result in the arrest of Hillary. The FBI cannot weather another PR storm revealing them complicit in a cover-up. They also must be proactive and use Hillary‚Äôs arrest/indictment/forced withdrawal from the race as a lightning rod to quell a furious public by granting them their ‚Äòpound of flesh‚Äô. No one likes Hillary, and don‚Äôt think that the Pentagon is going to silently sit still as one of their 4-Star generals get ramrodded for MUCH less than Hillary did. They are aligned with the insurrectionists at the FBI. Comey and Obama‚Äôs hand is being forced. Hillary is toast and going to jail. You will know this is true within a few days because the sheriff is about to slap the cuffs on Hillary. Weiner‚Äôs laptop is just a cover story.

7 | John-David Salmeier | 5 | 10154033298915950_10154033424840950 | Hillary deleted 33,000 emails (that were under an active federal subpoena), people are so surprised when some are recovered (new evidence found) the case reopens.The bigger question, why is Attorney General Loretta Lynch trying to kill it?
8 | Michael Braxton | 1 | 10154033298915950_10154033603030950 | How quickly we forget!  If you‚Äôre over 35, take a walk with me down memory lane‚Äîyou won‚Äôt believe what you have forgotten.  If you‚Äôre under 35, read on‚ÄîI promise you that you will be amazed at what you missed!   (By the way, sadly, this isn‚Äôt a joke.   I wish it was.)REMEMBER WHEN BILL CLINTON WAS PRESIDENT?(January 20, 1993 to January 20, 2001‚Äîtwo terms)When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over an attempt to reform health care. Her proposed plan was so bad that many Democrats came up with competing plans of their own in protest, and in spite of threats and intimidation, on September 26, 1994, the ‚ÄúHillarycare‚Äù bill was declared dead.This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million for studies, promotion, and other efforts.Then, President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general.  Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood‚Äîboth were forced to withdraw their names from consideration.  Next, she chose Janet Reno, which husband Bill described as "my worst mistake."  (Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.)Husband Bill also allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission‚ÄîLani Guanier was her selection. After considerable backlash from prominent Democratic senators concerning Ms. Guanier's radical views, Bill Clinton withdrew her name from nomination, stating that she did not represents the civil rights views that he had championed during his campaign.However, apparently a slow learner, husband Bill continued to allow Hillary to make more recommendations. She chose former law partners, Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department. Her selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kennedy was forced to resign.  (Is anyone wondering yet what her Supreme Court Justice appointments would be like?)Many younger voters will have no knowledge of "Travelgate," the first major ethics controversy during Bill‚Äôs presidency.Hillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend, Harry Thompson‚Äîbut the White House Travel Office refused to comply. She trumped up allegations of financial mismanagement and reported seven long-time White House employees to the FBI.  This ruined their reputations, got them fired, and caused a thirty-six month investigation. Eventually, most of the employees were reinstated and Clinton associates were forced out of the travel office. Only one White House employee, Billy Dale, was charged with a crime‚Äîthe enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds;  a jury acquitted him in less than two hours.Still not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House Security.  When Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies (Filegate) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff, suddenly Hillary and the President denied even knowing Livingstone, and of course, denied knowledge of drug use in the White House.Following this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents.Next, when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by Bill Clinton, Hillary was put in charge of the "bimbo eruption" and scandal defense. Let‚Äôs look at some of her more notable decisions in this regard . . . She urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation, they settled with Ms. Jones.  She refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor.  After $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr's investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs.  Hillary's devious game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for 'lying under oath' to a grand jury, followed by his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives.  Hillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, "I do not recall," "I have no recollection," and "I don't know" a total of 56 times while under oath.   (Sound familiar?)  After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had "mistakenly thought was hers."So you see, the email scandal and all of her malfeasance regarding the handling of Top Secret information, not to mention the "pay to play" schemes of the Clinton Foundation, are nothing new.  Hillary‚Äôs entire political career has been nothing but a web of lies, corruption and destruction in her quest for power.Is anyone else ready to say, ‚ÄúEnough is enough!‚Äù?But unfortunately, I‚Äôm sure her loyal fans will say, "What difference does it make?"

10 | Jamie Bosone | 1 | 10154033298915950_10154033648255950 | I don't see how her saying she "doesn't know" or "wasn't aware" how the emails ended up in a folder saved on her husband's computer helps their case. Doesn't that alone prove "gross negligence"?

13 | James Nelson | 0 | 10154033298915950_10154033401760950 | STEP 1)    Poisoning the wellPoisoning the well (or attempting to poison the well) is a fallacy where irrelevant adverse information about a target is preemptively presented to an audience, with the intention of discrediting or ridiculing everything that the target person is about to say. Poisoning the well can take the form of an (explicit or implied) argument, and is considered by some philosophers an informal fallacy.A poisoned-well "argument" has the following form:1. Unfavorable information (Hillary‚Äôs emails) (be it true or false) about person A (Hillary)is presented by another (Comey & the GOP). (e.g. "Before you listen to my opponent, may I remind you that he has been in jail")2. Therefore, the claims made by person A will be false. I have seen this tactic used by American lawyers many times in my career.  During or just before a big case is to be made the attorneys will poison the well against their opponents merely to discredit them.However, there is never any thought about defending the false allegations in the court of law; only in the court of public opinion.Don‚Äôt be fooled!!!

A child rape case against him starts in Dec. than there are 73 other open court cases coming up. He also destroyed his own emails that were ordered by judges to admit to the court.

Any wise and just person knows that there are at least two sides to every story, so until I see what both sides are saying, these emails mean nothing to me. None of the emails show any intent of Hillary trying to illegally harm our country or any person, but we don't know what the gop and trump is saying or doing. Lets see both sides so we can make equal and fair decisions on who we want to vote for. You can only fool a fool, more than once and I'm nobody's fool.

A vehicle struck a flat-bed trailer carrying trick-or-treaters and adults on a Halloween hayride, which resulted in a fatal crash.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Marcialee Maynard | 74 | 10154033218905950_10154033297215950 | This really makes me mad after trick or treating last night and watching how fast people drive past children. I watch the children and they are so unpredictable darting away from their parents as well as many riding on flat beds. People need to slow down around children period.
2 | Bonnie Griffith | 53 | 10154033218905950_10154033294825950 | So sad for these children and their families.  Was it the safest thing to do? Probably not.  but it appears to have been a  tradition for this area that ended sadly.  What is even sadder though, is all you ignorant people spewing political opinions on a site reporting a sad event.  There is no room here for political haters!  Find another political, racial podium to vent your sick views on, and let the public and these sad families and friends mourn their losses in peace.
3 | Alexandra Marie Melton | 9 | 10154033218905950_10154033316640950 | This is so heartbreaking. My thoughts and prayers go out to this poor family. And I am so much more grateful this morning for my family's safe Halloween....I really hope I don't see anymore stories like this one today.
4 | Kara Grace Jackson | 16 | 10154033218905950_10154033329135950 | We saw kids doing the same. Riding on a flat bed,hayride. The traffic is crazy and people are ALWAYS in a hurry. Really...is it really worth it to get somewhere .5 seconds faster,to take a life? Slow down!!! Obviously there's gonna be kids all over,it IS their day to roam the streets....now,someone has to live with this forever,just to get somewhere a bit faster......was it worth it?? Nope.
5 | Lynn Thomas | 8 | 10154033218905950_10154033229155950 | So sad. Apparently it's a tradition down there. Something they've always done without incident. Praying for those involved (article says that the 3 dead were related, but didn't say how).
6 | Jessica Lopez | 10 | 10154033218905950_10154033324705950 | Smh. Why wasn't the driver paying attention.  It's Halloween there are going go be kids and hayrides. It's a night everyone needs to pay attention when they are driving and not be going fast. May these little angels families find comfort after this tragedy and I hope this serves as a lesson to others to take care when driving
7 | Lesa Dillard | 0 | 10154033218905950_10154033780235950 | üò¢..........why can't people slow down-knowing that children will be out on Halloween. I witnessed last night a car driving way to fast in a residential neighborhood of all things!! People are so irresponsible these days.......always in a hurry to go nowhere üò†. Praying for all involved üôèüèª
8 | Kimberly Doty-Dwyer | 1 | 10154033218905950_10154033345810950 | Oh my God Halloween doesn't mean it's kids day to run into traffic. Traffic is going to travel in the same pattern. Meaning at least doing the posted speed limits. A flat bed with out rails or any vehicle with out safty restraints is not a smart move. Parents are still responsible for watching there kids and making sure there not running into the streets before looking. There is thing everyone probably should be done better.
9 | Rei Rei Domingo | 7 | 10154033218905950_10154033262735950 | Wow this is very sad. Those kids. They were so happy and thought they'd be heading home to see how much candy they got and now they're dead...this is so heartbreaking.R.i.p. to the 3 that died and hope the others fully recover. :(
10 | Elizabeth Wisneski Mills | 1 | 10154033218905950_10154033482355950 | Evidently there was not a vehicle following the trailer. One of the main rules of having  a hayride. Also should have flashing lights on the trailer. I am so sorry that this happened and I send prayers for all involved. Plus even being on a highway, being near a small town, always slow down people
11 | Gary Hughes | 0 | 10154033218905950_10154033827845950 | What the hell was it doing on a highway? I assume no seat belts as well? I thought hayrides were meant for fields and if on a road, there should have been plenty of lights and reflectors etc but wtf was it doing on a highway?
12 | Martha O'Brien | 1 | 10154033218905950_10154033316795950 | Prayers for the families of those killed, & prayers for the wounded...but people need to pay more attention to what they're doing.....my husband is a truck driver, & we pull a low boy, so we normally have big, over sized loads, but I swear some people act like they can't see that big rig, hauling the heavy load coming towards them or up behind them, etc....we've had two people hit at our Wal-Mart here, in the last couple of weeks...both had to be careflighted
13 | Russell Parker | 1 | 10154033218905950_10154033244900950 | What you have to ask yourself: Why did Hillary accept the questions? Why didn't she expose the rigging? Why did she instead work hard to make her debate responses look unrehearsed? What does this say about her character? How could we possibly elect a president this unethical?
14 | Lauren Pichardo | 2 | 10154033218905950_10154033327790950 | I can't even begin to imagine the pain. How heartbreaking. Prayers for those families üò¢üíî

For the second time in two months, a pipeline that supplies gasoline to millions of people was shut down.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Darryllynn Cotham | 172 | 10154033193170950_10154033203735950 | And this affirms the Indian Nations fear of having one installed across their land!
2 | Eric Hancock | 30 | 10154033193170950_10154033308620950 | Any excuse to spike gas prices so the masses get screwed by the incompetence of the oil companies & their greed, but the executives won't lose any profit shares or bonuses for record profits this quarter- again. Profit is all that matters, right?
3 | Jeff Payne | 16 | 10154033193170950_10154033207295950 | Last time there was no shortage. Stop with this crap. You had folks going nuts buying gas that caused gas stations to run out.
4 | Beau Fish | 6 | 10154033193170950_10154033490255950 | Yeah, but did you notice how they report it?..Not "Pipeline fail leads to disastrous effect on ecosystem"...is not newsworthy..but if reported as "We cant get gas for our cars " its important...
5 | Jennifer Boyle | 29 | 10154033193170950_10154033210660950 | Why aren't you covering the Dakota access pipeline more on the news?
6 | Liz R Birckett-Lozano | 9 | 10154033193170950_10154033257250950 | I wondered about the one in September.... And this makes my suspicions harder to ignore.... I wouldn't out it past Big Oil to create these spills themselves and using fear of a shortage to cause the nation to support their new pipeline.
7 | Robert Childress | 1 | 10154033193170950_10154033522000950 | Oil industry is a cash cow joke. All these "accidents" are nothing more then staged to drive price back up. We need altertinitive options yesterday. Put them and the coal industey out of top money makers
8 | Dave Wade | 12 | 10154033193170950_10154033226330950 | Steve Lynn, What are you Smoking, Where are you getting this wild idea that Trump is going to do anything, I have yet to see where Trump has done anything for the American people
9 | Todd Clay | 2 | 10154033193170950_10154033492030950 | Anyone else think this is not just a random accident, but rather an incident created by forces inside this country attacking from the inside...
10 | Kathy Ahoe | 1 | 10154033193170950_10154033820305950 | Trucks trip over on roads, trains derail, cargo ships run aground and leak-what is your point really shit happens it's life and as long as you won't give up your car, heating your homes having a stove and hot water heater we need shit supplied to us. How does the farmer plant crops harvest crops get food to the warehouse from there to the stores-all by gas or diesel fuel . How are you going to eat if we cut off all supplies to gas and oil.
11 | Jeremy Black | 3 | 10154033193170950_10154033557100950 | And they're attacking protestors trying to prevent them from building a new one for this reason in the Dakota's. In a location that native Americans are being forced into this because it was rejected by the white resident's, because of this very reason.
12 | Kathy Ahoe | 0 | 10154033193170950_10154033825440950 | Bound to happen, normal to have happen by corrosion or done on purpose. Because we are dependent on gas and oil, plastics and heating our homes -any mode by which it's transported by will have accidents. It's all how it's cleaned up. Who's going to give it all up??
13 | Leo Lopez | 0 | 10154033193170950_10154033896685950 | But the oil companies say their pipelines are safe and pose no safety humans or environment . This is why the Natives are protecting their water, it's an environmental issue .
14 | Eppie Billena | 2 | 10154033193170950_10154033506835950 | And the lesson from this story is that no matter how one is careful accident do happens. And it was in the water no clean drinking water. Clean up is not easy either just like what happened in the gulf. Until now there are areas with crude oil residuals. And this is the #1 reason I am with the Rock Sioux Native Americans opposing that pipeline near their only water supply.
15 | Steve Lynn | 1 | 10154033193170950_10154033219530950 | Trump will fix it! Gas will be almost free after he gets elected and if not everyone will be working making a higher wage so the price won't matter!
16 | Cindy Ann Hinkle | 13 | 10154033193170950_10154033301255950 | Hey CBS, how about stating this is one of the reasons people are fighting against the pipelines in North Dakota at Standing Rock
17 | Jolene Miller | 5 | 10154033193170950_10154033345175950 | R.I.P. to the engineer who lost his life and the roughnecks injured.

19 | Gerald Broadwater | 6 | 10154033193170950_10154033328765950 | I think the oil companies do this themselves just to bring the price of gas and oil back up....
20 | Teddy Simon | 2 | 10154033193170950_10154033359700950 | Thanks to Republican deregulation this will continue to happen .
21 | Gregory Campana | 1 | 10154033193170950_10154033482080950 | So this is to convenant so how is doing this, to Futher there false agenda

2 | Sandy Adams | 37 | 10154033120390950_10154033208725950 | Never mind the fact she looks like she just won the lottery.....it's not just whether the kids had air or not ...suppose the car was in an accident ...no one except the dead or injured driver and passenger would assume there would be kids in the trunk ...or they had an emergency ..choked ect...and she didn't know . She needed a bigger sentenced then what she got ...both of those kids could have died!!
3 | Iwana Marie Wester | 18 | 10154033120390950_10154033256780950 | Corvette "trunk" Glad I didn't get caught letting my kids ride back there! LolI really don't know how mine survived all the "adventures" we attempted. :)
4 | David Chandler | 16 | 10154033120390950_10154033197820950 | As long as the kids was able to get air , i bet they had a ball. I've gotten and put kids in the trunk a many times when i was a kid.
5 | Youlonda M. McCullough-Jackson | 5 | 10154033120390950_10154033428720950 | I'm not saying she made the best decision, but COME ON!!! They weren't left to die in the heat, cold, they were riding in the lil hatch area!! I don't under how they can give her prison time. The judge here in Arkansas was released and his son died, because he left him in the back seat of a hot car for 4 hours. I don't get it, but I do.
6 | Gary Clawson | 21 | 10154033120390950_10154033237845950 | Take a trip to the dealership and look at a Corvette! There is NO TRUNK. It is an open area where the back seat would be on any other car. Just like riding in the back of a Van or Station Wagon!
7 | Ansem Cottrill | 10 | 10154033120390950_10154033206775950 | So Trump supporters get mad about this. But not his child molestation claims? 'Murica. Only gets offended when it doesn't fit their agenda.
8 | Carrie Crites | 4 | 10154033120390950_10154033320875950 | I remember being young and we would get in the trunk of my grandmoms 66 Chevy impala convertible and we are still living lol
9 | Aliena Nicole Turner | 0 | 10154033120390950_10154033742995950 | I'm sorry, but having fun with your kids and putting them in real danger, is two totally different things! You don't put your kids in the trunk of any car for a "joy ride." We are talking about a trunk here people! There are many things outside of a car accident that could have happened. As a mother of 2 beautiful girls, I would never willingly or purposely put them in danger. Use your brain, it's there for a reason.
10 | Robert Roy Jr | 3 | 10154033120390950_10154033410960950 | Corvettes have trunks? Well, if you're gonna take a mug shot...make it a good one. She'll probably get a modeling contract like that one guy who got sent to prison.
11 | Jenna Booth | 0 | 10154033120390950_10154033457790950 | This is ridiculous. People have gotten less punishment in recent months for child molesting and hot car deaths but we're vilifying this mother. She did something most consider dumb. I rode in hatchbacks and pick up beds as a kid. So she's not the best at common sense and judgment. Maybe she was raised differently than some of us. People are so fast to hate and degrade these days... Makes me sick.
12 | Amy Martinez-Salas | 0 | 10154033120390950_10154033457595950 | So possibly this PoS is getting her kids back? And if they eventually end up getting murdered the people that care about those kids can sue the system?

Drilling techniques have changed through the decades so the findings don't necessarily point to a current risk.

1 | Gloria Simons Richards | 4 | 10154033042565950_10154033146880950 | When they started fracking locally in N.E Ohio, we had a minor earthquake. They shut down the project. Oklahoma has become more active as far as quakes than California with all of their fracking. That's more or less told me there just may be a connection. But what the heck, we don't want to deny the oil companies money do we?
2 | Aaron Thiel | 3 | 10154033042565950_10154033055955950 | Caused or triggered? HUGE difference. The tectonic plates are the CAUSE. Drilling could only shakes already stressed faults loose, in theory.

Police say the 20-year-old student at Millersville University in Lancaster County didn't want the woman to have a baby
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Dana Lane | 94 | 10154032963600950_10154033053245950 | I'm confused. He's being charged with attempted murder of an unborn child...but abortion is ok and no one is charged with murder?? I thought it wasn't considered a child in the first trimester. So many double standards.
2 | Jeff Ragusa | 45 | 10154032963600950_10154033112850950 | I'm not defending this guy at all !! Now what a stupid fucker bleach really with the morning after pill available hmmmmm , also with all you people talking about abortion HE GAVE HIS GIRLFRIEND BLEACH TO DRINK
3 | Cyndie Dunlap McKiddy | 100 | 10154032963600950_10154032992420950 | Here's a novel idea; if you don't want a baby, keep your pants zipped.
4 | Quanneisha ZaQuese | 42 | 10154032963600950_10154033253340950 | Here comes all the hypocrites. A woman chooses to keep her baby and all you can talk about how it's the same as abortion.... Drinking bleach could harm both of them, so how about y'all get heads out of your asses.
5 | Kaylee Nichole Lopez | 27 | 10154032963600950_10154033269105950 | Doesn't want baby. Poisons girlfriend. You people complaining about the baby don't seem to realize he tried to poison his girlfriend. So both of them, embryo and grown human woman, would have died.
6 | Kathy Mary | 14 | 10154032963600950_10154033174940950 | Lets see Hilary Clinton wants to approve abortion up to 9 months because every woman has a right to her own body yet this guy is arrested for trying to get rid of his. The lousy scum bag needs to be put in a hole with Clinton and buried alive and justice would be served for both.
7 | Jessie Fay | 10 | 10154032963600950_10154033055890950 | So in PA abortion is murder now?!If it's not "murder" for the woman to choose to kill it but IS "murder" when the father does then what is it that somehow magically and biologically changes the structure, makeup and personhood of that fetus?!IF the answer is that it's only up to the woman and her personal "feelings" regarding whether she "wants" to carry it to term and that only HER feelings and opinions carry and weight in that matter while HIS feelings don't then I think we've got a real problem here with this liberal way of thinking that makes everything in human scientific development a matter of woman having authority to determine a human person as not being a person but men not being allowed that same authority over a being they are expected to take equal responsibility for!!!What about a mans right not to be forced into fatherhood?!A woman can choose not to want motherhood by an act of cold blooded murder but a man cannot?!?!
8 | Sharon Morgan | 5 | 10154032963600950_10154033244565950 | This can't be real,he had unprotected sex with her and now he don't want her to have a baby! So he gives her bleach and the morning after pill,how about someone cut his  penis with a cold glass of bleach!! Dumb assüíØüíØ
9 | Christine Wyly | 6 | 10154032963600950_10154033173205950 | We all get it now. It's okay for a doctor to kill a child in utero, but against the law for a boyfriend to do it ... not withstanding the method of course.
10 | Youlonda M. McCullough-Jackson | 1 | 10154032963600950_10154033442985950 | If he didn't want a baby he probably should have been doing something other than having sex!! Oh yeah it's called protection, dude, but that's not an option!! Then dumb Dan, decides to use a stupid form of killing mom, and unborn child. Can you say 3 hots and a cot!!
11 | Greg Dore | 7 | 10154032963600950_10154033282860950 | Well I'm so glad they arrested your your ass for attempted murder. If you didn't want the baby maybe you should not not have sex with that woman always protect yourself you moron
12 | Katie Storm | 1 | 10154032963600950_10154033259825950 | He basically tried to force his girl friend to have an abortion by giving her water with bleach in it, because he didn't want her to have the baby. If anything this man didn't want his girlfriend to have the baby. What he tried to do is extremely selfish and should at least be considered as being reckless endangerment.
13 | Michael Washington | 2 | 10154032963600950_10154033393160950 | He should be charged with assault, but also laws need to be changed so that men can opt out of parental responsibility. If women want the right to choose, so should men have that right.
14 | Dorothy Streich | 1 | 10154032963600950_10154033687250950 | I know that abortion is a hot topic lately especially in an election year I for one do not believe in having an abortion but also know it is a tough choice to make but it is the choice of the parent/parents especially if it is life threatening or there is something wrong with the fetus and their life expectancy is going to be short or non existent when born!!!!!!! This man attempting to murder his fetus and girlfriend that is a crime! If a person does not want to have children USE BIRTH CONTROL AND CONDOMS! BECAUSE HAVING UNPROTECTED SEX WITH ANYONE COULD BE A LIFE OR DEATH SENTENCE ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE NOT COMMITTED OR MARRIED TO A PERSON
15 | Andrea Robinson | 1 | 10154032963600950_10154033421850950 | He should have kept, his penis in his pants then. You know that if you are not using some kind of protection, that there is possibility or the female becoming pregnant. If she is not taking something. It is not on the woman only be responsible....
16 | Sharee Zimmerle-Garrison | 1 | 10154032963600950_10154033280205950 | What I don't understand is the man is supposed to be college intelligent and there are a lot of things easily gotten in easily digested and would never hurt the mother that would get rid of a fetus not going to post them here but there is an excellent tasting tea
17 | Michael Filley | 0 | 10154032963600950_10154033412310950 | again I will say it, if we only taught respect, responsibility, citizenship, honor in school, we wouldn't see things like this as much
18 | Harry T Miller | 2 | 10154032963600950_10154033323520950 | He's a young nitwit...who didn't keep it zipped up or use a condom, where do you think babies come from. You do the nasty, grow you a pair and man up...don't want a baby, protect yourself or don't sleep with a woman you weren't  forced...now get set to pay with jail time and child support for 18 years..should have thought with the other head...dummy.
19 | Bill Sawyer | 2 | 10154032963600950_10154033307415950 | I think this would be a wonderful opportunity to pause for a moment and give thanks for the many great contributions of the Black community and their culture to our society. Their peaceful and generous nature makes them ideal neighbors, lending testimony to their exceptional family values and parenting skills unrivaled by any other culture. Their commitment to academic excellence enriches our schools and serves as an example to all who hope to achieve prominence as a people. Real Estate values are fueled by the influx of African Americans into an area due to their caring and respectful nurturing of these communities, an example of all they have achieved by their enthusiasm for self-improvement through hard work and a self-reliant can-do nature. Without their industrious and creative drive, we would be poorer as a nation.
20 | Tammie Carney | 1 | 10154032963600950_10154033532465950 | So only a woman can kill her baby but a man has no say got it ...  again if a woman wants to keep a baby and he font he should be allowed to walk away just like a woman can kill a baby a man wants and pay nothing to him .. before killing a baby both should have a say .. not just one half and if one wants to keep it and the other doesn't then one should be made to have it and hand it off and walk away not kill it ... but if the man dont want it he is force to pay  not right time for lawyers to fight for men to give up their rights if said woman is forcing a child on him ..
21 | Augustine Taylor | 12 | 10154032963600950_10154032971555950 | Liberals would excuse him for trying to kill a harmless baby.
22 | Randy Darrah | 8 | 10154032963600950_10154033012440950 | If it's not a baby, how can he be accused of attempted murder of an unborn child?

2 | Martha O'Brien | 1 | 10154032744395950_10154033051145950 | Glad that someone over heard him, & it was stopped...the last school shooting that I saw on the news resulted in the death of a 6 year old... & why are these parents guns not locked up in a safe?? I can get to mine quick, but my grandson can't...
3 | Ovadia Levy | 4 | 10154032744395950_10154032744700950 | say George Orwell's statement defines it perfectly with the liberal Democrats:"The further a society drifts from the truth, the more it will hate those who speak it." Uhhh...TRUMP is the one that deserves and has earned the White House. It's so not for the Queen of Lying Hillary.

2 | George Adams | 7 | 10154032648450950_10154032796345950 | STOP Election Fraud: Do NOT use Soros voting machines. Please vote to put Billery/Killery on trial for TREASON. She broke the law and belongs in jail. She risked our country and put our people in harm's way, and had Democratic whistleblowers murdered. Not only Billery is very dangerous, she will bring this country to a security collapse with cutting our military and a financial collapse by choosing a fight with Russia and ruining small businesses while sending all jobs overseas. Please don't vote for the DEVIL. This country needs to be free and strong, where people have a real chance at the American Dream. Billery should have never been the Democratic candidate to start with and stole the nomination from Bernie Sanders. She is the most corrupt candidate ever and works for the elite new world order who wants to make people obsolete with new robotic technology. She brings with her sinister powers and so do not be fooled by her fake smiles and phony consideration for the working man, or woman. Vote Donald Trump and save our nation. CNN until now has been reporting lies and gossip that was never admissible in court about Donald Trump. But tonight CNN, the yellow tabloid, must for a change act like a real news network and report the truth. Pray to God and pray hard that Donald Trump is our next President. We need to stop criminal refugees from coming here and take care first of our American veterans. We need to work on better trade deals so manufacturing will be back in America. We need to stop paying for parasites! The election is at stake with Billery's dirty tricks and it must be watched closely. Donald Trump is our only hope before Killery turns this country to a worse version of 1984 by George Orwell. I hope the next thing Trump do as our new much admired President is expose all the dirt, every affair and sexual indecency of every CNN reporter, including Anderson, Gloria, and that self righteous long brown haired woman. Then, HC must be locked up for the rest of her life. If you don't want more zombies on the streets, if you don't want to give up cash, and guns and freedom of speech, VOTE for TRUMP!!! We can't afford the status quo! We're losing our country!!! Dare, you pathetic paid patsies online of HC to call me names and I will take screen shots and sue you for libel!!! This nation is SICK of the Clinton cover ups. Stop totalitarianism! CNN=Clinton News Network. Hope Trump fires many of you when he is elected! Let us pray November 8 brings the change that we so desperately need. Long Live Trump, our savior!I am:1) A married WOMAN2) Have no kids3) Intelligent and educated4) Independent politically5) Trump Supporter, Truth Supporter, Freedom Supporter and a Proud American 6) Not a racist, respectful of ALL religions and races 7) Very worried about how globalism will annihilate our country as we know itWe all know main stream media and the system are rigged. We must never take our freedom for granted. On November 8 stand the lines as long as they are because our liberty and justice for all are at stake. Let us pray Billery/Killery will be arrested soon, AMEN. Please share and God Bless. P.S. For crying outloud, stop briefing the enemy Billery if you want to keep the U.S. safe!Hellery/Liary needs to have her clearance removed. Clean the swamp America! Huma is most likely a spy and Loretta Lynch, Justice Department director is as vicious as Killery, pleading the Fifth when Congress asked her about why so many millions of dollars "disappeared" and ended in Iran! We MUST put a stop to the traitors and tried them all for TREASON. PPS Huma=married to a pedophile. Killery=married to a rapist. That's how they respect women, ha???!!! JOKE! We ALL know LIARY is a pathological liar and an urgent danger to the sovereignty of the U.S. Please be careful about CNN too-they are ANTI AMERICAN. Who knows what more harm Killery did to our beloved country. Pray for our country and Trump. Ask yourself who is helping Hillery with the cover up and why...We want our country back!
