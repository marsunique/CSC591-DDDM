2 | Hilda Small | 0 | 10154037692760950_10154037754455950 | I usually watch the CBS evening news but I am so annoyed with the people who report the news especially, Scott Pelley when they refer to Present Obama they call him Mr. Obama he is the President they should refer to him as President Obama. Render to Cesar the things that are Cesar and to God the things that are God.
3 | Gary Doan | 1 | 10154037692760950_10154037736885950 | Media Corruption needs to end ! Over the last few months we have witnessed the most blatant attack on free speech in history. Nothing but a constant stream of propaganda and constant coverup of important information. Yellow journalism of a century ago and the Communist propaganda network, look like amateur efforts, when compared to the Western Mass Media we have today. Leftists have mastered the fourth rail. Karl Marx, Lenin, Trotsky and Stalin were all newspaper editors during their careers and they laid the groundwork for what is falsely called journalism today. It needs to end, if Americans want to remain FREE.

At least 19 women spoke to CBS News about their experiences, and they paint a mixed picture of what it was like to be a female employee in the Trump Organization.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Rosemary Niswonger-Muse | 87 | 10154037625455950_10154037638810950 | Thank you, Mr Trump for starting this journey for Us! I know you had better things to do, than endure the liars and backstabbers for Us!  I know you had better things to spend your money on, instead of fighting for Us!  I know you're giving up your time with your own family to care about Us! Thank you for sending help, though you didn't have to, to those of Us who are displaced due to Natural Disasters! Thank you for shaking our hands. Thank you for hugging our children. Thank you for Caring about the future of our Grandchildren! Thank you for Loving our Country! Thank you for taking a Stand against Corrupt Government! Mr Trump has the Endorsement of Christian Leaders such as, Dr James Dobson, Jerry Falwell Jr, and Franklin Graham! Mr Trump, We The People Are Behind You! With much gratitude, An American Citizen!
2 | Ellie Nyblom | 14 | 10154037625455950_10154037689095950 | They were well paid and in with the "in crowd ". I'm sorry  but I don't believe them. We've all seen and HEARD him saying nasty things about women. AND what was okay for him to do to women..."grab them by the "p***y ".  The women who said that were likely as debased as trump. As for the decent educated woman. Your BS isn't believable.
3 | Daniel Swannon | 13 | 10154037625455950_10154037703435950 | so we have an evil, corrupt, murderous person running for the highest office in the land that wants to bring in more illegals, raise taxes, and carry on BO failed practices, and this is your story!
4 | Helen Duong | 15 | 10154037625455950_10154037681130950 | They are trying so hard to put Trump down. They have to track these women down. Probably paid some of them to trash him.
5 | Rick Ustler | 13 | 10154037625455950_10154037652020950 | 370 economist have just joined the list of World Leaders, scientist, intellectuals, ex president, religious leader of the major churches, writer and journalist and so on and so on have denounced Trump as unfit to hold office. At least the leaders of North Korea and Russia, the Klan and American Nazi think he'll be good for America.
6 | Nicolas Taylor | 9 | 10154037625455950_10154037653135950 | Well that's always good to hear, maybe being raised by a single mom makes me hate seeing women degraded.
7 | Adam Kapps | 4 | 10154037625455950_10154037714800950 | These women are nothing more than employees of the Killary camp. The liberal idiot media and the pawns watching are so eager to suck this crap up its sad! Stop the Liberalism disease!
8 | Charlie Ritter | 1 | 10154037625455950_10154037730740950 | An Arkansas man claiming to be Bill Clinton's illegitimate son has appealed to Monica Lewinsky for access to her infamous blue dress to provide a sample of the former president's genetic material for a paternity test.
9 | David McRoberts | 26 | 10154037625455950_10154037631490950 | well i never worked for Mr Trump..but I heard him say all those things...just saying
10 | Stephie Belle | 3 | 10154037625455950_10154037727705950 | This works both ways. You could find any employee and ask the opposite sex how they got on with that person and most of the time, you get mixed responses. Gosh CBS, can't you find something better to do with your days?
11 | Sue Geren | 0 | 10154037625455950_10154037766150950 | CBS works for Hillary so I don't believe a word of it if true it would been out way before now. Stop grasping at straws Trump will win this election with a landslide  #NeverCrookedKillary
12 | Kn Lam | 0 | 10154037625455950_10154037747115950 | I judge Trump based on what I hear his said in public. And he is horrible. It is sad that this article is trying to humanise him. It is wrong.
13 | Cody Carter | 15 | 10154037625455950_10154037635660950 | Trump is a gentleman. The only times he was ever accused of assault was after he won the Republican nomination. Desperate attempts to smear and tarnish a future great President! Democrats are desperate and sad people.
14 | Donovan Thomas | 0 | 10154037625455950_10154037754445950 | Actually hillarys policies would put us more in debt and also tax the middle class! Trumps plan wouldn't go do some research and find the facts!!!
15 | Joel Odegaard | 3 | 10154037625455950_10154037719585950 | Ask women who are working for trump and have been for years. Former employees rarely tell the truth. Also wheres your story on all the people that have worked with her and say she's a nasty vile creature
16 | Tom Beatty | 1 | 10154037625455950_10154037742300950 | Okay, CBS, track down 19 women who have been violated and trashed by the Clintons!! I challenge CBS......I have no doubt this will be ignored!!!!!
17 | Lee Russ | 3 | 10154037625455950_10154037713835950 | He's a good man. Suck it up. You're just pissed no-one has ever heard of killary being nice....in fact its always the opposite with her. #TRUMP2016 #NEVERKILLARY
18 | Martha O'Brien | 1 | 10154037625455950_10154037744125950 | Just goes to show that my family & I made the right choice on who to vote for...even when the lies & all started to surface, we never doubted you for a minute, Mr. Trump....I know that you're not the only boss to have ever yelled at people...I know you haven't!!! You're supporters stand by you & Mike...even those that have people be so rude to them, that they will & have voted for you without telling America! I know a few that love you & Mike, but have been threatened to the point that they voted in secret...& yet some people call you a bully, smh...you tell the truth, & now with so many people getting offended about everything...they would rather lash out at anyone not supporting Clinton...I can't make a rally in person, but I love to see the crowds that you & Mike pull in...thank you for taking the time away from your family to campaign for the American people!!! Thank you for not giving up, when others said that you should!! Hang in there...you & Mike are always in our thoughts & prayers!!!AND---this is my comment, about my candidate...& if you don't like it, then skip over it, because I am sick to death of Hillary Clinton supporters trying to shame me for my vote, & for trying to bully me, because I do NOT support her...you're crap will not be tolerated, but will gladly be blocked
19 | Tammi Fleming Hauhuth | 4 | 10154037625455950_10154037697095950 | Keep trying CBS News Nothing you could possibly ever dig up on Mr. Trump could EVER compare to the filth of Hillary Clinton.

22 | Rob Visconti | 8 | 10154037625455950_10154037630815950 | Gov Bill Weld basically just told Libertarians or protest voters to vote for Hillary Clinton rather than him and Johnson on the The Rachel Maddow Show. He acknowledged that the Libertarians cannot win and that the risk of throwing the election to what he described as a national threat if Trump were to be President was too great. He vouched for Hillary Clinton as a highly moral person and exceptional leader from his decades long relationship personally and professionally working with Hillary. He described Comey's letter as unacceptable and that there is nothing in the emails that he never even read to warrant ever insinuating there is. #VoteClintonKaine2016 #VoteDemocratUpAndDownBallot #NeverPutinTrumpPence
23 | Chris Veronica Riley | 3 | 10154037625455950_10154037708515950 | Oh let's talk about how many women spoke about Bill Clinton of sexual assault.
24 | Mike Devine | 1 | 10154037625455950_10154037708395950 | Trump is fueling White Supremacists like gas is .13 cents a gallon. Time to vote like an adult, vote Hillary Clinton.
25 | Rosemary Niswonger-Muse | 3 | 10154037625455950_10154037642120950 | Although the Media, #CBS, #ABC, #NBC, #CNN  doesn't want to admit it Voter Fraud and Rigging the Election is in fact very Real! Why else would Al Gore want a recount? Why did Hillary, herself want a recount? There were 3 other Democrats that Demanded a recount! I watched a #PBS Documentary on about Hillary and Trump and "Politics" going forward to the election. There was a portion dedicated to President LBJ. A reporter asked if he thought there were Rigged elections. LBJ looked at a picture on his wall of 5 men surrounding a Ballot Box. The picture was from LBJ's first run for a Government Office. LBJ nodded towards the picture,laughed and said "what do you think?" Enough Said!

2 | Debbie O'Connor | 180 | 10154037467185950_10154037474695950 | I have Clinton fatigue already.And hey....I can't have fatigue or be sick....because my insurance policy cancels in 45 days.Thank you Obama....thank you Hillary.You all have managed to make this a very tough year for the middle class.I'm over you both.I want you...Mr. Obama, to have my circumstances as it relates to health care. I want you to worry about being dropped by your insurance and your cardiologist."Mr. If you like your doctor and insurance you can keep them."You lied....just like you lied and said you didn't know about the Hillary private server.One word. Wikileaks. Yep, worse than bladder leaks. Huh Barack?Busted.You would sell your child for the right price.You are everything that's wrong with America.And furthermore.....I'm praying day and night....that your future is sealed.I'm praying that God has busted your corruption with His great big spotlight.And....I'm begging God...to give us, "we the people" one more chance.
3 | Shelly Battista | 63 | 10154037467185950_10154037510175950 | Haha, manipulate the polls however you want, Trump is going to win. I'm an independent; not voting for either of the bottom-feeders. The fallacy that only one of the big party candidates can win is a tool used by the parties to perpetuate their power.
4 | Joseph Hicks | 37 | 10154037467185950_10154037476990950 | You Trump people need to get it through your heads that your guy is going to lose. Even if Trump wins every swing state, he still needs to capture a state that's currently leaning heavily Democratic to get to 270 electoral votes.  This election could be over before midnight on November 8. All Clinton needs to do is win Florida, and it's over.
5 | Mike Lentine | 22 | 10154037467185950_10154037478090950 | So much for emails. Old news and after four investigations this new one will come up empty too. Besides Trump is his own worse enemy.
6 | Jimmy George | 23 | 10154037467185950_10154037512910950 | I think we're aware that Clinton could murder small children to bathe in their blood and her supporters would still have their heads up her ass. This has been established for a while now. They somehow think that the shitty character of Trump makes her seem any better, but they're just both trash and neither side is willing to accept it.
7 | Paul Woeller | 27 | 10154037467185950_10154037508750950 | hillary has been crooked her entire career she got fired from her 1st job, as far as Trump... he will be the best thing for America since and maybe even better than Reagan ! not a career politician, successful businessman , doesn't need the money, loves America, hates to fail !
8 | Thomas Biebers | 10 | 10154037467185950_10154037545815950 | What do you expect from Hillary supporters. They are the same uneducated, unemployed deadbeats that believed OJ was innocent, even with all the bloody evidence. If Hillary wins, i pray that the Republicans in Congress make her life a living hell, that she cant govern, and eventually suffers the same karma that has befallen OJ, and becomes a shell of herself in prison.
9 | David Schuetrumpf | 27 | 10154037467185950_10154037514190950 | Hillary is a lying, hypocrite, repulsive piece of shit, pathetic, arrogant cunt who should choke on her next meal of lying bullshit spewing from her mouth...There is absolutely NOTHING the lying, repulsive piece of shit, arrogant cunt could EVER say or do that would have me vote for her.... NOTHING... Fucking bitch should choke on her own bullshit..!
10 | Nicholas G. Mourufas | 8 | 10154037467185950_10154037519325950 | I started following CBS on Facebook after a good friend told me CBS was blatantly misleading the masses.. and I was like no way!... And now after the last month or so I'm as convinced that CBS isn't legit...the people need the real issues like Hillary is dirty, and our native Americans are getting a raw deal in the Dakota's...and Obama is bold face lying to them to secure votes...if Obama didn't want this pipeline he would have treated the Dakota access pipeline like the keystone XL pipeline....this is your wake up call
11 | Keith Funderburk | 13 | 10154037467185950_10154037501620950 | The FBI found e mails in Wieners computer that suggest Hillary was selling herself to the highest bidder which was going to donate the most to the Clinton Foundation. The FBI found some talk along these lines but needs Loretta Lynch to allow the FBI to issue subpoenas for a complete study of the e mails as they are on her husbands computer. Lynch is blocking any efforts to get at the truth so IMO , she is a dirt bag! My theory of why the e mails are on Wiener's computer and not Clinton's #1 aid, She was trying to hide the e mails by using her husbands computer but then that moron got caught sending sex pictures to 15 year olds. The FBI confiscated Wiener's computer and found these other e mails by accident.
12 | Michael Poulicakos | 4 | 10154037467185950_10154037548070950 | Screw the polls. After Donald Trump wins the corrupt media will blame it on the FBI, Halloween and whatever else they can dream up short of Queen Hillary herself and her dirty deeds. I can't believe the crazy old man Bernie is still going to campaign for her after finding out she had the questions beforehand in their debates. That lake house the Clintons gave him the money for must be "extremely nice".
13 | Geralyn Langr-Moulds | 6 | 10154037467185950_10154037532925950 | And what does that say about Americans? It says nominating a person under investigation is no big deal......how sad. Hillary once said no one under investigation by FBI should be able to buy a gun or board a plane. But guess running for president is okay.
14 | Danny Dranger | 9 | 10154037467185950_10154037476035950 | see the stock market dropping cuz of trumo? all u idiots are gonna lose jobs when his election will cause a world recession. u got yrseives to blame.
15 | Melissa N Vince Norwood | 3 | 10154037467185950_10154037579070950 | Of course CBS would say this and take a poll that they are only polling democrats! You think we Trump supporters are that dumb! No you are for thinking that we are! We all know that you are all in the tank with hillary and I hope you go down with her too! For all the biased crap! And for telling all the lies you've told! Hillary is a corrupt idiot just like you media people!
16 | Billy Anderson | 4 | 10154037467185950_10154037531200950 | It is truly amazing to me that anyone would want someone like hillary to be their leader She's been busted for cheating a debate, she has lied her ass off to congress, the FBI, and the American people she has 0% integrity she even made up a story about snipers shooting at her .. thats who they want to lead the country
17 | Nancy Mulliniks | 2 | 10154037467185950_10154037581455950 | Come on Trump People don't believe all these people!!! If they are voting for lying Hillary they are not interested in what kind of world they are leaving their children and grandchildren  in for their future. Hillary has sold out OUR AMERICA  !!! REMEMBER "YOU OWN IT" if you vote for her!!!!!
18 | Mitch Boxx | 1 | 10154037467185950_10154037642700950 | 2007 "Obama" "Hillary is unfit to be President" Michelle Obama "If you can't run your own house how can you run the White House" 2016 - She is more qualified than Obama. (According to Mr. And Mrs. Obama." What did she do in those eight years that makes her more qualified?? Seriously
19 | Jimmy McMahan Jr | 2 | 10154037467185950_10154037536570950 | Of course not. Liberals wouldn't care if they found video of her burning down orphanages. Remember, liberalism is a mental disorder.
20 | Brian Hudson | 0 | 10154037467185950_10154037763335950 | To all of the liberal voters out there who plan to vote for clinton:  Bernie Sanders would have been a much better choice for you. While he is basically an admitted socialist, at least he was upfront with his vision for America...and, although I disagree with his socialist agenda, I truly believe that his primary goal was to help those less fortunate...that is, before he sold out to the establishment.  His democratic primary opponent, hillary, on the other hand, uses the guise of social justice to further the global vision of a one world government with open borders and no regard for the American people,  you included.  She is part of a group that considers itself above the rest of us and above the law.  The mainstream media is behind her 100%, twisting information and selectively reporting on events to help her in this endeavor. There is a plethora of verifiable information out there to back this up and I urge you to do a little research before voting.  I know some of you will ask me to list the proof, but honestly, I have to work and don't have time to show you things that most of you wil scoff at anyway.  I will tell you that I have been fascinated with the effective use of the media to sway public opinion for many years.  I earned my bachelor's degree in Mass Communications with a minor in Sociology.  I spent many hours researching this phenomenon, while in the process of writing multiple papers and essays on the topic...particularly the use of propaganda in Nazi Germany and Stalinist Russia, and how the power elite used the media to vilify supposed political opponents and control the population towards disastrous and nefarious ends...I see the same thing happening in our society today, albeit, on a much grander and subversive scale.  This, in and of itself, scares me to my very core.  Some of you may say that I'm a conspiracy theorist and that may be so, but I've got to tell you that I am seeing a lot more intelligent Americans who are starting to open up their eyes to that line of thought.  I wonder how the world will react when many of these conspiracies are proven true!
21 | Ron Campbell | 1 | 10154037467185950_10154037657350950 | I don't know how many times I have to say this. Trump has virtually no minorities and Hillary has most of the educated white women. No candidate can win without minorities and women. Those days of white men determining an election are over. Trump has a much steeper hill to climb to win this election. These are just the facts.
22 | Vickie Szymanski | 0 | 10154037467185950_10154037643245950 | I have not seen,ANY Hillary signs anywhere in the 4 cites I drive back and 4th through every week... and I have only seen TWO hillary supporters in my feeds from my friends... so where are all these supporters? Oh probably havent crossed the border yet or crawled out their graves.
23 | Todd Patrzalek | 2 | 10154037467185950_10154037585355950 | the polls also seem to show that republicans are going to retain the house and senate ...so when she wins it will be worse gridlock get nothing done than the last 8 years.... and the American people will ultimately benefit from that ...cause anything the government accomplishes is a disaster ...we need less govt and  more freedom to keep American exceptionalism alive.
24 | Joseph Hammontree | 0 | 10154037467185950_10154037752860950 | Yeah news media wont cover content. But hey , lets spend days talking about Trump talking bad about women. Instead of hillary and the d.n.c. paying for violence at Trump rallies. And rigging election against one of their own. Bernie was screwed. No socialism in U.S.A.  but he deserved a fair chance.
25 | Kelly Peagler Myers | 0 | 10154037467185950_10154037640545950 | We are surrounded by idiots. We are once again the laughing stock. Whether you support Trump or not you should even be considering Hillary. And she shouldn't be allowed to even run for President. But then again this could be our lovely biased news.

"We have to stop thinking that his behavior is normal, that it's within the bounds of our normal political discourse," President Obama said of Trump while campaigning for Clinton in North Carolina earlier today.

1 | Donny Aldridge | 220 | 10154037414470950_10154037422800950 | Clinton is losing states are starting to flip..American people not going to elect someone who is under federal investigation..
2 | Rosemary Niswonger-Muse | 90 | 10154037414470950_10154037426535950 | Thank you, Mr Trump for starting this journey for Us! I know you had better things to do, than endure the liars and backstabbers for Us!  I know you had better things to spend your money on, instead of fighting for Us!  I know you're giving up your time with your own family to care about Us! Thank you for sending help, though you didn't have to, to those of Us who are displaced due to Natural Disasters! Thank you for shaking our hands. Thank you for hugging our children. Thank you for Caring about the future of our Grandchildren! Thank you for Loving our Country! Thank you for taking a Stand against Corrupt Government! Mr Trump has the Endorsement of Christian Leaders such as, Dr James Dobson, Jerry Falwell Jr, and Franklin Graham! Mr Trump, We The People Are Behind You! With much gratitude, An American Citizen!
3 | John McAuliffe | 87 | 10154037414470950_10154037419385950 | Every time Obama mounts the podium to push Hillary on the American people, his carefully crafted reputation shows up more cracks
4 | Matthew Scott | 66 | 10154037414470950_10154037428825950 | Funny while this hypocrite runs around campaigning for a constitutional crisis using tax payers money to flap his gums on behalf of a crook. Shows his character is just like hers. Corrupt.
5 | Ben Gould | 57 | 10154037414470950_10154037429495950 | I feel dumber just for listening to him talk. He's a hypocritical disaster who put our country on the wrong track. Hillary will be the final blow. Vote for freedom over feelings.
6 | Shelly Kent | 36 | 10154037414470950_10154037422650950 | I agree, and we have to stop thinking that Hillary's behavior is normal.
7 | Laura Key | 58 | 10154037414470950_10154037417395950 | MAINSTREAM MEDIA needs to be sued for COLLUSION with CLINTON MAFIA!!
8 | Ed Bailey | 30 | 10154037414470950_10154037432925950 | Neither is this stupid, steaming pile of crap! We need an outsider in the White House. Our government needs to change. It's" We the People". As Mr. Trump says, #DrainTheSwamp!
9 | Robin Perez | 24 | 10154037414470950_10154037434140950 | I like to know how Obama can get paid to be our President but is off Campaigning for Crooked Hillary! Get back in the Oval Office and do your job that you have neglected for the American people. He is trying so hard to elect Hillary because there is so much cover-up and corruption he is afraid of something!
10 | Darrin Richards | 9 | 10154037414470950_10154037446740950 | Let's not forget the reason Crooked Donna Brazile is the Chairwoman it's because DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz was caught rigging the primary election in favor of Hillary Clinton. Debbie W. was fired from the DNC and she was hired two days later by Crooked Hillary Clinton. Think about that for second.. presidential candidate hires the busted cheating  DNC Debbie to work on her campaign after the nation knows this woman was busted for rigging the election process against Bernie Sanders.
11 | David Sanders | 15 | 10154037414470950_10154037433955950 | I think Hillary told Obama how to be a piece of shit in his final days as president .. Don't forget to steal the furniture before you leave !
12 | Bill DeLeeuw | 19 | 10154037414470950_10154037429580950 | Obama has never been in touch with "We the People" so how can he say Donald J. Trump's words are or are not the voice of America?
13 | Tiffany Satterfield Cowden | 10 | 10154037414470950_10154037437590950 | Obama and Clinton make me sick, and worse then that they actually have won people over! What is wrong with America! TRUMP for president!
14 | Julie Sanchez | 8 | 10154037414470950_10154037453475950 | We have to stop thinking that lying is normal and acceptable.  You know Obama...like when you pretended that you didn't know Secretary Clinton was using her own private email server and then Wikileaks discovered that you had been emailing her to the address for some time.
15 | Alice Franks | 7 | 10154037414470950_10154037438100950 | Pay for play she's afraid if not elected she can't pay back for the money she took into the foundation to her big backers her and Obama are afraid 😳
16 | Jeff Quest | 3 | 10154037414470950_10154037441905950 | Really can I sue being a republican. And my federal. Money used on our time to po for a democrat.is this right out treason president is supost to be for all Americans not just democratic people
17 | Kimberly Rogers Byerley | 6 | 10154037414470950_10154037454350950 | Obama don't you have a JOB to do? With all of the crucial things going on in America you would think you could be doing what we pay you to do! And not out campaigning for a criminal!
18 | Linda Burns-Walker | 5 | 10154037414470950_10154037442145950 | I am so ashamed that I voted for him. Obama has been a disaster and is backing a corrupt liar who puts our nation's security at risk. :(
19 | Laurence Arwood | 6 | 10154037414470950_10154037437310950 | Your behavior is not NORMAL at Obama.  More people realize just how much of a liar Hillary Clinton is. Was Obama himself that made the comment when running for the Democratic National Ticket that Hillary Clinton WILL SAY WHAT EVER TO GET A VOTE! Hope America wises up and put her where she belongs...federal prison
20 | Luis Salvatierra | 10 | 10154037414470950_10154037433070950 | This useless stuttering idiot called Obama knows that if Clinton loses, all the shit he has hidden under the rug is going to be exposed. He does not even like her....
21 | Shawn Daniel | 3 | 10154037414470950_10154037552605950 | I thought Obama had a job. What is he doing running around campaigning for Hillary? Besides that politicians have screwed our country up. Its about time we got people in there who know how to get positive things done for the betterment of the country. People who don't just want bragging rights and a fat check.
22 | Tomas Power | 6 | 10154037414470950_10154037526935950 | Should the President be using taxpayer's dollars to campaign for a candidate? Shouldn't he still be working as the President? I'm not too familiar with the Hatch Act but if the FBI director is under scrutiny for using his position to influence then surely the President should be as well.
23 | Marlita G. Swindell | 8 | 10154037414470950_10154037447415950 | Why should we believe him?He's lied for 8 years to the American people. Insurance premiums too expensive, to even afford. No social security increase. Very tiny amount.Giving money to other countries. The list goes on.
24 | Annemarie Schaad | 3 | 10154037414470950_10154037477515950 | And in obamas words "lets go play golf in hawaii" sipping on margaritias whatever!!! get out quick and send the clintons with him too... you cant teach stupid if stupid is already stupid
25 | Eva Parks David | 5 | 10154037414470950_10154037440395950 | In due respect Mr. President! At least he's not a muslim, who gives millions or billions of dollors to terroist like you do and your campaining for one of the biggest crooks known to Washington DC. I would think you need to tuck in your tail and run home! 1 would be ashamed if I were you, or anybody that likes to hear your opinion!

The new coffee cup, which was released exactly a week before Election Day, has some customers questioning whether it's "political brainwashing."
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Pam Cassidy | 71 | 10154037316770950_10154037335075950 | Some customers apparently have too much time on their hands and too much money to waste................their coffee sucks, and who cares about their damned cups?   How many people complained....3 or 4?  Give it a rest....don't like their products, don't buy them.  Does anyone really feel 'politically brainwashed' by a design on an overpriced cup of coffee?  Geesh...
2 | Shane Warren | 47 | 10154037316770950_10154037330500950 | If peace, unity, and love between Americans is "The evil liberal agenda", then what is the Conservative worldview?
3 | Lina Field | 30 | 10154037316770950_10154037349885950 | Starbucks has the right to put whatever they want on their cups. I'm a Catholic and I understand that Starbucks has customers that come from all different kinds of backgrounds. If they want to put pink hippos dancing with yellow elephants on their cups they can. WHO CARES?
4 | Cristi Coles Terrell | 10 | 10154037316770950_10154037407195950 | My God it's a fucking cup of coffee!!! CBS you ought to be ashamed giving this nonsense an ounce of space with all that's going on in the world. Stop encouraging people in their nonsense.
5 | Monica La Fuente Ramirez | 19 | 10154037316770950_10154037338470950 | honestly if your biggest problem is a Starbucks coffee cup, then you are doing pretty good. Next time you get upset about your little coffee cup turn around and look at the people around you bet they are worried about more important things in life
6 | Kurt Miller | 9 | 10154037316770950_10154037366160950 | If it upsets you that a message of inclusiveness is portrayed on a coffee cup, don't buy coffee there. If you find a message of inclusiveness offensive during this time of the year....or any time for that matter, you're missing a painfully obvious point.
7 | Stephenine Avila | 1 | 10154037316770950_10154037525205950 | Well that's one ugly cup but according to the article it IS NOT the holiday cup. One lady said the green cup caused her anxiety..... Really ???? I don't really care about the cup, Starbucks is too expensive and I grew out of their coffee. I go to Peets or my new founded neighborhood coffee place Dranx.....
8 | Derek M. Piec | 4 | 10154037316770950_10154037367445950 | Who cares? Its a damn cup that will get tossed in the trash when you're done with your coffee. Shut up, drink it, and just be done with it! There are more issues to worry about like a criminal lunatic socialist woman that thinks she should be POTUS just because she is woman.
9 | Scott Descoteaux | 1 | 10154037316770950_10154037466140950 | It's easy, don't like the cups or message, don't go to Starbucks. I stopped going years ago because they push their liberal BS all the time. Now if you're a liberal and don't agree with something, you stand outside, picket, whine and cry, and demand they change because it hurts your precious thin skinned feelings.
10 | Joy Wright | 0 | 10154037316770950_10154037644580950 | Are people really that easily influenced? It is a cup! A cup for your coffee, that's all it is! Now I am wondering why any news agency thought this was something to get people riled up about! Honestly! Is there not enough to discuss that it's REALLY important!
11 | Andrew Robert | 0 | 10154037316770950_10154037402155950 | It's that time of the year for the traditional Christian/conservative temper tantrum thrown over disposable coffee cups from an establishment that they don't even patronize, because they're always boycotting it for one reason or another.
12 | Jennifer Ortasic | 6 | 10154037316770950_10154037337745950 | Either make the cup all red, all white, all green or stripe all three colors on it. No writing, no pictures, no problems. Seriously people there are other more important things to worry about then a stupid cup design. If you don't like it then don't buy it
13 | Samantha Devereux | 5 | 10154037316770950_10154037359055950 | Actually...I haven't seen anyone upset or divided. No one commenting on any of these articles about the cup is offended. Making up a non issue click bait story? Creating drama and outrage where there is none? Yeah...
14 | Toni Williams | 0 | 10154037316770950_10154037590875950 | Oh for heavens sales! Starbucks is a business & can do whatever it legally & creatively wishes to do. Why does everyone have to have a bitchy or paranoid say in minutia that has nothing to do with them?
15 | Ismerelda Tullar | 2 | 10154037316770950_10154037342730950 | who cares? i just dont understand the big friggin deal about a cup! do these people bash wendys cup, mcdonalds, and so on? buy your own cup narrcist's and then you can control that! lololo! so dumb!!!
16 | Carrie Gann | 1 | 10154037316770950_10154037651935950 | Last year there was an uproar over their red cups, this year one over green ones... next year, they need to make a cup that is designed to cause an uproar and see what happens, just as a social experiment .

2 | Brittani Dewey | 4 | 10154037206930950_10154037582375950 | My grandmother suffered from Lewy Body Dementia for SEVENTEEN YEARS before it finally took her life. She saw countless doctors who all stood by the diagnosis of Parkinsons. It wasnt until after she was gone and an autopsy performed that we even heard of LBD. SEVENTEEN YEARS LATER. Sadly, autopsy is the only way to diagnose. I thought this article was great, it does mirror symptoms of Parkinsons so closely! We were told in 2013 when she passed away that most doctors hadnt even heard of LBD. It really is a prison, so sad to watch your loved one go through that. My grandmothers brain was donated for research so hopefully she plays a part in finding a cure, or even treatment/detection.

4 | Zachary Ryan Louis Hackett | 0 | 10154037206930950_10154037214180950 | Corporations have been lobbying politicians, to buy their vote and push laws into affect. This is so they discredit the Government slowly, while raising the debt ceiling. Then like we have now. We get a corporate overlord who promises to fix congress. The people are so disappointed they look for the one who says what they feel. Soon the corporate overlord will be in control. An economic super power with the ability to place laws into affect. With a military to enforce. This is how democracy dies, to thunderous applause. It will go smoothly at first, as promised. The people who leaked information to our enemies have their fall women. She's dying and gains favors for her daughter who will succeed her. As long as she takes the blame. Eventually the debt is called in, America Can't pay because the American people have been held down. They used our emotions against us. (If you cannot control your emotions, he who controls your emotions controls you.). The Corporations step in and offer to buy the debt. Then with swift moves like the Nazi party. They've consolidated their power. They'll villinize their enemies and then final step is to institute genocide. It's a plan that's being placed through decades if not centuries.The corporations always had one enemy. The only one who could stop them. The Government. The Government is no longer a threat. This will be a dictatorship.

15 | Chris Steward | 0 | 10154037206930950_10154037244465950 | This video is 4 minutes long and explains how Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton and Anthony Weiner used a private jet with a multi millionaire Jeff Epstein  to travel to a private Island to have sex with underage sex slave children. Very disturbing. Let me talked to you about the ongoing coup and counter coup that is being initiated by the Clintons on the one hand and counter coup by the FBI, the New York police department and other branches of our intelligence community. The important part to remember is also that not all the information has come out with regards to Weiner and his sexting to a fifteen-year-old North Carolina teenager.The real issue underlying a lot of Bill Clinton’s nefarious activities as well as Hillary Clinton sexual activities is the fact that we know that both of them have been a major part and participant of what’s called the ‘Lolita express’ which is a plane owned by Mr. Jeff Epstein a wealthy multi-millionaire who flies down to the Bahamas and allows Bill Clinton and Hillary to engage in sex with minors. That is called pedophilia and as a result of the excellent work that the New York police department does in tracking pedophiliacs they also have a record of both Hillary, Bill and other people associated with the Clintons with regard to pedophilia.So not only will she be charged with obstruction of justice with lying to a prosecutor in the FBI. She will also be charged with pedophilia, sex with minors and other assorted issues. Bill might be brought up again on uncertain charges because those charges still relate to American crime and prosecutorial issues. But I do want to inform you that we are well aware in the intelligence community their activities hasn’t stopped and we’re not talking about one trip to the Bahamas we’re talking about a multiple of 20 or 30 trips that Bill and Hillary did take separately and together on the ‘Lolita express’ to engage in sexual activities with minors. I hope you continue to listen to what we have to say.This is Dr. Stephen Pieczenik and I will keep on informing you as to what is happening in this second American Revolution that we are witnessing in 2016.Thank You Mr. and Mrs. America – Steve Pieczenik TalksPublished on Nov 1, 2016The Clinton Pedophilia Connection - YouTube https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=12zVlaZyX3Q (Share from CM Browser)

4 | Robert Edwards | 4 | 10154037156390950_10154037213560950 | There are a couple of basic reasons why jobs are lost. 1) High corporate taxes motivates companies to move jobs out. 2) The cost of high wages (which we all want) causes companies to move towards automation. Higher minimum wages are forcing entry unskilled job employers like Wendy's to place kiosk in their restaurants to save money. I guess the reality is there's a risk that most every position could one day be automated. We can try to keep more companies from moving that direction by lowering their cost of doing business by lowering their taxes and reducing costly regulations.
5 | Marissa Peart | 4 | 10154037156390950_10154037167410950 | One day everything will be run by robots. There is a security robot that patrols the parking lot of a hospital close by. Give these jobs to real people.
6 | Steve Oroszi | 2 | 10154037156390950_10154037298945950 | Nice try CBS with your straw man argument - Robotics is a recent developement - but what caused all the job loss prior to that that this country has experienced since Bill Clinton signed NAFTA in 1994? That's what Trump is referring. You may be right in a sense though - robots do a better job of filling your fast food order with the push demanding $15/hour. There's your job loss, but otherwise your research sucks!
7 | Robert Michael Dube | 0 | 10154037156390950_10154037424030950 | The run to other countries started b4 Nafta. Textiles went to the South then left the country. Apparently even the low wages of the South were not low enough. Robotics and technology have also had an influence on where jobs go. But with all that,why r prices so damn high for products here and from cheap labor markets. If u pay a worker 50 cents per hr to make a shirt in Vietnam Nam,why does it cost 19.95 here. Greed?

11 | Richard Main | 0 | 10154037156390950_10154037382500950 | Yes, the cause of the loss of most of our American industry has been over regulation, high taxation, litigious public, and bully labor unions that think they own their jobs. It is nearly impossible for many small companies to get started, or to become big when you have to spend millions and even billions for 'approval' processes, licenses, permits, meeting ignorant regulations, and getting politicians on your side to grow. Without that new competition from fledgling businesses, the big one's continue to grease palms in government and get lazy and lose innovation or incentives to get lean and efficient.
12 | Richard Main | 0 | 10154037156390950_10154037388000950 | Robots are created, built, and maintained by people too. If a machine can do a low skilled job for less money, no one in their right mind running a business will refuse that. Much of our labor force wants to just sit back and turn nuts and pack boxes and not get more skilled and value adding intelligence and move up.
13 | Warren Murray | 1 | 10154037156390950_10154037198180950 | It's obvious that trump has nothing to lose, he didn't think he would make it this far in the first place. He has no problem saying what people want to hear to get his way, which is the same way he built his hotels and landscapes by agreeing to have companies build them while he had no intention on paying many of them. He has abused the bankruptcy and court system using his crooked lawyers to find loopholes and file lawsuits to intimidate his creditors. He will do the same thing to the American people, while he leaves our government in shambles as bush did, he will go back to his penthouse and brag about how he swindled his way to the white house. Those who vote trump or don't vote at all, could eventually receive what they deserve. Be careful what you ask for, you just could get it.

Wilmer Valderrama is walking the U.S.-Mexico border to combat the recent "negativity" associated with the topic of immigration: "To be an American is to be an immigrant. To be an immigrant is to look at America and see the American dream."
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Joel Tillman | 646 | 10154037068850950_10154037073020950 | There's nothing wrong with immigration. Just need to do it legally.
2 | Tessa Montegue | 190 | 10154037068850950_10154037110980950 | legal... the KEY everyone seems to be missing is LEGAL.... if we left the US and went illegally to another country they would send us home immediately, jail us, or some even shoot us... there are rules that need to be followed...
3 | Kégan King | 134 | 10154037068850950_10154037079065950 | It's true because white people food is bland as fuck.... without immigrants white people would still thik salt is the pinnacle of flavor..
4 | David Ray | 57 | 10154037068850950_10154037102840950 | Legal. Legal immigrants. That is OUR border and it needs to be US that decides who does and does not cross it. Why does the press still think this bullshit messaging will work? Illegal immigration must STOP. Illegal immigrants must not be granted amnesty again. It doesn't work. We tried it and it doesn't work. So now we need to go the other way entirely,
5 | Patrick Castronovo | 45 | 10154037068850950_10154037086020950 | A gift to who? They take our jobs, they bring down our wages, we pay taxes for them to bring their kids to our overcrowded schools, they go to our hospitals and we pay for it with our taxpayer dollars, they bring their extended families and go on Social Security and drain SS and so many of them commit crimes! A gift to who again? VIVA TRUMP!
6 | Rudy Luna | 16 | 10154037068850950_10154037108295950 | Immigration is a topic that needs to come to the forefront of bipartisan politics with a logical resolution. Identify the undocumented immigrants and provide them a means to legal citizenship within a realistic probationary period. But continue guarding our southern and northern borders. Anyway thing else is uncivilized and inhumane.
7 | Chuck Stanley | 51 | 10154037068850950_10154037111665950 | Legal ones. Yes. My mom spent five year in a refugee camp and came to america legally. She always worked 40 plus hours a week put herself through school and pulled off the american dream. Legally. Legally. Legally.
8 | Javier Ricardo Francisco | 20 | 10154037068850950_10154037098720950 | Legal immigration! No other way. You just can't go back to the old days of border hopping every season. Legally, our it's catapult your ass back!
9 | Chris Dellheim | 12 | 10154037068850950_10154037189885950 | I have no problem with immigrants whatsoever, as long as they come here legally! Many have come and done it legally and have not only prospered but, contributed to America as a whole. BUT, if you come here ILLEGALLY, you are not welcome! You are a burden on our society and, you make it harder for the Legal immigrants to make their way.
10 | Gina Lanape | 9 | 10154037068850950_10154037083900950 | Because I support Hillary 1. Reproductive rights. I’m putting this first because they’re crucial to everything you care about: women’s rights, economic equality, family well-being, access to education, to say nothing of simple human happiness. Hillary is great on this issue: She supports funding for Planned Parenthood, fact-based sex education, and widespread access to birth control (including emergency contraception). She’s also broken new ground by calling for an end to the Hyde Amendment, which bans the use of federal Medicaid funds to pay for poor women’s abortions. (President Obama, whom I’m guessing many Hillary holdouts supported, accepted the amendment as “an American tradition.”) The contrast with Trump, who wants to ban abortion and has filled his campaign with hard-core anti-choicers, couldn’t be starker.2. Health care. As first lady, Clinton worked to pass the State Children’s Health Insurance Program, which funds health care for 6 million children. Now she wants to get resistant red states to expand Medicaid; add a public option to the Affordable Care Act; let those 55 and over buy into Medicare; and offer coverage to undocumented immigrants. She wants to rein in drug companies, and has detailed plans to improve access to care for HIV, mental illness, and more.3. Voting rights. The Republican Party has been working hard to disenfranchise black, Latino, student, and other likely Democratic voters. Clinton supports automatic registration for all citizens when they turn 18; restoring the Voting Rights Act; extending voting rights to ex-felons; and setting a national standard of 20 days for early voting.4. Immigration. Clinton supports a path to citizenship for Dreamers, the young people brought to this country as children by their parents. Unlike Obama, she doesn’t support deporting undocumented immigrants, unless they’re violent criminals or terrorists. This is huge: peace of mind for 11 million people.5. Children and families. Hillary supports 12 weeks of paid parental and family leave; 12 weeks to recover from a serious illness; universal preschool; doubling Head Start; and affordable child care that costs no family more than 10 percent of its income. She also wants to raise the pay of child-care workers and add quality child-care centers to college campuses.6. Education. She supports debt-free public college and free community college, with debt relief for current borrowers. She’s also pledged $25 billion for historically black colleges and universities and other institutions that serve minorities.7. Criminal justice. Clinton will support leg­­islation to end racial profiling and introduce sentencing reforms to end our shocking era of mass incarceration. Nuff said!!!!!
11 | Kelly Warner | 11 | 10154037068850950_10154037151735950 | Then they can come here legally like every other American has done. My grandmother and my grandfather immigrated here in the early 1900s and did it legally. My brother's wife just became a legal citizen from the Philippines and she did all the paperwork and did everything the legal, right way. Nobody is saying that we don't want immigrants!! But coming here illegally is not right and fair to the people who did it the right way. The LEGAL way!!!
12 | Marian Bargiel Hine | 9 | 10154037068850950_10154037166015950 | Absolutely, Josephine Liberante Guastella!  No one I know is opposed to immigrants, only illegal immigrants.  What is so hard to understand about that?
13 | Mrb Bellosillo | 5 | 10154037068850950_10154037177275950 | Correct but they have to come here LEGALLY! Go with the process. 🙏❤️🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸👍 I came here to America Legally. I went with the process and I am now an American Citizen. THAT'S THE AMERICAN DREAM 🇺🇸 GOD BLESS AMERICA!

15 | Will McGinnis | 2 | 10154037068850950_10154037142410950 | In order to fix anything there has to be an atmosphere of cooperation... the Republican house and senate will not discuss the issue... much like the Supreme Court... whoever is elected president... if the Congress won't cooperate... we are still screwed
16 | Valerie Sommers | 1 | 10154037068850950_10154037367535950 | Remember, the Soviet block built a wall, too. How long before we become prisoners of Trump's insane plan. I refuse to turn my back on those in need the way he wants us to. I am the granddaughter of immigrants who became citizens of this country. They wanted a better life for their family's, and so do these folks. The Republicans  tout their Christian values, but I believe Christ would be appalled by their lies and selfish behavior.
17 | Jeff Offshack | 1 | 10154037068850950_10154037257310950 | Without immigrants, there would be no United States of America. Unless you are 100% Native to this land we get to call home, you ARE a descendant of an immigrant too. I have dealt with USCIS for over a decade, and let me tell you, the hoops a person has to jump through to be legal in this country are ridiculous; not to mention the process and expenses of becoming a citizen, that's a whole different set of flaming hoops. It's no wonder people come here illegally. The immigration system needs to be streamlined. Make the process more reasonable and illegal immigration will disappear. I guarantee it.
18 | Rolando Valdez | 0 | 10154037068850950_10154037117690950 | It's all about the money .. offer people who are already here a chance to come out of the shadows and pay for a resident card and watch the money pour in which is what a visa is all about at the end of the day mm they damn money.. charge a couple of thousands and see all those immigrants come out a d they are not all Latinos get fucking real. . kudos to Wilmer for coming down to the valley

That's how Canadian immigration system works. No, to illegal immigration. No country on this planet allows so many illegal immigrants as the US. Exception to that in past two years is Merkel's destruction of Germany, but she just went nuts.
20 | Paul Wilson | 0 | 10154037068850950_10154037217335950 | They are if they are working and not freeloading, are here legally, not protesting in the streets slandering our Nation, not convicted felons, not here to birth a baby and to get on welfare. Able to become part of our society by learning to speaking English and being a member of our society.
21 | Daniel Trout | 1 | 10154037068850950_10154037165020950 | If their countries cared about them at all, they wouldn't risk their lives trying to get out, why don't we discuss why these countries around the world don't give a shit about their own people, try to better their people's lives, help them, instead of oppress them and kill them off
22 | Samuel Lease | 0 | 10154037068850950_10154037178335950 | CBS often has ulterior motives in their stories. I'd call this one a plug for NCIS , starring Wilmer.

23 | Johnny Villanueva | 0 | 10154037068850950_10154037256050950 | We need and respect all immigrants. Everyone knows who built the foundation and constitution.  But we can no longer afford to cover the expense of the illegal immigrant when we have so many homeless And veterans in need.
24 | Inez Cooper | 0 | 10154037068850950_10154037270180950 | What part of ILLEGAL do these fools not understand? I don't care where you came from what color you are but when you go to another country for a vacation you have to have  a passport and they usually ask how long you are staying and the purpose of you being there. We expect the same from people coming here to live.. The worst part is they come here and expect us to change for them they do not try to fit into our society. Why should we have to learn spanish you came here.
25 | Richad Tendou Souji Benbow | 2 | 10154037068850950_10154037168905950 | Yes immigrants are a gift to the country. However I am not sure why people don't see the distinction between those who did it legally by going through the process & those who do it illegally.

She is already vastly knowledgable and perfectly capable of answering any questions without help. You on the other hand couldn't win a debate or have a coherent discussion about policy even if you were given the questions and answers. You have zero grasp of policy or legislation. You can't remember hosting a mobster and then denying you knew him just shows your lack of morals. As the parent of someone with disabilities I would never vote for Trump. Never.

8 | Emily Ringström | 5 | 10154037011305950_10154037307680950 | Let me put this in a way you'll understand, Donnie Boy. Even if she wasn't given any questions in advance, she'd be able to answer them in her sleep, seeing that they were the standard questions, regarding topics you both knew about beforehand, and truly, you're the one who always keep attacking Clinton on her vast experience, so yeah. She didn't need any help. Cheating is what you did to all of your wives(I'm assuming even your current one). (That being said, Donna Brazile made a total fool out of herself, and it wasn't a smart move. But more than anything, it was superfluous.)
9 | Joe Goodman | 24 | 10154037011305950_10154037021740950 | Trump will go on trial end of November accused of fraud and racketeering, and again December 16th accused of child rape. He is a sexual predator, hasn't released his tax returns, and has used his foundation's money to pay his legal fees. And he has abused the family of a war hero.

11 | Vicki Halbeisen | 0 | 10154037011305950_10154037521160950 | First neither one should be put in the White House. Second as I read all these comments from Trump supporters you all act like Trump has done no wrong. Think again people he is just as low of a person as a person can get. Third we just might end up with both Trump and Clinton in jail after the elections. I think Trump will be the first one in jail. So Supporters of Trump come on lets tell all the wrongs with both because they both have bad records. I look at it like this for Trump supporters if he is going to make America great why are all his clothes and shoes made over seas still. Why hasn't he moved them back to show us he wants to make us great again. If he is going to make America great again why does he still not pay taxes? Why are a lot of his rallies being held at his businesses and charging high prices for wine and other things.  I could go on but you won't ask yourselves these questions because you are so blind. Now Clinton Emails well if we are going after her for deleted emails then Colon Powell, Former President Bush and many others need to be looked at Bush deleted more then Clinton did. Her foundation haven't seen any written proof on any thing, but Trump also uses his for other things then what it was meant for so that cancells that out. Yes she has been in Washington a long time but she a lone can't change things when it goes to congress or senate. So that is not really all that fair to say that, now if she and she alone had the say all those years then yes but not the way it goes. Does she lie propably but so does Trump. She knows more on how the goverment works, Trump doesn't know squat. She has showen her taxes and Medical, Trump has not. I will vote third party maybe we might get lucky and someone else besides these two will be in the White House

15 | Jim Bartley | 2 | 10154037011305950_10154037068815950 | MISSING:  Trump tax returns -- "As that empire floundered in the early 1990s, Mr. Trump pressured his financial backers to forgive hundreds of millions of dollars in debt he could not repay. While the cancellation of so much debt gave new life to Mr. Trump’s casinos, it created a potentially crippling problem with the Internal Revenue Service. In the eyes of the I.R.S., a dollar of canceled debt is the same as a dollar of taxable income. This meant Mr. Trump faced the painful prospect of having to report the hundreds of millions of dollars of canceled debt as if it were hundreds of millions of dollars of taxable income."

18 | Nate Correa-Denoncourt | 1 | 10154037011305950_10154037420410950 | Frankie Medina is correct. Clinton did not break a single law, all she did was break protocol, btw those classified files she had were not classified when she received them, they were retro-actively classified after, which means they were public knowledge if they were not classified. Also, many, many other governors, senators and past presidents (Bush) had private email servers. So you cannot single her out without attacking the others as well otherwise that shows your bias and hypocrisy. Moreover, both Bush and Trump have deleted emails under court order not to. Bush deleted 22 million, Trump deleted 10.
19 | Brenda Hebert | 0 | 10154037011305950_10154037289175950 | DEAR HILLARY SUPPORTER///Did you miss the part where she lied to congress? You know that’s called perjury….Did you miss hearing about her being fired from the Watergate staff for being dishonest and unethical?How about those 33,000 emails she deleted and then had the computer wiped clean by professionals? Did you miss that?How about deleting emails after she was subpoenaed to hand them over to the Fed? You realize that’s Obstruction of Justice, right?Oh, and how about getting the rapist of a teenage girl off on rape charges then laughing about it? Did you miss that too?How about when she lied to the American people about Benghazi? You realize that story about the video was a lie, and she knew it was a lie, right?Did you miss her lying to the American people about her emails?How about when she lied about being under sniper fire?Well, then there was those times she lied about lying to the American people. Miss those too?What about that ‘pay for play’ with the Clinton Cash Foundation? That’s kind of hard to miss, huh?Did you miss all those other scandals she was in? You know… TravelGate, FileGate, WhiteWater, Rose law Firm, Vince Foster… she has a long list of scandals, you know...Did you miss her belittling her husband's sexual harassment ( and rape ) accusers? Oh – but the Paula Jones case was settled for $850,000 and Bill was impeached… for lying…You know she was labeled "Extremely careless" about national security by the FBI, right?Have you caught her latest lies about not knowing what the (C) meant on the classified documents? Or, that she can’t remember any briefings on how to handle classified material?Did you know that during her interview with the FBI she said she couldn’t remember 39 times?Did you know that during the Star Investigation she used that same defense of ‘I don’t recall’ 56 times?Did you hear her say she will raise taxes on the middle class?Did you know she had to return stolen items from the White House the last time they left?Have you seen the movies and several documentaries made about her questionable ethics?Don’t you wonder why she made congress and others spend millions and millions of tax dollars having hearings and investigating her numerous times, finding that she lied, that would not have been spent if she would have simply told the truth in the first place ! Facts - all facts !But you are going to vote for her because.... you don't like Donald Trump ? Now, That is insane !Ari GrossmanAri Grossman Hillary once said the easiest part for winning the presidency is to fool the democratic voter. It's the only thing I agree with her.. With the stupid ones and the ones enslaved by their dependence on public assistance, their lack of vision could determine the fate of the United States. Remember that it is not Hillary Clinton that could destroy us. It always comes down to the peoples lack of ingenuity and insight. If Donald Trump wins then this is a great win for our people by showing courage and good insight.. This is what determines a nation or not. I took your advice on keeping our country in our prayers.. It appears that in the last 2 days God has registered to vote. His key objective is to protect Israel and he is doing just that... I already voted and now what remains is my faith.. I'm sure eventually he will decide our time for deliverance and destination.🚂🚃🚃🚃🚃🚃🇺🇸

We may have to redefine "National Security".4) If anything is good for the banks and brokerages, the Clintons support it whole-heartedly since they receive immense contributions from the financial services industry.5) HRC is an experienced politician, and if you like business as usual in Washington, DC, she'll continue the trends that we have seen under Bush and Obama of increasing the power and scope of the federal government.Trump can be an infantile demagogue, but HRC is more of the SOS

8 | Zachary Ryan Louis Hackett | 0 | 10154036961445950_10154037180410950 | Corporations have been lobbying politicians, to buy their vote and push laws into affect. This is so they discredit the Government slowly, while raising the debt ceiling. Then like we have now. We get a corporate overlord who promises to fix congress. The people are so disappointed they look for the one who says what they feel. Soon the corporate overlord will be in control. An economic super power with the ability to place laws into affect. With a military to enforce. This is how democracy dies, to thunderous applause. It will go smoothly at first, as promised. The people who leaked information to our enemies have their fall women. She's dying and gains favors for her daughter who will succeed her. As long as she takes the blame. Eventually the debt is called in, America Can't pay because the American people have been held down. They used our emotions against us. (If you cannot control your emotions, he who controls your emotions controls you.). The Corporations step in and offer to buy the debt. Then with swift moves like the Nazi party. They've consolidated their power. They'll villinize their enemies and then final step is to institute genocide. It's a plan that's being placed through decades if not centuries.The corporations always had one enemy. The only one who could stop them. The Government. The Government is no longer a threat. This will be a dictatorship.

I watched a #PBS Documentary on about Hillary and Trump and "Politics" going forward to the election. There was a portion dedicated to President LBJ. A reporter asked if he thought there were Rigged elections. LBJ looked at a picture on his wall of 5 men surrounding a Ballot Box. The picture was from LBJ's first run for a Government Office.

He previously stated how he thinks dark skinned women are ugly and because his daughter is a millionaire it doesn't count towards her. Why would anyone give this cough syrup sipping gremlin an interview in the first place? His presence alone set black people back. He's a drug addict and a convicted felon with multiple children with multiple baby mamas and a dead beat to half of them. Boy bye 👋🏽👋🏽
2 | Rebekah Prevost | 21 | 10154036913825950_10154037010830950 | Funny how everyone loved him until he had a differing opinion about BLM. All of a sudden he's a sellout and uneducated. I personally couldn't care less because I never was a fan but I couldn't help but find humor in the ignorance of so many of these comments.

How many people can actually connect with something that doesnt personally affect them? It doesn't mean he doesnt acknowledge what it going. And besides  does his opinion change the sitatuation or actually make a difference?

7 | Keri D. Singleton | 8 | 10154036913825950_10154036997285950 | To be clear, I have NEVER liked Lil Wayne and I struggle to see exactly where his (or the scores of other mumbling, eyesores of Black music that now represent Hip Hop and R&B music) talent lies. However, more notably this inarticulate buffoon seems to immerse himself in total ignorance in this interview clip that I was only able to stomach briefly. As offended as I am by his callous, self-centered answers to the interviewer's questions, I am more ashamed of him as I cringe to think of what non-Blacks must think when they see/hear him or his dumb ass contemporaries. Much like the feeling I get when I hear African Americans calling each other "nigga" in the presence of non-Blacks (which makes them feel that there is nothing wrong with using it casually themselves...and in my opinion, ANYONE using the word is an adversary, I am appalled by this unkempt, lyrically challenged idiot from the bayous.

Just felt like they were trash, black trash at that if we being honest. People have their opinions....right or wrong, based how they feel. I know that not all BLM activists are like those idiots who attacked Bernie but those idiots changed my mind about BLM. I don't want to be affiliated with any hate group. Yea i said it.

Religion is used as propaganda on both sides of the War on Terrorism. The cause is "greedy military interventions." We can end this war and prevent terrorism if we change our foreign policy and use more diplomacy. The outsourcing of U.S. jobs and illegal immigration are the result of foreign trade policy that focuses on business interests at the expense of workers' rights and the environment protection. We don't have to build a wall. The answer is to gradually increase wages and regulations abroad not lower them here.We need to get the influence of business out of politics. Higher wages and buying power will actually increase sales for businesses and expand the economy.

Pay attention Hillary has lied to everyone. America is about honesty as a most basic principle. If your child lied this much what would you do. Certainly not elect them to the most powerful office in the world.

Trump says things that are over the top. Hillary says she's never heard men say dirty things about women. Both these candidates are bull****ing Americans. We need to stand-up for America.

So listen to me, Millions of Trump supporters feel this way about Donald J. Trump....."We don't care if the guy swears... or how many times he's been married...or who he voted for, or what his income tax return shows. We want the problems fixed. Yes he's an egomaniac, but we don't care. We know he's not a racist, or bad to women, or all the other things the liberal media is trying to label him with. We know he's raised a good family, and that says a lot about him.The country is a mess because politicians suck, the Republican Party is two faced & gutless, and illegals are everywhere and Radical Islamic Terrorists are openly trying to hurt this country and make the civilized world adjust to them. We want it all fixed!We don't care that Trump is crude, we don't care that sometimes he changed a position.He's showing us he can be a flexible leader as we show him are concerns.We don't care that he fights with Megan Kelly, Rosie O'Donnell, and so many of the elected establishment. We don't care that Kasich, McConnel, the Bush's, and so many other top old and new Republicans refuse to endorse him for their own selfish reasons, and we know what they are. We don't care that he doesn't know the name of some Radical Islamic Terrorists, we don't care that he tried some businesses that didn't work out.Great businessmen built this country of ours in the likes of Rockefeller,Vanderbilt and Carnegie! They had bankruptcy's.This country is weak, bankrupt, our enemies are making fun of us, we are being invaded by illegals, we are becoming a nation of victims, where every Tom, Ricardo and Hasid is a special group with special rights to a point where we don't even recognize the country we were born and raised in, AND  JUST WANT IT FIXED. And TRUMP is the only guy who seems to understand what the people want.He even asks groups of us what we want him to do regarding issues that all of us live by.Wow, For the People,By the People!We're sick of politicians, sick of the Democratic and Republican Party. We're angry about the Iran deal, the budget, treatment of Israel, military weakness, lobbyists, special interests, overpaid politicians with their self serving bills and back room deals, trade deals, loss of jobs, manipulated economic numbers, businesses fleeing,Obamacare needs to be replaced and State borders need to be opened up for real healthcare competition and even the phoney Pay for Play Clinton Foundation.Americans are no longer going to be fooled, and the movement is out to change the direction we're taking. Trump may not be a saint, but he doesn't have lobbyist money holding him, he doesn't have political correctness restraining him, and all you know is that he has been very successful, a good negotiator, he has built a lot of things, he's flexible, and he's also not a politician. And he says he'll fix it. And we believe him because he is too much of an egotist to be proven wrong or looked at and called a liar.Public service has become elected greed. This may be our only chance to have a Non-Politician. He's not perfect, he's 70 years old and made his fortune and I think he's Truly  Genuine in his love of our counrty and wants to make things better for All.... Despite his flaws try and correct the mess, at least for 4 years. We must take the shot, because the consequences of putting Hillary Clinton in office are frightening. There is a tidal wave happening, and its going to overcome much of what's happened to this country and remember that Mike Pence is a Good Man and Politician standing beside Mr. Trump."

NYPD talking about Child Porn ring involvement. This is NOT confirmed, but would gut Dems. #GoHillary #CNNSOTU10:56 PM - 30 Oct 2016Anthony Weiner’s laptop contained details of several trips made by Weiner, Bill and Hillary Clinton on convicted pedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein’s plane to a location referred to “Sex Slave Island.”Hackers are also well aware of the Weiner/Epstein/Clinton connection, as well. On an archived thread on 4chan, an FBI insider alleged that the Clinton email server investigation was just a distraction from the much bigger story concerning the Clinton Foundation and its connection to pedophilia.Sex rings are popular in all governments, but pedophilia is primarily in British parliament & Saudi Arabia, and that’s why HRC and BC love foreign donors so much. They get paid in children as well as money. Dig deep and you can find it. It will sicken you.The email investigation has been one of the worst scandals to ever hit the Clintons, but the investigation into the sex ring was never supposed to be revealed to the public.According to Fox News:Former President Bill Clinton was a much more frequent flyer on a registered sex offender’s infamous jet than previously reported, with flight logs showing the former president taking at least 26 trips aboard the “Lolita Express” — even apparently ditching his Secret Service detail for at least five of the flights.Many are unaware of this investigation. The time stamps on the chat forum are from July of this year, so it is very possible that the FBI has been investigating this for several months or maybe even several years.

You know that’s called perjury….Did you miss hearing about her being fired from the Watergate staff for being dishonest and unethical?How about those 33,000 emails she deleted and then had the computer wiped clean by professionals? Did you miss that?How about deleting emails after she was subpoenaed to hand them over to the Fed? You realize that’s Obstruction of Justice, right?Oh, and how about getting the rapist of a teenage girl off on rape charges then laughing about it? Did you miss that too?How about when she lied to the American people about Benghazi? You realize that story about the video was a lie, and she knew it was a lie, right?Did you miss her lying to the American people about her emails?How about when she lied about being under sniper fire?Well, then there was those times she lied about lying to the American people. Miss those too?What about that ‘pay for play’ with the Clinton Cash Foundation? That’s kind of hard to miss, huh?Did you miss all those other scandals she was in? You know… TravelGate, FileGate, WhiteWater, Rose law Firm, Vince Foster… she has a long list of scandals, you know...Did you miss her belittling her husband's sexual harassment ( and rape ) accusers? Oh – but the Paula Jones case was settled for $850,000 and Bill was impeached… for lying…You know she was labeled "Extremely careless" about national security by the FBI, right?Have you caught her latest lies about not knowing what the (C) meant on the classified documents? Or, that she can’t remember any briefings on how to handle classified material?Did you know that during her interview with the FBI she said she couldn’t remember 39 times?Did you know that during the Star Investigation she used that same defense of ‘I don’t recall’ 56 times?Did you hear her say she will raise taxes on the middle class? Did you know she had to return stolen items from the White House the last time they left?Did you miss the fact that her and Bill Clinton stole 6 Billion Dollars that was meant to rebuild Haiti?Have you seen the movies and several documentaries made about her questionable ethics?Don’t you wonder why she made congress and others spend millions and millions of tax dollars having hearings and investigating her numerous times, finding that she lied, that would not have been spent if she would have simply told the truth in the first place ! Facts - all facts !But you are going to vote for her because.... she's a woman or you don't like Donald Trump? Now, That is Insane!

17 | April Luebke Winn | 1 | 10154036703175950_10154036919305950 | I asked a young  Lady at a game, how she could vote for Trump, a “misogynist, a racist and a bigot”. Here is her answer: Because I use my head to research and find out what candidates really are, not what the media wants me to think.  Because Donald Trump has more women in executive and managerial positions than any comparable company, which tells me he is not a misogynist.  Because he pays these women the same or more than their male counterparts, which tells me looks for capacity and skills in people, not color, gender or race.  Because he fought the West Palm Beach City Council to be able to open his newly purchased club, so he could include blacks and Jews as members, who had been banned until then. This tells me he is not a racist.  Because he has raised wonderful children who have turned out to be outstanding, hard-working and compassionate adults. He must be doing something right.  Because his economic plans makes sense, are conservative in nature, and I vote based of what is best for my family, my friends and my country.  Because everybody, the left and the right are afraid of him, the media is trying to destroy his image, and even foreign governments are voicing their opinions, so he must be doing something right. Clean house maybe?  Because I want a Supreme Court that will uphold the Constitution, not behave as minions of the administration.  I have had enough with judges who are more like political activists than law enforcers.    Because I fear for my family’s safety if the current trend of not confronting blatant terrorism continues – which is a threat to our way of life.  Because I am fed up with the rampant corruption of this administration.  Accountability in government is paramount, and as this administration has demonstrated, it is a foreign concept to them.  Because I am fed up with the political correctness gone wild, and because Trump is not afraid to say what everybody thinks but does not dare to say. A thug is a thug, regardless of color, and that's it.  Because it is about time someone puts America's interests ahead of other countries.  Because I know he recognizes and embraces America's exceptionalism, and will not tour the World apologizing for who we are. That tells me he is a patriot.  Because, unlike HRC, he has actually held a job, worked hard and achieved success.  And last, but not least, because I am more offended by what Hillary does than by what Trump says.shared from Gary Hostetler.

1 | Alan Bonardi | 50 | 10154036659465950_10154036663735950 | It appears that the Democratic party has become even more corrupt during Obama's 8 years as President. I am Registered as an Independent Voter but Democrats have driven me away. I am also disgusted by what Obama has done to our Helath Care and all the lies that were told before Democrats passed the Bill. Obamacare is destroying the hard working people of the Middle Class. Essentially it has increased poverty.

21 | Scott Geer | 0 | 10154036659465950_10154037002260950 | Top 7 Criminal Charges Hillary Clinton Could FaceHillary Clinton could face Charge #1. Perjury: Why not start with a blast from the Clinton past? Hillary Clinton signed documents testifying that she turned over all work-related emails to the State Department, on orders from a federal judge, under penalty of perjury. We already have indisputable proof she violated this sworn statement… thousands of times.The cloud of false statements under oath surrounding Hillary Clinton is thousands of times thicker than the one around Bill. Democrats seem to have found a hidden clause in the Constitution that says Clintons can never be prosecuted for perjury, but Madame Secretary is really stress-testing that particular privilege of Clintonhood. One would think the federal judiciary had some interest in establishing that sworn documents must be taken seriously.Hillary Clinton could face Charge #2. Obstruction of Justice: Bill Clinton’s primary motive for committing perjury was to obstruct justice—it was the second count in his impeachment. (The justice he was obstructing was a sexual harassment suit from Paula Jones, at a time when liberals insisted sexual harassment was the most overlooked, under-prosecuted crime in the legal code.)Hillary’s thousands of perjury counts are also related to the obstruction of justice. She held back documents she didn’t want Congress to see. She subverted the Freedom of Information Act, which is a law, not a lovely suggestion.  Most media timelines of the Clinton email scandal are either incomplete or deliberately obtuse, because they almost never accurately relate how her secret server was discovered. For example, these timelines from USA Today, CNN, and ABC News all get it wrong.Sharyl Attkisson, who was a participant in the story, has an accurate timeline that makes the important point Clinton-friendly media outlets don’t want to talk about: we know about the secret server because the State Department was sued for failing to respond to FOIA requests. The State Department’s official story is that they were surprised to discover Clinton was withholding thousands of documents on her private computer.That’s straight-up obstruction of justice, in cases involving multiple federal courts, as surely as Bill Clinton’s impeachable offense of obstructing the Paula Jones suit. Clinton may become untouchable if the American people allow her into the White House, but the lawsuits don’t evaporate, and neither do the angry judges.Hillary Clinton could face Charge #3. Bribery: After the FBI set off a headline earthquake by re-opening the Clinton email investigation, we learned that several other FBI investigations of Clintonworld have been quietly in progress for some time. One of those investigations is digging into bribery allegations against the Clinton Foundation. The FBI agents working on these cases were reportedly very angry that top Bureau and Justice Department officials were pressuring them to drop their investigations.The most attention-grabbing of these suspicions concerns an FBI official, Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, whose wife received an inexplicably huge political donation from Clinton bagman Terry McAuliffe, currently the governor of Virginia. The timing of this donation was so convenient that even the Left side of the blogosphere has produced some uneasy speculation that McCabe probably should have recused himself from all things Clinton-related.Well, he didn’t recuse himself, and the conflicts of interest are so apparent that the lack of a chiseled-in-stone quid pro quo might not be enough to kill this case off. After all, corrupt officials aren’t usually dumb enough to write down their quid pro quo agreement.Hillary Clinton could face Charge #4. Pay for Play: There has also been recent confirmation that the FBI has investigated influence-peddling allegations against the Clinton Foundation, which was so obviously used for that purpose that it’s funny to watch Clinton apologists insist nothing can be proven in a court of law. Some of the most vigorous infighting within the Bureau reportedly concerns whether pay-for-play investigations should move forward.WikiLeaks has exposed emails from Clinton insiders that openly discuss how the Foundation was part of a network that steered millions of dollars to “Bill Clinton Inc.” Even longtime members of the Clinton syndicate professed themselves troubled by these operations. They were also unhappy with arrangements like Hillary Clinton’s agreement to speak in Morocco after a $12 million donation to the Clinton Global Initiative.It’s entirely possible that more documentation about these suspicious Clinton Foundation dealings will come to light after the election, especially if some of the people Clinton took money from grow upset with her. It’s downright dangerous to have a President with so many strings attached.Hillary Clinton could face Charge #5. Illegal Use of a Nonprofit Organization: There are many laws governing the management of charitable organizations, generally intended to prevent them from becoming money-laundering operations, ripoff operations, and vehicles for political influence peddling. The Clinton Foundation and its galaxy of related operations may eventually find itself answering some questions about compliance with those laws, assuming the IRS decides to stop focusing its efforts on hassling mom-and-pop pro-life groups and kitchen-table Tea Party outfits. If the Foundation is ever held to account for any other impropriety, charges of abusing a nonprofit should be part of the legal package as well.Hillary Clinton could face Charge #6. Racketeering: Former prosecutor Andrew McCarthy has recently observed that Hillary Clinton’s abuse of the State Department looks an awful lot like a “racketeering enterprise,” which could trigger the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act of 1971, more widely known as RICO. McCarthy explained:Under RICO, an “enterprise” can be any association of people, informal or formal, illegitimate or legitimate – it could be a Mafia family, an ostensibly charitable foundation, or a department of government. It is a racketeering enterprise if its affairs are conducted through “a pattern of racketeering activity.” A “pattern” means merely two or more violations of federal or state law; these violations constitute “racketeering activity” if they are included among the extensive list of felonies laid out in the statute.Hillary Clinton could face Charge #7. Fraud: Wall Street analyst Charles Ortel has been building a case that the “Clinton Charity Network,” as he calls the complete system of Clinton operations, has committed “charity fraud of epic proportions.” In part, he refers to discrepancies between donor accounts and the Clinton Foundation’s books.Others have pointed out how the Clinton Health Access Initiative has essentially ignored New York state law for years, without a peep from Attorney General Eric Schneiderman (who just happens to be part of the Clinton campaign’s “leadership council.”) There are some interesting differences between the paperwork CHAI submitted to the IRS and what it submitted to the state of New York, which has more specific requirements about identifying foreign donors.In addition to getting a free pass on perjury, the Clintons are traditionally allowed to violate tax laws without penalty, eventually refiling paperwork when “errors” are discovered years after the fact. Another round of whoops-my-bad, no-harm-no-foul “refiling” during a Hillary Clinton presidency would be embarrassing, especially if she’s busy trying to ratchet up taxes on everyone else."

BREAKING: Suspect captured in slayings of two Iowa police officers: http://cbsn.ws/2eUNn8H
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Farrah Lovinglife Pollock | 243 | 10154036558745950_10154036581285950 | Captured alive....killed two cops and captured ALIVE!!! Damn but be BLACK and sell cigarettes or cds killed on site!!! Tf?!?!?
2 | Erin Danielle J | 98 | 10154036558745950_10154036614245950 | So... he was upset because black people at a football game didn't stand up for the anthem and sat in peaceful protest. He caused a disturbance and was asked to leave by police. Out of anger, he ambushes two officers. 'Merica. Never change.
3 | Micheal Rogers | 120 | 10154036558745950_10154036566765950 | Many conservative whites are upset that the shooter is not black. It is a white confederate flag waving patriot.
4 | Windi Liberus | 53 | 10154036558745950_10154036577540950 | Slap on the white wrist and rehabilitation nothing to see here boy & girls
5 | Andre Buckner | 46 | 10154036558745950_10154036678420950 | You guys are making the black community look real stupid today. It doesn't matter if hes alive or not it should  just matter that he's captured. As a black man myself I'm embarrassed for these dumb ass comments and as a man that lives here in the city of Des Moines I'm just happy he's behind bars.
6 | Mahogany Brown | 21 | 10154036558745950_10154036674500950 | Well lokk at that folks it wasn't blm. Smh white people have been saying it was blm all morning. White people on this thread hate hearing about race. But point it out every chance they get. If you want us to stop bitching about race then tell your fellow white friends to stop using subtle racism. it exists whether yoy want to except the truth or not.
7 | Joe Goodman | 32 | 10154036558745950_10154036564305950 | Don't forget to mention the suspects actually YouTube channel with confederate flags etc......The Urbandale School District confirmed to the Des Moines Register that a man named Scott Greene was removed from the football stadium that day for waving a confederate flag. The stadium is at the same intersection where the Urbandale police officer was killed Wednesday morning, the newspaper reports.

9 | Janet E Strickland Costello | 9 | 10154036558745950_10154036633230950 | It does not matter if he was captured alive or not. His life is now over. So who gives a damn what this POS skin color is
10 | George Bassplayer | 6 | 10154036558745950_10154036898370950 | If this guy were a person of color or a Muslim, he'd be DEAD and The Delusional " Law and Order" candidate would be beating his chest and telling us how Hillary and Obama are to blame.
11 | Lisa Franklin | 17 | 10154036558745950_10154036681960950 | If I can get reincarnated, I want to come back as a white male. You can do anything. You rape women and kids and get probation. You can get in a standoff for weeks and not die or go to jail. You can even shoot police and get taken alive. You can even be a president and start wars or run for president and be a sexual assaulter and people will still love you. Yes, I want to come back as a white male so I can be a home grown terrorist.
12 | Nicole Carter | 6 | 10154036558745950_10154036760350950 | It's quiet in here all morning before the identity was revealed it was BLM and the athletes whining!!!! But nah it's one of your radical ass (mentally ill)people. So it's quiet white people in here defending this degenerate. Smh!!!
13 | Shirlene McColley | 0 | 10154036558745950_10154037338410950 | He gets to tell why he killed two cops. Really? The fuckery must stop such as kill blacks who haven't harmed or killed not one anybody and unarmed but let whites who rob, steal, rape, molest and kill have their day in court. So disturbing.
14 | Steven Bailey | 0 | 10154036558745950_10154037335835950 | I used to live in the area where one of the cops was shot. The truth is it had nothing to do with politics so don't bring up politics. It had to do with a pos that was upset about being removed from a football game for harassing people not standing for the national anthem and waiving a confederate flag. Leave race out of the shooting of the cops and the fact that the shooter is still alive. He turned himself in peacefully. Please for the sake of the families effected by this tragedy stop arguing over politics and race. Simply show respect for the fallen officers.
15 | Jessica Santos | 2 | 10154036558745950_10154036763620950 | Instead of being glad that this pos has been captured, even if it was alive, you all are bitching that he wasn't shot dead isn't that something, smh. The important thing is that he is off the street and not a danger to anyone else, civilian or law enforcement.
16 | Yolanda Wilson | 2 | 10154036558745950_10154036934625950 | Wow he still alive, but Black and Brown Brothers are killed. Why can't they be taken alive too? Glad they caught him. Even if he was white and didn't die. Point is he caught.
17 | Sandy Luevano | 3 | 10154036558745950_10154036765440950 | After reading some of these comments you can see that racism is still a very large problem in every ethnic background , some people are more stupid than others.Two human beings lost their life the person that did it was caught and all you read is racism forgetting the fact that men lost their lives
18 | Alanna Manfredini | 0 | 10154036558745950_10154036804280950 | They released the names of the officers on another site. So tragic. One was a father and the other a young man. ( had to edit, not sure if i read correctly) Greene was taken to the hospital for "seizures". What a piece of ****

Too many energy drinks resulted in this man being diagnosed with acute hepatitis.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Mindy Sandlin | 53 | 10154036443005950_10154036625090950 | This article is misleading. The guy had untreated hep c. His liver was already at risk and had been ravaged by a disease for who knows how long. I agree energy drinks are bad, and should be drank in moderation If at all. But the article made it seem as if his energy drink consumption was the reason for his acute hepatitis.
2 | Brent Mahlan | 4 | 10154036443005950_10154036762485950 | One time, just about every work day, I mix my one rockstar with a scoop or two of pre workout and get by just fine. Doctor says my BP is good and heart healthy..all depends on any pre existing continue and the person
3 | Adrina G. Wynecoop | 3 | 10154036443005950_10154036627035950 | I'm not surprised at all, the crap they put in those are gross. Caffeine Itself, if not in moderation, can cause horrible problems. Especially if you're a woman, we can have more risks than men. Bone loss, vitamin deficiencies, particularly low iron that I can think of. They will probably eventually cause a person to get autoimmune disease among many other health issues!
4 | Kevan Pierson | 0 | 10154036443005950_10154036581065950 | The most energy drinks i drunk was 2 a day. That can still cause problems depending on what brand you're drinking. Wired was one of the strongest out there. I had to take it easy and go to just 1 a day after it start messing with my kidneys.
5 | Amanda Lee Cass | 3 | 10154036443005950_10154036666905950 | I ended up in the hospital from energy drinks. Gave myself a condition called gastritis. HOLES in my stomach. Was on meds for a month. Mind you, this was damn near 11yrs ago when I graduated high school. But, I was working, going to school, no time for sleep... thought I was doing myself a favor by pounding energy drinks to make it through. All I did was hurt myself.
6 | Andrew Paul | 1 | 10154036443005950_10154036894760950 | From a medial point of view, any inflammation of the liver can be characterised as hepatitis. Hepato is Greek for liver. Adding the suffix -itis to a word means inflammation. The hepatitis a/b/c etc are simply characterisations of infections who's primary symptoms is swelling of the liver leading to disfunction.

13 | T.R. Williams | 2 | 10154036443005950_10154036719375950 | The energy drink didn't give him hepatitis, Article misleading. I urge you all to open a can and pour it down your sink, it acts like draino, Or pour some on rust, this is what it does to your body. All soda, and energy drinks are dangerous.
14 | Courtney Schell | 13 | 10154036443005950_10154036483090950 | Rodney Feaster Just drink coffee. Coffee doesn't give you hepatitis.

She's a New World Order Globalist who hates America and the sovereignty of all the nations, not just America. She wants a ONE WORLD GOVERNMENT and ONE WORLD RELIGION....that's their AGENDA.2. She's a LIAR about everything...and she's damn good at it. Her father, Satan is the master of all lies. Nuff said.3. She doesn't care about homosexual and women's rights....as a matter of fact, she doesn't care about anyone's rights, just hers and her global NWO buddies and it's a very small club. You're not invited.4. Her resume speaks for itself. Her whole career has been nothing but lies, corruption, criminal activity and SECRECY! That's how you know she's wicked, they do their dealings in darkness behind closed doors. Remember, she said she has TWO FACES....one in public....the other in private."Ye shall know them by their FRUITS!" ~ Jesus ChristWoe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!

“I think he’s a man with a very short attention span,” Al Franken said of Trump.

8 | Scott Descoteaux | 6 | 10154036361810950_10154036534075950 | So the headline of this says "Al Franken weighs in on Clinton's trust issues", then the quote you put on top is. “I think he’s a man with a very short attention span,” Al Franken said of Trump.Do you not see the irony in that at all? That's just hilarious! Talk about short attention. Democrats hate that they know she is the most corrupt person in the history of this country, so they pivot any chance they can to stop talking about her. She's pure evil!!

10 | Mary Linderberg | 4 | 10154036361810950_10154036468625950 | I asked a young  Lady at a game, how she could vote for Trump, a “misogynist, a racist and a bigot”. Here is her answer: Because I use my head to research and find out what candidates really are, not what the media wants me to think.  Because Donald Trump has more women in executive and managerial positions than any comparable company, which tells me he is not a misogynist.  Because he pays these women the same or more than their male counterparts, which tells me looks for capacity and skills in people, not color, gender or race.  Because he fought the West Palm Beach City Council to be able to open his newly purchased club, so he could include blacks and Jews as members, who had been banned until then. This tells me he is not a racist.  Because he has raised wonderful children who have turned out to be outstanding, hard-working and compassionate adults. He must be doing something right.  Because his economic plans makes sense, are conservative in nature, and I vote based of what is best for my family, my friends and my country.  Because everybody, the left and the right are afraid of him, the media is trying to destroy his image, and even foreign governments are voicing their opinions, so he must be doing something right. Clean house maybe?  Because I want a Supreme Court that will uphold the Constitution, not behave as minions of the administration.  I have had enough with judges who are more like political activists than law enforcers.    Because I fear for my family’s safety if the current trend of not confronting blatant terrorism continues – which is a threat to our way of life.  Because I am fed up with the rampant corruption of this administration.  Accountability in government is paramount, and as this administration has demonstrated, it is a foreign concept to them.  Because I am fed up with the political correctness gone wild, and because Trump is not afraid to say what everybody thinks but does not dare to say. A thug is a thug, regardless of color, and that's it.  Because it is about time someone puts America's interests ahead of other countries.  Because I know he recognizes and embraces America's exceptionalism, and will not tour the World apologizing for who we are. That tells me he is a patriot.  Because, unlike HRC, he has actually held a job, worked hard and achieved success.  And last, but not least, because I am more offended by what Hillary does than by what Trump says.

13 | Will McGinnis | 2 | 10154036361810950_10154036867075950 | All you folks who are bashing Clinton... need to honestly look at Trump as well... neither candidate is what we might call 'morally superior'... Trump is a mess as well.. that said... it comes down to policy... Frankly, Clinton has policies that will do more for the middle class than any other candidate... so if you can put aside all the business of sending one or the other to hell... take an honest look at their policies & vote your conscience
14 | Steve Lynn | 6 | 10154036361810950_10154036374540950 | I hope Trump don't forget about bringing those 20 million very high paying jobs back from overseas and the almost free high quality health insurance for all Americans. Not to forget Americans will have very little tax to pay.

I mean total madness. Who's fault is that anyway? Voters--You allowed it by way of your passivity and half-interested foolishness. With over 300 million, no reasonable person could say these candidates represent our best. Of course we know you will blame someone other than yourself for the predicament. Rather than pondering the non sequiturs raised by the mass media, take a moment to consider what is your karma in this situation?
17 | John Hourihan | 0 | 10154036361810950_10154036581610950 | In 1964 I graduated from high school. I was awake, informed and tuned in to the country around me. I saw the vicious truth of what we are on the verge of ushering back into our country. No matter which candidate you support, please listen to what I saw back then. I had seen the courage of Rosa Parks and of the Freedom Riders. I watched churches burned with people, some of them children, inside. I watched boys killed for “looking at” a white woman. I watched the helpless president try his best to stop the murders across the southern part of our country. Police cruisers pulling over cars and then killing the occupants if they were black. Arrests were made, they weren’t charged with murder. They were charged with withholding the civil rights of the people they killed. The charges didn’t matter. All-white juries found the police officers innocent. In 1963 I saw the KKK torch a church and burn to death four little girls because of the color of their skin. State legislators stood up against the federal government in an effort to continue the policies of segregation. These officials were active members of these hate groups. Now these groups, KKK, white supremacists, anti-semite, the entire alt. right hate groups are en masse supporting one candidate, Donald Trump, because as the leader of the KKK says, “His policies are our policies.” When you look at that ballot in front of you in the next few days please ask yourself if you are ready to vote for a return to those days and the days decades earlier when the violence was even worse. This is what Donald Trump, a proven racist, means by “Make America Great Again.” Please don’t bring these people back to power. Please vote for Clinton.
18 | Karen Drennen | 1 | 10154036361810950_10154036880335950 | I am hoping that if Trump should win, the news that is reported from your network should not insinuate a hatred for the Trump supporters that is presently viewed in your broadcasts. As you know, the DNC has been the source of violence incited at Trump rallies. Please do not follow suit.
19 | David James | 8 | 10154036361810950_10154036386900950 | Hillary is destroying the Democrat party and I can no longer vote for her, every week it's something else!
20 | Warren Murray | 0 | 10154036361810950_10154036583505950 | While the country is divided on who is the best candidate, neither can run on their history as a person. Some say Trump is because he is was not a politician and Hillary had her woes as one. Others say Hillary because Trump has a questionable business, womanizing tax evasion and racial discrimination past. It all boils down to whose character and plan for American we like the best, and while many of our opinions are clouded by racism, sexism, political affiliation and partiality, we must not lose focus on what matters. It's not who has lived a perfect life in their past because none of us are without sin or mistakes, but who do we trust to hold the future of our country and children in mind while they make decisions in office. Hillary is use to being accountable to the people, while Trump is use to being accountable to no one, not even his wives, and that's dangerous. We must choose wisely !
