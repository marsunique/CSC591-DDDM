More than 40 million people have already voted. That's nearly a third of the total vote in 2012.

Do you have young people within your family 👪 members who are not registered to vote??!! Do you advocate for others to our youth in general to vote??!!If the answer to any above questions is NO, then Just think about the following!! Out of the 206 million eligible voters, only 75 million voted last November/2014 and out of those 206 million eligible voters, 64 million eligible voters aren't even registered to vote and we clearly have established data that clearly indicates that the vast majority of the 64 million unregistered voters are aligned with the Democrats, not to mention that also the vast majority of the 64 million unregistered voters are "Hispanics" and African Americans!!!

2 | George Adams | 0 | 10154805546374729_10154806097799729 | STOP Election Fraud: Do NOT use Soros voting machines. Please vote to put Billery/Killery on trial for TREASON. She broke the law and belongs in jail. She risked our country and put our people in harm's way, and had Democratic whistleblowers murdered. Not only Billery is very dangerous, she will bring this country to a security collapse with cutting our military and a financial collapse by choosing a fight with Russia and ruining small businesses while sending all jobs overseas. Please don't vote for the DEVIL. This country needs to be free and strong, where people have a real chance at the American Dream. Billery should have never been the Democratic candidate to start with and stole the nomination from Bernie Sanders. She is the most corrupt candidate ever and works for the elite new world order who wants to make people obsolete with new robotic technology. She brings with her sinister powers and so do not be fooled by her fake smiles and phony consideration for the working man, or woman. Vote Donald Trump and save our nation. CNN until now has been reporting lies and gossip that was never admissible in court about Donald Trump. But tonight CNN, the yellow tabloid, must for a change act like a real news network and report the truth. Pray to God and pray hard that Donald Trump is our next President. We need to stop criminal refugees from coming here and take care first of our American veterans. We need to work on better trade deals so manufacturing will be back in America. We need to stop paying for parasites! The election is at stake with Billery's dirty tricks and it must be watched closely. Donald Trump is our only hope before Killery turns this country to a worse version of 1984 by George Orwell. I hope the next thing Trump do as our new much admired President is expose all the dirt, every affair and sexual indecency of every CNN reporter, including Anderson, Gloria, and that self righteous long brown haired woman. Then, HC must be locked up for the rest of her life. If you don't want more zombies on the streets, if you don't want to give up cash, and guns and freedom of speech, VOTE for TRUMP!!! We can't afford the status quo! We're losing our country!!! Dare, you pathetic paid patsies online of HC to call me names and I will take screen shots and sue you for libel!!! This nation is SICK of the Clinton cover ups. Stop totalitarianism! CNN=Clinton News Network. Hope Trump fires many of you when he is elected! Let us pray November 8 brings the change that we so desperately need. Long Live Trump, our savior!I am:1) A married WOMAN2) Have no kids3) Intelligent and educated4) Independent politically5) Trump Supporter, Truth Supporter, Freedom Supporter and a Proud American 6) Not a racist, respectful of ALL religions and races 7) Very worried about how globalism will annihilate our country as we know itWe all know main stream media and the system are rigged. We must never take our freedom for granted. On November 8 stand the lines as long as they are because our liberty and justice for all are at stake. Let us pray Billery/Killery will be arrested soon, AMEN. Please share and God Bless. P.S. For crying outloud, stop briefing the enemy Billery if you want to keep the U.S. safe!Hellery/Liary needs to have her clearance removed. Clean the swamp America! Huma is most likely a spy and Loretta Lynch, Justice Department director is as vicious as Killery, pleading the Fifth when Congress asked her about why so many millions of dollars "disappeared" and ended in Iran! We MUST put a stop to the traitors and tried them all for TREASON. PPS Huma=married to a pedophile. Killery=married to a rapist. That's how they respect women, ha???!!! JOKE! We ALL know LIARY is a pathological liar and an urgent danger to the sovereignty of the U.S. Please be careful about CNN too-they are ANTI AMERICAN. Who knows what more harm Killery did to our beloved country. Pray for our country and Trump. Ask yourself who is helping Hillery with the cover up and why...We want our country back!How many more premium hikes in Obamacare no one can afford??? How many more violent crimes in the streets??? This is Hillary's America. Hillary=a most dangerous TYRANT.Breaking!!! LIARY's Clinton security clearance is revoked AND Huma is under house arrest for suspicion of espionage. Be aware people, Hillary is an enemy of the state!At any rate, Killery will be impeached as planned by Congress. She is guilty of EVERY despicable trick to deny deny deny. Be careful of this evil woman who will bring poverty to America. Be careful of what you hear on main stream media. They are all sponsored by shadow government.Obama sure has a lot to lie for Hillary because he is tied on all her scams and frauds. Worse off, he bankrupt the American people by forcing an unaffordable healthcare rip off system that makes us hard working people pay for all the illegals and criminals in this country. Citizens of Wisconsin, Minnesota, Pennsylvania and Michigan: PLEASE do not let the country fall under the TOTALITARIAN regime of SCARY CORRUPT MURDEROUS KILLERY.Please, I am beseeching of you, my fellow citizens. It's our only and last chance to clean the swamp and get rid of the filthy politics as usual. It does not matter if you are Republican or Democrat or Independent, you must vote for Trump to STOP the global oligarchy that chose Billery and Kain as puppets. I am not paid by anyone! I love my country so much and I am so afraid of losing it to sinister powers. We have already lost so much by the dirty tricks of the establishment. America belongs to its people, not the weathly elite that wants to enslave us all. Please, we have one last chance to get it right, before scenarios that are taken from Orwell's 1984 will become reality her. God Bless the USA and Donald Trump. ONLY PAPER BALLOT.Do not let Wall Street and foreign groups take over America, my home sweet home! Vote Trump to ensure a future for the next generations!Vote Trump to ensure America remains FREE and SAFE. Fight for Our Constitution! Watch the Hillary's America movie and find out the truth for yourself!Government that controls the main stream media is really a dictatorship! Let's fix the "error" of Obama in the White House! Let's NOT let Killery and him hide the TRUTH from the American People. Let's stop the conspiracies to cancel the Second Amendment, Cash, Gold and private cars. Let's make sure our banks remain all American. Let's breathe fresh air into the economy. HC will anyway have to be impeached and many years of prison await her. Do not let election fraud happen. See something? SAY SOMETHING. Open Eyes people...This is a fight against the DEVIL. If you love America, DO NOT VOTE for KILLERY!!! Billery are buying illegal votes. Fight for America, for real freedom, before we become a dictatorship like North Korea. That's what you will be getting with LIARY!!!CNN=such hypocrites. Anderson not looking too smug tonight. Hope Trump finds out you are not a saint. Hope there will be new laws concerning REAL NEWS REPORTING and not reporting biased BS and if any harm done by reporting filthy rumors there will be JAIL TIME. Why did you try to silence Rudy Giuliani when he spoke of the criminal charges against Billary? You think America wants a criminal in the White House? And to the traitors who want to buy a flight ticket out of here if Trump is elected-go right ahead, leave already do us all a huge favor and don't let the door get in your way! Please, the country needs real patriots! ALERT: CNN AKA CLINTON/CORRUPTION NEWS NETWORK ARE IN COLLUSION WITH BILLERY. SO ARE OTHER NEWS NETWORKS WHO HAVE ALREADY PRONOUNCED BILLERY A WINNER.DO NOT TRUST MAIN STREAM MEDIA. THEY HAVE A VERY DARK ANTI DEMOCRATIC AGENDA. BTW, won't matter how much make up and hair extensions Beyonce puts on-STILL UGLY.Say NO to Billery's Mafia. BTW, the rock star as a campaign strategy was pathetic!!!

God is running things now my freinds.
2 | Patti Pryor | 0 | 10154805562539729_10154805938309729 | Part TWO>< Khan spent seven years, from 2000 to 2007, in the Washington, D.C., office of then-Hogan & Hartson,” Polantz wrote. “He served as the firm’s manager of litigation technology. Although he did not practice law while at Hogan, Khan was well versed in understanding the American courts system. On Thursday night, he described his late son dreaming of becoming a military lawyer.”But representing the Clinton Foundation backing Saudi Arabian government and having one of its lobbyists bundle $50,000-plus for Clinton’s campaign are hardly the only places where the Khan-connected Hogan Lovells D.C. mega-firm brush elbows with Clinton Cash. The firm also handles Hillary Clinton’s taxes and is deeply connected with the email scandal whereby when she was Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton set up a home-brew email server system that jeopardized classified information handling and was “extremely careless” according to FBI director James Comey.“A lawyer at Hogan & Hartson [Howard Topaz] has been Bill and Hillary Clinton’s go-to guy for tax advice since 2004, according to documents released Friday by Hillary Clinton’s campaign,” The American Lawyer’s Nate Raymond wrote in 2008, as Hillary Clinton ran for president that year. “The Clintons’ tax returns for 2000-07 show combined earnings of $109 million, on which they paid $33 million in taxes. New York-based tax partner Howard Topaz has a broad tax practice, and also regularly advises corporations on M&A and executive compensation.”Breitbart News’ Patrick Howley, in a deep investigative piece on Hillary Clinton’s email scandal, late last year uncovered how Topaz’s firm—which employed Khan while Topaz did Hillary Clinton’s taxes—is also connected to the email scandal.“Topaz was a partner at Hogan & Hartson, which later merged to become known as Hogan Lovells, where Topaz continues to practice. The firm’s lawyers were major donors to Hillary Clinton’s first presidential campaign,” Howley wrote.For her private email system, Clinton used a spam filtering program MX Logic.“Hogan & Hartson handled the patent for MX Logic’s email-filtering program, which McAfee bought the small company for $140 million in 2009 in order to acquire,” Howley wrote. “The MX Logic company’s application for a trademark for its SPAMTRAQ program was filed in 2004 on Hogan & Hartson stationery and signed by a Hogan & Hartson attorney. Hogan & Hartson has been responsible for MX Logic annual reports. The email company’s Clinton links present more evidence that Clinton’s political and legal establishment was monitoring her private email use.”If that all isn’t enough, that same Hogan & Hartson law firm—now Hogan Lovells—employed Loretta Lynch, the current Attorney General of the United States. Lynch infamously just a few weeks ago met with Bill Clinton, Hillary’s husband and the former president, on her private jet in Phoenix just before clearing Hillary Clinton of any wrongdoing when it came to her illicit private email server system.Khan’s own website for his own personal law firm KM Khan Law Office shows he represents clients in the business of buying visas to enter the United States. One of his specific areas of practice, according to the website, is “E2 Treaty Investors, EB5 Investments & Related Immigration Services.”Sen. Chuck Grassley, the chairman of the U.S. Senate’s Judiciary Committee, has detailed how the EB5 immigration program is “riddled with flaws and corruption.”“Maybe it is only here on Capitol Hill—on this island surrounded by reality—that we can choose to plug our ears and refuse to listen to commonly accepted facts,” Grassley said in a statement earlier this year. “The Government Accountability Office, the media, industry experts, members of congress, and federal agency officials, have concurred that the program is a serious problem with serious vulnerabilities. Allow me to mention a few of the flaws.”From there, Sen. Grassley listed out several of the “flaws” with the EB5 immigration program that Khan works in:– Investments can be spent before business plans are approved. – Regional Center operators can charge exorbitant fees of foreign nationals in addition to their required investments.  – Jobs created are not “direct” or verifiable jobs but rather are “indirect” and based on estimates and economic modeling.– Jobs created by U.S. investors are counted by the foreign national when obtaining a green card, even if EB-5 money is only a fraction of the total invested.– Investment funds are not adequately vetted. – Gifts and loans are acceptable sources of funds from foreign nationals.– The investment level has been stagnant for nearly 25 years.– There’s no prohibition against foreign governments owning or operating regional centers or projects.– Regional centers can be rented or sold without government oversight or approval.– Regional centers don’t have to certify that they comply with securities laws.  – There’s no oversight of promoters who work overseas for the regional centers.– There’s no set of sanctions for violations, no recourse for bad actors.– There are no required background checks on anyone associated with a regional center.– Regional centers draw Targeted Employment Area boundaries around poor areas in order to come in at a lower investment level, yet the jobs created are not actually created in those areas.– Every Targeted Employment Area designation is rubberstamped by the agency.– Adjudicators are pressured to get to a yes, especially for those politically connected. – Visas are not properly scrutinized. – Visas are pushed through despite security warnings.– Files and applications lack basic and necessary information to monitor compliance.– The agency does not do site visits for each and every project.– There’s no transparency on how funds are spent, who is paid, and what investors are told about the projects they invest in.That’s not to mention the fact that, according to Sen. Grassley, there have been serious national security violations in connection with the EB5 program that Khan works in and around already. In fact, the program—according to Grassley—was used by Middle Eastern operatives from Iran to attempt to illicitly enter the United States.“There are also classified reports that detail the national security, fraud and abuse. Our committee has received numerous briefings and classified documents to show this side of the story,” Grassley said in the early February 2016 statement. “The enforcement arm of the Department of Homeland Security wrote an internal memo that raises significant concerns about the program. One section of the memo outlines concerns that it could be used by Iranian operatives to infiltrate the United States. The memo identifies seven main areas of program vulnerability, including the export of sensitive technology, economic espionage, use by foreign government agents and terrorists, investment fraud, illicit finance and money laundering.”Maybe all of this is why–as Breitbart News has previously noted–the Democratic National Convention made absolutely no mention of the Clinton Foundation or Clinton Global Initiative. Hillary Clinton’s coronation ceremony spent exactly zero minutes of the four nights of official DNC programming talking about anything to do with perhaps one of the biggest parts of her biography.

If Obama had governed and fulfilled half the campaign promises and all the uplifting prose about bringing American together and a transparent administration that would work together for America., he would have been a great Pres.. Instead he did what every Dem pres and liberal politician always does, divided the nation, demagogued the issues for political gain, treated the opposition party as if they did not exist and instead ruled by arrogant  proclamation and exec orders. Never willing to compromise, and instead ran a divisive and opaque administration and choose bullying, lies and deceit to pass his policies..

Trump is scared shitless if he becomes President. I said I knew all along that he really never wanted to be President. A bit later Trump was briefly on the line saying in a very tired soft voice "Mr. Ahlm thank, thank you so much!" Just to calm him down I explaned that he should vote for Hillary on Tuesday cause people from the future have of course already analyzied the outcome. Once again he uttered "Thank you, oh thank you Mr. Ahlm. Hillary won and became the 45th President of the United States of America and America slowly but surely regained her greatness. God bless.

If you were a true journalist you would be appalled at what is going on in this country this very minute by campaigning and lying for a candidate he knows is even more corrupt than he is. He has corrupted the media (this includes you by the way) by feeding you lies and getting reporters fired for telling the truth until now you are all afraid of him and what he can do to your career and you all try to stuff your own lies about him down our throats and try to make us believe the crap you print and spew on your little programs and on your dirty rags and you think that it is called journalism? It is called being brain dead and brain washed, if you want to know what I think. He and Hillary together have corrupted the whole justice department but thanks to GOD they have not been able to corrupt the Police Departments. We still do have police officers who have integrity. We do have still a few journalists and reporters with integrity, no thanks to people like you who think that the sun rises and sets on Obama. Would like to know what you really and truly think about him in your heart. My rant is over.

Khan waves as he stands near the podium before speaking during the final day of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia , Thursday, July 28, 2016. (AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill) AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill by Matthew Boyle1 Aug 2016Washington, DC6,542Khizr Khan, the Muslim Gold Star father that the mainstream media and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have been using to criticize Donald J. Trump, has deep ties to the government of Saudi Arabia—and to international Islamist investors through his own law firm. In addition to those ties to the wealthy Islamist nation, Khan also has ties to controversial immigration programs that wealthy foreigners can use to essentially buy their way into the United States—and has deep ties to the “Clinton Cash” narrative through the Clinton Foundation. Khan and his wife Ghazala Khan both appeared on stage at the Democratic National Convention to attack, on Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s behalf, Donald Trump—the Republican nominee for president. Their son, U.S. Army Captain Humayun Khan, was killed in Iraq in 2004. Khizr Khan, in his speech to the DNC, lambasted Donald Trump for wanting to temporarily halt Islamic migration to America from countries with a proven history of exporting terrorists.Since then, Clinton operative George Stephanopoulos—who served as a senior adviser to the president in Bill Clinton’s White House and is a Clinton Foundation donor as well as a host on the ABC network—pushed Trump on the matter in an interview. Trump’s comments in that interview have sparked the same mini-rebellion inside his party, in the media and across the aisle that has happened many times before. The usual suspects inside the GOP, from former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush to Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) to House Speaker Paul Ryan to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to Ohio Gov. John Kasich, have condemned Trump in one way or another. The media condemnation has been swift and Democrats, as well their friends throughout media, are driving the train as fast as they can.But until now, it looked like the Khans were just Gold Star parents who the big bad Donald Trump attacked. It turns out, however, in addition to being Gold Star parents, the Khans are financially and legally tied deeply to the industry of Muslim migration–and to the government of Saudi Arabia and to the Clintons themselves.Khan, according to Intelius as also reported by Walid Shoebat, used to work at the law firm Hogan Lovells, LLP, a major D.C. law firm that has been on retainer as the law firm representing the government of Saudi Arabia in the United States for years. Citing federal government disclosure forms, the Washington Free Beacon reported the connection between Saudi Arabia and Hogan Lovells a couple weeks ago.“Hogan Lovells LLP, another U.S. firm hired by the Saudis, is registered to work for the Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia through 2016, disclosures show,” Joe Schoffstall of the Free Beacon reported.The federal form filed with the Department of Justice is a requirement under the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938, which makes lobbyists and lawyers working on behalf of foreign governments and other agents from abroad with interests in the United States register with the federal government.The government of Saudi Arabia, of course, has donated heavily to the Clinton Foundation.“The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has given between $10 and $25 million to the foundation while Friends of Saudi Arabia has contributed between $1 and $5 million,” Schoffstall wrote.Trump, of course, has called on Hillary Clinton to have the Clinton Foundation return the money.“Saudi Arabia and many of the countries that gave vast amounts of money to the Clinton Foundation want women as slaves and to kill gays,” Trump wrote in a Facebook post back in June, according to Politico. “Hillary must return all money from such countries!”“Crooked Hillary says we must call on Saudi Arabia and other countries to stop funding hate,” Trump posted in a separate Facebook posting at the time. “I am calling on her to immediately return the $25 million plus she got from them for the Clinton Foundation!”Of course, to this day, Hillary Clinton and her Clinton Foundation has kept the money from the Saudi Aarabian government.Schoffstall’s piece in the Washington Free Beacon also notes how Hogan Lovells lobbyist Robert Kyle, per Federal Election Commission (FEC) records, has bundled more than $50,000 in donations for Clinton’s campaign this year.Khan’s connections with the Hogan Lovells firm run deep, according to a report from Law.com written by Katelyn Polantz.“Many lawyers at Hogan Lovells remember the week in 2004 when U.S. Army Capt. Humayun Khan lost his life to a suicide bomber,” Polantz wrote. “Then-Hogan & Hartson attorneys mourned the death because the soldier’s father, Khizr Khan, a Muslim American immigrant, was among their beloved colleagues.”Polantz wrote that Khan worked at the mega-D.C. law firm for years.

She broke the law and belongs in jail. She risked our country and put our people in harm's way, and had Democratic whistleblowers murdered. Not only Billery is very dangerous, she will bring this country to a security collapse with cutting our military and a financial collapse by choosing a fight with Russia and ruining small businesses while sending all jobs overseas. Please don't vote for the DEVIL. This country needs to be free and strong, where people have a real chance at the American Dream. Billery should have never been the Democratic candidate to start with and stole the nomination from Bernie Sanders. She is the most corrupt candidate ever and works for the elite new world order who wants to make people obsolete with new robotic technology. She brings with her sinister powers and so do not be fooled by her fake smiles and phony consideration for the working man, or woman. Vote Donald Trump and save our nation. CNN until now has been reporting lies and gossip that was never admissible in court about Donald Trump. But tonight CNN, the yellow tabloid, must for a change act like a real news network and report the truth. Pray to God and pray hard that Donald Trump is our next President. We need to stop criminal refugees from coming here and take care first of our American veterans. We need to work on better trade deals so manufacturing will be back in America. We need to stop paying for parasites! The election is at stake with Billery's dirty tricks and it must be watched closely. Donald Trump is our only hope before Killery turns this country to a worse version of 1984 by George Orwell. I hope the next thing Trump do as our new much admired President is expose all the dirt, every affair and sexual indecency of every CNN reporter, including Anderson, Gloria, and that self righteous long brown haired woman. Then, HC must be locked up for the rest of her life. If you don't want more zombies on the streets, if you don't want to give up cash, and guns and freedom of speech, VOTE for TRUMP!!! We can't afford the status quo! We're losing our country!!! Dare, you pathetic paid patsies online of HC to call me names and I will take screen shots and sue you for libel!!!

We must never take our freedom for granted. On November 8 stand the lines as long as they are because our liberty and justice for all are at stake. Let us pray Billery/Killery will be arrested soon, AMEN. Please share and God Bless. P.S. For crying outloud, stop briefing the enemy Billery if you want to keep the U.S. safe!Hellery/Liary needs to have her clearance removed. Clean the swamp America! Huma is most likely a spy and Loretta Lynch, Justice Department director is as vicious as Killery, pleading the Fifth when Congress asked her about why so many millions of dollars "disappeared" and ended in Iran! We MUST put a stop to the traitors and tried them all for TREASON. PPS Huma=married to a pedophile. Killery=married to a rapist. That's how they respect women, ha???!!! JOKE! We ALL know LIARY is a pathological liar and an urgent danger to the sovereignty of the U.S. Please be careful about CNN too-they are ANTI AMERICAN. Who knows what more harm Killery did to our beloved country. Pray for our country and Trump. Ask yourself who is helping Hillery with the cover up and why...We want our country back!How many more premium hikes in Obamacare no one can afford??? How many more violent crimes in the streets??? This is Hillary's America. Hillary=a most dangerous TYRANT.Breaking!!! LIARY's Clinton security clearance is revoked AND Huma is under house arrest for suspicion of espionage. Be aware people, Hillary is an enemy of the state!At any rate, Killery will be impeached as planned by Congress. She is guilty of EVERY despicable trick to deny deny deny. Be careful of this evil woman who will bring poverty to America. Be careful of what you hear on main stream media. They are all sponsored by shadow government.Obama sure has a lot to lie for Hillary because he is tied on all her scams and frauds. Worse off, he bankrupt the American people by forcing an unaffordable healthcare rip off system that makes us hard working people pay for all the illegals and criminals in this country. Citizens of Wisconsin, Minnesota, Pennsylvania and Michigan: PLEASE do not let the country fall under the TOTALITARIAN regime of SCARY CORRUPT MURDEROUS KILLERY.Please, I am beseeching of you, my fellow citizens.

Hope Trump finds out you are not a saint. Hope there will be new laws concerning REAL NEWS REPORTING and not reporting biased BS and if any harm done by reporting filthy rumors there will be JAIL TIME. Why did you try to silence Rudy Giuliani when he spoke of the criminal charges against Billary? You think America wants a criminal in the White House? And to the traitors who want to buy a flight ticket out of here if Trump is elected-go right ahead, leave already do us all a huge favor and don't let the door get in your way! Please, the country needs real patriots! ALERT: CNN AKA CLINTON/CORRUPTION NEWS NETWORK ARE IN COLLUSION WITH BILLERY.

I don't know who her handler is, but RNC, and her own husband, are making a mockery of this woman and taking advantage of her weakness (she must be weak to go along with all this). She appears to be ridiculous.

As they sink further they will realize that Trump is at the top to take advantage of the "new" Republican plans to turn National Parks into oil and gas reserves. The deplorables will watch as Trump steers the Grand Canyon into the Koch Bros uranium mine. Trump has already invested in the DAPL Indian pipeline. Someday all the deplorables with guns Trump hoped would chase Hillary will now go after him. USA will be deplorables vs Trump family. Democrats will sit back and watch and laugh at Trump. Boy are those deplorables pissed when they realize Trump WAS like Hitler as people said and now their country was a ruin. Also, Trump WAS like Cheney who was at the top just to make himself rich. In the end...Eric and Donald Jr have all the fun taken out of Africa safaris as they find deplorables chasing them around Africa. Ivanka is not able to sell 1 single dress ever again because of those blasted pissed off deplorable s. She is so sad her Dad did this to his life.

2 | Larry Laibson | 0 | 10154801955524729_10154802060314729 | Peter Schweizer's "Clinton Cash", Tom Fitton's "Clean House", Dinesh D'Souza's "Hillary's America", and Gary Bryne's "Crisis of Character" are all informative and factual, backed up by numerous references. For those who can read and want to take the time to learn and vote intelligently, these are just some of the many sources out there. I am sure nay sayers also refute the information and evidence on all the thousands of released Wikileaks emails and will refute any findings of the FBI's two investigations.
3 | Annabelle Collins | 0 | 10154801955524729_10154802351644729 | Read the recent book The Making of Donald Trump for details on his ties to the mob and other information on his business practice and not some video that could have been put up by ISIS, Russia or anyone else that wants the USA to have a bad leader so they go to war. What is it with some in the States that they do not think that they are not capable of being lied to by enemies of the USA or the free world. The rest of us are terrified of a Trump leadership because we are being not being targeted by lies and have done the research and can see he is not qualifed at all even to run a business. Ask for his tax returns if he is so clever as proof that he is not once again broke.

Not all of them are racist, they just want their local economies to be stimulated a bit more. They feel abandoned. We need to help them.

14 | Moji Hoss | 0 | 10154801993219729_10154803366534729 | People who are collecting Government handouts…Trump supporters, the Rednecks of America, or as Hillary call them the “basket of deplorables” are usually consumed with the so called people who are " just looking for government handouts that future generations will have to pay for.":Donald J. Trump proudly acknowledges he did not pay a dime in federal income taxes for years on end. He insists he merely exploited tax loopholes legally available to any billionaire:“Donald J. Trump avoided reporting hundreds of millions in taxable income with a tactic so legally dubious that his lawyers said an I.R.S. audit would most likely find it improper.” And “Tax experts who reviewed documents for The Times said Mr. Trump trampled a core tax policy tenet by receiving tax benefits for losing vast amounts of other people’s money.”Do you know the Government handouts that Trump has so far collected from GOVERNMENT, all by himself, by his own admission, is so much bigger than the handouts that millions of supposed single moms of America has collected as “Gov. Handouts”? No wonder, they call you “Rednecks” & “deplorables”.Corporate America is collecting more Government Handouts than all people on welfare list (X 10).

20 | Sesame Lee | 2 | 10154801993219729_10154802270449729 | You know the first that won't accept is trump himself! He will continue to taunt Hillary and his supporters will continue to taunt and intimidate minorities. Already in Texas, a high position Commissioner stood at the door of a polling area, intimidating and told early voters (minorities) "shut up and go home!" Already they are not afraid to display their corruption! Can you imagine the downhill of America? If you don't support them, you have no place in America. That is their message, as Trump said, "is he a protester? Get him out of here!"

He tried and tried, begged and cried but Monica turned down his aggressive advances time and time again.Trump the Snorter - you can't impress the ladies, you deplorable wanker. You ain't no real man. Real men appreciate and respect women and you don't. I tell you this straight to your face - Ya' ain't gonna make to the White House!

We built these White Houses from plastic ... and electoral votes. To illustrate the 2016 presidential election results in real time, The Post is using a pair of Makerbot 3D Replicator+ machines to print two identical models of The White House in red and blue. Each model represents the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House. As states are called by the Associated Press for Hillary Clinton (blue) and Donald J. Trump (red), the printers will print just that much of the White House.

By the end of the night, one White House will be complete and 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. will have a new occupant.

When you live in a country that has over 400 Billionaires, but still havehomeless people, even children, in the streets living in tents and cardboard boxes, it is not so great.Why does the top 1% of the people in the country have more wealththan the bottom 70%?Why is it, the owner of Wal-Mart has made Billions of dollars, butthe workers who do the work, have wages so low that they needto be on food stamps?Why do we have a government that caters to and is bought and ownedby the rich and big corporation, instead of a government of thepeople, for the people, and by the people?Change, when you feel America is great, you do not believe in change.As they say, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.I don't know about you and Hillary, but I think it's broke and itis time for someone to fix it.America, I have only one question, come November, are you ready to fix it.

Milking tension for clicks/profits along with specialized political interests toward known but unstated outcomes by corporate social engineering is an advertising hat trick Americans are conditioned to follow.  I look forward to voting for #HRC despite her being imperfect. She supports and has experience in working toward national interests and well being. Criticism is understandable, hate and death threats by seething herds of frightened people is intolerable and fueled by Trump's horrific campaign.
2 | Hector Melendez | 2 | 10154800915924729_10154801097594729 | A Final Awful ChoiceCharles KrauthammerThe Washington PostNovember 4, 2016"At a time of such tectonic instability, even the most experienced head of state requires wisdom and delicacy to maintain equilibrium. Trump has neither. His joining of supreme arrogance, combined with a pathological sensitivity to any perceived slight, is a standing invitation to calamitous miscalculation."Two generations of Americans have grown up feeling that international stability is as natural as the air we breathe. It is not.""It took seven decades to build this open, free international order. It could be brought down in a single presidential term. That would be a high price to pay for the catharsis of kicking over a table."

Trump proudly acknowledges he did not pay a dime in federal income taxes for years on end. He insists he merely exploited tax loopholes legally available to any billionaire:“Donald J. Trump avoided reporting hundreds of millions in taxable income with a tactic so legally dubious that his lawyers said an I.R.S. audit would most likely find it improper.” And “Tax experts who reviewed documents for The Times said Mr. Trump trampled a core tax policy tenet by receiving tax benefits for losing vast amounts of other people’s money.”Do you know the Government handouts that Trump has so far collected from GOVERNMENT, all by himself, by his own admission, is so much bigger than the handouts that millions of supposed single moms of America has collected as “Gov. Handouts”? No wonder, they call you “Rednecks” & “deplorables”.Corporate America is collecting more Government Handouts than all people on welfare list (X 10).

19 | Patti Pryor | 1 | 10154800915924729_10154801120219729 | According to NYPD sources,Hillary Clinton traveled as Epstein’s guest on Sex Slave Island lat least six occasions detectives have discovered evidence of a ‘child sex ring’ on Anthony Weiner’s laptop, and as they said this could put her in prison! From Your News Wire: According to reports,a folder on Weiner’s laptop named “life insurance”contains explicit evidence that both Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin helped run and cover-up a Washington pedophile sex ring.Truepundit.com reports:NYPD sources said these new emails include evidence linking Clinton herself and associates to:Money laundering.Child exploitation,Sex crimes with minors (children),Perjury,Pay to play through Clinton Foundation, Obstruction of justice,Other felony crimes, NYPD detectives and a NYPD Chief, the department’s highest rank under Commissioner, said openly that if the FBI and Justice Department fail to garner timely indictments against Clinton and co- conspirators, NYPD will go public with the damaging emails now in the hands of FBI Director James Comey and many FBI field offices.“What’s in the emails is staggering and as a father, it turned my stomach,” the NYPD Chief said. “There is not going to be any Houdini-like escape from what we found. We have copies of everything. We will ship them to Wikileaks or I will personally hold my own press conference if it comes to that.”The NYPD Chief said once Comey saw the alarming contents of the emails he was forced to reopen a criminal probe against Clinton.“People are going to prison,” he said.Meanwhile, FBI sources said Abedin and Weiner were cooperating with federal agents, who have taken over the non-sexting portions the case from NYPD. The husband-and-wife Clinton insiders are both shopping for separate immunity deals, sources said.“If they don’t cooperate they are going to see long sentences,” a federal law enforcement source said.NYPD sources said Weiner or Abedin stored all the emails in a massive Microsoft Outlook program on the laptop. The emails implicate other current and former members of Congress and one high-ranking Democratic Senator as having possibly engaged in criminal activity too, sources said.Prosecutors in the office of US Attorney Preet Bharara have issued a subpoena for Weiner’s cell phones and travel records, law enforcement sources confirmed. NYPD said it planned to order the same phone and travel records on Clinton and Abedin, however, the FBI said it was in the process of requesting the identical records. Law enforcement sources are particularly interested in cell phone activity and travel to the Bahamas, U.S. Virgin Islands and other locations that sources would not divulge.The new emails contain travel documents and itineraries indicating Hillary Clinton, President Bill Clinton, Weiner and multiple members of Congress and other government officials accompanied convicted pedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein on his Boeing 727 on multiple occasions to his private island in the U.S Virgin Islands, sources said. Epstein’s island has also been dubbed Orgy Island or Sex Slave Island where Epstein allegedly pimps out underage girls and boys to international dignitaries.Both NYPD and FBI sources confirm based on the new emails they now believe Hillary Clinton traveled as Epstein’s guest on at least six occasions, probably more when all the evidence is combed, sources said. Bill Clinton, it has been confirmed in media reports spanning recent years, that he too traveled with Epstein over 20 times to the island.This is a big tragedy for those childrens, and more than one person should be in jail!Via Your News WireTrue PunditBringing Integrity Back to Journalismtruepundit.com

She has placed our country on very thin ice with our responsible allies. The Washington Post needs to get back to investigative journalism. HRC makes Richard Mill house Nixon look like a brilliant saint.
2 | Annabelle Collins | 2 | 10154798804854729_10154799447029729 | Ask Trump why he employs Mob lawyers and makes payments in the ten of thousands to mob companies.Ask Trump about his mates such as the Weichselbaum brothers,Joey Two Socks, John Cody who are known mob members. Its all in the book The Making of Donald Trump and Trump has not sued so it is true clearly.

The Republican Party is committed to a better future for all communities, and all of our Republican candidates are going to lead our nation in a new direction and provide meaningful change for the African American community.Vote Republican:
4 | Moji Hoss | 0 | 10154798804854729_10154803559719729 | Americans are politically …  FoxNews viewers, who thinks they are in the 1% category, and try to parrot like them and carry the water for the 1% agenda, (See “History of the world part 1”) but unfortunately they live in their small homes working 6 days a week, pay check to pay check, and suffer just like the rest of the 99%, and just imagining that they are part of the 1%. Shame on lazy American people who are so politically 'Dumb' and 'Numb', and they do not know who is running their country. These politically 'Dumb' and 'Numb' people continue to go to vote for the same GOP and Democratic candidates who have been CHOSEN and FINANCED by the 1% elite. These politically 'Dumb' and 'Numb' people continue to Watch FoxNews and do not realize what was it like 8 years ago, when the GOP & W. Bush was running the WH and the Congress and had implemented their Tax Cut for the Rich, and were running the “Trickle Down Economy” and the result was: “The signs of unfolding economic catastrophe were visible in other places. By Oct. 31, 2008, the Standard & Poor’s 500 index had plunged almost 17 percent that month, its worst-ever monthly point decline. That same day, it was reported that at least 7.5 million Americans were underwater on their mortgages. When the October jobs report came out in early November (after the country had voted), it was 6.5 percent. Within a year, it would peak at 10 percent. The headlines were chilling.”Little do they know that there is not Liberal and/or Conservative Media, there is only one 'Controlled' Corporate Media, from different angle, who is running the 1% elite’s agenda, and would not let the 99% to know or to understand who is really running this Country.

12 | Carla Brookman | 2 | 10154798804854729_10154799540009729 | The Huffington Post: Why I Can No Longer Support Hillary Clinton❗️It took me a long time to write this. I had to dig deep into my being to come up with these words. I’m recanting my endorsement of Hillary Clinton for the presidency.I’m aware of how vindictive Clintonians can be. I’m not speaking about the Clintons themselves, but of those surrounding them. Perhaps the saying is true: dime con quién andas y te diré quién eres. Your staff, your donors, your surrogates, and those you surround yourself with are a reflection of who you truly are, no? If not, why not curb any unacceptable behavior? Silence, indifference, or inaction is as incriminatory-at least to me.There has been no repudiation, let alone denunciation, of what was said in those emails-just denial, finger pointing, and doublespeak. To appoint the very same folks who carried out many malicious behaviors to tip the scales for Hillary is just as unpardonable. Why reward unethical behavior? It’s mind-boggling.I rebuke with my heart, mind, and soul all the twisted narratives of sexism, misogyny, racism, and classism lay at our feet. Though some of them are legitimate, most were used to derail valid grievances from our communitiesand completely erase us. Our voices were drowned out by empty accusations, by a nefarious usage of identity politics recommended by one of our own, no less. That is a bamboozling of POC and unsuspecting allies. This is why Hillary Clinton doesn’t deserve our vote, among many other reasons.Many of us have been groundlessly accused of being politically illiterate, of having a conscience, and of being idealistic for expecting fairness. As if caring about our fellow human beings and we was such a bad thing. Without our love for others, without empathy, we are nothing but empty vessels, carcasses without souls, worthy of none of the things we cherish the most. Fairness is ingrained in our brains. If you don’t really care much for it then you might just be a psychopath or a made sociopath. There’s no going around that. Are you one? I hope not.
13 | Frances Scott | 2 | 10154798804854729_10154799233804729 | Anthony Weiner’s laptop contained details of several trips made by Weiner, Bill and Hillary Clinton on convicted pedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein’s plane to a location referred to “Sex Slave Island.”Hackers are also well aware of the Weiner/Epstein/Clinton connection, as well. On an archived thread on 4chan, an FBI insider alleged that the Clinton email server investigation was just a distraction from the much bigger story concerning the Clinton Foundation and its connection to pedophilia. Many are unaware of this investigation. The time stamps on the chat forum are from July of this year, so it is very possible that the FBI has been investigating this for several months or maybe even several years. It is uncertain if the FBI will go public with this investigation until they have more concrete proof, but it is something the public should be very aware of. It is very possible that the Clintons have been protecting Jeffrey Epstein while keeping Bill’s dirty secrets hidden. This is the exact type of behavior we have seen and would expect from the Clintons. The election is one week away. We are almost to the finish line and have the power to end the Clinton cartel for good on election day. We take them down by sharing everything we can that exposes the truth. We must take our Nation back on November 8th!
14 | Rita Diane Palmer | 2 | 10154798804854729_10154799055119729 | If Donald Trump is convicted of a crime in his criminal cases, he could be impeached. Donald Trump is fond of exaggerating his accomplishments and merits but his multiple failures prove otherwise. This lawsuit may again highlight his incompetence.The caveat here is that even if Trump is found guilty of fraud, he may only need to comply with the civil claims. He cannot be directly held accountable for a criminal offense without first being impeached. The court cannot issue a subpoena or warrant of arrest against Trump if he is elected as president. Trump has two cases coming up. One November 28 for the fake university and the other one is in December for the rape case.

16 | Malcolm Mandel | 0 | 10154798804854729_10154800218744729 | Here’s why Hillary is the bestchoice for America © 2016Samuel Ktheblacksilentmajority  SMImagine this. Every living, ex-U.S. president, Republican and Democrat, has endorsed Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump.A lot of discussion has been devoted to why Donald Trump would be bad for America, and he certainly would be bad for this country. His brand of politics has brought division, hatred and bigotry. America can be better than that.But let’s focus on why Ms. Clinton would be better for America than Trump.Clinton has a history of involvement in progressive issues: women’s rights, civil rights, voting rights, and children’s rights.Moreover, this is not a run-of-the-mill election.This is a time of deep political, social, economic, and racial divisions the likes we haven’t seen in decades. Many of those divisions began nearly eight years ago by the Republicans against Pres. Obama not to mention the economic mess they left the country in after Bush left office.Clinton has run a campaign that promises a brighter future for Americans compared to the doom and gloom promoted by Trump and the Republicans. She is appealing to the best in Americans and is refusing to use race, religion, or demogogue propaganda to divide this country.CLINTON: “From the start, Donald Trump has built his campaign on prejudice and paranoia. He is taking hate groups mainstream and helping a radical fringe take over the Republican party. His disregard for the values that make our country great is profoundly dangerous.Ms. Clinton once heard Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. speak in 1962. That speech lit a sparked in her. It triggered an awareness and led her to adopt a more progressive outlook on civil rights, social justice and children’s rights.This is a woman who has consistently shattered glass ceilings.•	She was the first woman named to a full partnership in the Rose Law firm.•	She was the first female board member at WalMart.•	She was the first First Lady to run for office; and she won.•	She has been a U.S. Senator and U.S. Secretary of State.•	If she’s successful in November, she will be the first female president of the United States.Clinton’s life has been devoted to helping others and making their lives better. By contrast, Trump has devoted his life to just helping Donald Trump.Clinton would appoint fairer, more progressive judges to the U.S. Supreme Court, and other federal courts. She is in favor of supporting more apprenticeships that could provide Americans with necessary job skills to access jobs that go unfilled because applicants didn’t have the skills.Hillary Clinton is endorsed by every living ex-president of the United States. She also is endorsed by outstanding Noble Prize winners. She is endorsed by a growing number of Republicans as well, and that should tell you something.They all know the Clinton email controversy has been blown completely out of proportion for political gain.Hillary Clinton looks like Mother Teresa compared to Trump’s long list of abominations, which includes his slimy, gutter disrespect for women and treating them like sex toys. This man has been documented as a liar. He dodged paying federal taxes and bragged that not doing so made him smart. He claims to be a great businessman, but nearly all of his businesses have gone bankrupt. He is claiming to support the “little guy.” But there’s no history of him supporting anyone during his 70 years other than himself. If nothing else, Trump is a scam artist.
17 | Annabelle Collins | 0 | 10154798804854729_10154799657894729 | Ask Trump why he puts goats on his golf course to avoid taxes ie claims the course as a "farm". That means everyone picks up the bill. He does this time and time again and this is why he will not release his tax returns.
18 | Frances Scott | 0 | 10154798804854729_10154800876279729 | Senator Cotton had this to say:The more we learn about the Clinton Foundation’s operations, whether it’s from the book Clinton Cash, or Bret Baier’s reporting or The Wall Street Journal‘s reporting, the more it becomes clearer that the Clinton Foundation may be the world’s largest money laundering and influence-peddling operation. In fact, with two investigations swirling around Hillary Clinton both the email investigation and the Clinton Foundation investigation, I think it may become clear that those are really the same controversy. One reason why Hillary Clinton probably went and set up a private email server was so she could advance her pay-for-play agenda at the State Department with Clinton Foundation donors giving perks and benefits to dictators and shady oligarchs all around the world.

America has a two party system and believe me - Trump is not an option - if you want what is best for America! Do not forget you're all immigrants - illegal or not. Ask the indigenous people of America. They came first! Trump is a third generation immigrant. You really think a semi-wealthy criminal connected to the mob, who commutes between New York and Palm Beach in his deplorable private yet (he couldn't afford a mid-range Gultstream) cares about poor folks without a job? He is totally indifferent!  He is a lousy business man, a pathological liar, a tax criminal, a rapist and a traitor. He is a pittyful headless, angry chicken, who can be taken out quite easily. He will do anything Putin tells him to do. What a president. He has nothing to offer other than hatred!Remember a scene where he during one of his rallies waved his arms in despair because a mosquito came close. Now, you think that was a mosquito. Well, not nescessarily. Drones can be extremely small (so small they can go unnoticed through your skin and move inside your veines). Big drones can carry  weapons - what do you think small ones can carry? Both big- and small drones can be controlled from afar.Men in black are back and they do not like traitors and serial criminals to be in charge of anything! So think twice. God expect you to use whatever you have left between your ears! Trump is nothing but a puppet on a string! When the powers that be decide time is up - then that's it! Hillary - despite her luggage - is an infinitely far better qualified person as president than Trump. She will defend the interests of America in a very competent way. God bless.
22 | George Adams | 0 | 10154798804854729_10154799594124729 | STOP Election Fraud: Do NOT use Soros voting machines. Please vote to put Billery/Killery on trial for TREASON. She broke the law and belongs in jail. She risked our country and put our people in harm's way, and had Democratic whistleblowers murdered. Not only Billery is very dangerous, she will bring this country to a security collapse with cutting our military and a financial collapse by choosing a fight with Russia and ruining small businesses while sending all jobs overseas. Please don't vote for the DEVIL. This country needs to be free and strong, where people have a real chance at the American Dream. Billery should have never been the Democratic candidate to start with and stole the nomination from Bernie Sanders. She is the most corrupt candidate ever and works for the elite new world order who wants to make people obsolete with new robotic technology. She brings with her sinister powers and so do not be fooled by her fake smiles and phony consideration for the working man, or woman. Vote Donald Trump and save our nation. CNN until now has been reporting lies and gossip that was never admissible in court about Donald Trump. But tonight CNN, the yellow tabloid, must for a change act like a real news network and report the truth. Pray to God and pray hard that Donald Trump is our next President. We need to stop criminal refugees from coming here and take care first of our American veterans. We need to work on better trade deals so manufacturing will be back in America. We need to stop paying for parasites! The election is at stake with Billery's dirty tricks and it must be watched closely. Donald Trump is our only hope before Killery turns this country to a worse version of 1984 by George Orwell. I hope the next thing Trump do as our new much admired President is expose all the dirt, every affair and sexual indecency of every CNN reporter, including Anderson, Gloria, and that self righteous long brown haired woman. Then, HC must be locked up for the rest of her life. If you don't want more zombies on the streets, if you don't want to give up cash, and guns and freedom of speech, VOTE for TRUMP!!! We can't afford the status quo! We're losing our country!!! Dare, you pathetic paid patsies online of HC to call me names and I will take screen shots and sue you for libel!!! This nation is SICK of the Clinton cover ups. Stop totalitarianism! CNN=Clinton News Network. Hope Trump fires many of you when he is elected! Let us pray November 8 brings the change that we so desperately need. Long Live Trump, our savior!I am:1) A married WOMAN2) Have no kids3) Intelligent and educated4) Independent politically5) Trump Supporter, Truth Supporter, Freedom Supporter and a Proud American 6) Not a racist, respectful of ALL religions and races 7) Very worried about how globalism will annihilate our country as we know itWe all know main stream media and the system are rigged. We must never take our freedom for granted. On November 8 stand the lines as long as they are because our liberty and justice for all are at stake. Let us pray Billery/Killery will be arrested soon, AMEN. Please share and God Bless. P.S. For crying outloud, stop briefing the enemy Billery if you want to keep the U.S. safe!Hellery/Liary needs to have her clearance removed. Clean the swamp America! Huma is most likely a spy and Loretta Lynch, Justice Department director is as vicious as Killery, pleading the Fifth when Congress asked her about why so many millions of dollars "disappeared" and ended in Iran! We MUST put a stop to the traitors and tried them all for TREASON. PPS Huma=married to a pedophile. Killery=married to a rapist. That's how they respect women, ha???!!! JOKE! We ALL know LIARY is a pathological liar and an urgent danger to the sovereignty of the U.S. Please be careful about CNN too-they are ANTI AMERICAN. Who knows what more harm Killery did to our beloved country. Pray for our country and Trump. Ask yourself who is helping Hillery with the cover up and why...We want our country back!How many more premium hikes in Obamacare no one can afford??? How many more violent crimes in the streets??? This is Hillary's America. Hillary=a most dangerous TYRANT.Breaking!!! LIARY's Clinton security clearance is revoked AND Huma is under house arrest for suspicion of espionage. Be aware people, Hillary is an enemy of the state!At any rate, Killery will be impeached as planned by Congress. She is guilty of EVERY despicable trick to deny deny deny. Be careful of this evil woman who will bring poverty to America. Be careful of what you hear on main stream media. They are all sponsored by shadow government.Obama sure has a lot to lie for Hillary because he is tied on all her scams and frauds. Worse off, he bankrupt the American people by forcing an unaffordable healthcare rip off system that makes us hard working people pay for all the illegals and criminals in this country. Citizens of Wisconsin, Minnesota, Pennsylvania and Michigan: PLEASE do not let the country fall under the TOTALITARIAN regime of SCARY CORRUPT MURDEROUS KILLERY.Please, I am beseeching of you, my fellow citizens. It's our only and last chance to clean the swamp and get rid of the filthy politics as usual. It does not matter if you are Republican or Democrat or Independent, you must vote for Trump to STOP the global oligarchy that chose Billery and Kain as puppets. I am not paid by anyone! I love my country so much and I am so afraid of losing it to sinister powers. We have already lost so much by the dirty tricks of the establishment. America belongs to its people, not the weathly elite that wants to enslave us all. Please, we have one last chance to get it right, before scenarios that are taken from Orwell's 1984 will become reality her. God Bless the USA and Donald Trump. ONLY PAPER BALLOT.Do not let Wall Street and foreign groups take over America, my home sweet home! Vote Trump to ensure a future for the next generations!Vote Trump to ensure America remains FREE and SAFE. Fight for Our Constitution! Watch the Hillary's America movie and find out the truth for yourself!Government that controls the main stream media is really a dictatorship! Let's fix the "error" of Obama in the White House! Let's NOT let Killery and him hide the TRUTH from the American People. Let's stop the conspiracies to cancel the Second Amendment, Cash, Gold and private cars. Let's make sure our banks remain all American. Let's breathe fresh air into the economy. HC will anyway have to be impeached and many years of prison await her. Do not let election fraud happen. See something? SAY SOMETHING. Open Eyes people...This is a fight against the DEVIL. If you love America, DO NOT VOTE for KILLERY!!! Billery are buying illegal votes. Fight for America, for real freedom, before we become a dictatorship like North Korea. That's what you will be getting with LIARY!!!

24 | Flavio Gomes | 0 | 10154798804854729_10154800703854729 | Donald Trump said: "America great again". America will not be great anymore (1950). The American population has grown and there is competition (globalization). See China. Other countries are developing thenselves. America will not be great anymore.
25 | Terri Stendardo | 1 | 10154798804854729_10154799394389729 | Hillary is a disaster & disgrace & embarrassment to this country.  Democrats in government  know Hillary is going to be indicted, they just want her to win so democrat is in office.  Survivors of Benghazi called Hillary a weak & poor leader & also that she tried to Lie & NOT take responsibility for Benghazi.    They absolutely will not vote for Hillary.    Hillary 30yrs in politics & Hillary can't determine what a classified or confidential document is  !!!!
