1 | Nicholas Renshaw | 21 | 10154052483505950_10154052493100950 | Remember when libs called trump a racist for wanting to build a wall? Remember how libs forgot hillary said the same thing in 2006 though.....?
2 | Monica Buchholz | 6 | 10154052483505950_10154052520770950 | How can you morally vote for someone that thinks it is ok to kill by dismemberment a full term infant?How can you morally vote for someone that thinks it is ok to force people to receive medical treatment they do not want?How can you morally vote for someone that has repeatedly shared, stored, deleted classified information knowing they were breaking numerous laws and recklessly endangering countless lives?How can you morally vote for someone that single handedly destroyed numerous womens lives because her husband raped them?How can you morally vote for someone who screams about foreign influences affecting the presidential elections, yet has accepted hundreds of millions in campaign donations from foreign governments?How can you morally vote for someone that collected a few BILLION dollars to rebuild Haiti yet only spent a few million of that in Haiti and pocketed the rest.At what point do your morals kickin?????
3 | Cherylyn McCollam-Kerley | 3 | 10154052483505950_10154052541000950 | Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton were walking down the street when they came to a homeless person. Trump gave the homeless person his business card and told him to come to his office for a job. He then took $20 out of his pocket and gave it to the homeless person. Hillary was very impressed, so when they came to another homeless person, she decided to help. She walked over to the homeless person and gave him directions to the welfare office. She then reached into Trump’s pocket and got out $20. She kept $15 for her administrative fees and gave the homeless person $5.00. Now, do you understand the difference between a Conservative and a Liberal progressive?

5 | Rick Brown | 1 | 10154052483505950_10154052544055950 | LOL when The KKK Endorses Trump He is a Racist when the KKK Endorses Hillary The man claiming to be a Ku Klux Klan Grand Dragon made statements of questionable legitimacy and provided no evidence that he was anything but a media hoax. So while it's true that The Telegraph reported (and other outlets disseminated) Quigg's claim that the KKK was now supporting Hillary Clinton and had donated $20,000 to her campaign, that assertion was widely deemed not to be credible by sources familiar with such groups. Moreover, Quigg neither presented proof of his claims nor discussed them seriously.
6 | Brian Oldham | 0 | 10154052483505950_10154052607250950 | Its so sad that we have a biased media that nobody trusts any more. I, as well as millions don't believe anything that's reported anymore. Your bias is so bad its unreal. We no longer have investigating reporters, we just have those that say what they want to hear, or what they're paid to say. You should be ashamed.
7 | Russell Parker | 15 | 10154052483505950_10154052489450950 | Remember in the debates when Hillary accused Trump of using some of his foundation money to buy a portrait at a charity auction? She was APPALLED! Well... it turns out the Clinton Foundation paid for Chelsea's wedding. Maybe that fact slipped the lying hypocrite's mind.
8 | Rosemary Niswonger-Muse | 4 | 10154052483505950_10154052512945950 | Thank you, Mr Trump for starting this journey for Us! I know you had better things to do, than endure the liars and backstabbers for Us!  I know you had better things to spend your money on, instead of fighting for Us!  I know you're giving up your time with your own family to care about Us! Thank you for sending help, though you didn't have to, to those of Us who are displaced due to Natural Disasters! Thank you for shaking our hands. Thank you for hugging our children. Thank you for Caring about the future of our Grandchildren! Thank you for Loving our Country! Thank you for taking a Stand against Corrupt Government! Mr Trump has the Endorsement of Christian Leaders such as, Dr James Dobson, Jerry Falwell Jr, and Franklin Graham! Mr Trump, We The People Are Behind You! With much gratitude, An American Citizen!
9 | Rosemary Niswonger-Muse | 3 | 10154052483505950_10154052512235950 | Great question ......(copied)...If you are Gay, why are you voting for Hillary when she wants to bring in 1,000's of refugees that believe all Gays should be executed.If you are Black, why are you voting for Hillary when she admires Margaret Sanger and defends Planned Parenthood when they want o abort as many black babies as possible. Exterminate the black race because they are like "weeds". Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.If you are a Christian, why are you voting for Hillary Clinton when she wrote her Senior thesis on Saul Alinsky who dedicated his book Rules for Radicals to Lucifer, The Devil. She says he was and still is her mentor.If you are a Veteran, in the military, or closely related to a military member, why are you voting for Hillary when she left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again. They called for help but the help was told to stand down.If you have factory job, why are you voting for Hillary when she supported TPP and factory works are being laid off because jobs are going over sees. Don't forget the deals she made with china. She also welcomes open borders and illegals to get benefits with your tax money.If you are poor, why are you voting for Hillary, when she is supporting Wall street and all the big banks. Big banks keep the poor, poor by destroying the poor man's credit by allowing medical bills and collections to affect your credit scores so you can pay higher interest rates than the rich. Taking as much of the little money you earn.If you are a woman, how can you vote for Hillary when she has buried all of Bills rape victims under the rug including the little girl that was raped when she defended the rapist and laughed about it later.If you carry a gun, believe in the Constitution, how can you vote for Hillary when she wants to eliminate the NRA, Take your guns, and abolish the second amendment.If you breathe, why would you vote for Hillary when she has left a trail of dead people that did not agree with her or knew too much!Who is left?
10 | Shel Marie | 0 | 10154052483505950_10154052604305950 | #StopFukishima #CleantheOcean #JillStein for PresidentThe ocean's acidification levels are rising exponentially. The WWF just released their report for 2016 that scientists predict if we continue on the path of developing fossil fuels - sea life and wildlife will decline rapidly by the year 2020. Coastal communities will no longer be able to sustain themselves or depend on sea life for food. The Kuskokwim river in Alaska was suspended from commercial fishing this summer because no one is buying fish. Reports of sea life having boils and other deformities are affecting those who depend on it for subsistence. Schools need to recruit students and focus their efforts on stopping Fukishima from spilling more radiation in the ocean. It's evident Japan will not or cannot contain it alone. As long as radiation levels increase in the oceans, it will be pulled up in the clouds - rain on our mountains that lead to our rivers and streams; rain on our livestock and crops making food from the inland unsuitable to eat; and it will devastate the global landscape by killing trees we need for oxygen.Mankind cannot ignore the effects of Fukishima any longer. This will become of major national interest before most people know or are prepared.
11 | Gary Doan | 3 | 10154052483505950_10154052522175950 | We now live in a country where a Trump sticker, can get your car burned. A Trump hat, can get you physically attacked. Campaign headquarters are being firebombed. Innocent men and women are being attacked by goons, paid to incite violence. The dishonest media is guilty. Journalistic integrity is nonexistent and propaganda is the norm. You can’t have government corruption, without media corruption. We have both.
12 | Tom Dallas Johnson | 3 | 10154052483505950_10154052520510950 | I do not care if Donald Trump called a woman fat. I do not care if he tried to sleep with a woman or if he likes "beautiful" women. I care that he supports our police officers and first responders. I care that he supports guns and standing behind our military. I care that he supports the death penalty and is AGAINST abortion. I care that he supports enforcing immigration laws. I care that he wants to destroy radical Islamic groups. I care that he supports COAL. These are things I care about. Him talking sexually about women does not bother me. Were they mean words? Yes. Were they words spoken in PRIVATE? Yes. Have you ever talked to your friends about the opposite sex in private and said things? I'm positive all of you have. But, News Flash!! Women have been sexualized for centuries!! Jay-Z, Lil' Jon, Lil' Wayne and every single other rapper helped establish that platform, but people are ok with music blasted all over the radio degrading women. Ever heard of Victoria Secret? Or their fashion show? Ever heard of Hooters? People are ok with that too. Until all of these things are different, women will be viewed this way. Your precious Obama couldn't change that and Hillary can't either. I feel sorry for the women Donald has belittled and said terrible things about. But I'm still much more offended by what Hillary Clinton has DONE over what Donald Trump has SAID... PERIOD!!!! So Trump doesn't do well at the debates, maybe he even sounds childish and incapable. But he is speaking the truth! Just because he's not a polished politician like Hilary or Obama doesn't mean he's unqualified to be president. He cares for this country, not growing the size of his pockets. That man has so much money he could never spend it all. He gets NOTHING out of being president! I'm standing for the man accused of saying mean words. I'll never back a woman under three different scandal investigations, possible murder at Benghazi, and the secretive email scandal which has been nothing but lies from the beginning. And Hillary supports late term abortion (right up to the birth) how sick is that?And at the same time she is going around the country saying she's fighting for the children, yea right!the last time she was in the White House she stole $200,000 of furniture and then had the nerve to vandalize the White House on her way out!And you realize that all those refugees she wants to bring into the country are not bringing jobs in with them? So they will be taking jobs we don't have or they will be getting a check of your tax dollars!So the bottom line is HILLARY is going to bring in more people to compete for jobs that are not here,and TRUMP is going to bring back jobs that we desperately need.Which one do you think is going to help our economy?If not for the media Hillary would not be competing!If not for the corrupt democrats Hillary would be in jail!!!Trump 2016!!!

Why else would Al Gore want a recount? Why did Hillary, herself want a recount? There were 3 other Democrats that Demanded a recount! I watched a #PBS Documentary on about Hillary and Trump and "Politics" going forward to the election. There was a portion dedicated to President LBJ. A reporter asked if he thought there were Rigged elections. LBJ looked at a picture on his wall of 5 men surrounding a Ballot Box. The picture was from LBJ's first run for a Government Office. LBJ nodded towards the picture,laughed and said "what do you think?"

Obama: Many Republicans agree -- Trump is "temperamentally unfit" for the role of President.

1 | Barb Phelps Besl | 171 | 10154052455480950_10154052460690950 | I agree that you were unfit as a president. I'm willing to vote for a non- politician.... because our once great country has been driven into the ground by liberals like Obama & Clinton.
2 | Russell Parker | 113 | 10154052455480950_10154052460390950 | Remember in the debates when Hillary accused Trump of using some of his foundation money to buy a portrait at a charity auction?

3 | J Kendall Anderson | 31 | 10154052455480950_10154052473510950 | Democrats are absolutely frantic and pulling all the stops!  Do you think Obama is going to pay back his employers for the $200,000.00 per hour for Air Force One's fuel bill while he's flying around the country campaigning for Hillary?
4 | Diane Poplin | 20 | 10154052455480950_10154052495675950 | C. B. S. i turn the t. v. off to worse language than Trump said 12 years ago. We are tired of Heifer Hillary's temperment. She refused to visit Women & Children when we lost everything we had due to Hurricane Matthew. Hillary was within 50 miles from Women & Children that were living in shelters & she told the American Red Cross she did NOT have time for us, she also told the Red Cross we are NOT her problem. We don't have time for you Hillary. The only bridge you know is the one to your own pocket.

6 | Bryan Skyberg | 11 | 10154052455480950_10154052466240950 | Obama one of the greatest president in U.S History. The 114th congress will go down as the worst congress in U.S history with approval ratings in the single digits. While president Obama is in the upper sixty to low 70s approval rating

17 | Clarence Holmes | 0 | 10154052455480950_10154052462880950 | Given Trump’s stoking of racial animus and GOP state legislatures’ gerrymandering and blatant attempts at suppressing minority voting, we cannot say it is unnecessary in 2016 to protect voting rights in America. Media and Congressional Democrats must encourage public debate of the changes SCOTUS made to the Voting Rights Act in 2013. Suppressing people’s right to vote is a perversion of American democracy.

1 | Kim Fregia | 23 | 10154052357275950_10154052371220950 | I remember during Apollo 13, the real one, the astronauts got an extension on the tax return deadline because it took them so long to get home. It was something said to make them feel better and to help calm the country during the anticipation of their return.  My question is this: Can we send Trump into outer space until he publicly releases his tax returns? He doesn't need to be on the space station. Just put him in a suit with an umbilical cord.

The WWF just released their report for 2016 that scientists predict if we continue on the path of developing fossil fuels - sea life and wildlife will decline rapidly by the year 2020. Coastal communities will no longer be able to sustain themselves or depend on sea life for food. The Kuskokwim river in Alaska was suspended from commercial fishing this summer because no one is buying fish. Reports of sea life having boils and other deformities are affecting those who depend on it for subsistence. Schools need to recruit students and focus their efforts on stopping Fukishima from spilling more radiation in the ocean. It's evident Japan will not or cannot contain it alone. As long as radiation levels increase in the oceans, it will be pulled up in the clouds - rain on our mountains that lead to our rivers and streams; rain on our livestock and crops making food from the inland unsuitable to eat; and it will devastate the global landscape by killing trees we need for oxygen.Mankind cannot ignore the effects of Fukishima any longer. This will become of major national interest before most people know or are prepared.

Over the course of his entire presidential campaign, Donald Trump has been in a war with the media, often accusing news outlets of fabricating negatives stories about him to hurt his White House bid. While Trump's battle with the media is at an all-time high, there's one story that most mainstream media outlets have avoided reporting.Trump lawsuitIn the summer of 1994, a woman known only as "Jane Doe" was allegedly raped and threatened by Trump and convicted pedophile Jeffery Epstein. The woman previously filed a lawsuit in California, but the judge dismissed the case. Attempting to have her voice heard once again, "Jane Doe" made her case once again and it was strong enough to move forward in a New York court. Federal Judge Ronnie Abrams has since ordered a status conference to be held on December 16, with the legal representatives of both sides being present in the courtroom. As pointed out by the Bipartisan Report on October 23, new details have been revealed, painting a grim and dark picture about what allegedly went down over 20 years ago.The victim, known as "Jane Doe," filed the lawsuit under her assumed real name of Katie Johnson. Details in the lawsuit claim that she was the subject of, but not limited to, "acts of rape, sexual misconduct, criminal sexual acts," as well as "false imprisonment" and "threats of death." The incident apparently took place on more than one occasion, with the most emotionally scaring encounter occurring during the fourth and final time."Trump tied Plaintiff to a bed, exposed himself to Plaintiff, and then proceeded to forcibly rape Plaintiff," the lawsuit continues, describing the alleged rape as a "savage sexual attack." The plaintiff, "Jane Done" or Katie Johnson, claims she "loudly pleaded" for the former host of "The Apprentice" to stop, before he "violently" struck her face with his hand and informed the victim that he would "do whatever he wanted."In yet another bizarre twist to the alleged encounter, Epstein reportedly got into a heated exchange with Trump for taking the victim's virginity because he wanted to be the one to do so. In conclusion, both the Republican nominee and Epstein allegedly told the plaintiff that they would kill her and her family if she ever spoke about what happened.  A witness has come forward to confirm her story.Hiring Women Based on AppearancesGroping a Woman at a Manhattan NightclubGroping and Kissing a Former Apprentice ContestantKissing a Mar-a-Lago Guest at a Mother’s Day BrunchGroping a Woman Outside the 1998 U.S. Open Tennis ChampionshipSalma Hayak comes forward:  Trump planted a negative article about her after she refused to date himAn 11th person has come forward with allegations.

25 | Rebecca Laskey | 0 | 10154052357275950_10154052426310950 | DONALD TRUMP ANNOUNCEMENT ~ REGARDING THE NEWSWEEK REPORT:TRUMP IS A “HUGE” NATIONAL SECURITY RISK BECAUSE OF HIS BUSINESS, FINANCIAL AND PERSONAL TIES TO RUSSIA, CHINA, SAUDI ARABIA, IRAN, ETC…..In a stunning and damning expose just released, the truth behind the ties between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin are revealed, and American allies in Europe are growing increasingly concerned by Russian espionage and its interference in the U.S. election.A Friday Newsweek article by Kurt Eichenwald reveals the truth behind the Trump campaign and its ties to Russia’s President Vladimir Putin. It also shows the history behind Russia’s support of the Republican candidate through espionage and cyberattacks discovered by both U.S. and allied European intelligence agencies.According to Eichenwald, American allies are concerned about Russian interference in the U.S. election and that Donald Trump’s statements denying any collusion in recent cyberattacks have only encouraged Putin to become more aggressive in his espionage against Western countries. Eichenwald cites the input of government officials, law enforcement officers, and intelligence agencies in both the U.S. and Europe.According to information gained by Western allied intelligence sources, the Kremlin’s interference into the U.S. election is aimed more at crippling Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in revenge for what Putin felt was interference in Russian elections. Clinton’s statement in 2011, saying the Russian election was “neither free nor fair“ in regards to obvious cheating, has sent Putin into a rage and made him determined to destroy Clinton. Putin was also enticed by Trump’s compliments of his strength as a leader.Some of the information gained by Western intelligence sources reveal that Donald Trump has been surrounded by a number of advisers with ties to Putin or with financial and family ties to Russia. Former campaign manager Paul Manafort was forced to resign when it was revealed that he had ties to a pro-Russian Ukraine official. Carter Page, another former Trump adviser, is being investigated by U.S. and European intelligence agencies for engaging in back-channel discussions with Russian officials. Intelligence has also revealed that Trump adviser Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn is intimately tied to RT, a Russian news agency involved in distributing Russian propaganda.Donald Trump and his campaign have also been found to be spreading Russian propaganda. The Kremlin has been distributing misinformation as part of their normal activities via various networks, through both anonymous internet trolls, RT, and Sputnik, another propaganda news source. A manipulated document from one of the anonymous internet sources found itself being recited by Trump at a campaign rally. The campaign has also been spreading rumors from Sputnik, including a piece attacking Newsweek that was forwarded by Trump staff to a number of reporters in the U.S. with requests that those reporters pursue the false story.In accordance with his position as presidential nominee, U.S. intelligence agencies have briefed Trump about Russia’s attempts to influence the election, but Trump has persisted in publicly denying these serious allegations, calling them unreliable, and dismissing them as possibly being perpetrated by some “400-pound guy sitting on their bed” or even a child.European officials have told Newsweek that Trump’s statements have alarmed our NATO partners, because Trump refuses to believe the intelligence briefings he received or simply doesn’t understand them. They are also convinced that Trump could be misleading the American people for reasons of his own.One British official said that members of the U.K. government who are fully aware of Russia’s interference find Trump’s response “quite disturbing.” They’re concerned that should he be elected, Trump would ignore and dismiss his own and allied intelligence services.Western law enforcement and intelligence agencies say that the Russian hacking and disinformation campaign includes tens of thousands of people in Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Novosibirsk. They say there are also operations inside the United States, working from New York City, Miami, and Washington D.C., mainly using Russian immigrants, although other foreign nationals and American citizens are also involved. According to intelligence received, those involved are being paid via a Russian pension scheme. One U.S. official told Newsweek that evidence shows that many of the Americans and other foreign nationals involved are unaware that they are part of Russia’s propaganda machine.American intelligence is also aware that Russia used cyber espionage and propaganda to interfere with other elections in the West, including the German elections last month and the June Brexit vote in the U.K., the results of both of which weakened the ties between those countries and the EU and NATO.According to a European intelligence expert, Russia is releasing its disinformation to disrupt the U.S. election through WikiLeaks, but states that the “pipeline” through which the information flows contains numerous steps and so many filters that it is likely that the WikiLeaks organization itself does not know the source of the information.Interestingly enough, despite the Russian president’s support of Donald Trump, at one point, support for the Republican nominee was halted due to his volatile and unstable nature. According to intelligence sources, the Kremlin backed off supporting Trump when he attacked the Kahn Gold Star family publicly. The Kremlin assumed that the nominee would be forced to withdraw from the race due to his psychological unfitness, so put the hacking campaign on hold. According to reports provided to Western intelligence sources, even Putin thought Trump was unfit to be president, despite the advantages to him of a Trump presidency.According to information provided to Western intelligence agencies, Putin is satisfied that his campaign of cyber espionage has turned the tide in his direction. Putin has told his associates that even if Clinton wins the White House, she will be too busy rectifying the chaos that his leaked misinformation has wrought to interfere with his plans in Syria, Ukraine, and elsewhere.European allies are particularly stunned by Donald Trump’s refusal to credit his own intelligence services, and British officials were particularly horrified when Trump dismissed the validity of those sources. According to one British official the most disturbing evidence of Trump’s negligence was during the third presidential debate. In rebuttal to Clinton’s accusation that he was encouraging Russian cyberattacks, Trump said that she had no idea where the cyberattacks were coming from.‘Hillary, you have no idea… Our country has no idea.’According to Newsweek, all of our intelligence sources and those of our NATO allies know that Russia is behind the hacking. Although Trump has been briefed, he continues to dismiss the information. Eichenwald sums up the exposes with some chilling thoughts:‘Should the United States, the last remaining superpower, tilt its policies away from NATO to the benefit of Russia, the alliance between America and Western Europe could be transformed in unprecedented ways. And so, for perhaps the first time since World War II, countries in Western Europe fear that the American election, should Trump win, could trigger events that imperil their national security and do potentially irreparable harm to the alliances that have kept the continent safe for decades.’IF YOU CARE, SHARE!

Jill Stein. if people really want to make 'herstory', then they should back her and not Clinton. your feminism should not stop at the border. Clinton has done so many sudden vote-grabbing u-turns on minorities, but that seems not to matter. people also don't want to factor in all the killing and blowing to oblivion of innocents abroad that Clinton has pushed, is pushing, and will continue to push even more once she gets in. instead people want to swallow the mass media's torching of Trump which terrifies them into voting for Clinton. with Clinton, nuclear attack will still be on the table; wars will be perpetuated; resources will continue to be plundered. to speak of backing a "lesser of two evils" boggles the mind. especially if you acknowledge the deadly force of Clinton and then go ahead and vote for her anyway; or if you claim solidarity with the DAPL water protectors but vote for a woman who will gladly push pipelines and fracking; if you care for the lives of women, Latinos, black people, queer people that might be threatened by Trump but don't blink an eye at girls and boys killed in Syria and everywhere else..etcOh right. You are not being bombed; you are not a refugee; you are not drowning in the Mediterranean!too many people are afraid to come together. don't accept evil, fight it! xxanyway, Qaadir Howard articulates it much more powerfully: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2PZY0orIHZA

Hillary draws a few hundred. Tim Kaine 30. If they win, despite the overwhelming evidence otherwise, we must as Americans accept a Pres  who will eventually be prosecuted and settle for Kaine. What we won't be is supportive.
6 | Shel Marie | 1 | 10154052262390950_10154052507570950 | #StopFukishima #CleantheOcean #JillStein for PresidentThe ocean's acidification levels are rising exponentially. The WWF just released their report for 2016 that scientists predict if we continue on the path of developing fossil fuels - sea life and wildlife will decline rapidly by the year 2020. Coastal communities will no longer be able to sustain themselves or depend on sea life for food. The Kuskokwim river in Alaska was suspended from commercial fishing this summer because no one is buying fish. Reports of sea life having boils and other deformities are affecting those who depend on it for subsistence. Schools need to recruit students and focus their efforts on stopping Fukishima from spilling more radiation in the ocean. It's evident Japan will not or cannot contain it alone. As long as radiation levels increase in the oceans, it will be pulled up in the clouds - rain on our mountains that lead to our rivers and streams; rain on our livestock and crops making food from the inland unsuitable to eat; and it will devastate the global landscape by killing trees we need for oxygen.Mankind cannot ignore the effects of Fukishima any longer. This will become of major national interest before most people know or are prepared.

8 | Melissa Jo Walker | 0 | 10154052262390950_10154052473690950 | Time is short to spread the truth, you know what to do..Wikileak s emails out of the DNC reveal a plan to paint Donald Trump as a sexual predator with ties to Putin. None of these emails have been proven false. The liberal secular humanist mind is not tied to truth. The means justifies the ends. Hillary is the most corrupt candidate ever to run for office. The Clinton Foundation is in collusion with the Government for regime change and gun running operations and kick backs around the world. There is no rule of law in our Government right now, the media has worked with the CIA in the regime change propaganda operations. They cannot have Trump become president because he will bring down the entire machine. Even Obama used the server. Many people in our Government are guilty of felonies and treason.This election is about American nationalist patriots vs the NWO and their programmed. Which are you?The image of Trump is a media propaganda construct. In the Alinsky process what you are guilty of you place  on the enemy to try and keep the focus off of you. Hillary' s Ex secret service details believe she is a violent sociopath who will be a dictator. The Clinton Foundation is in collusion with many many aspects of the Government for regime change gun running and kick backs around the globe so many people are paid for or blackmailed..." One who fears corruption fears life."Alinsky Clinton's pen palTrump is a blue collar billionaire who due to his status was tempted on many levels. With all of the temptation I am surprised through all their digging they have not found much more. He is 70 years old. Those who accuse him of groping have no evidence. The one who accused him of rape has dropped her case. At around the same time Hillary was calling black children super-predators without empathy or conscience and talking about building a wall and having distain for illegal immigrants on street corners waiting for jobs that she said they should not be allowed to have. At the same time she was praising Senator Byrd a member of the KKK and Margaret Sanger who called for the extermination of the black race, calling Jews F...en jews, using the word nigger, calling mentally disabled children retards, being involved in scandal after scandal in which fall guys went to prison, left the country or died, Trump was...Receiving the New York Ellis island award for his dedication to ethnic causes, being praised by Jesse Jackson for his real estate donations and dedication to Jesse Jackson s Rainbow push program. At the same time Hillary was paying for access to all white country clubs he was suing the cronies in Palm Beach for not allowing blacks and Jews into their Clubs. Did Hillary ever speak out about blacks and Jews not being allowed into the Clubs she belonged to?Trump was sued over an apartment dispute that was racially motivated during a time the Government begin to push unfunded mandates on apartment owner to rent to minorities. It was around the same time section 8 was going to start up. Trumps dads apartments were made an example of along with many other owners in New York because of the size of the complex.Did he receive the Ellis island award before or after the apartment scandal?Did he receive the accolades From Jesse Jackson before or after the apartment scandal?Did he sue the cronies in Palm Beach before or after the apartment scandal?The media has created an all out war against Trump through dis honesty. Trump did not make fun of a disability that a reporter had. He has family members with disabilities. Trump mimicked someone who was caught in a lie and back peddling in a story. He has made the same movements over and over again to express different people lying and back peddling. The reporters condition is a paralysis of the hand. There is no movement. By definition Trump could not have mimicked the reporter unless he mimicked the static paralysis which he did not.Trump did not attack the Son of Gold Star parents. The DNC knew that Mr Kahn followed and was an expert on sharia law. Trumps response to Mr. Kahn and his wife was because Trump has people on his team who know the Muslim plan for sharia law in America. He was most likely very frustrated by what he saw knowing the plan behind it. Those who follow sharia have a goal of a world wide Caliphate.  Only in an Obama and Hillary world can a sharia following Muslim who makes money through the refugee program attack Trump by referring to the Constitution. Article 6 of the Constitution outlaws sharia law. What the media and Hillary and the DNC does is to count on the stupidity of the general public.In order to be a racist you have to fall under the definition of a racist not the contrived emotional response the media propaganda machine, the DNC, and Hillary want you to believe. Did Hillary think Trump was a racist before or after she went to his wedding? A racist believes his race is superior to all others.Trumps response to the judge hearing the Trump University case was not racist. The judge was pro open borders and illegal immigration and his wife is tied to the Clinton Foundation. This is a conflict of interest to one who wants legal immigration and wants to build a wall. It is illegal immigrants that hurts the job market of legal immigrants.When Trump referred to the Mexicans coming across the border, a percentage being rapist and murderers he did so in the context of illegal immigrants and sanctuary cities. Do you want the MS 13 EX military hit squads and drug runners to have a revolving door into America?In order to be misogynist you have to hate woman. Trump treats woman and men equally. His company has more woman in high level positions than most. Out of over 500 companies 6 have gone bankrupt during tumultuous times.  Rosie O'Donald attacked his family so Trump wearing his heart on his sleeve attacked her. He says what he thinks, sometimes tooo much. He does not have the contrived pathological liar thought process of Hillary or Obama. There is no evidence that Trump ever called Ms Machado Ms Piggy and even if he did it does not follow under the definition of misogynist. There is evidence that he argued with the board of the pageant and saved her job. Her history is terrible yet Hillary parades her around counting on the stupidity of the masses falling for the deception.  Hillary is parading this woman around counting on the stupidity and laziness of the public. Your own ego is your worst enemy that they will use against you. 11 years ago the blue collar billionaire trying to impress some so called friends said some stupid words about sexual conquests. I have heard that woman in locker rooms and strip clubs say pretty much the same about men. Trump apologised for what he said. Trump is a flawed man on a spiritual journey. I believe because of realizing what he is up against and the Christians he has surrounded himself with, this spiritual journey is leading him to great things.

Surely I have.But if the above possibilities are repugnant to you, we only have one choice, and that is Donald Trump. It is not Gary Johnson; it is not Jill Stein; it is not John McCain, and it is not Mickey Mouse. Hillary will delete America as quickly as her emails and think no more of it.  She will horse laugh and give America the finger and go and launder more money.

If it is Hillary, think of the groups of people that will celebrate. Illegal Immigrants, criminals and future criminals who will be supported for pulling a gun on a police officer, planned parenthood, the media, and the list goes on and on that represent everything that is wrong with America. If you're still "with her," look around at who you'll be celebrating with. Now imagine waking up knowing that Trump is our new President. You may or may not like him, or really know what kind of president he will be. But here are some things you will know for sure:• The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.• The media has been neutered forever.• Career politicians will have lost all job security.• The guns in your home will safely stay there.• Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.• Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally• Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.• No more apologies to the world for being great!• Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.• Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.• There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.• The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.• The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.Copy and paste this as your status if you support and will vote Donald Trump for president 2016."

6 | Amit Barua | 1 | 10154052193325950_10154052316480950 | Trump is trying to be the shock jock politician, says things so outrageous that it will distract a persons mind and momentarily stop questioning. Magicians call it distraction, at which point they can slip things by you without you noticing it, until it's too late. Like pick pockets, they bump into you, and empty your pocket. This is a mental pick pocketing.

The money's rolling in and this is fun," Moonves went on. "I've never seen anything like this, and this going to be a very good year for us. Sorry. It's a terrible thing to say.

Trump supporters don't go to the Hillary rallies and do these despicable things. Trump supporters are jumped, bullied, egged, cars damaged and denied their right to assemble. The Hillary Hitler Youth is firebombing Trump Election headquarters and vandalizing homes with Trump signs. Now you tell me who the fear-mongers are? Hillary is evil and promotes evil.

Hillary' s Ex secret service details believe she is a violent sociopath who will be a dictator. The Clinton Foundation is in collusion with many many aspects of the Government for regime change gun running and kick backs around the globe so many people are paid for or blackmailed..." One who fears corruption fears life."Alinsky Clinton's pen palTrump is a blue collar billionaire who due to his status was tempted on many levels. With all of the temptation I am surprised through all their digging they have not found much more. He is 70 years old. Those who accuse him of groping have no evidence. The one who accused him of rape has dropped her case. At around the same time Hillary was calling black children super-predators without empathy or conscience and talking about building a wall and having distain for illegal immigrants on street corners waiting for jobs that she said they should not be allowed to have. At the same time she was praising Senator Byrd a member of the KKK and Margaret Sanger who called for the extermination of the black race, calling Jews F...en jews, using the word nigger, calling mentally disabled children retards, being involved in scandal after scandal in which fall guys went to prison, left the country or died, Trump was...Receiving the New York Ellis island award for his dedication to ethnic causes, being praised by Jesse Jackson for his real estate donations and dedication to Jesse Jackson s Rainbow push program. At the same time Hillary was paying for access to all white country clubs he was suing the cronies in Palm Beach for not allowing blacks and Jews into their Clubs. Did Hillary ever speak out about blacks and Jews not being allowed into the Clubs she belonged to?Trump was sued over an apartment dispute that was racially motivated during a time the Government begin to push unfunded mandates on apartment owner to rent to minorities. It was around the same time section 8 was going to start up. Trumps dads apartments were made an example of along with many other owners in New York because of the size of the complex.Did he receive the Ellis island award before or after the apartment scandal?Did he receive the accolades From Jesse Jackson before or after the apartment scandal?Did he sue the cronies in Palm Beach before or after the apartment scandal?The media has created an all out war against Trump through dis honesty. Trump did not make fun of a disability that a reporter had. He has family members with disabilities. Trump mimicked someone who was caught in a lie and back peddling in a story. He has made the same movements over and over again to express different people lying and back peddling. The reporters condition is a paralysis of the hand. There is no movement. By definition Trump could not have mimicked the reporter unless he mimicked the static paralysis which he did not.Trump did not attack the Son of Gold Star parents. The DNC knew that Mr Kahn followed and was an expert on sharia law. Trumps response to Mr. Kahn and his wife was because Trump has people on his team who know the Muslim plan for sharia law in America. He was most likely very frustrated by what he saw knowing the plan behind it. Those who follow sharia have a goal of a world wide Caliphate.  Only in an Obama and Hillary world can a sharia following Muslim who makes money through the refugee program attack Trump by referring to the Constitution. Article 6 of the Constitution outlaws sharia law. What the media and Hillary and the DNC does is to count on the stupidity of the general public.In order to be a racist you have to fall under the definition of a racist not the contrived emotional response the media propaganda machine, the DNC, and Hillary want you to believe. Did Hillary think Trump was a racist before or after she went to his wedding? A racist believes his race is superior to all others.Trumps response to the judge hearing the Trump University case was not racist. The judge was pro open borders and illegal immigration and his wife is tied to the Clinton Foundation. This is a conflict of interest to one who wants legal immigration and wants to build a wall. It is illegal immigrants that hurts the job market of legal immigrants.When Trump referred to the Mexicans coming across the border, a percentage being rapist and murderers he did so in the context of illegal immigrants and sanctuary cities. Do you want the MS 13 EX military hit squads and drug runners to have a revolving door into America?In order to be misogynist you have to hate woman. Trump treats woman and men equally. His company has more woman in high level positions than most. Out of over 500 companies 6 have gone bankrupt during tumultuous times.  Rosie O'Donald attacked his family so Trump wearing his heart on his sleeve attacked her. He says what he thinks, sometimes tooo much. He does not have the contrived pathological liar thought process of Hillary or Obama. There is no evidence that Trump ever called Ms Machado Ms Piggy and even if he did it does not follow under the definition of misogynist. There is evidence that he argued with the board of the pageant and saved her job. Her history is terrible yet Hillary parades her around counting on the stupidity of the masses falling for the deception.  Hillary is parading this woman around counting on the stupidity and laziness of the public. Your own ego is your worst enemy that they will use against you. 11 years ago the blue collar billionaire trying to impress some so called friends said some stupid words about sexual conquests. I have heard that woman in locker rooms and strip clubs say pretty much the same about men. Trump apologised for what he said. Trump is a flawed man on a spiritual journey. I believe because of realizing what he is up against and the Christians he has surrounded himself with, this spiritual journey is leading him to great things.

The WWF just released their report for 2016 that scientists predict if we continue on the path of developing fossil fuels - sea life and wildlife will decline rapidly by the year 2020. Coastal communities will no longer be able to sustain themselves or depend on sea life for food. The Kuskokwim river in Alaska was suspended from commercial fishing this summer because no one is buying fish. Reports of sea life having boils and other deformities are affecting those who depend on it for subsistence. Schools need to recruit students and focus their efforts on stopping Fukishima from spilling more radiation in the ocean. It's evident Japan will not or cannot contain it alone. As long as radiation levels increase in the oceans, it will be pulled up in the clouds - rain on our mountains that lead to our rivers and streams; rain on our livestock and crops making food from the inland unsuitable to eat; and it will devastate the global landscape by killing trees we need for oxygen.Mankind cannot ignore the effects of Fukishima any longer. This will become of major national interest before most people know or are prepared.

8 | William House | 0 | 10154052103635950_10154052120090950 | What Went Wrong—and Right—with Reagan’s “Amnesty”By Matthew Soerens November 6, 2011 ...The problem is that since IRCA did not adequately address the fundamental flaws in our legal immigration system by tying the number of work-based visas available to the needs of the labor market, employers and their lobbies in D.C. pushed back against employer sanction provisions of IRCA. They argued that, without access to unauthorized immigrant labor and without new mechanisms to obtain authorized immigrant labor, their businesses could not succeed.  It took very little time after IRCA’s passage for companies to find ways around these employer sanction provisions, hiring workers as “sub-contractors” rather than employees in some cases, and resisting efforts to create less-easily falsifiable documents while arguing that they could not be expected to distinguish between genuine and fraudulent documents.  Employment agencies have flourished, allowing corporations to essentially outsource their legal liability, because they simply contract with the employment agency and are not themselves responsible for verifying their workers’ legal status.  With a strong lobby against them, no Administration (Republican or Democratic) has seriously and consistently enforced these employer sanctions.  And since undocumented workers could still find work in the U.S., they still came—in unprecedented numbers....most corporations simply want adequate workers and would prefer that they have legal status.  The real failure of IRCA was that legislators made it (theoretically) harder to immigrate and work illegally but did not adequately address the fundamental problem: that our antiquated quotas on legal migration were (and still are) entirely out-of-sync with the U.S. labor market.  Most employers would be willing to accept a functional employment authorization system (the technology exists to dramatically minimize fraud, if we wanted to deploy it) if they were guaranteed an adequate flow of legal workers. All that said, it’s also important to highlight where IRCA did not fail.  The “amnesty” provision, which President Reagan said as he signed the bill would “go far to improve the lives of a class of individuals who now must hide in the shadows, without access to many of the benefits of a free and open society,” did just that.  As a legal counselor, I’ve helped hundreds of immigrants who were granted legal status through IRCA to naturalize and become proud American citizens.  Almost all those who legalized were able to improve their economic situation, which meant (beyond the benefit to themselves and their children) that they went on to pay much more in taxes than they would have as low-wage undocumented workers.  Many—freed to be entrepreneurial in a way that their lack of a Social Security card made nearly impossible—went on to start businesses, reinvigorating the local economies of many communities...See full article AMNESTY NOW DEFEAT THE REPUBLICAN KKK EVERYWHERE

19 | William House | 0 | 10154052103635950_10154052119305950 | Manufacturing grew with Bill Clinton and Barack ObamaW Bush failed to enforce trade lawsIt is the Republican KKK who is  responsible for American job loss, not trade deals Facts from CNNMoney looks at trade's impact on American jobs and Americans' livesJune 29, 2016By Tami Luhby ...The number of manufacturing jobs rose for years after NAFTA was signed. There were just under 16.9 million people employed in manufacturing in the U.S. at the start of 1994. The figure rose to as high as 17.6 million in 1998 and remained above 17 million until March of 2001, soon after former President Bill Clinton left office. The number of people employed in manufacturing has risen from a low of 11.5 million in early 2010 to 12.3 million last month under President Obama ...Economists are more united in the view that America has lost jobs to China. The U.S began sending manufacturing jobs to China before it joined the World Trade Organization in late 2001. MIT Professor David Autor estimates that the U.S. has lost around 1 million manufacturing positions and 2 million jobs total to China between 1999 and 2011. This is about one-fifth of the manufacturing jobs lost during that time....The nation has seen a decline of nearly 5.5 million manufacturing jobs over the past 25 years.The job losses in manufacturing came during the W Bush administration Donald Trump's 7 point trade plan has NOTHING FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS...Donald Trump tariffs would cost the average household $2,200 a year, or 4% of their after-tax income, according to a study from the National Foundation for American Policy conducted by David Tuerck, Paul Bachman and Frank Conte, all of Suffolk University. This is largely because imports under Trump's policy would become more expensive, raising the price of competing American-made goods by 11%. That would effectively levy a consumption tax on purchases and cut into the incomes of shoppers.Donald Trump's 7 point trade plan is economic nationalism to match his racist nationalism and has nothing to assure that American wages would riseRather, Donald Trump continues to support positions that destroy America's middle class including support for right to work states (Taft-hartley) in opposition to unions, as well as opposing raising the minimum wage and clean energy infrastructure investment And of course Donald Trump supports more tax cuts for the wealthy like himself which has created debt and starved our infrastructure of needed funding Franklin Roosevelt saved capitalism with sound financial policy which included 90% top tax rates paying down the national debt and funding the greatest infrastructure and social services in history As Elizabeth Warren pointed out, it is who writes our trade deals that determines who benefits As Bill Clinton pointed out it is who enforces trade deals that determines who benefits Trade deals that grow a stable middle class at home and abroad are the best way to prevent wars and secure prosperity Federal Reserve monitory policy smooths out the business cycle and this currency manipulation must not be demonized like Donald Trump does immigrants Government spending on infrastructure derided by many as pork barrel spending enhances our standard of living and helps to stabilize our economy Immigrants with economic and civil rights benefit our economy like every other consumer It is imperative that America does not fall to the divisive and destructive ignorant bigotry of Donald Trump and the Republican KKK's economic, social and environmental agenda of arrogance, injustice and neglectDonald Trump continues to endorse cutting regulations on corporations and banks further putting our economic, labor and environmental standards of living in jeprody Ignorance and bigotry are not solutions for our modern economy and common humanityDonald Trump's 7 point trade plan is just more superficial bigotry Don't be Fooled Again by the Republican KKK for the future of the millennial generation for the future of America for the future of Humanity on our planet Unite

They just love to jump in take credit for what The Lord spoke thousands of years ago. Well I'll continue on say my vision is of TRUMP SIGNING A DOCUMENT IN THE OVIL OFFICE. He will change the face of the nation in ways we could not have predicted! Many will call them improvements, while other will their loss of power. The first to go will be the firing of the DOJ and FBI heads. The Repeal of Obama care, by executive action as Obama did in many of his decisions made unilaterally, without legislation. That will put money back in the pockets of those who are healthy, help them build a 401K or a health plan savings account. The young people will benefit either way. Money they can use to pay off college debt, or save when disasters come into play as they will in the coming years ahead. If by some chance people allow Hillary into office it will become just like Obama before her, higher taxes, racial tensions, CIVIL CONFLICT ABOUND, that's the darkness, from the gates of hell opening I spoke of in the beginning of this blog. YOU THE VOTERS WILL CHOOSE YOUR DESTINY.
22 | Michael Larabell | 0 | 10154052103635950_10154052185060950 | Why I am voting for Donald Trump without mention Hillary. I challenge anyone supporting Hillary to do the same without mentioning Bill or Trump. 1. Stop the inflow of illegals coming over our boarders, putting a major strain on the cities, states and our country. We are already going broke. We can not afford to provide these people with food, shelter, schooling and medical care. 2. Stop the inflow of refugees that have not been screened. To much of a chance if ISIS or any other terrorist group to gain entry to our country. 3. Abolish and replace Obamacare. Millions of middle class families are forced to paying thousands of dollars for Obamacare and will never meet their yearly deductible, thus still having to pay out of pocket for all of their medical care. This is billions of dollars that could be spent growing our economy. 4. Trump owes nobody any favors in Washington. He is already filthy rich, so he does not have to accept donations from anybody including foreign countries in exchange for political favors. 5. He is not afraid to call anyone out if they are wrong regardless to what party they belong to. 6. Our companies are so over regulated that billions and billions of dollars are wasted trying to keep up and follow all of the executive orders that need to be over turned. 7. Bring our companies back home. We need to have it so companies can operate in this country without being over taxed. The jobs that will be created will pay more in taxes than what we will lose by lowering the cooperate tax rate putting more money to work growing our economy. 8. Renegotiate our trade agreements with other countries to make it more fair for American companies selling goods in other countries. 9. Bring law and order back to out country. Nobody is above the law regardless of who you are and who you know. 10. Secure funding for the schools and work training for the inner city communities.

Large Latino vote makes this a closer vote than it should be, but Trump will pull it out.North Carolina:  Low black voter turnout plays major role.Nevada: The Latino vote is making this a close race, but the residents of NV are being crushed by illegal immigration — they will prevail for Trump.New Hampshire: Drug epidemic leads voters to push for a secure border.This is the most unique election we have ever seen.  Everything has been turned upside down.  Month after month Donald Trump has caused pollsters, pundits, politicians, and consultants to scratch their heads in confusion.Trump grabbed more votes than any Republican in primary history.  Keep in mind that many states do not allow Independents to vote in the primaries.  Fox News put out a poll today stating Trump leads with Independents (Trump 41 / Clinton 32).  Thus, there is an entire voting bloc who has yet to have their voices heard.  Tack on the low African American turnout for Hillary, and then layer on all the people who are voting for the very first time…. Trump wins the presidency.

As a nation, we have allowed your Word to be taken out of our society. We have allowed untold numbers of children to be murdered. We have stood silently by and watched a once great country; founded on your truths and principles become a modern-day Sodom and Gomorrah. We have watched your church sell its soul for the golden idol of a 501C tax classification. We have allowed some of your children to be treated so poorly; and not cried out for justice. I beseech you Father please do not abandon us in our time of need. I ask you Father that you would be merciful on your children so that we might yet repent and return to the love of our youth. Spare us Lord if you can find just a few righteous crying out for mercy. We are so torn and divided; we are no longer one nation under God.Your humble child who has not kept your word all the days of his life, and is a sinner Lord; but who tries to live his life as you would require; yet too often fails, begs for mercy on this land. Never the less Lord thy will be done.AmenAnonymous.

The choice is simple; bigger, corrupt government with higher taxes and rising ObamaCare costs, NAFTA-like Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), open borders, and government school conformity under Hillary Clinton or smaller government with lower taxes to attract more investment into building and bringing back industry to the US, interstate competition for lower-cost health care, secure borders, and school choice for all.

5 | JoAnne Saunders | 20 | 10154052020625950_10154052034165950 | I have faith in Americans. I believe more people see the corruption, than don't. I hope I am right! Look at the FL numbers coming out. Landslide for trump so far. I didn't start off on the Trump Train, but I know way to much about the investigations to ever vote for HRC. She and her gang are ruining our country. It's not time for a woman that has no character. Damn if I would ever want my daughter to aspire to be her.  I just finished reading what happened with her and Watergate, and more importantly, what she did her dissertation on at Wellesley. It is very telling. She has had total contempt for the government from the get go.  You hear much about her dissertation on Saul Alinsky, what you don't hear is she thought he was wrong. He believed you joined groups to get among the system and worked from the outside to take them over.  SHE believed you WORK FROM THE INSIDE to take over organizations and OUR GOVERNMENT. Not much has changed evidently in her thinking. The key word here is OUR GOVERNMENT. We are not VICTIMS if we allow this to happen, we are ACCOMPLICES! Trump may not be the best in your mind but I bet in four years, he will have bettered some things as opposed to ruining all with ongoing, inside, make your head spin, antics. #Trumptrain2016

Did you miss that?How about deleting emails after she was subpoenaed to hand them over to the Fed? You realize that’s Obstruction of Justice, right?And why did she destroy 13 devices with a hammer and acid-wash e-mails? Oh, and how about getting the rapist of a teenage girl off on rape charges then laughing about it? Did you miss that too?How about when she lied to the American people about Benghazi? You realize that story about the video was a lie, and she knew it was a lie, right?Did you miss her lying to the American people about her emails?How about when she lied about being under sniper fire?Well, then there was those times she lied about lying to the American people. Miss those too?What about that ‘pay for play’ with the Clinton Cash Foundation? That’s kind of hard to miss, huh?Did you miss all those other scandals she was in? You know… TravelGate, FileGate, WhiteWater, Rose law Firm, Vince Foster… she has a long list of scandals, you know...Did you miss her belittling her husband's sexual harassment ( and rape ) accusers? Oh – but the Paula Jones case was settled for $850,000 and Bill was impeached… for lying…AND THEN, there’s the case of his illegitimate son, Danny Williams-Clinton, a son he made while keeping a black prostitute on retainer while he was still in Arkansas? You know she was labeled "Extremely careless" about national security by the FBI, right?And don’t you know there is evidence now that she cheated with the debates by getting questions ahead of time? Have you caught her latest lies about not knowing what the (C) meant on the classified documents? Or, that she can’t remember any briefings on how to handle classified material?Did you know that during her interview with the FBI she said she couldn’t remember 39 times?Did you know that during the Star Investigation she used that same defense of ‘I don’t recall’ 56 times?Did you hear her say she will raise taxes on the middle class? Did you know she had to return stolen items from the White House the last time they left?Did you miss the fact that her and Bill Clinton stole 6 Billion Dollars that was meant to rebuild Haiti?Have you seen the movies and several documentaries made about her questionable ethics?Don’t you wonder why she made congress and others spend millions and millions of tax dollars having hearings and investigating her numerous times, finding that she lied, that would not have been spent if she would have simply told the truth in the first place ! Facts - all facts !Don’t you wonder about all the illegal stuff she’s done that we don’t know?.......yet?  But you are going to vote for her because.... she's a woman or you don't like Donald Trump?

Right now I do believe that we need to stay human and give people the chance to come to our country but times are different from our for fathers then we had more room and more jobs to fill!! At this point in time we do need to close the borders for a while and give our country time to heal and grow! We can't save the world as much as I wish we could we just can't do it anymore at our own expense!

The money's rolling in and this is fun," Moonves went on. "I've never seen anything like this, and this going to be a very good year for us. Sorry. It's a terrible thing to say.

19 | Delray Richardson | 2 | 10154052020625950_10154052047800950 | This is the same guy who said he would fund his own campaign but now has ads on Facebook asking for campaign contributions, knowing that he's not going to win. Also the same guy who said that the Clinton Foundation is a fraud when he gave $250,000 to the Clinton Foundation... Donald J. Trump is done.. Stick a fork in him.. Donald J. Trump is a lying sexual superpredator who is taking advantage of people's bigotry to adopt adverse positions against their own self interests. Unfortunately, many poor & middle class Caucasian people have been falling for this trickery that's performed by rich Caucasian's for hundreds of years, including 2016. A lot of Trumpsters suffer from cognitive dissonance which means, your opinions are the result of years of paying attention to ... while ignoring facts & information which challenged your preconceived notions. Choosing to ignore Donald J. Trump open racism, demagogic appeals, the faux-populist rhetoric and the dehumanizing of Women, Muslims, African Americans, Latinos and other minorities doesn't mean it don't exist. Faced with this parade of evidence, some can only conclude that Trump and the Clintons are in it to win it together by getting Trump to lose it. In a 2012 interview with Fox, Donald Trump called Hillary Clinton a "terrific woman." "I really like her and her husband both a lot. I think she really works hard," Trump had said. "When I needed Hillary Clinton, she was there," he said in July. "If I say, 'go to my wedding,' they go to my wedding." Donald J. Trump has just pulled off one of the best acting jobs in american history. (You have all been fooled by a guy who never wanted to be president, but only wanted to help his friend Hillary win.) That's the reason Donald J. Trump would never release his taxes. #DelfunkboyMusic #MahoganyMasterpiece #FactsMatter #HillaryClinton #DonaldTrump #RiggedElection #VoteHillary #TheWhiteHouse #Grabthembythepussy #BadHombres

After much research I have come to the conclusion that Hillary Clinton is the greatest threat to global security since the guy with the little moustache. Therefore I am hoping (on that basis alone) that The Donald wins tomorrow. #TrumpWins #ClintonCrooks
2 | Tracee Ducker | 64 | 10154051945450950_10154051972955950 | It's not about a government treating the average person with dignity! It's about the special treatment the elite receive! We would have been locked up a long time ago!!!!

He's one of the reasons your jobs have disappeared to China, India, Mexico. etc. Did you know OREO cookies fired all its American workers and moved its factories to Mexico? Directly due to Obama/Biden/Hillary. You'd be stupid to vote for more because you are next to get the axe.

The lie can be maintained only for such time as the State can shield the people from the political, economic and/or military consequences of the lie. It thus becomes vitally important for the State to use all of its powers to repress dissent, for the truth is the mortal enemy of the lie, and thus by extension, the truth is the greatest enemy of the state." - Reich Master of Nazi Propaganda Joseph Goebbels
9 | Pat Souza | 4 | 10154051945450950_10154052099280950 | I have been saying for years we need to clean house. In Trumps words, "Drain the Swamp." Out of all these politicians in D.C. only a handful are worth a damn. (both sides) It is time for a major change. I hope Trump wins by a landslide.

11 | Paul Hayward | 5 | 10154051945450950_10154052056795950 | This election has pit friend against friend, family member against family member... it's a bit tragic considering BOTH candidates have a 59% unfavorable rating.... Yet we all must come to our own conclusion. I applaud all those who care - who vote with conscience... but as for me, I cannot allow the Juggernaut that rolled over Bernie Sanders - the Clinton Juggernaut.... the Clinton Foundation, with it's entourage of Soros, Bloomberg, and their Minions of Lawyers, Lobbyists, Panderers, and Multi-National Contributors - to continue to obfuscate our due process for their personal gain. I can no longer condone the "Public Doesn't Need To Know" atmosphere that has permeated EVERY Clinton Involved Crisis. I can no longer accept the "business as usual" atmosphere of Washington DC where obvious crimes are committed, but no culprit is ever named - NO ONE gets jail time, and some even get bonuses. I can no longer tolerate Agencies writing Law, subverting the due process of parliamentary law, and the input of the Voter. I can no longer stand the appointing of individuals with clear Conflicts of Interest to Government Panels and Agencies. I have come to HATE how the Citizens of the Republic are not given the TRUTH, but must dig it up on their own from the likes of Snowden and Assange. This machine we speak of is well oiled, and has been poised for this moment for quite some time. All who stand to gain are poised with it, and we already know it's direction, and it's yielding to the wishes of corporations and contributors. Though we ALL KNOW this MUST NOT continue, you must follow your instincts and make a value judgement when you vote, that cannot be rescinded. Trump is now running to be The New Apprentice - to a job where his experience will be tested. Some feel his "bull in a china shop" attitude might well be just what DC needs. Could he be the "tough drill sergeant" that everyone hates and is yet indispensable? Is Trump the "tough love" that our Nation needs at this juncture? One expects that there would be fewer $400 hammers bought by the military during a Trump tenure... and that perhaps under new Administration, we would not leave millions of dollars of military equipment in the desert for our enemies to then use against us.... one might conclude that some needless governmental middle and upper management jobs might come under scrutiny... and some would be FIRED. The possibility of renegotiated trade deals and medicare drug prices would be welcome to most. And THEN there's the possibility that the reports from 61 Inspector Generals and the entire General Accounting Office (GAO) on how to reduce Government Spending, now largely ignored, might FINALLY actually be listened to. But most of all?? Maybe we will finally stop kidding ourselves and recognize that the Highest-In-The-World Taxes that we have burdened American Business with (in order to pay for our wars and welfare) is PRECISELY what has led to the migration of American Jobs overseas AND by proxy, led to millions of hours of lost work, and has caused our ongoing recession. The DNC platform of higher taxes will most assuredly drive MORE money and talent desperately needed for our continued recovery overseas. I will therefore, albeit somewhat reluctantly, vote for Trump. I want OFF this Hellbound Train, and it is apparent to me that we now find ourselves in yet another situation of "No Risk - No Gain". So, follow your heart, your conscience, and your best sensibilities. I would fight for your right to do so. In conclusion, I Wish The Best of Luck to You All, and Especially to Our Nation - where, no doubt, no matter Who Wins, one of the largest political movements in History will begin November 9th... when I will stand With You in the Spirit of Working Both Sides of the Aisle for the Work yet to be Done.

15 | Suzy Abrams | 6 | 10154051945450950_10154052039715950 | Imagine it is November 9, 2016 in America and we wake up knowing who our new President will be. If it is Hillary, think of the groups of people that will celebrate. Illegal Immigrants, criminals and future criminals who will be supported for pulling a gun on a police officer, planned parenthood, the media, and the list goes on and on that represent everything that is wrong with America. If you're still "with her," look around at who you'll be celebrating with. Now imagine waking up knowing that Trump is our new President. You may or may not like him, or really know what kind of president he will be. But here are some things you will know for sure:• The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.• The media has been neutered forever.• Career politicians will have lost all job security.• The guns in your home will safely stay there.• Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.• Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally• Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.• No more apologies to the world for being great!• Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.• Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.• There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.• The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.• The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.Copy and paste this as your status if you support and will vote Donald Trump for president 2016.

Who ever wins it, will have detrimental affects on this nation and its people. Could be progressive or set us back years...  such an important election. I'm with you Joe! Preach! 🙌
19 | Robin Perez | 4 | 10154051945450950_10154052000070950 | Why I’m Voting for Donald Trump in 2016For some young people going through this election cycle, including first-time voters, this last month before the elections is really a crazy one. Accusations flying back and forth, unlikable candidates on both sides, shifting loyalties among the party faithful, and a confused and tired populace throughout the country. So it’s important to find a way to quiet all the noise and think about what really matters. When you do, the choice becomes very clear. After doing this recently, I have decided to vote for Donald Trump. Here’s why.No one disagrees that these two candidates have questionable pasts; many feel that they are quite unlikable, even those in their own parties. And the feeling that voters are taking to the polls this year is that while they don’t agree with everything their candidate says or does, it seems to them that they are voting for “the lesser of two evils.” That’s totally understandable. But here’s another reason to consider your candidate, and why this year Trump has won my vote.I recently heard Dobson say that God puts people in critical roles and places at precisely the right time that they’re needed. And some time these folks are the not the most desirable, or likable, or proven people around – but somehow they get the job done. Three folks come to mind that illustrate this point.Moses was a shepherd who had killed a man when he was younger, and was doubtful he could lead anyone. Quite an unlikely “man of the hour.” But he ended up leading an entire people out of bondage and was one of the great leaders of his time.Winston Churchill was by all accounts a drunken buffoon who had made many bad calls in his life, was quite unlikable, and was not anyone’s first choice when it came to leading Great Britain. But when his country needed a leader most, he stepped up and reassured the British people, stiffened their resolve, and helped them withstand the Nazi threat and emerge victorious in WWII.In that same conflict, probably the most unlikable leader of all was General George Patton. He had a reputation for cursing, taking chances with his men’s lives, losing control of his temper, and showing off for the press. But General Eisenhower knew he was the man for the job in North Africa, and again in Europe when a breakout was most important. To this day he is regarded as one of America’s finest generals – the perfect person for the job, at exactly the right time.I don’t know what Trump will do in office if he is elected. But I do know what Hillary will do, based on her career history, her liberal politics and the way she treats those around her. And perhaps it’s just possible that Donald Trump - this very flawed, very controversial man – has been put in this position, at this specific time, to accomplish great things. Is it a risk? Sure, just as Churchill and Patton were potential risks. And these comparisons to those great men may not be valid; we’ll have to wait and see. But this man has a habit of getting things done, many times behind the scenes, usually ahead of schedule, and almost always under budget. That by itself would be a huge change in the way our country operates.We know what Hillary will do if she’s elected, and it is right for Americans to be concerned about the whittling away of their rights as Americans, and the acceleration of this process if she is elected. This issue, and the Supreme Court, are two HUGE reasons why it is more important than ever to not allow Hillary Clinton into the White House this November.Is Donald Trump a perfect candidate? Absolutely not. Is there a chance he could screw things up? Sure. But is it possible that he’s been placed in this position to do great things, improve this country’s standing in the world, get our economy back on track, and help turn back the progressive tide in this country that is threatening our way of life in America? It sure is. And that’s why he gets my vote.I’m willing to take a chance this November - one that may take you a bit out of your comfort zone. I hope you will do the same, and with hard work and a resolute optimism we will start to fix this country over the next 4-8 years. Over the last 8 years we were all promised Hope and Change and we have never been more divided. This is your chance to vote and get change that we have been waiting for.  If you feel the same way,  encourage them to really think about this election as a potential turning point for this country. Together, we CAN make a difference, and it starts with all of us doing the right thing for America.

24 | John Qualteria | 2 | 10154051945450950_10154052007070950 | I am so sick of the rhetoric. This is coming from a man who is supporting a candidate that will oversee a time where all women will be required to wear a burka in the Islamic States of America. If that is dignity, behead me now.

1 | Josh Harrell | 470 | 10154051865985950_10154051872875950 | Trump would be more of a champion for the working class than HRC could ever be. Hillary doesn't care about anyone but herself.
2 | Elaine St Onge | 310 | 10154051865985950_10154051882205950 | why isn't he in the white house doing his friggin job instead of spending more of our tax dollars flying around to campaign for a evil woman?? I know cause he wants more of the same and she said she would do it. more obamacare, more taxes, more illegals and syrian refugees, more open borders, more job loss, more freebies off the backs of the worker, more classified secrets out there for all to see, more of us protecting other countries but not our own, and the list goes on, well WE CAN NOT AFFORD CLINTON !! trump2016
3 | Patricia Pierron-Hebert | 177 | 10154051865985950_10154051876070950 | Did you miss the part where she lied to congress? You know that’s called perjury….Did you miss hearing about her being fired from the Watergate staff for being dishonest and unethical?How about those 33,000 emails she deleted and then had the computer wiped clean by professionals? Did you miss that?How about deleting emails after she was subpoenaed to hand them over to the Fed? You realize that’s Obstruction of Justice, right?And why did she destroy 13 devices with a hammer and acid-wash e-mails? Oh, and how about getting the rapist of a teenage girl off on rape charges then laughing about it? Did you miss that too?How about when she lied to the American people about Benghazi? You realize that story about the video was a lie, and she knew it was a lie, right?Did you miss her lying to the American people about her emails?How about when she lied about being under sniper fire?Well, then there was those times she lied about lying to the American people. Miss those too?What about that ‘pay for play’ with the Clinton Cash Foundation? That’s kind of hard to miss, huh?Did you miss all those other scandals she was in? You know… TravelGate, FileGate, WhiteWater, Rose law Firm, Vince Foster… she has a long list of scandals, you know...Did you miss her belittling her husband's sexual harassment ( and rape ) accusers? Oh – but the Paula Jones case was settled for $850,000 and Bill was impeached… for lying…AND THEN, there’s the case of his illegitimate son, Danny Williams-Clinton, a son he made while keeping a black prostitute on retainer while he was still in Arkansas? You know she was labeled "Extremely careless" about national security by the FBI, right?And don’t you know there is evidence now that she cheated with the debates by getting questions ahead of time? Have you caught her latest lies about not knowing what the (C) meant on the classified documents? Or, that she can’t remember any briefings on how to handle classified material?Did you know that during her interview with the FBI she said she couldn’t remember 39 times?Did you know that during the Star Investigation she used that same defense of ‘I don’t recall’ 56 times?Did you hear her say she will raise taxes on the middle class? Did you know she had to return stolen items from the White House the last time they left?Did you miss the fact that her and Bill Clinton stole 6 Billion Dollars that was meant to rebuild Haiti?Have you seen the movies and several documentaries made about her questionable ethics?Don’t you wonder why she made congress and others spend millions and millions of tax dollars having hearings and investigating her numerous times, finding that she lied, that would not have been spent if she would have simply told the truth in the first place ! Facts - all facts !Don’t you wonder about all the illegal stuff she’s done that we don’t know?.......yet?  But you are going to vote for her because.... she's a woman or you don't like Donald Trump? Now, That is Insane! Hillary Clinton has a lot more to hide than Donald Trump does!

5 | Ed Bailey | 93 | 10154051865985950_10154051892855950 | Good grief! He should be doing HIS job, not campaigning for that witch. She won't be for the working people. She will be for special interests,and her Foundation. Democrats are nott for everyday Americans. They want control, and globalization. They are dangerous to our country.
6 | John Perkins | 50 | 10154051865985950_10154051900080950 | Another completely worthless new station.. CBS, NBC, ABC, CNN, MSNBC= Government ran media. You guys are not reporting the news. You are the news!

8 | Gayla Taylor | 61 | 10154051865985950_10154051881230950 | She's only a "champion of people" because her campaign gave her that line. They said in their email exchange that she "hates average Americans"
9 | Kevin Stanfield | 50 | 10154051865985950_10154051895165950 | LOL, you are so funny. You force the working class to spend money they do not have, destroyed more company's and jobs! We are done with all of you in Washington DC!
10 | Larry Hamilton | 24 | 10154051865985950_10154051882030950 | Really think you could be doing something else then campaigning for her on our dollars but hell who am i just a tax paying citizen right.
11 | Gordon Taylor | 22 | 10154051865985950_10154051892775950 | CBS, you lost all credibility when you met secretly with the Clinton campaign. Walter Cronkite would be ashamed of what you've become.
12 | Tammy Lynn Andrews | 7 | 10154051865985950_886705111430728 | I like how you judge the man. Trump is more qualified than you were when you initially ran. I voted for you I've been a democrat all my life because my parents made me but I'd really paid attention to politics now that I'm older and I'm voting for Trump. I don't like how you know Hillary lied and your covering it up and protecting her because you want your legacy to go on. Clinton family is corrupt and if we're a nation of immigrants were not immigrants that want to kill people like the ones you're going to bring over here
13 | Byron Wallace | 19 | 10154051865985950_10154051881755950 | Hillary Clinton donors own her, she is only loyal to them...it is not our interest she will prioritize it is the donors. She is paid for already
14 | Alyson Maio Federico | 13 | 10154051865985950_10154051924570950 | Trump has employed more people as a private sector business man than Obama has done as president over the past 8 years. He's a disgrace! Have a look at unemployment among blacks and black youth! Way to go Obama...you failed the black people you promised the world too. And all they got was a lousy phone!
15 | Brenda Gittemeier | 16 | 10154051865985950_10154051935450950 | Obama-- just 8 years ago you were quoted saying, "Hillary will say anything and change nothing. Hillary can't be trusted and isn't qualified to be President". It appears now your legacy is more important than the fate of our country.
16 | Jason Smith | 11 | 10154051865985950_10154051916680950 | The gap between Wall Street and mainstream widened under Obama. "But the dow jones is at record highs!" Great, so is the number of people on food stamps, and the number of people who have left the workforce, as well as the national debt.There's no reason to think that this will change under Clinton.
17 | Jessica Esteban | 12 | 10154051865985950_10154051925230950 | "Ultimately, I campaigned on changing Washington and bottom-up politics," Obama said. "And I don't want to send a message to the American people that there are two sets of standards -- one for powerful people and one for ordinary folks who are working every day and paying their taxes." Obama's 2009 interview with CNNSo after all the email released. Why is he still campaiging for Hillary?
18 | Judy Barger Sandbach | 13 | 10154051865985950_10154051905920950 | Yeah, and you're a champion of the working people Obama? You Mr. Man, won't be paying these hideous premium increases of YOUR ACA disaster!! That whole Iran deal and all that money you sent them under the cover of night proves how much of a "champion" you are! Go the hell away and please take your forked tongue devil (HRC) with you!
19 | Diane L. Sullivan | 8 | 10154051865985950_10154051951140950 | if my memory serves me right, in 2008 when he was first running for President he was telling all America that Hilliary was a liar and a crook and don't vote for her now he's singing a different tune. You all are a bunch of liars and crooks!!!
20 | Scott Fleming | 4 | 10154051865985950_725261947637781 | No sitting President in our history has ever campaigned for a presidential nominee. Most presidents have more important things to do. Just shows how much he cares for our country and the ppl in it. He knows when Trump wins he's going down along with Hillary Rotten Clinton
21 | JoAnn Smith | 3 | 10154051865985950_10154051989255950 | This lying piece of crap only knows himself and so why not make up stories and lies about someone else I never voted for this lying creep and never ever would have he lied at day one then other so called idiots voted him back in tells you they didn't have a care in the world or they were higher than a kite
22 | Drew Weise | 1 | 10154051865985950_10154051943320950 | Fiscally liberal agendas will lead to a welfare state. Socially conservative agendas will lead to divisions among people and hate between different groups. I'm sticking with the party that is fiscally conservative and socially tolerant. Hopefully after the election, the millions of Republicans who disavow the party but still wants some fiscal responsibility and at the same time can handle having neighbors with different social values will join the libertarians
23 | Jennifer Scheu | 0 | 10154051865985950_725296614300981 | Really? lol Oh well if Obama said so it must be true....what a bunch of crap. THis coming from the worst Potus in history who has created a lawless divided nation, lied to our faces and then lied about lying, and then uses our tax money to campaign for the biggest fraud of them all.
24 | Kay Leeman Dickson | 0 | 10154051865985950_725277827636193 | For sure drumpf is unfit unqualified untrustworthy unkind unreliable and much more. Thanks be yo President Obama for his message of hope for our already great country!!!  ❤️👍❤️👍❤️👍vote blue up down ticket
25 | James Tinsley | 5 | 10154051865985950_10154051919980950 | Obama and Hillary are not champions for working people in the private sector. They never have been. They are career under-achievers in the public/government sector. Hillary has ZERO accomplishments with her 30 year history of incompetence!

"We are a nation of immigrants and I am proud of it," said Clinton on immigration. This is how her administration would handle the issue.

1 | Alexandria Hill-Weikart | 182 | 10154051815710950_10154051829580950 | My vent for the day.... I get $112 too much a month to get Irelyn disability.... this is fucking bullshit! Her dad and I both work and pay our fucking taxes, which he pays like $20k a year in ss tax, and our daughter can't get it but these fucking refugees can get it! And they never worked a day in their fucking lives! So my daughter that has a real diagnose disability , she's not sitting on her fucking ass all day collecting welfare has to go without!!!! A child with disabilities is very expensive, to get her everything she needs cost an arm and leg, Remember this when you are voting! We can't  take care of the American people that are truly disabled, but we can give all these refugees and lazy as fucks free shit!!! This is fucked up! The average  family of five on welfare gets over $120k of free food, healthcare, social security, free housing, free utilities and money!! Than me a single mom of four can't bring in more than 2400 a month! FYI, Irelyns appts are $150 a pop 4x a week! That's 2400 a month!!! Almost All my income to just her appts!!!! How can we eat, live under a roof, or drive her there?!!!! Fuck all you people voting for Hillary! De friend yourself now, you are supporting families like me to go without, for illegals and refugees that never contributed to anything to this fucking country! These programs are tax dollar funded! They are supposed to be a hand up, not a hand out! I paid my share, and I work, and going to school to be a nurse to help those in need! God forbid I receive child support, the money doesn't cover everything! A blanket for my daughter alone was $300! I'm having a shitty day, and fuck you Hillary supporters!!!! She can use her foundation to support these refugees, oh wait it's not a charity foundation, it's a way to not be taxed and pay for expensive wedding for her daughter, to arm fucking Isis, to pay and play shit, for lawyers because she's fucking breaking the law every day....
2 | Ed Bailey | 105 | 10154051815710950_10154051838130950 | They need to come LEGALLY. The illegal ones need to be punished, at the very least, with a heavy fine. The border needs to be secure. I doubt this witch will do that. #BuildTheWall #Trump2016

4 | Pat Dillon | 51 | 10154051815710950_10154051830465950 | For the love of God, please shut up with the meaningless platitude, we are a nation of immigrants. Surely people are not that stupid to think this means we should be flooded with illegals. Is it not obvious to everybody that immigration is how democrats intend to gain permanent political power.? Are we really that stupid as a nation to not see this?? Or have people been so conditioned by the American public education system to hate republicans and conservatives, that they don't care how it gets done; just do it.
5 | David Richter | 21 | 10154051815710950_10154051882330950 | A nation of immigrants yes...but there are rules and laws for immigration that need to be followed. As for a path to citizenship, we have that, starting with a green card and through the process. The stupid thing is neither candidate seems to be focused on enforcing laws already in place same as with guns and other issues. Stop all the BS and just do what the law says.
6 | Angela Conti | 24 | 10154051815710950_10154051834710950 | What the hell kinda fuckery is this???? Illegal immigrants, open borders??? Ok anyone that votes her in is financially responsible. And if anyone gets killed in any attack...whoever, they are...for each one, deport a Hillary voter

13 | Scottie Belue | 8 | 10154051815710950_10154051875810950 | So taking care of illegal immigrants is priority over Americans, American Vets, American families, America's children, America's elderly, me, you and everybody else here right now, who does not know what tomorrow holds other than we realize we are not top priority on Hillary's list...

15 | Kelly Warner | 4 | 10154051815710950_10154051951980950 | She wants to bring in thousands and thousands of illegal immigrants and put them on the welfare system with our tax dollars when we have thousands of homeless veterans and homeless families on the streets. We need to take care of our own first before we can bring in new immigrants that haven't been properly vetted first of all.
16 | Toni Z Klosse | 5 | 10154051815710950_10154051876515950 | The system IS rigged, not by actual individual votes, but by Media.  Remember this is Hillary, not Tea Leone playing Madam Secretary. Even shows like The Simpsons lean toward Hillary. The writers, networks, newscasters, etc, are swaying us toward a Hillary vote . This is how the election is rigged.  Of course, who do you think all the immigrants she and Obama let in plus the illegals are going to vote for!  Yes, Rigged!
17 | Cammie Nguyen | 2 | 10154051815710950_10154051912780950 | Taking a compassionate stance on immigration does not mean we are opening the doors to everyone. There are still procedures and regulations. But it's only HUMANE to help others in need. Especially when we are the richest, most powerful nation in the world. With power comes responsibility. Should we not be flattered that everyone wants to come to America to secure a better future for themselves and their families? Why? Because  America is the place you can do just that. So instead of pushing people away, let's embrace and work together.
18 | Debbie Lynch | 0 | 10154051815710950_10154052628465950 | What happened to coming to this country legally. You are rewarding people for coming into this county illegally. These illegals need to be deported just like other countries do. God help us if we have open boarders the states that are closest to the Mexico boarder are going to suffer the influx of all these people. What happened to there being rules. I am of Mexican decent and this is my opinion. My parents believed you come here you go by the rules you speak English and acclimate to the culture.
19 | Patty McDaniel | 0 | 10154051815710950_10154052404355950 | Well in reality we really are a nation of immigrants. Let's not twist her words just to make a headline.  It's not like she is saying just let people come in without doing the proper work but something does have to be done to allow people who are decent, hard working immigrants to come here if they choose. For anyone who has ever tried to become a citizen and do it the right way they know the cost is thousands of dollars. There is no reason for that. I know of one person who spent 10 thousand dollars to become a legalized citizen. I'm not saying we should allow people to just come in without there being some skin in the game (so to speak) on their part but it shouldn't be so expensive to do so. These people who are trying to come here are trying to get away from some really horrible situations and they didn't ask to be born in those conditions. Yes, have them do what they need to do but don't make it where it seems like an impossible task which is why so many do not even try and do it the right way. It's not that they don't want to just many do not have thousands upon thousands of dollars to do so.
20 | JJ Janczak | 1 | 10154051815710950_10154052104570950 | Hah, sure, Her 25million immigrants have taken and will take more of our jobs, promotions, housing, benefits, scholarships, etc. while Hillary rakes in the $$$$$$$$$$$$$$ at our expense. A vote for her is a vote for losing your future.
21 | Gloria Somers | 0 | 10154051815710950_10154052094410950 | People who's lives at risk in there own countries come to our countries to have and make a b better life back in the day white American men brought b lack men n women over to countries to b be slaves remember your ancestors and the way your people lived and have feelings a nd a good heart because your people fought for freedom hope love and a, way of life so it's not colour b but jealousy n greed b hate

24 | Kristy Glasgow | 1 | 10154051815710950_10154052008825950 | Yes but it is the same immigrants who made the constitution. They didn't want people that did not respect our constitution and our flag to stomp all over it. That's what we have, a whole bunch of America hating spiteful illegal immigrants. If you don't love my country like I do and respect the culture that you are trying to integrate into then you have no use to America. We don't need any more people on welfare, move along.

5 | Joshua Shultz | 50 | 10154051662635950_10154051681495950 | For those who believe the mere accusation of sexual assault means a man is a sexual predator, Bill Clinton has a very long list of women who have accused him of sexual assault. Therefore, a serial sexual assaulter will be in the White House, whether one votes for Clinton or Trump (based on the logic of these people's reasoning).

So I can make more millions by being a criminal and not going to jail because I'm above the laws. I wish I did this sooner so I didn't spend years of my life serving my country. I could have been a wimp and let others die for me. While I allow idiots to step on my flag and kneel when my country's anthem is played. If I cannot defend my democrat buddies because they lie and cheat the American people. All I have to do is say we are racist, bigots, deplorables just because they have no facts.

10 | Pat Winstead | 17 | 10154051662635950_10154051692055950 | Are we beginning to get the idea that perhaps calling the spouse of a sitting President the nation's 'First Lady' was patronizing?  Perhaps we should call them the President's wife or husband and leave it at that.
11 | Margaret Martin | 17 | 10154051662635950_10154051721180950 | I think when they enter a room together they will be announced as " The Presidents, Hillary and Bill Clinton. When it is a formal occasion, I think it could also be "Ladies and Gentlemen The President, Hillary Clinton, and the former President, Bill Clinton". Once you are President, you are always referred to as "Mr. President". She will probably be addressed as "Madam President".

14 | Trina Donato Marta | 3 | 10154051662635950_540725292803878 | When addressing a former President of the United States in a formal setting, the correct form is “Mr. LastName.” (“President LastName” or “Mr. President” are terms reserved for the current head of state.) This is true for other ex-officials, as well.When talking about the person to a third party, on the other hand, it’s appropriate to say, “former President LastName.”

16 | Klaus Reck | 14 | 10154051662635950_540726709470403 | If you are Gay or lesbian, why would you want to vote for Hillary, when she gets millions from countries that will execute or in prison gays & lesbians?If you are Black, why are you voting for Hillary when she defends Planned Parenthood and admires Margaret Sanger, who wanted to abort as many black babies as possible and exterminate the black race, and Margaret Sanger said blacks are “morons,” “idiots,” “imbeciles,” “human weeds,” and “misfits.” Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.If you are a Woman, how can you vote for Hillary when she has buried all of Bill's rape victims under the rug. As an attorney, Hillary also defended the rapist of a 12-year old girl and laughed about it later. She plays the woman-card and acts entitled; implying that she deserves your vote merely because of her sex. How is that gender neutral?If you are a Miner, Steelworker or have a Factory job, why are you voting for Hillary when she supported NAFTA and TPP, and workers are being laid off because jobs are going overseas? She also welcomes open borders and illegals to get benefits with your tax money and compete for our jobs. Hillary boasts that under her administration miners and steelworkers will lose their jobs.If you are a Law abiding citizen, how can you vote for Hillary when she is clearly above the law? Hillary deleted thousands of secret e-mails *after* they had been subpoenaed by the courts (illegal). Hillary kept thousands of classified and top secret e-mails on her private server; servers that had less security that g-mail and Hotmail. You can be sure Russia, Iran, and China have those now. The DNC clearly broke the rules by heavy-handedly favoring Hillary over Sanders while they were still competing for the nomination.If you are a Veteran, in the military, or closely related to a military member, why are you voting for Hillary when she left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again? They called for help, but the help was told to stand down. Furthermore, Hillary wants to eliminate the NRA, take away your guns, and abolish the second amendment?Go Trump

I know you're giving up your time with your own family to care about Us! Thank you for sending help, though you didn't have to, to those of Us who are displaced due to Natural Disasters! Thank you for shaking our hands. Thank you for hugging our children. Thank you for Caring about the future of our Grandchildren! Thank you for Loving our Country!

2 | Brenda Davidson | 29 | 10154051614130950_10154051633720950 | Trump is a hateful ignorant person. Doesn't he have anything valuable to say  the eve of the election? Or to just throw off on his opponent?

5 | Maria Perez | 10 | 10154051614130950_10154051661800950 | I'm all about live and let live. But this is getting crazy! For example, I have a friend who gets about $800 a month in social security. Her spouse can't work at this time, and his monthly insurance premium is jumping from @ $230 per month to about $750 per month. If she didn't take on a part time job, that would leave them with less than $50 a month to live on. So while the wealthy celebrities are stumping for Clinton, and the people on subsidized health care are voting for Clinton, the people who have worked all of their lives, and those of us in the middle class are getting screwed. I've seen people's names changed because they bought a new social security card illegally, I've been to the richest cities in the country with people sleeping on the sidewalks, I've been called racist because I don't agree with this administration, I've seen towers fall, and I've seen my hometown county turn into the 2nd most affected by meth and heroin in NY state, (of which Clinton was a Senator). I've watched videos of Clinton saying she was against gay marriage, that she was for a border wall, called young black men "super predators" and her outright lies about a little place called Benghazi. As I've said before, I don't know if Trump is the answer, but this woman, with all of the opportunity she has had to affect change, is definitely not the answer. She walked into Washington 40 plus years ago with the sole purpose to gain the Presidency. It's been about her the entire time. Kicked off the Watergate case for taking home documents, lying under oath, and the most recent admission of accepting an unreported gift of 1 million dollars from a foreign nation (that which you need to report). They left Haiti, still in ruins. This woman can't even wear an American flag pin, as to not offend her foreign counterparts. This is not the America my ancestors came here for. Scared to speak your mind, less control over your children's upbringing, and a new database with your private healthcare information going straight to the government. All true. All evidence based in fact. When Tuesday is over, one way or another it's gonna be scary. I just hope. I don't know what I hope. But I'm gonna have a back up plan.Trump 2016
6 | Nick Montgomery | 2 | 10154051614130950_10154051679320950 | Now I don't remember which president it was but a protester threw a head of lettuce at him which he caught. (The lettuce was an insult because it was said that his face and head looked like a lettuce) Rather than being angry, he held it and laughed at it, made jokes about his head and finished his speech. He would later win the presidency. I really want to say Taft but it could be someone like Cleveland or Arthur.

So I can make more millions by being a criminal and not going to jail because I'm above the laws. I wish I did this sooner so I didn't spend years of my life serving my country. I could have been a wimp and let others die for me. While I allow idiots to step on my flag and kneel when my country's anthem is played. If I cannot defend my democrat buddies because they lie and cheat the American people. All I have to do is say we are racist, bigots, deplorables just because they have no facts. Thank you for having me see the light!!!

If you vote for this pedophile, you have really gone to the dark side."The complaint alleges billionaire convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein had a woman pickup teenage girls for his famous parties. One of these girls was “Jane.” Another witness, “Tiffany,” who also provided an affidavit in the lawsuit, said she witnessed Trump and Epstein rape the plaintiff several times.

But all they do is try and tie anyone around Trump with all kinds of crap!  How many want their daughters listening to Jay Z, or watching Beyonce shake her ass?

She is nothing but lies and evil. I learned more about Trump and he is actually a really nice guy, I was told it is like when an actor has a role he has to play, he is just playing his tough role, but when he is with people and family he very nice. He says thank you more than anyone I have ever heard. He truly does care about the direction our country has been going since Obama, and it isn't in a good way, and he wants to turn it around. With her, we are getting another 4 years of Obama and worse. And if you vote for anyone else, it is a vote for her. So, if you don't want Hillary, choose Trump, or we will get Hillary.

2 | Mary E. Wilnot | 37 | 10154051577535950_10154051585845950 | Hey half wits posing as media- both parties have poll watchers. This is normal practice and has been happening for years.
3 | Matt Anderson | 32 | 10154051577535950_10154051589775950 | Pretty sad when one candidate for President can make all of us feel threatened to not vote for him. When was the last time you were afraid to walk out of a polling station, America? Because it's here.
4 | Kat Phillips | 8 | 10154051577535950_10154051674420950 | This article  is about the DOJ wanting to ensure that citizens will feel safe when exercising their right to vote. There have already been intimidation incidents against voters. That is unAmerican and a Federal crime.

All transgenders, all Gay individuals, and all religious folds, even some Muslim's. You better think twice at that voting booth or this will be your future but on a much larger scale with Hillary Clinton. Terrorists don's assimilate, they Jihad, because you are an infidel to them.

So if I vote, will Immigration know where I live? Will they come for my family and deport us?” - Gina Rodriguez“Not true, and the reason is, first of all, when you vote, you are a citizen yourself.

2 | Bryan Corni | 240 | 10154051448775950_10154051452145950 | Let's not be politically correct. She was not a 'model'. She was a soft porn model.
3 | Gary M Malone | 145 | 10154051448775950_10154051511750950 | Interesting that Trump married a woman who's work visa expired, became an illegal alien, and then was allowed to stay and become a U.S. citizen after marrying Trump. So much disgusting hypocrisy from Trump and his racist deplorable supporters....

7 | Christine Bergeron Rogowski | 36 | 10154051448775950_10154051630725950 | Yeah...she's basically half a step away from being a porn star, broke our laws by working illegally when she first came to the US, she married the most disgusting piece of shit womanizing man pig she could find because he is rich and she is a gold digger. If he was poor she would divorce him in a hot minute.

13 | Madeline Ivette Arroyo | 2 | 10154051448775950_10154051594450950 | Michael Wildes, has indicated that she first entered the United States on a business visitor visa in August 1996. She obtained an H-1B visa in October 1996. After that, she regularly returned to Slovenia to obtain a series of four more one-year work visas because, at the time, one-year visas were all that were permitted under the U.S. agreement with Slovenia. She obtained a green card and became a lawful permanent resident in 2001, applying as a model of “extraordinary ability”. She obtained U.S. citizenship in 2006, the year after her marriage.[

The only difference between their crimes are where one is a professional liar with years of corruption under her belt and the other is a corrupt non, pig politician. You can't lay blame on one and not the other!
16 | Christal Elerick-Miller | 4 | 10154051448775950_10154051745225950 | She has also done great volunteer work in New York but of course that's one slide versus all her other endeavors. Now let look at Bill as the first MR. Raped a woman assaulted a woman disgraced the Oval Office. Impeached. Took money in pay to play schemes. And the list goes on
17 | Cindy Widener Lester | 2 | 10154051448775950_10154052230340950 | The Donald's father in law is a communist, so I'm sure the apple doesn't fall far from the tree! Also to say she is fluent in English is absurd, for someone who's been in the US now for 20 years now her English is a joke .

20 | Debbie Smith | 2 | 10154051448775950_10154051621880950 | Porn star model, illegal not illegal who cares she would be a darn better "first" lady rather than Bill.Clinton.Wonder if Hillery  wins what kinds dress he will wear and what ugly pants suit she will wear!!!Haha got to have some humor in these dark times!!!! Will be so darn glad when this smear campaign is over.
21 | Eric Murray | 4 | 10154051448775950_10154051672345950 | Where is crash course on Hillary's spouse? Oh wait you don't want people to know that lol. A successful immigrant, oh no what a sin. All while democrats are saying to love immigrants. As long as they vote blue.
22 | Joe Zayco | 0 | 10154051448775950_10154051752945950 | If Trump wins she'll be the hottest first lady we ever had that even the portraits of past presidents will acknowledge but if Hillary wins then all the portraits of past presidents except Sleek Willy's off course will all be shaking their heads and saying "Shit the bitch is back".
23 | Karen Rodriguez | 0 | 10154051448775950_10154051672980950 | Too sad to see only attack comments on both sides... what about proposals? If you try to vote for the least worse, that's one very unpromising government that you are routing for. P.S. Please insert the links of official sources that support the info that you're posting otherwise you are just babbling as well
24 | Taise Silveira | 0 | 10154051448775950_10154052199485950 | When I read "she´s a lot more than just a former model" I thought I would read a list of her accomplishments. It turns out that I saw none because being an entrepreneur with the Donald´s money is easy.
25 | Marie Lucas | 6 | 10154051448775950_10154051745835950 | Even though she was naked groping women it's modeling. What was she modeling skin. Can you Imagine children having to do research papers on her with pictures .

1 | Laurie Parry | 38 | 10154051385585950_10154051421500950 | :-p Why doesn't the GOP actually DO the jobs they were elected to do, instead of wasting our tax dollars on baloney like emails ?   The only thing the Republican-majority Congress has done, is SEQUESTRATION -- cutting veterans benefits, etc... that is no reason to re-elect any Republican to Congress
2 | Rick Ustler | 30 | 10154051385585950_10154051408595950 | Sure it beats doing what you were sent to Washington to do. Looks like another four years of stagnant movement in Washington, thanks to the Republican swamp, Time to elect Democrats and to get Washington working for you, rather than wasting taxes. Vote for democrats across the board, and end obstructive partisan politics.
3 | Lisa Franklin | 0 | 10154051385585950_10154051653750950 | Bernie or Bust People, If you strongly feel Bernie was robbed of electoral votes at the DNC and he could absolutely beat Trump in a landslide, then write his name. Check your states website for eligible write in candidates and you should find Bernie's name if he had enough voters to nominate him. IF Trumpleforeskin wins due to all the divided votes, DON'T SAY SHIT. Women protect your pussies and Black people be prepared to fight racist who push you back to the 1800's by freely calling you nigger.
4 | Stephanie Rohr Turner | 3 | 10154051385585950_10154051481875950 | And I believe they will continue it for the next 4 years. It's over. It was a mistake. She admitted it. It's over. And what gets me is that so many before her did the same thing. But knowing she was running for office they had to have something.  And after 4 years of keeping anything from getting done they will once again say that nothing got done just like they have done to Obama.
5 | Katie Roberts | 1 | 10154051385585950_10154051632620950 | Problem is everyone is afraid of retaliation. If the investigation needs to continue, then she shouldn't be eligible to run for President. If it was anyone else, they would have been forced to revoke campaigning already. How can anyone vote for her to become the President of our country? This will be a disgrace to the United States if this woman is the first woman to become President.

13 | Teresa Mac | 0 | 10154051385585950_10154052108175950 | Yeah, let's concentrate on and spend all of our money on THAT, instead of reining in the pharmaceutical companies and other healthcare costs, improving the ACA, working to stop the Pentagon from bankrupting our soldiers who have to repay their signup bonuses (which you were warned about years ago & ignored), improving the VA, passing an Equal Pay bill that actually guarantees equal pay for equal work or any of the other million issues that can be addressed.  Instead, you obstruct progress in our country and leave for vacation 2 days early instead of working to fund a Zika bill, as the Democrats wanted to do.  I want my tax dollars back that paid for the Republicans extra 2 days of vacation, Chaffetz.  That's $3080 per Republican who left early.

15 | Alan Elnick | 0 | 10154051385585950_10154051436875950 | States of PlayWashington State may be among the more interesting watches tomorrow evening as the election results come in. Bernie Sanders won the Democratic Primary with over 70% of the vote Trump won the Republican Primary with over 75% of the vote. Two Democratic electors have announced they will not give Hillary Clinton their electoral vote should she win the state, this despite a $1,000. fine for not voting the popular will. Of course in Seattle, Everett to be more precise, is Boeing, the largest private employer in the state. Boeing's chief competition is Airbus in Europe. Subsidies to Airbus in Europe, particularly nearly interest free loans, and payback terms timed to actual delivery of product (if payback is even required), has put Boeing at a competitive disadvantage. Despite efforts to file for an even playing field at the World Trade Organization, effectively, no response has been obtained. Boeing, while a proponent of International Trade, wants Fair Trade, sound familiar? If the Democratic firewall is broken in Seattle, the state is Republican.Minnesota, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin are all in play. The great fallacy of all the pundits' arguments we keep hearing on all stations, is that the Democratic turnout will be high. They tend to record that in Hillary's pocket. In these states particularly, If Democrats vote in numbers, not much greater than 70% will vote for Hillary Clinton. The rest will either simply vote down ticket or for Trump. These are the Blue Dog states. Republicans will vote in excess of 90% for the Republican nominee. African American turnout will likely be much less than 2012, and the best Hillary can count on from African Americans is 70%, they are very lukewarm towards her.Tomorrow night should be more interesting from what we have not been told, than from the pablum the MSM has been feeding us.
16 | Klaus Reck | 0 | 10154051385585950_10154051829905950 | If you are Gay or lesbian, why would you want to vote for Hillary, when she gets millions from countries that will execute or in prison gays & lesbians?If you are Black, why are you voting for Hillary when she defends Planned Parenthood and admires Margaret Sanger, who wanted to abort as many black babies as possible and exterminate the black race, and Margaret Sanger said blacks are “morons,” “idiots,” “imbeciles,” “human weeds,” and “misfits.” Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.If you are a Woman, how can you vote for Hillary when she has buried all of Bill's rape victims under the rug. As an attorney, Hillary also defended the rapist of a 12-year old girl and laughed about it later. She plays the woman-card and acts entitled; implying that she deserves your vote merely because of her sex. How is that gender neutral?If you are a Miner, Steelworker or have a Factory job, why are you voting for Hillary when she supported NAFTA and TPP, and workers are being laid off because jobs are going overseas? She also welcomes open borders and illegals to get benefits with your tax money and compete for our jobs. Hillary boasts that under her administration miners and steelworkers will lose their jobs.If you are a Law abiding citizen, how can you vote for Hillary when she is clearly above the law? Hillary deleted thousands of secret e-mails *after* they had been subpoenaed by the courts (illegal). Hillary kept thousands of classified and top secret e-mails on her private server; servers that had less security that g-mail and Hotmail. You can be sure Russia, Iran, and China have those now. The DNC clearly broke the rules by heavy-handedly favoring Hillary over Sanders while they were still competing for the nomination.If you are a Veteran, in the military, or closely related to a military member, why are you voting for Hillary when she left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again? They called for help, but the help was told to stand down. Furthermore, Hillary wants to eliminate the NRA, take away your guns, and abolish the second amendment?Go Trump
17 | Jacki Watkins | 6 | 10154051385585950_10154051398850950 | gotta keep beating that poor old dead horse...VOTE 'EM THE HELL OUT.  we have to take back the House and Senate, or this is all they will do for 4 years!!!

The emails were deleted from the server with care.....in fear that the FBI soon would be there.

Hillary will spend her whole term under investigation, she will likely face impeachment, and in the case she is imprisoned, Kaine is incompetent, just a yes man, and a spin doctor.

14 | Tony Piscitelli | 0 | 10154051322200950_10154052092215950 | I was asked today how I could ever support Trump after the comments he made over 11 years ago about women and if I would still support him if he made those comments to my daughter? My response was this....If he had put our nations security at risk, I would not vote for him. If his organization received large donations from countries that killed women and gays, I would not vote for him. If he boasted 30 Years of government experience, but still could not discern if an email was classified or not, without someone letting him know if it was or not, I would not vote for him. If he boasted about how he has defended children his entire life, but is for abortion, (even late term, when the child can feel pain) I would not vote for him. If he caused lives to be destroyed in Benghazi and then lied to the faces of the parents as they stood at their child's casket, I would not vote for him. If people who came against him mysteriously turned up dead, I would not vote for him. If he suddenly developed a southern accent when he was in the South, campaigning, I would not vote for him. If he continually broke the law and that was ignored, I would not vote for him, but right now, the ONLY person who does ALL these things is Hillary. Right now, the fact that Donald made these remarks over 12 years ago, does not move me. I'm bigger than those remarks and we all have said stupid things throughout our lives. To me, the fact that Hillary lies continuously, is a much bigger problem. We can see the effects of her lies by the state of our poor country right now...

There are poll watchers for Photo sign in and signatures are checked by both, etc. Rigging the machines and election is talking nonsense. It's the cowards fall back when he loses! No one party sees the machines as there are poll watchers from both!

18 | Ted Lapatka | 5 | 10154051322200950_10154051335365950 | Does anyone know or want to know how, and egotistical narcissist, Possibly Muslim President of The United States, (Barrack Hussein Obama) wanted to bring the end to the wars in The Middle East. He had a plan to bring Al-Qaida, Isis, Libya, Syria, Lebanon, Iran, and all supporting outside factors to the Peace Table. He waited, and waited, and waited, it everyone refused to even entertain such a foolish, never going to happen in a million years, shot in the dark.Thousands, upon thousands of American dead and wounded beyond believe. Possibly 10’ of thousands, to 100’s of thousand civilians dead or wounded beyond belief. Millions displaced refugees, sick old woman, children, sent out into the world without, food, water, shelter, and a slim chance in hell to survive. Only to be beheaded, castrated, buried alive, and tortured. All the while, the kings and queens of the world danced and partied with Champaign and caviar to the beat of a different drummer. Just like decades and upon decades before.Mr. President Truman, would not have let this happen. Mr. Roosevelt, would not have permitted this to happen, as well as Mr. President Eisenhower, or Mr. President Kennedy would both not have permitted this all to happen. So why does, Mr. Barrack Hussein Obama, and Mr. Impeached Mr. Bill (Blyth), (I did not have sexual relations with that woman) permit it to happen. As well as the G. Bush family permit it all to start happening all over again.This far East Asian part of the world has been in this same, turmoil for over centuries and not a single president, not less a Democratic one has ever figured it out! But The Clintons have with their, Pay to Play Foundation)! A political 3, 4, or even 5-decade savvy politician, can never figure it out, because they are just politicians, and their jobs would end if they did figure it out.Just remember, just about everyone in both houses, from the front door to the side doors and the back doors all have two things in common. A. They are mostly all lawyer. And B. They are mostly all lawyer.http://frankseldenlaw.com/lawyer_jokes/

They have broken laws, rigged elections, bought out the media & have taken over our government & made it more of a communist, dictatorship!!! I am heartbroken that so many people would rather stay ignorant to the truth and blindly follow Hilary and not read ONE DAMN EMAIL that was leaked!!! How can you love America & continue to support a woman who has sold our country out?!? HOW?!? This election has uncovered a lot of truth & so have these LEAKED EMAILS:: TRUTH that Hilary broke the law by having a server & having TOP SECRET, CLASSIFIED Information on her server; which she used BleachBit to wipe clean (not with a cloth!); Hilary had 13 devices (not one for convenience like she lied about) & confessed to smashing them with a hammer; she told the FBI that she didn't remember what Classified meant; that Hilary will LIE TO YOUR FACE while you bury your child that she helped kill in Benghazi; Hilary hates Catholics, Gays, Arabs, Bernie Supporters & blacks (those super predators); Obama made sure the FBI didn't indite Hilary & emailed her knowing she had a private email account-(proving he also broke the law & KNEW she was breaking the law!); had Bill Clinton secretly meet with the DOJ Loretta Lynch on the airport Tarmac which was NOT about discussing grandchildren for over 30 minutes; the State department tried to BRIBE the FBI to Declassify some of Hilary's emails; the DNC rigged the system & stole the election from Bernie; tried to ruin Trump with sexual allegations that couldn't be denounced and proven false in time before the election- KNOWING that such allegations would be harmful even though they were NOT TRUE & that she tried to destroy the women who made sexual assault allegations about her husband; the democrat party has set up people to fight at Trump rallies and to incite violence & have PAID THEM TO DO SO; Dead Democrats are voting & George Soros (who OWNS Hilary) is linked to voting machines in 16 states that have major electoral college counts; truth that Hillary can sell her position at SOS & give favors to other countries through the Clinton Foundation for millions of dollars: Hilary & Bill have sold out our country for MILLIONS of dollars to Countries that SHE KNEW WERE FUNDING ISIS!!!! AND NOW....We are seeing all over the Internet that when the NYPD obtained Anthony Weiner's laptop there were emails from Hillary & Huma stored on it, evidence of bribery, treason, & child sex trafficking! This has been "leaked" all over the web and if this proves true & you voted for this woman YOU will have played a part in nominating a evil beast to run your country!How in the hell can you support the continued corruption in our government?!? If Hilary wins there will be NOTHING nor No branch of government to stop her!!! She has already proven that!!! Please take off your Republican & Democrat hat & start thinking like an American!!!  Read the damn emails and stop swallowing the bullcrap the democrat party, Hilary & the main stream media are shoveling down your throats!!! Think like an American  & pick back up those "principles" that you gave up to support the corruption of these "Political Parties"!!! This is NOT about "right" versus "left"...this is about WRONG VERSUS RIGHT!!This country is on her knees, with her head bent down and Hilary is holding the killing sword!!!! For the love of God----WAKE UP!!!! It is TIME to clean up the CORRUPTION that has spread throughout our government like a cancer! WE are AMERICANS & WE will see JUSTICE SERVED!!!

Vote harvesting as well as harassing and incessant phone calls, texts, and flyers. Promising free stuff to the masses with no constitutional authority or financial solvency to get votes?

24 | Michael Larabell | 0 | 10154051270135950_10154051421575950 | Why I am voting for Donald Trump without mention Hillary. I challenge anyone supporting Hillary to do the same without mention Bill or Trump. 1. Stop the inflow of illegals coming over our boarders, putting a major strain on the cities, states and our country. We are already going broke. We can not afford to provide these people with food, shelter, schooling and medical care. 2. Stop the inflow of refugees that have not been screened. To much of a chance if ISIS or any other terrorist group to gain entry to our country. 3. Abolish and replace Obamacare. Millions of middle class families are forced to paying thousands of dollars for Obamacare and will never meet their yearly deductible, thus still having to pay out of pocket for all of their medical care. This is billions of dollars that could be spent growing our economy. 4. Trump owes nobody any favors in Washington. He is already filthy rich, so he does not have to accept donations from anybody including foreign countries in exchange for political favors. 5. He is not afraid to call anyone out if they are wrong regardless to what party they belong to. 6. Our companies are so over regulated that billions and billions of dollars are wasted trying to keep up and follow all of the executive orders that need to be over turned. 7. Bring our companies back home. We need to have it so companies can operate in this country without being over taxed. The jobs that will be created will pay more in taxes than what we will lose by lowering the cooperate tax rate putting more money to work growing our economy. 8. Renegotiate our trade agreements with other countries to make it more fair for American companies selling goods in other countries. 9. Bring law and order back to out country. Nobody is above the law regardless of who you are and who you know. 10. Secure funding for the schools and work training for the inner city communities.

Donald Trump has six paths to obtain the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency, his campaign manager explained.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Alan Cabrera | 214 | 10154051238085950_10154051241610950 | Donald Trump has no paths. He has no policies he has nothing. We need someone who can actually get something done and look for our well being. Stop and Frisk Donald Trump!!
2 | Laura Thaxton | 171 | 10154051238085950_10154051239875950 | Sorry Trump supporters but Trump won't win. Clinton is already at 275 electoral votes and Trump is at 188. And I'm sure you know you need 270 to win. And if that doesn't convince you look at it like this... Florida, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin are all leaning towards Hillary. And if she wins Florida alone she wins the presidency. And so far early voting puts Florida in Hillarys favor. And if by some chance Trump does win Florida he still wouldn't have enough to win the presidency. He'll need to turn at least 3 or 4 other states that are already blue or leaning blue his way. Which at this point is near impossible
3 | Dean Roger Miller | 103 | 10154051238085950_10154051256090950 | This woman is exactly what is wrong with our current political system. She is a paid professional who spins and lies about everything

5 | Bill McKetrick | 43 | 10154051238085950_10154051261430950 | I can't understand why any of the news networks continue to give this skank a platform for her bullshit, considering she's done nothing but lie and obfuscate since she became Trump's Campaign Director. Hopefully, after Clinton wins on Tuesday.....Conway will crawl back under whatever rock it is she crawled out from.......

I am embarrassed to be in the same species as TRUMP supporters.  Back to your deporable caves and rot!! TRUMP exposed and unmasked the bigotry behind the Republicans  for life.

" How is it Presidential to incite hatred, violence, fighting, and even murder: If any people have not figured out that Trump is a lying fraud by now... they are either complete morons or racists who just like his nasty attacks and feeling they have a voice. What a spoiled little baby brat...wah wah, everybody is cheating, picking on me, misleading, not playing fair...the whole system is rigged...HE IS PSYCHOTIC !!!

16 | Mark Flynn | 2 | 10154051238085950_10154051499495950 | Only one way only one path does he have to win this election and that's if by tomorrow he somehow builds a death star or some other doomsday device and holds the world to ransom. He's hanging in there alright. Come Wednesday that prospect that the world will finally be able to call him a loser will taste so sweet

19 | Cindy Fuller | 6 | 10154051238085950_10154051291745950 | Love the way the Hillary Supporters want to do nothing to educate themselves on their candidate. They blindly follow her lead by calling anyone that doesn't cow tow to her by horrible names. I asked early on in this race why I should vote for her. I also asked why I should vote for Trump. I asked that they give me solid evidence for their decision. I also asked that they not bash the other side. I truly was undecided and going to vote for a 3rd party. Guess what happened? Hillary supporters were vicious, name calling, and couldn't give me one good reason (except 1 man gave good answers without bashing). Trump supporters made very compelling and intelligent answers. Then I listened to the 3rd debate and when Hillary started talking about how okay it was to have an abortion just days before the due date and that she knew people that had to make this horrific decision with their family, I knew she was lying. If you have carried a baby that long and then your life becomes in jeopardy it will be in jeopardy whether you kill the baby before you deliver or give birth! That made me cry and I lost any respect or compassion I had for Her! Never would I vote for her!

I've waited to see if at any point you would report fairly and as of today, the day before Election Day you still are one sided. Therefore, you will never be on my TV again. You forever lost a viewer. Sadly, I was not even any specific party. I just don't feel a news station has the right to pick sides.
21 | Kathie Myles | 3 | 10154051238085950_10154051276295950 | This late in the game I doubt it he so stupid and you know what his campaign manager looks like all she does is an alcoholic and drugs no matter how much you dress her up she looks like a drug attic
22 | Avi Rubin | 1 | 10154051238085950_10154052286500950 | Do you masochists? Not enough for you 8 years black?You want a Muslim terrorist in the US?Obama caused enough damage to the US.We have to have a change, voted for Donald Trump for a better future.
23 | Brenda Dixon | 2 | 10154051238085950_10154051677190950 | Kellyanne is a Stepford wife hopped up on far too much Trump Kool Aid! Not only does she spin the Trump delusions, she appears to believe them! :/
24 | Keith Shisler | 0 | 10154051238085950_10154052474270950 | Yes, 6 paths. If Hillary quits, if every woman and african american and latino suddenly all die tonight, a miracle from heaven, the rapture happens tonight, if as he has repeatedly said the election is rigged (for him), and a mass alien abduction of all people capable of critical thinking that aren't dyed in the wool only vote republican no matter what people.
25 | Lisa Stuart | 1 | 10154051238085950_10154052104070950 | They are delusional 6 paths to nowhere. We don't need an arrogant in it for himself president,  he needs to take his own advice stop and frisk. If he does manage to win maybe he rigged the system all along.LOL

In the crucial Sunshine State battleground, many voters say they'll vote for Clinton in 2016, but against her in 2020.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Tom Belkowski | 54 | 10154051209865950_10154051231475950 | I've already voted for Clinton, and would still vote for her. But, I won't commit to 2020 until i see what she's accomplished and I know who else running. As far as Rubio is concerned. Not now. Not ever. Never!
2 | Donna Marie | 27 | 10154051209865950_10154051252170950 | I'm confused...We had this huge scandal about Clintons campaign inciting violence. The voter fraud going on-its in the Wikileaks emails and on video.Four men killed in Benghazi under her watch that she lied about. Clinton's emails on her own personal server deleted, bleach bit used and her devices trashed by hammers.She is in this election because she cheated out Bernie. It's been proven. Her Clinton Foundation has made over 2 billion dollars and only 10-15% of that has gone to those it was raised for and that is still under investigation.At the last debate she told the world our classified information regarding the timing of our nuclear response.She has accepted large amounts of money from middle eastern countries that kill gays and stone women for her campaign. She has had top 'you tubers' at huge events (some say they were paid) taking selfies with these young girls.These top you tubers have large followings.  Smart or illegal campaigning? She's dishonest-you decide.Her own Secret Service agents have said how much they hated that detail because she was so difficult to work with. She's a charmer!She claimed multiple times that she had to run for her life because her plane landed under SNIPER FIRE in Bosnia. That was debunked long ago but the fact remains that she's a liar. She has lied under oath and she gets her passes from our own FBI and The Justice Dept twice!Loretta Lynch had what she thought a private meeting on a jet with Bill Clinton in the middle of an airport while Hillary was still under investigation!This is less than half of what this woman has done.So surprising that she's still on the campaign trail and  not it in a courtroom being sentenced!So yes I'm confused..How can anyone still vote for her?
3 | Jj Hoffer | 18 | 10154051209865950_10154051249605950 | I just know this country can not withstand 4 more years of Obama which is what you will get voting for Hillary.I don't understand why people can not see the mess Obama made.People are all divided.Not good.
4 | Kevin Blankinship | 9 | 10154051209865950_10154051265190950 | And I see alot of retards voting for Killary and if she wins this election all I can say is R.I.P America . Because she don't give a shit about this country or the people in it.
5 | Peggy Ann Clark Clark | 11 | 10154051209865950_10154051281560950 | There are soo many here in FL that have voted & want nothing to do w/HC & her lies, corruption/bengazi.. We will not vote for a felon now or in 4 yrs....Who wants a criminal as PRES?
6 | Mandy Reynolds | 5 | 10154051209865950_10154051235170950 | Described as a 'FBI hiccup.'  This country is in horrible trouble. I know I made the right decision to not have children. God help your children and grandchildren. They are the ones who are going to pay dearly for your ignorance.
7 | Alex Mogo | 9 | 10154051209865950_10154051224185950 | Not enough bigot vote to win TRUMP bigots. Your kind will be rolled over with one swipe easily tomorrow . The landslide has started. I am embarrassed to be in the same species as TRUMP supporters.  Back to your deporable caves and rot!! TRUMP exposed and unmasked the bigotry behind the Republicans  for life. Now lets go win and kick as in 2018. Hillary will not stand and just take the punches , bring it on bitches.
8 | Melody Rabus | 1 | 10154051209865950_10154051241650950 | Why would anyone vote for Rubio? He already stated he hated his job and didn't show up for most of it but yes by all means vote him back in.
9 | Yvonne Clerebout | 11 | 10154051209865950_10154051213610950 | I get a chuckle out of the libtards thinking that the Hildebeast will win because the FBI closed one of the two cases they have her on. Trump voters outnumber the brain dead by millions. We got this! #spiritcooking #lolitaexpress #wikileaks #projectveritas #draintheswamp
10 | Melissa Jo Walker | 6 | 10154051209865950_10154051224685950 | Wikileak s emails out of the DNC reveal a plan to paint Donald Trump as a sexual predator with ties to Putin. None of these emails have been proven false. The liberal secular humanist mind is not tied to truth. The means justifies the ends. Hillary is the most corrupt candidate ever to run for office. The Clinton Foundation is in collusion with the Government for regime change and gun running operations and kick backs around the world. There is no rule of law in our Government right now, the media has worked with the CIA in the regime change propaganda operations. They cannot have Trump become president because he will bring down the entire machine. Even Obama used the server. Many people in our Government are guilty of felonies and treason.This election is about American nationalist patriots vs the NWO and their programmed. Which are you?The image of Trump is a media propaganda construct. In the Alinsky process what you are guilty of you place  on the enemy to try and keep the focus off of you. Hillary' s Ex secret service details believe she is a violent sociopath who will be a dictator. The Clinton Foundation is in collusion with many many aspects of the Government for regime change gun running and kick backs around the globe so many people are paid for or blackmailed..." One who fears corruption fears life."Alinsky Clinton's pen palTrump is a blue collar billionaire who due to his status was tempted on many levels. With all of the temptation I am surprised through all their digging they have not found much more. He is 70 years old. Those who accuse him of groping have no evidence. The one who accused him of rape has dropped her case. At around the same time Hillary was calling black children super-predators without empathy or conscience and talking about building a wall and having distain for illegal immigrants on street corners waiting for jobs that she said they should not be allowed to have. At the same time she was praising Senator Byrd a member of the KKK and Margaret Sanger who called for the extermination of the black race, calling Jews F...en jews, using the word nigger, calling mentally disabled children retards, being involved in scandal after scandal in which fall guys went to prison, left the country or died, Trump was...Receiving the New York Ellis island award for his dedication to ethnic causes, being praised by Jesse Jackson for his real estate donations and dedication to Jesse Jackson s Rainbow push program. At the same time Hillary was paying for access to all white country clubs he was suing the cronies in Palm Beach for not allowing blacks and Jews into their Clubs. Did Hillary ever speak out about blacks and Jews not being allowed into the Clubs she belonged to?Trump was sued over an apartment dispute that was racially motivated during a time the Government begin to push unfunded mandates on apartment owner to rent to minorities. It was around the same time section 8 was going to start up. Trumps dads apartments were made an example of along with many other owners in New York because of the size of the complex.Did he receive the Ellis island award before or after the apartment scandal?Did he receive the accolades From Jesse Jackson before or after the apartment scandal?Did he sue the cronies in Palm Beach before or after the apartment scandal?The media has created an all out war against Trump through dis honesty. Trump did not make fun of a disability that a reporter had. He has family members with disabilities. Trump mimicked someone who was caught in a lie and back peddling in a story. He has made the same movements over and over again to express different people lying and back peddling. The reporters condition is a paralysis of the hand. There is no movement. By definition Trump could not have mimicked the reporter unless he mimicked the static paralysis which he did not.Trump did not attack the Son of Gold Star parents. The DNC knew that Mr Kahn followed and was an expert on sharia law. Trumps response to Mr. Kahn and his wife was because Trump has people on his team who know the Muslim plan for sharia law in America. He was most likely very frustrated by what he saw knowing the plan behind it. Those who follow sharia have a goal of a world wide Caliphate.  Only in an Obama and Hillary world can a sharia following Muslim who makes money through the refugee program attack Trump by referring to the Constitution. Article 6 of the Constitution outlaws sharia law. What the media and Hillary and the DNC does is to count on the stupidity of the general public.In order to be a racist you have to fall under the definition of a racist not the contrived emotional response the media propaganda machine, the DNC, and Hillary want you to believe. Did Hillary think Trump was a racist before or after she went to his wedding? A racist believes his race is superior to all others.Trumps response to the judge hearing the Trump University case was not racist. The judge was pro open borders and illegal immigration and his wife is tied to the Clinton Foundation. This is a conflict of interest to one who wants legal immigration and wants to build a wall. It is illegal immigrants that hurts the job market of legal immigrants.When Trump referred to the Mexicans coming across the border, a percentage being rapist and murderers he did so in the context of illegal immigrants and sanctuary cities. Do you want the MS 13 EX military hit squads and drug runners to have a revolving door into America?In order to be misogynist you have to hate woman. Trump treats woman and men equally. His company has more woman in high level positions than most. Out of over 500 companies 6 have gone bankrupt during tumultuous times.  Rosie O'Donald attacked his family so Trump wearing his heart on his sleeve attacked her. He says what he thinks, sometimes tooo much. He does not have the contrived pathological liar thought process of Hillary or Obama. There is no evidence that Trump ever called Ms Machado Ms Piggy and even if he did it does not follow under the definition of misogynist. There is evidence that he argued with the board of the pageant and saved her job. Her history is terrible yet Hillary parades her around counting on the stupidity of the masses falling for the deception.  Hillary is parading this woman around counting on the stupidity and laziness of the public. Your own ego is your worst enemy that they will use against you. 11 years ago the blue collar billionaire trying to impress some so called friends said some stupid words about sexual conquests. I have heard that woman in locker rooms and strip clubs say pretty much the same about men. Trump apologised for what he said. Trump is a flawed man on a spiritual journey. I believe because of realizing what he is up against and the Christians he has surrounded himself with, this spiritual journey is leading him to great things.
11 | Rick Martinez | 0 | 10154051209865950_10154052183830950 | “No tyranny finds support without tapping into our fears this is key. Hence, all tyranny is terrorist. And when this terror — which was sown in the peripheries, with the massacres, looting, oppression and injustice — explodes in centers with different forms of violence, even hateful and cowardly attacks, citizens who still retain some rights are tempted to the false security of physical or social walls. Walls that enclose some and banish others. Walled citizens, terrified on one side, excluded, exiled, and still more terrified on the other. Is that the life that our Father God wants for their children?" Pope Francis
12 | David Throop | 0 | 10154051209865950_10154051258385950 | Will in 2016 but already saying they won't in 2020? That's an awful presumptive stance to take at this point. If she wins she could make an outstanding president. Even if things just continue to hum along unremarkably and the field in 2020 is no better wouldn't she likewise garner support then too?
13 | Ron Evans | 0 | 10154051209865950_10154051924510950 | What did the #DNCLeaks reveal? Racism against blacks (super predators), Hispanics (taco bowl voters), Jews, homosexuals, targeting Sanders, sending protesters out to target Trump, discussing placing craigslist ads to frame Trump, Selling federal positions for donations (isn't that a crime), media collusion, saying Hillary wanted to keep her voters ignorant and much more. Will the FBI investigate (Clinton Cash) Hillary selling off America and farmers/ranchers being harassed and/or killed for their land? Oh and Hillary does pay trolls to comment on social media on her behalf.
14 | Laura Thaxton | 3 | 10154051209865950_10154051224175950 | Sorry Trump supporters but Trump won't win. Clinton is already at 275 electoral votes and Trump is at 188. And I'm sure you know you need 270 to win. And if that doesn't convince you look at it like this... Florida, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin are all leaning towards Hillary. And if she wins Florida alone she wins the presidency. And so far early voting puts Florida in Hillarys favor. And if by some chance Trump does win Florida he still wouldn't have enough to win the presidency. He'll need to turn at least 3 or 4 other states that are already blue or leaning blue his way. Which at this point is near impossible
15 | Joanne Richard | 0 | 10154051209865950_10154052087265950 | I don't understand how anyone could vote for Rubio -- a spineless little wimp who hates what trump does, but will vote for him anyway -- and who never shows up for his job even though he still gets paid.
16 | Original Tea Party | 1 | 10154051209865950_10154051217075950 | I have been saying that she should voluntarily be a one term president. The Clinton haters will feel slightly better about things if she comes out earlier. She will have accomplished her primary goal, and broken the ultimate glass ceiling.
17 | Tammy Hart | 1 | 10154051209865950_10154051414040950 | How many illegal immigrants did you move into florida..and register to vote for her....i hope this bitch eats the dirt she dishes out
18 | Curtis Clark | 2 | 10154051209865950_10154051242635950 | Did donald change in last week? Fuck no he is still the piece of dogshit he has been all along. Just because his campaign stole his ☎ no twitter and gave him a teleprompter  doesn't change that fucktarded Orange orangantan #DonTheCon aka #BankruptingBillionaire Putin puppet he always been.
19 | Avi Rubin | 1 | 10154051209865950_10154052286745950 | Do you masochists? Not enough for you 8 years black?You want a Muslim terrorist in the US?Obama caused enough damage to the US.We have to have a change, voted for Donald Trump for a better future.
20 | Sleister Michael | 3 | 10154051209865950_10154051228580950 | PEOPLE LISTEN UP.If you vote for Hillary you vote for 100% more corruption in our government.Don't you think it is time to end it?Maybe Trump isn't the best pick, but at least we stand a chance to end part of the corruption, and if Trump doesn't do well we can find someone better in 4 years.But with Hillary she will get us in a war with Russia and chins the first year she is in office. Hillary has already stated she wants a war with Russia here at home to build her regime so she can control all.
21 | Alex Shaffer | 0 | 10154051209865950_10154051923425950 | Marco Rubio is little more than but a juvenile, pendejito Cubano with a sense of entitlement. He all but quit his job in the Senate to pursue a job on K Street as a highly paid lobbyist which he evidently failed to land. Hence why he wants his old job back. Send him home to his momma.
22 | Susan Baylis | 0 | 10154051209865950_10154052091725950 | 10 reasons why Hillary doesn’t deserve your voteShe endangered national security by putting classified information on a non-secure serverShe put classified information on several devices not approved by the government, some laptops and thumb drives with this classified are missing.FBI director says Hillary lied to congress under oathHillary lied to the American public saying the deaths of four americans in Benghazi was caused by a video, meanwhile that day told her daughter and the president of Egypt the truth.Hillary Clinton accepted millions of Dollars from countries who oppress and suppress women.the result of Hillary's "reset" with Russia. Russian economy and military were at the lowest levels in 2009. She has allowed Russia to rebuild and take the lead. Hillary's foreign policy allowed Russia to take back Crimea and the Ukraine. They have allowed Russia to keep Assad in power in Syria.Hillary hired private detectives to break into the homes of women whom Bill Clinton had groped and raped in order to destroy incriminating evidence such as tape recordings and love letters from Bill. Hillary set up a "war room" run by James Carville and George Stephanopoulos, to handle Bills "bimobo eruptions." The war room smeared and blackmailed Bills female conquests in an effort to insulate Bill fro scandal and rescue his Bill and Hillary's dreams.Hillary used the State Dept to further donations to the Clinton Foundation and to their personal wealth with outrageous speaking fees for government favors.An arms dealer who had threatened to reveal potantially damaging information about Hillary Clinton's alleged role in arming Islamist militants until federal prosecutors abruptly dropped their case against him$145 million was paid to the Clinton Foundation from Russia after the US State Dept under Hillary gave 20% of its uranium stockpile to the country.
23 | Klaus Reck | 0 | 10154051209865950_10154051831235950 | If you are Gay or lesbian, why would you want to vote for Hillary, when she gets millions from countries that will execute or in prison gays & lesbians?If you are Black, why are you voting for Hillary when she defends Planned Parenthood and admires Margaret Sanger, who wanted to abort as many black babies as possible and exterminate the black race, and Margaret Sanger said blacks are “morons,” “idiots,” “imbeciles,” “human weeds,” and “misfits.” Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.If you are a Woman, how can you vote for Hillary when she has buried all of Bill's rape victims under the rug. As an attorney, Hillary also defended the rapist of a 12-year old girl and laughed about it later. She plays the woman-card and acts entitled; implying that she deserves your vote merely because of her sex. How is that gender neutral?If you are a Miner, Steelworker or have a Factory job, why are you voting for Hillary when she supported NAFTA and TPP, and workers are being laid off because jobs are going overseas? She also welcomes open borders and illegals to get benefits with your tax money and compete for our jobs. Hillary boasts that under her administration miners and steelworkers will lose their jobs.If you are a Law abiding citizen, how can you vote for Hillary when she is clearly above the law? Hillary deleted thousands of secret e-mails *after* they had been subpoenaed by the courts (illegal). Hillary kept thousands of classified and top secret e-mails on her private server; servers that had less security that g-mail and Hotmail. You can be sure Russia, Iran, and China have those now. The DNC clearly broke the rules by heavy-handedly favoring Hillary over Sanders while they were still competing for the nomination.If you are a Veteran, in the military, or closely related to a military member, why are you voting for Hillary when she left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again? They called for help, but the help was told to stand down. Furthermore, Hillary wants to eliminate the NRA, take away your guns, and abolish the second amendment?Go Trump
24 | Rose Morales | 0 | 10154051209865950_10154051327220950 | The reason nothing has changed in this Country is because the same people that have been sitting in the same chairs for years, The same people that are endorsing Donald Trump but won't say his name or stand on the same stage with him. The reply I usually get is those lazy people or they are taking our jobs, referring to people of color. That brainwashing is what has kept us all down, unless you are wealthy. We are all living from paycheck to paycheck.
25 | Alexandria Hill-Weikart | 1 | 10154051209865950_10154051625975950 | My vent for the day.... I get $112 too much a month to get Irelyn disability.... this is fucking bullshit! Her dad and I both work and pay our fucking taxes, which he pays like $20k a year in ss tax, and our daughter can't get it but these fucking refugees can get it! And they never worked a day in their fucking lives! So my daughter that has a real diagnose disability , she's not sitting on her fucking ass all day collecting welfare has to go without!!!! A child with disabilities is very expensive, to get her everything she needs cost an arm and leg, Remember this when you are voting! We can't  take care of the American people that are truly disabled, but we can give all these refugees and lazy as fucks free shit!!! This is fucked up! The average  family of five on welfare gets over $120k of free food, healthcare, social security, free housing, free utilities and money!! Than me a single mom of four can't bring in more than 2400 a month! FYI, Irelyns appts are $150 a pop 4x a week! That's 2400 a month!!! Almost All my income to just her appts!!!! How can we eat, live under a roof, or drive her there?!!!! Fuck all you people voting for Hillary! De friend yourself now, you are supporting families like me to go without, for illegals and refugees that never contributed to anything to this fucking country! These programs are tax dollar funded! They are supposed to be a hand up, not a hand out! I paid my share, and I work, and going to school to be a nurse to help those in need! God forbid I receive child support, the money doesn't cover everything! A blanket for my daughter alone was $300! I'm having a shitty day, and fuck you Hillary supporters!!!! She can use her foundation to support these refugees, oh wait it's not a charity foundation, it's a way to not be taxed and pay for expensive wedding for her daughter, to arm fucking Isis, to pay and play shit, for lawyers because she's fucking breaking the law every day....
