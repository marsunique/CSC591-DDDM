2 | Larry Laibson | 1 | 10154801955524729_10154802060314729 | Peter Schweizer's "Clinton Cash", Tom Fitton's "Clean House", Dinesh D'Souza's "Hillary's America", and Gary Bryne's "Crisis of Character" are all informative and factual, backed up by numerous references. For those who can read and want to take the time to learn and vote intelligently, these are just some of the many sources out there. I am sure nay sayers also refute the information and evidence on all the thousands of released Wikileaks emails and will refute any findings of the FBI's two investigations.
3 | Annabelle Collins | 0 | 10154801955524729_10154802351644729 | Read the recent book The Making of Donald Trump for details on his ties to the mob and other information on his business practice and not some video that could have been put up by ISIS, Russia or anyone else that wants the USA to have a bad leader so they go to war. What is it with some in the States that they do not think that they are not capable of being lied to by enemies of the USA or the free world. The rest of us are terrified of a Trump leadership because we are being not being targeted by lies and have done the research and can see he is not qualifed at all even to run a business. Ask for his tax returns if he is so clever as proof that he is not once again broke.

Survivors of Benghazi called Hillary a weak & poor leader & also that she tried to Lie & NOT take responsibility for Benghazi.    They absolutely will not vote for Hillary.    30yrs in politics & Hillary can't determine what a classified or confidential document is.

Over the course of his entire presidential campaign, Donald Trump has been in a war with the media, often accusing news outlets of fabricating negatives stories about him to hurt his White House bid. While Trump's battle with the media is at an all-time high, there's one story that most mainstream media outlets have avoided reporting.Trump lawsuitIn the summer of 1994, a woman known only as "Jane Doe" was allegedly raped and threatened by Trump and convicted pedophile Jeffery Epstein. The woman previously filed a lawsuit in California, but the judge dismissed the case. Attempting to have her voice heard once again, "Jane Doe" made her case once again and it was strong enough to move forward in a New York court. Federal Judge Ronnie Abrams has since ordered a status conference to be held on December 16, with the legal representatives of both sides being present in the courtroom. As pointed out by the Bipartisan Report on October 23, new details have been revealed, painting a grim and dark picture about what allegedly went down over 20 years ago.The victim, known as "Jane Doe," filed the lawsuit under her assumed real name of Katie Johnson. Details in the lawsuit claim that she was the subject of, but not limited to, "acts of rape, sexual misconduct, criminal sexual acts," as well as "false imprisonment" and "threats of death." The incident apparently took place on more than one occasion, with the most emotionally scaring encounter occurring during the fourth and final time."Trump tied Plaintiff to a bed, exposed himself to Plaintiff, and then proceeded to forcibly rape Plaintiff," the lawsuit continues, describing the alleged rape as a "savage sexual attack." The plaintiff, "Jane Done" or Katie Johnson, claims she "loudly pleaded" for the former host of "The Apprentice" to stop, before he "violently" struck her face with his hand and informed the victim that he would "do whatever he wanted."In yet another bizarre twist to the alleged encounter, Epstein reportedly got into a heated exchange with Trump for taking the victim's virginity because he wanted to be the one to do so. In conclusion, both the Republican nominee and Epstein allegedly told the plaintiff that they would kill her and her family if she ever spoke about what happened.  A witness has come forward to confirm her story.Hiring Women Based on AppearancesGroping a Woman at a Manhattan NightclubGroping and Kissing a Former Apprentice ContestantKissing a Mar-a-Lago Guest at a Mother’s Day BrunchGroping a Woman Outside the 1998 U.S. Open Tennis ChampionshipSalma Hayak comes forward:  Trump planted a negative article about her after she refused to date himAn 11th person has come forward with allegations.

4 | Henrik Ahlm | 0 | 10154811933104729_10154812082089729 | Trump lacks stature, brains and good manners! He is not true to his words - all babble - no action!Trump is a nutbag, which in no way is fit for being the President and Commander in Chief of the highest public office on this planet! A creature, who started its presidential campaign calling its opponent "crucket". Republicans, who are responsible for letting a retarded nutbag and low-life creature represent them now owes it to the American people to act in an intelligent way in Congress. Trump is a criminal, a facist and looks like a pig and he'll be dealt with that way! Clinton is "much more a man" than Trump. Trump is a chicken! Period! Trump - because he is stupid and ignorant - thinks 640.000 e-mails cannot be checked in 8 days.Technology today exists which in less than millisecond can check 640.000 e-mails (an advanced stage of quantum mechanics) Vote Hillary, November 8, 2016 and sanity will still prevail.Ps. Sanity will prevail! Hillary is the winner! I know! God bless.
5 | Rebecca Laskey | 0 | 10154811933104729_10154811939299729 | B-R-E-A-K-I-N-G - STUNNING REPORT SAYS THAT ANTI-CLINTON FBI AGENTS, LEAKED INFORMATION TO GET TRUMP ELECTED:Hillary Clinton has been “EXHONERATED” in the Email Scandal, again.  No wrongdoing, No Charges, Case Closed.The Clinton Foundation is NOT under Investigation by the FBI.  However, the Trump Foundation is still under Investigation by the New York Attorney General for “Pay to Play” and “Self-Dealing”.There is an anti-Clinton faction in an FBI office that is suspected of releasing and leaking information in an attempt to get Donald Trump elected president.Stunning Report Finds Anti-Clinton FBI Agents Are Trying To Get Trump Elected PresidentThere is an anti-Clinton faction in an FBI office that is suspected of releasing and leaking information in an attempt to get Donald Trump elected president.Reuters reported:The new emails turned up as FBI investigators were examining electronic devices used by former Democratic Representative Anthony Weiner in connection with an alleged “sexting” scandal. Weiner’s estranged wife, Huma Abedin, is a Clinton confidante.Two law enforcement sources familiar with the FBI’s New York Field Office, which initially discovered the emails, said a faction of investigators based in the office is known to be hostile to Hillary Clinton. A spokeswoman for the FBI’s New York office said she had no knowledge about this.Democratic Party sources said such a faction was likely responsible for a recent surge in media leaks on alleged details of an ongoing FBI investigation of the Clinton Foundation.The lasting scandal to come out of the 2016 election might be the FBI, not Hillary Clinton’s emails. It is clear that there is something amiss in the bureau. If Democrats win control of the Senate on Tuesday, it is almost certain that they will launch an investigation into the FBI’s investigation of Clinton.FBI agents could be violating the law in an attempt to use their public sector jobs to interfere in a presidential election. What the anti-Clinton faction of the FBI is engaging in is a threat to US democracy.A group of FBI agents who are hostile to Hillary Clinton are trying to undermine a presidential election. That sentence reads like the plot to a Hollywood blockbuster, but that is what appears to be happening in real life in the final days of a presidential campaign.These FBI Agents were working with Rudy Giuliani to help Trump.  Agents who are Anti-Hillary are working with the Trump Campaign, Breitbart’s Bannon and a couple of others within the Trump Campaign.  Their Campaign knew in advance, that Comey was going to issue the Email to the GOP.  The GOP got it first, then it was passed on the Democrats.  There is also talk about emails being synched into Antony Weiner’s Emails, by the FBI and a proper Warrant, was not obtained?Should Hillary Clinton win the presidency, she may end up doing so by overcoming more obstacles than any other presidential candidate in US history.Clinton Foundation:  Trump and Fox News are Saying Clinton "Likely" to be Indicted.  This is a False and Ill Informed, Inaccurate and Without Merit.  Fox News has walked back their claims.Nor, is the Anthony Weiner investigation, “Likely” to lead to an indictment against Hillary Clinton.Comey is being Investigated for interfering with the Election.  “Hatch Act”Rudy Giuliani is also under investigation for leaking information to the Trump Campaign.Democrats now have all the motivation that they will ever need to get out and vote.STOP THE RIGHT-WING, ALT-RIGHT MADNESS DEMOCRATS!  REJECT AND DEFEAT TRUMP AND THE GOP.  VOTE BLUE UP AND DOWN THE BALLOT!!!IF YOU CARE, SHARE!

Trump - because he is stupid and ignorant - thinks 640.000 e-mails cannot be checked in 8 days.Technology today exists which in less than millisecond can check 640.000 e-mails (an advanced stage of quantum mechanics) Vote Hillary, November 8, 2016 and sanity will still prevail.Ps. Sanity will prevail! Hillary is the winner! I know! God bless.

4 | Rebecca Laskey | 0 | 10154811169724729_10154811973544729 | B-R-E-A-K-I-N-G - STUNNING REPORT SAYS THAT ANTI-CLINTON FBI AGENTS, LEAKED INFORMATION TO GET TRUMP ELECTED:Hillary Clinton has been “EXHONERATED” in the Email Scandal, again.  No wrongdoing, No Charges, Case Closed.The Clinton Foundation is NOT under Investigation by the FBI.  However, the Trump Foundation is still under Investigation by the New York Attorney General for “Pay to Play” and “Self-Dealing”.There is an anti-Clinton faction in an FBI office that is suspected of releasing and leaking information in an attempt to get Donald Trump elected president.Stunning Report Finds Anti-Clinton FBI Agents Are Trying To Get Trump Elected PresidentThere is an anti-Clinton faction in an FBI office that is suspected of releasing and leaking information in an attempt to get Donald Trump elected president.Reuters reported:The new emails turned up as FBI investigators were examining electronic devices used by former Democratic Representative Anthony Weiner in connection with an alleged “sexting” scandal. Weiner’s estranged wife, Huma Abedin, is a Clinton confidante.Two law enforcement sources familiar with the FBI’s New York Field Office, which initially discovered the emails, said a faction of investigators based in the office is known to be hostile to Hillary Clinton. A spokeswoman for the FBI’s New York office said she had no knowledge about this.Democratic Party sources said such a faction was likely responsible for a recent surge in media leaks on alleged details of an ongoing FBI investigation of the Clinton Foundation.The lasting scandal to come out of the 2016 election might be the FBI, not Hillary Clinton’s emails. It is clear that there is something amiss in the bureau. If Democrats win control of the Senate on Tuesday, it is almost certain that they will launch an investigation into the FBI’s investigation of Clinton.FBI agents could be violating the law in an attempt to use their public sector jobs to interfere in a presidential election. What the anti-Clinton faction of the FBI is engaging in is a threat to US democracy.A group of FBI agents who are hostile to Hillary Clinton are trying to undermine a presidential election. That sentence reads like the plot to a Hollywood blockbuster, but that is what appears to be happening in real life in the final days of a presidential campaign.These FBI Agents were working with Rudy Giuliani to help Trump.  Agents who are Anti-Hillary are working with the Trump Campaign, Breitbart’s Bannon and a couple of others within the Trump Campaign.  Their Campaign knew in advance, that Comey was going to issue the Email to the GOP.  The GOP got it first, then it was passed on the Democrats.  There is also talk about emails being synched into Antony Weiner’s Emails, by the FBI and a proper Warrant, was not obtained?Should Hillary Clinton win the presidency, she may end up doing so by overcoming more obstacles than any other presidential candidate in US history.Clinton Foundation:  Trump and Fox News are Saying Clinton "Likely" to be Indicted.  This is a False and Ill Informed, Inaccurate and Without Merit.  Fox News has walked back their claims.Nor, is the Anthony Weiner investigation, “Likely” to lead to an indictment against Hillary Clinton.Comey is being Investigated for interfering with the Election.  “Hatch Act”Rudy Giuliani is also under investigation for leaking information to the Trump Campaign.Democrats now have all the motivation that they will ever need to get out and vote.STOP THE RIGHT-WING, ALT-RIGHT MADNESS DEMOCRATS!  REJECT AND DEFEAT TRUMP AND THE GOP.  VOTE BLUE UP AND DOWN THE BALLOT!!!IF YOU CARE, SHARE!

The economy remeans weak with dismal job growth . Our national debt has grown to 20 trillion dollars.  Obama and Hillary have shown a lack of support for law enforcement and our military. The broken VA Administration remains. Our national security is threatened; illegal immigration, and Obama / Clinton failures in the Middle East with their lead from behind strategy. No, we don't need Hillary to be President to continue down this path of failure. No we don't need Hillary for president who is still under FBI investigation for corruption and racketeering at the Clinton Foundation.

Over the course of his entire presidential campaign, Donald Trump has been in a war with the media, often accusing news outlets of fabricating negatives stories about him to hurt his White House bid. While Trump's battle with the media is at an all-time high, there's one story that most mainstream media outlets have avoided reporting.Trump lawsuitIn the summer of 1994, a woman known only as "Jane Doe" was allegedly raped and threatened by Trump and convicted pedophile Jeffery Epstein. The woman previously filed a lawsuit in California, but the judge dismissed the case. Attempting to have her voice heard once again, "Jane Doe" made her case once again and it was strong enough to move forward in a New York court. Federal Judge Ronnie Abrams has since ordered a status conference to be held on December 16, with the legal representatives of both sides being present in the courtroom. As pointed out by the Bipartisan Report on October 23, new details have been revealed, painting a grim and dark picture about what allegedly went down over 20 years ago.The victim, known as "Jane Doe," filed the lawsuit under her assumed real name of Katie Johnson. Details in the lawsuit claim that she was the subject of, but not limited to, "acts of rape, sexual misconduct, criminal sexual acts," as well as "false imprisonment" and "threats of death." The incident apparently took place on more than one occasion, with the most emotionally scaring encounter occurring during the fourth and final time."Trump tied Plaintiff to a bed, exposed himself to Plaintiff, and then proceeded to forcibly rape Plaintiff," the lawsuit continues, describing the alleged rape as a "savage sexual attack." The plaintiff, "Jane Done" or Katie Johnson, claims she "loudly pleaded" for the former host of "The Apprentice" to stop, before he "violently" struck her face with his hand and informed the victim that he would "do whatever he wanted."In yet another bizarre twist to the alleged encounter, Epstein reportedly got into a heated exchange with Trump for taking the victim's virginity because he wanted to be the one to do so. In conclusion, both the Republican nominee and Epstein allegedly told the plaintiff that they would kill her and her family if she ever spoke about what happened.  A witness has come forward to confirm her story.Hiring Women Based on AppearancesGroping a Woman at a Manhattan NightclubGroping and Kissing a Former Apprentice ContestantKissing a Mar-a-Lago Guest at a Mother’s Day BrunchGroping a Woman Outside the 1998 U.S. Open Tennis ChampionshipSalma Hayak comes forward:  Trump planted a negative article about her after she refused to date himAn 11th person has come forward with allegations.

Example…Hillary Clinton is running for President Of The United States, and she is married to ex-President Bill Clinton who is a known Sexual Predator and Liar. Both Bill and Hillary are involved with the Clinton Foundation which is under investigation by the FBI for RICO Violations….. Hillary Clinton has been investigated by the FBI herself for using a private E-Mail server while in government service…A recent E-Mail hack of the DNC provided hundreds of E-Mails showing corruption and collusion among the Hillary Clinton Camp, The Media, and the Government itself…Charges will not be brought forth due to the fact that as the E-Mails have shown…Those who would indict Hillary are the ones that have been corrupted. Classic Mafia Style Corruption…Hillary has chosen Huma Abedin to be her right-hand person and confidant. Huma Abedin is under FBI Investigation…. Huma Abedin was married to ex-Congressman Anthony Weiner who is also under FBI Investigation for being a Pedophile, and Sexual Predator ….. Someone Obviously Has Been Making A Lot Of Bad Choices…. It Is Important That As An American That You Make The Right Choice When It Comes Time For You To Vote……….

One of the “plagues” listed by Milbank, for example, was “Blood” and centered around a quote from Trump about Megyn Kelly: “You could see there was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever.”Internal DNC emails suggest Milbanks asked for — and then leaned heavily on — DNC opposition research on Trump for the article.

24 | Frances Scott | 0 | 10154811481849729_10154811500349729 | NYPD is doing the entire nation a great service, according to Erick Prince, the founder of Blackwater and a retired Navy Seal. He is well known in military, security and law enforcement circles and has strong contacts within the New York Police Department. They are confirming some very serious and disturbing information that is leaking out about just what was on the Weiner laptop. Prince was interviewed on Breitbart radio on Friday.  According to Prince, “They found State Department emails. They found a lot of other really damning criminal information, including money laundering, including the fact that Hillary went to this sex island with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Bill Clinton went there more than 20 times. Hillary Clinton went there at least six times.”He said, “The amount of garbage that they found in emails, of criminal activity by Hillary, by her immediate circle, even by other Democrat members of Congress, was so disgusting, they then gave it to the FBI and they said, ‘We’re going to go public with this if you don’t reopen the investigation, you don’t do the right thing with timely indictments.”Prince reveals that the NYPD wanted to hold a press conference and announce the additional arrests they were making and they received huge pushback to the point of coercion from the Justice Department. He said the Justice Department went so far as to direct them to charge an unrelated individual in the Eric Garner case of almost two years before. He says, “That’s the level of pushback the Obama Justice Department is doing against actually seeking justice in these email and other related criminal matters. He says in the unfortunate instance of Hillary Clinton being “elected” president there will be a constitutional crisis unlike anything since 1860. Prince says, “NYPD was the first one to look at that laptop. Weiner and Huma Abedin, his wife, the closest adviser of Hillary Clinton of twenty years, have both flipped. They are cooperating with the government. They see potential jail time of many years for their crimes.”NYPD kept a copy of the computer and passed a copy on to the FBI, which was what forced Comey to reopen the investigation. He says, “NYPD has all the information and they will pursue justice, within their rights, if the FBI doesn’t.  And there is all kind of criminal culpability, there’s all of the emails they’ve seen, of that 650,000, including money laundering, underage sex, pay for play, and of course, plenty of proof of inappropriate handling, sending and receiving of classified information, up to SAP level special access programs. He quotes one of the NYPD Chiefs, saying, “As a parent, as a father with daughters, he could not let that level of evil continue.”Recent stories on this topic with similar sources and conclusions can be seen at the following links.

Comey, said on Sunday that the cabinet had completed the examination of the newly discovered e-mails connected to Clinton - an inquiry that had disturbed the presidential race for nine days - and found nothing to change his decision of months not state the former secretary for the use of a private email server.

One of the “plagues” listed by Milbank, for example, was “Blood” and centered around a quote from Trump about Megyn Kelly: “You could see there was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever.”Internal DNC emails suggest Milbanks asked for — and then leaned heavily on — DNC opposition research on Trump for the article.

Jim Geraghty in National Review says: ".The fact that Hillary Clinton is the first female to win a major party’s presidential nomination should not obscure the harm she’s done to our politics in her decades-long career.

10 | Frances Scott | 0 | 10154811315419729_10154811502974729 | NYPD is doing the entire nation a great service, according to Erick Prince, the founder of Blackwater and a retired Navy Seal. He is well known in military, security and law enforcement circles and has strong contacts within the New York Police Department. They are confirming some very serious and disturbing information that is leaking out about just what was on the Weiner laptop. Prince was interviewed on Breitbart radio on Friday.  According to Prince, “They found State Department emails. They found a lot of other really damning criminal information, including money laundering, including the fact that Hillary went to this sex island with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Bill Clinton went there more than 20 times. Hillary Clinton went there at least six times.”He said, “The amount of garbage that they found in emails, of criminal activity by Hillary, by her immediate circle, even by other Democrat members of Congress, was so disgusting, they then gave it to the FBI and they said, ‘We’re going to go public with this if you don’t reopen the investigation, you don’t do the right thing with timely indictments.”Prince reveals that the NYPD wanted to hold a press conference and announce the additional arrests they were making and they received huge pushback to the point of coercion from the Justice Department. He said the Justice Department went so far as to direct them to charge an unrelated individual in the Eric Garner case of almost two years before. He says, “That’s the level of pushback the Obama Justice Department is doing against actually seeking justice in these email and other related criminal matters. He says in the unfortunate instance of Hillary Clinton being “elected” president there will be a constitutional crisis unlike anything since 1860. Prince says, “NYPD was the first one to look at that laptop. Weiner and Huma Abedin, his wife, the closest adviser of Hillary Clinton of twenty years, have both flipped. They are cooperating with the government. They see potential jail time of many years for their crimes.”NYPD kept a copy of the computer and passed a copy on to the FBI, which was what forced Comey to reopen the investigation. He says, “NYPD has all the information and they will pursue justice, within their rights, if the FBI doesn’t.  And there is all kind of criminal culpability, there’s all of the emails they’ve seen, of that 650,000, including money laundering, underage sex, pay for play, and of course, plenty of proof of inappropriate handling, sending and receiving of classified information, up to SAP level special access programs. He quotes one of the NYPD Chiefs, saying, “As a parent, as a father with daughters, he could not let that level of evil continue.”Recent stories on this topic with similar sources and conclusions can be seen at the following links.

He is not true to his words - all babble!As expected Trump and his cronies has not given Hillary an apology for uttering wrongful allegations regarding Hillary's use of e-mail back when she was a foreign minister/secretary of state for the U.S. In my book - Trump is a nutbag and a low-life retarded creature, which in no way is fit for being the President and Chief in Command of the highest public office on this planet! Republicans, who are responsible for letting a retarded nutbag represent them now owes it to the American people to act in an intelligent way in Congress.

It leads to deteriorating physical and mental condition, strokes, fainting, and occasional mental shutdowns. A sudden medical event on her part might easily prevent Hillary Clinton from being used by her special interest groups as their representative.

Frail, incompetent, and increasingly vulnerable, she has surrounded herself with a team of advisers and experts that are just as corrupt, unprincipled, and incompetent as Hillary Clinton herself is. Her staff is corrupt and unreliable to an appallingly high degree. Personally, she cannot make a good informed decision with this regard! As she gets increasingly fragile physically and mentally, practically all Hillary Clinton’s picks inevitably become manipulative and untrustworthy almost from the start of their hapless careers. HRC can be best compared to a ringleader with high ambitions but rapidly diminishing capabilities.

The corrupt and dishonest Clinton family along with their treasonous advisers and treacherous filthy rich donors from the Wall Street and foreign corporations can only bring terror, impoverishment, and disgrace to the nation!

We have rekindled our relationship for the honesty. Tell it like it is the good, bad and ugly.... we will respect you! God Bless! Thank you!

WikiLeaks Show Washington Post Writer Asked DNC For Anti-Trump ResearchPhoto of Peter HassonPeter HassonReporter, Associate Editor11:08 PM 11/06/2016Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank appears to have asked the Democratic National Committee (DNC) to do the majority of the research for a negative column he wrote about Donald Trump in April 2016.Milbank’s column was titled, “The Ten Plagues of Trump,” and featured a list of “outrageous things” said by Trump. One of the “plagues” listed by Milbank, for example, was “Blood” and centered around a quote from Trump about Megyn Kelly: “You could see there was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever.”Internal DNC emails suggest Milbanks asked for — and then leaned heavily on — DNC opposition research on Trump for the article.A man walks past The Washington Post on August 5, 2013 in Washington, DC after it was announced that Amazon.com founder and CEO Jeff Bezos had agreed to purchase the Post for USD 250 million. Multi-billionaire Bezos, who created Amazon, which has soared in a few years to a dominant position in online retailing, said he was buying the Post in his personal capacity and hoped to shepherd it through the evolution away from traditional newsprint.

(RELATED: Hill’s Shills: Leaks Have Exposed Journalists In Clinton’s Corner)Of the 10 “plagues” listed by Milbank, eight of them matched up with suggestions from the DNC.By press time, Milbank had not yet replied to a list of questions from The Daily Caller about his article and whether or not he used DNC research in crafting it.Read more: http://dailycaller.com/2016/11/06/wikileaks-show-washington-post-writer-asked-dnc-for-anti-trump-research/#ixzz4PKnsw8ua

Honesty was "right" about the next president of this absolutely beautiful land!!"Comey notified Congress on November 6 that the FBI has “reviewed all of the communications that were to or from Hillary Clinton while she was Secretary of State,” and that the review of related emails “obtained in connection with an unrelated criminal investigation” has led to no changes in the FBI’s “conclusions that we expressed in July,” when the FBI found that “no charges are appropriate in this case.” NBC’s Pete Williams reported that “nearly all the documents … were duplicates that the FBI had already seen in its investigation of the Clinton email server or were personal emails that had no bearing on the question of classification.”

The media outlets managers are controlled by the corrupt and crime-riven government and multinational corporations who do not care about America or American people.Hillary Clinton has been exposed as a seasoned criminal with multiple offences and a more horrible person than any other modern politician! Regardless of FBI’s recent announcement that the Clinton email probe is over, new pieces of evidence against scandal-riven Hillary Clinton may well appear any moment and new charges against her will be brought with renewed vigor. Hillary Clinton is too tainted to be a reliable contender for any future political role or public office. Hillary’s days are over! She is a political cadaver and a too incompetent and physically and mentally exhausted person. Hillary Clinton is being protected by the donor to the Clinton Foundation. Her past crimes and multi-million donations make Hillary Clinton even more dependent on her bosses. A new batch of WikiLeaks-revealed emails might appear at any moment and Hillary Clinton will become faced with a grim prospect being indicted for her past sins.Hillary Clinton suffers a degenerative cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) that occurs when blood clots form in the brain's venous sinuses. She was diagnosed with CVST back in 2013. CVST prevents blood from draining out of her brain. It leads to deteriorating physical and mental condition, strokes, fainting, and occasional mental shutdowns. A sudden medical event on her part might easily prevent Hillary Clinton from being used by her special interest groups as their representative. That is why this aspect of Hillary Clinton’s ability to perform the duties of president has been closely guarded by her family members, her corporate handlers, and campaign managers.They certainly will not be stopped by the fact that Hillary Clinton and her team are greedy, incompetent, disloyal, untrustworthy, pathetic losers who have no idea how to run a country... The Clintons are totally corrupt and their political machinery are but gangsters, fraudsters, and corrupt politicians backed by certain corporations and financiers. Hillary Clinton is totally incompetent and wholly dependent on her domestic and foreign donors, was to be elected president. Hillary Clinton is too unqualified to be president! Everybody knows that. But the desire to put their own person in that position is too strong for certain interest groups to resist it. That is why we have been witnessing such unprecedented collusion of the political interests and power of the US government, the economic interests and power of the corporations, and the personal and administrative interests and power of the mainstream news media managers trying to create an illusion that Hillary Clinton has more popular support than she could ever dream of, based on her personal track record and abilities.That is why we cannot trust the mainstream media's lies about Hillary Clinton and her political circle. Frail, incompetent, and increasingly vulnerable, she has surrounded herself with a team of advisers and experts that are just as corrupt, unprincipled, and incompetent as Hillary Clinton herself is. Her staff is corrupt and unreliable to an appallingly high degree. Personally, she cannot make a good informed decision with this regard! As she gets increasingly fragile physically and mentally, practically all Hillary Clinton’s picks inevitably become manipulative and untrustworthy almost from the start of their hapless careers. HRC can be best compared to a ringleader with high ambitions but rapidly diminishing capabilities. Like in a typical mob, they are picked based on their criminality, loyalty to their boss, and readiness to violate any law and regulation – including the Constitution – to please their criminally minded leaders.People like Hillary Clinton and her immensely corrupt and dishonest cronies cannot be highly qualified experts in anything except deception, fraud, theft, and other criminal activities. The corrupt and dishonest Clinton family along with their treasonous advisers and treacherous filthy rich donors from the Wall Street and foreign corporations can only bring terror, impoverishment, and disgrace to the nation!

Word for word from the Cornell Law Library - RE: H ClintonApparently, the FBI forgot to visit the Cornell Law Library. Word for word from the Cornell Law Library Former United States Attorney General Michael Mukasey tells MSNBC that not only is Hillary Clinton's private email server illegal, it "disqualifies" her from holding any federal office. Very specifically points to one federal law, Title 18. Section 2071.For those of us who do not have United States Code committed to memory, here's what it says:"(a) Whoever willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys, or attempts to do so, or, with intent to do so takes and carries away any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.(b) Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States. As used in this subsection, the term "office" does not include the office held by any person as a retired officer of the Armed Forces of the United States."Yes, it explicitly states "shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States."

1 | Annabelle Collins | 2 | 10154809114359729_10154810927084729 | Clearly some in the states have confirmation bias and listen to things Trump has been proven to have lied about. Papers around the world are asking the USA not to elect Trump as anyone with half a brain knows he using the Hitler play book to get elected. Tonight he claimed to his audience in his first sentence that there were 7000 people waiting to get inside when the Australian cameraman showed less than a 1000 were there. The man is the most barefaced liar I have ever seen in politics and that is saying something. Do Trump voters think the rest of the world is stupid or has Trump convinced them that black is white and the rest of the world is wrong. Even his bankers say he keeps going bankrupt because he has zero knowledge of the most basic things of finance and economics. If he was so successful and knew he was going to be elected he would show his tax returns. I really hope someone releases them online so we can see what is in them.

Both just are Muppets of their Party.Frances Scott: That is the most ignorant statement I have ever heard an adult make. Hillary Clinton is for open borders, globalism and a One World Government because it means more money in her pocket and more power for her. D. Trump is for this country and for Americans. Anyone with even a very small brain knows that when this country ends, the entire world loses. This country takes care of three-fourths of the rest of the world in some manner or other. When this country is run by a dictator, Hillary, all the money will go into Hillary's pocket just as it has when she sold our uranium to Russia and just as it does in every other country's dictator's pocket. Oh, fool, did you get any of that uranium money????????? Only an idiot with a very small brain would vote for a criminal who wants more power and money instead of a successful business man who wants to make this country great again for all races. You are a very stupid individual whether you are a citizen of this country or not you are benefitting from this country some way and when it is gone, there will be no more benefits for anyone. And Hillay will bring that end, as that is her intention.Narkeeta Scott: Life long American democrats have left the democrat party, life long American Republicans have left the republican party. Now it's a new situation. Trump is no where near perfect, but he's not playing the establishment's game. Our country needs a person like that regardless of his personality, he's the only one that will really fight the establishment. The democrats have completely sold out to the devil, and there isn't any democrat that can help this country. The republicans are not perfect of course but a better choice than the completely sold out democrats. Trump has really changed the framework of the republicans. Trump is not about politics as usual. Politics as usual will be the end of the USA!  I hope that helps you to understand American politics.

Hillary Clinton, speaking at the Women in the World Summit on April 23, made the statement: Far too many women are denied access to reproductive health care and safe childbirth, and laws don’t count for much if they’re not enforced. Rights have to exist in practice — not just on paper. Laws have to be backed up with resources and political will. And deep-seated cultural codes, religious beliefs and structural biases have to be changed.

It would have been quite impossible for us to develop our plan for the world if we had been subjected to the lights of publicity during those years. But, now that the world is more sophisticated, it is prepared to march towards a world government and accept the supranational sovereignty of an intellectual and financial elite, which is surely preferable to the national autodetermination practiced in past centuries…"

16 | Sergey Malovatov | 0 | 10154809114359729_10154811601019729 | Do not trust the mainstream news media networks!Any person who loves his or her nation will get out and vote for Donald Trump! The media outlets managers are controlled by the corrupt and crime-riven government and multinational corporations who do not care about America or American people.Hillary Clinton has been exposed as a seasoned criminal with multiple offences and a more horrible person than any other modern politician! Regardless of FBI’s recent announcement that the Clinton email probe is over, new pieces of evidence against scandal-riven Hillary Clinton may well appear any moment and new charges against her will be brought with renewed vigor. Hillary Clinton is too tainted to be a reliable contender for any future political role or public office. Hillary’s days are over! She is a political cadaver and a too incompetent and physically and mentally exhausted person. Hillary Clinton is being protected by the donor to the Clinton Foundation. Her past crimes and multi-million donations make Hillary Clinton even more dependent on her bosses. A new batch of WikiLeaks-revealed emails might appear at any moment and Hillary Clinton will become faced with a grim prospect being indicted for her past sins.Hillary Clinton suffers a degenerative cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) that occurs when blood clots form in the brain's venous sinuses. She was diagnosed with CVST back in 2013. CVST prevents blood from draining out of her brain. It leads to deteriorating physical and mental condition, strokes, fainting, and occasional mental shutdowns. A sudden medical event on her part might easily prevent Hillary Clinton from being used by her special interest groups as their representative. That is why this aspect of Hillary Clinton’s ability to perform the duties of president has been closely guarded by her family members, her corporate handlers, and campaign managers.They certainly will not be stopped by the fact that Hillary Clinton and her team are greedy, incompetent, disloyal, untrustworthy, pathetic losers who have no idea how to run a country... The Clintons are totally corrupt and their political machinery are but gangsters, fraudsters, and corrupt politicians backed by certain corporations and financiers. Hillary Clinton is totally incompetent and wholly dependent on her domestic and foreign donors, was to be elected president. Hillary Clinton is too unqualified to be president! Everybody knows that. But the desire to put their own person in that position is too strong for certain interest groups to resist it. That is why we have been witnessing such unprecedented collusion of the political interests and power of the US government, the economic interests and power of the corporations, and the personal and administrative interests and power of the mainstream news media managers trying to create an illusion that Hillary Clinton has more popular support than she could ever dream of, based on her personal track record and abilities.That is why we cannot trust the mainstream media's lies about Hillary Clinton and her political circle. Frail, incompetent, and increasingly vulnerable, she has surrounded herself with a team of advisers and experts that are just as corrupt, unprincipled, and incompetent as Hillary Clinton herself is. Her staff is corrupt and unreliable to an appallingly high degree. Personally, she cannot make a good informed decision with this regard! As she gets increasingly fragile physically and mentally, practically all Hillary Clinton’s picks inevitably become manipulative and untrustworthy almost from the start of their hapless careers. HRC can be best compared to a ringleader with high ambitions but rapidly diminishing capabilities. Like in a typical mob, they are picked based on their criminality, loyalty to their boss, and readiness to violate any law and regulation – including the Constitution – to please their criminally minded leaders.People like Hillary Clinton and her immensely corrupt and dishonest cronies cannot be highly qualified experts in anything except deception, fraud, theft, and other criminal activities. The corrupt and dishonest Clinton family along with their treasonous advisers and treacherous filthy rich donors from the Wall Street and foreign corporations can only bring terror, impoverishment, and disgrace to the nation!

What was he showing the States teens for an example as their peer, Donald is stepping in as a Steward to the young of America. Not as this example as we see in this article:Evidence reason Bakari Sellers' DUI charge droppedLaDonna BeekerApr 8, 2013 05:16 PMCHESTER COUNTY, SC (WIS) - Evidence in a state representative's driving under the influence case allowed him to plea to a lesser charge.    State Rep. Bakari Sellers was charged with DUI on Oct. 7 when he was traveling north on Interstate 77 just after 1 a.m. from a South Carolina football game, where he admitted to deputies he was drinking alcohol. Sellers refused a breath test, resulting in an automatic six-month driver's license suspension. His license was reinstated in February by a judicial panel.However, Sellers will not see any more consequences from the DUI charge because video surveillance from the deputy's patrol car did not match the date on Sellers' ticket. Because the evidence did not flow, it could not hold up in court.Sellers was allowed to plead guilty to reckless driving and pay a $475 fine. Court documents show he signed an affidavit April 1 acknowledging his guilt to the lesser charge."I am very pleased to have been cleared of all alcohol-related charges from my traffic stop in Chester County last fall," Sellers said in a statement released Friday.He takes "full responsibility" for his actions and admitted he was too tired to drive."I apologize and will do my best to set a better example for our youth and to continue to move South Carolina forward," Sellers said." I don't think he should explain properness when he is so drunk with words against a person that stands for America! As unbelievably, there is shocking videos on the net of his DUI arrest! TRUMP 2016

Over the course of his entire presidential campaign, Donald Trump has been in a war with the media, often accusing news outlets of fabricating negatives stories about him to hurt his White House bid. While Trump's battle with the media is at an all-time high, there's one story that most mainstream media outlets have avoided reporting.Trump lawsuitIn the summer of 1994, a woman known only as "Jane Doe" was allegedly raped and threatened by Trump and convicted pedophile Jeffery Epstein. The woman previously filed a lawsuit in California, but the judge dismissed the case. Attempting to have her voice heard once again, "Jane Doe" made her case once again and it was strong enough to move forward in a New York court. Federal Judge Ronnie Abrams has since ordered a status conference to be held on December 16, with the legal representatives of both sides being present in the courtroom. As pointed out by the Bipartisan Report on October 23, new details have been revealed, painting a grim and dark picture about what allegedly went down over 20 years ago.The victim, known as "Jane Doe," filed the lawsuit under her assumed real name of Katie Johnson. Details in the lawsuit claim that she was the subject of, but not limited to, "acts of rape, sexual misconduct, criminal sexual acts," as well as "false imprisonment" and "threats of death." The incident apparently took place on more than one occasion, with the most emotionally scaring encounter occurring during the fourth and final time."Trump tied Plaintiff to a bed, exposed himself to Plaintiff, and then proceeded to forcibly rape Plaintiff," the lawsuit continues, describing the alleged rape as a "savage sexual attack." The plaintiff, "Jane Done" or Katie Johnson, claims she "loudly pleaded" for the former host of "The Apprentice" to stop, before he "violently" struck her face with his hand and informed the victim that he would "do whatever he wanted."In yet another bizarre twist to the alleged encounter, Epstein reportedly got into a heated exchange with Trump for taking the victim's virginity because he wanted to be the one to do so. In conclusion, both the Republican nominee and Epstein allegedly told the plaintiff that they would kill her and her family if she ever spoke about what happened.  A witness has come forward to confirm her story.Hiring Women Based on AppearancesGroping a Woman at a Manhattan NightclubGroping and Kissing a Former Apprentice ContestantKissing a Mar-a-Lago Guest at a Mother’s Day BrunchGroping a Woman Outside the 1998 U.S. Open Tennis ChampionshipSalma Hayak comes forward:  Trump planted a negative article about her after she refused to date himAn 11th person has come forward with allegations.

PERCHE' TIFO TRUMP(conclusi i dibattiti in TV e cene di gala a parte)1) I litiganti sono due ed è inutile "sognare" di meglio2) La Clinton è abortista, a dir poco "discutibile" per quanto riguarda la politica mediorientale, quanto "ambigua" nei confronti del mondo cattolico, per di più rischia una vera e propria guerra contro la Russia: in termini di cadaveri possibili è dunque nettamente in testa.3) Trump rischia solo di mettere arabi e islamici al loro posto... Cosa che di questi tempi è quantomeno necessaria. Con la Russia "rischia" solo... la pace!4) Trump sarà un po' "fuori di testa" ma è spontaneo, simpatico e certamente persone così sono molto più affidabili.5) La Clinton rappresenta la vecchia politica delle facciate sorridenti e delle scelte velenose. Dunque ipocrita ed antipatica.6) Affari e vizi privati dell'una e/o dell'altra sponda dovrebbero riguardare solo cortili, comari e confessori. Non è comunque da calci di rigore sbagliati "che si giudica un giocatore"...7) E' invece urgente in tutto il mondo contenere la disgregazione e il disordine politico e morale che ormai dilagano oltre ogni confine a causa di interessate globalizzazioni multiculturali e inclusioni fuori controllo stabilendo invece tra le culture precisi "paletti" che non travalichino mai oltre i tradizionali e consolidati concetti di reciproco e diplomatico rispetto (ma... ciascuno a casa propria...).E' importante che un forte segnale in tal senso venga proprio dalle elezioni americane: una inversione di tendenza che oggi non è più una possibilità ma una vera necessità di sopravvivenza per l'umanità intera (dunque... me compreso).

While Trump's battle with the media is at an all-time high, there's one story that most mainstream media outlets have avoided reporting.Trump lawsuitIn the summer of 1994, a woman known only as "Jane Doe" was allegedly raped and threatened by Trump and convicted pedophile Jeffery Epstein. The woman previously filed a lawsuit in California, but the judge dismissed the case. Attempting to have her voice heard once again, "Jane Doe" made her case once again and it was strong enough to move forward in a New York court. Federal Judge Ronnie Abrams has since ordered a status conference to be held on December 16, with the legal representatives of both sides being present in the courtroom. As pointed out by the Bipartisan Report on October 23, new details have been revealed, painting a grim and dark picture about what allegedly went down over 20 years ago.The victim, known as "Jane Doe," filed the lawsuit under her assumed real name of Katie Johnson. Details in the lawsuit claim that she was the subject of, but not limited to, "acts of rape, sexual misconduct, criminal sexual acts," as well as "false imprisonment" and "threats of death." The incident apparently took place on more than one occasion, with the most emotionally scaring encounter occurring during the fourth and final time."Trump tied Plaintiff to a bed, exposed himself to Plaintiff, and then proceeded to forcibly rape Plaintiff," the lawsuit continues, describing the alleged rape as a "savage sexual attack." The plaintiff, "Jane Done" or Katie Johnson, claims she "loudly pleaded" for the former host of "The Apprentice" to stop, before he "violently" struck her face with his hand and informed the victim that he would "do whatever he wanted."In yet another bizarre twist to the alleged encounter, Epstein reportedly got into a heated exchange with Trump for taking the victim's virginity because he wanted to be the one to do so. In conclusion, both the Republican nominee and Epstein allegedly told the plaintiff that they would kill her and her family if she ever spoke about what happened.  A witness has come forward to confirm her story.Hiring Women Based on AppearancesGroping a Woman at a Manhattan NightclubGroping and Kissing a Former Apprentice ContestantKissing a Mar-a-Lago Guest at a Mother’s Day BrunchGroping a Woman Outside the 1998 U.S. Open Tennis ChampionshipSalma Hayak comes forward:  Trump planted a negative article about her after she refused to date himAn 11th person has come forward with allegations.

It would have been quite impossible for us to develop our plan for the world if we had been subjected to the lights of publicity during those years. But, now that the world is more sophisticated, it is prepared to march towards a world government and accept the supranational sovereignty of an intellectual and financial elite, which is surely preferable to the national autodetermination practiced in past centuries…"

It is hard to tell how he can come on TV at CNN every night disgracing D. J. Trump when he himself committed such a disposable act! What was he showing the States teens for an example as their peer, Donald is stepping in as a Steward to the young of America. Not as this example as we see in this article:Evidence reason Bakari Sellers' DUI charge droppedLaDonna BeekerApr 8, 2013 05:16 PMCHESTER COUNTY, SC (WIS) - Evidence in a state representative's driving under the influence case allowed him to plea to a lesser charge.    State Rep. Bakari Sellers was charged with DUI on Oct. 7 when he was traveling north on Interstate 77 just after 1 a.m. from a South Carolina football game, where he admitted to deputies he was drinking alcohol. Sellers refused a breath test, resulting in an automatic six-month driver's license suspension. His license was reinstated in February by a judicial panel.However, Sellers will not see any more consequences from the DUI charge because video surveillance from the deputy's patrol car did not match the date on Sellers' ticket. Because the evidence did not flow, it could not hold up in court.Sellers was allowed to plead guilty to reckless driving and pay a $475 fine. Court documents show he signed an affidavit April 1 acknowledging his guilt to the lesser charge."I am very pleased to have been cleared of all alcohol-related charges from my traffic stop in Chester County last fall," Sellers said in a statement released Friday.He takes "full responsibility" for his actions and admitted he was too tired to drive."I apologize and will do my best to set a better example for our youth and to continue to move South Carolina forward," Sellers said." I don't think he should explain properness when he is so drunk with words against a person that stands for America! As unbelievably, there is shocking videos on the net of his DUI arrest! TRUMP 2016

If Trump continues to get somewhere in the neighborhood of one of every five Hispanic votes, it would mark a new low for Republicans.

In this election I will vote blue but I wan to listen what the republican party have to offert my in the next one. If the keep electing people like Trump or Cruz, I'll keep voting the same way
2 | Donald Nelson | 7 | 10154809058184729_10154809398444729 | Black people are supporting him double the rate of Mitt Romney.Black people realize you're just trying to move them up a rung on the social ladder by bringing in illegal immigrants. Black people are starting to understand the threat that the left poses
3 | Alberto Ortiz | 3 | 10154809058184729_10154809489379729 | Is the FBI “rigged and corrupt” again? Now, two days before most Americans will head to the polls to choose a new president, Comey told lawmakers that, after agents worked “around the clock to process and review a large volume of emails from a device obtained in an unrelated criminal investigation ... we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton.”What the hell trump, and his followers, were expecting to find from Anthony's laptop? A Tic-Tac meme? Nothing there, they knew it from the very beginning. Waste of tax payer money. Lock him up!! Lock him up!! Lock him up!!PD: Any bullying will be reported to Melania and you will be escorted out by the FBI, oops I mean secret service. Any doubt ask Comey, oops I mean trump. Thank you!

6 | Pat Richards | 3 | 10154809058184729_10154809404984729 | Republicans have no one to blame but themselves.... America is a Democracy, Senators, Congressmen, etc are elected by the people to do what's best for the people.... Going out of your way to SHOOT DOWN everything a Democratic President proposed just because it came from a Democratic President is NOT how Democracy is suppose to work, and is certainly NOT in the best interest of the people.... It's time to show the Republicans THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE.... VOTE BLUE STRAIGHT DOWN THE TICKET!!

9 | Eddy Parisi | 1 | 10154809058184729_10154809426724729 | Quoted by News Station; Hillary Clinton has resorted to mockery when it comes to Trump’s stance on immigration, making something of a slogan out of it. “We’re going to be building bridges, not walls.” As for specific policy, Hillary supports “comprehensive immigration reform with a path to full and equal citizenship,” and keeping Obama’s executive orders in place. Liberals positions down the line — but she wasn’t always singing the same tune. Chris Menahan uncovered that immigration is just one of the many issues on which Hillary has flip-flopped; Shocking video shows Hillary Clinton calling for deportations and the building of a “physical barrier” to keep Mexicans out of the U.S.Hillary is seen arguing the policies of Mexico are “pushing migration north across our border” and says the U.S. needs to “secure our borders” with “physical barriers,” implement “tougher employer sanctions” for hiring illegals and “deport” those who’ve “committed transgressions.” The video was taken from a         http://www.infowars.com/hillary-in-2006-us-needs-physical-barrier-to-keep-mexicans-out/             (full video in the hyperlink).

18 | Vickie Smith Wiles | 1 | 10154809058184729_10154809596949729 | These are the teachings of Saul Alinsky that Hillary Clinton and Obama follow! How do I know? I can see the steps in play!! I can see what is happening around me!!! This is the best five minutes in your life, that you NEED to take a moment and think!!!Watch the video!!! Think about what you have seen?Did you know Obama wrote about Saul in his books? Did you know Hillary wrote about him in her thesis? Both idolized Saul Alinsky. Enough to follow his rules. I could go on and on, but I'm going to stop and give you the chance to independently, come to your own conclusion. Also do your research!!! Research websites!!! Researching websites is most important when you are seeking truth!!! Dig deep!!! I promise, you'll find your answers. Does any of this scare you?There are eight levels of control that must be obtained before you can create a social state:1. Healthcare - Control healthcare and you control the people. 2. Poverty - Increase the Poverty level as high as possible; poor people are easier to control and will not fight back if you are providing everything for them to live.3. Debt - Increase the debt to an unsustainable level. That way you are able to increase taxed, and this will produce more poverty.4. Gun Control - Remove the ability to defend themselves from the government. That way you are able to create a police state.5. Welfare - Take control of every aspect of their lives (Food, Housing, and Income).6. Education - Take control of what people read and listen to - take control of what children learn in school. 7. Religion - Remove the belief in the God from government and schools.8. Class Warfare - Divide the people into the wealthy and the poor. This will cause more discontent, and will be easier to take (tax) the wealthy with the support of the poor.But the one that they missed, that George Orwell didn't miss in his book, "1984", was first control the media! With the news media we have today that is totally being controlled to write only stories that "Big Brother" corporate elites and the corrupt politicians want, we become in effect brainwashed by their 24 hour bombardment of "news"! Right now our only salvation is Facebook and the other internet sites that we can share info with! But here is the bottom line as we have seen with the shutting down of Wikileaks we are in real danger of losing credible news sources! So recently, I put out two most compelling posts about the corruption in our government and I ask you these questions: Where is the news media? Why aren't Congress and the FBI investigating the Whitehouse and its role in operating dirty tricks on the Trump campaign and at its rallies? Why would the news media not allow the American People access to Wikileaks? They say that Russia is trying to influence our election well what about the fact that Russia got 20% of our Uranium by colluding with the Clinton Foundation? We are at a crossroad in our country and if we don't act now we will not have our country any longer! As the song says "You don't know what you got until it's gone"! Wake up and Vote for Trump, he is our only hope to rid our country of the stinking rotten corruption!If you don't know who George Soros is. Who Saul Alinsky was. What Agenda 21 or Agenda 30 is, and what Cloward-Piven means... educate yourself.

Not as this example as we see in this article:Evidence reason Bakari Sellers' DUI charge droppedLaDonna BeekerApr 8, 2013 05:16 PMCHESTER COUNTY, SC (WIS) - Evidence in a state representative's driving under the influence case allowed him to plea to a lesser charge.    State Rep. Bakari Sellers was charged with DUI on Oct. 7 when he was traveling north on Interstate 77 just after 1 a.m. from a South Carolina football game, where he admitted to deputies he was drinking alcohol. Sellers refused a breath test, resulting in an automatic six-month driver's license suspension. His license was reinstated in February by a judicial panel.However, Sellers will not see any more consequences from the DUI charge because video surveillance from the deputy's patrol car did not match the date on Sellers' ticket. Because the evidence did not flow, it could not hold up in court.Sellers was allowed to plead guilty to reckless driving and pay a $475 fine. Court documents show he signed an affidavit April 1 acknowledging his guilt to the lesser charge."I am very pleased to have been cleared of all alcohol-related charges from my traffic stop in Chester County last fall," Sellers said in a statement released Friday.He takes "full responsibility" for his actions and admitted he was too tired to drive."I apologize and will do my best to set a better example for our youth and to continue to move South Carolina forward," Sellers said." I don't think he should explain properness when he is so drunk with words against a person that stands for America! As unbelievably, there is shocking videos on the net of his DUI arrest! TRUMP 2016

6 | Henrik Ahlm | 2 | 10154809106344729_10154809240759729 | If you think Trump wants to fight for working-class Americans you are very ignorant and naive!Trump is scared shitless if he becomes President.  Talking with his communication advisor on the phone I said I knew all along that he really never wanted to be President.A bit later the same day Trump was briefly on the line saying in a very tired soft voice "Mr. Ahlm thank, thank you so much!" I understood all along that Trump is not an intelligent guy - so I took the opportunity to lecture him. I told him "Americans live in class-zoned communities. Class identity is measured by education and breeding, including the way people dress and speak, the car they drive, the neighborhood they live in aso. Trump, you are a sick pathological liar, who exploit the discontents of the ordinary voter". "Is it so obvious, Mr. Ahlm", Trump asked with a vague voice. "Yes", I answered. Trump was very emotional so in order to calm him down I explained that he should vote for Hillary on Tuesday cause people from the future have of course already analyzed the outcome. Once again he uttered "Thank you, oh thank you Mr. Ahlm.An astute observer wrote in 1924 that American voters preferred to “cherish the unrealities they have absorbed” based upon “the primal instinct to defeat the side they hate or fear.” Trump is a proponent for hatred –a simple creature of a rigged class system in America.Fact is that Hillary will become the 45th President of the United States of America and America will slowly but surely regain her greatness. Hillary hasn't got brass balls but she's got the guts, experience and intelligence to make America great again. God bless.Ps.: An interesting book these days is "White Trash: The 400-Year Untold History of Class in America" by Nancy Isenberg.
