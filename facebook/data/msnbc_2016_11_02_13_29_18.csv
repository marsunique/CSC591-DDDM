Will Democrats win control of the Senate? Here's what major pollsters are predicting.

1 | Darrick Ensey | 67 | 1339827012780214_1339828702780045 | All we have to do is Vote in large numbers... But that's not enough, get your reliably Democratic friends and family to the polls. No excuses. Remind them of Supreme Court Justices and how we want to keep America moving forward and not allow bigotry and resistance to progress rule our country. Hillary can't accomplish anything on her own, she needs a Congress that will DO IT'S JOB. #Forward #VoteBlue
2 | Coleman Leitch | 6 | 1339827012780214_1339832649446317 | Can someone with better math skills than myself explain something? If 28% of democratic support has already voted, easily outpacing republicans, wouldn't the polls tighten due to a smaller sample of democratic likely voters?
3 | Sharon Diane | 5 | 1339827012780214_1339839019445680 | I really feel sad about those folks out there who think that Hillary Clinton's opponent will honor his "promises" to them. This is a man who couldn't honor his promises he made to his first two wives, who didn't honor his promises to those who were supposed to be paid for work done for him, including his current pollster firm and all those who never got paid for their work when he declared bankruptcy 6 times, who failed to keep his promises to investors in his business dealings multiple times (most recently with his Taj Mahal casino), who has not given the 100 million dollars toward his own campaign as he had  promised he would, did not give the money he publicly promised to various charities on his Apprentice show, etc etc.

7 | Timothy Reents | 5 | 1339827012780214_1339837316112517 | The bar is so low for the cry baby GOP losers who chase story's of weiners, not winners.Untrustworthy GOP. Using fake polls, fake newspapers, fake news stories, trolls from all over the world to sell your propaganda... all the while Putin is building a new, much larger, KGB force....  Well seems really really UNTRUSTWORTHY GOP!The number of GOP campaign staff that have active criminal investigations is growing fast! Thank you GOP for being the law and order guys, making it so easy to bring these "fringe individuals and groups" , both foreign and domestic,  out of the darkness and into the light of law enforcement.  I however would not support an amnesty deal for you GOPers in the process.

1 | Jose L. Martinez | 79 | 1339785446117704_1339786222784293 | Donald Trump is a pathological liar ensnared in his own fraudulant trap. He's a con and a criminal and needs to be arrested and imprisoned for his crimes against students at his fake U, employees who've never been paid, fraudulant contract victims, and stealing from his fake foundation to pays his own legal bills. You and I would be arrested and he needs to be as well. NOW!

Trump should never ever come near the White House
3 | John McCarthy | 20 | 1339785446117704_1339794236116825 | I'm 62 y/o and have lived in the DC metro area a long time. Politicians are everywhere around here. I have never seen such a corrupt con of a politician as Hillary ,and Bill too ,in all my lifetime. And I have lived through Nixon Watergate, Reagan Iran-Contra Affair, Bill Clinton perjury impeachment and adultery in the WH, and Cheney and Bush WMD con job. Hillary is the Queen of Corruption in my book. Simply unbelievable with her history.

5 | Chad Bowering | 8 | 1339785446117704_1339807696115479 | I am curious to those who call Hillary a liar. I challenge someone to tell me 20 lies in the past 6 months without the Benghazi and emails. And i bet you would have a hard time to think of one. You say she lies when her mouth is moving i think trump lies every minute of every day.  I can not believe this election for Americans it looks like an election for Russia where if you don't vote trump you will be punched.

But sells women and young girls like cattle at auction as sex slaves. She then gives them weapons both hard & chemical/biological in exchange for the large donations. Yeah trump's a chauvinist - but seriously? in Comparision - that's nothing.

You know that she is a lying, corrupt, racist that has no soul. She is a rapist and pedophile. Her acts are treasonous and by supporting her you condone her actions.

15 | Mary Linderberg | 1 | 1339785446117704_1339815762781339 | By Gary Hostetler:  I asked a young  Lady at a game, how she could vote for Trump, a “misogynist, a racist and a bigot”. Here is her answer: Because I use my head to research and find out what candidates really are, not what the media wants me to think.  Because Donald Trump has more women in executive and managerial positions than any comparable company, which tells me he is not a misogynist.  Because he pays these women the same or more than their male counterparts, which tells me looks for capacity and skills in people, not color, gender or race.  Because he fought the West Palm Beach City Council to be able to open his newly purchased club, so he could include blacks and Jews as members, who had been banned until then. This tells me he is not a racist.  Because he has raised wonderful children who have turned out to be outstanding, hard-working and compassionate adults. He must be doing something right.  Because his economic plans makes sense, are conservative in nature, and I vote based of what is best for my family, my friends and my country.  Because everybody, the left and the right are afraid of him, the media is trying to destroy his image, and even foreign governments are voicing their opinions, so he must be doing something right. Clean house maybe?  Because I want a Supreme Court that will uphold the Constitution, not behave as minions of the administration.  I have had enough with judges who are more like political activists than law enforcers.    Because I fear for my family’s safety if the current trend of not confronting blatant terrorism continues – which is a threat to our way of life.  Because I am fed up with the rampant corruption of this administration.  Accountability in government is paramount, and as this administration has demonstrated, it is a foreign concept to them.  Because I am fed up with the political correctness gone wild, and because Trump is not afraid to say what everybody thinks but does not dare to say. A thug is a thug, regardless of color, and that's it.  Because it is about time someone puts America's interests ahead of other countries.  Because I know he recognizes and embraces America's exceptionalism, and will not tour the World apologizing for who we are. That tells me he is a patriot.  Because, unlike HRC, he has actually held a job, worked hard and achieved success.  And last, but not least, because I am more offended by what Hillary does than by what Trump says.

Some say Trump is because he is was not a politician and Hillary had her woes as one. Others say Hillary because Trump has a questionable business, womanizing tax evasion and racial discrimination past. It all boils down to whose character and plan for American we like the best, and while many of our opinions are clouded by racism, sexism, political affiliation and partiality, we must not lose focus on what matters. It's not who has lived a perfect life in their past because none of us are without sin or mistakes, but who do we trust to hold the future of our country and children in mind while they make decisions in office. Hillary is use to being accountable to the people, while Trump is use to being accountable to no one, not even his wives, and that's dangerous. We must choose wisely !

25 | Joe Juste | 0 | 1339741016122147_1339773872785528 | Even the devil was once an angel before he went rogue on GOD!  Does the fact that Republicans refused to vote on Garland's nomination, and the FBI's recent assault on voter will and the electoral process, have something in common? Since Clinton has been favored from the onset of this campaign, did the Corporate Right Establishment plan the "October Surprise" with the FBI all along? Is it because they thought they could upset the electoral process at the last moment, sufficiently to throw this election, that they thought they would be in a position to appoint even more radically corporate right Court judges than Garland, and therefore refused to vote on Garland's nomination because of that?

In a striking split from running mate Gary Johnson, Bill Weld said he was "vouching" for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Deb Hartogensis Godden | 462 | 1339687446127504_1339688632794052 | Weld is more of an "old-style" Republican . . . that is, relatively open-minded and with concern for country over party ideology.
2 | Todd Stoilov | 286 | 1339687446127504_1339690646127184 | More power to him. He knows what's at stake and that this is not time to play games. Listen to him, he is the better half on the Libertarians ticket, the one with a brain.
3 | Josh Smith | 98 | 1339687446127504_1339688829460699 | AKA: I just came to senses and realized Gary is an embarrassment. Why did I run with him? We got no chance, so you know what? I'm with her, I guess..
4 | Cheryl Brady | 89 | 1339687446127504_1339688279460754 | Weld can carry on an intelligent conversation, unlike Johnson. And his decision is a wise one.
5 | Cliff Davis | 57 | 1339687446127504_1339701079459474 | Mr. Weld will emerge after this election as one of the few true leaders in the republican party. Along with Mr. Kasich they will have a lot of rebuilding to do.
6 | Monica Andi | 55 | 1339687446127504_1339688836127365 | Without the minority vote and 91% white voters I have a better chance of winning the lotto than Trump winning The White House Plain and Simple❗️#ImWithNastyWoman
7 | Brenda Cooper | 28 | 1339687446127504_1339705312792384 | Don't know much about this guy, but was really impressed with his interview, he actually seemed to have the countries best interest in all that he said, not how he could line his own pockets or just going along with the repubs to stay in office--our country should always come first 👏👏👏
8 | Scott Herman | 22 | 1339687446127504_1339705786125670 | Yeah! As we run into this final stretch in the 2016 vote, I wanted to make a post that helps to keep people on target since this is such an important election. Let’s think about the recent Brexit vote that is forcing the United Kingdom to exit the European Union, for a moment. In that vote, people made a protest vote against staying in the Union because they didn’t think that it would really happen. The Result, many Millennial Voters desperately want to take their vote back, saying that they were not being serious. In the 1980’s Carter was up by 8 points in the polls, people did not come out to vote because they thought that he had it beat. In the 2000 election, people were not thrilled about Al Gore, thinking that he was too much of a bore, and not a strong candidate. Many Liberals voted for Ralph Nader instead of Al Gore, and handed George Bush Jr. a razor thin victory that resulted in a disastrous 8 years. Listen People, I understand that it really looks like Hillary has this all sewn up. Trust me when I say that she doesn’t. It is not over until the last vote is counted.  She may not be your candidate that you are willing to stand on railroad tracks to get elected, she may not be your perfect choice for President, BUTIf history tells us anything, it is that we should never take anything for granted. This election needs to be won by Hillary Clinton. It is not enough to say that Hillary Needs to be President, but that she needs to win by such a huge margin so we never have to see Trump, or anyone like Trump, on the ballot ever again. We need to retake Congress. We need to vote blue for all Congressmen and Senators so we can retake the House and Senate. We need to put a stop to this crazy Republican right wing insanity that has gripped our government for years because of blind racism and stupidity. Get out there, Vote, get your Friends and Family to vote. Stop the insanity!!!!Please share would like to reach as many people as I canPlease vote early if you can't
9 | Charles Baldon | 3 | 1339687446127504_1339796679449914 | Donald Trump, the King of Bankruptcy, professional conman, draft dodger, tax cheat and sexual predator is a psychotic self-absorbed narcissist. His style of hate-mongering politics makes America look like a third world country. The fact that he is even being considered for president is shameful. Vote Blue!!!!!!
10 | David Michael | 1 | 1339687446127504_1339740529455529 | Jordanna Banks and Christopher Brian.  I watched this guy say Hillary Clinton is a person who is honest and basically endorses her last night.  And the johnson-weld ticket is a joke and this is just another example of it
11 | Douglas Lawrence | 2 | 1339687446127504_1339709406125308 | He doesn't fear for the country enough to drop out of the race and denounce Gary Johnson. To me is just as bad as the Republican Party voting for Trump.
12 | Patricia Lowry | 2 | 1339687446127504_1339710346125214 | Then why the hell did you run with Johnson. YOU should have been backing Hillary instead of dissing her.Now you see your mistake, HOPE it is not too little ,too late.
13 | Bruce Keller | 8 | 1339687446127504_1339702696125979 | Donald Trump is 1000 percent correct by calling Hillary Clinton "crooked Hillary".

17 | Diana Patton Price | 2 | 1339687446127504_1339736489455933 | Kenneth Starr, Who Tried to Bury Bill Clinton, Now Only Praises Him"An unlikely voice recently bemoaned the decline of civility in presidential politics, warned that “deep anger” was fueling an “almost radical populism” and sang the praises of former President Bill Clinton — particularly his “redemptive” years of philanthropic work since leaving the White House.The voice was that of Kenneth W. Starr, the former Whitewater independent counsel, whose Javert-like pursuit of Mr. Clinton in the 1990s helped bring a new intensity to partisan warfare and led to the impeachment of a president for only the second time in the nation’s history.The presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Donald J. Trump, increasingly seems to be trying to relitigate the scandals that Mr. Starr investigated, dredging up allegations of sexual transgressions by Mr. Clinton to accuse Hillary Clinton — the likely Democratic nominee — of having aided and enabled her husband at the expense of Mr. Clinton’s female accusers.But Mr. Starr expressed regret last week that so much of Mr. Clinton’s legacy remained viewed through the lens of what Mr. Starr demurely termed “the unpleasantness.”His remarks seemed almost to absolve Mr. Clinton, if not to exonerate him..."http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/25/us/politics/ken-starr-impeachment-bill-clinton.html?_r=0

20 | April Luebke Winn | 0 | 1339687446127504_1339829742779941 | I asked a young  Lady at a game, how she could vote for Trump, a “misogynist, a racist and a bigot”. Here is her answer: Because I use my head to research and find out what candidates really are, not what the media wants me to think.  Because Donald Trump has more women in executive and managerial positions than any comparable company, which tells me he is not a misogynist.  Because he pays these women the same or more than their male counterparts, which tells me looks for capacity and skills in people, not color, gender or race.  Because he fought the West Palm Beach City Council to be able to open his newly purchased club, so he could include blacks and Jews as members, who had been banned until then. This tells me he is not a racist.  Because he has raised wonderful children who have turned out to be outstanding, hard-working and compassionate adults. He must be doing something right.  Because his economic plans makes sense, are conservative in nature, and I vote based of what is best for my family, my friends and my country.  Because everybody, the left and the right are afraid of him, the media is trying to destroy his image, and even foreign governments are voicing their opinions, so he must be doing something right. Clean house maybe?  Because I want a Supreme Court that will uphold the Constitution, not behave as minions of the administration.  I have had enough with judges who are more like political activists than law enforcers.    Because I fear for my family’s safety if the current trend of not confronting blatant terrorism continues – which is a threat to our way of life.  Because I am fed up with the rampant corruption of this administration.  Accountability in government is paramount, and as this administration has demonstrated, it is a foreign concept to them.  Because I am fed up with the political correctness gone wild, and because Trump is not afraid to say what everybody thinks but does not dare to say. A thug is a thug, regardless of color, and that's it.  Because it is about time someone puts America's interests ahead of other countries.  Because I know he recognizes and embraces America's exceptionalism, and will not tour the World apologizing for who we are. That tells me he is a patriot.  Because, unlike HRC, he has actually held a job, worked hard and achieved success.  And last, but not least, because I am more offended by what Hillary does than by what Trump says.shared from Gary Hostetler.

25 | Kimmeth Powell | 0 | 1339687446127504_1339800796116169 | I prefer him vastly to Johnson, I still detest their platform because I think it would be disastrous but he has more of a chance to overcome that than his running mate. He is more "old school" Republican, as another here has said, he still places country over party.

1 | Sue Hecht | 344 | 1339639156132333_1339640582798857 | Here's a good rule of thumb, never vote for the person the KKK supports. nor a child rapist, sexual predator, someone who does not pay his workers or lawyers, and tax evader
2 | Walter C. Brown | 109 | 1339639156132333_1339644942798421 | Donald goes go to court in November for bilking hard working Americans out of their money by fraud. That's public record. And Trump does also go to court this December for child rape. That too is public record. In fact there are 76 pending court cases against Trump right now. He leaves a path of destruction wherever he goes. You know what is exceedingly telling that one person who worked with him for 2 years as a ghost writer of one of his books just pointed out in an interview? Trump has no friends. He has no grade school friends. He has no college friends. He has no business friends. More often than not people who leave his employ hate him. People who he's done other business deals with disrespect him. That's weird. That speaks volumes about his poor character. The only people willing to speak on Donald's behalf are his paid pundits, people who think they might get a White House job if he wins (i.e. Christie) and his kids (who are also on his payroll). Evidently he doesn't just say hateful things at his bambastic rallies .... he just is a HATEFUL PERSON.
3 | Claudia Beiger | 95 | 1339639156132333_1339645792798336 | I refuse to believe it will be even close. I actually have more faith in our country than to think people are actually voting for that Trump idiot.
4 | Regina Dear | 41 | 1339639156132333_1339656439463938 | He must be so proud..."Not all Donald Trump supporters are white supremacists, but all white supremacists appear to be Donald Trump supporters. The Ku Klux Klan gave their blessing, officially endorsing Donald Trump on the front page of their latest newspaper edition. You must be so proud, Republicans. Just today, Congressman Paul Ryan admitted he already voted for Donald Trump in his home state of Wisconsin. That’s a racist, misogynistic stink that won’t wear off in 2020, Congressman. Even if you can’t bear to say his name out loud. "...
5 | Rachel Anne Osborn Martin | 25 | 1339639156132333_1339653892797526 | The run away Trumpmania Train is close to running this country off the cliff. One item making it closer is increase in healthcare premiums because Republican eroded some of the measures designed to offset these. They did it to sabotage it for political gain. Now we are paying the price. They say they will repeal which will end insurance for 2 million people. If you think that will stop the rising cost of healthcare which is the real driver of premiums you will be disappointed. Repeal is not going to magically reduce premiums. It will mean insurance only for those who are well off.
6 | Frankie T Inzinna | 31 | 1339639156132333_1339673279462254 | The polls can tighten all they want 30 million people already voted and Hillary is doing fine and if the Florida early voting results are true and she's goin to win 28% of republicans the election is over. Trump can't win with out Florida. So they will be a Madam president elect this time next week. The polls don't mean anything any more
7 | Ssenabulya Dan | 30 | 1339639156132333_1339639809465601 | Trumpeters talking about 'draining the swamp' but planning to vote for someone who is hiding his taxes, has a fraud court case this month, a rape case hearing, brags about sexual assault and has 12 women accusing him of the same, loves to grab women by the p*ssy and has been endorsed by the KKK? Crazy!! #Trumpeterlogic
8 | David Jude Thomas | 1 | 1339639156132333_1339778979451684 | Michael Moore is very correct!!!! I've been saying this for the past year. I've also said, continually, that Trump will continue his election plans while all the other pundits dismissed him. Between his umpteen years pretended to be president on his NBC show, entering the political field by claiming that Obama was not  born in this country, he was primed for his latest "role ". Also going after the bottom feeders of society, he was set to challenge any appointment. Now with the vague letter to Congress from Comey.... he very well might wind up being the 45th president of the United States. To quote the tagline of the 1980s remake of the fly; "Be afraid be very afraid"!!!!
9 | Helen Vizcarrondo | 17 | 1339639156132333_1339644976131751 | WikiLeaks proves that Hillary Clinton knew that Anthony Weiner was sexting underage girls for at least (five years) yet she did (nothing) to stop him.This is someone who stands up for woman & children?!You've got to be kidding me!
10 | Dave Furstenau | 5 | 1339639156132333_1339663399463242 | What is the mystery?She has low approval numbers because no one likes her. She has high electoral chances of winning because the few people who like her are strategically placed on the electoral map. This isn't rocket science.
11 | Julia Cram | 3 | 1339639156132333_1339701786126070 | One good thing that came out of this election is that now we know where we stand in this Country, can't hide it anymore, we know who is who, even with our friends and family.. Everyone 'came out'
12 | Margaret Steinhoff | 2 | 1339639156132333_1339816769447905 | This is also how I feel. It's almost over for me.  Dear Mr. Trump, It’s taken me a while to realize this and to admit it, but I’m grateful to you. For the past few months I’ve spent a good deal of time lamenting your campaign and the poison it has so effortlessly generated. I’ve watched our country imploding, our public discourse become polluted, our political climate grows ever more corrosive, and wrongly assumed you were to blame. It’s only lately I’ve come to understand that you haven’t manufactured our current national ugliness—you’ve simply revealed it. By saying the irresponsible, mean-spirited, ignorant things you say so freely and so frequently, you’ve given other like-minded people license to do the same. You’ve opened up the floodgates for our corporate sewage to flow fully. People no longer conceal their vile mess, they now revel in it, they broadcast it and retweet it. You’ve made bigotry and racism socially acceptable again and that has been a kind of twisted gift because it’s allowed me to really see people; not as they pretend to be on the surface—but in the very depths of their wounded, weaponized hearts. Over and over as your campaign has persisted, your supporters would tell me that they like you because you “speak your mind”. It wasn’t until recently that I’ve realized that you speak their minds. You’ve given credence to their prejudices and made those prejudices go mainstream. Thanks to the terrible ground you’ve broken, politicians, pastors, friends, and strangers, both in person and on social media now regularly out themselves as hateful, intolerant, and malicious—and they remind me just how close they are to me, just how deep the sickness in us runs, and just how far we have to go together. You’ve emboldened people to be open about things they used to conceal for the sake of decorum, and though it turns my stomach, I know that this is the only way we can move forward; to have that cancerous stuff exposed fully so that it can be dealt with. Our progress as a nation is predicated on authentic dialogue, no matter how brutal and disheartening that dialogue is. In other words, you’ve let us know what we’re really dealing with here and while it’s been rightly disturbing, it’s also been revelatory. That’s the thing about that kind of harsh light: you’re forced to see everything. Beauty and monstrosity equally illuminated. Now don’t get me wrong, I think you’re the least qualified, least knowledgeable Presidential candidate we may ever have had participate this far into the process, and if you somehow were elected I’d fear gravely for the world my children would inherit—should it survive your Presidency at all. I believe you’re reckless, bitter, and completely reprehensible; the very worst kind of bully. But whether you win or lose, you’ve already allowed me the blessing of Truth; about me, about you, about other candidates, about our nation. And in the process you’ve also shown me that I am not alone in resisting you and this ugly thing you’ve revealed about us. You’ve generated an equally loud, equally passionate response to it and this is where I find my hope these days. I find it in those for whom equality isn’t just a cheap buzzword, it’s the most precious of hills to die on. I find it in those people who refuse to be silent in the face of our impending shared regression. I find it in those willing to be bolder in defending the inherent value of all people. I find it in the growing army of those who will not tolerate hatred as a core American value. I find it in those who reject violence as our default response to dissension. I find it in the ever rising voice of people who will not let malice and bitterness represent them in the world. Today I find my hope in those who, like me, will not be complicit in allowing bigotry and intolerance to become a source of national pride, because we’ve seen where that leads. Yes, Mr Trump, you’ve unearthed our hidden sickness and you’ve allowed it to go viral. You brought every awful thing about us out into the open. You will NEVER Get My Vote!
13 | Diane Mancuso | 7 | 1339639156132333_1339689409460641 | I hope you're right and there isn't another parallel to Brexit....people voted without thinking about the consequences....Trump is the scum of the earth....they are trying to vote again in GB...there is no re-voting if this creep gets elected...
14 | Sascha Eisner | 3 | 1339639156132333_1339709699458612 | MISOGYNY is when the male candidate has a university fraud trial date in November, a child rape trial date in December, 73 other pending lawsuits, BUT the media focus is on emails the female candidate didn't even send.
15 | Pamela Otti | 6 | 1339639156132333_1339656712797244 | But lets not forget about bill and his sexual adventures when he was president. Let's not forget about hillary and the men killed in Benghazi. Clinton's are corrupt and think only of themselves not Americans.

Especially if you win Tuesday. We will never accept you as our President. You and your husband are nothing but criminals and will be treated as such. You will never bring this country together because your existence in the political arena is a major reason we are divided in the first place. We will never get behind you. We will treat your proposals and ideas the same way you would treat an 8 month old fetus... we will rip them apart every time. You will go down in history as exactly what you truly are, nothing but a nasty disgusting excuse for a woman.
18 | Rosemary Lucas-Olsen | 1 | 1339639156132333_1339776279451954 | Michael, shut the hell up. I am done with this election. Donald can go back to his miserable life and my stress level can finally go to it's former 7 rating.
19 | Tammy Mohr Burt | 5 | 1339639156132333_1339665206129728 | I was asked tonight how I could ever support Trump after the comments he made over 11 years ago about women and if I would still support him if he made those comments to my daughter? My response was this....If he had put our nations security at risk, I would not vote for him. If his organization received large donations from countries that killed women and gays, I would not vote for him. If he boasted 30 Years of government experience, but still could not discern if an email was classified or not, without someone letting him know if it was or not, I would not vote for him. If he boasted about how he has defended children his entire life, but is for abortion, (even late term, when the child can feel pain) I would not vote for him. If he wanted my 3 year old Granddaughter to go to restrooms with men dressed as women, I would not vote for him. I have taught my daughter and will teach my granddaughter to disregard sexist remarks and move on, especially when they were made so many years ago and, also to forgive those who say they are sorry. If he caused lives to be destroyed in Benghazi and then lied to the faces of the parents as they stood at their child's casket, I would not vote for him. If people who came against him mysteriously turned up dead, I would not vote for him. If he suddenly developed a southern accent when he was in the South, campaigning, I would not vote for him. If he continually broke the law and that was ignored, I would not vote for him, but right now, the only person who does all these things is Hillary. Right now, the fact that Donald made these remarks over 12 years ago, does not move me. I'm bigger than those remarks and we all have said stupid things throughout our lives. To me, the fact that Hillary lies continuously, is a much bigger problem. We can see the effects of her lies by the state of our poor country right now...Still voting for Trump
20 | Frank Ramirez | 0 | 1339639156132333_1339779756118273 | He just wants to make another movie, if you ever notice Moore has to inject himself in the presidential race even when no one is asking for his opinion. This is the same man who predicted a Romney victory in 2012! Stop using him as some kind of political expert.

24 | George Dreger | 4 | 1339639156132333_1339647929464789 | If you like the way things are the way they are headed in this country. If you’d like to continue the destruction of our manufacturing base, and the jobs that went with it. If you like the uncontrollable immigration, if you like the string of stupid wars from Iraq to Libya to Syria. If you want to say yes to all of that, if you want to keep this all the way it is, fine, then vote for Hillary Clinton. If you don’t like the way things are headed you got a chance to really shake the system the system at its roots. If you wake up on Election Day and it’s the same as it is today, if its the same 4 or 5 or 8 years from now, remember you had a chance to  really change it up
25 | Soraya Ramireza | 7 | 1339639156132333_1339641382798777 | Hillary is causing a constitutional crisis. She's made such a huge mess of everything here and abroad. Even the Clinton FNDTN is now under investigation. Come is independent. Hillary will NOT be able to govern. This is what the DNC gets for rigging the primaries. Hillary is morally bankrupt. She is DONE!!

Donald Trump's campaign is making moves into Democratic states, but is it a strategy borne out of strength or desperation?

1 | Merv Russell | 138 | 1339602779469304_1339608689468713 | And yet Trump will NEVER have the majority  Black vote, Hispanic vote, LGBT vote, woman, Asian vote, Native American vote or educated vote!  So tell me again how it's close? That's the media's way of keeping you watching. Just vote!
2 | Storm King | 89 | 1339602779469304_1339604722802443 | Russia has Trump in it's back pocket. The polls are getting closer to even. Trump is an egomaniacal, narcissistic toddler with a bad tan. If he wins, a large number of people are going to be clinically depressed for a long time. Do not vote for the candidate supported by the KKK
3 | John Robinson | 70 | 1339602779469304_1339604489469133 | Six more days until the Great Trumpkin Meltdown of 2016. Six more days before Trump's head explodes like forgetting to put the lid on the blender when you made an orange smoothie. Six more days until we elect our FIRST female president. Six more days until this year and a half national nightmare is OVER!
4 | Javon Coleman | 28 | 1339602779469304_1339605216135727 | Definitely desperation. He still needs to win most of if not all of the current swing states or turn some blue ones red. So yea he has his work cut out for him lol.
5 | Jean Regenwether | 23 | 1339602779469304_1339618642801051 | Sexual assault, fraud, taxes, foundation,bankruptcy, eminent domain, hiring illegals, sending products overseas to be made, using illegal steel from China, bigotry, racism, did I miss anything. The man is not fit for office.
6 | Rhonda Wilkins | 16 | 1339602779469304_1339606356135613 | Trump will only care about ANY of his own money that he might have wasted on the campaign he has no problem spending other people's money
7 | Anthony Greenlees | 11 | 1339602779469304_1339608002802115 | Cannot and will not in good conscience vote for someone with such a lengthy unethical record. This woman has proven herself to be a habitual and consistent liar. A woman who breaks the law by scrubbing documents during an investigation but no of course she has nothing to hide. Accepting money from Kings. Saudi Arabia and Morocco plus countless other countries. She views the American people as pawns and ingrates. If she didn't she would not hide her dealings like a child and then get angry when wiki shows the American people just how sneaky she really is. She is not Presidential material. She is prison material. By all means vote for someone who LET people die. Vote for someone that cares more about her foundation than your safety. After all National Security means nothing to her. By her actions and the LAW she is not fit and therefore should be imprisoned and the #1 domestic terrorist.
8 | Je Deg | 12 | 1339602779469304_1339610129468569 | News Flash ! In an early voting poll Donald Trump, Ivanka, Melania and suprisingly Kelly Anne Conway voted early for Hillary Clinton. They even voted BLUE down ballot. Wow !
9 | Bronia Wroblewska-Potts | 5 | 1339602779469304_1339621249467457 | The polls arent worth anything.. voting is what counts. And the media wants to be relevant so I dont believe half of the crap they say ..she is 15 points above, no she is 2 points above, now she is even with Trump no now he is ahead....wait no she is double digits ahead... And this is the crap we get..and each newspaper comes up with half a dozen different scenarios within the course of a few hours.. They have stopped reporting news a long time ago and just go for ratings by being tabloid type papers.. The headlines they post usually bear little to no resemblance to the actual story.

A disgusting con man who surrounds himself with a disgusting corrupt people. Putin's puppet ! Corrupt little man whose daughter vacations with Putin's girlfriend.Making Russia great again? Now think and think again. Don't use your hatred to cloud your judgment ! Be wise and save your country. I'M WITH HER
11 | Barbara Roney | 4 | 1339602779469304_1339650719464510 | School children across America voted in their classrooms yesterday. They voted for the next President and Hillary Clinton won.  The children have been selecting the winner in the last three years. Children usually vote the way their parents do, so hopefully they are right again this election. Go Hillary.

It's just the desperation that I'm seeing by the Democratic Party that makes me just want to laugh. A lot of the mainstream news media are desperately doing whatever they can to tarnish Donald Trumps reputation and throw him in the limelight and get the limelight off Hillary Clinton. Every time they do it they just look desperate and pathetic. You can't make this stuff up people. 😂😂😂.
18 | JR Campbell | 0 | 1339602779469304_1339798419449740 | The media wants an audience.. They want everyone to think its close.. It may very well be, who knows.. After Romneys defeat last election, and the media claiming it was 'close', its hard to know who to believe.. Polls are only as good as the sample, and the data set the conclusions are drawn from, the statistics used, and involves more analysis than is obvious..   One day, Trump is supposed to lose by a landslide, a few days later, he has a good chance to win.. There cant possibly that much indecision, that many that are really undecided.. Has a lot to do with demographics, turn out.. Many republicans I know are not going to vote for Trump or Hillary.. With the minority voter suppression,  college ID's  not acceptable, closing of minority voting locations, and cutting down early voting days, who knows.. The election might very well be 'rigged', but by the republicans..And Comey's and the FBI getting illegally involved in the election, Trump has a chance.. Its frightening and disturbing..

I find it in those for whom equality isn’t just a cheap buzzword, it’s the most precious of hills to die on. I find it in those people who refuse to be silent in the face of our impending shared regression. I find it in those willing to be bolder in defending the inherent value of all people. I find it in the growing army of those who will not tolerate hatred as a core American value. I find it in those who reject violence as our default response to dissension. I find it in the ever rising voice of people who will not let malice and bitterness represent them in the world. Today I find my hope in those who, like me, will not be complicit in allowing bigotry and intolerance to become a source of national pride, because we’ve seen where that leads. Yes, Mr Trump, you’ve unearthed our hidden sickness and you’ve allowed it to go viral. You brought every awful thing about us out into the open. You will NEVER Get My Vote!
20 | Al Snook | 0 | 1339602779469304_1339710032791912 | Neither. This move is only designed to keep the Media talking about Dangerous Donald all day, all the time.Every move he makes is aimed at keeping his face on tv.  The media dutifully follows his lead. No more reasoning behind it than that.Just think, how would he maintain his tv ego, if he were President. What idiotic things would he pull to get media attention every day.Certainly Presidential press conferences with those dreaded questions would not be in the mix. That is unless he bans all reporters.
21 | Joel Natale | 2 | 1339602779469304_1339610086135240 | Obama received 67 million votes - hillary will get only around 55 million. She is 20 million short in black/Hispanic/young/gay voters. She gets about 8 million extra females --55 million total!  Romney received 62 million votes - Trump gets 1 million more blacks than Romney, 4 million more Christians ( since he's ot Mormon ) but loses 5 million women. Trump ends up with 62 million votes.... 7 million vote WIN FOR TRUMP
22 | Kelly Higgins | 0 | 1339602779469304_1339727326123516 | Omg! Are you guys standing with your heads stuck in the sand??? Hillary Clinton is under FBI investigation for the 2nd time! 5 of her affiliates are also under investigation. Wake up!! You will be so sorry if you elect her.

25 | Nick Cain | 0 | 1339602779469304_1339627746133474 | Msnbc has the most ridiculous headlines. Haha. "Donald Trump campaigning in blue states. But is this a sound strategy, or is he just looking for liberal women to rape?"And we all know which option msnbc viewers will choose to believe. Haha.

The reality is that Hillary Clinton's  chances of winning have hardly changed from last week.

1 | Tefo K. Linchwe | 185 | 1339569309472651_1339573156138933 | What i know is that she will win without any doubt! The day i will be finishing my mid terms! Yes...#withher! And i take accountability for everything with her!
2 | Kj Eastman | 122 | 1339569309472651_1339591739470408 | Anyone who does the research with an open mind will discover that secretary Clinton has been subjected to one of the greatest character assassinations of all time and history will show this.
3 | Jay Maher | 228 | 1339569309472651_1339572109472371 | I would trust PeeWee Herman sitting behind me in a movie theater while out on a date with O J Simpson, drinking at Bill Cosby's bar with Flint Michigan ice cubes, after taking elevator rides with Ray Rice, all while Casey Anthony babysits for me before I would trust HER to walk my dog!!!      #DrainTheSwamp
4 | Maria Rodriguez Klimka | 65 | 1339569309472651_1339580889471493 | The reality is that you can repeat a bunch of lies over and over again about Hillary and all that it shows is the ignorance that Trump supporters are dealing with as they repeat his ignorant leader words...
5 | Johnny Meller | 153 | 1339569309472651_1339570236139225 | The reality is she is a crook, a liar.....also a scumbag who will never get elected.....anyone who thinks she is otherwise needs to see a doctor asap.
6 | Al Gi Carrillo | 32 | 1339569309472651_1339584542804461 | So, I am reading that Hillary is really upset that the FBI is "dumping" on her right before the election.... I want to say to Mrs. Clinton, "So Hillary, how does it feel to be aborted 8 days before delivery?" Stole that comment, but it is awesome!
7 | Wes Lewis | 64 | 1339569309472651_1339573219472260 | Dear Hillary supporters have a ? for you.Dear Hillary Supporter, Did you miss the part where she lied to congress? You know that’s called perjury…. Did you miss hearing about her being fired from the Watergate staff for being dishonest and unethical?How about those 33,000 emails she deleted and then had the computer wiped clean by professionals? Did you miss that? How about deleting emails after she was subpoenaed to hand them over to the Fed? You realize that’s Obstruction of Justice, right? Oh, and how about getting the rapist of a teenage girl off on rape charges then laughing about it? Did you miss that too?How about when she lied to the American people about Benghazi? You realize that story about the video was a lie, and she knew it was a lie, right?Did you miss her lying to the American people about her emails? How about when she lied about being under sniper fire?Well, then there was those times she lied about lying to the American people. Miss those too?What about that ‘pay for play’ with the Clinton Cash Foundation? That’s kind of hard to miss, huh?Did you miss all those other scandals she was in? You know… TravelGate, FileGate, WhiteWater, Rose law Firm, Vince Foster… she has a long list of scandals, you know... Did you miss her belittling her husband's sexual harassment ( and rape ) accusers? Oh – but the Paula Jones case was settled for $850,000 and Bill was impeached… for lying…You know she was labeled "Extremely careless" about national security by the FBI, right? Have you caught her latest lies about not knowing what the (C) meant on the classified documents? Or, that she can’t remember any briefings on how to handle classified material? Did you know that during her interview with the FBI she said she couldn’t remember 39 times? Did you know that during the Star Investigation she used that same defense of ‘I don’t recall’ 56 times? Did you hear her say she will raise taxes on the middle class? Did you know she had to return stolen items from the White House the last time they left? Did you miss the fact that her and Bill Clinton stole 6 Billion Dollars that was meant to rebuild Haiti?Have you seen the movies and several documentaries made about her questionable ethics? Don’t you wonder why she made congress and others spend millions and millions of tax dollars having hearings and investigating her numerous times, finding that she lied, that would not have been spent if she would have simply told the truth in the first place ! Facts - all facts ! But you are going to vote for her because.... you don't like Donald Trump?Now, That is Insane!Hillary Clinton has a lot more to hide than Donald Trump does!I will close by saying please don't forget to vote on November 8th for Donald J. Trump and make America Great Again!
8 | John Cano | 29 | 1339569309472651_1339612676134981 | If Hillary Clinton was the criminal they described you think she would have a charge, a conviction, some kind of sanction, given some kind of fine. There's nothing, not even a traffic ticket. She even disclosed her taxes. Which included her husbands taxes. The claims made against the Clinton's just don't amount to much nor do they come close to the life time of Donald Trumps transgressions. He actually stiffs people, outright lies, refuses to disclose his taxes. Between the two candidates dealings and temperament, experience, education I'm voting for Hillary Clinton.
9 | Rhonda Wilkins | 34 | 1339569309472651_1339574259472156 | Once again Mika and Joe and the crew are trying to convey how sketchy Hillary is that she is corrupt because of emails emails emails...is that it?? That's all they can say....come on...no one cares about f****** emails
10 | Bill Barnes | 20 | 1339569309472651_1339587052804210 | Good common sense says vote Blue Straight Through to get the obstructionist party out of our government so this country can move forward again
11 | Anthony Greenlees | 16 | 1339569309472651_1339577052805210 | Cannot and will not in good conscience vote for someone with such a lengthy unethical record. This woman has proven herself to be a habitual and consistent liar. A woman who breaks the law by scrubbing documents during an investigation but no of course she has nothing to hide. Accepting money from Kings. Saudi Arabia and Morocco plus countless other countries. She views the American people as pawns and ingrates. If she didn't she would not hide her dealings like a child and then get angry when wiki shows the American people just how sneaky she really is. She is not Presidential material. She is prison material. By all means vote for someone who LET people die. Vote for someone that cares more about her foundation than your safety. After all National Security means nothing to her. By her actions and the LAW she is not fit and therefore should be imprisoned and the #1 domestic terrorist.
12 | Janis Brian Farmer | 24 | 1339569309472651_1339574049472177 | If Trump becomes President...THINK HARD FOLKS!• The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.• The media has been neutered forever.• Career politicians will have lost all job security.• The guns in your home will safely stay there.• Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.• Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally• Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.• No more apologies to the world for being great!• Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.• Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.• There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.• The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.• The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.But,,I am so sorry to say,that Pres. Obummer and Lynch has granted illegals to get driver lic.and all they have to do is check yes I am a citizen there for they can voteat least 4 million of them are doingso and not enforcing the law.they also have found 10's of thousand of dead people also voting.Even as large of a movement is this,,I find it next to impossible for Donald Trump to win. pure corruption.
13 | Marion Rohling | 7 | 1339569309472651_902355859898266 | Let's not take anything for granted. I voted early here in Texas. Let's remember what America is about. Let's make sure our children can be proud of us standing against the hate campaign wielded against fellow Americans. Let's never forget our American spirit. I'm with her, a flawed human being who is still standing with us, even in the face of this vile hatred thrown at her.
14 | Dennis Cossiboon | 26 | 1339569309472651_1339572126139036 | Trump is for the people... all American Citizens.... Clinton says she's for all the minorities and women, but her stance is different to her donors... Trump has no donors.... Drain the Swamp of corruption in Washington... Hillary for Prison 2016.  Donald Trump, the law and order candidate!
15 | Carolyn Stevens | 22 | 1339569309472651_1339582669471315 | FYI: There is absolutely nothing Secretary Clinton could have done with e-mails that would convince me to vote for donald instead
16 | Richard Kelly | 7 | 1339569309472651_1339606716135577 | America may survive a Trump presidency but the era of the deplorables will leave a lasting stench on our history for the world to see.
17 | Connie Greene | 2 | 1339569309472651_902406096559909 | Looks like Hillary Clinton has always known what she is about. Those side chair analyses coming from the other side might well be better used tending to their own backyards.
18 | Jeanne Brooks-Miller | 3 | 1339569309472651_1339577322805183 | I just flipped the channel and Morning Joe is on...but I would like to know why MSNBC keeps Mika on...she does not know how to pronounce words which are not commonly used and she is just not a news anchor...at all...she is always turning to look at the camera when someone is talking and she is always looking behind her....surely MSNBC can find someone better.
19 | Tom Siskron IV | 3 | 1339569309472651_1339603439469238 | The headline of this is a SAD, SAD reflection of the state of our republic. That half of America would elect this obviously corrupt woman bent of destroying the constitution and our national sovereignty while enriching her personal coffers is diheartening for our future.
20 | Renee Smith | 9 | 1339569309472651_1339589549470627 | I am counting on my Spanish family too vote I don't want this idiot monster to send you back to Mexico vote my people we are stronger together.
21 | John Kelly | 3 | 1339569309472651_902412346559284 | The news media is going to make this race seem much closer than it actually is. For one big reason. It's $weeps in November. In case you don't know this is when they set their advertising prices so everybody's trying to get big huge ratings during November. This election has been the best thing that ever happened to any news media outlet and they want to milk every penny out of it, to the very end. If you don't know this by now get this your heads everything is about money...... even you.
22 | Liz Homer | 1 | 1339569309472651_902338029900049 | I saw some of the interviews and reporting on this. It was disgusting, especially before we knew anything. No wonder the media is held in such low esteem.  In the meantime lots of people don't know the truth about Trump.
23 | Neale Woodbury | 1 | 1339569309472651_902444649889387 | Says the liberal news media proven to be in bed with this disgusting female. Not just MSNBC but it's parent company, also in bed with this wench, can piss off. Your channels will never appear on my TV again and I don't care what shows you have. I'll watch them on Netflix.
24 | Zaferia Cambra | 5 | 1339569309472651_902407846559734 | I can't wait for this to be over. The witch hunt has gone on too long. To endure years of accusations, that woman is made of steel (US steel!) if trump wins we will have pence, (trump will have too many law suits against him) who is far scarier than trump!
25 | Terier Wright | 6 | 1339569309472651_902385349895317 | A Trump presidency is laughable at best. How in the world does his supporters come up with this positive spin on such a negative man. "Make America Great Again".......yeah right. Good one folks, but I'm not fooled by the Trumpacrit. #Hillaryalltheway

--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Pablo Gastelum Montoya | 86 | 1141709569246810_1141825262568574 | Donald Trump will not become president of the United States, because Americans understand that togetherness trumps divisiveness, and that love trumps hatred.
2 | Keith Christenbury | 46 | 1141709569246810_1141851615899272 | Everyone is now reporting that Hillary leads by 8 in early FL voting and that 28% of early Republican voters voted for Hillary. Trump cant win without FL. He has absolutely no path without FL.
3 | Cathy Good Welker | 35 | 1141709569246810_1141824952568605 | Just a thought...Why is no one talking about Huma Abedin's family? You know her mother who is a strong supporter of Sharia Law and her father who represents the Muslim Brotherhood. And why Hillary has accepted 25 million in donations from Saudia Arabia?  Huma as you know is Hillarys personal assistant and her blood runs deep in Saudia Arabia with her father even supporting Al Queda. And btw, where is Huma after the FBI announced their decision to do further investigations? Why hide if there's nothing to hide?? She is a Muslim married to a Jew which would have been forbidden in the Muslim faith unless it was for a greater cause..Spy? One of the releases by the FBI stated that Huma has been on the 'espionage watch' since April.
4 | Pamelia Sullins | 20 | 1141709569246810_1141854495898984 | Don't believe what the media tells you. They are bought and owned by democrats. Of course this is the narrative they want you to believe. Brainwashing at its nastiest!
5 | John Phelan | 8 | 1141709569246810_1141889062562194 | Have any of you people who are so offended by all of Hillary's "crimes" every heard of Scooter Libbey or Dick Cheney? To refresh your memories, they're the guys who deliberately compromised a United States covert operative because they were mad at her husband, who wouldn't play ball with them as they fabricated evidence to provoke a ruinous war. They weren't merely careless with security, they deliberately compromised it with the explicit goal of endangering specific American lives. The only reason they aren't in prison is because we decided long ago that one of the pillars of American exceptionalism is that we don't have new rulers sweeping into power and immediately jailing their political opponents like some banana republic dictator. Save the phony outrage and "lock her up chants." You just sound like idiots whose grasp of history doesn't go back even 10 years, or hypocrites who don't care.
6 | Steve Williamson | 17 | 1141709569246810_1141855592565541 | Hillary's voters have lost their enthusiasm and msnbc is trying to bring it back up because her numbers are dropping a point every 2 days so liberals enjoy the fake good news while you can
7 | Fontaine Moore | 6 | 1141709569246810_1141880909229676 | Throughout this election Chris Matthews has been about as insightful as a bad London fog. Not to mention his annoying tendency to talk over and interrupt his guests. Very disappointing. I used to enjoy his show but not anymore.
8 | Tia Bevis Bastian | 4 | 1141709569246810_1141889219228845 | You can down play the emails ...however it's the "content" of the emails that's the issue. Besides taking insider questions BEFORE the Sanders debate, which is deplorable! These emails expose many things about the Clintons, including, Bill pardoning 170 people in the last few days of his presidency, including Mark Rich in the last minutes of his presidency, that everyone knows we're payoffs...more scandals and investigations, along with the $20 million in Haiti donations that didn't go to Haiti but went to her Brother to buy him a mine! Further the emails talk about her $30 million donation to her foundation from Morocco in 2 installments, (18 mil & 12mil) to close a phosphate factor in Colorado so Morocco can be the largest in the world releasing 5,000 American workers, for her personal financial gain! St Jude charity raised $23 million in donations last year and hers raised $299 million! Does something seem wrong here? Good god, open your eyes, it's endless and certainly not just about her disposing of some harmless emails after being subpoenaed, which is a FELONY! I won't mention the $20 she took for the uranium to Iran! God help us while we wait for you all to catch up...lets pray her "pay to play" days, (that gives this monster her power), are over!
9 | Elizabeth Darmstatter | 0 | 1141709569246810_1142381335846300 | I have always adored Chris Matthews...however I am losing a lot of respect during this election. I cannot tolerate the media going along with the Trump candidacy...and acting like a rapist is equal to someone who used the wrong type of email. Not equal...not OK...and could really hurt this country.
10 | Carol Rinker Petersen | 2 | 1141709569246810_1141895982561502 | Matt Walsh : "We know about Trump. Many conservatives have been on Trump’s case from Day One, as you’re well aware. But has anyone on the Left been on Hillary’s case (or cases)? For God’s sake, you fools nominated Al Capone in a pantsuit. Gal Capone, I might start calling her. The level of criminality is almost farcical at this point... I think it’s possible that you ended up with the most corrupt presidential candidate in American history because you fundamentally reject the very concept of morality. Liberalism is an ideology of relativism. On the left, everything is relative, from human life to marriage to gender to morality. There are consequences to this philosophy. When you don’t have any set moral standard, when you don’t hold yourself and your leaders to an objective ethical code, it’s inevitable that eventually you’ll end up nominating an actual mafia boss."  http://www.theblaze.com/contributions/commentary-liberals-you-cant-lecture-about-trump-when-you-helped-nominate-a-depraved-crook/

12 | Fred Fieldstone | 1 | 1141709569246810_1141934402557660 | Apparently, the more Republicans turn out at the polls, the better it is for Hillary. Looks like the sane Republicans won't be duped by the alt-right. Alright. Hooray for America the already great.
13 | Deborah Brien | 0 | 1141709569246810_1142149185869515 | If Trump wins, America will never be the same again - and it won't be in a good way. I hope people get out to vote and even if Hillary isn't your "ideal" candidate, vote for her anyway. Voting for the insane option only telegraphs to the world, "American voters have lost their collective mind."
14 | Marie Clark | 1 | 1141709569246810_1142244282526672 | America deserves better than no jobs, corruption in washington, A large percentage of people on food stamps, an influx of illegals ( tax payers must support)  Obama care premiums sky rocketing.  I must vote for change.
15 | Ginger Spelts | 4 | 1141709569246810_1141852362565864 | I believe Hillary maybe throwing Huma Abedin under the bus. She has always said that Huma was like a daughter to her and her closest adviser. But I heard Hillary say this at a rally today-- “Now they apparently want to look at emails of one of my staffers – and by all means they should look at them,” Clinton said, ------- I believe rotten Hillary is going to throw poor Huma Abedin under the bus.

What is incredible is that THEY ARE THE SAME FACTS. That is, there is conclusive evidence of: sale of government influence of personal profit while Secretary of State, including approving sale of weapons to ISIS supporting countries in exchange for millionaire donations to her foundation; that Huma Abedin declared that Hillary did not want her Clinton Foundation dealings to be seen by the State Department officials (since they were intertwined), so she set up a private unencrypted, unsecured server through which she channeled ALL her official emails, which included those entailing her Pay-to-Play schemes; that such information was accesible to foreign nations and insurgency groups which used it against the US, including the Benghazi attack; that the day after she was subpoenaed by the Benghazi Committee to turn over her emails, she ordered them permanently wiped out; 33,000 were never recovered; that she lied to Congress under oath about all this fiasco (like Bill did years before). Hey, I'm a democrat who can no longer turn a blind eye to her incredible corruption. I'm no friend of Trump.
18 | Cynthia D Melrose | 3 | 1141709569246810_1141856842565416 | Hey Msnbc how about you report that the FBI has cleared Trump, his backers and his campaign, also wikileaks from having ties to Russia. Scumbags pushing a lie for Hillary.
19 | Dawn Soules Williams | 3 | 1141709569246810_1141866699231097 | Does anyone know how much the Clinton foundation gave Haiti? I Google it, it said, she collected hundreds of thousands of dollars and gave Haiti nothing!
20 | Jen Spry | 0 | 1141709569246810_1142463049171462 | You realize Hillary is under FBI investigation. Also several people in her core group are under FBI investigations for different crimes.Now Weiner's computer shows that Bill Clinton went to the human trafficking island/mansion on a monthly basis. Oh and her money-laundering foundation is under FBI investigation too.  Come on People- this isn't because of Trump....This is because of crime!!!!
21 | Mary McCarson | 0 | 1141709569246810_1142109162540184 | The Hildabeast is so Desperate, she's back to her angry screeching tantrums about Donald's taxes! So pathetic when she's so corrupt and under FBI investigation for the 2nd time. Her emails were clearly intent as Now wiki leaks proves that Podesta told Mook to dump the emails after they were subpoenaed to keep them. Now a new email is set to be released of a 6 million dollar foreign donation to the CF. The email shows Bill Clinton lined up 6 mil from Ethiopian Sheik Mo - The Foreign policy director of the Clinton foundation said it would be crazy to go unless Sheik Mo sent us a 6 mil check.  What money power hungry people - They don't care about anyone but themselves - Wake the hell up Americans!! So very sad that people want to vote for corruption instead of someone who wants to try to change the power hungry government.

The problem for Donald J. Trump is that he can't just hold the line of how the GOP did in the last election, because that was a losing campaign. In Nevada, for example, he's doing as well as Mitt Romney did at this stage of the election, but that's actually bad news for Trump.

The country seems determined to turn itself to the dark side now.  I don't think we're going to be able to stop it.  Too many gullible fools will vote third party or just stay home.

16 | John Phelan | 0 | 10154052444519067_10154052563284067 | Hey folks. All of the news organizations decided years ago not to reveal election-day exit poll numbers that allowed them to call states for a candidate before the polls closed in that state. I just saw Brian Williams quote a survey of people who have voted early, and used it to imply that the Presidential race is "over" in Florida. How is this "survey" different from an exit poll, and how is using it this way different from the thing you all promised not to do years ago? Is your position that it's ok to call a race a week in advance, just not a few hours in advance on election day? Believe me, I'm thrilled if your conclusion is correct. I just don't think you should be discussing surveys of people who have already voted now.

So pathetic when she's so corrupt and under FBI investigation for the 2nd time. Her emails were clearly intent as Now wiki leaks proves that Podesta told Mook to dump the emails after they were subpoenaed to keep them. Now a new email is set to be released of a 6 million dollar foreign donation to the CF. The email shows Bill Clinton lined up 6 mil from Ethiopian Sheik Mo - The Foreign policy director of the Clinton foundation said it would be crazy to go unless Sheik Mo sent us a 6 mil check.  What money power hungry people - They don't care about anyone but themselves - Wake the hell up Americans!! So very sad that people want to vote for corruption instead of someone who wants to try to change the power hungry government.

I think that both Mr. Comey and Mrs. Lynch are people of character who were put into (black mailed by Bill/Hillary - remember Bill coincidentally running into Lynch on her plane right before invest started?) a no win situation.      I think they felt forced to "accommodate" the facts to avert whatever Clintons threatened and now that facts will be coming out, they're scrambling to get ahead of things and "spin" things.

The "nasty women" need to come together, so our voice is heard; all others who are with Hillary Clinton and her train-of-thought, of course.He is just afraid, about people seeing that, the "nasty woman", Hillary Clinton, can do the job, and do it better.   I see him, I hear him, and my blood boils. We cannot let him be the face and voice of our country.

13 | Jill Holton | 84 | 1554306471256044_1554327827920575 | To the people of North Carolina. If you go to the polls and are told you are not on the list to vote. WAIT!! IF YOU have your card showing you are a registered voter there is paperwork for you to fill out and they will give you a ballot after you fill out the paperwork with the Judge of Elections.  Insist on it.
14 | Peggy Hardt | 76 | 1554306471256044_1554329391253752 | What a moron!  He doesn't even understand how the voting process works.  He told another bunch of sheep that, if they voted with a mail in ballot, it won't get counted.  He told them to leave the rally and go vote AGAIN, it would 'cancel out' their other vote!  He's an idiot!

What words???...I have the best words... I get my information from watching TV... I consult with myself because I have a great brain... A great brain???...the best brain...Trump will also build a big wall to keep Mexicans out and he will make Mexico pay for it!...How....??? its all part of the great plan!...ISIS will be gone very, very quickly...How???... I won't tell you.. It's a secret !!!... (This guy is a “one-man circle jerk” and he is only about entertaining the uneducated who love him and his great plan. He's all air - no substance. And he is their “Champion”.)#ImWithHerPlease feel free to paste and copy!

21 | Wayne Thomas Riegle | 42 | 1554306471256044_1554328477920510 | Ok so you went out of your way to vote early, making a decision before the deadline (election day) and he thinks you'll want to go back on your vote just because there are emails on Sec Clinton's top aide's computer that came from the Secretary? I'm sorry, you lost me.
22 | Will Tooles | 38 | 1554306471256044_1824631334448981 | Delusional... the FBI Director said they've uncovered some e-mails not sent by HRC, not authored by HRC, that may have some impact on his previous investigation. Director Comey can you be more vague?  But according to Mr. Trump things have changed.... some things have come out... yes, but not those tax returns... those under audit or those previously audited. Not a single one. Hmmmm... i'd write in that Wisconsin flag rather than vote for this empty suit.
23 | Diane Stewart Strodel | 45 | 1554306471256044_1554335464586478 | Never in a million years...you must be kidding. You are a reality TV character--not anyone fit for the Presidency of the United States.

Trump is corrupt , ignorant, mentally deranged and a child rapist who if elected will be indicted and Pence will take control. Pence is an extremist who could never get elected. But to the uneducated a VP choice isn't important.

1 | Chiffon Lott | 68 | 1339233209506261_1339241022838813 | Don't let the Russians influence our election, if we let them get away with it this time they will forever meddle in our affairs. Vote & send a message to Putin that he is not running things over here.
2 | Robert Rich | 44 | 1339233209506261_1339234109506171 | So, if Hillary is going to HATE MONGER and pivot off the issues to avoid her criminal investigation, what can we expect from a Hillary Administration?
3 | Jolie Broadstone | 15 | 1339233209506261_1339263232836592 | Hillary's corruption is CORROSIVE to our great nation. How can any American with an ounce of common sense think that this lying politician deserves the presidency? Instead, she deserves a prison cell and James Comey knows this down deep in his gut.
4 | Belinda Sullivan | 8 | 1339233209506261_1339248969504685 | Don't let the media make you emotional. Use your brains. Study the platforms, find out as much as you can about the Presidential AND VP(they are a heartbeat away from being president) candidates and vote the direction you would like to see America go.
5 | Deirdre Coulter | 14 | 1339233209506261_1339243179505264 | There are too many polls..it's not like it used to be....we get bombarded every second with more bs and people react to it...Stop! It's like taking a pregnancy test every day or checking your kids temperature every 5 minutes...it's obsession mixed with overload. Give us a break for God's sakes.
6 | Deb Templeton | 4 | 1339233209506261_1339286796167569 | Why is mainstream media ignoring this?http://us.blastingnews.com/news/2016/10/mainstream-media-remains-silent-on-donald-trump-rape-lawsuit-of-13-year-old-girl-details-001223271.html
7 | Will McGinnis | 5 | 1339233209506261_1339603266135922 | All you folks who are bashing Clinton... need to honestly look at Trump as well... neither candidate is what we might call 'morally superior'... Trump is a mess as well.. that said... it comes down to policy... Frankly, Clinton has policies that will do more for the middle class than any other candidate... so if you can put aside all the business of sending one or the other to hell... take an honest look at their policies & vote your conscience
8 | Gail Joy Abbott | 3 | 1339233209506261_1339392462823669 | Looks like MSNBC a bit one sided for the old hag. Hopefully her followers are as lazy about voting as they are showing up to her rally's. BTW MSNBC as far as Trump's private servers, emails etc he's not holding sensitive, government classified info. What he does with his personal business has nothing to do with this countries national security and he isn't risking all of our lives.
9 | Benita Collier Evans | 5 | 1339233209506261_1339263879503194 | Man, I am so sick n tired of hearing the word "TIGHTENING"...Good Grief!!!! The National polls means NOTHING, State by State is what counts
10 | George Marshall | 1 | 1339233209506261_1339317526164496 | The enemy of my enemies is my friend. F the Republican pary. F the Democratic Party, F the Washington elites, F the media for spinning and trying to control this election and manipulate us. If the Washington elite and corrupt people in power want him to lose its because he is a threat to their power. He has my vote.
11 | Kevin Doyle | 5 | 1339233209506261_1339390056157243 | It's not about polls, it's about the electoral college. How hard is that to understand?!?I remember Romney thought he'd win because a lot of polls said he would. And he lost in a landslide.
12 | Billy Sawyer | 1 | 1339233209506261_1339404169489165 | Time to get rid of Electoral College and just do 1 person 1 vote like it should be. Everyone's vote should count no matter where you live in the USA. A system setup before mass communication, internet, phones, etc is no longer needed.
13 | April Mitchell | 9 | 1339233209506261_1339233892839526 | A former senior intelligence officer for a Western country who specialized in Russian counterintelligence provided the FBI with information he says shows the Russian government has spent years trying to influence Donald Trump. In June, the officer, who now works for a U.S. firm gathering information on Russia for corporate clients, was told to research the Republican presidential nominee's dealings in Russia, Mother Jones reported Monday night."It started off as a fairly general inquiry," the ex-spy said.As he searched, he says he found “an established exchange of information between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin of mutual benefit."Citing it as an “extraordinary situation,” the ex-intelligence officer sent a copy of his report to the FBI. In it, he charged that Russian intelligence had "compromised" Trump and could "blackmail him” and that it had a file on Hillary Clinton compiled from "bugged conversations she had on various visits to Russia and intercepted phone calls."He said FBI officials greeted his July memo with “shock and horror” but did not request additional information.The FBI then asked him for more memos in August, he added, prompting him to submit dossiers on members of Trump’s inner circle with ties to Russia.“It’s quite clear there was or is a pretty substantial inquiry going on,” he said of the FBI’s examination of Trump’s links to Moscow.“This is something of huge significance, way above party politics,” the former spy added. “I think [Trump’s] own party should be aware of this stuff as well.”Mother Jones said the ex-spy spent almost two decades on Russian intelligence matters and now works with a U.S. firm that gathers information on Russia for corporate clients.The former intelligence official began researching Trump earlier this year, it said, as part of an opposition research project funded by a Republican client critical of the billionaire.Mother Jones added that the project’s funding switched to Democratic supporters before the anonymous source discovered troubling connections between Russia and Trump.“There was an established exchange of information between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin of mutual benefit,” he said, according to Russian sources he contacted while researching Trump.Trump has repeatedly weathered criticism from Democrats and other Republicans over his sometimes warm tone toward Russian President Vladimir Putin.Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) alleged over that the FBI has “explosive information” about ties between Trump and the Russian government.Reid declined to divulge additional details about the information or to clarify how federal officials discovered it during his Oct. 30 letter to FBI Director James Comey.
14 | Wisdom Ibeagi | 0 | 1339233209506261_1339385236157725 | She belongs in Federal Prison!! Only the ignorant can support this profoundly corrupt woman! She Belongs in Federal Prison already!! The 25 things that are truly important about Hillary instead of this left wing fluff: 1. When did she know her husband was a serial abuser, and does she feel guilty for destroying his accusers? 2. Explain precisely the trades made in the Cattle Futures scandal where $1,000 was turned into $99,000 in a matter of weeks? 3. Why didn't she do anything to protect the Americans in Benghazi? 4. Who is Saul Alinsky and why was he her mentor? 5. When she was working on Watergate, why did her boss Zeifman, a lifelong Democrat, call Hillary a “liar” and “an unethical, dishonest lawyer” and have her fired? 6. What really happened with Travelgate? 7. What really happened with the Rose Law Firm? 8. What really happened with WhiteWater? 9. What gave Hillary the right to see private FBI files of her political enemies in FileGate? 10. Why won't she turn over her illegal server with state department e-mails to congress? 11. Why does your foundation accept money from avowed terror states? 12. What is her take on the Vince Foster "Suicide"? 13. Why did she think she was entitled to steal the White House furniture when she left? 14. Why do you lie even about things that mean nothing: lying about being under sniper fire in Bosnia, lying about being named after Sir Edmund Hillary, or lying that your grandparents were immigrants. 15. Should America be concerned that in ChinaGate, the 22 people that were convicted of fraud or for funneling Asian funds into the DNC were associates of Bill Clinton? 16. Did selling stays at the Lincoln Bedroom to political donors make you feel like a wh)o(re? 17. Does Hillary think Juanita Broadrick lied when she said on national news that Bill Clinton raped her? 18. Is she still okay that Bill goes to pedophile island with Jeff Epstein? 19. Why are there so many murdered and suicided people in the Clinton's immediate circle? 20. Doesn't the fact that the Clinton Foundation has to amend 5 years of its tax returns for improper reporting imply that you were involved in an illegal RICO enterprise? 21. Doesn't approving the Russian-owned Uranium One deal as secretary of state--because of illegal contributions to your foundation--in fact make you a traitor to this country? 22. Was it wise to have at least four Clinton Foundation board of directors that have either been convicted or charged of the financial crimes of bribery and fraud? 23. Why, Hillary, did you pay your female senate staffers 72% of what you paid your male staffers? 24. When you represented an accused pedophile rapist, why did you laugh when you got him off even though you believed him to be guilty? 25. She said she had one e-mail address, it came out that she had two; She said she had one device, it came out that she had two: She said none of her e-mails on her private server was classified, but when the State Dept handed over 300 e-mails the FBI redacted large sections of one, proving again she was wrong. Thus, Ms. Clinton, are you incompetent or just a congenital liar? Everyone should go on you tube and watch The Clinton Chronicles -- it will amaze you what a couple of psychopaths the Clintons really are!
15 | Luke French | 0 | 1339233209506261_1339383872824528 | Claiming that Trump is a fascist, while proposing fascist subjugation of people with dissenting opinions😂Could you be any more hypocritical and ignorant?!? Haha

17 | Rhonda Sheptock | 10 | 1339233209506261_1339241689505413 | Meanwhile Trump is actually going to court for Child Rape and his Fraudulent University that stole millions from hard working Americans, shipping his work off the other countries while touting he wants to make America great, sexually assaulting women for decades, building his businesses with a Chinese steel, hiring US Contractors to architect and build his hotels and then not paying them, bankrupting his businesses and putting people out of work and not providing healthcare benefits for the ones he does have working. And this is all on top of him being a racist, misogynist, hate breeding, war monger who disrespects our veterans and war heroes and makes fun of disabled people! And we can also add that he not only lost 500million on a single year beating the great business man that he is, but found a loophole to then not pay any personal federal income tax for the last 20 years. So he isn't contributing to our schools, fire/police departments, servicemen, veterans, or any other departments that he states he cares so much about!
18 | Karen Mcclure | 3 | 1339233209506261_1339241296172119 | Hillary wont even speak to the press that is on her plane, she is hiding in the back. She knows they know how corrupt she is, how she cheated Bernie out of the nomination, how she sold out this country. Even Jill Stein prefers Trump over Hillary.
19 | Marie Callahan | 1 | 1339233209506261_1339430792819836 | Sick of hearing about Clinton's emails after Trump, Bush, Rice, and Powell got a pass. Fed up with nasty man Donald Trump. Considering Comey sending his confusing letter of innuendo to Congress, perhaps Trump is right about the election being rigged--in favor of Trump, of course.
20 | Nina Rene Starrin | 0 | 1339233209506261_1339637996132449 | Is this also showing the massive voter fraud in favor of democrats ?? There's so much voter fraud in nearly every state. Shows the demoralizing state we've become . Cheating Lowlifes !

23 | Barry Lanehart | 1 | 1339233209506261_1339237226172526 | Found this on Facebook, not my words but like thousands of Members we all agree 100% - America doesn't need Hillary...Seriously she will violate our Constitutional Rights. GOA & NRA both said that Hillary said she wants to take all guns away. Fact link below proves it. America doesn't need a Progressive Socialist dictator violating our Constitutional Rights. She can shove Gun Control up her.....☆ It's a Constitutional Right that every honest American Citizen has to defend themselves against all enemies domestic or foreign. ☆ Also the US Supreme Court already ruled that no one no lower governing authorities can deny ownership!!!Welcome to the new Democratic Republic of Progressive Socialist...☆ She just wants to violate more Constitutional Laws & Rights. There is already enough of Unconstitutional Executive Orders, we don't need anymore...Beside all throughout history there's been many Dictators/Tyrants who took their Peoples g.u.n.s away just before they did horrific acts to their people. http://worldofguns.info/2016/10/26/u-n-says-they-will-soon-occupy-america-under-hillary-going-door-to-door-taking-guns/
24 | Jen Spry | 0 | 1339233209506261_1339706096125639 | You realize Hillary is under FBI investigation. Also several people in her core group are under FBI investigations for different crimes.Now Weiner's computer shows that Bill Clinton went to the human trafficking island/mansion on a monthly basis. Oh and her money-laundering foundation is under FBI investigation too.  Come on People- this isn't because of Trump....This is because of crime!!!!
25 | Belinda Tanner | 4 | 1339233209506261_1339246839504898 | A gentleman named Bill Howell eloquently wrote the below letter.Dear Mr. Trump,It’s taken me a while to realize this and to admit it, but I’m grateful to you.For the past few months I’ve spent a good deal of time lamenting your campaign and the poison it has so effortlessly generated. I’ve watched our country imploding, our public discourse become polluted, our political climate grows ever more corrosive, and wrongly assumed you were to blame.It’s only lately I’ve come to understand that you haven’t manufactured our current national ugliness—you’ve simply revealed it.By saying the irresponsible, mean-spirited, ignorant things you say so freely and so frequently, you’ve given other like-minded people license to do the same. You’ve opened up the floodgates for our corporate sewage to flow fully. People no longer conceal their vile mess, they now revel in it, they broadcast it and retweet it.You’ve made bigotry and racism socially acceptable again and that has been a kind of twisted gift because it’s allowed me to really see people; not as they pretend to be on the surface—but in the very depths of their wounded, weaponized hearts.Over and over as your campaign has persisted, your supporters would tell me that they like you because you “speak your mind”. It wasn’t until recently that I’ve realized that you speak their minds. You’ve given credence to their prejudices and made those prejudices go mainstream.Thanks to the terrible ground you’ve broken, politicians, pastors, friends, and strangers, both in person and on social media now regularly out themselves as hateful, intolerant, and malicious—and they remind me just how close they are to me, just how deep the sickness in us runs, and just how far we have to go together.You’ve emboldened people to be open about things they used to conceal for the sake of decorum, and though it turns my stomach, I know that this is the only way we can move forward; to have that cancerous stuff exposed fully so that it can be dealt with. Our progress as a nation is predicated on authentic dialogue, no matter how brutal and disheartening that dialogue is.In other words, you’ve let us know what we’re really dealing with here and while it’s been rightly disturbing, it’s also been revelatory. That’s the thing about that kind of harsh light: you’re forced to see everything. Beauty and monstrosity equally illuminated.Now don’t get me wrong, I think you’re the least qualified, least knowledgeable Presidential candidate we may ever have had participate this far into the process, and if you somehow were elected I’d fear gravely for the world my children would inherit—should it survive your Presidency at all. I believe you’re reckless, bitter, and completely reprehensible; the very worst kind of bully.But whether you win or lose, you’ve already allowed me the blessing of Truth; about me, about you, about other candidates, about our nation.And in the process you’ve also shown me that I am not alone in resisting you and this ugly thing you’ve revealed about us.You’ve generated an equally loud, equally passionate response to it and this is where I find my hope these days.I find it in those for whom equality isn’t just a cheap buzzword, it’s the most precious of hills to die on.I find it in those people who refuse to be silent in the face of our impending shared regression.I find it in those willing to be bolder in defending the inherent value of all people.I find it in the growing army of those who will not tolerate hatred as a core American value.I find it in those who reject violence as our default response to dissension.I find it in the ever rising voice of people who will not let malice and bitterness represent them in the world.Today I find my hope in those who, like me, will not be complicit in allowing bigotry and intolerance to become a source of national pride, because we’ve seen where that leads.Yes, Mr Trump, you’ve unearthed our hidden sickness and you’ve allowed it to go viral.You brought every awful thing about us out into the open.You will NEVER Get My Vote!#VoteBlue #NeverTrump

1 | Eric Crum | 101 | 10154760765033689_10154760825128689 | I don't see Trump winning. There is no evidence Wisconsin or North Carolina will even tip towards Trump. That's all she has to win in this case. Florida is close, but it always is, but so is Georgia, which is not good for Trump.The only way Florida will tip towards Trump is if there is cheating involved. There would have to be voter suppression efforts in place for Trump to win Florida (which there partially is). Floridians do not like their governor, who is a huge supporter of Trump. He's the most unpopular governor in the nation also.The math is just easier for Clinton.
2 | Pollie Thomas | 85 | 10154760765033689_10154760822288689 | He is not going to win ,we haven't came out yet,and coming out in million we just been quite watch nov8, she going to win , watching Trump supporter make fools of themselves
3 | John Burlingame | 28 | 10154760765033689_10154760816278689 | Rosie O'Donnell needs to do an opening on one of Hillary Clinton's talks. That will open up Trump for sure and get things moving back in the right direction.
4 | Cheryl Hall | 59 | 10154760765033689_10154760810073689 | She and minions think they are above the law. The public is just sick of the lies, tricks, cheating, self enriching, power abusing, Hillary Clinton. ENOUGH!!!
5 | Dan Thompson | 28 | 10154760765033689_10154760887008689 | Remember Trump voters don't fall for that left-wing conspiracy of the media telling you the election is next Tuesday. Remember Donald Trump told you and it is true that it is November 28. Don't be fooled vote November 28 if you're voting for Trump.
6 | Warren Murray | 24 | 10154760765033689_10154760815473689 | While there has been some life changing emails revealed in these illegally hacked private email accounts, it is evident that someone is only interested in revealing one side of a two sided political parties conversations. Any wise and just person knows that there are at least two sides to every story, so until I see what both sides are saying, these emails mean nothing to me. None of the emails show any intent of Hillary trying to illegally harm our country or any person, but we don't know what the gop and trump is saying or doing. Lets see both sides so we can make equal and fair decisions on who we want to vote for. You can only fool a fool, more than once and I'm nobody's fool. Whose fool are you ?
7 | Skep Masalela | 30 | 10154760765033689_10154760808498689 | Trump is going to win by a landslide, whether you want to admit it or not.
8 | Connie Greene | 2 | 10154760765033689_10154761482458689 | Just stay plugged in to MSNBC because there was two polls on Lawrence O'Donnell's show that crashed this opinion. An economics poll that does not follow electoral votes and a Florida poll that measures daily votes that revealed 28% of Republicans that voted already crossed over to Hillary Clinton and voted Republican down ballot.
9 | John Steinbach | 11 | 10154760765033689_10154760887133689 | I don't buy his analysis that it's hurting Hillary, she will still win by a landslide!  #BlueWave2016 will be arriving soon!!!
10 | Je Deg | 3 | 10154760765033689_10154761692253689 | The GOP is DEAD ! After this election when Hillary wins ! The deplorables have nowhere else to go ! I mean seriously nowhere !
11 | Timothy Reents | 3 | 10154760765033689_10154760901313689 | The bar is so low for the cry baby loser trump who chases story's of weiners, not winners.Untrustworthy Trump. Using fake polls, fake newspapers, fake news stories, trolls from all over the world to sell your propaganda... all the while Putin is building a new, much larger, KGB force....  Well seems really really UNTRUSTWORTHY TRUMP!The number of trump campaign staff that have active criminal investigations is growing fast! Thank you trump for being the law and order guy making it so easy to bring these "fringe individuals and groups" , both foreign and domestic,  out of the darkness and into the light of law enforcement.  I however would not support an amnesty deal for you in the process.
12 | Steven D. Weber | 4 | 10154760765033689_10154760869463689 | That moment when your Hillary supporter friend, finally realizes EVERYTHING!  The emails, the WikiLeaks, Huma's gone, the Weiner's been exposed, Donna Brazile ousted, EVERYTHING is true!  & just has to give up,... they go and take a shower for 3 days. But never admit that they figured it out, they don't know how to tell you.
13 | Jim Williams | 12 | 10154760765033689_10154760846898689 | Breaking News!!!: "FBI discovers shocking revelations in Hillary's e-mails. Her e-mails reveal that Clinton cheated on three spouses and pleaded the fifth 97 times to avoid admitting she committed adultery, molested fourteen men, ripped off hundreds of workers and contractors and investors, defrauded hundreds of students, mocked a handicapped reporter, lost a billion on a casino in 1995 when the economy was booming, has actually never released any of her tax returns so we can know who she owes money to, is going to court for fraud and raping a 13 year old boy, and used the money from her foundation to line her own pockets and bribe two attorneys general, and she has a former Putin assistant as co-chair of her campaign, is receiving millions of dark money from Russian oligarchs, Russians hacking into RNC and Trump campaign e-mails," I'm sticking with Hillary.
14 | Jackson DeStefano | 1 | 10154760765033689_10154761482968689 | You're simply wrong about what states are tossups. Right now, it's Nevada, Arizona, Iowa, Ohio, Florida, and North Carolina, but even without those states, Clinton is already over 270 thanks to her firm holds on Pennsylvania and Michigan. She may be the first president since Kennedy to lose Ohio but still win the Presidency. But, there's little use in speculating. It's best just to see what happens on election day.
15 | Nipun Kalra | 0 | 10154760765033689_10154761420208689 | Someone on twitter has cleverly created the  handle "cucktodd". ever since I saw that whenever I see Chuck Todd, I immediately think of "Cuck" Todd.... LOL!!!
16 | John J Fletcher III | 1 | 10154760765033689_10154760860688689 | All hail the supreme leader Queen Hillary!The debt and tax slaves love her, and they are excited to work on the government plantation until the day they die paying half of their money to globalist that live in luxury!
17 | Margie Hammer Harmon | 3 | 10154760765033689_10154760832733689 | A vote for Hillary is a vote for four years of corruption, investigation, and gridlock. It will be impossible for her to achieve anything, should she be elected, with her time and energy focused on legal survival.
18 | Janet D Bryant | 2 | 10154760765033689_10154760917518689 | Polling science is dependent on the sampling. These old models of sampling have not been adjusted to reflect the changing demographics. Hispanics are an increasing percentage of the electorate; each cycle their numbers increase. Asians are also an increasing demographic that is TOTALLY overlooked. Even we African Americans have increased. Until the models for polling are adjusted to reflect the much more diverse electorate, these polls are not really reliable.Think about it this way: in 2012, the polls had President Obama up by .06%. Yet, he won going away by 4%, a blowout.
19 | Olayinka Adedapo | 1 | 10154760765033689_10154760891718689 | If emails that was found on someone else's server can change the outcome of Americans election, I am going to take my ex back for cheating on me.
20 | Rhonda Sheptock | 7 | 10154760765033689_10154760868678689 | Meanwhile Trump is actually going to court for Child Rape and his Fraudulent University that stole millions from hard working Americans, shipping his work off the other countries while touting he wants to make America great, sexually assaulting women for decades, building his businesses with a Chinese steel, hiring US Contractors to architect and build his hotels and then not paying them, bankrupting his businesses and putting people out of work and not providing healthcare benefits for the ones he does have working. And this is all on top of him being a racist, misogynist, hate breeding, war monger who disrespects our veterans and war heroes and makes fun of disabled people! And we can also add that he not only lost 500million on a single year beating the great business man that he is, but found a loophole to then not pay any personal federal income tax for the last 20 years. So he isn't contributing to our schools, fire/police departments, servicemen, veterans, or any other departments that he states he cares so much about! Oh and now the icing on the cake ... he won't even pay his own Pollster company the 500k bill he owes them 😖
21 | Jn Searle | 2 | 10154760765033689_10154760918243689 | I asked a young Lady at a game, how she could vote for Trump, a “misogynist, a racist and a bigot”.Here is her answer:Because I use my head to research and find out what candidates really are, not what the media wants me to think. Because Donald Trump has more women in executive and managerial positions than any comparable company, which tells me he is not a misogynist. Because he pays these women the same or more than their male counterparts, which tells me looks for capacity and skills in people, not color, gender or race. Because he fought the West Palm Beach City Council to be able to open his newly purchased club, so he could include blacks and Jews as members, who had been banned until then. This tells me he is not a racist. Because he has raised wonderful children who have turned out to be outstanding, hard-working and compassionate adults. He must be doing something right. Because his economic plans makes sense, are conservative in nature, and I vote based of what is best for my family, my friends and my country. Because everybody, the left and the right are afraid of him, the media is trying to destroy his image, and even foreign governments are voicing their opinions, so he must be doing something right. Clean house maybe? Because I want a Supreme Court that will uphold the Constitution, not behave as minions of the administration. I have had enough with judges who are more like political activists than law enforcers. Because I fear for my family’s safety if the current trend of not confronting blatant terrorism continues – which is a threat to our way of life. Because I am fed up with the rampant corruption of this administration. Accountability in government is paramount, and as this administration has demonstrated, it is a foreign concept to them. Because I am fed up with the political correctness gone wild, and because Trump is not afraid to say what everybody thinks but does not dare to say. A thug is a thug, regardless of color, and that's it. Because it is about time someone puts America's interests ahead of other countries. Because I know he recognizes and embraces America's exceptionalism, and will not tour the World apologizing for who we are. That tells me he is a patriot. Because, unlike HRC, he has actually held a job, worked hard and achieved success. And last, but not least, because I am more offended by what Hillary does than by what Trump says.
22 | Jeannieand Ken | 3 | 10154760765033689_10154760824103689 | Obamacare will cost Americans more $$ with their employer health insurance in 2018!!You will be taxed!!Self-only coverageA $12,000 individual plan would pay an excise tax of $720 per covered employee:$12,000 - $10,200 = $1,800 above the $10,200 threshold$1,800 x 40% = $720Family coverageA $32,000 family plan would pay an excise tax of $1,800 per covered employee:$32,000 - $27,500 = $4,500 above the $27,500 threshold$4,500 x 40% = $1,800
23 | Tammy Shelton Eskola | 0 | 10154760765033689_10154760886973689 | People voting for Hillary need to consider that since she was doing government business as Secretary of State on her unsecure server that China and Russia and anyone else who probabky broke into it, WILL blackmail her if she becomes President. She chose to handle "we the people's" emails in this way...which makes her incompetent to be President. Being Secretary of State is a big deal for national security and she put people at risk. I don't care how much "free stuff" she promises me...I care more about this great country and it's future.
24 | Ebrima Azeena Ceesay | 1 | 10154760765033689_10154761067963689 | Clinton is expected to get 332 electoral votes, while Trump is predicted to get just 206, according to the Moody's Analytics model, which is based on three economic and three political factors.

There is a clear path of the Democratic Party to take the presidency, the house and the senate...

2 | Tucheh Stone | 307 | 1339161862846729_1339162382846677 | Comey is a Republican after all. Now his bias is showing and it'll only be a matter of time before he's removed from office because of his violation of the Hatch Act.

4 | Rasha Kashat Kesto | 77 | 1339161862846729_1339188472844068 | The FBI has already made a statement that they have found no ties between Russia and Trump, however Hillary is now under question about if she was part of the Russian uranium deal.Nice try.
5 | Chrystal Patton | 50 | 1339161862846729_1339168829512699 | Trumps possible ties to Russia far outweigh known millions in donations from Saudi Arabia to the Clinton foundation and Killarys known ties with Russia.. good try swaying us. 😒

You are all over Hillary's emails. The deposition is online. Read it and report. It's only fair. If this were Bill, it would be all you guys would talk about.
7 | Maria Elena Munoz | 25 | 1339161862846729_1339186182844297 | Go Hillary 🇺🇸🎋if nothing can touch Trump the system is not rigged is corrupted,Trump is supporting Dakota oil corporation and Native Americans should sue Trump for destroying sacred lands and future water contamination,that is going to affected all us.🐢
8 | Jennifer Kettleson | 18 | 1339161862846729_1339172222845693 | can we just have the truth please? I think we need to make stricter laws on who can and can't be in government. some of these people records you wouldn't be able to get a normal job with.
9 | John McCarthy | 28 | 1339161862846729_1339162172846698 | IT’S OVER: NYPD Just Raided Hillary’s Property! What They Found Will RUIN HER LIFEELECTION USA NEWS - November 1, 20160 Share Tweet Share ShareYou’ve probably heard by now that NYPD obtained Anthony Weiner and Huma Abedin’s home devices as part of an investigation into Weiner’s alleged “sexting” with underage girls… But the cops didn’t stop with them!To their complete shock, the NYPD ended up finding and raiding HILLARY’S property on those devices in the form of 650k emails connected to her personal email server…Now her private property is in the hands of the NYPD and FBI!An NYPD source just claimed that within the emails on that device, Hillary and Bill are directly implicated ins a MASSIVE child sex/trafficking ring along with their friend, and convicted pedophile, Jeffrey Epstein. (See Below)According to the source,“…It’s much more vile and serious than classified material on Weiner’s device. The emails DETAIL the trips made by Weiner, Bill and Hillary on their pedophile billionaire friend’s plane, the Lolita Express.”“We’re talking an international child enslavement and sex ring“These claims were backed up by other NYPD sources as well:
10 | Earl Franklin Clemons Jr | 9 | 1339161862846729_1339165886179660 | The 1980s are again calling to ask for their foreign policy back. But this time the roles are reversed. We're now the guys with the closed, secretive, paranoid elite desperate to prevent the truth getting out to the wider world. In the Soviet Union, the apparatchiks of the one-party state warned you not to listen to the BBC on short-wave under the bed covers at night. In America, CNN's Chris Cuomo warns you that it's "illegal" for you to read those Wikileaks emails. So just leave it to credentialed media wallahs like him to let you know if there's anything in them of any interest. Which, judging from the networks' coverage, there isn't.So, as Chris Cuomo sees it, the same FBI whose officials were leaned on not to investigate Hillary for illegally keeping classified emails on a server housed in some guy's toilet in Colorado should instead investigate you for reading emails about her illegal emails. This is what a supposedly free press has been reduced to in order to drag Hillary across the finish line.
11 | Chris Collins | 4 | 1339161862846729_1339210086175240 | EXCEPT lol... The FBI could find no links whatsoever between trump and Russia. U guys are getting desperate 👀. Clinton now put out a phony story about trump having a secret server to communicate with Russian bank Alfa. lmao at the irony
12 | Shawn Walker | 7 | 1339161862846729_1339172652845650 | The FBI has clearly chosen a side in the presidential race, and they are using their power and influence to tip the scale!, You see they're not releasing anything about Donald Trump, and this is right after President Obama said James Cromey is not leaning one way or the other!, That's what I've been saying about Obama, he sees something right in front of him and too weak to point it out !!.. Welcome to being targeted by the law Hillary Clinton says all minorities in the US
13 | Earl Franklin Clemons Jr | 6 | 1339161862846729_1339166149512967 | It is still somewhat jaw-dropping (and not in the Monica sense) that the campaign to return the Clintons to the White House is now running on how terribly the other guy treats women. Introducing Hillary in New Hampshire today, Michelle Obama gave a speech on Trump as a sexual predator and then hailed Hillary as someone who's had "more exposure to the presidency" than any other candidate. Be that as it may, she had rather less exposure from the President than innumerable other women during the Clinton years. Paula Jones got considerably more, and without asking for it. But Mrs Clinton stands there and demands "dignity for women" - and nobody laughs.
14 | Serrell Law | 5 | 1339161862846729_1339187339510848 | Already knew this. It's not rocket science. Plus, nobody is talking about Trumps child rape case that's going to court December 16, 2016 and his other cases that are going forward after the election.
15 | Matt Justt | 5 | 1339161862846729_1339245732838342 | Double standard??!! She LIED!!BLATANTLY LIED to the FBI and ALL OF AMERICA!! Yet STILL got her above the law standard, and got off Scott free AGAIN!! MSNBC = crooked and corrupt as the Clintons!!!
16 | Kenneth Corbett | 0 | 1339161862846729_1360735510606172 | the massive corruption of clinton doesn't bother you? wow. partisan politics are destroying this nation from the inside out because people will follow a candidate off the cliff. FBI director does his job in july he is a hero, does it in october he is the devil.
17 | Dennis Sioleski | 5 | 1339161862846729_1339170342845881 | The FBI has said nothing about Trump.. The FBI investigation is centered on #CrookedClinton and the NY Times just reported Trump has NO ties to Putin or Russia.. Let me repeat NO ties to Putin or Russia! This is just another way for the media to try and pull the spotlight off of #CriminalClinton.#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #VoteTrumpPence2016
18 | Olayinka Adedapo | 2 | 1339161862846729_1339188602844055 | I don't think Obama should have allowed somebody from a party that has done nothing than to obstruct everything he has been doing for eight years to be in that office. He made a mistake trying to see everyone having the same heart like him.
19 | Sunnie Marquez | 5 | 1339161862846729_1339198002843115 | Comey was definitely bought by Trump, NRA, or House Republicans!! Come on people really?? Comey a registered republican didn't reopen the email issue on purpose to help Trump's campaign?? We know better and we won't allow this disgusting predator to become our next President!! Trump is what he says and voting for him says who you are!
20 | Jaison Tyler | 3 | 1339161862846729_1339187119510870 | No what it is Obama and Hilary are balmming Russia because people inside the NSA and FBI are leaking stuff to expose her Wikileaks is not Russian !!!! They are a independent publishing website all they do is spred emails he's Swedish hiding out in London not Russian . You watch 7 days left more bombshells on her next one will end her campaign.
21 | Kenneth Brown | 1 | 1339161862846729_1571584566192468 | Republican nominee and lawsuit magnet Donald Trump has found himself the target of yet another accusation of fraud and financial misconduct – this time in another country. A Mexican official has filed a criminal tax complaint against Trump in Tijuana, Mexico, over yet another failed business venture – the Trump Ocean Resort, which collapsed before it even began construction.But before the housing market and the rest of the global economy collapsed with the onset of the Bush Recession, Trump and his partners sold $32.5 million in future properties to unwitting customers since 2006 and leaving their investors in the lurch.In addition, Donald Trump is accused of dodging an additional $32.5 million in taxes – surprise! – but has countered that he wasn’t actually involved, but that he was just “leasing” his name on the project. The investors, however, counter that Trump’s face was on the brochure and quoted him as saying it would be “the most spectacular place in all of Mexico.”Though Trump worked out the deal with Los Angeles-based developer Irongate Wilshire and Mexican company P.B. Impulsores, the lawsuit singles out Trump by name, calling him out “against the Mexican state because beyond defrauding investors he also committed fraud by not paying taxes in Mexico for the mercantile operations he took part in.”It should come as no surprise, since Donald Trump has dodged paying American income taxes for decades and defrauded his investors his entire life. Far from being a “successful” businessman, Trump has proven time and time again he is incapable of following through with the most basic of financial transactions – the exchange of money for rendered goods and services.

Hillary on the other hand has lied about everything.  With the new emails, all the Dems will be in line with the fbi trying to make deals turning her in.
23 | Janice Navarijo | 1 | 1339161862846729_1339264832836432 | Why don't you investigate how much was paid by Trump and his people to get the FBI Director to go after the Clinton e-mails again?  Or maybe there were threats of some kind.  The whole action needs to be investigated.

MSNBC won't report the truth...Wikileaks has a 10 year and 100% track record on their leaks being accurate and TRUE, and  the other thing is there hasn't been a Russian near this election other than  to watch in amusement as  the Left self destructs trying to shield probably one of the largest Crime organizations since the Gambino's that's if the Gambino's could've started a Nuclear war to hise their criminality......Either MSNBC starts giving the wikileaks emails the time and consideration they deserve or they will be joining Donna Brazile in the recently unemployed line......ASK CNN if they believe the wikileaks were accurate...they havent refuted any of them and they Fired Donna because of it....NUFF SAID.

6 | Fontaine Moore | 4 | 1339132196183029_1339233629506219 | It is amazing how thoroughly dishonest Republicans and conservative can be, while accusing Democrats of the very thing they they, themselves, are guilty of. For example, most "voter fraud," including attempts to repress the vote, are almost always the handiwork of Republicans. And yet they invariably blame it on Democrats and use that as an excuse to pass more voter repression legislation!

The people need intellectual honest reporting instead of a partisan agenda shoved in their face. The poisonous perspective propagated on this channel, tragically, creates a false view of the world and culture that stokes division and anger. Sure racism exists. However everything is not racism. The lengths these host will go to in order to create that perception is ridiculous. Here's a never mentioned election story they keep forgetting to report on. http://www.wnd.com/2010/06/173117/

17 | Earl Franklin Clemons Jr | 2 | 1339132196183029_1339154606180788 | The 1980s are again calling to ask for their foreign policy back. But this time the roles are reversed. We're now the guys with the closed, secretive, paranoid elite desperate to prevent the truth getting out to the wider world. In the Soviet Union, the apparatchiks of the one-party state warned you not to listen to the BBC on short-wave under the bed covers at night. In America, CNN's Chris Cuomo warns you that it's "illegal" for you to read those Wikileaks emails. So just leave it to credentialed media wallahs like him to let you know if there's anything in them of any interest. Which, judging from the networks' coverage, there isn't.So, as Chris Cuomo sees it, the same FBI whose officials were leaned on not to investigate Hillary for illegally keeping classified emails on a server housed in some guy's toilet in Colorado should instead investigate you for reading emails about her illegal emails. This is what a supposedly free press has been reduced to in order to drag Hillary across the finish line.
18 | Stephen Lewis | 1 | 1339132196183029_1339157166180532 | Anon News ,reported an FBI source has confirmed that evidence has emerged from the Clinton email investigation that a massive child trafficking and pedophile sex ring operates in Washington.

21 | Gerald Ott | 4 | 1339132196183029_1339136882849227 | THE NATION: Perhaps one reason Trump has been able to get away with being so absurdly vague, vulgar, and uninformed is that he has positioned himself squarely as a culture warrior, not as a politician. The culture wars aren’t about the specifics of foreign policy or climate change or budget concerns. They are waged as performative skirmishes—symbolic, visual, and visceral. In one corner are the send-ups of campus eggheads supposedly surrendering Western civilization to the people who “don’t belong”: bleeding women with “fat faces,” unruly affirmative-action minorities, LGBTQ victimologists, job-stealing Asians, and a mushily defined remainder of soft equivocators and kale-eating “liberals.” In the other corner are the tough guys, the red-meat-eaters, real men who live in a “real world” of no rules but ruthlessness: plain-speaking, strong-jawed, put-up-or-shut-up cowboy entrepreneurs, unafraid to get their hands a little dirty in the service of building beautiful walls around the beautiful empire, the beautiful castle, and their bevy of beautiful ladies in skintight dresses. https://www.thenation.com/article/trump-doesnt-want-to-lead-the-country-he-wants-to-lead-a-culture-war/

Makes thousands of emails disappear overnight - is always leading in the polls by double digits with only 50 people at her rally (most of whom were paid to be there and bussed in). From a mere investment of $5000 made $250,000 in beef futures - Hillary is actually a magician

There is so much hatred (even though these are supposed to be Christians who are forgiving) that they can not see what he will do to our country. He has already increased hatred and racism among people.

This cost-benefit analysis primarily focuses on the idea that we all have the choice to proceed with our actions.

15 | Margaret Steinhoff | 0 | 1339047216191527_1339817139447868 | This is also how I feel. It's almost over for me.  Dear Mr. Trump, It’s taken me a while to realize this and to admit it, but I’m grateful to you. For the past few months I’ve spent a good deal of time lamenting your campaign and the poison it has so effortlessly generated. I’ve watched our country imploding, our public discourse become polluted, our political climate grows ever more corrosive, and wrongly assumed you were to blame. It’s only lately I’ve come to understand that you haven’t manufactured our current national ugliness—you’ve simply revealed it. By saying the irresponsible, mean-spirited, ignorant things you say so freely and so frequently, you’ve given other like-minded people license to do the same. You’ve opened up the floodgates for our corporate sewage to flow fully. People no longer conceal their vile mess, they now revel in it, they broadcast it and retweet it. You’ve made bigotry and racism socially acceptable again and that has been a kind of twisted gift because it’s allowed me to really see people; not as they pretend to be on the surface—but in the very depths of their wounded, weaponized hearts. Over and over as your campaign has persisted, your supporters would tell me that they like you because you “speak your mind”. It wasn’t until recently that I’ve realized that you speak their minds. You’ve given credence to their prejudices and made those prejudices go mainstream. Thanks to the terrible ground you’ve broken, politicians, pastors, friends, and strangers, both in person and on social media now regularly out themselves as hateful, intolerant, and malicious—and they remind me just how close they are to me, just how deep the sickness in us runs, and just how far we have to go together. You’ve emboldened people to be open about things they used to conceal for the sake of decorum, and though it turns my stomach, I know that this is the only way we can move forward; to have that cancerous stuff exposed fully so that it can be dealt with. Our progress as a nation is predicated on authentic dialogue, no matter how brutal and disheartening that dialogue is. In other words, you’ve let us know what we’re really dealing with here and while it’s been rightly disturbing, it’s also been revelatory. That’s the thing about that kind of harsh light: you’re forced to see everything. Beauty and monstrosity equally illuminated. Now don’t get me wrong, I think you’re the least qualified, least knowledgeable Presidential candidate we may ever have had participate this far into the process, and if you somehow were elected I’d fear gravely for the world my children would inherit—should it survive your Presidency at all. I believe you’re reckless, bitter, and completely reprehensible; the very worst kind of bully. But whether you win or lose, you’ve already allowed me the blessing of Truth; about me, about you, about other candidates, about our nation. And in the process you’ve also shown me that I am not alone in resisting you and this ugly thing you’ve revealed about us. You’ve generated an equally loud, equally passionate response to it and this is where I find my hope these days. I find it in those for whom equality isn’t just a cheap buzzword, it’s the most precious of hills to die on. I find it in those people who refuse to be silent in the face of our impending shared regression. I find it in those willing to be bolder in defending the inherent value of all people. I find it in the growing army of those who will not tolerate hatred as a core American value. I find it in those who reject violence as our default response to dissension. I find it in the ever rising voice of people who will not let malice and bitterness represent them in the world. Today I find my hope in those who, like me, will not be complicit in allowing bigotry and intolerance to become a source of national pride, because we’ve seen where that leads. Yes, Mr Trump, you’ve unearthed our hidden sickness and you’ve allowed it to go viral. You brought every awful thing about us out into the open. You will NEVER Get My Vote!
16 | Jude Birch | 0 | 1339047216191527_1339084332854482 | Chuck Todd suggests we may face hopeless gridlock if Hillary wins and the senate stays the same. I wish he would focus on first winning the senate with Hillary's Presidency and then REMEMBER Mitch McConnell declared the obstinate obstructionist view following Obama's win. He literally gave us Trump, so we should demand that obstruction be acknowledged and then shoved aside after Tuesday, never forgetting where it began. It wasn't just this election cycle, nor it's ugly path. McConnell was a very bad loser, yet remains squarely in his red state seat in Kentucky.

Also Clinton's emails could only come that far because nobody picks one of the hundreds lies and law violations and drags it on for months! Why are emails worse than insulting, sexually harassing women, than tax fraud, than giving a crap about poor people, than encouraging racism in a country almost entirely build by immigrants. This presidential candidacy shows a clear lack of the education system in the states and the abuse of power by media.

19 | Jn Searle | 1 | 1339047216191527_1339237306172518 | I asked a young Lady at a game, how she could vote for Trump, a “misogynist, a racist and a bigot”.Here is her answer:Because I use my head to research and find out what candidates really are, not what the media wants me to think. Because Donald Trump has more women in executive and managerial positions than any comparable company, which tells me he is not a misogynist. Because he pays these women the same or more than their male counterparts, which tells me looks for capacity and skills in people, not color, gender or race. Because he fought the West Palm Beach City Council to be able to open his newly purchased club, so he could include blacks and Jews as members, who had been banned until then. This tells me he is not a racist. Because he has raised wonderful children who have turned out to be outstanding, hard-working and compassionate adults. He must be doing something right. Because his economic plans makes sense, are conservative in nature, and I vote based of what is best for my family, my friends and my country. Because everybody, the left and the right are afraid of him, the media is trying to destroy his image, and even foreign governments are voicing their opinions, so he must be doing something right. Clean house maybe? Because I want a Supreme Court that will uphold the Constitution, not behave as minions of the administration. I have had enough with judges who are more like political activists than law enforcers. Because I fear for my family’s safety if the current trend of not confronting blatant terrorism continues – which is a threat to our way of life. Because I am fed up with the rampant corruption of this administration. Accountability in government is paramount, and as this administration has demonstrated, it is a foreign concept to them. Because I am fed up with the political correctness gone wild, and because Trump is not afraid to say what everybody thinks but does not dare to say. A thug is a thug, regardless of color, and that's it. Because it is about time someone puts America's interests ahead of other countries. Because I know he recognizes and embraces America's exceptionalism, and will not tour the World apologizing for who we are. That tells me he is a patriot. Because, unlike HRC, he has actually held a job, worked hard and achieved success. And last, but not least, because I am more offended by what Hillary does than by what Trump says.

21 | Linda Smith | 2 | 1339047216191527_1339131706183078 | In today’s New York Times, former Central Intelligence Agency director Mike Morell initiated a firestorm by strongly endorsing Hillary Clinton for president. His memorable op-ed didn’t simply back the Democrat, her own grave security lapses notwithstanding. Morell went further, tearing down her Republican opponent as “not only unqualified for the job, but he may well pose a threat to our national security… he would be a poor, even dangerous, commander in chief.”Normally that would be sufficiently lethal coming from a former CIA director, but Morell kept going, castigating Donald Trump as a pawn of the Kremlin possessing overtly pro-Russian views. He minced no words: “In the intelligence business, we would say that Putin had recruited Trump as an unwitting agent of the Russian Federation.”http://observer.com/2016/08/yes-american-spies-really-think-trump-is-putins-guy/

Section 2071.For those of us who do not have United States Code committed to memory, here's what it says:“(a) Whoever willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys, or attempts to do so, or, with intent to do so takes and carries away any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both. (b) Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States. As used in this subsection, the term “office” does not include the office held by any person as a retired officer of the Armed Forces of the United States.”Yes, it explicitly states "shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States.Shouldn't voters know that? The media won't tell them. So it's up to us.    Fact check that!!!!!

They promoted Trump by giving him FREE media coverage in the Primary and that is why he beat out the other 16 candidates ... And ALL they can talk about is "emails" ... never about Trump scandals of FRAUD and RAPE ... saying that Hillary Clinton's supporters are not enthused ..and calling her dishonest and not trustworthy ...

The point that the Clinton's CIA has fabricated a complete and total lie of sexual predator on the other candidate should be most telling???

1 | Mike Franklin | 56 | 1338986936197555_1339001026196146 | It blows my mind the media such as CNN and MSNBC are still trying to actively elect someone under criminal FBI investigation as well as the Clinton foundation under massive criminal FBI investigation, it's almost un-American, but as they say only in America, maybe they feel ratings will be better under a Clinton term when the FBI is handing out criminal referrals like candy, not to mental perjury charges for lying to congress..

5 | Michael Angelo de Castro | 18 | 1338986936197555_1338991826197066 | Hillary is such a champion for women's rights and protecting children that she has chosen to attack the FBI investigation of a pedophile she is associated with, without a single word about his multiple underage female victims.

16 | Daniel R Guzman | 1 | 1338986936197555_1339051309524451 | The survey, conducted by Morning Consult for Politico, found Clinton leading Donald Trump by 42%-39%, with Libertarian Gary Johnson at 7% and Green Party nominee Jill Stein at 5%. The Green Party needs 5% of the vote in order to get federal funding, and automatic access to many ballots. We can do this. Here is some history of third parties: In 1854, a few thousand people gathered in Jackson, Michigan to launch an independent challenge to a national political system dominated by two parties. "Of strange, discordant, and even hostile elements," a party leader later recalled, "we gathered from the four winds…[with] every external circumstance against us." This challenge was fueled by the radical abolitionist movement that united white workers and formerly enslaved Africans against the criminal institution of slavery, as a response to the political crisis caused by the Kansas-Nebraska Act.In just two years, this insurgent third party — created by movement activists — had gained ground across the Northern states, challenging the Whig Party. In short order this insurgent "third party" had become a major opposition party. By 1858 they had won an influential foothold in Congress, and by 1860, that party leader — Abraham Lincoln — was elected President of the United States.#Jill2016

It is my personal Vietnam. I feel like a great and very brave solider.”More than 58,000 Americans died in the actual Vietnam War, including nearly 18,000 who were drafted into service.

Does Donald J. Trump have his own email troubles?
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Jillian Baber | 318 | 1338957129533869_1338960376200211 | If this were the case why haven't the Democrats used this the entire election?  With her emails being such a major issue for her, you would think this would have been a point made months ago.  Another BS distraction tactic.
2 | Clifford Phillips Jr | 160 | 1338957129533869_1338965689533013 | It amazes me that people who support Donald J. Trump actually care about the law when it comes to what Hillary Clinton may or may not have done. Its just inconceivable that these people actually say they care about law and order like their searching their memories for their favorite episode of the tv show Law & Order:  Special Victims Unit. But here's my questions to you. Where was your concern about "Law and Order" when Tamir Rice was murdered by a police officer in 2 seconds? Where was your concern about "Law and Order" when Walter Scott was shot through the back by a lying police officer that claimed that Scott was assaulting him? Where was your concern about "Law and Order" when the man who killed Trayvon Martin continues to break the law and escape punishment? Where was your concern about "Law and Order" when Geroge W Bush started a war against the wrong country resulting in the deaths of over 4500 of our  troops and nearly 300,000 innocent civilians in the Middle East which was the real cause of the building of Isis? And speaking of emails, Where was your concern about "Law and Order" when the Bush administration deleted 22 million emails that confirmed the suspicions of the false claims of going to war in Iraq? Where was your concern about "Law and Order" when Bush let the man responsible for 9/11 get away for 10 years?Where was your concern about "Law and Order" when not one person in the Bush administration, not Bush, not Chaney, not Rumsfeld, not Rice, not Powell was called to congress for a hearing or any of the supporters or even detractors calling for them to be in prison? Where was your concern about "Law and Order" when the FBI was investigating Trump for having a email server connected to a Russian Bank or lack there of? I could go on. But the fact is you honestly don't care about law and order when it puts people you care about or support are put in the light of law. And even break their backs defending them and blame the other guy. And worse, hold others to a much higher standard then themselves or those they support. So do Trump supporters care about Law and Order? No they really don't. Because if they did, Donald Trump wouldn't be only a near week away from being the president.
3 | Dan Darnell | 153 | 1338957129533869_1338963042866611 | Trump was probably not Secretary of State..selling his office for profit to foreign governments wanting weapon systems or wanting to be removed from Terrorist State listing. If he did anything wrong he would have been charged. So now back to the real news...Oh it's not available on MSNBC.

6 | Jack Morris | 30 | 1338957129533869_1338975776198671 | Lmao!!! -HilLIARY uses an unsecured private server as Secretary of State. Her response," secretary Powell did too, in fact he told me to do it!" - HilLIARY deletes 33,000 government related emails. Her response," trump has a private server. He deleted emails too!Umm I think you see where this is going. First off trump owns a private company, of course he has a server, just as GE, Boeing and ford have private servers. If he decides to delete them he can. That's the difference between public and private sectors. Public officials emails are not their private emails. They are owned by the us tax payers. I meAn 30 years in DC and she still doesn't know the difference between public and private...  Totally fit for the whitehouse!!
7 | Marion Rohling | 18 | 1338957129533869_1338962996199949 | You DON'T say....lol Of course he's got his own dirt, they ALL do. Question is, how us the information obtained. Republicans only wanna hear from wikileaks, it suits their needs, even though NOTHING was in there to indict the only qualified candidate.
8 | Michael Pannucci | 19 | 1338957129533869_1338970442865871 | Sounds bogus, especially coming out right after killary is indicted and called a pedifiler ... this bias media network is the only one who still has her ahead in polls
9 | Joseph James Mohn | 25 | 1338957129533869_1338962069533375 | Msnbc playing the "I know you are but what am I" card. The Clinton Campaign is in serious trouble. Wikileaks has exposed the lies. And there's more and bigger one's to come.

11 | Thomas Paine | 7 | 1338957129533869_1338964302866485 | An NYPD source just claimed that within the emails on that device, Hillary and Bill are directly implicated ins a MASSIVE child sex/trafficking ring along with their friend, and convicted pedophile, Jeffrey Epstein.
12 | Eric Hazlett | 3 | 1338957129533869_1586105891696565 | It's funny reading all the comments from Democrats in here who have already decided Trump is guilty of this. While at the same time defending Hillary to the death...The double standard is powerful with the left...
13 | Avis Watts | 2 | 1338957129533869_1338969469532635 | Dan Carrow I hope you won't be disappointed when he does not live up to his promises if he gets elected. He will set the country back to the 1950 when women and minorities won't have a say. I hope people will not let him do anything he wants if get elected. I feel more people will be dying because they can't get health insurance under Trump.
14 | Bobbie Hutton Griffith | 4 | 1338957129533869_1338989139530668 | Wow...what a shocker.  But wait....there is a double standard and you do realize that it applies don't you?

FYI: The only nasty, offensive commercials that I've seen on tv have been sponsored by Hillary Clinton. She's used our children to slam Donald Trump. It's a real shame that we have to screen our children from seeing these poorly chosen ads. It's disgusting.
16 | Louise Jones | 3 | 1338957129533869_1339003312862584 | They are all pathetic sinners Mr O, as I've said b4, and they'll go to hell together, howerer, Murder of the unborn child is my argument, not emails, not nothing of the all her avalanch of corrution can even come close to Murder. We all know Killary is the Queen of corruption and murder is where I draw the line. I will expose her 4 the Killer of unborn babys that she is. Trump is against abortion and so am I. 😘.

20 | Diane Juliano | 0 | 1338957129533869_1272973482747682 | Of course, none of the media brings up any of the fraud, rape, and many other charges against him! No one counters Trump's surrogates when they are harping about Hillary. Major double standard. Media has done a lousy job since day one!!!

She's in this mess because of what she did. She is in this mess because of who she and her husband are.I'm now voting TRUMP 2016

The Ku Klux Klan gave their blessing, officially endorsing Donald Trump on the front page of their latest newspaper edition. You must be so proud, Republicans. Just today, Congressman Paul Ryan admitted he already voted for Donald Trump in his home state of Wisconsin. That’s a racist, misogynistic stink that won’t wear off in 2020, Congressman. Even if you can’t bear to say his name out loud.

10 | David David | 0 | 1338932326203016_1339073509522231 | Can't believe I just saw "A Presidential Candidate" use a Columbia woman who is married to a murderous drug cartel member and was on trial herself for murder (until they threatened to kill the prosecutor and judge?) as a character witness to prove a point? The point that the Clinton's CIA has fabricated a complete and total lie of sexual predator on the other candidate should be most telling???  The guy was on tv every week (I didn't watch, wasn't a fan), that no one EVER made, came forward about? His family speaks VOLUMES about who he is personally! Just baffled at how people buy into it?
11 | TracyJonathan Harness | 1 | 1338932326203016_1338941036202145 | Bill Clinton is going to court on January 7th for raping a 9 year old in Rogersville, Arkansas. Guess that's not news in your world. Do we want Bill and his wife raping girls in the White House? Also, Chelsea is being investigated by DCS for molesting her children as well. There is clearly something wrong with the Clintons.
12 | Lara Ann Notes | 5 | 1338932326203016_1338938662869049 | I voted Trump/Pence and you should too. It's the lesser of two evils vote. Clinton is crashing and burning. Even if she is elected, she will be such damaged goods not even Amazon would accept her return. Instead of calling her Madame President,  nearly half of America will call her Madame Criminal and have no respect for her at all. We will be so caught up in the typical Clinton drama we will get nothing done. It's how the Clinton's  operate and they aren't going to change their behavior if they return to the WH - they proved that the last time. No, we will have to suffer with her repeat of Obama'a failed policies, or worse until we can vote her out and put someone else in. History isn't go look favorably on Obama, but not even he is the colossal failure Clinton is and will be. At least Obama put his ideas to the test, as bad as they are. Clinton just rides the coattails of others - just like she brags about her husbands policies during  the debates. She has no original thought because she hasn't done anything meaningful for our country in her life. At least Obama was a community organizer and activist. Not much of a resume for President, but what did Clinton ever organize - the Glee Club?  She has only one thing going for her. She's a woman, and even that is questionable.

14 | Steve Bayt | 0 | 1338932326203016_1338956632867252 | Epilogue: I am taking a break promoting my TV show about saving cats to save people and save the world in Parma, Ohio that the nation can read about on my Parma’s Resurrection page which will hopefully get CVS to incarnate social cause TV, to make sure Donald Trump is our next president. Any media outlet may publish this article without payment, but with a byline.*********************************************************************************So, Hilary wants to welcome millions of Muslims who practice Sharia Law that calls for raping, torturing and killing of women who will eventually vote and be appointed to be judges and officials who have let off thousands of   Muslim rapists and pedophiles which is also mandated by Sharia Law under all that religious tolerance Michelle Obama bs’s about.Millions of women in Islamic States have their genitals mutilated, raped, tortured and killed and that will happen here (and to a small part is happening here to be a warning) if Hilary is elected. What Hillary  will create a supply and demand for is a million times worse than what soon President Trump’s locker room talked about 11 years ago, to a talk show host and a soap star as part of an entertainment show.This is not hate talk. It’s world events of atrocities committed against women on a massive epic scale that has made its way to America and Clinton will make part of American life. An American lifestyle where women won’t even be allowed to have a gun to protect themselves. Hillary Clinton supports Muslims because her husband can by all rights be called a rapist having forced himself on so many interns, George Bush had to take out all the carpets and furniture out of the White House because it smelled of sperm. If preventing legalized rape isn’t enough, there is Whitewater, Benghazi, Emails, communistic economic philosophies etc. Who knows how many rapes, the then First Lady walked in on and just let it keep on happening as long as she stayed in the white house. Yet, she calls Trump supporters deplorable.  Then there is all the other stuff Trump is talking about. Donald Trump might talk about doing bad stuff to women. Hillary is both married to someone who does the acts and wants to make a world where what he talks about is legal and mandated.Trump supporters aren’t deplorable. The deplorable ones are the media, in particular the attractive women who don’t warn their viewers about Sharia Law. For they themselves, Megyn Kelly, Kate Snow, Savannah Guthrie, Natalie Morales, Katy Tur, Paula Zahn, Laura Spencer, and those liberals on The View etc.  will themselves be victims someday. Then the media will talk about Sharia Law, not now when Donald Trump can stop it.  They’ll blame the Muslim judge and Muslim rapist. Not themselves. Megyn Kelly thinks Trump is bad. Wait someday when she does a story in Dearborn, Michigan and is raped walking out her hotel room by a Muslim where Sharia Law is legal.  I have yet to hear a single mention other than by Cruz, Rubio, Gingrich, Oriely and of course Trump explaining Sharia Law.When people vote, look at your daughter, niece, sister, mother or aunt and ask. Do you want their world to be safe or to get raped where the Muslim gets off without prosecution? For that is what Hillary will have happen. Vote Trump and America Safe Again. Not Clinton and support legalized rape.
15 | Richard Lamar Gambrell | 1 | 1338932326203016_1339027959526786 | No, I think it is more likely Trump's world is a place full of opportunities to take advantage of others and tactics are just a means to that end. Nothing else matters to him. The fears he feeds are just another tactic to take advantage.
16 | Thomas Entrican | 1 | 1338932326203016_1339028302860085 | Man. Why would we expect anything else from MSNBC. Hillary is the most corrupt, dishonest politician in our lifetime. The media just doesn't get it. Sheep mentality.
17 | Robert Meadows | 2 | 1338932326203016_1338948682868047 | Nothing VENGEFUL, just tired of the corruption in Washington. He didn't have to run.

He thinks George Bush should of been impeached.He gave to Weiner, Chumer, Hillary and Crist over Rubio.He would tell you that he didn't do those things nor did he say these things. Then when you play the audio he spins it like a ball of yarn on crystal meth, totally non coherent.http://therightscoop.com/levin-rips-donald-trump-to-shreds/

25 | John Elroy Christianson | 0 | 1338932326203016_1339102666185982 | I am sick to death of everyone wondering who hacked the e-mails. It doesn't matter. What matters is that Hillary Clinton illegally, knowingly and intentionally used an unsecure server and exposed our national secrets to the world for hacking. When she was caught she also illegally, knowingly and intentionally deleted e-mails, destroyed e-mailing devices, and lied lied lied about having done any of it. Someone please tell me how that is not criminal activity that should be handled with an arrest. And have that be an arrest without bail due to the absolute seriousness of the crimes. And when someone commits a crime the wheels of justice do not come to a stop because that person just happens to be in a race for the presidency. In fact, if they are in a race for the presidency that arrest needs to be made as expeditiously as humanly possible. Whomever the people are in the corrupt circle of people holding off an arrest should be arrested with her!!!

Did they report Hillary having the questions before the debates,NO. How about her earpiece for the debates. NO! How about 'I don't recall' interviews or the destroyed emails. The list goes on and on. They are not news reporters, they are biased and that isn't reporting.
4 | Elva Rosas | 3 | 1338898486206400_1338927226203526 | Lesli Wimes is all over the place explaining her assessment of enthusiasm for Hillary Clinton in Florida and then says Democrats will vote anyway. Asked about the surrogates, she says, "We love Obama " but it doesn't translate to votes. However, Obama is in Florida today and he successfully urges people in all his stumps to vote to preserve his legacy and people listen to him. "Hillary Clinton should've engaged the black community" she says, the African American community is not engaged and at the end she's asked if she voted, " I already voted for Hillary Clinton." Bizarre interview.
5 | Bruce Grenger | 4 | 1338898486206400_1338932099536372 | You can not argue with a liberal Democrat, People in Texas were voting for Trump, & the machines were changing their vote to Hillary. How about the dead people voting Democrat! Do some reading, Not the liberal sh. How about Brazile giving her the questions before the debate!

7 | Dorothy Stopford Barr | 0 | 1338898486206400_1339798339449748 | Rigging the elections is something Republicans are very good at.  Redistricting, reducing voting polls from 16 to 1 in heavily Dem precincts, reducing or eliminating early voting, etc. etc. Now, Trump encourages his supporters to intimidate voters in Dem precincts.  This is deplorable and the U.S. is supposed to be the beacon of democracy.

11 | Mariah Hirzel | 3 | 1338898486206400_1338924829537099 | According to Federal Law 18 U.S. Code § 2071 Hillary Clinton is legally not allowed to be president.And if you take into account all of the criminal acts that were uncovered from the wave of emails, anybody that still supports her doesn't have their eyes or ears open, and are voting for her for the wrong reasons.Her emails uncovered more crimes than just mishandling federal information by using a unsecured server.Hillary Clinton received money from and supported nations that she KNEW funded ISIS and terroristsEmails from her server that prove this:https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3774https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/5469https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/1828Hillary's Chief of Staff admits in the 2nd link that foreign interests sway Hillary to do what they want her to do (money for mandatory appearances). She also admits that the "Friend of Hillary" list is available and rentable to people who want to influence, but that it’s too sensitive to talk in email.This leak shows Hillary knows Saudis and Qatar are funding ISIS, which is an enemy of the state. After knowing this, Hillary accepted tens of millions in donations from these terrorist-funding governments (of course they are getting something back in return). She also supported arms deals to them.2:Bill Clinton receives $1 million "birthday gift" from ISIS-funding Qatar while Hillary was SoS, Qatar receives arms flow increases of 1,482%https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/8396http://www.ibtimes.com/clinton-foundation-donors-got-weapon…3:Hillary took money from foreigners for campaign (illegal)https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/11915https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/27834:Used American lobbyists to money launder foreign donations illegallyhttps://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/11915Very clear intent to break campaign finance laws.

17 | Greg Griffin | 1 | 1338898486206400_1338931006203148 | It has certainly been an eventful past few days for the Clinton Presidential Campaign:1. The FBI reopened the email investigation based upon the discovery of new evidence not previously surrendered by the Clinton team.  Evidence they were legally obligated to provide under subpoena 2. President Obama voicing his support for the integrity of the FBI director in respect to the  reopening of the investigation 3. The head of the DNC, Donna Brazile, being fired from CNN for providing Mrs Clinton with debate questions in advance of the event…not once…but twice4. The Attorney General of the United States of America pleading the 5th during questioning related to the Iran Hostage Payments5. The New York Times completing an exhaustive investigation of any potential ties between Mr Trump and the Russians….that determined none exist6. Devastating email releases by WikiLeaks that included the following revelations:a. The Clinton Global Foundation’s ‘pay for play’ activitiesb. The incredible amounts of cash they received from foreign donors as part of ‘Clinton Inc.’c. Staff members questioning Mrs Clinton’s healthd. Staff members revealing Mrs Clinton’s daytime drinking habitse. More collusion between her campaign and the media7. The Obama administration announcing prohibitive Obamacare monthly premium increases in 2017What’s next?  Who knows?  It sure is going to be interesting watching it all unfold over the next few days, however.  Get your popcorn and beverage of choice ready.  Just relax and watch the show.  It’s show time!

What matters is that Hillary Clinton illegally, knowingly and intentionally used an unsecure server and exposed our national secrets to the world for hacking. When she was caught she also illegally, knowingly and intentionally deleted e-mails, destroyed e-mailing devices, and lied lied lied about having done any of it. Someone please tell me how that is not criminal activity that should be handled with an arrest. And have that be an arrest without bail due to the absolute seriousness of the crimes. And when someone commits a crime the wheels of justice do not come to a stop because that person just happens to be in a race for the presidency. In fact, if they are in a race for the presidency that arrest needs to be made as expeditiously as humanly possible. Whomever the people are in the corrupt circle of people holding off an arrest should be arrested with her!!!

--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Sharon Mullican | 141 | 1338870982875817_1338881359541446 | I know lifelong Republicans who are not voting for Donald Trump. His ignorance and warmongering has absolutely terrified them, his business practices of not paying his contractors turned many off also. Not to mention the child rape and fraud trials coming up for him before the end of the year..these aren't mindless innuendo or half truth--actual criminal trials for fraud and rape.  For all you ranting about not reporting the polls....polls are opinions expressed to some random person who phones you....have you been called? Polls really mean not a lot, like exit polls, people lie, hang up, don't complete them, have leading questions. I've had polls so slanted it was impossible to answer truthfully. My response wasn't even a choice. Polls are nothing and who cares about them. The only one that is important is the one on Nov. 8.
2 | Roxanne Miley | 124 | 1338870982875817_1338875612875354 | Comey is looking into Trump ties with Russia. But for some reason Comey doesn't feel it's necessary to yell it from the rooftops. Makes you wonder what his agenda really is.
3 | Annette Ross | 57 | 1338870982875817_1338880359541546 | Trump is a con-man and a crook! He does care about the country except for the part of the country he owns! Has never paid taxes, takes other people's money and lies! Plus loves Putin who want to destroy us! Vote Blue!
4 | Nancy Cunningham | 48 | 1338870982875817_1338877666208482 | We can only hope! With trump on trial Nov 28 and then on Dec16 he is going to trial for rape of a 13 year old child. Think about that for a minute! Then go vote for Hillary Clinton.
5 | Carrie Davis | 64 | 1338870982875817_1338871859542396 | Anyone who would vote for such a corrupt woman...who will spend her entire presidency being indicted and fighting her court battles rather than American battles...is ignorant!
6 | Daryl Blue | 13 | 1338870982875817_1338963986199850 | Yeah, I want someone who has declared bankruptcy numerous times, who stiffs contractors because he says he pays them enough, who games the system so he doesn't pay taxes and then brags about it. Yeah, that's who I want to fix the economy.
7 | Lisa Blue | 13 | 1338870982875817_1338905056205743 | Anyone who believe Trump is for change is going to get there feelings crush both of them not prefect I guess people dont care about experience. America has to stand for something Congress is Just as bad as them, and no matter who win this election we are going to lose something but I rather lose with hiliary then for Russia to take this country.
8 | Kevin M. Carney | 29 | 1338870982875817_1338879379541644 | A gentleman named Bill Howell eloquently wrote the below letter.Dear Mr. Trump,It’s taken me a while to realize this and to admit it, but I’m grateful to you.For the past few months I’ve spent a good deal of time lamenting your campaign and the poison it has so effortlessly generated. I’ve watched our country imploding, our public discourse become polluted, our political climate grows ever more corrosive, and wrongly assumed you were to blame.It’s only lately I’ve come to understand that you haven’t manufactured our current national ugliness—you’ve simply revealed it.By saying the irresponsible, mean-spirited, ignorant things you say so freely and so frequently, you’ve given other like-minded people license to do the same. You’ve opened up the floodgates for our corporate sewage to flow fully. People no longer conceal their vile mess, they now revel in it, they broadcast it and retweet it.You’ve made bigotry and racism socially acceptable again and that has been a kind of twisted gift because it’s allowed me to really see people; not as they pretend to be on the surface—but in the very depths of their wounded, weaponized hearts.Over and over as your campaign has persisted, your supporters would tell me that they like you because you “speak your mind”. It wasn’t until recently that I’ve realized that you speak their minds. You’ve given credence to their prejudices and made those prejudices go mainstream.Thanks to the terrible ground you’ve broken, politicians, pastors, friends, and strangers, both in person and on social media now regularly out themselves as hateful, intolerant, and malicious—and they remind me just how close they are to me, just how deep the sickness in us runs, and just how far we have to go together.You’ve emboldened people to be open about things they used to conceal for the sake of decorum, and though it turns my stomach, I know that this is the only way we can move forward; to have that cancerous stuff exposed fully so that it can be dealt with. Our progress as a nation is predicated on authentic dialogue, no matter how brutal and disheartening that dialogue is.In other words, you’ve let us know what we’re really dealing with here and while it’s been rightly disturbing, it’s also been revelatory. That’s the thing about that kind of harsh light: you’re forced to see everything. Beauty and monstrosity equally illuminated.Now don’t get me wrong, I think you’re the least qualified, least knowledgeable Presidential candidate we may ever have had participate this far into the process, and if you somehow were elected I’d fear gravely for the world my children would inherit—should it survive your Presidency at all. I believe you’re reckless, bitter, and completely reprehensible; the very worst kind of bully.But whether you win or lose, you’ve already allowed me the blessing of Truth; about me, about you, about other candidates, about our nation.And in the process you’ve also shown me that I am not alone in resisting you and this ugly thing you’ve revealed about us.You’ve generated an equally loud, equally passionate response to it and this is where I find my hope these days.I find it in those for whom equality isn’t just a cheap buzzword, it’s the most precious of hills to die on.I find it in those people who refuse to be silent in the face of our impending shared regression.I find it in those willing to be bolder in defending the inherent value of all people.I find it in the growing army of those who will not tolerate hatred as a core American value.I find it in those who reject violence as our default response to dissension.I find it in the ever rising voice of people who will not let malice and bitterness represent them in the world.Today I find my hope in those who, like me, will not be complicit in allowing bigotry and intolerance to become a source of national pride, because we’ve seen where that leads.Yes, Mr Trump, you’ve unearthed our hidden sickness and you’ve allowed it to go viral.You brought every awful thing about us out into the open.You will NEVER Get My Vote!
9 | Alec Drake | 44 | 1338870982875817_1338871922875723 | The last Democrat who won Arizona was named Clinton. I hope Hillary can pull this off. All my friends in the state have voted for her and they usually vote Republican.
10 | Mark Rush | 7 | 1338870982875817_1338938346202414 | This may all be wishful thinking on The Democrats part, but to even think that we have a chance in a place like Arizona is very good news.

13 | Arturo Perez | 9 | 1338870982875817_1338921179537464 | Donald don't care about the people, the predator don't pay taxes. He confessed in the video to sexually assaulted a married lady.As US soldier I voted for Hillary Clinton.
14 | Kathleen Topf | 11 | 1338870982875817_1338874942875421 | No, Trump is still within the margin of error and you know it. You need to look in Huffington post polls. Some polls nationally show Trump in the lead by one point. But you wont show that. You will show NBC polls taken on October 30. You will show the best polls. In even Real Clear Politics I have seen polls to where Trump is in the margin of error. I want you to show more polls. She has brought this email scandal upon herself. Maybe Donnal Brazile is doing th polls too.
15 | Mark Streand | 16 | 1338870982875817_1338872292875686 | The Clinton campaign cant change the state blue, but Trump being a horrific candidate sure can

17 | Al Gi Carrillo | 0 | 1338870982875817_1338983169531265 | Choice Theory – Choice theory is the belief that individuals choose to commit a crime, looking at the opportunities before them, weighing the benefit versus the punishment, and deciding whether to proceed or not. This cost-benefit analysis primarily focuses on the idea that we all have the choice to proceed with our actions. Because of the punishment involved, we are deterred from committing the crime.

The list can go on but you get the point.Please Arizona, vote blue this time.

20 | Sally Marler | 4 | 1338870982875817_1338897082873207 | Arizona has shot themselves in the foot for so long, not because of the issues but because it's been party first, regardless of the issues.   Arizona take off that ridiculous Trump hat and vote for what is right, and that means NOT right wing broken promises as usual!
21 | Dee Hearth | 3 | 1338870982875817_1791063917825004 | Do it!  Come on latinos! Stand up and be counted. Change the tone on how you will be treated for yourselves and your children.A vote for Trump will allow them to see you as a second class citizen. I am a Latino woman and have already seen a sample of this in my own life. Don't let them treat you this way anymore. Stand up and vote for Hillary.
22 | Mary Larkin Vetter | 0 | 1338870982875817_1783131568614281 | They've gone all in that's for sure and stooped to all time lows! The only nasty, offensive commercials that I've seen on tv have been sponsored by Hillary Clinton. She's used our children to slam Donald Trump. It's a real shame that we have to screen our children from seeing these poorly chosen ads. It's disgusting.
23 | Robert Palastra | 0 | 1338870982875817_1338993792863536 | Maybe you guys should look at my state, Pennsylvania.  The state is solid red except for Philadelphia and Pittsburgh...the number of Democratic votes in Philly usually overwhelms the GOP.  But this year:  the intensity of Trump voters in PA will ensure his voters turn out and in Philly SEPTA has gone on strike...no mass transit in Philadelphia.  Combined that with low voter intensity for Hillary...Trump takes PA.
24 | Djr Dwr | 2 | 1338870982875817_1339005869528995 | I hope so. Trump supporters are screaming lock her up for what. No ones has proven her guilty. Gossip, lies, assumption and deceptions do not count.
25 | Carl Montefusco | 1 | 1338870982875817_1783144991946272 | I think you in the media are going to turn blue ..holding your breath like little children when Trump wins the popular vote...I hope for the country he will and the upset it causes will save it more than the same old same old will only kill it.Report only the facts and stop trying to tilt the election.

1 | Tony Pagano | 15 | 1169554879795873_1169588843125810 | Reasons that Hillary Clinton is disqualified for running for the office of the president of United States. -She destroyed evidence while being investigated by the FBI I under a court ordered subpoena. -The DNC cheated and rigged the election so that Bernie Sanders didn't win, Debbie Wasserman, chairman at the DNC, was fired for rigging the election and then Hillary rehired her to work for Hillary personally. -Bill Clinton got on a private plane with Loretta Lynch, Attorney General of the United States, days before the investigation was over, and had a 39 minute discussion with her while his wife was being investigated by the FBI.-Donna Brazile gave Hillary Clinton the debate questions before the debate with Donald Trump. Therefore they cheated.-Upon multiple occasions the news and media have sent Hillary Clinton articles before they were released to ask her to proof read them and send them back was approved. -The DNC hired people to go to Trumps rallies to cause violence. -Huma Abedin, Hillary's top aide and confidant, has been sharing emails on an unsecured private server with Hillary and Congressman Weiner, the congressman under FBI investigation for Sexting a 15-year-old.
2 | Regina Lynn | 8 | 1169554879795873_1169617873122907 | I would hope Arizona has more since then to vote for Hillary Clinton...Do you people not see or understand just how much trouble Hillary Clinton is in.. Bill & Hillary Clinton have disgraced America and Americans to many times... They need to be in prison for the seriousness of this investigation...

4 | Daniel R Guzman | 0 | 1169554879795873_1169751303109564 | The survey, conducted by Morning Consult for Politico, found Clinton leading Donald Trump by 42%-39%, with Libertarian Gary Johnson at 7% and Green Party nominee Jill Stein at 5%. The Green Party needs 5% of the vote in order to get federal funding, and automatic access to many ballots. We can do this. Here is some history of third parties: In 1854, a few thousand people gathered in Jackson, Michigan to launch an independent challenge to a national political system dominated by two parties. "Of strange, discordant, and even hostile elements," a party leader later recalled, "we gathered from the four winds…[with] every external circumstance against us." This challenge was fueled by the radical abolitionist movement that united white workers and formerly enslaved Africans against the criminal institution of slavery, as a response to the political crisis caused by the Kansas-Nebraska Act.In just two years, this insurgent third party — created by movement activists — had gained ground across the Northern states, challenging the Whig Party. In short order this insurgent "third party" had become a major opposition party. By 1858 they had won an influential foothold in Congress, and by 1860, that party leader — Abraham Lincoln — was elected President of the United States.#Jill2016

6 | Stephen Angelos | 8 | 1169554879795873_1169584929792868 | Hillary is unelectable now. New National ABC/WaPo poll has Trump leading. Erasing a 12 pt lead from Hillary in less than two weeks. She is too corrupt and dishonest, folks.  Her camaign calls Latinos "needy" and mocks Catholics.

"This is the biggest scandal since Watergate," Donald J. Trump said about the Hillary Clinton email bombshell.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Kevin Blount | 407 | 1338819142881001_1338823846213864 | Trump is under multiple investigations. Real investigations and court cases. No witchhunt. He is a billionaire who hasn't paid taxes in over 20 years, but yet have the nerve to complain about the government and being rigged. Never Trump.
2 | Laurie Wordehoff | 349 | 1338819142881001_1338819969547585 | Republican Watergate? Thanks for the reminder Trump. It seems you have been awfully busy shredding and erasing documents related to lawsuits. You seem a lot like good old Nixon.
3 | L Jeannette Colón Hernández | 176 | 1338819142881001_1338823119547270 | MEANWHILE:Donald Trump has a preliminary hearing on 12/16/2016 at 10 am in front of judge Ronnie Abrams at Manhattan federal court house the second time he's been charged with rape this time against a 13year old child. Child Rape...Case 1:16-CV-04642 US District Court Southern District of New York.
4 | Laurel Sheridan | 78 | 1338819142881001_1338822662880649 | The man's memory is totally lacking - there's no comparison, not even close. Yet his minions, being as ignorant as he is, will believe this bunk.
5 | Kyle Monday | 59 | 1338819142881001_1338834546212794 | Trump seems to have forgotten lots of other real scandals since watergate; like Iran contra, like "weapons of mass destruction in Iraq", like the millions of emails that Bush Cheney destroyed.
6 | Marshall J. Pierce | 23 | 1338819142881001_1338842372878678 | Yeah, no. It isn't. Ties to Russia, a rape trial, over a dozen women accusing you of sexual assault, 4 bankruptcies, 2 failed marriages, blatant racism, condoning and encouraging violence against detractors, smearing a gold star mother, a billion dollar tax write off, over 1000 civil lawsuits for not paying bills, 127 charges of tax fraud, and gold plated toilets? That's 100x worse than Watergate, and that's just scratching the surface.
7 | Shannon McCown | 30 | 1338819142881001_1338825292880386 | Former Nixon White House Counsel John Dean, Former Nixon White House Speech Writer David Gergen and former Washington Post writer Carl Bernstein who uncovered the story w/Bob Woodward all disagree strongly with Mr. Trump's assertion and IMO given their connections I think they would know far better than Trump if it is or if it isn't.  Even John Dean said "Mr. Trump’s insistence that “Emailgate” is worse than Watergate serves to divert attention from the fact that, in my opinion, Mr. Trump is remarkably Nixonian, perhaps even more so than Nixon himself."http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/31/opinion/no-emailgate-is-not-worse-than-watergate.html?_r=0
8 | Nemesio Mike Caban | 25 | 1338819142881001_1338826626213586 | ...see, what have I been saying for years.  These folks can never get over Watergate... it drives them nuts, and its led them to nominate this piece of work as their final swan's song...
9 | Jean-Pierre Castillejo | 15 | 1338819142881001_1338828709546711 | Yes! Comey's mishandling of the entire affair is appalling after senior officials at the FBI and DOJ told him not to send the letter. What is amazing how the CHUMP campaign does not realize that Comey has violated the Hatch Act of 1939.
10 | John Potempa | 7 | 1338819142881001_1338843742878541 | Not even close. The FBI closed the original investigation and are opening it again because they're investigating Weiner (and there are other sketchy partisan motives I'm sure). Even the hacked emails have nothing that compares to Watergate, but Trump loves the poorly educated that wouldn't know that
11 | Deana Fulco | 16 | 1338819142881001_1338827856213463 | Bush and Cheney deleted 22 Million emails and they started a war that fifteen years later, our troops are still fighting and being killed in!!! Trump and the RNC never mentions that because they only want to bring Secretary Clinton down!
12 | John Peter King | 7 | 1338819142881001_1854655174754161 | Actually Wiki leaks  is much closer to Watergate! It is the hacking  and theft of one party's information  , released and used to benefit another party and influence an election . It is just a digital version of a break in . That is really the biggest scandal of this election cycle. But the media seems fine with it , as they selectively distribute the selectively released and possibly altered or edited private correspondence.
13 | Rigel Dyess-Hall | 9 | 1338819142881001_1338843359545246 | Tell me, exactly what consequences resulted from Hillary's use of a private email server? Wikileaks wasn't able to hack it, so no state secrets were exposed. What earth shaking news resulted from her emails?
14 | Beatrice Rohde | 14 | 1338819142881001_1338821486214100 | What's really funny is that some of the players who were flirting around during Watergate just happen to be hovering around Tramp. Sounds convenient. They've been using some of the old tactics too.
15 | Mike Ryals | 20 | 1338819142881001_1338819426214306 | Now that the mystery has been unraveled, and the democrats dirty laundry is out, the choice is clear; if you want a government that is just, and works for all the people, then you will pull the lever for Donald J Trump. And the draining of the swamp can begin.
16 | Agnes Coffey | 1 | 1338819142881001_1152245751523863 | Trump is wishful thinking when he claims this latest debacle is bigger than Watergate and he's becoming a laughing stock for saying it. He should have waited till the content of those emails was revealed cause there's nothing there to make such a claim. He just wants headlines to focus on Hillary and not him.
17 | April Ruggles | 1 | 1338819142881001_1854710638081948 | A trial date being set means that there was enough evidence to go to court. I would believe this is a bigger Scandal mr. Trump. And professionals said that what's going on with Clinton is nowhere near what happened with Watergate.https://www.google.com/amp/www.nydailynews.com/amp/news/national/lawsuit-accusing-trump-raping-girl-13-december-hearing-article-1.2828413?client=ms-android-verizon
18 | Marie Martinez | 16 | 1338819142881001_1338825049547077 | MSNBCYES...we know this...you've told us OVER and OVER and OVER...but please keep reminding us....you only have a week to further damage her campaign in favor of your bosses' choice to "rule" us with the iron fist of fascism.  You guys are truly disgusting.  You've moved so far to the right that you have no right criticizing Fox or anyone else.  Since Chuck T*rd took over it's been a downhill slide into personal opinion and right wing ideology.  "might not be good for the country, but it's good for business"...yea, right.  Business.
19 | Kimmeth Powell | 1 | 1338819142881001_1152545591493879 | FB seriously needs a eye roll button. This idiot is as corrupt as they come, under 5 investigations, 57 court cases including child rape and skips out on his bills purely for sport - I couldn't care less about some email spook. It's not a bombshell, but it's nice he has a chew toy to help keep him from going berserk.
20 | Loretta Magallon | 1 | 1338819142881001_1338843779545204 | you keep saying that all were talking about are hillarys email well it's up to you MSNBC to change the narrative and bring it back to donaldson many many many many scandals rape of a 13 year old court date tax write offs with someone else is money. Him purposely d'alene, something 6 months, so he can. Delete all his emails lying to the FBI on and on and on.
21 | Al Gi Carrillo | 0 | 1338819142881001_1152390781509360 | Choice Theory – Choice theory is the belief that individuals choose to commit a crime, looking at the opportunities before them, weighing the benefit versus the punishment, and deciding whether to proceed or not. This cost-benefit analysis primarily focuses on the idea that we all have the choice to proceed with our actions. Because of the punishment involved, we are deterred from committing the crime.Hillary Clinton criminality is unstoppable -is who she is , is what she does !
22 | Karen Ullman Marks | 0 | 1338819142881001_1152264651521973 | No Mr. Trump, it is not the biggest scandal since watergate, at least, not at this point. You know nothing, and are just speculating about what could happen. If this is the way that you would conduct yourself in the WH, then I do not think this job is a good fit for you.
23 | Kerry Stehlik | 0 | 1338819142881001_1338858379543744 | No, this is a conspiracy, let's dig up Lee Harvey Oswald's body, Jack Ruby, all of the Warren Commission's bodies and pin the assassination on Kennedy's poor sense of judgement that day. None of this makes any sense, but neither does Donald Trump's theories.
24 | Donald Edward Rice | 4 | 1338819142881001_1338829789546603 | Trump is a buffoon, an attention grabber, that's the only reason he ran, was for his name being mentioned over and over again, so when he looses BIGLY , he will be able to have a large group of Fans , as he calls voters, to listen to and watch TRUMP TV its coming November 9th stay tuned
25 | Al Snook | 2 | 1338819142881001_1338849056211343 | This is exactly how Dangerous Donald would govern. Get the uninformed, easily lead, hysterical core of his devotees, all upset over nothing. No knowledge, no facts, just wild speculation based on fanaticism. He caters only to the gullible.

Could the FBI director's bombshell stop Democrats from retaking the Senate?
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Randy Martin | 150 | 1338763509553231_1338771559552426 | I hope this FINALLY convinces Democrats that we are at WAR with Republicans. They will do or threaten anyone to further their cause because they can't convince people of their hardcore agenda fairly. I hope Democrats feel as "conned" as I do about Comey. Take off the gloves, stop treating the GOP kindly and do to them what they're doing to you!
2 | Geri Winston | 77 | 1338763509553231_1338764546219794 | Newsweek 10/31/16~ "Trump’s many decades of abusing the judicial system, ignoring judges, disregarding rules, destroying documents and lying about it is not simply a sordid history lesson. Rather, it helps explain his behavior since he declared his candidacy. He promised to turn over his tax returns and his health records—just as he promised to comply with document discovery requirements in so many lawsuits—then reneged. As a result, he has left a sparse evidentiary trail that can be used to assess his wealth, his qualifications for the presidency or even his fitness. Should voters choose him to be the next U.S. president, he will enter the Oval Office as a mystery, a man who has repeatedly flouted the rules. He has solemnly told the country to trust him while refusing to produce any records to prove whether he speaks the truth or has utter contempt for it.
3 | Pam Smith | 41 | 1338763509553231_1338770909552491 | Enough with the phony E-Mail crap......... We are over them all......... Let's get this thing done and won for Hillary and Tim and all Democrats running......Republicans are Destroying our Countryand our Government functions..........
4 | Chare Phillips | 19 | 1338763509553231_1338821652880750 | Vote blue to get the congress back.!! They have already promised that they will not work with Hillary. Remember they are doing that to president Obama! President Obama could have done so much more for us if the GOP congress let him but No they blocked everything.
5 | Deatra S Cragg | 18 | 1338763509553231_1338788899550692 | If Americans aren't scared then they have not been paying attention. When people at Trump rallies start chanting "Jew S A" and other anti-Semitic slurs loudly and without fear of condemnation it is time to be frightened.  If you do not know what I'm talking about try typing the word :Holocaust" into a search engine. The Guardian, a newspaper put out by the KKK, endorsed Trump and members are now making robo calls in some states.This "garbage" is now on the main streets of America because they feel empowered and the orange horror has given them a voice. Please, Please....vote blue! IT MATTERS!
6 | David Rogoff | 19 | 1338763509553231_1338772782885637 | Keep calling it a bombshell instead of the  nothing that it actually amounts to, and sure it will affect voters who are still undecided, idiots that they are.
7 | Aitalas Acrario | 2 | 1338763509553231_1339020006194248 | I don't think the FBI report would hurt the Democratic chance to retake the Senate. This will fuel the debate that the election is rigged against the Democrat. It is blatant obvious that the Republicans in the house and Senate placed tremendous pressure over Comey to find something in order to slow her momentum. Like it or not, Clinton is going to sail into the White House and even with all this rigging, investigation after investigation, she will win.
8 | Kelcy Cole | 0 | 1338763509553231_1339394219490160 | Here is how a Pres. Clinton gets control of the Senate....and the House for that matter. She does two things.  First, she directs the National Archives to give number one priority to FOIA'ing all 22 million recovered Bush WH emails and getting them published on a website.  She should also direct the DOS to find all of the Powell and Rice emails and do the same.  Powell did say he deleted all his from the private gwb43.com server because they were archived at DOS.She then meets with the GOP congressional members. She makes the request very public so if they refuse it sets them up for the next election cycle.  At the meeting with whoever shows up she states that if they do not cooperate to make this government function once again that she will call for War Crime Tribunals of the Bush administration.  If they try to prevent that then she will make the request to the UN to conduct them for us.  They have to be done at some point.  The last eight years were not the right time as we were trying to prevent the world wide economy from collapsing.  I'm not sure it is the right time yet because we American's are not emotionally stable enough to hold them ourselves.  But there are no statute of limitations on war crimes (like torture) so we could do it in the next twenty years when many of the culprits will still be alive even if the top two themselves are not.
9 | Bernie Thurston | 0 | 1338763509553231_1339300222832893 | Again, this is, in essence, the FBI Director's letter: Comey wrote a very strange letter to Congress that was long on innuendo and short on facts. He said that in a completely separate investigation, the FBI had found some emails that may or may not be related to Hillary, and indeed may or may not be significant at all. That's what actually happened. Everything else is BS.
10 | Stephen Grabe | 1 | 1338763509553231_1338805386215710 | ahhh...a trip down "memory lane"!!!   New York Times had to report the facts in June 2002:The General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, said today that ''damage, theft, vandalism and pranks did occur in the White House complex'' in the presidential transition from Bill Clinton to George W. Bush. The agency put the cost at $13,000 to $14,000, including $4,850 to replace computer keyboards, many with damaged or missing W keys. Some of the damage, it said, was clearly intentional. Glue was smeared on desk drawers. Messages disparaging President Bush were left on signs and in telephone voice mail. A few of the messages used profane or obscene language.Such classy people and we now know that Hillary Clinton took furniture from the State office for her home in Chappaqua, NY. Her staff is shown on video advocating violence at Trump rallies and ways to rig the election. Wikileaks reveal emails that prove the Clinton and her staff have denigrated Catholics, "doofus" Bernie Sanders, millennials, and patriotic Americans. But she really loves bankers.Why anyone would want these people anywhere near our nation's White House is beyond me."Read more at http://www.jewishworldreview.com/1116/colon110116.php3#zjE4LVQwlwbkfzGi.99
11 | Mary Bumstead | 2 | 1338763509553231_1338935339536048 | Kellyanne Conway snidely boasted about an October surprise heading the Clinton Direction last week while    talking with one of the msnbc anchors. I watch this channel so many hours a day that I can't remember who she was talking to. The smug look on her face and the way she knew something was going to happen makes me wonder how the Trump campaign knew about the emails on the laptop before it was released to the Senate. I am not an investigative reporter,  but I do have enough sense to put two and two together. I urge someone to go back and look at the interviews from last week and dig into the illegal leak from the FBI into the Trump camp.
12 | David Stupp | 2 | 1338763509553231_1338813202881595 | Hillary Clinton uses her position to lobby foreign donors of the Clinton Foundation for outrageous donations. She creates an illegal server to hide it all. She then deletes emails that are under a congressional subpoena. Then wipes the server clean and crushes all devices used with a hammer... Are you people that ignorant?
13 | Danni Brooks | 5 | 1338763509553231_1339119546184294 | Not if we don't let it! Everyone get out and Vote, help others to VOTE and when you get there Vote Democrat right down the ballot so Hillary will have support and we can stop some of the Obstructionism that is going on now!!!............Hillary 2016!!!
14 | Jeremy Kelly | 6 | 1338763509553231_1338765099553072 | If Clinton wins hopefully the Republicans will control the Senate and keep Washington in a deadlock. The less our government can do the better off the people are. The worst thing that could happen to our freedom is to let either party get too much control.
15 | Jonathan A. Washington | 7 | 1338763509553231_1338768852886030 | Comes is a Republican and he knew exactly what he was doing. What makes him a true Republican is the fact that he has not said anything about Trump ties to Russia. Also he will not give us more information.
16 | Jim James | 0 | 1338763509553231_1338948596201389 | This does not even deserve a comment. If voters will be influenced by nothing, then we Democrats never had a chance to regain the Senate to start with.

18 | Steve Lynn | 0 | 1338763509553231_1338784856217763 | The republican held Senate and House are 100% behind Trumps plans for 20 million new jobs, very low priced quality health care and very low taxes for all Americans. They will push this all through congress in the first week of his election.
19 | Daffodil Cee | 1 | 1338763509553231_1338923329537249 | People should read the Mother Jones Article about the Donald's connections to the Russian government.

America is fead up with the do nothing party of No!

22 | Al Snook | 1 | 1338763509553231_1338854762877439 | This is turning out to be such a blatant act, that Comey may have spurred the exact opposite effect.
