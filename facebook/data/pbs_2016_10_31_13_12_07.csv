Will Democrats win control of both the House and Senate on Election Day? The Washington Week panel provides a reality check.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | William H Boley | 7 | 10154528076181083_10154528181206083 | The Senate is still a tossup, and the House will remain firmly in the GOP camp. The Senate is the key, given the impact on the Supreme Court appointment process.
2 | Bill Stephens | 6 | 10154528076181083_10154528180281083 | I doubt the House, because of all of the Republican gerrymandering (case in point: Pennsylvania's 7th District). The House probably won't flip until the beginning of 2023, when the redistricting from the 2020 Census takes effect.

2 | Henry Green | 32 | 10154718761223675_10154718932743675 | "Hillary Clinton and Halloween Truth"Salem, Massachusetts - An old email server from 1692 belonging to Hillary Clinton has been found. After combing through the digital records from that year, it is clear Hillary is responsible for initiating the Salem Witch Trials. According to the emails from this server, she is a Witch and was willing to expose the other witches to remove all her competition. In email correspondence with the magistrates at that time, she was able to convince the Puritan leaders of her knowledge of the Bible and they followed her directives in convicting her adversaries in black magic and disposing of most of them before she had to stop or be exposed herself. The back story we are discovering, from these 1692 emails, is she was jealous of the other witches in Salem. She now uses her magical powers to control us for her evil ends of world domination. It is useless to resist. The power of her email servers have only increased through the centuries and her magical powers are unmatched. What people don't realize is she is responsible for manipulating Popes with her emails to exploit indulgences and prompt Martin Luther to begin the reformation, leading to centuries of division and conflict between Catholics and Protestants. Her magical powers are limitless. They have discovered her servers from 1776 and 1865. She corresponded with King George and flipped her allegiance back to the Colonies when they caught Benedict Arnold. It's all in the emails. In 1865, she was involved in the plot to kill President Lincoln. We would have never known without discovering the 1865 server! After a thorough investigation of new emails it is clear Hillary is responsible for the death of President Abraham Lincoln. The New Yorker reported this recently, but now the emails uncovered from her old server back in 1865 tell us the full story. According to the emails, she and Booth were romantically entangled, this was before Bill, and the emails are NC17 rated. They clearly indicate she wanted to get back at Abe. This had nothing to do with the war or any allegiance she had for the South. No, she was involved with Abe and he broke it off between them. She knew Booth was a Southern sympathizer and used him to get back at Abe. This is the real story of what happened. All true and now historically validated from her 1865 emails.Email evidence shows she was the brains behind the beginning of the KKK. Her email exchanges with Confederate General Nathen Bedford Forrest gives specifics to this history. While she pretended to support the Union, all of the emails from 1865 forward reveal she was a supporter of slavery and planned to undermine attempts for positive reconstruction. Forrest used instructions from her emails to set in motion the KKK. Only through these emails do we now know she was given the title Grand Wizard. This was a secret until the 1865 server was found.We are looking for her server from 1914. It is almost certain, from emails we have seen, that we will discover she was involved in the plot to kill Prince Ferdinand and helped begin WWI. Her server from 1929 is revealing to us how Hillary is responsible for the Great Depression. We knew this all along! On the same server, we see where she helped to formulate the Axis Powers of Japan, Italy, and Germany. She did this all through secret emails. We see no evidence of her involvement with Hitler or the holocaust, but that doesn't mean we won't find something later. She changed servers after WWII and went dark until she helped create the circumstances to keep Korea separated, North and South. Hillary's email server from 1959 was discovered and emails have been found to show she made the Cold War more complicated, is responsible for the fall of Cuba, and the fiasco of the Bay of Pigs operation. She is responsible for the deaths of President Kennedy, Martin Luther King Jr., and Bobby Kennedy. As we continued to go over the emails from the 1960's, Hillary is responsible for the Vietnam War, the sexual revolution, drugs, and Rock 'n Roll. She gave us Richard Nixon and then is the one responsible for Watergate. The emails show it was Hillary all along, not Nixon! Her emails from the late 1970's show she was behind the Iranian hostage crisis. In the 1980's her emails reveal her involvement in the first Iraq War. In 1990, she got a new server and used her magical powers to get her husband, Bill Clinton, elected in 1992 as President of the United States. Since then, it is clear she has orchestrated every major event through her magical emails to bring us to 2016. In 2008, she was only outmatched by the Warlock Barack Obama! That is another story.Yes, Hillary Clinton has been planning to become POTUS since her days in Salem from 1692. In just a few short days this will become a reality. She has already set the magic in motion and there will be no resistance. I just wanted to make everyone aware of these historical facts on this Halloween of 2016. In an era of post-rationalism, I'm sure some may read this post and possibly believe what I just said is true. This makes me very sad. I'm still amazed on a daily basis how so many people are willing to believe whatever nonsense someone may say about Hillary and give a pass to a con man who is an admitted sexual predator, et al! Oh well, we do live in a post-rational moment in time.Happy Halloween!

8 | Jim Williams | 6 | 10154718761223675_10154719054958675 | Unless the new emails reveal that Clinton cheated on three spouses, molested a dozen men, ripped off hundreds of workers and contractors and investors, defrauded hundreds of students, mocked a handicapped reporter, lost a billion on a casino in 1995 when the economy was booming, is going to court for fraud and raping a 13 year old boy, and used the money from her foundation to line her own pockets and bribe two attorneys general, I'm sticking with Hillary.

He went against all precedence and advice to no useful purpose except the obvious result: an uproar just before the election when undecided voters are at last making up their minds. He clearly needs to be charged under the Hatch act. The media needed to do due diligence and give this non-information the non-attention it deserved rather than a universal feeding frenzy for ratings. The emphasis now needs to be on these facts, to prevent a blatant attempt to affect the election outcome from having any chance of succeeding. Can anyone in the media remember what journalistic integrity is?
13 | Donald D. Mittelstaedt | 1 | 10154718761223675_10154719011513675 | The amazing power of belief in a false equivalency.  While the ill-advised practice of using a private email server has been highlighted a 1,000 times, it is being equated to the 1,000 offenses of Trump each being mentioned once.  People are guilty of making a moral equivalence by acting as if the choices are similar. Bad thinking, terrible politics!
14 | Wally McQuade | 0 | 10154718761223675_10154719010223675 | This is good.  Not because of Clinton or any other biases, but rather the proper handling of of classified information.  If she is indicted, then that'll make fir an interesting election.  If it occurs after the election, I bet she'll be impeached.  Even by a Democratic majority in Congress.
15 | Ralph Reinhold | 0 | 10154718761223675_10154719109283675 | Ne not-Hillary Clinton emails. The FBI said that the found metadata consistent with HRC's server. Since Wiener's wife had an account on HRC's sever and Abedin has state she had never used that computer. Why is the press not pressing forward the fact that the most likely scenario is that a wife wrote emails to her husband?
16 | Rick Heinz | 4 | 10154718761223675_10154718949513675 | If I was in charge of the Clinton campaign, I would suggest the following commercial for her: (Staring into a camera and talking to you) For thirty years I have done the best I can to serve the people of this country in various positions and assignments. Thirty years...and my choice of email systems is the worst thing my opponent can do to find dirt on me? While I don't really think I needed to do so, I have apologized to the American people for my choice of email systems. As it turns out that system was more secure than the State Department, the Democratic National Committee, the IRS and Target among other systems that have been hacked. And except for two emails that apparently I missed (because they were improperly coded) nothing of even remotely national security material was ever sent to anyone. And these two emails were also considered immaterial to the FBI's overall review. If you are voting for someone else because I used a private email system (despite that facts that my two GOP predecessors also used private email systems), you probably weren't going to be voting for me anyway. Please don't use that as an excuse because that would simply be wrong. But if you are an independent voter and you really think my choice of email system was worse than the career decisions of my opponent (and that is impossible for me to conceive that would be the case), then I deserve to lose. My thirty years of service have meant something for the families of this country. My opponent's decisions did not. Internet systems in this country are an important issue. Mine wasn't. My choice of email system did not affect the job I did serving this country. And that's the bottom line. But if you elect me President, I promise that we'll work on internet security together as a priority. Thank you and God Bless the United States.

23 | Marcia Tanabe | 3 | 10154718761223675_10154718888753675 | Had enough of scandals?  A vote for Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka and the Green Party is a vote for a viable multi-party democracy going forward."Just 5 percent of the national vote for the Green Party Stein/Baraka ticket can be a true game-changer for American politics. It will qualify the Green Party for recognition as an official national party, and for federal funding in the 2020 presidential race proportional to the amount of votes received ‚Äî at least $8 million to $10 million. It would also secure ballot access in a number of states that automatically grant ballot status if the presidential candidate receives anywhere from 1 percent to 5 percent of the vote (varying by state). It means the party can leap over the undemocratic barriers to ballot access for independent parties in many states, and help us lay the groundwork for a truly competitive challenge to the two-party system and the corporate rule it perpetuates."Third Party Presidential Forum:One week before what‚Äôs shaping up to be an historic presidential election, Tavis Smiley on PBS will host a presidential forum featuring the third party candidates, Jill Stein of the Green Party and Gary Johnson of the Libertarian Party.This forum will be taped live Monday, October 31, 2016, in the show‚Äôs Los Angeles studio and air on Tavis Smiley over two nights next week on Mondayevening and Tuesday, November 1 on PBS. An additional thirty (30) minute conversation, with questions selected entirely from social media will be available exclusively online at the Tavis Smiley PBS website.Viewers may submit questions to the candidates via Twitter, Instagram and Facebook using the hashtags: #TavisSmileyForum, #AskJill or #AskGary.

It's all about the money, not the person, the disease or lack overpriced insurance. The fight should be about bringing medical costs down in every area and not just about how to insure people. The entire industry is leveraged in a way to completely take advantage of the sick and the healthy. It's just stupid and inhumane. The entire industry should be regulated to ensure that everyone can afford to get sick.

Section 2071.For those of us who do not have United States Code committed to memory, here's what it says:‚Äú(a) Whoever willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys, or attempts to do so, or, with intent to do so takes and carries away any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both. (b) Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States. As used in this subsection, the term ‚Äúoffice‚Äù does not include the office held by any person as a retired officer of the Armed Forces of the United States.‚ÄùYes, it explicitly states "shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States.Shouldn't voters know that?

2 | Kevin Kennedy | 1 | 10154718530803675_10154718534213675 | Senator Reid appeared with Clinton today to push back against the ‚Äúinappropriate,‚Äù ‚Äúunprecedented,‚Äù and ‚Äúpuzzling‚Äù move by FBI Director James Comey to suddenly go public with new emails. Roughly two months removed from retirement, Reid is waging an all-out war on Comey as he claims a ‚Äúdisturbing double standard‚Äù took place in the FBI‚Äôs decision to publish this misleading announcement while essentially ignoring Trump.Reid pointed specifically to information the FBI allegedly has that ties Trump to Russia ‚Äì information Reid says they have intentionally sat on in order to not hurt the candidate‚Äôs chances of being elected.He expressed his ire in a blistering letter to Comey. Here‚Äôs a key passage:Your actions in recent months have demonstrated a disturbing double standard for the treatment of sensitive information, with what appears to be a clear intent to aid one political party over another. I am writing to inform you that my office has determined that these actions may violate the Hatch Act, which bars FBI officials from using their official authority to influence an election. Through your partisan actions, you may have broken the law.And it‚Äôs not as though one can accuse Reid of being blindly partisan since he previously defended Comey when Republicans tried to filibuster his nomination and subsequently delay his confirmation. Reid wrote:‚ÄúI believed you to be a principled public servant.‚ÄùThe actions of Comey were indeed politically motivated as he desperately wished to be loved again by law & order conservatives. But Reid just opened up a whole new can of worms.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images

The FBI's announcement that it is reviewing more emails related to Clinton might be this election‚Äôs October surprise.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Jim Williams | 203 | 10154716408888675_10154716754508675 | Unless the new emails reveal that Clinton cheated on three spouses, molested a dozen men, ripped off hundreds of workers and contractors and investors, defrauded hundreds of students, mocked a handicapped reporter, lost a billion on a casino in 1995 when the economy was booming, is going to court for fraud and raping a 13 year old boy, and used the money from her foundation to line her own pockets and bribe two attorneys general, I'm sticking with Hillary.
2 | John Fahres | 62 | 10154716408888675_10154716757448675 | Bullsh**.  Sorry, PBS, but you know I'm right. This is just a follow up to what has already been investigated, and they'll come to the same conclusion as they did last time.  *eyeroll*
3 | Carol A. Esterley-Ruff | 45 | 10154716408888675_10154716767648675 | Did you know~ NEWSWEEK 09/12/16 Clinton‚Äôs email habits look positively transparent when compared with the subpoena-dodging, email-hiding, private-server-using George W. Bush administration. Between 2003 and 2009, the Bush White House ‚Äúlost‚Äù 22 million emails. This correspondence included millions of emails written during the darkest period in America‚Äôs recent history, when the Bush administration was ginning up support for what turned out to be a disastrous war in Iraq with false claims that the country possessed weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and, later, when it was firing U.S. attorneys for political reasons.....Like Clinton, the Bush White House used a private email server‚Äîits was owned by the Republican National Committee. And the Bush administration failed to store its emails, as required by law, and then refused to comply with a congressional subpoena seeking some of those emails. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about as amazing a double standard as you can get,‚Äù says Eric Boehlert, who works with the pro-Clinton group Media Matters. ‚ÄúIf you look at the Bush emails, he was a sitting president, and 95 percent of his chief advisers‚Äô emails were on a private email system set up by the RNC.
4 | Rebecca Hudson | 12 | 10154716408888675_10154716762273675 | I talked to a group of intelligent people today, none of whom realized these emails weren't from her server, also heard the excuse that it's OK to vote Trump because he's not really going to do what he says, he's just saying that to get elected
5 | Mona Thornton | 17 | 10154716408888675_10154716848058675 | Shame on you PBS, for speculating about something which we have no information about, only innuendo. The media continues to act shamelessly. You should be spending more time covering the illegality of this action by Comey and review the Hatch Act for your viewers.

7 | Michele A Wilcox | 4 | 10154716408888675_10154717017843675 | This is coming from the legal counsel, Richard Painter, George W. Bush‚Äôs White House ethics lawyer from 2005 ‚Äì 2007, wrote about his problems with the FBI‚Äôs latest investigation of Hillary Clinton and, most surprisingly, he‚Äôs taking legal action to stop it. According to Painter, it‚Äôs an abuse of power. The Hatch Act specifically prohibits government officials, with the exception of the President, the Vice President and a handful of others from engaging in political activities. Painter is particularly concerned about the fact that FBI director James Comey has made comments about Hillary Clinton in the past, such as his statement that Clinton‚Äôs handling of classified information was ‚Äúextremely careless.‚ÄùWhat seems ‚Äúextremely careless‚Äù is the way Comey has handled this investigation.http://newcenturytimes.com/2016/10/30/bush-admin-just-got-involved-in-fbis-probe-into-clintons-emails-and-its-game-changing-image/
8 | Faye Matthews | 8 | 10154716408888675_10154716895048675 | The emails are old news. Move on. The October surprise was the audio of Trump's disgusting admission of being a sexual predator. Yes, we knew he had loose morals but this was criminal.
9 | Gerald Ott | 4 | 10154716408888675_10154716908283675 | The emails that Donald Trump has claimed will bring down Hillary Clinton are not quite the bombshell that he thinks, reports said Saturday. The revelation about new emails related to Hillary Clinton came out Friday, after FBI Director James Comey sent a letter to Congress on the matter, a move that triggered panic and sent stocks plunging. Trump quickly swept up the story and told supporters the scandal would be ‚Äúbigger than Watergate.‚Äù Yet an official told the Los Angeles Times late Friday that the emails in question weren‚Äôt sent to or from Clinton, nor did they contain any new information. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Comey‚Äôs letter to Congress was more a formality than anything else. http://www.thedailybeast.com/cheats/2016/10/29/reports-email-bombshell-not-much-of-a-bombshell.html?via=mobile&source=copyurl
10 | Connie Atkinson | 4 | 10154716408888675_10154716839098675 | I used to have a top-secret security clearance. I went through hours of training about what was, and what was not allowed and the SEVERE penalities for breaking the rules and I was NOWHERE NEAR at her level. If this is significant enough for her to be investigated and prosecuted and Clinton is not, it will cause a Constitutional crisis of epic proportions. If she is investigated after her election we will have years of gridlock. Either way, the American people are screwed. Thank you, DNC, for ensuring BS was not your candidate!
11 | Carol Harris King | 5 | 10154716408888675_10154716941493675 | They don't even know what the emails are, just that they're on a laptop used by A. Weiner. This is Republican shenanigans to throw the election to Trump. It won't work.

GO HRC!!
13 | Bobpen Walendzik | 5 | 10154716408888675_10154716863688675 | 1. You join a lying machine and call Hillary crooked. But you support a man who refuses to release his tax returns. You support a greedy, self serving, manipulative proven tax cheat. You support a crooked narcissistic psychopath who is worried his tax returns would reveal evidence of financial ties to Russian oligarchs and other dictators of the world. Just like we now know Putin's puppets illegally paid millions to his crooked former campaign manager, maybe he has been getting paid too. A corrupt little man whose daughter vacations with Putin's girlfriend. Making Russia great again? A con man who funneled millions of campaign money to his own companies and used campaign money to pay his family handsomely. Using his own words, a disgusting and corrupt man who surrounds himself with a disgusting corrupt people. 2. You say you love our veterans but support a man who believes POWs are not heroes because they were captured? A man who has shown he lacks emotional intelligence when he attacked families of a fallen war hero. A man whose company fired a veteran for being deployed to Afghanistan. A man who insults and derides our generals.3. You think a soulless, heartless small man who mocked a disabled reporter will make a good president. A man whose first instinct after a tragedy is always self-aggrandizement, like after Orlando mass shooting & when Dwyane Wade's cousin Nykea Aldridge was killed. As 3,000 people were dying, this man bragged about how 9/11 attacks were good for him & bragged about how his building is now the tallest in Manhattan just hours after the attack. When the pound fell to a 30-year low following the vote to exit EU, he boasted about making money off British economic uncertainty. When the housing market collapsed in 2008 and millions of Americans lost their homes, he said ‚Äú I 'sort of hope' real estate market tanks.‚Äù Trump is always looking out for Trump. How do you believe a greedy, narcissistic man who fundamentally lacks empathy and compassion will be a good president? He is not even a good person.4. You say you're patriotic & love this country but you support a man who has so little understanding of the basic parameters of our constitution's limits & has zero respect for it, except the part he uses to incite violence. A careless small man who asked Russia to spy on our former Secretary of State. A man who trash talks our NATO allies and our president but lavishly praises brutal dictators like Saddam Hussein, Kim Jong Un, Muammar Gaddafi, Vladimir Putin...etc5. You support a small man who has been married three times and has admitted to infidelity in the past. A man who was accused of raping his wife & has a federal lawsuit accusing him of raping a 13-year-old girl during a party hosted by convicted pedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein. A man who comments about his daughters breasts and body. Then you turn around and bring up Bill Clinton's history with women? I agree with you 100% Bill has a disgraceful history with women but no comparison to Trump who has said cringeworthy, disturbing things about women his whole life. May I remind you Bill is NOT running to be the next president. If you are saying oh, candidates spouses are fair game then you can't ignore that he is married to a woman whose naked pictures are all over the internet. 6. You support a man whose business career is a very long list of bankruptcies, defaults and deceptions because he is good for our economy? A man who was born into wealth and built that wealth by scamming, stiffing and bullying ordinary working citizens of this great country. 7. Yes, Hillary is not perfect, then again no one is. You call her dishonest but support a narcissistic pathological liar? Every time Trump opens his mouth every other word that comes out is a lie. Fact checkers have proven it over and over again. We are talking about a man who makes things up to spew hate and fear, like when he lied about seeing an Iran ransom video and a video of muslims celebrating in New Jersey on 9/11. The man is incapable of telling the truth and he is delusional.8. You support a hypocritical man who hired undocumented immigrants for his real estate projects & exploited our visa program. He is a man capable of solving our immigration problem?9. I agree 100% if she's elected Hillary and her whole family must distance themselves from the Clinton foundation. Let other people continue the great work the foundation is doing. With that said, you support a man whose foundation is found guilty of a pay-to-play scam and false claims of giving on its tax forms and then turn around and try to push fabricated scandals about the Clinton foundation. The IRS found the con man used funds from his charitable foundation to make a campaign donation to Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi. Just after 4 days of the bribe payment Pam dropped Trump U case. He also held $150K fundraiser for Pam after she dropped a criminal case against his university. His foundation claimed on its tax return forms that it gave $10,000.00 to The Giving Back Fund, but the organization says that donation does not exist. A man who completely retooled his charity to spend other people‚Äôs money. A man with deep ties to global financiers, foreign politicians and criminals. 10. You claim the con man whose line of clothing and accessories are made in Bangladesh, China, Honduras and other low-wage countries is the man to fix our labor laws? You claim the man who outsources everything is the answer to creating jobs here at home?11. You claim the unfit, unstable Putin's little puppet whose campaign is fully embracing alt-right's anti-Muslim and anti-Immigrant ideologies with all their conspiracy theories is the one to unite the country?12. You support a bottom feeder who put racial discrimination in housing at the heart of his real estate developments, started the birther movement, said "Obama would look perfect on food stamps, he has the right face for it,‚Äù and has shown he is prejudice with his actions & words over and over again. Then he pretends he cares about the black communities. He brings up Hillary's reference to a group of violent repeat criminals as "super-predators" in 1996? I don't agree with her choice of words all those years ago but she has apologized since. Something Trump refuses to do. Of course you can use all kind of deflection tactics & tell yourself whatever makes you feel better but the reality is if you are supporting a racist, misogynistic, xenophobic, bigoted, unfit, unqualified, disgusting con man, you really should admit to yourself you don't care what he says or does. You are using your hatred to cloud your judgement.

A vote for Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka and the Green Party is a vote for a viable multi-party democracy going forward."Just 5 percent of the national vote for the Green Party Stein/Baraka ticket can be a true game-changer for American politics. It will qualify the Green Party for recognition as an official national party, and for federal funding in the 2020 presidential race proportional to the amount of votes received ‚Äî at least $8 million to $10 million. It would also secure ballot access in a number of states that automatically grant ballot status if the presidential candidate receives anywhere from 1 percent to 5 percent of the vote (varying by state). It means the party can leap over the undemocratic barriers to ballot access for independent parties in many states, and help us lay the groundwork for a truly competitive challenge to the two-party system and the corporate rule it perpetuates."Third Party Presidential Forum:One week before what‚Äôs shaping up to be an historic presidential election, Tavis Smiley on PBS will host a presidential forum featuring the third party candidates, Jill Stein of the Green Party and Gary Johnson of the Libertarian Party.This forum will be taped live Monday, October 31, 2016, in the show‚Äôs Los Angeles studio and air on Tavis Smiley over two nights next week on Mondayevening and Tuesday, November 1 on PBS.

Four are refusing to vote at all as they consider the positions of both candidates irrelevant to them and the issues they face on a daily basis. Interestingly, three of the six also refuse to participate in Obamacare and choose to pay the penalty rather than a premium which subsidizes those more unhealthy than themselves. Their words, not mine. I have healthcare. The second eldest, a businessman in Texas, is voting for Trump. The eldest and most educated, a scientist with a bio pharmaceutical firm in Boston, is voting for Gary Johnson. Small sample, I know. But interesting. My husband is voting for Trump. I, after being democrat for 42 years am voting for Johnson. We do not push our views on them, or each other, and respect their choices.

Then he talks about gay marriage & how the govt shouldn't be getting involved, allowing it to become law when in fact, it was SCOTUS that ENSURED it was the law, deciding it's a right for all to get married. The interviewer didn't even correct the kid. Anyway, just saying these kids are the future, so education is important to the whole generation, they all want it & cheaper if possible. I'm glad they're tuning in at all, becuz Trump's made it a sleazy affair, he's just a terrible role model, and i will be glad when he's gone.

16 | Robin Belkin | 3 | 10154716230878675_10154716752623675 | This election is about everything but emails. This election is about extreme partisan obstructionism and ongoing perversions of our democracy and democratic processes in Congress, the Supreme Court, the FBI, and the media. This election is about the moral compass of America. It's about good versus evil. A stellar, 30-year public servant that is among the most qualified Presidential candidates in history versus Orange Hitler--the least qualified, most unfit, megalomaniac in American Presidential history. Here's what endangers America: electing a President with zero knowledge of the Constitution, zero experience in domestic and foreign affairs, zero relevant knowledge and preparation for the job, and a deplorable ongoing record of horrifying policies and behavior that is blatantly bigoted, racist, sexist, xenophobic, misogynistic, divisive, reckless, dangerous, and fear-mongering! America cannot and must not allow ersatz impartial FBI Director Comey to hijack another American Presidential election to put Orange Hitler in charge of the free world. Comey hasn't even read the emails because he doesn't even have a warrant to do so. So he has no idea what he's talking about and neither does anyone else in this regard. And...if Comey has read the emails, any information derived from them will have to be suppressed since it was obtained illegally--without a warrant. Yes, clearly, this is just another "Faux" scandal--Investigated ad nauseum like everything else Hillary's ever done, by a bunch of sore loser, obstructionist, partisan Republicans wasting obscene quantities of tax payer funds. Where were the Republican investigations of Bush-Chaney's 22 million "lost" emails and business conducted over private email by them and Republican Secretaries of State? Where are the Republican investigations of the Federal government's 21 million private citizens' data breaches? Where were the Republican investigations of the 3000+ lives lost on 9/11 during Bush's watch, 56 lives lost in multiple US Embassy attacks on Bush's watch, and all those in prior administrations? What a pathetic deception these incessant investigations of Hillary have been--shame on all of you. And shame on the media for aiding and abetting, and also publishing hacked and stolen private information by WikiLeaks--a violation of the right to privacy and so many other basic rights America is supposed to stand for! America: Make sure you can, in good conscience, respond to future generations that ask, ‚ÄúWhat did YOU do to stop Donald Trump? Godspeed Hillary.Trump faces a civil trial for fraud over Trump University. He has denounced illegal immigration while employing illegal immigrants to build his buildings. He claimed to have donated $102 million to charity without giving a penny of his own money. He is a pathological liar who keeps repeating falsehoods ‚Äî such as his claim to have opposed the Iraq War ‚Äî long after they have been debunked. According to Politico, he lies an average of once every three minutes and 15 seconds. One of the few times he told the truth was when he bragged about groping women against their will. A dozen women have come forward to accuse him of sexual assault. Another one claims he raped her when she was 13; that trial begins Dec. 16. This is not ‚Äúlocker room‚Äù talk. If true, these are criminal acts far more serious than anything in Clinton‚Äôs emails.What Trump is doing to our democracy is also a serious offense. He vows to lock up his political opponent, calls the election ‚Äúrigged‚Äù without evidence, and won‚Äôt promise to respect the result if he loses. This is an unprecedented and disqualifying assault on our political system.Another disqualification: Trump is the first candidate in decades not to release his tax returns. We know he hasn‚Äôt paid income tax since 1995, when he lost $916 million, contradicting his claims to be a boffo businessman, but we don‚Äôt know what other ethical landmines are buried in his records. Does he have financial as well as sentimental ties to Vladimir Putin? No way to know.We do know Trump is intolerant of dissent. He threatened lawsuits against his accusers and libel suits against newspapers that have reported their allegations. He wants to loosen libel laws to facilitate such suits. He has incited violence at his rallies. He is, in short, a budding authoritarian who should never be given control of the FBI and IRS.Trump lacks a presidential temperament. He gets flustered in debates. Imagine how he‚Äôd perform in a crisis. Trump is also almost completely ignorant of public policy. He says that U.S. and Iraqi forces blundered by not launching a surprise attack on Mosul, yet can‚Äôt explain how it‚Äôs possible to hide 30,000 troops in flat terrain. Trump is an utter con artist and buffoon that surely cannot be left in charge of the free world for goodness sake! (Ref.: http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2016/10/30/comey-fbi-clinton-trump-scandals-lying-women-max-boot/93009718/)‚ÄúThe Hatch Act prohibits FBI officials from using their official authority to influence an election. Reid said that by releasing this information, which he says is not conclusive or pertinent, Comey may have broken the law. Reid referenced a memo from Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates from March of this year that establishes all Justice Department employees, including Comey, are subject to the Hatch Act.Reid accused Comey of having intent to aid one political party over the other in the election and called his behavior a "double standard" due to the fact that, as Reid claimed in the letter, Comey has information related to Donald Trump's dealings with Russia."I wrote to you months ago calling for this information to be released to the public," Reid writes. "And yet, you continue to resist calls to inform the public of this critical information.""By contrast, as soon as you came into possession of the slightest innuendo related to Secretary Clinton, you rushed to publicize it in the most negative light possible."Reid is not alone in claiming that Comey violated the Hatch Act. In a New York Times op-ed, Richard W. Painter, the chief White House ethics lawyer under George W. Bush from 2005 to 2007, says that he filed a complaint the F.B.I. with the Office of Special Counsel, which investigates Hatch Act violations."Violations of the Hatch Act and of government ethics rules on misuse of official positions are not permissible in any circumstances, including in the case of an executive branch official acting under pressure from politically motivated members of Congress," Painter writes in his opinion. "Such violations are of even greater concern when the agency is the F.B.I." (Ref.: http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/30/politics/harry-reid-letter-hatch-act/index.html

It would also secure ballot access in a number of states that automatically grant ballot status if the presidential candidate receives anywhere from 1 percent to 5 percent of the vote (varying by state).

2 | Nattie Xjay | 367 | 10154716180138675_10154716293713675 | NEWSWEEK 09/12/16 Clinton‚Äôs email habits look positively transparent when compared with the subpoena-dodging, email-hiding, private-server-using George W. Bush administration. Between 2003 and 2009, the Bush White House ‚Äúlost‚Äù 22 million emails. This correspondence included millions of emails written during the darkest period in America‚Äôs recent history, when the Bush administration was ginning up support for what turned out to be a disastrous war in Iraq with false claims that the country possessed weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and, later, when it was firing U.S. attorneys for political reasons.....Like Clinton, the Bush White House used a private email server‚Äîits was owned by the Republican National Committee. And the Bush administration failed to store its emails, as required by law, and then refused to comply with a congressional subpoena seeking some of those emails. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about as amazing a double standard as you can get,‚Äù says Eric Boehlert, who works with the pro-Clinton group Media Matters. ‚ÄúIf you look at the Bush emails, he was a sitting president, and 95 percent of his chief advisers‚Äô emails were on a private email system set up by the RNC.

The FBI Director should step down. His behavior was shamefully unprofessional. If we are to have confidence in the FBI, it must be free of political influence. One of the most frightening aspects of a possible Trump presidency is that he would misuse the Justice Department, the FBI, and his power to nominate federal judges as a tool of revenge against people he doesn't like or who get in his way. It's started already and he hasn't been elected.
10 | Abigail McElroy | 19 | 10154716180138675_10154716479113675 | Forgive me, but it all dosen't quite make sense to me. Maybe the Fed's should call Google to see how email works. But it seems all of us with a username and password can access our email on a variety of devices. Yes you'd have to log into a server here, but something dosen't stack up in my head the Fed's can't find emails until they collect everyone's laptops when they can practically find anything about any of us going through our email trash bins. A server these days can be accessed out of the office. All stuck on machine by machine makes zero sense to me. It's the modern age.This seems to be info they could have already had access too to begin with before weiner. I don't have any idea Clinton's reaction as I'm so sick of the election I just have tuned it out for weeks. But to me , as close as we are to election day, this looks like a smear campaign to steer votes.
11 | Herb Craven | 23 | 10154716180138675_10154716416248675 | This is looking more like a hatchet job every minute, and it's doubtful there's even anything there. Typical Republican move, though: party before country every time.  It's long past time for the GOP to be relegated to the dustbin of history.  They've been a cancer on democracy since at least the 90's.
12 | Edward Ader | 12 | 10154716180138675_10154716552123675 | By now, you've probably heard some news about a bewildering letter sent to Congressional leaders by the Director of the FBI.This is all a bit confusing, and much of the reporting has been misleading or downright inaccurate, so I want to take a minute to walk through this. Bear with me!Here's the quick backstory: In July, FBI Director James Comey concluded a year-long investigation by deciding not to go forward with any case about Hillary's emails. It wasn't even a close call, he said. In his words, "no reasonable prosecutor" would have brought charges.Yesterday, in a surprise to us all, Comey wrote a very strange letter to Congress that was long on innuendo and short on facts. He said that in a completely separate investigation, the FBI had found some emails that may or may not be related to Hillary, and indeed may or may not be significant at all.It's since been reported that these emails may not have even been sent by or to Hillary; that they weren't withheld by Hillary or the campaign in the earlier investigation; and most or even all of them may be duplicates of emails already in the FBI's possession. It's being reported that Comey sent this letter over the objections of Department of Justice officials who told him that it was inconsistent with longstanding policy of both Democratic and Republican administrations not to take action that might impact an election. It's an unprecedented intrusion into a close presidential election with 10 days until Election Day.But by being vague and obfuscating, Comey opened the door to conspiracy theories and Republican attacks. There is no evidence of wrongdoing, no charge of wrongdoing, and no indication that any of this even involves Hillary.Voters deserve answers.Comey needs to come clean with the American people about what he found and answer all the questions about why he took this unprecedented step less than two weeks before the election.Trump has spent more than a year trying to bully his way to the presidency. He's been browbeating the FBI (indeed, many have speculated that Comey took this extraordinary action in part to reduce the pressure on his agency that Trump's campaign and his Republican Congressional allies has been building up), leading crowds in chants of "lock her up," and even saying Hillary should be in prison -- and if he won, he'd put her there. Trump's always shown a complete disregard for the truth. In spite of there being no new information, he's already raising money off the bizarre letter (he literally sent a text message asking for money within an hour of the story breaking!) and he's more fired up than ever on the trail today. These are the actions of a desperate man. Trump knows he can't win on his character, temperament, or his policies. He's behind, so he'll cling to whatever he can.Get out there and vote!  Vote Blue All The Way!
13 | Jim Williams | 19 | 10154716180138675_10154716353963675 | PBS is grossly irresponsible for reporting this story without stating the facts. In his story on the e-mail today, Michael Isikoff says "As of Saturday night, the FBI was still in talks with the Justice Department about obtaining a warrant that would allow agency officials to read any of the newly discovered Abedin emails, and therefore was still in the dark about whether they include any classified material that the bureau has not already seen."
14 | Judi Heath | 12 | 10154716180138675_10154716474053675 | They haven't even got warrants yet to view the emails, so they have no idea if they are even relevant, and he reports this to Congress right before the election?  Obviously a Hatch Act issue!
15 | Sharon Pugh | 12 | 10154716180138675_10154716572373675 | I think Comey should resign. He has overstepped his authority and may have compromised the prosecution of Anthony Weiner. He alleges there are Clinton emails, but we have allegations and a witch hunt. Our justice system has hit a new low. How do you get the public to believe in and obey the law when it has been compromised?
16 | Michele A Wilcox | 8 | 10154716180138675_10154716682063675 | This is coming from the legal counsel, Richard Painter, George W. Bush‚Äôs White House ethics lawyer from 2005 ‚Äì 2007, wrote about his problems with the FBI‚Äôs latest investigation of Hillary Clinton and, most surprisingly, he‚Äôs taking legal action to stop it. According to Painter, it‚Äôs an abuse of power. The Hatch Act specifically prohibits government officials, with the exception of the President, the Vice President and a handful of others from engaging in political activities. Painter is particularly concerned about the fact that FBI director James Comey has made comments about Hillary Clinton in the past, such as his statement that Clinton‚Äôs handling of classified information was ‚Äúextremely careless.‚ÄùWhat seems ‚Äúextremely careless‚Äù is the way Comey has handled this investigation.http://newcenturytimes.com/2016/10/30/bush-admin-just-got-involved-in-fbis-probe-into-clintons-emails-and-its-game-changing-image/

Since the Supreme Court's ruling on Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, special interests like the NRA have been able to flood our elections with money. It's given them outsized influence and taken the voice away from the American people, who overwhelmingly support commonsense gun safety measures, such as comprehensive background checks or blocking terrorists from buying guns.The NRA's political spending has tripled since the Citizens United decision in 2010. In 2014 alone, the NRA spent nearly $30 million to influence elections.Worse, Citizens United has allowed a handful of billionaires to funnel millions of dollars to groups like the NRA for them to spend in elections. For example, the Koch brothers' network has given the NRA more than $10 million since 2010.It's no wonder why the NRA opposes a constitutional amendment to end Citizens United and instructed members of Congress to vote against it."http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/the-judiciary/290948-reversing-citizens-united-key-to-breaking-logjam-on-guns

‚ÄúMy ultimate goal is to have a world in which we can survive and thrive,‚Äù Stein recently told the Associated Press.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Alex Heidarian | 129 | 10154715461838675_10154715659893675 | As a liberal I think she's our own Ben Carson: renowned in the medical field but doesn't now jack about the complexities of political issues.
2 | Marcia Greenberg | 61 | 10154715461838675_10154715742283675 | If you care about these issues, you have to vote for Hillary Clinton. If Trump is elected, there will be no progress and potentially serious back-sliding.
3 | Liam Clayton | 57 | 10154715461838675_10154715576813675 | She's a froot loop that thinks student loan debt can magically be erased through Quantitative Easing and an economy with a $19 trillion GDP can be powered by windmills.
4 | Ariel Cruz | 48 | 10154715461838675_10154715743758675 | I voted for Bernie Sanders against Hillary Clinton in the ny primary and I agree with Jill Stein on pretty much everything but we can't allow trump to step one foot into the WhiteHouse. As of today Jill Stein is polling at 1% . If you supported Bernie Sanders and everything that he stands for and accomplished we should follow his advice and vote for Hillary Clinton in this election.
5 | Jeffrey Lowe | 28 | 10154715461838675_10154715622303675 | I'm not a Stein supporter, but she has good points.Why are we still reliant on 70 year old technology to get around, but demand a new smartphone technology advancement every year?How come the government can pretty much make up a way to bailout banks for three trillion, but can't help out student debt for one trillion?
6 | Ben Marascalco | 25 | 10154715461838675_10154715766438675 | This race is too close, this woman needs to be as smart as she wants people to think she is and bow out of this race NOW.Hillary will give her some steps to climb higher. Maybe next time, it was fun while it lasted, not please sit down and vote for Hillary.
7 | James W. Nickola | 10 | 10154715461838675_10154715689393675 | Stein is getting my vote. She is controversy-free, she is not corrupt, she walks the walk, and she is right on the issues.Yes, not only can we forgive student debt, we can fund public higher education completely. The Democrats are not offering almost everything she is offering. Clinton adopted Sanders's rhetoric. The hard-fought planks in the Democratic Platform will never see the light of day. The proof is in her record. True Progressive change will never happen by fighting only from the inside, people. It's going to take a strong Progressive third party in addition to electing true Progressive Democrats. Again, the proof is in the history.Nobody ever said she or anyone could waive a magic wand to accomplish a true Progressive agenda. Quantitative easing is one way to erase student loan debt, though very difficult. She never said it was the only way or the way she would do it. That notion was delivered by a John Oliver comedy sketch that was not only wrong but did not reflect the Stein campaign's actual response. What she said is that there are several ways to achieve this goal.Those who think Hillary is the way to go think that voting for a true Progressive third party candidate helps Trump. Those who support Trump decry the same thing. But voting for either of these two candidates is voting for the status quo. By not standing up, you are helping to maintain the status quo. Meaningful change will never come, that way.Invest your vote by voting for true Progressive candidates. Invest your vote in a strong Progressive party, not in a corrupt duopoly. It's not just about this cycle. It's about building the movement, moving forward.
8 | David Evan Karasek | 6 | 10154715461838675_10154716098088675 | If you're going to make your case do it as Bernie Sanders did and at least move the needle in the correct direction. Otherwise she's no better for our political future than Ralph Nader, whose third party candidacy pulled votes from Al Gore, thereby electing George Bush. By doing what Stein is doing or by voting for her we are undermining everything she stands for.
9 | Eugene E Perales | 6 | 10154715461838675_10154715614878675 | We spend trillions on the wrong things. When we should be investing on the future of our country. Our students. We could have removed the burden that holds them down.
10 | Mary Bunk | 6 | 10154715461838675_10154715989653675 | She is estimated to get 2% of the votes.  She will win no states' electoral votes.  So a vote for her is a wasted vote when you could have one that counts towards your state's electoral votes.
11 | Becky Street | 3 | 10154715461838675_10154716458698675 | Student debt, climate change and  irresponsibly convincing folks that voting for her will make a positive difference in the outcome of this election. Vote Blue!
12 | Morgan Daniel Beck | 1 | 10154715461838675_10154716911733675 | I compare voting for Jill stein to young men sitting around on the side lines of helms deep crossing their arms as the kings army rushes past them frantically trying to ward off the onslaught of Orcs that are trying to break into the fortress. When someone yells at them to pick up a weapon and fight, their reply would be "Theodan is just as bad as Sauron. Perhaps it would be better if Sauron won that way we can truly start a revolution"
13 | Michael Wells | 1 | 10154715461838675_10154717219398675 | As somebody who is almost finished paying off student debt, I think it's completely fiscally irresponsible to make a claim that you're going to erase it. Easy to say for someone who knows they won't be elected so they don't have to follow through on their promises. More disgusting political pandering. College students will vote for you if you give them free stuff. It sucked making compromises in order to pay it back but how about instead of just eliminating debt which only further puts the national debt in the hole, you deal with the root issue? People who study STEM generally don't have problems with student loan debt. How about you give colleges a reason to stop lying to teenagers about what wonderful things liberal arts degrees are going to do for them and you start pushing science, math and computers harder in high school and younger? How about you start there?

16 | Judith Clark | 1 | 10154715461838675_10154716098303675 | Great, our world is so messed up, but you just keep writing about a woman who can't win, won't win and who can potentially put us in the hands of a madman. Great work.

18 | Peter Joseph Hogenson | 1 | 10154715461838675_10154716833698675 | Seems like a lot of these folks commenting are reading off the troll script they got from CTR. Word-for-word claptrap. What could be more kooky and fruit loopy than being a Hillary (or Trump) troll at this stage of the game?
19 | John Kocher | 2 | 10154715461838675_10154715901063675 | I don't believe her estimated cost of all this being $500 Billion. This is similar to Bernie's plan and that is estimated to result in an increase of at least $10 Trillion to the national debt. It was $9 Trillion in 2008. It's now over $20 Trillion. Add $10 more and it's $30 Trillion which would be more than one and a half times the GDP. Totally unsustainable!üí∏üí∏üí∏üí∏üí∏üí∏

"Many primary care practitioners have been avoiding the battle against opioid addiction and opioid overdoses. But they shouldn‚Äôt." (via STAT)
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | John Parker | 7 | 10154715262713675_10154715730883675 | Too few patients in need have functional relationships with primary care, or any primary care at all. Opioids and pain meds in general (important pain management for a percentage) have become a dangerous default solution for millions, along with an ocean of unregulated supplements. Otherwise caring and ethical physicians are made complicit in this dysfunctional and wildly expensive, broken system. It's an inexcusable burden on our economy, no longer hurting just the most vulnerable.
2 | Ike Udechukwu | 2 | 10154715262713675_10154717106703675 | Why should primary care providers deal with opioid addiction just because the addicts are now Caucasians? Did we ever ask primary care providers to deal with crack addiction when it affected Black folks? Affluenza is the cause of the opioid addiction in the Caucasian community.
3 | Adrienne Gorlen | 5 | 10154715262713675_10154715467533675 | 1) Patient satisfaction is the new patient care mantra. Make the patient happy. 2) If people want opiates they will doctor hop until they get them, don't blame it on all physicians.3) The USA's love of suing will be a deterrent to PCPs wanting to treat people with addictions.
4 | Marsha Stapleton | 0 | 10154715262713675_10154718810483675 | They should ban opiods except in the hospital settings where they can be controlled. Many people hooked and not even knowing.  There are other alternative methods of treating pain. It is just easier for the docs to write a script.
5 | Brent Woods | 1 | 10154715262713675_10154715650513675 | Addiction is an existential crisis: Addicts can see that life has no apparent meaning. They come into life, and no one can tell them what is actually is? As long as they have a rabbit to chase, they can live with it, but when the rabbit is caught, or seen to be fake... they flip. Can a primary doctor answer that for them?Are doctors the new Priest?
6 | Mark Simchock | 0 | 10154715262713675_10154718943073675 | So you think people with addiction are going to the doctor? On the regular? That's pretty funny, if it wasn't so ridiculous. Keep in mind, healthcare is already inundated with obesity and its related ills.
7 | Eugene E Perales | 1 | 10154715262713675_10154715577613675 | I totally agree that we should have a choice. Everyone has a conflict with the way there doctors prescribed meds. People know what's good and what works.
8 | Kathy Frost | 0 | 10154715262713675_10154717788148675 | And there is not any affordable alternative to opiates to manage pain and nobody's willing to pay for the Dr's visits to track this problem or correct it
9 | Mike McKinnon | 0 | 10154715262713675_10154715738698675 | Addiction is an illness of the body, mind and spirit. Man can treat the mind and body. However, there is only one who can cure the spirit. That one is God, may you find Him now.
10 | Mark Davidson | 2 | 10154715262713675_10154715440133675 | They push the drugs to create addicts and then they push the drugs for recovery (Methadone, Suboxone) and then they push to get over them BIG PHARMA SUX
11 | MacFarland Whitesmith | 0 | 10154715262713675_10154717040503675 | .... recovered opioid addict here. All the good drugs came in pill form. Why do u think they aren't fighting addiction... think hard. #VoteTrump#DrainTheSwamp

14 | Mark Davidson | 1 | 10154715262713675_10154715597003675 | You cannot take drug's the rest of your life that mask the problem with no cure with ton's of side effects
15 | Bill Scott | 0 | 10154715262713675_10154716066483675 | That's because addiction is a disease of the mind not the body. Trading the body does no good if the mind is weak.

18 | Barbara Landin | 2 | 10154715262713675_10154715451723675 | This needs to start in med school. Doctors need to be educated about substance use disorders to recognize the signs and symptoms. Additionally doctors need to decrease the amount of prescriptions they write for Opioids. Lessen the number of pills per prescription  and have dialogues with their patients about the risk of continued use.

22 | Joe Armstrong | 0 | 10154715262713675_10154715726493675 | FOLLOW THE EMAILS...THEN FOLLOW THE MONEY!Any real investigation on the Clinton emails should be identifying the email recipients and also those who had emails sent to them from any of the Clinton inner circle.  It should also include Bill Clinton's emails, and Chelsea Clinton's emails and those of the Clinton Foundation.  The emails from the DNC, the Clinton Campaign, and the Clinton foundation will lead to many other discrepancies and if there is a conspiracy going on, these emails (both to and from) would prove it.Second...follow the money.  Find out if the State Department gave insider trading information to any of them from government sources which they then manipulated to their donors for both the Clinton campaign and the Clinton Foundation.  My best guess is that insider trading has occurred and many of these donors gave huge sums of money so they could profit from them on the stock market.  I'm betting the Federal Trade Commission will be the next investigations.Millionaires and billionaires do not give away exorbitant sums of money unless they can profit on it.

1 | Ail Cunningham | 10 | 10154715198893675_10154715752198675 | So proud of these women! Not only do they fight for a voice but to have the courage and determination to do this in an archaic world polluted with double standards and harassment. I support these women and let's get out of the dark ages!
2 | Elsa Mexia | 11 | 10154715198893675_10154715383473675 | She could have emailed Satan and she is still 1000 times better than the liar Trump. He is a self admitted sexual predator, accused of raping a 13-year-old and the case is set for December, another case in November for the fraud he committed at trump university, and let's not forget that he did business during the Cuban embargo with Cuba which is a federal offense, he doesn't pay his workers, has a proven pay for play with that attorney general in Florida and she drops her investigation of trump university four days after accepting his illegal donation from his phony foundation , insults a gold star family that sacrificed their son fighting for this country, insults veterans, war heroes, the disabled, women and minorities. His economic policy does not add up and trusted economists have said his plan will cause another recession and deeper unemployment. He is thin skinned and can be baited with a tweet. Do you honestly want that kind of temperament to have the nuclear codes? I could go on since this list is not even complete, but when you compare trump to Hillary, this email thing is trivial.
3 | Mary-ann Wythe | 3 | 10154715198893675_10154716249433675 | 1 year ago Justin Trudeau (Canadian Prime Minister) made half his cabinet women. When asked by a reporter why it was so important he replied because it's 2015. My neighbours - Americans, it's now 2016!
4 | Luly Betancourt | 6 | 10154715198893675_10154715465383675 | Excellent! More women representing the population can potentially give government a very different perspective, for everyone. Hopefully though, these women are both Dems and Gop. And even Liberals or Progressives. Not just conservatives. If all they get from these political development series is hardcore conservatives it won't be much better than what we already have. We must open our minds to others who think and feel differently. In order to work together.
5 | John Florack | 4 | 10154715198893675_10154715660838675 | I'm surprised it's that high. Utah is predominately Mormon and Mormon's like their women domesticated and pregnant and they do a good job of keeping it that way.
6 | Shawn Kidwell | 0 | 10154715198893675_10154715523943675 | by this logic, all office and work settings that are over the majority of female must higher males... but you sure as hell dont see that

It has been a turn of events since the last debate‚Äîwhen the Donald learned he was losing terribly, he resorted to the final deep end drive into the conquest for the bottom of the barrel‚Äîhis campaign has been always about impure rhetoric but this time, he didn‚Äôt pretend for a second, what I don‚Äôt understand though is why a man would pride in being remembered for the creepiest things ever said for a man as old as 70 years.

FBI Director James Comey acted independently when he sent several members of Congress a letter about the emails on Friday, according to a government official.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Janet Craddock Molen | 279 | 10154715022063675_10154715044203675 | Comey may have broken the law himself. The Hatch Act of 1939 does not allow political stunts such as this. There is precedent about jumping the gun during elections in regards to this act.
2 | Ken Dabbs | 112 | 10154715022063675_10154715093328675 | Comey doesn't have a warrant in place to actually review the emails and yet he sends a letter out? He has to go.
3 | Maria Guillory | 92 | 10154715022063675_10154715070283675 | Compared to Drumpf, Hillary is 550+% more knowledgeable, more capable, more prepared to lead our country. Emails are the only thing that Drumpf has except hate, fear, racism, bigotry, misogynistic behavior... Drumpf is going in front of a judge regarding fraud (fake university) on Nov. and rape in Dec. (the victim was 13 when he raped her). There is NO comparison!!! NONE!!Issues - Environment, Hillary knows that climate change is real. Drumpf denies it. Education, Hillary is for investing in our future through education. Drumpf loves the uneducated votes (his words not mine). Humanity, Hillary believes ALL humans are created equally. Drumpf, thinks very little of women, people of color and others (and if you think Drumpf is a Christian, you have been conned royally), Hillary is in favor of equal pay and raising the minimum wage. Drumpf thinks minimum wage is too high. Yet, people earning $7.35 cannot survive. Hillary's entire  career has focused on serving all Americans. Drumpf has taken his entire life. The Clinton Foundation invests 87% of all of its funds to charities around the world. Drumpf's family Foundation buys stuff for him (NY forced them to stop soliciting). When the GOP starts investigating the 60+ deaths at US Embassies under Reagan and the 90+ deaths at US Embassies under W. And, investigate the war criminals W & Cheney for lying to congress to declare war which has caused 4,000+ deaths of American soldiers as well as thousands of soldiers and thousands of civilians, than talk to me about Hillary.Also, when Drumpf releases his taxes (showing his Russian ties because no American bank will lend him money after his 4 bankruptcies), we hear his fraud (fake university) and rape cases, than talk to me about Hillary.Hillary knows the constitution and knows that ALL Americans have the same rights and privileges, she has committed her career to serving others and well SHE IS QUALIFIED!!! Do not buy into the GOP's smoke screens. They have proven over the last years that they are ONLY concerned about the 1-2% oligarchs NOT ALL Americans. VOTE--Mil. and the generation after that, please go vote!!This election is too important to not vote!!
4 | Kj Eastman | 97 | 10154715022063675_10154715023118675 | this was an organized hit on Hillary .. this was conspired.
5 | Stephany Kleinberg | 62 | 10154715022063675_10154715031188675 | The memo was released to republican leadership only. This was a strategic move by Comey. Nothing less.
6 | Fern Torres | 37 | 10154715022063675_10154715136078675 | It's political...always has been ...people the Supreme Court is at stake it's the only way republicans are keeping their ideology alive. Demographics aren't in their favor anymore and their scared to death. If you look at the gun nuts around the country they're losing their minds. Eventually their gonna act out and get violent.
7 | J.a. Morgan | 32 | 10154715022063675_10154715377373675 | So she's had to run against Trump, Julian Assange, Russia, GOP, and the press, and yet she's still here and standing and crushing Trump in the polls. Americans are smart and know who they want as President and sure doesn't look like it's Trump.
8 | Vicki Soto | 24 | 10154715022063675_10154715109648675 | This post is for the Ladies Only! PLEASE COPY and Pass it On!Ladies, for years we have been told by men that we are not good enough.Now we are being told that a woman is not good enough to be President.Even though her male opponent doesn't like women, boasts of sexually assaulting them andinsults women if they are not drop dead gorgeous! It's time for us to stick up for ourgender. We know women run the household, the country and the world. It's time for usto vote for a women. Remember, that no matter how much your guy says you have to vote forthis dispicable guy... your vote is private and personal. When you get in that booth, Vote for us.. it's time thatwe made this country great again!!!!
9 | Sam Arinze Okibeike | 15 | 10154715022063675_10154715237103675 | Political historians are noting that the last time an FBI director was this politically controversial was in the days of J Edgar Hoover (over half a century ago).....although it is a well known fact that FBI director, Comey is a republican, the bureau is constitutionally guided by ethical responsibility, which prohibits it from being politically biased, especially thrusting itself in the middle of a presidential election with 9 days to general election.....truly unprecedented!
10 | Patricia Saviet | 18 | 10154715022063675_10154715108193675 | I think this is a stunt to try to loose Democratic voters. So.... guess Comey is a Trump supporter. Hopefully the FBI and officials in government can get him to remember he can be fired.
11 | Michel Samson | 23 | 10154715022063675_10154715113668675 | This kind of political "coup" is known in American presidential elections as the October factor, a political stink bomb served too late in the month for any incumbent to really address before the vote and meant to hurt his or her campaign. In the 2016 election, it will be known as the FBI Director's stink bomb.
12 | Linda Yaeger | 10 | 10154715022063675_10154715391393675 | So it was announced also he has no warrant to even go into the electronics to look at the emails in question, is he relying on 1800 psychics or does he know that the emails are copies of ones already known or what? There is a whole lot of bad stink on this man and Chavetz
13 | Bryan Banks | 15 | 10154715022063675_10154715111933675 | Democrats knew what they were getting. She was under criminal investigation when they voted for her in the primaries and nominated her for president. No one should be surprised by this.
14 | Frank Brock | 4 | 10154715022063675_10154715175978675 | This isn't unprecedented.  The 1992 indictment of Caspar Weinberger, which was later thrown out, pretty much handed the election to Bill Clinton.  That indictment was processed four days before the election, at a time when there was very little early voting, and could have waited until after the election.
15 | Jeremy Boggs | 5 | 10154715022063675_10154715183453675 | I like how this article says Trump has no evidence for "His assertion" about the DoJ, but we are just supposed to believe NPR with its "anonymous" sources. Lol, the liberal media is going to squirm because things don't go how it wants. There is no evidence for your assertion NPR.
16 | Karl Dworak | 8 | 10154715022063675_10154715295248675 | That her husband met with the head of the Justice Department, Attorney General, Loretta Lynch, while the case was still under review was also unprecedented.  Where was your indignation then?
17 | Lana Miller Caywood | 7 | 10154715022063675_10154715221273675 | Does anyone know the members of Congress who received the letters? Were they all republican? Has Comey been promised something by the GOP to sabotage the election? Too bad we don't have good investigative journalism answering these questions.
18 | Valia Rasuli | 2 | 10154715022063675_10154715301073675 | Um. This entire thing is a ruse. Comey will resign... but it isn't about this. It's about how much detail he gave when they announced they would not recommend charges against her.  He made it clear that she did break the law (if you have read the law: negligence with classified info = guilt), but they were not going to recommended charges against her. Wake up, people. So much corruption has been discovered surrounding these people and you keep saying, "Well, she was never charged!" Ever wonder why? It isn't for lack of evidence. Her and her husband have too much power and influence. You don't want to be the person to take them down.
19 | Patti Layden | 4 | 10154715022063675_10154715168143675 | Comey didn't follow FBI protocol but he had no choice. If he went to Lynch she would have squashed it and Obama would have backed her up. There is not one individual in all of Washington that has any integrity.
20 | Sal Mistretta | 3 | 10154715022063675_10154715446083675 | Comey did this because of 2 words: Preet Bharara. Preet is investigating Weiner (sounds funny), Weiner flipped (funnier) & gave Preet his laptop, hopefully it was sanitized first (not Bleach Bit). All roads then lead to Hillary.
21 | Jaz Singh | 3 | 10154715022063675_10154715807588675 | Not surprising this racist FBI Director would do this days before the election to influence it the other way. He is a Republican as well. Racist Republican = Trump Supporter. Maybe there should be an investigation into his actions? http://nypost.com/2015/02/13/fbi-chief-james-comey-everyones-a-little-bit-racist/?0p19G=chttps://www.facebook.com/dailykos/posts/10154792082149255
22 | Steve Turner | 1 | 10154715022063675_10154715621683675 | You rather expect the head of the FBI to stay above this sort of thing. But then after the attorney generals private meeting with Bill?? Why do we as a people have such a fondness for all of these despicable people?
23 | Henry Gomes | 3 | 10154715022063675_10154715330723675 | Comey needs to go! His unprecedented political bias and lack of ethical judgement deems him unfit for such a position in our democracy!
24 | Beverly Kreuer | 6 | 10154715022063675_10154715245528675 | Oh stop already. Clinton mishandled classified information. There are basic security measures in place and all who handle such receive training. That training is repeated and increases in scope with the higher the security clearance. We're being expected to believe that she didn't know or comprehend these measures yet she knew how to create a private server, unauthorized, get it funded, get personnel to tend to it (all of whom now plead the fifth from fear), and to use bleach bit in addition to physical destruction of U.S. property. Keep that in mind as well, what she destroyed was government property.  Continue to deflect, stick your fingers in your ears, and sing nah-nah-nah. I'm sure the good fairy will sprinkle your dreams with fairy dust and leave you lollipops for breakfast.
25 | Loretta O'Brien | 2 | 10154715022063675_10154716511028675 | Comey should be sacked forthwith for bringing the FBI into disrepute by introducing party politics. Civil Servants are supposed to remain impartial at all time no matter which political party is in power. He FAILED, HE FAILED HE FAILED.

Justice Department officials had advised Comey against sending a letter to Congress on the emails.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Jerry Savage | 231 | 10154712947368675_10154713451973675 | This announcement was completely unwarranted. The FBI hasn't even reviewed the emails. Now Trump is going to use this to spread lies and hysteria about emails. It's perfect for Republicans. There's no proof of any wrongdoing but it's easy for them to mislead people into thinking there is.
2 | Suzanne Allen Crabtree | 67 | 10154712947368675_10154713486648675 | By now, you've probably heard some news about a bewildering letter sent to Congressional leaders by the Director of the FBI.This is all a bit confusing, and much of the reporting has been misleading or downright inaccurate, so I want to take a minute to walk through this. Bear with me!Here's the quick backstory: In July, FBI Director James Comey concluded a year-long investigation by deciding not to go forward with any case about Hillary's emails. It wasn't even a close call, he said. In his words, "no reasonable prosecutor" would have brought charges.Yesterday, in a surprise to us all, Comey wrote a very strange letter to Congress that was long on innuendo and short on facts. He said that in a completely separate investigation, the FBI had found some emails that may or may not be related to Hillary, and indeed may or may not be significant at all.It's since been reported that these emails may not have even been sent by or to Hillary; that they weren't withheld by Hillary or the campaign in the earlier investigation; and most or even all of them may be duplicates of emails already in the FBI's possession. It's being reported that Comey sent this letter over the objections of Department of Justice officials who told him that it was inconsistent with longstanding policy of both Democratic and Republican administrations not to take action that might impact an election. It's an unprecedented intrusion into a close presidential election with 10 days until Election Day.But by being vague and obfuscating, Comey opened the door to conspiracy theories and Republican attacks. There is no evidence of wrongdoing, no charge of wrongdoing, and no indication that any of this even involves Hillary.Voters deserve answers.Comey needs to come clean with the American people about what he found and answer all the questions about why he took this unprecedented step less than two weeks before the election.Trump has spent more than a year trying to bully his way to the presidency. He's been browbeating the FBI (indeed, many have speculated that Comey took this extraordinary action in part to reduce the pressure on his agency that Trump's campaign and his Republican Congressional allies has been building up), leading crowds in chants of "lock her up," and even saying Hillary should be in prison -- and if he won, he'd put her there. Trump's always shown a complete disregard for the truth. In spite of there being no new information, he's already raising money off the bizarre letter (he literally sent a text message asking for money within an hour of the story breaking!) and he's more fired up than ever on the trail today. These are the actions of a desperate man. Trump knows he can't win on his character, temperament, or his policies. He's behind, so he'll cling to whatever he can.Get out there and vote!  Vote Blue All The Way!
3 | Ted Wetherby | 72 | 10154712947368675_10154713460333675 | FBI investigation is in there. This man is incompetent this investigation has not been concluded and it appears that these emails are duplicate's of an earlier email's.. He says he is no longer a Republican but this sure is a republican tactic...
4 | Truman Williamson | 27 | 10154712947368675_10154713466328675 | Comey has been a lifelong Republican, although he recently said he is no longer registered as one. But that‚Äôs just the start of his lengthy and long-standing ties to Republican politics, including past donations to GOP presidential candidates.
5 | Karen M Kirk | 34 | 10154712947368675_10154713505623675 | Comey just totally politicized the FBI, who have always struggled and been successful at remaining partisan free... until now... well actually it started in July when he gave his OPINIONS after giving the facts about her server, then his testimony in Congress where he went too far again! ...and now THIS! ...I've heard that MANY inside the FBI are furious over his actions and the long-term damage he has done to the FBI!
6 | Lynne Kelly | 33 | 10154712947368675_10154713509268675 | What is being held over James Comey's head? His actions defy logic. He has had a distinguished career, and now this... Something dosent add up.
7 | Dan Hagen | 6 | 10154712947368675_10154714405818675 | I have to crack up at all the fake liberal Hillary supporters trying to justify her criminal actions. If this were a republican you guys would be all over this.
8 | Bryan Chris | 8 | 10154712947368675_10154713515403675 | It would have been more 'suspicious' to the GOP to have waited until after the election. This way there's no chance they can say it was the result of some political maneuvering that she got into the Whitehouse ahead of the investigation. If you didn't want such a problematic candidate, you should have nominated Bernie Sanders. Then we wouldn't be in this mess, our candidate would be equally qualified, and after eight years of calling Obama a socialist, trying to attack Sanders in the same way would've seemed hallow and empty.What a loss for all Americans, that we were unable to see the next FDR come to office.
9 | Bob Brault | 11 | 10154712947368675_10154713520658675 | Comey just torched his career. Retire tool! This is what happens when.you keep Bush retreads around too long...
10 | Robert Trout | 7 | 10154712947368675_10154713598663675 | ‚ÄúWhy *Comey* announced, etc.‚Äù: Comey‚Äôs a lifelong Republican. He abuses his position at every opportunity to give Republicans talking points all tied up in a bow to use against HRC. Unethical as hell, but as we all know, IOKIYAR. :/
11 | George Goldstein | 18 | 10154712947368675_10154713519523675 | If Comey had really been concerned about keeping Congress updated, he could have easily requested to brief them in a closed-door meeting in a classified setting. But he did not, which begs the question as to his true motives.
12 | Denise Soto Hall | 18 | 10154712947368675_10154713460383675 | A witch hunt! The laws re cyber security have changed! This email probe is an abuse of process!
13 | Bruce Mccoy | 2 | 10154712947368675_10154713524618675 | You mentioned 'obligation' as a key word. I think 'revise my previous testimony' is more revealing, i. e., change 'no intent' to 'intentional'.
14 | Beverly Graham | 13 | 10154712947368675_10154713500053675 | He and Chaffetz should be investigated. Chaffetz bragged just days ago he was going to keep investigating her and gee whiz, here comes this cryptic letter. Comey should at least be reported to the Bar.
15 | Lucy McAllister | 3 | 10154712947368675_10154713925203675 | Hillarys muslim brotherhood aid from the State Department opened state departments email on her husbands lap top computer at home, the one he used for sexting young girls....... she used it to open state department emails and print them out, ... that is dang illegal and you all know it so deal with it, it is a felone, illegal.  You cant sugar coat stupid..... its illegal.
16 | Ray Voyer | 0 | 10154712947368675_10154716345013675 | Yeah, the same justice dept. headed by Loretta Lynch, you know the one who met with Bill Clinton privately for an hour on her plane while his wife was under fbi investigation but there's nothing to see here. Move along sheep.
17 | Chris Martens | 3 | 10154712947368675_10154713549128675 | How dare the FBI tell Congress, or voters, they found thousands more emails and reopened the investigation. Since when do voters have the right to know what's going on in their government or that a candidate is under criminal investigation by the FBI.
18 | Josh Deal | 1 | 10154712947368675_10154713538363675 | He wasn't made aware of the findings until Thursday afternoon. Comey did Clinton a favor by sending Congress a notification on Friday afternoon.
19 | Gary Mandehr | 2 | 10154712947368675_10154714908788675 | So ,   back up the truck !  Hillary really is Wonder Woman. As far back as i can remember she has accomplished feats of wonder. Stole half the state of Arkansas in a fraudulent real estate deal. Swindled millions from white house transportation fund, killed a guy and left him on a park bench, single handedly allowed terrorists to attack an embassy and held at bay the entire of our armed forces to intervene, and had a private email server so she could undermine the American government to achieve her goal as a traitor. Wow she has super powers. ... give me a break, really ?   Get a life people, move along, nothing here, see ya in the funny papers.
20 | Remy Jagla | 3 | 10154712947368675_10154713627228675 | What could these "emails" possibly tell us anyway? That she left guys for dead in Benghazi because it was to dangerous to get them? Like this has never happened with recent presidents? Vietnam being in gross numbers of soldiers left for dead? The ones that did make it back, are denied jobs, quick access to health care with PTSD and lose everything? Are these emails speaking of private agencies meant to keep America safe from even the criminals in or own govt. Newsflash! Hollywood isn't great these days but movies have been made about this for the last 20 years. If you go into the military you risk dying if it isn't safe enough to get you out. Hence why you are all heroes. Meanwhile Trump will not only fight against women's daughter's health rights but he'll grope them and laugh about it in your absence. Niether candidate is good, btw, but do not tell my Hillary is the first defense secretary to ever knowingly let soldiers die.
21 | Shannon Tapley | 1 | 10154712947368675_10154713542863675 | DREAM FROM A PROPHETIC WATCHMAN:I was on the tarmac in an airport. Hillary Clinton was disembarking from a very expensive airplane. She came right up to me and jabbed me with her finger and was very close to me, trying to tell me something. I looked at her and her eyes were all wonky, kind of looking the wrong way, and she had some sort of nervous tic going on in her face. She looked at me and then pointed towards the White House. I could feel how much she wanted this, to be there. As she did this, a blood-red sun appeared behind the White House and glowed. (This next part gets a little graphic, so I apologize).Blood appeared around the White House and started to fill up its hallways. It kept flowing until it was near the tops of the hallways, and as this happened, small handprints of children in blood marked the walls. The blood flowed out from the White House until it flooded America.They were trying to erect some sort of a statue. This statue was a woman in a very small toga-ish looking outfit. She had a goblet of wine and her head was back, laughing. She has babies, curiously, around her (the statue) but she didn't seem concerned for them, and wasn't holding them or anything. They were literally slogging through about three feet of blood to get this statue up. They succeeded.After this happened, a nuclear bomb hit us. The earth was scorched and black, and there was literally hardly any people left. The food was gone, the water was poisoned. Hillary sat in the White House, surrounded by jewels and food, and she laughed at the people. Her head was thrown back and laughing.The next part of the vision:Donald Trump was in the White House. As he walked through the halls, wheat fields sprang up all around the US. People were in these fields, and quite a few children. The children were holding hands and singing. There was a feeling of well-being and happiness.Now here is the surprising part. A nuclear bomb or some other kind of bombs still hit us. As the bombs hit the US, the wheat fields absorbed them, making them harmless. The more we got hit, the more the children sang. Donald Trump turned to me at a podium, pointed to the sky and said, "They're still coming, but now we're ready." He chuckled like a Dad would and smiled at me. He turned towards the people with great affection and fatherly kindness. He really cared for them like they were his own.Donald Trump was then trying to drag a cross onto the top of the White House. He was encountering some opposition, and I don't know if he made it to the top or not. But he was trying very hard. He was sweating on his brow.The last part of the dream was the people in the fields looking up at the sky, where that was some grayish clouds and a disturbance. They were looking up expectantly, not afraid.That was the end of the dream.
22 | Jim Williams | 1 | 10154712947368675_10154715571033675 | The Bundy traitors are set free while the Dakota Pipeline protesters are attacked with military and police Nazis and the media thinks Hillary's e-mails are a bigger deal than Russia and the FBI trying to help Trump decide our Presidential election.
23 | Gregg Franklin | 1 | 10154712947368675_10154713897773675 | Saying the FBI won't be able to review these emails before the election is pure BS.  How many times do regular working people come back to the office after a vacation or business trip to in inbox somewhere in the 4 figure range and had to take care of ALL of them that day.  Why is the FBI slower?
24 | Dennis Chang | 1 | 10154712947368675_10154714208208675 | The justice dept said they might not prosecute it even the FBI had evidences and recommended it. Then said so under the critics. Then their boss paid a very friendly visit the suspect's family plane. What a great old tradition we should all respect!!!
25 | John Melvin | 0 | 10154712947368675_10154717652113675 | There are links between officials in the DOJ and the Clintons, they will support Hillary in this stoush, friendships, connections, they are important to all of us. Mrs Clintons friends will stand by her whether she has done anything or not, that's life.

1 | Russell McAnally | 29 | 10154712424053675_10154713391118675 | I live in SC and yes there are lots of good jobs but you have to jump through a lot of hoops to get full time with any of them. Most people are just permanent temps with poor to no benefits. They keep people so insecure and afraid that people adopt a mindset of just being happy to have a job. This may be a pro corporation state but it is also a anti employee state. The tax breaks given to the companies coming here are made up for by the below national average income of the people that live and work here.
2 | Robert Barnes | 5 | 10154712424053675_10154715957943675 | "Motivated workforce" IOW low pay, few opportunities for those jobs and lots of competition. This also translates to lower wages as noted in the article. This in turn translates to fewer taxes collected to fund schools and infrastructure. What they really don't want to say is that despite their conservative, anti-labor position, they actually attract companies to the state by massive corporate welfare. Pure and simple.
3 | JoAnne Ellis | 0 | 10154712424053675_10154715096393675 | Exactly how predatory have the temp agencies become PBS NewsHour? Two years seems like a very long temporary job, at less than $10 and hour. A few lines about Boeing federal contracts could prove enlightening too. And how many of the countries listed as importing jobs, are leaning towards "gasoline free, if not auto free" in twenty years or less. (We used to refer to Boeing as the largest unemployer in WA. Forewarned is forearmed SC. It's very cyclical.)

Clinton boast how she helped create jobs in Upstate New York. And so her current jobs plan for America is a carbon copy of the plan she used in Upstate New York. There's only one problem Clinton didn't create any new jobs in Upstate New York. From Oct 2001 to Dec 2006 Clinton lost 31,000 jobs in Upstate New York. Hillary bad at trade,and job creation.

We can bring it back but the jobs will be low pay with many working as permanent temps as pointed out by Russell's informative comment.

I don't know how America can ever compete in manufacturing without poor paying jobs and loss of benefits.

TX had only 7 forms of ID while a another state has upward of 40. We don't need national ID cards. We need sane people in elected positions that can work through issues.
3 | Karen Snair | 0 | 10154712708183675_10154717459298675 | What's the big deal? Up here in Canada, we've had to show government ID to vote for years and years. All we need to show is our driver's license, passport picture, or our medicare cards. It takes two minutes and then we have the freedom to vote for dumb, dumber or dumbest. The aim of photo ID is to ensure the person is who they say they are.
4 | Julie Williams | 5 | 10154712708183675_10154714336043675 | Why not have one federal standard voter ID law and card with photo for elections involving government offices.

Republicans all claim they know how economics works. To them it means to give away for pretty much free public and, private lands to Corporate America along with the people‚Äôs personal wealth. What makes it really bad is Corporate America demands that the economy works this way or else they are not going to participate. It makes it really hard for people like the democrats who are trying to work economic prosperity for the country from the middle class out. We need to be Stronger Together with Hillary Clinton to stop republicans from throwing our good programs out the window for their own personal gain. Hillary Clinton is really good about getting some of this money back and, re-distributing this money around the world to places that need it. Hillary Clinton knows what she is doing and, has easily defeated republicans on everything they have thrown at her. Hillary Clinton is going to be our next President. Let‚Äôs all unite together democrats, independence and, republicans so, that we can grow the economy from the middle class out. Hillary Clinton will stop Corporate America from refusing to invest in America. Look! you can‚Äôt pull your money out of the economy so, why should Corporate America be allowed too. You are 100% invested in the economy rather you know it or, not. It just makes economic sense that you see we are all in this together. This is the only way prosperity at its best can work for all of us. Are you going to just sit there and, watch your children‚Äôs futures be stripped and, drained while Corporate America continues to make a fortune off of financial markets and, never passing one dime to main street? Republicans seem to take great pride in themselves not to improve anything and, only make things worse. Everybody knows about Obamacare and, republicans refusal to make it better. Obamacare sat a standard for good medical healthcare insurance for all. You can‚Äôt be sold junk medical healthcare insurance anymore. It is not the failure that republicans claim. 16% of people who get their healthcare through the market place may be affected by a rate increase. These people which isn‚Äôt that many may want to change to another plan or, pay the increase. How is that a complete failure? Over the fact that it sat a good standard for good healthcare for all compared to buying junk medical healthcare insurance for all. Obamacare is no failure by any means.  Hillary will stop republicans from defunding all the good America has to offer and, build the economy from the middle class out. I am sick and tired of watching Republicans defund our services only to liquidate the assets and, give these funds away to someone from a foreign country or, off shore. Hillary Clinton is wise and will put a stop to these republican renegade ideas and, put America‚Äôs wealth back into to the pockets of the middle class. That's why I'm standing Stronger Together with Hillary Clinton and, the Democrats. (The party of empathy)

DO NOT CONTRIBUTE TO THE HORRIBLE SUFFERING. WE HAVE MANY REPORTS, PHOTOS AND VIDEOS SHOWING THE HORRENDOUS TORTURE. SOME OF THE PICTURES SHOW PEOPLE ENJOYING THE TORTURE, LAUGHING AND APPLAUDING. ARE WE WILLING TO GET THAT BLOOD ON OUR HANDS BY CONTRIBUTING TO IT?

Colorado and Vermont have the largest percentage of women serving on their state legislatures, and Louisiana has the smallest.

Where is your journalistic #COURAGE and #INTEGRITY? Your silence is approval. I expect better from you PBS. Your social media thread is pathetic. You are not staying on top of this important story. SHINE A BRIGHTER LIGHT ON THIS STORY. COWARDS.
