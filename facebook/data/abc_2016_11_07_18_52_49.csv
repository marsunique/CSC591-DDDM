Hillary Clinton is hitting three important states on the final day of her campaign, with her team seeming confident that her road to the required 270 electoral votes is secure.

1 | Brian Eubanks | 4 | 10154989665683812_10154989670328812 | When this election is over will you be proud of how you acted? Will you be able to say you showed dignity and were honest or did you hurl insults and spread lies? I don't mean will you be satisfied with the results and think that the ends justified the means but will you truly believe that you showed respect, dignity and honesty.
2 | Russell Friscia | 6 | 10154989665683812_10154989672433812 | Trump will win the popular vote; Clinton will win the electoral vote-- and once again, the will of the People will be overruled by a rigged system.
3 | Zach Kerman | 14 | 10154989665683812_10154989667688812 | Michelle Obama said if Donald Trump is elected: "We're telling our sons it's okay to humiliate women. We're telling our daughters this is how they deserve to be treated.".... that's funny. So does that mean that if Hillary Clinton is elected, we are teaching our sons & daughters that it's ok to murder, lie, cover up, be corrupt, demean women, use racial slurs, and stay with a spouse that openly rapes women & cheats on you?

5 | Mary Anne Kilgore | 0 | 10154989665683812_10154989679748812 | It will not happen! Look at Obamacare now After receiving billions of dollars from OBAMA and Hillary IRAN is talking about nuclear weapons save our country! VOTE TRUMP!
6 | Ryan Michael Ballow | 2 | 10154989665683812_10154989675008812 | That's because folks assume she'll take PA, possibly FL, Nevada, and Michigan. And I believe Trump will take all of those states. Trump may not win in a landslide, but my prediction is a lot of assumed blue states will be blood red. It'll be close, but I'm quite confident Trump will edge her out in the EC.
7 | Russell Parker | 0 | 10154989665683812_10154989673263812 | Remember in the debates when Hillary accused Trump of using some of his foundation money to buy a portrait at a charity auction? She was APPALLED! Well... it turns out the Clinton Foundation paid for Chelsea's wedding. Maybe that fact slipped the lying hypocrite's mind.
8 | Gary Doan | 0 | 10154989665683812_10154989677888812 | We now live in a country where a Trump sticker, can get your car burned. A Trump hat, can get you physically attacked. Campaign headquarters are being firebombed. Innocent men and women are being attacked by goons, paid to incite violence. The dishonest media is guilty. Journalistic integrity is nonexistent and propaganda is the norm. You can‚Äôt have government corruption, without media corruption. We have both.
9 | Tomas Davis | 8 | 10154989665683812_10154989667533812 | With Clinton's loss be on the lookout for liberal violence and attacks. The threat is real for the American public, be alert and ready to protect your home and children.

Trump would be analogous to punching herself smack in the face. The suffragettes, who endured pain and humiliation in their horrendously difficult fight to get you the right to vote, would turn over in their graves if you cast a vote for this pathological lying demagogue. I'm sure that their souls are standing proud because finally our country has its first woman presidential candidate in Hillary R. Clinton. The time has been overdue to break the gender barrier.üéÄüíïüíï

18 | Steven Smith | 0 | 10154989665683812_10154989678678812 | Against Donald TrumpFrom The Atlantic: "Donald Trump, on the other hand, has no record of public service and no qualifications for public office. His affect is that of an infomercial huckster; he traffics in conspiracy theories and racist invective; he is appallingly sexist; he is erratic, secretive, and xenophobic; he expresses admiration for authoritarian rulers, and evinces authoritarian tendencies himself. He is easily goaded, a poor quality for someone seeking control of America‚Äôs nuclear arsenal. He is an enemy of fact-based discourse; he is ignorant of, and indifferent to, the Constitution; he appears not to read."This judgment is not limited to the editors of The Atlantic. A large number‚Äîin fact, a number unparalleled since Goldwater‚Äôs 1964 campaign‚Äîof prominent policy makers and officeholders from the candidate‚Äôs own party have publicly renounced him. Trump disqualified himself from public service long before he declared his presidential candidacy. In one of the more sordid episodes in modern American politics, Trump made himself the face of the so-called birther movement, which had as its immediate goal the demonization of the country‚Äôs first African American president. Trump‚Äôs larger goal, it seemed, was to stoke fear among white Americans of dark-skinned foreigners. He succeeded wildly in this; the fear he has aroused has brought him one step away from the presidency."Our endorsement of Clinton, and rejection of Trump, is not a blanket dismissal of the many Trump supporters who are motivated by legitimate anxieties about their future and their place in the American economy. But Trump has seized on these anxieties and inflamed and racialized them, without proposing realistic policies to address them."In its founding statement, The Atlantic promised that it would be 'the organ of no party or clique,' and our interest here is not to advance the prospects of the Democratic Party, nor to damage those of the Republican Party. If Hillary Clinton were facing Mitt Romney, or John McCain, or George W. Bush, or, for that matter, any of the leading candidates Trump vanquished in the Republican primaries, we would not have contemplated making this endorsement. We believe in American democracy, in which individuals from various parties of different ideological stripes can advance their ideas and compete for the affection of voters. But Trump is not a man of ideas. He is a demagogue, a xenophobe, a sexist, a know-nothing, and a liar. He is spectacularly unfit for office, and voters‚Äîthe statesmen and thinkers of the ballot box‚Äîshould act in defense of American democracy and elect his opponent."http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/11/the-case-for-hillary-clinton-and-against-donald-trump/501161/

23 | Rebecca Laskey | 0 | 10154989665683812_10154989675288812 | DONALD TRUMP ANNOUNCEMENT ~ REGARDING THE NEWSWEEK REPORT:TRUMP IS A ‚ÄúHUGE‚Äù NATIONAL SECURITY RISK BECAUSE OF HIS BUSINESS, FINANCIAL AND PERSONAL TIES TO RUSSIA, CHINA, SAUDI ARABIA, IRAN, ETC‚Ä¶..In a stunning and damning expose just released, the truth behind the ties between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin are revealed, and American allies in Europe are growing increasingly concerned by Russian espionage and its interference in the U.S. election.A Friday Newsweek article by Kurt Eichenwald reveals the truth behind the Trump campaign and its ties to Russia‚Äôs President Vladimir Putin. It also shows the history behind Russia‚Äôs support of the Republican candidate through espionage and cyberattacks discovered by both U.S. and allied European intelligence agencies.According to Eichenwald, American allies are concerned about Russian interference in the U.S. election and that Donald Trump‚Äôs statements denying any collusion in recent cyberattacks have only encouraged Putin to become more aggressive in his espionage against Western countries. Eichenwald cites the input of government officials, law enforcement officers, and intelligence agencies in both the U.S. and Europe.According to information gained by Western allied intelligence sources, the Kremlin‚Äôs interference into the U.S. election is aimed more at crippling Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in revenge for what Putin felt was interference in Russian elections. Clinton‚Äôs statement in 2011, saying the Russian election was ‚Äúneither free nor fair‚Äú in regards to obvious cheating, has sent Putin into a rage and made him determined to destroy Clinton. Putin was also enticed by Trump‚Äôs compliments of his strength as a leader.Some of the information gained by Western intelligence sources reveal that Donald Trump has been surrounded by a number of advisers with ties to Putin or with financial and family ties to Russia. Former campaign manager Paul Manafort was forced to resign when it was revealed that he had ties to a pro-Russian Ukraine official. Carter Page, another former Trump adviser, is being investigated by U.S. and European intelligence agencies for engaging in back-channel discussions with Russian officials. Intelligence has also revealed that Trump adviser Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn is intimately tied to RT, a Russian news agency involved in distributing Russian propaganda.Donald Trump and his campaign have also been found to be spreading Russian propaganda. The Kremlin has been distributing misinformation as part of their normal activities via various networks, through both anonymous internet trolls, RT, and Sputnik, another propaganda news source. A manipulated document from one of the anonymous internet sources found itself being recited by Trump at a campaign rally. The campaign has also been spreading rumors from Sputnik, including a piece attacking Newsweek that was forwarded by Trump staff to a number of reporters in the U.S. with requests that those reporters pursue the false story.In accordance with his position as presidential nominee, U.S. intelligence agencies have briefed Trump about Russia‚Äôs attempts to influence the election, but Trump has persisted in publicly denying these serious allegations, calling them unreliable, and dismissing them as possibly being perpetrated by some ‚Äú400-pound guy sitting on their bed‚Äù or even a child.European officials have told Newsweek that Trump‚Äôs statements have alarmed our NATO partners, because Trump refuses to believe the intelligence briefings he received or simply doesn‚Äôt understand them. They are also convinced that Trump could be misleading the American people for reasons of his own.One British official said that members of the U.K. government who are fully aware of Russia‚Äôs interference find Trump‚Äôs response ‚Äúquite disturbing.‚Äù They‚Äôre concerned that should he be elected, Trump would ignore and dismiss his own and allied intelligence services.Western law enforcement and intelligence agencies say that the Russian hacking and disinformation campaign includes tens of thousands of people in Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Novosibirsk. They say there are also operations inside the United States, working from New York City, Miami, and Washington D.C., mainly using Russian immigrants, although other foreign nationals and American citizens are also involved. According to intelligence received, those involved are being paid via a Russian pension scheme. One U.S. official told Newsweek that evidence shows that many of the Americans and other foreign nationals involved are unaware that they are part of Russia‚Äôs propaganda machine.American intelligence is also aware that Russia used cyber espionage and propaganda to interfere with other elections in the West, including the German elections last month and the June Brexit vote in the U.K., the results of both of which weakened the ties between those countries and the EU and NATO.According to a European intelligence expert, Russia is releasing its disinformation to disrupt the U.S. election through WikiLeaks, but states that the ‚Äúpipeline‚Äù through which the information flows contains numerous steps and so many filters that it is likely that the WikiLeaks organization itself does not know the source of the information.Interestingly enough, despite the Russian president‚Äôs support of Donald Trump, at one point, support for the Republican nominee was halted due to his volatile and unstable nature. According to intelligence sources, the Kremlin backed off supporting Trump when he attacked the Kahn Gold Star family publicly. The Kremlin assumed that the nominee would be forced to withdraw from the race due to his psychological unfitness, so put the hacking campaign on hold. According to reports provided to Western intelligence sources, even Putin thought Trump was unfit to be president, despite the advantages to him of a Trump presidency.According to information provided to Western intelligence agencies, Putin is satisfied that his campaign of cyber espionage has turned the tide in his direction. Putin has told his associates that even if Clinton wins the White House, she will be too busy rectifying the chaos that his leaked misinformation has wrought to interfere with his plans in Syria, Ukraine, and elsewhere.European allies are particularly stunned by Donald Trump‚Äôs refusal to credit his own intelligence services, and British officials were particularly horrified when Trump dismissed the validity of those sources. According to one British official the most disturbing evidence of Trump‚Äôs negligence was during the third presidential debate. In rebuttal to Clinton‚Äôs accusation that he was encouraging Russian cyberattacks, Trump said that she had no idea where the cyberattacks were coming from.‚ÄòHillary, you have no idea‚Ä¶ Our country has no idea.‚ÄôAccording to Newsweek, all of our intelligence sources and those of our NATO allies know that Russia is behind the hacking. Although Trump has been briefed, he continues to dismiss the information. Eichenwald sums up the exposes with some chilling thoughts:‚ÄòShould the United States, the last remaining superpower, tilt its policies away from NATO to the benefit of Russia, the alliance between America and Western Europe could be transformed in unprecedented ways. And so, for perhaps the first time since World War II, countries in Western Europe fear that the American election, should Trump win, could trigger events that imperil their national security and do potentially irreparable harm to the alliances that have kept the continent safe for decades.‚ÄôIF YOU CARE, SHARE!

Vermont, Wyoming, Oregon, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Iowa, Delaware, and Alabama, write in Bernie too. Everybody else, your job is to vote third party so we can be rid of Trump/Clinton and kick this thing to the US House. The goal, keep Trump and Clinton out of the top three. Oh and big thanks to Utah for leading the way and going third party, neither Clinton nor Trump will reach 270. Lets try to keep them out of the top three America!

18 | Cheryl Gage | 0 | 10154989660828812_10154989679618812 | Trump has a shocking number of pending charges & legal cases against him. They are both civil & criminal in nature.1. When Trump asked his supporters to vote for him on November 28th, this Freudian slip revealed the depth of his concern with that date. November 28th is the day on which Low v. Trump University LLC, a jury trial, goes forward under U.S. District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel, born in Indiana. Yes, he is the same Federal judge that Trump insulted. 2. There is a 2nd pending California case, Cohen v. Trump. Judge Curiel allowed this case to go forward under the Racketeer Influenced & Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). This is huge for a lot of reasons. First, this case will disclose Trump‚Äôs actual net worth. Second, he would have to pay back everyone he defrauded. Third, RICO carries criminal penalties!3. In NY, State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is suing Trump University for fraud. 4. The sleeper here is his BLATANT violation of the federal election laws.  ‚ÄúContributions and donations may not be solicited, accepted, or received from, or made directly or indirectly by, foreign nationals who do not have permanent residence in the United States. This prohibition encompasses all US elections; including federal, state and local elections. 5. Jane Doe v. Trump involves the rape of a 13-year-old & his 'terrific friend',  convicted pedophile, Jeffrey Epstein. The statute of limitations has expired for the criminal aspect but this would involve civil penalties. It is now set for December 16th in New York City. {UPDATE: DUE TO DEATH THREATS BY TRUMP SUPPORTERS, THE PLAINTIFF WAS FORCED TO DROP HER LAWSUIT}6. Senator Barbara Boxer has asked the Department of Homeland Security to investigate his modeling agency for illegal importing women. 7. Not yet filed but within the Statute of Limitations is that minor matter of bribing the Attorneys General of FL & TX not to prosecute Trump University & the fact that Trump paid the bribes from his 'Foundation'.

2 | Daniel De Paoli | 152 | 10154989613668812_10154989616323812 | It basically means he's a tax evader & a fraud. If you are being audited by the I.R.S for a very long period of time, you should start to realize something ain't right.
3 | Michael Rich | 64 | 10154989613668812_10154989628683812 | Tax returns should be released for career politicians, not career businessmen. We want to see how those politicians have enriched themselves, illegally in most circumstances. Just look at Hillary. Now there's a prime example.
4 | Gary Doan | 89 | 10154989613668812_10154989616268812 | We now live in a country where a Trump sticker, can get your car burned. A Trump hat, can get you physically attacked. Campaign headquarters are being firebombed. Innocent men and women are being attacked by goons, paid to incite violence. The dishonest media is guilty. Journalistic integrity is nonexistent and propaganda is the norm. You can‚Äôt have government corruption, without media corruption. We have both.
5 | Mike Wagner | 85 | 10154989613668812_10154989617563812 | Donald Trump has no connection to reality. He's hiding something big in those taxes. he is unfit and unqualified to be president.
6 | Daniel Marino | 35 | 10154989613668812_10154989624278812 | i am just amazed at how this country thinks....hillary has gotten away with murdering america and people would still vote for her.....she has gone broken certain constitutional laws and the people vote for her....she has forsaken the live of our soldiers and 4 were killed because of her and the people vote for her.......the world hates this woman they hate america because the people are curropt and putting her in charge might tilt the scale against us.....and the people vote for her.....i hope u people who love her will follow her into the darkness she will take this country into......i know many of u and i will not reach my hand out to pull u from the darkness......u are on your own
7 | Brian Eubanks | 34 | 10154989613668812_10154989617978812 | When this election is over will you be proud of how you acted? Will you be able to say you showed dignity and were honest or did you hurl insults and spread lies? I don't mean will you be satisfied with the results and think that the ends justified the means but will you truly believe that you showed respect, dignity and honesty.
8 | Marti Chandler | 14 | 10154989613668812_10154989634223812 | We live in a country where people vote with their lady parts and not their lady smarts, where a career criminal and professional panderer is on the ticket....and she's PISSED that Trump took advantage of Bill Clinton's tax code changes relative to loss and write offs :D rich
9 | Cindy Luke Stewart | 32 | 10154989613668812_10154989620363812 | Yea- no surprise..a man that says he loves the US...but never supported it...
10 | Rose Marie | 9 | 10154989613668812_10154989645413812 | I don't need to see them. I do need to see crooker lying Hillary and her rapist husband out of the White House tho! VOTE TRUMP! Save our Constitution, religious rights etc. Win back the government against corruptness!
11 | Steven Smith | 22 | 10154989613668812_10154989623943812 | I'm sure we'll get a new law which requires Presidential Candidates to release their tax returns in order to avoid another repeat of Donald Trump.
12 | Pam Hamman Luckeroth | 7 | 10154989613668812_10154989643973812 | Greatest mystery is why Hillary is allowed to be above the law and run for president!!! But then again I guess it's not really look at the administration in charge üò°
13 | Diana Falcone | 9 | 10154989613668812_10154989637388812 | What's an election mystery is why our President is using our tax dollars to campaign for a presidential candidate! Since when do we have to foot the bill for that
14 | Matthew Kashou | 11 | 10154989613668812_10154989637938812 | We never got to see Hilary's illegal emails! If any of us did what she did we would be in jail! Which I think are a bigger problem then his damn taxes!
15 | Donald Scruggs | 14 | 10154989613668812_10154989618948812 | This guy doesn't have to because he knows he is a liar and a Crook dude probably hasn't paid taxes in years
16 | Beverly Hagins | 4 | 10154989613668812_10154989644003812 | He had not planned to release his tax info but if that was Obama in 2007; he would not be POTUS today; for some reason people are scared of trumpty dumpty; but don't worry he will be in jail in 2017 anyway!!!!!!
17 | Judy Garza | 3 | 10154989613668812_10154989645983812 | And she did not own up to her 30,000 lost  emails which is mu√ßh worst for our country....forget those tax returns  and find those emails ok...Vote Trump
18 | Randi Taylor | 2 | 10154989613668812_10154989656253812 | I'm listening to this fool now, he's in Scranton, Pa at his rally and he.is literally lying his a$$ off!!!!! These clowns in the audience yelling "lock her up"..."CNN sucks"...they are actually believing this crap!! These people and Chump are absolutely deplorable!!!!
19 | Sheri Fowler | 1 | 10154989613668812_10154989663948812 | And the other mystery is just what was in those bleached out emails that the Democratic Party doesn't seem to concerned about. The ones we've seen are every bit as bad as a missing tax return. I do appreciate all the payroll taxes his companies have paid, even though not that big of a personal fan.
20 | Bryan Norris | 6 | 10154989613668812_10154989654213812 | After tomorrow he's gonna wish he showed my beautiful African Americans & my beautiful Latinos some real love. We don't play around, we stick together against bullying iddiots.  #WeStandWithHer ‚ù§
21 | Spicoli John | 0 | 10154989613668812_10154989661413812 | Under Barack Hussein Obama the Democrats have started five wars with five different countries and killed millions now they want to tackle on Russia just because they are one of the last countries do not let Roth child banking industry into their system this is beyond hypocrisy
22 | Dee Keihn | 0 | 10154989613668812_10154989676388812 | The 25 things that are truly important  Hillary instead of this left wing fluff:1. When did she know her husband was a serial abuser, and does she feel guilty for destroying his accusers?2. Explain precisely the trades made in the Cattle Futures scandal where $1,000 was turned into $99,000 in a matter of weeks?3. Why didn't she do anything to protect the Americans in Benghazi?4. Who is Saul Alinsky and why was he her mentor?5. When she was working on Watergate, why did her boss Zeifman, a lifelong Democrat, call Hillary a ‚Äúliar‚Äù and ‚Äúan unethical, dishonest lawyer‚Äù and have her fired?6. What really happened with Travelgate?7. What really happened with the Rose Law Firm?8. What really happened with White Water?9. What gave Hillary the right to see private FBI files of her political enemies in FileGate?10. Why won't she turn over her illegal server with state department e-mails to congress?11. Why does your foundation accept money from avowed terror states?12. What is her take on the Vince Foster "Suicide"?13. Why did she think she was entitled to steal the White House furniture when she left?14. Why do you lie even about things that mean nothing: lying about being under sniper fire in Bosnia, lying about being named after Sir Edmund Hillary, or lying that your grandparents were immigrants.15. Should America be concerned that in ChinaGate, the 22 people that were convicted of fraud or for funneling Asian funds into the DNC were associates of Bill Clinton?16. Did selling stays at the Lincoln Bedroom to political donors make you feel like a wh)o(re?17. Does Hillary think Juanita Broadrick lied when she said on national news that Bill Clinton raped her?18. Is she still okay that Bill goes to pedophile island with Jeff Epstein?19. Why are there so many murdered and suicided people in the Clinton's immediate circle?20. Doesn't the fact that the Clinton Foundation has to amend 5 years of its tax returns for improper reporting imply that you were involved in an illegal RICO enterprise?21. Doesn't approving the Russian-owned Uranium One deal as secretary of state--because of illegal contributions to your foundation--in fact make you a traitor to this country?22. Was it wise to have at least four Clinton Foundation board of directors that have either been convicted or charged of the financial crimes of bribery and fraud?23. Why, Hillary, did you pay your female senate staffers 72% of what you paid your male staffers?24. When you represented an accused pedophile rapist, why did you laugh when you got him off even though you believed him to be guilty?25. She said she had one e-mail address, it came out that she had two; She said she had one device, it came out that she had two: She said none of her e-mails on her private server was classified, but when the State Dept handed over 300 e-mails the FBI redacted large sections of one, proving again she was wrong. Thus, Ms. Clinton, are you incompetent or just a congenital liar?Everyone should go on you tube and watch The Clinton Chronicles -- it will amaze you what a couple of psychopaths the Clintons really are!10 QUESTIONS(1). "When you left the White House after your husband‚Äôs last term as president, why did you steal $200,000.00 worth of furniture, china, and artwork? And why did you tell the public that you ‚Äòreturned it‚Äô when you only brought back $27,000 of it?(2). Mrs. Clinton, when you were Secretary of State, why did you solicit contributions from foreign governments, (muslim princes donated multi-millions and got favors in return) for the Clinton Foundation after you promised President Obama you would not?(3). Mrs. Clinton, why do you and your husband claim to contribute millions of dollars to charity for a tax write off when it goes directly into your Clinton Foundation which only gives out 10% of the funds to charitable purposes and you pocket the balance to support yourself tax free? What does your daughter Chelsea do there for her 3 million dollar yearly salary?(4). Mrs. Clinton, why are you unable to account for 6 billion dollars of State department funds that seem to have disappeared while you were Secretary of State?(5). Mrs. Clinton why did you say you were broke when you left the White House, but purchased a 5 million home, built an addition for the secret service, and charge the tax payers of the United States $15,000.00 a month for their rent, an amount that pays your the entire mortgage?(6). Mrs. Clinton why did you lie to the American people about the terrorist attack in Benghazi, but managed to tell the truth to your daughter that same night it happened?(7). Mrs Clinton were you and your husband disbarred from practicing law? Answer: In 1996, Landmark Legal Foundation filed a complaint asking the court to disbar Hillary Clinton for violating the Arkansas code of conduct, (which requires lawyers to act with honesty and integrity) for her actions in the Whitewater scandal cover up. Hillary‚Äôs law license was suspended in 2002 for failing to complete her continuing legal education requirements. Bill Clinton was convicted by a grand jury for perjury and obstruction of justice to which he was impeached by the House of Representatives and disbarred from practicing as an attorney. He has been accused by a dozens of women for rape, sexual assault and sexual harassment. He settled out of court for $850.000 in one case. Hillary has him out on her campaign trail championing for her theme of feminism and "women's rights". What a blasphemy. Neither one has enough integrity to hold onto a law license.(8). Mrs Clinton, why did you say, ‚ÄúI do not recall,‚Äù ‚ÄúI have no recollection,‚Äù and ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù 56 times while testifying under oath during the Starr investigations.‚Ä¢(9). Mrs Clinton, what Really happened to Ron Brown when he was about to testify against you and your husband?(10). Mrs. Clinton what really happened to law partner Vince Foster? No way he committed suicide.CNBC, NBC, ABC, CBS, CNN, New York Times, Los Angeles Times, I know that the answers to any of these questions don‚Äôt matter to you, you would support her regardless of whether she was guilty of murder, embezzlement, money laundering, and I could go on and on. The Democrat‚Äôs and liberal‚Äôs motto is, ‚ÄúDON‚ÄôT CONFUSE ME WITH THE FACTS ‚Äì MY MIND IS MADE UP.

I'm all for people coming to America legally but illegally and reaping tons of benefits is seriously just wrong... This is such common sense!! We've recently adopted 2 kids from foster care and their are so many children that need help! That are already living here! Drugs are a serious problem and causing children to be severely neglected! If securing our borders helps less drugs coming in the better off our children are!! Hillary does not seem to want to help Americans first! Seriously think of this when you Vote tomorrow! ü§ó

High turnout among Latino voters -- including a record in Florida -- is being viewed as a positive sign for the Hillary Clinton camp, some experts say.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Jon Fernandez | 253 | 10154989528643812_10154989534268812 | Republicans messed up by nominating such a racist xenophobe. They have lost this voting block for many cycles, maybe even decades. BIG MISTAKE.
2 | Dennis Engel | 136 | 10154989528643812_10154989535353812 | Experts said Jimmy Carter was on his way to a massive victory over Ronald Reagan.Experts said Great Britain would vote down Brexit overwhelmingly.The Chicago Cubs were down 3 games to 1 in the World Series with Cleveland and experts said they had no chance to win the series.
3 | Simmy Taub | 136 | 10154989528643812_10154989533068812 | Trump wanted us to believe that Hispanics were destroying our country, but with their larger than expected early voter turnout, they're saving it.
4 | Jeff Bowerman | 76 | 10154989528643812_10154989547673812 | There is no such thing as Hispanic voting. If you are born here, or move here and become a citizen, you are just an American.........so it is all just Americans voting.
5 | Lynda Stewart | 54 | 10154989528643812_10154989544423812 | If they r intelligent, which I believe they are, they will vote Trump. They are smart enough to know open borders mean, someone isn't eating, having a roof over their head...or a job.
6 | Tim Kime | 22 | 10154989528643812_10154989556753812 | No wonder there's a big turn out. Obama in a interview encourage undocumented immigrants to vote and promised no repercussions.
7 | Brandon Hightower | 19 | 10154989528643812_10154989563923812 | Enter the US legal! And I would love an open border with Mexico! I live in Cali.! And love Mexican people! That said come here legal so we know who is here! Google how many N.K. have been caught at the border! Not to mention the middle easterners who want to kill us sneaking over the S.border! Mexicans 99% of them only want to fin d work! And they are the hardest working people I have ever seen or had the pleasure to work next to! Black and Hispanic neighborhoods have been all but abandoned by the corrupt politicians as usual! Trump is not racist! Being racist is bad for business and he succeeds in business like few others! He cares about the inner cities and everyday Americans 10X more the Hitlary ever will! Give Trump a chance! Like he said what do you have to loose!?
8 | Machelle Haskins | 12 | 10154989528643812_10154989585128812 | He doesn't have the black vote. He doesn't have the Hispanic vote. He doesn't have the millennial vote. He doesn't have the women's vote. Sure, he has a few here and there but the majority are just angry older white males who won't stop repeating the same things on every post. Tomorrow evening cannot come sooner. It's almost over!!!
9 | Leo Decaj | 40 | 10154989528643812_10154989534148812 | When you go to the polls on November 8th, remember this: Donald Trump is willing to spend millions of his own dollars on a movement to make America great again, while Hillary Clinton has spent the last 30 years selling out the American people for millions of dollars from foreign governments and special interests
10 | Brian Eubanks | 15 | 10154989528643812_10154989540033812 | When this election is over will you be proud of how you acted? Will you be able to say you showed dignity and were honest or did you hurl insults and spread lies? I don't mean will you be satisfied with the results and think that the ends justified the means but will you truly believe that you showed respect, dignity and honesty.

So protect your own children from the Illegals that we have no knowledge of,think of your children!
17 | Dee Keihn | 1 | 10154989528643812_10154989607688812 | The 25 things that are truly important  Hillary instead of this left wing fluff:1. When did she know her husband was a serial abuser, and does she feel guilty for destroying his accusers?2. Explain precisely the trades made in the Cattle Futures scandal where $1,000 was turned into $99,000 in a matter of weeks?3. Why didn't she do anything to protect the Americans in Benghazi?4. Who is Saul Alinsky and why was he her mentor?5. When she was working on Watergate, why did her boss Zeifman, a lifelong Democrat, call Hillary a ‚Äúliar‚Äù and ‚Äúan unethical, dishonest lawyer‚Äù and have her fired?6. What really happened with Travelgate?7. What really happened with the Rose Law Firm?8. What really happened with White Water?9. What gave Hillary the right to see private FBI files of her political enemies in FileGate?10. Why won't she turn over her illegal server with state department e-mails to congress?11. Why does your foundation accept money from avowed terror states?12. What is her take on the Vince Foster "Suicide"?13. Why did she think she was entitled to steal the White House furniture when she left?14. Why do you lie even about things that mean nothing: lying about being under sniper fire in Bosnia, lying about being named after Sir Edmund Hillary, or lying that your grandparents were immigrants.15. Should America be concerned that in ChinaGate, the 22 people that were convicted of fraud or for funneling Asian funds into the DNC were associates of Bill Clinton?16. Did selling stays at the Lincoln Bedroom to political donors make you feel like a wh)o(re?17. Does Hillary think Juanita Broadrick lied when she said on national news that Bill Clinton raped her?18. Is she still okay that Bill goes to pedophile island with Jeff Epstein?19. Why are there so many murdered and suicided people in the Clinton's immediate circle?20. Doesn't the fact that the Clinton Foundation has to amend 5 years of its tax returns for improper reporting imply that you were involved in an illegal RICO enterprise?21. Doesn't approving the Russian-owned Uranium One deal as secretary of state--because of illegal contributions to your foundation--in fact make you a traitor to this country?22. Was it wise to have at least four Clinton Foundation board of directors that have either been convicted or charged of the financial crimes of bribery and fraud?23. Why, Hillary, did you pay your female senate staffers 72% of what you paid your male staffers?24. When you represented an accused pedophile rapist, why did you laugh when you got him off even though you believed him to be guilty?25. She said she had one e-mail address, it came out that she had two; She said she had one device, it came out that she had two: She said none of her e-mails on her private server was classified, but when the State Dept handed over 300 e-mails the FBI redacted large sections of one, proving again she was wrong. Thus, Ms. Clinton, are you incompetent or just a congenital liar?Everyone should go on you tube and watch The Clinton Chronicles -- it will amaze you what a couple of psychopaths the Clintons really are!10 QUESTIONS(1). "When you left the White House after your husband‚Äôs last term as president, why did you steal $200,000.00 worth of furniture, china, and artwork? And why did you tell the public that you ‚Äòreturned it‚Äô when you only brought back $27,000 of it?(2). Mrs. Clinton, when you were Secretary of State, why did you solicit contributions from foreign governments, (muslim princes donated multi-millions and got favors in return) for the Clinton Foundation after you promised President Obama you would not?(3). Mrs. Clinton, why do you and your husband claim to contribute millions of dollars to charity for a tax write off when it goes directly into your Clinton Foundation which only gives out 10% of the funds to charitable purposes and you pocket the balance to support yourself tax free? What does your daughter Chelsea do there for her 3 million dollar yearly salary?(4). Mrs. Clinton, why are you unable to account for 6 billion dollars of State department funds that seem to have disappeared while you were Secretary of State?(5). Mrs. Clinton why did you say you were broke when you left the White House, but purchased a 5 million home, built an addition for the secret service, and charge the tax payers of the United States $15,000.00 a month for their rent, an amount that pays your the entire mortgage?(6). Mrs. Clinton why did you lie to the American people about the terrorist attack in Benghazi, but managed to tell the truth to your daughter that same night it happened?(7). Mrs Clinton were you and your husband disbarred from practicing law? Answer: In 1996, Landmark Legal Foundation filed a complaint asking the court to disbar Hillary Clinton for violating the Arkansas code of conduct, (which requires lawyers to act with honesty and integrity) for her actions in the Whitewater scandal cover up. Hillary‚Äôs law license was suspended in 2002 for failing to complete her continuing legal education requirements. Bill Clinton was convicted by a grand jury for perjury and obstruction of justice to which he was impeached by the House of Representatives and disbarred from practicing as an attorney. He has been accused by a dozens of women for rape, sexual assault and sexual harassment. He settled out of court for $850.000 in one case. Hillary has him out on her campaign trail championing for her theme of feminism and "women's rights". What a blasphemy. Neither one has enough integrity to hold onto a law license.(8). Mrs Clinton, why did you say, ‚ÄúI do not recall,‚Äù ‚ÄúI have no recollection,‚Äù and ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù 56 times while testifying under oath during the Starr investigations.‚Ä¢(9). Mrs Clinton, what Really happened to Ron Brown when he was about to testify against you and your husband?(10). Mrs. Clinton what really happened to law partner Vince Foster? No way he committed suicide.CNBC, NBC, ABC, CBS, CNN, New York Times, Los Angeles Times, I know that the answers to any of these questions don‚Äôt matter to you, you would support her regardless of whether she was guilty of murder, embezzlement, money laundering, and I could go on and on. The Democrat‚Äôs and liberal‚Äôs motto is, ‚ÄúDON‚ÄôT CONFUSE ME WITH THE FACTS ‚Äì MY MIND IS MADE UP.

I'm all for people coming to America legally but illegally and reaping tons of benefits is seriously just wrong... This is such common sense!! We've recently adopted 2 kids from foster care and their are so many children that need help! That are already living here! Drugs are a serious problem and causing children to be severely neglected! If securing our borders helps less drugs coming in the better off our children are!! Hillary does not seem to want to help Americans first! Seriously think of this when you Vote tomorrow! ü§ó

5 | Cherylyn McCollam-Kerley | 1 | 10154989478378812_10154989598218812 | Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton were walking down the street when they came to a homeless person. Trump gave the homeless person his business card and told him to come to his office for a job. He then took $20 out of his pocket and gave it to the homeless person. Hillary was very impressed, so when they came to another homeless person, she decided to help. She walked over to the homeless person and gave him directions to the welfare office. She then reached into Trump‚Äôs pocket and got out $20. She kept $15 for her administrative fees and gave the homeless person $5.00. Now, do you understand the difference between a Conservative and a Liberal progressive?
6 | Holly Hall | 2 | 10154989478378812_10154989544123812 | Even if you aren't fond of Trump remember the Supreme Court!!! The next president will shape the SC for the next 30-40 years!!!
7 | Clarence Holmes | 0 | 10154989478378812_10154989521958812 | Given Trump‚Äôs stoking of racial animus and GOP state legislatures‚Äô gerrymandering and blatant attempts at suppressing minority voting, we cannot say it is unnecessary in 2016 to protect voting rights in America. Media and Congressional Democrats must encourage public debate of the changes SCOTUS made to the Voting Rights Act in 2013. Suppressing people‚Äôs right to vote is a perversion of American democracy.

12 | Shel Marie | 0 | 10154989478378812_10154989654378812 | #StopFukishima #CleantheOcean #JillStein for PresidentThe ocean's acidification levels are rising exponentially. The WWF just released their report for 2016 that scientists predict if we continue on the path of developing fossil fuels - sea life and wildlife will decline rapidly by the year 2020. Coastal communities will no longer be able to sustain themselves or depend on sea life for food. The Kuskokwim river in Alaska was suspended from commercial fishing this summer because no one is buying fish. Reports of sea life having boils and other deformities are affecting those who depend on it for subsistence. Schools need to recruit students and focus their efforts on stopping Fukishima from spilling more radiation in the ocean. It's evident Japan will not or cannot contain it alone. As long as radiation levels increase in the oceans, it will be pulled up in the clouds - rain on our mountains that lead to our rivers and streams; rain on our livestock and crops making food from the inland unsuitable to eat; and it will devastate the global landscape by killing trees we need for oxygen.Mankind cannot ignore the effects of Fukishima any longer. This will become of major national interest before most people know or are prepared.

21 | Tariq Marwan Al Mutawa | 4 | 10154989478378812_10154989486518812 | The endless Clinton family crime is going on and on and will go on. This criminal Clinton system is now legalised by and from a entire US rigged government system and all those Clinton crimes over a century are fully backed by Barack Obama! This is the most dirtiest campaign ever in the US history which the criminal Clinton clan is organising and arranging against the system and especially against Donald J. Trump and against the entire normal US citizen and the normal US society. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama this stands for corruption, fraud, supporting Wall Street in all criminal behaviours of national and international transactions, ISIS terrorist financing, TIPP, open borders, migrants, islamisation, NWO on behalf of the 5 most powerful families that control America and the world Rothschild, Rockefeller, Du Pont, Morgan and Bush and similar influential families and Hillary Clinton will initiate the WWIII.I hope even the stupidest, the normal and the clever Americans have recognised already how criminal is the Clinton family and there entire elite supporters are as well. Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton should be in jail for live-time for all her political and all her international war crimes and should not sit in the oval office in the white house to initiate more and more national and international crimes and to initiate a WW III.Be sure if Hillary Clinton will be President of the United States of America one morning the Americans will wake up and will listen to the news the ‚ÄúThird World War‚Äù has started already and this will happen in the very very near future.Sorry to say this, but it seems that many of those typical American do not understand what is going on or they are totally stupid and totally unrealistic ‚ÄúPerson‚Äù who know absolutely nothing what is going on the globe initiated by the US and how dirty are those US games of the US elite and the US establishment is, at home in the US and abroad to act criminal and to destroy countries where ever they like to do it. This has to be stopped for ever this criminal behaviour of the US politicians worldwide.Bring all those US high criminals the former US presidents and the US politicians include Barak Obama to justice right now in Dan Haag, before it is too late and I believe and I feel the WW III initiated by the US government started already.

There is always some miserable hateful demon staring at me with disdain, trying to provoke me into a fight or an argument.  A few months ago a drunk, crazed woman threatened to throw me on the tracks and hold me down on the third rail @59th Steet. I was just standing there on my way to work, minding my business.  She tried to strike up a conversation at first... and then started making sideways threats when I ignored her.
5 | Tim Ng | 30 | 10154989415103812_10154989473448812 | Don't stand to close to the rail when waiting for a train. You never know what kind of person, in what emotional state, is going to stand behind you.

The emails were deleted from the server with care.....in fear that the FBI soon would be there. Hillary and Bill are asleep and all snug in their beds....Dreaming of the time that Hillary was still ahead.  Hillary wants a win but instead gets a coal lump......because tomorrow the Americans elect President Trump. And so she's defeated and still dreams of what could have been.....for the following day We The People MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!
5 | Elle Loy | 7 | 10154989330163812_10154989391178812 | Why would we trust the FBI? Hillary Clinton clearly Violated Federal Law yet they are allowing her to get away with it. When others have been jailed for the same thing or less.
6 | Gary Vandiver | 4 | 10154989330163812_10154989363893812 | Would it be so hard to just count them by the votes twice? I remember when you didn't need much more than your fingers to do that lol

8 | Shel Marie | 0 | 10154989330163812_10154989606303812 | #StopFukishima #CleantheOcean #JillStein for PresidentThe ocean's acidification levels are rising exponentially. The WWF just released their report for 2016 that scientists predict if we continue on the path of developing fossil fuels - sea life and wildlife will decline rapidly by the year 2020. Coastal communities will no longer be able to sustain themselves or depend on sea life for food. The Kuskokwim river in Alaska was suspended from commercial fishing this summer because no one is buying fish. Reports of sea life having boils and other deformities are affecting those who depend on it for subsistence. Schools need to recruit students and focus their efforts on stopping Fukishima from spilling more radiation in the ocean. It's evident Japan will not or cannot contain it alone. As long as radiation levels increase in the oceans, it will be pulled up in the clouds - rain on our mountains that lead to our rivers and streams; rain on our livestock and crops making food from the inland unsuitable to eat; and it will devastate the global landscape by killing trees we need for oxygen.Mankind cannot ignore the effects of Fukishima any longer. This will become of major national interest before most people know or are prepared.

How will you answer them when they ask, Daddy, if America is so bad, why do we have a 2 millon dollar home, more money then we can spend. a $70,000 car, not to mention 500 pairs of shoes, really Daddy, where else but America?
10 | Daron Petit | 2 | 10154989330163812_10154989404988812 | I understand that it can be difficult to fully comprehend the system and the people who control the system that control this world. However, one need not look very hard to see what is right in front of their eyes. A vote for Hillary Clinton is in FACT a vote to further enrich and empower the very ruling class we all despise. Don't let yourselves  fall prey EVER again! Do yourself, your friends, your neighbors, and your country a favor, NEVER vote for another political insider! FBI Director, and Obama appointee,  James Comey works for Attorney General, and Obama appointee, Loretta Lynch. Both Comey and Lynch were charged with the duty of holding the Secretary of State, another Obama appointee and endorsed candidate, accountable to the law. They've easily and effectively rigged the system because the system is designed to be rigged. Loretta Lynch is intimately tied to global financial elites, she was on the board of the Federal reserve bank of New York, and she was heavily involved in the US $1 billion settlement with HSBC, the world's 4th largest bank and Clinton Foundation client.  James Comey was a board member of Lockheed Martin, a massive military contractor, beneficiary of foreign policy, and Hillary donor. He was also on the board of HSBC, yes, the HSBC Lynch was involved with. See the circle here? Another client of HSBC, Canadian mining magnate Frank Giustra, is a major player in the Russian uranium deal Hillary approved. James' brother Peter is on the board of a company that is Hillary's 6th largest donor, and a financial advisor to the Clinton Foundation. This is how they game the system and live above the law. We can change the game.
11 | Trey O'Rourke | 0 | 10154989330163812_10154989477678812 | Wait, we cannot forget one fact. Hillary was careless with confidential messages that were sent on her private stash of goodies. So, if there was a cyber attack, who should be blamed?
12 | Dawn Larson | 0 | 10154989330163812_10154989439543812 | If a political party / candidate can hack an election, so could an outside entity. They can't admit it's possible, without admitting they know how to do it. Wouldn't it be interesting if one group of hackers was able to level the playing field with the other? At least we'd have a relatively honest election.
13 | Angela Jones Estell | 5 | 10154989330163812_10154989357293812 | Sorry you hold no credibility...you have no one to blame but yourself
14 | Mary Ryles | 6 | 10154989330163812_10154989338113812 | I believe it would be hard for an outside source to do that but what about from the inside?

The owner didn‚Äôt even see anything, and I don‚Äôt even need to lie. I will definitely win the election.‚ÄùHillary says to Donald: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the typical dishonesty you have displayed throughout your entire life, trickery and deceit. I am going to show you an honest way to get the same 3 pastries without stealing or lying, and also prove that I am much clever than you!‚ÄùHillary goes to the owner of the bakery and says: ‚ÄúGive me a pastry and I will show you a magic trick?‚ÄùIntrigued, the owner accepts Hillary‚Äôs offer and gives her a pastry. Hillary swallows it and asks for another one. The owner gives her another one. Then Hillary asks for a third pastry and eats that, too.By this time, the owner is starting to wonder where the magic trick is and asks: ‚ÄúWhat did you do with the pastries?‚ÄùHillary replies: ‚ÄúLook in Donald‚Äôs pocket!‚Äù

11 | Michele Boyens | 21 | 10154989078983812_893295517472194 | If HILLARY is innocent, then why does everyone around her have to to plead the 5th?? Just say it didn't happen, or maybe they can't because they don't want to lie.
12 | Carlene McIntosh | 21 | 10154989078983812_1790070497933851 | I've heard several statements about voting for Hillary because she is a woman. "Go women"..."First women president"....ect... If your voting for her just because she's a woman, your part of the problem. My opinion.

When Donald J. Trump supporter Scottie Nell Hughes critiqued JAY Z, alleging that one of his videos started off ‚Äúwith a crowd throwing mazel tov cocktails,‚Äù she actually meant 'Molotov cocktails', a combustible mixture of rags, gasoline and glass bottle common in street protests.

1 | Jacquie Adelmann | 216 | 10154989139443812_10154989151208812 | I pray he just returns to the TRUMP Tower in 36 hours an disappears for several years. I am so sick and tired of his lies and his hair. ;-)
2 | George Thomas | 202 | 10154989139443812_10154989143623812 | He also criticized Clinton for Jay Z's lewd language in his music and just a few days later Ted Neugent was on stage at one of his rallies grabbing his crotch...
3 | Jessica Ibarra | 75 | 10154989139443812_10154989147103812 | Trump supporters are a piece of work they Belive everything his says they'll see him or saying something on video and instead of accepting the reality of his actions they make up excuses for him like blaming the media its always everybody's else's fault but his
4 | Ernso T√®rogene | 71 | 10154989139443812_10154989140758812 | I love coming here to read the comments. Some people (like myself at times) are obsessed with reading comments. For example, we find you reading this comment right now, which does not contain any useful information, only curiosity, that drives you to waste your time. Have a good day.
5 | Joann Williber | 29 | 10154989139443812_10154989164488812 | Drain the Swamp in Washington D.C.! Obama Care isn't affordable and our jobs are leaving the United States-Someone need to try to fix this mess-Trump-Pence 2016!

7 | Chris Ohneck | 3 | 10154989139443812_10154989409888812 | And yet Hillary still wants:Open bordersAbortions up to day of birthGlobal economy equaling exported jobsHigher taxesYep...the misspelling of molotov is really important!
8 | Dianne Zigmond | 3 | 10154989139443812_10154989554003812 | I think I will invent my very own MAZEL TOV cocktail when this election is finally over. Most of these people are idiots, who will (and do ) say anything. Mazel Tov to the end of this election cycle.
9 | Andy Perkins | 3 | 10154989139443812_10154989359208812 | Just because Hillary is a career politician don't mean she is better for the job it just means she's better at lying ! We will all lose in this election no matter which one wins ! No matter who you vote for change is coming in a really bad way!
10 | Sally Woodley | 5 | 10154989139443812_10154989253988812 | Does it really matter how it was pronounced? Anyone with half a working brain cell knows full well what was meant.As if ahyone rapping is pronouncing words correctly, much less using real words at all. *rolls my eyes*
11 | Tan Tran | 2 | 10154989139443812_10154989536888812 | COPY AND SHARE 2 STOP #TRUMP:Can Trump be trusted? Ask his three wives.Does Trump have old fashioned Christian values? Ask his five children from multiple mothers, with one born out of wedlock.Can Trump bring jobs back to America? Ask the makers of the 628 outsourced products, primarily to China, offered by Ivanka Trump's company. Can Trump really unify both parties?Just ask the 163 Republican officials who oppose him publicly.Does Trump have the temperament needed for the job? Ask the 50 Republican officials who call him a "National Security Risk".Is Trump really " With You "?No. Time and time again he has shown he is first and foremost a business man. How long before he leaves our country bankrupt like he did his university, his casinos, his failed Broadway shows, his airlines, his mortgage and financial services, his liquor line, his steak food line, or his many, many properties??
12 | Gloriann Hardman | 7 | 10154989139443812_10154989463988812 | It has been highly publicized that most of his supporters are not very bright. I guess this is simply yet another example. It will all be over soon. Thankfully! Much peace and love.
13 | Yvonne Clerebout | 15 | 10154989139443812_10154989145968812 | I get a chuckle out of the libtards thinking that the Hildebeast will win because the FBI closed one of the two cases they have her on. Trump voters outnumber the brain dead by millions. We've got this! #spiritcooking #lolitaexpress #wikileaks #projectveritas #vincefoster #draintheswamp
14 | Brian Eubanks | 1 | 10154989139443812_10154989315328812 | When this election is over will you be proud of how you acted? Will you be able to say you showed dignity and were honest or did you hurl insults and spread lies? I don't mean will you be satisfied with the results and think that the ends justified the means but will you truly believe that you showed respect, dignity and honesty.
15 | Elizabeth Kathryne Ross | 1 | 10154989139443812_10154989285398812 | Hey a lot of Clinton supporters are not good spellers. Sick of you thinking all Trump supporters are dumb..lots of smart people supporting him..Clinton couldn't win at all without the enormous minority uneducated vote. So quit making fun.
16 | Jim Gill | 0 | 10154989139443812_10154989552638812 | Everyone knows that mazeltov cocktails are only used during jewish rights of passage. Ignorance must be assuredly bliss. GROAN!

18 | Shawn Rowlett | 0 | 10154989139443812_10154989586728812 | why would abc try to embarrass this guy like this, listing his name in the post, like your perfect, it was just a couple weeks ago you posted about the Cubs and Steve Bartman telling us about the famous "Fowl" ball.  Last i checked its a Foul ball.
19 | Mirtha Breslin | 1 | 10154989139443812_10154989495008812 | They're afraid because there's a chance of Trump winning so they are bringing every thing  they have to make sure people vote for her. I hope Obama goes back to work tomorrow. Never before a president or vice. President, or a first wife have taking so much time off to campaign with a nominee.
20 | Mary Ryles | 0 | 10154989139443812_10154989356818812 | The saddest thing in this election is the media. Really is this hard news or a gossip rag? I would be embarrassed to call myself a journalist reporting this.
21 | Elizabeth Smith | 0 | 10154989139443812_10154989526973812 | Joann Williber. You do know trump was one of those that sent his company's overseas.. He's a hypocrite. China, Mexico make his merchandise.. He's not for America. He's for himself. He would sell the US to Russia for the right amount of money.
22 | Connie Yznaga Davis | 2 | 10154989139443812_10154989184788812 | Lol. Of course, the left is more familiar with molotov cocktails!! They use them in their protests that usually turn into riots, burning and looting. It cracks me up to see such an unimportant issue the day before and important election. I guess the compliant media will do or say anything to take the focus away from the harsh screeching from their candidate.
23 | Teresa White Holt | 0 | 10154989139443812_10154989463768812 | So what? Our current president has made multiple boo boos, especially when it comes to using "a" and "an". I didn't hear anyone criticizing that.

2 | Renee Prue Schafer | 80 | 10154989096738812_10154989116943812 | So the media chooses a picture of Hillary snapping a cell phone picture to make her look relatable. A picture of her daughter and POTUS sharing a great moment. Then a picture of Trump holding up a rubber mask. Bias?? Nahhh

All transgenders, all Gay individuals, and all religious folds, even some Muslim's. You better think twice at that voting booth or this will be your future but on a much larger scale with Hillary Clinton. Terrorists don's assimilate, they Jihad, because you are an infidel to them.

How about making our Justice System great again by ensuring our laws apply to everyone, including the Clintons. This would be a great beginning. #GoTrump #LockHerUp #NeverHillary

13 | Jack Morris | 5 | 10154989096738812_10154989127188812 | Ten reasons to vote Democrat #10. I vote Democrat because I love the fact that I can now marry whatever I want. I've decided to marry my German Shepherd.#9. I vote Democrat because I believe oil companies' profits of 4% on a gallon of gas are obscene, but the government taxing the same gallon at 15% isn't.#8. I vote Democrat because I believe the government will do a better job of spending the money I earn than I would.#7. I vote Democrat because Freedom of Speech is fine as long as nobody is offended by it.#6. I vote Democrat because I'm way too irresponsible to own a gun, and I know that my local police are all I need to protect me from murderers and thieves. I am also thankful that we have a 911 service that gets police to your home in order to identify your body after a home invasion. It will take the police an average of about 15 minutes to get to your house; 00 buckshot travels at about 1200 ft/sec.#5. I vote Democrat because I'm not concerned about millions of babies being aborted so long as we keep all death row inmates alive and comfy.#4. I vote Democrat because I think illegal aliens have a right to free health care, education, and Social Security benefits, and we should take away Social Security from those who paid into it.#3. I vote Democrat because I believe that businesses should not be allowed to make profits for themselves. They need to break even and give the rest away to the government for redistribution as the Democrat Party sees fit.#2. I vote Democrat because I believe liberal judges need to rewrite the Constitution every few days to suit fringe kooks who would never get their agendas past the voters.And, the #1 reason I vote Democrat is because I think it's better to pay $billions$ for oil to people who hate us, but not drill our own because it might upset some endangered beetle, gopher, or fish here in America.

My 8 year old just got home confused because an older child told her not to sit next to her on the bus because she was Of Color. Regardless of who you chose to vote for, show your children how to respect and remember that they are always listening. For children in school to go around and tell other children that Trump is gonna deport them is wrong. Children arent born hating the color of others skin. They learn it.

15 | Rebecca Laskey | 0 | 10154989039573812_10154989051153812 | DONALD TRUMP ANNOUNCEMENT ~ REGARDING THE NEWSWEEK REPORT:TRUMP IS A ‚ÄúHUGE‚Äù NATIONAL SECURITY RISK BECAUSE OF HIS BUSINESS, FINANCIAL AND PERSONAL TIES TO RUSSIA, CHINA, SAUDI ARABIA, IRAN, ETC‚Ä¶..In a stunning and damning expose just released, the truth behind the ties between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin are revealed, and American allies in Europe are growing increasingly concerned by Russian espionage and its interference in the U.S. election.A Friday Newsweek article by Kurt Eichenwald reveals the truth behind the Trump campaign and its ties to Russia‚Äôs President Vladimir Putin. It also shows the history behind Russia‚Äôs support of the Republican candidate through espionage and cyberattacks discovered by both U.S. and allied European intelligence agencies.According to Eichenwald, American allies are concerned about Russian interference in the U.S. election and that Donald Trump‚Äôs statements denying any collusion in recent cyberattacks have only encouraged Putin to become more aggressive in his espionage against Western countries. Eichenwald cites the input of government officials, law enforcement officers, and intelligence agencies in both the U.S. and Europe.According to information gained by Western allied intelligence sources, the Kremlin‚Äôs interference into the U.S. election is aimed more at crippling Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in revenge for what Putin felt was interference in Russian elections. Clinton‚Äôs statement in 2011, saying the Russian election was ‚Äúneither free nor fair‚Äú in regards to obvious cheating, has sent Putin into a rage and made him determined to destroy Clinton. Putin was also enticed by Trump‚Äôs compliments of his strength as a leader.Some of the information gained by Western intelligence sources reveal that Donald Trump has been surrounded by a number of advisers with ties to Putin or with financial and family ties to Russia. Former campaign manager Paul Manafort was forced to resign when it was revealed that he had ties to a pro-Russian Ukraine official. Carter Page, another former Trump adviser, is being investigated by U.S. and European intelligence agencies for engaging in back-channel discussions with Russian officials. Intelligence has also revealed that Trump adviser Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn is intimately tied to RT, a Russian news agency involved in distributing Russian propaganda.Donald Trump and his campaign have also been found to be spreading Russian propaganda. The Kremlin has been distributing misinformation as part of their normal activities via various networks, through both anonymous internet trolls, RT, and Sputnik, another propaganda news source. A manipulated document from one of the anonymous internet sources found itself being recited by Trump at a campaign rally. The campaign has also been spreading rumors from Sputnik, including a piece attacking Newsweek that was forwarded by Trump staff to a number of reporters in the U.S. with requests that those reporters pursue the false story.In accordance with his position as presidential nominee, U.S. intelligence agencies have briefed Trump about Russia‚Äôs attempts to influence the election, but Trump has persisted in publicly denying these serious allegations, calling them unreliable, and dismissing them as possibly being perpetrated by some ‚Äú400-pound guy sitting on their bed‚Äù or even a child.European officials have told Newsweek that Trump‚Äôs statements have alarmed our NATO partners, because Trump refuses to believe the intelligence briefings he received or simply doesn‚Äôt understand them. They are also convinced that Trump could be misleading the American people for reasons of his own.One British official said that members of the U.K. government who are fully aware of Russia‚Äôs interference find Trump‚Äôs response ‚Äúquite disturbing.‚Äù They‚Äôre concerned that should he be elected, Trump would ignore and dismiss his own and allied intelligence services.Western law enforcement and intelligence agencies say that the Russian hacking and disinformation campaign includes tens of thousands of people in Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Novosibirsk. They say there are also operations inside the United States, working from New York City, Miami, and Washington D.C., mainly using Russian immigrants, although other foreign nationals and American citizens are also involved. According to intelligence received, those involved are being paid via a Russian pension scheme. One U.S. official told Newsweek that evidence shows that many of the Americans and other foreign nationals involved are unaware that they are part of Russia‚Äôs propaganda machine.American intelligence is also aware that Russia used cyber espionage and propaganda to interfere with other elections in the West, including the German elections last month and the June Brexit vote in the U.K., the results of both of which weakened the ties between those countries and the EU and NATO.According to a European intelligence expert, Russia is releasing its disinformation to disrupt the U.S. election through WikiLeaks, but states that the ‚Äúpipeline‚Äù through which the information flows contains numerous steps and so many filters that it is likely that the WikiLeaks organization itself does not know the source of the information.Interestingly enough, despite the Russian president‚Äôs support of Donald Trump, at one point, support for the Republican nominee was halted due to his volatile and unstable nature. According to intelligence sources, the Kremlin backed off supporting Trump when he attacked the Kahn Gold Star family publicly. The Kremlin assumed that the nominee would be forced to withdraw from the race due to his psychological unfitness, so put the hacking campaign on hold. According to reports provided to Western intelligence sources, even Putin thought Trump was unfit to be president, despite the advantages to him of a Trump presidency.According to information provided to Western intelligence agencies, Putin is satisfied that his campaign of cyber espionage has turned the tide in his direction. Putin has told his associates that even if Clinton wins the White House, she will be too busy rectifying the chaos that his leaked misinformation has wrought to interfere with his plans in Syria, Ukraine, and elsewhere.European allies are particularly stunned by Donald Trump‚Äôs refusal to credit his own intelligence services, and British officials were particularly horrified when Trump dismissed the validity of those sources. According to one British official the most disturbing evidence of Trump‚Äôs negligence was during the third presidential debate. In rebuttal to Clinton‚Äôs accusation that he was encouraging Russian cyberattacks, Trump said that she had no idea where the cyberattacks were coming from.‚ÄòHillary, you have no idea‚Ä¶ Our country has no idea.‚ÄôAccording to Newsweek, all of our intelligence sources and those of our NATO allies know that Russia is behind the hacking. Although Trump has been briefed, he continues to dismiss the information. Eichenwald sums up the exposes with some chilling thoughts:‚ÄòShould the United States, the last remaining superpower, tilt its policies away from NATO to the benefit of Russia, the alliance between America and Western Europe could be transformed in unprecedented ways. And so, for perhaps the first time since World War II, countries in Western Europe fear that the American election, should Trump win, could trigger events that imperil their national security and do potentially irreparable harm to the alliances that have kept the continent safe for decades.‚ÄôIF YOU CARE, SHARE!

In the first of his speeches on this last day of campaigning before Election Day, Pres. Barack Obama today framed a Hillary Clinton presidency as the natural continuation of his own, urging voters to be as excited for her election as they were for his own.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Donald Vormelker | 290 | 10154988926478812_10154988938148812 | He tells illegals to vote, that is a violation of the law. I thought he was a constitutional lawyer? He apparently doesn't know the constitution. Worst President in history leaving soon.
2 | Janie Hilburn | 204 | 10154988926478812_10154988940423812 | Nothing Obama has done in 8yrs has benifited the American population. The system is absolutly corrupt. A win for Hillary is a loss for our Grandkids.
3 | Jeanne Clevenger | 62 | 10154988926478812_10154988946228812 | It costs the American taxpayer $206,000 an hour when Obama travels in our plane. He leaves behind a national debt of $19,500,000,000,000. His legacy, Obamacare, is sucking the life blood out of the middle class. One would think he might stay at his job and try to fix something.
4 | Cheryl Havlicek | 66 | 10154988926478812_10154988936018812 | If Hillary Clinton is without guilt, then it's time to demand the FBI reverse charges on General Cartwright, Christian Saucier, and General Petraeus. It's time we DEMAND EQUALITY!
5 | Pamela Schilke | 62 | 10154988926478812_10154988939753812 | He should be paying for air force one out of his pocket since he's only out campaigning and not on official business for all the American citizens. Campaigning for Hillary isn't in his job description.
6 | Kevin Jones | 38 | 10154988926478812_10154988954958812 | His presidency kind of sucked.  Wages are down, wars continue, the middle east has fallen to radicals, and his crowing achievement, Obamacare, is going down in flames as we speak.  He didn't do Hillary any favors saying her presidency would be a continuation of his.
7 | Leo Decaj | 76 | 10154988926478812_10154988927143812 | When you go to the polls on November 8th, remember this: Donald Trump is willing to spend millions of his own dollars on a movement to make America great again, while Hillary Clinton has spent the last 30 years selling out the American people for millions of dollars from foreign governments and special interests
8 | Robert Crouch | 28 | 10154988926478812_10154988971823812 | OBAMA scared to death Hillary loses and his legacy is trashed and he gets pulled into court with her--- he will break every law to keep that from happening!
9 | Shawn Arkebauer | 48 | 10154988926478812_10154988929403812 | Americans and legal immigrants and veterans and border patrol and police and GOD fearing people and working people for Trump. Celebrity millionaires and millionaire Wall Street cronies and deadbeats and foreign donors for Clinton. Think of NAFTA and other trade deals, insurance premiums skyrocketing, and 20 TRILLION in debt and climbing. Sorry, I do not have time to reply back to people that do not see this.
10 | Joe DiCapua | 12 | 10154988926478812_10154988978433812 | Who ever was excited for his election should put on the other side of the wall after Trump builds it, nothing but idiots in this country I swear.#worstpresidentimhistory#getthefuckout#trump2016
11 | Todd K McCollum | 14 | 10154988926478812_10154988950823812 | IF Hillary was really leading like you say she is...... She wouldn't be campaigning in Person anywhere, her surrogates would be. She wouldn't need big name celebrities to draw crowds to her events. She would be able to do that on her own, but she can't & do you know why?? She's losing & losing BIG, nobody want to listen to her speak.
12 | Sharon Miller | 7 | 10154988926478812_10154989013618812 | We weren't excited for your election, obama...you've been very unpatriotic in trying to dismantle our country and culture with your muslim stance...bringing them into our government and our justice system. You've taken away our Christian symbols in the WH and Bibles and prayer in public schools! You've nearly ruined our economy with the massive debt you've built up, as well as the horrible Iranian Deal and gave them over 1.5 Billion of our tax dollars!! How can you claim to be for the people of this wonderful nation??  You are evil and have an agenda that could have destroyed our culture and way of life...thank God we have a choice tomorrow...my vote is for life, for liberty and a strong America....I vote Trump/Pence...
13 | Gail Chirichella | 7 | 10154988926478812_10154988944378812 | Obama tells the truth about Crooked Hillary scheming and Beaming. Evidently she was crooked back then in 2008 and she's still crooked now in 2016. Finally Obama sees the truth and he just couldn't keep it to himself.
14 | Kathy Johnson | 1 | 10154988926478812_10154989385438812 | We are currently under an Al Qaeda terror threat...this will be common every day in Hillary's new America with new refugees, along with those that are already here with the help of Obama and Hillary having already allowed to come in...Unless you think they will use missiles you are sadly mistaken. All transgender, all Gay individuals, and all religious folds, even some Muslim's, oh and all western cultures well I guess that means everyone here then huh?! You better think twice at that voting booth or this will be your future but on a much larger scale with Hillary Clinton. Terrorists don's assimilate, they Jihad, because you are an infidel to them, and then there is ISIS and their Lone Wolf terrorists being radicalized through social media e.g., Boston Marathon Bombings, and those that infiltrate through with the masses. Make your choices for the future of your children, and grandchildren in mind-just sayin!.

16 | Julia Kaptchinskie | 3 | 10154988926478812_10154989069853812 | Hillary Clinton can‚Äôt afford to not win the election because she knows that as soon as she loses to Donald Trump she will be sent to jail. Her friends in high places like Obama and James Comey will be gone, along with all of the other corrupt politicians that have been working to kill the great democracy this country once was.Hillary Clinton is a symbol of this corruption and is the embodiment of political corruption. She can‚Äôt be allowed anywhere near the White House because she will turn the mess that Obama has left this country in into something even worse.Hillary Clinton must be stopped and the only way to do that is for Donald Trump to beat her at the polls. We all know she is trying to rig the election and that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs even more important for us to help expose these things.Share this to help spread Hillary‚Äôs evil lies!

21 | Annette Brewer | 0 | 10154988926478812_10154989525753812 | President Obama has more class in his baby finger nail than Trump and his entire crew. As for his accomplishments as POTUS, well the polls say, if he could constitutionally run for a 3rd term, he'd win in a landslide. I guess he's better than many care to acknowledge. Thank God this circus will be over by 10 pm on November 8th and the clowns can load up the car leave town and return to Trumpville. AMEN!!!

24 | Ivaylo Petkov | 0 | 10154988926478812_10154989488203812 | Obama is right - a Hillary victory means four more years of the same. Ironically, this is a better ad for Donald Trump than anything Trump has done himself.

With the election just a day away, here‚Äôs a look back at Hillary Clinton's and Donald J. Trump's biggest social moments on the campaign trail. http://abcn.ws/2eFSYz7
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Jason Kerr | 23 | 10154988876073812_10154988880703812 | Do not be distracted! Democrats want open borders, higher taxes, more "refugees" & illegals, weakened military & police, abolish the 2nd Amendment, Leftist judges, more BLM, and more islamic influence. THAT IS NOT A CHOICE!!!!! Trump/Pence 2016!
2 | Edmund Nonaca | 2 | 10154988876073812_10154989031078812 | I recommend establishing November 9th 2016 as ‚ÄúNational Social Reset Day‚ÄùThis election has created social rifts between people, colleagues, Facebook Friends who have strong views as to who should be the one to lead our country forward. Sure, we all have our opinions, identified the stakes are high, so much is on the line, and we have visions and expectations of what our individual communities will look like after the election. We may not agree with or like who becomes president, yet it is our duty as citizens to respect the office of the President of the United States. We may not now or ever have, or ever will respect the individual, or the decisions, or the actions, but the Office of the President of the United States does deserve our continual respect. Know this is a democracy and in four years will be given a chance to again right the ship if we believe we are on the wrong path.I was once told the secret to a great marriage is to never go to sleep angry with each other. So on November 9th, let‚Äôs reset society back to where it was before all the campaigns began. Yes we can add back the FB friends we deleted during the campaign, we can again feel free to go to lunch with colleagues we crossed off our list, and yes we can allow back that guy who keeps talking about Donald or Hillary while we are on the tee back into our foursome.The key is that as a country, we must reset, and unite under the faith that we can agree to disagree, we can overlook the deficiencies and shortcomings of friends and family, we can again embrace diversity, and yes we can all love one another once again. We cannot allow this ugly campaign to define our character or who we are as individuals, or to redefine what freedom and liberty means to each of us.So if you agree, then let us put aside our grievance, institute forgiving and understanding, rest on faith that whoever is our president will do the right thing (on the most part) and we can go back to being ourselves. I know this may require some mental or emotional therapy for us to get pass this, but it will be a good investment if it is necessary. Yes, the stakes are high, yes we understand, but we have been through worst and we have survived. America is great because we made it this way. We chose to be kind and respectful to each other before the campaign, so we can do it again after.So similar to the World Series, be it rooting for the Indians or the Cubs‚Ä¶ we had our hopes there too, it was close and went to the wire with extra innings, and we have a victor. Can we agree to whoever wins the election we can just as easy say‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúIt was a great game‚Äù and congratulate the winner? We know it is possible to do it again after the election, to reset our social normality, get back to our lives, and love the greatest country ever.National Social Reset Day, November 9th, 2016
3 | Irene Rohn Bain | 1 | 10154988876073812_10154988901998812 | Why are you making this kind of news? Why aren't you talking about the differences in what their plans are? What they want to do when they are elected? All we hear about your is he-said-she-said stuff. Help us out here!
4 | Todd Dorsey | 1 | 10154988876073812_10154988911908812 | For those of you who still haven't voted yet the because you haven't had a chance or because you don't know who to vote for it's pretty simple. Are you happy with the way things have gone the last eight years are you happy with our economy, our  standing in the world , with the unemployment,  the way our vets have been treated, our 20 trillion in debt, high tuition costs, giving Iran billions, giving 50% of our uranium to putin, etc. If you're happy with all those things then the choice is clear then you should vote for Hillary because you cannot blame anything on trump. He as not been in office. Hillary's hands are all over all of the decisions that have been made in the last 8 years.
5 | Brian Eubanks | 0 | 10154988876073812_10154989439083812 | When this election is over will you be proud of how you acted? Will you be able to say you showed dignity and were honest or did you hurl insults and spread lies? I don't mean will you be satisfied with the results and think that the ends justified the means but will you truly believe that you showed respect, dignity and honesty.
6 | Gerry Klepfer | 0 | 10154988876073812_10154988918758812 | It's a shame the democrats can't get the votes they need from African Americans so they gave up on them and shift there alliance to Latinos who half of them are illegals but they just keep letting them selfs to be used
7 | We stand with Israel | 0 | 10154988876073812_10154988919598812 | Here in Israel we support TRUMP! Obama was truly one of the worst presidents the United States ever had, Clinton will be the same.

So how would she ever qualifiy to receive more of it? Mind blown!A vote for hillary is to aid and abet in crimes against America!
11 | Tracy Curry Beam | 2 | 10154988876073812_10154988982988812 | When you are forced to pay a penalty because you cannot afford health insurance (yes, some can't afford even Obamacare), then you are no longer a free country. When we have open borders instead of knowing who is coming into our country, we are a country destine to fall. When illegal immigrants take priority over our veterans, homeless and the poor, we no longer are a country that cares for her own first. Remember this when you cast your ballot tomorrow. Don't vote for Hillary just because she is a woman. There will be better women to chose from later in our time.
12 | M Kay Gianopolis | 2 | 10154988876073812_10154988918353812 | So we all know HRC will win but will she win by a landslide or will it be close?
13 | Sandy Machell | 3 | 10154988876073812_10154988883733812 | We know the vote is up and we know that Killary will never get the votes Obummer did,so Trump should win in a landslide, unless it is rigged

The emails were deleted from the server with care.....in fear that the FBI soon would be there. Hillary and Bill are asleep and all snug in their beds....Dreaming of the time that Hillary was still ahead.  Hillary wants a win but instead gets a coal lump......because tomorrow the Americans elect President Trump. And so she's defeated and still dreams of what could have been.....for the following day We The People MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!
16 | Thom H. Pean Sr | 0 | 10154988876073812_10154989219648812 | Comey is pissing on the grave of every American that died fighting to keep us all safe and free.....ABC and the MSM are outrageously bias and lie indiscriminately. Please do not vote for Hillary Clinton. She is a murderer , a thief guilty of stealing government property, of lying to the FBI and the American people, and a person who is more than willing to sacrifice the lives of your children to advance her own personal agenda.......Trump is winning and if fraud can be held down to a minimum Trump will win it all...... But our country's politicians have become so crooked, so dirty, so vile, and so greedy that the chances of a fair election is slim to say the least..... The silent majority is well aware of what is going on. they are aware of the love relationship between the democrat party and the main street media and Hollywood..... The sickening bias remarks the main street press is printing in their dishonest coverage of the campaign. Spinning the truth and misleading the public..... The government is as fraudulent as any third world government has ever been. It's very frustrating, it's heartbreaking, it's a low down dirty rotten shame, and it makes me wonder what will happen if Trump is robbed of the election ??????? *The end of the campaign is near, " the end is near". Let's hope it means a new beginning and not the start of a revolution or worst yet, a race war..... Above all else VOTE RED, elect Trump, don't let the self interest groups and the greedy politicians steal our country from us. If you love America you'll vote Trump.

18 | Peggy Hodge | 1 | 10154988876073812_10154988899173812 | If Hillary wins kiss our country good bye. Our government is controlling too much of our freedom as it is. Did you see on the news this morning about a woman with 6 children being threatened by the government for selling ceviche on fb. to help support her kids. They want to put her in jail for a year or take a plea deal. Why? The government not get their 2 cents in tax from her? Why are they picking on a woman trying to support her family, where is her freedom? Hillary did a lot more then her and is running for president. We need change and we wont get it with Hillary.
19 | Virginia Perez | 1 | 10154988876073812_10154988878183812 | I can't wait for these two old friends, Clinton and Trump, to pretend to kiss and make up on Wednesday. Wink-wink. They just punked a lot of stupid people while increasing racial tension. Two birds one stone. Hopefully these peasants will be a problem which will take care of itself.
20 | Eric Rabinowitz | 1 | 10154988876073812_10154988886193812 | INDEPENDENT / UNDECIDED VOTERS KNOW the news media has been influencing the electorate! They realize by now that these fluff stories are designed to distract from the FBI's criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton's family Foundation's pay to play scheme with her State Department. The choice is simple; bigger government with higher taxes and Obama care costs, TPP, open borders, and government school conformity under Hillary Clinton or smaller government with lower taxes to attract more investment into building and bringing back industry to the US, interstate competition for lower-cost health care, secure borders, and school choice for all.

We were walking through the gate to get on the plane and we were stopped because her koala bears hand was sticking out and they pulled us aside and asked to look in her bag. Once they knew it was a stuffed toy, security asked what her koala bears name was, and she said looked up and said "Peter rabbit"...what made it even more cute was that she couldn't really say her r's. Whenever I see a koala bear, I always think, Peter rabbit ;)

Donald J. Trump is holding 5 events in 5 states in 12 hours today, while Hillary Clinton is starting her day in Pittsburgh, then stopping in Michigan, before returning to Pennsylvania.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Johnny Washika Gachago | 142 | 10154988659183812_10154988663383812 | Im not a Trump supporter, just don't like the way the media seems to be favoring Hilary everywhere and twisting Trump's word. That alone right there should question whether if the system is rigged for pne candidate or not
2 | Eddie Kostlevy | 85 | 10154988659183812_10154988669743812 | I like it how the media questions everything Trump does and says he should do something else.That sort of means he is doing the right thing.Like it was why did he go to minnesota.He didn't hold a rally with a rapper using foul language in front of children or a women that uses a stripper pole which i like but not for a presidential endorsement.
3 | Mauriel Cantrell | 48 | 10154988659183812_10154988674238812 | I don't like either candidate. However, presentation is important. The president is a representative, if you will, of our country. People from all over the world, our allies & enemies, judge us in large part, by the demeanor of our leader as he/she speaks. Trump has no filter. He cannot handle criticism. He cannot handle opposing views. He cannot handle a tough situation. He throws a fit like a belligerent, childish man, even during speeches. He makes the most obscure, immature, irresponsible remarks. All for the world to see. Hillary, is able to maintain her composure, at least act professional & has a filter when on camera. These qualities are very important when the world is watching.I had originally planned to vote third party. Now I've decided this election, isn't the election to do that. I'll be giving Hillary my vote to help keep sociopathic Trump, out.
4 | Brian Eubanks | 14 | 10154988659183812_10154988664423812 | When this election is over will you be proud of how you acted? Will you be able to say you showed dignity and were honest or did you hurl insults and spread lies? I don't mean will you be satisfied with the results and think that the ends justified the means but will you truly believe that you showed respect, dignity and honesty.
5 | Alice De Sanctis | 19 | 10154988659183812_10154988678248812 | He can go to all the states he needs to Pennsylvania is a battle ground state and she has taken the time out to go above and beyond meeting with families supporters. I just hope we make the right choice. I just don't understand what trump would do besides just wanting to say he accomplished something else in life.
6 | Tim Kime | 1 | 10154988659183812_10154989387863812 | Obamacare premiums sky rocket , higher taxes,only part time jobs, small businesses close, jobs lost,continued corruption in government, national security at risk? What is a Hillary Clinton presidency.
7 | Ken Roach | 3 | 10154988659183812_10154988890328812 | People you get what you vote for. Think long and hard about what you are doing. It is no secret that the The media is a marketing campaign hub. Basically a prostitute. Integrity is not in the vocabulary anymore.
8 | Claudia Bee Malcolm | 2 | 10154988659183812_10154988903363812 | We already knew Donald Trump Path is for him to win all the battle ground states..plus turning a blue state red..He can't..Therefore he will not win.
9 | Lori Chapman-stinnett | 2 | 10154988659183812_10154988864423812 | Because she's Old and has No stamina. .... He has outcampaigned her through this whole process... She just sucks up and brings in money! Considering, Our voted Don't count, why waste all this money on an elaborate campaign for the people?! Imagine what could be done with the Millions that have been wasted on the campaigns?! The people it could feed? The roads and bridges that could be fixed? The little houses that could be built for veterans.... With the Millions of dollars!!! Our system Sucks!
10 | Anki √Ögren | 3 | 10154988659183812_10154988734553812 | I hope there is many sensible people in your country that have the good taste NOT to vote for Trump!!!!! He is a psycopatic unstable racist sexistisk bully that will make the climat change worse! And who wants him in charge of your nuclear codesüò≠üëøüò± Its time for a women and she is an experienced one, i read her biography, she has the love and engagement from the 60thies to now to make changes to the better in your country and she is a new grandmother she will think of familys./Say all of us in Europe
11 | Patrick Kelly | 10 | 10154988659183812_10154988678348812 | he can campaign wherever he wants, the die has been cast.  the second he showed all his sociopathic tendencies towards minorities, women, immigrants, not to mention the general public by being too good to turn his house inside out and show us his finances.  this is Clinton's presidency to lose at this point.  vote wisely America.
12 | David Sammy Jr. | 5 | 10154988659183812_10154988678638812 | Don't be fooled by Trump and his antics he's looking for sympathy votes this whole episode was staged his life was not threatened..Can Trump just rush on out this election so that America can be brought back to some sought of normalcy...???
13 | Beverly Belt Warta | 1 | 10154988659183812_10154988801573812 | Trump is a brilliant con man, he deals with the powerful and wealthy across the world, obtaining property to better himself and his corporations. Hillary is a die hard politician, who has also dealt with the powerful wealthy people across the world. Tomorrow one will gain the power and control of this nation, neither of them has my trust or my faith in believing that they are for the better of our country. They both lie, cheat, steal, and are corrupted in their ways. Dems want Hillary and Reps wanted Trump till he admitted that woman want to be grabbed, manipulated and abused by other men. Both are being sought after for charges of one thing or another and to say that this is the best that we have to run and represent the U.S is appalling to say the least. We had better candidates on the ballot but not much of a glance in their direction because voting by popularity seems to control the outcome. It's like being in high school and try to decide who's the most popular to vote Prom King and Queen. Sad that we are puppets in a major control conspiracy by those that tell us we are democrats or republican as long as we don't think for ourselves and want to take a stand at what we know we don't want, yet pick what we are programmed too. Two grown adults that had so much to do and say yet belittled each other till the end. Trump once liked the Clintons but I'm sure he was brown nosing them for gain of his own standing in society. Clintons looked to up to Trump and also brown nosed to gain wealth for electoral votes and campaign money. We the people of this great nation had better choices to decide from, I for one like someone that enjoys rubbing elbows with common folk such as myself and took good ideas from both candidates and wanted change and  reform from the bad choices of past presidents! It's a sad shame that one of these two will sit in the most powerful house in the nation and determine not just our future but the future of our children,  grandchildren and every generation after, providing we survive!!

16 | Edward Shay | 5 | 10154988659183812_10154988711683812 | Hillary is in Pittsburgh, what a joke. She doesn't care about the industry that was lost or sent to Mexico or China. She also wants to shut down the coal industry. Hopefully the people if Pittsburgh won't fall under the same trap as people of Philadelphia do by thinking a "free" concert in exchange for a vote fir Hillary is worth it

She's losing & losing BIG.
23 | Shel Marie | 1 | 10154988659183812_10154989120693812 | #StopFukishima #CleantheOcean #JillStein for PresidentThe ocean's acidification levels are rising exponentially. The WWF just released their report for 2016 that scientists predict if we continue on the path of developing fossil fuels - sea life and wildlife will decline rapidly by the year 2020. Coastal communities will no longer be able to sustain themselves or depend on sea life for food. The Kuskokwim river in Alaska was suspended from commercial fishing this summer because no one is buying fish. Reports of sea life having boils and other deformities are affecting those who depend on it for subsistence. Schools need to recruit students and focus their efforts on stopping Fukishima from spilling more radiation in the ocean. It's evident Japan will not or cannot contain it alone. As long as radiation levels increase in the oceans, it will be pulled up in the clouds - rain on our mountains that lead to our rivers and streams; rain on our livestock and crops making food from the inland unsuitable to eat; and it will devastate the global landscape by killing trees we need for oxygen.Mankind cannot ignore the effects of Fukishima any longer. This will become of major national interest before most people know or are prepared.
24 | Todd Dorsey | 0 | 10154988659183812_10154988912833812 | For those of you who still haven't voted yet the because you haven't had a chance or because you don't know who to vote for it's pretty simple. Are you happy with the way things have gone the last eight years are you happy with our economy, our  standing in the world , with the unemployment,  the way our vets have been treated, our 20 trillion in debt, high tuition costs, giving Iran billions, giving 50% of our uranium to putin, etc. If you're happy with all those things then the choice is clear then you should vote for Hillary because you cannot blame anything on trump. He as not been in office. Hillary's hands are all over all of the decisions that have been made in the last 8 years.
