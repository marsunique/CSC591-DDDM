1 | William J Smith Jr. | 32 | 1553204641366227_1553313028022055 | I just early voted,,, My vote was for Donald J Trump. I have had enough of the Democrats elitists and the Republican elitists,, it is time for a new leadership. Time to Drain the Swamp.
2 | Donna Straley | 19 | 1553204641366227_1553303874689637 | McMullin, unlike Trump, seems like a decent human being.  The ads being run by pro-Trump bigots attacking him because his mother is gay & married to another woman are disgusting & typical of Trump trash.
3 | Marianne Thoresen Dirksen | 30 | 1553204641366227_1553285751358116 | Can anyone, ANYONE, give me 5 good things that Trump has done for ANYONE other than himself or his family? Can anyone, ANYONE, give me a hundred things that Trump has done to others that is evil, conniving, deceitful, and harmful to others?
4 | Anthony Njigua | 4 | 1553204641366227_1553303661356325 | Hillary should withdraw Utah over the weekend and endorse McMullin asking Dems supporters to vote for McMullin and stick it to dt. November Surprise!?! lol!
5 | Dean Henry | 1 | 1553204641366227_1553290858024272 | The repuGlicans may need to keep an open mind that their next nominee should be a an unknown for a change. Someone who comes out from nowhere like Bill Clinton did.
6 | Tony Garcia | 0 | 1553204641366227_1553358681350823 | You can’t fix it. It’s over.Hillary Clinton's race to the White House is over and no amount of “talking” about the situation will resurrect the happy times, she's finished. you have to reconcile your heartbreak and let yourself grieve, take it easy and keep it casual. I know it's hard to accept, but it's the reality and the faster you accept it and embrace it the faster you'll recover from the beating. Hillary R. Clinton will NOT be the next president of the United States and will never be. Embrace it... accept it... you people should have elected Bernie Sanders when you had a chance.
7 | Philip Oliver | 1 | 1553204641366227_1553348598018498 | As a Democrat - I don't agree with Mr mcmullin on much, but at least he is an intelligent and respectful American, which is more than I can say for Donald Trump and his hordes of inbred idiot followers.
8 | David Warkentin | 0 | 1553204641366227_1553365578016800 | MSNBC..YOU SUCK...For the love of GOD......You know Clinton is as crooked as it gets and will put us all at risk, yet you morons still defend her....
9 | Katherine Licari Venturoso | 0 | 1553204641366227_1553332121353479 | He lies about giving to charity even kids charities.. shows up uninvited, takes the chair on the podium for a REAL donor and then doesn't donate a dime.. and he did the Macarena and danced out never donating a single penny ..
10 | Kathy Phelps | 1 | 1553204641366227_1553362138017144 | I was almost sold on McMullin...until I discovered his VP running mate was supporting Hillary hard core until this campaign. Then, I found it tasted a bit like a manipulation.  I'll consider him seriously for a full run in the next election, though!  Make it a serious run, and I WILL consider it!
11 | Jaime Grayson | 1 | 1553204641366227_1553333778019980 | Are you kidding me...MSNBC you piece of shot on here talking about kkk.....etc.....talk about. Clinton emails..or anything in facts....even if your going to bash trump TRY to make it real.....if the kkk support trump he can't HELP IT.....you are serious low life's..YOU are insisting racial unrest STOP.....do want useless riots people die you piece of. Shot...on bothsided
12 | L.t. Dean-Ausbun | 0 | 1553204641366227_1553319528021405 | No his only mission is to twart our voting system and attempt to stop both Trump and HRC from reaching 270. This is disgusting and disgraceful because that would take the voting power away from the American people and give it to our Corrupted Speaker Ryan and the rest of the swamp to anoint whom our Corrupted Government wants . #NeverMcMullin
13 | Gabriel James | 0 | 1553204641366227_1553374991349192 | Meet Evan McMullin, the man the media would like to see help Hillary Clinton defeat Donald Trump. The media's biased reporting and outright collusion with Clinton hasn't done the job, so here's another tactic they're working on.
14 | Donna Butler | 0 | 1553204641366227_1553298441356847 | OMGosh, WHY is it the late comer wanna-be's feel at this late time they can make a difference, especially when they failed a primary run....That's like serving soured Milk...They're just pouring their rhetoric in-order to ruin it for others...YUCK!
15 | Kathleen Pepi Southern | 2 | 1553204641366227_1553309488022409 | Don't really care who exactly he is; just that he is the guy who may take away six electoral votes from Trump. Wishing him well with that.
16 | Chuck Foster | 0 | 1553204641366227_1553318784688146 | Thank you WikiLeaks for proving Hillary cheated Bernie out of the nomination, Donna Brazil may have sent her the question in the debates, but now we know Hillary flat out cheated us out of our movement to make America a better place for everyone, and now we'll stop at nothing to make sure she don't win the election against Trump, but we're going to do everything we can to make sure Hillary goes to jail for her crimes!
17 | Carl Greerio | 3 | 1553204641366227_1553298301356861 | MSNBC IS BOTTOM OF THE BARREL and thier commentors/so called journalists..they are NOT journalists..they are a gossip network..obviously for their commentators/journalists they MOVED THE BARREL AND DUG UNDER IT...SHAMEFUL..no wonder their ratings are so low...BOTTOM OF THE BARREL!!!!
18 | Cristal Brooks | 10 | 1553204641366227_1553284338024924 | Remember when Obama said his administration would be the most transparent in history? Well thanks to Wikileaks's now they are, and now they're all pissed about it, liberal hypocrisy at its finest...
19 | Amir Parvez | 7 | 1553204641366227_1553284838024874 | Crooked Hillary Clinton is going down folks. She can't win now. But they will certainly try to steal the elections. Don't let them get away with that like Bernie Sanders supporters did.Regards,Irredeemable ex-Sanders supporter#NeverHillary #HillaryForPrison2016
20 | Jacqueline Benjamin | 2 | 1553204641366227_1553307201355971 | This guy needs to win Utah, if Hillary isn't. Show Trump that you donot want him in your state.
21 | Leslie Betsy | 6 | 1553204641366227_1553284758024882 | Get back to some real news before you hand deadly donnie a win

23 | Danny Gebhardt | 1 | 1553204641366227_1553361224683902 | Rooting for McMullin.  Anything that can potentially take away from Trump's electoral points is okay with me.
24 | Sue Tettamant Peters | 4 | 1553204641366227_1553291171357574 | The good thing about him is that he will likely keep Trump from getting the Electoral College votes...
25 | Jennifer Turner | 2 | 1553204641366227_1553295018023856 | It's too late to promote another candidate..... y'all should have been fair from the start. Bad media and journalism!

4 | David Visconti | 26 | 1140846939333073_1140862425998191 | Hillary Clinton is a disgrace to our government America wake up how did she get three hundred million dollars she never invented anything or owns a corporation or company she got that money off your back and my back wake up
5 | Marilyn Kopecky | 13 | 1140846939333073_1140860359331731 | I've still never gotten a straight answer from people: You hired Obama when you knew he had No executive experience, No military experience, No financial experience, No business experience, No foreign policy experience, No foreign trade experience, No healthcare experience, and No economic experience. Why?
6 | Cheryl Hall | 14 | 1140846939333073_1140869425997491 | CNN all the news going on and this is what you come up with.  Really! Check it out; Americans are not the dimwits you think we are.  Many are just sick of the lies, corruption, and manipulation by Hillary and minions including this so called news agency.
7 | Shane Snyder | 4 | 1140846939333073_1140906139327153 | To those complaining about how horrible both Trump and Clinton are, remember: WE put them there. They didn't just show up. There was a primary. There were 16 other Republicans. There were two other Democrats (however, the argument can be made that the Democrat primary was rigged). If you feel you're always choosing the lesser of two evils every four years, then you're not doing it right. The issue isn't the politician, it's our apathy. Get involved. Educate yourself on the issues. Vote your values, every election (local, primary, general, etc). WE run this country. The politicians work for US. If you're not happy with the current situation stop complaining and start making a difference.
8 | Rhonda Sheptock | 1 | 1140846939333073_1140908332660267 | Meanwhile Trump is actually going to court for Child Rape and his Fraudulent University that stole millions from hard working Americans, shipping his work off the other countries while touting he wants to make America great, sexually assaulting women for decades, building his businesses with a Chinese steel, hiring US Contractors to architect and build his hotels and then not paying them, bankrupting his businesses and putting people out of work and not providing healthcare benefits for the ones he does have working. And this is all on top of him being a racist, misogynist, hate breeding, war monger who disrespects our veterans and war heroes and makes fun of disabled people! And we can also add that he not only lost 500million on a single year beating the great business man that he is, but found a loophole to then not pay any personal federal income tax for the last 20 years. So he isn't contributing to our schools, fire/police departments, servicemen, veterans, or any other departments that he states he cares so much about!
9 | Steph Corbin | 1 | 1140846939333073_1140884369329330 | has anyone read a tom Clancy novel where Jack Ryan is always the american hero who defeats the enemy?has anyone read a tom Clancy novel where Jack Ryan is always the american hero who defeats the enemy?tom Clancy couldn't even write a novel where you would have to suspend disbelief enough to get through a book that narrates this presidential election. you literally have the antagonist who is Hillary, who has a lieutenant Hum Abadine is working for the Muslim brotherhood, (her mother is a member) and the Protagonist who is Trump (the american businessman)who is trying to defeat the corruption, but a rambunctious character. Then, on top of your novel you have a character named Wiener who sends wiener pics. Then you have the FBI who covered up for the antagonist then in toward end of this fictional novel does the right thing and stands up for the protagonist and the american people by doing the right thing and exposing the enemy (Clinton) and her international scams and her bribes and lies, but so far in the story then we don't have an ending for it yet because we don't have a winner yet in the election. This is straight out of a Tom Clancy novel. Now Jack Ryan would end up winning for the united states and ill be bias Donald Trump is our american protagonist in this story.you couldn't even write a fictional novel this well without suspending disbelief. litereally look whats going on.
10 | Tommy Haynes | 3 | 1140846939333073_1140855785998855 | How is the Clinton campaign like the Trump campaign?  It was Harry Reid and other democrats in congress that are bringing up the Russia issue..and it's quite relevant . The FBI held that back because of the election but chose to expose this non story about Clinton..or Clinton's aid
11 | Kaye Kinkead | 3 | 1140846939333073_1140883652662735 | Wow I told my husband Chris Matthews must want the Donald for president he calls his campaign manager his friend and let's her talk longer without interpretation than I have ever seen. From the looks of these remarks it is working. The only thing is I have to live with it right along with them. I can't believe people want a man for president that won't pay the people working for him, but he has filled bankruptcy 4 times.
12 | Dennis Enderson | 3 | 1140846939333073_1140884822662618 | Stop it. Just... stop. You people and your sycophantic coverage of Trump are the reason for this so-called "parity" in unfavorability. In any event, she will be our next president, with no thanks to you.
13 | Lorraine McNamer | 0 | 1140846939333073_1140913499326417 | Why don't you go through each and every Hillary scandal and set the record straight instead of letting your guests trash her without calling them out? No interruptions there...only when someone is actually trying to set the record straight with facts!
14 | Jennifer Jennifer | 2 | 1140846939333073_1140859512665149 | EVERYONE should change their deductions to 9 quickly. You will not be paying income tax and it will be the strongest show of protest of this farce of an election. Yes, in April if you choose to file your taxes you will have to claim the correct deduction, but there is nothing preventing you from claiming 9 during the course of the year. If done for a short period of time it will hardly change your tax return.
15 | Jo Ann Whitehead | 0 | 1140846939333073_1140938482657252 | Unbelievable!!! ..Jail TRUMP!!! .A 13 year old rape victim, a sexual predator, ties to Russian president, no tax reports and trump univ. scandal but all I am hearing about on the cable channels are Hillary's stupid emails. Be gone!!

17 | Adam Duppstadt | 2 | 1140846939333073_1140901392660961 | Why is the mainstream media doing all this coverage of the Clinton email controversy, yet neglecting the fact that Trump has a child rape case hearing scheduled December 16th?
18 | Harold Woeller | 2 | 1140846939333073_1140877699329997 | History always repeats itself, google the Carter/Reagan election. Everything they say about Trump, they said about Reagan, even the nuclear stuff. The media & their polls even predicted a Carter landslide. And he wasn’t even headed for indictment!
19 | Carl Owens | 3 | 1140846939333073_1140870269330740 | Uma was hiding the emails from HRC and the FBI,they were her Insurance if HRC threw her under the bus,They are all crooked creeps,Anyone with Wiener as part of their circle of friends are TRASH REALLY
20 | Carolyn Peterson | 4 | 1140846939333073_1140892319328535 | OMG OMG they found more emails to Hillary on a lap top! A lap top, I tell you! Pffttt Really? This is driving everyone nuts? Unless you can show me an email from Hillary saying that she is passing classified info out like Halloween candy and is loving it, don't bother me with this crap.
21 | Geoff Hunkin | 0 | 1140846939333073_1140903385994095 | The result of 25 years of constant attack with NO indictments for Hillary. Trrump has a 59% unfavourable rating after less than a year in Politics.
22 | Paul Issa Hachem | 2 | 1140846939333073_1140875925996841 | Over 30 years of smearing her reputation, and her unfavorability is only 59%, I am surprised. The con man achieved that on his own in less than a year.
23 | Marie Callahan | 1 | 1140846939333073_1140907465993687 | Sick of hearing about Clinton's emails after Bush, Rice, and Powell got a pass. Fed up with nasty man Donald Trump. Considering Comey sending his confusing letter of innuendo to Congress, perhaps Trump is right about the election being rigged--in favor of Trump, of course.
24 | Ray French | 2 | 1140846939333073_1140894842661616 | You can thank the conservative right and the biased media for at least half of that number of unfavorabilty for their lies about her!
25 | James Nelson | 0 | 1140846939333073_1140861135998320 | STEP 1)    Poisoning the wellPoisoning the well (or attempting to poison the well) is a fallacy where irrelevant adverse information about a target is preemptively presented to an audience, with the intention of discrediting or ridiculing everything that the target person is about to say. Poisoning the well can take the form of an (explicit or implied) argument, and is considered by some philosophers an informal fallacy.A poisoned-well "argument" has the following form:1. Unfavorable information (Hillary’s emails) (be it true or false) about person A (Hillary)is presented by another (Comey & the GOP). (e.g. "Before you listen to my opponent, may I remind you that he has been in jail")2. Therefore, the claims made by person A will be false. I have seen this tactic used by American lawyers many times in my career.  During or just before a big case is to be made the attorneys will poison the well against their opponents merely to discredit them.However, there is never any thought about defending the false allegations in the court of law; only in the court of public opinion.Don’t be fooled!!!

1 | Jason Briggs | 292 | 1140793299338437_1140813952669705 | Trump is garbage! Don't sell our country to a casino owner! Don't sell our country to gun lobbyists who point fingers at Hillary's involvement with Saudi when really it's them making millions on weapon sales.. Don't sell our country further into big business.. Big business lobbyists already make many decisions within our government and Trump will be the last piece of total control.. We were finally progressing as a nation..
2 | Bitsy Perkins | 295 | 1140793299338437_1140815506002883 | Kellyanne Conway is a liar just like her client. She better collect that last check cause Trump is going to be in trouble with the IRS as well according to the New York Times.
3 | Kelcy Cole | 88 | 1140793299338437_1140816732669427 | No.  He should be asking Kellyanne about the article in Slate today from some computer nerds that found a Trump server communicating with two servers in Russia.  http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/cover_story/2016/10/was_a_server_registered_to_the_trump_organization_communicating_with_russia.html Is that connection under investigation because looking at the data posted in the article the communication between servers did not end with the exit of Manafort.   Is the FBI investigating that?
4 | Terrie Wheatley May | 100 | 1140793299338437_1140817319336035 | Why would anyone ask Kelly Anne Conway a question and expect a straightforward honest answer. So, so tired of having my intelligence insulted. I don't care what candidate she supports, is she going away after this election?? She, others like her and the media have done so much to hurt American democracy. Keeping the masses chasing their tails.
5 | Abby Rosenthaler | 86 | 1140793299338437_1140817359336031 | These Trump surrogates, especially KellyAnne ConArtist lie and spin as easily as they breathe. It's frightening how the blatant lies roll out of her vile mouth. Is that a disorder?

You let her talk all over you and never brought up anything for her to explain, only let her spew out garbage about Clinton, then she said that about PA and smirked at you.  Why does she get a pass?
8 | Judith Brownstein | 58 | 1140793299338437_1140823106002123 | And Chris Matthews always goes too easy on her since they're old friends.  Can't wait till next week so I'll never have to hear her saccharine little baby voice again.
9 | Laurissa Doonan | 37 | 1140793299338437_1140833762667724 | Chris Matthews is wholly ineffective interviewing her. He let's lies slide and doesn't challenge her on facts about her candidate. He acts as if he's got a crush on her, and it's pathetic.
10 | Vern Vartdal | 30 | 1140793299338437_1140815152669585 | We are on the verge of electing a Russian plant Donald Trump.  Ronald Reagan is turning in his grave, but can't remember why...
11 | Dabney Conwell | 13 | 1140793299338437_1140835056000928 | I wish Chris Mathews would play Hardball with Mrs. Conway. It is clear they have known each other for a long time. He let her go on for much longer than his customary guests. This is no softball game......
12 | Kev Freeman | 19 | 1140793299338437_1140820809335686 | She's nothing but a political spin hack. After November 8 she and her client can slink back to the gutter where they belong.
13 | Steven Zink | 3 | 1140793299338437_1140905435993890 | How many paid Hillary trolls here? Hillary sold 20% of uranium to Russia in return for a massive speaking fee for Bill. Padedto made millions sitting on the board. Lol. Nice try and deflection though
14 | Mike DiBiase | 4 | 1140793299338437_1140832426001191 | Another distraction from HRC criminal email behavior. It was HRC who sold uranium to Russia. This guy is just another Huma nothing to see hear.
15 | Shane Snyder | 3 | 1140793299338437_1140906969327070 | No link between Trump & Russia. Per the NYTimes: "Law enforcement officials say that none of the investigations have found any link between Mr. Trump and the Russian government."No link between WikiLeaks and Russia.But Podesta & Clinton were involved in selling 20% of US uranium to Russia...
16 | Emmit Penny | 11 | 1140793299338437_1140818982669202 | Chris are you starting to champion Donald Trump? This is the second interview you've done regarding Trump where you've haven't come back in you normal form of hard questioning. Seems you are play it a bit meek.

19 | Hope Armstrong | 11 | 1140793299338437_1140826822668418 | Talking about letting someone off the hook. Morning Joe did the same thing this morning. What's up? Scared Trump may send a nasty tweet.
20 | Maria Lopez | 5 | 1140793299338437_1140829629334804 | I used to watch your show Chris Matthews and you seem to have a great commentary however, I feel you have become just as harsh as morning Joe.
21 | Kimmeth Powell | 6 | 1140793299338437_1140849862666114 | All through this campaign Conway and Trump have relied heavily on a campaign of "I'm rubber and you're glue" - considering this, America would be wise to consider his ties to Russia very carefully. Maybe he is saying the election is rigged because HE is trying as hard as he can to RIG it. He is undermining our democracy and weakening us in the eyes of the world. He is not a patriot, he is not a nationalist - he is a ticking time bomb to our way of life and international standing.

We've got new polling from the deep red state of Utah. 

Can Donald J. Trump hang on? Will Evan McMullin pull the upset? Don't count out Hillary Clinton either.

And then Hillary hired her!Huma Abedin - shared security documents with her husband Anthony Weiner the sex offender. She is Daughter of Saleha Mahmood Abedin, a pro-Sharia sociologist with ties to numerous Islamist organizations including the Muslim BrotherhoodThis is Hillary's team?Hillary - still lives with Bill the sex offender that was impeached. Did nothing to help the American's in Bengasi, laid to congress, laid to the FBI, Bill meets with Loretta lynch and CNN "The Clinton News Network" along with MSNBC talks all day about Trump….and this is NOT liberal media bias? Than what is? drain the swamp.CNN "The Clinton News Network"
2 | Henry H Mayo Jr. | 11 | 1140775036006930_1140828559334911 | Will be interesting to see what Trump & Christie have in store for themselves, between Trump's hundreds of outstanding lawsuits - including those regarding the fraudulent Trump university and Trump's potential rape of a 13 year old girl - and Chris Christie's obvious involvement in causing the vindictive Bridgegate. These two disgusting,corrupt men deserve each other.

11 | George Cottrell | 5 | 1140775036006930_1140783176006116 | We should probably count out Clinton. The FBI doesn't re-open an investigation 11 days before an election unless they're pretty sure someone is going to be prosecuted. Whether it is Huma, Podesta, Brazille, or any of the Clintons remains to be seen.

13 | Joel Smith | 0 | 1140775036006930_1140870379330729 | Why is everyone acting like there is only a choice between Hillary and trump? Are people going to continue to take what that candidate would do if they are elected? Why are so many giving up and giving in to what our system has given us? We separated from England because they told us we have to take what the monachary gives us and live with it. Have we forgotten the Declaration of Independence?  “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to affect their Safety and Happiness. -- it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.” I will not choose between a racist unregistered sex offender who refuses to own mistakes or pay taxes, or choose an unconvicted felon who is in the advanced stages of a terminal cancer of corruption. Donald can only make America great again by learning to keep his mouth shut and his hands to himself. Hillary belongs in prison with a number of corrupt leaders. They are an embarrassment to our country and what we stand for, and so are their supporters who turn a blind eye to their inexcusable offenses. The world is watching, and they’re either laughing or crying at our plight. I want to be proud to be an American and so I refuse to vote for either one of them, I will vote for what our country was founded on, and if that doesn’t work, I will unite with others who have had enough to impeach whoever is elected based on the constitution which states: “The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.” #NeverTrump #NeverClinton

If you stand with the bad guys you ARE a bad guy. I'm not being hyperbolic either I'm just being honest, ain't that what you guys like? Straight talk?

19 | Kevin M. Carney | 5 | 1338122746283974_1338203382942577 | A gentleman named Bill Howell eloquently wrote the below letter.Dear Mr. Trump,It’s taken me a while to realize this and to admit it, but I’m grateful to you.For the past few months I’ve spent a good deal of time lamenting your campaign and the poison it has so effortlessly generated. I’ve watched our country imploding, our public discourse become polluted, our political climate grows ever more corrosive, and wrongly assumed you were to blame.It’s only lately I’ve come to understand that you haven’t manufactured our current national ugliness—you’ve simply revealed it.By saying the irresponsible, mean-spirited, ignorant things you say so freely and so frequently, you’ve given other like-minded people license to do the same. You’ve opened up the floodgates for our corporate sewage to flow fully. People no longer conceal their vile mess, they now revel in it, they broadcast it and retweet it.You’ve made bigotry and racism socially acceptable again and that has been a kind of twisted gift because it’s allowed me to really see people; not as they pretend to be on the surface—but in the very depths of their wounded, weaponized hearts.Over and over as your campaign has persisted, your supporters would tell me that they like you because you “speak your mind”. It wasn’t until recently that I’ve realized that you speak their minds. You’ve given credence to their prejudices and made those prejudices go mainstream.Thanks to the terrible ground you’ve broken, politicians, pastors, friends, and strangers, both in person and on social media now regularly out themselves as hateful, intolerant, and malicious—and they remind me just how close they are to me, just how deep the sickness in us runs, and just how far we have to go together.You’ve emboldened people to be open about things they used to conceal for the sake of decorum, and though it turns my stomach, I know that this is the only way we can move forward; to have that cancerous stuff exposed fully so that it can be dealt with. Our progress as a nation is predicated on authentic dialogue, no matter how brutal and disheartening that dialogue is.In other words, you’ve let us know what we’re really dealing with here and while it’s been rightly disturbing, it’s also been revelatory. That’s the thing about that kind of harsh light: you’re forced to see everything. Beauty and monstrosity equally illuminated.Now don’t get me wrong, I think you’re the least qualified, least knowledgeable Presidential candidate we may ever have had participate this far into the process, and if you somehow were elected I’d fear gravely for the world my children would inherit—should it survive your Presidency at all. I believe you’re reckless, bitter, and completely reprehensible; the very worst kind of bully.But whether you win or lose, you’ve already allowed me the blessing of Truth; about me, about you, about other candidates, about our nation.And in the process you’ve also shown me that I am not alone in resisting you and this ugly thing you’ve revealed about us.You’ve generated an equally loud, equally passionate response to it and this is where I find my hope these days.I find it in those for whom equality isn’t just a cheap buzzword, it’s the most precious of hills to die on.I find it in those people who refuse to be silent in the face of our impending shared regression.I find it in those willing to be bolder in defending the inherent value of all people.I find it in the growing army of those who will not tolerate hatred as a core American value.I find it in those who reject violence as our default response to dissension.I find it in the ever rising voice of people who will not let malice and bitterness represent them in the world.Today I find my hope in those who, like me, will not be complicit in allowing bigotry and intolerance to become a source of national pride, because we’ve seen where that leads.Yes, Mr Trump, you’ve unearthed our hidden sickness and you’ve allowed it to go viral.You brought every awful thing about us out into the open.You will NEVER Get My Vote!
20 | Elaine Daprano | 3 | 1338122746283974_1338165806279668 | Yes he was.  I remember reading that he was involved with Goldman Sachs when they were run out of the Ukraine;  I think HE was the reason for the oust.

24 | Christopher Aaron Rizzie | 1 | 1338122746283974_1338169732945942 | Seriously that's what you're reporting?  Nice try with trying to bring the spotlight off crooked Hillary! She has nothing left in her war chest and is grasping at straws. Pathetic

Hillary Clinton's 6-point national lead over Donald J. Trump  remains virtually unchanged since last week, even after FBI Director James Comey announced the discovery of emails that could be "pertinent" to the investigation of Clinton's use of a private email server.

6 | Chris Carson | 56 | 1338088372954078_1338098189619763 | Who would vote for a racist bigot who openly brags about openly groping women, demeans a disabled man, demeans Gold Star parents, and has a temperament that makes a 2 year old look mature.Ronald Reagan wouldn't have supported this carnival barker - just ask his sons (one's Conservative, and the other is smarter).
7 | Sharon Kuchan | 40 | 1338088372954078_1338096799619902 | Why is everyone talking about something that nobody knows what it is! DEmand Trump taxes!,,,,,, what the heck is he hiding! No charities and Russa! Way worse than an email that have already been combed through!
8 | Lise Melin | 43 | 1338088372954078_1338093152953600 | Voters are very savvy.I saw this comment by David Wolski on an article I read, and it expressed my thoughts. I'm sharing it with his permission:The e-mail scandal is so small. Did Hillary choose a private server in an attempt to bypass FOIA requests and control what data was accessible? Probably. Was it an unwise decision that made the data less secure? Yes. Is this criminal and disqualifying? No. It's further evidence of her penchant for secrecy, driven by being under constant partisan attacks for 30 years. I'd prefer if she were more transparent. I do not blame her in the slightest for not being so.This doesn't change the fact that she is the most qualified presidential candidate to run in my lifetime, or that her policies will be great for this country.Donald Trump is an actual criminal. His list of controversies are long, and show that he has a history of fraud, misogyny and vindictiveness. I'll take "too secretive" over that any day.
9 | Kathryn Rubenstein | 47 | 1338088372954078_1338089919620590 | Emails Smeemails. No one cares about Hillary's email woes. Donald Trump on the other hand is a racist, bigot, misogynist, sexist, liar, cheat, fraud, rapist, sexual predator, and an IDIOT! Nuff said.
10 | Steve Hunley | 20 | 1338088372954078_1338128012950114 | Clinton just spoke in Cin, Ohio.Clinton had to talk fast, she has a fundraiser at disbarred lawyer Stan Chesley's house in Indian Hill. He cannot go to Kentucky as there is an arrest warrant for him there. He was involved in a class action suit against Fen-Phen where he and his cronies won many millions for the plaintiffs. Hardly any money was ever paid to victims. He was disbarred and an award for $43 million against him was ordered. He has avoided paying to the point of being in contempt and a warrant for his arrest was issued. Very similar to the Clinton's, people around him received felony convictions, Prison sentences, and some committed suicide. Looks like the Clinton's are going to get some of the $$$$. Birds of a feather!
11 | Robert Whittington | 18 | 1338088372954078_1338090679620514 | Don't know much about politics. All I know is on Nov. 8 we will have a new president. Some people will be happy and some will be pissed. Welcome to America. Next story.
12 | Rhonda Sheptock | 10 | 1338088372954078_1338164839613098 | Meanwhile Trump is actually going to court for Child Rape and his Fraudulent University that stole millions from hard working Americans, shipping his work off the other countries while touting he wants to make America great, sexually assaulting women for decades, building his businesses with a Chinese steel, hiring US Contractors to architect and build his hotels and then not paying them, bankrupting his businesses and putting people out of work and not providing healthcare benefits for the ones he does have working. And this is all on top of him being a racist, misogynist, hate breeding, war monger who disrespects our veterans and war heroes and makes fun of disabled people! And we can also add that he not only lost 500million on a single year beating the great business man that he is, but found a loophole to then not pay any personal federal income tax for the last 20 years. So he isn't contributing to our schools, fire/police departments, servicemen, veterans, or any other departments that he states he cares so much about!
13 | Sissy Bild | 7 | 1338088372954078_1338116466284602 | Why do you allow Chris Matthews to continually salivate over Kellyanne and let her lead a false narrative?! She completely took control of his interview with her and he allowed her to spew falsehoods and highly polarizing B.S. Maddening!
14 | Mimi O'Reilly | 6 | 1338088372954078_1338168609612721 | These emails is not important at all . Hilary is on every ones mind to get elected and to defeat Donald ! So who really care about email that Comey is not even sure what they are ! Life must go on and vote Blue all the way . Let's kick out all Republicans out of the Senate !
15 | Thomas Moore | 7 | 1338088372954078_1338111792951736 | This post is B.S. and most of these comments show how ignorant and close minded most people are. Do some research for yourselves. Stop relying on FB for your political influence and information.
16 | Leadell Jenkins | 4 | 1338088372954078_1338127076283541 | As well she should be after all the Republicans have tried to steal this election from the Democrats lets not forget Bush/Gore 2000 we must VOTE DEMOCRAT down the ballot or CON MAN DON (Trump) will steal this election by any means necessary
17 | Avinash Feyad Singh | 4 | 1338088372954078_1338133542949561 | If you people didn't realise it. But from inception, no one really cared or knew exactly what Hilary Clinton's email investigation was all about. A pew research study found that more than half of the country didn't know what the email scandal was about.
18 | Krystal Perez | 5 | 1338088372954078_1338130222949893 | PERFECTION! hahaThe "nasty women" need to stand up to what we think correct. The "nasty women" need to come together, so our voice is heard; all others who are with Hillary Clinton and her train-of-thought, of course.He is just afraid, about people seeing that, the "nasty woman", Hillary Clinton, can do the job, and do it better.   I see him, I hear him, and my blood boils. We cannot let him be the face and voice of our country.
19 | Lara Ann Notes | 13 | 1338088372954078_1338101696286079 | Clinton is a failed, extremely liberal candidate with probably the most criminal baggage of any presidential candidate, but certainly in recent history. It's important that that American voters show that Clinton is not an overwhelming favorite in this country and that the history books show that, if she's elected, we could have elected a much, much, much better first woman president. American voters need to show that Clinton's presidency, if she's elected, is illegitimate from the start.  She will never be MY president.  It's also important that voters elect their GOP senate and representatives. This will mean more gridlock for 4 years, but it's better to get nothing done than to give Clinton the powers she needs to screw this country further. We see the results of that power from Obama's tenure and he has caused this country serious harm. Clinton will do the same if not worse. And asfar as the Election Rigging is concerned, the only way to prove it one way or the other is cast your vote and actually test the process. Go  Vote!!!  God Bless America.
20 | Tiasha Machuga | 3 | 1338088372954078_1338124686283780 | I don't believe the polls. I literally had a pollster hang up on me when I wouldn't choose between Clinton and trump. I live in a write in state and Jill stein is on the ballot in 47 states so how accurate are the numbers? How many others have been hung up on for not answering the questions the way they want. JS
21 | Michael Knock | 3 | 1338088372954078_1338164602946455 | More BS by MSNBC...Hillary's done nothing, but cheat,lie and steal...Most of you Millennials weren't around when she and her husband embarrassed this country and drove the jobs out of this country. She left a trail of blood when someone crossed her or disagreed with her....She screwed Bernie out of the election
22 | Bryan Alexander Perez | 2 | 1338088372954078_1338151446281104 | U.S. Code Title 18, Section 2017So Much Wrong and So Few Seem to CareWord for word from the Cornell Law LibraryFormer United States Attorney General Michael Mukasey tells MSNBC that not only is Hillary Clinton's private email server illegal, it "disqualifies" her from holding any federal office. Such as, say, President of the United States. Very specifically points to one federal law, Title 18. Section 2071.For those of us who do not have United States Code committed to memory, here's what it says:?(a) Whoever willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys, or attempts to do so, or, with intent to do so takes and carries away any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.(b) Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States. As used in this subsection, the term ?office? does not include the office held by any person as a retired officer of the Armed Forces of the United States.?
23 | Elizabeth M Regalado | 6 | 1338088372954078_1338127106283538 | The first time I heard trump speak... I was immediately reminded of hitler.  Now when I hear of him... I'm reminded of the coming of the antichrist.
24 | Diane Marie Wargo | 3 | 1338088372954078_1338110999618482 | Even if she wins half the country will never regard her as the president. She can keep her wars, her heroin trade, her empire of dirt because that is what her and all the neocon and neolibs have turned our once beautiful country into.
25 | Greg Lang | 1 | 1338088372954078_1123129561137678 | One of these two will be president. One is crooked and unethical. We survived Nixon, we'll survive her. The other is a thin skinned narcissist who thinks any criticism of him is a personal attack. He praises foreign dictators as great leaders while casting doubt that our own president is even an American. He has claimed he knows more than our generals, he has insulted POW's and Gold Star families. He has threatened our constitutional right to free speech. He must not be elected.

If FBI Director James Comey has one standard for news related to Donald J. Trump, and another for news related to Hillary Clinton...there's a serious problem.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Favour Johnson Destiny | 872 | 1338050206291228_1338050976291151 | So, to recap. Trump will go on trial in November accused of racketeering, and again in December accused of child rape. He is a sexual predator, hasn't released his tax returns, and has used his foundation's money to pay his legal fees. He has abused the family of a war hero and... oh, but let's talk about some emails Hillary didn't send from someone else's computer, that weren't a crime anyway, because that's how to choose a president. Come on, America. Focus.
2 | Chris Finch | 237 | 1338050206291228_1338051532957762 | He's trying to shore up his run for office in the future by keeping the Republican Party onside...because he knows he's finished as director of the FBI
3 | Donna Kasa | 171 | 1338050206291228_1338053522957563 | A very serious problem!  No candidate has had distinct ties to Russia, and sex allegations, and Trump University, and things you don't want me to mention .
4 | Claudia Bee Malcolm | 86 | 1338050206291228_1338067302956185 | But remember what Donald Trump said..Russia if you are hearing me..I want you to find those 30 thousands emails that was deleted. .A haha ..This man is a threat to our national security more than Hillary. .As someone wants to be president thought he should be the one protecting those emails from the Russians. .As he have no idea what's in them..
5 | Jeff DiLavore | 90 | 1338050206291228_1338060036290245 | If MSNBC and CNN have one standard for news related to Donald J. Trump, and another for news related to Hillary Clinton...there's a serious problem.See what I did there???
6 | Rhonda Sheptock | 40 | 1338050206291228_1338083629621219 | Meanwhile Trump is actually going to court for Child Rape and his Fraudulent University that stole millions from hard working Americans, shipping his work off the other countries while touting he wants to make America great, sexually assaulting women for decades, building his businesses with a Chinese steel, hiring US Contractors to architect and build his hotels and then not paying them, bankrupting his businesses and putting people out of work and not providing healthcare benefits for the ones he does have working.

7 | Joey Poirier | 24 | 1338050206291228_1338052602957655 | So, in a nutshell. We can anticipate a November surprise? Last week was Clinton and I guess...this week, it's Trump turn? This election sucks.
8 | Matt Justt | 35 | 1338050206291228_1338062366290012 | What about when MSNBC reports news of one fashion about Hillary Clinton, and then a completely different standard when reporting all their biased news stories continuously bashing the other candidate Donald Trump? Do we have a problem then too???
9 | Dale Whiting | 25 | 1338050206291228_1338084962954419 | So Comey has a double standard, one which applies to Republicans and Trump, and a second which applies to Democrats and Clinton. Now things are clear. DUMP both Comey and TRUMP.
10 | Michael Vinci | 21 | 1338050206291228_1338059876290261 | So let's recap as the person below me has stated there is only one I repeat only one suspected felon that is under investigation by the FBI for three major scandals and that is Hillary Clinton. She must step down for the good of our country before she causes a constitutional crisis. You all should  be ashamed
11 | Tricia Meskel | 25 | 1338050206291228_1338060906290158 | Wow. People should not vote till more of this comes out . Now reports that Clinton left secret documents in a hotel room in China. That was reported at the time. She has horrible judgement. I think she believes since she has gotten away with so much that she doesn't have to secure anything. Soldiers are in jail for a fraction of what she did. All this talk about Comey is ridiculous because it wouldn't be an issue if she didn't set up a private server to keep things from the public.  She is the only one to blame!!!!
12 | Mary Serra | 4 | 1338050206291228_1630843090549549 | I am more concerned than ever about Trump's ties to Russian banks, especially since Donald has refused to release his tax returns. The hacking situation is alarming but the idea that American banks are not loaning Donald money but Russian banks are is something that needs immediate answers. I don't understand why the main-stream news media & the FBI aren't digging deeper on information that affects the U.S. in such a profound way.
13 | Mary Ramirez | 9 | 1338050206291228_1338107476285501 | Absolutely, it's a serious problem!! Where is Trump's October/November surprise?!!?! Obstructionist that want to prevent Dems from getting into the White House!!! Comey needs to resign!!!!! Loretta Lynch needs to expose the Trump/Russian connection because there is, indeed, one!!!!! Share that with the American public, particularly, since they breached all protocols with Hillary!!!!!
14 | Dmitri Alex Draznilov | 5 | 1338050206291228_1338071722955743 | Of course, Mrs. Clinton didn't do it. It was all beyond her control: the Russkies,  the lunar cycle, the mass alleged gropings of the opponent.  Mrs. Clinton did nothng.  She is clearly a victim of circumstance.
15 | Fred LC | 17 | 1338050206291228_1338057632957152 | Laughable, anyone/anything against Hillary Clinton is a Russian plant/agent, even a guy who was their hero until Friday morning.
16 | Marie Callahan | 10 | 1338050206291228_1338059789623603 | Considering Comey sending his confusing letter of innuendo to Congress, perhaps Trump is right about the election being rigged--in favor of Trump, of course.
17 | Bill Saks | 4 | 1338050206291228_1338071406289108 | Lol . If Loretta Lynch didn't violate appearance of impropriety . And have allow who Obama called the most independent FBi director of our time the keys to be non political on Hillary's email case remember one thing if huma turned over all electronic devices as she swore she did . Hillary wouldn't have had to worry the timing . It's her own fault
18 | Clifford Connors | 3 | 1338050206291228_1428340007180733 | Hillary Clinton broke the law period. She should not be running for president period it's time for her to go to jail . She can't be trusted period.. so let's vote Trump. She would not have this problem if she did not brake the law and lies. It's her problem. She is going to jail. Trump will be president. So you guys can cry all you want. Go Trump will win in a landside. Hell yea baby!!!! Keep crying while Trump goes to the white House baby
19 | Edward J. Johnson | 4 | 1338050206291228_1630832110550647 | Transparency was asked by all, both parties. Now or later transparency is needed for the American people. Of, by, for the people. All Americans required and reserve the right to make decisions that will uplift and promote the best interests of these United States. Let us join together and go forth, forthwith. God bless and bless the United States.
20 | Karen Ullman Marks | 2 | 1338050206291228_1338088782954037 | It certainly looks like Director Comey is being biased. I am sure he is of good character , however, I see a big mistake made in July as well as this past Friday. He said too much in July. He should have given the findings, a brief description as to why the decision was reached and then stop. There was no need for him to editorialize . There was also no need for him to say what he did on Friday, in that letter to the oversight committee, this close to the election. He did not know anything other than finding emails from Huma. Both times he created volatile environments for both political campaigns to deal with.
21 | Kevin Lynch | 6 | 1338050206291228_1338069639622618 | So let me get this straight.  It is too close to an election to discuss how Russia is committing espionage against the US because one candidate has shown himself to be very supportive of the Russian President and it may look negatively upon him that he is participating in this strategy to help him win the election. At the same time, it is perfectly ok to announce that they found some emails on Anthony Weiner's computer that may or may not be relevant to an already closed investigation, despite having no idea what exactly is in the emails since they were prohibited by law from viewing those without a warrant, despite the fact that it may look negative for the other Presidential candidate. Yeah, sure.  That makes perfect sense.
22 | Jacque Fisher Vance-Cheatham | 4 | 1338050206291228_1630805167220008 | I do not trust our Director of Homeland Security. He rubber stamped persons as citizens instead of deportation. Wikileaks told us they did not come from the USSR. They had an operative who worked for the Clinton Campaign that was killed in DC recently.
23 | Marion Rohling | 3 | 1338050206291228_1338062396290009 | Another shyster we the people are paying. Another day of obstructions & lies. Comey & all of the rest of the so called republican party hopefully do NOT get what they deserve, namely a president who would sell his Mother if the price is right, who will not stop until the nation is fractured so badly, that we will not recognize our country anymore, a maniac who could care less what happens to us. If they get their wish, God forbid, the very ones who screamed for violence, who are dragging us through the gutter, will be the first to feel his wrath.
24 | Stanley Davis | 0 | 1338050206291228_1428382617176472 | This guy James Comey has been getting all this praise about his integrity, the way it look he don't have no integrity, but come to find out he didn't want to put out information about Trump and Russia connection, due to the election being so close to the end, but you can put out emails about Clinton, this shows this guy is partisan and trying to tilt the election, he need to resign and put someone their with high moral and standard, who would be fair whether you Democrat or Republican, its all about fairness
25 | Nicole White | 2 | 1338050206291228_1630848457215679 | Why aren't you guys reporting about Brazile being fired for slipping Clinton questions that came up at the debate beforehand? Also watched the last 30 minutes of Meadows show. The whole time it was about Comey and what he did wrong and portraying Clinton as the poor victim. What about that there were people sent to Trumps rally to start fights? What about an RNC office being blown up in North Carolina? Nothing. Let's just keep talking about the poor victim Clinton is. You guys are pathetic.

5 | John Steinbach | 31 | 1338008156295433_1338020336294215 | We ask that ALL Millennials and all Democrats get out and VOTE!  Many States have early voting so you don't have to wait until Nov 8th!

7 | Bill McKetrick | 32 | 1338008156295433_1338032619626320 | So to recap, Donald Trump will go on trial in November for racketeering, and again in December accused of child rape. He is a sexual predator, hasn’t released his tax returns, and has used money from his charitable foundation to pay his legal fees and bribe a state Attorney General not to pursue charges against him. He has abused the family of a war hero, and openly mocked women and a disabled reporter……..but, let’s instead talk about some emails Hillary didn’t send, that are on someone else’s computer…..that weren’t a crime anyway. But, you know what……? Even if Hillary Clinton was trading oral sex and state secrets in the back seat of a stolen Subaru for crack cocaine in a 7-11 parking lot in the Middle East that doubles as an illegal abortion clinic……I would still vote for her over the ‘Cheeto Hitler’ !!
8 | Mary Linderberg | 14 | 1338008156295433_1338009276295321 | White House spokesman Josh Earnest called FBI director James Comey “a man of integrity” and a “man of good character" and refuses to join Democrats saying James Comey broke any laws.     Hillary Clinton has "nobody to blame but herself" for the ongoing issue of how she handled emails when she was secretary of state, her actions were "willful."    Clinton created this mess with her incredibly stupid decision to use a private server as secretary of state, she's only a "victim" caused by her own stupidity.     Valerie Jarrett threw Hillary under the bus when this whole mess started in an interview telling Andrea Mitchell she had given Hillary the SOP manual and told her specifically "no private servers".     Former Clinton Strategist and Pollster Doug Schoen withdraws his support for Hillary Clinton after FBI criminal investigation sparks "constitutional crisis"....     Grab the popcorn kids, can't wait to see who Hillary will "use" to spin this one or go after the FBI for doing their job, Comey is being an honorable man by notifying Congress as he promised on September 28th .... she unfortunately has always had a penchant for digging herself in deeper!    Going all in against the director of the FBI is precarious — especially after Democrats praised his integrity after he initially cleared Hillary Clinton in July.     http://investmentwatchblog.com/its-official-obama-attack-valerie-jarrett-throws-hillary-way-under-the-bus-obama-about-to-reject-a-hillary-presidency/

"CNN never gave Brazile access to any questions, prep material, attendee list, background information or meetings in advance of a town hall or debate. We are completely uncomfortable with what we have learned about her interactions with the Clinton campaign while she was a CNN contributor," said a network spokesperson in a statement.
12 | Annette Kessee | 1 | 1338008156295433_1790788264502428 | Hillary Clinton has adopted 2/3's of Bernie Sanders platform which I feel is generous, so millennials know their guy will have a huge roll in her administration, and they will strive to carry out their platforms. We need to remember that they cannot do it alone. We have to vote BLUE up and down the ticket. Donald Tramp has said minimum wage is too high already, and he's not proposing paying anyone's college tuition.....nuff said!
13 | Tracey Hail Hail | 5 | 1338008156295433_1338024486293800 | Now it's being reported that Comey did not want the report released by the FBI that our intelligence professionals all agreed that Russia was trying to sway the election becuase he didn't want to be seen as interfering with the election.Who else believes that Comey is now being investigated as we type?
14 | Mary Davis | 6 | 1338008156295433_1338026576293591 | Very misleading headline MSNBC. I am disappointed in you. The headline should read "Clinton still holds massive lead among millenials." Please be more mindful about these types of things. No drama. You're better than that.

16 | Warren Murray | 14 | 1338008156295433_1338023016293947 | We have had 8 years of an anti Obama congress and senate, if you want to start blaming somebody for what hasn't been done, blame the party that fought to hinder the man that the majority of Americans voted for, from doing what they elected him to do. I'm sure you won't because you don't have the honesty or integrity to admit it. The gop doesn't care about the will of the people, all they care about is money and power. They created trump the terror and all those who follow him, so now they're getting exactly what they deserve. I'm sure those grapes taste pretty sour by now, enjoy !

18 | Joanne Thompson | 5 | 1338008156295433_1338028709626711 | Please remind everyone that up until now, every Secretary of State has used a private email server. John Kerry is the first one. Where is the blame for the State Department not requiring that they can only set up a server for you?

22 | Steve Hunley | 0 | 1338008156295433_1790718161176105 | Clinton just spoke in Cin, Ohio.Clinton had to talk fast, she has a fundraiser at disbarred lawyer Stan Chesley's house in Indian Hill. He cannot go to Kentucky as there is an arrest warrant for him there. He was involved in a class action suit against Fen-Phen where he and his cronies won many millions for the plaintiffs. Hardly any money was ever paid to victims. He was disbarred and an award for $43 million against him was ordered. He has avoided paying to the point of being in contempt and a warrant for his arrest was issued. Very similar to the Clinton's, people around him received felony convictions, Prison sentences, and some committed suicide. Looks like the Clinton's are going to get some of the $$$$. Birds of a feather!
23 | Candy Clontz | 0 | 1338008156295433_1338048339624748 | The majority of millennial voters are 'children' who were raised in a world where all they've been fed and witness to is political scams not in a world that remembers and is well aware of what political values truly mean. Also, a bunch of feminist voting for her simply because she has a 'cooter'. Sorry, I for one will not vote for a woman who allowed our soldiers to be slaughtered in Benghazi then said "what does it matter." It matters because they're human beings and fought for our country. She has shamed and threatened the women her husband sexually assaulted. She freed a proven guilty child rapist. She denies her husband's illegitimate black son. She put our safety and America at risk with her email scandals. She's used her foundation (more like cartel) made her rich from money collected from countries that treat women and children like nothing. Pay to play... but for get all that she has a cooter!!! SMH!!!

We were called Young Voters in 1990 when I registered, they were called Young voters in every election since then. They're still young voters today.The young vote traditionally has a low turnout. Even when there's a record turnout for Obama the record is far less than the average turnout of those above 35. This poll reflects the apathy of youth, nothing more.

6 | Patrick Henry | 0 | 1337971482965767_1338005139629068 | WARNING, WARNING, WARNING: President Trump and others who belong to the city of God, Jesus the Christ, don't get too excited or too quick to take the bait on the FBI apparently reopening their investigation into Hellary Inc. [This could turn out to be a masterful head fake by the Democrats and others with the mark of the beast/Satan. Remember, when you oppose the Democrat etc., you are opposing people who are inspired and possessed by demons. And demons aren't dumb, even if they are woefully unwise for opposing God. Or are we to believe Comey suddenly realized he's not going to live forever, that the demons, Obama and others with the mark of the beast/Satan can't save him from God's wrath nor do they love him enough to want to save him from God's wrath, and he knows he will have to answer to God, Jesus the Christ for his sins on judgment day, so he has decided to finally put principle/law and order, and over politics and temporal earthly gain? I sure hope so, but we shall see!] If it turns out to be a head fake by the Democrats and others with the mark of the beast/Satan, then it was intended to restore credibility in the FBI by showing they were impartial the whole time, otherwise they wouldn't have reopened their investigation, (they will say), and it will have the added benefit of further solidify Hellary didn't do anything criminal (so they will think). And if the reopening of the criminal is resolved before the election to Hellary's benefit, then my hypothesis is correct. Remember, with Nazi Democrat propagandists it's not about the truth, but creating perception in the minds of the simple minded, non thinking, reprobate Democrats, and lukewarm, cowardly, compromising with evil Republicans. [Remember, the Democrats and others with with the mark of the beast/Satan are masters of demonic inspired Manson girl street skits. These are the same antichrist Democrats etc. who have been conducting a woefully immoral and illegal revolution against God, Jesus the Christ and his chosen, (particularly his chosen of lighter color of the male gender) for over 50 years, and in the last 8 years that revolution has become extremely violent with the aid and comfort of Barry Obama Inc. exploiting the fear, ignorance and demonic nature of their blind, hopeless and helpless followers by constantly igniting, inciting and inspiring that violence against street level law enforcment and our best citizens, this they have deviously done while accusing their opposition of conducting the very violent revolution they are conducting. These are the same antichrist Democrats etc. who in the last 8 years alone have committed billions and billions of criminal acts of domestic terrorism and trillions and trillions of sins against those who oppose their demonic agenda, while blaming their oppostion for their criminal acts and woeful sins they have committed against them. These are the same antichrist Democrats etc. who over the last 50 plus years have immorally and illegally conned and wormed their way into our local, State and Federal government, public schools, institutions, businesses, churches etc. to misuse their temporary power and position and violate their oaths to their office and/or God's laws for the sole purpose of enriching themselves, family and friends at the expense of citizen working man and woman taxpayer, and to persecute, torture and murder God, Jesus the Christ and his chosen. These are the same antichrist Democrats etc. in local, State and Federal govenrment who immorally and illegally funnel billions of taxpayer dollars a year to Democrat Party domestic terrorist hate groups masquerading as social welfare/justice organizations for the sole purpose of enabling them to commit criminal acts and sins against those who oppose their demonic agenda, while only charging and prosecuting a small fraction of their crimes, and never charging and prosecuting the millions raciallly motivated black on person of lighter color hate crimes that have been committed in the last 8 years alone. These are the same antichrist Democrats etc. who will stab you in the back of the head with a knife while accusing you of doing what they just did to you. These are the same antichrist Democrats etc. who since they got their way with Roe vs. Wade, have tortured and murdered over 60 million of our most vulnerable and helpless children, sold many of their body parts for "medical research," while using children as props in their political ads, while constantly claiming they care about women and children. These are the same antichrist Democrats etc. who enthusiastically worked tirelessly for decades to legitimize homosexuality and other forms and fuctions of sexual deviancy (e.g. gender flipping/tampering, genital mutilation, cross dressing, opposite sex pretending/make believing, anyone anytime sexual interaction) in every corner of our society by using junk science studies funded by sexual deviants and their symathizers to justify and rationalize their abominable sin (to gain public acceptance and approval and special rights not written/required in the Constitution) by deviously and unscientifically claiming they're the result their muted, mangled DNA, rather than the fact they are inspired and orginate in their fallen spiritual nature. Then these same antichrist Democrats etc. used the demon inspired junk science/falsehood to bribe, blackmail and intimidate 5 members of the U.S. Supreme Court to give them special access to a marriage license. Then after the unconstitutional and illegitimate ruling, the unrepentant sexual deviants celebrated their woefully evil deeds in defiling God's sacred marriage covenant (that they will have to give an account for to God, Jesus the Christ on judgment day and to pay homage to the demons who inspire and possess them) by tearing off their clothes, oiling up their body cavities, dancing naked through our streets like animals screaming and howling, shaking their fists, stomping their feet, running to and fro, wearing contorted over stretched facial expressions and eyes with a demonic glare, proudly and arrogantly puffed out their chests, beat them like savages playing drums and pointed their fecal and sperm covered fingers and hands towards the heavens and shouted on the top of their lungs, "*uck you God, we know better than you!" These are the same antichrist Democrats etc. who promote the demonic lie that a persons gender is not determined by their God given genitalia, but rather by a persons fanciful imagination in their rebellion against God and his created order. And in promoting their abominable lie they have sacrificed the safety and security of our women and children in their most private, vulnerable moments in business restrooms, and public school bathrooms, locker rooms and showers stalls. I digress] Also, in the FBI reopening its criminal investigation into Hellary Clintons' criminal acts during her tenure as Secretary of State and that of her co-conspirators, it could be an attempt to get a bigger payment in their bungling the investigation or perhaps someone or some people didn't get the payment they were promised when they incorrectly didn't charge and prosecute Hellary Clinton, and her co-conspirators, so it's a power move to get their attention to pay up or else or it could be all the above. We have to wait and see what Comey says on camera or in a written statement within the next 8 days, and then we'll know if their move is genuine or more posturing to help Hellary, and at the same time to restore confidence and credibility in the FBI in the mind of the voting public just before the election. You can play your hand strong if you want, but be careful they could be setting a trap to take the pot. Play tight, and only aggressive if it calls for it on this one.

Or are we to believe Comey suddenly realized he's not going to live forever, that the demons, Obama and others with the mark of the beast/Satan can't save him from God's wrath nor do they love him enough to want to save him from God's wrath, and he knows he will have to answer to God, Jesus the Christ for his sins on judgment day, so he has decided to finally put principle/law and order, and over politics and temporal earthly gain? I sure hope so, but we shall see!] If it turns out to be a head fake by the Democrats and others with the mark of the beast/Satan, then it was intended to restore credibility in the FBI by showing they were impartial the whole time, otherwise they wouldn't have reopened their investigation, (they will say), and it will have the added benefit of further solidify Hellary didn't do anything criminal (so they will think). And if the reopening of the criminal is resolved before the election to Hellary's benefit, then my hypothesis is correct. Remember, with Nazi Democrat propagandists it's not about the truth, but creating perception in the minds of the simple minded, non thinking, reprobate Democrats, and lukewarm, cowardly, compromising with evil Republicans. [Remember, the Democrats and others with with the mark of the beast/Satan are masters of demonic inspired Manson girl street skits. These are the same antichrist Democrats etc. who have been conducting a woefully immoral and illegal revolution against God, Jesus the Christ and his chosen, (particularly his chosen of lighter color of the male gender) for over 50 years, and in the last 8 years that revolution has become extremely violent with the aid and comfort of Barry Obama Inc. exploiting the fear, ignorance and demonic nature of their blind, hopeless and helpless followers by constantly igniting, inciting and inspiring that violence against street level law enforcment and our best citizens, this they have deviously done while accusing their opposition of conducting the very violent revolution they are conducting. These are the same antichrist Democrats etc. who in the last 8 years alone have committed billions and billions of criminal acts of domestic terrorism and trillions and trillions of sins against those who oppose their demonic agenda, while blaming their oppostion for their criminal acts and woeful sins they have committed against them. These are the same antichrist Democrats etc. who over the last 50 plus years have immorally and illegally conned and wormed their way into our local, State and Federal government, public schools, institutions, businesses, churches etc. to misuse their temporary power and position and violate their oaths to their office and/or God's laws for the sole purpose of enriching themselves, family and friends at the expense of citizen working man and woman taxpayer, and to persecute, torture and murder God, Jesus the Christ and his chosen. These are the same antichrist Democrats etc. in local, State and Federal govenrment who immorally and illegally funnel billions of taxpayer dollars a year to Democrat Party domestic terrorist hate groups masquerading as social welfare/justice organizations for the sole purpose of enabling them to commit criminal acts and sins against those who oppose their demonic agenda, while only charging and prosecuting a small fraction of their crimes, and never charging and prosecuting the millions raciallly motivated black on person of lighter color hate crimes that have been committed in the last 8 years alone. These are the same antichrist Democrats etc. who will stab you in the back of the head with a knife while accusing you of doing what they just did to you. These are the same antichrist Democrats etc. who since they got their way with Roe vs. Wade, have tortured and murdered over 60 million of our most vulnerable and helpless children, sold many of their body parts for "medical research," while using children as props in their political ads, while constantly claiming they care about women and children. These are the same antichrist Democrats etc. who enthusiastically worked tirelessly for decades to legitimize homosexuality and other forms and fuctions of sexual deviancy (e.g. gender flipping/tampering, genital mutilation, cross dressing, opposite sex pretending/make believing, anyone anytime sexual interaction) in every corner of our society by using junk science studies funded by sexual deviants and their symathizers to justify and rationalize their abominable sin (to gain public acceptance and approval and special rights not written/required in the Constitution) by deviously and unscientifically claiming they're the result their muted, mangled DNA, rather than the fact they are inspired and orginate in their fallen spiritual nature. Then these same antichrist Democrats etc. used the demon inspired junk science/falsehood to bribe, blackmail and intimidate 5 members of the U.S. Supreme Court to give them special access to a marriage license. Then after the unconstitutional and illegitimate ruling, the unrepentant sexual deviants celebrated their woefully evil deeds in defiling God's sacred marriage covenant (that they will have to give an account for to God, Jesus the Christ on judgment day and to pay homage to the demons who inspire and possess them) by tearing off their clothes, oiling up their body cavities, dancing naked through our streets like animals screaming and howling, shaking their fists, stomping their feet, running to and fro, wearing contorted over stretched facial expressions and eyes with a demonic glare, proudly and arrogantly puffed out their chests, beat them like savages playing drums and pointed their fecal and sperm covered fingers and hands towards the heavens and shouted on the top of their lungs, "*uck you God, we know better than you!" These are the same antichrist Democrats etc. who promote the demonic lie that a persons gender is not determined by their God given genitalia, but rather by a persons fanciful imagination in their rebellion against God and his created order. And in promoting their abominable lie they have sacrificed the safety and security of our women and children in their most private, vulnerable moments in business restrooms, and public school bathrooms, locker rooms and showers stalls. I digress] Also, in the FBI reopening its criminal investigation into Hellary Clintons' criminal acts during her tenure as Secretary of State and that of her co-conspirators, it could be an attempt to get a bigger payment in their bungling the investigation or perhaps someone or some people didn't get the payment they were promised when they incorrectly didn't charge and prosecute Hellary Clinton, and her co-conspirators, so it's a power move to get their attention to pay up or else or it could be all the above. We have to wait and see what Comey says on camera or in a written statement within the next 8 days, and then we'll know if their move is genuine or more posturing to help Hellary, and at the same time to restore confidence and credibility in the FBI in the mind of the voting public just before the election. You can play your hand strong if you want, but be careful they could be setting a trap to take the pot. Play tight, and only aggressive if it calls for it on this one.

You are hands down the best Political reporter out there and you deserve a raise! I just watched your reporting on the double standard of FBI Director Comey's decision to conceal an investigation into Trump former campaign manager and his ties with  Russian mob bosses and it's election target but demanded the release of information surrounding Hillary Clinton and potential email ties with Weiner. This brings question to Director Comey's initial investigation of Hillary Clinton's emails whether or not there were double standard in his findings in that case.

Out of the 650,000 emails found on former congressman Anthony Weiner's laptop, only a small number will likely be related to the probe of Hillary Clinton's private server.

2 | Amy Montgomery | 225 | 1337925292970386_1337930962969819 | FBI Director is a Republican....just saying. Highly suspicious. Media is not reporting every day on Trump's legal issues (rape trial in December, fraud trail in November and 73 other pending cases), yet every day, every hour on the hour we hear about Clinton's emails or the emails of someone else. The six corporations that own the media control what we hear and see. .They are trying to influence this election and we should be sick and tired of it.  Stop talking about the emails.

4 | Andy Charles | 100 | 1337925292970386_1337928086303440 | Why can't democrats accept the fact that their party is beyond corrupt. It's not opinion, that is a factual statement. Hillary Clinton is dirty. The Clinton foundation is illegal. Non-profits get tax breaks for being non-profit. The Clintons should both be indicted for perjury and tax evasion. When are you Idiots going to wake up and stand up to this corruption. Trump has a potty mouth. Deal with it. He's not a bought corrupt politician. Hillary Clinton will be indicted, along with Bill and many other democrats. The lies and cheating are finally catching up. Trump will win.
5 | Peggy Hardt | 35 | 1337925292970386_1337938169635765 | I just listened to the lawyer who is filing charges against Comey for sending the letter to Congress and starting this new scandal. He answered some of my questions, broke it down to simple terms and made a point that everyone needs to hear. Basically....the emails found on Weiner's laptop should be used in HIS investigation and have nothing to do with Hillary. They do not know what is in the emails or who sent/received them. Comey should never have connected these emails to Hillary. He implies these are connected to her personal server; however, without even looking at the emails, how can he know where they originated? If any of them were to/from Hillary, they cannot prove (at this point) which server was used to send/receive them. They didn't even have the search warrant to LOOK at the emails before Comey released this scandalous letter to Congress. So, what Comey did was reckless, calculated and in violation of the Hatch Act. He should be charged with criminal malfeasance. The FBI needs to come forward and denounce his actions and set the record straight, now, before the election. For the media, Trump and his surrogates to announce 'Hillary is under Federal investigation' is a LIE! She is not.

9 | Shane Harness | 12 | 1337925292970386_1337932346303014 | She had a private email server, she knew she wasn't supposed to. The president knew he was emailing to a non government email too. Instead of giving the server to the government when requested, they went thru a process of destroying all her mobile devices and deleting emails, using special software to hide it. Claiming there was no classified emails,but that was her only email, so how did she do that. Not to leave out they plead the 5th and wouldn't give any information to investigators. lol anybody with any intelligence cant argue what is going on here. lol

17 | Nora Strunk | 1 | 1337925292970386_700265040136645 | The biggest problem for everyone is that Clinton chose to have a private server. Clinton deleted emails.

Sort of like when people don't think just like them, and then they verbally attack in the so called name of tolerance. Well here's a clue for you all, she is corrupt. Everybody knows it.

His style of hate-mongering politics makes America look like a third world country. The fact that he is even being considered for president is shameful.

New FBI criminal investigation into Hillary further reinforces the fact she's untrustworthy and unfit to lead this country!
3 | Robert Palmres | 93 | 1337878106308438_1337879446308304 | Emails are not the problems its Trumps big basket of corruption. Im voting Hillary.....I was blowing my nose with trump toilet paper.....better.
4 | Sylvia Queen | 40 | 1337878106308438_1337885852974330 | MSNBC, have you noticed how your viewership is changing? You're becoming competition for FOX. Never thought you'd ever cross over to the dark side. Shame on you!
5 | Jessica Naomi | 43 | 1337878106308438_1337879789641603 | You forgot to count the NY, NJ, Connecticut, Massachusetts Jewish migration to Florida vote, most of whom are women over 65 who are voting for Hillary Clinton in Florida just as they did when they lived i the Blue States, and they are voting in the millions.
6 | Joe Aytch | 18 | 1337878106308438_1337881906308058 | The latest reality is Hillary Clinton utilizes duplicitous tactics to position herself in the white house. Cnn just fired Brazile for feeding the deplorable witch debate questions. Collusion on so many levels. Enough is enough.
7 | Marty Boss | 16 | 1337878106308438_1337889296307319 | Comey admitted she sent classified emails to her private server but called it extremely careless. Anyone else reading this would be in jail.
8 | Tony Pagano | 14 | 1337878106308438_1337890672973848 | CNN has severed ties with Donna Brazile after another leaked email showed the interim DNC chair shared a debate question with Hillary Clinton as reported... Report on this instead!!
9 | Je Deg | 6 | 1337878106308438_1337922832970632 | Dont worry folks after the election when President Hillary Clinton gets proclaimed we will petition to send Trump to ISIS in exchange gor peace, build a wall around his properties.
10 | Phillip Saugar | 7 | 1337878106308438_1337920082970907 | That the same poll numbers from last week. There has been no change or very little effect caused by Comey interfering in the election. In fact you might see some increase for Hillary as this is considered a Dirty Tricks, Trump campaign..
11 | Josephine Blow | 4 | 1337878106308438_1337940296302219 | Early voting is still going on, and, if it's anything like where I am in Florida, it's insanely busy already.  VOTE NOW!We NEED as many Democrats and lefties as possible to get out and vote straight ticket Democratic as early as possible. You can also get a mail-in vote if you can't wait in line.Remember that we got stuck with Bush in 2000 because 538 fewer Democrats voted. The time to find out we were only short a few hundred votes is NOT the day after the election.I'm talking to you, millennials at the coffeehouse and others "too cool" to vote, you have to vote this time. The consequences are more than you want to pay.And you will pay.
12 | Timothy Baker | 7 | 1337878106308438_1337890036307245 | Yea like anyone trust the media. Only thing I would believe from the media about Hillary Clinton is when they finally say America you were right Hillary is lower than crabs on a slug.

This is the media calling LAND-LINE phones asking who are you voting for. How many people still have a house phone compared to 20 years ago? Not many... this "poll" is BS. LOL
15 | Diana Patton Price | 1 | 1337878106308438_1337895442973371 | Just a thought -- I don't want to take a job away from Steve, but he does have his investigation of Chris Christie to fall back on -- I've read that poll companies only call those that voted in the last election. There are a lot of new voters registered. Is it Ethical to keep track of the Early Voting?   I thought it was decided that on Election Day the media would not talk about the vote counts for a certain state, until the polls for that state has closed.  Seems like you all in the Media are intervening with the Election.
16 | Stefano Angel | 2 | 1337878106308438_1337921436304105 | The Trump brand is just like the person, a complete, total, utter trash. devoid of any sense of class, absolutely fraudulent, eminently tacky, and without style. boycott all things trump...ultimately the name and the brand of this dead beat, draft dodging, chicken hawk, tax evading, lying, cheating, philandering, grotesque, parasitic, loose cannon, con artist, nuke loving, climate change denier will be forgotten....erased from mention in the same way as the names of mass murderers and serial killers should never be mentioned. He is evil, vile, beyond contempt, with no business even being considered for the presidency.
17 | Cindy Walsh | 2 | 1337878106308438_1781357538804804 | Come on Florida you can do better than that. To all my fellow senior citizens, if you vote for trump he will do away with medicare, and SS. That's what the republicans have been wanting to do way back when W. was president. So turn out and vote for Hillary. P.S. trump is a child molester/con man/liar/thief/rapist, and so many other things.
18 | Diana Patton Price | 2 | 1337878106308438_1337905832972332 | Oh, Stefan HG, why aren't you keeping up with all of Trumps problems, rape case coming up in December, though it's a civil case, if I had an abused young daughter I would be going after him tooTrump: A Risk Assessment PerspectiveFrom the vantage point of risk assessment, Trump is a disaster."...Trump is completely chaotic at the level of ideology. He is a pathological liar and has no intellectual integrity. He offers virtually no policies and the ones he does offer are impossible and mean-spirited. He is a narcissist who easily manipulated by feeding his ego (see, e.g., Putin’s comments on Trump) and highly hostile to those who challenge him. In his speeches, he encourages violence, racism, riots, and demagoguery. He is best known as a Twitter bully. When we look at his relations with his own family, we see more evidence of pathology. His brother Freddy drank himself to death. He has sued his relatives. He has repeatedly cheated on his wives. In short, there are an endless number of character indictments and no indication that he has the temperament, knowledge and ability to guide a polarized government through complicated times, nor reassure a public that is restless and feeling increasingly psychologically uncertain, vulnerable and ill. As such, the likelihood that a Trump Presidency would be a disaster with potentially catastrophic consequences is essentially undeniable..."https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/theory-knowledge/201603/trump-risk-assessment-perspectiveWhy The New Child Rape Case Filed Against Donald Trump Should Not Be Ignoredhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/lisa-bloom/why-the-new-child-rape-ca_b_10619944.htmlTrump Foundation lacks the certification required for charities that solicit moneyhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-foundation-lacks-the-certification-required-for-charities-that-solicit-money/2016/09/29/7dac6a68-8658-11e6-ac72-a29979381495_story.html

23 | Alec Drake | 3 | 1337878106308438_1337908222972093 | Trump will lose Florida. He is underperforming the Hispanic vote compared to Mitt Romney and he also has no ground game butMitt Romney did. This is the same thing that happened in 2012 when everyone thought Romney would win Florida. Hillary will carry this state and she will get a larger share of the Hispanic vote then Obama.

Regardless of what you might think of Hillary, she is qualified to be our commander in chief.In the other hand, in trump we have a man that is proud of not paying millions in federal taxes a year that are the economic support of our armed forces and now, he wants to be commander in chief of that same military he never supported?As a wife and mother of veterans, I find that disgusting.Please, vote blue this time.

1 | Deborah Brien | 2057 | 1337804146315834_1337805966315652 | This woman has no integrity at all if she actually believes the foolishness she spews.
2 | Valerie Weisenfeld | 1608 | 1337804146315834_1337805919648990 | She apparently lives in the upside down. She must feel such incredible amounts of shame when she's alone.
3 | Jen Travieso | 1332 | 1337804146315834_1337805672982348 | Trump is the biggest mistake the Republicans have made and they will pay for it for years to come.
4 | Carolyn Peterson | 720 | 1337804146315834_1337810002981915 | The DOJ needs to open an investigation into James Comey's involvement in a possible conspiracy with Jason Chaffetz to throw the election. This needs to be done before all the republicans involved have time to destroy the evidence and cover their tracks.
5 | William Toro | 810 | 1337804146315834_1337806546315594 | What I am about to tell you are facts:Only Donald Trump admitted to sexually assaulting women. Only Donald Trump didn't know the military didn't have a court system to deal with rapes in the military. Only Donald Trump talks about knowing more about ISIS than the generals yet he had his daddy buy him 5 deferments from the military to avoid military service. Only Donald Trump has gone bankrupt six times. Only Donald Trump has openly used donations to veterans collected then deposited to his personal and illegal foundation and use that money to pay for lawsuit settlements, but a self portrait, a signed football helmet and "donate" to the Florida attorney general so she wouldn't open and investigation in to the plethora of fraud complaints against his so called trump university. Only Donald Trump has over 200 lawsuits for fraud and racketeering pending in court. Only Donald Trump would have a pro Russian lobbyist as his campaign manager. Only Donald Trump would illegally do business with Iran, Russia and Cuba when it was illegal to do so. Only Donald Trump has zero political experience. Only Donald Trump is despised by the leaders of his own party which will severely limit what he can accomplish if he wins. Only Donald Trump has alienated world leaders. Only Donald Trump wants the proliferation of Nuclear weapons. Only Donald Trump made racist comments about Mexicans, Jews and Muslims. Only Donald Trump publicly made fun of a person with a handicap. Only Donald Trump called for women to be punished if they had an abortion. Only Donald Trump told his supporters to hurt people protesting at his rallies leading to people getting sucker punched as they left. Only Donald Trump has not released his tax returns. Only Donald Trump admitted to not paying federal income taxes. Only Donald Trump has called women fat, pigs and disgusting etc. Only Donald Trump blames the media for publicizing things that come out of his own mouth. Only Donald Trump has said he will support a peaceful transition of power but only if he wins. Only Donald Trump talks about keeping jobs in the US then sends his own company's jobs overseas. Only Donald Trump talks about the importance of improving the state of our economy and then used steel from china and room furniture and accessories from foreign countries to build and furnish his hotels.Should I go on? I still have the pending FBI investigation in to Trumps business dealing and campaign solicitation schemes! 😱
6 | Francine Lachance | 364 | 1337804146315834_1337813809648201 | That is truly funny coming from Kellyanne about her candidate, the pathological liar Donald Trump. Ironically, they are always making statements about Democrats that are really true about Republicans. Campaign strategy: best defense is a good offense.
7 | Gavin Michael Dillon | 314 | 1337804146315834_1337810746315174 | Republicans made a huge mistake with Donald J. Trump. Prayerfully we will reject him come Election Day! Remember it isn't our candidate who brags about sexual assault. #StrongerTogether
8 | Becky Lee Wetzel | 219 | 1337804146315834_1337810902981825 | People are finally seeing what a liar, fake and an evil Narcissist Trump really is .. a scoundrel and a man too dangerous to be our President... everything is coming out on Trump from sex scandals to espionage with Russia talk about traitor to our country for PRESIDENT .. I DON'T THINK SO! Scary really really scary!!!!!!!
9 | Anna Bowe Gonzalez | 168 | 1337804146315834_1337812016315047 | Vote Blue 🇺🇸💙🇺🇸" Clinton’s email habits look positively transparent when compared with the subpoena-dodging, email-hiding, private-server-using George W. Bush administration. Between 2003 and 2009, the Bush White House “lost” 22 million emails. This correspondence included millions of emails written during the darkest period in America’s recent history, when the Bush administration was ginning up support for what turned out to be a disastrous war in Iraq with false claims that the country possessed weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and, later, when it was firing U.S. attorneys for political reasons." Newsweek
10 | Patti Kielty | 84 | 1337804146315834_1337809639648618 | Tomas Davis, what a dumb thin to post. Don't speak on my behalf of what I might or might not be aware of. You don't speak for what "democrats" are aware of, trying get to do so makes you sound like a manipulative tyrant. What I am aware of is that You must not have heard about 911, or the 13+ Benghazi like attacks, 60 people killed, during the Bush administration. Or else you are ignorant and deaf and blind. Oh, and lest we not forget the 22 million emails lost during the investigation of Bush and Cheney.
11 | Maggie Wood | 88 | 1337804146315834_1337814669648115 | It's odd, but as the campaign goes on, Hillary keeps looking younger and more spritely.. ..while Trump and Kellyanne look older and more tired.  Puffy eyes and droopy face.  Too much fast food?   Or the stress of hating and lying from sunrise to midnight?
12 | Sylvia Queen | 59 | 1337804146315834_1337813892981526 | That hooker gets paid to make insane accusations. The funny part is that in her comments, she gave an amazingly accurate description of Trump.
13 | Helen Flood | 58 | 1337804146315834_1143136699108672 | MSNBC! Do your jobs and start talking about facts such as Trump not disclosing his tax returns and allegations of rape of a child! Stop following FOX news and be real journalists!
14 | Kathy Hudspeth | 72 | 1337804146315834_1337811796315069 | See this is what voting for trump will get us, more lies,more cheating and loss of more freedoms, especially health wise and women's rights. How you can make that kind of decision to vote for him and the reps is just appalling..
15 | Lyndon Mickens | 38 | 1337804146315834_1337814136314835 | Joe is a joke just like Trump...Trump goes to court on federal charges of fraud the day after the election for Trump University and in December he goes on trial for rape of a 13 year old...cases on court dockets.....name one case HRC has scheduled for court...I'll wait...
16 | Marilyn Rosa | 33 | 1337804146315834_902144516586776 | Speaking of serial liars! Kellyanne is right in line behind the BIGGEST one~TRUMP. Really, you both let her talk her bs rhetoric & didn't even ask about the anti Semitic comments at one of Trump's rally's this weekend. Pahleese! Having her weigh in on this & asking no other substantial questions about Mr. Paysnotaxes, belittler of woman, and Putin'd bff. Seriously, get it together!
17 | Janet White | 24 | 1337804146315834_902144069920154 | How did Rudy Guiliani know there would be a huge October surprise weeks ago?? This is a Republican conspiracy. Where is the FBI REPORT on Trumps ties to Russia. Supposingly 17 agengies have found a strong connection.
18 | Kathy Keller-Dunkel | 46 | 1337804146315834_1337815146314734 | Ok I have never been so disgusted by Presidential Candidates in my life......and will probably not vote for either one.....but for this woman to go on all these morning shows and act like she is working for Jesus Christ is the biggest joke of all. She is a hypocrite knowing the lies he spews everytime he opens his big mouth. She is just one of the many Stooges he has and they all need immediate Mental Evaluations. Hillary has her own issues and we have all known that for years......but this GOP group is a disgrace.
19 | Carmela Florence | 36 | 1337804146315834_902147653253129 | Kellyanne why are you trying to force Trump down our throats? A man you called VULGAR when you were campaign manager for Cruz. And now we know so much more alarming things about this man. You really don't care about America. You are going to sell us out for what a notch on your belt? I know you are a campaign manager but madam have you no moral fiber?
20 | Carol Parks | 22 | 1337804146315834_902175683250326 | Trump is not going to win the election. I don't know how she can say these things - must be getting paid an awful lot of money.
21 | Christine Zane-Ott | 20 | 1337804146315834_1157345950986714 | OMG the delusional perception of truth. Hillary came it at top of list for truth and had no pants-on-fire. Trump came in at 70% bottom of all the candidates running for President for distortions, lies and pants-On-fire. Worst ever....Bottom dweller....SO whose the serial liar??????
22 | Margaret Falcone | 28 | 1337804146315834_1337817039647878 | This woman will do and say anything to help Trump..WHY?? It certainly is not because she is so stupid as to believe her own lies..IT has to be a money $$$$ deal..Hope she got paid UP FRONT by Trump...
23 | Dar Sebelius Klitzka | 25 | 1337804146315834_1157347210986588 | She made a mistake hitching her wagon to Trump knowing the scum he was, the lies he told, the unethical integrity he had. She knew this because she was on another candidates team before she moved to Trump and saw it first hand. She's not just clueless......she's BRAINDEAD!
24 | Nicole Martell-Nicol | 11 | 1337804146315834_1143123715776637 | I am a reading a book from before 2005, in which Ms. Conway is one to pick up on Republican lies or part truth and runs with them, spinning them negatively especially where it concerns the Clintons. The thing I don't understand is why she isn't called out about the fact that her husband was one of Paula Jones attorneys at the time President Clinton was being impeached, and that she seems to have done pretty well at their expense, as had many of the Clintons other accusers. There is a whole industry that depends on people not looking for the actual truth about the Clintons. Are they perfect, nope, and the have been the first to admit it. If you actually do some research though, many of Mr. Trump's advisors or confidents, at least since he started running for president, have been involved in Anti-Clinton propaganda for decades, and not much of it is legitimate.
25 | Carol Eileen | 18 | 1337804146315834_902146093253285 | You could say the same thing about your boss. It would go like this. “They made a huge mistake by nominating someone they know is a serial liar, has a history of having a casual relationship in regards to having respect for women, and always putting The Donald first.”How's that Kelley

1 | Kirstien Demuth | 337 | 1337751689654413_1337752199654362 | God bless Hillary! The conservative media and corrupt republicans will stop at nothing to try and destroy this woman! They know full well how corrupt, vile, and dishonest Trump is. I pray to God that he will keep Hillary strong and people will not buy into all the lies being spread by conservative controlled medias.
2 | Nana Lee | 205 | 1337751689654413_1337752659654316 | The Hatch Act prohibits FBI officials from using their official authority to influence an election. Reid said that by releasing this information, which he says is not conclusive or pertinent, Comey may have broken the law. Reid referenced a memo from Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates from March of this year that establishes all Justice Department employees, including Comey, are subject to the Hatch Act.
3 | Alec Drake | 160 | 1337751689654413_1337757372987178 | Most people like myself have made up our minds about the emails a long time ago. I was planning on voting for Hillary before and am now more determined then ever to vote for her now. The stakes are too high and I trust Hillary Clinton with the future of this country more then I do Trump. If Trump supporters can overlook all the scandals and issues about him, then I can do the same about Hillary. I also still think she is going to win. If Hillary wins North Carolina, Trump can't win.
4 | Daniel Resto | 117 | 1337751689654413_1337759712986944 | What bothers me the most is the fact that Comey issues a letter that lacks any serious factual information, and three days later hasn't come forward to provide much-needed information.
5 | Raymond Towler | 81 | 1337751689654413_1337757526320496 | 538 has Hillary at 78% to win the election in first polls taken after the Comey letter. People that are voting for Hillary are still voting Hillary. Trump people are still voting Trump. Polls not showing movement in either direction
6 | Gutierrez Ralph | 35 | 1337751689654413_1337755106320738 | Of course it will. I switched parties because in my opinion Trump is worse than Hillary in every way. Unfortunately the media has always focused on e-mails that don't matter and because of this Trump will be president and will reverse allot of Obama's executive actions. Nothing will get done in congress and our standing in the world will shrink to a rising Russia.
7 | Sally Lenz Forness | 28 | 1337751689654413_1337767846319464 | I might care in another election, but Trump is the alternative. Don't give a rat's a@& about emails that may or may not have anything new. Worst case she has to step down and we get Kaine as President. I'll take that any day over Trump/Pence and their hate filled, misogynistic, agenda!
8 | Kimberly Cooper Brown | 16 | 1337751689654413_1337756546320594 | I know all media would love it if the race becomes closer cause you know their ratings depend on it so from now on I don't believe much of what they say without fact checking everything they say I'm so disappointed in MSNBC I used to trust them but after this election there are only a couple of them I still sort of trust. Sad that they have turned into a reality show instead of a trusted news organization
9 | Tony Blackie Clouds | 13 | 1337751689654413_1337762192986696 | The liberal comments here are so blatantly ignorant. Always blaming everything and everybody for the DNC and Hillary's failures. Hillary did this to herself. Don't blame poor timing on political agenda. The FBI do not accomodate felons. What a bunch of morons and losers....
10 | Blair D. Scott Sr. | 18 | 1337751689654413_1337761166320132 | Trump was caught on tape, talking about attacking women, and another tape trying to kiss a woman, and saying something, ignorant on TV, while she stood there with him. Trump, he is a tax dodger, and racist, and yet people like and follow him. But they call Hillary names, and it has been proven, by "Fact Checkers", that Trump lied 80% of the time. Say what you want about Hillary, but remember this, Jim Jones in November 1978, had so many people drink his poison, look what happened to them. By the way, God is on Hillary side....Trump is living proof in 2016, that "Pride Comes Before Destruction", God's Word is true...Trump is Done, Cooked and Finished. More To Come, It Ain't Over, There Is Another Tape !!!
11 | Ig Cherem | 24 | 1337751689654413_1337752339654348 | Only Hillary Clinton was caught lying to congress.Only Hillary Clinton was fired from a job for being unethical.Only Hillary Clinton deleted 30 some thousand emails after she was ordered to hand them over to the Fed.Only Hillary Clinton had that same computer wiped clean by professionals.Only Hillary Clinton got the rapist of a teenage girl off on rape charges then laughed about it.Only Hillary Clinton lied to the American people about Benghazi .Only Hillary Clinton lied to the American people about her emails.Only Hillary Clinton lied about being under sniper fire.Only Hillary Clinton lied about lying to the American people.Only Hillary Clinton was involved in " Cash Cow "Only Hillary Clinton has a long list of scandals.Only Hillary Clinton nationally belittled her husband's sexual harassment ( and rape ) accusers.Only Hillary Clinton is a career politician.Only Hillary Clinton will not release her speeches to Goldman Sachs and other banks.Only Hillary Clinton is tied to Monsanto.Only Hillary Clinton was labeled " Extremely careless " about national security by the FBI !Only Hillary Clinton said she will raise taxes on the middle class.Only Hillary Clinton benefited from the DNC rigging an election !Only Hillary Clinton had to return stolen items from the White House.Only Hillary Clinton said the Benghazi victims parents where lying.Only Hillary Clinton wants you to vote for her based on her gender.Only Hillary Clinton has no real accomplishments after a lifetime in politics.Only Hillary Clinton has never created any jobs.Only Hillary Clinton has been investigated by the FBI and found to have put national security at risk.Only Hillary Clinton has had two or more movies and several documentaries made about her questionable ethics.Only Hillary Clinton was called "Broomstick one" by the SS.Only Hillary Clinton made congress and others spend millions and millions of tax dollars having hearings and investigating her to find that she lied, that would not have been spent if she would of simply told the truth in the first place !

12 | Paul Phillip Tomlin III | 7 | 1337751689654413_1337759449653637 | No, not really. This is just a setback and she'll still be fighting, Hillary is a proven fighter and knows how to deal with these kinds of accusations.That's because she's been doing a lot of this kind of coverup recently. What is coming this week from Wikileaks, Project Vertitas, and all the centipedes out there will shake her campaign to its core.
13 | David Salemi | 9 | 1337751689654413_1337793742983541 | Lol no, we know she's a liar. There is no debating this fact. But, I think anyone with half a brain still knows that crooked Hillary is better than clueless Drumpf. Worse election in history, but still an easy choice, unless you also believe climate change is a Chinese conspiracy.
14 | Tracy Hornschuch | 16 | 1337751689654413_1337803036315945 | I like what my mother said. Hillary deserves a medal after winning next week for withstanding as much as she has since she has announced. There may be a small impact, but I strongly believe this will not cause her to lose. We will win if we get out and vote democratic!
15 | Jim James | 7 | 1337751689654413_1337804029649179 | As has been the case with every attack on Hillary Clinton, this is just one more ridiculous and desperate attack in hopes of getting a dangerous person in Donald Trump elected. A man even the Republicans fear.
16 | Connie Greene | 8 | 1337751689654413_1337791349650447 | I have not watched any news since this news broke. I follow the percentage polls. Silver and Princeton University polls. They are factual and less excitable. My political group provides support and encouragement. Enough of the emails and biased media already. VOTE
17 | Gretchen Cowen | 6 | 1337751689654413_1337798246316424 | Not if you quit spending every waking moment acting like it should when you know it shouldn't! I've been a long time fan, but I'm really sick of you guys and your double standard this year. You've spent at least as much time talking about Hillary's stupid emails as you have all of Trump's scandals put together. You usually give his about one news cycle and they're gone. And you don't talk about the child rape case at all. Seems unfair, yes, but not in the way he's claiming. You guys are doing his job for him!
18 | Pat Pusey | 4 | 1337751689654413_1337773106318938 | Not if the biased media have anything to do with it. She is corrupt to the core. I do not care if Donald Trump called a woman fat. I do not care if he tried to sleep with a woman or if he likes "beautiful" women. I care that he sent a plane to pick up 200 Marines who were stranded after desert storm. I care that he supports our police officers and first responders. I care that he supports guns and standing behind our military. I care that he supports the death penalty and is AGAINST abortion. I care that he supports enforcing immigration laws. I care that he wants to destroy radical Islamic groups. I care that he supports COAL. These are things I care about. Him talking sexually about women does not bother me. Were they mean words? Yes. Were they words spoken in PRIVATE? Yes. Have you ever talked to your friends about the opposite sex in private and said things? I'm positive all of you have. But, News Flash!! Women have been sexualized for centuries!! Jay-Z, Lil' Jon, Lil' Wayne and every single other rapper helped establish that platform, but people are ok with music blasted all over the radio degrading women. Ever heard of Victoria Secret? Or their fashion show? Ever heard of Hooters? People are ok with that too. Until all of these things are different, women will be viewed this way. Your precious Obama couldn't change that and Hillary can't either. I feel sorry for the women Donald has belittled and said terrible things about. But I'm still much more offended by what Hillary Clinton has DONE over what Donald Trump has SAID... PERIOD!!!! So Trump doesn't do well at the debates, maybe he even sounds childish and incapable. But he is speaking the truth! Just because he's not a polished politician like Hilary or Obama doesn't mean he's unqualified to be president. He cares for this country, not growing the size of his pockets. That man has so much money he could never spend it all. He gets NOTHING out of being president! I'm standing for the man accused of saying mean words. I'll never back a woman under four different scandal investigations, possible murder at Benghazi, and the secretive email scandal Clinton's Foundation which has been nothing but lies from the beginning. Trump 2016!!!
19 | Richard Howell | 2 | 1337751689654413_1337790549650527 | The FBI must provide security clearance information to determine if the FBI developers had the rights to interrogate State Department classified information. What is quite apparent to me is the answer will be no. This will put Donald Trump in a precarious position after the election, even if he win, he will be charged and impeached immediately.This seems to be the Republican Plan in order to make way for Pence. Donald Trump is a very sick individual, and anyone who supports this man is as sick as he is. This is all predicated around discrimination against women and non-whites, and control by the want to be “alpha males”, the silver backs, the white men of the United States.There should be a thorough investigation of those involved in attempting to gather information concerning the email issue. To even access classified materials that you have not been approved to access is a violation this includes FBI developers. If you attempt to open a classified email that you are not cleared to see is a violations. To review any of the classified information that you are not cleared for is a violation. To speak about classified information as Donald Trump is doing is a violation of the law.You have these racist white men getting on MSBC and calling people lies and venting their racist view all over MSNBC. What is MSNBC, CNN, FOX attempting to do by allowing the venting racist to spread their lying racist views and attacks on a former President’s wife. MSNBC seems to be so wrap in it rating over the other cable news outlet that it risking creating a race war. The white racist that appeared on MSNBC around 12:00 Noon vented his racist lies, calling another man’s wife lies. If he did this in the present of the husband he would have his head bust open. They seem to forget that she is under the protection of the Secret Service. He claimed that he has seen some of the proof, if so; he will be arrested in the near future for viewing classified materials without the proper security clearance.
20 | Steven Charles | 2 | 1337751689654413_565798120272811 | I am so very disappointed as I see one anchor after another attempting to make a story out of some pretend "hypocrisy of the left", because of previously praising Comey's neutrality!!  Well, he's not being very neutral now, and has done something unprecedented, and possibly unlawful! So should we not say anything, “When the facts change, I change my mind.  What do you do, sir?” . . . - John Maynard Keynes What kind of "journalism", beyond lame, "gotcha" bs, are your reporters exhibiting? Glad to see James Carville blasting Thomas Roberts, as he tried to play that game.... maybe your staff need to take some remedial Journalism classes!
21 | Deborah Metzger | 5 | 1337751689654413_1337789966317252 | Notice no one is asking about the Newsweek piece about DT and his lawyers 'bleaching' and erasing his emails which had been asked for in various trials, from his housing discrimination to holdings in Ft Lauderdale and dealings with tribal casinos- Hard Rock Cafe in Dania Beach Fl...but not much was made of the piece on DT financial dealings and debt with Russia and other bad guys in overseas countries either. Here it is in case you missed it:  http://www.newsweek.com/2016/11/11/donald-trump-companies-destroyed-emails-documents-515120.html
22 | John Austin | 2 | 1337751689654413_1337761312986784 | LOL as Hillary's corrupt, criminal and predatory world she considers life disintegrates into a pile of ash. Time for Hillary to answer for her crimes and to face swift punishment for those crimes.
23 | Rhonda Sheptock | 5 | 1337751689654413_1337804542982461 | Meanwhile Trump is actually going to court for Child Rape and his Fraudulent University that stole millions from hard working Americans, shipping his work off the other countries while touting he wants to make America great, sexually assaulting women for decades, building his businesses with a Chinese steel, hiring US Contractors to architect and build his hotels and then not paying them, bankrupting his businesses and putting people out of work and not providing healthcare benefits for the ones he does have working. And this is all on top of him being a racist, misogynist, hate breeding, war monger who disrespects our veterans and war heroes and makes fun of disabled people! And we can also add that he not only lost 500million on a single year beating the great business man that he is, but found a loophole to then not pay any personal federal income tax for the last 20 years. So he isn't contributing to our schools, fire/police departments, servicemen, veterans, or any other departments that he states he cares so much about!
24 | Carolyn Peterson | 1 | 1337751689654413_1337810119648570 | The DOJ needs to open an investigation into James Comey's involvement in a possible conspiracy with Jason Chaffetz to throw the election. This needs to be done before all the republicans involved have time to destroy the evidence and cover their tracks.
25 | Susie Shelton | 2 | 1337751689654413_709802542501929 | The democrats are going to the polls and voting in high numbers. Voters hate trump. How can the people trust the cable news channels? The FBI cannot be trusted now. We have the Russians and the KGB interfering with our election and the cable news channels want to lie about the Clintons without any facts. Trump has lawsuits in the courts and the cable news channels are defending Comey and blaming Loretta Lynch. Why should the people believe the cable news channels? Get out and vote. Do not let the Russians, the republicans, trump, Comey and the cable news channels suppress the vote. If you are angry with the way the republicans waste the money and abuse their power get out and vote for a democrat congress. Our votes count not the media polls. Vote Democrat. since the Russians and KGB wants trump.

"I fear he has unintentionally and negatively affected public trust in both the Justice Department and the FBI. And he has allowed — again without improper motive — misinformation to be spread by partisans with less pure intentions."

1 | Nana Lee | 251 | 1337688816327367_1337692509660331 | This was no surprise this was a CRIMINAL ACT. Direct violation of the Hatch Act. Chaffetz pushed Comey to incriminate Hillary to directly effect the outcome of this election. This as well as calling for poll monitoring by Trump himself is against the law. Prosecute them all!!!!
2 | Josh Nutt | 252 | 1337688816327367_1337690562993859 | It couldn't be that she is actually a criminal and is going to be held accountable could it? Dems will say anything to protect their corrupt candidate.
3 | Reid Davis | 97 | 1337688816327367_1337698546326394 | Holder is as corrupt as the Clinton's. He was the first Attorney General held in contemp of congress over Fast and Furious, the IRS scandal... the list goes on and on.
4 | Carol Cardwell | 58 | 1337688816327367_1337699062993009 | Not convinced it was unintentional.  If he were a Dem and did something like this to the Republican candidate, can you imagine the howling that would go on?
5 | Susan Haberman Cooke | 48 | 1337688816327367_1337714182991497 | This made me contribute to her campaign. When the opposing party has gotten people in the government to illegally rally against a candidate, the people need to support her.
6 | Janice Muise-Pomerleau | 33 | 1337688816327367_1337699836326265 | They've done that all on their own! Clinton is a public figure and her and her husband have been screwing the American people for 40+ years with their lies, the Clinton Foundation which is funded by countries that hate our guts and would do anything to kill us! They're for themselves, not the American people or for any kind of justice! Holder, you've probably been bought by them too!
7 | Tebkap Pak | 41 | 1337688816327367_1337690036327245 | Hillary Clinton’s $500,000 Bribe to the FBI Came Through Virginia – CONFIRMED!The question we are all thinking of so much time now, is how on earth does Hillary gets away without charges with more than 50 FBI agents assigned to investigate her illegal use of a private email server?It is the wizardry or corruption!But now it has emerged that Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe, a known Clinton insider and former Hillary Clinton campaign chairman, deposed at least $675,000 to the election of the wife of an FBI official doing the Clinton investigation. More so, his political action committee gave $467,500 to the state senate campaign for FBI agent Andrew McCabe’s wife. Just to be clear he has the reputation of a deputy director.Via   ThePoliticalInsiderMore money came to her through the Democratic Party of Virginia:Jill McCabe received an additional $207,788 from the Virginia Democratic Party, the report states, which is heavily influenced by McAuliffe.The money directed by McAuliffe began flowing two months after the FBI investigation into Clinton began in July 2015. Around that time, the candidate’s husband was promoted from running the Washington field office for the FBI to the No. 3 position at the FBI.Within a year, McCabe was promoted to deputy director, the second-highest position in the bureau.[…]The governor’s office claimed the FBI’s McCabe met the governor only once — on March 7, 2015, when McAuliffe persuaded Jill McCabe to run.The 2015 Virginia state Senate run — her first run for public office — was unsuccessful as she lost to the incumbent Republican.McAuliffe “supported Jill McCabe because he believed she would be a good state senator. This is a customary practice for Virginia governors… Any insinuation that his support was tied to anything other than his desire to elect candidates who would help pass his agenda is ridiculous,” a spokesman for the Virginia governor told The Journal.McAuliffe, a long-time D.C. insider, claims that this was simply him supporting fellow Democrats. But McCabe was the third-largest recipient of funds from Common Good VA, the Governor’s PAC. With such few public meetings, the massive size of the contribution is more than a little suspicious.McCabe’s campaign announcement came in March 2015, roughly the same time it was reported that Hillary Clinton illegally used a home email server to transmit classified documents.This is pay-for-play politics at its worse. Hillary Clinton’s team knows how D.C. works, and the Governor of Virginia was willing to do anything to prevent his friend from facing criminal charges. Politics is a dirty business, and there’s no question that McAuliffe was trying to buy favors.

This isn't an endorsement of Trump, but can't we criticize them both at the same time? We need to be objective. We need someone who doesn't destroy 15 devices with hammers in order to not go to jail. We need someone who follows the rules (remember when she said her server was safe?). We need someone that isn't Hillary! #JillNotHill

Weiner is in trouble for naked pictures sent to a 15 year old, at some point he steals a boatload of emails from his wife huma abedin. Now he needs leverage to get out of trouble, so he tells the fbi that he has emails from Hillary saying something really juicy. So if the fbi gets what he promised, he will get some sort of deal for his sexting charges. It has to be something really good for the FBI to go for the deal.

Going all in against the director of the FBI is precarious — especially after Democrats praised his integrity after he initially cleared Hillary Clinton in July.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | J Thomas Gaffney | 81 | 1337636596332589_1337637716332477 | The Democrats and Clinton campaign sensed they were losing the presidential election to Trump so they've devised this scheme to contest the election if they lose, claiming interference too close to the election under provisions of the Hatch Act. And if this doesn’t work, they’ll contest the election claiming Putin and Russia interfered with the U.S. election through Wikileaks. This is all assuming that their massive vote rigging scheme fails to elect Hillary in the first place.
2 | George Gonzalez | 50 | 1337636596332589_1337640579665524 | Democrasts are in war with thriers own Corruption ,Hillary time for You to step down, how is posible she's still Runnig for president under a criminal investigation?
3 | Suzanne Brown | 34 | 1337636596332589_1337662126330036 | I had on a morning show,on MSNBC, but was sickened by the constant harping on the Emails. Dear heaven, do you really want a Trump Presidency. Are your precious ratings more important than the health of this nation. Not one of your reporters in his heart believes Trump is capable of doing the job yet you villify Hillary and make Trump look like a good guy.
4 | Jack Harrington | 17 | 1337636596332589_1337662619663320 | Comey (FBI) is attempting to sabotage HRC's campaign w/ the latest email review. The investigation is not "reopened," the emails on her assistant's laptop are being reviewed and HRC has had nothing to do w/ that. Chaffetz, republican house member hoping to become Speaker of the House SOON, received a note from FBI Comey stating it was a simple review of HRC's assistant's emails. Chaffetz perjured the meaning of the FBI note by immediately going to the media and stating, "The FBI director was 'reopening' the investigation into Hilary Clinton's using personal email server." There is a huge difference between "reviewing" emails on someone else's laptop and "reopening" the investigation that has taken millions of dollars and years to complete. Chaffetz intended to upset the HRC campaign, the white house and all supporters of HRC and to tilt the election in trump's favor. This is treason. Our system really is beginning to crumble right in front of us.
5 | Michael Richmond | 4 | 1337636596332589_1337681919661390 | I believe that we are missing the basic issue. The server has been investigated, it was determined that it was not appropriate but was not criminal. The new issue is that there was a discovery of more emails that may be significant. That discovery could be important  if classified information was sent  What can also be significant if any corespondance would point to a cover up of the destrction of emails/ corespondance. I am a lifelong Democrat and I have no tolerance for any type of cover up or malfeasance. The FBI director was praised and quoted by Mrs. Clinton and other Democrats. He let Congress know, I may have been too quick in my previous testimony. Let us not forget that he was under oath before the Congressional hearing. Let us hope it is nothing but Democrats and Republicans cannot have it both ways.

7 | Jami Ortung | 11 | 1337636596332589_1337648522998063 | Hillary needs to hit trump on his going to trial on rape and fraud charges. She hasn't been charged and Comey's non-specific memo is not a charging document. Stop playing softball!
8 | Nancy Coleman Buglino | 5 | 1337636596332589_1337725019657080 | To be fair, Comey needs to be transparent about Drumpf, Manafort, and others connections to Russian Govt. At least come out and say there is an ongoing FBI investigation.

I’ve watched our country imploding, our public discourse become polluted, our political climate grows ever more corrosive, and wrongly assumed you were to blame.It’s only lately I’ve come to understand that you haven’t manufactured our current national ugliness—you’ve simply revealed it.By saying the irresponsible, mean-spirited, ignorant things you say so freely and so frequently, you’ve given other like-minded people license to do the same. You’ve opened up the floodgates for our corporate sewage to flow fully. People no longer conceal their vile mess, they now revel in it, they broadcast it and retweet it.You’ve made bigotry and racism socially acceptable again and that has been a kind of twisted gift because it’s allowed me to really see people; not as they pretend to be on the surface—but in the very depths of their wounded, weaponized hearts.Over and over as your campaign has persisted, your supporters would tell me that they like you because you “speak your mind”. It wasn’t until recently that I’ve realized that you speak their minds. You’ve given credence to their prejudices and made those prejudices go mainstream.Thanks to the terrible ground you’ve broken, politicians, pastors, friends, and strangers, both in person and on social media now regularly out themselves as hateful, intolerant, and malicious—and they remind me just how close they are to me, just how deep the sickness in us runs, and just how far we have to go together.You’ve emboldened people to be open about things they used to conceal for the sake of decorum, and though it turns my stomach, I know that this is the only way we can move forward; to have that cancerous stuff exposed fully so that it can be dealt with. Our progress as a nation is predicated on authentic dialogue, no matter how brutal and disheartening that dialogue is.In other words, you’ve let us know what we’re really dealing with here and while it’s been rightly disturbing, it’s also been revelatory. That’s the thing about that kind of harsh light: you’re forced to see everything. Beauty and monstrosity equally illuminated.Now don’t get me wrong, I think you’re the least qualified, least knowledgeable Presidential candidate we may ever have had participate this far into the process, and if you somehow were elected I’d fear gravely for the world my children would inherit—should it survive your Presidency at all. I believe you’re reckless, bitter, and completely reprehensible; the very worst kind of bully.But whether you win or lose, you’ve already allowed me the blessing of Truth; about me, about you, about other candidates, about our nation.And in the process you’ve also shown me that I am not alone in resisting you and this ugly thing you’ve revealed about us.You’ve generated an equally loud, equally passionate response to it and this is where I find my hope these days.I find it in those for whom equality isn’t just a cheap buzzword, it’s the most precious of hills to die on.I find it in those people who refuse to be silent in the face of our impending shared regression.I find it in those willing to be bolder in defending the inherent value of all people.I find it in the growing army of those who will not tolerate hatred as a core American value.I find it in those who reject violence as our default response to dissension.I find it in the ever rising voice of people who will not let malice and bitterness represent them in the world.Today I find my hope in those who, like me, will not be complicit in allowing bigotry and intolerance to become a source of national pride, because we’ve seen where that leads.Yes, Mr Trump, you’ve unearthed our hidden sickness and you’ve allowed it to go viral.You brought every awful thing about us out into the open.You will NEVER Get My Vote!Clifford Phillips Jr's Tomahawked
10 | James Ray Amos | 2 | 1337636596332589_1337757922987123 | wishes Director Comey would release some updates on investigations involving Trump, including his Russian connections which might balance his mistaken dumping of innuendoes against Hillary Clinton. Its astonishing that all the issues placed under a republican microscope into Hillary for all these years have not only found nothing but have been proven to just be partisan witch-hunts. None of it makes Trump fit for office or changes the direction the republican policies would take our country. If you're not satisfied with the direction our country is taking, voting for more GOP obstruction doesn't solve that...PEACE!
11 | Josephine Blow | 1 | 1337636596332589_1337960412966874 | Early voting is still going on, and, if it's anything like where I am in Florida, it's insanely busy already.We NEED as many Democrats and lefties as possible to get out and vote straight ticket Democratic as early as possible. You can also get a mail-in vote if you can't wait in line.Remember that we got stuck with Bush in 2000 because 538 fewer Democrats voted. The time to find out we were only short a few hundred votes is NOT the day after the election.I'm talking to you, millennials at the coffeehouse and others "too cool" to vote, you have to vote this time. The consequences are more than you want to pay.And you will pay.
12 | Brian Seligman | 14 | 1337636596332589_1337652139664368 | If she had turned over all of her emails, as she testified under oath she did, then it wouldn't be a problem. Don't shoot the messenger, blame Hillary for her Clinton Lies and the DNC for rigging the primary.
13 | Jim James | 2 | 1337636596332589_1337810179648564 | Even though the Democrats praised him in July for ending the fiasco, he still had to put his "two cents" in by saying several negative things about Hillary at the time. He is a Republican. What do you expect? Fairness? Only if he has no choice.
14 | Shirley Carr | 2 | 1337636596332589_1337773246318924 | Fbi is very quit on the Russian hacking and the trumps involvement with Russia his people involved. Dont want to tip the scales on trump.the director gave so much to the gop and coming out with condemning hillary was the first strike.than going before the gop and giving all the fbi notes.than doing this damage.when they investigated Petraeus they did not do this and that was probably right.but he has bent over backwards to give the gop the benifit.and has blurred the lines of bieng fair..he Claire's hillary and condemned her at the same time and started the eithhunt.
15 | Damon Philip Jones | 3 | 1337636596332589_1337773626318886 | Comey is just a pawn of the white nationalist in congress known as the tea party, it's a shame because I thought he had more integrity than this, it's not much different than what they did in Brazil, he allowed this to happen. The scary part is when you have the FBI involved it's tantamount to a coup attempt.wen the congress turns blue we need to get to the bottom of this
16 | Denise Callaway | 2 | 1337636596332589_1337745656321683 | Yea, well I'm willing to bet if she thought for a minute there was something incriminating there, she wouldn't have called him out and essentially dared him to pony up some evidence. A hand well played if you ask me.
17 | Carmen Arguelles | 3 | 1337636596332589_1337665866329662 | She didn't have to enlist anyone .. people with a brain and eyes see what's going on here.. the rigging is coming from the Republican side.. classic blaming and pointing to others so no one notices it's you doing it.. whoever smelt it dealt it ..and this one stinks
18 | Gwendolyn Robertson | 3 | 1337636596332589_1337829549646627 | Well, that was one thing, and this is a totally different action. What he did was deplorable. He knows better and he did it anyway. He needs to be fired and if the FBI doesn't take action against him then the FBI is no better than he is.
19 | Kathy Terry Hansen | 2 | 1337636596332589_1337732582989657 | Precarious? Not one democrat praised Comey of his ridiculous press conference just to say "no wrong doing", in fact he was criticized for it. He's gone against policy again.
20 | Dawn Knapp | 0 | 1337636596332589_1338283146267934 | Comey sending that letter makes me think of when the World's Fair was going on in Atlanta or was it the Olympics anyhow there was that bombing. Remember the FBI cast aspirations against that one guy. It turned out it wasn't him but it ruined his life. Comey was wrong in making this public. Comey seems to think he's J Edgar Hoover. And if he was afraid of leaks in the FBI , the fact that he can't contain confidential information and the FBI shows that he's not running a very tight ship I would almost say he's careless.
21 | Steven Lualdi | 0 | 1337636596332589_1338156179613964 | ...That's one of the biggest problems with Democrats and Republicans. They'll like anyone or anything so long as it is in their favor but when it isn't -- look out. Partisanship before America is not the way to go but so long as it is useful to keeping Americans divided it will not change. Division is the biggest selling point for politicians such as they...
22 | Richard Howell | 0 | 1337636596332589_1337659819663600 | The references to “Metadata” by the cable news outlets are aimed at confusing the computer illiterates, by making them believe that all information is stored and accessible in the “Metadata”, this is far from the truth. In fact, it is a downright lie and the cable news outlet should be held accountable for spreading propaganda to the public through a series of carefully orchestrated Republicans white men lies.To access “Metadata, which is stored in binary form, a separate “.Net” program would have to be written specifically to the process and information required. This means that someone in the FBI’s IT Department wrote a “.Net” program to access and interrogates “Metadata”. Program Specifications had to be developed, design documents had to be developed, and the program had to be coded and compiled into a “Metadata” file and tested. Who are the FBI Technicians that wrote the programs that accessed “Metadata” of the “.Net” programs used in sending and receiving State Department emails? How long did it take to develop the “.Net” program, what were the final testing results?
23 | Mark Rush | 1 | 1337636596332589_1337668122996103 | This FBI do director broke the rules that were in place and played politics with The Office of The FBI and even admitted to it in writing, so yes The Democrats should force his hand. They should keep the pressure on, because this will make the next FBI Director think twice about doing the same think in the future.

Thats why this nation is a mess.Republicans who cant win on issues will cause more chaos for this nation. Republicans are running this show.Clean House 2016

1 | Bill Hedglin | 95 | 1552029384817086_1552660404753984 | Congratulations media you've sold people on thinking anyone that supports Trump is a racist and uneducated. Keep pandering to your brainwashed zombies
2 | Sam William | 44 | 1552029384817086_1552676758085682 | Trump should be investigated for treason for encouraging Russia to interfere with our election...and by the way when is Trump’s racketeering and fraud case is it b4 or after his rape case of 13 yr old girl ,not to mention the 12 women accusing him of sexual assault.
3 | Selena Ellis | 9 | 1552029384817086_1552696188083739 | Obamacare has not tripled,my daughter has used it 2 two years now. She has 0 premiums, Last year she was diagnosed with cancer,she would have died without Obamacare,She paid nothing out of pocket for treatments. During her treatments she continued to attend Culinary School and continued to volunteer with Meal on Wheels, She is cancer free now and will go to work for Meals on Wheels to give back to the community.  Trump will go to trial in December for the rape of a 13 yr old girl. Trump will go to trial on fraud charges for his Trump University.Trump has 12 women he has groped without their permission. Trump faces 169 trial and courts dates Trump has married two immigrants and wishes to build a wall. He is supporting Russia instead of his own country. He hire immigrants to work for him and imports foreign goods for his hotels. He lacks any record of supporting the American people ,With all this you think he will make a good President. The President's job is like hiring any job position, it requires knowledge and experience,Trump has neither, It requires background check,Trump certainly would not pass it.Thus the reason people feel that Trump supporters may be racist and uneducated.
4 | Angela Gene | 12 | 1552029384817086_1552661694753855 | Just in case you haven't been keeping up this election season this is where we are Just recap with me for a minute: The former first lady and Presidential candidate, who was pushing for nationalized healthcare; whose premiums just tripled; who stole furniture out of the White House and the State Department; who destabilized Libya, making it a "haven for terrorists"; and runs a non-profit slush fund that traffics money from foreign governments is being reinvestigated by the FBI for the casual dissemination of classified information to her chief of staff because her mayoral candidate husband's electronic devices are also being investigated by the FBI for sexting a fifteen year old, and she's being sold as the experienced candidate and the new leader of the free world by the consolidated news media that has donated to her campaign.
5 | Jennifer Baymon | 0 | 1552029384817086_1553277968025561 | Regardless of what you think and feel about Hillary Clinton and her emails and Benghazi and Bill Clinton cheating on her and her defending him, and whatever else, Donald Trump has, what should be, to decent, respectable people, a fatal flaw: Donald Trump brings out the WORST in people. Period. And that is NOT what a good leader should do. A good leader should bring out the BEST in people.You don't see Hillary Clinton supporters putting Trump lookalike dummies in fake electric chairs on their lawns. You don't see Clinton supporters drawing ethnic hate symbols on their bodies, and waving them around on posters and banners and flags and telling American citizens to go back to "their" country as if this country belongs to them. You don't see Clinton supporters threatening to kill Donald Trump. But Trump supporters do this crap all day everyday to Clinton, her supporters, the media and anyone who opposes Trump.Donald Trump's supporter ARE a basket of deplorables and Hillary Clinton should not have had to apologize for saying that. Trump not only condones this horrific behavior, he encourages it. That alone should disqualify him from being a serious candidate for President of the United States and I just can't wrap my brain around how it doesn't. It's sickening. 😔
6 | Cecilia St Laurent Toulouse | 1 | 1552029384817086_1552817104738314 | Mr. Hedglin. If you cared to research you would find out most radio and tv stations are actually owned by the 1%. These are the people affiliated with power all over the world and responsible for the TEA PARTY.  The media has treated Hillary very badly; due to her and her husbands resistance  to this particular sect and not allowing them to do as they please with America . The media has allowed all of us to believe she is dishonest, although she has been cleared of everything they have ever accused her of. DONALD TRUMP on the other hand; they are simply repeating what he says. Using his own words. The ALT-RIGHT counts on you to be too busy to check the facts. And obviously you don't.  Use your head; When the KKK supports a candidate there is a reason for it. When BREITBART supports a candidate there is a reason for it. The 4 people closest to Trump have been making theirs life's mission to destroy Hillary.  Think! why are they so afraid of her?

It would be the most responsible thing to do, if the nation were more important to them than power. And the American news media — fairly identified in the public mind as Mrs. Clinton's political action committee — should begin demanding it." Reporter, John Kass - Chicago Tribune 10-31-16
8 | Dean Felix | 1 | 1552029384817086_1552822424737782 | For those of you who wonder why so many of us are voting for Trump- I think this sums it up pretty good! For What It's Worth Department:                                        The Media just doesn’t get it....they can't believe that people are so angry     that they can no longer be manipulated!  Millions of trump supporters feel this way about Donald J. Trump.....We don't care if the guy swears... or how many times he's been married...or who he voted for, or what his income tax return shows. We want the problems fixed. Yes, he's an egomaniac, but we don't care. We know he's not a racist, or all the other things the liberal media is trying to label him with. We know he's raised a good family, and that says a lot about him.The country is a mess because politicians suck, the Republican Party is two faced & gutless, and illegals are everywhere and Muslims are openly trying to hurt this country and make the civilized world adjust to them. We want it all fixed!We don't care that Trump is crude, we don't care that he has changed positions, we don't care that he fights with Megan Kelly, Rosie O'Donnell, and so many of the elected establishment. We don't care that Rubio, Ryan, the Bush's, and so many other top old and new Republicans refuse to endorse him for their own selfish reasons, and we know what they are. We don't care that he doesn't know the name of some Muslim terrorists, we don't care that he tried some businesses that didn't work out.This country is weak, bankrupt, our enemies are making fun of us, we are being invaded by illegals, we are becoming a nation of victims, where every Tom, Ricardo and Hasid is a special group with special rights to a point where we don't even recognize the country we were born and raised in, AND WE JUST WANT IT FIXED. And TRUMP is the only guy who seems to understand what the people want.We're sick of politicians, sick of the Democratic and Republican Party. We're angry about the Iran deal, the budget, treatment of Israel, military weakness, lobbyists, special interests, overpaid politicians with their self serving bills and back room deals, trade deals, loss of jobs, manipulated economic numbers, businesses fleeing, and even the phony pay for play Clinton Foundation.Americans are no longer going to be fooled, and the movement is out to change the direction we're taking. Trump may not be a saint, but he doesn't have lobbyist money holding him, he doesn't have political correctness restraining him, and all you know is that he has been very successful, a good negotiator, he has built a lot of things, he's flexible, and he's also not a politician. And he says he'll fix it. And we believe him because he is too much of an egotist to be proven wrong or looked at and called a liar.Public service has become elected greed. This may be our only chance to have a non-politician, despite his flaws, try and correct the mess, at least for 4 years. We must take the shot, because the consequences of putting Hillary Clinton in office are frightening. There is a tidal wave happening, and it's going to overcome much of what's happened to this country.

NBC writes  “But Trump's escalation in rhetoric, paired with his longstanding reluctance to denounce extremist supporters, has civil rights groups worried that conditions are becoming dangerous.“This fear is especially pronounced because Trump has cast such a wide net in picking targets, and they often have a racial, ethnic, or religious component. He's regularly made false claims about American Muslims celebrating terrorism or refusing to turn in an attacker and warned that "other communities" — almost invariably cities with large minority populations — are out to steal the election. Recently, Trump told Fox News "illegal immigrants are voting all over the country.""What happens on Nov. 9 is anyone's guess, but some of these trend lines of mainstreaming and broadening bigotry and incidents of violence and hints of a dark conspiracy are very concerning," Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, said in an interview.

2 | Jackson Eggers | 223 | 1337554249674157_1337559083007007 | To the liberals and progressives out there. As you can see it is critical now more than ever that you get out and vote. My take on this new FBI investigation is that it is a political hit piece. It's a plot hatched by embarrassed FBI agents looking for revenge and Republicans trying to gain advantage by any means necessary. Think about it, what do the emails the feds have really say? No one knows because they won't release them. So why release a statement saying basically we are investigating, but we won't tell you what our new evidence is or why it is important. This is the kind of justice and government we can look forward to under President Trump with a Republican majority. They will use the power of government to harass and persecute all their enemies, real and imagined. If you want to fight against Trump and his politics of revenge, then you MUST get out and vote blue all the way down the ticket. You can make a difference.

4 | Ćÿ Herrington | 86 | 1337554249674157_1337570719672510 | Trump has upcoming fraud and child rape trials. Trump tried to do business in Cuba during an embargo. Trump used his charity's money to buy a portrait of himself and pay fines. Trump lied about donating to veterans and 9/11 charities. Trump stiffed sub-contractors out of payment. Trump used illegal Polish immigrants to build Trump Tower. Trump was sued for not renting to black people. Trump "Donated" $25,000 to Florida's Attorney General causing her to drop the investigation into Trump University.Trump bragged about sexual assault. Trump left the State of NJ with an unpaid $25 million tax bill. Trump was found guilty of creating a fake anti-gambling front organization to slander Native American casino competition. Trump has been repeatedly fined for breaking rules related to his operation of casinos. Trump was fined $750,000 by the FTC for failing to disclose his purchases of stock in two companies.The hypocrisy of Trump supporters is too funny and too sad at the same time.
5 | Janay King | 68 | 1337554249674157_1337560673006848 | He has lost his mind!As we run into this final stretch in the 2016 vote, I wanted to make a post that helps to keep people on target since this is such an important election. Let’s think about the recent Brexit vote that is forcing the United Kingdom to exit the European Union, for a moment. In that vote, people made a protest vote against staying in the Union because they didn’t think that it would really happen. The Result, many Millennial Voters desperately want to take their vote back, saying that they were not being serious. In the 1980’s Carter was up by 8 points in the polls, people did not come out to vote because they thought that he had it beat. In the 2000 election, people were not thrilled about Al Gore, thinking that he was too much of a bore, and not a strong candidate. Many Liberals voted for Ralph Nader instead of Al Gore, and handed George Bush Jr. a razor thin victory that resulted in a disastrous 8 years. Listen People, I understand that it really looks like Hillary has this all sewn up. Trust me when I say that she doesn’t. It is not over until the last vote is counted.  She may not be your candidate that you are willing to stand on railroad tracks to get elected, she may not be your perfect choice for President, BUTIf history tells us anything, it is that we should never take anything for granted. This election needs to be won by Hillary Clinton. It is not enough to say that Hillary Needs to be President, but that she needs to win by such a huge margin so we never have to see Trump, or anyone like Trump, on the ballot ever again. We need to retake Congress. We need to vote blue for all Congressmen and Senators so we can retake the House and Senate. We need to put a stop to this crazy Republican right wing insanity that has gripped our government for years because of blind racism and stupidity. Get out there, Vote, get your Friends and Family to vote. Stop the insanity!!!!

9 | Bryan Davis Sr. | 40 | 1337554249674157_1337564819673100 | Trump continues to harp on the one issue that has no real substance with Hillary's email's but Hillary has 101 items to come against Trump with and until election day at her rallies and in the news she needs to constantly remind people that Trump is a child molesting, incest practicing, woman assaulting, abortion punishing, tax evading, handicap bashing, fascist loving, Putin supporting, business destroying, job killing, minority hating racist!!!!! DON'T LET PEOPLE FORGET because he's not letting them forget about those insignificant emails...

12 | Mera Molano Andrea Esthefania | 35 | 1337554249674157_1337556669673915 | It is critical that we dump Trump✖️👞💩🔚However, at this point, if you’re still a supporter of Donald Trump, here’s what you really are: You’re someone who’s cemented your place in history as an individual who we’re all going to look back upon with disgust and shame because you were ignorant enough to support one of the worst presidential candidates in United States history. This is a man who’s: Mocked a man with disabilities. Attacked the parents of a fallen American hero. Belittled POWs and the war record of Sen. John McCain. Lied about how much money he raised for veterans. Called a former Miss Universe “disgusting” and fat, telling his Twitter followers to find her non-existent sex tape. Accused an American-born federal judge of being unfit to do his job because of his Mexican heritage. Likely avoided paying taxes for nearly two decades. Called most Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals, even though that’s not remotely factual. Lied about seeing “thousands and thousands” of Muslims celebrating in New Jersey on 9/11. Lied about getting a letter from the NFL complaining about the debate schedule. Tried to exploit the death of an African American woman in Chicago to say that’s why black voters will support him. Found the “bright side” to tragedies because his poll numbers tend to go up. Settled with the Department of Justice after his company was found guilty of racially discriminating against minorities. Has cheated on at least one wife. Was just discovered on video admitting that he not only tried to cheat on his current wife, but he attempted to do so with another married woman. Had his first wife publicly say that he did nothing when it came to raising their children until they were old enough to talk business. Tweeted that women should have expected to be sexually assaulted when they mixed males and females together in the military. Said he wants to target the families of terrorists. Stated that he wants to ban an entire religion. Praised a Russian president who obviously hates the U.S. and Americans. Encouraged the Russian government to commit espionage against Americans. Insinuated that another Republican’s wife was ugly. Tried to implicate another Republican’s father in JFK’s assassination. Sought out the help of former Fox News CEO Roger Ailes after he was fired following multiple allegations that he had sexually harassed women for years. Made Breitbart’s Steve Bannon one of his top campaign people. Had a former campaign manager abruptly resign after a report came out linking him to pro-Russian groups that were directly trying to undermine U.S. policy in eastern Europe. Called Carly Fiornia ugly. Has said climate change was a hoax created by the Chinese — then denied saying it. Was a leading conspiracy theorist when it came to the racist-driven birther conspiracies against President Obama. Dismissed nearly eight years of accusing the president of not being an American with a less than 30 second statement where he didn’t apologize for any of it. Tried to blame Hillary Clinton for his racism. Re-tweeted anti-African American propaganda created by a white supremacy group. Played dumb about knowing who former Grand Wizard of the KKK David Duke was. Skipped a presidential debate because he was scared of a moderator. Has, on several occasions, suggested he finds his daughter attractive. Called a husband doing things like changing diapers and helping with the children, a man “trying to be the wife.” Has said he wants more countries to have nuclear weapons. Said he can’t release his tax returns because they’re currently being audited — even though the IRS said that’s a lie. Feels he has the right to sexually assault women.!!!!!!!!!

What about Donald Trump, suppose, after the election it is found that he has had sex with over 20 more females, and some may have been even under age, as, rumored. Are you going to allow him to stay in office, hiding behind Bill Clinton. Hugh Hewitt is one big liar.

I’m building a wall.” GOP nominee Donald Trump argued that U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel should recuse himself from cases involving scandal-plagued Trump University. Trump insisted Curiel’s ethnicity means he can’t be an impartial judge in matters involving him because of his immigration policy.“I've had terrible rulings, I've been treated very unfairly. Now, this judge is of Mexican heritage,” Trump began. “I’m building a wall. I’m building a wall.”

Mika and Joe is cartoon charters and Mika talkiping about open invitation, she don't even know how to conduct an interview without Joe and he can't interview, they are both sad. Mika is the biggest sell out of the Democrat party, they both slobbering over Trump.Mika is like an echo chamber, she sit their like a zombie and MSNBC pay her, they need to recoup their money.

Pence defended Comey's decision to notify Congress of the potentially new batch of emails despite top DOJ officials arguing such disclosure of information that lacks substantive detail is not a standing practice, particularly when it could influence an election.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Cheryl Stolle | 195 | 1337534216342827_1337540093008906 | How about revealing info about the FBI investigations of Trump, and the rape allegations. Trump has no business calling anyone other than himself a perv. He is the very definition of the term.
2 | Amara Belle Barksdale | 197 | 1337534216342827_1337536806342568 | Well of course he would defend it, this is a blatant political ploy. But what about trumps skeletons Lola such hypocrites. Now I'm going to make sure I vote on the 8 this is a dirty way to get votes.
3 | Lisa Gobeli | 115 | 1337534216342827_1337548066341442 | Hey Pence how about your orange boy release ALL of his tax returns....oh that's right, he has nothing to hide. Hypocrite and bigly!!!

5 | Jacqueline Parkey | 50 | 1337534216342827_1337550463007869 | Bwahahahaha says the candidates that keep tax returns secret, has two politicalOperatives that has to leave campaign overnight bc of Russian Kremlin ties , so in debt to Chinese and Russian banks, has a trump U racketeering trial in Nov, a child rape case in Dec, currently named (as always, so it has nothing to do with bringing him down) in double digit law suits bc he won't pay his bills, is under FBI investigation for working with Russia to interfere with US elections, double digit sexually assaulted women coming forward after he lied on national tv that he never does  it, asked his campaign staff what a Gold Star family was, and had to cease and desist his illegal charity... you know, the one that he took donations from others and used it for paintings of himself, to pay his legal fees for some of his nearly 4,000 lawsuits against him-some for sexual harassment spanning decades, and a fountain for one of his golf courses. I think Mike Pence should stfu so ppl don't start talking about how republicans in his state refused to reelect him as their governor. He was just that bad.
6 | Eva Capaldi | 49 | 1337534216342827_1337539993008916 | It was just clearly stated on the morning news that the FBI director himself doesn't even know if these emails are significant so if he didn't know they were significant he should've never have said anything until he review them he is getting a lot of heat right now because he has strong something else there and he has no details I know that anything is even significant
7 | Imogene Aldridge Hall | 30 | 1337534216342827_1337534933009422 | Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin brought this all on themselves. It wouldn't be happening 8 days before an election if the two of them had not lied and destroyed/hid evidence.

9 | Ken Myers | 7 | 1337534216342827_1337594766336772 | Just remember: Trump will go on trial in November for accused Racketeering, and again in December accused of child rape. He is a sexual predator, and hasn't released his tax returns, and has used his foundation money to pay his legal fees. So instead lets talk about emails Hillary did not send from someone else's computer. Come on America lets focus. The whole Trump campaign is to get you confused and apathetic, if you stay home you get Trump. The release is timed to save House and Senate members, that is why they released tweets before the letter was received. We must do one thing above all else. That is make sure another Trump never even tries again we must leave no doubt.
10 | Gwendolyn Robertson | 4 | 1337534216342827_1337644799665102 | Six-Pence would say that, because he's a Trumpster-clone with no morals. No one bothered to wait until anything was found, and once Comey made that decision to attack the e-mails, Comey stepped over the line to sway the vote to one candidate against the other. He should be fired. And Trumpster, who didn't wait for a decision, he jumps on his high horse and spews his venom. Now they ALL have EGG on THEIR FACES! Self-serving bunch of hypocrites.
11 | Ali Bomaye | 28 | 1337534216342827_1337539049675677 | We know Trump is racist, rapist and Russian puppet. That is why he won't release his Tax returns. No wonder they want to distract us with Hillary's emails. Even Wikileaks & Russians couldn't find a smoking gun.

13 | Nancy Chavira | 11 | 1337534216342827_1337558766340372 | Remember way back when the republicans said there would be a bombshell coming in October, they knew, don't be fooled! They are just as crooked.
14 | Joshua Sickles | 7 | 1337534216342827_1337552269674355 | A vote for Hillary might very well end up being a vote for Kaine.  So liberals have seen proof that the DNC conspired against their beloved Bernie. They know she has lied to the FBI and the American people. They know she deleted classified emails that was never supposed to of been on the server they was on and before you say they was personal emails just don't, no one goes through the expensive process of bleaching their server to hide non criminal emails it's just common sense. She let Americans die in Benghazi.  She takes money from countries that kills GAYS.  Has anyone heard her condem these countries?  Nope she takes their dirty money.  Then their is wiki leaks but all democrats will say that those emails are made up and not authentic.  Even our own military and police do not support her. If our nations heros don't support her but you do then you might be part of the liberal problem in America. A bunch of easily offended sissy's who want the government to tax the rich more because they can't figure out how to make it on their own without having the government steal it from someone and then give it to you.  Then there is obama care and the disaster that is. She says she wants to fix it.... No you can't fix it or you would of already did it so you can look forward to crazy high premiums that no one can afford.
15 | Raksha Andreassen | 4 | 1337534216342827_1337612293001686 | Your coverage of emails found on Huma Abedin's husband's computer sucks! You fail to mention that FBI knew about the emails while ago and yet they didn't investigate the emails or notify Comey who was stupid to disclose that information 11 days before the election. For all I know these emails were - looked at already - are duplicates- could have been altered by a rogue, right wing FBI agent- or they have nothing to do with Hillary's personal serverMy vote for Hillary remains solid!!!
16 | John Wilson | 7 | 1337534216342827_1337540583008857 | It was not really a surprise,people sort of expected that the 30thousand email would show up, but  we didn't expect it would be the FBI not wikileaks. It really shouldn't have an impact. There are two kind of voters, ones that know she is corrupt and one that knows she is corrupt and will still vote for her.

19 | Tammy Trahan Reeves | 3 | 1337534216342827_1337610446335204 | Apparently, the FBI forgot to visit the Cornell Law Library. Word for word from the Cornell Law Library Former United States Attorney General Michael Mukasey tells MSNBC that not only is Hillary Clinton’s private email server illegal, it “disqualifies” her from holding any federal office. Very specifically points to one federal law, Title 18. Section 2071.So here’s the one law you need to know that should terminate her presidential campaign:For those of us who do not have United States Code committed to memory, here’s what it says:”(a) Whoever willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys, or attempts to do so, or, with intent to do so takes and carries away any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both. (b) Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States. As used in this subsection, the term “office” does not include the office held by any person as a retired officer of the Armed Forces of the United States.”Yes, it explicitly states “shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States.”
20 | Sue Fox | 4 | 1337534216342827_1337561933006722 | It's a violation of the Hatch Act.

Either candidate can not trust him to serve in their administration
21 | Denzil P Walker | 5 | 1337534216342827_1337551466341102 | No matter the personal advantage, at some point in time, some person has to see that Director Comey overstepped his partiality. To sit there, and not acknowledge that, shows the colors of this hypocrite who loves to say, "I'm a Christian, a conservative, and a Republican" in that order. As is often the case, those who love to get on their soapboxes and declare their selective Christianity, are some of the worst hypocrites of whom Christ warned us in his teachings.
22 | Joseph James Mohn | 3 | 1337534216342827_1337564649673117 | Of course the DOJ was against it. They've been protecting Hillary since day 1. Loreta Lynch's secret meeting with Bill Clinton just enforces that known fact.

A bit of the old pot & kettle story.Hillary is a lier ....Dangerous Donald has been caught & verified in many, many lies to the American Public. Hillary is dishonest. ...... Dangerous Donald is being sued for fraud and has been shown to not honor his contracts. Hillary is secretive. ..... Dangerous Donald will not show ANY tax returns, it's non of the People's business. The election is rigged. ..... this latest FBI release may have been orchestrated by the Republicans to do exactly that. On a state & local level the Republicans have been trying to suppress voter registration & turn out. When one looks at Dangerous Donald, it's plainly evident that whatever he claims is bad about Hillary, he, Dangerous Donald, has already participated in similar activities.
24 | Joshua Feind | 1 | 1337534216342827_1337628883000027 | A ****ing never ending circle. When this does not pan out, which it won't, they'll choose another aquaintence or friend of the Clintons and demand their emails. Nothing new and more tax payers money all to beat a dead horse.
25 | Christine Campbell | 1 | 1337534216342827_1337722916323957 | Pence preaches that no one is above the law (Hillary), but it seems to be okay with him that Comey skirts the law.   I guess if it benefits his and his nitwit co-runner's campaign then, hey, let's just massage that law to our liking.

While some believe 'October Surprises' date back to the earliest American elections, it was Henry Kissinger's election-eve promise of peace that began the modern history of the last-minute bombshell. Will FBI Director Comey's email revelation join the ranks?

3 | Matt Smith | 27 | 1336687483094167_1337486643014251 | Revelation? You mean honesty and subjecting Killary Clinton to the proper and yet hopeful punishment she deserves for breaking the law? One can only hope...
4 | Robert Rich | 10 | 1336687483094167_1337486959680886 | To me it looks like the FBI found a missed location as to where the emails were being sent to have the classifications stripped before being turned over in the first part of the open investigation!
5 | Michael Smith | 15 | 1336687483094167_1337492113013704 | At this point why would Hilary still want to be president? If shes elected she will still be under FBI investigation. Plus she will get absolutly nothing she wants done because Republicans will have a majority in Congress and will make her life a living hell. I see her having a stroke in 6 months.
6 | Carin Lynn | 26 | 1336687483094167_1337503769679205 | They can try all they may, but...She is the most qualified, strong, knowledgeable candidate there is! Hillary Clinton 2016!
7 | Robert Scheible | 6 | 1336687483094167_1337523076343941 | "In my communications with you and other top officials in the national security community, it has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government — a foreign interest openly hostile to the United States, which Trump praises at every opportunity," Reid wrote. "The public has a right to know this information... And yet, you continue to resist calls to inform the public." Harry Reid 10/30/16If the allegations against Trump and his campaign are true, but are hidden by the FBI and Trump is elected, Putin will have the ability to blackmail Trump for his entire Presidency. Insist the FBI release the information on Trump's Treason before the election.
8 | JR Campbell | 3 | 1336687483094167_1337524849677097 | Upset, downhearted, and worried about the FBI director 'illegally' putting its fingers on the scales of the election.. Not that it will make a 'huge' difference in the ultimate outcome of the election, but could tip the scales in a few 'swing states', combined with Voter ID suppression, of minorities and college students.. Talk about 'rigging' the election.. From 'gerrymandering' districts, to Voter ID laws, to cutting minority voting locations, cutting out voting inside college campus locations, cutting early voting days, now the FBI director getting unprofessionally, and illegally involved.. Its disturbing.. As has been said, Trump is like a 5th grader, doing a oral book report on a book he never read, unprepared, and unfit, an uncaring, just enough effort to get by.. Like Benghazi, emails, emails, emails, will dominate the next week from the media.. Chris Matthews of CNN might get his wish of a close election.. The media now has a 'topic' to over kill, dwell on, discuss to ridiculous lengths.. The talking heads are in 'mania mode', their heads exploding and hair on fire..
9 | Deborah Brien | 3 | 1336687483094167_1337641759665406 | This has got to stop! I hope all Hillary supports run, not walk, to the voting booths across America. Americans need to boot all obstructionists out of office. Anyone Republican who has come forth with a plan to begin more "hearings" on Clinton if she wins, should be voted out while we still have a chance for a sane, do-SOMETHING presidency. Taxpayer money should not be wasted on witch-hunts. And while I'm at it..... how about boycotting EVERY company that advertises on cable news programs. This includes every one of them. I'm heard enough spin this weekend to need a double-dose of Dramamine. The 24 hour cable news networks need to fill 24 hours, and frankly the "hosts" either repeat ad nauseum or they convolute and fill their questions with innuendo (on both sides). A boycott would send a clear message that Americans are sick of the manipulation.

12 | Donna Straley | 3 | 1336687483094167_1337595773003338 | The "October surprise" is that an FBI director broke the law by releasing a statement full of speculation & innuendo in a deliberate attempt to tilt an election towards his party's candidate. This is an abuse of power on an unprecedented level & is another attack on democracy by Republicans.
13 | Thomas T. Panto | 4 | 1336687483094167_1337512163011699 | THIS is EXACTLY why Americans need democrats leading America.  ACCUSATIONS (''wmd'') are all the republicans have had for decades . .

I mean this is serous stuff what will other nations think of the Americans if we vote someone like Trump , I mean yes Hilary has Email's not sexually assaults , ect ....
25 | Gerald Ott | 1 | 1336687483094167_1337577666338482 | Anthony Weiner’s computer had emails on it? Wow. Who knew? Mine doesn't. I keep my emails in my pocket with loose change. Where do you keep yours? The FBI has had Weiner’s hard drive (pardon the pun) for a long time - long enough to know it contained "emails" which, I think, is what got the Weiner in trouble. Why did Comey sit on this until now? And, no one has reported that Huma actually used the device - or, if so, that she sent a "howdy" (or anything) to HRC. Comey can't get off with a hand slap here. He's delinquent and untimely in his discovery tactics. If Huma posted cat pictures on a FB page and Comely can't figure that out in 15 minutes, he needs to looking for another job.

Following the revelation that the FBI is investigating more emails related to Hillary Clinton, new polls show her barely in the lead.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Ken Odil | 316 | 1337434306352818_1337439453018970 | In July Comey was acting in accordance with Justice Department protocol and procedure. Today it was announced the FBI knew about these emails back in September and didn't do anything about them, never requested a warrant to gain access to them but Comey makes this announcements 11 days before the election and addresses the letter directly to the Republicans and only cc's the Dems. The Republican from Utah tweets out that message before the Dems knew anything about it. Sounds like someone is trying to change the outcome of this election, don't you think?  What I really want to know is when is Comey going to resign and how long will he be spending in prison.
2 | Jeremy Turner | 173 | 1337434306352818_1337435926352656 | Trump is a freaking Republican. They don't have teams. Voting Republican in the USA is like voting for a party that's just at the passing point for the legal system to not be the Nazi Party. She's gonna win. The question is: where do you take this in Congress? Republicans are loss. Republicans are loss. All of that.
3 | Robert Saltzman | 210 | 1337434306352818_1337435719686010 | If anything it invigorated the Clinton campaign. If I haden't voted yet it wouldn't have changed my vote one ioata. If I voted tomorrow or next week I'd still be voting Blue down the ticket...
4 | Linda Dedrick | 119 | 1337434306352818_1337448953018020 | Come on people we just need to VOTE and emails mean nothing don't care what any poll's say we must VOTE that's all we have to do up or down in poll's just VOTE BIG AND BLUE and that racist sexist pig TRUMP can't win. NEVER EVER TRUMP.
5 | Trevor L Stewart Saunders | 81 | 1337434306352818_1337454836350765 | How has it reached a turning point?  You have emails on one hand,  and you have a rapist,  lying racist on the other...who is voting for this man..? This country has really let me down!
6 | Bronia Wroblewska-Potts | 43 | 1337434306352818_1337460949683487 | so now they say barely in the lead.,.tomorrow she will have double digit lead and the day after she will be behind..the media is trying ot keep itself relevant here too so I have no idea who they poll because I and everyone i know has never been called for a poll or asked for our opinion etc.
7 | Lewis Lester | 20 | 1337434306352818_1337467486349500 | Morning Joe are making massive fools of themselves. Mika had à Clinton opinion this morning that was incoherent because she didn't understand what Joe told her say. The panel has given up on forwarding opinions to Joe because he dismisses anything that disputes his recently exaggerated unorthodoxy. He keeps trying position himself as reasonable partisan but in the end he will be faced with a Clinton victory and like 2012 shrug his shoulders.
8 | Earl Franklin Clemons Jr | 46 | 1337434306352818_1337434453019470 | Dems are panicking and then all of their dirty tricks are on full display --- calling names, innuendo, distraction, lying, spinning, excuse creating, blaming, temper tantrums, hissy fits, memory loss/amnesia, blaming others for what they are guilty of, bed wetting, hugging/biting their panic pillows, seeking solstice in safe spaces and OMG just acting like a kindergarten class of whiney 5 year olds ...... It is all the fault of other people or party.
9 | Toni Albin | 17 | 1337434306352818_1337500186346230 | They can call these HRC emails when they were on Huma Abedin's laptop??? I'm beginning to think Comey should be called Crooked Comey! This is a sad time in our history☹️
10 | Chris Wilkie | 27 | 1337434306352818_1337437463019169 | 1. Trump said follow the $..2. The Clinton Foundations largest donor was Saudi Arabia.3. Hillary purposefully set up a private server to store classified info. 4. Her closest advisor Huma is the daughter of a devout Muslim in the Muslim Brotherhood from Saudi Arabia. My prediction of the next Wikileaks drop will be proof that Hillary was selling classified info to the Saudi's by way of Huma.
11 | Josh Thompson | 8 | 1337434306352818_1337474096348839 | Good God... the polling at the moment has very little impact from the email thing - forgetting the YouGov poll showing very little apparent changes, PPP saying they're not detecting much. I expect this lack of context from the Australian press, who don't seem to understand... but MSNBC, really?
12 | Elizabeth Amanda Elgin | 9 | 1337434306352818_704778739687529 | Regardless of what Comey did and why, there is NO WAY there is enough data available in reliable polls at this point to make this headline true.  And you should not underestimate how pissed off Hillary voters are right now and therefore will turn out in droves. If there was any complacency setting in, this turned it around. #NEVERTRUMP
13 | Giovanni Moretti | 21 | 1337434306352818_1337466929682889 | This was a deliberate action on the part of comey to try to derail Hillary's campaign and its working to some extent but we know its a political move ...we wont let trump win #voteblue
14 | Tina Waters | 11 | 1337434306352818_1337543386341910 | Yeah because emails are far more criminal than a child rapist who admits to sexually assaulting women and evades paying taxes.What's actually criminal is the amount of tax dollars they have spent opening and reopening this investigation several times.
15 | Jesse Shilling | 2 | 1337434306352818_1337482756347973 | As somebody who already voted for Bernie Sanders in the general election(live in Vermont). You hill-bots  sound just as desperate as you did back in the primaries. I hope she gets indicted or gets her security clearance stripped and we end up with Tim for the next four years and then we have a real Progressive run against him as the incumbent.

17 | Michael Smith | 2 | 1337434306352818_1337491729680409 | At this point why would Hilary still want to be president? If shes elected she will still be under FBI investigation.

18 | Chris Esry | 2 | 1337434306352818_1337465989682983 | This poll sample 37 percent Democrat, 28 percent Republican and 30 percent independent and only 1 day of the 3 days it was done was after the FBI announcement. I think we may see Trump break the 1980 Ronald Reagan record of 44 states.
19 | Michele Barone Berry | 3 | 1337434306352818_704734786358591 | 22 million Bush Cheney emails missing$9 billion lostWheres the rage?Republican dont investigate themselves. Thats why this nation is a mess.Republicans who cant win on issues will cause more chaos for this nation. Republicans are running this show.Clean House 2016
20 | Marie Jackson | 2 | 1337434306352818_897635543669996 | Newsweek: "Over the course of decades, Donald Trump’s companies have destroyed or hidden thousands of emails, records and documents demanded in official proceedings, often in defiance of court orders." And no tax returns. The FBI should go after that jerk.
21 | Julie Brown | 4 | 1337434306352818_1337533969676185 | The election has been compromised by the FBI. Comey has had a grudge against the Clintons since he was the prosecutor on the White Water investigation way back when Bill Clinton was president. He is totally biased against Hilary Clinton. He is like all misogynistic men who seek to keep their heel in the neck of women in general. He violated the Hatch Act that prohibits Federal employees from interfering in politics. And most especially a presidential election. Don't know if he will be brought up on any charges for this or not. He is a lawyer so perhaps not. It is, to me, a blatant act to defeat the only sane candidate for president. Trump looks like he has some kind of dementia problem he can't remember from one day to the next what he said. So he lies and says he didn't say that. Clear indicators of something very wrong with his brain. Something should happen to Comey that he will not like. Looks like he was paid off by someone to defy the Justice Department in sending this letter to Republicans in the house. He will be out of his cushy job if Hilary is elected. Trump may have paid him big money in a Cayman Islands account for his retirement fund. The Justice Department should look at that possibility.
22 | Lora Lynne Bland | 2 | 1337434306352818_897772690322948 | Vote Blue everyone they think that we are going to give up and let them win the white house and senate but come on blue .. and to all those intelligent independants and republican women this is the kind of rep corrupt that will ruin our rights in this country.. be smart .. especially if you have daughters
23 | Shane Snyder | 1 | 1337434306352818_1337575789672003 | "The best thing would be for Democrats to ask her to step down now. It would be the most responsible thing to do, if the nation were more important to them than power. And the American news media — fairly or not firmly identified in the public mind as Mrs. Clinton's political action committee — should begin demanding it."http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/columnists/kass/ct-hillary-clinton-emails-kass-1030-20161028-column.html
24 | Cecilia St Laurent Toulouse | 1 | 1337434306352818_704812786350791 | In July Comey announced the findings that Hillary was innocent of wrong doing but gave us all his opinion. Due to the fact that he is the FBI Director and supposed to be bi-partisan, that was out of line. We should question why he did that. For who's benefit. And now he pulls this stunt. Obviously he is obligated to do what he can for the right for some reason.  He needs to be fired.
25 | Mark Rush | 1 | 1337434306352818_704743266357743 | I see MSNBC is back at it with these poll scare tactics, well the only poll that counts is the one on November 8,2016. All indications are is that early voting is going very well for Democrats and these are real votes casted.

4 | John Sakelos | 154 | 721651201333241_722877794543915 | Oh Liz, you wannabe Native American -- your little tantrums aren't working. The Democrats are so used to getting away with corruption and murder. Literally. Now that the tables are turning, they are portraying themselves as the victims… Pathetic. I predict it has to do with the Clinton Foundation. If this is the case, Hillary is done. Thank God for Wikileaks, the FBI, and as much as I hate to say it, Anthony Wiener.
5 | Chris Konces | 108 | 721651201333241_722886444543050 | I know it sucks and I'm not trying to rub anyone's face in it, but you Dems should be pissed as hell. Not at Trump, but Hilary Clinton. You put all your faith in someone who you believed in, I get it. But open your eyes...you have been duped by a common criminal. Be pissed,  but be pissed at YOUR candidate who lied to you, and even her own inner circle.
6 | Kyle Sisemore | 90 | 721651201333241_722876471210714 | I think she meant Hillary. Trump isn't the one under investigation again due to her poor choices.

8 | Sandra Marv | 48 | 721651201333241_722881257876902 | I'd rather have a candidate for president that didn't use a properly secured email server than someone who sexually assaults women and children. This vague letter changes nothing. The GOP is on a wild goose chase to try to deflect off their sexual predator of a candidate. I trust Hillary more with emails than I do Trump with the nuclear codes.
9 | Ron Allen | 14 | 721651201333241_722889857876042 | ..."Pay these so-called Trump supporters no mind!,..'Once they get alone behind those polling booths, They'll be voting for Clinton and any other Democrat running"!!...
10 | Carol Ross | 25 | 721651201333241_722881134543581 | I can't agree w/ her enough, as Trumpet besides a lot of other things, is heavily in debt w/ no place this time for somebody to bail him out & pay it for him, so he's after us to do it for him!!!  Talk about a 'CON' artist who's nothing but cheap talk & never keeps his word about anything, let alone ever practices what he preaches!!!!  Don't believe me, just ask Scotland what he did to them!!!  And now he's suing them because he couldn't get his way there like he gets away with in the states!!!!  He's quite a character w/ a 'really' bad history of doing business for the last 30-40 yrs, plus a lot of it w/ the Russians!!!  He even still has a couple of Russian immigrants on his staff, nor is Paul Manafort actually out of the picture!!!!  In fact he lives in Trumpet's beach house in New Jersey!!!
11 | Richard S. Simon | 24 | 721651201333241_722916477873380 | How did this happen to our country?

Unbelievable.
12 | Cody Villeneuve | 13 | 721651201333241_1840270409536752 | Hillary says people under FBI investigation shouldn't qualify to own a gun ....but it's okay for them to run for president?!?Hillary says that Trump's charges thee election is rigged makes him a foolNext sentence out of her crooked smile is saying the FBI & Russia are rigging the election ?!?Elizabeth Warren sold out all her followers the day she indorsed WALL STREETS CANDIDATE
13 | Samantha Hartwell | 56 | 721651201333241_722874891210872 | Is Trump seriously just now realizing his supporters are a bunch of window-licking water heads? Donald, you are talking to the craziest people in the country. You could literally take off your shoe mid-speech, hold it up to your ear, say you’re getting a call from Batman and they would be quiet until you hung up your shoe❗️
14 | Bryan Nugent | 3 | 721651201333241_722905664541128 | Beware Hillary's useful idiots plan:1) Healthcare – Control healthcare and you control the people.2) Poverty – Increase the poverty level as high as possible; poor people are easier to control and will not fight back if you are providing everything for them to live.3) Debt – Increase the debt to an unsustainable level. That way you are able to increase taxes and this will produce more poverty.4) Gun control – Remove people’s ability to defend themselves from the government. That way you are able to create a police state.5) Welfare – Take control of every aspect of people’s lives (food, housing and income).6) Education – Take control of what people read and listen to; take control of what children learn in school.7) Religion – Remove the belief in God from the government and schools.8) Class warfare – Divide the people into the wealthy and the poor. This will cause more discontent and it will be easier to take from (tax) the wealthy with the support of the poor.
15 | Lorraine Ingram Williams | 10 | 721651201333241_722884391209922 | He would still be the same sleazeball. Just president. But president I don't think so. Dump Trump the Trash. He had a rich daddy and the rest he took from other people. Dump Trump.

This is why a loss is allowed on your federal taxes. Morons!!! Do you really think the-IRS would let anyone off without contribution. Hahahahaha
17 | Annie Des | 8 | 721651201333241_1336232239742893 | Sooo... It's not ok for Donald Trump to call Hillary a nasty woman, but Elizabeth Warren can call him a sleazeball? Hypocrite
18 | Tammy Clark Broughton | 3 | 721651201333241_1840474502849676 | To everyone who thinks this is Donald J. Trump's fault ,this crap was going on long before he even decided to run for President ,this is a mess of the DNC's on making and they should have never allowed Clinton to run ,Trump beat out 16 opponents ,and the DNC could only find 2 ? and had to cheat to beat Bernie
19 | John Grzeskiewicz | 2 | 721651201333241_1840416126188847 | That's it...resort to name calling. Haha Trump has put the whole lot of you crooks on notice. Now you don't know what to do. Good for all of you. The American working class are fed up with all of you as well. Good luck finding a job when Trump is elected.
20 | Nola Hennessy | 4 | 721651201333241_722895767875451 | Shouldn't her constituents be embarrassed that she's name-calling instead of behaving like an adult? God help the US Senate (and all Americans) if this is the acceptable standard for US Senators.
21 | Adrienne Cole | 6 | 721651201333241_722895607875467 | If Trump's child rape case, his sexually assaulting women comments, and the billion other things that he's said and done, haven't done him in, no foundation ANYTHING will dampen HRC's chances. If you think so, your just as delusional as Melania.
22 | Mark Malachowski | 1 | 721651201333241_1840302969533496 | The FBI team working on the Weiner child pornograpgy case has had Weiner's laptop that he voluntarily provided the FBI, thus no need for a warrant or subpoena for incidental metadata.. Also the FBI Weiner team briefed Comey and Comey assessed that there was substantial weight towards hillary's espionage to re initiate the case, which was never closed, because there has been no verdict and the statute of limitations has not lapsed.
23 | Aubrey Lydell Johnson | 1 | 721651201333241_1465319503482626 | Seriously what's wrong with folks?!? Why not read a book Instead of listening to Fox News type garbage they put out to manipulate you? So policing Hillary by voting for a Buffon is the answer huh? Just Vote Blue now, read US governing and thank us later.

"Sometimes when you get a lead, whether it's in sports or politics, you start feeling good. You start celebrating too early," President Obama told an audience of young voters.

1 | Ganesh K. Nathan | 177 | 1337142269715355_1337142526381996 | The only real scandal in this election is Trump still refusing to release his tax returns thus keeping voters totally in the dark about his financial affairs & he getting ready for the Trump university fraud trial.Of course he treats women in the most demeaning way
2 | John Sakelos | 97 | 1337142269715355_1337143293048586 | Yupp. Hillary Clinton sure made that mistake this election. The Democrats are so used to getting away with corruption and murder. Literally. Now that the tables are turning, they are portraying themselves as the victims… Pathetic. I predict it has to do with the Clinton Foundation. If this is the case, Hillary is done. Thank God for Wikileaks, the FBI, and as much as I hate to say it, Anthony Wiener.
3 | Columbus Omorisiefe | 45 | 1337142269715355_1337160906380158 | I think President Obama should worry more for himself regarding the FBI investigations about Hillary's emails. I see him getting caught in the web and his reputation going up in smoke...
4 | Bob Caparillo | 41 | 1337142269715355_1337143443048571 | Obama is praying, and praying hard on his rug that he doesn't get caught in the Clinton's second Weiner gate.
5 | Sheila Hollan Gabbard | 41 | 1337142269715355_1337148756381373 | Don't believe the media...Hillary's poll numbers are falling faster than Bill Clinton's pants in an Arkansas trailer park...😂
6 | Chris Esry | 15 | 1337142269715355_1337216253041290 | It's so clear that the corruption goes all the way up to Obama. I can't believe that a small percentage of people are still supporting the Clintons and their corruption. Knowing that they have robbed and  caused the death of thousands of Haitians, Africans and middle eastern people. It's really sick to see Americans support this corruption because they are so blinded by their ideology.
7 | Frank Herbage | 14 | 1337142269715355_1337167556379493 | What some people allege Clinton has done. Does not in any way compare to the things that Trump has actually done. People need to realize that they are being manipulated by the Republican party. Who have lost all sense of decency. The one thing to never lose sight of, is that Trump must never be our President. It would be a total disaster for our country. From the very first day of his primary campaign, he has been a disgrace to our country. He has lived in the gutter all his life, and he has taken our Presidential campaign into it as well. There is a reason that he will lose every state from Maine to N.Carolina, to Penslyvania. This is his home terrritory. But the North East know him for the trash he is. Future generations will curse anyone who voted for him......
8 | Carol Lijoi | 15 | 1337142269715355_1337144699715112 | As to the continued noise of witch hunts. Remember when many said "what if there was a war and no  one went"?  Well for election 2016 - What if the GOP invented a scandal and no one noticed?
9 | Jose Ivan Montoya | 24 | 1337142269715355_1337143716381877 | This is what killerys long experience in politics has come too !!! total melt down of the system FBI corrupted DOJ corrupted Media corrupted Now FBI and the DOJ against each other!!!imagine her in the White House God save America and the world
10 | Eric Hazlett | 6 | 1337142269715355_1337244956371753 | Wikileaks is doing the job the mainstream media refuses to. There is no real journalism anymore, it's all political pandering and propaganda...Wake up people. Stop blaming the source of the information and actually look at the content! Hillary violated the law. She risked National Security because she wanted a private server to hide her communications! She's corrupt to the core and bought and paid for by wall street... You idiots voting for this woman need a major wakeup call.
11 | Kevin Harris | 1 | 1337142269715355_1337459403016975 | I will vote for Hillary Clinton because I believe she is qualified for the job. However, Mrs. Clinton and her staff have no one to point fingers at but themselves.  Clinton's paranoia and need for control led her to this place coupled with her obvious sloppy staff. If Hillary would have followed protocol and used the government server she wouldn't be in this mess. It was not a mistake as Mrs. Clinton says. It was deliberate and willful and now with the Democrats having a chance to seize both houses has been derailed and America has another Congress that will do nothing but say no to the middle class. Thanks Mrs. Clinton for following the advice of your husband.  Find him something to do but keep Bill Clinton out of politics.
12 | Joe Elliott | 2 | 1337142269715355_1337178443045071 | Everyone must go vote for Hillary Clinton our next President of the United States of America under God and Tim Kaine the next Vice President of the United States of America under God and the down ballot absentee, early or on November 8, but Go vote! ( Not on Nov 28 ) Go
13 | Jan Kobus | 8 | 1337142269715355_1337212359708346 | The Clinton campaign is a sinking ship! If by a miracle she did win this election, her first several months would involve her being under investigation and ultimately criminally charged!
14 | Idelisses Medina Torres | 3 | 1337142269715355_1337288453034070 | I wonder if president Obama is embarrassed that, the FBI reopened the Clinton investigation? And now he has to talk through that egg all over his face.
15 | Dwayne Flaherty | 6 | 1337142269715355_1337175916378657 | Obama has been the worst leader this nation has had the misfortune of having. Thankfully in a couple of months he and his administration will be nothing but a horrid memory and Trump can begin fixing the destruction obama has done.
16 | Rob Anthony | 7 | 1337142269715355_1337220673040848 | There is no election November 8th, just the trial of Hillary Clinton.Americans are the jury — and the verdict will be “guilty.” #TRUMP2016🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
17 | Pat Pusey | 0 | 1337142269715355_1337771332985782 | The only reason Hillary has Obama and Michelle campaigning for her is she can not draw the crowds they can. Everyone knows she hated them. Get Real ABC - Biased Media at work.
18 | Joshua Ricker | 4 | 1337142269715355_1337193599710222 | Voting for someone who is under serious FBI investigation and could very likely be charged shortly for crimes against the country is not only irresponsible, illogical and immoral... its just plain dumb.
19 | Cody Villeneuve | 1 | 1337142269715355_1337275513035364 | Under investigation by the FBI in Obama world makes you "the most qualified candidate for president ever" 8 more days until he finds out thats false, it just makes you a criminal
20 | Judie O'Hara Creath | 0 | 1337142269715355_1338277636268485 | Eric Holder: Was protected by Pres. Obama over FAST & FURIOUS. Comey is continuing an on going investigation with new leads.The issue is NOT who or how the emails were exposed but WHAT IS IN THE EMAILS. Our National SECURITY and Hillary's handling of National SECURITY IS THE ISSUE.
21 | George Pauls | 3 | 1337142269715355_1337164589713123 | Hey Obama! When are you going to keep your promises to the Standing Rock Sioux Nation and the rest of the Native Americans that you said you would support? Keeping your word is more important than politics and right now you are looking like a liarSo if you can't keep this promise then the rest of your words are as meaningless as Clinton or Trumps - nice legacy you are building
22 | Patricia Watkins | 0 | 1337142269715355_1338339232928992 | That's right... no matter what the polls say....just get out and vote!  I would love to see Hillary win by a landslide... but I would hate it if she lost by a small margin, because too many took it for granted that she would win.
23 | Donna Wright | 1 | 1337142269715355_1337546396341609 | It was up to each state to participate in the part of ACA that would have helped her. Florida, like my state of Idaho, preferred to make a politic statement against Obama and not adopt this part of Obamacare, leaving her with no options. These states care less about their people and more about keeping huge corporations and insurance lobbyists happy. If you want it to change, you need a different governor and state legislature.
24 | Beulah C. Oldham | 0 | 1337142269715355_1337940189635563 | It was not so long ago that we could not vote. I remember a story from my great uncle. When he first voted, he and all the other African Americans in my small town voted at the same time. They approached the voting place with the men wearing their black derby hats, nicely starched crisp white dress shirts and black pants and the ladies with their hats and Sunday go meeting dresses. YOU would have thought they were having a church homecoming. The feeling of pride was in the air but that was short lived because the feeling of intimidation was present. They voted with no real problem but the fear was hot and heavy. He said by the time they were all through they had sweated their shirts to ringing water; but, the whole story is they voted. I know you have stories from your elders who spoke of their experiences. Please do not let the church homecoming feeling die because you did not vote.
25 | Michael Richardson | 7 | 1337142269715355_1337149503047965 | Please just go away, you have cost us so much. I let go of 77% of my people under your stupid pen and phone crap. I do not beleive I would have ever comented about a president of the United States this way but I feel you are a trater, are out to do somthing bad and use smoke and mirrors to make some feel good. I am sick and tired of seeing and hearing you speak, again, please go away!

Your not happy unless your telling others what to do.   We'll do what we want, so sit down and shut the h up.   Halloween is so you can express yourself however you want if you don't like it lock yourself in you liberal safe space and don't go out on the 31st.
2 | Ricky Taylor | 39 | 1187195981355640_1189589417782963 | What kind of person sends trouble makers to another candidates rally for the sole purpose of causing trouble? Hillary is pure scum!!!!
3 | Pat Fagan Reiser | 9 | 1187195981355640_1189607994447772 | I'm wondering why MSNBC has had Trump rallies and speeches on all weekend (along with CNN). You should have pulled in Andrea Mitchell for interviews and commentary, she would just about have finished off any respect your network has left for me...if it weren't for Rachel and Lawrence, I would have just given up and turned off the tv.
4 | Patrick Michael | 6 | 1187195981355640_1189600337781871 | I remember there was a guy classmate of mine in 5th grade that chose to dress up as a girl for Halloween. The entire class laughed at him and he ended up crying in the bathroom and went home early because he was so embarrassed. Sadly I was in on laughing at him but now I could care less. If you're an adult who cares how another person lives their lives, congratulations, you have the same mindset as children except a lot more hateful.

23 | Bobby McKinley | 0 | 1187195981355640_1189591521116086 | I'm certain that I will get alot of backlash and negative feedback for what I'm about to say, but it has to be said.Throughout this entire election process there has been alot of casualties cause in part by the Media and some self inflicted. One in particular is Bill Clinton, Bill Clinton prior to Hill/Billarys stubborn attempt to become the 45th PotUSA was in my opinion going to go down in history as one of the three greatest President's ever. The first being George Washington for fighting to give us this great country. The second being John F Kennedy for defending our great nation without even having to fire a shot by staring down the Russian's as they were moving into Cuba. The third being Bill Clinton for giving us economic growth after being seated with a declining economic which projected us into a semi recession caused by George W Bush Sr. I am fully aware of Bill's infidelities while in office, but at the time of what was going on with the economy and the lack of jobs when he stepped into the White House and the way he grab the bull by the horns and detoured our economy from going into a full fledged recession was greatly shadowed by his later indiscretion. Since Hill/Billary made the decision to run for office, she had to know what this was going to do to Bill's dignity(or what he had left) and how it was going to smash and dedicate all over her own husbands legacy without any regard to what or how it was going to affect him. Here lately everytime I see him on TV, he comes off a being an abused dog with his tale between his leg's suffering from dementia. Sad that she would even sacrifice her own family member (husband) to feed her sick delusion of becoming the next PotUSA.
24 | Scott Rodriguez | 2 | 1187195981355640_1189630204445551 | Jeez...why you gotta ruin Halloween by injecting sexuality MSNBC?
25 | John Matthews | 1 | 1187195981355640_1189628851112353 | So the guy who cross dressed for Halloween one time and never looked back is going to tell us how to be a mental case just like him?

1 | Tom Lockyer | 119 | 1337071473055768_1337075466388702 | If Hillary wins. Kiss your healthcare good bye because you wont be able to afford it, Good chance of kissing your job good bye when she starts TPP and opens the borders. Kiss your safety good buy when she allows 500k people in the country from the middle east. Kiss your family and friends good bye when she send them to the middle east to die. After all you didn't think the middle east gave her 25 million dollars out of the kindness of their hearts.
2 | Grady Musick | 186 | 1337071473055768_1337074266388822 | Says 5 women who were incapable of raising decent kids.
3 | Janell Thompson | 50 | 1337071473055768_1337082139721368 | Guns did not kill their sons , bad raising & bad people killed them. If they couldn`t have gotten a gun they would have used another weapon.
4 | Susan Sobel-Stevens | 54 | 1337071473055768_1337084363054479 | Mr. Trump has the support of families whose children were murdered by illegal aliens. Although I sympathize with Ms. Carr in losing her son, he was a criminal. Hillary has to scrape the bottom of the barrel.
5 | Matt Cordel | 38 | 1337071473055768_1337080606388188 | Is this an endorsement? I mean she raised a Hoodlum..... why is she now qualified to give political opinions on a national forum and we're expected to take this seriously? It's like when Kid Rock or Ted Nuggent start debating politics. This is why we're circling the drain.
6 | Frank Lewis | 11 | 1337071473055768_1337109083052007 | if Trump wins ,there will be incoming and outgoing nukes ,so you don't have to worry about health care or anything else,and this will happen if this fanatic wins.
7 | Diane Marie Wargo | 15 | 1337071473055768_1337094289720153 | Hillary represents a globalist cabal that wants to start a war in Russia. Hillary will get all of our kids killed. She also will do nothing to stop the mafia Heroin trade. So evil. Never!
8 | MaryAnne Kilgore | 7 | 1337071473055768_1337128819716700 | grady musick you have no idea what you're talking about.

Clinton has lived as a self-serving dirty scandalous person ------ Hillary and Bill thought with the history for our country protecting ex presidents - that they had a get of jail free card..... No Limits to the laws they could break --- Well they tested the limits and now --- FBI is gonna get their measurements for jail uniforms.
12 | George Bell | 3 | 1337071473055768_1337092003053715 | Hilary's game plan with supporters like this or Bill's Obamacare goof. This is what happens. 2 weeks ago 14 point lead 1 week ago 10 point leadToday 1 point lead These polls and possible outcomes are all part of the game. This game is the same as Carter-Reagan with its polls collapse for the given candidate, in a different time frame. Hmmmm
13 | Joe Doodian | 4 | 1337071473055768_1337109406385308 | A former top FBI official blasted Hillary and Bill Clinton on Sunday as the heads of an influence-peddling "crime family" rife with corruption and deceit.James Kallstrom, the head of the FBI's New York City office in the mid-90s, said the bureau's reopening of its probe into Clinton's private email server confirmed that the former secretary of state was never subject to a "real investigation" in the first place."The Clintons, that's a crime family. It's like organized crime. The Clinton Foundation is a cesspool ... It's just outrageous how Hillary Clinton sold her office for money. She's a pathological liar," Kallstrom railed

If these black women truly wanted to make a difference they wouldn't be supporting someone that called their dead sons "Super Predators". Talk about ignorance at the highest level!

You put all your faith in someone who you believed in, I get it. But open your eyes...you have been duped by a common criminal. Be pissed,  but be pissed at YOUR candidate who lied to you, and even her own inner circle. (Copied from another post)
16 | Carol Baloglu | 1 | 1337071473055768_1337674466328802 | I am sick and tired of hearing this rhetoric... When a mother loses a child it is disgusting for anyone to place the blame solely on the mother's shoulders and the way she raised him/ her. A loss is a loss and regardless of your political leaning it is perverse to post something like this. 'Let he who has never sinned, cast the first stone'

22 | Belinda Tanner | 3 | 1337071473055768_1337079873054928 | FBI Director James Comey caught admitting he knew his letter would create a “misleading impression”“Even as FBI Director James Comey was sending a letter to Congress that he knew would become public, he also privately sent a different letter to members of his own staff. Hours later, now that Comey’s public letter has been exposed as intentionally misleading and has created a firestorm of public and legal backlash against him that will almost certainly cost him his job, it turns out Comey privately admitted that he was fully aware his public letter would mislead the public.”Comey’s letter sent to Congress created the false impression that the FBI was reopening its long-ago-finished investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails, for which she has already been fully exonerated. Comey made a point of failing to admit that this new investigation is actually into the behavior of former Congressman Anthony Weiner, which the media subsequently dug up on its own. Now that CNN is calling on Comey to resign from the FBI, and MSNBC is outright accusing him of intentionally trying to rig a Presidential election, his private letter to FBI employees essentially serves as a confession of guilt.“Given that we don’t know the significance of this newly discovered collection of emails, I don’t want to create a misleading impression,” James Comey wrote in a private letter to his staff just before he released his public letter. “In trying to strike that balance, in a brief letter and in the middle of the election season, there is significant risk of being misunderstood.”In so doing, FBI Director James Comey admitted in his own words that he was fully aware that “a brief letter and in the middle of the election season” would likely cause the “misleading impression” he had referenced. This now leaves Comey no ground for claiming that he didn’t know his letter to Congress would sabotage the Presidential election. This hands House Democrats the smoking gun they’ve been looking for, in terms of forcing out of office.

Eric Garner didn't make the cut because he wasn't shot. Sad part is Eric Garner was the one who was only selling untaxed cigarettes, his daughter is not supporting Hillary. They chose Michael Brown to use, a thug who had just committed strong armed robbery attacked a cop and tried to take his gun and died because the cop was defending himself. But Eric Garner was the one who didn't fit Hillarys criteria
