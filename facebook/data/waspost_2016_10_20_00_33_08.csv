Questioned directly as to whether he would accept the outcome should Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton prevail on Nov. 8, Trump demurred. ‚ÄúI will keep you in suspense,‚Äù the Republican nominee said. Clinton called Trump‚Äôs answer ‚Äúhorrifying,‚Äù saying he was ‚Äútalking down our democracy.‚Äù

1 | Charlie Cross | 10154747192994729_10154747229634729 | The fact that this needs to be repeatedly stated is insulting to our nation and this election. America please show the world you cannot be conned by this absolute buffoon!
2 | Nikki Roberts Venter | 10154747192994729_10154747220139729 | Questioned directly, Hillary clearly confirmed that she supports being able to kill a 9 month old baby in the womb on the day of its birth. There's a headline for you.
3 | Marcy Sanders Heath | 10154747192994729_10154747288069729 | Considering that the Democrats raise the dead to cast votes, I wouldn't commit to accepting election results either. Voter fraud is reality regardless if you choose to float out of your bubble to believe it or not.

5 | Claude Barreto | 10154747192994729_10154747298319729 | I am starting to think Trump is right. The elections are rigged. Republicans shouldn't even go out and vote on November 28. What's the point? It's rigged!
6 | Sally Scott | 10154747192994729_10154747312869729 | What disturbs me, here in Australia, is the deep divisions there in the United States re the politics, as it is throughout the Western  World  with our Governments and our outlooks re Democracy. Regardless who wins officially for this run to the White House, the balance of this precious thing we call Democracy, won't happen in my lifetime!!üåé
7 | Bilge Tombakoglu | 10154747192994729_10154747231619729 | Trump did great! He can say anything he wants at least he is not blaming Putin like nasty. Crook Hillary- Hillary and Soros definitely have a plan for going against to war to Russia- blaming Putin for hacking her emails :-) will create world war III- just the way you want- as all you know Russia getting ready in Middle East, so far they open eight airbases and deployed military forces!!
8 | Bella Dina | 10154747192994729_10154747237974729 | "Nasty woman" about summed up Trump's Presidential race? There is no place in our country for this person in leadership!

13 | Rebecca Laskey | 10154747192994729_10154747298654729 | HARVARD HAS BROKEN A 128-YEAR OF VOTING REPUBLICAN, BECAUSE OF TRUMP!Dear Members and Alumni,In every presidential election since 1888, the members and Executive Board of the Harvard Republican Club have gathered to discuss, debate, and eventually endorse the standard-bearer of our party. But for the first time in 128 years, we, the oldest College Republicans chapter in the nation, will not be endorsing the Republican nominee.Donald Trump holds views that are antithetical to our values not only as Republicans, but as Americans. The rhetoric he espouses ‚Äìfrom racist slander to misogynistic taunts‚Äì is not consistent with our conservative principles, and his repeated mocking of the disabled and belittling of the sacrifices made by prisoners of war, Gold Star families, and Purple Heart recipients is not only bad politics, but absurdly cruel.If enacted, Donald Trump‚Äôs platform would endanger our security both at home and abroad. Domestically, his protectionist trade policies and draconian immigration restrictions would enlarge our federal deficit, raise prices for consumers, and throw our economy back into recession. Trump‚Äôs global outlook, steeped in isolationism, is considerably out-of-step with the traditional Republican stance as well. The flippancy with which he is willing to abdicate the United States‚Äô responsibility to lead is alarming. Calling for the US‚Äô withdrawal from NATO and actively endorsing nuclear proliferation, Donald Trump‚Äôs foreign policy would wreak havoc on the established world order which has held aggressive foreign powers in check since World War II.Perhaps most importantly, however, Donald Trump simply does not possess the temperament and character necessary to lead the United States through an increasingly perilous world. The last week should have made obvious to all what has been obvious to most for more than a year. In response to any slight ‚Äìperceived or real‚Äì Donald Trump lashes out viciously and irresponsibly. In Trump‚Äôs eyes, disagreement with his actions or his policies warrants incessant name calling and derision: stupid, lying, fat, ugly, weak, failing, idiot ‚Äìand that‚Äôs just his ‚Äúfellow‚Äù Republicans.He isn‚Äôt eschewing political correctness. He is eschewing basic human decency.Donald Trump, despite spending more than a year on the campaign trail, has either refused or been unable to educate himself on issues that matter most to Americans like us. He speaks only in platitudes, about greatness, success, and winning. Time and time again, Trump has demonstrated his complete lack of knowledge on critical matters, meandering from position to position over the course of the election. When confronted about these frequent reversals, Trump lies in a manner more brazen and shameless than anything politics has ever seen.Millions of people across the country are feeling despondent. Their hours have been cut, wages slashed, jobs even shipped overseas. But Donald Trump doesn‚Äôt have a plan to fix that. He has a plan to exploit that.Donald Trump is a threat to the survival of the Republic. His authoritarian tendencies and flirtations with fascism are unparalleled in the history of our democracy. He hopes to divide us by race, by class, and by religion, instilling enough fear and anxiety to propel himself to the White House. He is looking to to pit neighbor against neighbor, friend against friend, American against American. We will not stand for this vitriolic rhetoric that is poisoning our country and our children. President Reagan called on us to maintain this, our shining city on a hill. He called on us to maintain freedom abroad by keeping a strong presence in the world. He called on us to maintain liberty at home by upholding the democratic process and respecting our opponents. He called on us to maintain decency in our hearts by loving our neighbor.He would be ashamed of Donald Trump. We are too. This fall, we will instead focus our efforts on reclaiming the Republican Party from those who have done it considerable harm, campaigning for candidates who will uphold the conservative principles that have defined the Republican Party for generations. We will work to ensure both chambers of Congress remain in Republican hands, continuing to protect against executive overreach regardless of who wins the election this November.We call on our party‚Äôs elected leaders to renounce their support of Donald Trump, and urge our fellow College Republicans to join us in condemning and withholding their endorsement from this dangerous man. The conservative movement in America should not and will not go quietly into the night.A longtime student of American democracy, Alexis de Tocqueville once said, ‚ÄúAmerica is great because she is good. If America ceases to be good, America will cease to be great.‚Äù De Tocqueville believed in the United States. Americans are a decent people. We work hard, protect our own, and look out for one another in times of need, regardless of the color of our skin, the God we worship, or our party registration. Donald Trump may not believe in that America, but we do. And that America will never cease to be great.HILLARY CLINTON CANNOT TAKE AWAY SECOND AMENDMENT GUN RIGHTS WITHOUT APPROVAL OF CONGRESS.  HILLARY DOES NOT WANT TO ABOLISH YOUR 2ND AMENDMENT.  ANOTHER TRUMP LIE.AMERICA IS ALREADY GOOD AND WE ARE BETTER THAN DONALD TRUMP!REGISTER AND VOTE BLUE UP AND DOWN THE BALLOT.1st DEBATE ~ EPIC FAILURE ON DONALD TRUMP‚ÄôS PART!  AND THIS GUY WANTS TO BE PRESIDENT???  I DON‚ÄôT THINK SO!  HILLARY CLEARLY WON THE DEBATE, HANDS DOWN!!!#NeverTrumPutin#NoTaxesNoVote#NeverTrumpPence
14 | George B. Feist | 10154747192994729_10154747286894729 | I WONT COMMIT EITHER UNTIL WE ARE SURE THERE IS NO CRIMINAL TAMPERING OF VOTES...LIKE IN FLORIDA WITH GORE...DEAD PEOPLE VOTING.... I REMEMBER SEEING A VIDEO WHERE ONE WOMAN SAID SHE TOOK THE BALLOTS OF HER FRIENDS AND FILLED THEM OUT FOR THEM....WHERE DID SHE GET THE BALLOTS AT THE HOME FOR ALZHEIMER PATIENTS.?
15 | Henrik Ahlm | 10154747192994729_10154747228194729 | Trump is loosing Texas. He lost Georgia yesterdsy before noon. He ain't a real cowboy and don't understand Americans with a Latin American background. Uncontrolled Emotional outbourst have been Trumps downfall - the puppets downfall! The chicken let Vegas quickly. He has imploded. Trump faced the final curtain - that's for certain! Halleluja Halleluja
16 | Paul David Menser | 10154747192994729_10154747237079729 | Other than his inbred waterhead core constituency, no one is going to care what he has to say.

19 | Carolyn Hill | 10154747192994729_10154747299514729 | How can man who manufactures in Bangladesh and China and Cheat The USA out of Tax Money and File Multiple Bankruptcies cheating Americans make the USA  great ? He has done nothing to better it. The building with his name is not his. The anti- Christ is an enemy to women. I wonder if Trump ever paid for any abortions? Pause and think about that.
20 | Carolyn Hill | 10154747192994729_10154747264659729 | I appreciate our media you guys are great not perfect but give us the facts. Our media is so patriotic and I appreciate all of you. Thank you.

22 | Beth Dove Allyson Vickery | 10154747192994729_10154747291809729 | Vote fraud is proven in recent video from WIKI , OBAMA is involved, I do not think TRUMP should accept anything until votes are checked
23 | Jack Elliott | 10154747192994729_10154747311289729 | Kinda guess he really doesn't have a choice! What's he gonna do handcuff himself to the White House furniture? Ok I guess that is possible!
24 | Rebecca Laskey | 10154747192994729_10154747298174729 | SO THE NARCISSISTIC PATHOLOGICAL SERIAL LIAR, THE GUY WHO ASSAULTS, RAPES AND DEMEANS WOMEN ASKS:  "WHAT THE HELL DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE"???As a Black, Muslim, Gay AND A Woman. EVERYTHING!!Here is why:1. The misogynistic pathetic small man has shown over and over again throughout his life he has zero respect for women. He has said cringe worthy horrible/outrageous things about women all his life. He has consistently insulted, belittled, sexualized, and stereotyped women. Such insecure small man with zero respect for women and their contributions to our society should have NO place holding the highest office in the land. And he has promised to nominate conservative justices who will limit women's reproductive rights & women's ability to make informed decisions about their own bodies. This is a man who believes women should be "punished" for having an abortion. And he promised to overturn Roe vs. Wade if he gets elected. Just a little history here: "In the 1950s, estimates of numbers of illegal, unsafe abortions ranged widely, from 200,000 to 1.2 million per year. The methods used were often ineffective and dangerous. Desperate women were driven into the back alley, where they endured danger and abuse, sometimes sexual." Access to safe, legal abortion saves women's lives. The reality is there‚Äôs no such thing as no abortion. Just safe & unsafe. As a woman I can NOT afford to have a president who will take us back decades on the progress we made on women's rights. So as a woman I have everything to lose. 2.  I was raised in a Muslim family, even though I no longer consider myself a practicing Muslim. So that xenophobic con man's hate-filled rhetoric is a direct attack on my family and I. So as a Muslim American, I can NOT have afforded to have a president as hateful and careless as him. This country does NOT afford to have a man whose xenophobic rhetoric is feeding terrorist groups like ISIS's recruitment videos. A man whose hate-filled rhetoric terrorist experts believe is detrimental to the counterterrorism and anti- terrorism missions around the world. History shows a leader who believe people should be treated differently based on their religion is dangerous. So as a Muslim American I have everything to lose. 3. As a black person I can NOT afford to have a racist person who refused to disavow Ku Klux Klan as a president. A person who was the leading voice of the ‚Äúbirther‚Äù movement, a racist effort to try to delegitimize the nation's first black president. A racist person who ignored Fair Housing Act and let his employees mark applications of minorities with a 'C' for 'Colored' & refused to rent or negotiate rentals ‚Äúbecause of race and color.‚Äù A racist person whose campaign is attracting scary number of neo-Nazi white supremacist organizations. A racist man whose campaign selected white nationalist leader as a delegate. A racist man who hired Breitbart News executive chairman Steve Bannon, a leader of white supremacist group as his campaign CEO signaling his campaign is fully embracing the white supremacist alt-right & all their race-baiting ideas. A racist person whose campaign rallies looks like a klan gathering. On top of that he promised to nominate conservative justices who will take us back decades on voting rights. So as a black American I have everything to lose. 4. As a lesbian I can NOT afforded to have a president who does NOT think I should marry whoever my heart desire. The LGBT community has made historic progress in the past few years, I cannot afford to have a president who will destroy all those progresses by nominating conservative justices who will turn the clock back years. So as a gay citizen, I have everything to lose. 5. As a proud citizen of this great country who believes in American values I can NOT afford to have a self-serving, greedy, pathological liar, con-man who is walking all over those values as a president. To the white people who are not motivated by hate and resentment but still support Trump, I as a minority would like to ask you to think about how Trump's presidency affect me and people like me. I would like to sincerely ask you to reconsider your support for him. Please. To the people who are planning to vote for a third party candidate: I would like to ask you to think really, really hard. Especially, if you care about progressive ideas and believe Trump presidency will take us back decades on the progress we have made on women issues, LGBT issues...etc. The fact is we are a two-party system, Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump will be America's next president. Period! And your vote could decide the next President. Simply put, a vote that is not for Hillary is directly or indirectly a vote for Trump. Just as a note, I am NOT saying Hillary is perfect or doesn't come with a lot of baggage. So if you believe the con-man is unqualified, temperamentally unfit, and dangerous please reconsider voting for Hillary Clinton and vote blue up and down the ballot.Trump and Pence show extreme contempt towards Gays, LGBT and LGBTQ.  Both on are record as being ANTI-GAY!A vote for Trump is a lost vote - he will not become the next president of The United States of America!It is paramount that The President of The United States of America is a sane, intelligent, curious, controlled person, who is a reliable, detail-oriented, steadfast, cautious and methodical person without whom organizations and society would dissolve (fall apart). Hillary fits the aforementioned description! She is a woman, who can keep her cool!Trump on the other hand is non-reflecting and ruthless character, who lacks emphatic traits under non-sexual circumstances. He is extremely nervous and very emotional driven. He completely lacks self-knowledge! He is little bothered by second thoughts and self-doubt. That doesn't mean he is smart but that he is rather dumb. His knowledge is in general extremely limited. Since he does not reflect on his errors or analyze any mistakes to any great extent - Trump is incapable to learn from his errors, and so he will be caught in a loop, repeating his mistakes, which can have catastrophic consequences for the US, the rest of the world and possible beyond depending on the nature of his actions.In all fairness in the Vice Presidential debate Tuesday night, October 4, 2016, Mike Pence acted far more "vice presidential" than Tim Kaine, who was rude and insulting as well as he was talking over Mike Pence, who just had to sit there and take it.HOWEVER, Trump would still do the right thing if he voluntarily steps down from the presidential election campaign. Whether he steps down or not he will not be elected as the next President of The United States of America!DONALD TRUMP TRIED TO FIRE NANCY O‚ÄôDELL AFTER SHE REJECTED HIS ADVANCES!  HOW COME HE HASN‚ÄôT APOLOGIZED TO HER?  HIS APOLOGY MEANS NOTHING !!!PROMINATE GOP LEADERS ARE DITCHING DONALD TRUMP IS DROVES.  THE RNC STOPS WORK ON THE ‚ÄúVICTORY‚Äù PROJECT AND PULLS FUNDING FOR DONALD TRUMP !!!DONALD TRUMP RAPED HIS 1ST WIFE, IVANA.

It could start a blood bath or mini civil war. Get him under control GOP!Since the Civil War the US has been a stable democracy.

5 | Keith John Sampson | 10154747191739729_10154747198674729 | When Trump loses he can whine all day and night but he will still be a loser. And Hillary Clinton will be President.
6 | Peter J. Furbert | 10154747191739729_10154747198299729 | That was his way of conceding. He threw in the towel by saying he would not accept the results. The writing is on the wall

Donald Chump Trump is simply a dangerous loose cannon that has no impulse control, is a raving lunatic and narcissist who subscribes to fringe conspiracy theories & is truly a demagogue of the sort that we haven't seen in our lifetimes. Whether you like her or not, Hillary has the experience, knowledge and temperament to lead our country forward. The choice is stark and clear for all rational Americans whether we are Republicans, Democrats or Independents. Despite the evidence, Trump still denies Putin was behind the hacks. He wants to make "Russia Great Again". #NEVERTRUMP. #putcountryfirst

4 | Rita Diane Palmer | 10154746704859729_10154746740199729 | Trump has less than a 15 percent chance of winning the presidency according to HuffPost‚Äôs election forecast model. And that‚Äôs all based on polls from before this latest scandal. In order to have a chance at winning the presidency, Trump has to carry several states that are leaning toward his opponent, including Ohio, Florida, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The worst news for Trump comes out of Ohio. The Buckeye State had been tilting toward the Republican throughout September, but his lead has evaporated in the last two weeks. A new CBS/YouGov poll shows Clinton leading by 4 points, 46 percent to Trump‚Äôs 42 percent. The HuffPost forecast model was calling Ohio for Trump, but that shifted over the weekend. We‚Äôre now calling it for Clinton ‚Äï only with 57 percent certainty, but the trend line is bad for Trump.

8 | Sergey Malovatov | 10154746704859729_10154747159244729 | The Sad True Story of Hillary ClintonThis is the sad but true story of Hillary Clinton: Hillary Clinton and her husband got very used to their luxurious life style while Bill was the President.However, after his presidency had ended, Bill Clinton having being disbarred for perjury, the Clintons could not continue in their luxurious habits. They could not practice law any longer, so Bill and Hillary Clinton decided to use their political connections to make real big money. They started lobbying the interests of the big banks and corporations!That is why Bill Clinton became the proponent of the notorious financial deregulation movement that eventually destroyed US economy. Bill and Hillary Clinton helped the largest banks have US financial industry essentially deregulated, which resulted in the 2008 financial crisis. The bankers were happy and the Clintons could enjoy the privileges of the upper class. From then on, Hillary Clinton dedicated her life to representing the interests of the big banks and corporations in exchange for money that initially was given to her and Bill in the form of payments for their speeches (hundreds of thousands of dollars per speech). When bigger money became involved, they created their family Clinton Foundation and the money started pouring into it in the form of donations. Her criminal interactions had to be covered up, though. So, HRC was using her private email servers for that purpose while she was serving as secretary of state. That is why later, after the beginning of the Congressional investigation of their activities, the Clintons deleted all those emails, many of which contained government classified information, as they were directly incriminating Hillary Clinton in many shady dealings including selling access to the US Government to their rich foreign donors through the Clinton Foundation. Now, her corrupt friends from among the bankers and certain corporations are trying to use the mainstream news media to make her president, as Hillary Clinton has promised to continue to further consolidate the economic interests of certain private corporations with the political interests of the US Government. The corporate interest groups and the media are trying to make her look good and sound experienced. But in reality Hillary Clinton is not good and she has never been good at anything. Hillary Clinton is very corrupt. She has been corrupt all along. That was the only way she and her disbarred husband could have made such big money to support their lavish life style that they so got used to. However, Hillary and Bill Clinton have gone too far.She sold government contracts and political influence to the highest bidder, which of course were the biggest banks and largest corporations that ravaged the country and caused the financial and economic crisis in the US and the world over! Her corruption threatens to destroy US economy and the very existence of the union. Incompetent as a state official and immensely corrupt as a career politician, HRC is not fit to be president by any measure! She is too dishonest, too corrupt, and too selfish and irresponsible to occupy the most demanding position in the world. HRC is simply a conduit for pouring more corporate money into the US government to make it responsible only to the biggest corporations and the biggest banks in the US and abroad. If Hillary Clinton was to be elected president of the United States, the American people and the nation as such would be completely neglected and left to ruin!

16 | Mamadu Sallieu Barrie | 10154746584184729_10154746609869729 | Does Donal Trump have the qualities to be commander In Chief and president of United States of America?
17 | Kevin Lynch | 10154746584184729_10154747071384729 | Hillary look great and she did even better than she looked. She answered at depth and with intelligence and dignity.Donald did his worst. He looked like a nasty pig and actEd like one.I never seen a worse experience than Trump. He only incites HATRED.Enough already.
18 | Ken MacPike | 10154746584184729_10154746621569729 | With the publics knowledge of your use of a private server, the use of a deletion program to wipe it clean and the destruction of 13 phones used while you were Secretary of State, why should voters feel confident they can trust you as President ?
19 | Larry Ray | 10154746584184729_10154747241999729 | Hillary accused the Russians of exposing her transgressions and sins!!!
20 | Henrik Ahlm | 10154746584184729_10154746838724729 | As I have said for weeks  - there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that Trump will not be elected as the next President of The United States of America! First of all ‚Äì the vast majority of people in America are sane, clever and smart people. Secondly, Melania Trump just openly admitted, that Trump was ‚Äúegged on‚Äù by Billy Bush to ‚Äúsay dirty and bad stuff.‚Äù Who on Earth would vote for a man, who is so easily provoked?  Not a sane normal functioning American citizen! Imagine such a miswired, incoherent babblehead as Trump being Chief in Command and President of the greatest nation on Earth?  Trump is also the candidate, who started using name calling, lies and disrespectful language in the presidential debate ‚Äì and that immediately told me ‚Äì that this guy is totally unfit to rule and he should be stopped!Thrump's actions has resulted in the current deplorable and unworthy presidential campaign. Trump will make America a much more unsafe and much poorer place to live with no community cohesion, whatsoever!Remember on voting day, November 8th, 2016 to vote for Hillary. Let me tell you this, Trump -  The end is near and now you face the final curtain - of that you can be very certain!
21 | Sergey Malovatov | 10154746584184729_10154747159419729 | The Sad True Story of Hillary ClintonThis is the sad but true story of Hillary Clinton: Hillary Clinton and her husband got very used to their luxurious life style while Bill was the President.However, after his presidency had ended, Bill Clinton having being disbarred for perjury, the Clintons could not continue in their luxurious habits. They could not practice law any longer, so Bill and Hillary Clinton decided to use their political connections to make real big money. They started lobbying the interests of the big banks and corporations!That is why Bill Clinton became the proponent of the notorious financial deregulation movement that eventually destroyed US economy. Bill and Hillary Clinton helped the largest banks have US financial industry essentially deregulated, which resulted in the 2008 financial crisis. The bankers were happy and the Clintons could enjoy the privileges of the upper class. From then on, Hillary Clinton dedicated her life to representing the interests of the big banks and corporations in exchange for money that initially was given to her and Bill in the form of payments for their speeches (hundreds of thousands of dollars per speech). When bigger money became involved, they created their family Clinton Foundation and the money started pouring into it in the form of donations. Her criminal interactions had to be covered up, though. So, HRC was using her private email servers for that purpose while she was serving as secretary of state. That is why later, after the beginning of the Congressional investigation of their activities, the Clintons deleted all those emails, many of which contained government classified information, as they were directly incriminating Hillary Clinton in many shady dealings including selling access to the US Government to their rich foreign donors through the Clinton Foundation. Now, her corrupt friends from among the bankers and certain corporations are trying to use the mainstream news media to make her president, as Hillary Clinton has promised to continue to further consolidate the economic interests of certain private corporations with the political interests of the US Government. The corporate interest groups and the media are trying to make her look good and sound experienced. But in reality Hillary Clinton is not good and she has never been good at anything. Hillary Clinton is very corrupt. She has been corrupt all along. That was the only way she and her disbarred husband could have made such big money to support their lavish life style that they so got used to. However, Hillary and Bill Clinton have gone too far.She sold government contracts and political influence to the highest bidder, which of course were the biggest banks and largest corporations that ravaged the country and caused the financial and economic crisis in the US and the world over! Her corruption threatens to destroy US economy and the very existence of the union. Incompetent as a state official and immensely corrupt as a career politician, HRC is not fit to be president by any measure! She is too dishonest, too corrupt, and too selfish and irresponsible to occupy the most demanding position in the world. HRC is simply a conduit for pouring more corporate money into the US government to make it responsible only to the biggest corporations and the biggest banks in the US and abroad. If Hillary Clinton was to be elected president of the United States, the American people and the nation as such would be completely neglected and left to ruin!
22 | Scott Wayne | 10154746584184729_10154747091559729 | Hillary is looking to go to war with Russia killing American youth. Trump wants to work with Russia to defeat ISIS and save American youth. Hillary People of hati HATE u for stealing their aid money. Hillary where is the $8 Billion you lost at the State Department Hillary ! u had 30 years to fix America, but u chosed to SCREW America! U LOOSE AMERICA WINS for TRUMP!
23 | Cheryl Heymans | 10154746584184729_10154746631519729 | Trump speaks of ending political corruption but what is his view on Citizen's United?  Does he agree that until we get money out of politics, our politicians and parties will remain corrupt?
24 | Liberty Brown | 10154746584184729_10154746609254729 | Russian Cyber Attack?  how about liar? corrupt government?  I get it, they dont want all that garbage revealed, like Obama lying about NOT knowing about Clintons private servers...it was lie and its in the e-mails he DID know.  Or how about the FBI being pressured by the President so they would not take any legal action against Hillary? or how about the DNC plotting against Berny Sanders (and him having no backbone bending over and taking it even AFTER he found out about it) Hillary Clinton endagering National Security?  How about the Clinton campaign setting up protests to start violence at Trump Rallies?  Or how about the actually PROVEN sexual predator Bill Clinton getting meeting together with Loretta Lynch, corrupt Judge, before the FBI made a decision about the wrong use of private servers the Hillary used? How about the democrats caught ON camera talking about how to cheat in the elections?  Interesting how the media is more interested and upset about WHO hacked the e-mails more so than the e-mails THEMSELVES!? Thats like saying I hacked into my friends computer, found a bunch of pictures of children being sexually abused by him and calling the cops...but of course the cops will put ME in handcuffs for hacking his computer, not HIM for SEXUALLY ABUSING KIDS?  It is shameful and embarrassing how uneducated the American population is that they fall for this kind of corruption and one sided media

I don't like some of his characteristics, but I cannot abide open boarders, a woman who openly lies and supports the Muslim Brotherhood, a stacked supreme court that will definitely cancel out the 2nd amendment, and expanded government control over all aspects of our lives!
2 | Samantha Hartwell | 10154746479529729_10154746489504729 | Hillary needs to invite Alec Baldwin dressed as Trump from his SNL skit to sit front and center at the Debate... That would be a HOOT‚ùóÔ∏è

My proudest accomplishment in which I take the most pride, mostly because of the opposition it faced early on, you know, the remnants of prior situations and mind-sets that were too narrowly focused in a manner whereby they may have overlooked the bigger picture, and we didn‚Äôt do that, and I‚Äôm proud of that. Very proud. I would say that‚Äôs a major accomplishment.‚Äù Hillary Clinton 11 March 2014 Could someone please tell me what she just said? And she is running for President!???

I was the only girl to run in that whole relay and I was the final runner to receive baton. I ran until my feet bled (literally) -- and we won. Now I'm running against Mrs. Clinton to defend the very people from my community who support her, who are trusting someone who is, in my opinion, exploiting (not leading). I know real leaders, moral, brave leaders. I grew up with one. And I will run until my soles bleed. I will not be silenced. #LatinosWithTrump

This is beyond anything else we could be discussing about past (temporal) campaigns, sir. Associated Press has reported the potential use of chemical weapons by ISIS overseas in battle. PLEASE. What is TRUE LEADERSHIP if not putting our nation and true priorities before politics. Mrs. Hillary Clinton has helped bring us here. WE CANNOT PERMIT HER TO BE ELECTED BECAUSE THE RISK IS GREATER WITH HER. HER JUDGMENT IS ENDANGERING ME AND MY FAMILY. PLEASE, MR. BUSH. PLEASE HELP US. PLEASE HELP YOUR COUNTRY.

4 | Rebecca Laskey | 10154746421579729_10154746431569729 | HARVARD HAS BROKEN A 128-YEAR OF VOTING REPUBLICAN, BECAUSE OF TRUMP!Dear Members and Alumni,In every presidential election since 1888, the members and Executive Board of the Harvard Republican Club have gathered to discuss, debate, and eventually endorse the standard-bearer of our party. But for the first time in 128 years, we, the oldest College Republicans chapter in the nation, will not be endorsing the Republican nominee.Donald Trump holds views that are antithetical to our values not only as Republicans, but as Americans. The rhetoric he espouses ‚Äìfrom racist slander to misogynistic taunts‚Äì is not consistent with our conservative principles, and his repeated mocking of the disabled and belittling of the sacrifices made by prisoners of war, Gold Star families, and Purple Heart recipients is not only bad politics, but absurdly cruel.If enacted, Donald Trump‚Äôs platform would endanger our security both at home and abroad. Domestically, his protectionist trade policies and draconian immigration restrictions would enlarge our federal deficit, raise prices for consumers, and throw our economy back into recession. Trump‚Äôs global outlook, steeped in isolationism, is considerably out-of-step with the traditional Republican stance as well. The flippancy with which he is willing to abdicate the United States‚Äô responsibility to lead is alarming. Calling for the US‚Äô withdrawal from NATO and actively endorsing nuclear proliferation, Donald Trump‚Äôs foreign policy would wreak havoc on the established world order which has held aggressive foreign powers in check since World War II.Perhaps most importantly, however, Donald Trump simply does not possess the temperament and character necessary to lead the United States through an increasingly perilous world. The last week should have made obvious to all what has been obvious to most for more than a year. In response to any slight ‚Äìperceived or real‚Äì Donald Trump lashes out viciously and irresponsibly. In Trump‚Äôs eyes, disagreement with his actions or his policies warrants incessant name calling and derision: stupid, lying, fat, ugly, weak, failing, idiot ‚Äìand that‚Äôs just his ‚Äúfellow‚Äù Republicans.He isn‚Äôt eschewing political correctness. He is eschewing basic human decency.Donald Trump, despite spending more than a year on the campaign trail, has either refused or been unable to educate himself on issues that matter most to Americans like us. He speaks only in platitudes, about greatness, success, and winning. Time and time again, Trump has demonstrated his complete lack of knowledge on critical matters, meandering from position to position over the course of the election. When confronted about these frequent reversals, Trump lies in a manner more brazen and shameless than anything politics has ever seen.Millions of people across the country are feeling despondent. Their hours have been cut, wages slashed, jobs even shipped overseas. But Donald Trump doesn‚Äôt have a plan to fix that. He has a plan to exploit that.Donald Trump is a threat to the survival of the Republic. His authoritarian tendencies and flirtations with fascism are unparalleled in the history of our democracy. He hopes to divide us by race, by class, and by religion, instilling enough fear and anxiety to propel himself to the White House. He is looking to to pit neighbor against neighbor, friend against friend, American against American. We will not stand for this vitriolic rhetoric that is poisoning our country and our children. President Reagan called on us to maintain this, our shining city on a hill. He called on us to maintain freedom abroad by keeping a strong presence in the world. He called on us to maintain liberty at home by upholding the democratic process and respecting our opponents. He called on us to maintain decency in our hearts by loving our neighbor.He would be ashamed of Donald Trump. We are too. This fall, we will instead focus our efforts on reclaiming the Republican Party from those who have done it considerable harm, campaigning for candidates who will uphold the conservative principles that have defined the Republican Party for generations. We will work to ensure both chambers of Congress remain in Republican hands, continuing to protect against executive overreach regardless of who wins the election this November.We call on our party‚Äôs elected leaders to renounce their support of Donald Trump, and urge our fellow College Republicans to join us in condemning and withholding their endorsement from this dangerous man. The conservative movement in America should not and will not go quietly into the night.A longtime student of American democracy, Alexis de Tocqueville once said, ‚ÄúAmerica is great because she is good. If America ceases to be good, America will cease to be great.‚Äù De Tocqueville believed in the United States. Americans are a decent people. We work hard, protect our own, and look out for one another in times of need, regardless of the color of our skin, the God we worship, or our party registration. Donald Trump may not believe in that America, but we do. And that America will never cease to be great.HILLARY CLINTON CANNOT TAKE AWAY SECOND AMENDMENT GUN RIGHTS WITHOUT APPROVAL OF CONGRESS.  HILLARY DOES NOT WANT TO ABOLISH YOUR 2ND AMENDMENT.  ANOTHER TRUMP LIE.AMERICA IS ALREADY GOOD AND WE ARE BETTER THAN DONALD TRUMP!REGISTER AND VOTE BLUE UP AND DOWN THE BALLOT.1st DEBATE ~ EPIC FAILURE ON DONALD TRUMP‚ÄôS PART!  AND THIS GUY WANTS TO BE PRESIDENT???  I DON‚ÄôT THINK SO!  HILLARY CLEARLY WON THE DEBATE, HANDS DOWN!!!#NeverTrumPutin#NoTaxesNoVote#NeverTrumpPence
5 | Rebecca Laskey | 10154746421579729_10154746431119729 | SO THE NARCISSISTIC PATHOLOGICAL SERIAL LIAR, THE GUY WHO ASSAULTS, RAPES AND DEMEANS WOMEN ASKS:  "WHAT THE HELL DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE"???As a Black, Muslim, Gay AND A Woman. EVERYTHING!!Here is why:1. The misogynistic pathetic small man has shown over and over again throughout his life he has zero respect for women. He has said cringe worthy horrible/outrageous things about women all his life. He has consistently insulted, belittled, sexualized, and stereotyped women. Such insecure small man with zero respect for women and their contributions to our society should have NO place holding the highest office in the land. And he has promised to nominate conservative justices who will limit women's reproductive rights & women's ability to make informed decisions about their own bodies. This is a man who believes women should be "punished" for having an abortion. And he promised to overturn Roe vs. Wade if he gets elected. Just a little history here: "In the 1950s, estimates of numbers of illegal, unsafe abortions ranged widely, from 200,000 to 1.2 million per year. The methods used were often ineffective and dangerous. Desperate women were driven into the back alley, where they endured danger and abuse, sometimes sexual." Access to safe, legal abortion saves women's lives. The reality is there‚Äôs no such thing as no abortion. Just safe & unsafe. As a woman I can NOT afford to have a president who will take us back decades on the progress we made on women's rights. So as a woman I have everything to lose. 2.  I was raised in a Muslim family, even though I no longer consider myself a practicing Muslim. So that xenophobic con man's hate-filled rhetoric is a direct attack on my family and I. So as a Muslim American, I can NOT have afforded to have a president as hateful and careless as him. This country does NOT afford to have a man whose xenophobic rhetoric is feeding terrorist groups like ISIS's recruitment videos. A man whose hate-filled rhetoric terrorist experts believe is detrimental to the counterterrorism and anti- terrorism missions around the world. History shows a leader who believe people should be treated differently based on their religion is dangerous. So as a Muslim American I have everything to lose. 3. As a black person I can NOT afford to have a racist person who refused to disavow Ku Klux Klan as a president. A person who was the leading voice of the ‚Äúbirther‚Äù movement, a racist effort to try to delegitimize the nation's first black president. A racist person who ignored Fair Housing Act and let his employees mark applications of minorities with a 'C' for 'Colored' & refused to rent or negotiate rentals ‚Äúbecause of race and color.‚Äù A racist person whose campaign is attracting scary number of neo-Nazi white supremacist organizations. A racist man whose campaign selected white nationalist leader as a delegate. A racist man who hired Breitbart News executive chairman Steve Bannon, a leader of white supremacist group as his campaign CEO signaling his campaign is fully embracing the white supremacist alt-right & all their race-baiting ideas. A racist person whose campaign rallies looks like a klan gathering. On top of that he promised to nominate conservative justices who will take us back decades on voting rights. So as a black American I have everything to lose. 4. As a lesbian I can NOT afforded to have a president who does NOT think I should marry whoever my heart desire. The LGBT community has made historic progress in the past few years, I cannot afford to have a president who will destroy all those progresses by nominating conservative justices who will turn the clock back years. So as a gay citizen, I have everything to lose. 5. As a proud citizen of this great country who believes in American values I can NOT afford to have a self-serving, greedy, pathological liar, con-man who is walking all over those values as a president. To the white people who are not motivated by hate and resentment but still support Trump, I as a minority would like to ask you to think about how Trump's presidency affect me and people like me. I would like to sincerely ask you to reconsider your support for him. Please. To the people who are planning to vote for a third party candidate: I would like to ask you to think really, really hard. Especially, if you care about progressive ideas and believe Trump presidency will take us back decades on the progress we have made on women issues, LGBT issues...etc. The fact is we are a two-party system, Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump will be America's next president. Period! And your vote could decide the next President. Simply put, a vote that is not for Hillary is directly or indirectly a vote for Trump. Just as a note, I am NOT saying Hillary is perfect or doesn't come with a lot of baggage. So if you believe the con-man is unqualified, temperamentally unfit, and dangerous please reconsider voting for Hillary Clinton and vote blue up and down the ballot.Trump and Pence show extreme contempt towards Gays, LGBT and LGBTQ.  Both on are record as being ANTI-GAY!A vote for Trump is a lost vote - he will not become the next president of The United States of America!It is paramount that The President of The United States of America is a sane, intelligent, curious, controlled person, who is a reliable, detail-oriented, steadfast, cautious and methodical person without whom organizations and society would dissolve (fall apart). Hillary fits the aforementioned description! She is a woman, who can keep her cool!Trump on the other hand is non-reflecting and ruthless character, who lacks emphatic traits under non-sexual circumstances. He is extremely nervous and very emotional driven. He completely lacks self-knowledge! He is little bothered by second thoughts and self-doubt. That doesn't mean he is smart but that he is rather dumb. His knowledge is in general extremely limited. Since he does not reflect on his errors or analyze any mistakes to any great extent - Trump is incapable to learn from his errors, and so he will be caught in a loop, repeating his mistakes, which can have catastrophic consequences for the US, the rest of the world and possible beyond depending on the nature of his actions.In all fairness in the Vice Presidential debate Tuesday night, October 4, 2016, Mike Pence acted far more "vice presidential" than Tim Kaine, who was rude and insulting as well as he was talking over Mike Pence, who just had to sit there and take it.HOWEVER, Trump would still do the right thing if he voluntarily steps down from the presidential election campaign. Whether he steps down or not he will not be elected as the next President of The United States of America!DONALD TRUMP TRIED TO FIRE NANCY O‚ÄôDELL AFTER SHE REJECTED HIS ADVANCES!

6 | Sergey Malovatov | 10154746421579729_10154747159669729 | The Sad True Story of Hillary ClintonThis is the sad but true story of Hillary Clinton: Hillary Clinton and her husband got very used to their luxurious life style while Bill was the President.However, after his presidency had ended, Bill Clinton having being disbarred for perjury, the Clintons could not continue in their luxurious habits. They could not practice law any longer, so Bill and Hillary Clinton decided to use their political connections to make real big money. They started lobbying the interests of the big banks and corporations!That is why Bill Clinton became the proponent of the notorious financial deregulation movement that eventually destroyed US economy. Bill and Hillary Clinton helped the largest banks have US financial industry essentially deregulated, which resulted in the 2008 financial crisis. The bankers were happy and the Clintons could enjoy the privileges of the upper class. From then on, Hillary Clinton dedicated her life to representing the interests of the big banks and corporations in exchange for money that initially was given to her and Bill in the form of payments for their speeches (hundreds of thousands of dollars per speech). When bigger money became involved, they created their family Clinton Foundation and the money started pouring into it in the form of donations. Her criminal interactions had to be covered up, though. So, HRC was using her private email servers for that purpose while she was serving as secretary of state. That is why later, after the beginning of the Congressional investigation of their activities, the Clintons deleted all those emails, many of which contained government classified information, as they were directly incriminating Hillary Clinton in many shady dealings including selling access to the US Government to their rich foreign donors through the Clinton Foundation. Now, her corrupt friends from among the bankers and certain corporations are trying to use the mainstream news media to make her president, as Hillary Clinton has promised to continue to further consolidate the economic interests of certain private corporations with the political interests of the US Government. The corporate interest groups and the media are trying to make her look good and sound experienced. But in reality Hillary Clinton is not good and she has never been good at anything. Hillary Clinton is very corrupt. She has been corrupt all along. That was the only way she and her disbarred husband could have made such big money to support their lavish life style that they so got used to. However, Hillary and Bill Clinton have gone too far.She sold government contracts and political influence to the highest bidder, which of course were the biggest banks and largest corporations that ravaged the country and caused the financial and economic crisis in the US and the world over! Her corruption threatens to destroy US economy and the very existence of the union. Incompetent as a state official and immensely corrupt as a career politician, HRC is not fit to be president by any measure! She is too dishonest, too corrupt, and too selfish and irresponsible to occupy the most demanding position in the world. HRC is simply a conduit for pouring more corporate money into the US government to make it responsible only to the biggest corporations and the biggest banks in the US and abroad. If Hillary Clinton was to be elected president of the United States, the American people and the nation as such would be completely neglected and left to ruin!

10 | Rebecca Laskey | 10154746421579729_10154746431364729 | CROOKED DONALD TRUMP AND THE TRUMP CRIME FAMILY Spent more than a quarter-million dollars from his charitable foundation to settle lawsuits that involved the billionaire‚Äôs for-profit businesses, according to interviews and a review of legal documents.Those cases, which together used $258,000 from Trump‚Äôs charity, were among four newly documented expenditures in which Trump may have violated laws against ‚Äúself-dealing‚Äù ‚Äî which prohibit nonprofit leaders from using charity money to benefit themselves or their businesses.In one case, from 2007, Trump‚Äôs Mar-a-Lago Club faced $120,000 in unpaid fines from the town of Palm Beach, Fla., resulting from a dispute over the size of a flagpole.In a settlement, Palm Beach agreed to waive those fines ‚Äî if Trump‚Äôs club made a $100,000 donation to a specific charity for veterans. Instead, Trump sent a check from the Donald J. Trump Foundation, a charity funded almost entirely by other people‚Äôs money, according to tax records.In another case, court papers say one of Trump‚Äôs golf courses in New York agreed to settle a lawsuit by making a donation to the plaintiff‚Äôs chosen charity. A $158,000 donation was made by the Trump Foundation, according to tax records.According to the report, Trump used Trump Foundation money, that would be money that was donated by other people to his charitable foundation to do charitable stuff, to pay for debts owed by Trump's personal businesses. This, however, is in keeping with Trump using Trump Foundation money for a political donation to Florida's Attorney General and to buy a portrait of him for his personal use. These all are covered by the IRS regulations prohibiting "self-dealing" by charitable organizations.New Information:  Trump asks those who owe him money to send it to his Trump Charity to avoid paying taxes on it.UPDATE: TRUMP DOES NOT HAVE THE PROPER CERTIFICATION TO SOLICIT OUTSIDE DONORS!  ANYTHING OVER $25,000 REQUIRES AN AUDIT ACCORDING TO THE NEW YORK AG.  UH OH‚Ä¶..TRUMP PAID $8.2 Million to Family Members/Businesses.  MONEY CAME FROM THOSE WHO CONTRIBUTE TO HIS CAMPAIGN.

4 | Rebecca Laskey | 10154745817569729_10154746433359729 | HARVARD HAS BROKEN A 128-YEAR OF VOTING REPUBLICAN, BECAUSE OF TRUMP!Dear Members and Alumni,In every presidential election since 1888, the members and Executive Board of the Harvard Republican Club have gathered to discuss, debate, and eventually endorse the standard-bearer of our party. But for the first time in 128 years, we, the oldest College Republicans chapter in the nation, will not be endorsing the Republican nominee.Donald Trump holds views that are antithetical to our values not only as Republicans, but as Americans. The rhetoric he espouses ‚Äìfrom racist slander to misogynistic taunts‚Äì is not consistent with our conservative principles, and his repeated mocking of the disabled and belittling of the sacrifices made by prisoners of war, Gold Star families, and Purple Heart recipients is not only bad politics, but absurdly cruel.If enacted, Donald Trump‚Äôs platform would endanger our security both at home and abroad. Domestically, his protectionist trade policies and draconian immigration restrictions would enlarge our federal deficit, raise prices for consumers, and throw our economy back into recession. Trump‚Äôs global outlook, steeped in isolationism, is considerably out-of-step with the traditional Republican stance as well. The flippancy with which he is willing to abdicate the United States‚Äô responsibility to lead is alarming. Calling for the US‚Äô withdrawal from NATO and actively endorsing nuclear proliferation, Donald Trump‚Äôs foreign policy would wreak havoc on the established world order which has held aggressive foreign powers in check since World War II.Perhaps most importantly, however, Donald Trump simply does not possess the temperament and character necessary to lead the United States through an increasingly perilous world. The last week should have made obvious to all what has been obvious to most for more than a year. In response to any slight ‚Äìperceived or real‚Äì Donald Trump lashes out viciously and irresponsibly. In Trump‚Äôs eyes, disagreement with his actions or his policies warrants incessant name calling and derision: stupid, lying, fat, ugly, weak, failing, idiot ‚Äìand that‚Äôs just his ‚Äúfellow‚Äù Republicans.He isn‚Äôt eschewing political correctness. He is eschewing basic human decency.Donald Trump, despite spending more than a year on the campaign trail, has either refused or been unable to educate himself on issues that matter most to Americans like us. He speaks only in platitudes, about greatness, success, and winning. Time and time again, Trump has demonstrated his complete lack of knowledge on critical matters, meandering from position to position over the course of the election. When confronted about these frequent reversals, Trump lies in a manner more brazen and shameless than anything politics has ever seen.Millions of people across the country are feeling despondent. Their hours have been cut, wages slashed, jobs even shipped overseas. But Donald Trump doesn‚Äôt have a plan to fix that. He has a plan to exploit that.Donald Trump is a threat to the survival of the Republic. His authoritarian tendencies and flirtations with fascism are unparalleled in the history of our democracy. He hopes to divide us by race, by class, and by religion, instilling enough fear and anxiety to propel himself to the White House. He is looking to to pit neighbor against neighbor, friend against friend, American against American. We will not stand for this vitriolic rhetoric that is poisoning our country and our children. President Reagan called on us to maintain this, our shining city on a hill. He called on us to maintain freedom abroad by keeping a strong presence in the world. He called on us to maintain liberty at home by upholding the democratic process and respecting our opponents. He called on us to maintain decency in our hearts by loving our neighbor.He would be ashamed of Donald Trump. We are too. This fall, we will instead focus our efforts on reclaiming the Republican Party from those who have done it considerable harm, campaigning for candidates who will uphold the conservative principles that have defined the Republican Party for generations. We will work to ensure both chambers of Congress remain in Republican hands, continuing to protect against executive overreach regardless of who wins the election this November.We call on our party‚Äôs elected leaders to renounce their support of Donald Trump, and urge our fellow College Republicans to join us in condemning and withholding their endorsement from this dangerous man. The conservative movement in America should not and will not go quietly into the night.A longtime student of American democracy, Alexis de Tocqueville once said, ‚ÄúAmerica is great because she is good. If America ceases to be good, America will cease to be great.‚Äù De Tocqueville believed in the United States. Americans are a decent people. We work hard, protect our own, and look out for one another in times of need, regardless of the color of our skin, the God we worship, or our party registration. Donald Trump may not believe in that America, but we do. And that America will never cease to be great.HILLARY CLINTON CANNOT TAKE AWAY SECOND AMENDMENT GUN RIGHTS WITHOUT APPROVAL OF CONGRESS.  HILLARY DOES NOT WANT TO ABOLISH YOUR 2ND AMENDMENT.  ANOTHER TRUMP LIE.AMERICA IS ALREADY GOOD AND WE ARE BETTER THAN DONALD TRUMP!REGISTER AND VOTE BLUE UP AND DOWN THE BALLOT.1st DEBATE ~ EPIC FAILURE ON DONALD TRUMP‚ÄôS PART!  AND THIS GUY WANTS TO BE PRESIDENT???  I DON‚ÄôT THINK SO!  HILLARY CLEARLY WON THE DEBATE, HANDS DOWN!!!#NeverTrumPutin#NoTaxesNoVote#NeverTrumpPence
5 | Rebecca Laskey | 10154745817569729_10154746432604729 | SO THE NARCISSISTIC PATHOLOGICAL SERIAL LIAR, THE GUY WHO ASSAULTS, RAPES AND DEMEANS WOMEN ASKS:  "WHAT THE HELL DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE"???As a Black, Muslim, Gay AND A Woman. EVERYTHING!!Here is why:1. The misogynistic pathetic small man has shown over and over again throughout his life he has zero respect for women. He has said cringe worthy horrible/outrageous things about women all his life. He has consistently insulted, belittled, sexualized, and stereotyped women. Such insecure small man with zero respect for women and their contributions to our society should have NO place holding the highest office in the land. And he has promised to nominate conservative justices who will limit women's reproductive rights & women's ability to make informed decisions about their own bodies. This is a man who believes women should be "punished" for having an abortion. And he promised to overturn Roe vs. Wade if he gets elected. Just a little history here: "In the 1950s, estimates of numbers of illegal, unsafe abortions ranged widely, from 200,000 to 1.2 million per year. The methods used were often ineffective and dangerous. Desperate women were driven into the back alley, where they endured danger and abuse, sometimes sexual." Access to safe, legal abortion saves women's lives. The reality is there‚Äôs no such thing as no abortion. Just safe & unsafe. As a woman I can NOT afford to have a president who will take us back decades on the progress we made on women's rights. So as a woman I have everything to lose. 2.  I was raised in a Muslim family, even though I no longer consider myself a practicing Muslim. So that xenophobic con man's hate-filled rhetoric is a direct attack on my family and I. So as a Muslim American, I can NOT have afforded to have a president as hateful and careless as him. This country does NOT afford to have a man whose xenophobic rhetoric is feeding terrorist groups like ISIS's recruitment videos. A man whose hate-filled rhetoric terrorist experts believe is detrimental to the counterterrorism and anti- terrorism missions around the world. History shows a leader who believe people should be treated differently based on their religion is dangerous. So as a Muslim American I have everything to lose. 3. As a black person I can NOT afford to have a racist person who refused to disavow Ku Klux Klan as a president. A person who was the leading voice of the ‚Äúbirther‚Äù movement, a racist effort to try to delegitimize the nation's first black president. A racist person who ignored Fair Housing Act and let his employees mark applications of minorities with a 'C' for 'Colored' & refused to rent or negotiate rentals ‚Äúbecause of race and color.‚Äù A racist person whose campaign is attracting scary number of neo-Nazi white supremacist organizations. A racist man whose campaign selected white nationalist leader as a delegate. A racist man who hired Breitbart News executive chairman Steve Bannon, a leader of white supremacist group as his campaign CEO signaling his campaign is fully embracing the white supremacist alt-right & all their race-baiting ideas. A racist person whose campaign rallies looks like a klan gathering. On top of that he promised to nominate conservative justices who will take us back decades on voting rights. So as a black American I have everything to lose. 4. As a lesbian I can NOT afforded to have a president who does NOT think I should marry whoever my heart desire. The LGBT community has made historic progress in the past few years, I cannot afford to have a president who will destroy all those progresses by nominating conservative justices who will turn the clock back years. So as a gay citizen, I have everything to lose. 5. As a proud citizen of this great country who believes in American values I can NOT afford to have a self-serving, greedy, pathological liar, con-man who is walking all over those values as a president. To the white people who are not motivated by hate and resentment but still support Trump, I as a minority would like to ask you to think about how Trump's presidency affect me and people like me. I would like to sincerely ask you to reconsider your support for him. Please. To the people who are planning to vote for a third party candidate: I would like to ask you to think really, really hard. Especially, if you care about progressive ideas and believe Trump presidency will take us back decades on the progress we have made on women issues, LGBT issues...etc. The fact is we are a two-party system, Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump will be America's next president. Period! And your vote could decide the next President. Simply put, a vote that is not for Hillary is directly or indirectly a vote for Trump. Just as a note, I am NOT saying Hillary is perfect or doesn't come with a lot of baggage. So if you believe the con-man is unqualified, temperamentally unfit, and dangerous please reconsider voting for Hillary Clinton and vote blue up and down the ballot.Trump and Pence show extreme contempt towards Gays, LGBT and LGBTQ.  Both on are record as being ANTI-GAY!A vote for Trump is a lost vote - he will not become the next president of The United States of America!It is paramount that The President of The United States of America is a sane, intelligent, curious, controlled person, who is a reliable, detail-oriented, steadfast, cautious and methodical person without whom organizations and society would dissolve (fall apart). Hillary fits the aforementioned description! She is a woman, who can keep her cool!Trump on the other hand is non-reflecting and ruthless character, who lacks emphatic traits under non-sexual circumstances. He is extremely nervous and very emotional driven. He completely lacks self-knowledge! He is little bothered by second thoughts and self-doubt. That doesn't mean he is smart but that he is rather dumb. His knowledge is in general extremely limited. Since he does not reflect on his errors or analyze any mistakes to any great extent - Trump is incapable to learn from his errors, and so he will be caught in a loop, repeating his mistakes, which can have catastrophic consequences for the US, the rest of the world and possible beyond depending on the nature of his actions.In all fairness in the Vice Presidential debate Tuesday night, October 4, 2016, Mike Pence acted far more "vice presidential" than Tim Kaine, who was rude and insulting as well as he was talking over Mike Pence, who just had to sit there and take it.HOWEVER, Trump would still do the right thing if he voluntarily steps down from the presidential election campaign. Whether he steps down or not he will not be elected as the next President of The United States of America!DONALD TRUMP TRIED TO FIRE NANCY O‚ÄôDELL AFTER SHE REJECTED HIS ADVANCES!  HOW COME HE HASN‚ÄôT APOLOGIZED TO HER?  HIS APOLOGY MEANS NOTHING !!!PROMINATE GOP LEADERS ARE DITCHING DONALD TRUMP IS DROVES.  THE RNC STOPS WORK ON THE ‚ÄúVICTORY‚Äù PROJECT AND PULLS FUNDING FOR DONALD TRUMP !!!DONALD TRUMP RAPED HIS 1ST WIFE, IVANA.  THAT IS DOCUMENTED IN HER BOOK THE (LOST TYCOON).DONALD TRUMP RAPED A 13-YEAR-OLD CHILD AND THE FEDERAL CASE IS PENDING IN NEW YORK.

7 | Henrik Ahlm | 10154745817569729_10154745825969729 | As I have said for weeks  - there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that Trump will not be elected as the next President of The United States of America! First of all ‚Äì the vast majority of people in America are sane, clever and smart people. Secondly, Melania Trump just openly admitted, that Trump was ‚Äúegged on‚Äù by Billy Bush to ‚Äúsay dirty and bad stuff.‚Äù Who on Earth would vote for a man, who is so easily provoked?  Not a sane normal functioning American citizen! Imagine such a miswired, incoherent babblehead as Trump being Chief in Command and President of the greatest nation on Earth?  Trump is also the candidate, who started using name calling, lies and disrespectful language in the presidential debate ‚Äì and that immediately told me ‚Äì that this guy is totally unfit to rule and he should be stopped!Thrump's actions has resulted in the current deplorable and unworthy presidential campaign. Trump will make America a much more unsafe and much poorer place to live with no community cohesion, whatsoever!Remember on voting day, November 8th, 2016 to vote for Hillary. Let me tell you this, Trump -  The end is near and now you face the final curtain - of that you can be very certain!

Now, her corrupt friends from among the bankers and certain corporations are trying to use the mainstream news media to make her president, as Hillary Clinton has promised to continue to further consolidate the economic interests of certain private corporations with the political interests of the US Government. The corporate interest groups and the media are trying to make her look good and sound experienced. But in reality Hillary Clinton is not good and she has never been good at anything. Hillary Clinton is very corrupt. She has been corrupt all along. That was the only way she and her disbarred husband could have made such big money to support their lavish life style that they so got used to. However, Hillary and Bill Clinton have gone too far.She sold government contracts and political influence to the highest bidder, which of course were the biggest banks and largest corporations that ravaged the country and caused the financial and economic crisis in the US and the world over! Her corruption threatens to destroy US economy and the very existence of the union. Incompetent as a state official and immensely corrupt as a career politician, HRC is not fit to be president by any measure! She is too dishonest, too corrupt, and too selfish and irresponsible to occupy the most demanding position in the world. HRC is simply a conduit for pouring more corporate money into the US government to make it responsible only to the biggest corporations and the biggest banks in the US and abroad. If Hillary Clinton was to be elected president of the United States, the American people and the nation as such would be completely neglected and left to ruin!
12 | Liberty Brown | 10154745817569729_10154746610074729 | Russian Cyber Attack?  how about liar? corrupt government?  I get it, they dont want all that garbage revealed, like Obama lying about NOT knowing about Clintons private servers...it was lie and its in the e-mails he DID know.  Or how about the FBI being pressured by the President so they would not take any legal action against Hillary? or how about the DNC plotting against Berny Sanders (and him having no backbone bending over and taking it even AFTER he found out about it) Hillary Clinton endagering National Security?  How about the Clinton campaign setting up protests to start violence at Trump Rallies?  Or how about the actually PROVEN sexual predator Bill Clinton getting meeting together with Loretta Lynch, corrupt Judge, before the FBI made a decision about the wrong use of private servers the Hillary used? How about the democrats caught ON camera talking about how to cheat in the elections?  Interesting how the media is more interested and upset about WHO hacked the e-mails more so than the e-mails THEMSELVES!? Thats like saying I hacked into my friends computer, found a bunch of pictures of children being sexually abused by him and calling the cops...but of course the cops will put ME in handcuffs for hacking his computer, not HIM for SEXUALLY ABUSING KIDS?  It is shameful and embarrassing how uneducated the American population is that they fall for this kind of corruption and one sided media

19 | Rebecca Laskey | 10154745817569729_10154746433204729 | CROOKED DONALD TRUMP AND THE TRUMP CRIME FAMILY Spent more than a quarter-million dollars from his charitable foundation to settle lawsuits that involved the billionaire‚Äôs for-profit businesses, according to interviews and a review of legal documents.Those cases, which together used $258,000 from Trump‚Äôs charity, were among four newly documented expenditures in which Trump may have violated laws against ‚Äúself-dealing‚Äù ‚Äî which prohibit nonprofit leaders from using charity money to benefit themselves or their businesses.In one case, from 2007, Trump‚Äôs Mar-a-Lago Club faced $120,000 in unpaid fines from the town of Palm Beach, Fla., resulting from a dispute over the size of a flagpole.In a settlement, Palm Beach agreed to waive those fines ‚Äî if Trump‚Äôs club made a $100,000 donation to a specific charity for veterans. Instead, Trump sent a check from the Donald J. Trump Foundation, a charity funded almost entirely by other people‚Äôs money, according to tax records.In another case, court papers say one of Trump‚Äôs golf courses in New York agreed to settle a lawsuit by making a donation to the plaintiff‚Äôs chosen charity. A $158,000 donation was made by the Trump Foundation, according to tax records.According to the report, Trump used Trump Foundation money, that would be money that was donated by other people to his charitable foundation to do charitable stuff, to pay for debts owed by Trump's personal businesses. This, however, is in keeping with Trump using Trump Foundation money for a political donation to Florida's Attorney General and to buy a portrait of him for his personal use. These all are covered by the IRS regulations prohibiting "self-dealing" by charitable organizations.New Information:  Trump asks those who owe him money to send it to his Trump Charity to avoid paying taxes on it.UPDATE: TRUMP DOES NOT HAVE THE PROPER CERTIFICATION TO SOLICIT OUTSIDE DONORS!  ANYTHING OVER $25,000 REQUIRES AN AUDIT ACCORDING TO THE NEW YORK AG.  UH OH‚Ä¶..TRUMP PAID $8.2 Million to Family Members/Businesses.  MONEY CAME FROM THOSE WHO CONTRIBUTE TO HIS CAMPAIGN.

1 | Donovan Reiner | 10154745788159729_10154745818759729 | Trickle down economics have been a failure. YUGE tax cuts for the very rich, large corporations and special interest groups have FAILED to stimulate  the economy.
2 | Kenneth Givens | 10154745788159729_10154745891569729 | Hey Pence, why do you conservatives hang on to failed economic policies? The Obama Administration last year saw the highest gains in income and wealth by the Middle class in history.

18 | Donovan Reiner | 10154745788159729_10154745806509729 | Pence, You're such an ass. The money sent to Iran was the return of a portion of Iran's own funds previously frozen by the US government back in 1979. We lost a decision in the world court and if the US failed to return funds would have been subjected to greater interest and penalties.

1 | John Davidson | 10154745428839729_10154745492194729 | Let's put the entire government on the same government option insurance as it offers its citizens and make a government option for all. Make private compete! VOTE BLUE
2 | Marti Eales-Kilby | 10154745428839729_10154745535994729 | If HRC gets elected she will be impeached in 6 months, and sent to prison. THis is what you will end up with. A turtle headed weasel for a president
3 | Bradley A. Hix | 10154745428839729_10154745466559729 | In the debate he said he was concerned with states killing convicted felons but had no problem with abortion. Pro-Abortion Catholic very rare and will never receive my vote.
4 | Suzanne Burch | 10154745428839729_10154745481204729 | Those emails are a joke. Russia has a hand in them so that automatically says they have doctored in some way to make her and her people look bad. Donald probably on on it from the beginning.  He's the crook
5 | Shannon Mendenhall | 10154745428839729_10154745852659729 | They're awful to watch, at times criminal in nature, but the rigged election tapes spell out Hillary everytime...so the simple folk can follow along too!

24 | Vance Voppleplith | 10154745428839729_10154745555574729 | right, he said we'd have to wait and see if Ivanka's tits are as nice as Melania's. He was talking about her when she was a baby.
25 | John Davidson | 10154745428839729_10154745467399729 | Donald, I recommend you fill out an application as an intern with Hillary's cabinet.

6 | Sergey Malovatov | 10154745154694729_10154745503754729 | The Sad True Story of Hillary ClintonThis is the sad story of Hillary Clinton: Hillary Clinton and her husband got very used to their luxurious life style while Bill was the President.However, after his presidency had ended, Bill Clinton having being disbarred for perjury, the Clintons could not continue their luxurious habits. They could not practice law, so Bill and Hillary Clinton decided to use their political connections to make real big money. They started lobbying the interests of the big banks and corporations!That is why Bill Clinton became the proponent of the notorious financial deregulation movement that eventually destroyed US economy. Bill and Hillary Clinton helped the largest banks have US financial industry essentially deregulated, which resulted in the 2008 financial crisis. The bankers were happy and the Clintons could enjoy the privileges of the upper class. From then on, Hillary Clinton dedicated her life to representing the interests of the big banks and corporations in exchange for money that was given to her and Bill in the form of payment for their speeches (hundreds of thousands of dollars per speech). When bigger money became involved, they created they family Clinton Foundation and the money started pouring in in the form of donations. Her criminal interactions had to be covered up. So, Hillary was using her private email servers for that purpose all along. That is why they deleted all those emails, as they were directly incriminating Hillary Clinton in many shady dealings including selling access to the US Government for their rich donors through the Clinton Foundation. Now, her corrupt friends from among the bankers and certain corporations are trying to use the mainstream news media to make her president. They try to make her look good and sound experienced. But she is not good and she has never been good at anything. She was corrupt all along. That was the only way she and her disbarred husband could have made big money to support their lavish life style they so got used to.She sold government contracts and political influence to the highest bidder, which of course were the biggest banks and largest corporations that ravaged the country and caused the financial and economic crisis in the US and the world over! Hillary Clinton is not fit to be president by any measure! She is too dishonest, corrupt, and selfish for the most demanding position in the world. Hillary Clinton is simply a conduit for pouring more corporate money into the US government to make it responsible only to the biggest corporations and the biggest banks in the US and abroad. The American people and the nation as such would be completely neglected and left to ruin.

What ever happened to 2-source verification.  Anything less equates to media bias and false representation.  Mainly, the Liberal Media has failed to honestly critique Democratic candidates at least on an equal basis as they do Republican candidates. The Liberal media engages in character assassination and they are doing it to hundreds of decent people across this country who totally reject their political beliefs. Not only is the Liberal Media complacent in character assassination...they are aiding and abetting in it's conduct.Since I disdain everything they stand for, I expect them to continue on with their assaults on Republican candidates across the country.  If people want to listen to an believe the trash they spout, then by all means do so.  But the Democratic Party sucks...anyone that is one of them and engaged in character assassination sucks, and I for one will never vote for even one Democrat because of it.  When they engage in character assassination using deceit and lies...that is what their subjects are voting for to represent them in our government.

12 | Rebecca Laskey | 10154742706819729_10154746475984729 | HARVARD HAS BROKEN A 128-YEAR OF VOTING REPUBLICAN, BECAUSE OF TRUMP!Dear Members and Alumni,In every presidential election since 1888, the members and Executive Board of the Harvard Republican Club have gathered to discuss, debate, and eventually endorse the standard-bearer of our party. But for the first time in 128 years, we, the oldest College Republicans chapter in the nation, will not be endorsing the Republican nominee.Donald Trump holds views that are antithetical to our values not only as Republicans, but as Americans. The rhetoric he espouses ‚Äìfrom racist slander to misogynistic taunts‚Äì is not consistent with our conservative principles, and his repeated mocking of the disabled and belittling of the sacrifices made by prisoners of war, Gold Star families, and Purple Heart recipients is not only bad politics, but absurdly cruel.If enacted, Donald Trump‚Äôs platform would endanger our security both at home and abroad. Domestically, his protectionist trade policies and draconian immigration restrictions would enlarge our federal deficit, raise prices for consumers, and throw our economy back into recession. Trump‚Äôs global outlook, steeped in isolationism, is considerably out-of-step with the traditional Republican stance as well. The flippancy with which he is willing to abdicate the United States‚Äô responsibility to lead is alarming. Calling for the US‚Äô withdrawal from NATO and actively endorsing nuclear proliferation, Donald Trump‚Äôs foreign policy would wreak havoc on the established world order which has held aggressive foreign powers in check since World War II.Perhaps most importantly, however, Donald Trump simply does not possess the temperament and character necessary to lead the United States through an increasingly perilous world. The last week should have made obvious to all what has been obvious to most for more than a year. In response to any slight ‚Äìperceived or real‚Äì Donald Trump lashes out viciously and irresponsibly. In Trump‚Äôs eyes, disagreement with his actions or his policies warrants incessant name calling and derision: stupid, lying, fat, ugly, weak, failing, idiot ‚Äìand that‚Äôs just his ‚Äúfellow‚Äù Republicans.He isn‚Äôt eschewing political correctness. He is eschewing basic human decency.Donald Trump, despite spending more than a year on the campaign trail, has either refused or been unable to educate himself on issues that matter most to Americans like us. He speaks only in platitudes, about greatness, success, and winning. Time and time again, Trump has demonstrated his complete lack of knowledge on critical matters, meandering from position to position over the course of the election. When confronted about these frequent reversals, Trump lies in a manner more brazen and shameless than anything politics has ever seen.Millions of people across the country are feeling despondent. Their hours have been cut, wages slashed, jobs even shipped overseas. But Donald Trump doesn‚Äôt have a plan to fix that. He has a plan to exploit that.Donald Trump is a threat to the survival of the Republic. His authoritarian tendencies and flirtations with fascism are unparalleled in the history of our democracy. He hopes to divide us by race, by class, and by religion, instilling enough fear and anxiety to propel himself to the White House. He is looking to to pit neighbor against neighbor, friend against friend, American against American. We will not stand for this vitriolic rhetoric that is poisoning our country and our children. President Reagan called on us to maintain this, our shining city on a hill. He called on us to maintain freedom abroad by keeping a strong presence in the world. He called on us to maintain liberty at home by upholding the democratic process and respecting our opponents. He called on us to maintain decency in our hearts by loving our neighbor.He would be ashamed of Donald Trump. We are too. This fall, we will instead focus our efforts on reclaiming the Republican Party from those who have done it considerable harm, campaigning for candidates who will uphold the conservative principles that have defined the Republican Party for generations. We will work to ensure both chambers of Congress remain in Republican hands, continuing to protect against executive overreach regardless of who wins the election this November.We call on our party‚Äôs elected leaders to renounce their support of Donald Trump, and urge our fellow College Republicans to join us in condemning and withholding their endorsement from this dangerous man. The conservative movement in America should not and will not go quietly into the night.A longtime student of American democracy, Alexis de Tocqueville once said, ‚ÄúAmerica is great because she is good. If America ceases to be good, America will cease to be great.‚Äù De Tocqueville believed in the United States. Americans are a decent people. We work hard, protect our own, and look out for one another in times of need, regardless of the color of our skin, the God we worship, or our party registration. Donald Trump may not believe in that America, but we do. And that America will never cease to be great.HILLARY CLINTON CANNOT TAKE AWAY SECOND AMENDMENT GUN RIGHTS WITHOUT APPROVAL OF CONGRESS.  HILLARY DOES NOT WANT TO ABOLISH YOUR 2ND AMENDMENT.  ANOTHER TRUMP LIE.AMERICA IS ALREADY GOOD AND WE ARE BETTER THAN DONALD TRUMP!REGISTER AND VOTE BLUE UP AND DOWN THE BALLOT.1st DEBATE ~ EPIC FAILURE ON DONALD TRUMP‚ÄôS PART!  AND THIS GUY WANTS TO BE PRESIDENT???  I DON‚ÄôT THINK SO!  HILLARY CLEARLY WON THE DEBATE, HANDS DOWN!!!#NeverTrumPutin#NoTaxesNoVote#NeverTrumpPence
13 | Rebecca Laskey | 10154742706819729_10154746475469729 | SO THE NARCISSISTIC PATHOLOGICAL SERIAL LIAR, THE GUY WHO ASSAULTS, RAPES AND DEMEANS WOMEN ASKS:  "WHAT THE HELL DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE"???As a Black, Muslim, Gay AND A Woman. EVERYTHING!!Here is why:1. The misogynistic pathetic small man has shown over and over again throughout his life he has zero respect for women. He has said cringe worthy horrible/outrageous things about women all his life. He has consistently insulted, belittled, sexualized, and stereotyped women. Such insecure small man with zero respect for women and their contributions to our society should have NO place holding the highest office in the land. And he has promised to nominate conservative justices who will limit women's reproductive rights & women's ability to make informed decisions about their own bodies. This is a man who believes women should be "punished" for having an abortion. And he promised to overturn Roe vs. Wade if he gets elected. Just a little history here: "In the 1950s, estimates of numbers of illegal, unsafe abortions ranged widely, from 200,000 to 1.2 million per year. The methods used were often ineffective and dangerous. Desperate women were driven into the back alley, where they endured danger and abuse, sometimes sexual." Access to safe, legal abortion saves women's lives. The reality is there‚Äôs no such thing as no abortion. Just safe & unsafe. As a woman I can NOT afford to have a president who will take us back decades on the progress we made on women's rights. So as a woman I have everything to lose. 2.  I was raised in a Muslim family, even though I no longer consider myself a practicing Muslim. So that xenophobic con man's hate-filled rhetoric is a direct attack on my family and I. So as a Muslim American, I can NOT have afforded to have a president as hateful and careless as him. This country does NOT afford to have a man whose xenophobic rhetoric is feeding terrorist groups like ISIS's recruitment videos. A man whose hate-filled rhetoric terrorist experts believe is detrimental to the counterterrorism and anti- terrorism missions around the world. History shows a leader who believe people should be treated differently based on their religion is dangerous. So as a Muslim American I have everything to lose. 3. As a black person I can NOT afford to have a racist person who refused to disavow Ku Klux Klan as a president. A person who was the leading voice of the ‚Äúbirther‚Äù movement, a racist effort to try to delegitimize the nation's first black president. A racist person who ignored Fair Housing Act and let his employees mark applications of minorities with a 'C' for 'Colored' & refused to rent or negotiate rentals ‚Äúbecause of race and color.‚Äù A racist person whose campaign is attracting scary number of neo-Nazi white supremacist organizations. A racist man whose campaign selected white nationalist leader as a delegate. A racist man who hired Breitbart News executive chairman Steve Bannon, a leader of white supremacist group as his campaign CEO signaling his campaign is fully embracing the white supremacist alt-right & all their race-baiting ideas. A racist person whose campaign rallies looks like a klan gathering. On top of that he promised to nominate conservative justices who will take us back decades on voting rights. So as a black American I have everything to lose. 4. As a lesbian I can NOT afforded to have a president who does NOT think I should marry whoever my heart desire. The LGBT community has made historic progress in the past few years, I cannot afford to have a president who will destroy all those progresses by nominating conservative justices who will turn the clock back years. So as a gay citizen, I have everything to lose. 5. As a proud citizen of this great country who believes in American values I can NOT afford to have a self-serving, greedy, pathological liar, con-man who is walking all over those values as a president. To the white people who are not motivated by hate and resentment but still support Trump, I as a minority would like to ask you to think about how Trump's presidency affect me and people like me. I would like to sincerely ask you to reconsider your support for him. Please. To the people who are planning to vote for a third party candidate: I would like to ask you to think really, really hard. Especially, if you care about progressive ideas and believe Trump presidency will take us back decades on the progress we have made on women issues, LGBT issues...etc. The fact is we are a two-party system, Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump will be America's next president. Period! And your vote could decide the next President. Simply put, a vote that is not for Hillary is directly or indirectly a vote for Trump. Just as a note, I am NOT saying Hillary is perfect or doesn't come with a lot of baggage. So if you believe the con-man is unqualified, temperamentally unfit, and dangerous please reconsider voting for Hillary Clinton and vote blue up and down the ballot.Trump and Pence show extreme contempt towards Gays, LGBT and LGBTQ.  Both on are record as being ANTI-GAY!A vote for Trump is a lost vote - he will not become the next president of The United States of America!It is paramount that The President of The United States of America is a sane, intelligent, curious, controlled person, who is a reliable, detail-oriented, steadfast, cautious and methodical person without whom organizations and society would dissolve (fall apart). Hillary fits the aforementioned description! She is a woman, who can keep her cool!Trump on the other hand is non-reflecting and ruthless character, who lacks emphatic traits under non-sexual circumstances. He is extremely nervous and very emotional driven. He completely lacks self-knowledge! He is little bothered by second thoughts and self-doubt. That doesn't mean he is smart but that he is rather dumb. His knowledge is in general extremely limited. Since he does not reflect on his errors or analyze any mistakes to any great extent - Trump is incapable to learn from his errors, and so he will be caught in a loop, repeating his mistakes, which can have catastrophic consequences for the US, the rest of the world and possible beyond depending on the nature of his actions.In all fairness in the Vice Presidential debate Tuesday night, October 4, 2016, Mike Pence acted far more "vice presidential" than Tim Kaine, who was rude and insulting as well as he was talking over Mike Pence, who just had to sit there and take it.HOWEVER, Trump would still do the right thing if he voluntarily steps down from the presidential election campaign. Whether he steps down or not he will not be elected as the next President of The United States of America!DONALD TRUMP TRIED TO FIRE NANCY O‚ÄôDELL AFTER SHE REJECTED HIS ADVANCES!  HOW COME HE HASN‚ÄôT APOLOGIZED TO HER?  HIS APOLOGY MEANS NOTHING !!!PROMINATE GOP LEADERS ARE DITCHING DONALD TRUMP IS DROVES.

They could not practice law, so Bill and Hillary Clinton decided to use their political connections to make real big money. They started lobbying the interests of the big banks and corporations!That is why Bill Clinton became the proponent of the notorious financial deregulation movement that eventually destroyed US economy. Bill and Hillary Clinton helped the largest banks have US financial industry essentially deregulated, which resulted in the 2008 financial crisis. The bankers were happy and the Clintons could enjoy the privileges of the upper class. From then on, Hillary Clinton dedicated her life to representing the interests of the big banks and corporations in exchange for money that was given to her and Bill in the form of payment for their speeches (hundreds of thousands of dollars per speech). When bigger money became involved, they created they family Clinton Foundation and the money started pouring in in the form of donations. Her criminal interactions had to be covered up. So, Hillary was using her private email servers for that purpose all along. That is why they deleted all those emails, as they were directly incriminating Hillary Clinton in many shady dealings including selling access to the US Government for their rich donors through the Clinton Foundation. Now, her corrupt friends from among the bankers and certain corporations are trying to use the mainstream news media to make her president. They try to make her look good and sound experienced. But she is not good and she has never been good at anything. She was corrupt all along. That was the only way she and her disbarred husband could have made big money to support their lavish life style they so got used to.She sold government contracts and political influence to the highest bidder, which of course were the biggest banks and largest corporations that ravaged the country and caused the financial and economic crisis in the US and the world over! Hillary Clinton is not fit to be president by any measure! She is too dishonest, corrupt, and selfish for the most demanding position in the world. Hillary Clinton is simply a conduit for pouring more corporate money into the US government to make it responsible only to the biggest corporations and the biggest banks in the US and abroad. The American people and the nation as such would be completely neglected and left to ruin.

1 | Rob Visconti | 10154742357979729_10154742479459729 | Republicans stay home and boycott the election if it is rigged. What's the point? You say it's rigged after all. Democrats and Independents will take care of all the voting on Election Day for you Republicans:
2 | Kevin Lynch | 10154742357979729_10154742521859729 | Guilianni has been bitch in about dead people voting. If it was a problem then the Republicans would not have been elected to run the country for the past ten yrs.Few understand that it is the obstructionist Republicans who have stopped American progress.They are also at fault for the opiate problem as they were paid by pharmaceuticals to allow the problem.
3 | Danny Babcock | 10154742357979729_10154742825034729 | I've watched five (CBS) ‚ÄúLive‚Äù, full telecasts of Trump rallies, and what I saw was a Lunatic in action! Wow! Trump is absolutely insane.... get the net! Wow... he's come unglued! Add to that, Trump's starting his Excuses Phase right now. He knows he's in trouble, so it's the Media, it‚Äôs the Clintons, it‚Äôs the Establishment, his shorts are too tight, it‚Äôs the rigged and corrupt system that's doing it to Trump. If the election could be rigged, the GOP sure as hell wouldn‚Äôt have Trump as their nominee right now. What an Absolute fool... he is listening to the voices coming to him on the aluminum foil receiver in his red hat.

All planned by the fascist New World Order elites!IT IS CALLED PROPAGANDA PEOPLE PLAIN AND SIMPLE IT IS PROPAGANDA...Showing Hillary Leading by Double Digits IS TOTAL FRAUDS.It felt wrong‚Ä¶.. and now we know for a fact our skepticism was correct.

Donald Trump's running mate Mike Pence is touring the firebombed campaign offices in Hillsborough, N.C. Watch live video.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Kim Mie | 10154741973234729_10154742026059729 | My intuition tells me Evidence will eventually show this was done by a paid Trumpf supporter but that party likes to blame Dems for their actions.
2 | Cynthia K. Turner | 10154741973234729_10154742198984729 | Pence is nuts just like Trump. He too is pushing conspiracy theory that election is rigged. Its called projection. Yes, it's rigged by not against Republicans. Its rigged against Democrats. Voter supression tactics throughout the U.S. are alive and well. Why? Because most states are controlled by Republicans. Now this is fact.
3 | Kevin Lynch | 10154741973234729_10154742502749729 | Puppet Pence in case you missed it let me bring you up to datenTrump hijacked the Republican party. Trump then attempted to turn the general election into a Jerry Springer special edition and it exploded in his face as out came 17 women that were sexually assaulted by the wealthy Trump after he said that he can grab the pus-- because he is wealthy.
4 | Cheryl Heymans | 10154741973234729_10154742001649729 | And has there been evidence that "Hillary's animals" were to blame?Pence/Trump are as much embarrassments to America as Hillary/Kaine are but for different reasons. Thank goodness we have a better choice - Jill Stein!
5 | Di Roy | 10154741973234729_10154742094874729 | Pence just said that a man always slept on that sofa every night -- let me guess, he was out setting the fire that night!! Do they think everyone is uneducated and deplorable?
6 | Patricia Holtby | 10154741973234729_10154742012554729 | Did he mention it was the Democrats who raised the money to rebuild the office?
7 | Annie Mendelsohn | 10154741973234729_10154741977169729 | Pence lied 78% of the time during his debate, don't believe anything he says he is lacking values.
8 | Randy Goldstein | 10154741973234729_10154742062019729 | It's not often i agree with Pence. He's right that the media should not blame the victims of violence as the first question clearly did. For the sake of polite political discourse, it would have been nice had he mentioned the $13,000 Dems raise to help rebuild the office.http://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2016-37673802
9 | Bob N. Batchelder | 10154741973234729_10154742048224729 | Pence could not bring himself to thank local Democrats for their fund raising to collect over $10,000 to repair the damage
10 | Frances Scott | 10154741973234729_10154744589734729 | Joe Hall1 hr ¬∑ CNN reporting from Las Vegas this morning that Trump will try to use his debate performance to resurrect his 'struggling' campaign....these political hacks and bought and paid for wanna be journalists are disgusting and despicable....please define 'struggling' for me if you will...do you mean overflow crowds at every venue....do you mean lots and lots of money coming in by small donations from real Americans and not from the mega bankers and Wall Street goons....do you mean tremendous energy and passion and enthusiasm displayed by Mr. Trump and his supporters??? Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton arrives in Vegas and walks down the stairs from her plane and into her waiting car like a zombie...wearing shades to cover the bags under her eyes....lots of work in the spa today and with the makeup artist and the drug pusher!! American journalism is dead....and will possibly never recover because real America does not trust the media and with good reason. Want a real scare....just think if we did not have the internet and social media. Now I am going to 'struggle' down to the our old country store for coffee with the farmers and old farts like me. Blessings!!

17 | Beth Lynn Stephens | 10154741973234729_10154741989754729 | This is a one sided election. Either be for Hillary or else.
18 | John Taylor | 10154741973234729_10154742003284729 | Great recession was a financial fraud that BANKSTERS are doing time for in Iceland and Ireland BUT NOT here...it bankrupted millions while Obama looked the other way now Hillary is looking the other way....Average wage in expensive cities is $42k rents $1800...immigrants a cheap resource for rich businesses who pay just ten cents in wages for every DOLLAR they make...tuition degrees cost $70k people buried in student loans and credit card debt after being cheated by employers...govt can make FAIR WAGE legislation to tie wages to PROFITS and as TRUMP has suggested exempt those making under $50k from taxes!
19 | Sergey Malovatov | 10154741973234729_10154745505549729 | The Sad True Story of Hillary ClintonThis is the sad story of Hillary Clinton: Hillary Clinton and her husband got very used to their luxurious life style while Bill was the President.However, after his presidency had ended, Bill Clinton having being disbarred for perjury, the Clintons could not continue their luxurious habits. They could not practice law, so Bill and Hillary Clinton decided to use their political connections to make real big money. They started lobbying the interests of the big banks and corporations!That is why Bill Clinton became the proponent of the notorious financial deregulation movement that eventually destroyed US economy. Bill and Hillary Clinton helped the largest banks have US financial industry essentially deregulated, which resulted in the 2008 financial crisis. The bankers were happy and the Clintons could enjoy the privileges of the upper class. From then on, Hillary Clinton dedicated her life to representing the interests of the big banks and corporations in exchange for money that was given to her and Bill in the form of payment for their speeches (hundreds of thousands of dollars per speech). When bigger money became involved, they created they family Clinton Foundation and the money started pouring in in the form of donations. Her criminal interactions had to be covered up. So, Hillary was using her private email servers for that purpose all along. That is why they deleted all those emails, as they were directly incriminating Hillary Clinton in many shady dealings including selling access to the US Government for their rich donors through the Clinton Foundation. Now, her corrupt friends from among the bankers and certain corporations are trying to use the mainstream news media to make her president. They try to make her look good and sound experienced. But she is not good and she has never been good at anything. She was corrupt all along. That was the only way she and her disbarred husband could have made big money to support their lavish life style they so got used to.She sold government contracts and political influence to the highest bidder, which of course were the biggest banks and largest corporations that ravaged the country and caused the financial and economic crisis in the US and the world over! Hillary Clinton is not fit to be president by any measure! She is too dishonest, corrupt, and selfish for the most demanding position in the world. Hillary Clinton is simply a conduit for pouring more corporate money into the US government to make it responsible only to the biggest corporations and the biggest banks in the US and abroad. The American people and the nation as such would be completely neglected and left to ruin.
20 | Tim Janke | 10154741973234729_10154742061889729 | Not QUITE the Reichstag.

22 | D M Morrison | 10154741973234729_10154745084184729 | Is this the HQ that the Dems raised money to rebuild?
23 | Blogging Dan | 10154741973234729_10154741978334729 | Trump knows how most Americans live? Oh, c'mon kid.
24 | Dale Leier | 10154741973234729_10154742386324729 | Hillary did it...she donned her costume and climbed on her broomstick late at night, flew across the country, and then dropped it down the chimney if the Trumpkins are to be believed.

1 | Henrik Ahlm | 10154741833964729_10154741846624729 | As I have said for weeks - Trump will not be elected as the next President of The United States of America! First of all ‚Äì the majority of people in America are sane, clever people. Secondly, Melania Trump just openly admitted, that Trump was ‚Äúegged on‚Äù by Billy Bush to ‚Äúsay dirty and bad stuff.‚Äù Who on Earth would vote for a man, who is so easily provoked (I have seen this as a part of his nature for a long time and that is why Trump currently is imploding)? Imagine such a miswired individual being Chief in Command and President of the greatest nation on Earth. Trump is also the candidate, who started using name calling, lies and disrespectful language in the presidential debate ‚Äì and that immediately told me ‚Äì that this guy is totally unfit to rule and he should be stopped!Thrump's actions has resulted in the current deplorable and unworthy presidential campaign. Furthermore, recent research shows, that "Trump‚Äôs discourse is mobilizing people around a certain way of understanding the nation: one that‚Äôs culturally exclusionary, and one that sees America as being in deep trouble.‚ÄùIt is very understandable that the media is bashing Trump ‚Äì because he is an unwanted pest! Remember on voting day, November 8th, 2016 to vote for Hillary. Let me tell you this, Trump - The end is near and now you face the final curtain - of that you can be very certain!

Scary, isn't it?"If we needed any confirmation that Donald Trump is wholly unfit for the office of President of the United States, yesterday‚Äôs Anderson Cooper interview with Melania Trump cemented that fact."Sometimes I say I have two boys at home -- I have my young son and I have my husband.‚ÄùHer son, Barron, is 10 years old.Never mind that Melania Trump also suggested that her husband would make patently offensive statements intimating sexual assault because someone ‚Äúegged him on,‚Äù and then went on to dismiss her then-59-year-old husband‚Äôs suggestions of sexual assault as ‚Äúboy talk.‚ÄùIf I were in the Clinton campaign, I would take Melania Trump‚Äôs comments about having ‚Äútwo boys at home‚Äù and make it into an ad showing Donald with Barron with their ages beneath their images. The closing line of this short ad would be:Do we want someone with the maturity of a 10-year-old making decisions in the Oval Office?This stuff writes itself.QUIT WHINING ABOUT ‚ÄúRIGGED ELECTIONS‚Äù TRUMP.

1 | Aggie Marseu | 10154741290964729_10154741499094729 | What a sore loser ! When things go his way he is ok and when it goes down he starts blaming everything except him ,the main culprit! A typical childish behavior that we only associate with kids ! But it's true , when you are that age you tend to behave like a child ! Please just check his diapers , he needs to be changed ! üò≥
2 | Dianne Shenton | 10154741290964729_10154741463954729 | It is so aggravating to hear analysts say "...if Trump wants to turn this around he needs to blah, blah, blah..." because it assumes that he wants to be president. He doesn't NEED to do a damn thing differently to accomplish his goal, which has never, not for a second, been to actually be president.He has always been in the Image, Power and Influence business. He is now in the Revolution business. So please, stop saying he needs to do anything differently than he has his whole life. This is not brain science and he is not unpredictable. He is perhaps the most predictable person alive to anyone who has paid attention.
3 | Justin Bacon | 10154741290964729_10154742336249729 | I'm not a fan of either candidate.. but Wikileaks has PROVEN that the elections are rigged.... So Quit With The Cognitive Dissidence...
4 | Glenn Hassig | 10154741290964729_10154745499514729 | Rigging the election is not just at the voting booth itself. Look how the DNC, Hillary and the corporate media systematically manipulated the primary against Sanders! It was a clear case of insider establishment deciding who should run for President. Hell there are emails to prove it. Yet no charges were filed but our freedom to vote was clearly manipulated by the combined establishment. So don't you think for a moment the election process is not rigged.
5 | Ayanda Abiodun Fountain | 10154741290964729_10154741535064729 | If trully there is any rigging by the Demos, it was Trump himself that,chose to be used as the rigging machine, check it out, how on earth did a bad market like Trump out-sell the likes of Dr Ben Carson, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz etc if he is not a rigging machine? So the truth is that if there is anything called rigging here, it has already been concluded long before/with the emergence of Trump as the nominee. So we can confortably say that Trump conive to rig for the Demos to ensure Hillary become POTUS for him to get his secretly proposed media house the required audience.
6 | Glenn Hassig | 10154741290964729_10154741614744729 | Trump is a jerk and should not be in the White House for sure! But he is not completely wrong about the system being rigged. Look at how vicious Hillary and the DNC were to Sanders. Sanders was attacked by the establishment and the media with a vengeance. Hillary is nothing but a jaw dropping arrogant political operator with the full government behind her. So yes maybe as a country we should look at a third or fourth party system to stem another election that is humiliating our country
7 | Daniel Kron | 10154741290964729_10154741406629729 | I think it's quite obvious what he's doing. He knows he's losing bad. But he can't ever admit he lost at something. So he creates this fake narrative, so he won't ever have t concede when he gets crushed. He doesn't care if he causes massive damage to the integrity of the American voter in the process.He's such a loser. I can't wait until Nov 9th when he flounders around after losing but can't admit it. It'll be like watching a fish gasp for air outside of water

What DEPLORABLE conduct, Mr. Trump.
10 | Brian Johnston | 10154741290964729_10154741296664729 | The only way it was "rigged" is that Bill Clinton convinced a thin-skinned racist to run and the media pushed him enough so that with only a plurality, he won the GOP nomination.
11 | Elvia Coronel | 10154741290964729_10154741594379729 | Hillaryious Clintonris , all americans can see that you are so worried because all americans and latin americans know who you are already. Please, change that awful face and renounce to the presidency with dignity. You are a corrupt, American Justice is in favor of you. Your crimes are many but you and your supporters with your money have paid this fraud. Hillaryious Clintonris should be in jail already and she shouldn't laugh at all americans anymore.

13 | Naveena Nirada | 10154741290964729_10154741388224729 | Actually there is evidence the GOP primaries were rigged. Russian hackers handed Trump the nomination.

1 | Danny Babcock | 10154738705389729_10154740781049729 | Trump is coming unglued! The man is insane. He brings the Tasmanian-Devil to mind, he acts and talks just like the cartoon character. Trump has NO moral compass. Trump has been spewing bigotry, hate‚Ä¶ and sexism throughout his entire campaign and that kind of crap taints the GOP and people who associate with Trump. Many top Republicans have commented repeatedly on his ridiculous remarks, and they keep coming every day! I thought the Republican Party was losing its‚Äô way when the Tea Party got its way into the party‚Ä¶ but Trump (LOL)... is the GOP‚Äôs Armageddon. Republican running for office right now‚Ä¶ if they endorsed him, they're screwed‚Ä¶ if they stay silent about his ridiculous behavior they are screwed. It sure looks like there will be a lot of Republicans in trouble at the polls in a few weeks. The anti-trump drums are strong.

15 | Sergey Malovatov | 10154738705389729_10154739221629729 | We are supposed to believe the MSM along with the DNC. They say that HRC is winning so nothing to see here. However, that is not so! November 8th is going to resemble the 1980 election of Reagan. People are getting increasingly furious with the corruption at the highest levels of Government.Top 10 Clinton scandals exposed by WikiLeaksThe ongoing WikiLeaks dump of Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign chairman John Podesta‚Äôs emails has exposed the corruption and cronyism of her campaign and time in office. Everyday there are more revelations of wrongdoing, so much so, it‚Äôs hard to keep up with. So here‚Äôs the top 10 double-dealing, dishonest discoveries uncovered thus far.1. Mrs. Clinton had cozy and improper relationship with the mainstream media.CNN contributor and then adviser of the Democratic National Committee Donna Brazile gave the Clinton campaign advanced notice of a CNN town hall question that she thought may give Mrs. Clinton pause. Mrs. Clinton‚Äôs campaign lauded a New York Times reporter for ‚Äúteeing up‚Äù stories for them, and ABC‚Äôs George Stephanopoulos for hammering home their talking points. The Boston Globe helped Mrs. Clinton‚Äôs team maximize her presence in New England during the primaries and CNBC‚Äôs John Harwood bragged to them about dogging Donald Trump during a Republican primary debate he moderated.2. The State Department paid special attention to ‚ÄúFriends of Bill.‚ÄùAfter the massive 2010 Haiti earthquake, a senior aide to then-Secretary of State Clinton repeatedly gave special attention to those identified by the abbreviations ‚ÄúFOB‚Äù (Friends of Bill) or ‚ÄúWJC VIPs‚Äù (William Jefferson Clinton VIPs), referring to the former president. The emails show Mrs. Clinton‚Äôs State Department prioritized and benefited Mr. Clinton‚Äôs friends in the $10 billion recovery effort. The State Department also polled the popularity of Mr. Clinton in Haiti and shared the results with him.3. Mrs. Clinton argued for ‚Äúa hemispheric common market with open trade and open borders.‚Äù Mrs. Clinton‚Äôs dream for America looks a lot like the European Union. She reportedly told investors in a paid speech to Brazilian Banco Itau in 2013: ‚ÄúMy dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders, sometime in the future with energy that‚Äôs as green and sustainable as we can get it, powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere.‚Äù Without borders, there are no countries, including the United States.4. The Clinton campaign was in touch with Department of Justice officials regarding the release of her emails.Brian Fallon, Mrs. Clinton‚Äôs spokesman and former Justice Department staffer, appeared to have discussions with sources inside the DOJ about ongoing open records lawsuits requesting access to her emails while serving as secretary of state. In an email from May 2015, Mr. Fallon said that ‚ÄúDOJ folks‚Äù had ‚Äúinformed‚Äù him about the upcoming status conference in one of the lawsuits.5. The Clinton camp was tipped off to the release of the Benghazi emails.In April 2015, Clinton campaign Deputy Communications Director Kristina Schake referred to a ‚Äútip‚Äù from a source regarding when the State Department planned to release Mrs. Clinton‚Äôs Benghazi emails. Mrs. Clinton‚Äôs lawyer Heather Samuelson followed up on the tip, writing: ‚ÄúLatest: Still aiming for Friday, but potential it gets delayed until early next week because still moving through interagency review process. Will check back tomorrow and keep you posted. Quick update on this ‚Äî DOS says the release of the 300 will likely happen on Thurs or Friday. Will keep you posted as I hear anything further on my end. Thx.‚Äù6. Mrs. Clinton admitted sometimes her public and private positions differ.In a 2013 speech before the National Multi-Housing Council, Mrs. Clinton indicated her public positions may differ with her private positions, because politics is an ugly business.‚ÄúPolitics is like sausage being made,‚Äù Mrs. Clinton said. ‚ÄúIt is unsavory, and it always has been that way, but we usually end up where we need to be. But if everybody‚Äôs watching, you know, all of the backroom discussions and the deals, you know, then people get a little nervous, to say the least. So, you need both a public and a private position.‚Äù7. Mrs. Clinton‚Äôs spokesman mocked Catholics and evangelicals as ‚Äúseverely backwards.‚ÄùHacked emails show Mrs. Clinton‚Äôs campaign spokeswoman Jennifer Palmieri and other Clinton allies openly talking about Catholics being ‚Äúseverely backwards‚Äù and charging that they don‚Äôt know ‚Äúwhat the hell they‚Äôre talking about.‚Äù The April 2011 discussion between Ms. Palmieri and John Halpin, a senior fellow at the liberal Center for American Progress, mocks media mogul Rupert Murdoch for raising his children in the Catholic Church and said that most ‚Äúpowerful elements‚Äù in the conservative movement are all Catholic.8. Mrs. Clinton admitted she has a hard time relating to the struggles of the middle class.In a 2014 speech for Goldman Sachs and BlackRock, Mrs. Clinton admitted her riches and public persona lifestyle isolated her from the financial struggles of most of the country, saying her memories of her childhood is how she connects now to everyday Americans.‚ÄúObviously, I‚Äôm kind of far removed because the life I‚Äôve lived and the economic, you know, fortunes that my husband and I now enjoy,‚Äù Mrs. Clinton said of relating to the middle class.9. Mrs. Clinton campaign used Benghazi as a distraction from the email scandal.Mrs. Clinton‚Äôs campaign tried to make her email scandal disappear during the Benghazi probe by trying to conflate and confuse the two separate incidents. Mr. Podesta told aides in March 2015 to steer the media‚Äôs attention from the email scandal to the House Benghazi investigation, which they felt had already been painted in the media as a Republican witch hunt.10. The Clinton team strategized on how to delay releasing emails, knowing it was against the law.After receiving a subpoena for her emails, Clinton insider Phillipe Reines in March 2015 discussed strategies to use as an excuse not to release all of her emails. It appeared to constitute a conscious effort of the Clinton camp to frustrate and delay a congressional subpoena. Mr. Reines said of the emails: ‚ÄúNot flippantly, and maybe just from Nick‚Äôs [Merrill, Clinton spokesman] mouth ‚Äî but rather than going around on how to release the 55k let‚Äôs just be for what‚Äôs happening and use this as an excuse. Because we can say even if State has equities, not providing them would put her in legal jeopardy OR we can say happy for them to have it, happy for them to have them as soon as State is comfortable.‚Äùhttp://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/oct/12/top-10-hillary-clinton-scandals-exposed-wikileaks/

18 | Sergey Malovatov | 10154738705389729_10154741502764729 | Hillary Clinton No Longer Qualifies as Public OfficialHillary Clinton's political career is essentially over. In light of all the recent revelations, Hillary Clinton can no longer qualify as a public official of any rank, let alone as President of the United States of America.Hillary Clinton is a wobbly walking scandal and political cadaver propped up by her totally rigged campaign and propaganda stilts of corrupt liberal-biased globalist mainstream media. Politically weak and professionally insignificant in her own right, Hillary Clinton has become a true national disaster of unparalleled corruption and a national despondency worse than almost any of similar political scandals of recent history in the US!Right now, almost verybody is convinced that you cannot trust HRC! Almost everybody is aware of the fact that HRC is a horrible, double-faced person! Her reputation could not be worse these days. She is hated by very many people in the US.However, the mainstream media fails to explain it to all the voters that Hillary Rodham Clinton is actually a federal criminal who is waiting to be indicted! Nobody really explains how she became so corrupted and insincere that Hillary Clinton ended up violating federal laws and obstructing justice. The email scandal has also pointed to the fact that she has been so corrupt and incompetent as secretary of state that HRC ended up selling access to US Government to various criminals and foreign individuals and governments, including those that oppress women and support and uphold the notorious radical Islamic terrorists (ISIS, Al Nusra, etc.) in the ME. Thereby HRC undermined the US standing on the international arena and compromized national security while shamelessly and brazenly enriching herself, her family, and her donors through her family's Clinton Foundation.According to the emails revealed by WikiLeaks, HRC and her corrupt political friends have always put Hillary Clinton's selfish interests, and the interests of her corrupt donors before the interests of the nation and the American people. If anything, HRC is completely unfit to be president of the United States. And no ammount of political correctness on her part can set off the danger that Hillary Clinton's negative, criminal experience and her highly questionable track record as senator, secretary of state, and career politician pose to the nation and its peoples.

My decision to vote against Trump is not about politic this year, it's about the facts that I reject the hatred, division and misogyny that has been a very unfortunate part of his campaign. However please Vote your own conscience, I have, even if it's different from mine My Friends. America will remain great regardless who is elected. God bless America üá∫üá∏

23 | AVenita Ghale | 10154738705389729_10154738799989729 | So, if nobody wants Stein or Johnson, and their incredibly low numbers attest to this, and less than a majority wants Clinton or Trump what should we do?  Do we sit around and do nothing for the next four years?  That doesn't seem like it would work out too well, even though the Republican controlled Congress, House and Senate have shown it can be done. No, we elect the person 1) least likely to do irreparable damage to the country, and 2) least likely to be escorted out of the White House in a straightjacket.  After this election I challenge everyone to learn each parties platforms so we don't have all this fighting and hatred the next presidential election.
