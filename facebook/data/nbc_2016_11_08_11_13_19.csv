1 | Onofre Gutierrez Jr. | 39 | 1562017377151620_1562024583817566 | so basically what's she wants is vote by the content of their skin color and gender and not by their policies and the content of their character? Yup... She's definitely still lives in the government's plantation.
2 | Margie Jones Grundy | 7 | 1562017377151620_1562024860484205 | The great irony (and beautiful karma) of this election will be that a Muslim father, a Latino beauty, a black president, and a whole army of older, educated white women will bring the downfall and complete humiliation of Trump.....(a comment worthy of cut and paste).
3 | Gudrun Krause | 2 | 1562017377151620_1562028183817206 | How wonderful for her to be able to do that. After all she has been through she can freely voice her opinion and vote. Who she votes for is nobody's business. That she is able to do so is amazing. The comments are disrespectful and nasty. Would be interesting to know if any one of you would talk to your grandmother that way or to that lady's face. Probably not.

5 | Beverly Steele | 0 | 1562017377151620_1562029973817027 | Trump is the only political hope for America. If Hilary is elected we will lose our country to the globalists who will turn this world quickly into a socialistic tyranny via the United Nations and many other globalist organizations. The globalists will reduce America into a third world country and strip her of her military and economic power. Wake UP, America / ... Hillary Clinton has said publicly that she sees Australia’s gun confiscation as a successful model that should be considered in the United States. Americans should remain alert to attacks on their 2nd Amendment rights. The important issues including religious liberty, abortion and the Supreme Court, marriage, terrorism, 2 Amendment, freedom of speech, illegal immigrants, Constitution, Support for Veterans, Common Core Education, Military Budget and more.
6 | Regina Anderson | 2 | 1562017377151620_1562028370483854 | POINTS TO PONDER BEFORE ELECTION DAY :If you are Gay, why are you voting for Hillary? She wants to bring in hundreds of thousands of refugees that believe all Gays should be executed.If you are Black, why are you voting for Hillary? She admires Margaret Sanger and defends Planned Parenthood. They want to abort as many black babies as possible. "Exterminate the Black Race because they are like weeds." Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.If you are a Christian, why are you voting for Hillary Clinton? She wrote her Senior Thesis on Saul Alinsky. He dedicated his book "Rules for Radicals" to Lucifer, The Devil? She says he was and still is her mentor.If you are a Veteran, in the military, or closely related to a military member, why are you voting for Hillary? She left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again. They called for help but the help was told to stand down.If you have factory job, why are you voting for Hillary? She supported TPP. Factory workers are being laid off because jobs are going overseas. Don't forget the deals she made with China. She also welcomes open borders and for illegals to get benefits with YOUR tax money.If you are poor, why are you voting for Hillary? She is supporting Wall street and all the big banks. Big banks keep the poor, poor by destroying the poor man's credit by allowing medical bills and collections to affect your credit scores so you can pay higher interest rates than the rich. - Taking as much of the little money you earn.If you are a woman, how can you vote for Hillary? She has buried all of Bill's rape victims under the rug. Remember the little girl that was raped? She defended the rapist and laughed about it later.If you carry a gun, and believe in the Constitution, how can you vote for Hillary? She wants to eliminate the NRA, take your guns, and abolish the second amendment.If you breathe, why would you vote for Hillary? She has left a trail of dead people that did not agree with her or knew too much!Who is left?

8 | Susan Long | 12 | 1562017377151620_1562019147151443 | It would give her the pleasure of having a president that looks at her and thinks "ni**er", and calls her sons/grandsons super predators.

12 | Denise A Spencer | 14 | 1562017377151620_1562017497151608 | It's not government that is the problem... it's the republican fascists that we elect to run it who intend to use it for the benefit of an oligarch that is the problem. Government is the only power that can stand up to corporations and the oligarch. Those that attack government are the ones trying to destroy it for a fascists form of oligarchy.... we still have government, just run by corporate power.... what republican and Trumps policy is....
13 | Catherine Sharp Roper | 5 | 1562017377151620_1562022213817803 | But that's not the reason to vote, just bc it would be the first female president
14 | Mike Wright | 7 | 1562017377151620_1562018137151544 | Get the cancer out of government. Vote out the true crooks. Vote out congress. Most seats are up for reelection. They get paid to rig the system. They have no term limits. They are the real disease. THIS IS the political revolution. Without a corrupt congress, a corrupt president has no power.
15 | Sandra Cantwell Cugler | 2 | 1562017377151620_1562026967150661 | Keep her alive for 4 more years... maybe someone with morals will be running.

17 | Tharold Bitser | 2 | 1562017377151620_1562020697151288 | New polls are indicating the beginning of a Trump sweep across the USA. Clinton voters are no where to be found and appear to be merely media hype that is collapsing like an empty shell.
18 | Brandon Smith | 2 | 1562017377151620_1562027380483953 | So she's just a typical Democrat MLK Dream killer.  Last time she voted for "Color of Skin" and this time she'll vote for "Content of Gender!"  You can't fix stupid!

If you can not follow the rules, then I suggest in your first 100 days in office (if you get the chance) you need to take a long hard look at all the people that have been put in prison for a fraction of what you and all the crooked politicians have done and release them! You do not stand for America or the American people! You make me SICK!

I went to vote and the gentleman in front of me (behind the curtain) selected a write-in but apparently hit the wrong button so he called for the attendant who did not know how to correct the situation so she called over to the other attendants and the man (in his best Nancy Pelosi voice) said push the button and "see what happens." Really? That's the level of competence at the polling location here. Well what happened was it registered part of his voting selections but they had no idea to to correct it and couldn't figure out whether to let him vote again or allow his partial selections. Not one attendant there knew how to handle the situation which was unfortunately not a surprise. Run Forrest Run!

I don't feel safe with racists running around with guns pretending to be protectors of people.  I don't feel safe with humans draining the earths blood and burning it in the air for energy while poisoning the life giving oxygen we breath.

We have seen him evidencing dangerous tendencies that threaten the bedrock of democracy: unleashing a lynch mob mentality against protestors, calling for the expulsion of Muslims from the country, bullying, and fear-mongering.History has shown us what happens when people refuse to stand against hate-filled leaders.We pledge ourselves to speak out in every way possible against the politics of hate and exclusion he represents.

Donald Trump did not quadruple the price of food. Trump is not stirring a race war. Trump did not leave any US soldiers in Benghazi to be slaughtered and desecrated by Muslims. Trump did not send the US Navy to fight for Syrian Al-Qaeda. Trump did not arm ISIS and systematically exterminate Christians throughout the Middle East. Trump did not betray Israel. Trump did not provide financing and technology to Iran's nuclear weapons program. Trump did not give our military secrets to China. Trump did not remove our nuclear missile shield in Poland at the behest of Russia. Trump did not shrivel our military, and betray our veterans. Trump did not cripple our economy. Trump did not increase our debt to 20 trillion dollars. Trump did not ruin our credit, twice. Trump did not double African American unemployment. Trump did not increase welfare to a record level for eight years. Trump did not sign a law making it legal to execute, and imprison Americans. Trump did not set free all of terrorists in Guantanamo bay. Trump did not steal your rights, violate US Constitutional law, or commit treason, hundreds of times.

A second Clinton in the White will likely include at least one, and possibly two Supreme Court appointments. This will put our Second Amendment Rights, among others, in grave jeopardy.

The woman I spoke to was stumped...put me on hold for about 10 minutes....and, said: "Ma'am, we received your ballot on October 30." Had I not insisted, she would have let the issue go. My ballot is "being investigated" and someone will call me. No one has called. I just want to know my vote counted. I voted for Jill Stein -- a vote I was PROUD to cast!

Donald Trump did not quadruple the price of food. Trump is not stirring a race war. Trump did not leave any US soldiers in Benghazi to be slaughtered and desecrated by Muslims. Trump did not send the US Navy to fight for Syrian Al-Qaeda. Trump did not arm ISIS and systematically exterminate Christians throughout the Middle East. Trump did not betray Israel. Trump did not provide financing and technology to Iran's nuclear weapons program. Trump did not give our military secrets to China. Trump did not remove our nuclear missile shield in Poland at the behest of Russia. Trump did not shrivel our military, and betray our veterans. Trump did not cripple our economy. Trump did not increase our debt to 20 trillion dollars. Trump did not ruin our credit, twice. Trump did not double African American unemployment. Trump did not increase welfare to a record level for eight years. Trump did not sign a law making it legal to execute, and imprison Americans. Trump did not set free all of terrorists in Guantanamo bay. Trump did not steal your rights, violate US Constitutional law, or commit treason, hundreds of times.

18 | Roberta Roy | 1 | 1561953730491318_1561960180490673 | The New York Sun sees Kaine as one of the few senators who fully backed the Obama-Hillary Middle East disaster, including the open disrespect and hostility to our ally, Israel.Can it be a coincidence that of all the millions of Americans Secretary Clinton could have picked as her running mate, she chose, in Senator Kaine, one of the eight Democrats who boycotted Prime Minister Netanyahu’s address last year to a joint meeting of Congress?Not a chance. It’s one marker of the fact that for all Mrs. Clinton’s protestations of support for the Jewish State, it would be a fool’s wager to count on her when the chips are down.Hillary’s choice of Tim Kaine reveals her intentions as president to continue the Obama policy of promoting the Muslim Brotherhood and Iran and betraying Israel. The choice of Kaine also reveals Hillary’s reckless disregard for homeland security. She has chosen a man who is willing to cozy up to well-known terror-promoters here in America in exchange for cash.The media wants us to think Donald Trump is dangerous. This is the face of danger---Clinton-Kaine: importers of jihadi terror to America.

--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Anthony DeLillo | 186 | 1561929497160408_1561931387160219 | He's right, there's never been a candidate whose campaign relied so much on hate-mongering and fear and who disrespects blacks, Latinos, Moslims, women, the disabled etc so openly.
2 | Ryan Lyons | 235 | 1561929497160408_1561930840493607 | Trump is the WORST thing to ever happen to America. He has made people HATE again. He has divided a nation that will take forever to heal and he has done it through his racism, hate, and bigotry. He is a con a crook and sexual pervert that belongs behind bars.
3 | Terry Teresa | 46 | 1561929497160408_1561941243825900 | Today is the day we can send this Vile Swine and his bigoted supporters back to their caves. Remember, if you are in line, stay in line. You get to vote. Don't let them tell you its to late. Republicans are counting on you not waiting, which is why they closed early voting in DemocraticStrongholds. Do not let ANYBODY intimidate you either. That is a Federal crime. Call your local FBI office. Now, this Nasty woman is going to march her nasty feet to the Polls!!

6 | Lawrence Byrnes | 20 | 1561929497160408_1561936550493036 | What make you think it will be "without him"...? He's not going anywhere (okay except to many many courts). He won't shut the hell up because he can't. He's mental.
7 | Terrance Smothers | 30 | 1561929497160408_1561936107159747 | Yeah, a child rapist that cheated on every wife and calls out singers about their language with yet has the slogan "grab them by the p****" will never run for president again. But heck after trump wouldn't be surprised if David Dukes wins the nomination for the republicans during the next presidential election.
8 | Jodie Featherston Moss | 34 | 1561929497160408_1561932603826764 | I don't like either candidate. However, presentation is important. The president is a representative, if you will, of our country. People from all over the world, our allies & enemies, judge us in large part, by the demeanor of our leader as he/she speaks. Trump has no filter. He cannot handle criticism. He cannot handle opposing views. He cannot handle a tough situation. He throws a fit like a belligerent, childish man, even during speeches. He makes the most obscure, immature, irresponsible remarks. All for the world to see. Hillary, is able to maintain her composure, at least act professional & has a filter when on camera. These qualities are very important when the world is watching.I had originally planned to vote third party. Now I've decided this election, isn't the election to do that. I'll be giving Hillary my vote to help keep sociopathic Trump, out.

14 | Maria Perez | 8 | 1561929497160408_1561935887159769 | I'm all about live and let live. But this is getting crazy! For example, I have a friend who gets about $800 a month in social security. Her spouse can't work at this time, and his monthly insurance premium is jumping from @ $230 per month to about $750 per month. If she didn't take on a part time job, that would leave them with less than $50 a month to live on. So while the wealthy celebrities are stumping for Clinton, and the people on subsidized health care are voting for Clinton, the people who have worked all of their lives, and those of us in the middle class are getting screwed. I've seen people's names changed because they bought a new social security card illegally, I've been to the richest cities in the country with people sleeping on the sidewalks, I've been called racist because I don't agree with this administration, I've seen towers fall, and I've seen my hometown county turn into the 2nd most affected by meth and heroin in NY state, (of which Clinton was a Senator). I've watched videos of Clinton saying she was against gay marriage, that she was for a border wall, called young black men "super predators" and her outright lies about a little place called Benghazi. As I've said before, I don't know if Trump is the answer, but this woman, with all of the opportunity she has had to affect change, is definitely not the answer. She walked into Washington 40 plus years ago with the sole purpose to gain the Presidency. It's been about her the entire time. Kicked off the Watergate case for taking home documents, lying under oath, and the most recent admission of accepting an unreported gift of 1 million dollars from a foreign nation (that which you need to report). They left Haiti, still in ruins. This woman can't even wear an American flag pin, as to not offend her foreign counterparts. This is not the America my ancestors came here for. Scared to speak your mind, less control over your children's upbringing, and a new database with your private healthcare information going straight to the government. All true. All evidence based in fact. When Tuesday is over, one way or another it's gonna be scary. I just hope. I don't know what I hope. But I'm gonna have a back up plan.Trump 2016
15 | Rob Lesnich | 1 | 1561929497160408_1561961647157193 | Ya....vote Hillary just based on your dislike for Trump, real smart to keep the Corupt Government moving forward slowly taking your rights.....soooo glad i signed up to defend a nation of idiots.....we look like idiots in the world theater....I hope to Christ that there is more sensible Americans then pussy liberals and Trump can drain that swamp
16 | Deena Pohlmann Anderson | 13 | 1561929497160408_1561935747159783 | I would love to make America great again, but trump is not the one who can do it due to is being a huge racist and unequal thoughts on anyone who isn't a white man
17 | Roger Evans | 1 | 1561929497160408_1561996833820341 | He's right, This will never happen again, You can bet that the Republican party gets to work on putting a rule in place to measure the mental fitness of a nominee, they'll probably also put a rule in place the excludes nominees at certain date points that don't carry a certain percentage of polling so that too many choices don't produce the worst of all possible outcomes. And the Democrats won't be far behind enacting similar rules, God knows, We don't want the same thing happening to us.
18 | Anthony Pego | 2 | 1561929497160408_1561969180489773 | Sorry, true Trump supporters, the 44 percent holding your hand til midnight don't all agree with you, not by a long shot, most just hate the system so much they'll vote for the devil himself and stand by your side until they wake up with a sulphur ridden hangover tomorrow morning, at which point Trump will be just one more part of their electoral regret, their ballot walk of shame, and he won't be getting a call back.
19 | Nwanne Di Uto | 0 | 1561929497160408_1561967307156627 | In this American election Trump said he will cut down Tax, he said he will repeal Obama care which many families can't afford to pay, he said he will bring back jobs to America, he said he will build a wall to stop drugs from overflowing into America, he said Muslims should be banned temporarily from entering American until their leaders explain to them what is really going on, until they explain why killing Americans is and Christians are their main targets, he said he will stop Syria 🇸🇾 refugees not to enter USA 🇺🇸 in other to safe American citizens from harm, is this why you hate him? if so tell me what good Hillary Clinton said she will do for you Americans, can I know any good thing said by Hillary Clinton.

25 | Henry Garcia | 0 | 1561929497160408_1562006520486039 | Donald Trump The “great shameless, audacious bawler” He will speak with such great fury and rage. He's mad, he's bad, and he's on track to be the Republican U.S. President in the 2016 general election. Donald Trump ("the false trumpet") is concealing his own madness.He makes a big show of friendship and eating dirt for his efforts. A desperate, narcissistic need to solve whatever problem is making a fool of him. Trump looks like a fool and must repent. The U.S. Senate makes a show of supporting Trump, but stabs him in the back: he's impeached or ditched after four years. But then "at the sound of the trump his adherents will be there", selling their possessions and expelling enemies. The final apotheosis of Trumpism: the personality cult of a one-term loser.

1 | Brian O'Mara | 22 | 1561900420496649_1561912387162119 | I think people are very mad after reading all of her campaign emails on Wikileaks!! She's also being investigated for her Clinton Foundation corruption, and she shouldn't have been let off her illegal email server charges!!
2 | Andrew Doerring | 16 | 1561900420496649_1561909830495708 | If this doesn't tell you that killery is in the pockets of wall street then what does? Just more proof that killery and wall street are working together to steal the American people's money.
3 | Sal Salmond | 0 | 1561900420496649_1561984160488275 | “Journalists” secretly working as enthusiastic volunteers for Clinton/Kaine 2016: Another one to file under “no big surprise, but still nice to see it on paper.” The American public needs to understand there is no real division between the government and media when a Democrat is in the White House, especially with this particular Democrat. The press loved Barack Obama and was childishly easy for him to spin at will, even during the queasy Fifty Shades of Grey stages of their romantic relationship, but the press is Hillary Clinton’s campaign. They’re her donors, Clinton Foundation contributors, and often her former (and future!) employees. If you didn’t think the media could be less interested in holding a president accountable than Obama, you’re in for a shock if Clinton wins.
4 | James Ricker | 0 | 1561900420496649_1562006117152746 | In a contested election, it would go to the House.Paul Ryan would do what he does best,delay and obstruct until the time limit is up and then he becomes president.

6 | Donna Palumbo | 0 | 1561900420496649_1562007847152573 | Trump obviously cares less about bankruptcies and screwing over Americans, so won't be the first financial disaster he has visited upon workers.
7 | Bill Roudabush | 0 | 1561900420496649_1561961520490539 | The market's will be the best in 8 years if Trump wins the election because Trump will build a strong economy. The market's have been going up an down for 8 years because of a stagnant economy. If you have money in the stock market and Trump wins plan on doing good.
8 | JP Thomas | 1 | 1561900420496649_1561906117162746 | Is there a Doctor in the House? No more corruption. Vote for the greater good, Jill Stein for President! Hillary Clinton has a long political corrupt record causing tremendous suffering and death in this country and around the world. Trump has no political record, but a corrupt personal business record. Why vote for corruption when you have the greater good, Jill Stein?

20 | Sal Salmond | 0 | 1561900420496649_1561983700488321 | Clinton admitted she has different “public and private positions” on Wall Street reform: Again, this shouldn’t surprise anyone, but it’s always useful to catch a politician actually admitting she isn’t honest with the public on issues – especially an issue of keen interest to the Democrats who opposed her in the primary. In the same issue, she admitted she’s out of touch with ordinary Americans and “far removed” from middle-class life, which is a refreshing bit of (unintended) candor from such a sanctimonious candidate and Party. Lastly, she said it was an “oversimplification” to blame banks for the 2008 financial meltdown, which is true – and greatly understating the truth of Democrat politicians’ culpability, at that – but not at all what Democrat hyper-partisans want to hear from their leaders.

4 | Kirk Lazaris | 49 | 1561858503834174_1561869650499726 | Great treasonous criminals voting for themselves smh If clinton wins she will pass TPP, then America really wont have any jobs for legal Americans to work to make a livable wage, since we're going to have to compete against illegal aliens for employment after clinton grants amnesty to people who broke the law to come to this country. America's economy is doomed if clinton wins... I really hope I'm wrong.

8 | Mike Lette Haight | 36 | 1561858503834174_1561864537166904 | A candidate is a citizen who has the right to vote but she should have been ushered straight to vote and then straight away/out, without delay, without pictures, without speech, etc. to fully leave the voting place.  Anything short of that equates to a candidate campaigning at a polling place and that is wrong, if not illegal.
9 | Stevi Ragland | 22 | 1561858503834174_1561861283833896 | You know, for some stupid reason, I thought candidates couldn't vote. Since they are the ones that are running.... it is too early for this nonsense.
10 | Dean S. Troy | 12 | 1561858503834174_1561871017166256 | Anyone who is in industry or knows anything about the #EPA should take note that they have now changed their policy toward Boiler Mact rules after billions have already been spent complying to those regulations. A federal court recently deferred to the EPA to make those rules tighter and to cost manufacturers millions more individually without any effect on emissions. The point is to shut down as many power boilers and thus domestic manufacturers as possible. A Clinton win today is a win for huge international manufacturers at the expense of American jobs to destroy smaller domestic competition. That's what your Democratic party stands for today. #Hillary #Clinton does not represent domestic labor.

23 | Tre Millz | 3 | 1561858503834174_998481706930022 | Listen up America. This isn't just a vote for Donald Trump or Hilary Clinton. It's a decision about the kind of world you want your children to live in. One candidate thinks America stopped being great ever since it elected its first black President to the Oval Office, that global warming is a hoax, that Mexicans are rapists, and that all Muslims are terrorists. Despite all the unfounded attacks on Hilary Clinton in his attempt to assassinate her character, Hilary remains confident and believes we are stronger together. Hilary promises to build upon the successes of president Obama and address the challenges ahead. If you're still undecided after the polls have opened, remember Donald Trump's  values are not American values. The  Supreme Court lies in the balance. Justice for all Americans, women's right to choose, LGBT rights, and affordable healthcare for all Americans are also at stake in this election. To my Republican colleagues and independent voters, please vote your conscience. There's nothing conservative about Mr. Trump. Ronald Reagan must be disappointed in the direction the party is headed. So I urge you to swallow your pride, look beyond her flaws and stand behind Hilary Clinton to defeat Donald Trump and send a clear message around the world that Islamophobia, homophobia, misogyny and racial demagoguery has no place in our political discourse! Your fellow countrymen thank you for your vote.
24 | Hilary Milo Campbell | 4 | 1561858503834174_1561867257166632 | Today's the day. Vote. Just get out and vote. Then make sure your family votes. And everyone you know votes. Then go find people who need help getting to a poll, and get them out to vote. I've made no secret of my preferences in this election, but you won't hear any partisan comments from me today. This is the most important American election in modern history, and the key to healing the wounds created by both parties in this electoral campaign is to start the next presidency with a clear decision by the electorate. Good luck!  #GetOutTheVote
25 | Josie Wachter | 3 | 1561858503834174_1561933237160034 | Like her or not, NO ONE should have reacted with a sad or angry face. In America, we always applaud a person exercising their right to vote.

The dramatic moment this sinkhole appeared was caught on camera
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Christy Jobe Carter | 472 | 1561804093839615_1561818887171469 | NBC News do you think it would be a good thing to put the place and time in the header?
2 | Judy Robertson | 110 | 1561804093839615_1561832873836737 | Which city? Which country? NBC News if you cannot report the news accurately then please refrain from doing so. #IncompleteNews
3 | WilfredyAura Solares | 50 | 1561804093839615_1561814467171911 | Jesus is coming,guys,let's seek God more and more,everything going on is because of the sin,,and nobody who will be the next president of the United States of America, will change that's.
4 | Kim Lim | 20 | 1561804093839615_1561857587167599 | Shut those silly mouths , once and for all... it's was happened in Tokyo Japan! Nothing to do with your silly reactions.... president race....🤔
5 | Linda Lee | 29 | 1561804093839615_1561810623838962 | Yes since everything was Obama fault now we turn the page. It's all Trumps fault
6 | Ric D'Amico | 12 | 1561804093839615_1561823560504335 | INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS. Not once did I hear any relevant discussions from either party about how we do this, except from B. Sanders. People lost their minds when he suggested raising taxes to fix bridges, improve water quality and improve infrastructure. Sadly America - with your heads in the sand - the soil around you will collapse and take you down with it.
7 | Charles Seibert | 2 | 1561804093839615_1561972403822784 | It's simple gravity folks. If you remove something from underneath you and fail to put anything back in its place, eventually the gravitational force will cause a collapse. It happens all the time, whether it's oil, coal, shale or spar that you take out.
8 | Carla Escobar | 2 | 1561804093839615_1561844290502262 | Well the buildings next to it will collapse, or the hole will swallow them.. more and more will keep on appearing... it's sad.

11 | Raul Rojas | 21 | 1561804093839615_1561809690505722 | I blame Donald Trump for this, even though this has nothing to do with Trump lol
12 | Kate Legacy | 8 | 1561804093839615_1561825107170847 | Everybody is comparing this to trump or Hillary but it's Japan... Lmao .
13 | Katia Miller | 1 | 1561804093839615_1561936440493047 | A gigantic sinkhole has opened in the southwestern Japanese city of Fukuoka, swallowing huge sections of road near underground work to extend a subway tunnel.A 7-to 8-meter-wide hole was first reported early Tuesday, according to Motohisa Oda, a crisis management officer from the city of Fukuoka.
14 | Sharon Tyrrell | 0 | 1561804093839615_1561980423821982 | OMG!!!  I would NOT going into ANY of those buildings surrounding this sink hole!  HEY, NBC.....would be NICE to identify where this is without having to read the whole story!
15 | Karl Thacker | 10 | 1561804093839615_1561811270505564 | Where's the 'moment it appeared'? All I'm seeing is video taken after it was already underway...

18 | Erica Furey | 2 | 1561804093839615_1561937020492989 | This is terrible but amazing at the same time. Those of you who are talking about the election, go talk about it somewhere else.

21 | Terry Dibble | 2 | 1561804093839615_1561827803837244 | This is exactly what will happen to Killary tonight!!!!How We Feel About Trump:This is exactly how most of us feel about Trump. The Media just doesn't get it....they can't believe that people are so angry that they can no longer be manipulated! Millions of trump supporters feel this way about Donald J. Trump.....We don't care if the guy swears... or how many times he's been married...or who he voted for, or what his income tax return shows. We want the problems fixed. Yes he's an egomaniac, but we don't care. We know he's not a racist, or bad to women, or all the other things the liberal media is trying to label him with. We know he's raised a good family, and that says a lot about him. The country is a mess because politicians suck, the Republican Party is two faced & gutless, and illegals are everywhere and Muslims are openly trying to hurt this country and make the civilized world adjust to them. We want it all fixed! We don't care that Trump is crude, we don't care that he has changed positions, we don't care that he fights with Megan Kelly, Rosie O'Donnell, and so many of the elected establishment. We don't care that Rubio, Ryan, the Bush's, and so many other top old and new Republicans refuse to endorse him. We don't care that he doesn't know the name of some Muslim terrorists, we don't care that he tried some businesses that didn't work out. This country is weak, bankrupt, our enemies are making fun of us, we are being invaded by illegals, we are becoming a nation of victims, where every Tom, Ricardo and Hasid is a special group with special rights to a point where we don't even recognize the country we were born and raised in, AND WE JUST WANT IT FIXED. And TRUMP is the only guy who seems to understand what the people want. We're sick of politicians, sick of the Democratic and Republican Party. We're angry about the Iran deal, the budget, treatment of Israel, military weakness, lobbyists, special interests, overpaid politicians with their self serving bills and back room deals, trade deals, loss of jobs, manipulated economic numbers, businesses fleeing, and even the phoney pay for play Clinton Foundation. Americans are no longer going to be fooled, and the movement is out to change the direction we're taking. Trump may not be a saint, but he doesn't have lobbyist money holding him, he doesn't have political correctness restraining him, and all you know is that he has been very successful, a good negotiator, he has built a lot of things, he's flexible, and he's also not a politician. And he says he'll fix it. And we believe him because he is too much of an egotist to be proven wrong or looked at and called a liar.Public service has become elected greed. This may be our only chance to have a non-politician, despite his flaws, try and correct the mess, at least for 4 years. We must take the shot, because the consequences of putting Hillary Clinton in office are frightening. There is a tidal wave happening, and its going to overcome much of what's happened to this country.
22 | Shane Macias | 0 | 1561804093839615_1561968093823215 | Technically the sinkhole was already there, he just captured more of it falling in.

1 | Chris Myers | 31 | 1561793150507376_1561797447173613 | If you care about our country, our rights and freedom, our safety, security and our future, vote for Donald Trump today!🇺🇸 Make America Great Again 🇺🇸 #draintheswamp #maga #TrumpPence
2 | Larry L Spence | 16 | 1561793150507376_1561794023840622 | Today is Our Judgement Day...Only God knows the Outcome and it will be his will...This Country will not Survive 4 more years of Corruption and these political Criminals...Vote for Real Hope & Change..Under a Hillary Clinton Administration:Healthcare costs will skyrocket out of necessity to fund all the illegals getting relief. The system will ultimately collapse and we'll be forced into a single payer system. Socialized Medicine. The goal all along.Lawlessness will reign. The Clinton's will rule the Department of Justice with a compliant Loretta Lynch at the helm. Laws will only apply to the little people while the elites will run wild with no consequence.After much "debate", the Second Amendment will be repealed. An unarmed citizenry is a compliant citizenry. We will become "subjects" instead of citizenry.The economy will continue to crumble. Our pathetic GDP will become "the good old days", as more and more jobs are lost and sent overseas with the TPP.No more borders. We will be flooded by socieltal burdens. Some just lazy; some good, hard working families; some very, very, very bad. It won't take long before we start seeing the results.Say so long to Freedom of Speech. Expect the return of The Fairness Doctrine to silence contrary thought. The UN will be given control of the internet and all "unapproved content" will be banned.The media will become emboldened to lie even more blatantly. They will direct the message for their masters in the White House.The Supreme Court wil be filled with Activist Judges. Our freedoms will gradually disappear. Not all at once. Bit by bit. So we hardly ever notice.She will finish what Obama started. Namely, the destruction of our beloved Republic. I know some don't believe this. But the writing is on the wall. You will see. And like Obama, regrets are an expensive thing.
3 | Trish Marie Charlton-Lee | 3 | 1561793150507376_1561839757169382 | I am not a political person and have never been but this is the most important election of Our Lives. For us our kids grandchildren and future grandchildren. Please be mindful when voting. Look for obvious signs of voter fraud as dead people have been voting in your ballots are being changed when you vote. If you don't believe me check out the segment on 6abc where are loved ones who have passed were visited because their loved ones who have passed voted. Also Take into consideration those people who cannot afford Healthcare but very unaffordable Healthcare is being forced down their throat. And don't forget that if they don't take that said Healthcare and have a job they get penalized in their taxes. A minimum of $2,400 is what is lost to that person can I already afford this. A Hillary vote will be nothing but the same. And the same people who cannot afford Healthcare come 2017 will end up paying way more whether they like it or have it. Do not let the corrupt media sway you. They are only telling you what they are paid to tell you. Which is already been proven buy CNN when Hillary was given the questions during the debates. The Obama and Clinton administration is so corrupt. They have constantly lied to the American people and the Clinton administration has stolen taken money from other countries that want to kill us and they do not respect women or gays. They have taken money in exchange for favors from Big Banks big corporations etc. They have used a fake foundation That was supposed to be for good to line their own pockets. This is also been proven by WikiLeaks as they have used it for their daughter's wedding. The money that was supposed to go to Haiti only very little percent went there and the rest went in their pockets. Hillary Clinton has lied to the FBI and the American people during both investigations. The only way the American people found anything out was through WikiLeaks. Had we not had WikiLeaks we would all still be in the dark and would believe that she would be fit for president. She lied and claimed that the Russians were responsible for the leaks in our own private server which was illegal to have in the first place . She lied about her server. Obama lied about knowing about her server. And they both compromise National Security. 5 of America's enemies hack into her server which can put us all in danger. She and Obama paid off and bribed top officials that made it totally impossible for there to be any chance of her being indicted. Whistleblowers are turning up dead left and right under suspicious reasons. Hell she couldn't even be honest when it came to her stealing the White House Furniture that she inevitably had to return LOL. I could keep going but I think I made my point. Do we really want this unfit unethical irresponsible Woman for president? is this what you want for the future of your children?I personally don't care who you vote for as long as it is #neverhillary. Vote for Trump vote for the third party but never Hillary. She is the disease that is going to drain this country. It is going to be more of the same if she is elected. Nothing but corruption and the American people will never be informed of anything unless of course WikiLeaks she's putting her out on Front Street. Which God I hope they still do . And if he is elected president I will bet my bottom dollar that she will be impeached just like her husband was. Please be wise when voting for the future of my kids your kids and our grandchildren. #neverhillary #anybodybutHillaryforpresident #nomorecorruption #onlywecanstopthecorruption
4 | Jay Gerald | 17 | 1561793150507376_1561794550507236 | Reporter: "So Mr. Trump, it appears that Hillary Clinton will be the next President. Do you have anything to say?"Donald Trump (looks directly at camera): "I never ran for President".
5 | Troy R. Marr | 4 | 1561793150507376_1561845250502166 | It's no longer about Republican vs. Democrat.It's all of us Americans vs the Politicians, the media, special interests, lobbyists, foreign countries, Wall Street, the drug companies, hollywood, and the Washington elitist.Never again will we have a chance to take our country back from the globalist agenda they're cramming down our throats, It's now, or never.Please get out and vote, do it for your children & your grandchildren. Stop the Muslim invasion of our country and our way of life. Be true to your country, your values, and your heritage. Vote for the American, not the politician.God Bless America
6 | Nora Walsh | 3 | 1561793150507376_1561797070506984 | NBC News - you have completely lost sight of the historical significance of the first female candidate for president. Women, girls and feminists everywhere would like the media to focus on this milestone.
7 | Jack Rougeaux | 5 | 1561793150507376_1561805047172853 | What ever the out come two things are a guarantee. First our country is divided be on repair by hate. Second the news media will never be trusted to broadcast the truth.
8 | Paul Ydstie | 8 | 1561793150507376_1561816067171751 | Hillary Clinton did something wrong by using her husband's private server and even if you want to call it a crime, there were no victims. In contrast, Donald Trump has screwed thousands of Americans. He's never done anything for anyone, unless he saw a benefit for himself. This is a man who defrauded thousands of students who, just like many of his supporters, wanted to emulate him and his perceived success. Every time he has filed bankruptcy, he has walked away with millions of dollars, while leaving his unpaid contractors holding the bag. Most of his supporters are naive or just easily duped. They believe he's going to build a wall and make Mexico pay for it. They believe he's going to bring jobs back to this country when he has outsourced all of his own manufacturing jobs and even knowing he was running for President, made no effort to bring back a single one of those jobs. This is a man with no knowledge of current events, who possesses the attention span of a four year-old. He said he was always in favor of Brexit, but had never heard of Brexit a week before the vote. He said he had met Vladimir Putin in the "60 Minutes" green room, but even though their segments appeared the same night, Trump had no clue that they were filmed thousands of miles apart. Donald Trump said, "Vladimir Putin is not going into the Ukraine", completely clueless to the fact that Russian forces had already invaded the eastern territory of Crimea. This is a man who asked, "Why do we have nuclear weapons if we're not going to use them?" ... As you go to the polls today, ask yourself why you don't believe America is already great. Many of you are planning to vote for a man who is not only dangerous, but a loose cannon who would possess the power to end the world.
9 | Chris McConnell | 1 | 1561793150507376_1561961310490560 | and a lot of that blame goes to Chuck Todd , who has been one sided through this whole ordeal, and we can't forget NBC , as they are also at fault
10 | David Hughes | 3 | 1561793150507376_1561816973838327 | people say trump is bigot. then answer this...why is he a bigot for improving the wall Hillary built? why is he repeating rape charges on illegals that Obama admin posted,  why is Hillary not mentioned when she passed a law that double the number of blacks in prison....well?
11 | Lawrence M. Slocki | 1 | 1561793150507376_1561984163821608 | But certainly no blame to the MSM who did everything they possibly could to rig the DNC primary, rig the debates by planting questions that were spoon fed verbatim back to HRC and rig the election by fabricating poll results. Piss on the lot of you.
12 | Karen Gold | 0 | 1561793150507376_1561879570498734 | If you want her to win by a landslide...When you go to vote, take a few Hillary Clinton supporters to vote too! Don't take for granted that they will get to their polling places on their own...help them! 💙 💙
13 | David Hughes | 0 | 1561793150507376_1562001903819834 | news media lies so you don't know the truth, but they claim democrats vote early and republicans on election day...then don't get depressed because in my area the voter turn out is one of highest I ever seen, long line, when you get out it is just as long as when you arrived. join in the vote and win every state , stay home and ensure Hillary wins...we don't need a felon like Hillary in office
14 | David H Craig | 0 | 1561793150507376_1561995040487187 | Start reporting the truth, Hillary has no credibility, Regardless of what Hillary Clinton says she is still under investigation by the FBI, one by the Public Corruption Group the other by the National Security Group. The Email is the only Scandal is closed for now.
15 | Dina Kirkconnell | 0 | 1561793150507376_1561850093835015 | Trump for a landslide! It will prove again how rigged the media truly is! By reporting wrong polls, they think people won't go out to vote. It got the opposite effect. Just like trashing Trump got people to like him more. Their bias was so evident it helped Trump all the way to the White House! If you need to blame or thank anyone, start with CNN all the way to Univision! You did guys, SALUD!
16 | Klaus Reck | 0 | 1561793150507376_1561881317165226 | If you are Gay or lesbian, why would you want to vote for Hillary, when she gets millions from countries that will execute or in prison gays & lesbians?If you are Black, why are you voting for Hillary when she defends Planned Parenthood and admires Margaret Sanger, who wanted to abort as many black babies as possible and exterminate the black race, and Margaret Sanger said blacks are “morons,” “idiots,” “imbeciles,” “human weeds,” and “misfits.” Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.If you are a Woman, how can you vote for Hillary when she has buried all of Bill's rape victims under the rug. As an attorney, Hillary also defended the rapist of a 12-year old girl and laughed about it later. She plays the woman-card and acts entitled; implying that she deserves your vote merely because of her sex. How is that gender neutral?If you are a Miner, Steelworker or have a Factory job, why are you voting for Hillary when she supported NAFTA and TPP, and workers are being laid off because jobs are going overseas? She also welcomes open borders and illegals to get benefits with your tax money and compete for our jobs. Hillary boasts that under her administration miners and steelworkers will lose their jobs.If you are a Law abiding citizen, how can you vote for Hillary when she is clearly above the law? Hillary deleted thousands of secret e-mails *after* they had been subpoenaed by the courts (illegal). Hillary kept thousands of classified and top secret e-mails on her private server; servers that had less security that g-mail and Hotmail. You can be sure Russia, Iran, and China have those now. The DNC clearly broke the rules by heavy-handedly favoring Hillary over Sanders while they were still competing for the nomination.If you are a Veteran, in the military, or closely related to a military member, why are you voting for Hillary when she left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again? They called for help, but the help was told to stand down. Furthermore, Hillary wants to eliminate the NRA, take away your guns, and abolish the second amendment?Go Trump
17 | Mark Smith | 10 | 1561793150507376_1561793487174009 | The Clinton Foundation is still under investigation by the FBI..HILLARY IS CROOKED..

Latinos ... especially Mexicans ... Muslims ... Jews ... The Disabled ... War Veterans ... Decent Republicans ... LGBTQ ... etc ...

1 | Tony Iley | 1568 | 1561628620523829_1561636893856335 | Reporter: "So Mr. Trump, it appears that Hillary Clinton will be the next President. Do you have anything to say?"Donald Trump (looks directly at camera): "I never ran for President".
2 | Gary Basham | 781 | 1561628620523829_1561633943856630 | In less than 24 hours there will be a lot of uninformed racists weeping. I'm getting excited. I will take great joy in their tears and will mock them and laugh in their faces. Trump is finished. The GOP is finished. There will NEVER be another republikkkan in the White House. Praise God!
3 | Evie Franizzi | 479 | 1561628620523829_1561639177189440 | All the little Trump trolls are hilarious. Knowing he's losing today makes me look forward to the holiday season as they fade into obscurity.
4 | Sanderia Ajasa | 292 | 1561628620523829_1561638890522802 | Because Trump has already told them the system is rigged. They will only believe that it's not rigged if he wins. #GetOutTheVote #NeverTrump
5 | Anthony S. Greco Jr. | 179 | 1561628620523829_1561641783855846 | If he wins or loses! American's still need to be together still as one awesome nation... Whoever wins we as a nation still should stand by our commander and chief no matter what! This country needs to stop the hate now. Look to do what is right for all of us living today and for future of our kids and nation.
6 | M Hilal Arfeen | 233 | 1561628620523829_1561629667190391 | Trump is about to lose the election and after that whinning on media of rigged elections and blame to hillary.Donald trump hatred politics will be end soon because majority of people has rejected his crap politics which is based on muslim card and building walls against comminities.Hillary is a winner and trump is a big time loser
7 | Salman Khan | 171 | 1561628620523829_1561629930523698 | Donald Trump answers the question: What is 2+2?"I have to say a lot of people have been asking this question. No, really. A lot of people come up to me and they ask me. They say, "What's 2+2"? And I tell them look, we know what 2+2 is. We've had almost eight years of the worst kind of math you can imagine. Oh my god, I can't believe it. Addition and subtraction of the 1s the 2s and the 3s. Its terrible. Its just terrible. Look, if you want to know what 2+2 is, do you want to know what 2+2 is? I'll tell you.First of all the number 2, by the way I love the number 2. It's probably my favorite number, no it is my favorite number. You know what, it's probably more like the number two but with a lot of zeros behind it. A lot. If I'm being honest, I mean, if I'm being honest. I like a lot of zeros. Except for Marco Rubio, now he's a zero that I don't like. Though, I probably shouldn't say that. He's a nice guy but he's like, "10101000101", on and on, like that. He's like a computer! You know what I mean? He's like a computer. I don't know. I mean, you know. So, we have all these numbers and we can add them and subtract them and add them. TIMES them even. Did you know that? We can times them OR divide them, they don't tell you that, and I'll tell you, no one is better at the order of operations than me. You wouldn't believe it. That I can tell you. So, we're gonna be the best on 2+2, believe me. OK? Alright. Thank you."
8 | Patricia Horton | 76 | 1561628620523829_1561642903855734 | Legally, it won't matter. Hillary will be President. His supporters will get back in their pick-ups, and crawl back under their rocks.

Colorado, New Mexico, California, Nevada, Washington, Oregon, Illinois, Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey, Virginia, New York, Conneticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, DC, and Vermont. That's it. She wins.

19 | Yahya Bajinka | 16 | 1561628620523829_1561704533849571 | Who cares? I wouldn't really care though. I'd love President Hillary Clinton to heal and further unify our great country after moron Trump's divisive political campaign. May God bless United States of America!
20 | Michele Fouchey | 15 | 1561628620523829_1561687127184645 | This morning...Nate Silvers 538 Presidential poll Clinton 71.6%Trump 28.4%538 ..so far for presidential elections he has been right. Betting sites are about the same. The average on the national polls has Clinton ahead too. You can't just look at one poll which is why so many Trump nuts think Trump is going to win. He won't. Clinton is doing far better than Obama did against McCain and about the same as he did against Romney....and he won.
21 | Lisa Marie | 5 | 1561628620523829_1803618106544352 | I just learned today that my grandfather is voting for Clinton. If he were still alive, I would show him wikileaks and project veritas to talk him out of it.

Regroup and prepare for the next election and find a person who is for ALL people equally and has some common core decency and values, without expressing themselves in a fowl manner and above a juveniles mentality, or B. Take that anger and nonsense somewhere else, the majority rejects trump and his so called ideology.

1 | Adam Derner | 146 | 1561608670525824_1561616107191747 | Well, if enough people vote all blue and elect Clinton and take the senate or close the gap on the house, then yes, this will be our Independence Day. The day America told a failed businessman, con, racist, compulsive liar, pervert, rapist, fraud, anti-American orange Putin loving freak to piss off. And if the gap is big enough he can move to Russia and take his trailer trash train (with all their alts) with him.
2 | Tim Banes | 85 | 1561608670525824_1561612043858820 | The Clintons will very soon be a thing of the past and very soon we will also begin to drain the swamp in Washington D.C. of all politicians who have served themselves with their political careers and have forgotten about the American electorate. The time has come when we will see clearly what the future holds for us because finally someone by the name of Donald Trump had the courage to stand up against the Washington elites and has shaken the political arena to its core. No more of the same for we the people have spoken loud and clear and have decided that enough is enough. GO TRUMP/PENCE!!

He will do nothing to anyone else simply because he doesn't know how or has any support doing so, but getting the "name" of president would be fun and good for his tv network. ... he did nothing wrong selling heaven... the ones that believed it are the ones that need to have their brains, heart, morals and values checked.

Remember you voted for Hillary and it’s ok not follow the law, so let it go.When your son lies bleeding out in a pool of his own blood, his eyes glazing over, his breath slowing, his speech slurring because of the blood foaming out, still crying out, “Mama. . .mama . . .” two bullets in the back because he was the wrong color. Remember you voted for Hillary and it’s ok not follow the law, so let it go.When you enter your parent’s home, see the damage, chair’s overturned, complete disarray, see your father fallen in the corner, with the bloody bat they beat him with. The casket will be closed. Upstairs to your mother. She fought, oh did she fight, the deep cuts on her arms and hands prove that. But they raped her they finally ended her pain with a knife in the chest. . . 22 times. Remember you voted for Hillary and it’s ok not follow the law, so let it go.Hillary Clinton broke the law, plain and simple. America is either a land of laws or there are no laws.Hillary is not above the law.

Trump touted the support of New England Patriots QB Tom Brady at a New Hampshire rally on Monday, saying the NFL star voted for him on the same day Brady told a Massachusetts radio show he hadn't voted yet." Abc news
19 | Vita Gambella Capria | 0 | 1561608670525824_1561809563839068 | You Democrats are all the same a bunch of bigots and BS artists. I had my own experience with a long time childhood friend of mine. We both grew up together in a NYC housing project in the 1960's. we both worked hard and went the NYC colleges and both had successful careers. We were good friends for over 50 years. We shared basically the same values of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. It wasn't until my childhood good friend learned that I was supporting Trump that this friend turned on me after 50 plus years of friendship and said that I must be a bigot, racist, etc etc because I supported Trump. This says it all. Of course his words are not true but his actions are typical of a Democrat. If you don't agree with them then you are no good! Very said because we are both educated people just with different political positions. This is Frank speaking🇨🇭

The system will ultimately collapse and we'll be forced into a single payer system. Socialized Medicine. The goal all along.Lawlessness will reign. The Clinton's will rule the Department of Justice with a compliant Loretta Lynch at the helm. Laws will only apply to the little people while the elites will run wild with no consequence.After much "debate", the Second Amendment will be repealed. An unarmed citizenry is a compliant citizenry. We will become "subjects" instead of citizenry.The economy will continue to crumble. Our pathetic GDP will become "the good old days", as more and more jobs are lost and sent overseas with the TPP.No more borders. We will be flooded by socieltal burdens. Some just lazy; some good, hard working families; some very, very, very bad. It won't take long before we start seeing the results.Say so long to Freedom of Speech. Expect the return of The Fairness Doctrine to silence contrary thought. The UN will be given control of the internet and all "unapproved content" will be banned.The media will become emboldened to lie even more blatantly. They will direct the message for their masters in the White House.The Supreme Court wil be filled with Activist Judges. Our freedoms will gradually disappear. Not all at once. Bit by bit. So we hardly ever notice.She will finish what Obama started. Namely, the destruction of our beloved Republic. I know some don't believe this. But the writing is on the wall. You will see. And like Obama, regrets are an expensive thing.

Betting sites are about the same. The average on the national polls has Clinton ahead too. You can't just look at one poll which is why so many Trump nuts think Trump is going to win. He won't. Clinton is doing far better than Obama did against McCain and about the same as he did against Romney....and he won.

"What if someone goes to the wrong place, waits in line for a long time, realizes its the wrong place and says, 'I don't have time to get to the right polling place,' and doesn't vote?" a registered Democrat who got one of the messages said.

1 | Gaila Phillips | 55 | 1561570730529618_1561599897193368 | It's not fair to any voter. If you are behind your candidate, you and YOU should already know where to vote. If you miss it, it's your own fault. It's still early, go look for your polling places!!!!!
2 | Tomas Davis | 65 | 1561570730529618_1561572303862794 | New polls are indicating the beginning of a Trump sweep across the USA. Clinton voters are no where to be found and appear to be merely media hype that is collapsing like an empty shell.
3 | Leo Decaj | 43 | 1561570730529618_1561571153862909 | While in office as Secretary of State, Clinton has accepted donations from at least 85 foreign donors. She sold her seat. She can be bought and is the ring leader of this CORRUPT SYSTEM. She promised she would release her donors; we're still waiting…
4 | Zoser Nombo | 24 | 1561570730529618_1561580490528642 | If you are Black, Why are you voting for Hillary when she admires Margaret Sanger and defends Planned Parenthood who want to abort as many black babies as possible? Exterminate the black race because they are like "weeds". (Margaret Sanger quote) Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.👁 If you are a Christian, Why are you voting for Hillary Clinton when she wrote her Senior thesis on Saul Alinsky who dedicated his book 'Rules for Radicals' to Lucifer (the Devil)? She says he was, and still is her mentor.👁 If you are a Veteran, in the Military, or closely related to a Military member, Why are you voting for Hillary when she left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again? They called for help but the help was told to stand down.👁 If you have a factory job, Why are you voting for Hillary when she supported TPP? Factory workers are being laid off because jobs are going over seas. Don't forget the deals she's made with china. She also welcomes open borders and illegals to get benefits to be paid with Your tax money.👁 If you are poor, Why are you voting for Hillary, when she is supporting Wall street and all the big banks? Big banks keep poor people poor by destroying the poor man's credit by allowing medical bills and collections to affect your credit scores so you can pay higher interest rates than the rich; Taking much of the little money you earn.👁 If you are a Woman, how can you vote for Hillary when she has buried all of Bills rape victims under the rug, including that little girl that was raped? Lawyer Hillary defended the rapist, and then she laughed about it later, knowing that he was guilty. If you carry a gun, or believe in the Constitution; How can you vote for Hillary when she wants to eliminate the NRA, Take your guns, and abolish the second Amendment?👁 If you breathe, Why would you vote for Hillary when she and the Clinton crime family have left a trail of dead people that did not agree with her, or they knew too much? Who is left? 👁 VOTE TRUMP!!!

Remove the debt, end the Machiavellian whispering of the faceless Elite. Vote Donald J. Trump, he is your last chance.

9 | Caasain D'Etat | 10 | 1561570730529618_1561580477195310 | Vote Trump to give justice to Ambassador Steven. I wanna remind everyone about Tuesday November 8 2016. It's time for you to get out and vote. Vote for Progress, vote job creation, vote for security, for our military reform, vote for our immigration reform, vote for our Health care System, vote for our education system, and most definitely for Donald J. Trump who can make it all happened. Thank You
10 | Tan Chiup Chan | 1 | 1561570730529618_1561608467192511 | Obama might as well use his Executive Order to cancel the election and declare you the winner. No need to rig an election and make it ostensibly "fair". Wasting so many millions of dollars and time on this sham election they  can use the money for cash handouts to the poor.And I ask the US to stop telling other nations to respect democracy like the other day Clinton had the cheek to tell this to El-Sisi. Sheer hypocrisy!!!
11 | Angela Haggerty | 3 | 1561570730529618_1561829623837062 | In my city, the Republicans are telling registered Democrats that they don't even have to go to the polling stations.  They can send someone to pick up their vote.  HA HA.  It goes both ways.
12 | Kathy Crest | 0 | 1561570730529618_1561971430489548 | They did the same thing in Arizona. How do you people vote for candidates who's party uses such tactics to win? We have seen video after video of voter fraud taking place. Under cover videos that PROVE Hillary Clinton was in charge of this activity, hiring people to go incite violence at Bernie Sander's events as well as Trump's. Isn't it amazing that we haven't heard of any violent acts ever since those videos came out? Isn't it amazing we haven't heard of Black Lives Matter violence ever since the truth was brought out about them, that George Soros was funding their little violent cult? People like Hillary Clinton will do ANYTHING for power, control and money. She has proven that time and time again. But what the people of this country have not been told, because our media is completely controlled by our government now, is that the FBI has found evidence that the Clintons have been involved in child sex trafficking and sexual abuse of children. They have taken children by the dozens from places like Haiti and sold them into sex slavery. They will do ANYTHING for money, people. They are SICK, DEMENTED MANIACS, and we cannot allow them back in the White House. If we do, we are no better than they are. Once the FBI goes public with this, and they will, the American people are NOT going to allow these people to occupy our White House. FBI agents are in a quandary because if they indict Hillary now, they cannot use those charges in an attempt to impeach her if she does take this election. They can charge her with the crimes, but a case like this would drag on until their deaths, and they would never see the inside of a prison cell. Hillary's campaign manager has been exposed for attending Satanic rituals, where little children, INNOCENT CHILDREN, are raped and even murdered in sacrifices. These people will kidnap a woman and rape her repeatedly until she becomes pregnant, then when she has the baby, the baby is murdered and its tiny little body is dismembered. These animals drink its blood and eat the flesh in some kind of offering to the figure they worship, Satan. MY GOD PEOPLE! We have PURE EVIL taking place within our government. They believe that these satanic rituals give them super human powers and their ultimate goal is to take over the world. They are sick, demented people, and they need to be stopped. But here is the problem. The FBI has all the evidence now that they could ever need to indict the Clintons and many others. They have the evidence to charge Obama with treason. They cannot impeach Hillary if they charge her now, because any charges filed against her now can not be used against her to impeach her. Also, if they indict her now, Obama can pardon her. He can also pardon himself, which is a law that needs to be changed. The president should not be able to pardon ANYONE without a panel involved in the decision. So they cannot indict anyone until after Trump becomes president. If Hillary does, they will wait until she gets in office. That way they can at least try to impeach her. If they were to only try her in court, that case would drag on forever. It is very complicated. I just pray that  Trump wins this election. We can't let this kind of evil overtake our nation.

We just left the voting booths that opened at 7 a.m., and the machines aren't working correctly, ALREADY! Votes that we cast for an all Republican card, 'mysteriously' changed all of our votes to Democratic. No kidding. We had to call the Voting Monitor and Supervisor over to review. They shut down three booths, due to this. This is in Nashville! WATCH and VERIFY, America. These machines are 'FIXED', in the worst way possible!
15 | Dawn Larson | 9 | 1561570730529618_1561596493860375 | New Hampshire voters who just participated in the tradition of midnight voting, cast a total of 61 votes. 32 went to Donald J. Trump, 25 to Hillary Clinton and 4 to Gary Johnson. It should be noted that Obama won midnight voting in 2008 and split the vote with Romney in 2012, but clearly Clinton does not have that level of support in 2016. I hope the rest of this day goes the same as midnight voting in NH .. TrumpPence Victory! #MAGA

21 | Teresa Cooper | 2 | 1561570730529618_1561797287173629 | Hillary Supporters, You think you are right about voting for Hillary Clinton, but the children in your family will suffer tremendously in a country with no borders and no guns to protects ourselves. I am assuming that when you go to bed at night that you don't lock your doors and that there is a sign in your yard saying "Come on in", coz that is exactly what Hillary represents for this country. No security while we go about our daily lives and inviting all terrorists, drug smugglers, and hardened criminals to come on in. Shame on you for not thinking about the future of your children a little harder before you made this crucial decision. If she wins, you will see the America you have created for them.
22 | Paul Ydstie | 1 | 1561570730529618_1561861157167242 | Hillary Clinton did something wrong by using her husband's private server and even if you want to call it a crime, there were no victims. In contrast, Donald Trump has screwed thousands of Americans. He's never done anything for anyone, unless he saw a benefit for himself. This is a man who defrauded thousands of students who, just like many of his supporters, wanted to emulate him and his perceived success. Every time he has filed bankruptcy, he has walked away with millions of dollars, while leaving his unpaid contractors holding the bag. Most of his supporters are naive or just easily duped. They believe he's going to build a wall and make Mexico pay for it. They believe he's going to bring jobs back to this country when he has outsourced all of his own manufacturing jobs and even knowing he was running for President, made no effort to bring back a single one of those jobs. This is a man with no knowledge of current events, who possesses the attention span of a four year-old. He said he was always in favor of Brexit, but had never heard of Brexit a week before the vote. He said he had met Vladimir Putin in the "60 Minutes" green room, but even though their segments appeared the same night, Trump had no clue that they were filmed thousands of miles apart. Donald Trump said, "Vladimir Putin is not going into the Ukraine", completely clueless to the fact that Russian forces had already invaded the eastern territory of Crimea. I know it's hard to believe, but this is a man who actually asked, "Why do we have nuclear weapons if we're not going to use them?" ... As you go to the polls today, ask yourself, "Why don't you believe America is already great?" Many of you are planning to vote for a man who is not only dangerous, but a loose cannon who would possess the power to end the world.

24 | Klaus Reck | 0 | 1561570730529618_1561881743831850 | If you are Gay or lesbian, why would you want to vote for Hillary, when she gets millions from countries that will execute or in prison gays & lesbians?If you are Black, why are you voting for Hillary when she defends Planned Parenthood and admires Margaret Sanger, who wanted to abort as many black babies as possible and exterminate the black race, and Margaret Sanger said blacks are “morons,” “idiots,” “imbeciles,” “human weeds,” and “misfits.” Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.If you are a Woman, how can you vote for Hillary when she has buried all of Bill's rape victims under the rug. As an attorney, Hillary also defended the rapist of a 12-year old girl and laughed about it later. She plays the woman-card and acts entitled; implying that she deserves your vote merely because of her sex. How is that gender neutral?If you are a Miner, Steelworker or have a Factory job, why are you voting for Hillary when she supported NAFTA and TPP, and workers are being laid off because jobs are going overseas? She also welcomes open borders and illegals to get benefits with your tax money and compete for our jobs. Hillary boasts that under her administration miners and steelworkers will lose their jobs.If you are a Law abiding citizen, how can you vote for Hillary when she is clearly above the law? Hillary deleted thousands of secret e-mails *after* they had been subpoenaed by the courts (illegal). Hillary kept thousands of classified and top secret e-mails on her private server; servers that had less security that g-mail and Hotmail. You can be sure Russia, Iran, and China have those now. The DNC clearly broke the rules by heavy-handedly favoring Hillary over Sanders while they were still competing for the nomination.If you are a Veteran, in the military, or closely related to a military member, why are you voting for Hillary when she left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again? They called for help, but the help was told to stand down. Furthermore, Hillary wants to eliminate the NRA, take away your guns, and abolish the second amendment?Go Trump

It was stolen from the Native Americans as they were killed off. America will never be white again so get over yourself. Stop frustrating yourself with your own hate. Learn how to let go of your ignorant pride. Love your fellow Americans because they bleed red just like you. Don't be hate filled and give yourself a heart attack. Stop listening to your hateful friends, family and neighbors. Tell them to stop being so hateful. Unlearn the racist teachings from your parents and grandparents. Be happy that you are in a wonderful country that is loving and caring.

Maybe because I've lived in a town where I've never experienced this kind of racism, or I was adopted into a Conservative White family, or maybe because most of my friends are white. It hurts me down in my soul to see people have been raised this way. I'm not angry I'm sad that this man can't see past the color of ones skin and see their character.

Let's dispel with the notion that Trump doesn't know what he's doing. He knows exactly what he's doing. He's appealing to trash like the man in the video and inspiring them to effect their racism in the form of policy. Get out and vote today, or the national nightmare that is the Trump campaign will be the face of the country for four years.

13 | Phillip Shaps | 79 | 1561552657198092_1561579057195452 | Trump is not only a racist but he brings out the worst in people. We do owe Trump one thing, namely that he inadvertently told all Americans there's still racism in the USA and that we must work harder to once and for all eliminate it from the fabric of our society.
14 | Omar F Bishr | 58 | 1561552657198092_1203146113080576 | Please get out and vote for Hillary! President Obama gave a beautiful speech in Philadelphia last night encouraging everyone to vote for humanity and not hate. Trump has brought out the worst in people, blaming his version of our country on everyone who doesn't look like him. It sounds like something out of our history classes! Please vote today!

21 | Kashia Bailey | 27 | 1561552657198092_1203118866416634 | I had a client I was working for tell me white people gave Detroit to blacks and we should appreciate what they did for us. Plus she said why do blacks have to come to the suburbs we should let white people be. Shocked no disappointed no. I kindly told her you didn't give us anything you ran to the suburbs in mass we didn't want the city we could have all lived together. You were scared and ran now you are stuck out in the boon docks and have to drive miles just to enjoy the city where you ran from. Thank you.
22 | JB Flynn | 16 | 1561552657198092_1361860300537172 | I'm glad someone caught this on tape. I was talking to my neighbor about how racist this country is compared to all the others I've lived in, and she wouldn't believe me. The biggest downfall is how much hate there is in this country. There's no unity. A society can never grow if we don't work together and respect one another; including respecting those abroad. #imwithher
23 | Phylnette Harrison Pettit | 20 | 1561552657198092_1361888377201031 | Donald Trump has given racists the permission to open and bold. Good job putting this guys face on the internet.

25 | Dan Zimmerman | 15 | 1561552657198092_1561570293862995 | Can we lock up all these ignorant @ssholes already?! They cause more damage to our society than drugs, Isis, foreign trade deals and a host of other issues. While we're at it, let's legalize drugs, that'll resolve a ton of issues as well. Let's replace the non-violent drug offenders in prison with these ignorant @ssholes. That would be awesome.

1 | Michael Bergens | 191 | 1561526723867352_1561531503866874 | That's what happens when one is born with a silver spoon in the mouth, grows up in a greenhouse, in a controlled environment, absolutely clueless about anything except the Beloved Self. What a handicap! This kind of a behavior among peer boys and girls on an Average Block on an Average Street would deliver him a couple of good smacks and a few good kicks below the waist. But it would save him from becoming a committed, finished, hopeless narcissistic sociopath.

We need someone new with ideas and has stamina and strength. Not somebody who is constantly resting at her house, and having everybody else campaign for her. We need TRUMP because we don't need a tax increase, or an increase of illegal immigrants. We need lower taxes and have borders! What is a country without borders? The world is already eating our country economically dry. We need a businessman who will make trades with other countries and bring our economy back. I voted for Trump. We need to make America Great Again! Vote for TRUMP! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸

Sniffle brain had forgot.When, what do you know, what should appearBut a nasty old woman and what looked like reindeer(Hard to tell with *sniff* bad vision)"Now Biden, and Barack, I'll continue your visionNow Jay-Z and Beyoncé and all my nasty women,Through the glass ceiling - there won't be a wallNow dash away, dash away! Dash away all."And the glass, like rain, started falling downThey looked like crystal tears that on Drumpf's face slid downAway to the White House, Air Force One flewWith a whole lot of votes and Ex-President Bill, tooAnd Trump's shriveled little fingers, like after a bathCurled into tiny little fists, so great was his wrathHe pouted, cried and growled about fixed electionsAbout how bigly were his hands and also his erections.But it did not matter. The die was now cast.America's present would not be like Germany's past.And the only wall the Trump would be currently buildingWas the one around his bank accounts - that were rapidly wiltingHillary went to the Oval Office to continue her work.Drumpf got his Twitter back and remained a big jerk.America took a deep breath and enjoyed the fall.Get a good night's sleep and happy Election Day to all!

A black man, standing behind the seal of the President of the United States, passed the torch of the world's longest lasting democracy to a woman on the eve of an election that polls say she is favored to win.

They also have no divorce rights.The same male approval is needed for marriage in United Arab Emirates, plus laws there also allow a husband to assault his wife and children. And what they do to LGBT is disgraceful!! I am so glad I saw this before tomorrow but you are right Hillary, the educated women of America will do the right thing on Tuesday!

8 | Donna King | 66 | 1561474583872566_1561491607204197 | This is sick...just because he is black and she is a women...does not matter that they are so freaking corrupt and steal from the american people to line their pockets and tell the american people lie after lie...like we are just a bunch of sheep that don't know any better...This is all a bunch of bull and the American people had better wake up NOW before we are sitting in the middle east right in AMERICA...
9 | Regla Kary Lastra | 74 | 1561474583872566_1561487380537953 | TRUMP.all the way, no matter what is Most people are not aware of the facts stated below, therefore I am sharingthis with all of you.*Here is something to think about**, and why so many Americans supportDonald Trump !!*(This information has all been checked, then double checked... it is 100%Correct.That's why there is such an alarm within US government, since Trump'sstatement about temporary suspension of migration of Muslims to US till USauthorities make sure there is a proper concept of safe penetration of USterritory.People are stunned to learn that the head of the U.S. CIA is a Muslim!Do hope this wakes up some!You mean until it hits you like a ton of bricks read it again, until youunderstand!We now have a Muslim government.John Brennan, current head of the CIA converted to Islam while stationed inSaudi Arabia.Obama's top adviser, Valerie Jarrett, is a Muslim who was born in Iranwhere her parents still live.Hillary Clinton's top adviser, Huma Abedin is a Muslim, whose mother andbrother are involved in the now outlawed Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt.Assistant Secretary for Policy Development for Homeland Security, ArifAikhan, is a Muslim.Homeland Security Adviser, Mohammed Elibiary, is a Muslim.Obama adviser and founder of the Muslim Public Affairs Council, Salamal-Marayati, is a Muslim.Obama's Sharia Czar, Imam Mohamed Magid, of the Islamic Society of NorthAmerica is a Muslim..Advisory Council on Faith-Based Neighborhood Partnerships, Eboo Patel, is Muslim.1/13/15:?? Nancy Pelosi announced she will appoint Rep Andre Carson, D-Ind,as the first Muslim lawmaker on the House of Representatives PermanentSelect Committee on Intelligence. It would make Carson the first Muslim toserve on the committee that receives intelligence on the threat of Islamicmilitants in the Middle East! He has suggestedthat U.S. schools should be modeled after Islamic madrassas, whereeducation is based on the Quran!!!And last but not least, our closet Muslim himself, Barack Hussein Obama.It's questionable if Obama ever officially took the oath of office when hewas sworn in. He didn't repeat the oath properly to defend ournation andour Constitution. Later the Democrats claimed he was given the oath againin private.CIA director John Brennan took his oath on a copy of the Constitution, nota Bible..??Valarie Jarret wrote her college thesis on how she wanted to change Americainto a Muslim friendly nation and she is a Obama top advisor.Congressman, Keith Ellison took his oath on a copy of the Qur'an.Congresswoman Michele Bachman was vilified and verbally tarred andfeathered by Democrats when she voiced her concern about Muslims taking over our government.Considering all these appointments, it would explain why Obama and hisminions are systematically destroying our nation, supporting radical Muslimgroups worldwide, opening our southern border, and turning a blind eye tothe genocide being perpetrated on Christians all over Africa and the MiddleEast.The more damage Obama does, the more arrogant he's become!Our nation and our government has been infiltrated by people who want todestroy us. It can only get worse!If you fail to pass this one on, there's something wrong.. Somewhere!In his book he said, "if it comes down to it, I would side with theMuslims". (And still, somen insist he isn’t Muslim!)nCommon sense doesn't grow in everyone's garden.  TRUMP all the way, no matter what they throw at him!  Pence and the good people of AMERICA have his back!!  Go Trump/PEnce train...
10 | Kelly Johnson | 67 | 1561474583872566_1561483977204960 | 'Twas the night before the election and all through the houseLittle Donald wasn't tweeting - KelliAnne took his mouse. (And keyboard, the meanie)The children were nestled in their gilded gold bedswhile dreams of daddy's fascism danced in their headsMelania in the nude and Donald in his toupeeDreamed of all the dumb crap he would say the next day.When on Trump tower roof there arose such a clatterHis orangeness fell out of the bed and screamed "what the hell is the matter?!?"Away to the elevator, he stumbled and sniffedHe hit the up button on his 14 carat gold liftHe thought about the fake breasts on his wife, so hot.What was he thinking? Sniffle brain had forgot.When, what do you know, what should appearBut a nasty old woman and what looked like reindeer(Hard to tell with *sniff* bad vision)"Now Biden, and Barack, I'll continue your visionNow Jay-Z and Beyoncé and all my nasty women,Through the glass ceiling - there won't be a wallNow dash away, dash away! Dash away all."And the glass, like rain, started falling downThey looked like crystal tears that on Drumpf's face slid downAway to the White House, Air Force One flewWith a whole lot of votes and Ex-President Bill, tooAnd Trump's shriveled little fingers, like after a bathCurled into tiny little fists, so great was his wrathHe pouted, cried and growled about fixed electionsAbout how bigly were his hands and also his erections.But it did not matter. The die was now cast.America's present would not be like Germany's past.And the only wall the Trump would be currently buildingWas the one around his bank accounts - that were rapidly wiltingHillary went to the Oval Office to continue her work.Drumpf got his Twitter back and remained a big jerk.America took a deep breath and enjoyed the fall.Get a good night's sleep and happy Election Day to all!
11 | Jennifer Ballard | 36 | 1561474583872566_1561492020537489 | We can agree or disagree on many things but nearly all Americans agree Hillairy lies & cannot be trusted.If you agree: You would not leave your kids alone with someone you can not trust or if you would not leave your wallet with someone you know you can not trust then it's also a good decision that you do not leave our Constitutional Rights & our Freedom to the mercy of someone you know can not be trusted.
12 | Vladimir Cruz | 34 | 1561474583872566_1561495050537186 | Too bad she's given our younger generation a lesson, that if you cheat and steal you can still be the President of the United States... a sad day for all the progress women have accomplish in this world. I will teach my two Lil girls that you can be honest and trustworthy and still do great things.
13 | Darin Boué | 27 | 1561474583872566_1561492750537416 | To an awful woman. Women should not want her have that title. They may never get a woman again after what she does. Hold out for a woman you can be proud of.
14 | Nit Thibodeaux | 46 | 1561474583872566_1561479513872073 | This is disgusting!  Glorifying her shows your ignorance and bias...a lying, cheating murderer! MSM helped to sell out the nation!
15 | Chad Palicke | 40 | 1561474583872566_1561494967203861 | Straight up, the Clinton's are what's wrong with our democracy. Both have repeatedly lied straight in the face of the American people and have become multimillionaires by simply being "public servants". And yet, I cannot name 1 thing she's achieved to benefit our county while being in office for decades. She'll never be my president or commander-in chief.
16 | Coni Brooks | 33 | 1561474583872566_1561479553872069 | Oh please. Be surprised how many of people actually just showed up for just the concert. Either candidates have a concert, it does not mean they are there for them.
17 | Jane Whetstine | 37 | 1561474583872566_1561494130537278 | It was a beautiful, moving rally! I've voted! I voted for Hillary Clinton/Tim Kaine and every Democrat down ballot! Let's turn this country blue!
18 | Monica Buchholz | 34 | 1561474583872566_1561479920538699 | How can you morally vote for someone that thinks it is ok to kill by dismemberment a full term infant?How can you morally vote for someone that thinks it is ok to force people to receive medical treatment they do not want?How can you morally vote for someone that has repeatedly shared, stored, deleted classified information knowing they were breaking numerous laws and recklessly endangering countless lives?How can you morally vote for someone that single handedly destroyed numerous womens lives because her husband raped them?How can you morally vote for someone who screams about foreign influences affecting the presidential elections, yet has accepted hundreds of millions in campaign donations from foreign governments?How can you morally vote for someone that collected a few BILLION dollars to rebuild Haiti yet only spent a few million of that in Haiti and pocketed the rest.At what point do your morals kickin?????
19 | Mitch Schuller | 24 | 1561474583872566_1561499433870081 | Let's do this Hillary! F the haters! Taking back our country really means taking it back from the bigots, racists, and misogynists! #VoteBlueDownBallot and keep America, America!
20 | Ginny Roth | 13 | 1561474583872566_1665925140365074 | So many uneducated trolls who understand nothing about our government...and how it works... No one person rules... Ever! If our country is in trouble, there's 100 Senators and 435 Congresspersons, earning a salary of over $170,000 EACH (that YOU pay + benefits) for half a years work, and have done nothing for the last 8 years because they didn't LIKE the new kid on the playground! Get a grip people!
21 | Rebecca Horton ONeill | 12 | 1561474583872566_1196207270455318 | My concern lies more with things DONE NOT SAID...I was asked tonight how I could ever support Trump after the comments he made over 11 years ago about women and if I would still support him if he made those comments to my daughter? My response was this....If he had put our nations security at risk, I would not vote for him. If his organization received large donations from countries that killed women and gays, I would not vote for him. If he boasted 30 Years of government experience, but still could not discern if an email was classified or not, without someone letting him know if it was or not, I would not vote for him. If he boasted about how he has defended children his entire life, but is for abortion, (even late term, when the child can feel pain) I would not vote for him. If he caused lives to be destroyed in Benghazi and then lied to the faces of the parents as they stood at their child's casket, I would not vote for him. If people who came against him mysteriously turned up dead, I would not vote for him. If he suddenly developed a southern accent when he was in the South, campaigning, I would not vote for him. If he continually broke the law and that was ignored, I would not vote for him, but right now, the ONLY person who does ALL these things is Hillary. Right now, the fact that Donald made these remarks over 12 years ago, does not move me. I'm bigger than those remarks and we all have said stupid things throughout our lives. To me, the fact that Hillary lies continuously, is a much bigger problem. We can see the effects of her lies by the state of our poor country right now... Still voting for Trump. Copy/Paste/share....I did... from a fellow deplorable TrumpianPrayers for the USA!!!!
22 | Renee Hall | 12 | 1561474583872566_1561489987204359 | When the news days something bad about Trump, they are lying and being paid off. When they say something bad about about Hilary it must be true. If Trump wins the election it's fair and square if Hillary wins they cheated. Money that Trump can't account for was a legal loop hole, money that Hillary can't account for was stolen. Trump says "mean" things out of his mouth he's just being honest. Hillary says something"mean" she's a racist! Trump offers to put your name on a wall for if you contribute XYZ amount of money it's ok. Hillary has a free concert she's just trying to win votes. I'm so confused....
23 | Michelle Rehmann Gipson | 9 | 1561474583872566_1196198910456154 | beautiful moment in our democracy, as many of us continue striving to create a more perfect union. hoping for 8 more years as with continued economic growth and building on peace, justice and prosperity for all.
24 | Dawn Golby | 12 | 1561474583872566_1561500593869965 | I find it so amusing that so many Trump Deplorable's continue to spew the lies laid down by one of the most corrupt people ever to run for office. Trump supporters are now known for who they are and they will not be able to hide again. America knows who you are now. Thank God that Hillary will be our next President.
25 | Brian Myers | 19 | 1561474583872566_1561485617204796 | With just hours left in the presidential race, Hillary holds a four-point lead over Trump nationally, thank you Lord!! the news yesterday from the FBI director wasn't the news Donald Trump or is supporters wanted to hear, that once again the email probe is over! and Hillary is not guilty of any crime! What is disturbing is that we live in a country where even one single person, never mind millions, believe a narcissistic, racist, egomaniacal sexual predator with the temperament of a middle school bully deserves your precious vote.... between Trump  himself and the mainstream media, they have turned the political process into a reality TV show, What a Sad State of Affairs. Trump shows No empathy for anyone but himself, what  he says isn't just disrespectful, it's repugnant, it has something to do with a combination of his narcissism, and his ego, he lacks the character, values, and experience to be president!

2 | Sandi Kelly | 27 | 1561457553874269_1561470737206284 | My first thought was sex trafficking she's a beautiful lady with a high price attached to her.   I hope I'm wrong and she is found safe.  Sad to watch her husband crying.
3 | Giorgio Luigi Avelar | 29 | 1561457553874269_1561471343872890 | People have no respect and decency anymore! So sad. She is a human being, a mother, sister and daughter for God's sake! Don't bring up politics on this post!
4 | Hilary Williams | 5 | 1561457553874269_1561519577201400 | First off, I sincerely hope that she is found safe. Second and unfortunate, she is a beautiful woman who resembles a much younger female that that appears to be a target age for sex trafficking. Ashton Kutcher has headed a program called "We Are Thorn" that investigates the sex trafficking of minors. Possibly they could assist in this case?
5 | Marsha Cantrell Romanowski | 11 | 1561457553874269_1561542340532457 | I pray that she is found alive, and, unharmed. This world is full of so much evil. It's so sad when you see a husband crying, and, you have children involved. Please, God, let her be found-alive.

15 | Lincoln Duncan | 3 | 1561457553874269_1561465780540113 | She's an archetype of the female form. The monster that took her is under the pressure of time to fulfill what fantasy she must fulfill for him. Her usefulness and his anonymity will extend her life. A very public search for this woman shortens her life.Someone should listen to reason.I could find her. I could.Powerful verb.Honestly, I'm it.

Bruce Springsteen: Trump has a "profound lack of decency that would allow him to prioritize his own interests and ego before American Democracy itself."

Way to use your star power to shed a light on the direction of the country that you support.Lack of decency?? Have u met hillary husband who was getting blow jobs in the Oval Office from an intern??This election isn't about voting for a friend or someone you like.. it's about two very different directions for our country. Focusing on liking or not liking someone over our national security and keeping Americans safe is just ignorant.
2 | Matthew Wynn | 447 | 1561413130545378_1561418817211476 | I just learned today that my grandfather is voting for Clinton. If he were still alive, I would show him wikileaks and project veritas to talk him out of it.

5 | Joseph C. Eyzaguirre | 278 | 1561413130545378_1561418560544835 | MEANWHILE= Wikileaks today releasing its 33rd batch of emails, bringing the total number to more than 55,000 emails released!

I don't want to vote for Clinton who is a liar and who is under investigation. Can't wait for tomorrow's election. Tired of listening to Hillary's lies. Time to lock her up, probably she will be honest for once before she kicks the bucket.
7 | Jim Spears Jr. | 116 | 1561413130545378_1561420360544655 | Talks decincey but hillary has a rapper with profane lyrics in his song and another that dances around half naked shaking her butt crack to the public.

I love how the Hillary supporters completely don't believe she's done anything wrong just because the Corrupt Government let her off.
9 | Paul Stama | 145 | 1561413130545378_1561419593878065 | A Woman's view on TrumpSomeone asked a woman how she could vote for Trump, a “misogynist, a racist and a bigot”.Here is her answer:Because I use my head to research and find out what candidates really are, not what the media wants me to think.Because Donald Trump has more women in executive and managerial positions than any comparable company, which tells me he is not a misogynist.Because he pays these women the same or more than their male counterparts, which tells me looks for capacity and skills in people, not color, gender or race.Because he fought the West Palm Beach City Council to be able to open his newly purchased club, so he could include blacks and Jews as members, who had been banned until then. This tells me he is not a racist.Because he has raised wonderful children who have turned out to be outstanding, hard working and compassionate adults. He must be doing something right. Because his economic plans makes sense, are conservative in nature, and I vote based of what is best for my family, my friends and my country.Because everybody, the left and the right are afraid of him, the media is trying to destroy his image, and even foreign governments are voicing their opinions, so he must be doing something right. Clean house maybe? Because I want a Supreme Court that will uphold the Constitution, not behave as minions of the administration.  I have had enough with judges who are more like political activists than law enforcers.   Because I fear for my family’s safety if the current trend of not confronting blatant terrorism continues – which is a threat to our way of life. Because I am fed up with the rampant corruption of this administration.  Accountability in government is paramount, and as this administration has demonstrated, it is a foreign concept to them.Because I am fed up with the political correctness gone wild, and because Trump is not afraid to say what everybody thinks but does not dare to say. A thug is a thug, regardless of color, and that's it. Because it is about time someone puts America 's interests ahead of other countries. Because I know he recognizes and embraces America 's exceptionalism, and will not tour the World apologizing for who we are. That tells me he is a patriot. Because, unlike HRC, he has actually held a job, worked hard and achieved success. And last, but not least, because I am more offended by what Hillary does than by what Trump says.

15 | Mike McAndrew | 23 | 1561413130545378_1561422530544438 | The people do not trust her....period. This isn't about parties. She is hated on a whole new level. The corruption, lies, deceit is unprecedented. A nasty, nasty person who should be locked up. #draintheswamp
16 | Jean Sepos Rita | 39 | 1561413130545378_1561429993877025 | Loved his performance & speech plus Bon Jovi s in Philly!  What a great turnout for our next president of the US!  Vote Blue up & down ballot!
17 | Jill Schneider | 16 | 1561413130545378_1561436423876382 | Bye Bruce!   You should stick to your only true talent, song writing, your voice has always sucked and your political choices are even worse than your voice.
18 | Eva Martin Dennis | 35 | 1561413130545378_1561423910544300 | Imagine it is November 9, 2016 in America and we wake up knowing who our new President will be. If it is Hillary, think of the groups of people that will celebrate. Illegal Immigrants, criminals and future criminals who will be supported for pulling a gun on a police officer, planned parenthood, the media, and the list goes on and on that represent everything that is wrong with America. If you're still "with her," look around at who you'll be celebrating with. Now imagine waking up knowing that Trump is our new President. You may or may not like him, or really know what kind of president he will be. But here are some things you will know for sure:• The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.• The media has been neutered forever.• Career politicians will have lost all job security.• The guns in your home will safely stay there.• Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.• Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally• Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.• No more apologies to the world for being great!• Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.• Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.• There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.• The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.• The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win....
19 | Maria Quirarte | 11 | 1561413130545378_1561432623876762 | Come on Joseph C. Eyzaguirre, stop your whining !There's nothing criminal in those Emails, it has been proven many times in the other hand there's plenty criminal in Trump businesses, private life, etc, Trump is the one that should be prosecuted.
20 | Patrick S. Phillips | 9 | 1561413130545378_1561433227210035 | I love Mr. Springsteen music and due respect for him. I do not like his political view, we the people need to take a stand and thrive once again to stay alive or we will fall. Bruce has the Freedom of speech like we all do, but don't lead us into a farce of liars and cheats of the Clintons.
21 | Gloria Hightower Eastland | 16 | 1561413130545378_1561439380542753 | Maybe you should meet Bill and get to know Killary on a personal basis. Whoops, you won't get to know her because as soon as she's done using you, you're history
22 | Luis Morais | 21 | 1561413130545378_1561422643877760 | ignore those doctored russian wikileaks propaganda being peddled by trump trolls...the russians and trump' FBI have tried to rig this election for that piggish pussy grabbing conman, thankfully we americans are smarter than that....vote blue and give bernie the senate.
23 | Keith Zeng | 13 | 1561413130545378_1561428563877168 | That's exactly right. His campaign from beginning is all about him. His ego can't be offended or else you can see him jumping and irritating personal attacking. Can any human being imagine what would happen if a nation's fate is under his control?
24 | Tina Nicholas Huffman | 9 | 1561413130545378_1821984081349770 | What's wrong losers? You mad because Bruce Springsteen was invited and you weren't? WAAH!! Too bad cheeto Hitler has no famous friends who will rally for him, except Chaci and another washed up pedophile who calls himself uncle ted
25 | Lindsey Leigh Condon | 9 | 1561413130545378_1561444103875614 | Who cares what he says!   Looks like another con by Hillary to get voters with a concert. She has no decent platform and lies about EVERYTHING,

As President Obama's second term in the White House begins to wind down, take a look back at his historic election night in 2008.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Delmer Rodriguez | 213 | 1561291783890846_1561418350544856 | Obama did what he could with a hostile Congress and a hostile Senate. He brought our economy from one of its worst recessions to a recovering and thriving one with new jobs coming in everyday. He was at least partially responsible for killing our main target Bin Laden and has had many other accomplishments as well. And he ends his cycle with a high approval rating. For me he has been a great President and made the most out of the few resources he had.
2 | Kellie Hassinger Smith | 112 | 1561291783890846_1561424397210918 | Thank you, President Obama and First Lady, Michelle. You are going to be missed so much. I hoping that we can welcome, President Hillary, next. We love you!!
3 | Cary England Collins | 45 | 1561291783890846_1561427927210565 | I don't really think of it as historic but I am happy that they will finally be out of the White House. He did absolutely nothing except stirred up and passed a few controversial issues for people to argue about and ran the country deeper in debt and insurance rates higher...healthcare at this point is ruined from how it used to be...
4 | Cee-Cee Corbin-Ross | 52 | 1561291783890846_1561427257210632 | I'm truly going to miss the Obama's! Job Well done, Mr. President Barack Obama! First Lady, Michelle Obama you did an excellent job! World Class couple! Thank you!!
5 | Jack Fleig | 24 | 1561291783890846_1561433420543349 | Great family!  Highly intelligent, well educated, amazingly knowledgeable, and on top of that, Barack's presentation style and sense of humor are the best I've seen from a politician. Stay in touch!😎
6 | Rick Harmes | 35 | 1561291783890846_1561419633878061 | I'm really sad tonight, I found out that my dad is voting for hillary. If he was still alive I think I could talk him out of it
7 | Joseph Cole III | 21 | 1561291783890846_1561429397210418 | democrats are funny... If you dont vote for obama youre a racist. 8 yrs later if u dont vote for hillary youre a sexist.... Dont fall into the trap cause democrats are full of crap..
8 | Carmen Nys | 28 | 1561291783890846_1561416307211727 | Well… the first female president should be someone to be proud of, not a woman who cheated and lied. She will be more remembered for her scandals than for being the first female president. Is Trump perfect? no, he isn't, but clinton is who will make your life a real hell. Think about it. Thank you!
9 | Terri Ross | 2 | 1561291783890846_1561465987206759 | Thank u thank u mr President ... Gonna miss u !!! N 4 d ones keep saying I be glad when he get out of d White House!!! Let's just b real majority just couldn't stand 2 see a africian American family n d White House !!! Whether u like him r it r not he made HISTORY !!!!! Yes yes yes !!!
10 | Paul Levine | 5 | 1561291783890846_1561437257209632 | 8 years of vacations and sponging off of our tax dollars. Nothing accomplished but a screwed up healthcare program paid by the people who work for the people who dont. Welcome to the new America! Still waiting for my free phone~!
11 | Adin Ducker | 14 | 1561291783890846_1561416177211740 | He was an alright president. Nothing too special. We need someone like FDR, Lincoln, a president that is as close as good as they were. I believe that Hillary and trump aren't the answer. I'm not even a liberal and I much rather have Obama than trump or hillary
12 | Dawn Akers | 10 | 1561291783890846_1561418780544813 | Isn't carrying so much disgusting hate, painful? Everyone is so quick to believe what someone tells them to without basing opinions on facts. What a sad world we live in.
13 | Larry Espino | 2 | 1561291783890846_1561470493872975 | The first Muslim Ant-American President's reign of terror is almost over. Distribute the wealth. The first sign of anti-Capitalism. Open boarders. Let's just except unvetted Muslims to be stratigiclly placed all over our country. Give Iran, the country that repeatedly says "Death to America" nuclear capability and lift they're sanctions. Do you more or less safe since he's been in office?
14 | Renee Newman | 3 | 1561291783890846_1561744327178925 | lol I love how this angers some people!! Get over it!!! 😂 The Obamas will truly be missed!! There's nothing you can do or say to change that!! Why should good human beings anger you? Are you just a miserable human being? This family is inspiring!
15 | Gloria Hightower Eastland | 6 | 1561291783890846_1561436387209719 | One of our downfalls. Hard to believe we were stupid enough to elect him twice. And if Hillary wins, the horror story will get worse.
16 | Anthony Centamore | 0 | 1561291783890846_1561444627208895 | I believe in the American People. The hard working families throughout our country who's challenge is to provide for their children, live from pay check to pay check to pay their bills, try to live a decent and respectful life? All of us can agree we don't like to be cheated, lied to, taken advantage of in sneaky and underhanded ways? I believe they will see before they pull that level where the truth really lies..
17 | Rianna Martinez | 1 | 1561291783890846_1561455467207811 | The thing i remember most about the 2008 election night was Oprah sitting there listening to his acceptance speech and crying. The second election, 2012, i remember we were watching his acceptance speech on fox news and all of a sudden, before the speech was over,  fox just stopped showing him speak and even the anchors were caught off guard, they had been watching a monitor and not even ready for the camera to be on them
18 | David Chess | 0 | 1561291783890846_1561746587178699 | The Middle East on fire in a pre apocalyptic craze, a stagnant economy after almost a decade, spending ten trillion dollars of debt, police murder, racial divide, the political elite rulers, a mess wit Russia stop blaming them till you have proof you could get us killed!!!
19 | Jonette Schmidt | 2 | 1561291783890846_1561509877202370 | This incredible family will be truly missed! Thank you for bringing love, compassion and stability to this country when we needed it the most! Maybe Michelle will run in four years! She has my vote!
20 | Marlissa Netzel | 1 | 1561291783890846_1561531443866880 | I thank you for your service in a horrible time that Bush left us in. Thank You for clearing the way so that a lot of Americans could get health insurance without the pre-exist clause hanging over our heads. HealthCare needs an overhaul from the bottom to the top. And cut the prices and greed. Now we need to stop the landlord from making us homeless do to pot.
21 | Hemant Jindal | 0 | 1561291783890846_1561507490535942 | Mr Obama, today was not your last day in office, do something more important than this. You still have some days if you could reduce some debt of trillions of dollars which our grandchildren have to pay back if not yours or of Clintons.
22 | Don Lee | 0 | 1561291783890846_1561980320488659 | Yep- I will miss them like I miss having the plague! I am happy the other side didn't cave into his and Soros agenda. Go back to Kenya you have cost our country eight years that we will have to overcome and it won't be easy! Historic????? What fools you are to believe the lies and deceit!!!
23 | Ryan Spencer | 3 | 1561291783890846_1561494690537222 | Hes the first to not hit over 3℅ gdp. Brought mass refugees in. And obamacare. He has had his accomplishments and his failures just like any other. I didn't vote for him either time so eh
24 | Craig Giodsir | 20 | 1561291783890846_1561416043878420 | Given the mess that George W Bush handed over, Obama has done a good job.
25 | Brian Cole | 1 | 1561291783890846_1561495850537106 | First black president was a disaster, lets not repeat this with his puppet Killary as the first woman president...good ridance Osama, I mean Obama!!

Hillary Clinton has deployed major star power in her final push, including appearances from Beyoncé, JAY Z, Katy Perry and Bruce Springsteen.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Allen Davis | 330 | 1561385420548149_1561390447214313 | Beyonce is not a person that children can look up to. The election aside, I can't stand her. From her paying a hospital to move other birthing mothers off of an entire floor so she could have privacy (shame on the hospital for accepting as well), to her anti police antics, to her sexually explicit behavior, she is not even close to a good role model.
2 | Mike Shearer | 209 | 1561385420548149_1561388720547819 | A criminal trying to buy weak minded Americans votes...wake up people...she won't help you!!! Hasn't helped anyone but herself in 20+ years in Washington!!!
3 | Duke Slade | 280 | 1561385420548149_1561385550548136 | This is your moment. This is your time to take a stand. When your grandchildren speak of you they will recount that you stood for America. You did not surrender. You did not run away. You held strong for freedom and the Constitution. You defeated Hillary Clinton. You voted Trump. You ensured that America survived.
4 | Don McGregor | 114 | 1561385420548149_1561389383881086 | ⚠️If you are Gay, Why are you voting for Hillary when she wants to bring in thousands of refugees that believe all Gays should be executed?👁⚠️If you are Black, Why are you voting for Hillary when she admires Margaret Sanger and defends Planned Parenthood who want to abort as many black babies as possible? Exterminate the black race because they are like "weeds". (Margaret Sanger quote) Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.👁⚠️If you are a Christian, Why are you voting for Hillary Clinton when she wrote her Senior thesis on Saul Alinsky who dedicated his book 'Rules for Radicals' to Lucifer (the Devil)? She says he was, and still is her mentor.👁⚠️If you are a Veteran, in the Military, or closely related to a Military member, Why are you voting for Hillary when she left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again? They called for help but the help was told to stand down.👁⚠️If you have a factory job, Why are you voting for Hillary when she supported TPP? Factory workers are being laid off because jobs are going over seas. Don't forget the deals she's made with china. She also welcomes open borders and illegals to get benefits to be paid with Your tax money.👁⚠️If you are poor, Why are you voting for Hillary, when she is supporting Wall street and all the big banks? Big banks keep poor people poor by destroying the poor man's credit by allowing medical bills and collections to affect your credit scores so you can pay higher interest rates than the rich; Taking much of the little money you earn.👁⚠️If you are a Woman, how can you vote for Hillary when she has buried all of Bills rape victims under the rug, including that little girl that was raped? Lawyer Hillary defended the rapist, and then she laughed about it later, knowing that he was guilty.If you carry a gun, or believe in the Constitution; How can you vote for Hillary when she wants to eliminate the NRA, Take your guns, and abolish the second Amendment?👁⚠️If you breathe, Why would you vote for Hillary when she and the Clinton crime family have left a trail of dead people that did not agree with her, or they knew too much?Who is left? (please copy and paste this all over the Internet thank you)
5 | Michael Sulkis | 76 | 1561385420548149_1561389763881048 | Because I am not capable of making up my mind...so thankful a former drug dealing thug pictured above is helping the email losing lying criminal! Hollywood....what would we do without you????
6 | Ryan Shipley | 78 | 1561385420548149_1561386330548058 | Not to be outdone, Trump just had a concert featuring Ted Nugent, the cast of According to Jim and Scott Baio doing card tricks
7 | Lisa Taylor | 40 | 1561385420548149_1561394283880596 | Uhhhhh..... Look who she has "deployed!" Not much going on with those choices..... They have about as much integrity as she does, and that's not saying much! Last I checked, Jay Z demoralizes women with his music, no?! Oh, and his wife? A good role model? Uh, I think not! Wasn't she the "celebrity" that paid off the hospital, moving all the mothers in labor off the floor, so she could have privacy? Wow is all I can say!! Talk about entitlement!!
8 | John Sutton | 34 | 1561385420548149_1561397923880232 | why would any female vote for clinton?she gets her money from known muslim organizations. islam treats women lower than dirt and clinto is accepting money from them? no wonder she needs help of celebrities.at this point only a complete idiot is willing to throw away all those hard earned freedoms to a woman who is still lying to everyone. better get used to being covered from head to toe and learn what sharia law is with an idiot like clinton in charge, she is only going to hurt this country worse, starting with you females.
9 | Billy D'Antoni | 42 | 1561385420548149_1561389960547695 | Musicians and actors need to keep their politcal views to themselves and just do their job and entertain me. With that being said Welcome to my boycott list boyonce, jzee, katy perry, milie cyrus, bruce Springsteen, and bon jovi.
10 | James E. Perkins | 30 | 1561385420548149_1561394597213898 | For some reason they want us to beleive that the Cellebrities is smarter than us. I bet more than half of them couldn't tell you who is running for Congress in their state. What makes them so smart? Nothing Cher!
11 | Kathi Vargo | 18 | 1561385420548149_1561391357214222 | Hold it are we voting for a president or who has the most talented friends..um Hillary this isn't American idol..this is the picture you want us to remember going to vote Hillary..you on a stage with Beyoncé...
12 | Kyle DeBerg | 12 | 1561385420548149_1561424190544272 | So laughable and hypocritical. Isn't this the woman who constantly bashes Trump for his explicit behavior and language about women? I guess jayz is the perfect candidate to push the feminism ideology, and the perfect role model for the treatment of women. Lol.
13 | Jason Griggs | 13 | 1561385420548149_1561412887212069 | In my personal opinion. With everything she's had coming against her.Throughout her whole campaign. Especially as of late. All of these big concerts.Just sound like a last ditch effort and desperation
14 | Sophie Wmb | 8 | 1561385420548149_1561445550542136 | It's hard to believe that this was the best choices Beyoncé and jaz z  could come up with.  It seemed totally inappropriate and the language unacceptable.  Had any other candidate play that, I'm sure it would it would have been blasted for the vulgar content that was used
15 | Stephanie Campbell Grzybowski | 9 | 1561385420548149_1561425773877447 | It's amazing to me that Hillary has had Huge star power behind her and major political support and donors compared to Trump. Trump has had none yet the race is so tight. Hillary has had to bribe people for votes. With Trump you take him or leave him. I just find that fact very fascinating. Hillary would not have been able to pull this off without the support from the big names. Not at all.
16 | Rasha Kadamani | 13 | 1561385420548149_1561396540547037 | Away from the presidential race...Just wondering, why should we be influenced by singers and dancers, in our decision about politics or other issues that matter!

18 | BEn Skocik | 21 | 1561385420548149_1561397310546960 | All the money her campaign is paying these celebs to show up at her rallies so she can actually draw a crowd because she can't draw one herself could feed 5 third world countries but her and the celebs care about you guy lmaooo
19 | Carrie Beth Buzzelli | 7 | 1561385420548149_1561403060546385 | She was the one caught saying"“I’m grateful, but do we really need to listen to this ghetto trash music?

( Example )Hillary Clinton 11/3/2016:" I was a little anxious during my speech because the Cubs were playing in the World Series I have been a fan all my life. "Hillary Clinton 1998:" The fact is I've always been a Yankees fan...as a young girl I became very interested and enamored of the Yankees."She can not even be honest to her supporters about her favorite baseball team. SMH
22 | Christopher Fraser | 8 | 1561385420548149_1561393743880650 | Trump Tweeted a couple of days ago, that he didn't need to have "Jay Z, Beyoncé and J-lo" show up for him!What he doesn't seem to understand, is that they wouldn't show up for him!Although he's lucky that the D-listers, came through, "Scott Baio" and " Ted Nugent"!Do either of them, even have viable careers anymore?
23 | Jose Ivan Montoya | 10 | 1561385420548149_1561391803880844 | All this crazy publicity , corrupt media and she is still struggling to win against a more or less easy political opponent!Just proves what a horrible corrupt and unpopular politician she is!If she wins it's because of money and corruption nothing else and American will become the most corrupt country in the world !

25 | Teresa Perkins | 1 | 1561385420548149_724372081051409 | I was asked tonight how I could ever support Trump after the comments he made over 11 years ago about women and if I would still support him if he made those comments to my daughters? My response was this....If he had put our nations security at risk, I would not vote for him. If his organization received large donations from countries that killed women and gays, I would not vote for him. If he boasted 30 Years of government experience, but still could not discern if an email was classified or not, without someone letting him know if it was or not, I would not vote for him. If he boasted about how he has defended children his entire life, but is for abortion, (even late term, when the child can feel pain) I would not vote for him. If he caused lives to be destroyed in Benghazi and then lied to the faces of the parents as they stood at their child's casket, I would not vote for him. If people who came against him mysteriously turned up dead, I would not vote for him. If he suddenly developed a southern accent when he was in the South, campaigning, I would not vote for him. If he continually broke the law and that was ignored, I would not vote for him, but right now, the ONLY person who does ALL these things is Hillary. Right now, the fact that Donald made these remarks over 12 years ago, does not move me. I'm bigger than those remarks and we all have said stupid things throughout our lives. To me, the fact that Hillary lies continuously, is a much bigger problem. We can see the effects of her lies by the state of our poor country right now... Rant over... I VOTED FOR TRUMP!!. Copy/Paste from a fellow deplorable Trumpian like me!

"I'm turning my mourning into a movement and my sorrow into a strategy," Gwen Carr, Eric Garner's mother, said. "Now my pain has a powerful purpose."

We can either vote to keep the same corrupt system, the same stagnant economy, and to continue our decline in standing on the world stage, or we can vote for change and send a message that we've had enough of business as usual, that we are tired of the corruption in Washington, and that We The People have had enough. If you think that this is a good as we can do, then vote for Hillary Clinton. If you think that we can rise to greater heights, greater aspirations, and to better our nation for ourselves and our children, vote for Donald J. Trump. The choice is clear.
2 | Chuck Steinell | 90 | 1561366430550048_1561373190549372 | I have a strategy for you Mom, teach your kids and grandkids to obey police instructions, not resist arrest, and certainly do not choose to scuffle with police when you are morbidly obese, have asthma and a bad heart.   That is an excellent strategy.
3 | Anita Ferjánsz Marten | 35 | 1561366430550048_1561369773883047 | ....Hilary doesn't know anything about sorrow...she's never lost someone to a senseless crime or in a war..how can women stand with a woman who can't even relate?....They say to be a drug couselor you have to have been a drug addict at some point and got help...now you can help others...SHE'S never walked in their shoes...she just scrounging for votes like a bottom feeder...
4 | Ren DV | 45 | 1561366430550048_1561366820550009 | Never in my lifetime that I've prayed in behalf of a particular politician; especially one who's running for US President. Not even to my own country that I ever did it for our own leaders; only now! I just really hope God listens; and delivers the win for Donald J. Trump; so as he be reckoned the 45th President of the United States of America.
5 | Matthew Gibert | 18 | 1561366430550048_1561373857215972 | because Clinton will protect all black people from the injustices of racism!!!!!......not even in your greatest dreams is this even possible much less relevant, just the newest political pawn
6 | Gary Doan | 22 | 1561366430550048_1561369193883105 | Electing a criminal is anti-American. I've never liked Trump, but he is the only person capable of taking on the corrupt media. That, my friends takes bravery. We have no choice, he will take on government corruption and inefficiency. I don't have to like him, to happily hire him for the job at hand. He will need to sell both sides of Congress on any plans and he is a good negotiator. Give him a chance, we might win.
7 | Shary Griesfeller | 5 | 1561366430550048_1561374740549217 | It’s hard for “everyday Americans” to understand how Hillary Clinton could laugh after declaring, “We came, we saw, he died,” referring to the death of Moammar Gadhafi; or how she could lead a NATO bombing effort that killed thousands in Libya and destabilized the country; or how she could look Gold Star parents directly in the eyes at a casket ceremony three days after the Benghazi terror attack and lie to them about why their children died.Read more at http://mobile.wnd.com/2016/11/why-hillary-is-too-evil-for-voters-to-comprehend/#YThtJ0qf5KHDbDlB.99
8 | Anthony Centamore | 3 | 1561366430550048_1561444817208876 | I believe in the American People. The hard working families throughout our country who's challenge is to provide for their children, live from pay check to pay check to pay their bills, try to live a decent and respectful life? All of us can agree we don't like to be cheated, lied to, taken advantage of in sneaky and underhanded ways? I believe they will see before they pull that level where the truth really lies..
9 | Alexander Bahal | 2 | 1561366430550048_1561445303875494 | Yawn! Hopefully after the election we see less single mothers, that failed their children, raised nothing but losers and then whine about racism and white privilege. The mainstream news already didn't cover the most recent police vs black man shootings, it's not interesting anymore, no ratings and these old hags will soon be history, too.
10 | Tyler Duczeminski | 12 | 1561366430550048_1561371403882884 | Look, the average Democrat voter is just plain stupid. They're easy to manipulate. That's the easy part. -Hillary Clinton, as told to Dick Morris in "Rewriting History", 2005
11 | Doug Holm | 3 | 1561366430550048_1561379523882072 | Maybe if you had brought your son up teaching him a little respect on stead of being a nigg*r in the hood he'd still be alive. Think about it!
12 | Ryan Spencer | 11 | 1561366430550048_1561368747216483 | Idiots 😂 she is supporting thugs. Vote trump kick this chick out of this country
13 | John Malys | 0 | 1561366430550048_1561798110506880 | What has changed for black Americans in the last eight years. Please answer me that question. The Democrats have still done nothing to help and everything to divide. Stand up and change this
14 | Alexander Polo | 0 | 1561366430550048_1561435653876459 | Trump or his followers don't know what it's like in those communities, neither does Hillary. But trump sure as the sun rises will not do or give a dam about them either. I have never seen so much hate openly in this country since he started running for office. It sure brought out the people like him out of the closet. And those who claim to be Christian. We will all be judged by God, and be dealt with. No matter who wins. And I can sleep very comfortably not voting for him, and joining all the bigotry.
15 | Jeanine Gardner-Anderson | 0 | 1561366430550048_1561988597154498 | No matter who wins today, learn to rethink your posts for the good of all the people in this great nation. May the rhetoric and childish behavior be a thing of the past. May all people learn to stand together again as one nation built on the diversity of many immigrants from many lands. Put your country first by respecting each other again.
16 | Avon Voss | 2 | 1561366430550048_1561391120547579 | White supremacist and Alt right Nazi's support Trump...his followers either don't realize it or don't care or they are white supremacist and or Nazis...haven't they figured out by now that those movements don't work?...Hitler found out the hard way.
17 | Fida Khan | 1 | 1561366430550048_1561389130547778 | unfit fitness with all low IQ people around the gang of 4= 2 Obamaa and 2 Clinton will the neutralized by tomorrow..wait and see cast your vote 1st
18 | Bobby Cordell | 2 | 1561366430550048_1561378060548885 | Ask yourself who would captain america vote for, pretty certain the "Orange skull and his neo nazi supporters would be the villians in a marvel plot with cap trying to stop them.
19 | Jill Schneider | 1 | 1561366430550048_1561389983881026 | I don't know about Mrs. Garner and the others that have lost their sons, but if that criminal skank Leslie McFadden is involved in this, they have no credibility.
20 | G.J. Dunston | 1 | 1561366430550048_1561376877215670 | I find it comical when people say they're voting for the lesser of 2 evils. Does that mean if Hitler and Stalin were running for president, people would vote for the one that murdered Less people?
21 | Edward Ganley | 1 | 1561366430550048_1561462533873771 | Good one NBC News. Hillary has those Mothers preaching at us about how awful the police are, because their children were killed by the police while most of there people were killed while in the line a doing a crime. Look NBC tell the whole story, some of those people that were killed were doing wrong, and you only pointed the finger at the police. You NBC News people are gutless over paid by Hillary useless reporters.
22 | Charles Hatch | 0 | 1561366430550048_1561378107215547 | Obviously Donald Trump is not going to win,and a lot of Americans will not be celebrating Hillary Clinton 270 electoral vote win.Very sad and depressing 2016 electoral
23 | Jack Griffin | 2 | 1561366430550048_1561391447214213 | Typical lib stance..blame everybody except the criminal.... If they spent as much time parenting as they do protesting rioting looting etc.. maybe their kids would turn out better
24 | Regina Anderson | 1 | 1561366430550048_1561376140549077 | POINTS TO PONDER BEFORE ELECTION DAY :If you are Gay, why are you voting for Hillary?

25 | Rick Martinez | 1 | 1561366430550048_1561397043880320 | We need to be well aware that things are very dangerous here, not only all this white supremacy groups, but listen, Trump already said … he will nominate right-wingers to the Supreme Court. So there are dangers. Executive, Legislative and Judicial branches will be in the hands of Trump? We are not that insane as a country ... yet.
