Before launching on a four-month mission, Shane Kimbrough said it was going to be special to be able to say, "I voted from space."

1 | Ed Chapman | 41 | 10154774196501336_10154774196926336 | Jesus please have favor on this country. Hear from Your people and heal our land. Forgive us for turning from you. Help us to long for your will, not our own. Give us strength for the days ahead, forgiveness for our fellow man, and love for this broken and hurting world. May this nation once again be a nation of strong, prosperous, and compassionate people.. and let it begin with Your Church. Don't let us settle for mediocrity. Don't let us become complacent with the evil around us. Don't let us stop sharing the Gospel. May we become a Christian nation heaven-bent on winning souls for an eternity with You.
2 | Alisha Gamboa | 20 | 10154774196501336_10154774198581336 | Imagine it is November 9, 2016 in America and we wake up knowing who our new President will be. If it is Hillary, think of the groups of people that will celebrate. Illegal Immigrants, criminals and future criminals who will be supported for pulling a gun on a police officer, planned parenthood, the media, and the list goes on and on that represent everything that is wrong with America. If you're still "with her," look around at who you'll be celebrating with. Now imagine waking up knowing that Trump is our new President. You may or may not like him, or really know what kind of president he will be. But here are some things you will know for sure:‚Ä¢ The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.‚Ä¢ The media has been neutered forever.‚Ä¢ Career politicians will have lost all job security.‚Ä¢ The guns in your home will safely stay there.‚Ä¢ Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.‚Ä¢ Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally‚Ä¢ Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.‚Ä¢ No more apologies to the world for being great!‚Ä¢ Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.‚Ä¢ Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.‚Ä¢ There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.‚Ä¢ The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.‚Ä¢ The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.
3 | Mike Howard | 1 | 10154774196501336_10154774228121336 | REASONS TO NOT VOTE HILLARY..copy and share‚ö†Ô∏èIf you are Gay, Why are you voting for Hillary when she wants to bring in thousands of refugees that believe all Gays should be executed?üëÅ‚ö†Ô∏èIf you are Black, Why are you voting for Hillary when she admires Margaret Sanger and defends Planned Parenthood who want to abort as many black babies as possible? Exterminate the black race because they are like "weeds". (Margaret Sanger quote) Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.üëÅ‚ö†Ô∏èIf you are a Christian, Why are you voting for Hillary Clinton when she wrote her Senior thesis on Saul Alinsky who dedicated his book 'Rules for Radicals' to Lucifer (the Devil)? She says he was, and still is her mentor.üëÅ‚ö†Ô∏èIf you are a Veteran, in the Military, or closely related to a Military member, Why are you voting for Hillary when she left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again? They called for help but the help was told to stand down.üëÅ‚ö†Ô∏èIf you have a factory job, Why are you voting for Hillary when she supported TPP? Factory workers are being laid off because jobs are going over seas. Don't forget the deals she's made with china. She also welcomes open borders and illegals to get benefits to be paid with Your tax money.üëÅ‚ö†Ô∏èIf you are poor, Why are you voting for Hillary, when she is supporting Wall street and all the big banks? Big banks keep poor people poor by destroying the poor man's credit by allowing medical bills and collections to affect your credit scores so you can pay higher interest rates than the rich; Taking much of the little money you earn.üëÅ‚ö†Ô∏èIf you are a Woman, how can you vote for Hillary when she has buried all of Bills rape victims under the rug, including that little girl that was raped? Lawyer Hillary defended the rapist, and then she laughed about it later, knowing that he was guilty.If you carry a gun, or believe in the Constitution; How can you vote for Hillary when she wants to eliminate the NRA, Take your guns, and abolish the second Amendment?üëÅ‚ö†Ô∏èIf you breathe, Why would you vote for Hillary when she and the Clinton crime family have left a trail of dead people that did not agree with her, or they knew too much?Who is left? üëÅ....written by Mary lab

So when voting electronically double check to make sure your ballot reads the way you checked it especially for President!Feel free to SHARE!!!
5 | Jeff Jacob | 14 | 10154774196501336_10154774197806336 | Woo Hoo!! Today's the day!!! Get out there and vote and just remember what the Philosopher Joseph de Maistre said, "Every nation gets the government it deserves".The question is do we "deserve" another career politician with the same old stale failed ideas who is already under TWO federal investigations or do we "deserve" better for this country and try to Make America Great Again?Go Donald Go!
6 | Wayne R Johnson | 7 | 10154774196501336_10154774198411336 | It is because of my faith that I cast a vote for a viable candidate in elections, not in Lieu of my faith.In my humble opinion...When Christians are silent there is but one voice left speaking. Our Vote is our voice as with the parable of the talents. The man who chose to do nothing with his one talent was admonished and it was taken awayYesterday I was asked; "Shall we stand before the Lord and reply:  "Yes, I sided with evil, and gave it my vote, but at least I did something?"No, We that vote shall stand before the Lord and reply: "Lord, since there were No perfect people on earth I did the best I could with what you gave me. I took my talent (my vote) and invested it in the person who's platform of issues most aligned with doing and allowing us to continue to do your will and spread the message of Christ in the Country we lived.Christian's know, Satan influences this world so why be surprised when our candidates have lived worldly lives? Early-on trump embraced the influence of Ben Carson, then chose Mike Pence for his running mate. (pretty good influences still, not perfect men). Christ said; "for the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which was lost.‚Äù  To rephrase my earlier point and reiterate; If all Christians were silent with their votes, we leave only non-Christians voting. How does this help us spread the message of Christ?As Christians we have the Bible as our standard to help us discern right and wrong. We should be leading and teaching with our discernment and understanding. Not, hiding it under a bush because of evils presence.Evangelism should be done through everything that we do as it in itself is action. My hope is not pinned on politics nor men.  I do believe Jesus gave us a purpose and we have an obligation to do all we can to fulfill that purpose. Our vote in this country is a gift to protect our rights in this nation. To share the message of Christ rather than continuously sitting in silence as they are systematically removed, in the name of political correctness. Political correctness is merely a harness for Truth. We need to stop restraining truth before we no longer recognize it.If Christians are not spreading the seed we are allowing  Satan to take over the farmland."If I never make a difference, it won't be because I didn't try" ~wrj
7 | Zach Kerman | 11 | 10154774196501336_10154774197246336 | Michelle Obama said if Donald Trump is elected: "We're telling our sons it's okay to humiliate women. We're telling our daughters this is how they deserve to be treated.".... that's funny. So does that mean that if Hillary Clinton is elected, we are teaching our sons & daughters that it's ok to murder, lie, cover up, be corrupt, demean women, use racial slurs, and stay with a spouse that openly rapes women & cheats on you?

15 | Denise A Spencer | 3 | 10154774196501336_10154774196661336 | It's not government that is the problem... it's the republican fascists that we elect to run it who intend to use it for the benefit of an oligarch that is the problem. Government is the only power that can stand up to corporations and the oligarch. Those that attack government are the ones trying to destroy it for a fascists form of oligarchy.... we still have government, just run by corporate power.... what republican and Trumps policy is....

Of all the egregious and heinous acts accused of the Clintons this one is indicative of the greed and malcontent these people have for themselves and others. They have more than they will ever need and instead of Bill or Hill grabbing the cash to get their daughter married out of pocket, like most every other US family would do, they raid their own charity making it a personal honeypot. What a loving family with core values.

1 | Amaury Francisco Guerrero | 447 | 10154774046631336_10154774048431336 | Today is the day when we will know who is gonna run the country for the next four years. Today the American people have the choice to pick between a war criminal, pathological liar, unethical, corrupt, warmonger,  Wall Street puppet  or a man who despite not being perfect wants to do the right thing for his country and its people. Today we have a choice. We either choose more of the same or we choose real change. Hillary represents everything that is wrong with the country and Trump represents real change and real hope. Hopefully smart people outnumber the brainwashed minions and Trump wins tonight..
2 | Steve Lowery | 295 | 10154774046631336_10154774049391336 | Hillary will not become the next President. America will ultimately do the right thing. Her political career, lies and corruption are almost over.

5 | Darlene Martindell | 56 | 10154774046631336_10154774056626336 | Today We are going to put Mr TRUMP and Mr PENCE in the Whitehouse . Can you feel it? Can you hear it?

6 | Michelle Branch Oliver | 28 | 10154774046631336_10154774068361336 | FOX NEWS:  You don't normally do this but you have continued to refer to blue collar people as uneducated because they do not have a college degree and the implication is that blue collar workers are second class citizens or have lower IQ's than those with a college degree.  Well, those blue collar workers keep your lights on, keep your water flowing, keep your streets paved and we are intelligent people who have perfected our craft and many actually have a college degree but have chosen to do blue collar jobs either because they want to work with their hands or they couldn't get a job with their expensive college degree.  Please stop referring to blue collar workers as people with little intelligence!

9 | Jeni Jarvis | 26 | 10154774046631336_10154774058646336 | I was asked how I could ever support Trump after the comments he made over 11 years ago about women and if I would still vote for him. My response was this....If he had put our nations security at risk, I would not vote for him. If his organization received large donations from countries that killed women and gays, I would not vote for him. If he boasted 30 Years of government experience, but still could not discern if an email was classified or not, without someone letting him know if it was or not, I would not vote for him. . If he caused lives to be destroyed in Benghazi and then lied to the faces of the parents as they stood at their child's casket, I would not vote for him. If people who came against him mysteriously turned up dead, I would not vote for him. If he suddenly developed a southern accent when he was in the South, campaigning, I would not vote for him. If he continually broke the law and that was ignored, I would not vote for him, but right now, the ONLY person who does ALL these things is Hillary. Right now, the fact that Donald made these remarks over 12 years ago, does not move me. I'm bigger than those remarks and we all have said stupid things throughout our lives. To me, the fact that Hillary lies continuously, is a much bigger problem. We can see the effects of her lies by the state of our poor country right now... Rant over... Still voting for Trump. Copy/Paste from a fellow deplorable Trumpian.

Christian faith says God knew us before we were born and thou shall not kill, Muslim faith states a fetus is a living soul at 4 months and Jewish faith states abortion is forbidden with exception given according to Jewish scholar Rashi In regard to life-risking pregnancies, How is it so many woman are voting for a person that will uphold the practice of late term abortion?

When people are making their choices individually and they go back to check their ballot it's been changed to Democrat.

Is that democracy? What if they belong to the same group or organization and a vote for any of them means the same? Democracy would be to write on the ballot the name we wanted.

24 | Joe Skinner | 3 | 10154774046631336_10154774059931336 | A young lady at a game was asked, how she could vote for Trump, a ‚Äúmisogynist, a racist and a bigot‚Äù.Here is her answer:Because I use my head to research and find out what candidates really are, not what the media wants me to think.Because Donald Trump has more women in executive and managerial positions than any comparable company, which tells me he is not a misogynist.Because he pays these women the same or more than their male counterparts, which tells me looks for capacity and skills in people, not color, gender or race.Because he fought the West Palm Beach City Council to be able to open his newly purchased club, so he could include blacks and Jews as members, who had been banned until then. This tells me he is not a racist.Because he has raised wonderful children who have turned out to be outstanding, hard-working and compassionate adults. He must be doing something right.Because his economic plans makes sense, are conservative in nature, and I vote based of what is best for my family, my friends and my country.Because everybody, the left and the right are afraid of him, the media is trying to destroy his image, and even foreign governments are voicing their opinions, so he must be doing something right. Clean house maybe?Because I want a Supreme Court that will uphold the Constitution, not behave as minions of the administration. I have had enough with judges who are more like political activists than law enforcers.Because I fear for my family‚Äôs safety if the current trend of not confronting blatant terrorism continues ‚Äì which is a threat to our way of life.Because I am fed up with the rampant corruption of this administration. Accountability in government is paramount, and as this administration has demonstrated, it is a foreign concept to them.Because I am fed up with the political correctness gone wild, and because Trump is not afraid to say what everybody thinks but does not dare to say. A thug is a thug, regardless of color, and that's it.Because it is about time someone puts America's interests ahead of other countries.Because I know he recognizes and embraces America's exceptionalism, and will not tour the World apologizing for who we are. That tells me he is a patriot.Because, unlike HRC, he has actually held a job, worked hard and achieved success.And last, but not least, because I am more offended by what Hillary does than by what Trump says.
25 | Keith Johnson | 1 | 10154774046631336_10154774151671336 | I Voted Trump! Voted for the Great Wall. To protect Americans. Not to favor criminal illegal aliens with a free pass. Tired of that crap! Voting for law and order, pro-life, Christian values, growth of American jobs. Less Government, And our rights to the Second Amendment. Vote Trump if want the above.

2 | P.j. Davis | 164 | 10154773922301336_10154773951211336 | The web of deceit and denial the Clintons built is large and has reached many corners of our country and beyond. Please preserve our country and our Constitution. Vote Republican only. TRUMP 2016!!!
3 | Christopher William Chamberlin | 26 | 10154773922301336_10154773963016336 | Today as we head to our places and polling let us all remember that we are not voting for ourselves we are voting for the future of our grandchildren and great-grandchildren exercising a right granted in our constitution. May we all vote with a clear conscience and resolution for the candidate whom we see fits best.I am voting for a future for my children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren with a clear conscience I will cast my ballot for Donald J Trump. I believe in a secure and free of America, not in America dictated to by tyrannical government or corporate-owned politicians and special interest groups! As we cast our ballots today we are firing the first shots in our second revolution a revolution not fought with bullets and bombs but with voices and pens. Today "We the People" take back our great nation and make it once again a nation "Of the People, By the People, For the People"!God Bless America, and God bless the American people!

5 | Debby Havard Slater | 14 | 10154773922301336_10154773942561336 | This is happening at two of our polling stations nearby:FYI polls at the community center in Jackson County, Mississippi apparently aren't working at the moment (coincidental I know)  and no paper ballots as back up. No way to vote until it is fixed. Line is wrapped around the building!!! We got up early to come vote- have to come back.
6 | Mike N Razel | 16 | 10154773922301336_10154773955716336 | Today is ALL about the Presidency. Today will either make or break our country. A vote for Clinton will simply finish off the job Obama started.
7 | Sharon Louise | 24 | 10154773922301336_10154773944976336 | And everyone needs to look up emotional intelligence. This needs to be the most important thing we teach our children. From now on, it should be at the top of the list. Without it you are food for the liberals. The Liberals cannot brainwash people who are emotionally intelligent. People who make decisions with their head and not their heart cannot be used or exploited by desperate liberals who seek money and power and you are out to corrupt the government. Emotional intelligence is more important than any of the other intelligences that can be measured. Seriously. Look it up. Use it. Teach it. God bless America.

10 | Kathy Mary | 6 | 10154773922301336_10154773955386336 | The set up was completely different this year where we vote!One line to sign in and another line waiting to vote. People were just walking in and standing in the line to vote. We kept telling people you have to sign in first. There was no one monitoring this and we just reported it to the PA board of Elections! Yes we voiced our concern to the constable there and she said we're watching. It's BS! You're supposed to sign in and go straight to the voting booth! The PA board of elections and our county official said they're on their way there now. Praying they are!

12 | Cliff Snuffer | 6 | 10154773922301336_10154773968086336 | No matter who wins the election today, one fact was proven that nobody can deny. The federal government as it stands today is at the deepest depths of corruption. From pay to play, backroom deals, special interests and lobbyists, and list goes on. We, the American citizens, are just pawns in their get rich quick scheme. They only care about us until they get our vote. Then it's off to Washington where they turn their total attention to the special interests who line these politician's pockets with money. We become an after thought in their crooked minds. We are already taxed at an unbelievable rate and they just keep wanting more and more of our hard earned money. The size and corruption of our government is not what the brave men and women who found this great nation had envisioned. That's a fact. Feel free to share if you agree!!!

17 | Kat Meyers | 1 | 10154773922301336_10154774132461336 | From Henderson Ky:It's right now 6:01 am. I am so upset I'm at the point of tears.I was appointed as the Republican judge at a local election site. The Holy Spirit distinctly pointed out about the voting machines being set up while I was getting ready to leave my house. I got there on time and sure enough, the sheriff (appointed election officer) and the democratic judge had already opened the voting machines and set them up and their excuse was, well we got here early and it's the way we've always done it.REALLY!?!?The law and procedure state they must be opened together by the Republican judge and the Democratic judge! I called the county election office and she tried to convince me that it was fine, yada yada yada. So I go back in and the dem judge is telling me they did this and this and this (all the procedures for opening up the machines and getting the ballots out and privacy screens set up) and he said "I'm an honest person" to which I replied,  that's what Hillary Clinton says too. Then he had the nerve to ask me to sign off on the verification form of opening the machines.Are you kidding me??By then I was off the chain! I said, there's no way in all good conscience that I will sign that form. I called the election office again and spoke to the county clerk. I told her what happened and that I'm leaving. I will not participate in forging a verification. Again she tried to assure me that the ballot print out would show 0 votes and it would be fine. I told her I'm leaving and you can get someone here to replace me and I'm reporting it. Stupid people!!Everything done decently and in order. I think not!!!Praying for the next right steps in documenting and reporting this!!

24 | Paul Jordan | 0 | 10154773922301336_10154774119566336 | Today we have a choice in remembering what is and was great in our country, or continuing to see our parents America evolve into something they would have wished better for us. We get to change direction for our childrens lives, for their security, and for the generations beyond them. Our fathers fought for the ability to stand tall and be safe, our mothers taught us values and family tradition. When we see todays role models we see them kneeling at our national anthem, we see young girls on stage teaching our girls vulgar lessons, we hear words in their music that is disrespectful to all. We do not see our soldiers saluted as the heroes they are, our police not able to have the support of our leaders, and a country so divided that the world laughs.... today is the day to take back our country and make our parents life long battles be worth it. God Bless the USA..... Vote for a better America!!

7 | Laura J Kushto | 136 | 10154773807401336_10154773826216336 | If woman are voting for Hillary just because she is a woman. She sure does not represent the kind of woman and mother I am. She is a liar, arrogant, doesn't know a thing about how we Americans live. She is a cheat, and has done nothing in the thirty years in politics to be proud of, but made herself very rich. Living off the backs of Americans.  Surely we could find a far better woman. Not to mention she has taught her daughter nothing, but how to live like her and Bill, not a good mother either. So instead of me saying have a good day I say have the day you deserve, let karma decide your day.

It's disgraceful how other media outlets have basically campaigned for HRC.  From Vogue & NY Times to MSNBC & ABC, it's appalling how they've skewed the truth, spun & framed a story in favor of Hillary.  I've been truly educated during this past year.  The mainstream media wants to control how and what we think.  Very scary! Donald Trump was humble & grateful this morning during his interview.  So different from when he is harassed by mainstream reporters. I am hopeful Americans who still think for themselves rock the polls today! Again, thank you, Fox News for fair reporting!

It's time we all look to God to deliver us from our current situation and for us to put Him at the forefront of our lives. But we have to vote to do that!! Do you want more gov't control of your lives? Or, are we willing to get on our knees, unite in prayer and work as a team to restore this great nation? God brings people into our lives for a reason. Trump is running for a reason. Let's get out and vote today and wake up with a brighter vision and real hope for the days that lie ahead. It's going to be a hard job - Are you ready?? I am!! Please join me, we can't afford to wait any longer!!
17 | Cathy-Eugene Barno | 25 | 10154773807401336_10154773868196336 | There is no other reason to vote, but to vote for the unborn. I cannot get the horrible sight of an unborn baby in the ninth month of pregnancy, having it's head crushed. Hillary thinks that is okay. She said it in the last debate.  If the baby can be partially born, then it can be wholly born. I will be the voice of that beautiful image of God, a newborn baby...the most beautiful sight on earth.

I could not vote for Hillary just because she is a woman, I have absolutely no respect for her and everybody probably knows why I don't. I pray that everyone will get out and vote so we can have our country back, I have never seen our country so divided as it is today and I want it back to where we are all one, we're not black, White , red or any other color,but we are one.

But I will tonight just so I can see how they react when Donald becomes the President elect. :) That first debate epitimized everything wrong with the news media today. So called "journalists" and "news organizations" not reporting news and leaving us to draw our own conclusions but rather to try and shape the news because somehow they know whats good for us better than we do. And isn't that what is wrong with the political establishment?

25 | Maria F Lewis | 15 | 10154773807401336_10154773834541336 | Fact: The Republican Party was founded primarily to oppose slavery, and Republicans eventually abolished slavery. The Democratic Party fought them and tried to maintain and expand slavery. The 13th Amendment, abolishing slavery, passed in 1865 with 100% Republican support but only 23% Democrat support in congress.&#10;&#10;Fact: During the Civil War era, the "Radical Republicans" were given that name because they wanted to not only end slavery but also to endow the freed slaves with full citizenship, equality, and rights.&#10;&#10;Fact: The Ku Klux Klan was originally and primarily an arm of the Southern Democratic Party. Its mission was to terrorize freed slaves and "ni**er-loving" (their words) Republicans who sympathized with them.

4 | Salman Khan | 120 | 10154773719976336_10154773721746336 | "Hillary Clinton" and "Donald Trump" go into a bakery.--> Hillary Clinton steals three pastries and puts them in her pocket.She says to Donald Trump "See how clever I am? The owner didn't see anything and I don't even need to lie.‚Äù I will definitely win the election.Donald Trump --> "That's the typical dishonesty you have displayed throughout your entire life, trickery and deceit. I am going to show you an honest way to get the same result."Donald Trump --> goes to the owner of the bakery and says, "Give me a pastry and I will show you a magic trick." Intrigued, the owner accepts and gives him a pastry. Trump swallows it and asks for another one. The owner gives him another one. Then Donald asks for a third pastry and eats that, too.The owner is starting to wonder where the magic trick is and asks, "What did you do with the pastries?" Donald Trump replies, "Look in Hillary's pocket".
5 | David Tripp | 63 | 10154773719976336_10154773733806336 | Love how Fox news backs a corrupt woman. Your chart is so far from the truth and Americans know it. Hillary does not have a strong run for Presidency.  But you as the media are helping cover up the voter fraud. Our media is corrupt, our FBI is corrupt and our Federal government is corrupt.Start reporting real news. Stop twisting the truths and start displaying facts instead of fiction. Fox news sucks.

8 | Kat Meyers | 17 | 10154773719976336_10154773782471336 | It's right now 6:01 am. I am so upset I'm at the point of tears.I was appointed as the Republican judge at a local election site. The Holy Spirit distinctly pointed out about the voting machines being set up while I was getting ready to leave my house. I got there on time and sure enough, the sheriff (appointed election officer) and the democratic judge had already opened the voting machines and set them up and their excuse was, well we got here early and it's the way we've always done it.REALLY!?!?The law and procedure state they must be opened together by the Republican judge and the Democratic judge! I called the county election office and she tried to convince me that it was fine, yada yada yada. So I go back in and the dem judge is telling me they did this and this and this (all the procedures for opening up the machines and getting the ballots out and privacy screens set up) and he said "I'm an honest person" to which I replied,  that's what Hillary Clinton says too. Then he had the nerve to ask me to sign off on the verification form of opening the machines.Are you kidding me??By then I was off the chain! I said, there's no way in all good conscience that I will sign that form. I called the election office again and spoke to the county clerk. I told her what happened and that I'm leaving. I will not participate in forging a verification. Again she tried to assure me that the ballot print out would show 0 votes and it would be fine. I told her I'm leaving and you can get someone here to replace me and I'm reporting it. Stupid people. Everything done decently and in order. I think not!!!Praying for the next right steps in documenting and reporting this!!HENDERSON KY
9 | Debbie Puzio Trapanese | 55 | 10154773719976336_10154773735431336 | If you are still on the fence about voting, look at your paycheck and Obamacare. Look at our taxes, the swarms of illegal immigrants coming into this country, the drug epidemic, the violence in the inner cities and we have a lot here in NJ like Newark and Paterson. Look at the lack of respect of human life, this country has turned away from God. I know many of us are not happy with the direction this country is going towards but we will be unhappier if we elect that crook into office. I love my country and that's why I will vote TRUMP 2016!Love how Bon Jovi sang Living on a Prayer during her rally last night. That's what we will be doing if she gets elected. üòÇ
10 | Mike Ervin | 38 | 10154773719976336_10154773724686336 | Everybody get out and vote. Sit back and watch the liberal complain the polls closed to early and the disadvantaged did not have a change to vote ALL DAY LONG But they sure as hell can get their free welfare before that office closes.
11 | Vishnu Shal | 49 | 10154773719976336_10154773725746336 | am a indian and i support trump.he's a real leader,who can change sterotyped politics.In india there are campaigns running in support of trumph.trumph and modi combo can take china down easily.why 49% americans are still voting for hillary is hilarious.she will take us down for sure.please do something my american friends
12 | Kathy Whitehouse | 14 | 10154773719976336_10154773757316336 | Putting on my voting shoes to go "drain the swamp!" Feel compelled to clarify Huckabee's comment about the elite. The "working class" supporting Trump includes college degrees and white collar jobs. Not just taxi drivers. Trump's support comes in part because of a ground swell of individuals, the majority, who are not living in NYC and Silicon Valley. We are people all over the country. Downsized into self-employment. Disenfranchised because we are main stream. We are not transgender or gay or undocumented. Nothing wrong with these people. But the rest of us, the majority of us who are not a special interest group, are exhausted. I am voting for Trump today because we need someone to lead who has common sense about money and business. I prefer Greece as a vacation destination.
13 | Giulio Braga | 39 | 10154773719976336_10154773720521336 | Well‚Ä¶ The judgment day has come: November 8, The Evil family vs Donald Trump for the White house!!! GET OUT AND VOTE, AND MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Hillary & Bill, Bush family, bankers, Wall Street owners, Jay z, Beyonc√©, Katy Perry(roar), and so on, against the People. And Trump represents the people. 70 percent of the American people believe that America is in actual decline. For more than two years the American people, have been in revolt against the political class and the financial elites in America. It is a historical revolt, it is a peaceful uprising of a people who see a country in decline and see nothing but failure in the performance of their leadership institutions. The judgment day has come: November 8, The Evil family vs Donald Trump for the White house!!! Hillary & Bill, Bush family, bankers, Wall Street owners, Jay z, Beyonce, Katy Perry(roar), and so on. Trump represents the people.GET OUT AND VOTE, AND MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!and Make The Whole World SAFE AGAIN!Thank you - #TrumpPence #MAGA
14 | Charley Clark | 7 | 10154773719976336_10154773770541336 | If you think Hillary has your best interest in mind, your have been fooled. She doesn't care about you, your family, or America's best interest. Is Trump the answer? He is the lesser of 2 evils. Hillary has a mound of corruption piled a mile high and doesn't even try to hide it. And you still blindly support her. They have tried for a year to drum up trash on "Donald Trump For President" and all they can come up with is he said something that hurt my feelings. The Democratic party wants to kill the working middle class. They want 2 social classes. The rich and those whom serve the rich. The media boasts of all the jobs the Democratic party has created. I'm sure they have. I'm sure a Mickey D's burger stand can be found on every street corner in America. Flippin burgers will never get you an annual salary greater than $15k a year. I'm sorry, it takes no skill to cook a greasy flat piece of meat. What about industrial job creation in America? Manufacturing is what brings money into an economy. It creates countless jobs across many area's of expertise. Both during construction and for years down the road. Who ushered in NAFTA? Just like Ross Perot said, NAFTA signed, a vacuum sound erupted and all the jobs left the country. Canada floods the lumber market. The papermills left. Thousands upon thousands of jobs left. Over seas auto manufacturer's came in. That's great you say. Guess what!! The money they earn from the manufacturing goes back to their country. They don't buy supplies from America. They ship it from their own country. Why can America do the same? Trump is the only screaming to take care of our own. All the other countries do it. Except the ones who kill their own. I'm not against immigrants. But you should do your part to help keep America healthy. Not paying taxes, freeloading on the taxpayers dime, and leaching off the government is destroying the country. America has a primary language, it's English!!! It always has been!!! Freedom of religion. I don't push mine on you, don't push yours on me. Obamacare? Oh it's great!!! Just last 3 months ago, my aunt got pneumonia. The hospital discharged her and sent her home. She was covered by Obamacare. The government doesn't care if you live or die. They just want their money and power. And Hillary supports have bought into the lie!! You say we don't want a woman as president. A woman as President is a good idea. But it needs to be a woman with integrity. Someone with a genuine concern with the American peoples well being. Hillary just wants the power and prestige. She's full of greed. That's it and that's all. It's amazing to me how simple the decision is and how uneducated people have become. We have all the information at our finger tips and as a society, we are dumber than we were 100 years ago.
15 | Jim Freyler | 3 | 10154773719976336_10154773793746336 | In many ways this is a moot point.  While the Democrats normally don't get any defectors on the big votes, the GOP can never rely on people like Collins (ME) and Graham (SC) and a select few others.
16 | Susan Martin | 10 | 10154773719976336_10154773763901336 | Voting in Northern VA this morning, normally being white is a minority but not this morning and not many people are holding blue sample ballots. Hope this is a positive indicator. MAGA TRUMP PENCE 2016
17 | Emilio Testa | 5 | 10154773719976336_10154773771781336 | The Red Cross pulled their people out of Benghazi before the attacks happened it's really insane that the leaders of the Red Cross has more sense than our Secretary of State What difference does it make at this point? It'll be our lives on the line next Please don't make a big Mistake here VOTE Donald J. Trump

20 | Joe Skinner | 7 | 10154773719976336_10154773745531336 | A young lady at a game was asked, how she could vote for Trump, a ‚Äúmisogynist, a racist and a bigot‚Äù.Here is her answer:Because I use my head to research and find out what candidates really are, not what the media wants me to think.Because Donald Trump has more women in executive and managerial positions than any comparable company, which tells me he is not a misogynist.Because he pays these women the same or more than their male counterparts, which tells me looks for capacity and skills in people, not color, gender or race.Because he fought the West Palm Beach City Council to be able to open his newly purchased club, so he could include blacks and Jews as members, who had been banned until then. This tells me he is not a racist.Because he has raised wonderful children who have turned out to be outstanding, hard-working and compassionate adults. He must be doing something right.Because his economic plans makes sense, are conservative in nature, and I vote based of what is best for my family, my friends and my country.Because everybody, the left and the right are afraid of him, the media is trying to destroy his image, and even foreign governments are voicing their opinions, so he must be doing something right. Clean house maybe?Because I want a Supreme Court that will uphold the Constitution, not behave as minions of the administration. I have had enough with judges who are more like political activists than law enforcers.Because I fear for my family‚Äôs safety if the current trend of not confronting blatant terrorism continues ‚Äì which is a threat to our way of life.Because I am fed up with the rampant corruption of this administration. Accountability in government is paramount, and as this administration has demonstrated, it is a foreign concept to them.Because I am fed up with the political correctness gone wild, and because Trump is not afraid to say what everybody thinks but does not dare to say. A thug is a thug, regardless of color, and that's it.Because it is about time someone puts America's interests ahead of other countries.Because I know he recognizes and embraces America's exceptionalism, and will not tour the World apologizing for who we are. That tells me he is a patriot.Because, unlike HRC, he has actually held a job, worked hard and achieved success.And last, but not least, because I am more offended by what Hillary does than by what Trump says.

2 | Robert Radz | 897 | 10154772890326336_10154773520186336 | So, if you are ok with a stagnant economy, scandals, corruption, high taxes, job killing regulations, massive under employment, huge national debt, inner city crime, riots, cop killings, illegal immigrants, Syrian refugees, endless wars, terror attacks, late term abortions, massive black unemployment, Obamacare and Common Core...then you should vote for Hillary Clinton.
3 | Abiael Garcia | 438 | 10154772890326336_10154773527396336 | ‚ö†If you are Gay, Why are you voting for Hillary when she wants to bring in thousands of refugees that believe all Gays should be executed?üëÅ‚ö†If you are Black, Why are you voting for Hillary when she admires Margaret Sanger and defends Planned Parenthood who want to abort as many black babies as possible? Exterminate the black race because they are like "weeds". (Margaret Sanger quote) Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.üëÅ‚ö†If you are a Christian, Why are you voting for Hillary Clinton when she wrote her Senior thesis on Saul Alinsky who dedicated his book 'Rules for Radicals' to Lucifer (the Devil)? She says he was, and still is her mentor.üëÅ‚ö†If you are a Veteran, in the Military, or closely related to a Military member, Why are you voting for Hillary when she left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again? They called for help but the help was told to stand down.üëÅ‚ö†If you have a factory job, Why are you voting for Hillary when she supported TPP? Factory workers are being laid off because jobs are going over seas. Don't forget the deals she's made with china. She also welcomes open borders and illegals to get benefits to be paid with Your tax money.üëÅ‚ö†If you are poor, Why are you voting for Hillary, when she is supporting Wall street and all the big banks? Big banks keep poor people poor by destroying the poor man's credit by allowing medical bills and collections to affect your credit scores so you can pay higher interest rates than the rich; Taking much of the little money you earn.üëÅ‚ö†If you are a Woman, how can you vote for Hillary when she has buried all of Bills rape victims under the rug, including that little girl that was raped? Lawyer Hillary defended the rapist, and then she laughed about it later, knowing that he was guilty.If you carry a gun, or believe in the Constitution; How can you vote for Hillary when she wants to eliminate the NRA, Take your guns, and abolish the second Amendment?üëÅ‚ö†If you breathe, Why would you vote for Hillary when she and the Clinton crime family have left a trail of dead people that did not agree with her, or they knew too much?Who is left? üëÅ

8 | Mark D. Ellis | 57 | 10154772890326336_10154773615926336 | Today could be the most important day in the history of this country. If Trump wins the election America may well be on the way to recovery. Not just economic recovery but moral recovery! If Trump wins we would get not only conservative Supreme Court Justices but could also get Christian Conservative Justices! If Clinton wins our Religious liberties are GONE! Our already lax borders will become non existent. The influx of illegal immigrants will be uncontrollable. We will be forced to pay for Partial Birth Abortion on Demand with our tax dollars. Unemployment which is now at the highest point probably since the 70's will continue to grow. We will be completely disrespected by our adversaries as our military will continue to be decimated. If Clinton wins America as it has been known for hundreds of years will be no more. Christians around the world will continue to be slaughtered for our beliefs but that slaughter will move here to American soil. That's right folks! Think long and hard before you cast your ballot today.

19 | Sam Suzanne Roberts | 10 | 10154772890326336_10154773582296336 | We must not surrender! Defeat Hillary!!!    "Give up your dreams of freedom because to save our own skins, we're willing to make a deal with your slave masters." Alexander Hamilton said, "A nation which can prefer disgrace to danger is prepared for a master, and deserves one." Now let's set the record straight. There's no argument over the choice between peace and war, but there's only one guaranteed way you can have peace‚Äîand you can have it in the next second‚Äîsurrender. Admittedly, there's a risk in any course we follow other than this, but every lesson of history tells us that the greater risk lies in appeasement, and this is the specter our well-meaning liberal friends refuse to face‚Äîthat their policy of accommodation is appeasement, and it gives no choice between peace and war, only between fight or surrender. If we continue to accommodate, continue to back and retreat, eventually we have to face the final demand‚Äîthe ultimatum. And what then‚Äîwhen Nikita Khrushchev has told his people he knows what our answer will be? He has told them that we're retreating under the pressure of the Cold War, and someday when the time comes to deliver the final ultimatum, our surrender will be voluntary, because by that time we will have been weakened from within spiritually, morally, and economically. He believes this because from our side he's heard voices pleading for "peace at any price" or "better Red than dead," or as one commentator put it, he'd rather "live on his knees than die on his feet." And therein lies the road to war, because those voices don't speak for the rest of us. You and I know and do not believe that life is so dear and peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery. If nothing in life is worth dying for, when did this begin‚Äîjust in the face of this enemy? Or should Moses have told the children of Israel to live in slavery under the pharaohs? Should Christ have refused the cross? Should the patriots at Concord Bridge have thrown down their guns and refused to fire the shot heard 'round the world? The martyrs of history were not fools, and our honored dead who gave their lives to stop the advance of the Nazis didn't die in vain. Where, then, is the road to peace? Well it's a simple answer after all. You and I have the courage to say to our enemies, "There is a price we will not pay." "There is a point beyond which they must not advance." ~ Ronald Reagan
20 | Kat Meyers | 9 | 10154772890326336_1068020713319501 | From Henderson KY:It's right now 6:01 am. I am so upset I'm at the point of tears.I was appointed as the Republican judge at a local election site. The Holy Spirit distinctly pointed out about the voting machines being set up while I was getting ready to leave my house. I got there on time and sure enough, the sheriff (appointed election officer) and the democratic judge had already opened the voting machines and set them up and their excuse was, well we got here early and it's the way we've always done it.REALLY!?!?The law and procedure state they must be opened together by the Republican judge and the Democratic judge! I called the county election office and she tried to convince me that it was fine, yada yada yada. So I go back in and the dem judge is telling me they did this and this and this (all the procedures for opening up the machines and getting the ballots out and privacy screens set up) and he said "I'm an honest person" to which I replied,  that's what Hillary Clinton says too. Then he had the nerve to ask me to sign off on the verification form of opening the machines.Are you kidding me??By then I was off the chain! I said, there's no way in all good conscience that I will sign that form. I called the election office again and spoke to the county clerk. I told her what happened and that I'm leaving. I will not participate in forging a verification. Again she tried to assure me that the ballot print out would show 0 votes and it would be fine. I told her I'm leaving and you can get someone here to replace me and I'm reporting it. Stupid people!!Everything done decently and in order. I think not!!!Praying for the next right steps in documenting and reporting this!!

1 | Katie Hamby | 988 | 10154771842741336_10154773395581336 | Please go out and vote for trump today! Please keep in mind that she's a liar, she lied about being under sniper fire, she lied about all kinds of things and we can't have a liar for president! She's dangerous, she's corrupt, and she's not what America deserves. Vote trump because we need to put Americans first for once. Remember the victims of Benghazi, remember her stance on partial birth abortions, remember her saying "what difference does it make"
2 | Mackenzie Brandau | 595 | 10154771842741336_10154773400686336 | It's a big day for Mr. Trump!!! WE NEED YOU!

3 | Richard Ogle | 249 | 10154771842741336_10154773419981336 | It's not about you liking Trump, but she is pure evil,,,It is about this country. If people are unsure on who to vote for, ask yourself one question.Who is putting the American people's life at risk by letting refugees into this country? It's all good until one of your loved ones are raped or worse,, then you will ask yourself, Well i guess i voted for that...You will have blood on your hands...plus, There are 296 cases of TB in refugees and immigrants in Minnesota. Plus TB in other states as well. Hillary wants to bring 500,000 into the USA.
4 | Janine Pieper | 179 | 10154771842741336_10154773448206336 | I still dont get it, how someone can vote for Hillary.If she was just "extremly careless" with her Emails, why did she try to hide everything with lies?If someone feels remorse, he/she says "i am sorry, it was a mistake and i didnt know"  but she lied even to the FBI
5 | Judy Flynn | 101 | 10154771842741336_10154773556961336 | Just in case anyone wonders why Hillary would destroy the work-related emails with acid or bleach bit knowing that doing so is treason against the USA, Benghazi is the number one reason.
6 | Jan McGlothlen Hazen | 48 | 10154771842741336_10154773513231336 | Reckless, shameful and disgraceful those people deserved so much better...their service was a form of serving our country. How would I or how would any of us feel if our family members had been so abandoned and left defenseless?
7 | Elina Diaz | 50 | 10154771842741336_10154773573801336 | Hillary is totally incompetent and viciously evil to run our country. She can not be trusted to protect us. She is inherently wicked.TRUMP 2016üá∫üá∏
8 | Elo Frank | 40 | 10154771842741336_10154773589541336 | I'm voting for TRUMP because we need change. We don't need Hillary. She's been around for 30 years! We need someone new with ideas and has stamina and strength. Not somebody who is constantly resting at her house, and having everybody else campaign for her. We need TRUMP because we don't need a tax increase, or an increase of illegal immigrants. We need lower taxes and have borders! What is a country without borders? The world is already eating our country economically dry. We need a businessman who will make trades with other countries and bring our economy back. I voted for Trump. We need to make America Great Again! Vote for TRUMP!
9 | Will Holcomb | 46 | 10154771842741336_10154773425251336 | Hillary sent Stevens there with gold to buy back shoulder fired missiles they sold to the wrong people. Then her email about it was hacked, and the locals killed Stevens for the $3 million in gold. He never had a chance.
10 | John Goodwin | 21 | 10154771842741336_10154773480011336 | Still not Clinton's fault. A leader is not responsible for terrorists attacks otherwise you will have to blame Bush fir 9/11. Clinton did not hire them. People in Benghazi would have done the hiring. A secretary of state does not have anything to do with day to day hiring and firing at an embassy. The head of security or leader at embassy such as an ambassador does that. So basically what you are saying is bad judgment on their part caused their own deaths. Nice try. You failed to proved anything and she will be elected in 18 hours.
11 | Kelvin LP Lee | 43 | 10154771842741336_10154773398996336 | Facts have No Lies and the Truth has No AgendaCrooked Hillary is the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency of the United States.Crooked Hillary told us that the State department missing $6 billion of the tax payers $$$$, illegally destroyed public records and 30,000 emails, and responsible for US an ambassador being murdered.Crooked Hillary has spent the last 30 years selling out the American people for $$$$millions to foreign governments and special interests.Crooked Clinton Foundation accepted $$$million from the Qatari government and many others government without notifying the State Department. Chelsea Clinton used Crooked Clinton Foundation $$$$ resources for her wedding and life for a decade. The Clinton's stole items from the White house during Bill Clinton time.Crooked Hillary had the nerve to lie about it over and over again.Their Washington corruption days are number when Mr. Donald J. Trump becomes the 45th President of the United States!! We need to get involved and tell all our friends and families to vote for Mr. Trump.Vote #Trump2016	It's time to "Drain the Swamp"
12 | Sam Suzanne Roberts | 6 | 10154771842741336_10154773577261336 | We must not surrender! Defeat Hillary!!!    "Give up your dreams of freedom because to save our own skins, we're willing to make a deal with your slave masters." Alexander Hamilton said, "A nation which can prefer disgrace to danger is prepared for a master, and deserves one." Now let's set the record straight. There's no argument over the choice between peace and war, but there's only one guaranteed way you can have peace‚Äîand you can have it in the next second‚Äîsurrender. Admittedly, there's a risk in any course we follow other than this, but every lesson of history tells us that the greater risk lies in appeasement, and this is the specter our well-meaning liberal friends refuse to face‚Äîthat their policy of accommodation is appeasement, and it gives no choice between peace and war, only between fight or surrender. If we continue to accommodate, continue to back and retreat, eventually we have to face the final demand‚Äîthe ultimatum. And what then‚Äîwhen Nikita Khrushchev has told his people he knows what our answer will be? He has told them that we're retreating under the pressure of the Cold War, and someday when the time comes to deliver the final ultimatum, our surrender will be voluntary, because by that time we will have been weakened from within spiritually, morally, and economically. He believes this because from our side he's heard voices pleading for "peace at any price" or "better Red than dead," or as one commentator put it, he'd rather "live on his knees than die on his feet." And therein lies the road to war, because those voices don't speak for the rest of us. You and I know and do not believe that life is so dear and peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery. If nothing in life is worth dying for, when did this begin‚Äîjust in the face of this enemy? Or should Moses have told the children of Israel to live in slavery under the pharaohs? Should Christ have refused the cross? Should the patriots at Concord Bridge have thrown down their guns and refused to fire the shot heard 'round the world? The martyrs of history were not fools, and our honored dead who gave their lives to stop the advance of the Nazis didn't die in vain. Where, then, is the road to peace?

13 | Michael Miley | 8 | 10154771842741336_10154773635696336 | If our government can't effectively vet a few people for a CONTRACT POSITION with the STATE DEPARTMENT, how in the world can they say they can vet hundreds of thousands of refugees? Makes ya wonder if the contractor made a sizable donation to the Clinton Foundation to bypass the vetting....
14 | David Chess | 7 | 10154771842741336_10154773598321336 | is there really half of this country that is voting for Killary? The level of incompetence here is mind boggling!! She's too busy hauling in cash to worry about the safety and security of our nation. SHAME SHAME SHAME SHAME GO TO HELL HILLARY!!!
15 | Liz O'Mara | 12 | 10154771842741336_10154773481706336 | And our Secretary of State did not know???...or maybe she personally hired them to be the hit men bc Ambassador Stevens knew too much!! Classic Clinton style
16 | Joyce Menzel | 10 | 10154771842741336_10154773551806336 | She just as well have killed them herself. She's a lying murdering witch. I just can't wrap my mind around how anyone can vote for her after seeing everything against her. There is so much evidence that associates her and Bill with things that can't be a coincidence. But they could kill or do something right in front of them and they would believe it. Bit I'm going to think of it this way. She night get away with right now.  But one day she will stand before God and she will be judged by what she has done.
17 | Debbie Kostoglakis | 17 | 10154771842741336_10154773395586336 | pulling out the "rigged" card again huh, your boy has lost support of blacks latinos females Indians and the Chinese, what makes u sheeple think he's winning?
18 | Donna M. Freeman | 9 | 10154771842741336_10154773622196336 | ‚ö†If you are Gay, Why are you voting for Hillary when she wants to bring in thousands of refugees that believe all Gays should be executed?üëÅ‚ö†If you are Black, Why are you voting for Hillary when she admires Margaret Sanger and defends Planned Parenthood who want to abort as many black babies as possible? Exterminate the black race because they are like "weeds". (Margaret Sanger quote) Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.üëÅ‚ö†If you are a Christian, Why are you voting for Hillary Clinton when she wrote her Senior thesis on Saul Alinsky who dedicated his book 'Rules for Radicals' to Lucifer (the Devil)? She says he was, and still is her mentor.üëÅ‚ö†If you are a Veteran, in the Military, or closely related to a Military member, Why are you voting for Hillary when she left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again? They called for help but the help was told to stand down.üëÅ‚ö†If you have a factory job, Why are you voting for Hillary when she supported TPP? Factory workers are being laid off because jobs are going over seas. Don't forget the deals she's made with china. She also welcomes open borders and illegals to get benefits to be paid with Your tax money.üëÅ‚ö†If you are poor, Why are you voting for Hillary, when she is supporting Wall street and all the big banks? Big banks keep poor people poor by destroying the poor man's credit by allowing medical bills and collections to affect your credit scores so you can pay higher interest rates than the rich; Taking much of the little money you earn.üëÅ‚ö†If you are a Woman, how can you vote for Hillary when she has buried all of Bills rape victims under the rug, including that little girl that was raped? Lawyer Hillary defended the rapist, and then she laughed about it later, knowing that he was guilty.If you carry a gun, or believe in the Constitution; How can you vote for Hillary when she wants to eliminate the NRA, Take your guns, and abolish the second Amendment?üëÅ‚ö†If you breathe, Why would you vote for Hillary when she and the Clinton crime family have left a trail of dead people that did not agree with her, or they knew too much?Who is left? üëÅ
19 | Carla Mcclure Lehman | 5 | 10154771842741336_10154773813031336 | If we don't have any other reason (which there are many) not to vote for Hillary, this should be the main reason. She left our Ambassador and our men defenseless. Local Libyans who were tied to terrorism were guarding our compound. They helped assist in the attack which resulted in the death of 4 American  lives. Then to be lied to as a Nation and blame in on a Video. I could never put my trust in her and feel confident that she would do the right thing to protect our Nation. #Trump2016
20 | Bennie Letterman | 3 | 10154771842741336_10154773732496336 | I have to think, what if the hiring of this company that had NO employees when it got the contract to protect our diplomats, were given the contract by a Hillary pay for play. No vetting of the company? If that were the case Hillary herself would be responsible for the deaths of Stevens and the others. Sickening thought
21 | C.j. Griffin | 2 | 10154771842741336_10154773799326336 | So, what happened was that Clinton's Wife hired terrorists to guard the post in Benghazi.  Ultimately her responsibility even if they weren't paid through The Clinton Money Laundering Foundation. Apparently it's true that Stevens knew too much.  Murder seems more likely, since it's a Clinton, than a clusterfiasco like that happening through negligence or "lack of institutional control."  A vote for Clinton is a vote to make the country the most ridiculed laughingstock since the first political boundary on Earth was drawn.
22 | P.j. Davis | 1 | 10154771842741336_1170343979668148 | The web of deceit and denial the Clintons built is large and has reached many corners of our country and beyond. Please preserve our country and our Constitution. Vote Republican only. TRUMP 2016!!!

7 | Ellie Lantz | 67 | 10154771902226336_10154773466101336 | Since there is a news blackout concerning what is happening to Europe due to the Islamic invasion let me tell you! Every place that there is a "refugee" center there are constant thefts, rape and fires set in the refugee buildings. Most of the "refugees" refuse to use bathroom facilities and prefer burning furniture to sitting or sleeping on it. There is human trafficking of every sort. Refugee workers are regularly assaulted. By the way, just as less than 1% of "refugees brought to the U.S. are Christian less than that live in those refugee centers in the EU. Muslims are killing Muslims in those places. Christians and other minorities cannot survive in a "refugee" center.This whole thing is a hoax. Less than 15% of the Muslims invading the EU are from Syria or Iraq. They are from  some of the most backward, fundamentalist, sharia ruled areas of the middle east and Africa. Europeans are being told that they don't deserve to live there anymore because they are white. There is a war on not only freedom but WHITE! Wake up before it is too late. The same leftist /globalists doing this to Europe are working the same agenda here in the USA!

I have to give them credit for that. It's just too bad all those celebrities won't fix the inner cities. Once they vote for Hillary, its "see you in four years!" Basically back to the same old! I wish they'd vote for Trump. A man who genuinely cares and is actually aware of the problems they face!!!! Trump offers no free concerts. He offers solutions.
2 | John Henry | 166 | 10154772545231336_10154773252351336 | President Obama promised to unite the country, but instead left it more divided than at any other time except probably during the civil war. Obamacare sucks monkey nuts and we scream and yell about how bad it is. Each day seems to bring yet another Clinton scandal or revelation of another dirty trick played by Hillary. But you know what? You can scream and yell and point out how terrible these leaders are, but they don't give a flip. The only thing they care about is retaining power so that they can continue to line their pockets with their corrupt ways. It's time to make them care. It's time to drain the swamp! Please vote #TrumpPence16 and help make history!

2 | Phillip C Parrish | 453 | 10154772684606336_10154773192191336 | American Citizens will indict, prosecute, and convict Hillary Clinton 8 November 2016. Hillary Clinton's conduct and policies lead to countless deaths and the destabilization of North Africa, Europe, and Syria. Hundreds of thousands of women and children are suffering every day and will suffer for the rest of their lives because of her choices. Her corrupt and subversive behaviors caused extremely grave damage to national security. Hillary Clinton's direct connection to sharia compliant Islamic Salafist and Wahhabis jihadists has been repeatedly evidenced through public reporting."What kind of example do we want for our daughters," Clinton asks. Not you Hillary. She personifies everything we don't want our children to be. The only thing sicker than violent, abusive, and dishonest people are those like Hillary who enable and make excuses for them.Hillary Clinton and the salafist-owned militant mainstream media conspire to advance a one world order and Islamic Salafist/Wahhabis jihadi agenda that is the antithesis of the American Constitution, freedom, justice, and democracy.If you, the America citizen, vote for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election, you will be spitting in the face of your children and grandchildren. You will be treading disrespectfully on the graves of your loved ones. We must send a direct message to Washington, D.C. that we will not tolerate a two-track justice system. We will no longer tolerate a system where the wealthy and political elite are above the law while the general public is prosecuted and persecuted for frivolous infractions, impacting the rest of their lives.Americans rise up, vote, and drag your friends and family to the voting booth. Don't sit this one out. Rise above being cynical and vote. You, your children's, and your grandchildren's lives are at stake. It really is that desperate.

We need someone new with ideas and has stamina and strength. Not somebody who is constantly resting at her house, and having everybody else campaign for her. We need TRUMP because we don't need a tax increase, or an increase of illegal immigrants. We need lower taxes and have borders! What is a country without borders? The world is already eating our country economically dry. We need a businessman who will make trades with other countries and bring our economy back. I voted for Trump.

10 | Kat Meyers | 8 | 10154772684606336_1889144347974199 | From Henderson Ky:It's right now 6:01 am. I am so upset I'm at the point of tears.I was appointed as the Republican judge at a local election site. The Holy Spirit distinctly pointed out about the voting machines being set up while I was getting ready to leave my house. I got there on time and sure enough, the sheriff (appointed election officer) and the democratic judge had already opened the voting machines and set them up and their excuse was, well we got here early and it's the way we've always done it.REALLY!?!?The law and procedure state they must be opened together by the Republican judge and the Democratic judge! I called the county election office and she tried to convince me that it was fine, yada yada yada. So I go back in and the dem judge is telling me they did this and this and this (all the procedures for opening up the machines and getting the ballots out and privacy screens set up) and he said "I'm an honest person" to which I replied,  that's what Hillary Clinton says too. Then he had the nerve to ask me to sign off on the verification form of opening the machines.Are you kidding me??By then I was off the chain! I said, there's no way in all good conscience that I will sign that form. I called the election office again and spoke to the county clerk. I told her what happened and that I'm leaving. I will not participate in forging a verification. Again she tried to assure me that the ballot print out would show 0 votes and it would be fine. I told her I'm leaving and you can get someone here to replace me and I'm reporting it. Stupid people!!Everything done decently and in order. I think not!!!Praying for the next right steps in documenting and reporting this!!

12 | Sam Suzanne Roberts | 4 | 10154772684606336_1154412481301088 | We must not surrender! Defeat Hillary!!!"Give up your dreams of freedom because to save our own skins, we're willing to make a deal with your slave masters." Alexander Hamilton said, "A nation which can prefer disgrace to danger is prepared for a master, and deserves one." Now let's set the record straight. There's no argument over the choice between peace and war, but there's only one guaranteed way you can have peace‚Äîand you can have it in the next second‚Äîsurrender. Admittedly, there's a risk in any course we follow other than this, but every lesson of history tells us that the greater risk lies in appeasement, and this is the specter our well-meaning liberal friends refuse to face‚Äîthat their policy of accommodation is appeasement, and it gives no choice between peace and war, only between fight or surrender. If we continue to accommodate, continue to back and retreat, eventually we have to face the final demand‚Äîthe ultimatum. And what then‚Äîwhen Nikita Khrushchev has told his people he knows what our answer will be? He has told them that we're retreating under the pressure of the Cold War, and someday when the time comes to deliver the final ultimatum, our surrender will be voluntary, because by that time we will have been weakened from within spiritually, morally, and economically. He believes this because from our side he's heard voices pleading for "peace at any price" or "better Red than dead," or as one commentator put it, he'd rather "live on his knees than die on his feet." And therein lies the road to war, because those voices don't speak for the rest of us. You and I know and do not believe that life is so dear and peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery. If nothing in life is worth dying for, when did this begin‚Äîjust in the face of this enemy? Or should Moses have told the children of Israel to live in slavery under the pharaohs? Should Christ have refused the cross? Should the patriots at Concord Bridge have thrown down their guns and refused to fire the shot heard 'round the world? The martyrs of history were not fools, and our honored dead who gave their lives to stop the advance of the Nazis didn't die in vain. Where, then, is the road to peace? Well it's a simple answer after all. You and I have the courage to say to our enemies, "There is a price we will not pay." "There is a point beyond which they must not advance." ~ Ronald Reagan

Hillary oversaw the state department while 4 people died in an embassy attack (while she was given inconclusive information)=Put her in jail!2 Republicans were in office while over 200 people died in embassy attacks(while they publicly released inconclusive information)=No problem. Immigrants don't pay taxes=Round them up and kick them out!Trump doesn't pay taxes=He's a business genius & everyone avoids paying taxes. Hillary's foundation only spent 87% of their donations helping people=She's a crook!Trumps foundation paid off his debts, bought sculptures of him, illegally solicited donation NY, received a cease and desist order AND made political donations to avoid investigations while using less than 5% of funds for charity=So savvy... Put him in the White House. Trump made 4 billion dollars in 40 years, when an index fund started at the same time with the same "small loans" he received would be worth $12 billion today... without a trail of bankruptcies, thousands of lawsuits and burned small business owners=He's a real business whiz. Hillary took a loss of $700k=She's a criminal! Trump is the first candidate in the modern era not to release his tax returns, AND took a billion dollar loss in 1 year=Genius. Hillary takes responsibility for private email servers and publicly apologizes=Not credible!Trump denies saying things (on the record, video & audio) he actually said (on the record)=he's just telling it like it is  OR what he meant was....Your arguments are thin. Your ignorance of reality is shocking. Your double-standards are offensive, and your willingness to blindly support him and recycle the rhetoric is absurd. Your opinion is not fact. Your memes are not credible news articles. And your hypocrisy is not a platform!! #EducateAmerica

(Margaret Sanger quote) Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.üëÅ‚ö†If you are a Christian, Why are you voting for Hillary Clinton when she wrote her Senior thesis on Saul Alinsky who dedicated his book 'Rules for Radicals' to Lucifer (the Devil)? She says he was, and still is her mentor.üëÅ‚ö†If you are a Veteran, in the Military, or closely related to a Military member, Why are you voting for Hillary when she left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again? They called for help but the help was told to stand down.üëÅ‚ö†If you have a factory job, Why are you voting for Hillary when she supported TPP? Factory workers are being laid off because jobs are going over seas. Don't forget the deals she's made with china. She also welcomes open borders and illegals to get benefits to be paid with Your tax money.üëÅ‚ö†If you are poor, Why are you voting for Hillary, when she is supporting Wall street and all the big banks? Big banks keep poor people poor by destroying the poor man's credit by allowing medical bills and collections to affect your credit scores so you can pay higher interest rates than the rich; Taking much of the little money you earn.üëÅ‚ö†If you are a Woman, how can you vote for Hillary when she has buried all of Bills rape victims under the rug, including that little girl that was raped?

5 | Zach Kerman | 900 | 10154772118106336_10154773112426336 | Michelle Obama said if Donald Trump is elected: "We're telling our sons it's okay to humiliate women. We're telling our daughters this is how they deserve to be treated.".... that's funny. So does that mean that if Hillary Clinton is elected, we are teaching our sons & daughters that it's ok to murder, lie, cover up, be corrupt, demean women, use racial slurs, and stay with a spouse that openly rapes women & cheats on you?
6 | Keith Mikell | 504 | 10154772118106336_10154773114431336 | He's crushing everywhere and he doesnt even need celebs to show up at rallies or to pay people to walk in off the street. HIllary was at pitt today and her turnout was poor.

Nope, I refuse to allow a person to represent me that blantly disregards US Laws. Tell me how she will look at other world leaders and hope to influence them, when her own country doesn't trust her.

14 | David Jinzo | 136 | 10154772118106336_10154773125546336 | My Latino vote for Trump is useless in the state I live-California. I can't come to terms with the fact that my one informed vote is going to be cancelled out by my fellow Latino brothers and sister who haven't followed politics in their lifetime. A lot of these Latino voters in California are not low-information votes, they are NO information voters. The only thing thing getting them to the polls is the fact that they choose to believe the lie that Trump is a racist. Scary. If they are going to have black panthers at the polling stations, maybe we should put immigration officers as well.
15 | Rick Harmes | 198 | 10154772118106336_10154773112836336 | I'm really sad tonight, I found out that my dad is voting for hillary. If he was still alive I think I could talk him out of it]

17 | Jason Matthew Gorton | 99 | 10154772118106336_10154773124801336 | There is a movement happening within our country because of Donald J.

18 | Judy G. Brown | 65 | 10154772118106336_10154773136191336 | Please get out and vote for Mr. Trump. He will make REAL CHANGE with the Washington D.C. corruption and cronyism.

23 | Richard Biazus | 47 | 10154772118106336_10154773152136336 | I went on a Liberal FB page today, after reading a few posts by Hillary supporters I suddenly felt the urge to smash my iPhone and gouge out my eyes with the broken shards of glass. One woman posted on a picture of Hillary wearing a crown that said OUR QUEEN HILLARY, "Yes Benghazi happened, but it was never Hillary's fault like that pig Trump says. It was the republican party that refused to fund a rescue mission, her hands were tied but she is too high class to slander people over it. Instead she swallows her pride and takes the beatings from the GOP." Honestly, this is the type of people we are dealing with. God save us.
24 | Harold McLemore | 30 | 10154772118106336_10154773160551336 | I think everyone should Google Hillary Clinton. Pro tip: put in these key words.... Hillary Clinton and the Lolita express, Hillary Clinton wikileaks, Clinton Foundation corruption,  Hillary Clinton's mysterious deaths... Things like that. The problem is that too many people don't know about these things. I could go on and on...
25 | Judith Burrill | 23 | 10154772118106336_540516722824377 | If you live in the liberal morass of MA here's a Brietbart flash : both Tom Brady and our Bill B. have endorsed and voted for Donald J Trump. it's not easy being a Republican in this state. Tomorrow everything changes for the better.

This is our last chance to take our country back from the corruption and illegals trying to steal it and change our constitution that our founding founders established! I'm half Mexican, born and raised here in America and I'm voting for Mr. Donald J Trump!!!! America has always been my country, not Mexico. This country has provided everything to me and my family and I'm blessed and forever grateful. Have you ever watched a US Soccer Match Vs Mexico played here in the US? Mexicans attend the game with Zero American Flags!!! Why? Because deep down inside they don't love America, they love Mexico that's we're their heart is, so they bring the Mexican Flag even though they live here. These people don't ever want to be American, because Mexico comes first for them and that‚Äôs a FACT! Our heart should always be for AMERICA! Why should we surrender our country to a group of people who don't love it in the first place? TODAY really is our last chance to save this country and our constitution!!! We will shock the liberal world and the media! Let's all show up and vote with everyone we know and I guarantee you Trump will win!!! #VoteTrump #ToSaveAmerica #AmericaFirst #TrumpWinWill

5 | Dana Tee | 99 | 10154771953551336_10154773057191336 | Sounds to me like they are afraid that Trump is going to win and they are throwing this notion of "hackers meddling with the vote" out there before it ever happens. That way they can use it to claim that Trump didn't really win . This will be an excuse to void the results. Just a theory.

20 | Kat Meyers | 4 | 10154771953551336_1240661692670749 | From Henderson Ky :It's right now 6:01 am. I am so upset I'm at the point of tears.I was appointed as the Republican judge at a local election site. The Holy Spirit distinctly pointed out about the voting machines being set up while I was getting ready to leave my house. I got there on time and sure enough, the sheriff (appointed election officer) and the democratic judge had already opened the voting machines and set them up and their excuse was, well we got here early and it's the way we've always done it.REALLY!?!?The law and procedure state they must be opened together by the Republican judge and the Democratic judge! I called the county election office and she tried to convince me that it was fine, yada yada yada. So I go back in and the dem judge is telling me they did this and this and this (all the procedures for opening up the machines and getting the ballots out and privacy screens set up) and he said "I'm an honest person" to which I replied,  that's what Hillary Clinton says too. Then he had the nerve to ask me to sign off on the verification form of opening the machines.Are you kidding me??By then I was off the chain! I said, there's no way in all good conscience that I will sign that form. I called the election office again and spoke to the county clerk. I told her what happened and that I'm leaving. I will not participate in forging a verification. Again she tried to assure me that the ballot print out would show 0 votes and it would be fine. I told her I'm leaving and you can get someone here to replace me and I'm reporting it. Stupid people. Everything done decently and in order. I think not!!!Praying for the next right steps in documenting and reporting this!!
21 | Crafty Bee | 0 | 10154771953551336_589634337893191 | Nope. Our own government is. They plan False flags if they see Donald Trump Ahead in the polls People!! Open your eyes!! They are corrupt!!! They will blame on Russia and start a WW3!! Do not let it stop you! U must still vote and vote Trump and if that beotch wins, we must stand against our Government, it is rigged. And do not believe for one moment it isn't.
22 | Keenan Blair | 2 | 10154771953551336_10154773115996336 | This is no longer the free country that I fought for. I am ashamed of how people stand silent while they strip us of our fundamental rights and liberties. The government can't even provide, and hasn't provided, basic goods and services in which it were created for yet we demand no accountability.
23 | Sarah Schmidt | 4 | 10154771953551336_10154773094051336 | This is a scare technique so they have an excuse to go in and rig it so Hillary wins. I have been waiting for them to find an excuse to get access. Bus loads of voters prisoners.voting dead people voting aliens voting and now an excuse to scan with a hic cup in place to ensure the win.  I am an Aussie and I am disscusred in president Obama just as many others. to address the nation as the president and to tell voters to vote for Hillary so in other words he wasn't speaking to the nation he was speaking to her half of the country... Hang your head in shame you disgust me. Also scarring black people of America by insinuating the KKK would get them if they don't vote for Hillary how low can you get although in reality you probably have done worse but it is the worlds best kept secret. We drove around America and saw what they were going through for ourselves spoke to them and was shocked of how betrayed they felt from you as we went over there liking you as main media here thinks you are great but not true but as many now have discovered but unfortunately many fools are wearing rose coloured glasses but one day they will know the truth about your corrupt government and taking accolades from them when your country is at the brink with those people being betrayed by you it's time now America for a change as you have nothing to loose as your president has failed you big time. Change will air the dirty closets. And if you don't like change in 4 years change it but get rid of the rubbish sweep the floor of this mess for your sake open your eyes
24 | Sylvia Smith | 4 | 10154771953551336_10154773277476336 | If they are afraid the machines will be hacked, why not just use paper ballots??

25 | Paul Whitlow Jr. | 0 | 10154771953551336_589692014554090 | You are witnessing an end game battle for the next step to the NWO. This election is a potential Brexit on steroids. The trade agreements of the past were created to degrade America, remove industry, break down infrastructure and increase poverty and welfare.  A psychological war has been going on to remove the concept American exceptionalism creating good little NWO robots. Muslim migration, racism, anti police officer...is used to create crisis to lead to crisis response. Obama taught Alinsky, Hillary was his pen pal. One of the Alinsky tactics is to explode the debt. Obama has doubled the debt, Hillary will end the economy. You cannot have a welfare state and open boarders, it is sure destruction.  In this NWO objective globalist establishment Republicans work with globalist establishment Democrats, bankers, media, multinational corporations. The concept of man made global change was created by Club of Rome to give power being agenda 21. There is no man made global change, there is our decreasing magnetic field that is changing the density of the magnetosphere, that is our shield from the sun. It is a natural cycle of our earth. Research earths decreasing magnetic field.By 2030 TPP unites with the European trade agreements and agenda 21 forming  environmental hyper capitalist fascist United Nations controlled world trade and environmental courts that destroy the sovereignty of all participants and control every aspect of your life the largest control mechanisms being Food, Health, environmental regulations, education. The media is directed to achieve the objective. The institutions of learning have been brain washing machines to achieve the objective for generations. What is the real reason why so many are against school vouchers and charter schools and getting rid of the national education association?The Koran calls Muslims who do not follow sharia law hypocrites who will go to hell. It says those who migrate for the cause of Allah will receive the same reward as the mujahedeen the fighters. It calls Allah the greatest of schemers. The scheme is world wide sharia.The hypocrites are brave Muslim  souls who have love for fellow man and who do not follow sharia. The migration of Islam across civilized nations is being used to further break down society physically and psychologically. Along with increasing natural disasters and war against those who do not follow the plan for the NWO.The Arab Spring was to remove non sharia governments. Egypt, Libya, Syria. To further radicalize the middle East and set up the war against Israel. The Pulitzer prize winner Seymour Hersh said he believes Hillary was involved in the gas attack in Syria blamed on Assad. Obama was involved in the uprising in the Ukraine and replacing a Democratically elected government. Putin who is against the NWO is protecting his interests and trying to stop WWIII . He is up against the NWO propaganda machine. You are being lied to on a massive scale. Do your own research, remove the political correct scales from your eyes which have been created to blind you to your own destruction. General William Boykin, Admiral Lyons, Lt. Colonel Tony Shaffer, EX CIA intelligence specialists Clair Lopez, Frank Gaffney assistant director of Defense under Reagan, DHS whistle blower Philip Haney, respected investigative journalist Andrew McCarthy, Michele Bachmann...say, the Muslim Brotherhood has infiltrated every level of our government. They say at Benghazi we switched sides on the war on terror. Andrew McCarthy says Hillary secretary Huma Abiden is Muslim Brotherhood. ISIS has been used for migration saturation Jihad. Hillary will finish off the Constitution. Obama will go to the United Nations. We will become a police state as crisis response in order to control the insurrection created by fomenting hate against police, racism, and sharia law Muslims. Most of this is being financed by George Soros one of the most evil men on earth. We will go to into WWIII on the wrong side of the war. They didn't count on Trump. He was a wrench in the spokes. Now they have to destroy him by any means.Choose Trump or choose the NWO.

The only time you plead the 5th is when you can incriminate yourself if you make any statements about a specific crime in question that will lead to you implicating your self... The only time you get immunity is to give the inner workings of a crime... They don't give innocent people immunity deals...

6 | Greg Pollitt | 66 | 10154772910146336_10154772981216336 | Tonight think about this historic election and I think about our great moments in history. I think about the birth of our nation from tyranny and oppression the 13 colonies banded together and ask George Washington to lead the colonial army against King George. I think about The Bravery it took to ask that man to lead a nation for its independence. I think about World War 1 when our young men and women or ask to help save the world against than ever growing German threat. I think about World War 2 when once again our young men and women called upon 2 fight oppression and tyranny again to liberate Jews from the Holocaust. UC tyranny and oppression come in many forms since our independence we've been on the outside looking in freeing those who could not fight for themselves and it brings me back to the question of asking George Washington our first president to lead an infant Nation and compare it to the battle that we have today we have the opportunity that many democracies that have fallen never had that opportunity is to save itself. For the first time a failing democracy can clearly see its enemy and we can defeat it we can restore our great nation to the land of opportunity as a beacon of freedom and Hope or we can watch it fall for the policies the oppression the attacks of our Bill of Rights the institution of Supreme Court Justices that will ultimately destroy our constitution. So tonight or tomorrow before you cast your ballot put yourself in the shoes George Washington put yourself in the shoes of General George Patton put yourself in the shoes all the young men and women who fought for freedom for this country and ask are you ready to let that go? Are you ready to let America fall? You see this election is not about Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton this election is about Freedom versus oppression this election is about Hope and opportunity where we will see our country change and become like those  that we fight in the Middle East.Through the policies of Barack Obama Hillary Clinton John Kerry our country is facing more terrorist attacks on this nation in the last 8 years then it has at any point in its lifespan we cannot allow Terror in the heartland of America because from Iowa to Maine New York to California this is the land of opportunity this is the land of freedom when you cast your ballot tomorrow if you vote for Hillary Clinton and her policies and her vision of this country you're throwing all that away!No no one expects any politician to be perfect but Donald Trump has been the perfect person to shed the light on the corruption on the media so that we can see just how brainwashed we are becoming. I'm like Donald Trump you and I have all said things that we regret we've done things we wish we could change but none of those things that we've done collectively has harmed alife no one has thrown a life away like Hillary Clinton has! You see I never want my children to go to war none of us do but if that mission is laid at their feet and they are called upon to serve I want a commander in chief that will fight tooth and nail and give their last breath to ensure the wall they ask my son or daughter to fight they will give them every resource to live! The men in Benghazi ask for help from Hillary Clinton even in their last dying breath and she refused that's not a leader that's a coward!So if you Dawn upon the voting polls tomorrow,I asked you to vote for the life of Ambassador Chris Stevens and the men who died in Benghazi I asked you to vote for every life that we lost in Vietnam I asked you to vote for the great wealth of life that we lost through two world wars I ask you not only to vote your conscience but the vote for your future vote for our future.This is now our fight this is our way to Stick it to the the government because it no longer serves us, it serves them the exact reason why we fought for independence so it's your mission to fight for independence once again opportunity grab the brass ring and to become a patriot that you read about in school it's time to heal and unite this country like dr. Martin Luther King hoped for it's time we stopped being African Americans, Hispanics or Latinos and Native Americans it's time we were just simply Americans this is our country and it's time they remember that!I know if any of you read this it may not change your vote one way or the other but I hope you put your own differences aside and look at the bigger picture look at what affects our brothers and sisters As Americans throughout this nation and if you truly look with objective eyes you'll see there's only one path to make America great againVote for Donald Trump!
7 | Donald Smith | 81 | 10154772910146336_10154772977001336 | Hillary and Obama are desperately campaigning in Michigan and Pennsylvania on the eve of the election. They are terrified of low voter turnout. Particularly among the black voters. And they should be. They have failed to help the inner cities of America, and they have failed to energize their base by nominating a criminal. It's over for them.

I don't understand why people are fighting over the difference..... other than the Fact Trump used loopholes that everyone of you as well as I would use to pay less Taxes.... Clearly Clinton had 30 Years to close this Loophole.... she didn't.... just like she didn't do much else in office besides lining her pockets with cash thru the Foundation...in which that Foundation was used to Pay for her Daughter's Wedding.... I gotta say this---- if you believe this Corrupt Person (Hillary Clinton) is the best thing for office... not only are you mislead in this Election you are Clearly Part of the Problem--- Don't be afraid of Change--- Give Him a Chance #Trump2016
9 | Tammie Lillard | 51 | 10154772910146336_10154772976206336 | With as many Christians, Jews and Muslims in America how is this race even close? Each of our faiths is against abortion. Christian faith says God knew us before we were born and thou shall not kill, Muslim faith states a fetus is a living soul at 4 months and Jewish faith states abortion is forbidden with exception given according to Jewish scholar Rashi In regard to life-risking pregnancies, How is it so many woman are voting for a person that will uphold the practice of late term abortion? I would rather stand with God and be judged by the world than stand with this world and be judged by God.

13 | Frank De Orio | 18 | 10154772910146336_10154772983896336 | Imagine it is November 9, 2016 in America and we wake up knowing who our new President will be. If it is Hillary, think of the groups of people that will celebrate. Illegal Immigrants, criminals and future criminals who will be supported for pulling a gun on a police officer, planned parenthood, the media, and the list goes on and on that represent everything that is wrong with America. If you're still "with her," look around at who you'll be celebrating with. Now imagine waking up knowing that Trump is our new President. You may or may not like him, or really know what kind of president he will be. But here are some things you will know for sure:‚Ä¢ The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.‚Ä¢ The media has been neutered forever.‚Ä¢ Career politicians will have lost all job security.‚Ä¢ The guns in your home will safely stay there.‚Ä¢ Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.‚Ä¢ Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally‚Ä¢ Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.‚Ä¢ No more apologies to the world for being great!‚Ä¢ Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.‚Ä¢ Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.‚Ä¢ There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.‚Ä¢ The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.‚Ä¢ The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.#trump2016.
14 | Donna Williams Gooch | 5 | 10154772910146336_10154773029641336 | How does Hillary stand before the American people and say she is for protecting women and children but yet take $20 mil from Saudi Arabia, a country where a woman needs "male guardian" approval on everything from obtaining a passport to seeking higher education. They also have no divorce rights.The same male approval is needed for marriage in United Arab Emirates, plus laws there also allow a husband to assault his wife and children. And what they do to LGBT is disgraceful!! I am so glad I saw this before tomorrow but you are right Hillary, the educated women of America will do the right thing on Tuesday!
15 | Michael Redding | 11 | 10154772910146336_10154773009811336 | I think Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Florida, Nevada and Pennsylvania will all go Republican plus every other "leaning Rep" state on your map. Unless there's a rigged election like VA and the voting felons, Trump will win.

17 | Billiejo Thornsbrough-Jones | 6 | 10154772910146336_10154772993416336 | Hillary wants the presidency for her own personal ambitions, as well as for the deals she's made.

One day after she was fully cleared by the Director of FBI of any wrongdoing (for the second time), it turns out the bureau is now moving on Donald Trump over his apparently illegal connections to the Russian government and other Russian entities.It turns out the FISA warrant in question was granted back in October, but as has been his pattern, FBI Director James Comey made a point of keeping that information secret ‚Äì even as he tried and failed to air Hillary Clinton‚Äôs ultimately non-existent dirty laundry. The FBI in particular is using the warrant to pursue Donald Trump‚Äôs private server, which computer scientists have determined is for secret direct communication with the largest bank in Russia.

On November 8th, we should all vote for #TrumpPence16. Let's #MAGA and #DrainTheSwamp God Bless America! God Bless Us All! God Bless Donald J. Trump and Mike Pence, their families and team!
16 | Jerry King | 17 | 10154772832391336_10154772944971336 | Thank you to all who have fought your hearts for Donald J. Trump!!!!!! This is what I will be telling My GrandChildren when they ask.....'Pepe, were you a hero in the meme war?' No,'" I answered, 'but I served in a company of heroes.'
17 | Sam Suzanne Roberts | 26 | 10154772832391336_10154772914861336 | We must not surrender! Defeat Hillary!!!"Give up your dreams of freedom because to save our own skins, we're willing to make a deal with your slave masters." Alexander Hamilton said, "A nation which can prefer disgrace to danger is prepared for a master, and deserves one." Now let's set the record straight. There's no argument over the choice between peace and war, but there's only one guaranteed way you can have peace‚Äîand you can have it in the next second‚Äîsurrender. Admittedly, there's a risk in any course we follow other than this, but every lesson of history tells us that the greater risk lies in appeasement, and this is the specter our well-meaning liberal friends refuse to face‚Äîthat their policy of accommodation is appeasement, and it gives no choice between peace and war, only between fight or surrender. If we continue to accommodate, continue to back and retreat, eventually we have to face the final demand‚Äîthe ultimatum. And what then‚Äîwhen Nikita Khrushchev has told his people he knows what our answer will be? He has told them that we're retreating under the pressure of the Cold War, and someday when the time comes to deliver the final ultimatum, our surrender will be voluntary, because by that time we will have been weakened from within spiritually, morally, and economically. He believes this because from our side he's heard voices pleading for "peace at any price" or "better Red than dead," or as one commentator put it, he'd rather "live on his knees than die on his feet." And therein lies the road to war, because those voices don't speak for the rest of us. You and I know and do not believe that life is so dear and peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery. If nothing in life is worth dying for, when did this begin‚Äîjust in the face of this enemy? Or should Moses have told the children of Israel to live in slavery under the pharaohs? Should Christ have refused the cross? Should the patriots at Concord Bridge have thrown down their guns and refused to fire the shot heard 'round the world? The martyrs of history were not fools, and our honored dead who gave their lives to stop the advance of the Nazis didn't die in vain. Where, then, is the road to peace? Well it's a simple answer after all. You and I have the courage to say to our enemies, "There is a price we will not pay." "There is a point beyond which they must not advance." ~ Ronald Reagan
18 | William Thompson | 29 | 10154772832391336_10154772913506336 | To those Democrats that keep bringing up Trump raping a 13 year old, didn't happen and that case was thrown out of court a week ago.
19 | Mabel L Santos | 23 | 10154772832391336_10154772939961336 | Tonight, let's Pray for our Future President and VP .. God the Father .I ask and pray that you protect Mr Trump and Mr Pence.. Strengthen Trump& Pence in the power of Your might, O God. Dress them in Your armor so that they can stand firm against the schemes of the devil. We know that our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places. I pray and this things in the Name of our Savior Jesus Christ Amen... Praise God the Father of all creatures.. Blessing's upon Mr Trump and Mr Pence... Amen.

21 | Biza P. Dragun | 11 | 10154772832391336_10154772958791336 | He will win the popular vote but, I believe the electoral college has already been bought and paid for by the corrupticons so he will lose to the felon. I also believe that Trump will not take it sitting down and roll over like Romney did. I'm waiting for the "after party" of all the investigative attorneys uncovering proof of corruption at the polls while the Obama WH obstructs as much as they can.
22 | Mark Poindexter | 17 | 10154772832391336_10154772937861336 | Tonight is the night all America needs to get on their knees, confess their sins, & make vows to God Almighty and pray pray pray He shows us Grace tomorrow. For truly Trump would be His Blessing as sure as Hillary will be His Curse for our Wantonness. Please my Fellow Countrymen. VOTE TRUMP!!

24 | Susan Rigo | 14 | 10154772832391336_10154772919326336 | I'm praying ...we have to stop this corruption from ruining our country completely. Imagine HRC having all of our money as her piggy bank. Scary!
25 | Kenn Kerr | 9 | 10154772832391336_10154772951366336 | Everyone has GOT to get out and VOTE!!!  Hillary represents the establishment, she's a Washington Insider, an elitist and she is going to keep everything exactly the same way in DC - Lobbyists will run this country while she funnels money into the Clinton Crime Family.  Trump will give this country a real shot at changing the way things are done in DC.  But you have to vote!!!

1 | Donna Taylor Wallace | 137 | 10154772596696336_10154772879321336 | I am voting for Donald Trump. For the last 16 years I have listened to our POTUS claim they were Christians but their actions prove differently. It is quite apparent that none of them have opened the Bible to read it, and certainly not the end of it. Israel is a very important part of how this will end and on that point alone, Trump is the only one who realizes that, He knows what must be done in the middle east. Rise up Church and open your eyes and ears to the truth. If you haven't opened your Bible in a while, now is the time! Jesus Christ will open your eyes to the truth...anything else is just rhetoric. God Bless us all ‚ô° MAKE SURE YOU VOTE!!!
2 | Andreas Klingmann | 69 | 10154772596696336_10154772869036336 | This woman Hillary Clinton is fighting her own war and she has no rules. No boundaries. She doesn't flinch at extortion, corruption, theft, murder and abuse of power. She's not loyal to the flag or the country or any set of ideals. She trades blood for money. A Hillary Clinton victory would be a disaster, the Russians and the rest of the world ain't gonna let this disaster go unanswered. It's gonna get bloody. No one's gonna say a word when the Russians club every American they can reach. For decades, American governments have made a mess of things, and the whole world just f---ing watched. No more. Apparently, Hillary Clinton supporters love corruption. Very well then. If YOU don't want to stop corruption in your OWN country, then someone else has to do it for you. We Europeans have finally woken up, we will knock our treacherous politicians to hell. Angela Merkel will suffer a bitter defeat next year. And America may choose a woman who is exactly like Merkel. F---ing unbelievable. While Europe will be free, America will fall. I'm Sorry, but you really are the most stupid people on this planet. America, you're still a friend, but if Hillary Clinton wins, you will get to be the enemy.
3 | MarkandCara Fowler | 39 | 10154772596696336_10154772880081336 | So happy for Tucker! Since he's been covering the election on all of the different Fox shows, I have such a newfound found respect and admiration for him as a reporter! We are tuning in!
4 | Lucy Bella | 22 | 10154772596696336_10154772894731336 | Imagine it is November 9, 2016 in America and we wake up knowing who our new President will be. If it is Hillary, think of the groups of people that will celebrate. Illegal Immigrants, criminals and future criminals, BLM, Lazy none working people who don't have to worry about heath care they get free! get out & Vote! I VOTED
5 | Daniel Gunnoe | 10 | 10154772596696336_10154772891831336 | So my question is this... Did he have anchorman hair and decide to be an anchorman because of it, or did he become an anchorman and then decided the hair?What came first?
6 | Kari Hopkins | 13 | 10154772596696336_10154772908931336 | The irony of this is Greta van Sustren scolding and shaming Mr. Carlson earlier this year on her show. I like that he's not politically correct. Let this trend keep growing!
7 | Bud Paine | 9 | 10154772596696336_10154772967956336 | Now if they get rid of Shepard Smith, Juan Williams, Geraldo and Megan Kelly maybe Fox News can get back to being a trustworthy conservative news outlet again. We mostly had satellite for Fox News/Fox Business but got rid of it after they went so rogue liberal. Sure do miss Varney, though!
8 | MarkandCara Fowler | 7 | 10154772596696336_10154772930406336 | ***ALERT***Elizabeth Day (who is harassing people on this FNC post) is a lazy paid troll from the Clinton campaign! She is copying and pasting the same EXACT response to all of our comments on this Fox News post!!! Check it out for yourself!
9 | Lisa McNair Ridge | 8 | 10154772596696336_10154772891161336 | At least he(Trump) didn't let 4 American's die. And Billy boy Clinton has done and said far worse to women than Mr Trumps could ever even think of. All the while, Killary was defending her lying, cheating puke of a husband.
10 | Jerry King | 4 | 10154772596696336_10154772945116336 | Thank you to all who have fought your hearts for Donald J. Trump!!!!!! This is what I will be telling My GrandChildren when they ask.....'Pepe, were you a hero in the meme war?' No,'" I answered, 'but I served in a company of heroes.'
11 | Darlene Bailey | 2 | 10154772596696336_10154773239351336 | I hope you are nothing like Don Lemon over at CNN I had quit that show,I'm a fox viewer now,I think you will do great,I'm glad you got rid of that bow tie when you was on Crossfire,and you had some bad hair days also,,LOL I think your show will be great‚ù§Ô∏èüòä
12 | Josie Saldanha C | 1 | 10154772596696336_10154773111326336 | FBI Director James Comey was being honoured by the non-profit Federal Drug Agents Foundation on Monday night. Three of its members have longtime ties to Donald Trump, including the CEO of the company that publishes The National Enquirer, the developer of a Trump-branded tower in Toronto and a convicted felon whose company rates Trump businesses.
13 | Ronnie Jo Bingham | 4 | 10154772596696336_10154772911546336 | Elizabeth you can't be serious. Donald Trump didn't need money & he's constantly being audited. Just like many of us; he was sick and tired of liberals destroying this country!Wise up!
14 | Mike Howard | 0 | 10154772596696336_10154774173956336 | REASONS TO NOT VOTE HILLARY..copy and share‚ö†Ô∏èIf you are Gay, Why are you voting for Hillary when she wants to bring in thousands of refugees that believe all Gays should be executed?üëÅ‚ö†Ô∏èIf you are Black, Why are you voting for Hillary when she admires Margaret Sanger and defends Planned Parenthood who want to abort as many black babies as possible? Exterminate the black race because they are like "weeds". (Margaret Sanger quote) Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.üëÅ‚ö†Ô∏èIf you are a Christian, Why are you voting for Hillary Clinton when she wrote her Senior thesis on Saul Alinsky who dedicated his book 'Rules for Radicals' to Lucifer (the Devil)? She says he was, and still is her mentor.üëÅ‚ö†Ô∏èIf you are a Veteran, in the Military, or closely related to a Military member, Why are you voting for Hillary when she left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again? They called for help but the help was told to stand down.üëÅ‚ö†Ô∏èIf you have a factory job, Why are you voting for Hillary when she supported TPP? Factory workers are being laid off because jobs are going over seas. Don't forget the deals she's made with china. She also welcomes open borders and illegals to get benefits to be paid with Your tax money.üëÅ‚ö†Ô∏èIf you are poor, Why are you voting for Hillary, when she is supporting Wall street and all the big banks? Big banks keep poor people poor by destroying the poor man's credit by allowing medical bills and collections to affect your credit scores so you can pay higher interest rates than the rich; Taking much of the little money you earn.üëÅ‚ö†Ô∏èIf you are a Woman, how can you vote for Hillary when she has buried all of Bills rape victims under the rug, including that little girl that was raped? Lawyer Hillary defended the rapist, and then she laughed about it later, knowing that he was guilty.If you carry a gun, or believe in the Constitution; How can you vote for Hillary when she wants to eliminate the NRA, Take your guns, and abolish the second Amendment?üëÅ‚ö†Ô∏èIf you breathe, Why would you vote for Hillary when she and the Clinton crime family have left a trail of dead people that did not agree with her, or they knew too much?Who is left? üëÅ....written by Mary lab
15 | Anthony Centamore | 4 | 10154772596696336_10154772911101336 | I believe in the American People. The hard working families throughout our country who's challenge is to provide for their children, live from pay check to pay check to pay their bills, try to live a decent and respectful life? All of us can agree we don't like to be cheated, lied to, taken advantage of in sneaky and underhanded ways? I believe they will see before they pull that level where the truth really lies..
16 | Rick Robyn | 6 | 10154772596696336_10154772877891336 | Election Day. Thank God it's almost over!As I've said for months , it doesn't matter which one of these two win Evil Hillary or Crazy Trump, we the American people LOSE!! I've given up hope as far as us ever getting an honest politician for President. We almost got one with Bernie Sanders but that opportunity was stolen from us in the Primary. Whoever wins won't be able to do anything because there will be investigations and probably impeachment proceedings going on the whole time. Nobody will leave the country and the same problems will still be there. Congress will continue to do nothing as they have for the last 16 years. So all this stress and worrying has been for nothing so calm down, relax, take a pill if you need it and let's all just move on. Oh yeah one last thing Go Vote or shut the hell up for the next 4 years!
17 | Nancy Angulo | 0 | 10154772596696336_10154773833611336 | I don't understand how Fox News think they are going to survive after the election. We saw lots of rhetoric coming from them. Megan Kelly and her bigotry was the worst. www.oann.comFor really journalism.
18 | Lisa McNair Ridge | 0 | 10154772596696336_10154773006266336 | That wasn't the point .Killary defended her husband knowing what he has said and done. Perhaps, that small little tidbit doesn't matter to you, but it does to me. It shows extreme lack of character and empathy for others . Killary  and Billy boy are two of the most corrupt people on this earth. Stop watching MSNBC.

25 | Mona Gunnells | 1 | 10154772596696336_10154772899981336 | Love this.. LolTwas the Night Before the Electionby Eddie Zipperer‚ÄòTwas the night before the election, when all through the nation, Not a citizen felt safe ‚Äî from globalization. The courts overturned, every ID law of note, In hopes that illegals would show up to vote.John Kasich was nestled all snug in his mansion, Not a fear in the world ‚Äôbout government expansion. His vote for McCain already locked in; His pledge to Republicans like dust in the wind.Then suddenly on Twitter there arose such a clatter, I sprang to the web to see what was the matter. Grabbed I my iPhone from the pocket of my trousers, Entered my pass code and pulled up the browser.Searching the page for the latest news pings,‚ÄòBout WikiLeaks and Comey and spirit cooking, When, what to my wondering eyes should appear, But a slew of new polls, showing 10 states unclear.And a video of a woman, so screechy and scary, I knew in a moment it must be the secretary. Pushed I the triangle and the video played, Clinton whistled, and shouted, and called them by name;‚ÄúNow, Blitzer! now, Raddatz ! now, Mika and Joe! On, Harwood! on Halperin! on, Thrush! All you go!‚ÄùShe screamed like a banshee, ‚ÄúTo Penn Avenue!‚ÄùI knew in an instant what she‚Äôd need them to do.‚ÄúThere‚Äôs scandal and corruption that must disappear,‚ÄòTill the ninth of November when I‚Äôm in the clear, With my cloth and my Bleachbit, I‚Äôll take that server and clean herJust don‚Äôt report on the laptop of Anthony Weiner!‚ÄùThen, Bill Clinton‚Äôs voice wrought wholly with strife Said ‚Äúthe FBI is coming for me and my wife. Only one lady can save us from political stain, I‚Äôll sort this all out in the cab of her plane.‚ÄùThere was only one man who could stop the corruption; He‚Äôd fought and he‚Äôd spewed like a volcanic eruption. He‚Äôd beat down John Kasich, Lil‚Äô Marco, and Ted And Carly and Christie, and low-energy Jeb!His eyes ‚Äî how they squinted! His stare was aggressive! His cheeks were like oranges, his stature impressive! His mad little mouth was pursed to its limit, His hair so majestic, no scissors dared trim it.He‚Äôd straight to his plan, no grandeur or pomp, To bring back the jobs and drain out the swamp! And if Florida, N.C., and Ohio turn red, To save us from the woman America dreads,He‚Äôll spring to his podium, among cheers that he‚Äôs stomped her, He‚Äôll speak from his heart and tear down the prompter! And we‚Äôll hear him exclaim, above globalist neighing:‚ÄúI‚ÄôM BUILDING A WALL ‚Äî AND MEXICO‚ÄôS PAYING!‚Äù

2 | Joe Starkey | 1324 | 10154771967296336_10154772770261336 | Unlike Hillary, Trump is self-funding his campaign. He is not beholden to any special interests, lobbyists, or donors. When Trump is elected, he will be free to do what‚Äôs in the best interest of the American people and he won‚Äôt owe anyone any favors.
3 | Carl Smith | 692 | 10154771967296336_10154772772436336 | So you voting for higher premiums on healthcare that we didn't ask for? Or how about all the refugees that will be allowed that the "people" get to pay for? Or is it the higher taxes that will kill small businesses? Or is it all the supreme justices that don't  honor the constitution? Or how about killing a baby moments before it's born? That's my points and I will not support someone that wants these, few of many, burdens placed upon on the "people". I could care less Democrat or Republican, he did this, she said that, I don't care about that!! That's what you have when people run for the president. I am smart enough to look beyond all that and choose the candidate that is gonna help the "people". Sorry Hillary just isn't that person!!
4 | Mike Gionfriddo | 500 | 10154771967296336_10154772773256336 | God bless everybody tomorrow and after tomorrow. Whatever the outcome. Still want to hold people who say they are leaving if Trump wins to their word.
5 | Timothy Navarre | 462 | 10154771967296336_10154772793091336 | Itz not Republican vs. Democrat. Itz the American people vs. the face of political corruption and greed. This is America's  last chance to stand up against everything all Americans hate about Washington politics. #MAGA #TRUMP2016 #DRAIN #THE #SWAMP

8 | Jeff Zienty | 280 | 10154771967296336_10154772778831336 | Hillary can't get a crowd without Bruce Springsteen, Lebron, Jay Z, Beyonc√©, or Katy Perry. She has to bribe her own supporters.
9 | Myra White | 109 | 10154771967296336_10154772798346336 | We should all commit to one another that we will pray at the same time tomorrow morning. I'm guessing polls open at 7am everywhere. I am central time so if I start at 6am I can pray with the eastern time voters and continue every hour on the hour to stop and pray with each time zone as the polls open.  I think we are facing the biggest decision of our life to this point in our country's history.  I may sound nuts to some of you but what do we have to lose if we just try. Any takers?
10 | Terry Moshier | 112 | 10154771967296336_10154772780196336 | There is a civil war taking place in America, a war for the hearts and minds of everyone in voting booths across America. Be That Patriot, Stand For Good, Shine the Light on the evil that is leading our country to destruction, Pray For our Nation and Vote for Mr Donald Trump.

12 | Daniel Frusco | 101 | 10154771967296336_10154772772891336 | Is it true Obama have given illegal‚Äôs the right to vote on TV just go and do it. That is a in unconstitutional. He should be impeached for that he has no right to give that permission. Not a word from the media over this. .http://www.washingtonpost.com/.../stories/watergatedoc.htmwhere is congress at this time and his actions has violated the elections laws and he made the Democratic vote invalided, he has no power to grant this and has over step his office.Has just declared him shelf a dictator by over stepping his office and  has violated his oath of office and Constitution.
13 | Roy Glass | 111 | 10154771967296336_10154772773416336 | Do not be distracted! Democrats want open borders, higher taxes, more "refugees" & illegals, weakened military & police, abolish the 2nd Amendment, Leftist judges, more BLM, and more islamic influence. THAT IS NOT A CHOICE!!!!! Trump/Pence 2016!
14 | Christopher Cook | 67 | 10154771967296336_10154772772386336 | We've had enough of career politicians who are more interested in lining their own pockets than they are about the lives of the people who elected them..
15 | Kim Brouhard | 39 | 10154771967296336_10154772829566336 | After watching the American people struggle to even make it, sometimes 2-3 jobs each, and the gov sitting all cushy and flying around the world on vacations, we are fed up!!!
16 | Sherry Dial Doss | 80 | 10154771967296336_10154772770076336 | Really the derogatory remarks about women from Trump but your show biz supporters trashes women way worse and your husband treated the women the way he did committing lewd acts on them get real Hillary and supporters, Delusional . Anything for a buck and a vote.
17 | Lisa Low McMeans | 74 | 10154771967296336_10154772830176336 | I've always believed that the American people would rise up and fight for their country, just like after the Pearl Harbor attack. This quote from Japan's Admiral has been playing in my mind this entire election cycle. "I fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve. - Isoroku YamamotoPlease get out and vote for America tomorrow. Vote TRUMP!
18 | Tyler Amadeus | 63 | 10154771967296336_10154772797641336 | From day one of this campaign, the analysts, "experts", pundits, career politicians and the establishments have said we would never make it this far. Tomorrow, we will once again prove them all wrong. Tomorrow as the world watches, we will make history, and together, we will make America great again! #TrumpPence2016 Follow me on Twitter @Noturtypicalgay
19 | Ronnie Watkins | 59 | 10154771967296336_10154772833686336 | I will be voting for Trump tomorrow. My number ONE reason is because he is the only person running who seems to value the life of an unborn child and to me, that is enough in itself.However, besides pro life, he is pro police, pro 2nd amendment, pro military, and pro business. All of which I support. I will not debate anyone on this so if you do not agree, then keep scrolling because this post isn't for you-vote however you wish-it is a free country (so far). If you do not plan to vote or are undecided then please take a minute to read this.....Imagine it is November 9, 2016 in America and we wake up knowing who our new President will be. If it is Hillary, think of the groups of people that will celebrate. Illegal Immigrants, criminals and future criminals who will be supported for pulling a gun on a police officer, planned parenthood, the media, and the list goes on and on that represent everything that is wrong with America. If you're still "with her," look around at who you'll be celebrating with. Now imagine waking up knowing that Trump is our new President. You may or may not like him, or really know what kind of president he will be. But here are some things you will know for sure:‚Ä¢ The Clinton Corruption is destroyed and rendered powerless.‚Ä¢ The media has been neutered forever.‚Ä¢ Career politicians will have lost all job security.‚Ä¢ The guns in your home will safely stay there.‚Ä¢ Preachers will be free to preach truth without the threat of government interference.‚Ä¢ Israel will have no doubt that we are truly their ally‚Ä¢ Iran will not get one more plane full of cash.‚Ä¢ No more apologies to the world for being great!‚Ä¢ Our enemies, most of which help fund Hillary's campaign will definitely be a little scared.‚Ä¢ Our healthcare rates stand a real good chance of going down.‚Ä¢ There is at least some hope that new manufacturing jobs will be coming back to your state.‚Ä¢ The drug cartel and other criminals currently crossing our borders will realize their days are numbered.‚Ä¢ The police will be supported so they can restore law and order.The list could go on and on, but it sounds like America may be on the road to becoming great again within the first few hours on November 9 if Trump does win.Copy and paste this as your status if you support and will vote Donald J. Trump for President
20 | Steve Taylor | 51 | 10154771967296336_10154772791746336 | the revolt IS against the political class, but is also against the media and should be extended to the schools for indoctrinating our youth into subservience
21 | John Cav | 40 | 10154771967296336_10154772832416336 | If she is elected which I hope and pray to God she isn't, I will say this. I will never recognize or respect her as the president of my country. Get out and vote for Trump !!!
22 | Peggy Martinian Grigorian | 41 | 10154771967296336_10154772826291336 | Thank you Patrick Caddell for putting into words what the country or silent majority has been struggling with for the past 8 years. Not the direction Americans feel comfortable with, in fact we feel anger & disillusioned. We have no connection with this administration ... and visa versa. At this point we have no expectations of change, nor do we want their version of change, that is why we want our country back. Go Trump üá∫üá∏
23 | Noelle Vishney | 26 | 10154771967296336_10154772800456336 | There will be a revolt!!!! Trumps got this!!! The only way Hillary wins is if it's rigged and we, the people, will NOT accept that!!!!
24 | Patricia Russo Lambertucci | 33 | 10154771967296336_10154772800496336 | democrats are always saying "we are for all americans" yet all you hear from pundits and political analysts is the"latino" vote will determine the elections. is there something wrong with that. you have to be blind if you don't see the pandering to minorities. actually, i find it demeaning and condescending to them
25 | Sarah Gruenwald Krause | 19 | 10154771967296336_10154772824231336 | To all Christians. Do NOT be deceived. This election is about the Supreme Court. David was a  adulterer who hired a hit man, but the Lord used him. Trump can be used. Please. Don't hand the keys to the kingdom to the new world order by "sitting this one out" or voting 3rd party.

2 | Rodolfo Alberto | 917 | 10154772245326336_10154772435456336 | The mainstream media and the political establishment decided that it's Hillary Clinton's "turn" to be President. But the American people get the final say‚Äîand tomorrow, we will stop her. #SpreadThisTextPlease
3 | Giulio Braga | 588 | 10154772245326336_10154772435486336 | Well‚Ä¶ I don't have to love every comment coming from Trump to understand the importance of a Trump presidency. Whether you like Trump or not, a Trump Presidency is a threat to the entire political system.It will demonstrate that the highest office in the land does not have to go to a career politician. That "The People" are the ones who determine who will be President.Should this happen it will definitively prove that every political office is up for grabs by "We The People", from the highest office to the lowest.This is what the establishment fears most.Thank you- #TrumpPence #MAGA

6 | Ren De Villon | 155 | 10154772245326336_10154772435811336 | Never in my lifetime that I've prayed in behalf of a particular politician; especially one who's running for US President. Not even to my own country that I ever did it for our own leaders; only now! I just really hope God listens; and delivers the win for Donald J. Trump; so as he be reckoned the 45th President of the United States of America.

8 | Kimberly Boyd | 80 | 10154772245326336_10154772445121336 | So people who aren't even citizens are supposed to be allowed to vote, but this man, a citizen, votes and his signature doesn't match so it doesn't count. How can this be? I.D. isn't supposed to be required to vote now, and this man's signature didn't match?!  Which is it, folks?
9 | Barry Gogel | 94 | 10154772245326336_10154772435441336 | Lying , cheating , corrupt , crook . This is not what the first ever woman President of the United States should be known as.HILLARY, NOT THIS ELECTION....NOT EVER!!!!TRUMP 2016!!!!!

11 | Alex Malagon | 22 | 10154772245326336_10154772456656336 | Yet, our president encourages non-citizens to go out and vote. We must Drain the Swamp tomorrow! Get everyone you know out to vote and throw out the dirty bath water aka as The Clinton's.
12 | Mary Engel | 18 | 10154772245326336_10154772457796336 | Live in Florida my sister filled out the form . said it was fine .a few days later got letter said it was missing something but did not say what. Now its to late to send another , my guess?  The word Republican had something to do with it. Now the president said illegals can vote,but looks like true Americans can't.
13 | Micki Allen | 14 | 10154772245326336_10154772450646336 | the Left has done everything in their power to prevent Trump from winning.

15 | Jennifer Stedman Smith | 16 | 10154772245326336_10154772464036336 | There should be procedures in place for this sort of situation. No matter who they voted for, they should have a right to vote. I'm not a Trump or Clinton supporter but right is right and this man's vote should count.
16 | Amanda Ross | 5 | 10154772245326336_10154772525221336 | This is so sad. The dems want illegals to have the right to vote, but a sick, dying American can't??! How much worse does our country have to get before people wake up?
17 | Debbie Jones | 12 | 10154772245326336_10154772455011336 | A sick, elderly man's legit signature is declined but millions of illegal's votes in California will more than likely be counted?!? Lord, help us down here!!!!
18 | Jodie Tinder | 6 | 10154772245326336_10154772579946336 | And they can illegally mark ballots in a locked secret room, but this man's terminal cancer has taken its toll on his body- so his vote is discounted? With family members there to vouch for who he is. America ....this is NOT right on any level
19 | Kimberly Smith | 7 | 10154772245326336_10154772472486336 | We need a method to allow people in hospitals to vote. They should have a voice! My grandfather was admitted over the weekend and won't get the opportunity to vote this year and is worried about not being able to do his duty to keep traitor Hillary out of the White House.
20 | Jerry Chuck Smith | 12 | 10154772245326336_10154772466586336 | And so it begins... let's stand together and Yes let's make America Great Again !! and Everybody needs to remember that when you hear that Trump is winning tomorrow, don't believe it why ?? Because they lie !!!, the Democrats will have east coast pollsters lie to you in an attempt to keep the voters west of the Mississippi at home !!! If your a Trump voter please we all need you too, go vote no matter what you hear !! Vote Trump!!!
21 | Stan Urbaniak | 2 | 10154772245326336_10154772513521336 | Wow. They tried to do the same thing to my mother. She too has cancer and just simply does not have the strength to make it to the polls. Her signature unfortunately did not match what was on record. I had to go to the courthouse to straighten out, and today I dropped off her absentee ballot, which required me to sign 3 different times. Hopefully her vote counts, and I hope the same for Mr. Korinko.
22 | Mark Wofford | 2 | 10154772245326336_1366003400107177 | Election Fraud will happen when the voters will be deceived by the Corrupt Leftist Democrat Media when they start to call states early for Hillary Clinton before most or all the votes are reported in order to suppress votes for Trump and Pence throughout the country.
23 | Amanda Nicole | 3 | 10154772245326336_10154772559011336 | Leave it to Florida to screw things up. Dying mans signature doesn't match meanwhile ppl who have been dead for 40 years are casting votes! Smdh!
24 | Suzette Romig | 4 | 10154772245326336_10154772470766336 | But illegal immigrants, radical Islamic terrorist, goofy, Micky mouse, Donald Duck, George Washington, and Honest Abe Lincon can all vote without and ID for KILLERY and her Clinton Cartel and all their votes count...!
25 | Crystal Jewell | 1 | 10154772245326336_1601250360181179 | Ridiculous ! I don't care who this man is voting for! His vote should count!!!! He's an American citizen! Funny obama goes on national tv to tell illegals to illegally vote (felony) but this poor man can't get his vote counted for his children's future! This is BS!

She will be more remembered for her scandals than for being the first female president. Is Trump perfect? no, he isn't, but clinton is who will make your life a real hell. Think about it. Thank you - #TrumpPence #MAGA
2 | Robin Capece Field | 5196 | 10154771897816336_10154772159921336 | I AM A WOMAN, NATIVE PENNSYLVANIAN....! When I am casting my vote on November 8, I will NOT think of the "advice" of any entertainer. I WILL however remember the core values I learned being raised in a Christian home; I will remember how they taught me to honor the country of Israel and the Jews; I will remember learning how evil the KKK and segregation were; I will remember the 2nd Amendment for the right to bear arms as my father hunted for food for our table. I was asked tonight how I could support Trump. My response was this....If he had put our nation's security at risk, I would not vote for him. If his organization received large donations from countries that killed women and gays, I would not vote for him. If he boasted 30 Years of government experience, but still could not discern if an email was classified or not, without someone letting him know if it was or not, I would not vote for him. If he boasted about how he has defended children his entire life, but is for abortion, (even late term, when the child can feel pain) I would not vote for him. If he caused lives to be destroyed in Benghazi and then lied to the faces of the parents as they stood at their child's casket, I would not vote for him. If people who came against him mysteriously turned up dead, I would not vote for him. If he suddenly developed a southern accent when he was in the South, campaigning, I would not vote for him. If he continually broke the law and that was ignored, I would not vote for him, but right now, the ONLY person who does ALL these things is Hillary. Right now, the fact that Donald made some regrettable remarks over 12 years ago, does not move me. I'm bigger than those remarks and we all have said stupid things throughout our lives. To me, the fact that Hillary lies continuously, is a much bigger problem. We can see the effects of her lies by the state of our poor country right now... I WILL VOTE FOR TRUMP.
3 | Albert Smith | 2768 | 10154771897816336_10154772154651336 | Hillary has celebrities on her.side, the media, social media, the elite of this country, foreign leaders from Saudi Arabia and other.countries of that nature, and the president.... But all those campaign pushers aren't the average every day American working.class people..... Those people are voting TRUMP.... And trump is winning the people over
4 | Zach Kerman | 2505 | 10154771897816336_10154772153026336 | Michelle Obama said if Donald Trump is elected: "We're telling our sons it's okay to humiliate women. We're telling our daughters this is how they deserve to be treated.".... that's funny. So does that mean that if Hillary Clinton is elected, we are teaching our sons & daughters that it's ok to murder, lie, cover up, be corrupt, demean women, use racial slurs, and stay with a spouse that openly rapes women & cheats on you?
5 | Mabel L Santos | 1730 | 10154771897816336_10154772156116336 | God the Father .I ask and pray that you protect Mr Trump and Mr Pence.. Strengthen Trump& Pence in the power of Your might, O God. Dress them in Your armor so that they can stand firm against the schemes of the devil. We know that our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places. I pray and this things in the Name of our Savior Jesus Christ Amen... Praise God the Father of all creatures.. Blessing's upon Mr Trump and Mr Pence... Amen..
6 | Mark Jones | 1189 | 10154771897816336_10154772152401336 | For the love of God, our families futures, our country, and all of those hundreds of thousands of amazing, unselfish warriors who fought and died to protect our Constitution, PLEASE make sure to vote for Trump tomorrow. Millions have fled other 3rd world lawless, corrupt, and tyrannical countries to come here to have what have...freedom. We have a Constitution that puts We the people in control, not the government . Don't let Clinton make sure we become another 3rd world nation by appointing the wrong people to SCOTUS. May God continue to bless the UNITED States of America. Thank you. Sincerely.
7 | Mark Deda | 720 | 10154771897816336_10154772157806336 | I have never been more disgusted in a presidential election in my entire life. Comey once again paid off by the Clinton campaign. He said the new emails would take months to review.... But took a week to conclude Hillary was not guilty. The system is #Rigged but not to worry the silent majority will have the FINAL say on Tuesday.
8 | Tamara McKamy | 442 | 10154771897816336_10154772178786336 | This is such bunk! TEXAS DOES NOT "LEAN GOP!" There is not a chance in Hell, Texas will turn blue for Hillary! We are straight up, born and bred, RED-blooded, Conservatives. The majority of blues are in Austin and we don't claim them!
9 | Gloria Adams | 292 | 10154771897816336_10154772159491336 | They want you to think that Hillary is winning so Republicans and Trump supporters will think, why bother voting and will not go to the polls!! DO NOT listen to the MEDIA!!
10 | Ann Berfield | 211 | 10154771897816336_10154772159606336 | I live in Illinois and the only county in the whole state that is blue is Cook County up by Chicago....there are 102 counties in the entire state.  Kinda sad really, that one county dictates the election results.  However, we did elect a REPUBLICAN Governor last year so there is still hope!  :)
11 | Mark John Vukelich | 254 | 10154771897816336_10154772155756336 | In recent history our nation had three Pendulum shifts 1) Calvin Coolidge. 2) Ronald Reagan. 3) The Contract with America. These shifts helped to keep our Nation pointed in the correct direction, we are on the brink of shifting to the point of no return. we need a fourth Make America great again.
12 | Brandy Zoeller Ferriell | 156 | 10154771897816336_10154772178386336 | I wish a vote counted as a vote. No more electoral college! Each person is equally as valuable as the next. Legal citizens that is.
13 | Pattie Goshtigian | 122 | 10154771897816336_10154772161746336 | personally hope that people will vote with a conscience. I am not voting for Trump and I'm not voting against Clinton, I am voting for the policies supported by the individual that will keep our amendments in tact and not try to sway from what the founding fathers began with to establish this great country. The Supreme Court Justice that will be placed in the position is key to who gets my vote. I respect others that don't agree with me and I expect the same courtesy with my selection. We are all in this together and while we may not agree on certain things, I think the two most important reasons I'm voting are, for the children and grandchildren. They are the future of this country and I want to make sure that they are not left with a mess from us making bad decisions and trusting the wrong people.I am voting for the candidate who will respect my Christian values and not try to change the inspired Word of God in the Bible. We can do nothing without Him. He is the moral compass that this country needs and should not be removed from everything. So that being said, my vote is going to Donald Trump.Like ¬∑ Reply ¬∑ 2 mins

15 | Kathy Kelly-Wood | 118 | 10154771897816336_10154772161231336 | The saddest part of all of this is that those voting for Hillary are sending a crystal clear message that law and order, and the core principles of the Constitution have no place here in America.
16 | Becky E Krick | 108 | 10154771897816336_10154772163746336 | I will never forget Benghazi. How about you? Hillary doesn't deserve to be president she deserves jail. Koolaid drinkers what will you do when the US the bastion of freedom is gone? All these faux ideas of Hillary are proved wrong just like on Obamacare and we are no longer a free society? I feel so sorry for our country if Clinton is elected. And we will have so much garbage stuffed down our throats just like obamacare. We will be overrun by Islamic terrorists, gangs with ulterior motives killing cops. We are in for terrible times. We will lose the constitution and our rights. This is where I post my long list of Hillary 's past indescretions. I am imploring you to vote Trump. You may not like him and his brash ways but he has our country at heart. And don't believe all those accusations about him before he can clear them up the election will be lost because of dirty campaigning. Just think about all the good people he will have behind him to help save our country. People it's time to really think and take our country back. Hillary is selling off our country to the highest bidder who will deposit bribes to the Clinton foundation. Communist Chinese buying a port in California causing the loss of 18,000 American jobs, Saudi's buying land to grow cattle crops to send back to their country to feed their cattle using our scarce water and selling our uranium to Russia and who knows where it will wind up probably against us. All to our enemies with Reid's help. She leaves a trail of despicable acts in her wake. She has years of lying and bad decisions do we really want this morally bankrupt person for our president? The new messes Benghazi, Haiti gold gate, Russia uranium gate, email gate, bribes to the Clinton foundation etc. We all need to get out and vote Trump! Hillary has an extensive list of corruption and lies. She's not even a lawyer lied one too many times. Her resume. interesting read,someone else posted this,,memory all should know Many people who may vote in the democratic primary election and the general election in 2016 have no real knowledge of Mrs. Clinton or her accomplishments. As a public service, I thought I would provide some input regarding her triumphs for consideration.When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over a health care reform. Even after threats and intimidation, she couldn‚Äôt even get a vote in a democratic controlled congress. This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million in cost for studies, promotion, and other efforts.Then President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general. Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood ‚Äì both were forced to withdraw their names from consideration. Next she chose Janet Reno ‚Äì husband Bill described her selection as ‚Äúmy worst mistake.‚Äù Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.Husband Bill allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission. Lani Guanier was her selection. When a little probing led to the discovered of Ms. Guanier‚Äôs radical views, her name had to be withdrawn from consideration.Apparently a slow learner, husband Bill allowed Hillary to make some more recommendations. She chose former law partners Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department. Her selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kennedy was forced to resign.Many younger voters will have no knowledge of ‚ÄúTravelgate.‚Äù Hillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend Harry Thompson ‚Äì and the White House Travel Office refused to comply. She managed to have them reported to the FBI and fired. This ruined their reputations, cost them their jobs, and caused a thirty-six month investigation. Only one employee, Billy Dale was charged with a crime, and that of the enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds. A jury acquitted him of any crime in less than two hoursStill not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House security. When Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies (Filegate) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff, suddenly Hillary and the president denied even knowing Livingstone, and of course, denied knowledge of drug use in the White House. Following this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents.Next, when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by Bill Clinton, Hillary was put in charge of the ‚Äúbimbo eruption‚Äù and scandal defense. Some of her more notable decisions in the debacle were:¬∑ She urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation they settled with Ms. Jones.¬∑ She refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor. After $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr‚Äôs investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs.¬∑ Hillary‚Äôs devious game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for lying under oath to a grand jury and then his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives.¬∑ Hillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, ‚ÄúI do not recall,‚Äù ‚ÄúI have no recollection,‚Äù and ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù a total of 56 times while under oath.¬∑ After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had stolen.Now we are exposed to: the destruction of possibly incriminating emails while Hillary was Secretary of State and the ‚Äúpay to play‚Äù schemes of the Clinton Foundation ‚Äì we have no idea what shoe will fall next. But to her loyal fans ‚Äì ‚Äúwhat difference does it make?‚Äù
17 | David Thorne | 62 | 10154771897816336_1109905812380572 | College electoral is lame. The presidency should not fall on certain states. Make it more fair. Make each state worth the same amount. The one with the most states wins. Then the people's voice will be heard
18 | Ashlee Pilkington | 55 | 10154771897816336_1253157904727978 | I have seen first hand how my 92 year old elderly grandfather's care is all messed up due to Obama care.

How dare anyone vote for Hilary. I am voting for Trump.

24 | Kit Hoffman | 39 | 10154771897816336_10154772179081336 | I find it strange that right this very minute crooked hillary is holding a rally in Michigan. In Michigan? Why is the demon rat candidate for president holding a rally in of all places Michigan the day before the election? Michigan hasn't been won by a Republican since the days of Ronald Reagan I wanna guess. Michigan is about blue of a demon rat , pro union socialist state as any state in the country...Why would her campaign feel the need to go there? Could it be desperation? And further more...All these polls keep saying she has a 2 or 3% lead nationally; ...Ok, well if that's true; wouldn't one think that a candidate that has spent their entire career as a politician serving in the Senate and Sec of State would have a much much bigger lead over a candidate that hasn't spent one single day of his career in public service?
25 | Lindley McNeilly | 51 | 10154771897816336_1109909395713547 | I'm British but right from the git go I have been vocal for Trump. I've helped were I could on Facebook and took many childish insults gladly but fired back with only the truth about Clinton. My hopes and prayers are with you all and may God bless you and yours and your beautiful great land. Make Trump your 45th President as I see him as the only hope to make your land great again as it should be.

We're in for an economic collapse within six months either way... however, with Trump we still have a chance for a quicker recovery. Voting for Trump/Pence tomorrow morning.

4 | Leo Decaj | 1026 | 10154771828331336_10154771853596336 | When you go to the polls on November 8th, remember this: Donald Trump is willing to spend millions of his own dollars on a movement to make America great again, while Hillary Clinton has spent the last 30 years selling out the American people for millions of dollars from foreign governments and special interests
5 | Dan Buress Sr. | 491 | 10154771828331336_10154771858211336 | Do not be distracted! Democrats want open borders, higher taxes, more "refugees" & illegals, weakened military & police, abolish the 2nd Amendment, Leftist judges, more BLM, and more islamic influence. THAT IS NOT A CHOICE!!!!! Trump/Pence 2016!

Because they dont like what Trump said 11 yrs ago?  we dont have to look very far to see what the real problem in America is.... Its us. We the people..
8 | Mike Conway | 249 | 10154771828331336_10154771855576336 | It doesnt matter...As the USA dies in front of us, helpless to do a thing because of the iron fist of corrupted power silencing what is good, moral and right. The rule of law and the constitution. The realization that this government is more corrupt than I already knew it to be...makes me feel and realize how helpless and hopeless we all are when confronted with this level of evil, power and corruption that is this government and that corrupt evil woman.
9 | Nick Adams | 128 | 10154771828331336_10154771862051336 | I honestly can't believe after all this, people are still with her.  We were.. But never again. I honestly believe most her voters, drink tap water too much, that government water got you sheeped up guys!
10 | Monica Maria Martinez | 74 | 10154771828331336_10154771873561336 | Any woman voting for Crooked Hillary needs certifying..She gets large donations to her foundation from countries where women have no rights & it's legal for their husbands to rape them..
11 | Christi Johnson | 46 | 10154771828331336_10154771881801336 | ‚ö†Ô∏èIf you are Gay, Why are you voting for Hillary when she wants to bring in thousands of refugees that believe all Gays should be executed?üëÅ‚ö†Ô∏èIf you are Black, Why are you voting for Hillary when she admires Margaret Sanger and defends Planned Parenthood who want to abort as many black babies as possible? Exterminate the black race because they are like "weeds". (Margaret Sanger quote) Most of those clinics are in Black neighborhoods.üëÅ‚ö†Ô∏èIf you are a Christian, Why are you voting for Hillary Clinton when she wrote her Senior thesis on Saul Alinsky who dedicated his book 'Rules for Radicals' to Lucifer (the Devil)? She says he was, and still is her mentor.üëÅ‚ö†Ô∏èIf you are a Veteran, in the Military, or closely related to a Military member, Why are you voting for Hillary when she left those men to die in Benghazi and had the nerve to lie about it over and over again? They called for help but the help was told to stand down.üëÅ‚ö†Ô∏èIf you have a factory job, Why are you voting for Hillary when she supported TPP? Factory workers are being laid off because jobs are going over seas. Don't forget the deals she's made with china. She also welcomes open borders and illegals to get benefits to be paid with Your tax money.üëÅ‚ö†Ô∏èIf you are poor, Why are you voting for Hillary, when she is supporting Wall street and all the big banks? Big banks keep poor people poor by destroying the poor man's credit by allowing medical bills and collections to affect your credit scores so you can pay higher interest rates than the rich; Taking much of the little money you earn.üëÅ‚ö†Ô∏èIf you are a Woman, how can you vote for Hillary when she has buried all of Bills rape victims under the rug, including that little girl that was raped? Lawyer Hillary defended the rapist, and then she laughed about it later, knowing that he was guilty.If you carry a gun, or believe in the Constitution; How can you vote for Hillary when she wants to eliminate the NRA, Take your guns, and abolish the second Amendment?üëÅ‚ö†Ô∏èIf you breathe, Why would you vote for Hillary when she and the Clinton crime family have left a trail of dead people that did not agree with her, or they knew too much?Who is left? üëÅ
12 | Yogi Kesl | 66 | 10154771828331336_10154771867081336 | The corrupt government wants Hillary in office. They have spent so much time and money covering up for her. To me this has been the worse election. God help us all if she gets into office
13 | Ashley Givens | 34 | 10154771828331336_10154771872376336 | This is nothing new. We KNOW she is guilty as sin. The problem is, her supporters don't care. They will vote for her just because they hate Trump. And the people who have the authority to do something about it simply won't for either fear of their lives or fear of losing their jobs, who knows. This woman is like a bad penny. She will never go away. Let's just hope and pray we can keep her OUT of our White House.
14 | Joao Lucas | 71 | 10154771828331336_10154771854406336 | I love coming here to read the comments. Some people (like myself at times) are obsessed with reading comments. For example, we find you reading this comment right now, which does not contain any useful information, only curiosity, that drives you to waste your time. Have a good day.
15 | Todd Coconato | 26 | 10154771828331336_10154771880696336 | What we now know about HRC and why this is the most important election of our lifetime:1. Hillary Clinton mishandled and was extremely careless with top secret emails that she sent to, and dialogued with, POTUS, Huma Abedin, and countless others via a private server. This is illegal. 2. HRC received large donations via the Clinton foundation and also to her campaign from foreign governments that are the same governments that have been funding and arming ISIS. She has also been linked to these country's in dealing with arms sales. (The largest in US history to Saudi Arabia).3. HRC gave 20% of US uranium to Russia (through uranium one), and has been part of a foreign policy that has reduced our military to pre-world war two levels of readiness and reduced our nuclear arsenal to 30 year lows-all the while putting us into the worst relations with Russia since the Cold War period. 4. Hillary's right hand woman-Huma Abedin is associated closely with the Muslim Brotherhood. Her campaign manager Podesta has been connected with occult rituals (via Wikileaks to a "spirit dinner") and also has a picture in his office of two men eating another man! He also has been linked to countless illegal dealings via the "Podesta files" Wikileaks document dump operations. Her two mentors, senator Byrd and Saul Alinskey are deep into the occult as well-Byrd was a former "Exalted Cyclops" of the KKK and Saul Alinskey dedicated his book "rules for radicals" to Lucifer! 5. Through Wikileaks, we have learned that Clinton was involved in several significant pay-to-play schemes with foreign governments and elites. This is an act of treason and violates US law for an elected and/or government official. 6. We now know that the Clinton foundation held 90% of its donations/ charitable earnings and only gave out 10% to the appropriate charities. (I.e Haiti) 7. In the 90s the Clintons were connected to giving China "most favored nation status" which led to the biggest transfer of wealth in the history of the world from the west to the east.8. HRC was an original architect of the current health care system (Hillary care) and wants to further this process to a single payer system which would collapse our system. She is also in favor of one of the biggest tax hikes in the history of our nation. Through additional promised entitlements and benefits to illegals, each American would have around a 6% increase in income tax. 9. There are 44 people around the Clintons that have died mysteriously. 10. Hillary Clinton wants Christians to "re-learn" our beliefs (change them) to embrace her far leftist and occultist views. She will further limit and restrict freedom of speech and religion.11. HRC stands for partial birth abortion-the most radical and inhumane practice of abortion where the babies crown is stabbed and vacuumed out of a mothers womb-only weeks out for the birth cycle date. 12. HRC is for a "global government"-one without borders. Her biggest donors, such as elitist George Soros, have influenced nation states around the world through the funding of billions of dollars of dealings with opposition factions. This is used to topple governments and place puppet regimes in place so that he can use policy control to further his globalist agenda. 13. The Clintons have been to Epstein's sex orgy island (an island that houses underage victims of the sex trade industry) multiple times according to outed flight logs. HRC has personally been there 6 times and her husband 26 times. 14. She lied to the FBI on multiple occasions. A felony. 15. Got debate questions ahead of time and didn't turn them down, but used it to her advantage! 16. She was in favor of NAFTA and is in favor of the TPP-calling it the "gold standard" and has openly admired to having a public and private policy which leans toward the banking elites. NAFTA is responsible for the loss of hundreds of thousands of American jobs and the economic devastation it has caused is still being felt today. America has lost its ability to be a bustling manufacturing hub and is now reduced to a "service economy". 17. Hillary Clinton will appoint the most liberal judges to the Supreme Court which will alter the course of this nation for the next 50 plus years. 18. Under HRC, more than 20000000 illegals will flood into our country in the next few years. 19. HRC wants to increase the amount of Syrian refugees by several hundred thousand. These are unvetted people and can be a "Trojan horse" for incoming terrorists infiltrating our national borders. 20. HRC supports nations that are hostile to women and homosexuals. Sharia law actually permits killings gays and throwing them off of buildings. These are her biggest foreign donors-muslims and Muslim states such as Saudi Arabia. Woman in these nations have no rights and are a lower class in society than men. I could go on and on, but really people??? How can you vote for this woman?? If you can think of more, add them below!!!
16 | Kat Picanco | 19 | 10154771828331336_10154771868911336 | THE ROWBOAT COMES FOR YOU.....This may be the best and most honest political promotion statement you will ever read.  It decidedly does not brush objections aside.  You hate Hillary?  READ it.  You hate Trump?  READ it.  You think there's no choice?  READ it.  And, read it with your grown-up hat on.  We've all been dealt huge responsibility with this election.  The first step toward accepting responsibility is accepting it, and the first step toward accepting it is recognizing it.  READ THIS.  Read every single word.  It'll take you about three minutes.  Be sure to read to the end (take a few minutes and read all of it!)Are you sickened and despondent with the current campaign and upcoming presidential election?I consider myself a conservative and do truly believe our country is at a political/economic/moral/ social crossroads. I need to let you know I could/would never vote for Hillary Clinton to lead this country.  To me, she represents everything that is wrong with our current political structure.  On the flip side, I look and listen to Donald Trump and I cringe at every rude, insulting comment he makes.If you find yourself in a similar state of mind, please read the following article:A Message For Christians About Donald TrumpHere's a famous joke about God and how he talks to us."A deeply faithful Christian man is stuck on roof at home with massive flooding up to the 2nd floor. Rowboat comes. He says "No, I'm waiting for God. I prayed and I know he's coming."  2nd Rowboat. "No, I'm waiting for God." 3rd Rowboat. "No, I'm waiting for God."Water rises. The man drowns. Now he's meeting God in heaven. The religious man says, "Where were you God? I prayed. I was faithful. I asked you to save me. Why would you abandon me?"God says, "Hey, I sent you 3 rowboats."Did you ever consider Trump is our rowboat?Maybe God is trying to tell us something important--that now is not the time for a "nice Christian guy" or a "gentleman" or a typical Republican powder puff. Maybe now is the time for a natural born killer, a ruthless fighter, a warrior. Because right about now we need a miracle, or America is finished. Maybe the rules of gentlemen don't apply here. Maybe a gentleman and "all-around nice Christian" would lead us to slaughter.Or do you want another Mitt Romney, Bob Dole, John McCain, Gerald Ford or Paul Ryan? Did any of them win? Did they lead the GOP to "the promised land?" Did they change the direction of America ? No, because if you don't win, you have no say.Paul Ryan couldn't even deliver his own state, Wisconsin ! And as leader of the House, Paul Ryan rolls over to Obama like my dog rolls over for a scrap of food, or a steak bone.  Nice, but obedient. I mean Paul Ryan...not my dog. My dog is actually a pretty good defender and loyal.Maybe God is knocking on your door loudly, but you're not listening. Maybe God understands we need a "war leader" at this moment in time. Maybe God understands if we don't win this election, America is dead. It's over. The greatest nation in world history will be gone. Finished. Kaput. Adios.And with one last breath, maybe what we need to save us at the last second, is someone different. Someone you haven't ever experienced before-- because you weren't raised in rough and tumble New York where nothing good gets accomplished unless you're combative, aggressive, outrageous, on offense at all times, and maybe just a tad arrogant too.Someone with a personality you've never seen on stage at your church. Maybe, just maybe, being a nice gentlemanly Christian would not beat Hillary and her billion dollars, and her best friends in the media who will unleash the dogs of hell upon the GOP nominee.I guess you think God is only nice and gentlemanly. Really? Then you've missed the whole point of the Bible. When necessary, God is pretty tough. When necessary, God strikes with pain, death and destruction. When necessary, God inflicts vengeance.Maybe you think God couldn't possibly be associated with someone like Trump. Trump is too vicious, rude and crude.When we won WWII, was God "nice?" Were we gentlemanly when defeating Hitler? Were we gentlemanly when firebombing Germany? Were we gentlemanly when dropping atomic bombs on Japan ? Is God ever "nice" on the battlefield? Or does he send us vicious SOB's like General George S. Patton so the good guys can defeat evil?It's pretty clear to me God sends unique people to be "war leaders." That's a different role than a pastor or church leader. God understands that.And maybe it's time to re-define "nice." Maybe Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan aren't nice at all--because they led us to defeat. And losing again would mean the end of America . And God can't allow that. Maybe Romney and Ryan mean well, but the road to hell is paved with good intentions. Or maybe they're just jealous they had their chance and blew it. Maybe they'd rather help elect Hillary than allow a Trump victory that would make them look weak, feckless and incompetent."Even the youths shall faint and be weary, And the young men shall utterly fall, But those who wait on the Lord shall renew their strength; They shall mount up with wings like eagles, They shall run and not be weary, They shall walk and not faint." (Isiah 40:30-31)God is about miracles. We don't need a "nice guy" or a "gentleman" right now. It's the 4th quarter and we're losing 14-0. We need a miracle.So let me repeat my message to Christians: "YOU'RE MISSING THE BOAT."I believe Trump is our miracle. I believe Trump is our rowboat. Except he's more like a battleship!No one is saying Trump is perfect. No one is saying Trump is a perfect conservative. But he is a patriot. He is a warrior. He is a capitalist. He is the right man, at the right time.  Yes, he's a bit rude and crude and offensive. But that may make him the perfect warrior to save America , American exceptionalism, capitalism and Judeo-Christian values. The choice should be easy for Christians.It's Trump...or it's the end of the American dream.If anything in this article strikes a positive chord with you, please pass it on.
17 | Ellie Lantz | 16 | 10154771828331336_10154771872136336 | The sad fact is that the Republican and Democrat Congress people and Senators that you elected to represent your best interests in this government know these facts very well but have behaved like ignorant fools throughout all the worthless hearings and revelations of wrong doing! Some may wave their finger and lash out in public as a pretence but have no intention of holding anyone n the Obama administration responsible for the corrupt criminal behavior throughout the past eight years!
18 | Melinda Hudson | 19 | 10154771828331336_10154771867346336 | How can she keep getting away with everything. Especially the emails and the Foundation. These are suppose to be smart men. Are they being paid off or what? This country has had enough of this corruption
19 | Danielle M Varela | 13 | 10154771828331336_575937609273936 | So...I just called the campaign center for Hillary Clinton..."Hillary for America" (info from my voter information pamphlet) and asked when she was going to be indicted for all of the felonies she's committed. "She will not be, but thank you for your interest." is the answer I got before being hung up on. Then it occurred to me: let's all call them. Let's all inundate them with phone calls expressing our concerns for her as president. Let's flood the phone line. Want to join me? My next phone call is going to ask what her plans are for unborn women and what does she do to support and champion for them?(646-854-1432) post your results in the comments
20 | Danielle Dupee | 10 | 10154771828331336_10154771880606336 | My mom couldn't have a phone with a camera when she worked as a contractor for the Navy due to security risks, and even then it wasn't allowed to be on for the same reasons stated in this article.  Clinton's double standard simply blows my mind.
21 | Kathy Walsh | 9 | 10154771828331336_10154771885636336 | The FBI, I'm sure, has been 'informed" on what they are to say. Comey just didn't decide to reinvestigate, to then turn around and say nothing has changed! Cmon people,  we know who's running this show. Please get out & vote if you want America to be great again!!
22 | Joe Willis | 6 | 10154771828331336_1152723871481675 | Trump Supporters say:1-Bill Clinton cheats on his wife. Impeach him. Trump proudly brags about sexual assault (and has cheated on his wives). Elect him. 2-Hillary oversaw the department of state while 4 people died in an embassy attack. Put her in jail. Republicans were in office while over 200 people died in embassy attacks. No problem. 3-Immigrants don't pay taxes. Round them up and kick them out. Trump doesn't pay taxes. He's a business genius. 4-Hillary's foundation only spent 87% of their donations helping people. She's a crook. Trumps foundation paid off his debts, bought sculptures of him, and made political donations to avoid investigations while using less than 5% of funds for charity (and he got shut down by NY State). So savvy... Put him in the white house. 5-Trump made 4 billion dollars in 40 years, when an index fund started at the same time with the same "small loans" he received would be worth $12 billion today... without a trail of bankruptcies, thousands of lawsuits and burned small business owners. He's a real business whiz.6-Hillary took a loss of $700k. She's a criminal. Trump is the first candidate in the modern era not to release his tax returns, and took a billion dollar loss in 1 year. Genius. 7-Hillary takes responsibility for private email servers and apologizes. Not credible.Trump denies saying things (on the record) he actually said (on the record), he's just telling it like it is.8-Hillary has helped pass 287 bills that support our vets. She hates vetsTrump attacks war heroes who were POWs or the families of persons who have given there lives for their country. He supports our troops and vets.9.Trump got five draft deferments to avoid serving while other brave American went and fought. He has done great service for our country-OTHER FACTS THEY DONT WANT YOU TO KNOW-Trump Casinos‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..FailedTrump Mortgage‚Ä¶...FailedTrump University‚Ä¶.FailedTrump Vodka‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶....FailedChina connection‚Ä¶.FailedBankruptcies‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..FourIllegal alien female escort (prostitutes to you Christians),turned into a wife,1 so far (his 3rd wife)Trump clothing & deluxe hats, made in china & AsiaTrump‚Äôs daughters clothing line, made in AsiaAnd for law and order:Child rape allegations, with legal action pending3500 lawsuits against himUpcoming trail for fraudDoesn‚Äôt pay most of his small business agreements Fails to pay employee‚ÄôsMob tiesRussian sympather (wouldn‚Äôt Joe McCarthy be proud)In debt to russia and chinaWhich is making America great how?So remind me again, what makes him such a ‚Äúwinner‚Äù?Trump Supporters Your arguments are thin. Your ignorance of reality is shocking. Your double-standards are offensive, and your willingness to blindly support TRUMP and recycle the rhetoric is absurd. Your opinion is not fact. Your memes are not news articles. And your hypocrisy is not a platform.TRUMP SHOULD NOT BE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
23 | Eileen Smithers | 7 | 10154771828331336_1867642243472874 | America is Fuked.How can someone run for President that lets Confidential e-mails out,lies and cant be trusted.Somebody Please answer that.Big Problem over there with sick people that Vote for her.
24 | Cheryl Worthington | 7 | 10154771828331336_1867641310139634 | Our National Security is and was at risk and Hillary Clinton is completely responsible. Hillary Clinton knowingly and consciously ignored policy and protocol and violated these rules and laws. Hillary Clinton should be facing prosecution!
25 | Chris Smith | 4 | 10154771828331336_1867648646805567 | Fox News propaganda again, come on smarten up people, no credibility here, contractors cant comment on their clients when national security is involved and why did they wait until the day before the election to speak dont worry, Hillary will be the President-Elect tomorrow night

1 | Grace Tuinstra | 6549 | 10154771761871336_10154771766716336 | Obama played his race card, Hillary's playing her woman card so Americans are now playing their Trump card #TrumpforPresident
2 | Kathy Manaro Braddock | 1755 | 10154771761871336_10154771775096336 | I'm all for a woman president someday, just not Hillary.  I would prefer a woman that was honest and had values that would make you proud to vote for her.
3 | Amaury Francisco Guerrero | 1842 | 10154771761871336_10154771764761336 | If you want more of the same, more people on food stamps, more disorder and chaos, more division among races, If you want the education system to continue going down, more intervention in other nations, If you want poverty to continue to grow, more violence and crime, more hatred against law enforcement and a lawless nation, If you want corporation to continue to control politicians, If you want politicians to continue making decision based on the interest of corporations instead of the people, If you want a hot war with Russia and China that lead to a full world war and the death of millions of people in the US, Europe, Asia and the Middle East, and If you want the US to continue being the laughing stock of the world, then all you need to do is vote for Hillary. However, if you want jobs, you love your country, your want law and order, you want a better future for your kids, you want the US to be respected again, you want peace, high wages, less foreign interference, a safer nation, better relations with other countries, less corruption and more transparency, then you need to vote for Trump. It's up to you!
4 | Le Brown James | 803 | 10154771761871336_10154771776656336 | Am In Africa, and i know that i should be minding Africa's Business, but we are counting on you guys. As we support you with prayers please please vote red tomorrow and send evil home
5 | Jill Stoddard | 994 | 10154771761871336_10154771790181336 | Gender has nothing to do with voting for a Democratic president. It's insulting that you would think that way. And what's more insulting is voting for a creep like Donald Trump just because you're Republican! It's embarrassing as an American that we would even consider a man like trump to be in the White House and put him has the highest ranking man in the world!! Yikes. We are laughing stock around the world because we have allowed such a disgusting human as Donald Trump to have gotten this far. That's what is insulting to our intelligence!!!!
6 | Dan Buress Sr. | 447 | 10154771761871336_10154771765956336 | Do not be distracted! Democrats want open borders, higher taxes, more "refugees" & illegals, weakened military & police, abolish the 2nd Amendment, Leftist judges, more BLM, and more islamic influence. THAT IS NOT A CHOICE!!!!! Trump/Pence 2016!
7 | Christopher Cook | 219 | 10154771761871336_10154771766206336 | Any woman voting for Crooked Hillary needs certifying..She gets large donations to her foundation from countries where women have no rights & it's legal for their husbands to rape them..
8 | Yvonne Clerebout | 239 | 10154771761871336_10154771764836336 | I get a chuckle out of the libtards thinking that the Hildebeast will win because the FBI closed one of the two cases they have her on. Trump voters outnumber the brain dead by millions. We got this! #spiritcooking #lolitaexpress #wikileaks #projectveritas #vincefoster #draintheswamp
9 | Elisabeth Morgan | 151 | 10154771761871336_10154771769726336 | The funny thing is that that is exactly why some women vote for Hillary Clinton. Some women just want a female president, they don't care what quality person they get as long as it is a female.
10 | Chris Suggs | 114 | 10154771761871336_10154771772211336 | If Obama couldn't unite everyone, what makes them think someone hated by 60% of America will unite us? If she wins there will be a civil war and possible military coup. So vote Hillary and start the war you fear
11 | Lynn Henderson Merker | 119 | 10154771761871336_10154771803331336 | And it is insulting to have your father-in-law speak the way he does about women, minorities, or any other person that may not agree with him! He's classless lady!
12 | Cindy Dixon Collins | 60 | 10154771761871336_10154771789371336 | Oh my goodness so glad Lanny Davis is bi-partisan, I'd hate to hear what a Democrat supporter would've said.  Looks like Fox is joining the rest of the media in trying to brainwash us.  I'm one white, educated, suburban woman who is still voting for Trump in spite of everything they're reporting.
13 | Rebecca K Hampton | 43 | 10154771761871336_1019568438165359 | I cannot believe there are so many stupid American women. Yes, I did say that. If you vote for someone just because their plumbing is the same as yours, your stupid.
14 | We stand with Israel | 79 | 10154771761871336_10154771797036336 | Here in Israel we support Donald J. Trump!  Finally a person who has what it takes to lead one of the greatest nations in the world.

16 | Diana Gould Burton | 50 | 10154771761871336_1019591318163071 | Voting for hillary clinton b/c she is a woman is like eating a turd b/c it looks like a tootsie roll.  clinton is an embarrassment to my gender. I think we need a woman in the WH one day, but it ain't her!!!!  I wouldn't spit on her if she were in flames.
17 | Lisa Black | 42 | 10154771761871336_785480268256640 | It's been amazing how many of my female acquaintances have tried to shame me into voting for Hillary simply because she is a woman. I don't recall their enthusiasm for a female VP eight years ago.
18 | Cheryl Guinn | 41 | 10154771761871336_592896714230201 | Not why I am voting for Hillary. I am voting for her due to her experience and her command of the issues. For Lara to say so that a woman would only vote for her due to gender is repulsive. Be proud of your gender Lara and start thinking for yourself. I got to say I am ashamed of your comment. Do the men only vote for other men because they are dudes. Your post is sad.
19 | Angie Sheffield | 50 | 10154771761871336_10154771784806336 | I am against Clinton for so many reasons but one thing I am against her is that she think it is right for women to have an abortion at 39 weeks I am so against abortions I can't even have kids and makes me mad that Clinton thinks it is right for abortions I am voting for Trump 100%
20 | Dawn Avila | 41 | 10154771761871336_10154771808856336 | I totally agree. I wouldn't mind a woman being President but I'm sorry, not her! She sets a bad example for a woman, much more a woman President! No thanks Hillary, we aren't that dumb.
21 | Diane Hughes | 29 | 10154771761871336_10154771804741336 | Yesterday I read an article on Facebook that explained what some democrats actually believe about Hillary. I had been wondering how anyone could even consider voting for a person who was such corrupt liar. This article went to great lengths to justify the unjustifiable‚Ä¶in short, democrats who support Hillary don‚Äôt believe she‚Äôs a corrupt liar! Can you imagine! Do they actually think the FBI is investigating her because they have nothing else to do? However, the article skewed and wove the information about Hillary in such a convoluted way, it made it look as though she was not guilty of any wrongdoing! I couldn‚Äôt believe intelligent people could possibly fall for such nonsense. However, it also became clear to me that some of Hillary‚Äôs supporters were not going to be convinced she was a corrupt liar; therefore, let‚Äôs forget about the fact that she used an illegal server while she was Secretary of State and jeopardized the security of the United States‚Ä¶and focus on the issues: Hillary is going to double-down on obamacare‚Äîand eventually probably make it a single-payer scheme where the government is in complete control of the health insurance of the American people. Hillary wants to raise our taxes and have more idiotic trade deals that favor the foreign country over the United States‚Äîcausing even more of our jobs to disappear. Perhaps the absolutely more terrifying thing is that Hillary wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees to come into the United States; and have open borders. This means anyone can come into our country; and law enforcement states the increased violence will be massive. We can‚Äôt know who‚Äôs coming into our country‚Äîterrorists, criminals, drugs, etc. I can‚Äôt imagine that any American would want that.On the other hand Donald Trump will reduce our taxes and many job-killing regulations. He‚Äôll eliminate the estate tax and reduce corporate taxes and simplify the tax code. He‚Äôll renegotiate trade agreements that were unfavorable to the United States and bring jobs back into this country. Donald Trump will protect the Second Amendment, treat our vets right, and fix our depleted military. He will replace the dreadful obamacare and have a secure border to keep us safe. Moreover, Hillary‚Äôs own campaign manager emailed that ‚ÄúHillary has begun to hate everyday Americans‚Äù. Donald Trump loves America.Surely even if you don‚Äôt accept that Hillary is a corrupt liar, you can see that Donald Trump‚Äôs plan for America is better for you and this great country than the policies of Hillary Clinton.
22 | Sandee Boyer | 21 | 10154771761871336_1813663435571943 | Amen on that, Hillary does not represent me or any of my friends, we have dignity, respect for others, we don't lie, cheat or surround ourselves with others that do. We aren't perfect but we don't intentionally try to do wrong. I'm ashamed of her and her adulterous husband, this whole situation is an insult to Americans.
23 | Michael Watson | 22 | 10154771761871336_10154771782576336 | There is no way on earth that Hillary can be in the lead anywhere with the agenda she's spewing. Vote Hillary if you want, but don't you dare complian when this country falls into chaos.
24 | Tracy Pendleton Valenzuela | 24 | 10154771761871336_785486284922705 | Yes, she is female. And that's no reason to vote for her! HRC is not for women. Her female employees are paid less than men. She has destroyed the lives of many women. She just thinks women are more easily controlled and can't think for theirselves and therefore preys on them for votes. Trump pays his female employees higher salaries. Just look at both campaign managers.
25 | Terry Duffy | 30 | 10154771761871336_1019585008163702 | I have no problems with a woman..but for the love of god this woman cannot be it. Granted I'm voting Trump but people, wake up you don't vote for president based on color, race or gender. Clinton is way to corrupt
