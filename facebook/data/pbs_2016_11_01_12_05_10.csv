Heroin and opioid addiction is at a nationwide peak — the CDC reports 78 Americans die from a drug overdose every day.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Ian Frowner | 4 | 10154722486008675_10154722519333675 | Yeah, and there's some nice big fat juicy opium poppies just waiting to be converted to heroin and shipped express into this country. It's sad, but true. So far, the war on drugs has failed.
2 | Audra Alley | 4 | 10154722486008675_10154722495863675 | When it comes to opiate addiction it's one of the hardest ones for insurances to want to help cover. I know a man who calls it his passionate fight, due to all the one who need the help the most. And I hope insurances change certain policies so everyone with addiction can be treated equally!
3 | Paul Jackson | 0 | 10154722486008675_10154722531108675 | Bring back the War on Drugs with the Donald. The previous Drug Warriors were all stupid. Trump is a master. He will build a wall and the Mexicans will pay for it(what ever happened to that?). That will stop those pesky opiates. Clinton had 30 years to stop the drugs and she didn't do anything. Trump will waterboard the drug dealers and worse, just you wait and see. </sarcasm>
4 | Karyla De Long Mancini | 0 | 10154722486008675_10154722581983675 | Actually Hillary has spoke about this & her platform is for more treatment ctr, which we need, war on drugs has never worked, we buy it & want it, but a lot of these kids r shooting up pills
5 | Bryan Evans | 1 | 10154722486008675_10154722493698675 | They probably stand where it's most profitable.  That would be treating addictive personality disorder with prison. Unfortunately you can't really ask them, you'll just have to watch what they do.  None of them do what they say anymore.
6 | Maria Saldana | 0 | 10154722486008675_10154722547723675 | Afghanistan brings good profits... more addicts , more money. Bill made a tidy bundle off the Mexican cocaine cartels..Central America is most lucrative. Hildebeest and Atty. Yzaguirre have a nice little deal going.. he represents Gulf Cartel  Bosses... and , well... they go home in no time.
7 | Stephanie Jo McSmith | 2 | 10154722486008675_10154722515643675 | This and many other reason why she should be our next president.Hillary has my vote.

9 | Jennifer Skidmore | 0 | 10154722486008675_10154722523183675 | Very thorough breakdown of each candidate's open stances.
10 | Angel Nardone | 0 | 10154722486008675_10154722501898675 | They stand where th all mighty Buck is..... Much more profitable to keep people sick and doped up. It's shameful
11 | Dianne Bohannan | 1 | 10154722486008675_10154722553548675 | Mental health facilities need to be reopened as Clinton said she would do
12 | John Draper | 1 | 10154722486008675_10154722489653675 | A reason for many families why border security is so important.
13 | Dolores DiBiase | 1 | 10154722486008675_10154722492018675 | We need evidence-based treatment centers and for profit outfits out of the picture.  Good luck with that.
14 | Ricardo Salinas | 0 | 10154722486008675_10154722519123675 | Now that it has entered into the white population, suddenly everyone CARES.

19 | Elizabeth Kellogg | 0 | 10154722486008675_10154722544923675 | Another side effect of money in politics right here folks.  Look closely at what this is doing to our people in many different ways.

House Speaker Paul Ryan said Tuesday on Fox News’ “Fox and Friends” that he used early voting to cast his ballot for the Republican presidential nominee last week.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Rocky RS | 70 | 10154722340738675_10154722380998675 | Way to stick up for ur principles there Ryan, after u personally called Trump's comments racist and how despicable u thought he was toward his comments on women implying sexual assault. Really showing ur kids there how to stand by ur principles and values
2 | Maria Gaffney | 32 | 10154722340738675_10154722390448675 | It's hard for me to look at this vile man as he knows Trump is incompetent and dangerous and yet he's voting for him. He knows and he's done nothing about it.
3 | Mark L. Wagner | 16 | 10154722340738675_10154722378803675 | Did he comment on the disgusting fans at the Wisconsin-Nebraska game? Not the perpetrators , but the fans that cheered them on. I guess not. This man has no principles.
4 | Jeff Clark | 14 | 10154722340738675_10154722438923675 | What t hypocrite - obviously Party means everything to him - he plays the games, lies just like the rest of them ( they have some nerve talking about "lying Hillary") and he has no scruples which comes as no surprise
5 | Christine Turple | 14 | 10154722340738675_10154722473113675 | Party before the People. Shame on Paul Ryan. He knows Trump is a disaster, but he votes for him anyway so he can keep his job. VOTE BLUE and get rid of these self-centered politihacks.
6 | Denzil P Walker | 6 | 10154722340738675_10154722488788675 | What a hypocritical weasel? But really, is that surprising as lots his ilk will always put party before country, all in an effort to grab the Presidency. How did he explain that to his wife, and daughter? #voteblue
7 | Taylor May | 10 | 10154722340738675_10154722375918675 | Drew Gibbs "I voted for him but I don't like him and I won't campaign with him" Boo, the damage is done. Shoulda wrote someone else in! Dingbat
8 | Marta Goodman | 3 | 10154722340738675_10154722545328675 | I remember him saying earlier in the campaign that his voting must consider his daughters. He has to look them in the eye, and know he did the right thing. Well, Paul Ryan, you are just as corrupt as the rest of your party. You just sold your daughters to a pussy-grabber! Good job!
9 | Gina Words | 7 | 10154722340738675_10154722388233675 | Ryan knows trump record! Ryan  knows trump is unprepared, unfit and not willing to manage himself to think outside the trump bubble! GOP owns trump's , temperament and failures! No walk backs! No excuses! Man Up!
10 | Corinne Starr | 1 | 10154722340738675_10154722450848675 | A sign that the R party will morph totally into Tea Party/Trumpism instead of splitting. They would have no control over Trump as president, so they delude themselves.certainly he is a toady and a man with no principles.
11 | Jules VanderMeer | 1 | 10154722340738675_10154722565163675 | How convenient for him supporting Trump because of new info on Clinton emails.. now because he thinks trump will win . This not about ethics or even morals. Paul doesn't have any amount of integrity in his character . He's just another double talking scumbag opportunist!
12 | Elaine Oswald | 3 | 10154722340738675_10154722436943675 | Absolutely no backbone!!!!!  Maybe instead of being House Speaker you should have attended What's A Matter U!!!! (Of course, they probably wouldn't even have waned you on their football team).
13 | Garlena Strange | 3 | 10154722340738675_10154722441493675 | You can't have it both way, you just spit in the eyes of responsible people, especially veterans and women and the country and constitution ! Sold your soul mister! Just like Pence.
14 | JC Segura | 0 | 10154722340738675_10154722533528675 | Thought this guys was the future of the GOP. Guess not....If Trump does not win this will haunt all the future GOP that supported him. Especially when we finally see more of the racist videos and audios from Trump along with his tax returns! I really kind of liked you Ryan ...but as a true American I look at character first and experience ...not all the hoopla of emails. Trump had the right approach that things needed change but to use racism and fear ...thats completely not American. Well lets hope Trumps for your sake!
15 | Cindy Morgan | 5 | 10154722340738675_10154722439458675 | I'm pretty sure this kind of unprincipled action was described in Dante's circles of hell. If your not willing to say you support the man that leads to two questions: 1) Why the hell are you voting for him? 2) Why the hell would you tell anyone you voted for him?This guy is a schmuck.
16 | Dewey Benson | 18 | 10154722340738675_10154722368908675 | Won't endorse the nutcase but votes for him... Too dumb to be speaker of the house.
17 | Katherine Peraza | 24 | 10154722340738675_10154722344493675 | This guy (I can't even lower myself to call him a man) is a repulsive individual who has played and continues to play on the emotions of all Americans and make a mockery of our institutions and constitution... I cannot allow myself to ever vote for someone so despicable. PERIOD!Unfortunately for Trump,  AMERICA IS DOING BETTER THAN EVER. RECORD unemployment numbers, legalized gay marriage, 5% growth, best year for jobs since 1999, consumer confidence up, deficit down 60% in 2014, gas prices low, health insurance cheaper than ever ($85/month), car insurance cheaper than ever ($25 per month from Insurance Panda), the 1% starting to be taxed more!It turns out that Obama is indeed “the adult in the room,” and yes, the Chess Master. Hillary will keep it going, any republican will screw it up. Simple as that.
18 | Ken Rucker | 15 | 10154722340738675_10154722363868675 | Republican first, American second ... or third ...or forth ... or whatever.
19 | Mark Dave | 1 | 10154722340738675_10154722378538675 | I bet if had to look at anyone dead straight to eye he wouldn't be able to say it, I can say I voted for whomever, who was there?
20 | Ann Schwartz | 0 | 10154722340738675_10154722444868675 | It's worse than being a hypocrite!  His policy ideas are from Ayn Rand's novels, he thinks he's better than all of us by virtue of his high opinion of himself. He believes he shouldn't be obligated to pay for the social constructs we've all agreed to as part of our society. He believes they should be defunded and privatized. Screw the poor, they deserve it! He's a dispicable waste of space in the House of Representives!
21 | Lynn Kowalewski | 6 | 10154722340738675_10154722385228675 | Party before country, right, Ryan? Coward and Hypocrite of the House.
22 | Andrew W Johnson | 4 | 10154722340738675_10154722435543675 | Spineless. The Republicans have no leadership. Get ready for 4 to 8 years of another "Do Nothing Congress" unless the Democrats win enough seats.
23 | Sylvia Berman | 3 | 10154722340738675_10154722405763675 | I have now lost all respect for Paul Ryan. This is not how you lead.
24 | Linda Kellison Jaeger | 3 | 10154722340738675_10154722455303675 | Ooops I never saw him as ethical anyway. No surprise here. I'm sure Cruz is right behind him.
25 | Sandy Wallace | 4 | 10154722340738675_10154722416713675 | I could never vote for this man who has no moral center.

1 | Melanie Moser | 1 | 10154720306438675_10154722532793675 | Only sick selfish ignorant people will take this tactic in this election. Your foolish action could put the entire world in peril. Get a grip. You can work for the next four years on electing a third party candidate and revising the past-post system to be all inclusive. This kind of action just shows how lazy and self-absorbed you are.

3 | Bryan Chris | 0 | 10154720306438675_10154722585153675 | This entire article is about attacking the write in movement for Bernie Sanders, and they don't mention it once. You can tell as much about someone's intentions by what they don't say as by what they do say. You guys just don't get it. Some Americans are unwilling to vote for the evil, no matter how lesser it may be. Some of us want to have a clean conscience going forward. You can cast your fear-based vote for a woman who won't stand with the Sioux, will stand with banks, and is only barely superior to the lunatic on the right, but a few of us just aren't going to allow your fear to rule our hearts. Enjoy your corporate republican candidate all you want. When she continues the wars, piles on the debt and keeps none of her promises, you will only have yourselves to blame.

10 | Rick Steinhausen | 0 | 10154720306438675_10154722410278675 | 75 % of the people say we are on the wrong track. Wiki leaks have honored the people the right to know. We all keep seeing how much corruption comes out every day and the media keeps covering it up. Main Street Media to the Hillary supporter ignore all of Hillary’s Lies, Scandals, And Corruption, and Go Vote for Her then say Yes Master. Hillary is like the bully on the school yard that picks on the week and the naïve. She is willing to say anything and do anything to keep the money coming in to the Bill Clinton Inc. She has to use the power of the office to pardon herself and keep the corruption going on.   We have to look at all the women out of work, all the women that live in poor house, All Hillary is going is throw them under the bus after she gets their vote. Hillary has never able to pass the New York bar exam. Let’s talk about borders, if you cross the border illegally in Canada you get a $5000 fine, if you cross the border illegally in Iran you get 8 years in prison, if you cross the border illegally in North Korea you get shot, if you cross the border in Mexico illegally they have no hesitation in throwing you in jail, If you cross the border illegally in the U.S. you get a Drivers License, Medical Insurance, Housing, Career Training, the right to Vote. Obama care/Hillary care, Pennsylvania 53% increase, Arizona 116% increase, Minnesota 59% increase, Florida 20% increase, North Carolina 40% increase. Hillary has corrupted the FBI and the DOJ where we cannot trust them. She wants to fix the laws to her advantage not the American people will take it in the shorts again. If the people don’t want to take our country back then vote for Hillary is a vote for world war 3 with the Russia. There will a lot of good honest men and women black, white, Mexican; Cubans will die in a horrible and bloody death. This will come for years to come. FBI Reopening Investigation into Clintons E-mails.Hey it is the drip, drip, drip, she thinks she is untouchable. Let’s see how she and her staff cover this up with their B.S. The bad thing about the Clintons is they don’t have any moral values towards anyone except for the power. Weiner hands laptop over to FBI as Clinton keeps her distance. And you wonder why other countries don’t trust us. Hillary’s diehard supporters are like Christmas Light half don’t work and the other half aren’t very bright. It is time to drain the swamp.

Since so many immigrants here have friends and family who benefit from amnesty, they vote and support Democrat.Democrats have openly called for Amnesty and other immigration reform.Calling for amnesty or reform during election is trading favors for votes.The US Constitution and Electoral Laws are against trading for votes during elections.Every Democrat #HISPANIC VOTE# must be suspect due to Democrats enticing the ethnic group unlawfully by offering consessions during elections 2016.Inviting foreigners to America during Presidential Election by Presidential Candidate is unlawfully enhancing the right to vote by inducing voters to vote Democrat through duress under the guise of illegal but made legal, Amnesty

How much of an effect is the FBI news having on the last days of the presidential race?
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Michele A Wilcox | 127 | 10154720630668675_10154721168723675 | I already voted for Hillary. I don't give a rip about emails that proved absolutely nothing. To keep regurgitating this garbage over and over again is pretty asinine.
2 | RL Grimm | 75 | 10154720630668675_10154721080453675 | Even though Trump has no experience in actual political work, painfully obviously so, we have to look at his past and critically scrutinize it as much as the other side has been. Also, I’m sorry but not having experience in the political arena isn’t a plus for Trump, if anything it’s a staunch warning as to how he will handle things as POTUS. Like it or not experience means a lot in the world. We don’t tend to trust people with little to no experience in a lot of aspects of our lives. We don’t want someone to prepare our taxes that hasn’t ever prepared and filed one for themselves. We wouldn’t want someone to build us a house that never built one before. We wouldn’t want a doctor who has never been to medical school to give us medical advice. We wouldn’t want to follow a military grunt into combat with no combat experience compared to a battle hardened marine with five years experience in active combat. We tend to trust those with experience over those with little or none, especially ones that have made mistakes because they have learned the ins and outs of the job at hand. That being said, can a person make mistakes that have severe consequences? The answer is yes and can ruin everything in their life. Since you seem to think the mistakes that Hillary has made should ruin everything in her life then we should look at Trump’s record in the same scrutiny.Donald Trump has been married three times. His first marriage was in 1977, to Czech born Ivana Zelníčková, who said in their divorce deposition that Donald had 'raped' her. She later clarified that she meant she felt violated, not that he had raped her in a 'legal' sense. Though, Ivana described a harrowing scene in which Trump held her arms back, pulled at her hair, and raped her in a fit of rage. She herself used the word “rape.” The details of the incident were made public in the 1993 book Lost Tycoon. Trump denies this incident took place, and before the book hit shelves his lawyers required that it include a statement at the front written by Ivana, in which she walks back her use of the word “rape.”During his marriage to Ivana, Trump had an affair with Marla Maples, who he married in 1993, after Maples gave birth to their daughter.In 1998 Trump began his relationship with his third and current wife Melania. The pair got married in 2005. Now let’s look at the things Trump has said and done so we can get a sense of what this man stands for. Another accusation of sexual assault comes from a 1997 lawsuit. Jill Harth says she and her romantic partner were working with Trump on a business deal, when The Donald started making unwelcome sexual advances. In a lawsuit filed against Trump, she says he leered at her inappropriately, groped her on several occasions without her consent, and even “attempted rape.”Trump denies any of this ever happened, calling the allegations “meritless.” While Harth withdrew her lawsuit shortly after Trump settled a separate lawsuit with her romantic partner over a business matter, she stands by her claims. (Harth and Trump had a cordial relationship until recently, when the allegations resurfaced and he denied them. At that point, according to The Guardian, Harth decided to speak out.) She also says Trump’s camp has contacted her on several occasions in an attempt to make her change her story and deny it ever happened. “I said I’m not doing that,” she told The Guardian.The newest case against Trump comes via a recent federal lawsuit filed in June 2016 in the State of New York by “Jane Doe.” In the suit, Doe alleges that Trump raped her back in 1994, when she was just 13 years old. According to legal docs, Doe says she attended parties with Trump and his friend Jeffrey Epstein—a registered sex offender known in the media as the “billionaire pedophile.” Doe, who was trying to become a model, says it was during these parties that Trump initiated sexual contact with her on several occasions and on one occasion allegedly raped her. According to the suit, Trump tied her to a bed, exposed himself to her and then raped her in a “savage sexual attack.” Doe says she screamed for him to stop at which point he struck her in the face while screaming “that he would do whatever he wanted.” In a statement filed with the lawsuit, Doe says Trump threatened to ruin her life and her family’s life if she ever told anyone about the incident. The lawsuit also includes a witness statement from a “Tiffany Doe,” who says that, in the ’90s, she was in charge of recruiting adolescent women to entertain guests at Epstein’s parties—and she personally saw the incident occur. I personally witnessed the Plaintiff being forced to perform various sexual acts with Donald J. Trump and Mr. Epstein. Both Mr. Trump and Mr. Epstein were advised that she was 13 years old. In her statement, Tiffany Doe also says she witnessed Trump force other minors to perform oral sex on him and witnessed his “physical abuse” on them “when they finished the act.” According to documents, Trump has denied the allegations, stating “These allegations are not only categorically false, but disgusting at the highest level and clearly framed to solicit media attention or, perhaps, are simply politically motivated. There is absolutely no merit to these allegations. Period.”A 1994 episode of Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous in which Trump Speculated about his one-year-old daughter’s future breasts when Robin Leach asked Trump and his then-wife Marla Maples what attributes their infant daughter inherited from her parents.In 2006, Donald Trump and daughter Ivanka appeared on ABC’s “The View” to promote their TV show “The Apprentice.” He said, “If Ivanka weren’t my daughter, perhaps I’d be dating her.”1997 Trump publicly shamed a Miss Universe winner, Alicia Machado, for gaining weightIn 1997, Temple Taggart, Miss Utah told the Times “He kissed me directly on the lips. I thought, 'Oh my God, gross. He was married to Marla Maples at the time. I think there were a few other girls that he kissed on the mouth. I was like 'Wow, that's inappropriate.”There is a hell of a lot more but you get the picture. I really get tired of the crap that we should vote for Trump without vetting him because he isn’t a politician and that wouldn’t be fair. We should just blindly follow Trump because the other side is so much worse is asinine. Why is deflecting an answer? Why can’t Trump stand on his own policies and merits? I’m not a fan of Hillary but I will be voting for her over Trump in the hopes we will have a better candidate running in four years that we all can vote for.

People are so sick of drumpf - his false accusations, his unprincipled ways, his cruel nature, his bombastic personality, his narcissistic show boating every chance he gets. We're so tired of this Wiki guy, and appalled that Russia would be able to infiltrate and disrupt our election process, and we can't help but continue to question what the connection is that Trump claimed, and then denied, between himself and Russia? And on top of that - to have the head of the FBI purposely throw himself into the middle of this extremely important election 10 days before the election - unbelievable!! - where's the integrity? We want to go on with our lives - we want to forego the daily chaos. We long for some peace and quiet.

Do your investigation the first time in an efficient manner and then we don't have these issues later on. How in-depth are they? 4 tries at getting someone!

7 | Nasreen Akbar | 24 | 10154720630668675_10154721313293675 | This absolutely fascinates me that there is a barely 2 or 4 points lead for Secretary Clinton.....Picture this, a village idiot (Donald Trump) debating Albert Einstein (Hillary Clinton) on viability of E=mc2 and 48% of the audience agrees with the village idiot. This is a large window into the sad state of education and intelligence of the voting population....
8 | Malinda Mindy Murphy Brannan | 12 | 10154720630668675_10154721093223675 | Best thing anyone can do this time around is research both, weed out the bull, decide what YOU want in a president, which person values are closest to yours and stop watching the news.
9 | Maria Guillory | 7 | 10154720630668675_10154722031833675 | Compared to Drumpf, Hillary is 550+% more knowledgeable, more capable, more prepared to lead our country. Emails are the only thing that Drumpf has except hate, fear, racism, bigotry, misogynistic behavior... Drumpf is going in front of a judge regarding fraud (fake university) in Nov. and rape in Dec. (the victim was 13 when he raped her). There is NO comparison!!! NONE!! But, just in case you need to compare, here are a few issue-related comparisons:Issues - Environment, Hillary knows that climate change is real. Drumpf denies it. Education, Hillary is for investing in our future through education. Drumpf loves the uneducated votes (his words not mine). Humanity, Hillary believes ALL humans are created equally. Drumpf, thinks very little of women, people of color and others (and if you think Drumpf is a Christian, you have been conned royally), Hillary is in favor of equal pay and raising the minimum wage. Drumpf thinks minimum wage is too high. Yet, people earning $7.35 cannot survive. Hillary's entire  career has focused on serving all Americans. Drumpf has taken his entire life. The Clinton Foundation invests 87% of all of its funds to charities around the world. Drumpf's family Foundation buys stuff for him (NY forced them to stop soliciting). When the GOP starts investigating the 60+ deaths at US Embassies under Reagan and the 90+ deaths at US Embassies under W. And, investigate the war criminals W & Cheney for lying to congress to declare war which has caused 4,000+ deaths of American soldiers as well as thousands of soldiers and thousands of civilians, than talk to me about Hillary.Also, when Drumpf releases his taxes (showing his Russian ties because no American bank will lend him money after his 4 bankruptcies), we hear his fraud (fake university) and rape cases, than talk to me about Hillary.Hillary knows the constitution and knows that ALL Americans have the same rights and privileges, she has committed her career to serving others and well SHE IS QUALIFIED!!! Do not buy into the GOP's smoke screens. They have proven over the last years that they are ONLY concerned about the 1-2% oligarchs NOT ALL Americans. VOTE--Mil. and the generation after that, please go vote!!This election is too important to not vote!!
10 | Peggy Schmid | 13 | 10154720630668675_10154721707378675 | I'M STICKING WITH HER!One week until Election Day and the we are talking about Anthony Weiner's perverted emails and laptop. But Trump still won't release his taxes and the media went from sex assault scandal and  trial back to her emails. This ish is ridiculous .He's hiding something for sure.
11 | Christina Kook | 15 | 10154720630668675_10154721369558675 | Trump has 2 open court cases on the docket. One is the brutal rape of a 13 year old girl. The other is for fraudulently ripping off the students at his University. His ties to the Russian Oligarchy are deeply troubling and The NYT is reporting he has a secret server communicating real time with Russia. Trump is a vulgar monster. Hillary has real solutions to America's problems. But do go on and on about emails.
12 | Anthony Caro | 10 | 10154720630668675_10154721397038675 | That's all they got on her, that's nothing, Trump lives in court, but I've been wondering how did he funnel that money from his casinos to his hotels without getting caught and bankrupt the casno
13 | Wash Syl | 8 | 10154720630668675_10154721314893675 | I thought one time I might not vote, but the more I hear EMAIL, I'm so sick of that word  it's driving me to consider, maybe this is smoke and mirrors and I'm sick of this warped, , Embarrassing, circusin front of the world.First GOP acted like children. Now foreigngovernments are runningour elections and now afew days away from theelection, the FBI is embarrassing , stop it now.The world watches andlaughs.
14 | Eric Moss | 5 | 10154720630668675_10154721111153675 | These emails are not as important as the leaked Podesta emails, where there is frank discussion of privatizing Social Security, nominating Republican Supreme Court Justices, and passing TPP.  Trump is up-front about destroying the New Deal, which is an awful thing, but Clinton's big Wall Street backers are trying to do the same thing.  Bernie has his work cut out for him pressuring Clinton to not do it.
15 | David Ogun | 8 | 10154720630668675_10154721803798675 | I guess  most yanks with brains would never vote for a very dim candidate in Trump. The guy simply has no knowledge of anything and is being pushed  by Putin to stand. Putin needs to get rid of the sanctions imposed on him after his adventures in Crimea. An ignorant President Trump should sort this out hence the support and hacking.
16 | Rose Rader Jayah | 3 | 10154720630668675_10154722187938675 | We are so sick and tired of the email witch hunt by the Republicans. Enough money and time has been wasted on their stupid effort to bring a good woman down! I already voted for Hillary here in California, yes!
17 | Kenneth Viste | 3 | 10154720630668675_10154722035933675 | Consider what a wasteful game has been played about emails. The FBI and the media are obsessed with this story but what is it really? If there is a crime committed it would be deliberately passing classified material to unauthorized people. The chances of FBI ever finding that are miniscule. The most they are going to find is some mislabeling or carelessly forwarding something. That can and does happen probably in every office that handles classified material, even Comely's office. But the media has been obsessed with Clinton emails for years. It is played on the news as a big story but it shouldn't be. Now Comey has extended the investigation into staff and spouses of staff. The State Department has a lot of staff to investigate. I think the FBI and the media have bigger things to work on than trying to make something out of very little.
18 | Brian Lynch | 7 | 10154720630668675_10154722062883675 | Let's see...has the FBI non-revelation of anything substantive but innuendo led me to consider voting for a man who has openly promoted bigotry, bullying, racism, Islamophobia, xenophobia, violence against political rivals, who promotes himself in grandiose terms as he is followed by multiple bankruptcies, charges of fraud, countless unpaid bills owed to people he has hired, charges of sexual assault, shady ties to foreign governments cloaked in secrecy....or do I stick with voting for a woman who has been Secretary of State, US Senator, and First Lady for decades, who has been "investigated" by seemingly endless committees on charges repeatedly found to be nothing but baseless political weapons of hateful opponents? Why is there even a question? Are there really this many US citizens so duped that this is a real question?
19 | Roger Cruser | 5 | 10154720630668675_10154721122788675 | I think the consensus on PBS tonight was that few voters will change their opinion at this late date. Many have already voted. Now, whatever candidate says or does is probably non-news.
20 | Nancy Natow Cassidy | 11 | 10154720630668675_10154721674243675 | Please focus more on all the Trump lawsuits and issues - don't ignore everything he has said and done or you are doing him a favor
21 | Dwana Chapman | 0 | 10154720630668675_10154722566288675 | It's motivated me that I'm still voting for her. Trump has fraud charges in Nov. and child rape charges in Dec. Not to mention all the other lawsuits against him, all this just walking in the Whitehouse, if he was to win. Hillary's emails, are unfortunate, but nothing new. Trump and his mad love affair with putin, and all that garbage is more worrisome.
22 | Peter Epstein | 0 | 10154720630668675_10154722577913675 | The E-mails are such a phony issue, ginned up by republicans that have been after the Clintons for 30 years, they and you should be ashamed. In 30 years, after numerous politically motivated investigations, nothing, nothing has ever had any legal standing. Trump is not “trying to make America great again”, but turn us into a third world dictatorship.
23 | Michael Newland | 0 | 10154720630668675_10154722438703675 | If being a predator who brags about his sexual assault does not disqualify him in supporters minds, it's doubtful that ties to Russia, criminal tax evasion, or being a violent bully will either.
24 | Texas Liberal Veteran | 2 | 10154720630668675_10154722016403675 | Fresh reporting about Russian entanglements could widen the race in favor of Clinton. A 20% chance of Trump victory is unacceptable, as America faces its 1930s Germany moment.
25 | Julie Powell | 0 | 10154720630668675_10154722325278675 | No more PBS NewsHour for me. Stopped watching weeks ago. Told them why: they never mention Jill Stein, as though she doesn't even exist. Slanted news YUCK. Give me my FreeSpeechTV.

1 | Amy Martin | 11 | 10154720627998675_10154721251613675 | Based on interviews with women Trump supporters I've seen, strangely they all seem to be blonds..haha It's bizarre. Most   have dismissed his disrespect and hostile attitude towards women. When the comments about the leaked tape came out, one woman Trump supporter said her sons said worse and she shrugged it off. I was mystified that she compared a teen's behavior to an almost 60 year old man's behavior and she didn't seem to acknowledge the difference in ages. And then I was horrified that her teen sons said worse and she didn't talk to them about their behavior. Teens are at a receptive age. She could have been a positive influence on her son's behavior, now they're unchallenged like I'm sure Trump was. He was't stopped when he was young, and now he's a hot mess. This mother and I imagine others are going to lead their sons to a failed future where they get fired from their jobs.
2 | Scott Cowart | 0 | 10154720627998675_10154722522528675 | A FEW THINGS WE NEED TO KNOW. ABOUT..DONALD TRUMP>>                 Trump Does The Unthinkable -Liz Crokin ....>                                 Entertainment columnist for the "Red Eye Edition of the Chicago Tribune" and as a freelancer for "Us Weekly".>>                       In 1986, Trump prevented the foreclosure of Annabell Hill's family farm after her husband committed suicide. Trump personally phoned down to the auction to stop the sale of her home and offered the widow money. Trump decided to take action after he saw Hill's pleas for help in news reports.>>>>                       In 1988, a commercial airline refused to fly Andrew Ten, a sick child with a rare illness, across the country to get medical care because he had to travel with an elaborate life-support system. His grief stricken parents contacted Trump for help and he didn't hesitate to send HIS own plane to take the child from Los Angeles to New York so he could get his treatment.>>>                       In 1991, 200 Marines who served in Operation Desert Storm spent time at Camp Lejeunein,  North Carolina before they were scheduled to return home to their families. However, the Marines were told that a mistake had been made and an aircraft would not be able to take them home on their scheduled departure date. When Trump got wind of this, he sent HIS plane to make two trips from North Carolina to Miami to safely return the Gulf War Marines to their loved  ones.>>>                       In 1995, a motorist stopped to help Trump after the limo he was traveling in got a flat tire. Trump asked the Good Samaritan how he could repay him for his help. All the man asked for was a bouquet of flowers for his wife. A few weeks later Trump sent the flowers with a note that read: "We've paid off your mortgage.">>>                       In 2000, Maury Povich featured a little girl named Megan who struggled with Brittle Bone Disease on his show and Trump happened to be watching. Trump said the little girl's story and positive attitude touched his heart. So he contacted Maury and gifted the little girl and her family with a very generous check..>>>                       In 2008,after Jennifer Hudson's family members were tragically murdered in Chicago, Trump put the Oscar-winning actress and her family up at his Windy City hotel for free. In addition to that, Trump's security took extra measures to ensure Hudson and her family members were safe during such a difficult time.>>>                       In 2013, New York bus driver Darnell Barton spotted a woman close to the edge of a bridge staring at traffic below as he drove by. He stopped the bus, got out and put his arm around the woman and saved her life by convincing her to not jump. When Trump heard about this story, he sent the hero bus driver a check simply because he believed his good deed deserved to be rewarded.>>>                       In 2014,Trump gave $25,000 to Sgt. Andrew Tahmooressi after he spent seven months in a Mexican jail for accidentally crossing the US-Mexico border. President Barack Obama couldn't even be bothered to make one phone call to assist with the United States Marine's release; however, Trump opened his pocketbook to help this serviceman get back on his feet.>>>                       In 2016, Melissa Consin Young attended a Trump rally and tear fully thanked Trump for changing her life. She said she proudly stood on stage with Trump as Miss Wisconsin USA in 2005. However, years later she found herself struggling with an incurable illness and during her darkest days she explained that she received a handwritten letter from Trump telling her she's the "bravest woman, I know." She said the opportunities that she got from Trump and his organizations ultimately provided her Mexican-American son with a full-ride to college.>>>                       Lynne Patton, a black female executive for the Trump Organization, released a statement in 2016 defending her boss against accusations that he's a racist and a bigot. She tearfully revealed how she's struggled with substance abuse and addiction for years. Instead of kicking her to the curb, she said the Trump Organization and his entire family loyally stood by her through "immensely difficult times.">>>                       Trump's kindness knows no bounds and his generosity has and continues to touch the lives of people from every sex, race and religion. When Trump sees someone in need, he wants to help.>>>                       Two decades ago, Oprah asked Trump in a TV interview if he'd run for president. He said: "If it got so bad, I would never want to rule it out totally, because I really am tired of seeing what's happening with this country." That day has come. Trump sees that America is in need and he wants to help- how unthinkable!>                                 Donald Trump is a racist, bigot, sexist, xenophobe and Islamophobe --did I miss anything? The left and the media launch these hideous kinds of attacks at Trump everyday; yet, nothing could be further from the truth about the real estate mogul. As an entertainment journalist, I've had the opportunity to cover Trump for over a decade, and in all my years covering him I've never heard anything negative about the man until he announced he was running for president. Keep in mind, I got paid a lot of money to dig up dirt on celebrities like Trump for a living so a scandalous story on the famous billionaire could've potentially sold a lot of magazines and would've been a "huge" feather in my cap. Instead, I found that he doesn't drink alcohol or do drugs, he's a hard working businessman and totally devoted to his beloved wife and children. On top of that, he's one of the most generous celebrities in the world with a heart filled with more gold than his $100 million New York penthouse.>>                       "EVIL SUCCEEDS WHEN GOOD PEOPLE STAND BY AND DO NOTHING!">>                       "Silence makes cowards out of the best of men."--Abraham Lincoln.>>                       SILENCE IS CONSENT...... So share this with those you know.>
3 | James Nelson | 4 | 10154720627998675_10154720887653675 | STEP 1)    Poisoning the wellPoisoning the well (or attempting to poison the well) is a fallacy where irrelevant adverse information about a target is preemptively presented to an audience, with the intention of discrediting or ridiculing everything that the target person is about to say. Poisoning the well can take the form of an (explicit or implied) argument, and is considered by some philosophers an informal fallacy.A poisoned-well "argument" has the following form:1. Unfavorable information (Hillary’s emails) (be it true or false) about person A (Hillary)is presented by another (Comey & the GOP). (e.g. "Before you listen to my opponent, may I remind you that he has been in jail")2. Therefore, the claims made by person A will be false. I have seen this tactic used by American lawyers many times in my career.  During or just before a big case is to be made the attorneys will poison the well against their opponents merely to discredit them.However, there is never any thought about defending the false allegations in the court of law; only in the court of public opinion.Don’t be fooled!!!
4 | Robert Rankin | 4 | 10154720627998675_10154720808348675 | Yes...when Brazile was giving Hillary Clinton the questions to the second debate. Then after the debate, the only thing the liberals could talk about was how Trump was hovering over Clinton. It kinda reminds me of how the democrats was accusing Trump of inciting violence, when all along it was Hillary Clinton that was hiring people to start the violence. They go low we go high. Ha! what a joke.
5 | Jack Carrenard | 1 | 10154720627998675_10154722094823675 | Director Comey is in cahoots with House Republicans to undermine the electoral process. What did the Director know and when did he know it. It turns out the FBI had knowkedge of the emails weeks ago but waited just now to release the news to inflict as much damage as possible to the Clinton campaign. Prosecute Comey under the Hatch act.

She broke the law and belongs in jail. She risked our country and put our people in harm's way, and had Democratic whistleblowers murdered. Not only Billery is very dangerous, she will bring this country to a security collapse with cutting our military and a financial collapse by choosing a fight with Russia and ruining small businesses while sending all jobs overseas. Please don't vote for the DEVIL. This country needs to be free and strong, where people have a real chance at the American Dream. Billery should have never been the Democratic candidate to start with and stole the nomination from Bernie Sanders. She is the most corrupt candidate ever and works for the elite new world order who wants to make people obsolete with new robotic technology. She brings with her sinister powers and so do not be fooled by her fake smiles and phony consideration for the working man, or woman. Vote Donald Trump and save our nation. CNN until now has been reporting lies and gossip that was never admissible in court about Donald Trump. But tonight CNN, the yellow tabloid, must for a change act like a real news network and report the truth. Pray to God and pray hard that Donald Trump is our next President. We need to stop criminal refugees from coming here and take care first of our American veterans. We need to work on better trade deals so manufacturing will be back in America. We need to stop paying for parasites! The election is at stake with Billery's dirty tricks and it must be watched closely. Donald Trump is our only hope before Killery turns this country to a worse version of 1984 by George Orwell. I hope the next thing Trump do as our new much admired President is expose all the dirt, every affair and sexual indecency of every CNN reporter, including Anderson, Gloria, and that self righteous long brown haired woman. Then, HC must be locked up for the rest of her life. If you don't want more zombies on the streets, if you don't want to give up cash, and guns and freedom of speech, VOTE for TRUMP!!! We can't afford the status quo! We're losing our country!!! Dare, you pathetic paid patsies online of HC to call me names and I will take screen shots and sue you for libel!!! This nation is SICK of the Clinton cover ups. Stop totalitarianism! CNN=Clinton News Network. Hope Trump fires many of you when he is elected! Let us pray November 8 brings the change that we so desperately need. Long Live Trump, our savior!I am:1) A married WOMAN2) Have no kids3) Intelligent and educated4) Independent politically5) Trump Supporter, Truth Supporter, Freedom Supporter and a Proud American 6) Not a racist, respectful of ALL religions and races 7) Very worried about how globalism will annihilate our country as we know itWe all know main stream media and the system are rigged. We must never take our freedom for granted. On November 8 stand the lines as long as they are because our liberty and justice for all are at stake. Let us pray Billery/Killery will be arrested soon, AMEN. Please share and God Bless. P.S. For crying outloud, stop briefing the enemy Billery if you want to keep the U.S. safe!Hellery/Liary needs to have her clearance removed. Clean the swamp America! Huma is most likely a spy and Loretta Lynch, Justice Department director is as vicious as Killery, pleading the Fifth when Congress asked her about why so many millions of dollars "disappeared" and ended in Iran! We MUST put a stop to the traitors and tried them all for TREASON. PPS Huma=married to a pedophile. Killery=married to a rapist. That's how they respect women, ha???!!! JOKE! We ALL know LIARY is a pathological liar and an urgent danger to the sovereignty of the U.S. Please be careful about CNN too-they are ANTI AMERICAN. Who knows what more harm Killery did to our beloved country. Pray for our country and Trump. Ask yourself who is helping Hillery with the cover up and why...We want our country back!

There has been a lot of criticism directed at FBI Director James Comey for what he did on Friday. What motivated him to write to Congress?
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Eileen Ward | 77 | 10154720615808675_10154720681563675 | He's. A Trump man. Probably got paid to do it this week so there wouldn't be time to clear things up. Hang him from a flag pole upside down so his 30 pieces of silver (or the modern equivalent) will fall out of his pockets
2 | Ed Weigandt | 54 | 10154720615808675_10154720702538675 | BETTER QUESTION: What motivated Rep. Jason Chaffetz to tweet/leak out the letter Comey wrote then state that the email server investigation was re-opened? If anyone should be investigated for violating the Hatch Act it should be Jason Chaffetz.
3 | James Nelson | 44 | 10154720615808675_10154720670928675 | STEP 1)    Poisoning the wellPoisoning the well (or attempting to poison the well) is a fallacy where irrelevant adverse information about a target is preemptively presented to an audience, with the intention of discrediting or ridiculing everything that the target person is about to say.

4 | John L Gower | 36 | 10154720615808675_10154720713828675 | What is  republican Comey's motive?    Smearing the Democratic nominee 10 days out from the election with some kind of vague statement about someone else's emails.
5 | Yoritomo Jiriki | 25 | 10154720615808675_10154720677718675 | The reason? Rep. Jason Chaffitz. It's not a coincidence that Chaffitz flip flops and votes for Trump after saying he can't and this coming out the next day.

7 | Kenneth Viste | 10 | 10154720615808675_10154720972848675 | When is some news organization going to point out that the email "scandal" is a hoax. What crime other than deliberately passing classified material to unauthorized people? All they are going to find is some clerk or staff member mislabeling or wrongly forwarding something. That is hardly worthy of panic obsession with emails that clutters up news programs and pages.
8 | Parul Sharma | 10 | 10154720615808675_10154720713348675 | So basically it's much ado about nothing . The only statement is that Comey must have made taht decision because there has to be  soemthing substantial or else he would not done something so big. I decline the premise that Comey is an ethical and moral man. Why would you inform Congress if you have not even legal permission to read these emails. I mean warrant was taken before that. So what was the premise for that warrants urgency? Maybe Trump is right. Judges, FBI director and the entire machinery is doomed
9 | Kenneth Viste | 4 | 10154720615808675_10154720954708675 | One of the news pieces that come up when I go on the internet was of the daughter of Trump boasting that her father pressured Comey to act. I don't know how reliable that was and I saw it only once. Thought it interesting.
10 | Kermit Hellrung | 1 | 10154720615808675_10154721528818675 | His intentions could of been honorable, but he rushed to judgement and should have waited until he knew what if anything he had. There is a lack of confidence in his leadership, he can be a number 2 or 3 man but not number one. He has to find something in order to save face. It is unfortunate, however he is serving in a appointed position with a 10 year term. If he doesn't resign, there is nothing that can be done. His actions will influence the results of the election.
11 | Harry Brewick | 4 | 10154720615808675_10154720937628675 | FBI says 650,000 e-mails found on the perverts laptop, Huma Abedin claims she never used the laptop... It would take someone using the laptop 5 years, 365 days a year and sending or receiving 350 e-mails everyday... Does the FBI really think that this "FIND" is not a bit STRANGE??
12 | Jay C. Price | 1 | 10154720615808675_10154721853703675 | that's what obama gets for keeping a republican for fbi director. how come this guy doesn't investigate the russians for hacking the dnc  and trump working with the russians ? http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/10/31/donald-trump-james-comey-harry-reid-fbi-russia-elijah-cummings/93051988/ if you can investigate clinton, investigate trump also. i'm not choosing sides, but if you look into one of them, the look into both of them.
13 | Judi Romaine | 0 | 10154720615808675_10154721754903675 | He seems to be very uncomfortable with whether he is looking good or bad to his friends and the GOP.  I don't think it is conscious and I don't think he is specifically after Hillary, but mire he is trying to look honest and balanced. And like us all, has a skewed view of what that might be.
14 | Eric Hancock | 1 | 10154720615808675_10154721790878675 | People want to give excuses or trumped up reasons but this is the country that only let them vote a couple decades ago & in small towns such narrow minded bigotry still reigns openly or in secret: they don't want a woman president.  Other women resent her- only rational reason I can think of any self respecting woman would support a sexist, perverted bigot like Trump.. or they tolerate such behavior at home.  Sad either way.
15 | Humberto Capiro | 3 | 10154720615808675_10154720778778675 | So the Justice Department could have stopped FBI director Comey but they did not. They chose instead to criticize him for not following their recommendations.  Very strange!!
16 | Kristi McArthur | 0 | 10154720615808675_10154720814443675 | Obviously you would have to have some pretty circumstantial evidence to just reopen an FBI case days before the FBI election so while you Clinton bots ( aka ctr) ragging on Comey you wouldn't have just done this for no reason so many days before the election obviously it's important
17 | Robin Friday | 3 | 10154720615808675_10154720814668675 | I believe that he is an honest man but he allowed his own self-righteousness to carry him away. The dichotomy between his forthrightness with the Clinton question and his reluctance in the earlier instance with Trump is not making logical sense and illustrates that he has allowed his self-image to betray him and lead him into hypocrisy.
18 | Art Mills | 8 | 10154720615808675_10154720730558675 | There is no justification whatsoever for Comey's talking with the House about an investigation. He is not accountable to them and has an absolute obligation to maintain confidentiality until he charges are filed, and only then in the context of the trial!
19 | Dirk Willard | 2 | 10154720615808675_10154720796708675 | Fun watching Clinton's trolls at work. The zombie voters, the Clintonites just lap it up.Here goes. I will add my speculation to the mix. Comey probably got fed up with obstruction by the Obama administration ordered by the Clinton machine. The FBI was behind taking down Nixon but not in the way you imagined. It was Mark Felt, the number two at the FBI, AKA "Deep Throat" that guided Woodward and Bernstein at the Washington Post. Felt's identity was kept secret until he died; when he was outed by Woodward, an uproar from the conservatives insisted he was a traitor: he was a patriot. Even then, it must be remembered that Felt had his own agenda: he wanted to save the agency from the embarrassment of going along with Nixon's plumbers. Heroes must be allowed their own agendas.My only hope now is that we can quickly come to terms. It took two years for the Democrats and Republicans to put down their lances. I would like to see the Democrats and Republicans meet and decide that Hillary must not be allowed to take this country down that dark path we traveled during Watergate.
20 | Marilyn D'Auria | 3 | 10154720615808675_10154721296028675 | His motives are pretty transparent. Interestingly, he disobeyed his superior (who happens to be female, I wonder if he would have defied a male superior?) He needs to be fired.
21 | Sj Lag | 2 | 10154720615808675_10154721110298675 | Loretta Lynch can't complain she could have ordered the FBI Director Not to inform Congress, but then that would be even worse because She's the one that entertained Bill Clinton one week before Hillary's deposition with the FBI. Huma can clear up everything and release her Emails Herself tomorrow. She and Anthony Weiner hid the laptop from the earlier probe because of his bad sexual behavior on that laptop. Hopefully Huma will not end up in trouble all because of Hillary Clinton's e-mails. No one to blame for this but Hillary she chose to have a private server in the first place everything else is unintended consequences.
22 | Dennis G. McAuliffe | 3 | 10154720615808675_10154720731743675 | What is of great concern is thatFBI Director James Comey argued privately that it was too close to Election Day for the United States government to name Russia as meddling in the U.S. election and ultimately ensured that the FBI's name was not on the document that the U.S. government put out, a former bureau official tells CNBC.The official said some government insiders are perplexed as to why Comey would have election timing concerns with the Russian disclosure but not with the Huma Abedin email discovery disclosure he made Friday.In the end, the Department of Homeland Security and The Office of the Director of National Intelligence issued the statement on Oct. 7, saying: "The U.S. intelligence community is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of emails from U.S. persons and institutions, including from U.S. political organizations. ... These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the U.S. election process.
23 | Patricia D Rocker | 0 | 10154720615808675_10154721334353675 | He worked three years under Giuliani and picked up on his mobster tactics. Comey should have mentioned the investigation of Trump's Russian ties at the same "briefing".
24 | Janet Fredmund Kuplinski | 0 | 10154720615808675_10154721104548675 | Perhaps when his Republican peers trounced on him for not charging Hillary in the first investigation he decided to get back in their good graces by pulling this stunt.
25 | Christopher Keene | 0 | 10154720615808675_10154720995698675 | What he did at the very least was unethical. And as a voter i don't understand how he could do this without knowing that this would unfairly influence some voter unjustly as to misinform voters as if there were proven legal facts that would implement Hillary Clinton. It is not up to F.B.I. Director James Comley to be Judge , Jury and Prosecutor. This is not the Soviet Union.

The idea of conceding a defeat with grace — or, conversely, not gloating over victory — has always resonated with the American public.

1 | Brian Speer | 18 | 10154720300413675_10154720751933675 | I rather hope that the speech is not delivered live, but instead re-enacted later by Alec Baldwin, who is far more entertaining.
2 | TJ Neuharth | 4 | 10154720300413675_10154721779558675 | No one cares at this point if Trump even bothers to concede, we will elect Clinton in a landslide and just start celebrating. Trump will officially become irrelevant as history always intended...and the free world will move forward.
3 | Eileen Ward | 0 | 10154720300413675_10154721994298675 | Don't think it will this time Unfortunately. Trump will be claiming a Fix when he loses. And he and his pundits will be crying Foul till they lose their voices or a Big Tragedy occurs Then only Fox TV 📺 will be doing it
4 | Sj Lag | 0 | 10154720300413675_10154721170068675 | Maybe wr should wait and see it could be Hillary making that speech Again. The Election could always be thrown into the Congress and that nice man from Utah could be our next President............
5 | Nancy Luce Groehn | 7 | 10154720300413675_10154720564213675 | Let's see if graciousness, fairness,  and democracy continues....or will it be sour grapes and dissension? What is our history and example? We decide.
6 | George Adams | 2 | 10154720300413675_10154720822453675 | STOP Election Fraud: Do NOT use Soros voting machines. Please vote to put Billery/Killery on trial for TREASON. She broke the law and belongs in jail. She risked our country and put our people in harm's way, and had Democratic whistleblowers murdered. Not only Billery is very dangerous, she will bring this country to a security collapse with cutting our military and a financial collapse by choosing a fight with Russia and ruining small businesses while sending all jobs overseas. Please don't vote for the DEVIL. This country needs to be free and strong, where people have a real chance at the American Dream. Billery should have never been the Democratic candidate to start with and stole the nomination from Bernie Sanders. She is the most corrupt candidate ever and works for the elite new world order who wants to make people obsolete with new robotic technology. She brings with her sinister powers and so do not be fooled by her fake smiles and phony consideration for the working man, or woman. Vote Donald Trump and save our nation. CNN until now has been reporting lies and gossip that was never admissible in court about Donald Trump. But tonight CNN, the yellow tabloid, must for a change act like a real news network and report the truth. Pray to God and pray hard that Donald Trump is our next President. We need to stop criminal refugees from coming here and take care first of our American veterans. We need to work on better trade deals so manufacturing will be back in America. We need to stop paying for parasites! The election is at stake with Billery's dirty tricks and it must be watched closely. Donald Trump is our only hope before Killery turns this country to a worse version of 1984 by George Orwell. I hope the next thing Trump do as our new much admired President is expose all the dirt, every affair and sexual indecency of every CNN reporter, including Anderson, Gloria, and that self righteous long brown haired woman. Then, HC must be locked up for the rest of her life. If you don't want more zombies on the streets, if you don't want to give up cash, and guns and freedom of speech, VOTE for TRUMP!!! We can't afford the status quo! We're losing our country!!! Dare, you pathetic paid patsies online of HC to call me names and I will take screen shots and sue you for libel!!! This nation is SICK of the Clinton cover ups. Stop totalitarianism! CNN=Clinton News Network. Hope Trump fires many of you when he is elected! Let us pray November 8 brings the change that we so desperately need. Long Live Trump, our savior!I am:1) A married WOMAN2) Have no kids3) Intelligent and educated4) Independent politically5) Trump Supporter, Truth Supporter, Freedom Supporter and a Proud American 6) Not a racist, respectful of ALL religions and races 7) Very worried about how globalism will annihilate our country as we know itWe all know main stream media and the system are rigged. We must never take our freedom for granted. On November 8 stand the lines as long as they are because our liberty and justice for all are at stake. Let us pray Billery/Killery will be arrested soon, AMEN. Please share and God Bless. P.S. For crying outloud, stop briefing the enemy Billery if you want to keep the U.S. safe!Hellery/Liary needs to have her clearance removed. Clean the swamp America! Huma is most likely a spy and Loretta Lynch, Justice Department director is as vicious as Killery, pleading the Fifth when Congress asked her about why so many millions of dollars "disappeared" and ended in Iran! We MUST put a stop to the traitors and tried them all for TREASON. PPS Huma=married to a pedophile. Killery=married to a rapist. That's how they respect women, ha???!!! JOKE! We ALL know LIARY is a pathological liar and an urgent danger to the sovereignty of the U.S. Please be careful about CNN too-they are ANTI AMERICAN. Who knows what more harm Killery did to our beloved country. Pray for our country and Trump. Ask yourself who is helping Hillery with the cover up and why...We want our country back!

Hormone injections for men have proven to be an effective birth control method, according to a recent study.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Aneetha Trikur | 89 | 10154719396558675_10154720142183675 | "Mood disorders, depression, acne "Sounds like PMS to me which women suffer every month. And the guys dropped out? Wimps!!
2 | Lynn K Luckeroth | 74 | 10154719396558675_10154720126703675 | Women have been dealing with side effects too...some even died from clots or heart attacks...it's a good thing that men share the responsibility.
3 | Claire Laskowski | 16 | 10154719396558675_10154720665108675 | I find it difficult to be objective about these side effects. If you want to talk side effects try taking the birth control pills women have been taking for decades. Strange it's ok for women to suffer through them but, God forbid, men should have to deal with side effects, too.
4 | Ashley Connell | 10 | 10154719396558675_10154720665523675 | Copied from a friend Alisha Mitchell  but she said it better than I can: There have been a lot of posts about the male hormonal birth control trials that ended due to  common side effects women have been enduring since the pill was invented. As much as I super love to tease men for being babies, I do want to point out that from the study I read that not only was the male birth control shot significantly less effective than female contraceptives (about 96% for male, compared to the 99.9% females enjoy), one participant committed suicide in the study, and another attempted suicide, as well as the shot causing some participants to not regain total fertility for up to one year, some did not regain normal fertility even after four years. Basically, they are adjusting the drug because it is not effective enough, and has side effects that are not worth the benefits it provides. Now. I think female birth control definitely has a lot of issues, however, women do have a vast variety to chose from (if their insurance is inclined to cover it). The study results showed the participants would prefer a pill form rather than injection, much like many women prefer in their BC. So it isn't like a little acne or moodiness is making them hate the idea of male BC, they just want similar options with side effects that may not result in suicide or sterility. Ok, I'm off my soapbox, #birthcontrolforall!
5 | Stan Aylsworth | 11 | 10154719396558675_10154720226743675 | Realistically, 96% IS NOT "nearly 100% effective" when it comes to birth-control.That's a pregnancy 4 out of a 100 goes or 2 out of 50 or 1 out of 25... Not great odds really.If it rains, wear a raincoat. Wrap it.
6 | Eileen Ward | 3 | 10154719396558675_10154720277433675 | I don't think we'll see a run on appointments BUT if a single guy wants to be sure or at least 96% sure it could be worth it to them not to become a father but I think it's the same percentage as a condom and they protect you from STD's too
7 | Gwyn Richard | 6 | 10154719396558675_10154720297758675 | Wonderful advances in medicine. I am sure many men would find this useful. And it would be very helpful to couples if both sides were doing their best to prevent unwanted pregnancies.
8 | Elaine Lawler | 28 | 10154719396558675_10154720219243675 | Side effects are only acceptable for women? I'm holding up a finger - guess which one.
9 | Katherine Ella Petoskey | 0 | 10154719396558675_10154722115548675 | You do realize that the first "trials" i. e.  Experiments with female birth control pills were conducted on the indigenous women of certain central american countries and caused Horrible side effects. Do some research on this its enlightening. My opinion is that a male anti conception pill will not be widely accepted (except by chronic philanderers). There is also the problem of trust. We've been hearing " don't worry I'll take care, you won't get pregnant" for ages.
10 | Sheila Defazio | 6 | 10154719396558675_10154720523148675 | So do you think women's contraceptives don't have side effects? Seriously read the warnings on a package of birth control pills...it's going to be hard to get men to prevent something they haven't worked real hard at preventing in the first place...
11 | Mark Maseeh | 0 | 10154719396558675_10154721117273675 | Synthetic hormones are never a good thing. These are not real bio-identical hormones, but instead are man made and can cause serious life threatening side effects.
12 | Diane DiPerna-Conti | 1 | 10154719396558675_10154721242118675 | ..fuggedaboutit....as much as I would like to see this really -seriously happen - I really do not think the Medical / Research part of this in general isn't trying hard enough to find something that would really work  - women have been carrying the brunt of it for ages  - I was one of the first to take "the pill" ....back in the early 60's  - we were told literally NOTHING about  it  - any 'side effects ? what are side effects ???.lol..just "it'll keep you from getting pregnant"..- basically we were and continue to be 'the guinea pigs' in this equation....
13 | Moani Ke'ala Alverio | 0 | 10154719396558675_10154721057663675 | I don't feel sorry at all. Not all men but some expect their partners to get snipped after having kids, when most themselves won't do it. I'm not saying our awesome guys should suffer, but I think a guy got some big cahones to step up and try it. Every bcp works differently on women it might with the guys, so Guys, give it a go. Some already use viagara and that's brave! Knowing the side effect for viagara is death. Can't deal yet?  Why don't both of you get snipped? Then both of you get some needed after surgery chill time at home. What I don't get is how men let women go through depression, weight gain (then try and leave women for it when the man himself ask his partner to get on the pull), etc. If you are a brave male and would try it or something better, say I WOULD!!! Or else push scientists to come up with a bcp that has no side effects. What man will stand up once and for all for every mother, sister, friend and fix the problem for us women? WHO will finally stand? If no one will, try it guys.
14 | Mona Thornton | 8 | 10154719396558675_10154720238608675 | But men either won't do it because they are inherently babies and will complaining about the side effects; or can't be trusted ( unless they are in a committed relationship).
15 | Graham Elliott | 0 | 10154719396558675_10154722195133675 | forget thisthere is something better - Vasalgelno hormones, reversible, CHEAP, lasts 10 yearsand those are the reasons its not available
16 | Martha Matthews | 0 | 10154719396558675_10154722178058675 | The deal is though, could a man say he was using contraceptives, when he in reality wasn't?  Consider the implications...
17 | Jeffrey Kelley | 0 | 10154719396558675_10154720137863675 | I wouldnt want this. Women have hormonal BC and it can adversely effect them in many ways. I wouldn't want that happening to me or anyone else.  I would rather wait for Vasalgel...which is an injection of a gel into the vas deferense. It is reversed by removing the gel.
18 | Jennifer Swart | 31 | 10154719396558675_10154720275348675 | 
19 | Alexandra Allwein | 8 | 10154719396558675_10154720196008675 | "Mood disorders, depression, acne and other side effects" wow... jeez that must be TERRIBLE!! Lmao men are weak and wack af
20 | Jaimee Maskart | 3 | 10154719396558675_10154720332493675 | All you pro life men, you know have control!! No need for any more senseless abortions!
21 | Sarah L Mattingly | 1 | 10154719396558675_10154720619773675 | Female contraception also has side effects. I wonder if men will be willing to put up with them.
22 | Sam Lynch | 1 | 10154719396558675_10154720772273675 | Well, there only 96% effective. 4 percentage points is a big deal the medical profession.
23 | Erin Forta | 5 | 10154719396558675_10154720146063675 | Most of these side effects also happen to women on hormonal birth control. This is not surprising to me at all.
24 | Felicia Diamond | 2 | 10154719396558675_10154720802033675 | Side effects like the ones women deal with. *dead pan looks at the camera*

Here's hoping we get lots of milk chocolate in our trick-or-treat bags tonight. (from The Atlantic)
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Stephen Lloyd | 57 | 10154719964783675_10154720111673675 | Depends. British, Belgian and German milk chocolate is usually good. American milk chocolate tastes like wax. I prefer dark overall though because it's not as sweet and tastes more, well, chocolaty.
2 | Cydnee White | 31 | 10154719964783675_10154720049503675 | I prefer dark, but I wouldn't say it was "better". Why say "better" instead of "I prefer"? I think it's because people who think if you disagree with their preference, you are wrong, are insecure.
3 | James Parson | 7 | 10154719964783675_10154720361118675 | Interesting. I have always way preferred dark chocolate, but that might also just be because it's incredibly rare for me to have a sweet tooth.If ya wanna talk about chalky texture, grab some of that Hershey's...
4 | Peggy Slemp | 6 | 10154719964783675_10154720306708675 | Personally, I hate the taste of Hershey's. It makes my throat feel irritated. Belgian, Swiss and German chocolate are usually great-smooth, whether milk or dark, I love both, but I like dark best.
5 | Gerard Thomas | 7 | 10154719964783675_10154720200013675 | One of  my biggest regrets is my daughters outgrowing Trick or Treat,,and trying to track down all those peanut butter cups, Snickers and Mr. Goodbars which so mysteriously disappeared....
6 | David Levin | 3 | 10154719964783675_10154721874003675 | Objectively speaking (or posting in this case) as a scientist w/ a PhD, I can inform you that: - The science has elucidated that dark chocolate tastes 110.24% better than milk chocolate. - That genetic analysis has shown that people who like dark chocolate are in fact evolutionarily more evolved than those who prefer milk chocolate. - That the reason milk chocolate lovers believe dark chocolate lovers are "snobs" is due to a perceptional bias resulting from the proven fact that the milk chocolate lovers' false opinion is made from the position of being uncouth philistines.- That the principles of liberal democracy were developed by those who consumed dark chocolate and that milk chocolate was introduced into the US as a means to undermine Western values of liberty and justice by the USSR who stole the recipe from the Nazis at the end of WWII.
7 | Carolyn Buon-Cristiani | 1 | 10154719964783675_10154721041113675 | Belgian, and only Belgian, Dark Chocolate.That's it.If you are comparing chocolates by peeling the foil off those teeny American made Hershey bars, you have not lived. And don't talk to me about expensively wrapped bars or those with high "solid" content. I consume mass quantities, and it's gotta be good. Belgian.
8 | David Armstrong | 1 | 10154719964783675_10154721279188675 | I will only point out that comparing consumption of crappy Hershey’s milk chocolate to crappy Hershey’s dark chocolate as a means to determine that either type is categorically superior is just bad science.
9 | Terry Reynolds | 2 | 10154719964783675_10154720481028675 | In addition to tasting like real chocolate instead of some weak imitation Dark chocolate has health benefits that milk c. doesn't.
10 | Claire Costello | 1 | 10154719964783675_10154720860423675 | OMG! Would someone please tell MOMs, Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, and every major drug store and grocery chain. It's so hard to find organic milk chocolate any more.
11 | J Nia Watson | 0 | 10154719964783675_10154721457443675 | Uh, no. Milk chocolate is garbage. So are IPAs. Dark chocolate is better, better for you, and pairs well with a variety of red wines and dark beers (aka grown up beer). Seriously, acquire some taste. 😒
12 | George Fredlund | 3 | 10154719964783675_10154720601998675 | Hershey's really does not contain enough cocoa butter to be called chocolate. It can be called a confection. 85 to 90% rule!
13 | Rochelle Moore | 0 | 10154719964783675_10154721080993675 | 💜💜I said better because doctors and nutritionists have said dark chocolate is more heart healthy than milk chocolate.I like them both I was just making a statement about what I have read about the two. Do ,t make a federal case out of it!
14 | Connie Thompson Jones | 0 | 10154719964783675_10154720556453675 | Nope .... Wrong..... Lol... Just my opinion on savory dark chocolate. Dark chocolate can be savored with coffee , red wine, and brandy when a girl needs a comforting friend
15 | Nicky Leach | 3 | 10154719964783675_10154720155068675 | Dark is too stimulating for me, as I have health issues; however, good quality milk chocolate I can do. Green and Blacks is very good, with organic sugar.
16 | Gary DiNardo | 1 | 10154719964783675_10154720322283675 | After seeing ANY of the dozens of videos taken in dairies by Mercy For Animals undercover investigators, a decent person will want to stay away from any 'milk' chocolate.

20 | Lani Teshima | 6 | 10154719964783675_10154720115713675 | That's like saying stale vomit is better than filet mignon. Just crazy talk designed to drive Internet traffic!!
21 | Alexander Arnote | 7 | 10154719964783675_10154720123728675 | Milk chocolate in Europe is way better than American so you need to define where they are talking about
22 | Mike Guay | 4 | 10154719964783675_10154720063128675 | PBS NewsHourJudging by the comments, you've jumped the shark on this one. Lol
23 | Alexander Molisana | 2 | 10154719964783675_10154720110863675 | Chocolate is only good for you in moderation and only if it's "organic ". All major brands of chocolate and candy we get nowadays are full of GMO's
24 | Larry Moffett | 4 | 10154719964783675_10154720094793675 | That's not an indictment of dark chocolate but of Hershey's dark chocolate, which tastes like cardboard.
25 | Trish Feldmann | 0 | 10154719964783675_10154720903028675 | I am incredibly dismayed that not one person on this site is concerned about promoting Hershey ' chocolate. They purchase their ingredients from purveyors that practice child slave labor to harvest

Climate change is a gradual process, driven by invisible pollution. So it can be hard to wrap your brain around. But these scientists have made it possible to listen to the planet changing. (from KUOW Public Radio)

1 | Cere Penry Gatlin | 1 | 10154719562438675_10154720156013675 | I am 58 years old. I have been hit over my head with climate change and pollution control my entire life. I can remember learning Pollution songs in first grade!  Our government -- democrats and republicans have had many many chances to get us away from fossil fuels. They won't do it. Way too much $$ in special interests. They don't WANT us to be free. The USA has been regulated to death and yet we turn a blind eye to India and China -- the worlds greatest polluter. We could have been using diesel made from trash decades ago but they won't let us.
2 | Jared Mathew | 3 | 10154719562438675_10154719799583675 | Lmao. These are computer models that have already been proven to be programmed in a bias manner. You're better off studying sun cycles, volcanic activity, and tectonic plate activity. If you're looking for pollution that's easily monitored. And our air quality is better than it was 40 years ago.

4 | Antilusional | 0 | 10154719562438675_10154720843198675 | Climate change is real! Global warming is real! They have been keeping records, and very recently, all time warming records have been broken again, and again!That, in itself isn't up for debate! Evidence is not debatable. And observation is an observation. Those aren't opinions. They are measurements. Anyone choosing to turn that in itself into a fight and battle, doesn't have a leg to stand on. The thing about science (aka, evidence based study), is that it is true, whether or not you believe in it.
5 | Dirk Willard | 0 | 10154719562438675_10154722334923675 | Look it's not as simple as capturing CO2 in rocks or digesting it by photosynthesis. Until animals arrived, the O2 levels were high, perhaps 40% compared to 60% N2. Now, they are at 21% and falling. We need to convert the CO2 to C and O2.
6 | Bruce Kirchner | 0 | 10154719562438675_10154722583153675 | One thing folks don't understand - carbon dioxide is NOT a pollutant. It is an end product of combustion in anything that's carbon-fuelled (both animals and machinery). Plus, it's necessary for sustaining plant life. It is the least of worries when it comes to pollution. Folks who think it will solve anything by switching from fossil fuel to alternative carbon-based fuels are only misleading themselves and others.

Democrats are relying on winning Illinois as they look to regain control of the Senate.

1 | Marta Goodman | 85 | 10154719555563675_10154719766498675 | We have way too many crazy geezers in the Senate! How about John McCain who shamelessly declares the continuation of the obstructionism by Republicans in Washington if Clinton wins? How can anybody be OK with that? Haven't eight years been enough?Geezers out!
2 | Sheila Jaskie | 64 | 10154719555563675_10154719749448675 | Republican FL Senator Rubio recently submitted a bill to force women to give birth to Zika babies.   If you have the Zika virus (which stays in your body 180 days) you will not get an abortion if Rubio has his way.   Please vote Blue all the way down the ticket to keep the Republican agenda out of women's bodies.
3 | Ved Lekic | 37 | 10154719555563675_10154719723963675 | He showed his true racist colors. Disgrace. Get him out of the Senate
4 | Judy Epp-Kelsey | 17 | 10154719555563675_10154719740508675 | You see?  Why would you do something like that when its so important to your party that you get re-elected?  They just sabotage themselves, like Ved Lekic says, showing their true colors.
5 | Sally Grey Weeks | 3 | 10154719555563675_10154719879163675 | Ah.. so much political clean-up to do... and new nuts campaigning all the time. With all the mud-slinging, it's a wonder any honest person ever WANTS to run for office. That's a bad turn for our country.

It's just a matter of time until the public interests are disregarded for special interests.Mitch McConnellHarry ReidJohn McCainJohn KerryHillary Clintonand others from both parties should be voted out of Washington.
7 | Kelly Jenkins | 0 | 10154719555563675_10154720563733675 | Ok people check this out my husband has lived here for 14 years, he bought this house from his family which are now deceased and have been for MANY years like 20 years I just checked the mail and we have mail from the Democratic Party wanting their votes these people are deceased have been for 20 years now you tell me they aren't using the deceased for votes!!!!! How Messed Up Is This!!!!!!!
8 | Sheryl Fitzgerald | 4 | 10154719555563675_10154720364608675 | good. But the best reason to not reelect him is because he spent the last eight years not doing his job by obstructing EVERYTHING. Besides Tammie is much better and an actual war hero. Already gleefully voted for her. bye Marky.
9 | Melanie Weiss | 0 | 10154719555563675_10154721190098675 | It was a totally inappropriate and uncalled for comment and is typical of the hubris of some Republicans and Trump supporters, who feel they can say anything with no repercussions. It was especially disrespectful from someone who served in the Armed Forces to someone who made a far greater sacrifice than he did.

15 | Kathy Doane | 9 | 10154719555563675_10154719760613675 | Some point the Republican party is going to have to face the ugly image in the mirror.
16 | Bryan Evans | 1 | 10154719555563675_10154719898888675 | In case you didn't notice having a Democratic president didn't really have that much impact on actual policy. Same shyte, different administration.

18 | Marcia Tanabe | 0 | 10154719555563675_10154720797498675 | Had enough of scandals?  A vote for Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka and the Green Party is a vote for a viable multi-party democracy going forward."Just 5 percent of the national vote for the Green Party Stein/Baraka ticket can be a true game-changer for American politics. It will qualify the Green Party for recognition as an official national party, and for federal funding in the 2020 presidential race proportional to the amount of votes received — at least $8 million to $10 million. It would also secure ballot access in a number of states that automatically grant ballot status if the presidential candidate receives anywhere from 1 percent to 5 percent of the vote (varying by state). It means the party can leap over the undemocratic barriers to ballot access for independent parties in many states, and help us lay the groundwork for a truly competitive challenge to the two-party system and the corporate rule it perpetuates." A majority of Americans are disgusted with the political farce we are enduring. They are desperate for a principled alternative to the predatory bipartisan establishment, and seek a positive path out of the two-party trap. Investing your vote in a 5-percent victory for the Green Party can make it happen.” -- Jill SteinThird Party Presidential Forum:One week before what’s shaping up to be an historic presidential election, Tavis Smiley on PBS will host a presidential forum featuring the third party candidates, Jill Stein of the Green Party and Gary Johnson of the Libertarian Party.This forum will be taped live Monday, October 31, 2016, in the show’s Los Angeles studio and air on Tavis Smiley over two nights next week on Mondayevening and Tuesday, November 1 on PBS.

Hear what Clinton and Trump supporters are telling Judy Woodruff. Join us for more from the campaign trail on tonight's PBS NewsHour.
--------------Comments:--------------
1 | Lynda Young | 244 | 10154719414203675_10154719537768675 | It's the well spoken well informed Clinton supporters and then we have the strange people supporting Trump because his name is on a building or he's going to close the border according to a woman who is clearly an immigrant herself. Just wow.
2 | Dan Wight | 155 | 10154719414203675_10154719502993675 | I wonder what Trump supporters would say if they knew he has laundered hundreds of millions of dollars for Russian connections through his real estate endeavors.
3 | Ruth Anne Byrns | 64 | 10154719414203675_10154719551053675 | The clear difference in the level of intelligence says it all. One group is thoughtful and articulate, and the other is quite simply dumber than dirt.
4 | Suzanne Allen Crabtree | 28 | 10154719414203675_10154719556723675 | Trump's been in 4,056 lawsuits, and found guilty of breaking federal law 237 times. He's currently under investigation for:1. Illegally using his charity for personal legal fees and fines.2. Trump University- fraud, racketeering, and misrepresentation.3. Raping a 13 yr old girl. Trial brings Dec. 16, 2016. Case 1:16-cv-04642 Filed 06/20/16.4. Illegally paying off the Florida Attorney General to avoid being investigated for Trump University.5. Illegally violating US laws under the Cuba embargo.And, he's been found guilty of rape 4 times and sexual assault 20 times, all of which he negotiated a plea deal to pay the women off.Most comprehensive research on Trump's lawsuits and criminal indictments:http://www.usatoday.com/pages/interactives/trump-lawsuits/
5 | Ellen Jo Hillis Tate | 30 | 10154719414203675_10154719508798675 | I guess you could hit some of these people in the face with the fact that getting money from Chinese and Russians IS foreign influence and they wouldn't believe it. That is Donald Trump in spades! So sad.
6 | Linda Booher Brooks | 20 | 10154719414203675_10154719694928675 | I wish with all me heart all of the noise would just get out of her way and let her be herself. She will make an excellent president. You go Hillary Clinton in 2016
7 | Luly Betancourt | 29 | 10154719414203675_10154719507318675 | The older blond lady with the heavy accent in support of Trump is ironically missing that she, herself is a foreigner! What if Trump decided that whatever her origin is should be deported?! How stupid some people can be is mind boggling.
8 | Susan Means Rosenberg | 15 | 10154719414203675_10154719694508675 | The people who spoke in support of HIllary seem so smart, knowledgeable...educated.  The Trump supporters should be wearing foil hats...."All you see is Wynn and Trump in Las Vegas"  Now that is a reason to vote for someone.  I am sure Judy didn't have to search very far for the Trump dummies.
9 | Bobpen Walendzik | 28 | 10154719414203675_10154719493268675 | 1. You join a lying machine and call Hillary crooked. But you support a man who refuses to release his tax returns. You support a greedy, self serving, manipulative proven tax cheat. You support a crooked narcissistic psychopath who is worried his tax returns would reveal evidence of financial ties to Russian oligarchs and other dictators of the world. Just like we now know Putin's puppets illegally paid millions to his crooked former campaign manager, maybe he has been getting paid too. A corrupt little man whose daughter vacations with Putin's girlfriend. Making Russia great again? A con man who funneled millions of campaign money to his own companies and used campaign money to pay his family handsomely. Using his own words, a disgusting and corrupt man who surrounds himself with a disgusting corrupt people. 2. You say you love our veterans but support a man who believes POWs are not heroes because they were captured? A man who has shown he lacks emotional intelligence when he attacked families of a fallen war hero. A man whose company fired a veteran for being deployed to Afghanistan. A man who insults and derides our generals.3. You think a soulless, heartless small man who mocked a disabled reporter will make a good president. A man whose first instinct after a tragedy is always self-aggrandizement, like after Orlando mass shooting & when Dwyane Wade's cousin Nykea Aldridge was killed. As 3,000 people were dying, this man bragged about how 9/11 attacks were good for him & bragged about how his building is now the tallest in Manhattan just hours after the attack. When the pound fell to a 30-year low following the vote to exit EU, he boasted about making money off British economic uncertainty. When the housing market collapsed in 2008 and millions of Americans lost their homes, he said “ I 'sort of hope' real estate market tanks.” Trump is always looking out for Trump. How do you believe a greedy, narcissistic man who fundamentally lacks empathy and compassion will be a good president? He is not even a good person.4. You say you're patriotic & love this country but you support a man who has so little understanding of the basic parameters of our constitution's limits & has zero respect for it, except the part he uses to incite violence. A careless small man who asked Russia to spy on our former Secretary of State. A man who trash talks our NATO allies and our president but lavishly praises brutal dictators like Saddam Hussein, Kim Jong Un, Muammar Gaddafi, Vladimir Putin...etc5. You support a small man who has been married three times and has admitted to infidelity in the past. A man who was accused of raping his wife & has a federal lawsuit accusing him of raping a 13-year-old girl during a party hosted by convicted pedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein. A man who comments about his daughters breasts and body. Then you turn around and bring up Bill Clinton's history with women? I agree with you 100% Bill has a disgraceful history with women but no comparison to Trump who has said cringeworthy, disturbing things about women his whole life. May I remind you Bill is NOT running to be the next president. If you are saying oh, candidates spouses are fair game then you can't ignore that he is married to a woman whose naked pictures are all over the internet. 6. You support a man whose business career is a very long list of bankruptcies, defaults and deceptions because he is good for our economy? A man who was born into wealth and built that wealth by scamming, stiffing and bullying ordinary working citizens of this great country. 7. Yes, Hillary is not perfect, then again no one is. You call her dishonest but support a narcissistic pathological liar? Every time Trump opens his mouth every other word that comes out is a lie. Fact checkers have proven it over and over again. We are talking about a man who makes things up to spew hate and fear, like when he lied about seeing an Iran ransom video and a video of muslims celebrating in New Jersey on 9/11. The man is incapable of telling the truth and he is delusional.8. You support a hypocritical man who hired undocumented immigrants for his real estate projects & exploited our visa program. He is a man capable of solving our immigration problem?9. I agree 100% if she's elected Hillary and her whole family must distance themselves from the Clinton foundation. Let other people continue the great work the foundation is doing. With that said, you support a man whose foundation is found guilty of a pay-to-play scam and false claims of giving on its tax forms and then turn around and try to push fabricated scandals about the Clinton foundation. The IRS found the con man used funds from his charitable foundation to make a campaign donation to Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi. Just after 4 days of the bribe payment Pam dropped Trump U case. He also held $150K fundraiser for Pam after she dropped a criminal case against his university. His foundation claimed on its tax return forms that it gave $10,000.00 to The Giving Back Fund, but the organization says that donation does not exist. A man who completely retooled his charity to spend other people’s money. A man with deep ties to global financiers, foreign politicians and criminals. 10. You claim the con man whose line of clothing and accessories are made in Bangladesh, China, Honduras and other low-wage countries is the man to fix our labor laws? You claim the man who outsources everything is the answer to creating jobs here at home?11. You claim the unfit, unstable Putin's little puppet whose campaign is fully embracing alt-right's anti-Muslim and anti-Immigrant ideologies with all their conspiracy theories is the one to unite the country?12. You support a bottom feeder who put racial discrimination in housing at the heart of his real estate developments, started the birther movement, said "Obama would look perfect on food stamps, he has the right face for it,” and has shown he is prejudice with his actions & words over and over again. Then he pretends he cares about the black communities. He brings up Hillary's reference to a group of violent repeat criminals as "super-predators" in 1996? I don't agree with her choice of words all those years ago but she has apologized since. Something Trump refuses to do. Of course you can use all kind of deflection tactics & tell yourself whatever makes you feel better but the reality is if you are supporting a racist, misogynistic, xenophobic, bigoted, unfit, unqualified, disgusting con man, you really should admit to yourself you don't care what he says or does. You are using your hatred to cloud your judgement.
10 | Saal Ali Ali | 14 | 10154719414203675_10154719493488675 | Trump is a crackpot whose behaviour is unpredictable and that's the main reason clinton's preferred-a safe pair of hands which will do WS's biding.💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
11 | Annette Velazquez | 4 | 10154719414203675_10154719904133675 | Well you could see the level of educated individuals by this video. All it does is prove The Stereotype that Trump supporters are stupid and Hillary supporters are intellectual. However, I know some intellectuals that will be supporting Donald Trump, but my vote is for Hillary Clinton.
12 | CJ Peterman | 4 | 10154719414203675_10154719996878675 | LMAO There is a clear difference between Clinton supporters and Trump supporters that can be seen in this video. Trump should be president because he has a product to sell? 😳😳😱 Lord, help us!
13 | Fidel Hernandez | 4 | 10154719414203675_10154719608678675 | such a shame that you imply these are the only two choices. They are the only two, ESTABLISHMENT and CORPORATE choices, but they don't represent people! They, both of them, represent the monied interests. where would "they" make their fortunes if we decided to not go to work?
14 | Brian Norberg | 1 | 10154719414203675_10154720193298675 | That Hillary Clinton is better than Trump is irrefutable.But don't be blind about who Secretary Clinton is, or what she will dohttp://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/2016/01/06/new-hillary-emails-reveal-true-motive-for-libya-intervention/http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-us-is-openly-sending-heavy-weapons-from-libya-to-syrian-rebels/5494913
15 | Anthony Grant | 0 | 10154719414203675_10154721295838675 | Considering he selling himself as the self-made brand (with $40M from dad as a step-up), I am surprised Trump hasnt wheeled out from his 1000s of employees at least a handfull of them to show how much of the man of the people he is, ie American jobs for Americans. Surely there are some happy bunnies among them and not all are undocumented.
16 | Sharon Pugh | 2 | 10154719414203675_10154719774608675 | I keep wondering if these people who support Trump actually listen to what he says? Notice that most of his supporters are white people that want to blame someone for their misfortunes. Trump never offers solutions to the aggrieved. He doesn't have any and quite frankly he believes it sucks to be you. I feel these people need to record why they like Trump and play it back.
17 | Glenda Taylor | 0 | 10154719414203675_10154722257953675 | It's sad that these Trump supporters think a Trump presidency will benefit them. If he won't pay those he has contracts with who've done work for him, why do they think he will actually do anything that benefits anyone other than himself if he is elected? And, do they realize, he has NO governmental experience. Who would actually be running our country, "guiding" him through the Presidency?
18 | Omar Walters | 3 | 10154719414203675_10154720037263675 | " I could shoot someone in the middle of 5th avenue and get away with it..." Can you believe those words could actually be true? This man clearly can do no wrongs in the eyes of his supporters. Anyone with half a brain could see that DT is an idiot. I've never been more ashamed of my country before...
19 | Jeff Clark | 1 | 10154719414203675_10154720012903675 | Is it just me, but the lady who "wants our borders closed" seems extraordinarily hypocritical - she's asking for something that would have prevented her from ever voting in this election had it been in place when she or her family arrived from wherever they came from which I'm pretty sure was not one of our states.
20 | Andy Maggie Grande | 1 | 10154719414203675_10154719723673675 | While she is qualified, skills wise,I am appalled at her lack of integrity.She will drag us through the next four years with scandal nipping away at her and our nation's psyche if she doesn't  step aside and let her running mate ,Tim Kaine assume her position as.nominee.I.loathe Trump, but she is a criminal.
21 | Ron Evans | 0 | 10154719414203675_10154720440128675 | FBI director warns of upcoming massive “terrorist diaspora”Comey, in testimony before Congress, said the U.S. remains extremely concerned that violent extremists will eventually flow out of Syria and Iraq and into other countries in hopes of committing attacks.“There will be a terrorist diaspora sometime in the next two to five years like we’ve never seen before,” Comey said.Johnson said terrorist threats have evolved, moving from terrorist-directed attacks “to a world that also includes the threat of terrorist-inspired attacks” in which individuals who live in the U.S. are “self-radicalized” to attack their own country.http://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/fbi-director-warns-of-upcoming-massive-terrorist-diaspora/
22 | Andrew Bugbee | 2 | 10154719414203675_10154719951478675 | Drumpf is as unsuitable for the presidency as Hillary is. That being said...These are issues which Hillary is on the record for either being involved in, supporting, flip flopping, and/or outright lying about. NAFTA, KXL, TARP, Columbia free trade agreement, Panama free trade agreement(Panama Papers), Haiti min wage suppression, UBS tax dodgers, Crime Bill, Iraq war vote, Patriot act (voted for twice), diversion of money from education to prison construction, increased foreign arms sales to human rights abusing states by 143%, bombing Libya, pushed no-fly zone in Syria, Welfare reform, three strikes legislation, DOMA, DADT, sold fracking, (one of the most environmentally damaging energy extraction processes), around the world, called the TPP the "gold standard" of trade deals, etc... Take note that I don't view Benghazi, Whitewater, or Vince Foster type Republican crap to be valid negative points against Hillary, and I haven't even brought up private servers, or DNC emails. Everything I listed here is a matter of record with no specious nor misogynistic allegations involved. Also take note that none of the Republican critics of Hillary ever mention any of these negatives because these are all things that Republicans favor. If any of you view stating things that are factual and part of her record as being negative, or as "bashing" Hillary, then maybe you might want to rethink your support for her. If you ignore her many less than admirable positions and actions, then your thinking is as corrupt as she is.GO GREEN!
23 | Amit Choudhury | 0 | 10154719414203675_10154721930933675 | Trump supporters clearly are not willing to face the reality of an unbalanced,egoistic psycho with his finger on the nuclear button.His treatment of women,knowledge of government and his evasion of taxes is a sinister pointer. Dump Trump the Chump I say....please.
24 | Sandra Edobor | 2 | 10154719414203675_10154719772993675 | Why didn't Judith correct the last woman that Trump is exactly the person she described not to like. That is why I have no respect for people who call themselves journalist. You are in the business to inform people who are less informed because they live in the bubble.
25 | Nellzz AH | 1 | 10154719414203675_10154720145328675 | Trump supporters are so misinformed, love the russian woman talking about immigration lol and the woman dressed like she wants to be young or the guy who says he saw two signs Wyn and Trump, dude as him for his tax and you'll see what that was really built on.

10 | Rex Tilton | 1 | 10154719295423675_10154719483343675 | The Bangor Maine Daily News  BLOCKED me from their FB page after I posted this Pro Second Amendment comment on one of their FB postings about Hunting. I'd  comment about hunting in Maine but they've taken my firearms from me here in Massachusetts.... I'm 53 years old and 2 years ago they took all my guns (even my black powder rifle) because I had a DUI 32 years ago.2 years ago they took my guns for a DUI I had 32 years ago. They said I have to get a Doctors note saying I'm not an alcoholic. I drink about 1 or 2 glasses of wine a week. Perhaps 2 beers a month. So I meet with my HMO Doctor for the first time... and asked if she could do a blood test or something that proves I'm not an alcoholic.  This was a rather humiliating conversation... in that I had to tell her so I could get my LTC and FID back. Instead of doing any testing, she said she had to talk the HMO lawyers first. 2 weeks later she said no, the HMO LAWYERS said there's nothing they can do for me.When I tried renew my LTC/FID one of the questions on the form asked if I've ever had a DUI... I answered honestly and got all my guns taken!Mitt Romney passed that DUI take your guns away law in Massachusetts when he was Governor here. Look out, it's headed for the whole country under Hillary's rules. Just think what she'll do to the Supreme Court. Her and her band of anti-gun-nut Lefto's will enact laws that will do this to millions of more Americans.They even took my Son's Henry Mini Bolt 22!Trump 2016

We all keep seeing how much corruption comes out every day and the media keeps covering it up. Main Street Media to the Hillary supporter ignore all of Hillary’s Lies, Scandals, And Corruption, and Go Vote for Her then say Yes Master. Hillary is like the bully on the school yard that picks on the week and the naïve. She is willing to say anything and do anything to keep the money coming in to the Bill Clinton Inc. She has to use the power of the office to pardon herself and keep the corruption going on.   We have to look at all the women out of work, all the women that live in poor house, All Hillary is going is throw them under the bus after she gets their vote. Hillary has never able to pass the New York bar exam. Let’s talk about borders, if you cross the border illegally in Canada you get a $5000 fine, if you cross the border illegally in Iran you get 8 years in prison, if you cross the border illegally in North Korea you get shot, if you cross the border in Mexico illegally they have no hesitation in throwing you in jail, If you cross the border illegally in the U.S. you get a Drivers License, Medical Insurance, Housing, Career Training, the right to Vote. Obama care/Hillary care, Pennsylvania 53% increase, Arizona 116% increase, Minnesota 59% increase, Florida 20% increase, North Carolina 40% increase. Hillary has corrupted the FBI and the DOJ where we cannot trust them. She wants to fix the laws to her advantage not the American people will take it in the shorts again. If the people don’t want to take our country back then vote for Hillary is a vote for world war 3 with the Russia. There will a lot of good honest men and women black, white, Mexican; Cubans will die in a horrible and bloody death. This will come for years to come. FBI Reopening Investigation into Clintons E-mails.Hey it is the drip, drip, drip, she thinks she is untouchable. Let’s see how she and her staff cover this up with their B.S. The bad thing about the Clintons is they don’t have any moral values towards anyone except for the power. Weiner hands laptop over to FBI as Clinton keeps her distance. And you wonder why other countries don’t trust us

Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel says he is backing Republican Donald Trump because he is "the only outsider left in the race."

1 | Sariena Carmichael | 260 | 10154719058748675_10154719165368675 | Who cares that Drumpf's racism, homophobia, xenophobia, sexism, division, fraud, and hate goes against EVERYTHING America has always stood for. What another fellow royal idiot this guy is.
2 | Eric Moss | 224 | 10154719058748675_10154719170218675 | Because hey, no one needs an "outsider' like a billionaire.  Well, as long as the 'outsider' promises to cut taxes on the very wealthiest.  Wow, what an innovative thinker.
3 | Nathan Henderson | 99 | 10154719058748675_10154719208718675 | On what planet is billionaire (or millionaire, won't release actual finances) heir to a real estate empire an "outsider"?If he means Trump lacks any public service experience, civilian or military, that is true!  But he's been part of the economic class that dominates public policy concerns his entire life.
4 | Fawn Neun | 77 | 10154719058748675_10154719251458675 | Yeah, next time I need surgery, I want a complete amateur to do the job. None of these highly educated "insider" AMA certified surgeons for me! That's so mainstream!
5 | Paul Jackson | 56 | 10154719058748675_10154719201158675 | Trump voters favor the New York businessman who has never held political office “because we judge the leadership of our country to have failed.”That's not a reason to support Trump. Trump has failed on a number of occasions. He's hopelessly ignorant about how the government works and he thinks he's absolutely brilliant. It's a dangerous combination, and if he should somehow manage to con his way into office, Thiel and his other groupies will regret it.
6 | Teresa Baustian | 35 | 10154719058748675_10154719249658675 | By "outsider," he means "incompetent." That's all, because Trump is totally in with the moneyed interests that rig Washington. He's even talked about buying some congresspeople.

8 | Robert Barnes | 15 | 10154719058748675_10154719695173675 | We need outsiders? Really? Like that wild outsider Mike Pence or maybe that old time Jim Crow-loving dolt, Jeff Sessions and the other sycophants angling for preferment are people like Christie, Giuliani, Lee, Gingrich etc. Not an outsider among them. Thiel wants people to believe that he actually is qualified to weigh in on this because he can buy just the access he complains about. Oh, but this is different. Just another narcissistic turd with a few Billion that thinks he's entitled to a bigger voice than the rest of us.
9 | Suresh Nair | 2 | 10154719058748675_10154721258553675 | What has this guy seen in trump? Calling  him an outsider is a joke. We as a country can do definitely without this outsider. On just moral grounds he deserved to be shown the door. He stoops to any low to get back to him opponent. Besides a 4th grader can better  articulate things.
10 | Francie Halderman | 11 | 10154719058748675_10154719343863675 | Yes, facing rape and racketeering charges in a few weeks does make trump an outsider.  along with everything Sariena said below.  all of those pesky things like racist just gets disregarded as irrelevant.  Impossible to rationalize away.  Some part of these supporters consciously or unconsciously are also racists, etc etc or they would not tolerate it.  Thiel is responsible for funding propaganda of hate that would take the country back several decades.
11 | Monica Ponce Castañeda | 3 | 10154719058748675_10154720932998675 | Talking about this crazy election. What worries me is that every body talks about Trump like if he were worth of it, nobody notices what his words really have behind. He has started a movement of hatred all over the country encouraging people that resonate with him to awaken old times, when humans abused even more than now the soul of our own brothers and sisters and make their life miserable. We can say that the founders of this country were high minded men, they build the nation on high principles, so high that they forged the nation we are now, I don't believe Trump's ideals, way of living or the way he approaches the world resonate with these great ideas and principles. We need to think about the changes that the world needs which is not too much, the world needs tender loving care from each of its citizens doesn't matter where they live. Look in to your heart and listen what it says, you'll find that as human beings the only thing we need and want is being happy and have joy. Forget about all politics try to look at the person's heart and based on that make your choice. Please VOTE wisely.
12 | Laurie El | 9 | 10154719058748675_10154719374188675 | To hell with him and you! 🖕🏽He's no outside when he's a privileged billionaire. Please. But again his interests aren't the little or middle man so why should this Silicon Valley elite think any differently. Outsider alright.
13 | Jane Chew-Bentley | 3 | 10154719058748675_10154721002613675 | “Donald Trump said he'd fight for workers and the middle class. Words are cheap, so let's look at his record: Donald Trump cheated his subcontractors, he cheated his workers, he shipped jobs overseas, he brought in foreign workers to do work that Americans could have done. He said he's worried about student debt, but he ran a fake "university" that was a predatory real estate scam designed to strip hardworking people of their bank accounts and max out their credit cards. I don’t see in Donald Trump someone who has ever woken up a single day in his life fighting for American workers. To the contrary, he has spent his life making himself rich at the expense of middle class Americans." - Jeff Merkley
14 | Paula Israel | 9 | 10154719058748675_10154719524153675 | That is the most pathetic excuse to support a bigot, racist,sexist and as Sarlena below said -everything we stand for. I actually feel sorry for this guy- He must be really insecure. Does he really think he will be respected for what he is doing? Does he think his money will prove what a great person he is? What a great model he is for the future generations of our country. Bah Humbug- He just contributes to all of the evil and hatred that Trump believes in- I hope some of the attendees at the National Press Club left while he was talking.
15 | E. Peter McLean | 7 | 10154719058748675_10154720262183675 | When you're rich you don't have to worry about Social Security, Supreme Court appointments, gay rights, women's rights, healthcare and pharmaceutical costs, a future for your kids. Peter Thiel is interested only in protecting his wealth - not our democracy.
16 | Jim Bullard | 11 | 10154719058748675_10154719329248675 | Outsider to government in the public service sense, but since our government is largely under the thumb of corporations these days I see him as the ultimate insider in the established order.
17 | Gloria Graves Gregory | 1 | 10154719058748675_10154721125838675 | He's not supporting Trump because he's "the only outsider left in the race"; he's supporting Donald Trump's ability to keep those HUGE tax breaks in place and grope women. p.s. Thiel's another German-American. Boycott Paypal.
18 | JoAnne Ellis | 6 | 10154719058748675_10154719416858675 | So he would hire trump to run his company? And no one that gets hired to work at his company knows anything about the job either? Smells more like "personal gain".
19 | Sandy Graham | 0 | 10154719058748675_10154722565463675 | Lol, Peter. Are you sure it isn't also because he shares your opinion that the rich should get richer while the poor should suck it, that democracy is incompatible with great and sustaining nations, and that the independence of the Fourth Estate should be obliterated?You are a delusional, woman-loathing, self-entitled, narcissistic douche. You two are like peas in a pod.
20 | Jane Mcwane | 0 | 10154719058748675_10154722218038675 | Well, I guess your wealth was done justby luck because clearly you never read what Trump stands for , otherwise I can not imagine how you could be so hateful to our country !
21 | David Evan Karasek | 0 | 10154719058748675_10154721808183675 | Trump is not an outsider. He's a predictable member of a hoarding party and many of his supporters are rich hoarders like this guy. If billionaires were ethical, like J.K. Rowling, they'd give their money away and would no longer be billionaires. Being a billionaire is already a sign that you don't give a crap about the rest of humanity. And it's a predictable indicator of how you vote. Go to any wealthy area in America and you see the Trump lawn signs. No matter what Trump or any other Republican nominees does or says you're gonna see those lawn signs for whoever that nominee is. And you're always gonna see the celebrities (the ones that never experienced or don't want to remember being poor) predictably voting for their wealthy insiders.
22 | Charley Drake | 1 | 10154719058748675_10154719896633675 | There are many outsiders available.  My crazy uncle Ernie is probably available.  He's on a street corner somewhere downtown with a sign.  Something about the end of the earth.  Check him out next time you want an outsider to run.
23 | Dale Richner | 3 | 10154719058748675_10154719737883675 | I find his stance shameful. In what other context or industry or sector would we ever, ever say, "I'm not 100% happy with the status quo, so the best solution is to install a new leader who has the least amount of experience possible"? I wonder if that's his real reason.
24 | Mike Shepherd | 1 | 10154719058748675_10154722081863675 | Where judgment and informed thinking should be, this sad guy has a deep well of anger, selfishness and need for attention. Of course Trump is appealing to him since he validates Thiel's worst qualities.
25 | Wendy Mellon | 1 | 10154719058748675_10154719844798675 | What billionaire will be against Trump? He's not promising to raise taxes for the very wealthy. Hillary is. And an economic downturn in this man's life means nothing in comparison to the effect on us all. Please vote and vote for Hillary.

1 | William H Boley | 21 | 10154528076181083_10154528181206083 | The Senate is still a tossup, and the House will remain firmly in the GOP camp. The Senate is the key, given the impact on the Supreme Court appointment process.
2 | Bill Stephens | 20 | 10154528076181083_10154528180281083 | I doubt the House, because of all of the Republican gerrymandering (case in point: Pennsylvania's 7th District). The House probably won't flip until the beginning of 2023, when the redistricting from the 2020 Census takes effect.

6 | Ron Evans | 0 | 10154528076181083_10154529924701083 | The Russians now control 50% of all the uranium in the United States. The Clintons are the most corrupt politicians in American history and she may become president. American is screwed! Hillary Clinton sold the Russians uranium rights to mines in Wyoming! Cash Flowed to Clinton Foundation Amid Russian Uranium DealThe headline on the website Pravda trumpeted President Vladimir V. Putin’s latest coup, its nationalistic fervor recalling an era when its precursor served as the official mouthpiece of the Kremlin: “Russian Nuclear Energy Conquers the World.”The article, in January 2013, detailed how the Russian atomic energy agency, Rosatom, had taken over a Canadian company with uranium-mining stakes stretching from Central Asia to the American West. The deal made Rosatom one of the world’s largest uranium producers and brought Mr. Putin closer to his goal of controlling much of the global uranium supply chain.But the untold story behind that story is one that involves not just the Russian president, but also a former American president and a woman who would like to be the next one.At the heart of the tale are several men, leaders of the Canadian mining industry, who have been major donors to the charitable endeavors of former President Bill Clinton and his family. Members of that group built, financed and eventually sold off to the Russians a company that would become known as Uranium One.Among the agencies that eventually signed off was the State Department, then headed by Mr. Clinton’s wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton.As the Russians gradually assumed control of Uranium One in three separate transactions from 2009 to 2013, Canadian records show, a flow of cash made its way to the Clinton Foundation. Uranium One’s chairman used his family foundation to make four donations totaling $2.35 million. Those contributions were not publicly disclosed by the Clintons, despite an agreement Mrs. Clinton had struck with the Obama White House to publicly identify all donors. Other people with ties to the company made donations as well.And shortly after the Russians announced their intention to acquire a majority stake in Uranium One, Mr. Clinton received $500,000 for a Moscow speech from a Russian investment bank with links to the Kremlin that was promoting Uranium One stock.A Uranium One sign that points to a 35,000-acre ranch owned by John Christensen, near the town of Gillette, Wyo. Uranium One has the mining rights to Mr. Christensen’s property.
